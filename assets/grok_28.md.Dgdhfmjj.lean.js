This ensures a central gap is created, evenly splitting the remaining numbers into two sequences. 3. **Pairing Strategy**:    - After eliminating the numbers (47, 48, ldots, 55), we are left with the split sequences:       [      {1, 2, 3, ldots, 46} quad text{and} quad {56, 57, ldots, 101}      ]    - Next, we consider a pairing of numbers from these sequences:      [      (1, 101), (2, 100), (3, 99), ldots, (46, 56)      ]    - Essentially, each pair sums to (102). 4. **Second Player's Moves**:    - No matter which numbers the second player eliminates, the first player will respond by eliminating a number from the corresponding pair that maintains the desired symmetry.    - For example, if the second player eliminates (1), the first player will eliminate (101). If the second player eliminates (2), the first player will eliminate (100), and so on. 5. **Final Move**:    - After both players have made 11 rounds of moves (each eliminating 9 numbers per round, totaling (9 times 11 = 99) numbers eliminated), only two numbers remain.    - Given the pairing strategy, the remaining two numbers will always be one from each half of the original split. 6. **Resulting Difference**:    - Since each pair sums to (102), the difference between the two remaining numbers from any surviving pair will be ( left| 56 - 46 right| = 52). Conclusion: - The first player, by following this strategy, always ensures the final score is:   [   boxed{52}   ]"},{"instruction":"A, B, C, and D enter into a partnership.

By letting the derivative f'(x) < 0, we can find the interval where f(x) is decreasing. [Step-by-step Solution] 1. Calculate the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3a 2. Set the derivative to zero and solve for x: 3x^2 - 3a = 0 x = pm sqrt{a} 3. Since the maximum value of f(x) is 6 and the minimum value is 2, we have: f(sqrt{a}) = 2 quad text{and} quad f(-sqrt{a}) = 6 4. Solving these equations, we find a = 1 and b = 4. 5. Now, let's find where the function is decreasing by checking when f'(x) < 0: 3x^2 - 3 < 0 x^2 - 1 < 0 (x + 1)(x - 1) < 0 Solving this inequality, we obtain -1 < x < 1. 6. Therefore, the interval where f(x) is decreasing is boxed{(-1, 1)}."},{"instruction":"A and B undertake to do a piece of work for Rs. 600. A alone can do it in 6 days while B alone can do it in 8 days. With the help of C, they finish it in 3 days. The share of A is Rs. 300 and B is Rs. 225. What is the share of C?","output":"Let's first calculate the amount of work A and B can do per day. A can complete the work in 6 days, so A's work per day is 1/6 of the total work. B can complete the work in 8 days, so B's work per day is 1/8 of the total work. Together, A and B can complete (1/6 + 1/8) of the work per day. To find this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 24 in this case. So, A's work per day is 4/24 of the total work, and B's work per day is 3/24 of the total work. Together, A and B can complete (4/24 + 3/24) = 7/24 of the work per day. Now, with the help of C, they finish the work in 3 days. This means that A, B, and C together can complete 1/3 of the work per day. So, C's work per day, when working with A and B, is (1/3 - 7/24) of the work per day. To find C's work per day, we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 24, which is 24. So, C's work per day is (8/24 - 7/24) = 1/24 of the work per day. Now, we know that the total payment for the work is Rs. 600. We also know that A's share is Rs. 300 and B's share is Rs. 225. To find C's share, we subtract A and B's shares from the total payment: C's share = Total payment - (A's share + B's share) C's share = Rs. 600 - (Rs. 300 + Rs. 225) C's share = Rs. 600 - Rs. 525 C's share = Rs. 75 Therefore, C's share of the payment is Rs. boxed{75} ."},{"instruction":"For how many positive integers n less than or equal to 24 is n! evenly divisible by 1 + 2 + cdots + n? textbf{(A) } 8 qquad textbf{(B) } 12 qquad textbf{(C) } 16 qquad textbf{(D) } 17 qquad textbf{(E) } 21","output":"1. **Sum of the first n positive integers**: The sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:    [    1 + 2 + cdots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}    ]    This formula can be derived by pairing terms from the beginning and end of the sequence, each pair summing to n+1, and noting there are frac{n}{2} such pairs if n is even, or frac{n+1}{2} pairs with one unpaired middle term if n is odd. 2. **Condition for divisibility**: We need to find for how many integers n leq 24, the factorial n! is divisible by frac{n(n+1)}{2}. This is equivalent to checking when:    [    frac{n!}{frac{n(n+1)}{2}} = frac{2n!}{n(n+1)} = frac{2(n-1)!}{n+1}    ]    is an integer. Here, we simplified n! as n cdot (n-1)! and then canceled n from the numerator and denominator. 3. **Analyzing divisibility**: The expression frac{2(n-1)!}{n+1} is an integer if and only if n+1 divides 2(n-1)!. Since n+1 can be any integer from 2 to 25, we need to check when n+1 is a factor of 2(n-1)!. 4. **Prime factors**: If n+1 is a prime number, it might not divide (n-1)! unless n+1 leq n-1, which is never true. However, since we multiply by 2, if n+1 is an odd prime, we need to check if it divides (n-1)!. If n+1 is an odd prime greater than 2, it will not divide 2(n-1)! unless n+1 leq n-1, which is again never true. 5. **Counting odd primes up to 25**: The odd primes less than or equal to 25 are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. There are 8 such primes. 6. **Conclusion**: Since there are 8 values of n for which n+1 is an odd prime (and thus frac{2(n-1)!}{n+1} is not an integer), there are 24 - 8 = 16 values of n for which n! is divisible by 1 + 2 + cdots + n.

The profit in a partnership is distributed in the ratio of the product of investment and the time period for which the investment is made. So, the profit-sharing ratio for A and B would be: A's share : B's share = (Investment of A * Time period of A) : (Investment of B * Time period of B) A's share : B's share = (3X * 2Y) : (X * Y) A's share : B's share = 6XY : XY A's share : B's share = 6 : 1 This means for every 6 parts of profit that A receives, B receives 1 part.

Suppose ( A ) is heavier than ( B ), then compare ( C ) with ( B ).    - If ( C ) is heavier than ( B ), we need to compare ( C ) with ( A ) to determine if ( C ) is the heaviest or if ( A ) is still the heaviest. 3. **General Case for ( n ) Balls**:    - For ( n ) balls, we need to perform comparisons in a way that each new ball is compared with the already ranked balls to find its correct position.    - This process is similar to insertion sort, where each new element (ball) is inserted into its correct position among the already sorted elements. 4. **Number of Comparisons**:    - In the worst case, each new ball might need to be compared with all previously sorted balls.    - For ( n ) balls, the number of comparisons required is:      [      sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = frac{(n-1)n}{2}      ]    - This is because the first ball requires 0 comparisons, the second ball requires 1 comparison, the third ball requires 2 comparisons, and so on. 5. **Specific Case for 3 Balls**:    - For 3 balls, the number of comparisons required is:      [      sum_{i=1}^{2} i = 1 + 2 = 3      ] Thus, the minimum number of weighings required to rank 3 balls by weight in the worst case is 3.

Given the information in the problem, we have: 1. When P(x) is divided by x - 19, the remainder is 99. Therefore, by the Remainder Theorem, P(19) = 99. 2. When P(x) is divided by x - 99, the remainder is 19. Therefore, by the Remainder Theorem, P(99) = 19. Next, we are asked to find the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 19)(x - 99). The remainder, in this case, must be a polynomial of degree less than 2, which can be expressed in the form ax + b. Therefore, we can write: [P(x) = (x - 19)(x - 99)Q(x) + ax + b,] where Q(x) is some polynomial. To find a and b, we substitute x = 19 and x = 99 into the equation, yielding: 1. Substituting x = 19 gives us: [19a + b = P(19) = 99.] 2. Substituting x = 99 gives us: [99a + b = P(99) = 19.] Now, we solve this system of equations for a and b: 1. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: [99a + b - (19a + b) = 19 - 99,] [80a = -80,] [a = -1.] 2. Substituting a = -1 into the first equation, we get: [-19 + b = 99,] [b = 118.] Therefore, the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 19)(x - 99) is of the form ax + b, which is -x + 118.

Let the radii of the circles be ( p ), ( q ), and ( r ) with centers ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) respectively. The circles touch each other externally at points ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ). 2. The key idea is to use the fact that the ratio of the areas of two triangles is equal to the product of the ratios of their corresponding sides. We need to find the ratio of the areas of ( triangle DEF ) and ( triangle ABC ). 3. First, we note that the distance between the centers of two touching circles is the sum of their radii. Therefore:    [    AB = p + q, quad BC = q + r, quad CA = r + p    ] 4. Next, we need to find the lengths of the sides of ( triangle DEF ). Since ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ) are the points of tangency, the length of ( DE ) is the distance between the points where the circles with radii ( p ) and ( q ) touch externally.

Here's a step-by-step detailed solution: 1. **General Idea**:     - The circle S should intersect the sides of the chessboard squares only at their vertices. Therefore, for the circle to be maximal and still be fully inscribed within the black cells, it must touch the vertices of several black squares. 2. **Considering Vertices A and B of a Black Square**:     - Let S pass through two vertices A and B of a black square.     - We consider two cases: A and B being adjacent vertices and A and B being opposite vertices. 3. **Case 1: Adjacent Vertices**:     - If A and B are adjacent vertices, we consider the radius of a circle S passing through such vertices.     - The radius in this case would be half the distance across two adjacent vertices, giving us:       [       text{Radius} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}       ]     - We also consider another black square that shares vertex A and check if the circle can pass through a vertex opposite to A.

By combining the general formula of an arithmetic sequence with frac{S_{2012}}{2012}-frac{S_{10}}{10}=2002, we can find the common difference and substitute it into the formula for the sum of the first n terms to get the answer. **Solution** In an arithmetic sequence, S_n=n a_1+ frac{n(n−1)}{2}d, frac{S_n}{n}=a_1+(n−1) frac{d}{2}, which means the sequence left{ frac{S_n}{n} right} has the first term a_1=-2014 and common difference frac{d}{2}; Because frac{S_{2012}}{2012}-frac{S_{10}}{10}=2002, we have (2012-10) frac{d}{2}=2002, frac{d}{2}=1, thus, S_{2016}=2016[-2014+(2016-1)×1]=2016, therefore, the correct choice is boxed{C}."},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements is correct?

If c=0, then ac=bc simplifies to 0=0, which is always true regardless of the values of a and b. This means a does not necessarily have to equal b for the equation to hold true. Therefore, statement A is incorrect because it does not always apply. **B: If a=b, then a+2=b-2** - If we assume a=b, then adding the same value to both sides of the equation should maintain equality. Thus, a+2 should equal b+2, not b-2. This makes statement B incorrect because it contradicts the property of equality. **C: If a=b, then ac=bc** - Assuming a=b, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the same value c without changing the equality. This gives us ac=bc, which is always true when a=b. Therefore, statement C is correct and meets the requirements of the question. **D: If a^{2}=b^{2}, then a=b** - The equation a^{2}=b^{2} implies that a could be equal to b or a could be the negative of b (i.e., a=pm b).

Moreover, from problem conclusions and geometrical properties, it follows that the sought set of points (M) lies along these segments. In conclusion, the desired set of points (M) includes the points located inside the triangle formed by the intersections of these angle bisectors with the sides of (ABC). Therefore, the answer is given by:    [    text{The set of points inside the triangle with vertices at the intersections of the angle bisectors of } ABC.    ] So the final set of points (M) is the interior of the triangle formed by the bases of the angle bisectors of (ABC).

The maximum planting capacity per year is 100,000 kilograms. For each additional 10,000 kilograms of lotus roots planted, the cost increases by 10,000. The sales revenue y (in units of 10,000) is related to the quantity of lotus roots planted x (in units of 10,000 kilograms) by the equation y=frac{1}{6}x^3+ax^2+x (where a is a constant). If planting 30,000 kilograms of lotus roots results in a profit of frac{23}{2} million dollars, then to maximize the profit, how many kilograms of lotus roots should be planted each year?","output":"To solve this problem, we first define the profit function g(x) in terms of the quantity of lotus roots planted, x, in units of 10,000 kilograms. The fixed cost is 20,000, which translates to 2 million (since we're working in units of 10,000), and the variable cost increases by 1 million for each additional 10,000 kilograms of lotus roots planted. Thus, the cost function can be represented as 2 + x million dollars for x in units of 10,000 kilograms. Given the sales revenue function y=-frac{1}{6}x^3+ax^2+x, the profit function g(x) can be derived by subtracting the cost from the revenue, leading to: [g(x) = -frac{1}{6}x^3 + ax^2 + x - (2 + x) = -frac{1}{6}x^3 + ax^2 - 2] Given that planting 30,000 kilograms (or x=3) results in a profit of frac{23}{2} million dollars, we can set up the equation: [-frac{1}{6} times 3^3 + a times 3^2 - 2 = frac{23}{2}] Solving for a gives: [-frac{1}{6} times 27 + 9a - 2 = frac{23}{2}] [9a - frac{27}{6} - 2 = frac{23}{2}] [9a - frac{9}{2} = frac{23}{2}] [9a = frac{23}{2} + frac{9}{2}] [9a = 16] [a = frac{16}{9}] However, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation. Correcting this, when we substitute g(3) = frac{23}{2} into the equation, we should correctly solve for a: [-frac{1}{6} times 27 + 9a - 2 = frac{23}{2}] [9a - 4.5 - 2 = 11.5] [9a = 11.5 + 6.5] [9a = 18] [a = 2] Thus, the corrected profit function is: [g(x) = -frac{1}{6}x^3 + 2x^2 - 2] Taking the derivative of g(x) to find the critical points: [g'(x) = -frac{1}{2}x^2 + 4x] [g'(x) = -frac{1}{2}x(x - 8)] Analyzing the sign of g'(x), we find that for x in (0,8), g'(x) > 0, indicating that g(x) is increasing, and for x in (8,10), g'(x) < 0, indicating that g(x) is decreasing.

We are given that the cost of each trip is the product of the weight of all the goods in the vehicle by the distance traveled. Let's denote: - The distances to two specific points (M) and (N) as (m) and (n), respectively. - The weights of the goods corresponding to these two points as (m) and (n) respectively (since the weights are numerically equal to the distances). We will evaluate the cost of visiting points (M) and (N) in different orders. We start with the following approach:  1. **Calculate the cost for the order (M) followed by (N):**    - First, the vehicle travels to (M):      - Total weight in the vehicle is (m + n).      - Distance is (m).      - Cost for this trip: ((m+n) cdot m = m^{2} + mn).        - Then, from (M) to (N):      - Remaining weight in the vehicle is (n).      - Distance is (n).      - Cost for this trip: (n cdot n = n^{2}).    - Therefore, the total cost for visiting (M) followed by (N) is:      [      text{Total cost} = (m^{2} + mn) + n^{2} = m^{2} + mn + n^{2}.      ] 2. **Calculate the cost for the order (N) followed by (M):**    - First, the vehicle travels to (N):      - Total weight in the vehicle is (m + n).      - Distance is (n).      - Cost for this trip: ((m+n) cdot n = n^{2} + mn).        - Then, from (N) to (M):      - Remaining weight in the vehicle is (m).      - Distance is (m).      - Cost for this trip: (m cdot m = m^{2}).    - Therefore, the total cost for visiting (N) followed by (M) is:      [      text{Total cost} = (n^{2} + mn) + m^{2} = n^{2} + mn + m^{2}.      ] 3. **Comparing the costs:**    - Note that in both cases: (M rightarrow N) and (N rightarrow M), the total cost is the sum of (m^{2}), (n^{2}), and (mn).    - This means the total cost is the same irrespective of the order of visiting (M) and (N). To generalize this argument, observe that any two successive trips can be swapped without changing the total cost, as demonstrated: [ (m^2 + mn + n^2) = (n^2 + mn + m^2). ] Therefore, using an inductive approach, any order of visiting points can be transformed into another order by successive swaps of consecutive trips without altering the total cost. 4. **General Case for (n) points:** Consider a set of cargo points (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) representing distances. When summing the costs for all permutations: [ sum_{i=1}^n a_i left( sum_{j=i}^n a_j right), ] this results in: [ a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ldots + a_n^2 + 2 left( sum_{1leq i < j leq n} a_i a_j right). ] The expanded form: [ (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n)^2. ] is independent of the sequence as it represents the total sum squared. # Conclusion: Therefore, the total transportation cost indeed does not depend on the order in which the points are visited.

The ratio of their investments is: A : B : C = 11000 : 15000 : 23000 To simplify the ratio, we can divide each investment by the greatest common divisor of the three amounts, which is 1000 in this case: A : B : C = 11 : 15 : 23 Now, we know that B's share of the profit is 3315, which corresponds to his part of the ratio, which is 15 parts. To find the total profit, we need to calculate the value of each part by dividing B's share by 15: Value of each part = 3315 / 15 = 221 Now, we can find the total number of parts for A, B, and C combined: Total parts = 11 (A's parts) + 15 (B's parts) + 23 (C's parts) = 11 + 15 + 23 = 49 parts The total profit is the value of each part multiplied by the total number of parts: Total profit = 221 * 49 = 10829 Now that we have the total profit, we can calculate A's share based on the ratio of his investment.

Consider arranging the 2013 red points and 2014 blue points in an alternating color scheme around a circle.     - In this configuration, any two adjacent points around the circle are of different colors and must be separated by a line.    - Each line can separate at most two pairs of adjacent vertices.

This implies that all iterations ( f^n(J) ) are pairwise disjoint. 2. **Iterated Intervals:**    For any ( m, n in mathbb{N} ), consider the intervals:    [    f^{m+n}(J) cap f^m(J) = f^m(f^n(J) cap J) = f^m(emptyset) = emptyset    ]    This demonstrates that the intervals (f(J), f^2(J), ldots, f^n(J)) are pairwise disjoint. 3. **Length of Intervals:**    Each interval ( f^n(J) subset I ) is an interval (or a collection of intervals) within ( I = (0, 1] ) of total length (d).

Therefore, such intervals cannot be pairwise disjoint infinitely, meaning there must be some ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( f^n(J) cap J neq emptyset ).

Since none of these palindromes can begin with a 5 (as the range is 100 to 500), the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit. Therefore, for each choice of the first/last digit (1, 2, 3, or 4), there is exactly one palindrome that contains a 5 in the tens place. These palindromes are: - 151 - 252 - 353 - 454 This gives us a total of 4 palindromes that contain at least one 5. **Step 2: Count the total number of palindromes** To find the total number of palindromes between 100 and 500, we note that the first/last digit (which must be the same) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, giving us 4 choices. The middle digit can be anything from 0 to 9, giving us 10 choices. Therefore, the total number of palindromes is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for the first/last digit by the number of choices for the middle digit: [4 times 10 = 40] **Step 3: Calculate the percentage** The percentage of palindromes that contain at least one 5 is the number of such palindromes divided by the total number of palindromes, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage: [ frac{4}{40} times 100% = 10% ] Therefore, the percentage of palindromes between 100 and 500 that contain at least one 5 is boxed{10%}."},{"instruction":"what is the least number should be added to 1056 , so the sum of the number is completely divisible by 28 ?","output":"To find the least number that should be added to 1056 to make it completely divisible by 28, we need to find the remainder when 1056 is divided by 28.

(One dollar is 100 cents.) What is the expected value of this final sum of money, in cents? *Proposed by Lewis Chen*","output":"1. Define ( E(x) ) as the expected number of additional cents needed to get to a multiple of 100 starting from ( x ) cents. We know that ( E(100k) = 0 ) for any integer ( k ), because if we already have a multiple of 100 cents, no additional cents are needed. 2. For ( 1 leq x leq 99 ), we can write the recurrence relation for ( E(x) ) as follows:    [    E(x) = frac{1}{4} left( (E(x+1) + 1) + (E(x+5) + 5) + (E(x+10) + 10) + (E(x+25) + 25) right)    ]    This equation accounts for the fact that Richard can choose any of the four piles with equal probability, and each choice affects the expected value differently. 3.

Summing the recurrence relation from ( x = 1 ) to ( x = 99 ), we get:    [    sum_{x=1}^{99} E(x) = sum_{x=1}^{99} frac{1}{4} left( E(x+1) + E(x+5) + E(x+10) + E(x+25) + 41 right)    ] 5.

However, we need to account for the boundary conditions where ( x+1, x+5, x+10, ) or ( x+25 ) exceed 99.  6. The boundary terms can be handled by noting that ( E(100) = 0 ), ( E(101) = 0 ), etc. Thus, the sums can be approximated as:    [    sum_{x=1}^{99} E(x+1) approx S - E(99) + E(100) = S - E(99)    ]    [    sum_{x=1}^{99} E(x+5) approx S - (E(95) + E(96) + E(97) + E(98) + E(99))    ]    [    sum_{x=1}^{99} E(x+10) approx S - (E(90) + E(91) + ldots + E(99))    ]    [    sum_{x=1}^{99} E(x+25) approx S - (E(75) + E(76) + ldots + E(99))    ] 7. Combining these, we get:    [    99S = frac{1}{4} left( 4S - text{boundary terms} + 41 times 99 right)    ] 8. Simplifying, we find:    [    99S = S - text{boundary terms} + 41 times 99    ] 9.

Five of them are respectively 2, 6, 8, 12, and 14 years older than the youngest, and the age of each child is a prime number. How old is the youngest child?","output":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of the youngest child in a family where there are six children, five of whom are older than the youngest by 2, 6, 8, 12, and 14 years, respectively. Additionally, the age of each child is a prime number. We approach this problem step-by-step. 1. **Define Variables:**    Let ( x ) be the age of the youngest child. The ages of the other children will then be ( x+2, x+6, x+8, x+12, ) and ( x+14 ). 2. **Prime Numbers Constraint:**    Since all children's ages are prime numbers, we need to ensure that ( x ) and all values of ( x ) plus the differences are prime. 3. **Possible Ages of Youngest:**    We consider that the youngest child's age ( x ) must be such that ( y = x + k ) where ( k ) belongs to the set ({2, 6, 8, 12, 14}) are all prime.     4. **Modulus Analysis:**    Analyze the differences modulo 5:    - (2 equiv 2 pmod{5})    - (6 equiv 1 pmod{5})    - (8 equiv 3 pmod{5})    - (12 equiv 2 pmod{5})    - (14 equiv 4 pmod{5})    Note that the remainders are 2, 1, 3, 2, and 4. 5. **Checking the Youngest Age:**    If ( x ) were divisible by 5, then it would make ( x + 2 ), ( x + 6 ), ( x + 8 ), ( x + 12 ), or ( x + 14 ) divisible by 5 (unless one of them is 5 itself). Since 5 is prime, we include it in the set.    - We need to check if any configuration of ( x ) along with the added values results in all primes. 6. **Testing with Prime Numbers Less than 10:**    Start with prime numbers ( x ):    - If ( x = 2 ); (x + 2 = 4 ) (not prime)    - If ( x = 3 ); (x + 2 = 5 rightarrow 3, 5 + 3 rightarrow 11, {13, 19, 25 } )      Clearly, 25 is not prime.    - If ( x = 5 ); then       (x + 2 = 7 rightarrow, x + 6 = 11 rightarrow )      After check carefully primes less than 10 and their sets: 7. **Conclusion after intersection between primes:**     After verifying the steps, there exists complex configuration.     Thus the valid configuration leading : ( x = 5)    - (x + 2 = 7)    - (x + 6 = 11)    - (x + 8 = 13)    - (x + 12 = 17 )    - (x + 14 = 19).

A certain store purchased a certain type of Asian Games mascot at a price of 35 yuan each and sold them at a price of 58 yuan each. According to statistics, the sales volume in April was 256 units, and in June it was 400 units.   (1) Calculate the monthly average growth rate of the sales volume of this mascot from April to June.   (2) According to market forecasts, the sales volume in July will be the same as in June. Now, in order to reduce inventory, the store is using a discount promotion method.

The formula to calculate the sales volume in June, given the sales volume in April and the growth rate, is 256(1+m)^2. Given that the sales volume in June is 400 units, we set up the equation: [256(1+m)^2 = 400] Solving for m, we get: [(1+m)^2 = frac{400}{256} = frac{25}{16}] [1+m = pmsqrt{frac{25}{16}}] [m = pmfrac{5}{4} - 1] We find two possible values for m: m_1 = 0.25 and m_2 = -2.25. Since a negative growth rate does not match the context of the problem, we discard m_2. Therefore, the monthly average growth rate of the sales volume from April to June is: [boxed{25%}]  Part 2: Optimal Selling Price for Desired Profit Let the selling price of the mascot be y yuan. The profit per unit would then be (y-35) yuan. According to the given information, for every 1 yuan reduction in price, the monthly sales volume increases by 20 units. Therefore, if the price is reduced from 58 yuan to y yuan, the increase in sales volume is 20(58-y) units. Given that the sales volume in June (and predicted for July) is 400 units, the total sales volume after the price adjustment is 400 + 20(58-y) = 1560 - 20y units. The total profit is given by the product of profit per unit and the total sales volume, which should equal 8400 yuan. Therefore, we have: [(y-35)(1560-20y) = 8400] Expanding and simplifying the equation, we find the values of y that satisfy it. Solving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for y: y_1 = 50 and y_2 = 63. Since y_2 = 63 does not align with the context of reducing the price for increased sales, we discard it.

To find the tangent at x = 1, calculate the derivative:    f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 4 quad (x > 0).    Therefore, at x=1, we have:    f(1) = ln(1) - 4 times 1 = -4,    f'(1) = frac{1}{1} - 4 = -3.    Using the point-slope form of a line, the equation of the tangent line is y - (-4) = -3(x - 1), which simplifies to:    boxed{3x + y + 1 = 0}. 2. The inequality f(x) leq 2 gives us ln x - 2ax leq 2. Rearranging terms, we get 2ax geq ln x - 2.    Let varphi(x) = frac{ln x - 2}{x} (for x > 0), so that 2a geq varphi(x) holds true for the inequality to hold. To find the maximum of varphi(x), we differentiate it:    varphi'(x) = frac{3 - ln x}{x^2}.    For 0 < x < e^3, varphi'(x) > 0 and varphi(x) is increasing. For x > e^3, varphi'(x) < 0 and varphi(x) is decreasing. Thus, varphi(x) achieves its maximum at x = e^3, and we have varphi_{max}(x) = varphi(e^3) = frac{1}{e^3}.    Therefore, it must be that 2a geq frac{1}{e^3}, which implies a geq frac{1}{2e^3}. Hence, the range of a is:    boxed{a in left[frac{1}{2e^3}, +inftyright)}. 3. For the proof, we have g(x) = f(x) + frac{1}{2}x^2 = ln x - 2ax + frac{1}{2}x^2. The derivative g'(x) is:    g'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 2a + x.    For -1 leq a leq 1, g'(x) geq 0 and g(x) is increasing, which does not fit the criteria since g(x) should have a local maximum. When a > 1 or a < -1, set g'(x) = 0 and let the roots of x^2 - 2ax + 1 = 0 be x_0 and x'. Since x_0 is a local maximum, we have 0 < x_0 < x' and x_0 cdot x' = 1 and x_0 + x' = 2a > 0. This implies a > 1 and 0 < x_0 < 1. From g'(x_0) = x_0 + frac{1}{x_0} - 2a = 0, we get:    a = frac{x_0^2 + 1}{2x_0}.    Evaluate x_0f(x_0) + 1 + ax_0^2 = x_0 ln x_0 - 2ax_0^2 + frac{1}{2}x_0^2 + 1.

Using a substitution μ(x) = ln x - frac{3}{2}x^2 + frac{1}{2} and calculating its derivative yields μ'(x) = frac{1 - 3x^2}{x}. This derivative is positive for 0 < x < frac{sqrt{3}}{3} and negative for frac{sqrt{3}}{3} < x < 1. Hence, μ(x) has a maximum mu left(frac{sqrt{3}}{3} right) < 0, which means h'(x) < 0 in (0, 1).

There is no property that allows us to combine square roots in addition directly without simplifying them first. Therefore, we cannot say: sqrt{2} + sqrt{3} = sqrt{5} This means the calculation in option C is incorrect because sqrt{2} + sqrt{3} does not simplify to sqrt{5} without further context or operations. **Option D:** For option D, we have: (-sqrt{2})^2 Squaring a square root, especially with a negative sign inside the square, gives us: = (-sqrt{2}) times (-sqrt{2}) = 2 This is because the square of a negative number is positive, and the square of the square root of a number is the number itself.

Since there are 7 boys and 13 girls, the probability of picking a boy first is frac{7}{20}. After picking a boy, we have 19 people left, with 13 of them being girls. So, the probability of then picking a girl is frac{13}{19}. Multiplying these probabilities gives us the chance of a boy-girl pair: frac{7}{20} cdot frac{13}{19}.    - Similarly, the probability of having a girl on the left and a boy on the right is calculated in the same way, and it also equals frac{7}{20} cdot frac{13}{19}. 2. **Combine the Probabilities:**    - Since either a boy-girl or a girl-boy pair satisfies our condition for S, we add the probabilities together: frac{7cdot 13}{20cdot 19} + frac{7cdot 13}{20cdot 19} = 2 cdot frac{7cdot 13}{20cdot 19} = frac{91}{190}. 3. **Apply Linearity of Expectation Across All Adjacent Pairs:**    - There are 19 pairs of adjacent people in a line of 20.

Then (angle B ) satisfies ( 60^circ leq angle B < 90^circ ). 3. Since the bisectors of angles (A) and (C) are less than 1, the heights from vertices (A) and (C), denoted ( h_A ) and ( h_C ), must also be less than 1.    - This follows since the angle bisector of an acute triangle splits the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides and also because the height is a specific perpendicular segment from the vertex to the opposite side. 4. The area of triangle ( ABC ) can be expressed in terms of its heights:    [    S_{ABC} = frac{1}{2} times h_A times BC times sin A = frac{1}{2} times h_C times AB times sin C     ]    - Here, our goal is to compare this with ( frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ). 5.

Then there is some path     [    v_0 - v_1 - v_2 - dots - v_{2k+1}    ]    where ( v_0, v_{2k+1} in mathcal{I} ), but ( v_1v_2, v_3v_4, dots, v_{2k-1}v_{2k} ) are edges in ( mathcal{M} ). 6. **Increasing the Matching:**    We could then increase the size of the matching by taking ( v_0v_1, v_2v_3, v_4v_5, dots, v_{2k}v_{2k+1} ) instead of the edges ( v_1v_2, v_3v_4, dots, v_{2k-1}v_{2k} ). This contradicts the maximality of ( mathcal{M} ). 7. **Conclusion:**    Since Ben can never move into ( mathcal{I} ), Anna always has a move. The game must terminate, and since Anna cannot lose, it follows that Anna has a winning strategy. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"A pump can fill a tank with water in 2 hours. Because of a leak, it took 2 1/7 hours to fill the tank. The leak can drain all the water of the tank in how many hours?","output":"Let's denote the rate at which the pump fills the tank as P (in tanks per hour) and the rate at which the leak empties the tank as L (in tanks per hour). We know that the pump can fill the tank in 2 hours, so its rate is: P = 1 tank / 2 hours = 1/2 tank per hour When the leak is also present, it takes 2 1/7 hours to fill the tank. This is 2 + 1/7 = 14/7 + 1/7 = 15/7 hours. The combined rate of the pump filling and the leak draining is: 1 tank / (15/7 hours) = 7/15 tank per hour Now, we can set up an equation where the combined rate of the pump and the leak equals the rate of the pump minus the rate of the leak: P - L = 7/15 Substitute the value of P we found earlier: 1/2 - L = 7/15 To find L, we solve for L: L = 1/2 - 7/15 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 30: L = (15/30) - (14/30) L = 1/30 tank per hour This means the leak drains 1/30 of the tank per hour. To find out how many hours it takes for the leak to drain the entire tank, we take the reciprocal of the rate: Time = 1 / L Time = 1 / (1/30) Time = 30 hours So, the leak can drain all the water of the tank in boxed{30}  hours."},{"instruction":"A certain car manufacturer randomly selected 6 tires from two types of tires, A and B, for testing.

Here, the mode is 99. - Similarly, for type B tires with distances 95, 95, 98, 99, 104, 109, the mode is 95. - Comparing these, we find that 99 > 95, which means the mode of the maximum distance for type A tires is indeed greater than that for type B tires. **For Statement C:** - The mean of the maximum distance for type A tires is calculated as the sum of all distances divided by the number of distances. This can be simplified by observing that the distances can be represented as deviations from 100, leading to the calculation 100 + frac{-6 - 4 - 1 - 1 + 5 + 7}{6} = 100. - For type B tires, the mean is similarly calculated as 100 + frac{-5 - 5 - 2 - 1 + 4 + 9}{6} = 100. - Since both means are 100, statement C is incorrect as it claims one mean is greater than the other. **For Statement B:** - The range of the maximum distance for type A tires is found by subtracting the smallest distance from the largest, which is 107 - 94 = 13. - For type B tires, the range is 109 - 95 = 14. - Since 14 > 13, the range of the maximum distance for type B tires is indeed greater than that for type A tires, making statement B correct. **For Statement D:** - The variance for type A tires is calculated as frac{{(94-100)^2 + (96-100)^2 + (99-100)^2 times 2 + (105-100)^2 + (107-100)^2}}{6} = frac{64}{3}. - For type B tires, the variance is frac{{(95-100)^2 times 2 + (98-100)^2 + (99-100)^2 + (104-100)^2 + (109-100)^2}}{6} = frac{76}{3}. - Since frac{64}{3} < frac{76}{3}, type A tires have a lower variance, indicating more stable performance compared to type B tires.

This gives us: [ f(x) = sin^4 x + cos^2 x = sin^4 x + (1 - sin^2 x). ] Expanding and simplifying this expression, we get: [ f(x) = sin^4 x + 1 - sin^2 x = (sin^2 x)^2 - sin^2 x + 1. ] To make this expression easier to analyze, we can complete the square for sin^2 x. Completing the square involves finding a value that, when added and subtracted, makes the quadratic in sin^2 x a perfect square trinomial. The quadratic term is sin^4 x, the linear term is -sin^2 x, and the constant term is 1. The coefficient of the linear term is -1, so we add and subtract (frac{-1}{2})^2 = frac{1}{4} inside the expression: [ f(x) = (sin^2 x)^2 - sin^2 x + 1 = left( sin^2 x - frac{1}{2} right)^2 + frac{3}{4}. ] This transformation is valid because we've simply rearranged the expression without changing its value. Now, we observe that left( sin^2 x - frac{1}{2} right)^2 is a square term, so its smallest value is 0 (when sin^2 x = frac{1}{2}), and it increases as sin^2 x moves away from frac{1}{2}.

Since the shopkeeper incurred a loss of Rs. 5 per meter, this means that the selling price is Rs. 5 less than the cost price for each meter of cloth. Let's denote the cost price for one meter of cloth as \\"C.\\" The selling price for one meter of cloth is therefore C - 5. The shopkeeper sold 450 meters of cloth for Rs. 18,000, so the selling price for one meter of cloth is 18000 / 450 = Rs. 40.

Since (A) and (B) lie on a circle with radius (r),     [     sqrt{x^2 + 0^2} = r implies x = r     ]     Similarly for points (C) and (D),     [     sqrt{0^2 + y^2} = r implies y = r     ] 3. **Calculations:**     Using the coordinates:     - The distance (AC) is given by:     [     AC = sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2} = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}     ]     - Similarly, the distance (BD) is:     [     BD = sqrt{(-x - 0)^2 + (0 - (-y))^2} = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}     ] 4. **Summing Areas:**     - Therefore, (AC^2) and (BD^2) are:     [     AC^2 = x^2 + y^2     ]     [     BD^2 = x^2 + y^2     ]     Adding these together, we get:     [     AC^2 + BD^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + (x^2 + y^2) = 2(x^2 + y^2)     ] 5. **Substituting in Radius:**     - Recall that (x = y = r = frac{d}{2}), thus:     [     AC^2 + BD^2 = 2left(r^2 + r^2right) = 2left(left(frac{d}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{d}{2}right)^2right)     ]     [     = 2left(frac{d^2}{4} + frac{d^2}{4}right) = 2 left(frac{2d^2}{4}right) = 2 left(frac{d^2}{2}right) = d^2     ] 6. **Conclusion:**     Therefore, we have shown that (AC^2 + BD^2 = d^2):     [     boxed{d^2}     ]"},{"instruction":"To make the polynomial left(xmright)left(xnright) not contain a linear term in x, then () A: m+n=0 B: mn=1 C: m=n D: mn=1","output":"To solve the problem, we start by expanding the given polynomial: [ begin{align*} left(x-mright)left(x-nright) &= x^2 - nx - mx + mn  &= x^2 - (n + m)x + mn. end{align*} ] For the polynomial left(x-mright)left(x-nright) to not contain a linear term in x, the coefficient of the x term must be equal to 0.

Under this transformation, the conic w is mapped to another conic that does not intersect the line at infinity. This implies that w is transformed into an ellipse. 2. **Affine Transformation**: Next, apply an affine transformation to map the ellipse to a circle. This is possible because any ellipse can be transformed into a circle via an affine transformation. Thus, it suffices to prove the statement for w being a circle and A and B being points at infinity. 3. **Lines at Infinity**: Let ell_A and ell_B be two lines that pass through the points at infinity A and B, respectively. These lines are parallel to each other. 4. **Sequence Definition**: Define the sequence P_0, P_1, ldots on the circle w such that P_{n+1} is the second intersection of the line passing through B and the second intersection of the line AP_n with w. 5. **Parallel Lines**: Let Q_i be the point on w such that Q_iP_i parallel ell_A. This means that Q_iP_{i+1} parallel ell_B. Since ell_A and ell_B are parallel lines at infinity, the angle between Q_iP_i and Q_iP_{i+1} is constant. 6. **Rotation**: The angle angle (P_iQ_i, P_{i+1}Q_i) = angle (ell_A, ell_B) = alpha is constant. This implies that P_{i+1} is obtained from P_i by a rotation of beta = 2alpha around the center of the circle w. 7. **Periodic Sequence**: For P_0 = P_k to hold, the rotation angle beta must satisfy kbeta = 2npi for some integer n. This means that the sequence P_0, P_1, ldots is periodic with period k. 8. **Conclusion**: Since the rotation angle beta is constant and independent of the initial point P_0, if P_0 = P_k for some choice of P_0, then P_0 = P_k for any choice of P_0.

What is the case with two quadrilaterals?","output":"Let's prove that if one of two convex polygons contains the other inside it, then the inner polygon has a smaller perimeter.  Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Selection of sides:**    - Consider an arbitrary side of the inner convex polygon.    - The line containing this side divides the outer polygon into two parts, one of which contains the entire inner polygon.  2. **Convex property usage:**    - This step leverages the convex property of the inner polygon, which guarantees that any polygonal side’s line divides the plane into two half-planes, one containing the entire polygon. 3. **Perimeter division:**    - Each part of the outer polygon created by this division has a perimeter smaller than the original outer polygon's perimeter.    - To illustrate, denote points ( X ) and ( Y ) where the line intersects the outer polygon. The broken line cutting through ( X ) and ( Y ) can be replaced by the segment ( XY ), thereby reducing the overall perimeter of each divided part of the polygon. 4. **Iteration process:**    - Repeat this process with the new outer polygon and the remaining sides of the original inner polygon.    - Through a finite number of steps, we continue to reduce the perimeter of the outer polygon until it essentially encompasses the inner polygon while progressively reducing in perimeter. 5. **Conclusion:**    - Since each division step decreases the perimeter of the outer polygon, eventually, the inner polygon's perimeter remains smaller than or equal to the perimeter of the reduced outer polygon. 6. **Observation for triangles:**    - Applying this to triangles specifically: Since all triangles are convex, this statement holds true unconditionally for any pair of triangles. 7. **Application to quadrilaterals:**    - For quadrilaterals, the condition hinges on the convexity of the innermost polygon.    - If the inner quadrilateral is convex, then the perimeter relationship holds.    - However, if the inner quadrilateral is concave, counterexamples exist where the inner quadrilateral might have a larger perimeter. # Conclusion: Thus, for triangles, the statement is always true because triangles are inherently convex.

The train is moving at 24 km/hr, and the man is running at 6 km/hr in the opposite direction. When two objects are moving in opposite directions, their relative speeds are added together. Therefore, the relative speed between the train and the man is: Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 24 km/hr + 6 km/hr Relative speed = 30 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We use the conversion factor that 1 km/hr is equivalent to 5/18 m/s. Relative speed in m/s = 30 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed in m/s = (30 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed in m/s = (5 * 5/3) m/s Relative speed in m/s = 25/3 m/s Now, we have the relative speed in meters per second and the time in seconds.

We find the derivative, discuss it in different cases, and obtain b geqslant -ln(a) + a + 2. Thus, frac{b}{a} geqslant frac{-ln(a) + a + 2}{a}. By finding the derivative, we determine the monotonic intervals and the extreme values, which leads us to the minimum value of frac{b}{a}. Solution Steps: 1. Let y = ln(x + 1) - ax - b - 1. Then, the derivative y' = frac{1}{x + 1} - a. 2. If a leqslant 0, then y' > 0 holds true, and the function is increasing for x > -1 with no maximum value. 3. If a > 0, then solving y' = 0 gives us x = frac{1 - a}{a}.    - For -1 < x < frac{1 - a}{a}, y' > 0 and the function is increasing.    - For x > frac{1 - a}{a}, y' < 0 and the function is decreasing. 4. The function attains its maximum value at x = frac{1 - a}{a}, which is -ln(a) + a - b - 2. 5. Therefore, -ln(a) + a - b - 2 leqslant 0, which implies b geqslant -ln(a) + a - 2. 6. Consequently, frac{b}{a} geqslant 1 - frac{ln(a)}{a} - frac{2}{a}. 7. Let t = 1 - frac{ln(a)}{a} - frac{2}{a}. The derivative t' = frac{1 + ln(a)}{a^2}. 8. For (0, e^{-1}), t' < 0; for (e^{-1}, +infty), t' > 0. 9. Thus, the minimum value of t is attained at a = e^{-1}, which is t_{text{min}} = 1 - e. 10.

The rearrangement is to be done by swapping letters in the following two ways: I. mode: only adjacent letters can be swapped. II. mode: any distant letters can be swapped. How many swaps are needed for each rearrangement mode? (After the swap, both letters must be placed in the other's position, and a new swap can only occur afterward.)","output":"**First mode: Only adjacent letters can be swapped.** 1. We begin by noting that the least number of swaps can be achieved if multiples of the same letter are moved together without changing their order. For example, for the original text \\"MEGYEI TAKARÉKPÉNZTÁR R. T.\\", the letter E_{1} should move to the first É in \\"TATÁR GYERMEK A PÉNZT KÉRI\\" and so on, in order to avoid unnecessary swaps. 2. Next, we visualize the necessary swaps using arrows to represent the movement of letters and times to represent letters that stay in place. For instance, if P remains in the same position, it is denoted by times. Each movement requires crossings, and the number of crossings each letter's path makes across the vertical lines separating letters shows the number of needed swaps. 3. Indicating the letter movements with arrows, we see that letters incur more swaps if their paths cross many vertical separators between adjacent positions. Summing all these crossings, we find that it amounts to 63 swaps. 4. Some movements might not be perfectly efficient. For instance, if M and E_{1} swap, M moves correctly, but E_{1} has to retract and make an additional swap later, adding extra steps. 5. Similarly, letter G and Y moving right will need extra swaps when other letters like M and E_{1} cross their paths. This adds up to extra swaps such that: 6. Finally summing all required swaps:     - Basic swaps: 63     - Additional swaps for adjustments: 12     - Adjustments due to fixed positions needing swaps: 10    Total swaps = 63 + 12 + 10 = 85. **Conclusion for mode I:** [ boxed{85} ] **Second mode: Letters can be swapped with any other letter.** 1. In this mode, we can consider the most efficient swaps. We note that if we can place two specific letters in their correct positions immediately, fewer further swaps are needed.  2. Each of the remaining 16 letters needs to be placed in their final positions. Analyzing cycles (circular swaps), where a series of swaps lead each letter to its correct place finally in the least number of swaps, is crucial. 3. Each cycle involves swapping letters not necessarily adjacent, thereby achieving a large displacement in fewer moves. For instance:    - One cycle might consist of A_{1}, E_{1}, E_{2}, etc, taking multiple letters to their correct new positions in each step.    - If the cycles consist of small groups (e.g., 3 letters), the total number of swaps reduces greatly. 4. After computing all such necessary swaps (using either specific pair swaps or cycles), we find a total number of cycles necessary to place all letters correctly, and hence, counts as a smaller number of swaps overall: 5. Total necessary swaps:     - 5 distinct cycles as planned, each minimally efficient ensures that the total swaps for this mode sum up to 11. **Conclusion for mode II:** [ boxed{11} ] Overall, the solution requires analyzing the optimal number of necessary swaps for both modes.

We stop adding when adding another weight to either group would exceed 1  mathrm{lb}. 5. **Maximum Weights on the Scale:**    - Let's denote the sum of the weights in the first group as W_1 and in the second group as W_2.    - Since both W_1 and W_2 must be less than or equal to 1  mathrm{lb}, we have:      [      W_1 leq 1  mathrm{lb} quad text{and} quad W_2 leq 1  mathrm{lb}      ] 6. **Including the Remaining Weight:**    - After we have distributed the weights such that both W_1 and W_2 are as close to 1  mathrm{lb} as possible but do not exceed it, there can be at most one remaining weight.    - Since each individual weight is not heavier than 1  mathrm{lb}, if there is one more weight left, its maximum weight would also be 1  mathrm{lb}. 7. **Calculating the Total Maximum Weight:**    - The total maximum weight, therefore, consists of W_1, W_2, and the potential remaining weight.    - So the total maximum possible weight is:       [      W_1 + W_2 + (text{remaining weight})      ] 8. **Summarizing the Total Weight:**    - Both W_1 and W_2 can be at most 1  mathrm{lb} each, and the remaining weight can be at most 1  mathrm{lb}.    - Therefore, the total maximum weight is:      [      W_1 + W_2 + 1  mathrm{lb} leq 1  mathrm{lb} + 1  mathrm{lb} + 1  mathrm{lb} = 3  mathrm{lb}      ] 9. **Verifying the Maximum Case:**    - We can achieve exactly 3  mathrm{lb} by considering three weights each exactly 1  mathrm{lb}.    - We would place 1  mathrm{lb} in the first group, 1  mathrm{lb} in the second group, and have 1  mathrm{lb} remaining. 10. **Conclusion:**     - The maximum possible total weight of these weights, under given constraints, is:       [       boxed{3  mathrm{lb}}       ]"},{"instruction":"During the high school quality inspection test in January 2015 in a certain city, the mathematics scores of science students followed a normal distribution N(98, 10^2).

First, we convert the score 108 to the standard normal distribution Z by calculating the z-score: Z = frac{108 - mu}{sigma} = frac{108 - 98}{10} = 1. Now, using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability P(Z < 1), which is the cumulative distribution function Phi(1). P(xi geq 108) = 1 - Phi(1) approx 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587. This means that approximately 15.87% of students scored above 108 points. To find the rank of the student, we calculate the approximate number of students who scored less than this student: 9450 times (1 - 0.1587) = 9450 times 0.8413 approx 7948.

This means that they can be superimposed onto one another through rotations, translations, or reflections.    - Two geometric figures are called similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are in proportion. 2. **Equivalence and Independence of Concepts:**    - **Equivalence (Congruence):** The concept of congruence indicates that two figures are both equivalent and similar with a scale factor of 1, meaning they are identical in shape and size.    - **Similarity:** The concept of similarity involves the idea that two figures have the same shape but differ in size. They are equivalent up to a scaling factor, which is not necessarily 1. 3. **Relation Between The Concepts:**    - Two figures can be equivalent (congruent) and not similar only by definition misinterpretation, as congruent figures are a subset of similar figures with a scale factor of 1.    - Two figures can be similar and not equivalent (not congruent) since similarity only requires that the shapes are identical but can differ by a scaling factor.    - Two figures can be both equivalent (congruent) and similar. When two figures are both equivalent and similar with a scale factor of 1, they are congruent. 4. **Logical Conclusion:**    - The set of properties encompassing equivalence (congruence) and similarity is equal to the concept of congruence.

Conversely, from the property of congruence of figures, it follows that they are both equivalent (congruent) and similar with a scaling factor of 1. # Conclusion: The concepts of equivalence (congruence) and similarity between two geometric figures are interrelated such that congruence implies both equivalence and similarity with a specific condition, while similarity does not necessarily mean congruence unless the scale factor is 1. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Let f be a real function defined for all real x, with the following property:  f(x+a)=frac{1}{2}+sqrt{f(x)[f(x)]^{2}}  where a is a given positive number.

Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the man from the speed of the train to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of man Relative speed = 63 km/hr - 3 km/hr Relative speed = 60 km/hr Now, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s because the time is given in seconds and we want the length in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s So, the relative speed in m/s is: Relative speed = 60 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = 60 * 5/18 m/s Relative speed = 300/18 m/s Relative speed = 50/3 m/s Now we have the relative speed in m/s and the time in seconds.

This is given by the problem statement, indicating that C is equidistant from E and D. Since |FC|+|CE|=|FE|=4sqrt{2}, we can replace |CE| with |CD| to get |FC|+|CD|=4sqrt{2}. We also know that |FD|=2sqrt{6}, which is the distance from F to D. Therefore, we have |FC|+|CD|> |FD|, indicating that point C lies on an ellipse with foci at F and D. Given that |FE|=4sqrt{2}, we can deduce that the major axis length 2a=4sqrt{2}, so a=2sqrt{2}. The distance between the foci, 2c, is given by the distance from F to D, which is 2sqrt{6}, so c=sqrt{6}. The length of the semi-minor axis b can be found using the formula b^2=a^2-c^2. Substituting the values of a and c, we get b^2=(2sqrt{2})^2-(sqrt{6})^2=8-6=2. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse, which is the locus of point C, is frac{x^2}{8}+frac{y^2}{2}=1. **(2)** For the second part, we start by identifying the coordinates of points A and B. Point A is given as (2,1), and point B is symmetric to A with respect to the origin O, so B has coordinates (-2,-1). The slope of line AB is calculated as k_{AB}=frac{1-(-1)}{2-(-2)}=frac{1}{2}. Let the points M and N on the locus of point C have coordinates M(x_1,y_1) and N(x_2,y_2), respectively. The line l parallel to AB has the equation y=frac{1}{2}x+m, where m is the y-intercept and is not equal to 0. By substituting y from the equation of line l into the equation of the ellipse, we get x^2+2mx+2m^2-4=0. The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation must be greater than 0 for the line to intersect the ellipse at two distinct points, which gives us 4m^2-4(2m^2-4)>0. Solving this inequality, we find that -2<m<2 and mneq 0. The sum and product of the roots of the quadratic equation give us {x_1}+{x_2}=-2m and {x_1}{x_2}=2{m^2}-4, respectively. Using these, we find that {y_1}+{y_2}=frac{1}{2}({x_1}+{x_2})+2m=m. Therefore, the midpoint Q of segment MN has coordinates Qleft(-m,frac{m}{2}right). The slopes of lines AM and BN are calculated using the coordinates of M and N. By setting up the equations of lines AM and BN and solving them, we find the coordinates of point P. The slope of line OP is found to be -frac{1}{2}, which matches the slope of line OQ. This means that O, P, and Q are collinear, and thus line OP bisects segment MN.

Use the difference of squares on the right-hand side:    [    p^{n} = (m - 12)(m + 12)    ] 4. Since (p) is a prime number, both factors ((m-12)) and ((m+12)) must be powers of (p). Let:    [    m - 12 = p^{alpha} quad text{and} quad m + 12 = p^{beta}    ]    with (beta > alpha geq 0) and (alpha + beta = n). 5. Subtract the first equation from the second:    [    p^{beta} - p^{alpha} = 24    ]    Hence, (p) must divide 24. The prime factors of 24 are 2 and 3. Therefore, (p) can be either 2 or 3. 6. **Case 1:** (p = 2)    [    2^{beta} - 2^{alpha} = 24    ]    Factor out (2^{alpha}) from the left-hand side:    [    2^{alpha}(2^{beta - alpha} - 1) = 24    ]    The factors of 24 are (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24). Thus, the term (2^{beta - alpha} - 1) must also be one of these factors. Let's test possible values for (beta - alpha):    - When (beta - alpha = 3):      [      2^{3} - 1 = 7 rightarrow 2^{alpha} cdot 7 = 24 rightarrow 2^{alpha} = 8 rightarrow alpha = 3      ]      Then (beta = alpha + 3 = 6) and (alpha + beta = 9 rightarrow n = 9).

Therefore, a_n + 1 = 2(a_{n-2} + 1), which implies a_n + 1 = 2^{ left( frac{n-1}{2} right) + 1} = 2^{ frac{n+1}{2} }. So we get a_n = 2^{ frac{n+1}{2} } - 1. Since 254 must be equal to one of the terms in the sequence, and it cannot be the result of an odd term in sequence (based on the pattern we see that odd terms will give odd results), we consider the case for even n, where the sequence doubles the previous term. For n being an odd integer, we already derived a_n = 2^{ frac{n+1}{2} } - 1. We need to find n such that 254 = 2 left( 2^{ frac{n+1}{2} } - 1 right). Dividing both sides by 2, 127 = 2^{ frac{n+1}{2} } - 1. Adding 1 to both sides, we have 128 = 2^{ frac{n+1}{2} }. Since 128 = 2^7 = 2^{ frac{14}{2} }, it follows that frac{n+1}{2} = 7. We solve for n and get n + 1 = 14, thus n = 13.  Remembering that for every odd n there is an even n+1 corresponding to a_{n+1}, we conclude that 254 corresponds to the term after the 13th term, which is the 14th term of the sequence. boxed{text{Hence, the correct answer is A: 14th term.}}"},{"instruction":"Using syllogistic reasoning: The square of any real number is greater than (0), since (a) is a real number, therefore (a^{2} > 0), do you think this reasoning is A: Major premise is wrong B: Minor premise is wrong C: The form of reasoning is wrong D: Correc","output":"Since the square of any real number is said to be greater than (0), and because (a) is a real number, it follows that (a^{2} > 0),   Major premise: The statement that the square of any real number is greater than (0) is incorrect, as the square of (0) is not greater than (0).

Let P be the position of the planet Zeta after it has completed one-fourth of its orbit starting from A. The major axis length AB = 3 + 15 = 18 AU. The semi-major axis a = frac{18}{2} = 9 AU. The distance c from the center O to the focus F (where the star is located) can be calculated since c^2 = a^2 - b^2, where b is the semi-minor axis. Using the ellipse property, at perigee AF = a - c = 3 AU, thus c = a - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6 AU. Using another property of the ellipse, the distance from any point on the ellipse to the two foci sum up to the major axis length. Thus, at one-fourth of the orbit, suppose P is such that PF + PA = 18 AU. Given that A is on the major axis and P approaches the star, assume a reasonable position for P nearer to A. We also know from symmetry and equal area sweep (Kepler's laws) that PF should be less than halfway of total major axis: PF < frac{18}{2} = 9 AU.

First, we recognize that the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean. Since the mean score is 85, the probabilities on either side of the mean are equal. The probability that a score falls between 80 and 90 is given as 0.3. This probability covers the area from 80 to 90, which is symmetrically positioned around the mean. To find the probability that a score is not less than 90, we look at the upper tail of the distribution starting from 90.

We start by noting that ( p, q, r, s ) are prime numbers such that ( 5 < p < q < r < s < p + 10 ).     2. Since ( p > 5 ), all four primes are odd. Hence, their sum ( p + q + r + s ) is even. Moreover, none of these primes can end in the digit 5 because any number greater than 5 ending in 5 is not a prime number (as it would be divisible by 5). 3. This implies that among the possible units digits (1, 3, 7, 9) for these primes, each digit must appear exactly once in ( p, q, r, s ). Therefore, the sum of these units digits ( 1 + 3 + 7 + 9 = 20 ), which has a units digit of 0. Thus, we have:    [    p + q + r + s equiv 0 pmod{10}    ] 4. We now consider the arrangement of the units digits in more detail. Suppose ( p, q, r, s ) have the units digits 1, 3, 7, 9 in some order.  5. Let's examine the possible cases based on the units digit of ( p ):     - **Case 1:** If ( p ) has units digit 3 (then ( q ) has units digit 7, ( r ) has units digit 9, and ( s ) has units digit 1). The numbers ( q, r, s ) form three consecutive odd numbers; at least one of them must be divisible by 3, which contradicts their primality.     - **Case 2:** If ( p ) has units digit 7 (then ( q ) has units digit 9 and ( r ) has units digit 1, and ( s ) has units digit 3). Again, among ( p, q, r ) there is at least one number divisible by 3, a contradiction.     - **Case 3:** If ( p ) has units digit 9, then ( q ) has units digit 1 and ( r ) has units digit 3, and ( s ) has units digit 7. The sequence ( p, q, r ) includes a number divisible by 3, which contradicts their primality.     - **Case 4:** The only remaining valid combination is if ( p, q, r, s ) have the units digits 1, 3, 7, 9 in that order.  6. Due to this arrangement and since ( s < p + 10 ), the numbers must be specifically structured such that the middle value ( m = frac{p + 4 + q + 2 + r - 2 + s - 4}{4} ), leading ( m = p + 4 ) or ( q + 2 ) or ( r - 2 ) or ( s - 4 ) would be divisible by 3 and 5. So    [    m equiv 0 pmod{15}    ] 7.

C invested thrice the amount of A after 8 months, which means C invested 3x, but only for the remaining 4 months of the year. The profit share is directly proportional to the product of the investment amount and the time period for which the money was invested. So, the profit shares for A, B, and C can be calculated as follows: A's share = x * 12 (since A invested for the entire year) B's share = 2x * 6 (since B invested for half the year) C's share = 3x * 4 (since C invested for one-third of the year) Now, let's calculate the ratio of their investments: A's investment ratio = x * 12 = 12x B's investment ratio = 2x * 6 = 12x C's investment ratio = 3x * 4 = 12x The total investment ratio is the sum of A's, B's, and C's investment ratios: Total investment ratio = 12x + 12x + 12x = 36x Now, we can calculate A's share of the annual gain: A's share of the gain = (A's investment ratio / Total investment ratio) * Total gain A's share of the gain = (12x / 36x) * Rs. 21,000 A's share of the gain = (1/3) * Rs. 21,000 A's share of the gain = Rs. 7,000 Therefore, A's share of the annual gain is Rs. boxed{7,000} ."},{"instruction":"when a student joe , weighing 43 kg , joins a group of students whose average weight is 30 kg , the average weight goes up by 1 kg . subsequently , if two students , excluding joe , leave the group the average weight comes back to 30 kg . what is the difference between the average weight of the two students who left and the weight of joe ?","output":"Let's denote the number of students in the original group (before Joe joined) as n.

The new average weight after Joe joins is 31 kg. So we can write the equation: (30n + 43) / (n + 1) = 31 Multiplying both sides by (n + 1) gives us: 30n + 43 = 31(n + 1) Expanding the right side: 30n + 43 = 31n + 31 Subtracting 30n from both sides: 43 = n + 31 Subtracting 31 from both sides: n = 43 - 31 n = 12 So there were originally 12 students in the group. Now, when two students leave the group (excluding Joe), the number of students becomes n + 1 - 2 = 12 + 1 - 2 = 11.

(A) 24 pi (B) 32 pi (C) 64 pi (D) 65 pi (E) 84 pi","output":"# Problem: In a plane, four circles with radii of 1, 3, 5, and 7 intersect a line l at a single point A, such that the circles can be on either side of the line. The region S is defined as the set of all points lying inside at least one of these circles. Find the maximum area of region S. The options are: (A) 24pi  (B) 32pi  (C) 64pi  (D) 65pi  (E) 84pi To determine the maximum area of the region S, we need to consider the largest possible union of the areas defined by the circles overlapping each other. Here are the key steps: 1. Identify the circles with the largest radii, because they will most likely contribute more to the area of the overlap. 2. Place the two larger circles (with radii 7 and 5) on either side of the line l and consider their overlap. 3. The circles with radii 3 and 1 will intersect within the larger circles, either on one side or both sides of the line.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Area of individual circles**:     - Area of the circle with radius 7:       [       text{Area} = pi times 7^2 = 49pi       ]     - Area of the circle with radius 5:       [       text{Area} = pi times 5^2 = 25pi       ]     - Area of the circle with radius 3:       [       text{Area} = pi times 3^2 = 9pi       ]     - Area of the circle with radius 1:       [       text{Area} = pi times 1^2 = 1pi       ] 2. **Maximum overlap scenario**:    Since we are interested in maximum overlapping, we place the circles in such a way that they overlap significantly. This can be achieved by placing the circles with radii 7 and 5 on either side of the line l and placing circles with radii 3 and 1 such that the whole region lies entirely within one of the larger circles. To maximize S, the best configuration would be to place the smaller circles within the larger circles as much as possible. 3. **Calculations**:     - The areas contributing are from the largest area minus the non-overlapping areas.     - For the largest circle (r = 7):       [       49pi       ]     - Subtract the overlapping area (which is the area occupied by the smaller circle within the largest circle). Since the smaller circle entirely lies within the larger one:       [       49pi       ]     - Sum the two overlapping circles:       [       S = 49pi + 25pi - (smaller area) = 49pi + 25pi - 9pi = 65pi       ] The overlapping of circles with the highest added area minus the smaller parts eventually boils down to positioning within the largest possible extent. # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum area of the region S is: [ boxed{65pi} ]"},{"instruction":"Andrew's father's age is eight times Andrew's age.

On the left pan of the scale, all the weights are distinct. The problem is to prove that the number of weights on the right pan is at least as many as on the left pan. 2. **Identifying Duplicates**: If on the right pan there are any two identical weights, we replace them with a single weight that is the sum of these two weights. This new weight will also be a power of 2. 3. **Reduction Process**: We continue this process until there are no duplicate weights on the right pan. This process can be executed as follows:     * If there are two weights of mass (2^k), replace them with one weight of mass (2^{k+1}), reducing the number of weights by one. 4. **Binary Decomposition**: The primary observation here is based on the uniqueness of the binary representation of numbers. In any set of weights represented by powers of 2, each number appears uniquely in its binary form.     * Since on the left pan, all weights are distinct powers of 2, their total sum is represented uniquely by their binary form.     * On the right pan, the process of combining two identical weights to form a higher power of two ensures that the sum of weights remains the same but represented succinctly in the required power of two. 5. **Final Equality**: After performing this reduction, if there are still weights on the right pan that are identical, this implies they can be combined further. Since the total weight on both pans must be equal (for equilibrium), the unique binary decomposition principle assures us that ultimately, the set of weights on the left pan and the set of weights on the right pan must exactly match in terms of their respective powers of 2. 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, through this process, since we know the weights on the left pan are all distinct, for the right pan to balance this with potentially combined weights always forming another power of two, the number of these weights cannot be fewer than those on the left pan initially. Hence, we conclude that the number of weights on the right pan is at least as many as the number of weights on the left pan. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Toby wants to walk an average of 9,000 steps per day over the next week.

However, within this block, the two Olympic promotional advertisements and the public service advertisement can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. But, since the Olympic promotional advertisements cannot be played consecutively, we must subtract the arrangements where they are together. There are 2 ways to arrange the Olympic advertisements consecutively within the block (either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end), and for each of these arrangements, the public service advertisement has 2 possible positions (either at the beginning or at the end of the block). Thus, we have 3! - 2 times 2 = 2 valid arrangements for the block.

Furthermore, because the line y=x intersects the circle creating a chord of length 2sqrt{7}, the perpendicular distance from the center to the line y=x should equal half the chord's length, which is sqrt{7}. The equation of the line x-3y=0 can be rewritten as y=frac{1}{3}x, which has a slope of frac{1}{3}, whereas the slope of the line y=x is 1.

This implies N generates a propeller-like structure maintaining perpendicularity. 6. **Midsegment and Tangents:**        - The given condition BN = EM implies we exploit symmetries of the triangle's elements.    - From geometry properties of right triangles and circles, midpoint M of hypotenuse BC plus symmetrical elements provide central points concerning EF lines. 7. **Central Angle Relationships:**    - DFG properties need consideration using the triangle’s altitude from E to A intersecting center lines. **Conclusion:**    - Using geometric properties from right triangles, symmetries of midpoints, and tangencies:      Since D, F, and G preserve perpendicularities and midpoints aligned across DF, BN, EM, we conclude that DF perp FG. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Can the number, formed by writing out the integers from 1 to ( n ) (where ( n > 1 )) in a row, be the same when read from left to right and from right to left?","output":":  To determine if the number formed by writing consecutive integers from 1 to n (where n>1) can be read the same from left to right and right to left, follow these steps:  1. **Define the Number (N)**:     Let (N = overline{123 ldots n ldots 321}) be the symmetrical number formed by writing the integers from 1 to n in sequence and then reversing the sequence. 2. **Determine the Length of (N)**:     N will be an (m)-digit number. The symmetry implies that the total sequence consists of n followed by numbers down to 1 and then up again to n. Since n > 1, it's clear m > 18 because of the length of the mirrored sequence. 3. **Split (N) into Two Parts**:     Consider the first k digits and the last k digits of N, where (k = leftlfloor frac{m}{2} rightrfloor). These parts are denoted by A and B respectively. 4. **Determine the Bounds for (n)**:     Denote the largest power of ten fully contained within A as (10^p). It's logical that:     [     n < 2 cdot 10^p + 1     ]     This indicates that n is at most (p + 2)-digit long because doubling the largest power of ten captures the essence of (A)'s and (B)'s placements. 5. **Analyze (A) and (B)**:     The segment A will contain a sequence like (99 ldots 9_p 100 ldots 0_p 1) (i.e., (p) digits of 9 followed by 100 and (p) zeros, followed by 1). Conversely, the segment B will contain 100 ldots 0_p 199ldots 9_p (i.e., 100 and (p) zeros followed by 199 and (p) digits of 9). 6. **Establish Impossibility**:     Given the constructed forms of A and (B), it's impossible for such sequences to align perfectly in reverse (back-to-front) n a palindromic structure when (n > 1). Specifically, the mirrored boundary and ordering of numbers within A and B will ensure that they can't form a true symmetrical number read identically forwards and backwards. **Conclusion**: Thus, it is not possible for the number formed by consecutive integers from 1 to n to be read the same from right to left and left to right when n > 1.

The possible transitions are:      - If a yellow and red meet, they become both green: (x, y, z) to (x-1, y-1, z+2)      - If a yellow and green meet, they become both red: (x, y, z) to (x-1, y+2, z-1)      - If a red and green meet, they become both yellow: (x+2, y-1, z-1)     2. **Invariant Analysis Using Modular Arithmetic**      Let x, y, z represent the number of yellow, red, and green chameleons respectively. Observe the invariant:     text{remainder of } (y - x) text{ modulo } 3         - Initially:       (y - x) = 10 - 7 = 3 equiv 0 mod 3           We must prove that this invariant holds through every possible transition:      - For (x-1, y-1, z+2):         y - x to (y-1) - (x-1) = y - x         Thus, remains unchanged.      - For (x-1, y+2, z-1):         y - x to (y+2) - (x-1) = (y - x) + 3         Thus, increases by 3 (hence the same modulo 3).      - For (x+2, y-1, z-1):         y - x to (y-1) - (x+2) = (y - x) - 3         Thus, decreases by 3 (hence the same modulo 3).    Therefore, through all transitions, the remainder when (y - x) is divided by 3 is invariant and remains 0.     3. **Conclusion based on Total Count Constraints**      Since the total number of chameleons is 34, not a multiple of 3, and (y - x) equiv 0 mod 3, we can deduce:    - All chameleons cannot become yellow or red because (y - x) equiv 0 mod 3 would not hold if we have all chameleons under the same non-green category (would imply 34 modulo 3 in counts).    - The only viable unified color satisfying these constraints is green.

For any three points among them, there exists a band with width 1 containing them. We need to prove that there exists a band with width ( sqrt{2} ) containing all four points. 2. **Analyzing the Band Width:**    A band with width ( d ) is defined as the set of all points that are at a distance less than or equal to ( frac{d}{2} ) from a line. For three points to be contained within a band of width 1, the maximum perpendicular distance from any of these points to the line must be less than or equal to ( frac{1}{2} ). 3. **Considering Triangles:**    Let's consider the triangles formed by any three points among ( A, B, C, D ). Suppose triangle ( triangle ABC ) has the maximum area among the four possible triangles. This implies that the height from any vertex to the opposite side is at most 1, as otherwise, the area would be larger than any other triangle formed by the four points. 4. **Height Analysis:**    Assume without loss of generality that the height from ( B ) to ( AC ) is 1. Let ( E ) be the foot of the perpendicular from ( B ) to ( AC ). Thus, ( BE = 1 ). 5. **Distance Considerations:**    - If ( AE leq 1 ) or ( CE leq 1 ), then ( AB leq sqrt{2} ) or ( BC leq sqrt{2} ). This implies that there exists a band with width ( sqrt{2} ) containing ( A, B, C ).    - If ( AE > 1 ) and ( CE > 1 ), then we need to consider the fourth point ( D ). 6. **Fourth Point Analysis:**    - Suppose ( D ) is such that ( BD > sqrt{2} ). This would imply that either triangle ( triangle ABD ) or ( triangle BCD ) has a height greater than 1, which contradicts the given condition that any three points can be contained within a band of width 1. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since any three points can be contained within a band of width 1, and considering the maximum area triangle ( triangle ABC ), we can conclude that all four points ( A, B, C, D ) can be contained within a band of width ( sqrt{2} ).

The number of combinations with one striped sock and one checkered sock is the product of the number of options for each type: 4 (striped) * 4 (checkered) = 16 combinations Now, we add the two results together to get the total number of different combinations: 16 (striped + solid) + 16 (striped + checkered) = 32 combinations Therefore, there are boxed{32}  different combinations of socks that can be formed under the given conditions."},{"instruction":"the sequence (a_n) where a_n = 2^n  1, suppose a matrix with 7 rows and 12 columns has its element in the ith row and jth column, c_{ij} = a_i cdot a_j + a_i + a_j (where i=1, 2, ldots, 7; j=1, 2, ldots, 12).

Substituting a_n = 2^n - 1 into the formula, we obtain the following: c_{ij} = (2^i - 1) cdot (2^j - 1) + (2^i - 1) + (2^j - 1). By expanding the product and combining like terms, the equation simplifies to: c_{ij} = 2^i cdot 2^j - 2^i - 2^j + 1 + 2^i - 1 + 2^j - 1, c_{ij} = 2^{i+j} - 1. We can see that the value of c_{ij} only depends on the sum of i and j. For c_{ij} to be equal to c_{mn} (where i, m = 1, 2, ldots, 7 and j, n = 1, 2, ldots, 12), we must have: 2^{i+j} - 1 = 2^{m+n} - 1. This implies that i+j = m+n. Due to the monotonicity of the exponential function, c_{ij} will be different whenever i+j neq m+n. In order to determine the number of different possible values for c_{ij}, we need to count the number of distinct sums that can be formed using i+j, where i in {1, 2, ldots, 7} and j in {1, 2, ldots, 12}. The minimum sum is 1 + 1 = 2 and the maximum sum is 7 + 12 = 19. So the possible sums are all the integers from 2 to 19, which gives us 18 different sums.

Next, we are given that p(80 < X leqslant 120)= frac{3}{4}.

Since x in [0, pi], we have: x + frac{pi}{3} in left[frac{pi}{3}, frac{4pi}{3}right]. The sine function is periodic, with a period of 2pi. Within one period, particularly between frac{pi}{3} and frac{4pi}{3}, the sine function will increase from 0 to its maximum at frac{pi}{2} and then decrease to 0 again at frac{2pi}{3}, and continue to decrease until frac{4pi}{3}.

Given the ratio of the three interior angles of a triangle, we can calculate the degrees of the three angles by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180^circ, and then determine the degree of the largest angle. The area of the triangle can then be found by applying the properties of an isosceles right triangle.   This problem tests knowledge of the triangle angle sum theorem and the calculation of a triangle's area."},{"instruction":"f θ∈left( frac {7π}{4},2πright), then sqrt {12sin θcos θ}=　　() A: cos θsin θ B: sin θ+cos θ C: sin θcos θ D: cos θsin θ","output":"Solution: sqrt {1-2sin θcos θ}   = sqrt {sin ^{2}θ+cos ^{2}θ-2sin θcos θ}   = sqrt {(sin θ-cos θ)^{2}}   =|sin θ-cos θ|   Since θ∈left( frac {7π}{4},2πright),   Therefore, sin θ-cos θ < 0   Thus, |sin θ-cos θ|=cos θ-sin θ.

Cette description me fait penser à un jeu de la gamme des titres éducatifs produits par des sociétés comme The Learning Company, Broderbund, ou Edmark, qui étaient populaires sur les systèmes Windows 95 et 98. Cependant, un titre spécifique qui correspond exactement à cette description ne se distingue pas clairement parmi les plus connus. Une série qui se rapproche de cette description pourrait être **\\"The Magic School Bus\\"**, qui offrait une gamme de titres éducatifs basés sur la série de livres et le dessin animé populaire. Chaque jeu emmenait les enfants dans des aventures éducatives couvrant différents sujets scientifiques, de l'espace à l'océan, en passant par le corps humain et, en effet, la météo. **\\"The Magic School Bus Explores the World of Weather\\"** (ou un titre similaire, le nom exact peut varier) pourrait être un bon candidat. Bien qu'il ne s'agisse pas d'un jeu axé uniquement sur le contrôle de la météo, il comporterait très probablement des activités l'englobant dans le cadre d'une exploration plus large des sciences et de la météorologie. Ces jeux étaient réputés pour leur format éducatif interactif et divertissant, proposant divers mini-jeux et activités expérimentales. Si ce n'est pas \\"The Magic School Bus\\", un autre jeu de cette époque, intégrant une variété de mini-jeux et offrant une interaction avec des concepts météorologiques, pourrait être plus difficile à identifier sans détails plus spécifiques. Les jeux de cette période étaient souvent vendus en packs éducatifs ou faisaient partie de bibliothèques logicielles en milieu scolaire, ce qui pourrait rendre leur traçabilité plus difficile aujourd'hui, surtout si l'on recherche un mini-jeu spécifique au sein d'une compilation plus vaste. Je recommanderais de jeter un coup d'œil aux gammes de produits de ces éditeurs éducatifs de fin des années 90 et début 2000 pour voir si l'un d'entre eux évoque le bon souvenir. Vous pourriez également parcourir les archives en ligne ou les forums dédiés aux jeux rétro et éducatifs pour voir si quelqu'un d'autre se souvient d'un jeu correspondant à cette description."},{"instruction":"Known for the albums Quiet Nights and Milestones, jazz trumpeter Miles Davis collaborated several times with pianist Gil Evans. Their 1958 adaptation of George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess bears little resemblance to the 1935 original. Davis and Evans felt no desire to please listeners expecting an exact duplication of the opera. They omitted parts, such as the aria \\"I Got Plenty of Nuthin',\\" and sometimes made only brief gestures toward Gershwin's melodies. But Davis and Evans's willingness to recompose Gershwin's work led to one of the most enduring albums in Davis's catalog. According to the text, what is true about the aria \\"I Got Plenty of Nuthin' \\"? A.It appears in the Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess but not in the adaptation by Davis and Evans. B.A brief quotation from it appears in Davis and Evans's adaptation of Porgy and Bess. C.Listeners familiar with Gershwin's body of work generally disliked it.

This directly supports option A, indicating that this particular aria, while part of the original Gershwin opera, did not appear in the collaborative adaptation by Davis and Evans. The text does not suggest that a brief quotation from \\"I Got Plenty of Nuthin'\\" appears in their adaptation, which eliminates option B. Option C, suggesting listeners familiar with Gershwin's work generally disliked \\"I Got Plenty of Nuthin',\\" is not mentioned or implied anywhere in the text, so it's incorrect. Lastly, option D is also incorrect because the text does not mention Davis adapting \\"I Got Plenty of Nuthin'\\" on his album \\"Milestones\\"; it specifically discusses deviations in their adaptation of \\"Porgy and Bess.\\" Therefore, through the process of elimination and directly according to the content provided, option A is correct because it accurately reflects the text's information about the omission of \\"I Got Plenty of Nuthin'\\" from Davis and Evans's adaptation."},{"instruction":"hy","output":"Hello!

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"I want a free trading bot on Trading View","output":"To get a free trading bot on TradingView, one typically has two routes to explore: using Pine Script to code a custom trading strategy that can generate alerts for potential trades or looking for publicly shared scripts and strategies within the TradingView community that might include bot-like functionalities. However, it’s essential to note that a full automated trading bot directly on TradingView, without using additional tools or platforms, is somewhat limited due to the platform's nature. Here's how you can proceed: # 1. **Use Pine Script for Custom Alerts** You can use TradingView's Pine Script to code your trading strategies. Although Pine Script is designed for technical analysis and generating alerts rather than executing trades automatically, you can use these alerts to inform your manual trades or as a signal for an external bot or a system that can automate trades on your behalf. **Steps:** - Learn the basics of Pine Script on TradingView's Pine Script documentation. - Develop your trading strategy and code it using Pine Script. The strategy should include your criteria for entering and exiting trades. - Set up the script to send alerts when your trade criteria are met. # 2. **External Automation (Bridging Alerts to a Trading Bot)** To automate trading based on the alerts generated by your TradingView scripts: - Utilize a third-party service or a custom-built system that can receive TradingView alerts (usually via email or webhook) and execute trades on your behalf on the trading platform of your choice. Services like Autoview, 3Commas, or TradingConnector can bridge this gap but note that full automation might not be entirely “free.” # 3. **Search for Community Scripts** - Explore TradingView’s public library for scripts that resemble trading bots. Some authors share sophisticated strategies that come closest to automated trading bots when used with alerts. - Be cautious, as the effectiveness and safety of using public scripts can vary. Always backtest any strategy under realistic conditions before considering live trading. # 4. **Considerations and Warnings:** - **Automation** requires careful setup and frequent monitoring. No system is entirely foolproof, and markets can change in ways that might render a previously successful strategy unprofitable. - **Scams and misleading scripts**: Be wary of any script or external service promising guaranteed returns. Always do thorough research and testing. - **Compliance and risk**: Ensure any automated trading setup complies with the rules and regulations of the trading platforms and jurisdictions you operate in. Understand the risks involved in trading, especially in volatile markets. # 5. **Afterthought: Paid Services** Though your question focuses on free options, consider evaluating paid services after due diligence. They often provide more robust, reliable, and safer ways to automate trading compared to completely free solutions, which might come with limitations or hidden risks. Remember, successful trading involves more than just automation; market analysis, risk management, and emotional discipline are also key components."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Its departure leaves a gap in our hearts and our Saturday mornings, but the memories of solving intricate mysteries from the comfort of our living rooms will always remain. **Johnny Test**: A Testament to Mischievous Ingenuity *Johnny Test* delivered a blend of science fiction, humor, and sibling rivalry that made it a staple of animated programming. Johnny's antics, accompanied by his talking dog Dukey and genius twin sisters Susan and Mary, captured the imaginations of viewers, proving that curiosity and a bit of mischief could lead to the most exhilarating adventures. Though we'll miss Johnny's flamboyant hair and experimental escapades, his spirit lives on in every child who dreams of inventing and exploring. **Regular Show**: Breaking the Mold With its unique blend of surreal humor and relatable workplace dynamics, *Regular Show* stood out as a cartoon that transcended age groups. Mordecai and Rigby's slacker lifestyle and fantastical misadventures brought a sense of camaraderie and escapism that was both comforting and captivating. Its departure is a poignant reminder of the show's impact on the animation landscape, celebrating friendship and the beauty found in the mundane. As we wave goodbye to these cherished shows, their legacy is not merely in the episodes we fondly recall but in the laughter, lessons, and sense of wonder they instilled in us. The transition to the new CW4Kids Revival lineup is not about replacing the old but honoring the journey of animated storytelling and its pivotal role in shaping our weekends. To *Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated*, *Johnny Test*, and *Regular Show*, thank you for the memories, the joy, and the countless adventures. As we welcome new stories and characters into our homes, your spirit will continue to inspire and entertain future generations in syndication, streaming, and in our hearts.

Важно, чтобы цели были четко сформулированы и понятны каждому ее члену. 4. **Взаимная поддержка и обратная связь:** Поощрение культуры открытости, где каждый чувствует себя комфортно высказываться и предлагать идеи, а также где поощряется обратная связь, помогает создать атмосферу взаимопонимания и поддержки. 5. **Тренинги и обучающие программы:** Совместное обучение и развитие навыков не только повышает квалификацию сотрудников, но и способствует их сплочению, так как люди учатся работать вместе более эффективно. 6. **Создание командных традиций и ритуалов:** Ритуалы, такие как утренние собрания, празднование дней рождений сотрудников, еженедельные обзоры достижений и пр., способствуют укреплению ощущения единства и принадлежности к группе. 7. **Игры и упражнения на доверие:** Упражнения, направленные на укрепление доверия между членами команды, помогают разрушить барьеры, создать открытую и поддерживающую атмосферу. 8. **Организация совместных волонтерских проектов или благотворительности:** Общие усилия, направленные на помощь другим, не только приносят пользу обществу, но и сплачивают коллектив, обеспечивая участникам сильное ощущение совместно достигнутых результатов. Эти способы не являются исчерпывающими, но могут служить эффективным началом для сплочения группы и формирования командного духа."},{"instruction":"import math import logging from functools import partial from collections import OrderedDict from copy import deepcopy import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F from timm.models.layers import to_2tuple from lib.models.layers.patch_embed import PatchEmbed, PatchEmbed_event, xcorr_depthwise from .utils import combine_tokens, recover_tokens from .vit import VisionTransformer from ..layers.attn_blocks import CEBlock _logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class VisionTransformerCE(VisionTransformer): \\"\\"\\" Vision Transformer with candidate elimination (CE) module A PyTorch impl of : \`An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale\` -

To access intermediate features, you can collect the outputs from individual blocks. Here is an adaptation of the \`forward_features\` method to illustrate how you might accomplish this.

Each element in this list corresponds to the output from a Transformer block. # Caveats - **Model Modification**: This adjustment changes the signature of the \`forward_features\` method, which means you will need to adapt any code that uses this method accordingly. - **Memory Usage**: Storing outputs from every layer can significantly increase memory consumption, especially with large images and deep models.

The king entrusted him with a mission of the utmost importance: to find the missing colors and bring back joy and life to their world. # Page 1: The Grey Kingdom - **To color:** The king, the castle, some trees, and clouds. # Pages 2-3: The World of Flowers - **Mission:** Find the red, yellow, and pink for tulips, roses, and daisies. - **To color:** A field of various flowers, a butterfly. # Pages 4-5: The Forest of Lost Colors - **Mission:** Retrieve green for the leaves and brown for the trunks of the trees. - **To color:** Trees, a squirrel, a forest path. # Pages 6-7: The Sparkling River - **Mission:** Bring blue for the water and white to froth the movement of the waves. - **To color:** The river, fishes, a small bridge. # Pages 8-9: The Caves of Hidden Jewels - **Mission:** Seek purple for amethysts and orange for sunstones. - **To color:** The inside of a cave, various crystals, a bat. # Pages 10-11: The Dancing Mountains - **Mission:** Return with gray for rocks and sky blue for the distant horizon. - **To color:** Mountain peaks, an eagle, clouds. # Pages 12-13: The Valley of Rainbows - **Mission:** Find all the colors to create a magical rainbow. - **To color:** A rainbow, rabbits, flowers. # Pages 14-15: The Mountain of the Sad Dragon - **Final Mission:** Use the collected colors to give life and happiness to the dragon. - **To color:** The dragon, a treasure, the mountain peak. **End of the Story:** Thanks to Leo, all the colors were found and brought back to the kingdom. The dragon, now vibrant and colorful, became the happiest protector of the kingdom. The king, as well as all the inhabitants, found their smiles and joy of life again. The brilliant colors lit up every corner of the kingdom, promising happy days forever. **Advice to parents and teachers:** Encourage children to choose the colors they like for each page, explaining to them that every color they add is a step towards the happy end of the story. This will encourage them to think about the importance of color in our perception of the world and express their creativity."},{"instruction":"Pour l histoire en français , on ajoute une autre Mission à LEO plus que sa mission de coloriage, il devra trouver la famille du roi qui est disparu dans le monde sans couleurs, fais moi une histoire","output":"**Titre :** Le Héros des Couleurs et la Quête de la Famille Royale **Introduction :** Dans le Royaume en Gris, non seulement les couleurs avaient disparu, mais également la famille du roi.

Im Folgenden werden die jeweils zentralen Fragestellungen dieser Stränge erläutert und es wird gefragt, in wieweit sie uns in die Lage versetzen, die politische Form des Kapitalismus zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts auf den Begriff zu bringen.1 1. Staat im ...? Über eine lange historische Epoche dominierte in der kapitalismuskritischen Theorieproduktion ein Verständnis von Staat als Instrument der herrschenden Klassen. Dass er dies sei, sollte durch Beschreibungen der Staatstätigkeit belegt werden. Abgestellt wurde vor allem auf die Nutzung staatlicher Repressionsgewalt zum Zwecke der Disziplinierung von Ausgebeuteten.2 So unterschiedlich sich die Ausführungen von Lenin (1917) oder von Miliband (1969) über den Staat im einzelnen auch lesen, theoretisch stimmen sie darin überein, dass sie eine generelle Form „Staat“ unterstellen, um sodann dessen besondere Ausprägung im Kapitalismus zu erklären.3 Damit unterscheiden sie sich zwar politisch, nicht aber theoretisch von Geschichten der Staatsgewalt wie sie etwa Tilly (1992) oder Reinhard (1999) vorgelegt haben. In ihnen finden sich viele kluge historische Darlegungen über die veränderte Bedeutung von Religion, die Entwicklung des Militärs, der staatlichen Fiskalverwaltung und anderes mehr, neuerdings auch über spezifische Merkmale des „europäischen Staates“, aber Staat, so sehr er sich im einzelnen verändert, bleibt immer „Staat im“: Staat im Mittelalter, Staat im Absolutismus, Staat im Kapitalismus, Staat in Europa und so fort. Von hier aus ergibt sich theoretisch keine Fragestellung, die es ermöglichen würde, die politische Form des Kapitalismus zu analysieren: den kapitalistischen Staat. 2. Kapitalistischer Staat als bürgerlicher Staat? Eine solche Zielsetzung verfolgten dagegen alle, die sich an der - vor allem in Deutschland4 - in den 1970er Jahren geführten staatstheoretischen Diskussion beteiligten. Weil versucht wurde, die allgemeine Form des Staates aus der allgemeinen Analyse des Kapitals, wie sie Karl Marx vorgelegt hat,5 abzuleiten, wurde und wird sie als Ableitungsdebatte bezeichnet. Den theoretischen Anstoß lieferten Konzeptionen, die darauf abzielten, die historisch spezifische Form von Staatsgewalt in der aktuellen Epoche des Kapitalismus zu bestimmen: die Theorie des Monopolkapitalismus und die Theorie des Spätkapitalismus. Mit der Theorie des Staatsmonopolitischen Kapitalismus (Stamokap) wurde eine zeitgenössische Fortschreibung der dogmatisierten Revolutionstheorie des Leninismus-Stalinismus intendiert. Entwickelt wurde sie von Intellektuellen in der Sowjetunion und in der DDR sowie in europäischen kommunistischen Parteien, verbreitet war sie aber auch in der linken Sozialdemokratie und im kritischen Alltagsjargon. Die Möglichkeit einer sozialistischen Revolution in der aktuellen Phase galt als doppelt begründet: zum einen durch die unterstellte überhistorisch wirksame Dynamik einer Entwicklung von Produktivkräften, die schließlich notwendig in Widerspruch zu bestehenden Produktionsverhältnissen geraten müsse, zum anderen durch die Verschmelzung von Großkapital und Staat. Diese mache den Staat zum ideellen Gesamtkapitalisten des Monopolkapitals, erweitere aber gerade dadurch auch die oppositionellen Kräfte um die Fraktionen des nicht-monopolisierten Kapitals.6 Die theoretische Konzeption des „Spätkapitalismus“ wurde besonders prominent von Claus Offe - im Anschluss an eine entsprechende Argumentation bei Jürgen Habermas7 - vertreten. Während in den ausgehenden 1960er Jahren noch viele die neuen Möglichkeiten einer planification gesellschaftlicher Entwicklung durch den Staat begrüßten und sich Akademiker/innen dem Staat als Berater/innen für eine „Verwissenschaftlichung der Politik“ anboten,8 galt Claus Offe die zunehmende Notwendigkeit solcher Planung als Ausdruck einer fundamentalen Strukturkrise. Im Spätkapitalismus erfordere der kapitalistische Verwertungsprozess zunehmend politische Steuerung. Der Staat müsse jetzt nicht mehr nur ökonomische sowie außenpolitische und militärische Stabilität herstellen, sondern auch für die politische Loyalität der Massen sor-gen. (1972: 77) Allerdings gefährde das Erfordernis einer Intervention des Staates in die Gesellschaft die gleichzeitige Erfüllung dieser widerstreitenden Steuerungsleistungen. Damit stehe die Legitimation des Staates und folglich die Legitimation der bestehenden Gesellschaft in Frage. Für Offe tritt die Krise der Gesellschaft nicht nur als politische Krise in Erscheinung, sie ist Krise der Legitimation, folglich politische Krise. Wolfgang Müller und Christel Neusüß haben sowohl die Theorie des „Staats-monopolitischen Kapitalismus“ als auch diejenige des Spätkapitalismus als neue Ausprägungen des Revisionismus interpretiert. Zwar sei die mögliche Wirkung von Politik zur Stabilisierung und zur Veränderung der Gesellschaft nicht zu bestreiten, eine materialistische Analyse verlange aber, dass die Grenzen solcher Reformen bestimmt würden. Auf eine derartige Analyse hätten Vertreterinnen revisionistischer Positionen aber seit jeher verzichtet. Eine „Konzentration auf Politik“, wie sie Offe durchgängig verlangte (z.B. 1975: 9)9, sei abzulehnen. Stattdessen müsse es darum gehen, die Form des Staates - und damit auch die strukturellen Grenzen von Staatstätigkeit - aus den Widersprüchen der Warenproduktion zu erklären. Im Zentrum der theoretischen An-strengungen müsse die Antwort auf die Frage stehen, warum die politische Form des Kapitalismus die Besonderung des Staates von der Gesellschaft sei. Mit diesen Thesen haben Müller/Neusüß der nachfolgenden Debatte das Programm vorgegeben.10 Alle Beteiligten an dieser Debatte mühten sich, eine Antwort auf die erstmals von Paschukanis gestellte Frage zu finden, warum im Kapitalismus die Klassenherrschaft nicht von einem Apparat der herrschenden Klasse ausgeübt wird, sondern statt dessen die Form einer öffentlichen Herrschaft annimmt (1929: 119f.) Alle stimmten auch darin überein, dass es unzulänglich sei, das Verhältnis zwischen Staat und Gesellschaft als ein politisches zu beschreiben, weil in der „Besonderung“ des Staates von der Gesellschaft ja gerade die sozialen Verhältnisse kapitalistischer Gesellschaften zum Ausdruck kämen. Im einzelnen wurden unterschiedliche Erklärungsansätze verfolgt und heftig gegeneinander verteidigt. Für die einen erklärte sich die Notwendigkeit des besonderten Staates aus der potentiell zerstörerischen Wirkung von Konkurrenz und einer unzureichenden Bereitstellung allgemeiner Produktionsbedingungen durch die auf Profitproduktion ausgerichteten Einzelkapitale (Altvater 1972; Läpple 1973). Auch sei es Aufgabe des Staates, eine Politik zur Überwindung kapitalistischer Krisen zu entwickeln. Eine derartige Politik aber bleibe begrenzt, weil staatlichem Krisenmanagement nur die „Oberflächenbewegungen“ der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft zugänglich seien (ebd., 29). Der grundlegende Widerspruch einer kapitalistischen Produktionsweise lasse sich nicht politisch „managen“.”翻译为中文","output":"海德·格斯滕贝格 固定与解界 关于资本主义政治形态的理论接近 在资本主义批判理论生产的历史中，有四个主要的论述方向涉及与国家的争论。接下来将阐明这些方向的中心问题，并探讨它们在多大程度上使我们能够概念化21世纪初资本主义的政治形态。 1. 国家在......？ 在资本主义批判理论生产的长时期历史中，一种将国家视为统治阶级工具的理解方式占据了主导地位。通过描述国家活动来证明这一点，主要关注国家使用镇压力量来纪律化被剥削者。尽管列宁（1917年）或米利班（1969年）关于国家的论述各不相同，理论上他们却一致认为，他们假设了一个通用形式的“国家”来解释其在资本主义中的特殊表现形态。这使得他们在政治上不同，但在理论上并未与像蒂利（1992年）或雷因哈德（1999年）等人提出的关于国家力量的历史叙述有所区别。在这些叙述中，虽然有关于宗教意义的变化、军事、国家财政管理等方面的深刻历史阐述，最近还有关于“欧洲国家”的特定特征，但无论细节如何变化，国家始终是“国家在”：中世纪的国家、专制主义下的国家、资本主义下的国家、欧洲的国家等等。从这一点出发，理论上并未提出可使我们能够分析资本主义的政治形态：资本主义国家的问题。 2. 资本主义国家作为资产阶级国家？ 所有参与到上世纪70年代特别是在德国进行的国家理论讨论的人都追求这样一个目标。因为他们试图从卡尔·马克思对资本的一般分析中派生出国家的一般形式，这一讨论被称为“派生辩论”。理论推动来自试图确定当代资本主义时代国家权力的历史特定形态的概念：垄断资本主义理论和晚期资本主义理论。 垄断资本主义国家理论（Stamokap）意图是对列宁主义-斯大林主义的革命理论进行当代重新阐述。这一理论由苏联、东德以及欧洲共产党的知识分子发展出来，也在左翼社会民主党和批判性日常用语中广泛传播。在当前阶段认为社会主义革命的可能性有双重基础：一是通过假定生产力发展的超历史动态最终必然与现存生产关系发生矛盾，另一是通过大资本与国家的融合。这使得国家成为垄断资本的理想总资本家，但也因此扩大了反对力量，包括非垄断资本的派别。 克劳斯·奥费提出的“晚期资本主义”理论特别受到关注 - 这一观点继承自尤尔根·哈贝马斯的相应论证。在20世纪60年代末期，许多人还欢迎通过国家进行社会发展计划化的新可能性，并且学者们作为“政治科学化”的顾问向国家提供服务，奥费认为这种计划的日益必要性表明了一个根本性的结构危机。在晚期资本主义中，资本主义的增值过程越来越需要政治引导。国家现在不仅需要确保经济以及外交和军事稳定，还需要保证大众的政治忠诚。然而，国家介入社会的需求危及这些相互矛盾的控制任务的同时履行。因此，国家的合法性乃至现存社会的合法性受到质疑。对奥费而言，社会危机不仅以政治危机的形式出现，它是合法性危机，因此是政治危机。 沃尔夫冈·穆勒和克里斯特尔·诺伊苏斯将“垄断资本主义国家”理论和晚期资本主义理论视为修正主义的新形式进行了解释。虽然不可否认政治可能对社会的稳定和变革产生影响，但唯物主义分析要求确定此类改革的界限。但是，修正主义立场的代表从来没有进行过这样的分析。奥费始终要求的“对政治的关注”（例如，1975年：9）应被拒绝。相反，我们应该试图从商品生产的矛盾中解释国家的形式 - 以及国家活动的结构性界限。中央理论努力必须回答为什么资本主义的政治形态是国家与社会的特殊化。穆勒/诺伊苏斯为随后的讨论设定了议程。 所有参与这场辩论的人都努力回答帕夏卡尼斯首次提出的问题，即为什么在资本主义下，阶级统治不是由统治阶级的机构执行，而是采取公共统治的形式（1929年：119f）。所有人也一致认为，将国家与社会之间的关系描绘为政治性的是不够的，因为国家与社会的“特殊化”正是资本主义社会关系的体现。具体采用了不同的解释方法，并互相激烈争论。 对一些人来说，特殊的国家之所以必须，是因为竞争的潜在破坏性作用和利润导向的单个资本对一般生产条件提供不足（Altvater 1972; Läpple 1973）。国家还负责制定克服资本主义危机的政策。然而，这样的政策是有限的，因为国家的危机管理只能触及资产阶级社会的“表层运动”（同上，29）：资本主义生产方式的根本矛盾不能通过政治“管理”。"},{"instruction":"请将“Ein zweiter Ansatz suchte zu erklären, warum Lohnarbeiter/innen den Staat als Wahrer des Gemeinwohls verstehen - ein Sachverhalt, der in den 1960er und frühen 1970er Jahren noch besonders auffällig war. Für Flatow/Huisken (1973) ergab sich diese Sicht auf den Staat aus dem Umstand, dass es im Kapitalismus zwar höchst unterschiedliche Quellen des Einkommens gibt, wobei die Interessen der unterschiedlichen Revenuequellenbesitzer miteinander konkurrieren, dass letztere aber auch ein gemeinsames Interesse hätten: die Sicherung ihrer Revenuequelle gegen Aneignungsweisen, die außerhalb des Tausches liegen (1973: 109). Dieses gemeinsame Interesse konstituiert Flatow/Huisken zufolge den bürgerlichen Staat.11 Die im Rückblick markanteste Position ist durch Theoretiker formuliert worden, welche die Allgemeinheit des Rechts in den Mittelpunkt ihrer Argumentation stellten. Blanke/Jürgens/Kastendiek (1974) betonten, dass der staatliche Schutz aller Formen von Privateigentum eine Voraussetzung kapitalistischer Produktion und Reproduktion darstellt. Die Produktion von Waren erfordere die freie Verfügung über Produktionsmittel, einschließlich der Verfügung über den im Tausch für eine bestimmte Zeit angeeigneten Produktionsfaktor Arbeit, folglich den Schutz des Kapitaleigentums. Der Austausch von Waren erfordere Regulierungen, die alle Beteiligten, will sagen: alle Privateigentümer, betrifft. Beides gelinge durch die formale Neutralität des Staates gegenüber den höchst unterschiedlichen Formen von Privateigentum, anders gesagt: durch die Allgemeinheit des Rechts. Damit ist, anders als in den Ansätzen, die auf Funktionen abheben, eine Erklärung der spezifischen politischen Form des Kapitalismus - der Besonderung des Staates - vorgeschlagen worden. Diese Erklärung setzt allerdings historische Verhältnisse voraus, in denen die Neutralität des Staates gedacht werden kann. Auch wenn Blanke/Jürgens/Kastendiek jeden Bezug auf konkrete Verfassungen und Organisationsstrukturen ablehnten,12 Parlamentarismus und allgemeines Wahlrecht ist bei ihnen undiskutiert vorausgesetzt. Die dem Kapitalismus adäquate politische Form ist hier „bürgerlicher Staat“, der Staat westlicher Industriegesellschaften. Das gilt für die gesamte Ableitungsdebatte: Obwohl es in der Formanalyse darum gehen sollte, eine allgemeine theoretische Bestimmung des kapitalistischen Staates zu leisten, also gewissermaßen die allgemeinen Strukturbedingungen zu entschlüsseln, die sich hinter den konkreten historischen Entwicklungen von Staatlichkeit und von Politiken verbergen, lässt sich im Rückblick feststellen, dass die politische Form entwickelter kapitalistischer Gesellschaften des „Westens“ als strukturadäquat unterstellt worden ist. Implizit wurde damit zugleich jener historische Entwicklungspfad als strukturnotwendig unterstellt, dessen unterschiedliche Ausprägungen sich in Anlehnung an Wood (1999: Teil III.9) in dem analytischen Konzept der westlichen Modernisierung zusammenfassen lassen. Lange haben Theoretiker aller politischen und theoretischen Couleur unterstellt, es handle sich dabei um einen universalen Prozess, welcher spätestens mit der Durchsetzung des Kapitalismus in alle bisher nicht modernen und nicht kapitalistischen Gesellschaften eingepflanzt werde und entsprechende politische Formen hervorbringe. Oberflächlich betrachtet lassen sich den Prozessen der Konstitution moderner Nationalstaaten vermeintliche Belege für eine derartige Sicht entnehmen. Denn nicht nur die kolonialen Staaten - seien sie nun direkte Gründungen privater Gesellschaften oder aber Ableger der Staatsgewalt von Kolonialmächten - waren Apparate zum Zwecke der privaten Aneignung, auch in jenen Herrschaftsformen, die bürgerlicher Staatlichkeit historisch voran gingen, diente die zentralisierte Gewalt privater Aneignung. Aber diese formale Übereinstimmung ökonomischer Strukturen verdeckt die Tatsache, dass es in der Epoche des Ancien Regime in europäischen Territorialherrschaften zu einer weitreichenden Trennung von weltlicher und geistlicher Gewalt gekommen war, dass sich Städte zu Rechtssubjekten entwickelt hatten, Herrschaft erheblich kommerzialisiert worden war, und sich im Zuge der Auseinandersetzungen um den rechten Glauben Strukturen der Öffentlichkeit herausgebildet hatten. Zudem gab es religiös und gesellschaftlich begründete Ansätze der Individualisierung. Auf deren Basis entwickelte sich die Konzeption des Interesses, und damit entstanden, wie es Hirschman (1977) formuliert hat, „politische Begründungen des Kapitalismus vor seinem Sieg“. In diesem historischen Zusammenhang konnte die Aneignung der staatlichen Souveränität durch „das Volk“ als Besonderung des Staates von der Gesellschaft durchgesetzt werden. Dagegen ging die Aneignung nationaler Souveränität in sehr vielen zuvor kolonial beherrschten Gesellschaften nicht mit einer Besonderung des Staates von der Gesellschaft einher. Besonders deutlich ist diese Besonderheit von Chabal/Daloz (1999) für postkoloniale afrikanische Gesellschaften heraus gearbeitet worden. Der Staat, so betonen sie, ist hier nicht „öffentliche“, sondern „neo-patrimoniale Gewalt“. Die Gesellschaften sind nicht horizontal strukturiert, hier der Staat und da die Gesellschaft, hier die Politik und da der Markt. Vielmehr markiert die vertikale Strukturierung und markieren deshalb vertikale Verpflichtungs- und Versorgungsstrukturen die Gesamtheit der Gesellschaft. Sehr zu Recht wollen Chabol/Daloz darin nicht eine „Pathologie“ der Moderne sehen, sondern eine ihrer besonderen Ausprägungen (ebd.: 103). Mit dem provokanten Titel „Africa works“ betonen sie ebenso wie Kößler (1994: 94 und passim), dass es sich keineswegs um „Überbleibsel“ traditioneller Verhältnisse handelt, sondern um spezifisch moderne Entwicklungen. Nimmt man die allmählich wachsende Erkenntnis hinzu, dass auch die Staaten der Transformationsgesellschaften, die aus dem Zerfall der Sowjetunion hervorgingen, den Staaten westlicher Industriegesellschaften vielfach nur sehr bedingt entsprechen, so drängt sich die Einsicht auf, dass sich die staatstheoretische Debatte der 1970er Jahre lediglich auf „bürgerliche Staaten“13 bezog, auf eine spezifische Ausprägung der politischen Formen des Kapitalismus also. Eine zweite historische Bornierung der Ableitungsdebatte war zeitgeschichtlicher Natur. Im Rückblick sind ihre zentralen Argumentationsmuster leicht als Kinder jener historischen Phase zu erkennen, in welcher das Abkommen von Bretton Woods noch in Geltung war. Denn als politische Form des Kapitalismus wurde nicht nur der souveräne nationale Staat unterstellt, sondern auch ein Staat, auf den sich - seiner nicht nur illusionären Steuerungs- und Versorgungsleistungen wegen - Reformforderungen und -hoffnungen richten konnten. Mitte der 1970er Jahre jedoch brachen der Weltmarkt und neoliberale Strategien in die nationale Politik ein. Seither wird der Staat auch „an der O-berfläche“ entwickelter Industriegesellschaften sehr viel weniger als Instanz des Allgemeininteresses wahrgenommen. Zwei Jahrzehnte nach dem Ende der Ableitungsdebatte hat ihr Holloway eine Fortsetzung beschert (2002: 112 und passim). Während etwa Hirsch die Entstehung eines „neuen Typus des kapitalistischen Staates“ im Zuge der Globalisierung konstatiert (1998, 33)14 beharrt Holloway darauf, dass der kapitalistische Staat seinen Charakter in der Phase der Globalisierung nicht verändert habe (1993). Nach wie vor sei „Staat“ die verfestigte („fetischisierte“) Form gesellschaftlicher Verhältnisse. Diese Verhältnisse aber seien im Kapitalismus der Tendenz nach schon immer global gewesen, weshalb denn auch die Vorstellung von nationalen kapitalistischen Gesellschaften mit jeweils eigenen Staats-apparaten schon immer falsch gewesen sei (ebd.; 25). Seit Beginn des Kapitalismus seien Nationalstaaten nichts anderes als die fragmentierte Form der Weltgesellschaft (ebd.: 20). ”翻译为中文","output":"第二种方法试图解释为什么工资劳动者将国家视为公共利益的维护者——这一点在1960年代和1970年代初尤其显著。对于Flatow/Huisken（1973）来说，这种对国家的看法源于一个事实，即在资本主义中虽然存在极其不同的收入来源，不同收入来源所有者的利益相互竞争，但他们也有一个共同的兴趣：通过交换以外的方式保护他们的收入来源（1973: 109）。Flatow/Huisken认为，这种共同兴趣构成了资产阶级国家。 从回顾中最为显眼的立场是由那些将法律普遍性置于其论证中心的理论家们提出的。Blanke/Jürgens/Kastendiek（1974）强调，对所有形式的私有财产的国家保护是资本主义生产和再生产的前提。商品生产要求对生产资料的自由支配，包括对以交换方式暂时获得的生产要素劳动的支配，因此需要保护资本财产。商品的交换要求对所有参与者，也就是说所有的私有财产所有者进行规定。这一切通过国家对不同形式的私有财产的形式上的中立，换句话说，通过法律的普遍性得以实现。这与那些强调功能的方法不同，提出了资本主义的特定政治形式——即国家的特殊化的解释。然而，这种解释预设了可以想象国家的中立性的历史条件。尽管Blanke/Jürgens/Kastendiek拒绝提及具体的宪法和组织结构，议会制度和普遍选举权被他们默认存在。对他们而言，与资本主义相适应的政治形式是“资产阶级国家”，即西方工业社会的国家。 这适用于整个派生辩论：尽管形式分析旨在提供资本主义国家的一般理论定义，也就是揭示隐藏在具体历史发展之后的国家性和政策的一般结构条件，但回顾可以发现，发达资本主义国家的政治形式被假定为结构兼容。隐含地，这也假设了Wood（1999: 第III部分.9）通过分析西方现代化概念归纳的不同历史发展模式的路径是结构必然的。长期以来，不同政治和理论倾向的理论家们都假设这是一个普遍过程，即随着资本主义的实施，这一过程最终会被植入到所有尚未现代化和资本主义化的社会中，并产生相应的政治形式。 从现代民族国家构建过程中可以表面上看到这种观点的假定证据。因为不仅殖民地国家——无论是私人公司直接建立的还是殖民大国权力的延伸——都是为了私人占有而设立的机构，即使在资产阶级国家性形式历史之前的统治形式中，集中的权力也服务于私人占有。但这种经济结构的形式上的一致性掩盖了一个事实，即在旧体制时代（Ancien Regime），欧洲领土统治中世俗权力和宗教权力发生了深远的分离，城市发展成为法律主体，统治在很大程度上商业化，并且在正信争议中形成了公共结构。此外，还有宗教和社会基础上的个体化尝试。在这基础上发展出了利益的概念，从而产生了，正如Hirschman（1977）所说，资本主义胜利前的“政治理由”。在这一历史背景下，通过“人民”对国家主权的占有，得以实现国家与社会的特殊化。相比之下，很多之前被殖民统治的社会的国家主权占有并未伴随着国家与社会的特殊化。这种特殊性已经被Chabal/Daloz（1999）对后殖民非洲社会进行了明确的论述。他们强调，这里的国家不是“公共”的，而是“新宗法的权力”。这些社会不是水平结构的，这里是国家那里是社会，这里是政治那里是市场。相反，垂直结构化和因此垂直的义务和供给结构标志着整个社会。Chabal/Daloz非常正确地认为，这不应被视为现代性的“病态”，而是其特殊表现之一（同上：103）。通过挑衅性标题“非洲运作”的方式，他们与Kößler（1994：94及频繁）一样强调，这绝不是传统关系的“残余”，而是具体的现代发展。当逐渐意识到，从苏联解体而来的转型社会的国家，在很大程度上仅仅是与西方工业社会的国家有限相似时，就强烈表明1970年代的国家理论辩论仅仅涉及“资产阶级国家”，也就是资本主义的一种特定政治形态。 派生辩论的另一个历史局限是它的时代性。回顾起来，其核心论证模式很容易被认为是那个历史阶段的产物，那时布雷顿森林协定仍然有效。因为资本主义的政治形式不仅被假设为主权民族国家，而且还假设是一个由于其非幻觉式的管理和供给性能而能够针对改革要求和希望的国家。然而，到了1970年代中期，世界市场和新自由主义战略打破了国家政策。从那时起，国家在发达工业社会的“表层”被视为公共利益的代理人的程度大大减少。 在派生辩论结束二十年后，Holloway为之带来了延续（2002: 112及频繁）。虽然如Hirsch所述，在全球化过程中出现了“资本主义国家的新类型”（1998, 33）14，但Holloway坚持认为，在全球化阶段，资本主义国家的性质没有改变（1993）。国家仍然是社会关系的固化（“拟物化”）形式。但这些关系在资本主义中本质上始终是全球性的，因此关于具有各自国家机构的国家资本主义社会的想法一直是错误的（同上；25）。自资本主义开始以来，国家一直不过是世界社会碎片化的形式（同上：20）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Holloway liefert illustrierende Hinweise auf die sowohl symbolischen als auch gewaltförmigen Elemente solcher Fragmentierung: Das Abspielen von Nationalhymnen, Fahneneide, die Diskriminierung von „Ausländern“, Passkontrollen, das Aufrechterhalten von Armeen, Krieg (2002: 116). Die Existenz des Staates bedeute, dass bestimmte Aspekte gesellschaftlicher Verhältnisse als „politisch“ definiert und damit vom „Ökonomischen“ getrennt werden. Auf diese Weise gerate die Gesamtstruktur aus dem Blick. Eine wirkliche Veränderung der Verhältnisse aber könne nie gelingen, wenn sie sich nur auf „das Politische“ richte (ebd.: 114). Die theoretische Kritik des Staates verlange die Kritik der Vorstellung von der Autonomie des Staates (ebd.: 111). Viele werden diese Kritik an etatistischen Strategiekonzepten unterschreiben, wenige den prinzipiell globalen Charakter des Kapitalismus bestreiten. Doch verbaut diese überhistorische Strukturanalyse des Staates nicht nur die Frage nach der Relevanz konkreter Veränderungen, sie verbaut auch die Entwicklung eines Begriffs von Politik (so auch Hirsch 2003: 38; ähnlich Bensaid 2005: 235). Die Formanalyse des Staates ist theoretisch nützlich, wenn es darum geht, andere Ansätze zu kritisieren, sie erweist sich als theoretisch steril, wenn es darum gehen soll, einen Übergang zur Praxis zu finden. Denn die Begrenzung von „Gesellschaft“ auf die allgemeine Struktur kapitalistischer Klassenverhältnisse, die Holloway dazu zwingt, für die Epoche des Kapitalismus die durchgängige Existenz einer Weltgesellschaft zu konstatieren, ist für die Suche nach dem historischen Subjekt der Veränderung auf die kreative Anti-Macht der vielen einzelnen angewiesen, die (irgendwie) zum „Wir“ werden sollen. Von ihnen wird dann erhofft, dass sie den Kapitalismus durch „eine Million Bienenstiche“ (Holloway, 2005: 271) zum Erliegen bringen. Historisch haben sich Gesellschaften aber zu historischen Subjekten gemacht, indem sie in Öffentlichkeiten über ihre Ziele stritten. Von solchen Öffentlichkeiten wurden früher regelmäßig Sklaven, Frauen, Arme und Dienstboten ausgeschlossen, in neuern Zeiten wurden weitere Ausschlusskriterien hinzugefügt. Und doch wurden in der Durchsetzung neuer Verhältnisse - einschließlich der Eroberung nationaler Souveränität - gemeinschaftliche Konzepte von Gesellschaft entwickelt, die mehr waren als die dann tatsächlich konstituierten realen Verhältnisse. Wird Gesellschaft theoretisch auf die Summe der „Kapitalverhältnisse“ reduziert, so ist es nur konsequent, wenn für den Übergang von der theoretischen in die praktische Kritik der Verhältnisse nur noch der „Schrei“ bleibt, nach Hollo- way ein Ausdruck des Zorns, der über sich selbst hinausragt: in eine offene Zukunft (ebd.:16). Trotz aller sonstigen Unterschiede zu der von Hardt/Negri (2000) vorgelegten Analyse15 kommt diese romantische Revolutionstheorie der Aufforderung gleich, sich jener mystischen Multitude zuzugesellen, von der sich Hardt/Negri erhoffen, dass sie das Empire, die Gesamtheit höchst unterschiedlicher Machtverhältnisse, erschüttern werde (Hirsch 2003: 40). 3. Vom „bürgerlichen Staat“ zur „Verdichtung“ gesellschaftlicher Verhältnisse? Die Ableitungsdebatte bot keine Anleitung für die Analyse konkreter historischer Prozesse. Wann immer sich einzelne Autorinnen und Autoren an derartige Analysen wagten, erlagen sie deshalb auch zumeist der Versuchung, aktuelle Entwicklungen als Ausdruck von Verwertungsbedingungen zu interpretieren, die sich „hinter dem Rücken“ der Akteure durchsetzen. Dass derartiger Ökonomismus konkrete Antworten schuldig bleibt, wurde spätestens Mitte der 1970er Jahre deutlich. Der damals einsetzende wirtschaftliche, politische und gesellschaftliche Umbruch machte die Suche nach einer theoretischen Konzeption dringlich, die dazu befähigt, konkrete Entwicklungen zu verstehen. Das begünstigte den Siegeszug jener analytischen Ansätze, die seit Ende der 1970er Jahre in Frankreich - insbesondere im Anschluss an Arbeiten von Nicos Poulantzas - entwickelt wurden. Ihr gemeinsamer Nenner war die Abkehr von der strukturalistischen Marx-Interpretation der sog. Althusser-Schule und die Entwicklung von „intermediären Konzepten“. Letztere sollen dazu dienen, historische Besonderheiten in der Entwicklung des Kapitalismus zu erfassen. Zunächst im nationalen, zunehmend aber auch im transnationalen Rahmen wurden und werden Kräftekonstellationen analysiert, wird gefragt, in wieweit sie sich verdichten, womöglich sogar zu einem „historischen Block“. Der große Vorteil dieser - alsbald als Regulationstheorie bezeichneten - Ansätze besteht in ihrer Offenheit für die Wirkung gesellschaftlicher, politischer, einschließlich kultureller Auseinandersetzungen und damit in einer dezidierten Abkehr von ökonomischem Determinismus. Was den Staat anlangt, so beschränkte sich die Regulationstheorie allerdings zunächst darauf, dessen ökonomische Funktionen zu benennen (vgl. etwa Lipietz 1992). Kritik provozierte Revisionen. Seither wird die Regulationstheorie vielfach als eine Großtheorie genutzt, mit deren Konzepten es möglich sein soll, alle einzelnen Prozesse, die unterschiedlichsten Formen von Herrschaft, die Analyse von Diskursen oder die Entwicklung neuer Institutionen in einen Gesamtzusammenhang zu bringen.16 Im raschen Siegeszug des Terminus „For- dismus“ haben die Verlockungen dieser Konzepte einen ersten markanten Ausdruck gefunden. Das fordistische „Regulationsregime“ soll beschreiben, in welcher Weise spezifische Formen der Arbeitsorganisation, der Akkumulation, der Staatstätigkeit sowie dominanter gesellschaftspolitischer Konzeptionen in der Phase des Kalten Krieges zusammenwirkten, um eine fortschreitende Durchkapitalisierung und Durchstaatlichung von Gesellschaften zu bewirken. Das ist, wenn auch der Zusammenhang zwischen den einzelnen Prozessen samt ihren Institutionalisierungen oft eher illustrierend konstatiert als tatsächlich nachgewiesen wird, ein Vorschlag zur Interpretation einer bestimmten historischen Phase der Entwicklung westlicher kapitalistischer Gesellschaften. Dabei wird die Regulationsweise weder als strukturnotwendige Wirkung von Verwertungsbedingungen, noch als eindeutiges Resultat politischer Steuerung verstanden. Gelegentlich - so insbesondere in den Arbeiten von Jessop (1982, 1992, 2002) - wird die Analyse des Staates auf eine Beschreibung von Institutionen reduziert, die gewissermaßen als Begrenzungen für Strategien von Akteuren fungieren, auch kann die Einheit des terminologisch errichteten Gebäudes dazu führen, dass auf die Analyse der Repressionsapparate des Staates gänzlich verzichtet wird (Jessop 2002: 3). In besonders gründlich reflektierten Versionen (vgl. etwa Hirsch 1994, 2005) wird jedoch der Anspruch erhoben, die Fragestellungen, die in der sogenannten Ableitungsdebatte entwickelt wurden, für die regulationstheoretische Analyse fruchtbar zu machen, anders gesagt, die Trennung von Ökonomie und Politik als Element kapitalistischer Vergesellschaftung zu verstehen, den Staat folglich als die politische Gemeinschaftlichkeit der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft (Hirsch 1994: 166f). Diese Anforderung liefert kein Forschungsdesign für konkrete Analyse, sie kann aber dagegen wappnen, sich in jener für regulationstheoretische Analysen typischen „perspective description“ (Holloway/Picciotto 1978: 7) zu verlieren, die mit illustrierenden Hinweisen auf die Korrespondenz von Staatstätigkeit und Akkumulationsregime arbeitet (z. B. Jessop 2002: 2 und passim). In traditionellen marxistischen Krisentheorien stand die ökonomische Krise nicht nur im Mittelpunkt, sie war gewissermaßen ihr ausschließlicher Inhalt, gesellschaftliche und politische Krisen wurden als „Auswirkungen“ gesehen. Von Regulationstheoretikern (vgl. z.B. Hirsch 1994: 210) wird die Einheit von ökonomischer, politischer und ideologischer Krise behauptet und bestritten, dass es eine a priori privilegierte Ebene der Krisenentstehung gibt (zu andersartigen Anfängen vgl. Hurtienne 1988). So weit so gut. Doch während die meisten von uns politischen und ideologischen Krisen vergleichsweise leicht auf die Spur kommen, ist das mit den ökonomischen Krisen weit weniger einfach. Zunächst hatte sich die Regulationstheorie vorwiegend mit dem Zusammenhang von Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsformen beschäftigt und damals auch - unterschiedliche - Erklärungen für Krisen des Akkumulationsregimes angeboten (vgl. dazu Hübner 1990).”翻译为中文","output":"Holloway 提供了关于这种碎片化的象征性和暴力性元素的示例性指示：播放国歌，宣誓效忠于国旗，歧视“外国人”，护照检查，维持军队，战争（2002：116）。国家的存在意味着将某些社会关系方面定义为“政治”，从而将其与“经济”分离开来。通过这种方式，整体结构就被忽视了。但是，如果只关注“政治”，那么真正改变这些关系永远不会成功（同上：114）。国家的理论批判要求批判国家自主性的观念（同上：111）。 很多人会同意这种对国家主义战略概念的批判，很少有人会质疑资本主义的根本全球性特征。但是，这种超历史的国家结构分析不仅阻碍了对具体变化相关性的探询，也阻碍了政治概念发展的形成（参见 Hirsch 2003：38；类似 Bensaid 2005：235）。 如果是为了批判其他方法，国家的形式分析在理论上是有用的，但如果是为了寻找走向实践的过渡，它就显得理论上不育。因为将“社会”限制在资本主义阶级关系的一般结构上，迫使 Holloway 必须为资本主义时代宣称一个持续存在的世界社会，这对于寻找创造性反权力的许多个体作为变革的历史主体而言，它们（以某种方式）应该成为“我们”。从他们那里，人们希望通过“一百万次蜂蜇”（Holloway，2005：271）来停止资本主义。然而，历史上的社会通过在公共领域就他们的目标进行争论来塑造成为历史主体。过去，奴隶、女性、穷人和仆人常常被排除在这些公共领域之外，近代又增加了更多的排除标准。然而，在实现新的社会关系中——包括征服国家主权——人们开发出了关于社会的集体概念，这些概念不仅仅是那些实际构建的真实关系。如果理论上将社会简化为“资本关系”的总和，那么从理论到实际批判关系的过渡只剩下“尖叫”，按照 Holloway 的说法，这是一种超越自身的愤怒表达：进入一个开放的未来（同上：16）。尽管与 Hardt/Negri（2000）提交的分析有所有其他不同，这种浪漫的革命理论相当于邀请人们加入那个被 Hardt/Negri 希望能震撼帝国的、由极其不同的权力关系组成的神秘的群体（Hirsch 2003：40）。 3. 从“资产阶级国家”到“社会关系的凝聚”？ 派生辩论没有为分析具体的历史过程提供指导。每当单个作者尝试进行此类分析时，他们因此通常倾向于将当前发展解释为“在行动者背后”实现的再利用条件的表达。中1970年代中期，显然经济主义无法提供具体的答案。当时开始的经济、政治和社会变革使寻找能够理解具体发展的理论构想变得迫切。这促进了自1970年代末在法国特别是在 Nicos Poulantzas 的工作之后发展的那些分析方法的成功。它们的共同点是摒弃所谓的 Althusser 派对马克思的结构主义解释，并开发“中介概念”。这些概念旨在捕捉资本主义发展的历史特殊性。最初在国家范围内，但越来越多地在跨国范围内，分析力量构成，询问它们在多大程度上凝聚，甚至可能形成“历史集团”。这些被称为调节理论的方法的主要优势在于它们对社会、政治（包括文化）斗争的影响的开放性，从而明确摒弃了经济决定论。 就国家而言，调节理论最初仅仅限于命名国家的经济职能（参见 Lipietz 1992）。批评促使进行了修订。此后，调节理论被广泛用作一种大理论，其概念被认为能够将所有单个过程、最不同形式的统治、话语分析或新机构的发展整合到一个总体框架中。16“福特主义”术语的迅速风靡体现了这些概念的吸引力。福特主义“调节制度”旨在描述冷战时期特定的劳动组织形式、积累、国家活动以及主导的社会政治观念是如何协同作用的，以促进社会的逐步资本化和国家化。这是对西方资本主义社会某一特定历史阶段发展的解释提议，尽管单个过程及其制度化之间的联系往往是描绘性的而非实际证明的，但调节方式既不被理解为再利用条件的结构必然结果，也不被视为政治控制的明确结果。偶尔，特别是在 Jessop（1982, 1992, 2002）的工作中，对国家的分析被简化为对机构的描述，这些机构作为行动者战略的限制，同样，术语所构建的统一性可能导致完全忽略对国家镇压机构的分析（Jessop 2002：3）。在特别深思熟虑的版本中（参见 Hirsch 1994, 2005），声称要将所谓的派生辩论中发展的问题提问为调节理论分析所用，换句话说，理解经济和政治的分离作为资本主义社会化的元素，因此将国家视为资本主义社会的政治共同体（Hirsch 1994：166f）。这个要求不提供具体分析的研究设计，但它可以防止人们迷失在调节理论分析典型的“透视描述”中（Holloway/Picciotto 1978：7），这种描述通过示例性指引来展示国家活动与积累体制的对应关系（例如 Jessop 2002：2 及频繁）。 在传统的马克思主义危机理论中，经济危机不仅是中心，它本质上是唯一内容，社会和政治危机被视为“影响”。调节理论学者（参见 Hirsch 1994：210）声称经济、政治和意识形态危机的统一，否认存在先验优先的危机产生层面（关于不同的开端，参见 Hurtienne 1988）。这很好。然而，尽管我们大多数人相对容易追踪政治和意识形态危机，但经济危机却远非那么简单。起初，调节理论主要关注积累体制与调节形式之间的联系，并当时也提供了对积累体制危机的（不同）解释（参见 Hübner 1990）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Seit die Staatsanalyse in den regulationstheoretischen Ansatz integriert und damit zugleich ein „Primat der Politik bei der Analyse gesellschaftlicher Prozesse“ konstatiert wird (Hirsch 2005: 57), sucht man präzise ökonomische Analysen aber eher vergeblich. Damit wird die von Müller/Neusüß am Anfang der Ableitungsdebatte gestellte Frage nach den Grenzen von Reformen in Bezug auf jeweüs neue Hegemonieprojekte aber nicht nur nicht beantwortet, sondern erneut nicht einmal gestellt. Auch liefert die Annahme einer allgemeinen Korrespondenz zwischen historisch spezifischem Akkumulationsregime, der oeweils dominanten Regulationsweise und institutionellen Formen keine ausreichenden Kriterien für die Beurteilung der Relevanz bestimmter Entwicklungen. Analyse verlangt Erklärungen für das Zustandekommen konkreter Korrespondenzen. Wenn sich Strategien transnationaler Unternehmen auf transnationale Institutionen richten und wir in und um dieselben zunehmende „Verdichtungen“ beobachten können, so ist deren jeweilige Bedeutung für die Reproduktion kapitalistischer Verhältnisse noch keineswegs erwiesen. Konkret und banal formuliert: wir können uns einen Kapitalismus ohne WTO und IWF vorstellen, nicht aber, ohne Staatsmacht.17 Falls Regulationstheoretiker/innen die These vertreten wollen, dass auch letzteres möglich sei, es zwischen den „Verdichtungen“ also keine systematisch zu klärenden Unterschiede gibt, so wäre es an der Zeit, diese These auszuführen. Geschieht dies nicht, besteht die Gefahr, dass die theoretische Basis zwar hinreicht, um Globalisierung, nicht aber um Kapitalismus zu kritisieren (so auch Wood 2003: 137-142). 4. Kapitalismus und kapitalistische Staaten Die historische Konstitution kapitalistischer Geopolitik Weder in der Ableitungsdebatte noch in den heftigen wissenschaftlichen und politischen Auseinandersetzungen über „bürgerliche Revolutionen“, die in den 1960er und 1970er Jahren in England und Frankreich brodelten, stand die Geopolitik des Kapitalismus systematisch zur Debatte. In dominanten marxistischen Interpretationen wurde unterstellt, aus der Entwicklung des Kapitalismus sei die Möglichkeit (oder auch Notwendigkeit) einer Revolutionierung der Herrschaftsverhältnisse in umgrenzten Territorien erwachsen. Trotz der Hinweise auf internationalen Handel und koloniale Eroberungen wurde also unterstellt, Staat und Gesellschaft befänden sich auf demselben Territorium (kritisch: Holloway 2002: 115). Da die Frage nach dem historischen Konstitutionszusammenhang als prinzipiell geklärt galt, konnte sie auf die Frage nach den Charakteristika der jeweiligen Sonderwege reduziert werden. Während Analysen im Anschluss an die von Max Weber entwickelten Theoriekonzepte für Kapitalismus und Staatsapparate unterschiedliche organisatorische cluster und folglich Dynamiken unterstellen, und die Herausbildung von Nationalstaaten durch eine Mischung von „Krieg und Diplomatie“ erklären (vgl. Giddens 1985: 141, 264), wurde in kapitalismuskritischen Diskussionen über die Transformation vom Feudalismus zum Kapitalismus internationalen Entwicklungen keine systematische Bedeutung zugeschrieben. Während viele diese Tradition fortsetzten, bis die verstärkte Internationalisierung des Kapitalismus neue Fragestellungen unabweisbar machte, hat Wallerstein bereits 1974 einen Vorschlag für eine systematische Analyse des „Modern World-System“ vorgelegt.18 Ihm galt die Ausweitung des kommerziellen Systems seit der zweiten Hälfte des 16. Jahrhunderts nicht nur als Anfang des Kapitalismus, sondern auch als Ursache des modernen europäischen Staates. Im Zuge der von Europa ausgehenden Expansion sei „der Staat“ an die Stelle der historisch vorgängigen Herrschaft von Prinzen getreten. Zu dieser Veränderung sei es gekommen, weil die „Konzentration von Kapital in den Zentren sowohl die finanzielle Basis als auch die politische Motivation [schuf], starke Staatsapparate zu gründen, die unter vielen anderen die Fähigkeit hatten, sicherzustellen, daß die Staatsapparate peripherer Zonen relativ schwächer wurden und blieben“ (1974: 27). Der „moderne Staat“ betritt die historische Bühne hier also gewissermaßen als ideeller Gesamtkapitalist des Kaufmannskapitals. Damit unterschlägt Wallerstein sowohl die Konstitutionsbedingungen für die Praxis von Herrschaft in vorbürgerlichen Territorialstaaten als auch die konkreten Bedingungen für Aneignungsstrategien von Kaufleuten.19 Letztere erforderten nicht in erster Linie Expansion, sondern eine Verteidigung privilegierter Aneignungschancen gegen alle potentiellen Neuzugänge.20 Wallerstein zufolge bewirkte die staatlich vorangetriebene Ausweitung des internationalen Handelssystems eine hierarchisch strukturierte internationale Arbeitsteilung. Anfänglich hätten in diesem kapitalistischen Weltsystem noch unterschiedliche Produktionsverhältnisse existiert. Dessen innere Dynamik habe aber schließlich zur Dominanz von Lohnarbeitsverhältnissen und zu Massenproduktion geführt. Anders gesagt: ab einer gewissen kritischen Masse ist Wallerstein zufolge das kommerzielle System in ein kapitalistisches Weltsystem umgeschlagen. An der Struktur des „ungleichen Tauschs“ zwischen dem Zentrum, der Semiperipherie und der Peripherie habe sich seither ebenso wenig geändert wie an der Funktion von Staaten des Zentrums (und der Semiperipherie), diese Verhältnisse abzusichern. Sowohl der Kapitalismusbegriff Wallersteins als auch seine historischen Ausführungen sind inzwischen vielfach kritisiert worden (insbesondere durch Brenner 1983). Sein Verdienst bleibt es jedoch, die Geopolitik der historischen Transformationsprozesse zur Diskussion gestellt zu haben. Seither hat diese Diskussion durch eine Arbeit von Justin Rosenberg (1994) neuen Auftrieb erhalten. Sie war gegen die Annahme einer überhistorisch gleichbleibenden politischen Dynamik der Konkurrenz zwischen Staaten gerichtet, wie sie von Vertreter/innen der sogenannten realistischen Theorie internationaler Beziehungen unterstellt wird. Zwar sei das Staatensystem nicht durch den Kapitalismus geschaffen worden, doch habe sich die Dynamik der welthistorischen Entwicklung seither grundlegend verändert. Denn durch die für kapitalistische Gesellschaften strukturprägende Trennung von öffentlicher und privater Sphäre sei die Dynamik historischer Entwicklungen in die Sphäre der privaten Kapitalbeziehungen verlagert worden. Souveräne Einzelstaaten seien jetzt systematische Elemente des kapitalistischen Empire (ebd. 172). Benno Teschke hat diesen kritischen Ansatz nicht nur weiter ausgeführt, sondern - anders als Rosenberg - auch eine Erklärung für die Transformationsprozesse vorgelegt (2003, 2005, 2006b). Während in einer auf agrarischer Produktion basierenden Wirtschaft die Erweiterung der Akkumulation territoriale Ausdehnung erforderte, folglich Krieg zum zentralen Mittel der Akkumulation gemacht habe, sei diese ökonomische Strukturnotwendigkeit bewaffneter Konkurrenz mit der Durchsetzung des Kapitalismus überwunden worden. Letztere sei zuerst in England mögli ch geworden, weil siele hier nicht jene Form politischer Aneignung durchgesetzt habe, die für den Absolutismus auf dem Festland kennzeichnend gewesen sei. In diesen AEeignungsformen sei keine autonome Entwicklung kapitalistischer Verhältnisse möglich gewesen. Dagegen sei Kapitalismus in England aus einer inneren Dynamik heraus entstanden. Deshalb sei hier auch die Transformation dynastischer Staatsgewalt in moderne abstrakte Souveränität ohne externe Einwirkung möglich geworden (Teschke, 2005).21 Alle anderen Transformationsprozesse seien bereits Reaktionen auf die internationale Vormachtstellung Englands gewesen. Diese Vormachtstellung sei zunächst noch militärisch und diplomatisch, dann aber vor allem mittels Freihandel durchgesetzt und verteidigt worden. Damit habe sich die nicht-territoriale Logik der internationalen Aneignung von Mehrwert durchgesetzt (2003: 263). Teschkes Erklärung hat einen doppelten Vorzug: sie setzt die Logik dynastischen Machtstrebens nicht vorschnell mit der Logik des Kaufmannskapitals in eins und sie betont den grundsätzlich internationalen Charakter des Kapitalismus. Doch bleibt die Erklärung der politischen Form bürgerlicher Staaten ausgeklammert.”翻译为中文","output":"自从国家分析被纳入调节理论框架并因而宣称政治在分析社会过程中具有“首要地位”（Hirsch 2005：57）以来，精确的经济分析却变得相对难觅。这不仅没有回答 Müller/Neusüß 在派生辩论开始时提出的关于改革限制与新霸权项目之间关系的问题，而且这个问题再次没有被提出。同时，假设特定历史积累体制、主导的调节方式和制度形式之间存在一般对应关系，也没有提供足够的标准来评估特定发展的相关性。分析要求解释具体对应关系是如何形成的。当跨国公司的策略针对跨国机构，并且我们能在这些机构周围观察到日益增加的“凝聚”时，它们各自对资本主义关系的再生产的重要性还远未得到证实。简单而平凡地说：我们可以想象一个没有WTO和IMF的资本主义，但不能想象一个没有国家权力的资本主义。如果调节理论家要主张后者也是可能的，也就是说，这些“凝聚”之间没有需要系统澄清的区别，那么现在是时候阐述这一论点了。如果不这样做，就有可能只足以批评全球化，而不足以批评资本主义的理论基础（参见Wood 2003：137-142）。 # 4. 资本主义和资本主义国家 资本主义地缘政治的历史构建 无论是在派生辩论还是在20世纪60年代和70年代在英格兰和法国激烈的科学和政治争论中，“资产阶级革命”都没有系统地讨论资本主义的地缘政治。在主流的马克思主义解释中，认为资本主义的发展产生了在有限领土上革命化统治关系的可能性（或必要性）。尽管提到了国际贸易和殖民征服，但假设国家和社会位于同一领土上（批评性地见Holloway 2002：115）。由于认为历史构建背景的问题原则上已经解决，所以将其简化为查询每个特殊路径的特征的问题。尽管在继承自马克思·韦伯的理论概念下对资本主义和国家机构的分析假设了不同的组织群体以及因而产生的动力，并通过“战争和外交”的混合解释了民族国家的形成（参见Giddens 1985：141, 264），但在批判资本主义的讨论中对从封建主义向资本主义的转变中的国际发展没有赋予系统性的重要性。虽然许多人继续这一传统，直到资本主义的加强国际化促使新的问题议题变得不可回避，但Wallerstein在1974年就提出了对“现代世界系统”的系统分析的提议。他认为自16世纪下半叶以来商业系统的扩张不仅是资本主义的开端，也是现代欧洲国家的原因。在欧洲的扩张过程中，“国家”取代了历史上先于王公统治的统治形式。这一变化发生的原因是，“资本在中心的集中既提供了财政基础，也提供了政治动机，建立强大的国家机构， 确保周边地区的国家机构相对较弱并保持较弱”（1974: 27）。因此，“现代国家”在这里以某种方式作为商人资本的理想总资本家登上历史舞台。Wallerstein既忽视了前资产阶级领土国家中统治实践的构建条件，也忽视了商人的征用策略的具体条件。后者并不首先需要扩张，而是需要防御所有潜在新进入者的特权征用机会。 根据Wallerstein，国家主导的国际贸易系统的扩展导致了国际分工的层次结构。最初，这个资本主义世界系统中还存在不同的生产关系。但其内部动力最终导致了工资劳动关系和大规模生产的占主导地位。换言之，根据Wallerstein，一旦达到某个临界质量，商业系统就转变为一个资本主义世界系统。自那时以来，中心、半边缘和边缘之间的“不平等交换”结构以及中心国家（和半边缘）国家的功能，即保障这些关系，就没有发生变化。Wallerstein的资本主义概念及其历史陈述已经被多次批评（特别是Brenner 1983）。然而，他将历史转型过程的地缘政治议题引入讨论的功绩仍然存在。 此后，Justin Rosenberg（1994）的一项工作为这一讨论带来了新的动力。它针对的是那些被所谓的国际关系现实主义理论代表所假设的、在国家间竞争的超历史恒定政治动力的假设。尽管国家体系并非由资本主义创造，但自那时以来，世界历史发展的动力学已经发生了根本变化。因为通过公共和私人领域的结构性分离，历史发展的动力已被转移到私人资本关系领域。主权国家现在成为资本主义帝国的系统性元素（同上172）。 Benno Teschke不仅进一步发展了这种批评性方法，而且与Rosenberg不同——还提出了转型过程的解释（2003, 2005, 2006b）。在一个基于农业生产的经济中，积累的扩张要求领土扩张，因此战争成为积累的主要手段，这种经济结构的武装竞争必然性随着资本主义的确立而被克服。后者首先在英格兰成为可能，因为在这里并没有实现大陆上绝对主义所特有的那种政治征用形式。在这些征用形式中，资本主义关系的自主发展是不可能的。相反，资本主义在英格兰是从内在动力中产生的。因此，在这里也可能在没有外部影响的情况下，将王朝国家权力转变为现代抽象主权（Teschke，2005）。所有其他的转型过程都已经是对英格兰国际主导地位的反应。这种主导地位最初是通过军事和外交手段，然后主要通过自由贸易来实施和维护的。这样就确立了国际非领土性征用剩余价值的逻辑（2003：263）。Teschke的解释有两个优点：它没有草率地将王朝权力追求的逻辑与商人资本的逻辑混为一谈，并强调了资本主义的根本国际特性。但是，对资产阶级国家的政治形式的解释仍然被排除在外。"},{"instruction":"请将“Sie lässt sich eben nicht nur ganz allgemein aus Klassenverhältnissen als Machtkonstellationen erklären, sondern nur aus vorgängigen Prozessen der Rationalisierung, Säkularisierung, Individualisierung und aller weiteren spezifischen Veränderungen personaler Herrschaft, die sich in den europäischen Territorialherrschaften in der Epoche des Anden Regime vollzogen hatten und die damit zu historischen Voraussetzungen für die Konstitution bürgerlicher kapitalistischer Staaten wurden. Die historische Dynamik kapitalistischer Geopolitik In klassischen marxistischen Imperialismustheorien dominierte ein Verständnis des Kapitalismus als einer „inter-nationalen“ Wirtschaftsform.22 Durchgängig wurden nationale Produktion und nationale Zirkulation von internationaler Zirkulation unterschieden (kritisch: v. Braunmühl 1974: 30). Dabei wurde letztere als zunehmend erforderlich für die Reproduktion des Kapitalismus verstanden. Aus dieser Dynamik wurde auf eine Verschärfung der Konkurrenz unter nationalen Kapitalen mit der möglichen Folge von Krieg geschlossen. Vor diesem Hintergrund wurde auch Kolonialpolitik interpretiert. Auf der Basis eingehender historischer Untersuchungen sind diese Interpretationen inzwischen kritisiert und die Ansichten jener zeitgenössischen Kritiker bestätigt worden, die bereits zur Hochzeit formeller Kolonialpolitik auf deren volkswirtschaftliche Kosten verwiesen hatten. Unter Historikern, die sich mit dieser Periode befassen, besteht heute weitgehende Einigkeit darüber, dass das Leid und der langfristige politische sowie ökonomische Schaden, den formelle Kolonialherrschaft für die unterworfenen Menschen mit sich brachte, nicht gleichzeitig bedeutete, dass sie den „nationalen Kapitalen“ von Industriegesellschaften förderlich war. Individuellen Kapitaleignern eröffneten sich neue Chancen des Profits, individuellen Staatsbeamten, einschließlich der Militärs, eröffneten sich neue Chancen der Karriere, Siedlern eröffneten sich Chancen auf Wohlstand, aber „nationale Kapitale“ fanden kaum neue Absatzgebiete. Paul Bairoch, dem wir die genauesten Schätzungen für die Entwicklung des Weltmarkts verdanken, gibt an, dass in der Phase von 1800 bis 1938 lediglich zwischen 0,6% und 0,9% der industriellen Produktion der Industriegesellschaften in die Kolonien exportiert wurden (Bairoch 1971: 221f.). Tatsächlich ist die begrenzte Bedeutung der Kolonien als Absatzmärkte für Industriegesellschaften noch sehr viel deutlicher als es diese Durchschnittswerte vermuten lassen, denn diese enthalten auch die untypisch hohen Ausfuhren Großbri-tanniens in die eigenen Kolonien.23 Pierre-Noel Giraud (1996, 135) hat die neuere historische Forschung zur ökonomischen Bedeutung der Kolonialpolitik in der These zusammengefasst, dass ihre wichtigste Bedeutung darin bestanden habe, die Ansätze einer kapitalistischen Entwicklung, die es dort zuvor gegeben habe, zu unterbinden. Diese - hier nur angedeuteten - Ergebnisse machen deutlich, welcher immense Aufwand an empirischer Forschung notwendig sein kann, wenn es darum gehen soll, die realen Wirkungen praktizierter Akkumulationsstrategien zu ermitteln. Anders als in klassischen Imperialismustheorien wird der Einsatz staatlicher Gewaltmittel zur geographischen Erweiterung des Verwertungsraumes heute zumeist auch rückwirkend nicht mehr als strukturnotwendig betrachtet. Besonders deutlich ist diese Position zu wiederholten Malen von Ellen Meiksins Wood formuliert worden. Ihr gelten derartige Strategien als Ausdruck vorkapitalistischer Verhältnisse. Sie seien durch jene neuartige Form von Imperialismus abgelöst worden, die der Kapitalismus hervorgebracht habe: den „ökonomischen Imperialismus“ (2006: 17 und passim). Es handle sich um ein „Empire of Capital“ (so der Titel von Wood 2003). Daraus folgt für Wood allerdings nicht, dass kapitalistische Akkumulation je unabhängig von Staatsgewalt möglich war oder - wie Hardt/Negri fälschlich meinen (2000: 307 und passim) - heute möglich geworden sei. „The state lies at the very heart of the new global order“ (Wood 2003: 139). Der Schutz des Privateigentums, die alltägliche Stabilität des Systems, die Disziplinierung von Arbeitskräften, all dies seien durchgängige Voraussetzungen kapitalistischer Akkumulation. Die politische Erweiterung territorialer Herrschaft aber zähle nicht zu diesen Voraussetzungen (so auch Teschke 2003: 263). Die Geopolitik des Kapitalismus in der Epoche der Globalisierung Seit dem Ende der Blockkonfrontation dominieren die USA im global erweiterten Kapitalismus ökonomisch, politisch und militärisch.24 Das hat Interpretationen veranlasst, die eine allgemeine Natur von Imperien mit jeweils besonderen historischen Ausprägungen unterstellen (z. B. Münkler 2005). Wood (2002, 2006) und Teschke (2006) haben derartige Ansätze besonders deutlich kritisiert. Sie seien jenem traditionellen Konzept von international relations verhaftet, das nur auf Beziehungen zwischen Staaten abstellt. Damit könne der grundlegende historische Strukturwandel, den die Durchsetzung des Kapitalismus bedeutet habe, gar nicht in den Blick kommen. Denn - anders als in allen vorhergehenden historischen Epochen - sei harte Geopolitik seither nicht länger eine strukturelle Voraussetzung für Akkumulationsstrategien. Nun hat es im Kapitalismus nicht nur früher Kriege gegeben, es gibt sie auch heute noch. Wenn also nicht doch einer Konzeption der Autonomie des Politi- sehen durch die Hintertür Eintritt gewährt werden soll, so muss dieser Sachverhalt erklärt werden. Wood bietet eine derartige Erklärung an. Die Anforderung an Politik bestehe darin, eine internationale Ordnung zu schaffen, die „congenial“ für die Bewegungen des Kapitals im Weltmaßstab ist (Wood 2006: 26). Es geht also um eine „Ordnung“, die es Kapitalen überall auf der Welt erleichtert, immer mehr Sphären des Lebens den Gesetzen des Marktes zu unterwerfen (ebd.: 21). Wood zufolge ist die Durchsetzung und Wahrung einer solchen Ordnung vor allem ein „militärisches Projekt“. Allerdings gehe es beim heutigen Einsatz von Militär nicht um konkrete Kriegsziele, angestrebt werde vielmehr die Demonstration der Dominanz. Ziel sei es, „to oversee the whole global system and to assert a general predominance“ (ebd.: 27). Politisch wirke sich das aber so aus, dass in erster Linie eine spezifisch militärische Logik zum Tragen komme. Am Beispiel des Irak-Kriegs erläutert sie diese These. Ihrer Ansicht nach haben die ölproduzierenden Länder des Nahen Ostens keinerlei Interesse, irgend jemand den Zugang zu ihrer Ware zu verweigern, der bereit ist, den geforderten Preis zu zahlen (ebd.: 27). Militär werde eben nicht eingesetzt, um den Zugriff auf Ölvorräte zu sichern, sondern um generelle Vorherrschaft zu etablieren, gewissermaßen eine Ober-aufsicht über das globale System. Die Militarisierung von Politik lässt sich aber auch anhand offizieller Verlautbarungen der Regierungen der USA verfolgen. In dem „Bottom Up Review“, den der Verteidigungsminister Les Aspen 1993 dem Kongress vorlegte, wurde als Zielsetzung der Verteidigungspolitik nach dem Kalten Krieg jedenfalls sehr deutlich eine militärische Unterstützung der politischen und ökonomischen Macht der USA und - ganz konkret - die Sorge für „healthy free trade“ formuliert (www. fas.org/man/docs/index.html). In der 1997 veröffentlichten Sicherheitsstrategie „für ein neues Jahrhundert“ (www.fas.org/man/docs/strategy97.htm) wurden den „shape“ und „prepare“ Funktionen des Militärs weitere Bedeutung eingeräumt und die Orientierung an potentiellen Bedrohungen verstärkt. „Unser vordringliches ökonomisches Ziel bleibt die Stärkung der Amerikanischen Wirtschaft“ heißt es in diesem Dokument zur Militärstrategie. Indem diese Strategien von den Mitgliedsstaaten der NATO akzeptiert wurden, haben sie diese Verteidigungsorganisation aus der Zeit des Kalten Krieges in eine Organisation zum militärischen Management aktueller und potentieller Krisen verwandelt. Militärmacht soll jetzt auch zur „Verteidigung“ gegen die mögliche (!) Gefährdung ökonomischer, politischer und ökologischer Interessen der Mitgliedsstaaten eingesetzt werden.25”翻译为中文","output":"它不能仅仅从一般的阶级关系作为权力构架来解释，而只能从先前的理性化、世俗化、个体化过程以及所有其他特定的个人统治变化中解释，这些变化发生在安息日制度时期的欧洲领土统治中，并因此成为资产阶级资本主义国家宪法的历史前提。 资本主义地缘政治的历史动态 在经典的马克思主义帝国主义理论中，资本主义被理解为一种“国际”经济形态。国家生产和国家流通被与国际流通区分开来（批评性地见：v. Braunmühl 1974: 30），并且后者被理解为对资本主义再生产日益必需。从这一动态中推断出国家资本之间的竞争可能加剧，可能导致战争。 在这个背景下，殖民政策也被解释。基于深入的历史研究，这些解释现在已被批评，证实了那些当时正处于正式殖民政策全盛期的批评者的观点，他们曾指出殖民政策的国民经济成本。今天，那些研究这一时期的历史学家普遍同意，正式殖民统治给被征服人民带来的苦难、长期政治和经济损害，并不意味着它对工业社会的“国家资本”有利。个别资本所有者获得了新的利润机会，个别国家官员（包括军人）获得了新的职业机会，移民获得了致富的机会，但“国家资本”几乎没有找到新的销售市场。据我们对世界市场发展最精确的估计者保罗·贝罗克（Paul Bairoch）称，从1800年到1938年，工业社会的工业生产中只有0.6%到0.9%被出口到了殖民地（Bairoch 1971: 221f）。实际上，殖民地作为工业社会的销售市场的有限重要性比这些平均值暗示的还要明显得多，因为这些包括了英国对其殖民地的非典型高出口量。皮埃尔-诺埃尔·吉罗（Pierre-Noel Giraud）（1996, 135）总结了新近的历史研究关于殖民政策经济意义的观点，指出其最重要的意义在于阻止了此前可能存在的资本主义发展的开端。这些——仅仅是暗示的——结果表明，要确定实践中的积累战略的真实影响可能需要大量的实证研究。 与经典帝国主义理论不同，今天通常也不再将国家使用武力手段进行地理扩张视为结构必需。埃伦·迈辛斯·伍德（Ellen Meiksins Wood）多次明确表达了这一立场。她认为这样的战略是前资本主义关系的表现，已被资本主义产生的新型帝国主义所取代：“经济帝国主义”（2006: 17及频繁）。它是一个“资本帝国”（如伍德2003年作品标题）。然而，对伍德来说，这并不意味着资本主义积累曾经或者——如哈特/内格里（Hardt/Negri）错误地认为的——现在可能独立于国家权力。“国家是新全球秩序的核心”（伍德2003：139）。保护私有财产、系统的日常稳定、劳动力的纪律化，这些都是资本主义积累持续的前提。但领土统治的政治扩张不属于这些前提（也见Teschke 2003：263）。 全球化时代的资本主义地缘政治 自从冷战结束以来，美国在全球扩展的资本主义中在经济、政治和军事上占主导地位。这促成了一些解释，它们假设了帝国的一般性质和各自的特定历史表现形式（例如，默克尔2005）。伍德（2002, 2006）和特什克（Teschke）（2006）尤其明确批评了这些方法。他们认为这些方法受到了传统国际关系概念的限制，该概念仅关注国家之间的关系。因此，它们无法领会到资本主义实施所意味的基本历史结构变革。因为——与以往所有历史时期不同——自那时以来，硬地缘政治不再是积累战略的结构前提。 尽管资本主义过去曾经发生过战争，现在仍然如此。因此，如果不想通过后门重新接纳政治的自主性概念，就必须解释这一事实。伍德提供了这样的解释。 政治的要求在于创造一种国际秩序，这种秩序对于全球范围内资本的流动是“适宜的”（伍德 2006：26）。因此，这是一种“秩序”，它使资本能够更容易地将生活的更多领域纳入市场法则之下（同上：21）。据伍德称，维护这种秩序主要是一个“军事项目”。然而，今天军事的使用并不是为了具体的战争目标，而是旨在展示支配地位。目标是“监督整个全球系统并断言一般的优势”（同上：27）。政治上，这意味着首先是一种特定的军事逻辑得以体现。她用伊拉克战争来阐明这一论点。她认为，中东石油生产国对于任何愿意支付要价的人来说都没有兴趣拒绝提供他们的商品（同上：27）。军队的使用并不是为了确保获得石油资源，而是为了确立一般的主导地位，可以说是对全球系统的最高监督。 但政治的军事化也可以通过美国政府的官方声明来追踪。美国国防部长莱斯·阿斯彭（Les Aspen）在1993年向国会提交的“自下而上的审查”中，将美国冷战后防御政策的目标明确定义为军事支持美国的政治和经济力量，以及——非常具体地——关心“健康的自由贸易”（www. fas.org/man/docs/index.html）。在1997年发布的“新世纪安全战略”中（www.fas.org/man/docs/strategy97.htm），军事的“塑造”和“准备”功能被赋予了更多的重要性，强调面对潜在威胁的定位。“我们的首要经济目标仍然是加强美国经济”，这份关于军事战略的文件如是说。通过北约成员国接受这些战略，它们已经将这个冷战时期的防御组织转变为一个用于军事管理当前和潜在危机的组织。军事力量现在也被用来“防御”可能（！）危及成员国经济、政治和生态利益的威胁。"},{"instruction":"请将“Eine derart militärische Herstellung von „Rahmenbedingungen“ des Marktgeschehens26 bedeutet keinen Rückfall in Strategien der territorialen Expansion formaler Herrschaft, ver- langt meines Erachtens aber dennoch eine neuerliche Diskussion über die These des „Empire of Capital“, wie sie von Rosenberg, Teschke und Wood vertreten wird. Entweder die deutliche Militarisierung von Politik ist eine Verarbeitung von Schwierigkeiten der Kapitalreproduktion oder aber eine lediglich politisch verfolgte Strategie. Im ersten Fall ist die durchgängig gleichartige Struktur des kapitalistischen Imperialismus zu hinterfragen, im zweiten die prinzipielle Kritik einer Autonomie von Politik. Beide Antworten ließen sich mit der von Wood vorgelegten allgemeinen Theorie kapitalistischer Staatsgewalt vereinbaren. Ihr gilt Staat - und sie meint damit eindeutig „Nationalstaat“ - als einzige nicht-ökonomische Institution, die für den Kapitalismus unverzichtbar ist (2003: 139). Für diese These spielt die sonst oft angeführte Autonomie des Staates gegenüber einzelkapitalistischen Interessen keine Rolle. Im Zentrum ihrer Staatsanalyse steht eine Konzeption der formalen Trennung des Politischen vom Ökonomischen, die den Staat befähigt, die Reproduktion kapitalistischer Eigentumsverhältnisse institutionell, rechtlich und notfalls mittels Einsatz von Staatsgewalt abzusichern. Zwar sei die ökonomische Reichweite des Kapitals heute größer als jemals zuvor, größer vor allem als seine territorial fixierte politische Form, nach wie vor aber sei kapitalistische Akkumulation auf einen Staat angewiesen, der - „at arms length“ agierend - jene administrative Ordnung schafft und jene ultimative Zwangsgewalt zur Verfügung stellt, die das Kapital braucht, selbst aber nicht hat (2003: 24). Damit richtet sie sich ausdrücklich auch gegen die kritische Umkehrung von dominanten Konzepten der „global governance“. Während deren sozialdemokratisch und neoliberal orientierte Befürworter/innen erwarten, dass transnationale Probleme mittels transnationaler Institutionen bewältigt werden können (vgl. zur Debatte Brand et al 2000), sehen viele Globalisierungskritiker sie als die verdichteten Zentren kapitalistischer Macht. Das, meint Wood, sei aber nicht nur theoretisch falsch, sondern auch politisch fatal. Denn damit werde verkannt, dass der Nationalstaat auch heute noch das wichtigste Terrain für kapitalismuskritische Opposition bilden müsse (2003: 137-143). In dieser Einschätzung unterscheidet sie sich deutlich von Harvey, für den IWF, Weltbank und WTO zwar etwas „schattenhafte“, aber doch staatsähnliche Institutionen sind (2006: 159). Für Harvey ist ein formal besonderter Staat nicht etwa Strukturvoraussetzung kapitalistischer Akkumulation, wohl aber ein bürgerlicher Staat, „die favorisierte Bedingung für kapitalistische Aktivität“ (2005: 92). Diese Bedingungen werden aufgezählt: abgesicherte Marktinstitutionen und Vertragsregeln, Regulierungen, die Klassenkonflikte in Schach halten, Schlichtung zwischen verschiedenen Fraktionen des Kapitals, Sicherheit der Geldliquidität, eine Strukturierung von Außenbeziehungen, die Geschäftsaktivitäten förderlich sind (ebd.: 92f.). Die theoretische Konzeption einer formalen Trennung von außerökonomischer und ökonomischer Macht, wie sie von Wood vertreten wird, ist nicht dar- unter. Harvey zufolge geht sie schon deshalb in die Irre, weil „wir überall von ‘public private partnerships’ und einer unglaublichen gegenseitig Durchdringung von Staat und Kapitalpraktiken umgeben sind“ (2006: 159).27 Die Analyse des kapitalistischen Staates ist hier also auf die Benennung seiner Funktionen begrenzt. Von daher lässt sich dann auch leichter denken, dass Staatsmacht heute nur noch bedingt an den Territorialstaat gebunden ist.28 Harvey kritisiert das Konzept der formalen Separation, betont seinerseits aber eine Differenz zwischen der „Logik des Territoriums“ und der „Logik des Kapitals“ (2005: 39ff.). Allerdings bezieht sich Harveys theoretisches Konzept des „spatio-temporal fix“ (früher benutzte er den Terminus „spatial-fix“) nicht etwa auf den Staat, vielmehr wird die „raum-zeitliche-Fixierung“ als ein zentrales Element der Logik des Kapitals ausgemacht. Es handelt sich um die räumliche Dimension von Konkurrenzprozessen (Harvey 1982; 1989; 2001; 2003). Dass Standortvorteile genutzt werden (müssen), wo immer sie sich bieten, ergibt sich aus der durchgängigen Tendenz zur Überakkumulation. Die Erschließung der Vorteile, die sich in neuen Räumen bieten, hat für Harvey theoretisch die selbe Bedeutung wie die Nutzung neuer Technologien (2003: 96). Es handelt sich also gewissermaßen um eine geographisch gewendete Theorie des Schum- peter’schen Pionierprofites. Damit ist auch schon deutlich, dass mit dem Hinweis auf räumliche Fixierung nicht etwa die Notwendigkeit zur Expansion beständiger Herrschaft gemeint ist, sondern, ganz im Gegenteil, die Notwendigkeit, eine ständige Mobilität des Kapitals im Raum zu ermöglichen (vgl. dazu auch Belina 2006: 59f.). Allerdings gibt es nicht nur politische, sondern auch „gewichtige“ kapitalistische „Hemmschuhe“ gegen den ständigen geographischen Wandel, denn viele Investitionen haben spezifische Infrastrukturen zur Voraussetzung, viele erfordern ein Beträchtliches an räumlich fixiertem konstan- tem Kapital (2003: 101). Dessen dauerhafte ökonomische Nutzung ist nicht nur ökonomischen, sondern auch politischen bis hin zu terroristischen Bedrohungen ausgesetzt, weshalb denn auch die „geographische Landschaft kapitalistischer Aktivität“ prinzipiell instabil bleibt (ebd.: 102). Dennoch sind Harvey zufolge zeitweise stabile geographische Konfigurationen möglich. Er bezeichnet sie als „Regionen“. Ihr Kennzeichen ist „ein gewisses Maß an strukturierter Geschlossenheit in Produktion, Distribution, Tausch und Konsum“ (ebd.: 103). Das wirft die von Harvey selbst formulierte Frage auf: „In welcher Beziehung steht diese sich herausbildende Regionalität, zu der es durch die in Raum und Zeit ablaufenden molekularen Prozesse der Kapitalakkumulation kommt, zur territorialen Logik der Macht, wie sie sich in der Politik des Staates und des Territoriums ausdrückt?“ (Ebd.: 105). Harvey zufolge haben die beiden Entwicklungsdynamiken nicht notwendig etwas miteinander zu tun.29 Zwar gibt es Verknüpfungen und eine prinzipiell dialektische Beziehung zwischen der Logik des Staates und der Logik des Kapitals, dennoch handelt es sich nicht um eine Einheit. Das reicht weiter als die Annahme einer gewissen Autonomie. Vielmehr ähnelt Harveys Argumentationen jenen theoretischen Konzeptionen, die den Anspruch erheben, für überhistorische Analysen gültig zu sein. Die Besonderheit einer Epoche wird dann als die jeweilige Verbindung einer „Logik der Macht“ mit der spezifischen Logik der gerade herrschenden Produktionsweise erklärt (vgl. etwa Mann 1986). Und tatsächlich gibt es bei Harvey zwar eingehende Analysen aktueller imperialistischer Politik und theoretisch stringente Analysen der Kapitalverwertung, aber keine Diskussion über eine womöglich kapitalismusspezifische territoriale Logik. Wenn er schreibt, „Der Imperialismus kapitalistischer Prägung“ entstehe aus einer dialektischen Beziehung zwischen der territorialen und der kapitalistischen Logik der Macht (2003: 179), so kaschiert auch hier der Hinweis auf Dialektik - wie schon so oft in der Tradition marxistischer Theorieproduktion - den Verzicht auf eine präzise Analyse der Beziehungen. Für seine konkreten Analysen spielt die These von der unterschiedlichen Logik territorialer und kapitalistischer Macht allerdings keine Rolle.30 Das gilt auch für die Analyse der jüngsten historischen Entwicklung, die er als „neuen Imperia-lismus“ kennzeichnet (2003). Im Zentrum stehen die Ursachen der neoliberalen Hegemonie der USA in der Zeit von 1970 bis 2000 und die „ernsthaften Schwierigkeiten“, in welche diese Hegemonie neuerdings geraten ist (ebd.: 73). Von den USA ausgehend und durch die Politik des IWF nachdrücklich befördert, habe sich das Modell des „neoliberalen Staates“, also eines Staates, der Kapitalverwertung fördert, in der Welt verbreitet. Staaten, die dem nicht entsprechen, werden als „Schurkenstaaten“ oder „failed states“ charakterisiert (ebd.: 180). Ökonomisch läuft Neoliberalismus Harvey zufolge auf Akkumulation durch Enteignung hinaus. Er versteht dieses Konzept als Fortsetzung und teilweise Revision des Marx’schen Konzeptes der „ursprünglichen Akkumulation“.”翻译为中文","output":"这种军事制定的“市场背景条件”并不意味着回归到正式统治的领土扩张策略，但我认为这仍然需要重新讨论罗森堡、特斯克和伍德所代表的“资本帝国”论点。政治的明显军事化要么是资本再生产困难的处理方式，要么仅仅是一个政治策略。在第一种情况下，需要质疑资本主义帝国主义的一致结构；在第二种情况下，需要质疑政治自主性的原则性批评。 这两个回答都与伍德提出的资本主义国家政权的一般理论相兼容。对她而言，国家——她明确指的是“民族国家”——是资本主义不可或缺的唯一非经济机构（2003：139）。对于这个论点，国家相对于单个资本利益的自治并不重要。她的国家分析的核心是政治与经济的正式分离的概念，这使得国家能够通过制度、法律，必要时通过国家权力的使用，确保资本主义财产关系的再生产。尽管资本的经济范围今天比以往任何时候都要大，特别是比它的政治形态固定的领土范围要大，资本主义积累仍然依赖于一个能够进行“一定距离”操作的国家，提供资本需要但自身没有的那种行政秩序和终极强制力（2003: 24）。因此，她也明确反对那些主张“全球治理”的流行概念的批判性逆转。尽管其社会民主和新自由主义的支持者期望通过跨国机构解决跨国问题（参见 Brand 等 2000 的讨论），许多全球化批评者将它们视为资本主义权力的密集中心。伍德认为，这不仅在理论上是错误的，而且在政治上是灾难性的。因为这忽视了国家至今仍是资本主义批评性反对的最重要战场（2003: 137-143）。 在这一评估中，她与哈维有明显不同，对于哈维来说，IMF、世界银行和WTO虽然有些“影子一般”，但却是类似国家的机构（2006: 159）。对于哈维而言，一个特殊的国家并不是资本主义积累的结构前提，而是一个资产阶级国家，“资本主义活动的首选条件”（2005: 92）。这些条件被列举出来：确保的市场机构和合同规则、保持阶级冲突得到控制的规定、在不同的资本派别之间进行仲裁、确保货币流动性安全、构建有利于商业活动的外部关系结构（同上：92f）。伍德所代表的政治与经济力量之间正式分离的理论构想不在其中。根据哈维的说法，这是一个错误的方向，因为“我们到处都能看到‘公私合营伙伴关系’以及国家与资本实践的惊人互相渗透”（2006: 159）。因此，对资本主义国家的分析在这里仅限于指出其功能。因此，也更容易认为，如今国家权力只在有限的范围内与领土国家相挂钩。 哈维批评了正式分离的概念，但自己强调了“领土逻辑”与“资本逻辑”之间的区别（2005: 39ff）。然而，哈维的“空间-时间固定”理论概念（他以前使用了“空间固定”术语）并不是指国家，而是将“空间-时间固定”视为资本逻辑的核心要素。这关乎竞争过程的空间维度（哈维1982；1989；2001；2003）。利用具有优势的地点是源于过度积累的普遍趋势。利用新空间提供的优势，对哈维而言，理论上与利用新技术同等重要（2003: 96）。因此，这在某种意义上是一个地理版本的舒姆彼特的先驱者利润理论。由此，明确指出，空间固定的提及并不是指持续扩张的领土统治的必要性，而恰恰相反，是为了使资本在空间上能够持续流动的必要性（也见 Belina 2006：59f）。然而，不仅政治，也有“重要的”资本主义“阻碍”，阻碍了持续的地理变革，因为许多投资需要特定的基础设施，许多需要大量空间固定的常数资本（2003: 101）。其持久的经济利用不仅面临经济风险，还面临政治乃至恐怖主义威胁，因此“资本主义活动的地理景观”原则上保持不稳定（同上：102）。尽管如此，哈维认为，暂时稳定的地理配置是可能的。他将它们称为“区域”。其特征是“在生产、分配、交换和消费中具有一定程度上的结构性封闭性”（同上：103）。这引发了哈维自己提出的问题：“这种通过资本积累的空间和时间分子过程形成的区域性与国家政治和领土逻辑所表现出的领土权力逻辑之间的关系是什么？”（同上：105）。据哈维说，这两种发展动力并不一定有什么关联。尽管存在联系和国家逻辑与资本逻辑之间的基本辩证关系，它们并不构成一个统一体。这比假设某种自治更进一步。实际上，哈维的论述类似于那些声称适用于超历史分析的理论构想。一个时代的特殊性被解释为“权力逻辑”与当时主导生产方式的特定逻辑的结合（参见如 Mann 1986）。实际上，在哈维的分析中，虽然有对当前帝国主义政策的深入分析和资本增值的理论性严密分析，但缺乏对可能是资本主义特有的领土逻辑的讨论。当他写道，“资本主义形式的帝国主义”产生于领土与资本权力逻辑之间的辩证关系（2003：179）时，这里对辩证的提及——就像在马克思主义理论传统中经常出现的一样——掩饰了对关系的精确分析的放弃。 对于他的具体分析来说，领土与资本权力的不同逻辑这一论点并不重要。这同样适用于他对最新历史发展的分析，他将其称为“新帝国主义”（2003）。重点是1970年到2000年期间美国新自由主义霸权的原因以及这种霸权最近遇到的“严重困难”（同上：73）。由美国发起并通过国际货币基金组织大力推动的“新自由主义国家”模式，即促进资本增值的国家，在世界范围内传播。不符合这一模式的国家被称为“流氓国家”或“失败的国家”（同上：180）。在哈维看来，新自由主义经济上归结为通过剥夺进行积累。他将这一概念理解为马克思“原始积累”概念的延续和部分修订。"},{"instruction":"请将“Während Marx ursprüngliche Akkumulation als Voraussetzung des Kapitalismus verstanden habe, sei dessen fortdauernde und in der jüngsten Phase der kapitalistischen Entwicklung verstärkte Bedeutung hervorzuheben. Akkumulation durch Enteignung finde vor allem, aber nicht ausschließlich, in den Peripherien statt. Kritiker/innen haben völlig zu Recht betont (vgl. etwa Brenner 2006: 99ff.; Fine 2006: 143-147), dass es sich bei diesem Konzept nicht um eine Anknüpfung an die Marx’sche Analyse handelt, weil dieser die Trennung der Produzenten von ihren Produktionsmitteln und damit ihre Unterwerfung unter die Gesetze des Marktes als „ur-sprüngliche Akkumulation“ bezeichnete, während Harvey auch Prozesse der rigorosen Umverteilung in einem bereits etablierten kapitalistischen System darunter fassen will. Warum, fragt Brenner (2006: 101), sollten wir die „normalen kapitalistischen Prozesse der Akkumulation“ als Akkumulation durch Enteignung bezeichnen? In seiner Antwort hat Harvey Konzeption und Terminologie mit dem Hinweis verteidigt, dass der Terminus „primitive accumulation“ nur von Menschen verstanden werde, die Marx kennen, während sich „alle aufsetzen und zuhören“, wenn von „accumulation by dispossession“ die Rede sei, vor allem wenn er dann auf die Gefährdung von Rentenansprüchen und medizinischer Versorgung oder auf die Privatisierung des Wassers verweise (2006: 165). So liebenswert dieser Hinweis auf Vermittlungserfordernisse auch ist, er reicht nicht hin, um zu rechtfertigen, dass nahezu alle Prozesse aktueller Umverteilung als Akkumulation durch Enteignung gekennzeichnet werden. Denn immerhin gibt Harvey „Akkumulation durch Enteignung“ als zentrales Merkmal des „neuen Imperialismus“ aus. Durch solchen Vorbehalt ist seine These, dass die gegenwärtige Phase des Kapitalismus in besonderem Maße durch „kannibalistische und räuberische Praktiken“ geprägt sei (2006: 158), allerdings noch nicht widerlegt. Nur findet sich ihr schlüssiger Nachweis nicht in Harveys Theorie des neuen Imperialismus.31 Die politische Form des Kapitalismus. Alte und neue Fragen Die zu Beginn dieses Beitrags erläuterte theoretische Praxis, die Analyse des Staates vor allem als eine Analyse des „Staates im“ zu verstehen, hat sich bis in die Gegenwart fortgesetzt. Nur dass heute nicht mehr die Besonderheiten des Staates „im Kapitalismus“ den Besonderheiten des Staates „im Absolutismus“ gegenübergestellt werden, sondern statt dessen angestrebt wird, den Staat „in der Phase des Neoliberalismus“, „im Postfordismus“, in der Ära des „neuen Imperialismus“ zu bestimmen. Dennoch hat es wesentliche analytische Fortschritte gegeben. Sie betreffen nicht nur den empirischen Gehalt der Auseinandersetzungen mit dem Verhältnis von Politik und Ökonomie, sondern vor allem die Bemühungen, das Verhältnis zwischen nationaler Staatsgewalt und globalem kapitalistischem Verwertungsraum theoretisch zu erfassen. Auf der Strecke geblieben ist dagegen die Frage nach der politischen Form. Von wenigen Ausnahmen abgesehen (vgl. insbes. Hirsch 2005: Kap.1.2; Holloway 2002: Kap.4), wird sie heute entweder gar nicht gestellt oder aber als Separation von Sachbereichen verstanden bzw. auf die für die Reproduktion des Kapitals nützlichen Funktionen des Staates reduziert. Recht spielt in solchen Konzeptionen zwar insoweit eine Rolle, als es zur Absicherung von Eigentum und zur formalen Regulierung der Restrukturierung von Eigentum dient, in wieweit sich in der Allgemeinheit von Recht die formale Separation des Politischen von der Ökonomie manifestiert, steht dagegen nicht mehr zur Debatte, seit die Beteiligten an internationalen kapitalismuskritischen Theoriesdiskussionen die sogenannte Ableitungsdebatte auf einem der hinteren Regale abgelegt haben. Wird jedoch die Widerständigkeit der damaligen Debatte gegenüber ihrer Übersetzung in empirische Forschungen vorschnell mit der Irrelevanz ihrer theoretischen Fragestellungen ineins gesetzt, so steht die kritische Staatsanalyse in der Gefahr, auf Deskription beschränkt zu bleiben. Notwendiger Ausgangspunkt für eine erneute Diskussion über die politische Form des Kapitalismus ist die Kritik der historischen Bornierung der Ableitungsdebatte. Gestritten wurde zwar über die politische Form „des Kapitalismus“, stillschweigend vorausgesetzt wurde aber, dass es darum gehe, den bürgerlichen Staat als politische Form des Kapitalismus zu erklären. Diese stillschweigende Voraussetzung ist heute nicht mehr möglich. Jede neue Debatte über die politische Form des Kapitalismus muss sich nicht nur damit auseinandersetzen, dass es inzwischen weltweit zu Prozessen der Privatisierung zu-vor theoretisch als selbstverständlich angesehener staatlicher Funktionen - bis hin zum privaten Betrieb von Gefängnissen und zum privaten Angebot von Militärdienstleistungen - gekommen ist. Noch einmal zu diskutieren wäre auch die These, dass die wichtigste Funktion des Staates für den Erhalt bestehender Verhältnisse in seiner politischen Form gegeben ist, weil die Gleichheit vor dem Gesetz die politische Integration der lohnabhängigen Bevölkerung erlaubt. Hat sich seither doch gezeigt, dass das Erfordernis der politischen Integration ganz erheblich an Bedeutung verlieren kann, wenn sich Arbeitskräfte der disziplinierenden Wirkung von Konkurrenz auf internationalisierten Arbeitsmärkten ausgesetzt sehen.32 Ferner wäre systematisch zur Kenntnis zu nehmen, dass ein wachsender Anteil der Regulierung von Streitfällen im internationalen Warenverkehr heute außerhalb staatlicher Justizapparate durch private Schiedsgerichte erledigt wird, vor allem aber, dass inzwischen zahlreiche Regierungen Teile nationalstaatlicher Souveränität international vermarkten. Indem sie Nicht-Staatsbürgern besondere Bedingungen anbieten, verzichten sie auf die Allgemeinheit des Gesetzes im nationalen Rahmen.33 Diese Kreation unterschiedlicher Rechtsräume in ein und demselben Nationalstaat hat die allgemeine Form des kapitalistischen Staates an den Rändern gewissermaßen ausgefranst. Sie schafft faktisch Rechtsräume, in denen sich „Kapitalismus pur“ entfalten kann. Solche Fragmentierung der Souveränität (Picciotto 1999) ist nicht mit jener vielfach konstatierten Fragmentierung nationaler Souveränität gleichzusetzen, welche durch die Übertragung bestimmter Kompetenzen auf internationale Institutionen zustande kommt. Theoretisch noch sehr viel bedeutsamer als all diese hier aufgeführten Veränderungen ist jedoch, dass es heute nicht mehr nur kapitalistische Staaten gibt, die als Variationen ein und derselben grundlegenden Struktur verstanden werden können. Im Zentrum einer erneuten Diskussion über die politische Form des Kapitalismus müsste deshalb die Frage stehen, ob die These von der Öffentlichkeit der Staatsgewalt im Kapitalismus allgemeine Gültigkeit beanspruchen kann. Ganz offensichtlich „herrscht“ Kapitalismus heute ja auch in Ländern, in denen „Staat“ als Apparat zur privaten Aneignung fungiert und eine Trennung zwischen Staat und Gesellschaft trotz gewisser formaler Übereinstimmungen mit anderen kapitalistischen Staaten kaum auszumachen ist. Durch die Integration von Kriminalität in die Routinen der Staatstätigkeit - wie sie etwa von Bayart/Ellis/Hibou (1999) für manche afrikanische Gesellschaften diagnostiziert wird - kann Staatsgewalt in einem derart radikalen Sinne privatisiert werden, dass ihr öffentlicher Charakter bestenfalls als Chimäre fortbesteht. Im Zusammenhang der ersten Formdebatte wären solche Diagnosen als Hinweise auf frühe Stadien der Entwicklung kapitalistischer Verhältnisse beiseite geschoben worden. Derartige Strukturen sind aber, wie gering ausgebildet die lokale kapitalistische Produktion auch immer sein mag, integrale Elemente globalisierter Märkte. Sie funktionieren auf der Höhe aktueller Entwicklungen des Kapitalismus. Vielleicht ist es nachgerade an der Zeit, die Möglichkeit unterschiedlicher politischer Formen des Kapitalismus systematisch in Betracht zu ziehen. Um der Gefahr vorzubeugen, dass sich eine derartige Diskussion auf Deskription beschränkt, könnte es hilfreich sein, die Fragen, die in der ersten Diskussion über die Form des kapitalistischen Staates formuliert wurden, noch einmal zu Rate zu ziehen. ”翻译为中文","output":"马克思将原始积累理解为资本主义的前提，应当强调在资本主义发展的最新阶段，通过剥夺方式的积累变得持续且日益重要。特别是在外围地区（但不仅限于此）发生了通过剥夺的积累。批评者完全正确地强调（参见例如 Brenner 2006：99ff；Fine 2006：143-147），这个概念并非对马克思的分析的继续，因为马克思将生产者与其生产手段的分离，从而使它们受到市场规律支配，称为“原始积累”，而哈维也希望包含在已建立的资本主义体系中的严格重新分配过程。Brenner（2006：101）问：我们为什么应该将“正常的资本主义积累过程”称为通过剥夺的积累？哈维在答复中捍卫了他的概念和术语，指出术语“原始积累”仅为熟悉马克思的人所理解，而当提及“通过剥夺的积累”时，“每个人都坐直了并且倾听”，尤其是当他进一步提到退休金权益和医疗保障的威胁，或者水的私有化时（2006：165）。尽管这种指向传递需求的提及是可爱的，它还不足以证明几乎所有当前重新分配过程都应该被标记为通过剥夺的积累。因为哈维“通过剥夺的积累”作为“新帝国主义”的核心特征。尽管有这种保留，但并不意味着哈维的观点，即当前资本主义阶段特别是通过“吃人的和掠夺性的做法”所特有的观点被推翻了。只是在哈维的新帝国主义理论中没有找到这一观点的有力证明。 资本主义的政治形态。旧问题与新问题 本文开头解释的将国家分析主要理解为“国家在...”的理论实践持续到了今天。只是如今不再是将资本主义中的国家特点与绝对主义中的国家特点对比，而是试图确定新自由主义阶段、“后福特主义”时代、新帝国主义时代的国家。尽管如此，还是取得了重要的分析进步。这些进步不仅关乎与政治与经济关系的辩论的实证内容，而且主要关乎努力理论化国家权力与全球资本主义利用空间之间的关系。遗憾的是，对政治形态的探讨却未能跟进。除了少数例外（特别参见Hirsch 2005：第1.2章；Holloway 2002：第4章），今天这个问题要么根本不被提出，要么被理解为部门之间的分离，或者被简化为对资本再生产有用的国家功能。法律在这些概念中虽然起着作用，以保障所有权和正式调整产权重组，但法律的普遍性如何体现政治与经济的正式分离，自参与者把所谓的派生辩论放到了书架后面以来，这一点就不再是讨论的对象。如果将当时辩论的抵制其转化为实证研究的倾向过早地等同于其理论问题的不相关性，那么批判性国家分析的风险就在于仅限于描述。 重新讨论资本主义的政治形态的必要出发点是批判派生辩论的历史局限性。尽管争论的焦点是“资本主义”的政治形态，但默认假定的是要解释资产阶级国家作为资本主义的政治形态。这一默认假设今天已不再可能。任何有关资本主义政治形态的新辩论不仅需要处理到目前为止理论上被认为是理所当然的国家职能的全球性私有化过程——直至私营运营的监狱和提供私人军事服务——它还需要重新讨论这样一个论点，即国家对维持现状最重要的功能在于其政治形式，因为法律面前的平等允许工资依赖人口的政治整合。然而，已经显示出，如果劳动力受到国际化劳动市场上竞争的纪律作用的影响，政治整合的要求可能会大大减少。此外，还需要系统地认识到，如今在国际商品交易中调解争端的很大一部分已经由私人仲裁庭而非国家司法机构来处理，尤其是，许多政府现在正在国际上出售国家主权的一部分。通过向非公民提供特殊条件，他们放弃了国家框架中法律的普遍性。这种在同一民族国家内创建不同法律空间的做法，某种程度上使资本主义国家的普遍形式变得支离破碎。它实际上创造了法律空间，在这些空间内“纯粹的资本主义”可以蓬勃发展。这种主权的碎片化（Picciotto 1999）与通过将某些权力转移给国际机构而产生的国家主权的广泛确认的碎片化不同。 然而，比所有这些所列举的变化还重要的是，如今不仅仅存在可以被理解为同一基本结构变体的资本主义国家。重新讨论资本主义的政治形态的中心应该是这样一个问题：资本主义下国家权力的公共性的假设能否具有普遍有效性。显然，如今资本主义也“统治”着那些国家，其中“国家”作为私人征用的工具，并且尽管与其他资本主义国家在形式上存在某些相似性，几乎无法辨别出国家与社会之间的区别。通过将犯罪行为整合到国家行为的常态中——正如 Bayart/Ellis/Hibou（1999）对某些非洲社会诊断的那样——国家权力可以以一种如此激进的方式被私有化，以至于其公共特征最多只能作为幻影存在。在第一次形式辩论的背景下，这样的诊断会被视为对资本主义关系发展早期阶段的提示而被忽略。然而，这种结构无论当地资本主义生产多么欠发达，都是全球化市场的内在元素。它们在资本主义当前发展的最高点上运作。 也许现在正是时候系统地考虑资本主义不同政治形态的可能性。为了避免这样的讨论仅限于描述，重新考虑第一次关于资本主义国家形式的讨论中提出的问题可能会有所帮助。"},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"Is using immunoglobulin as part of treatment for sclc common practice","output":"As of my last knowledge update in 2023, using immunoglobulin as a direct treatment for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is not common practice. SCLC treatment typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and more recently, immunotherapy drugs that boost the body's immune response against cancer cells, but not immunoglobulins specifically. Immunoglobulins (antibodies) are proteins produced by the immune system to combat pathogens. In therapeutic contexts, immunoglobulin therapy can be used to treat certain conditions by providing passive immunity, boosting immune system function, or modulating immune responses. This is different from the type of immunotherapy used in treating cancers like SCLC, which involves agents such as checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab, atezolizumab) that enhance the body's natural immune response to cancer. In specific terms of cancer treatment, immunoglobulin levels might be monitored, and immunoglobulin therapy could potentially be used in cases where patients have an underlying condition that results in immunodeficiency, but this would not be targeting the cancer directly. The primary use of immunoglobulin therapy in a cancer context might be more supportive, focusing on managing the side effects of cancer or its treatment (like bolstering the immune system if it's weakened by chemotherapy) rather than actively treating the cancer itself. For SCLC, the most promising advances have been in the field of immunotherapy with drugs designed to target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, contributing to improved outcomes in some patients, especially when used in combination with traditional chemotherapy regimens. It's always important to refer to the most current clinical guidelines or research for the latest in cancer treatment practices."},{"instruction":"Can you use immunoglobulin for sclc","output":"As of my last update in 2023, using immunoglobulin specifically as a therapy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is not a standard treatment or part of conventional clinical practice. Immunoglobulin therapy, commonly known as IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy), is primarily used for a range of autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency disorders, and some infections, rather than for directly treating cancers like SCLC. The treatment for SCLC typically focuses on chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and increasingly, immunotherapy agents, but these immunotherapies are not the same as immunoglobulin treatments. Immunotherapy for SCLC usually involves medications known as checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., atezolizumab, durvalumab) that help the immune system recognize and fight cancer cells more effectively. These therapies target specific proteins (like PD-L1 or CTLA-4) that play a role in the immune system's ability to attack cancer cells. Immunoglobulin therapy provides a broad boost to the immune system by supplying a mixture of antibodies from donated blood. While it enhances immune function overall, it doesn’t specifically target cancer cells, and therefore, isn’t aimed at treating cancer, including SCLC. That said, research in oncology moves rapidly, and novel treatments are continually being explored. While immunoglobulin therapy might not be used to directly treat SCLC, aspects of the immune system, including how antibodies interact with cancer cells, are areas of ongoing research. Future discoveries could potentially open new avenues for using immunoglobulin or other components of the immune system in the treatment of SCLC and other cancers. Always consult current clinical guidelines or a medical professional for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding cancer treatments."},{"instruction":"Is the use of immunoglobulin contraindicated to sclc","output":"As of the last update in 2023, the use of immunoglobulin is not specifically contraindicated for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC); rather, immunoglobulin therapy is not typically used as a treatment for SCLC. Immunoglobulin therapy involves the administration of antibody proteins and is primarily used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, and some infectious diseases. It works by boosting the body's immune response or supplying it with necessary immune components that it is lacking. The main treatments for SCLC include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and increasingly, specific forms of immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab, atezolizumab). These treatments are different from immunoglobulin therapy in their action and indications. However, the issue of contraindication would arise if a specific treatment, including immunoglobulin therapy, could worsen the patient's condition or interact negatively with the cancer treatments being administered. For example, there could be theoretical concerns about stimulating the immune system in a way that could affect the cancer's behavior, but this is more speculative than based on direct evidence regarding immunoglobulin therapy and SCLC. Additionally, individual patient factors, such as underlying conditions, concurrent treatments, and overall health status, might influence whether any particular treatment, including immunoglobulin therapy, is advisable. If a patient with SCLC also has a condition that is typically treated with immunoglobulin therapy (such as a primary immunodeficiency), the decision to use immunoglobulin would be carefully considered by the healthcare team, taking into account the overall benefits and risks given the patient's cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. Therefore, while not a standard treatment or contraindicated per se, the use of immunoglobulin in the context of SCLC would be highly individualized, based on a thorough evaluation of potential benefits and risks. Always consult with healthcare providers for medical advice tailored to the specific situation."},{"instruction":"python实现pdf转图片","output":"将PDF转换为图片是一个常见的需求，尤其是在需要对PDF内容进行视觉展示或进一步处理的场景中。Python提供了多种库来实现这一转换，其中\`pdf2image\`是一个相对简单且流行的选择。以下是如何使用\`pdf2image\`实现PDF转图片的步骤： # 安装所需库 首先，确保安装了\`pdf2image\`。你可以通过pip来安装它： \`\`\`bash pip install pdf2image \`\`\` 此外，\`pdf2image\`依赖于\`poppler\`工具，因此你需要在你的系统上安装\`poppler\`。安装方法因操作系统而异： - **Windows**: [下载](http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/)并解压\`poppler\`，然后将\`bin\`目录添加到系统的环境变量\`PATH\`中。 - **Mac OS**: 使用Homebrew进行安装：\`brew install poppler\`。 - **Linux**: 大多数Linux发行版可以通过包管理器安装，例如在Ubuntu上使用\`sudo apt-get install poppler-utils\`。 # 使用pdf2image 安装完所需库和依赖项后，你可以使用以下Python代码将PDF转换为图片： \`\`\`python from pdf2image import convert_from_path # PDF文件的路径 pdf_path = 'your_pdf_file.pdf' # 将PDF转换为图片列表，每一页是一个图片对象 images = convert_from_path(pdf_path) # 遍历转换得到的图片列表，并保存到文件系统 for i, image in enumerate(images): # 文件名格式：page_1.jpg, page_2.jpg, ... image.save(f'page_{i + 1}.jpg', 'JPEG') \`\`\` 这段代码做了什么： 1. 从指定路径导入PDF文件。 2. 调用\`convert_from_path\`函数将PDF文件转换为图片。该函数返回一个图片列表，其中每个元素对应PDF的一页。 3. 遍历这个列表，并将每个图片对象保存到文件系统中。这里使用JPEG格式，但你也可以根据需要选择其他格式，如PNG。 注意，转换效果取决于多种因素，包括PDF的质量和复杂度。\`pdf2image\`提供了若干参数来调整输出结果，例如\`dpi\`（每英寸点数，用于控制输出图片的质量）和\`page_numbers\`（用于指定需要转换的页码）。你可以根据需求调整这些参数以获得最佳结果。 这是一个基础的PDF转图片示例，对于更复杂的需求，你可能需要深入了解\`pdf2image\`以及其他相关库的文档。"},{"instruction":"不用再下载什么软件，直接用python包实现那种","output":"如果你想要避免下载额外软件，如\`poppler\`，可以考虑使用\`PyMuPDF\`（也称为\`fitz\`）。\`PyMuPDF\`是一个功能强大的库，可以直接从PDF中提取文本、图像、渲染页面等，而且它是自包含的，不需要依赖于外部应用或软件。 首先，确保已经安装\`PyMuPDF\`： \`\`\`bash pip install pymupdf \`\`\` 然后，你可以使用以下脚本将PDF文件中的每一页转换为图片： \`\`\`python import fitz # PyMuPDF def pdf_to_images(pdf_path, output_folder='.'): # 打开PDF文件 doc = fitz.open(pdf_path) # 遍历PDF的每一页 for page_num in range(len(doc)): page = doc.load_page(page_num) # 获取页面 pix = page.get_pixmap() # 渲染页面为像素图 image_path = f\\"{output_folder}/page_{page_num + 1}.png\\" # 定义图片名称 pix.save(image_path) # 保存图片 print(f\\"转换完成，共处理{len(doc)}页。\\") # 使用示例 # 替换为你的PDF路径 pdf_path = 'your_pdf_file.pdf' pdf_to_images(pdf_path) \`\`\` 这段脚本会将指定PDF的每一页渲染为一个图片文件，并保存到当前工作目录或你指定的路径。它默认保存为PNG格式，但是\`PyMuPDF\`也支持其他格式，如JPEG。你可以通过调整\`pix.save\`方法中的参数来修改输出格式和配置。 \`PyMuPDF\`的优点包括高性能和高质量的输出，同时避免了安装和配置外部依赖的繁琐过程。此外，它提供了更多高级功能，如果你需要进行PDF文件的深入处理或分析，\`PyMuPDF\`是一个非常值得考虑的选项。"},{"instruction":"اكتبي رسالة تحفيزية خاصة بب يأريد التقدم بها للمشاركة في امتحان الدخول إلى سلك التفتيش التربوي السلك الإعدادي مادة علوم الحياة والأرض. وهذه بعض المعلومات عني : - اسمي الكامل : صالح العمراني - مدة العمل بالقسم : 25 سنة ولا زلت أعمل بالقسم كمدرس حتى الآن. - المستوى الدراسي: السنة الرابعة جامعي تخصص بيولوجيا - جيولوجيا. - التكوينات: عملت كمكون لعدة دورات تكوينية لفائة الأساتذة وتلقيت العديد من التكوينات أنا أيضا. - عملت أستاذا مرشدا وأستاذا مصاحبا لعدة سنوات ولا زلت حتى اليوم - شاركت في عدة ندوات تربوية في مجال البيداغوجيا والديداكتيك وطرق إدماج التقنية في تدريس مادة علوم الحياة والأرض. - أعمل منذ سنوات على تطوير أسلوب خاص بي يرتكز على أسلوب الصف المقلوب أو المعكوس. - أنوع طرق التدريس منذبدات العمل كمدرس لمادة علوم الحياة والأرض - شاركت في الامتحانات الإشهادية للسنة الثالثة إعدادي والباكالوريا - شاركت في مراكز التصحيح لأوراق تلاميذ السنة الثالثة والباكالوريا - أعمل بشكل يومي على تطوير أدائي داخل القسم","output":"عزيزي صالح العمراني، أود أن أهنئك على مسيرتك المهنية الطويلة والمليئة بالإنجازات في مجال التعليم، وأود أن أشجعك على خطوة جديدة وهامة في مسيرتك وهي دخول امتحان الدخول إلى سلك التفتيش التربوي في مادة علوم الحياة والأرض. لقد برزت كمدرس متميز ومبدع خلال مشوارك التعليمي، وكان لديك تأثير إيجابي على الطلاب وزملائك في العمل. تجربتك الواسعة وتحضيرك الجيد يجعلانك مؤهلا لهذه الخطوة. تحمل خبرتك السنوات الطويلة في العمل التربوي والعديد من التدريبات والدورات التي حضرتها، سوف تجعلك تمتلك المهارات والقدرات اللازمة للنجاح في هذا الامتحان. فلا تتردد في طلب المشورة من زملائك والاستعداد بجدية وتفانٍ. أعرف أنك تتمتع بشغفك بالتعليم ورغبتك في تحسين أدائك وتطوير طرق التدريس، وهذا يعكس الروح الحقيقية للمعلم المبتكر. أتمنى لك كل التوفيق والنجاح في هذه الخطوة الجديدة، وأن تحقق ما تصبو إليه في مجال التفتيش التربوي. احبطي الخوف والشك في نفسك، وثق أنك تملك كل ما يلزم لتحقيق النجاح. بالتوفيق!"},{"instruction":"Возможно ли с помощью питона скачать все изображения с web-страницы?","output":"Да, с помощью Python вы можете скачать все изображения с web-страницы.

For the purpose of this analysis, please provide the quotes or key points from your interviews. I'll guide you through the process of thematic analysis, which typically involves the following steps: 1. **Familiarizing Yourself with Your Data:** Reading through all your data (in this case, the quotes from the UX interviews) to become intimately familiar with it. If you haven't done so already, compile all your interview quotes in one place. 2. **Generating Initial Codes:** Identifying meaningful elements in the data that can be marked with a code. Coding can be done manually by highlighting and notating the data, or with the use of qualitative data analysis software. 3. **Searching for Themes:** Examining the codes and their associated data to identify significant patterns. These patterns can become the central themes of your analysis. 4. **Reviewing Themes:** Checking if the themes work in relation to the coded extracts and the entire data set. This step often involves refining themes, splitting, combining, or discarding them as necessary. 5. **Defining and Naming Themes:** Developing clear definitions and names for each theme, ensuring they accurately represent the essence of the data. 6. **Writing Up:** Relaying the findings of the thematic analysis, supported by vivid, compelling extracts from the interviews, and explaining how and why they are relevant to the research question.

The term \\"Pima\\" itself is derived from the Pima Indians, who were growing the cotton in the Southwestern United States, particularly in the Gila River Valley in Arizona, where the superior strain of cotton was first cultivated. Supima cotton is distinguished by its long staple fibers, which are about 1.5 inches long, compared to the shorter 1.1-inch average length of upland cotton fibers. These longer fibers produce smoother, softer, and more durable fabrics that resist pilling, fading, and stretching better than fabrics made with shorter-staple cotton. This type of cotton represents a small percentage of cotton grown worldwide, making it a more luxurious and sought-after material.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding or error in terms – \\"goat punishment\\" does not directly relate to the use of animal tongues, at least not in conventional or academic discussions on zoology, animal behavior, or ethology. If you're interested in the role of animal tongues within various species, including goats, you might want to consider a few adjustments to your topic for clarity and relevance: 1. **Animal Feeding Mechanisms**: Explore how different animals use their tongues for feeding. Goats, for example, use their highly flexible tongues to grasp and pull leaves and branches into their mouths. 2. **Sensory Functions of Animal Tongues**: You could examine how animals use their tongues for sensory purposes. Goats and many other animals have taste buds on their tongues that are essential for assessing the quality and safety of food. 3. **Communication and Social Behavior**: Some animals might use their tongues as part of social interactions or communication. While goats may not specifically use their tongues for this purpose, understanding how physical traits contribute to animal behavior might be relevant. 4. **Adaptative Evolution of Animal Tongues**: Discuss how the tongues of animals have adapted to their environments and feeding habits over time. This could include a comparative analysis between different species, such as goats, giraffes, and ant-eaters, showcasing the diversity and evolutionary paths of tongues. If you indeed meant something specific by \\"goat punishment\\" that ties into the use of animal tongues, I'd suggest clarifying your topic to ensure it aligns with established ethical considerations and scientific research.

Why","output":"Based on the code snippet you provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the workflow you've described. Specifically, the \`INDICES\` array in \`QuadMesh\` is statically initialized with the values \`{0, 1, 2, 3}\`. This means that as soon as the \`QuadMesh\` class is loaded by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), that array should be initialized with those values before any instance of \`QuadMesh\` (or any static method or field access) is used. Static initialization blocks or static fields are executed or initialized in the order they appear in a class when the class is loaded, which happens before any instance creation or static method is invoked. Therefore, unless there's an unusual class loading behavior or JVM issue, the \`INDICES\` array should not be null when the constructor uses it. However, if you're observing that \`INDICES\` is null during the constructor call, a few possible (but unlikely in typical Java environments) explanations could be: 1. **Class Loader Issues:** Your environment might have unusual class loading behavior. This could potentially happen in complex applications with custom class loaders, but it's a rare case. 2. **Initialization Order:** Although this doesn't seem to be the issue from the snippet you've provided, if there were dependencies between static fields that lead to an unexpected order of initialization, that could cause problems. But as shown, \`INDICES\` is directly initialized and doesn't depend on anything else. 3. **Code Alteration at Runtime:** Tools that modify bytecode at runtime could potentially alter the order of operations or the static fields themselves, but this is highly specialized behavior and not common in most development environments. The line: \`\`\`java private static final QuadMesh mesh = new QuadMesh(-1, -1, 2, 2, new float[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1}); \`\`\` seems a bit off in its usage; notably, \`QuadMesh\` constructor doesn't seem designed to take an array of floats as its last parameter based on the provided constructor signature. It expects a \`GLTexture\`. This discrepancy might be a part of the confusion or the issue you're facing if there's a misunderstanding or if the actual class constructors are not correctly matched with their usage. To diagnose your issue: - Ensure that there's no exception or error being swallowed silently during class initialization which could affect the static initialization. - Verify that the version of the class loaded at runtime matches what you expect (i.e., no old versions are cached or loaded from a different classpath). - Confirm there's no bytecode manipulation or custom class loading that could lead to such behavior. Given the provided details, without the surrounding context or more specific runtime information, this analysis covers the common reasons. If those suggestions don't resolve your issue, you might need to provide more information or investigate specifics of your runtime environment and class loading process."},{"instruction":"what version u r?","output":"I am based on OpenAI's technology and algorithms, and my responses are generated based on the information available to me up to my last update.

En supposant une value initiale de (T_{text{eau}} = 20 °C), et (T_{text{air}} = 20 °C), la différence de température initiale ((T_{text{eau}} - T_{text{air}})) est 0, ce qui signifie initialement aucun transfert de chaleur par convection. Cependant, une flaque d'eau exposée à un air plus froid se refroidirait progressivement, augmentant (T_{text{eau}} - T_{text{air}}). Votre question sur le désert à -40°C semble suggérer un contexte où la température de l'air ambiant est de -40°C. Si c'était le cas (et non 20°C comme mentionné), la différence significative entre (T_{text{eau}}) et (T_{text{air}}) entraînerait un transfert de chaleur considérable et pourrait potentiellement geler l'eau, surtout la nuit quand les températures chutent drastiquement. Dans des conditions de désert, avec un écart de température aussi extrême, et sans apport de chaleur externe, il est possible que l'eau gèle, mais cela dépendrait de nombreux facteurs, y compris le taux de refroidissement, la quantité d'eau, et la conduction thermique du sol sous la flaque. Cependant, si l'air ambiant est à 20°C, comme indiqué, alors il n'y aurait pas de condition favorisant le gel de l'eau puisque l'environnement est au-dessus du point de congélation de l'eau."},{"instruction":"Какие есть малоизвестные песни для создания сэмпла и ремикса в стиле GREAF","output":"1. \\"Empty Cups\\" - Hayley Kiyoko 2. \\"Sunset Lover\\" - Petit Biscuit 3. \\"Lost Girls\\" - Lindsey Stirling 4. \\"I Still Love You\\" - Switchfoot 5. \\"Lighthouse\\" - G.R.L. 6. \\"Dreaming With Our Eyes Open\\" - Witt Lowry 7. \\"Riding a Black Unicorn Down the Side of an Erupting Volcano While Drinking from a Chalice Filled with the Laughter of Small Children\\" - The Flaming Lips 8. \\"Fading Like a Flower\\" - Roxette 9. \\"Waves\\" - Mr. Probz 10. \\"I Haunt Wizards\\" - Bishop Nehru"},{"instruction":"Hello, i want you to create some NSFW category names for me.

Si la température de l'air ambiant est de 20°C et le coefficient de convection h=5 W/m K. Est ce que l'eau d'une flaque d'eau peut geler dans ces conditions.","output":"Pour déterminer si l'eau d'une flaque peut geler en ces conditions, nous devons effectuer une analyse thermique. Nous savons que la température extérieure descend jusqu'à -40°C et la température initiale de l'eau est 20°C. Le coefficient de convection (h) est de 5 W/(m²·K), ce qui influence le taux de transfert de chaleur entre l'eau et l'air environnant. Lorsque l'eau gèle, elle doit atteindre 0°C (point de congélation de l'eau sous pression normale) et puis libérer la chaleur latente de fusion pour passer de l'état liquide à solide. Le transfert de chaleur par convection peut être calculé par la formule: [ Q = hA(T_{surface} - T_{ambient}) ] où - (Q) est le taux de transfert de chaleur (W), - (h) est le coefficient de convection (5 W/(m²·K) dans ce cas), - (A) est la surface de transfert (en mètres carrés), - (T_{surface}) est la température de surface de l'eau (en Kelvin ou Celsius pour un différentiel de température), - (T_{ambient}) est la température ambiante (-40°C dans ce cas). Le processus de calcul devrait aussi prendre en compte la quantité de chaleur perdue par l'eau pour atteindre le point de congélation et ensuite la chaleur latente à libérer pour que la congélation se produise complètement. Cependant, l'information sur la surface de la flaque et sa masse d'eau (ou volume, densité de l'eau à 1000 kg/m³) est nécessaire pour estimer précisément si l'eau pourrait geler ou non, car plus la surface d'exposition est grande, plus le refroidissement sera rapide, et de même, une quantité d'eau faible gèlera plus rapidement qu'une grande quantité. En supposant une surface spécifique et en utilisant un nombre simplifié comme exemple sans calcul exact, il est théoriquement possible pour de l'eau de geler sous ces conditions si elle est exposée suffisamment longtemps à -40°C, en particulier durant la nuit dans le désert où il n'y a pas d'apport solaire et les températures peuvent chuter drastiquement. N'oublions pas que les vrais calculs demanderaient plus de détails, comme la quantité d'eau, sa capacité thermique spécifique (environ 4.18 kJ/kgK pour l'eau), la surface d'exposition, et le temps d'exposition aux températures basses. En absence de ces données, cette réponse reste assez générale."},{"instruction":"i bought for 17800 euros 19800 usdt, a trader sell the usdt for 0,95 euros, what i will earn in euros without the fees included ?","output":"To calculate your earnings in euros without including the fees, first figure out how much USDT you bought for 17,800 euros at the rate the trader offered, which is 0.95 euros per USDT. Given: - Purchase amount in euros = 17,800 euros - Trader's rate = 0.95 euros/USDT - Your available USDT = 19,800 USDT Let's first clarify that you've indicated you bought 19,800 USDT for 17,800 euros; the trader's selling rate of USDT for euros is there to help calculate the value of your USDT in euros at this new rate, which might have been a slight misunderstanding in how it's presented.

A webpage opens up on \\"http://localhost:45277/\\" telling me \\"Unable to connect\\". How can I solve this?","output":"If you're trying to open a Graphviz-generated visualization and encountering an \\"Unable to connect\\" error at \`http://localhost:45277/\`, it suggests that the process expected to serve the graph on that port is not running or there's a network configuration issue. Here’s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and potentially solve this problem: # 1. Check the Process First, confirm that the Graphviz or associated tool process that should serve the graph is running. You can use commands like \`ps aux | grep [name_of_the_process]\` to search for it. If you don't find it, there might have been an issue starting the process, or it might have crashed or terminated for some reason. # 2. Firewall or Network Issue If the process is running, the issue might be related to network restrictions or firewall settings that block access to the specified port (\`45277\` in your case): - **Disable Firewall Temporarily (for testing):** - You can temporarily disable the firewall to check if it’s the cause of the issue. Use \`sudo systemctl stop firewalld\` on systems with \`firewalld\` or \`sudo ufw disable\` for \`ufw\`. Remember to enable it back after testing. - **Allow Port Through Firewall:** - If disabling the firewall fixes the issue, you should allow the specific port through it instead of leaving the firewall disabled. For \`ufw\`, use \`sudo ufw allow 45277\`. For \`firewalld\`, use \`sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=45277/tcp\` followed by \`sudo firewall-cmd --reload\`. # 3. Start a Simple HTTP Server Manually If you have generated a static file (like an HTML file) you’re trying to access, and the problem is with the utility that should serve it, you can serve it manually using Python’s HTTP server module or another simple HTTP server: - **Python 3.x:** 1. Navigate to the directory where your file is located. 2. Run \`python3 -m http.server 45277\`. 3. Access the file again through your browser. # 4. Use an Alternative Viewing Method If the direct method doesn’t work, consider alternative ways to view the output generated by Graphviz, such as opening the generated file directly with a browser if it’s HTML or using image viewers for formats like PNG or SVG. # 5. Check Localhost Mapping Ensure that \`localhost\` is correctly mapped in your \`/etc/hosts\` file. Normally, it should have an entry like \`127.0.0.1 localhost\`. If \`localhost\` isn't correctly mapped, your browser won't resolve the address properly. # 6. Network Configuration If you're running this in a virtualized environment (like Docker, VMs, or WSL on Windows), ensure that the network is correctly configured to allow connections from your host to the guest system where the server process runs. Port forwarding or network bridge configurations might be necessary. # 7. Use Debugging Tools - Use network debugging tools like \`netstat -tuln\` to check if the server really listens on port 45277. - Check logs for errors. If the tool you're using logs to a file or system log, inspect those logs for any messages that could indicate why the server isn't accessible. # 8. Consult Documentation Lastly, review the tool’s documentation for any specific configuration or dependency that might have been missed and could affect the server's operation. Each step might help identify the issue's cause, and you might not need to proceed through all of them to solve your problem."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Der Gegensatz von bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat beim frühen Marx Aber Hegel verwechselt hier den Staat als das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes mit dem politischen Staat. Jenes Besondere ist nicht das „Besondere im“, son¬dern vielmehr „äusser dem Staate“, nämlich dem po¬litischen Staate. Es ist nicht nur nicht „das im Staate wirkliche Besondere“, sondern auch die „Unwirk¬lichkeit des Staates“. Hegel will entwickeln, daß die Stände der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft die politischen Stände sind, und um dieß zu beweisen, unterstellt er, daß die Stände der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft die „Besonderung des politischen Staates“, d.i., daß die bürgerliche Gesellschaft die politische Gesellschaft ist. Der Ausdruck: „Das Besondere im Staate“ kann hier nur Sinn haben als: „Die Besonderung des Staa¬tes“. H. wählt aus einem bösen Gewissen den unbe¬stimmten Ausdruck. Er selbst hat nicht nur das Ge¬genteil entwickelt, er bestätigt es noch selbst in diesem §, indem er die bürgerliche Gesellschaft als „Privatstand“ bezeichnet. Sehr vorsichtig ist auch die Bestimmung, daß sich das Besondere an das All¬gemeine „anknüpft“. Anknüpfen kann man die hete¬rogensten Dinge. Es handelt sich hier aber nicht um einen allmählichen Uebergang, sondern um eine Transsubstantiation, und es nützt nichts, diese Kluft, die übersprungen und durch den Sprung selbst de- monstrirt wird, nicht sehn zu wollen (MEGA2 1/2, S. 87- 88; MEW 1, S. 282). Einleitendes Die Trennung und der Gegensatz zwischen Allgemeinheit und Besonder¬heit und der Status ihrer jeweiligen Beziehung ist die Fundamentalfrage, die sich für die politischen Philosophen an der Schwelle der Moderne aufwirft. Wenn die Tradition der Naturrechtstheoretiker, wenngleich in unterschiedlicher Weise (von Hobbes bis Kant), auf dem Gegensatz be¬harrt, hält Hegel am Gegensatz fest und will zugleich eine Brücke zwi¬schen beiden Polen des Gegensatzes herstellen. Auch Marx schließt sich an diese Diskussion an, und zwar in Gestalt einer inhaltlichen und metho¬dischen Kritik an Hegel, die sich zu einer Kritik an der gesamten politi¬schen Philosophie der Neuzeit und Moderne ausweitet, die gerade bei Hegel ihre entwickelte Gestalt erhält. Die als Epigraph zitierte Passage markiert die Schnittstelle, an der Marx an diese Diskussion anschließt. Sein Vorwurf ist, dass in Hegels Staatstheorie eine Verwechselung stattfindet, und zwar die Verwechselung des Staates als das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes mit dem modernen, abstrakten politischen Staat. Beide sind nach Marx nicht zu verwechseln, weil der politische Staat in einer Transformation der Sittlichkeit in einen Rechtszustand entsteht, der die lebendige Sittlichkeit auflöst. Wenn in der Sittlichkeit der Staat für das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes steht, denn die „öffentliche Gerechtigkeit vollzieht sich hier als die sittliche Integrati¬on eines Volkes“ (Menke 1996, S. 212), so gilt, dass diese Form der Ge¬rechtigkeit nicht dem Entstehen und der Vorherrschaft der Gesellschaft der atomisierten Individuen gerecht werden kann, was dann auch bedeu¬tet, dass eine andere Form des Politischen notwendig wird, die dieser neu¬en Form des Auftretens der Individuen und des ihm entsprechenden Rechts gerecht wird. Das Recht der subjektiven Freiheit wird zunächst durch das Recht festgelegt, das abstrakte Recht, und dann durch die poli¬tische Gewalt geltend gemacht. Der Staat entspricht deswegen nicht mehr dem Ganzen des Daseins eines Volkes, sondern er ist politischer Staat ge¬worden, der getrennt von der Gesellschaft existiert.1 Nur als solche ge¬trennte Instanz kann er das abstrakte Recht zur Geltung bringen. Dieser Prozess ist der Prozess der Verselbständigung des Politischen, die Menke zufolge in der „Herrschaft des Rechts“ (Menke 1996, S. 10) gründet. Mit der Formulierung der These in diesen Termini ist aber noch kein Urteil über den Grund der Herrschaft des Rechts gefallen. Auch wenn man dieses Problem zunächst einmal im Hintergrund stehen lässt, so wird doch schon eins deutlich: Im Zustand der Herrschaft des Rechts steht der Staat nicht mehr für das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes, denn dieses basiert auf der sittlichen Integration der Bürger. Die sittliche In¬tegration der Bürger macht den Staat als das lebendige Ganze aus. Steht nun der Staat als eine von den Individuen verselbständigte Sphäre diesen gegenüber, als politischer Staat, dann entsteht er per definitionem nicht mehr aus der sittlichen Integration der Individuen, wie bei den Antiken.2 Die Frage ist nun, wie es möglich ist, diese zwei Formen des Politi¬schen zu verwechseln, wenn sie einmal so klar auseinandergehalten wor¬den sind? In der Tat hat Hegel in seinen frühen Schriften (die Marx nicht kannte) das abstrakte Recht und die aus ihm entspringenden politischen Formen verworfen, als er es als eine lebensfeindliche Macht ausgespro¬chen hatte? Besonders wichtig für diese These ist der Naturrechtsaufsatz, in dem sich Hegel nahtlos an Platons Rechtskritik in der Politeia und im Politikos anschließt. Die Verwechslung wird aber vorbereitet, indem die¬ser frühe kritische Standpunkt in der Phänomenologie des Geistes umfor¬muliert wird, in der sich, wie Menke bemerkt, die „Perspektive auf eine Veränderung des Rechts öffnet“ (1996, S. 227).4 Das abstrakte Recht ist laut Hegel ein notwendiges Moment der Geschichte der Freiheit, muss aber verändert werden bzw. vervollständigt werden.5 Habermas bringt die Sache auf den Punkt, wenn er sagt: „In der Jenenser Philosophie des Geistes erscheint demgegenüber der Rechtszustand, der nun auch durch die Best¬immungen des modernen bürgerlichen Privatrechts charakterisiert ist, nicht mehr als ein Produkt des Zerfalls der absoluten Sittlichkeit, sondern im Gegenteil als die erste Gestalt des konstituierten sittlichen Verhältnis¬ses“ (1969, S, 41 - 42).6 Dies wird zu einem Kurzschluss führen, denn zum einen unterstellt die Veränderung das Bleiben des abstrakten Rechts und, um konsequent zu sein, auch die Verselbständigung des Politischen; zum anderen aber kann das abstrakte Recht aus Hegelscher Sicht nur durch eine andere Form des Politischen verändert werden, nämlich die, die auf der sittlichen Integration der Bürger beruht. Es soll und es soll nicht die Verselbständigung des Politischen stattfinden. Dies führt Hegel dazu, wie Roth zutreffend bemerkt, „den „Staat“ als Polis und zugleich als Staat im modernen Sinne“ (1991, S. 147) zu interpretieren, oder: „Der Staat soll Polis, aber doch zugleich Staat im neuzeitlichen Sinne sein“ (1991, S. 184).7 Aus Marx’ Sicht ist dies prinzipiell eine unmögliche Kom¬position, die nur auf eine Verwechselung hinauslaufen kann. Um diesen Aporien zu entgehen schlägt Marx’ Kritik an Hegels Theorie des Rechts bzw. des Staates einen ganz anderen Weg ein. Seine Theorie setzt genau an der oben beiseite gestellten Frage an. Wenn die Verselbständigung des Politischen auf der Herrschaft des Rechts beruht, worauf beruht, so stellt Marx die Frage, die Herrschaft des Rechts? Ist das Recht die Ursache der Auflösung des sittlichen Gemeinwesens, oder ist das Recht selbst die Wirkung einer anderen grundlegenden Ursache, die das sittliche Gemeinwesen von innen auflöste? Nur nach Klärung dieser Fragen lässt sich bewerten, ob die Perspektive der Veränderung des abs¬trakten Rechts sinnvoll ist, weil dann die Frage nach den Zwecken des abstrakten Rechts - die Frage nach seinem realen Wesen - beantwortet ist. Damit erhält die Frage nach dem Staat eine ganz neue Perspektive. Marx’ bezweckt eine Theorie und Kritik des Staates in Sinne von Feuerbachs Kritik der Religion. Genauso wie die Religion nicht der Ruhe¬punkt ist, in dem die Widersprüche des menschlichen Bewusstseins auf¬gehoben bzw. versöhnt werden, so ist auch der Staat nicht der Ruhepunkt, in dem die Widersprüche des materiellen Lebens des Menschen, d.h. der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft aufgehoben bzw. versöhnt werden. Es hängt nicht davon ab, ob König x oder y am Staatsruder ist, dass Partei A oder B die Macht übernommen hat, vielmehr liegt es im Wesen des modernen Staates selber, dass die Widersprüche der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft nicht zur Ruhe kommen. Klarer gesagt: Dass der politische Staat die Wider¬sprüche der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft nicht aufheben kann, hängt von seinem eigenen Wesen, von seiner eigenen Form ab, die ja gerade diese Wi¬dersprüche als Ursache hat.8”翻译为中文","output":"1. 早期马克思对市民社会与国家对立的论述 但黑格尔在这里将国家作为一个民族存在的整体与政治国家混为一谈。这种特殊并非“在国家之内”的特殊，而是“在国家之外”，即在政治国家之外。它不仅不是“在国家中实际存在的特殊”，而且还是“国家的非实体性”。黑格尔想要表明，市民社会的阶层是政治阶层，并为了证明这一点，他假设市民社会的阶层是政治国家的“特殊化”，即市民社会即是政治社会。这里的“国家中的特殊”这一表达只能理解为“国家的特殊化”。黑格尔出于负罪感选择了这一不确定的表达。他自己不仅提出了相反的观点，而且在此节中还亲自确认了这一点，他将市民社会描述为“私人阶层”。关于特殊与普遍相“连接”的定义也非常谨慎。连接可以是最不同的事物。但这里不是说一个逐渐的过渡，而是一种本质转换，想要不去看到通过跳跃本身展示出的这一鸿沟是没有用的（MEGA2 1/2, 页 87- 88; MEW 1, 页 282）。 引言 普遍性与特殊性之间的分离与对立，以及它们各自关系的状态，是现代政治哲学家面临的基本问题。如果自然法学派的传统坚持这种对立（从霍布斯到康德），尽管以不同的方式，黑格尔则坚持对立，并同时想要在两个对立的极端之间搭建一座桥梁。马克思也加入了这场讨论，以对黑格尔的内容和方法上的批评的形式，这种批评扩大到对整个新时代和现代政治哲学的批评，正是在黑格尔那里得到了发展的形式。 作为题引的段落标志着马克思加入这场讨论的切入点。他的指责是，在黑格尔的国家理论中存在一种混淆，即将国家作为一个民族存在的整体与现代的抽象政治国家混淆。根据马克思的观点，这两者不应被混淆，因为政治国家是在道德转化为法律状态的过程中产生的，这一过程解散了生动的道德。如果在道德中国家代表着一个民族存在的整体，因为“公共正义在这里作为一个民族的道德整合来实现”（Menke 1996, 页 212），那么这种形式的正义无法满足原子化个体的社会的出现和统治，这也意味着需要一种新的政治形式，这种形式适应个体的新形式出现及其相应的法律。个体自由的权利首先通过设定的权利，即抽象权利来确定，然后通过政治力量实现。因此，国家不再代表一个民族存在的整体，而是成为了与社会分离存在的政治国家。只有作为这样一个分离的实体，它才能将抽象权利付诸实施。 这一过程是政治自主化的过程，根据Menke的说法，这是建立在“法律的统治”之上的（Menke 1996, 页 10）。然而，尽管这样表述了论点，但并没有对法律统治的原因下定论。即使暂时将这一问题搁置，但已经清楚的一点是：在法律统治的状态中，国家不再代表一个民族存在的整体，因为这建立在公民的道德整合上。道德整合的公民使国家成为生动的整体。现在，国家作为一个独立于个体的领域与之对立，作为政治国家，它根据定义不再是由个体的道德整合产生的，如同在古代那样。 问题在于，如何可能混淆这两种政治形态，一旦它们被如此清楚地区分开来？事实上，黑格尔在他的早期著作中（马克思不知道的）曾经抛弃了抽象权利和由此产生的政治形态，当他将其称为一种有害于生命的力量时？尤其重要的是自然法论文，在那里黑格尔无缝地接上了柏拉图在《理想国》和《政治家》中的法律批评。但这种混淆的准备工作是通过在《精神现象学》中重新阐述这一早期批判立场完成的，正如Menke所指出的，\\"权利变革的视角在这里被打开\\" (1996, 页 227)。根据黑格尔，抽象权利是自由历史的一个必要时刻，但必须被改变或完善。哈贝马斯点出了问题的实质，当他说：“在耶拿《精神哲学》中，现在由现代市民私人法的规定所特征的法律状态，不再作为绝对道德衰败的产物出现，而恰恰相反，作为构成道德关系的第一形式”（1969, 页 41 - 42）。这将导致一个短路，因为一方面，变革假设了抽象权利的持续存在以及为了保持一致性，也假设了政治的独立；另一方面，但从黑格尔的视角看，抽象权利只能通过一种基于公民道德整合的其他形式的政治进行变革。应该也不应该有政治的独立发生。这导致了黑格尔，正如Roth正确指出的，“将‘国家’解释为波利斯（城邦）同时又是以现代意义上的国家”（1991，页 147），或者：“国家应该是波利斯，但同时又是以新时代的意义上的国家”（1991，页 184）。从马克思的视角看，这基本是一个不可能的组合，只能导致混淆。 为了避开这些矛盾，马克思对黑格尔的法律或国家理论的批评采取了一条完全不同的路径。他的理论正是从上述搁置的问题着手。如果政治的独立建立在法律的统治上，那么，马克思问，法律的统治建立在什么上呢？法律是造成道德共同体解散的原因，还是法律本身是另一个内部原因的效果，这个原因从内部解散了道德共同体？只有在澄清了这些问题之后，才能评估变革抽象权利的前景是否有意义，因为届时有关抽象权利的目的 - 寻求其真正本质的问题 - 就得到了解答。这样，关于国家的问题就获得了一个全新的视角。 马克思的目的是以费尔巴哈对宗教的批评的方式来理论化并批评国家。就像宗教不是人类意识矛盾得到缓和或和解的安息地，国家也不是人的物质生活，即市民社会的矛盾得到缓和或和解的安息地。不管是国王x还是y掌舵，党A或B掌握了权力，并不取决于这些，更关键的是在于现代国家本身的本质，即市民社会的矛盾无法得到解决。更明确地说：政治国家无法消除市民社会的矛盾，这取决于它自己的本质，它自己的形式，这正是造成这些矛盾的原因。"},{"instruction":"HI","output":"Hello!

La loi de refroidissement de Newton décrit ce phénomène de la manière suivante: [ q = hA(T_{surface} - T_{fluide}) ] où ( q ) est le flux de chaleur par unité de surface (W/m²), ( h ) est le coefficient de convection thermique (W/m²K), ( A ) est l'aire de la surface d'échange thermique (m²), ( T_{surface} ) est la température de la surface et ( T_{fluide} ) est la température du fluide. Dans le problème donné, l'air ambiant est à 20°C, et vous mentionnez un scénario où les températures peuvent chuter jusqu'à -40°C, ce qui semble désigner une variation temporelle ou conditionnelle extrême, probablement pas la situation actuelle. Le coefficient de convection ( h = 5 , text{W/m}^2text{K} ), mais pour déterminer si l'eau peut geler, il faut considérer la température effective de l'air et la capacité de l'air à refroidir l'eau à 0°C ou en dessous, le point où l'eau gèlerait. Pour simplifier, considérons que l'air ambiant reste à 20°C et que nous nous intéressons à savoir si, sous ces conditions, la flaque d'eau peut atteindre 0°C et geler. La réponse immédiate, en l'absence d'autres informations comme la taille de la flaque, la vitesse du vent (qui affecterait ( h )), ou d'autres modes de transfert de chaleur (comme le rayonnement ou la conduction vers le sol), serait a priori non pour la plupart des scénarios pratiques. À 20°C, dans des conditions ambiantes standard et avec un coefficient de convection de 5 W/m²K, l'air environnant, étant plus chaud que le point de congélation de l'eau, ne retirerait pas de chaleur de l'eau assez rapidement pour permettre à l'eau de geler; il la réchaufferait plutôt, à moins que d'autres facteurs ne viennent jouer un rôle considérable, comme une chute extrême de température non mentionnée ici. De plus, le processus de congélation dépendrait également de la température initiale de l'eau et de la durée pendant laquelle les conditions sont maintenues. Sans information sur la diminution de la température de l'air au-delà de 20°C, et en supposant que l'air reste à cette température, il est improbable que l'eau gèle simplement en raison du phénomène de convection à un ( h = 5 , text{W/m}^2text{K} ). Pour que l'eau d'une flaque d'eau géle dans ces conditions (-40°C mentionné mais avec une condition ambiante de 20°C), il faudrait une baisse significative de la température de l'air bien en dessous de 0°C, ce qui n'est pas couvert par les scénarios décrits."},{"instruction":"reponder comme un question simple et directe","output":"Non, dans les conditions données avec une température de l'air ambiant à 20°C, l'eau d'une flaque d'eau ne peut pas geler."},{"instruction":"pourquoi","output":"L'eau d'une flaque d'eau ne peut pas geler à une température de l'air ambiant de 20°C parce que l'air autour est trop chaud pour permettre à la température de l'eau de descendre au point de congélation, qui est de 0°C. Le processus de transfert de chaleur (convection dans ce cas) entre l'air et l'eau va tendre à équilibrer la température de l'eau avec celle de l'air ambiant.

Повторите команду установки: \`\`\`shell sudo pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies \`\`\` 2. **Правильность .xinitrc**: Проверьте, что ваш файл \`~/.xinitrc\` правильно изменен и сохранен. Вы должны оставить в файле только необходимые команды для запуска XFCE. Вот простой пример того, что должно быть в вашем \`.xinitrc\`: \`\`\`shell #!/bin/sh exec startxfce4 \`\`\` Убедитесь, что вы удалили или закомментировали строки, относящиеся к другим менеджерам окон или десктопам. 3. **Проблемы Путей/Окружения**: Удостоверьтесь, что команда \`startxfce4\` доступна в вашем пути выполнения. Выполните \`which startxfce4\` для проверки. Если команда не найдена, возможно, у вас проблемы с переменной PATH или XFCE не установлен корректно. 4. **Права на выполнение**: Проверьте, что файл \`~/.xinitrc\` имеет права на выполнение. Вы можете добавить эти права, используя следующую команду: \`\`\`shell chmod +x ~/.xinitrc \`\`\` 5. **Использование xinit напрямую**: Если по-прежнему не получается запустить XFCE через \`startx\`, попробуйте запустить его напрямую с помощью \`xinit\`. Обычно это делается через команду: \`\`\`shell xinit /usr/bin/startxfce4 \`\`\` Этот способ может помочь обойти проблемы с конфигурацией. 6. **Проверьте Журналы**: Посмотрите журналы Xorg, которые могут дать подсказку, почему \`startxfce4\` не запускается. Журналы обычно находятся в \`/var/log/\` или \`~/.local/share/xorg/\`. 7. **Зависимости**: Убедитесь, что у вас установлены все необходимые зависимости для \`startxfce4\`. Хотя \`pacman\` должен автоматически управлять зависимостями, возможно, что-то было пропущено. Если после всех этих шагов у вас все еще возникают проблемы, рекомендуется проверить форумы Arch Linux и документацию XFCE на предмет известных проблем или особых требований к запуску XFCE на вашей конкретной системе."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cependant, l'introduction mentionne une chute de température jusqu'à -40° dans le désert, ce qui semble être hors contexte pour le scénario directement posé. Je vais donc aborder la question basée sur l’hypothèse que la température extérieure et la condition de refroidissement sont liées aux conditions de convection autour de la flaque d’eau. Le scénario immédiat (température de l'air de 20°C et h = 5 W/m²K) ne propose pas directement une situation où l'eau gèlerait, car l'air ambiant est bien au-dessus du point de congélation de l'eau (0°C). L’eau gèle quand son environnement est à 0°C ou moins, en supposant une absence de facteurs ajoutés comme le vent ou des substances dans l'eau qui baisseraient son point de congélation. La convection joue un rôle dans le transfert de chaleur entre la surface de l'eau et l'air ambiant. Si la température de l’eau est initialement près de 0°C, et que l'air ambiant est à 20°C, en théorie, l'air réchaufferait plutôt la surface de l'eau, réduisant ainsi les chances de geler plutôt que de favoriser le gel. Pour que l’eau d’une flaque gèle, il faudrait que la température de cette eau soit ramenée à 0°C et en dessous. Sans un refroidissement externe (comme une chute de température nocturne significative sous 0°C), dans les conditions données, il est improbable que l'eau gèle. Toutefois, si le contexte envisageait une chute de température ambiante drastique, et si par exemple, cette température de -40°C mentionnée au début était atteinte, alors la dynamique changerait complètement, et oui, l'eau pourrait certainement geler si l’environnement autour de la flaque d’eau atteignait ces températures extrêmement basses. Dans le cas de la convection à une température de -40°C, la perte de chaleur de la flaque d'eau serait beaucoup plus significative, accélérant ainsi le gel de l'eau, même avec un faible coefficient de convection comme 5 W/m²K. Mais ce scénario nécessiterait des conditions bien différentes que celles énoncées initialement (20°C d’air ambiant)."},{"instruction":"zrównoleglij ten kod w c: #include <stdio.h> #include <malloc.h> #include <string.h> #include <omp.h> /* File Header */ typedef struct BMPFILEHEADER { short type; int fileSize; short reserved0; short reserved1; int dataOffset; } BMPFILEHEADER; /* Info Header */ typedef struct BMPINFOHEADER { int hdrSize; int width; int height; short planes; short depth; int compression; int bmpDataSize; int hResolution; int vResolution; int nColors; int nImportantColors; } BMPINFOHEADER; typedef struct RGB { unsigned char R; unsigned char G; unsigned char B; } Pixel24; enum Operation { FLIP, MIRROR, NONE }; const char* operationToString(enum Operation operation) { switch (operation) { case FLIP: return \\"FLIP\\"; case MIRROR: return \\"MIRROR\\"; case NONE: return \\"NONE\\"; default: return \\"UNKNOWN\\"; } } int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { FILE* plik; FILE* plik2; BMPFILEHEADER fileInfo; BMPINFOHEADER pictureInfo; int i, j; Pixel24** pixmap; enum Operation operation; if(argc==4){ plik = fopen(argv[1], \\"rb\\"); plik2 = fopen(argv[3], \\"wb\\"); } else { printf(\\"Uzycie: %s file.bpm [--flip, --mirror] newFile.bmp\\", argv[0]); return 1; } operation = strcmp(argv[2], \\"--flip\\") == 0 ?

Wszystko to wygląda na dobrze zaplanowane aby uzyskać oczekiwaną zrównoleglenie i zachować koherencję danych. Niemniej jednak, jest kilka uwag, aby upewnić się, że wszystko działa jak należy: 1. **Bezpieczeństwo wątkowe przy czytaniu plików**: Używasz \`fgetc()\` w sposób zrównoleglony do czytania danych z pliku. Operacje I/O na plikach mogą nie być bezpieczne dla wątków w bibliotece standardowej C. To szczególnie dotyczy, kiedy jednocześnie chcesz czytać z tego samego pliku w różnych wątkach. Wszystkie operacje na plikach w przykładzie (czytanie i zapis do \`plik\` i \`plik2\`) powinno być wykonane sekwencyjnie albo z odpowiednimi zabezpieczeniami, aby uniknąć wyścigów i innych problemów z dostępem do zasobów. 2. **Zwalnianie pamięci**: Pamięć przydzielona przez \`malloc\` dla \`pixmap\` i \`processedPixmap\` zostaje zwolniona, co jest dobrą praktyką. Upewnij się jednak, że robisz to także dla tablicy \`pixmap\`, analogicznie jak dla \`processedPixmap\`, aby uniknąć wycieków pamięci. 3. **Zapis i czytanie z pliku**: Ponieważ operacje zapisu wykonujesz sekwencyjnie po przetworzeniu obrazu, nie występuje ryzyko błędów spowodowanych przez równoległy zapis. Jednak upewnij się, że początkowe kopiowanie sekcji pliku przed przetwarzaniem obrazu (\`fseek(plik, 0, SEEK_SET);\` i późniejsza pętla) jest poprawne. Z tego co widzę, chcesz skopiować nagłówek pliku BMP z jednego pliku do drugiego. Jest to raczej operacja, którą należy wykonać po otwarciu plików, ale przed wczytaniem danych obrazu do pamięci. 4. **Użycie \`fgetc()\` i \`fputc()\` do manipulacji obrazem**: Podejście jest prawidłowe, ale pamiętaj, że operacje te są stosunkowo wolne w porównaniu do innych form odczytu/zapisu, takich jak \`fread()\` lub \`fwrite()\`, które mogą przetwarzać wiele bajtów naraz. Nawet jeśli zrównoleglisz przetwarzanie danych, sekwencyjny zapis wąskim gardłem może być zapis/odczyt pojedynczych bajtów. Ogólnie, twoje podejście do rozwiązania problemu i organizacji kodu jest na dobrej drodze. Warto jednak przemyśleć i przetestować obsługę plików i zapewnienie thread-safety dla operacji czytania, aby uniknąć potencjalnych problemów."},{"instruction":"popraw mój kod","output":"Aby poprawić Twój kod, skoncentruję się na kilku kluczowych kwestiach związanych z bezpieczeństwem operacji wejścia-wyjścia oraz zarządzaniem pamięcią.

Zamiast tego kładziemy nacisk na zrównoleglenie przetwarzania pikseli. 2. **Poprawki w obsłudze plików**: Upewnij się, że skopiowałeś nagłówek pliku bmp przed rozpoczęciem przetwarzania i przepisywaniem danych pikseli. 3. **Zastosowanie \`fread\` i \`fwrite\` zamiast \`fgetc\` i \`fputc\`**: To zwiększa wydajność odczytu i zapisu danych, ponieważ operujemy na blokach danych zamiast na pojedynczych bajtach. \`\`\`c // Twoje #include // Twoje typedef dla BMPFILEHEADER, BMPINFOHEADER, RGB, enum Operation itd. const char* operationToString(enum Operation operation); int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { /* Poprzedni fragment kodu inicjalizacji */ if (plik && plik2) { // Odczyt nagłówków itd, nie zmieniam tej części // Tutaj możesz załadować cały obrazek do pamięci na raz, jeśli jest na to miejsce // Ale zostawmy jak jest, dla dużych obrazów jest to rozsądne Pixel24* pixmap = malloc(pictureInfo.height * pictureInfo.width * sizeof(Pixel24)); // Odczyt danych pikseli do tablicy pixmap fseek(plik, fileInfo.dataOffset, SEEK_SET); for (i = 0; i < pictureInfo.height; i++) { fread(pixmap + i * pictureInfo.width, sizeof(Pixel24), pictureInfo.width, plik); fseek(plik, padding, SEEK_CUR); } double start_time = omp_get_wtime(); if (operation == FLIP) { #pragma omp parallel for private(j) for (i = 0; i < pictureInfo.height / 2; i++) { for (j = 0; j < pictureInfo.width; j++) { // Zamiana pikseli w pionie int index1 = i * pictureInfo.width + j; int index2 = (pictureInfo.height - 1 - i) * pictureInfo.width + j; Pixel24 temp = pixmap[index1]; pixmap[index1] = pixmap[index2]; pixmap[index2] = temp; } } } else if (operation == MIRROR) { #pragma omp parallel for private(j) for (i = 0; i < pictureInfo.height; i++) { for (j = 0; j < pictureInfo.width / 2; j++) { // Zamiana pikseli w poziomie int index1 = i * pictureInfo.width + j; int index2 = i * pictureInfo.width + (pictureInfo.width - 1 - j); Pixel24 temp = pixmap[index1]; pixmap[index1] = pixmap[index2]; pixmap[index2] = temp; } } } double end_time = omp_get_wtime(); // Zapis danych pikseli oraz nagłówka pliku // Najpierw przekopiuj nagłówek z oryginalnego pliku rewind(plik); // powrót na początek pliku oryginalnego char header[fileInfo.dataOffset]; fread(header, 1, fileInfo.dataOffset, plik); fwrite(header, 1, fileInfo.dataOffset, plik2); // Zapis przetworzonych danych pikseli, uwzględniając padding for (i = 0; i < pictureInfo.height; i++) { fwrite(pixmap + i * pictureInfo.width, sizeof(Pixel24), pictureInfo.width, plik2); for (j = 0; j < padding; j++) { fputc(0, plik2); // dostosowanie paddingu } } printf(\\"Czas przetwarzania: %f sekundn\\", end_time - start_time); free(pixmap); fclose(plik2); fclose(plik); } else { printf(\\"Blad odczytu pliku\\"); } return 0; } // Twoje funkcje pomocnicze \`\`\` Ten kod zakłada sekwencyjny odczyt początku pliku BMP do pamięci oraz zapis tego samego nagłówka do nowego pliku przed dokonaniem jakichkolwiek operacji przetwarzania obrazu. Następnie operacje na obrazie są zrównoleglane, a zmienione piksele są z powrotem zapisywane do pliku wyjściowego w sekwencyjnym porządku. Użycie funkcji \`fread\` i \`fwrite\` zwiększa wydajność przez operowanie na większych blokach danych."},{"instruction":"Я арендовал жилой дом. По договору аренды, если арендодатель инициирует расторжение договора аренды, то он выплачивает мне как арендатору неустойку в размере половины месячной суммы аренды. Сейчас арендодатель инициировал расторжение договора аренды. В соответствии с российским законодательством, в течение какого срока он должен перечислить мне эту неустойку? Сошлись на нормы законов и упомяни их.","output":"В соответствии с российским законодательством, конкретного срока для выплаты неустойки, установленного именно в случае расторжения договора аренды жилого помещения, в законе прямо не указано. Однако, стороны могут установить такой срок в самом договоре аренды. Если же такой срок не установлен, то исходить следует из общих норм Гражданского кодекса РФ (ГК РФ). Основания и последствия расторжения договора аренды регулируются статьями 610, 614, 615 ГК РФ, однако они не содержат информацию по срокам выплаты неустойки. В такой ситуации применима статья 330 ГК РФ, которая гласит, что если обязательство не исполнено в срок, неустойка (штраф, пеня) подлежит уплате за время просрочки исполнения обязательства. Исходя из этого, неустойка должна быть выплачена после того, как будет фактически наступила просрочка выполнения обязательства по выплате. Так, если датой расторжения договора является определенное число, неустойка должна быть выплачена в разумный срок после этой даты, исходя из общих принципов исполнения обязательств. Также, статья 314 ГК РФ устанавливает, что исполнение обязательств должно осуществляться в разумный срок, если срок не определен условиями обязательства или существом обязательства. В вашем случае, если в договоре явно не указан срок для выплаты неустойки, ее выплата должна производиться в \\"разумный срок\\" после расторжения договора аренды. Что касается \\"разумного\\" срока, здесь уже идет трактовка судебной практики, и он может варьироваться в зависимости от обстоятельств дела. Если возникают споры относительно сроков выплаты, решение может быть найдено через обращение в суд. Таким образом, для ответа на ваш вопрос необходимо исходить из условий вашего договора, а при их отсутствии – из \\"разумного срока\\", основываясь на общих принципах гражданского законодательства РФ, в частности, на статьях 314 и 330 ГК РФ."},{"instruction":"как задать время жизни для записи в питоне в redis","output":"Для установки времени жизни (expiration time) для записи в Redis при использовании Python, можно воспользоваться библиотекой \`redis-py\`. Время жизни записи задаётся в секундах, и после истечения этого времени запись будет автоматически удалена из Redis. Вот как вы можете это сделать: \`\`\`python import redis # Подключение к Redis r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0) # Установка значения ключа key = \\"some_key\\" value = \\"Hello, Redis!\\" r.set(key, value) # Установка времени жизни для ключа в секундах ttl = 10 # Время жизни 10 секунд r.expire(key, ttl) # Можно также установить значение и время жизни одной командой r.setex(key, ttl, value) \`\`\` В этом примере: - Первоначально устанавливается значение ключа \`some_key\` в Redis. - Затем для этого ключа устанавливается время жизни (Time To Live, TTL) с помощью метода \`expire\`. В приведённом примере \`ttl\` равно 10 секундам. - Альтернативный способ — использовать метод \`setex\`, который позволяет одновременно установить значение ключа и его время жизни. Это более компактный и предпочтительный способ, если вам сразу известны и значение, и необходимое время жизни. Оба эти метода позволяют автоматически удалять данные из базы Redis по истечению указанного времени, что может быть полезно для реализации кэширования или других задач, где данные актуальны только в течение определённого временного промежутка."},{"instruction":"а для hset","output":"Для установки времени жизни (TTL) записи, созданной с помощью команды \`HSET\` в Redis, используя библиотеку \`redis-py\` для Python, надо выполнить несколько шагов. К сожалению, прямого способа установить TTL одновременно с выполнением \`HSET\` нет, так как \`HSET\` работает с хешами и TTL устанавливается для всего ключа хеша, а не для отдельных полей внутри хеша. То есть, если вы хотите установить TTL для определённого хеша, вы должны сначала использовать \`HSET\` для установки значения, а затем \`EXPIRE\` для установки TTL для всего ключа. Вот пример: \`\`\`python import redis # Подключение к Redis r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0) # Название ключа хеша hash_key = \\"my_hash\\" # Добавление поля и его значения в хеш r.hset(hash_key, \\"field1\\", \\"value1\\") # Установка времени жизни для всего хеша ttl = 30 # Время жизни 30 секунд r.expire(hash_key, ttl) \`\`\` В этом примере: 1. Используется \`HSET\` для добавления поля \`field1\` со значением \`value1\` в хеш \`my_hash\`. 2. Через \`EXPIRE\` устанавливается время жизни (TTL) для всего ключа хеша. В данном случае хеш и все его содержимое будут автоматически удалены через 30 секунд. Если ваше приложение требует отдельные TTL для каждого поля внутри хеша, возможно, вам придется пересмотреть структуру данных и использовать отдельные ключи вместо полей внутри хеша, поскольку Redis не поддерживает TTL для отдельных полей хеша. В таком случае каждый элемент данных может быть представлен отдельным ключом с его собственным TTL."},{"instruction":"а по умолчани hset сколько времени живет","output":"В Redis, когда вы используете команду \`HSET\` для добавления полей в хеш, у создаваемого хеша не устанавливается время жизни (TTL, Time To Live) по умолчанию, то есть его TTL считается неограниченным. Это означает, что элементы, добавленные с помощью \`HSET\`, будут храниться в базе данных Redis до тех пор, пока они не будут явно удалены командами удаления (например, \`DEL\` для удаления всего ключа или \`HDEL\` для удаления определённых полей в хеше) или не истечёт установленное TTL, если вы явно установите время жизни для ключа с помощью команды \`EXPIRE\`. Если вам нужно, чтобы данные хранились в Redis только ограниченное время, вам необходимо явно установить TTL с помощью команды \`EXPIRE\` (для всего ключа) или использовать другой механизм для контроля времени жизни данных. Обратите внимание, что время жизни устанавливается на весь ключ, а не на отдельные поля внутри хеша, как уже упоминалось ранее. Пример использования \`EXPIRE\` для установки TTL для хеша: \`\`\`python import redis # Подключение к Redis r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0) # Добавление поля в хеш r.hset(\\"my_hash\\", \\"field1\\", \\"value1\\") # Установка времени жизни (TTL) для хеша r.expire(\\"my_hash\\", 3600) # TTL 1 час \`\`\` В этом примере хеш \`my_hash\` будет автоматически удалён из базы данных Redis через 1 час после установки TTL."},{"instruction":"а если редис перезапускается все данные удаляются?","output":"Поведение Redis при перезапуске зависит от его конфигурации сохранения данных. Redis может работать в двух основных режимах: 1. **Без сохранения на диск (Volatile mode)**: В этом режиме все данные хранятся только в оперативной памяти. Если сервер Redis будет перезапущен (например, из-за сбоя или планового обновления), все данные будут утеряны. Этот режим используется, когда Redis применяется исключительно в качестве кэша, и потеря данных не критична. 2. **Сохранение на диск**: Redis предоставляет несколько механизмов для сохранения данных на диск, благодаря которым данные могут быть восстановлены после перезапуска сервера. Основные механизмы сохранения данных в Redis: - **Snapshotting (RDB)**: Redis можно настроить на автоматическое сохранение полного снимка (snapshot) всего набора данных через определённые интервалы времени. Если сервер перезапускается, Redis восстанавливает все данные из последнего снимка. Преимущество этого метода заключается в эффективности и быстром восстановлении данных, однако между моментами снимков какие-то данные могут потеряться. - **Append-only file (AOF)**: В этом режиме Redis записывает каждую операцию изменения данных в файл в конце базы данных. При перезапуске Redis переигрывает эти команды для восстановления данных. AOF может быть настроен на сохранение данных с разной частотой, обеспечивая компромисс между производительностью и риском потери данных. AOF обычно позволяет восстановить данные более полно, чем RDB, но может работать медленнее при восстановлении из-за большого количества операций. Redis может быть настроен на использование как RDB, так и AOF одновременно. В таком случае при перезапуске для восстановления данных будет использоваться AOF, так как он обычно содержит более полную историю изменений данных. **Конфигурация Redis**: Настройки сохранения данных и выбор между RDB, AOF или их сочетанием определяются в конфигурационном файле Redis (\`redis.conf\`). Решение о выборе способа сохранения зависит от требований приложения к скорости сохранения и восстановления данных, а также к допустимой потере данных в случае сбоя."},{"instruction":"а по умолчанию какие стоит?","output":"По умолчанию Redis использует механизм снимков (snapshots) для сохранения данных на диск. Это означает, что он автоматически сохраняет полные снимки всего набора данных через определенные интервалы времени, если были выполнены определенные операции изменения данных. Параметры по умолчанию для снимков в файле конфигурации \`redis.conf\` обычно выглядят так: \`\`\` save 900 1 save 300 10 save 60 10000 \`\`\` Эти строки указывают Redis создавать снимок данных: - Каждые 900 секунд (15 минут), если по крайней мере 1 ключ был изменен. - Каждые 300 секунд (5 минут), если по крайней мере 10 ключей были изменены. - Каждые 60 секунд, если по крайней мере 10000 ключей были изменены. Однако важно отметить, что настройки Redis могут быть изменены, и эти параметры могут отличаться в зависимости от конфигурации Redis на вашем сервере. Что касается файла журнала записи для дополнения (Append-only file, AOF), то по умолчанию этот механизм отключен. Вы можете активировать AOF, изменив конфигурационный файл Redis и установив параметр \`appendonly\` в \`yes\`. \`\`\` appendonly no # по умолчанию \`\`\` Измените на: \`\`\` appendonly yes \`\`\` Если AOF включен, Redis будет записывать каждую выполняемую операцию изменения данных в файл AOF. Это обеспечивает более высокий уровень долговечности данных за счет некоторого снижения производительности. В зависимости от ваших требований к сохранности данных и производительности, вы можете настроить использование только RDB, только AOF, или оба этих метода одновременно для достижения оптимального баланса. Redis позволяет детально настраивать эти параметры для удовлетворения различных требований приложений."},{"instruction":"то есть можно не париться о потере данных при подключении через питон","output":"При использовании Redis в ваших Python-приложениях, уровень гарантии сохранности ваших данных в значительной степени зависит от конфигурации самого Redis. Если Ваш Redis сервер настроен на использование механизмов сохранения данных, таких как RDB (снимки базы данных) или AOF (файл журнала для дополнения), то риск потери данных в случае сбоя или перезапуска сервера минимизируется. Основные моменты, которые стоит учитывать: 1. **Сохранение снимков (Snapshotting с помощью RDB)**: Этот механизм по умолчанию включен и он может защитить ваши данные, создавая периодические снимки состояния базы данных. Однако, в зависимости от настроек, изменения, сделанные с момента последнего снимка, могут быть потеряны при сбое. 2. **Файл журнала для дополнения (AOF)**: При включении этого механизма каждая операция, изменяющая данные, будет записываться в файл, что позволяет восстановить состояние базы данных с максимальной точностью до момента сбоя. Этот механизм по умолчанию выключен, но его можно активировать для усиления гарантий сохранности данных. 3. **Различные потребности приложений**: В зависимости от критичности данных для вашего приложения и требований к производительности, вы можете выбрать разные настройки сохранения. Некоторые приложения могут допустить короткое окно потери данных в обмен на более высокую производительность, тогда как для других приложений каждая операция должна быть надёжно сохранена. 4. **Резервное копирование**: Независимо от внутренних механизмов Redis, регулярное создание резервных копий ваших данных на отдельном физическом носителе или в облачном хранилище может служить дополнительной мерой безопасности для критически важных данных. 5. **Тестирование и мониторинг**: Рекомендуется регулярно тестировать процесс восстановления данных из снимков и AOF-файлов, а также наладить мониторинг для отслеживания работы Redis и своевременного реагирования на возможные проблемы. В итоге, если вы настроили Redis с учетом потребностей вашего приложения и приняли соответствующие меры по его резервному копированию и мониторингу, вам не придётся особенно беспокоиться о потере данных при работе через Python или любой другой клиентский интерфейс к Redis."},{"instruction":"получается в docker compose необходимо для редис установить volumesd","output":"Да, если вы хотите гарантировать сохранность данных Redis при перезапуске контейнера или Docker, вы должны использовать тома (volumes) в вашем \`docker-compose.yml\` файле.

Пример конфигурации \`docker-compose.yml\`, включающей Redis с использованием тома для хранения данных: \`\`\`yaml version: '3' services: redis: image: \\"redis\\" command: redis-server --appendonly yes # Если вы хотите использовать AOF ports: - \\"6379:6379\\" volumes: - redis-data:/data volumes: redis-data: \`\`\` В этой конфигурации: - \`redis-data\` объявляется как том и используется для хранения данных Redis.

В данном случае, для демонстрации, добавлено \`--appendonly yes\` для активации AOF (Append Only File) механизма сохранения, который записывает каждую операцию изменения данных в файл. Это не обязательно, если вы предпочитаете использовать стандартную стратегию сохранения данных через снимки (RDB), или если вы будете управлять конфигурацией Redis через собственный файл конфигурации. **Примечание:** Помните, что использование томов в Docker для критически важных баз данных является хорошей практикой, поскольку это обеспечивает сохранность данных и упрощает их резервное копирование и миграцию."},{"instruction":"как написать тесты для fastapi","output":"Для написания тестов в FastAPI рекомендуется использовать \`pytest\` вместе с \`TestClient\` из \`fastapi.testclient\`.

Пример без \`decode_responses=True\`: \`\`\`python import redis r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0) # При получении строки из Redis, результат будет в байтах value = r.get('mykey') print(type(value)) # <class 'bytes'> # Декодирование в строку 'utf-8' if value is not None: value = value.decode('utf-8') print(type(value)) # <class 'str'> \`\`\` Пример с \`decode_responses=True\`: \`\`\`python import redis r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True) # При получении строки из Redis, результат будет автоматически декодирован в строку value = r.get('mykey') print(type(value)) # <class 'str'> \`\`\` Во втором примере использование \`decode_responses=True\` при создании экземпляра \`redis.Redis\` автоматически декодирует ответы из Redis в строки, что упрощает работу со строковыми данными. Использование \`decode_responses=True\` может быть особенно удобным при работе с текстовыми данными, сохраненными в Redis, поскольку оно позволяет избегать дополнительного шага преобразования типов данных в вашем коде. Однако помните, что этот параметр следует использовать с учетом типа данных, с которым вы работаете, так как он автоматически применяется ко всем ответам клиента Redis."},{"instruction":"как запустить coverage в fast api","output":"Для запуска \`coverage\` в FastAPI (или для любого Python проекта в целом), вы можете следовать нескольким простым шагам. \`coverage\` - это инструмент, позволяющий измерять процент кода вашего приложения, покрытый тестами.

Der Gegensatz von bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat beim frühen Marx Aber Hegel verwechselt hier den Staat als das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes mit dem politischen Staat. Jenes Besondere ist nicht das „Besondere im“, sondern vielmehr „äusser dem Staate“, nämlich dem politischen Staate. Es ist nicht nur nicht „das im Staate wirkliche Besondere“, sondern auch die „Unwirklichkeit des Staates“. Hegel will entwickeln, daß die Stände der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft die politischen Stände sind, und um dieß zu beweisen, unterstellt er, daß die Stände der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft die „Besonderung des politischen Staates“, d.i., daß die bürgerliche Gesellschaft die politische Gesellschaft ist. Der Ausdruck: „Das Besondere im Staate“ kann hier nur Sinn haben als: „Die Besonderung des Staates“. H. wählt aus einem bösen Gewissen den unbestimmten Ausdruck. Er selbst hat nicht nur das Gegenteil entwickelt, er bestätigt es noch selbst in diesem §, indem er die bürgerliche Gesellschaft als „Privatstand“ bezeichnet. Sehr vorsichtig ist auch die Bestimmung, daß sich das Besondere an das Allgemeine „anknüpft“. Anknüpfen kann man die heterogensten Dinge. Es handelt sich hier aber nicht um einen allmählichen Uebergang, sondern um eine Transsubstantiation, und es nützt nichts, diese Kluft, die übersprungen und durch den Sprung selbst de- monstrirt wird, nicht sehn zu wollen (MEGA2 1/2, S. 87- 88; MEW 1, S. 282). Einleitendes Die Trennung und der Gegensatz zwischen Allgemeinheit und Besonderheit und der Status ihrer jeweiligen Beziehung ist die Fundamentalfrage, die sich für die politischen Philosophen an der Schwelle der Moderne aufwirft. Wenn die Tradition der Naturrechtstheoretiker, wenngleich in unterschiedlicher Weise (von Hobbes bis Kant), auf dem Gegensatz beharrt, hält Hegel am Gegensatz fest und will zugleich eine Brücke zwischen beiden Polen des Gegensatzes herstellen. Auch Marx schließt sich an diese Diskussion an, und zwar in Gestalt einer inhaltlichen und methodischen Kritik an Hegel, die sich zu einer Kritik an der gesamten politischen Philosophie der Neuzeit und Moderne ausweitet, die gerade bei Hegel ihre entwickelte Gestalt erhält. Die als Epigraph zitierte Passage markiert die Schnittstelle, an der Marx an diese Diskussion anschließt. Sein Vorwurf ist, dass in Hegels Staatstheorie eine Verwechselung stattfindet, und zwar die Verwechselung des Staates als das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes mit dem modernen, abstrakten politischen Staat. Beide sind nach Marx nicht zu verwechseln, weil der politische Staat in einer Transformation der Sittlichkeit in einen Rechtszustand entsteht, der die lebendige Sittlichkeit auflöst. Wenn in der Sittlichkeit der Staat für das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes steht, denn die „öffentliche Gerechtigkeit vollzieht sich hier als die sittliche Integration eines Volkes“ (Menke 1996, S. 212), so gilt, dass diese Form der Gerechtigkeit nicht dem Entstehen und der Vorherrschaft der Gesellschaft der atomisierten Individuen gerecht werden kann, was dann auch bedeutet, dass eine andere Form des Politischen notwendig wird, die dieser neuen Form des Auftretens der Individuen und des ihm entsprechenden Rechts gerecht wird. Das Recht der subjektiven Freiheit wird zunächst durch das Recht festgelegt, das abstrakte Recht, und dann durch die politische Gewalt geltend gemacht. Der Staat entspricht deswegen nicht mehr dem Ganzen des Daseins eines Volkes, sondern er ist politischer Staat geworden, der getrennt von der Gesellschaft existiert.1 Nur als solche getrennte Instanz kann er das abstrakte Recht zur Geltung bringen. Dieser Prozess ist der Prozess der Verselbständigung des Politischen, die Menke zufolge in der „Herrschaft des Rechts“ (Menke 1996, S. 10) gründet. Mit der Formulierung der These in diesen Termini ist aber noch kein Urteil über den Grund der Herrschaft des Rechts gefallen. Auch wenn man dieses Problem zunächst einmal im Hintergrund stehen lässt, so wird doch schon eins deutlich: Im Zustand der Herrschaft des Rechts steht der Staat nicht mehr für das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes, denn dieses basiert auf der sittlichen Integration der Bürger. Die sittliche Integration der Bürger macht den Staat als das lebendige Ganze aus. Steht nun der Staat als eine von den Individuen verselbständigte Sphäre diesen gegenüber, als politischer Staat, dann entsteht er per definitionem nicht mehr aus der sittlichen Integration der Individuen, wie bei den Antiken.2 Die Frage ist nun, wie es möglich ist, diese zwei Formen des Politischen zu verwechseln, wenn sie einmal so klar auseinandergehalten worden sind? In der Tat hat Hegel in seinen frühen Schriften (die Marx nicht kannte) das abstrakte Recht und die aus ihm entspringenden politischen Formen verworfen, als er es als eine lebensfeindliche Macht ausgesprochen hatte? Besonders wichtig für diese These ist der Naturrechtsaufsatz, in dem sich Hegel nahtlos an Platons Rechtskritik in der Politeia und im Politikos anschließt. Die Verwechslung wird aber vorbereitet, indem dieser frühe kritische Standpunkt in der Phänomenologie des Geistes umformuliert wird, in der sich, wie Menke bemerkt, die „Perspektive auf eine Veränderung des Rechts öffnet“ (1996, S. 227).4 Das abstrakte Recht ist laut Hegel ein notwendiges Moment der Geschichte der Freiheit, muss aber verändert werden bzw. vervollständigt werden.5 Habermas bringt die Sache auf den Punkt, wenn er sagt: „In der Jenenser Philosophie des Geistes erscheint demgegenüber der Rechtszustand, der nun auch durch die Bestimmungen des modernen bürgerlichen Privatrechts charakterisiert ist, nicht mehr als ein Produkt des Zerfalls der absoluten Sittlichkeit, sondern im Gegenteil als die erste Gestalt des konstituierten sittlichen Verhältnisses“ (1969, S, 41 - 42).6 Dies wird zu einem Kurzschluss führen, denn zum einen unterstellt die Veränderung das Bleiben des abstrakten Rechts und, um konsequent zu sein, auch die Verselbständigung des Politischen; zum anderen aber kann das abstrakte Recht aus Hegelscher Sicht nur durch eine andere Form des Politischen verändert werden, nämlich die, die auf der sittlichen Integration der Bürger beruht. Es soll und es soll nicht die Verselbständigung des Politischen stattfinden. Dies führt Hegel dazu, wie Roth zutreffend bemerkt, „den „Staat“ als Polis und zugleich als Staat im modernen Sinne“ (1991, S. 147) zu interpretieren, oder: „Der Staat soll Polis, aber doch zugleich Staat im neuzeitlichen Sinne sein“ (1991, S. 184).7 Aus Marx’ Sicht ist dies prinzipiell eine unmögliche Komposition, die nur auf eine Verwechselung hinauslaufen kann. Um diesen Aporien zu entgehen schlägt Marx’ Kritik an Hegels Theorie des Rechts bzw. des Staates einen ganz anderen Weg ein. Seine Theorie setzt genau an der oben beiseite gestellten Frage an. Wenn die Verselbständigung des Politischen auf der Herrschaft des Rechts beruht, worauf beruht, so stellt Marx die Frage, die Herrschaft des Rechts? Ist das Recht die Ursache der Auflösung des sittlichen Gemeinwesens, oder ist das Recht selbst die Wirkung einer anderen grundlegenden Ursache, die das sittliche Gemeinwesen von innen auflöste? Nur nach Klärung dieser Fragen lässt sich bewerten, ob die Perspektive der Veränderung des abstrakten Rechts sinnvoll ist, weil dann die Frage nach den Zwecken des abstrakten Rechts - die Frage nach seinem realen Wesen - beantwortet ist. Damit erhält die Frage nach dem Staat eine ganz neue Perspektive. Marx’ bezweckt eine Theorie und Kritik des Staates in Sinne von Feuerbachs Kritik der Religion. Genauso wie die Religion nicht der Ruhepunkt ist, in dem die Widersprüche des menschlichen Bewusstseins aufgehoben bzw. versöhnt werden, so ist auch der Staat nicht der Ruhepunkt, in dem die Widersprüche des materiellen Lebens des Menschen, d.h. der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft aufgehoben bzw. versöhnt werden. Es hängt nicht davon ab, ob König x oder y am Staatsruder ist, dass Partei A oder B die Macht übernommen hat, vielmehr liegt es im Wesen des modernen Staates selber, dass die Widersprüche der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft nicht zur Ruhe kommen. Klarer gesagt: Dass der politische Staat die Widersprüche der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft nicht aufheben kann, hängt von seinem eigenen Wesen, von seiner eigenen Form ab, die ja gerade diese Widersprüche als Ursache hat.8 ”翻译为中文","output":"1. 早期马克思对于民间社会与国家对立的观点 然而，黑格尔在此将国家作为一个民族全部存在的整体与政治国家混淆了。这一特殊不是位于“国家内”的，而是位于“国家之外”，即政治国家之外。它不仅不是“国家内实际存在的特殊”，而且还是“国家的非实在性”。黑格尔想要阐明的是，民间社会的各阶层即是政治阶层，为了证明这一点，他假设民间社会的各阶层是政治国家的“特殊化”，即民间社会即是政治社会。表述：“国家内的特殊”在这里只有作为“国家的特殊化”才有意义。黑格尔出于内疚选择了一个模糊的表述。他自己不仅阐发了相反的观点，他在这一节中还亲自确认了这一点，将民间社会称为“私人阶层”。将特殊与普遍“联系起来”的定义也非常谨慎。联系起来可以是最不同的事物。然而，这里讨论的不是一个逐渐的过渡，而是一种质变，忽视这一跨越和通过跨越本身展现的鸿沟是没有用的（MEGA2 1/2, 页87-88; MEW 1, 页282）。 引言 普遍性与特殊性的分离和对立，以及它们各自关系的地位，是站在现代门槛上的政治哲学家们面临的基本问题。如果自然法理论家的传统，尽管以不同的方式（从霍布斯到康德），坚持这种对立，黑格尔则坚持这种对立，并同时希望建立两极之间的桥梁。马克思也参与了这一讨论，以对黑格尔的内容和方法上的批判形式加入，这一批判扩展为对整个现代政治哲学的批判，这一哲学在黑格尔那里获得了其发展的形式。 作为引文引用的段落标志着马克思加入这一讨论的接口。他的指责是，在黑格尔的国家理论中发生了混淆，即将国家作为一个民族全部存在的整体与现代抽象的政治国家混淆。按照马克思的观点，这两者不应混淆，因为政治国家是在道德转变为法律状态的过程中产生的，这一过程解散了活生生的道德。如果在道德中，国家代表了一个民族全部的存在，“那么公正在这里体现为一个民族的道德整合”（Menke 1996, 页212），这意味着，这种形式的正义不能适应碎片化个体社会的出现和主导，这也就意味着需要一种新形式的政治，来适应个体的新形式出现及其相应的法律。个体自由权利首先通过法律得到规定，即抽象法律，然后通过政治力量实施。因此国家不再代表一个民族全部的存在，而是成为了与社会分离存在的政治国家。只有作为这样一个分离的实体，它才能实现抽象法律。 这一过程是政治的自主化过程，根据Menke的说法，这一过程建立在“法律的统治”（Menke 1996, 页10）上。尽管用这些术语提出这个论点，并没有对法律统治的原因作出判断。即使最初将这个问题放在一边，但已经很明显了：在法律统治的状态下，国家不再代表一个民族全部的存在，因为这基于公民的道德整合。公民的道德整合使国家成为活生生的整体。现在，作为一个独立于个体的领域的国家，作为政治国家，它根据定义不再源于个体的道德整合，正如古人所做的。2 问题是，如果这两种政治形式曾经被如此清晰地区分开，它们是如何被混淆的？实际上，黑格尔在他的早期著作中（马克思不了解这些著作）否定了抽象法律及其产生的政治形式，当他明确称其为一种对生命的敌意力量时？特别重要的是自然法论文，黑格尔在其中与柏拉图在《共和国》和《政治家》中的法律批判无缝对接。但混淆被准备好了，因为这一早期的批判立场在《精神现象学》中重新表述，正如Menke所注意到的，“法律变革的视角在此被打开”（1996, 页227）。4 据黑格尔，抽象法律是自由历史的必要时刻，但必须被改变或完成。5 哈贝马斯指出，“在耶拿《精神哲学》中，现在也通过现代民间私法的规定特征化的法律状态，不再被视为绝对道德沦丧的产物，相反，它被视为构成的道德关系的第一形式”（1969，41-42页）。6 这将导致一个逻辑短路，因为一方面，变化假设了抽象法律的持续存在，并且，为了保持一致，也假设了政治的自主化；另一方面，但是从黑格尔的视角看，抽象法律只能通过另一种形式的政治被改变，即那些基于公民的道德整合。这既预期也不预期政治的自主化。这使得黑格尔，如Roth正确指出的，“将‘国家’解释为同时是波利斯和现代意义上的国家”（1991，页147），或者：“国家既是波利斯，又是新时代的国家”（1991，页184）。7 从马克思的视角来看，这本质上是一个不可能的组合，只会导致混淆。 为了避免这些困境，马克思对黑格尔的法律或国家理论的批判采取了一种完全不同的方式。他的理论正是从上面搁置的问题开始的。如果政治的自主化建立在法律的统治上，马克思问道，法律的统治建立在什么上呢？是法律导致了道德共同体的解散，还是法律本身是另一个更基本的原因的效果，这个原因从内部解散了道德共同体？只有在解答这些问题之后，才能评估改变抽象法律的视角是否有意义，因为这时对抽象法律的目的——对其真实本质的问题——已经得到了回答。由此，关于国家的问题获得了一个全新的视角。 马克思的目的是在费尔巴哈对宗教的批判意义上对国家进行理论和批判。就像宗教不是人类意识矛盾得到消解或和解的静止点一样，国家也不是人们物质生活中的矛盾，即民间社会的矛盾得到消解或和解的静止点。这不取决于国王x或y掌舵，也不取决于哪个政党A或B掌权，而在于现代国家本身的本质，即民间社会的矛盾无法平息。更明确地说：政治国家无法消除民间社会的矛盾，这取决于它自己的本质，它自己的形式，正是这种形式导致了这些矛盾。8"},{"instruction":"请将“Marx’ frühe Kritik an Hegels Staatstheorie konzentriert sich auf zwei Hauptpunkte, nämlich die Behauptung, dass sich (i) bürgerliche Gesellschaft und Staat als zwei entgegengesetzte Wesen gegenüberstehen (ihre Trennung existiert als ein wirklicher Gegensatz, wobei Marx an der von Hegel dargestellten Trennung festhält), und (ii), dass das Hegelsche Be-gründungsverhältnis von bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat umgekehrt werden muss, denn die bürgerliche Gesellschaft gilt bei Hegel, wie Marx moniert, als Besonderung des Staates, d.h. sie ist eine Besonderung im Staat. Hegel geht von der sittlichen Einheit aus, entwickelt daraus die Besonderheit der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft und kehrt von da aus zur Allgemeinheit des Staates zurück. Beide Punkte, die Marx’ politische Philosophie durchziehen, ergänzen sich in reziproker Weise. Denn die These, dass bürgerliche Gesellschaft und Staat in einem wirklichen Gegensatz stehen, erfordert die Erklärung des „warum“ beide in einem Gegensatzverhältnis stehen. Um diesen beiden Punkten gerecht zu werden, ist zugleich der Naturgrund des modernen Staates freizulegen. Und es muss auch hergeleitet werden, was in diesem Verhältnis bestimmt und was bestimmend ist. Während Hegel den Gegensatz vom Standpunkt des sittlichen Staates her erklärt (er nimmt den Staat als das Ganze des Daseins eines Volks) und die bürgerliche Gesellschaft als Besonderung bzw. Differenzierung des Staates ausspricht, geht Marx umgekehrt von der Aufklärung der Struktur der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft aus. Thesenhaft formuliert macht dies den inhaltlichen Gegensatz zwischen dem Hegelsehen und dem Marxschen Ansatz aus, der auch nur konsistent unter der Voraussetzung einer gegensätzlichen methodischen Konzeption gedacht werden kann. Marx’ Einwand lässt sich so formulieren: Hegel habe in seinen Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts einerseits bürgerliche Gesellschaft und Staat als getrennte Sphären entwickelt, sie als einen Gegensatz gefasst, aber anderseits habe er den Versuch unternommen, die Identität zwischen beiden im politischen Staat wiederherzustellen, was gerade das Verständnis des Verhältnisses von bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat als einen Gegensatz unterläuft. Die unter die Lupe zu nehmende Frage ist, wie diese doppelte Bewegung methodisch und inhaltlich verständlich gemacht werden kann. Aufgrund des in der modernen Gesellschaft herrschenden Prinzips der Subjektivität (§ 124) bzw. der Verfolgung der Privatinteressen, erkennt Hegel in den Grundlinien die Notwendigkeit einer Sphäre, in der das Individuum sich als ein mit eigenem Recht und Zwecken begabtes Individuum realisieren kann (§ 184). Dies ist die bürgerliche Gesellschaft. Damit fallen Allgemeinheit und Besonderheit wie in der unmittelbaren Sittlichkeit der antiken Polis nicht mehr unmittelbar zusammen (§ 185), sie sind fortan heterogene Lebensformen (das bürgerliche und das politische Leben). „Indem Hegel die bürgerliche Gesellschaft als Privatstand bezeichnet, hat er die Ständeunterschiede der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft für mcZtfpolitische Unterschiede erklärt, hat er das bürgerliche Leben und das politische für heterogen, sogar für Gegensätze erklärt“ (MEGA21/2, S. 85; MEW 1, S. 280), so Marx’ These. Ein Motiv für den Identitätsanspruch ist die Erkenntnis, dass die bürgerliche Gesellschaft wegen ihrer Widersprüchlichkeit außerstande ist, selbstständig eine positive Identität zu entwickeln, dass sie sich ohne eine solche Identität selbst zerstören würde.9 Um diese Identität zu erreichen, bedarf sie einer äußerlichen Vermittlung. Lediglich der Staat als Wirklichkeit der sittlichen Idee kann die bürgerliche Gesellschaft zu ihrer Wahrheit erheben, und weil der Staat diese synthetisierende Macht hat, tendiert diese zu ihm als ihr Gravitationszentrum. Er ist ihr immanenter Zweck, in welchem sie sich vollendet. Diese Argumentation lässt sich nur unter einer sehr präzisen Bedingung verstehen, nämlich dass der Staat als diejenige Instanz gilt, die ihren Grund nicht der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft verdankt. Im Gegenteil: Die bürgerliche Gesellschaft wird als ein Moment der Realisierung der sittlichen Idee ausgesprochen, die ihren Höhenpunkt im Staat erreicht. Die bürgerliche Gesellschaft wird so als Besonderung des Allgemeinen konzipiert, so Marx, wodurch das Allgemeine zu sich selbst zurückkehrt. Zu Recht lässt sich auch sagen, dass in diesem Verhältnis allein dem Staat wahrhaftes Sein zukommt.10 Mit Descartes gesprochen, kann man sagen, dass der Staat mehr realitatis objectivae hat, so dass er die bürgerliche Gesellschaft in Existenz erhalten kann bzw. dass sie nur als integriert in eine Sphäre mit höherem Bedeutungsgehalt zu bestehen vermag.11 Diese Konstruktion veranlasst Marx zu bemerken, dass Hegel den Staat als das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes mit dem politischen Staat verwechselt. Marx führt also einen Gegensatz zwischen dem Staat als dem Ganzen des Daseins eines Volkes und dem politischen Staat ein. Um diesen Gegensatz zu erläutern - und dies wird ein wiederkehrendes Thema in dieser Arbeit sein - ist darauf hinzuweisen, dass Marx zufolge keine Gleichsetzung zwischen Politik (Staat als das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes, auch Gemeinwesen) und politischem Staat (dem modernen bürgerlichen Staat) möglich ist.12 Die Politik, wie z.B. im antiken Staat, wo der Staat als das Ganze des Daseins des Volkes galt, hat hier den Sinn, die Selbstbestimmung der Gemeinschaft der Freien zum Ausdruck zu bringen, während der moderne Staat die Bedeutung der Staatsform in Bezug auf die in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft praktizierte Wirtschaft hat, die nur erfolgreich funktionieren kann, insofern die politische Verwaltung der Gesellschaft von einer getrennten, der Gesellschaft gegenüberstehende Instanz ausgeübt wird.13 Während Hegel also das Begründungsverhältnis von bürgerlicher Ge-sellschaft und Staat vom Allgemeinen (Staat) ausgehend konzipiert bzw. das Besondere (die bürgerliche Gesellschaft) aus der Allgemeinheit ableitet bzw. als deren Differenzierung fasst, gilt für Marx das umgekehrte Be-gründungsverhältnis. Dies macht die gerade eingeführte Distinktion zwischen Politik und modernem politischem Staat deutlich. Die bürgerliche Gesellschaft gilt als Naturbasis des politischen Staats, oder die Staatsform ist aus den ökonomischen Formen herzuleiten, wie es der späte Marx formulieren wird, und zwar aufgrund der eigentümlichen Logik, die die bürgerliche Gesellschaft strukturiert. Die Besonderheit der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft, die sich kraft ihrer Bestimmung als Privatstand aufgrund der sie beherrschenden Privatinteressen selbst zerstören würde, erfordert eine von ihr getrennte politische Sphäre, eine staatliche Allgemeinheit, die die Gesellschaft aufrechterhalten kann. D.h. die bürgerliche Gesellschaft muss sich ein politisches Dasein geben. Nach Marx’ Auffassung tauchen bei Hegels Staatstheorie Probleme auf, weil sie bei dem Versuch, einen von ihr erkannten wirkliche Widerspruch zu vermitteln bzw. zu versöhnen, in theoretische Widersprüche gerät.14 - Marx ist der Auffassung, dass die Entwicklung der Sphäre der Besonderheit al pari mit dem Verfall des Staats als dem Ganzen des Daseins eines Volks (Hegels unterstellte Allgemeinheit) geht, so dass jene nicht als ein Moment dieser Allgemeinheit konzipiert werden kann, weil eben beide sich wechselseitig ausschließen.15 Aus diesem Grund kann der Staat als das Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes nicht in die bürgerliche Gesellschaft hinüber gerettet werden. Die Allgemeinheit, die Hegels Verknüpfungsversuch zugrunde liegt, ist also höchst fragwürdig. Unmittelbar in die Augen springt diese Fragwürdigkeit mit der Aufklärung des Wesens der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft bzw. ihrer Struktur als einem Geldsystem.16 Ist der Staat jedoch nicht mehr das „Ganze des Daseins eines Volkes“, dann kann der moderne politische Staat nicht als eine der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft vorangestellte Allgemeinheit betrachtet, sondern nur als eine von der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft her sich entwickelnde und von ihr getrennte Instanz aufgefasst werden. Mit diesem Gedanken hält Marx an der von Hegel wahrgenommenen Trennung zwischen bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat fest, geht allerdings einen Schritt weiter, indem er sie als einen wirklichen Gegensatz ausspricht, der kraft der eigenen Bestimmungen der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft entsteht bzw. seinen Grund in den Bestimmungen der selbstsüchtigen Interessen in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft hat. Hiermit erklärt Marx Hegels These - nämlich: „Das besondere Interesse soll wahrhaft nicht beiseitegesetzt oder gar unterdrückt werden, sondern mit dem Allgemeinen in Übereinstimmung gesetzt werden“ (Grundlinien, § 261 Anm.) - als unhaltbar.”翻译为中文","output":"马克思对黑格尔国家理论的早期批评集中在两个主要点上，即认为 (i) 民间社会与国家作为两个相对立的实体相对立（它们之间的分离存在着一个实际的对立，马克思坚持黑格尔所描绘的分离），以及 (ii) 黑格尔对于民间社会和国家的基础关系必须被颠倒，因为在黑格尔看来，民间社会被视为国家的一个特殊化，即它是国家中的一个特殊化。黑格尔从道德的统一出发，发展出民间社会的特殊性，并从这一点返回到国家的普遍性。这两点贯穿马克思的政治哲学，并以互补的方式相结合。因为，认为民间社会和国家处于一个实际对立的立场，需要解释“为什么”它们之间存在着对立关系。为了公正地处理这两个问题，同时也需要揭示现代国家的自然根源。还需要推导出在这种关系中什么是确定的，什么是决定性的。而黑格尔则从道德国家的立场（他将国家视为一个民族全部生存的整体）来解释对立，并将民间社会表述为国家的特殊化或分化，马克思则反其道而行之，从揭示民间社会的结构出发。这就构成了黑格尔与马克思方法论上的主要内容对立，也只有在相反的方法论构想下才能一致地思考。 马克思的反对意见可以这样表述：黑格尔在他的《法哲学原理》中一方面将民间社会和国家作为分离的领域发展出来，将它们视为一种对立，但另一方面他试图在政治国家中恢复两者之间的身份，这正是破坏了将民间社会和国家理解为一种对立关系的理解。需要审视的问题是，这种双重运动在方法上和内容上如何被理解。 由于现代社会中主体性原则（§ 124）的主导，即追求私人利益，黑格尔在《法哲学原理》中认识到需要一个领域，个体可以作为一个拥有自己的权利和目的的个体实现（§ 184）。这就是民间社会。因此，普遍性和特殊性不再像在古代波利斯的直接道德性中那样直接合一（§ 185），它们从此成为异质的生活形式（民间和政治生活）。马克思说：“通过将民间社会称为私人阶层，他（黑格尔）将民间社会的阶层差别解释为政治差别，将民间生活和政治生活视为异质的，甚至是对立的”（MEGA21/2, 页 85; MEW 1, 页 280）。 身份认同要求的一个动机是认识到，因为其自身的矛盾性，民间社会无法自行发展出一种积极的身份，没有这样的身份就会自我毁灭。为了实现这种身份，需要一种外在的调解。只有作为道德理念现实的国家，才能将民间社会提升到其真理，因为国家具有这种综合力量，倾向于将它作为其重力中心。它是其中固有的目的，在这个目的中它得以完成。这种论证只能在一个非常准确的条件下理解，即国家被视为不欠民间社会的存在的实体。相反：民间社会被表述为实现道德理念的一个环节，这一理念在国家中达到高潮。因此，民间社会被视为普遍性的一个特殊化，如马克思所说，通过这种方式普遍性返回到自身。可以恰当地说，在这种关系中，只有国家才具有真正的存在性。用笛卡尔的话说，可以说国家拥有更多的客观现实性，因此它能够保持民间社会的存在，或者说，民间社会只能作为一种融入更高意义内容领域的存在而存在。 这种结构促使马克思指出，黑格尔将国家作为一个民族全部生存的整体与政治国家混淆。马克思因此引入了一个对立，即国家作为一个民族全部生存的整体和政治国家之间的对立。为了说明这个对立 - 这将是这项工作中的一个反复出现的主题 - 需要指出，按照马克思的说法，政治（国家作为一个民族全部生存的整体，也是公共事务）与政治国家（现代民间国家）之间不可能等同。在古代国家，政治的意义在于表达自由公民社区的自我决定，而现代国家则意味着就民间社会实施的经济活动而言的国家形式，只有当政治管理社会的活动由一个与社会分开、与社会对立的实体执行时，才能成功。 因此，虽然黑格尔从普遍性（国家）出发构想了民间社会和国家的基础关系，从普遍性导出了特殊性（民间社会）或将其作为差异化，对于马克思来说，基础关系是相反的。这正是刚刚介绍的政治与现代政治国家之间区别的明显体现。民间社会被视为政治国家的自然基础，或者国家形式可以从经济形式中推导出来，正如晚年的马克思所阐述，这是因为民间社会的独特逻辑结构。正因为民间社会的特殊性，作为私人阶层基于其主导的私利将自我毁灭，需要一个与之分开的政治领域，一个国家的普遍性，能够维持社会。即，民间社会必须为自己构建一个政治存在。 在马克思看来，黑格尔的国家理论出现问题，是因为在试图调解或和解一个被认识到的实际矛盾时，陷入了理论矛盾。特殊性领域的发展与国家作为一个民族全部生存的整体（黑格尔假设的普遍性）的衰落并行，以至于前者不能被构想为后者的一个环节，因为两者相互排斥。因此，国家作为一个民族全部生存的整体不能被保留到民间社会中。黑格尔试图建立联系的普遍性因此是高度可疑的。一旦揭示了民间社会的本质或其结构作为一个货币体系，这种可疑性就显而易见。如果国家不再是“一个民族全部生存的整体”，那么现代政治国家就不能被视为一个先于民间社会的普遍性，而只能被理解为一个从民间社会中发展出来并与之分开的实体。马克思坚持黑格尔所察觉到的民间社会与国家之间的分离，但他更进一步，将其表述为一个实际对立，这个对立根据民间社会自身的特定规定产生，或者说，其根源在于民间社会中自私利益的规定。由此，马克思解释了黑格尔的论断 - 即：“特殊利益应当真正不被搁置或压制，而应当与普遍性协调一致”（《法哲学原理》，§ 261 注）- 是站不住脚的。"},{"instruction":"请将“Grundlegend für Marx’ Kritik ist die These, dass ein wirklicher Gegensatz nicht theoretisch vermittelt werden kann. Es gibt also keinen allmählichen Übergang vom Besonderen zum Allgemeinen, durch den man die Trennung von bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat überbrücken könnte. Dass Hegel diese Trennung als überbrückbar ausgesprochen hat, kann aus Marx’ Sicht nur das Verkennen des Grundes dieses erkannten Gegensatzes sein, oder die fehlende Erkenntnis der Struktur der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft, die diesen Grund ausmacht. Marx’ politisches Denken, das sich von Hegels Staatstheorie entfernt, ihr sogar diametral entgegensetzt ist, wird sich auf die Durchführung dieses Programms konzentrieren, das sich an zwei grundlegenden Fragen orientiert, nämlich (i) die Erklärung der objektiven Bedingungen des Daseins der Individuen in dieser Gesellschaft (d.i. ihres Daseins als Eigentümer), und (ii) wie sich die Individuen im Zuge der objektiven Bedingungen ihres Daseins (als Eigentümer von Dingen unterschiedlicher ökonomischer Qualität) in der Moderne vergesellschaften. Um diesem Problem auf die Spur zu kommen, werden im ersten Teil der Arbeit fünf Schritte skizziert, die die Konturen der Marxschen frühen Kritik an Hegels Vermittlungsansatz des wirklichen Gegensatzes zwischen bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat umreißen sollen. In einem ersten Schritt wird der Versuch unternommen, den Charakter des Gegensatzes zwischen Bourgeois und Citoyen als einen wirklichen Gegensatz zu konturieren, aufgrund dessen Marx auch das Fundierungsverhältnis zwischen bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat umkehrt; zweitens wird auf Hegels Formulierung des Gegensatzes und auf seinen Versuch ihn zu vermitteln eingegangen; drittens soll der logische Hintergrund dieses Vermittlungsversuchs beleuchtet werden; viertens werden auf einem logischen Niveau die inhaltlichen Konsequenzen des dritten Schrittes untersucht, womit fünftens Marx’ erster Versuch, den Gegensatz durch sein früheres Demokratieideal aufzuheben, berücksichtigt wird. Der erste Teil der Arbeit versucht die Marxsche Formulierung des Gegensatzes von bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und politischen Staat durch seine Auseinander-setzung mit Hegel zu entwickeln, so wie die ersten Aufhebungsversuche dieses Gegensatzes zu thematisieren. Zu diesem Programm gehören die Schriften von 1843 (Zur Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts) bis 1845 (Die Deutsche Ideologie). 1.1 Der Gegensatz zwischen Bourgeois und Citoyen als „wirklicher“ Gegensatz Das Verhältniß der Industrie, überhaupt der Welt des Reichthums zu der politischen Welt ist ein Hauptproblem der modernen Zeit (MEGA2 1/2, S. 174; MEW 1, S. 382). Marx’ These in Zur Kritik des Hegelschen Staatsrechts ist, dass in der mo-dernen Welt ein unauflösbarer Gegensatz zwischen dem besonderen Interesse und dem Allgemeininteresse besteht, und zwar weil aus dem die Besonderheit durchziehenden wesentlichen Widerspruch (was dieser Widerspruch konkret bedeutet, wird in diesem Rahmen nicht näher erörtert) die Notwendigkeit der Existenz einer getrennten und der Besonderheit gegenüberstehenden Instanz entsteht, der Sphäre der Allgemeinheit, die der Widersprüchlichkeit der Besonderheit eine Verlaufsform verschafft. Um dies leisten zu können, muss sich die Allgemeinheit, die über die Allgemeinheit der selbstsüchtigen Interessen hinausgeht, von dieser trennen und einen von den Privatinteressen getrennten Inhalt geltend machen. Die Allgemeinheit des politischen Staates macht so ein den Individuen gegenüberstehendes Interesse gelten, das im Gegensatz zu den Privatinteressen steht.17 Aus Marx’ Sicht ist dies kein theoretischer Gegensatz, sondern ein Gegensatz, der in der Wirklichkeit der Moderne grundlegenden Bestand hat. Entscheidend für das Ganze der Marxschen Theorie ist, dass man solche Gegensätze, die in der Wirklichkeit verankert sind bzw. aus deren Negativität entstehen, nicht vermitteln oder versöhnen kann, sondern nur lösen kann, indem man sie praktisch unmöglich macht, wie Marx es beispielhaft im Fall des Gegensatzes zwischen Juden und Christen erläutert. „Die starrste Form des Gegensatzes zwischen dem Juden und Christen ist der religiöse Gegensatz. Wie löst man einen Gegensatz? Dadurch, daß man ihn unmöglich macht. Wie macht man einen religiösen Gegensatz unmöglich? Dadurch daß man die Religion aufhebt“ (MEGA2 1/2, S. 143; MEW 1, S. 348). Solange sie nicht unmöglich gemacht worden sind, können sich wirkliche Widersprüche nur eine Verlaufsform schaffen.18 Wirkliche Widersprüche lassen sich also nur durch die Praxis und nicht durch die Spekulation aufheben.19 Dieses Verständnis des Auflösens realer Widersprüche durch ihre Unmöglichmachung gilt auch für den Marx der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie bzw. des politischen Staates. Das Thema hier ist kein religiöser Gegensatz, sondern ein gesell-schaftlicher Gegensatz.20 Wichtig ist jedoch zu bemerken, dass Marx’ Sicht eine Parallele zwischen Religion und Politik andeutet, so dass er die Lösung des religiösen Gegensatzes auf die Lösung eines gesellschaftlichen Gegensatzes zurückführt. In Bezug auf Feuerbachs Religionskritik bemerkt Marx: „Die Religion gilt uns nicht mehr als der Grund, sondern nur noch als Phänomen der weltlichen Beschränktheit“ (MEGA2 1/2, S. 146; MEW 1, S. 352). Und Marx fährt fort: „Wir erklären daher die religiöse Befangenheit der freien Staatsbürger aus ihrer weltlichen Befangenheit. [...] Wir behaupten, daß sie ihre religiöse Beschränktheit aufheben, sobald sie ihre weltliche Schranke aufheben“ (ebd.). Eine Stelle weiter spricht Marx die weltlichen Gegensätze als Ursache der religiösen Konflikte aus: Der Konflikt, in welchem sich der Mensch als Bekenner einer besondern Religion mit seinem Staatsbürgerthum, mit den andern Menschen als Gliedern des Gemeinwesens befindet, reducirt sich auf die weltliche Spaltung zwischen dem politischen Staat und der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft (MEGA2 1/2, S. 149; MEW 1, S. 355).21 Im Grunde genommen liegt die Wurzel dieses Konfliktes in der „Trennung und Entfernung des Menschen vom Menschen“ (MEGA2 1/2, S. 154; MEW 1, S. 360), der Menschen von ihrem Gattungswesen bzw. vom politischen Gemeinwesen - dem Staat als dem Ganzen des Daseins eines Volkes. Für die Lösung des Gegensatzes von Allgemeinheit und Besonderheit scheint deshalb die relevante Frage zu sein, wie ein wirklicher gesellschaftlicher Gegensatz unmöglich zu machen ist.22 In Bezug auf den Gegensatz von bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat ist die zu beantwortende Frage, wie es überhaupt zu dem Zustand gekommen ist, in dem die Individuen ihre gesellschaftlichen Kräfte in einer von ihrem wirklichen Leben getrennten Instanz darstellen müssen bzw. „Wie kam es, daß die Menschen sich diese Illusionen „in den Kopf setzen““? (MEW 3, 217). 23 Dazu ist es wichtig, an folgendem Gedanken festzuhalten: Marx spricht die Spaltung zwischen dem politischen Staat und der bürgerlichen Gesell- schäft als Quelle einer Reihe von Konflikten aus. An dieser Stelle muss man dann die Frage stellen, was diese Spaltung ausmacht, i.e. was überhaupt zur Trennung zwischen bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat geführt hat? Anders gesagt: Die Widersprüchlichkeit und Zerrissenheit des modernen Menschen scheint nur dann überwindbar zu sein, wenn man die Ursachen seiner Zerrissenheit geklärt und praktisch aufgehoben hat. - Dieser Punkt ist im Auge zu behalten, wenn man die späteren Analysen von Marx zur Trennung zwischen bürgerlicher Gesellschaft und Staat unter die Lupe nimmt. 1844 gelangt Marx bei der Erklärung dieses Gegensatzes zu einem wichtigen Fortschritt, wenn er in den Pariser Manuskripten diesen Gegensatz auf die entfremdete Arbeit zurückführt. Denn, so Marx: „Eine unmittelbare Konsequenz davon, daß der Mensch dem Produkt seiner Arbeit, seiner Lebenstätigkeit, seinem Gattungswesen entfremdet ist, ist die Entfremdung des Menschen von dem Menschen“ (MEW EB I, S. 517 - 518). Und er fügt hinzu: „Wenn der Mensch sich selbst gegenübersteht, so steht ihm der andre Mensch gegenüber“ (ebd.). Eine genauere Deutung dieser These (die Verselbständigung und Versachlichung der gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse) wird sich noch aus der späteren Entwicklung seiner Theorie herauszustellen haben. Festhalten kann man an dieser Stelle, dass die Entfremdung des Menschen von sich selbst und vom anderen mit der Art der Arbeit zu tun hat, nämlich mit der Bestimmung der Arbeit als Privatarbeit. Es muss allerdings noch erklärt werden, wie und warum sich aus der Bestimmung der Arbeit als Privatarbeit die Gegenüberstellung der Menschen herleiten lässt.”翻译为中文","output":"马克思批评的基础是这样一个论断：一个真实的对立无法通过理论进行调解。因此，从特殊到普遍之间不存在渐进的过渡，通过这种过渡可以跨越民间社会与国家之间的分离。在马克思看来，黑格尔宣称这种分离是可以跨越的，只能是对这一已识别对立的根源缺乏认知，或是对构成这一根源的民间社会结构没有充分了解。马克思的政治思想背离了黑格尔的国家理论，甚至与之相反，将集中于执行这一项目，该项目围绕两个基本问题：（i）解释这一社会中个人存在的客观条件（即作为所有者的存在），以及（ii）在这些客观条件下（作为拥有不同经济价值事物的所有者），个人在现代社会是如何社会化的。 为了探索这个问题，文章的第一部分将概述五个步骤，这些步骤旨在勾勒出马克思对黑格尔调解民间社会与国家之间真实对立的方法的早期批判。第一步尝试描绘资产阶级与公民之间作为一个真实对立的性质，基于这一性质，马克思也颠倒了民间社会与国家之间的基础关系；第二步涉及黑格尔对对立的表述和他试图对其进行调解的尝试；第三步将阐明这种调解尝试的逻辑背景；第四步在逻辑层面上审视第三步的内容后果，通过这一过程，第五步将考虑马克思试图通过他早期的民主理想来取消这一对立。文章的第一部分试图通过与黑格尔的对话来发展马克思对民间社会与政治国家对立的表述，同时讨论取消这种对立的早期尝试。这个项目包括从1843年（关于黑格尔国家法批判）到1845年（《德意志意识形态》）的文献。 1.1 资产阶级与公民之间的“真实”对立 “工业，总之，财富世界与政治世界之间的关系是现代时代的主要问题”（MEGA2 1/2, 页 174; MEW 1, 页 382）。 马克思在《关于黑格尔国家法的批判》中的论断是，在现代世界中，特殊利益与普遍利益之间存在着不可调和的对立，这是因为特殊性贯穿的基本矛盾（这个矛盾具体意味着什么，在此框架内不会详细讨论）产生了存在一个与特殊性相对立的独立实体的必要性，即普遍性领域，它给特殊性的矛盾性提供了一种发展形式。为了能够做到这一点，超越自私利益的普遍性必须与之分开，并提出与私人利益不同的内容。政治国家的普遍性因此构成了与个人相对立的利益，这与私人利益形成对立。从马克思的视角来看，这不是理论上的对立，而是现代性中具有根本性的现实性对立。 对于马克思整个理论体系而言，决定性的是，那些植根于现实的、由其否定性产生的对立不能通过理论调解或和解，而只能通过使它们在实践中成为不可能来解决，正如马克思在解释犹太人与基督徒之间的对立时所示例的。“宗教对立最刚硬的形式是犹太人与基督徒之间的宗教对立。如何解决一个对立？通过使其不可能。如何使一个宗教对立不可能？通过废除宗教”（MEGA2 1/2, 页 143; MEW 1, 页 348）。在它们被使不可能之前，真实的矛盾只能为自己创造一种发展形式。真实的矛盾只能通过实践而非空想来取消。 然而，这里的主题不是宗教对立，而是社会对立。重要的是要注意，马克思的观点暗示了宗教与政治之间的平行，因此他将解决宗教对立的方法用于解决社会对立。关于费尔巴赫的宗教批判，马克思指出：“宗教对我们来说不再是根本，而只是世俗局限性的一种现象。” 并且马克思继续说：“我们因此从他们的世俗局限性解释自由国民的宗教束缚。 [...] 我们断言，一旦他们消除了他们的世俗限制，他们就会消除他们的宗教限制。” 马克思接着将世俗的对立描述为宗教冲突的根源：“一个人作为特定宗教信徒与他的公民身份、与其他人作为社区成员的身份之间的冲突，归结为政治国家与民间社会之间的世俗分裂。” 根本上，这一冲突的根源在于“人与人之间的分离和疏远”，即人们与他们的种族本质或政治社区——作为一个民族全部存在的国家的分离。因此，为了解决普遍性与特殊性之间的对立，相关问题似乎是如何使一个真实的社会对立变为不可能。 关于民间社会与国家的对立，要回答的问题是，人们是如何到达这样一种状态，在这种状态下，个人必须在一个与他们真实生活分离的实体中表现他们的社会力量。“人们是怎样给自己‘头脑中’产生这些幻想的？” 要点是，马克思提出政治国家与民间社会之间的分裂是一系列冲突的源头。接下来，就必须提出这种分裂是什么，即是什么导致了民间社会与国家之间的分离？换言之：只有在澄清了其撕裂原因并在实践中取消之后，现代人的矛盾性和分裂才可能被克服。 1844年，在解释这一对立时，马克思取得了重要进展，当他在《巴黎手稿》中将这一对立归因于异化劳动。因为，如马克思所说：“人与他的劳动产品、他的生命活动、他的种族本质相异化，直接后果就是人与人相异化。” 他补充说：“当一个人与自己对立时，另一个人就会与他对立。” 这一理论（社会关系的独立化和物化）的更详细解释将从他理论的后续发展中显现。可以先确定，人与自身及他人的异化与劳动性质有关，即以私人劳动为定义的劳动。然而，还需要解释，如何以及为什么从劳动作为私人劳动的定义来推导人与人的对立。"},{"instruction":"Напиши туторіал косплею Carmen Sandiego з мультсеріалу від Netflix","output":"Косплей Кармен Сандіего - це чудовий спосіб виразити свою любов до цього захоплюючого персонажу з мультсеріалу від Netflix.
