Expanding the squared term, we get f(x) = cos 2x + frac{3}{4}sin^2 x + frac{1}{4}cos^2 x - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin xcos x. Using the double-angle formulae, we can rewrite f(x) as f(x) = frac{3}{4}cos 2x - frac{sqrt{3}}{4}sin 2x + frac{1}{2}. Now, we can express f(x) as a single cosine function with a phase shift: f(x) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cosleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right) + frac{1}{2}. The maximum value of f(x) is attained when cosleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right) = 1, which occurs when 2x + frac{pi}{6} = 2kpi for some integer k. Solving for x, we get x = kpi - frac{pi}{12}.

This set contains subsets of the n colors. 5. **Number of Subsets:**    Since there are n colors, there are 2^n possible subsets of these colors. 6. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:**    Because k > 2^n, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two points, say P_q and P_r (1 leq q < r leq k), such that the sets of colors associated with these points are the same. 7. **Interpretation:**    This means that the circles corresponding to pairs involving P_q and other points to the right, and P_r and other points to the right, have the same set of colors. 8. **External tangency:**    Consider the circle K_{qr}.

The length of the first train is 141 meters, and the length of the second train is 165 meters. So, the total distance to be covered for them to be clear of each other is: Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Total distance = 141 meters + 165 meters Total distance = 306 meters Now, we need to calculate the relative speed at which they are moving apart. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed. Speed of Train 1 = 80 kmph Speed of Train 2 = 65 kmph Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2 Relative speed = 80 kmph + 65 kmph Relative speed = 145 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds. Relative speed in m/s = 145 kmph * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Relative speed in m/s = 145 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 145000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 40.2777... m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 306 meters / 40.2777 m/s Time = 7.596 seconds (approximately) So, it will take approximately boxed{7.6}  seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"instruction":"Eight people are standing in line at a ticket counter.

There are two ways we can approach this: counting the valid sequences directly or using a combinatorial transformation to count the invalid sequences and then subtracting from the total.  Method I: We define a valid sequence wherein at any point in the queue, the number of buyers with 100 Ft bills (denoted as (s)) is at least as many as the number of buyers with 200 Ft bills (denoted as (k)).  1. **Count valid permutations**:     - Identify the permutations where the sequence doesn't interrupt the cashier. Here we consider the placement of buyers with 200 Ft bills.     - If the first buyer with 200 Ft is at the 5th position, then one valid sequence is (s, s, s, s, k, k, k, k).     - When the first (k) is at the 4th position, any of three positions out of 4 can be filled by the remaining (s)'s. Hence, (3) valid sequences.     - For the (k) at the 3rd position, we need to choose 2 out of the remaining 4 positions for the two remaining (s)'s, with (binom{4}{2} = 6) ways, among which only 5 are valid.     - If at the 2nd position, we can only place (s) at the 3rd position, leading to 5 valid sequences.    Thus, the valid sequences can be summarized as: [ text{Valid sequences} = 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 14 ] 2. **Total permutations**:     - Calculate the total number of permutations of buyers: [ text{Total permutations} = binom{8}{4} = 70 ] 3. **Probability**:     - The probability that the queue does not interrupt is given by the ratio: [ text{Probability} = frac{14}{70} = frac{1}{5} ] So, the probability of choosing a valid sequence is:  [ boxed{frac{1}{5}} ]  Method II: We can count the invalid sequences and then subtract from the total to find the valid ones. 1. **Invalid sequences**:     - An invalid sequence exists if any initial sub-sequence has more (k)'s than (s)'s.     - Modify such subsequences: If the interruption occurs at the ((2m+1))-th position with (m) being the count of (s)'s up to that point, convert the first ((2m+1)) positions transforming (s) to (k) for the (s)'s and (k) to (s) for the (k)'s.     - This results in sequences of (5s 3k) transforming to (3s 5k): [ text{Total invalid permutations} = binom{8}{3} = 56 ] 2. **Valid sequences**:     - Subtract the invalid sequences from the total: [ text{Valid sequences} = 70 - 56 = 14 ] 3. **Probability**:     - The probability remains the ratio of valid sequences to total sequences: [ text{Probability} = frac{14}{70} = frac{1}{5} ] So, the probability of choosing a valid sequence using this method is: [ boxed{frac{1}{5}} ]"},{"instruction":"Suppose the normal vector of plane alpha is overrightarrow{n_1} = (1, 2, 2), and the normal vector of plane beta is overrightarrow{n_2} = (2, 4, k).

Step 2: Interpreting the Given Pairs Let us denote the children who provided answers as follows: - Child A provided (12,18) - Child B provided (15,15) - Child C provided (11,15)  Step 3: Analyzing Parity (Even/Odd) Information 1. The parity (even/odd nature) of the first numbers in the pairs for girls' answers should match the parity of the actual number of boys (m). 2. The parity of the first numbers in the pairs for boys' answers must be opposite to girls as children determine one number incorrectly.  Step 4: Parity Evaluation Given numbers: - 12 is even, suggesting m is even if this was correct for a girl. - 15 and 11 are odd, suggesting m is odd if these were correct for boys. Thus, children B and C must be of the same gender, while child A must be of the opposite gender.  Step 5: Determine Correct/Incorrect Pairs  If B and C are girls, their answers are: - Correct: (15,15) and (11,15) suggest that the true number of boys (m) must be 13 because their incorrect values differ by exactly 4 ((15-11)/2=2). Thus they misreported boys, actual value being 13 once the error is balanced. If child A has an even number (m = 14 boys and due to conflict), A must be a boy due to contradicting pairs.

This step effectively halves the coefficient of x in the argument of the cosine function. 2. **Shifting to the Right by frac{π}{3} Units**: The next transformation involves shifting the graph obtained in step 1 to the right by frac{π}{3} units. This is achieved by subtracting frac{π}{3} from the x variable in the argument of the cosine function, resulting in the function y=cos(x+frac{π}{6}-frac{π}{3}). Simplifying the argument of the cosine function gives: [y=cos(x+frac{π}{6}-frac{π}{3}) = cos(x-frac{π}{6})] **Finding the Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry for the cosine function is found where the argument of the cosine, (x-frac{π}{6}), is equal to kpi, where k is an integer (kin mathbb{Z}).

Now, to find the percentage of the third shift that participates in the pension program, we divide the number of participants by the total number of third shift members and multiply by 100: Percentage of third shift = (P / Total third shift members) * 100 Percentage of third shift = (4 / 40) * 100 Percentage of third shift = 0.1 * 100 Percentage of third shift = 10% Therefore, boxed{10%}  of the third shift participate in the pension program."},{"instruction":"During the May Day holiday in 2023, the cultural and tourism industry showed strong signs of recovery, and the national holiday market was stable and orderly.

Let mathbb{P} be the set of irreducible elements in mathbb{Z}[alpha]. For each p in mathbb{P}, |p| denotes the absolute value of the norm of p, i.e., |p| = |N(p)|. 7. We need to show that sum_{p in mathbb{P}} frac{1}{|p|^2} = infty. 8. Consider the norm function N: mathbb{Z}[alpha] to mathbb{Z}. The norm of an irreducible element p in mathbb{Z}[alpha] is a positive integer. 9. The set of norms of irreducible elements in mathbb{Z}[alpha] is infinite because there are infinitely many irreducible elements in mathbb{Z}[alpha]. 10. For each positive integer n, let P_n be the set of irreducible elements in mathbb{Z}[alpha] whose norm is n. Then sum_{p in mathbb{P}} frac{1}{|p|^2} = sum_{n=1}^{infty} sum_{p in P_n} frac{1}{n^2}. 11. Since there are infinitely many irreducible elements in mathbb{Z}[alpha], for each n, the set P_n is non-empty for infinitely many n. 12. Therefore, sum_{n=1}^{infty} sum_{p in P_n} frac{1}{n^2} diverges because sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{1}{n^2} converges and there are infinitely many terms in the sum.

For f(x) to be monotonically increasing, the coefficient of x^m, which is m^2 - 2m - 2, must be positive.

Therefore, the expression is divisible by (x).  2. Factor of (x+1): Next, we consider:  (x+1)^{2n} - x^{2n} - 2x - 1.  We rewrite the expression as:  (x+1)^{2n} - x(x^{2n-1}) - 2(x+1) + (2 + 1).  Observe that ((x+1)^{2n} - x) can be represented in the following way:  (x+1)^{2n} - x = (x+1)[(x+1)^{2n-1} - x^{2n-1}].  Since both ((x+1)^{2n}) and ((x+1)-1) contain the factor ((x+1)), their difference is divisible by ((x+1)). Consider the modified expression:  (x+1)^{2n} - x^{2n} - 2(x+1) + 1 = (x+1)((x+1)^{2n-1} - x^{2n-1}) - 2(x+1) + 1,  which shows that the overall expression is divisible by ((x+1)).  3. Factor of (2x + 1): Finally, consider the expression again:  (x+1)^{2n} - x^{2n} - 2x - 1.  We rewrite it as:  (x+1)^{2n} - x^{2n} - (2x + 1).  We can group them as:  ((x+1)^{2n} - x^{2n}) - (2x + 1).  Notice ((x+1)^{2n} - x^{2n}) can be written as the difference of squares:  ((x+1)^{2n} - x^{2n}) = ((x+1)^n - x^n)((x+1)^n + x^n).  By Binomial theorem, each binomial term in the expansion of ((x+1)^{2n}) is a multiple of (2x+1), and  ((x+1)^n + x^n) - 1  is also deal with ((2x+1)). Therefore, the expression is divisible by ((2x+1)). # Conclusion: Since the given expression ((x+1)^{2n}-x^{2n}-2x-1) is divisible by each of (x), (x+1), and (2x+1), and since these factors are relatively prime, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the expression is divisible by their product:  x(x+1)(2x+1).  Thus, we have shown that  (x+1)^{2n} - x^{2n} - 2x - 1  is divisible by (x(x+1)(2x+1)). blacksquare"},{"instruction":"(1) Calculate: int_{2}^{2}{sqrt{4{x}^{2}}}dx=____________.

So, the profit for each tire repair is 20 - 5 = 15. In one month, Jim does 300 of these repairs, so the total profit from tire repairs is 300 * 15 = 4500. Now, let's add the profit from the retail shop, which is 2000. So far, the total profit from tire repairs and retail shop is 4500 + 2000 = 6500. Jim's fixed expenses are 4000, so after subtracting the expenses, the profit is 6500 - 4000 = 2500. However, we know that the shop made a total profit of 3000, so the profit from the complex repairs must make up the difference between 2500 and 3000, which is 3000 - 2500 = 500. Jim did 2 complex repairs, and the profit from these repairs is 500. Therefore, the profit from each complex repair is 500 / 2 = 250.

Feifei reached the school at __ minutes past 8 o'clock.  (Note: Fill in the blank with the appropriate time)","output":"1. **Understanding the problem**:    Feifei leaves home at 8:10 AM to walk to school. After 3 minutes, the dog sets off to catch up with her. The dog catches up with Feifei at both 200 meters and 400 meters from home, returns home each time, and finally catches up again at school. We need to determine Feifei's arrival time at school. 2. **Identifying the given data**:    - Feifei starts walking at 8:10 AM.    - The dog begins chasing Feifei exactly 3 minutes later.    - The first catch-up happens at 200 meters from home.    - The second catch-up happens at 400 meters from home.    - Final catch-up happens at the school. 3. **Analyzing the first catch-up**:    In the same time interval, Feifei covers 200 meters while the dog covers 600 meters (from home to 200 meters, back to home, then to 200 meters again).        Therefore, the ratio of their speeds is:     [    frac{V_{text{dog}}}{V_{text{Feifei}}} = frac{600 text{ m}}{200 text{ m}} = 3    ]        Hence, the dog's speed is 3 times Feifei's speed:     [    V_{text{dog}} = 3 times V_{text{Feifei}}    ] 4. **Time calculation**:    Let's denote Feifei's walking speed as ( V_{text{Feifei}} ) and the dog's speed as ( V_{text{dog}} = 3V_{text{Feifei}} ).    Using the key fact that the time taken for their movements is inversely proportional to their speeds, we can express the time ( T ) they move together before the dog returns:    [    frac{T_{text{Feifei}}}{T_{text{dog}}} = frac{V_{text{dog}}}{V_{text{Feifei}}} = 1:3    ]        Thus, the time difference:    [    T_{text{dog}} - T_{text{Feifei}} = 3 text{ minutes}    ]    The time it takes for the dog to catch Feifei (first instance) in terms of Feifei’s time:    [    T_{text{Feifei,200m}} = frac{3 text{ min}}{3-1} = 1.5 text{ minutes}    ]    Since Feifei walked 200 meters in 1.5 minutes, fleshing out 3 minutes from her original start time:    [    T_{text{Feifei,200m}} = 3 text{ minutes} + 1.5text{ minutes}    ] 5. **Analyzing the second catch-up**:    With Feifei arriving 400 meters (2 times 200 meters), the whole process repeats, doubling the times and movements. 6. **Total distance and proportional calculations**:    Feifei covers 800 meters (from home to school):    [    text{Total Time} = 4 times 4.5 text{ minutes} = 18 text{ minutes}    ] 7. **Final time at arrival**:    Accounting for Feifei’s initial start:    [    8:10 text{ AM} + 18 text{ minutes} = 8:28 text{ AM}    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{28 text{ minutes}} ]"},{"instruction":"Consider the sequence ({a_{n}} (n geqslant 0)), where (a_{n} = lfloor n sqrt{2} rfloor).

If there are ( k ) teams left and the second-best team has not been eliminated, the probability that the second-best team plays the best team and gets eliminated is:    [    frac{1}{binom{k}{2}} = frac{2}{k(k-1)}    ]    Therefore, the probability that the second-best team survives the round is:    [    1 - frac{2}{k(k-1)} = frac{k^2 - k - 2}{k(k-1)} = frac{(k+1)(k-2)}{k(k-1)}    ] 3. **Total Survival Probability**:        The probability that the second-best team survives every round from ( k = 2021 ) down to ( k = 3 ) is given by the product:    [    prod_{k=3}^{2021} frac{(k+1)(k-2)}{k(k-1)}    ]    This expression telescopes as follows:    [    frac{4 cdot 1}{3 cdot 2} times frac{5 cdot 2}{4 cdot 3} times cdots times frac{2022 cdot 2019}{2021 cdot 2020}    ] 4. **Simplification**:        When telescoped, intermediate terms cancel out, leaving us with:    [    frac{2022}{3} times frac{2019}{2020}    ]    Hence,    [    frac{2022}{2020} times frac{2019}{3}    ]    Let’s compute ( frac{2022}{2020} = 1 + frac{2}{2020} approx 1.001 ), and so:    [    frac{2022 cdot 2019}{3 cdot 2020} = frac{2022}{2020} times frac{2019}{3}    ]    Approximate calculations reveal:    [    frac{2022 cdot 2019}{3 cdot 2020} = frac{2022 cdot 673}{2020} approx frac{674346}{2020} approx 337.2    ]    Hence, ( p approx frac{337}{1010} ) 5. **Final Computation**:        We need to compute:    [    lfloor 2021 p rfloor = leftlfloor 2021 times frac{337}{1010} rightrfloor    ]    Simplify:    [    lfloor 2021 times frac{337}{1010} rfloor = leftlfloor 674 cdot frac{0.333} rightrfloor = lfloor 674 rfloor = 674    ] 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the required value is:    [    boxed{674}    ]"},{"instruction":"Joe's Bath Shop sells bars of soap in boxes of 5 bars and bottles of soap in boxes of some bottles.

Since the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles, and the smallest number of each type of soap sold is 95, we can set up the following equation: ( 5 times text{number of boxes of bars} = b times text{number of boxes of bottles} ) Given that the smallest number of each type of soap sold is 95, we can substitute this value into the equation: ( 5 times text{number of boxes of bars} = b times text{number of boxes of bottles} = 95 ) Now, we need to find a value for ( b ) that is a factor of 95, because the number of bottles must divide evenly into the total number of bottles sold. The factors of 95 are 1 and 95, 5 and 19. Since we know that the boxes contain more than one bottle, we can eliminate 1 as an option. We also know that the boxes contain fewer than 95 bottles because the smallest number of each type of soap sold is 95, and there must be more than one box sold.

The task is to determine if we can obtain the same numbers from the numbers 19 and 98 using the same number of operations. 1. **Initial Setup and Variables:**     - Suppose (a_k) and (b_k) are the numbers obtained from 19 and 98 respectively, after (k) operations.     - Let (s) represent the total number of operations performed.     - We need to prove whether we can have (a_s = b_s = m). 2. **Assume Equal Result After (s) Operations:**     - Assume (a_s = b_s = m) for some number (m) and at step ((s-1)), (a_{s-1} neq b_{s-1}).      3. **Different Operations at Step ((s-1)):**     - At step ((s-1)), the operations performed on (a_{s-1}) and (b_{s-1}) must be different (one must be squaring and the other must be adding one):         - If one number (say (a_{s-1})) was squared to become (m), we have (m = n^2) where (n) is some integer.         - The other number (b_{s-1}) must have an addition operation performed to it giving (b_{s-1} + 1 = n^2), so (b_{s-1} = n^2 - 1). 4. **Bounding the Number of Operations:**     - The total number of operations (s) cannot exceed the difference between the initial number 19 and (n) (i.e., (s leq n - 18)), because each step increases the number by at least 1.      5. **Sequence Up to Number (n^2 - 1):**     - To reach (n^2 - 1) from 98 by adding 1 each time would require subtracting all intermediate steps:         - From ((n-1)^2) to (n^2 - 1) there are (2n - 2) steps since the numbers in this range are all non-square numbers. 6. **Checking Consistency:**     - Therefore, (b_{s}) started as (98) and through additions did not form a perfect square.     - This gives (b_{s} leq 100).     - Whereas (a_{s} = a_{s-1}^2 geq 19^2), which would give (a_s geq 361). 7. **Contradiction and Final Conclusion:**     - We end with the inconsistency that (b_s leq 100) and (a_s geq 361), showing (m) cannot be equal for both sequences after (s) operations.

There are three scenarios to consider: 1. **Both A and B are selected**: In this case, A and B will take the roles of translator and tour guide (in no particular order), leaving two roles (etiquette and driver) for the remaining three volunteers (C, D, E). The number of ways to select two people from three is binom{3}{2} = 3, and for each selection, there are 2! = 2 ways to assign the two roles. Therefore, the total number of schemes in this scenario is 3 times 2 = 6. 2. **Only one of A and B is selected**: Without loss of generality, let's say A is selected. A can be either a translator or a tour guide, so there are 2 choices for A's role. Then, we need to select 3 people from the remaining four volunteers (B, C, D, E) to fill the other three roles.

The person left out can be any of the five, so there are 5 choices for who to leave out. Once the person to be left out is chosen, there are 2 roles (translator and tour guide) that can be filled by A and B in 2! = 2 ways. The remaining two roles can be filled by the other two selected volunteers in 2! = 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of different selection schemes is 5 times 2 times 2 = 20.

Consider a triangle (ABC) with an incircle (omega). Let the incircle (omega) be tangent to (BC), (CA), and (AB) at points (D), (E), and (F) respectively. Assume (I) is the center of the incircle (omega). 2. **Identification of Points**:    The problem states that a line (m) touches the incircle at a point (M), and lines (IA'), (IB'), and (IC') are perpendicular to (IA), (IB), and (IC) respectively, where (A'), (B'), and (C') are points of intersection with the line (m). 3. **Behavior of Lines under Polar Transformation**:    Under polar transformation with respect to (omega):    - The line (BC) transforms into a point (A_1) where it is tangent to the circle.    - Similarly, (CA) transforms to (B_1), and (AB) to (C_1). 4. **Transformation of Certain Key Lines and Points**:    By definition:    - The line (IA'), which is perpendicular to (IA) at point (I), will transform into a line passing through the point (A_1) parallel to (IA).    - Thus, the intersection of (IA') and (m) transforms into a line passing through the point (M) (where (m) touches (omega)) and parallel to (IA).  5. **Application of Simson Line Theorem**:    Consider the line touching (omega) at (M).

Now, let's calculate the total number of jelly beans taken by the first six people: 6 * 2 * 400 = 6 * 800 = 4800 jelly beans. The last four people each took 400 jelly beans, so the total number of jelly beans they took is: 4 * 400 = 1600 jelly beans. Adding the jelly beans taken by the first six people and the last four people gives us the total number of jelly beans taken from the barrel: 4800 (first six people) + 1600 (last four people) = 6400 jelly beans. Finally, we know that there were 1600 jelly beans remaining in the barrel after everyone took their share.

The problem requires us to prove that the perimeters of (possibly self-intersecting) quadrilaterals ADTX and CDYZ are equal. Let's proceed with the detailed steps: 1. **Identify Circumcircle Properties**:    - From the problem setup, omega is the circumcircle of triangle ACI, and we are given points X, Z, Y, and T on omega as the extensions of BA, BC, AD, and CD, respectively. 2. **Reflection Properties**:    - Note that I is the midpoint of the arcs TCZ and YAX on the circumcircle omega, which implies IT = IZ and IX = IY. It's given that X and T are reflections of Y and Z around the line through I. 3. **Equal Segments and Congruence**:    - Using the properties of the inscribed circle in ABCD, denote the contact points P, Q, R, and S where the circle touches AB, BC, CD, and DA, respectively.    - From the congruence of right triangles IXP and IYS:      [      triangle IXP cong triangle IYS quad text{since} quad IP = IS quad text{and} quad IX = IY      ]      This gives (XP = YS).    - Similarly, from the congruence of right triangles IRT and IQZ:      [      triangle IRT cong triangle IQZ quad text{since} quad IR = IQ quad text{and} quad IT = IZ      ]      This gives (RT = QZ). 4. **Calculate Perimeters**:    - Denote the perimeters by P_{ADTX} and P_{CDYZ}.    - Starting with P_{ADTX}:      [      P_{ADTX} = XA + AD + DT + TX      ]        - For P_{CDYZ}:      [      P_{CDYZ} = YC + CD + DZ + ZY      ] 5. **Simplify Using Reflections and Congruence**:    - Since X and T are reflections of Y and Z, respectively, around I:      [      XT = YZ      ]    - Combine with congruences already established:      [      XA = YS + SA = XP + PA      ]    - Since ABC and AI are symmetric:      [      text{Symmetry and congruence imply that the added segments from reflection give the same measure in both perimeters}      ] 6. **Equal Perimeter Conclusion**:    - Since the detailed breakdown of lengths shows equivalence through reflection and congruence:      [      P_{ADTX} = P_{CDYZ}      ] This completes the proof. Therefore, the perimeters of quadrilaterals ADTX and CDYZ are indeed equal. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"What is the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 300?","output":"Let the two integers be ( x ) and ( 300 - x ).

On the left side of the axis of symmetry, as x increases, y decreases because we are moving from the vertex towards the arm of the parabola. Given that A and B lie on the graph of the given quadratic function, and knowing that -1 < 2, we can deduce that A is to the left of B relative to the axis of symmetry.

The total distance is 240 km, so: ( d_1 + d_2 = 240 ) km  (Equation 2) We can express the distances ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ) in terms of time and speed: ( d_1 = 40 cdot t_1 )  (Equation 3) ( d_2 = 60 cdot t_2 )  (Equation 4) Substituting Equations 3 and 4 into Equation 2, we get: ( 40 cdot t_1 + 60 cdot t_2 = 240 ) Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (Equation 1 and the equation above). We can solve this system to find ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ). First, let's solve Equation 1 for ( t_2 ): ( t_2 = 5 - t_1 )  (Equation 5) Now, substitute Equation 5 into the distance equation: ( 40 cdot t_1 + 60 cdot (5 - t_1) = 240 ) Expanding the equation: ( 40 cdot t_1 + 300 - 60 cdot t_1 = 240 ) Combine like terms: ( -20 cdot t_1 = 240 - 300 ) ( -20 cdot t_1 = -60 ) Now, divide by -20 to solve for ( t_1 ): ( t_1 = frac{-60}{-20} ) ( t_1 = 3 ) hours So, the first part of the journey lasted boxed{3}  hours."},{"instruction":"Positive integers are colored in black and white. We know that the sum of two numbers of different colors is always black, and that there are infinitely many numbers that are white. Prove that the sum and product of two white numbers are also white numbers.","output":"1. **Assume the least white number is ( w )**:    - Let ( w ) be the smallest white number. Since there are infinitely many white numbers, ( w ) must exist and be a positive integer. 2. **Consider the sum of a white number and a black number**:    - Let ( b ) be any black number. According to the problem, the sum of a white number and a black number is always black. Therefore, ( w + b ) is black for any black number ( b ). 3. **Analyze the sequence of numbers**:    - Consider the sequence ( w, 2w, 3w, ldots ). These are all multiples of ( w ). We need to show that these are the only white numbers.    - Suppose there are ( w ) or more consecutive black numbers. This would mean that for some integer ( k ), the numbers ( k, k+1, ldots, k+w-1 ) are all black. 4. **Contradiction with the assumption of infinite white numbers**:    - If ( w ) or more consecutive numbers are black, then ( w ) cannot be the smallest white number because there would be no room for white numbers in the sequence ( k, k+1, ldots, k+w-1 ).    - Therefore, there must be fewer than ( w ) consecutive black numbers. 5. **Form of white numbers**:    - Since there are fewer than ( w ) consecutive black numbers, the white numbers must be spaced such that they are multiples of ( w ). Otherwise, there would be a contradiction with the assumption that there are infinitely many white numbers. 6. **Sum and product of white numbers**:    - Let ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) be two white numbers. Since all white numbers are multiples of ( w ), we can write ( w_1 = k_1 w ) and ( w_2 = k_2 w ) for some integers ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ).    - The sum of ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) is:      [      w_1 + w_2 = k_1 w + k_2 w = (k_1 + k_2) w      ]      Since ( k_1 + k_2 ) is an integer, ( w_1 + w_2 ) is a multiple of ( w ), and thus a white number.    - The product of ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) is:      [      w_1 cdot w_2 = (k_1 w) cdot (k_2 w) = k_1 k_2 w^2      ]      Since ( k_1 k_2 w^2 ) is a multiple of ( w ), ( w_1 cdot w_2 ) is also a white number.

Let's analyze the problem by creating a graph representation. 2. **Graph Representation**: Represent a cube with side length ( k ) as a graph with ( k^3 ) vertices. Each vertex corresponds to a small cube, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the corresponding small cubes are adjacent. 3. **Degrees of vertices**: In this graph, every vertex (or small cube) has a degree of 2, meaning each vertex is connected to exactly two other vertices. This signifies that each small cube has exactly two neighboring cubes of the same color. We can visualize these connected vertices forming cycles or closed loops. 4. **Cycle or loop analysis**:    - Every closed loop/cycle will contain an even number of cubes because each edge (representing adjacency) must align in such a way that loops back on itself evenly.     - This means that the entire structure formed by these loops must consist of an even number of small cubes at the intersection points. 5. **Parity observation**:    - Since the closed paths require an even number of vertices to form, the overall count of small cubes in the ( k times k times k ) cube must be even.    - If we start analyzing from a small cube and form loops by following the adjacency constraints, the total number of such intersections must be even. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, for ( k times k times k ) cube to meet the condition where each small cube has exactly two same-colored neighbors, the side length ( k ) must be even. Thus, any odd side length ( k ) will not satisfy the given condition. Conversely, any even side length ( k ) will satisfy the requirement.

The average of the 30 consecutive integers is 32.45. To find the total sum of these 30 integers, we multiply the average by the number of terms: Sum of 30 integers = Average × Number of terms Sum of 30 integers = 32.45 × 30 Now, let's calculate the sum: Sum of 30 integers = 973.5 Since the integers are consecutive, they are equally spaced. The sum of the first 10 integers will be less than one-third of the total sum because the first 10 integers are the smallest in the sequence. To find the first integer in the sequence, we can use the formula for the average of an arithmetic sequence, which is the average of the first and last terms: Average = (First term + Last term) / 2 We know the average is 32.45, and we have 30 terms, so the last term (30th term) will be the first term plus 29 (since they are consecutive integers): 32.45 = (First term + (First term + 29)) / 2 64.9 = First term + First term + 29 64.9 = 2 × First term + 29 64.9 - 29 = 2 × First term 35.9 = 2 × First term First term = 35.9 / 2 First term = 17.95 Since we are dealing with integers, the first term cannot be a decimal. The calculation above gives us a midpoint between two integers. The first term should be the integer just below this midpoint, which is 17 (since the average is slightly above the middle of the two integers, the sequence starts at a lower integer). Now, we can calculate the sum of the first 10 integers by adding the first term to the next nine consecutive integers: Sum of first 10 integers = 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 Let's calculate the sum: Sum of first 10 integers = 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 Sum of first 10 integers = 215 Therefore, the sum of the first 10 integers in the sequence is boxed{215} ."},{"instruction":"Cara is sitting at a round table with her eight friends.

First, let's recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d), where a_1 is the first term, a_n is the n-th term, and d is the common difference. 2. Now, let's find the common difference d using the given information: S_{m-1} = -2 and S_m = 0. The sum of an arithmetic sequence increases by the n-th term when progressing from S_{n-1} to S_n. Therefore, a_m = S_m - S_{m-1} = 0 - (-2) = 2. 3. Using the formula a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, we can find the common difference d: a_m = a_1 + (m-1)d = 2. This means d = frac{2-a_1}{m-1}. 4. Next, let's find the relationship between m and a_1. Since S_{m+1} = 3, we know that a_{m+1} = S_{m+1} - S_m = 3 - 0 = 3. Using the formula a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d again, we get a_{m+1} = a_1 + md = 3. Substituting the value of d from step 3, we have a_1 + mleft(frac{2-a_1}{m-1}right) = 3. Solving for a_1, we obtain a_1 = frac{3m-5}{m-1}. 5. Now, let's express S_n in terms of m. Since S_m = 0, we can use the formula S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n). Substituting a_1 = frac{3m-5}{m-1} and a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = 2, we get S_n = frac{n}{2}(frac{3m-5}{m-1} + 2). 6. Our goal is to find the minimum value of nS_n. Let's analyze the expression nS_n = frac{n^2}{2}(frac{3m-5}{m-1} + 2). Since m geq 2, both n and (frac{3m-5}{m-1} + 2) are positive. Therefore, to minimize nS_n, we must minimize n^2. The smallest possible value for n is n = 1. 7. Finally, we substitute n = 1 into the expression frac{n^2}{2}(frac{3m-5}{m-1} + 2), which gives us frac{1}{2}(frac{3m-5}{m-1} + 2). To find the minimum value, we can take m = 2 (since m geq 2).

Essentially, we are creating point ( A' ) such that    [    overrightarrow{EF} = overrightarrow{AA'}    ]        This construction is possible because the vector ( overrightarrow{EF} ) is known, as its length ( a ) is given, and it is parallel to the chord ( CD ). 3. **Determine the angle at ( F )**:        Since ( AX parallel A'F ), we can infer that the angles ( angle A'FB ) and ( angle AXB ) are equal:    [    angle A'FB = angle AXB    ]        This equality is crucial as it confines the position of point ( F ). 4. **Use geometric locus for point ( F )**:        Given the angle ( angle AXB ) and knowing it equals ( angle A'FB ), we understand that point ( F ) lies on the intersection of two geometric loci:    - The chord ( CD ) of the circle.    - The arc of the circle subtended by angle ( angle AXB ) such that the chord ( A'B ) subtends that angle.

This configuration keeps the pair k-incompatible:        - If ( v_{2}(b) > k+1 ), then:          [          v_{2} left( a + frac{b}{2} right) = k < v_{2} left( frac{b}{2} right)          ]        - If ( v_{2}(b) = k+1 ), then:          [          v_{2} left( a + frac{b}{2} right) > k = v_{2} left( frac{b}{2} right)          ]      - This ensures that the k-incompatibility is maintained indefinitely. Thus, in any move starting from a k-incompatible pair, player A can ensure they do not lose by keeping the game in a k-incompatible state. Conversely, if the initial configuration is k-compatible for some odd k, player B can force a win by making the game 0-compatible, where player A cannot make a move. **Conclusion:** Player B has a winning strategy if and only if the initial number of coins in the two piles forms a pair ((a, b)) that is k-compatible for some odd k.

However, we can use the fact that the GCD of A and B must be a divisor of A (since A is the smaller number). The divisors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.

Considering (cos (theta + phi) = cos theta cos phi - sin theta sin phi) and (sin (theta + phi) = sin theta cos phi + cos theta sin phi): [ cos frac{pi}{4} = sin frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] 4. Simplify the combination: [ 1 - cos theta + sin theta = 1 - left( frac{sqrt{2}}{2}cos left(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}sin left(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) right) ] 5. Factor and simplify further: [ = 1 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} left( cos left(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) - sin left(theta + frac{pi}{4}right) right) ] [ 1 - cos (theta) + sin (theta) = 1 - sqrt{2} cos left( theta + frac{pi}{4}right) ] 6.

The length of gamma is less than 2. 2. **Define the Diametrically Opposite Point**: Let B' be the point diametrically opposite to A on the sphere. This means that AB' is a diameter of the sphere, and hence, AB' = 2 (since the diameter of the sphere is twice the radius). 3. **Construct the Plane Q**: Define Q as the plane that passes through the midpoint of BB' and is perpendicular to the line segment BB'. The plane Q bisects the sphere into two hemispheres. 4. **Assume for Contradiction**: Assume that the curve gamma is not contained entirely within one of the hemispheres defined by Q. This implies that gamma must cross Q at some point C. 5. **Reflect the Curve**: Reflect the portion of gamma from C to B across the plane Q to obtain a new curve from C to B'. By the properties of reflection, this new curve segment from C to B' is congruent to the segment from C to B, and hence has the same length. 6. **Analyze the New Curve**: The new curve formed by joining the segment from A to C (part of the original curve gamma) and the reflected segment from C to B' now forms a continuous curve from A to B'. 7. **Calculate the Length**: The length of the curve from A to B' is the sum of the lengths of the segments from A to C and from C to B'. Since these segments are parts of gamma and its reflection, their combined length is equal to the length of gamma, which is less than 2. 8. **Contradiction Arises**: However, the distance from A to B', being a diameter of the sphere, is exactly 2. This contradicts the fact that the length of the curve from A to B' (which is less than 2) should at least equal the straight-line distance between A and B' (which is 2). 9. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our assumption that the curve gamma crosses the plane Q must be false.

Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of the factorial. The number of zeroes at the end of a factorial is determined by the number of 5s, because there are always more 2s than 5s. Let's start by finding the number of trailing zeroes in each of the factorials separately: 1. For 73!: Since 73 is less than 79 and 83, the number of trailing zeroes in 73! will be the limiting factor for the sum 73! + 79! + 83!. This is because any additional factors of 5 (and 2) in 79! and 83! will be multiplied by a number that includes 73! as a factor, so the number of trailing zeroes in 73! will determine the minimum number of trailing zeroes in the sum. To find the number of trailing zeroes in 73!, we count the number of multiples of 5 up to 73: - There are 73 ÷ 5 = 14 multiples of 5 (like 5, 10, 15, ..., 70). - There are 73 ÷ 25 = 2 multiples of 25 (like 25, 50). So, the number of trailing zeroes in 73! is 14 + 2 = 16. 2. For 79! and 83!: Since 79! and 83! are larger than 73!, they will have at least as many trailing zeroes as 73! plus additional zeroes for the multiples of 5 between 74 and 79 (for 79!) and between 74 and 83 (for 83!). However, since we are looking for the number of trailing zeroes in the sum of these factorials, we only need to consider the smallest number of trailing zeroes, which is determined by 73!. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes at the end of the number n (where n = boxed{73!}  + 79! + 83!) will be the same as the number of trailing zeroes in 73!, which is 16."},{"instruction":"The consecutive angles of a particular trapezoid form an arithmetic sequence.  If the largest angle measures 120^{circ}, what is the measure of the smallest angle?","output":"To solve this problem, we start by denoting the angles of the trapezoid in an arithmetic sequence. Let's denote the smallest angle as a, and the common difference between consecutive angles as d. Therefore, the angles can be represented as a (smallest angle), a + d (second smallest angle), a + 2d (second largest angle), and a + 3d (largest angle). Given that the angles form an arithmetic sequence and knowing the properties of a trapezoid, we understand that the sum of the measures of the smallest and largest angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the second smallest and second largest angles. This is because opposite angles in a trapezoid sum up to 180^circ when the trapezoid is cyclic, which is a common property in geometry. However, in this scenario, we use the property that the sum of the angles in any quadrilateral (including trapezoids) is 360^circ. Therefore, the sum of the smallest and largest angles equals half of this total, which is 180^circ. Given that the largest angle measures 120^circ, we can set up the equation for the sum of the smallest and largest angles as follows: [a + (a + 3d) = 180^circ] Since the largest angle is a + 3d = 120^circ, we don't need to solve for d to find the smallest angle. We simply need to find a. Using the property that the sum of the smallest and largest angles is 180^circ, we have: [a + 120^circ = 180^circ] Solving for a, we subtract 120^circ from both sides: [a = 180^circ - 120^circ] [a = 60^circ] Therefore, the measure of the smallest angle in the trapezoid is boxed{60^circ}."},{"instruction":"Alberto spent 2457 on a new engine for his car.

When x is divided by some other number, the remainder is 4. What is the second divisor?","output":"Let's denote the second divisor as y. When x is divided by y, the remainder is 4. From the first condition, we know that x can be expressed as: x = 61k + 24 where k is some integer. From the second condition, we know that x can also be expressed as: x = ym + 4 where m is some integer. Since both expressions represent the same number x, we can set them equal to each other: 61k + 24 = ym + 4 Now, we need to find a value of y that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can rearrange the equation to isolate y: y = (61k + 24 - 4) / m y = (61k + 20) / m We know that y must be an integer, and it must be greater than the remainder when x is divided by y, which is 4. Also, y must be less than 61, because if it were 61 or greater, the remainder when x is divided by y would be at least 24, which contradicts the second condition. Let's try to find a value of k and m that satisfies the equation and the conditions. Since the remainder when x is divided by y is 4, y must divide evenly into (x - 4). So, we can write: x - 4 = 61k + 20 Now, we need to find a value of k such that (61k + 20) is divisible by some integer y that is greater than 4 and less than 61. Let's try k = 1: 61(1) + 20 = 81 81 is divisible by 9, which is greater than 4 and less than 61. So, y could be 9.

Hence, being coloured in the same colour means being in the same block of a partition.    Let A be the block that contains the integer 1, and let B be the block that contains the first integer not in A. 2. **Union of Remaining Blocks:**    Let ( C ) be the union of all blocks other than ( A ) and ( B ). Also, let ( b ) be the smallest element of ( B ). 3. **Lemma 1:**        For any ( x in C ), ( x-1 in A ) and either ( x+1 in A ) or ( x = n ).    **Proof of Lemma 1:**    To prove a stronger claim: If ( x in C ), then ( x-1, x-2, ldots, x-(b-1) in A ) and ( x+1, x+2, ldots, x+(b-1) in A ) (if they are not greater than ( n )).    - Assume the contrary and consider the least ( x ) for which this claim does not hold.     - Note that ( x-j notin C ) for any ( j < b ), otherwise ( x-j ) would be the least counterexample, contradicting the assumption.          Since ( j in A ) for ( j < b ), we conclude that ( x-j in A ) for all ( j < b ).    - Now, for any ( i < b ):      - Since ( b in B ) and ( x+i-b in A ), this implies ( x+i in A cup B ).      - Since ( x in C ) and ( i in A ), ( x+i in C cup A ).            Thus, ( x+i in A ), meaning ( x+1, ldots, x+(b-1) ) are all in ( A ), which contradicts our assumption. Thus, the stronger claim holds for every ( x ).    Therefore, Lemma 1 is proven. 4. **Lemma 2:**    There do not exist ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( x in B ), ( x+1 in B ), ( y in C ), and ( y+2 in C ).    **Proof of Lemma 2:**    - Assume such ( x ) and ( y ) exist, and let ( x ) be the smallest such integer.      Note that ( x-1 notin B ) and since 1 is in ( A ), ( x-1 in A ).      **Case 1: ( x > y )**      - Consider ( r = x - y = (x + 1) - (y + 1) ):        - Since ( x in B ) and ( y in C ), ( r in B cup C ).        - Since ( x+1 in B ) and ( y+1 in A ), ( r in B cup A ). Thus, ( r in B ).    - Likewise, ( r + 1 = (x + 1) - y = x - (y - 1) ):      - Since ( x+1 in B ) and ( y in C ), ( r + 1 in B cup C ).      - Since ( x in B ) and ( y-1 in A ), ( r + 1 in B cup A ). Thus, ( r + 1 in B ).    **Case 2: ( x < y )**      - Consider ( r = (y + 1) - x = (y + 2) - (x + 1) ):        - Since ( y + 1 in A ) and ( x in B ), ( r in A cup B ).        - Since ( y+2 in C ) and ( x+1 in B ), ( r in C cup B ). Thus, ( r in B ).    This introduces a contradiction, thus proving there do NOT exist such ( x ) and ( y ). Therefore, Lemma 2 is proven. 5. **Key Observation:**    - In the first case: Every ( x in B ) must have ( x-1 notin B ), which implies ( x-1 in A ).      - Consequently, ( |A| geq frac{n}{2} ), since the mapping ( x mapsto x-1 ) from ( B cup C ) to ( A ) is injective.    - In the second case: For every ( y in C ), both ( y+1 in A ) or ( y+1 ) > ( n ) and ( y-1 in A ) or ( y-1 ) = 0.      - Mappings ( y mapsto y-1 ) and ( y mapsto y+1 ) from ( C ) to ( A cup {n+1} ) are injective and disjoint.      Hence, ( |C| leq frac{|A|}{2} ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Summing up, we find that ( n = |A| + |B| + |C| leq frac{3|A| + 2|B|}{2} ).

The game involves two players, Alpha (甲) and Beta (乙), taking turns removing exactly 9 numbers from the set ( S ) starting with Alpha. 2. **Alpha's First Move**:    Alpha can initially remove the following 9 consecutive numbers: ( {47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55} ). This will leave behind the numbers ( S' = { 1, 2, 3, ldots, 46, 56, 57, ldots, 101} ). 3. **Pairing Remaining Numbers**:    We observe that the remaining numbers can be paired as follows:    [    {1, 56}, {2, 57}, {3, 58}, ldots, {46, 101}    ]    Each pair ({i, 55 + i}) for (i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, 46) has a difference of 55. Therefore, the game preserves this structured pairing throughout each round of removing 9 numbers. 4. **Beta's Turn and Alpha's Strategy**:    When Beta removes any 9 numbers during their turn, Alpha can remove the 9 corresponding numbers that complete the pairs from the set {i, 55 + i}. For instance, if Beta removes any subset ( {x_1, x_2, ldots, x_9} ) from ( S' ), Alpha will remove the matched numbers ({ 55 + x_1, 55 + x_2, ldots, 55 + x_9 } ). 5. **Ensuring Pairing at Every Step**:    By following this strategy, after each pair of Alpha and Beta's moves, 18 numbers will be removed in total while preserving the structure of the remaining pairs. 6. **Final Step**:    When 11 rounds of such moves are completed (22 removals of 9):    [    22 times 9 = 198    ]    numbers will be removed from the initial set ( S ), leaving precisely 2 numbers behind. Since the structure of pairs is preserved, the final two remaining numbers will be one of the pairs ({i, 55 + i}) from the initial set. Consequently, their difference is 55, ensuring that Alpha scores 55 points regardless of Beta’s choices. # Conclusion Thus, in any sequence of moves, Alpha can always ensure a score of at least 55 points.

We are given a triangular pyramid with a triangular base and three sloped faces (roof slopes), each painted a different color: red, blue, and green. The problem is to find the probability that a raindrop falling vertically onto the roof hits the green slope.     2. Since the drop is falling vertically, the probability of it hitting a particular slope is proportional to the area of that slope's projection onto the horizontal plane (base of the pyramid). 3. Denote the pyramid's vertex as ( O ) and the triangle's vertices as ( R ), ( G ), and ( B ) (corresponding to red, green, and blue slopes, respectively). 4. Let's denote:    - ( S_r ) as the area of the red slope,    - ( S_b ) as the area of the blue slope,    - ( S_g ) as the area of the green slope.     5. The area of the projection of each slope on the triangular base is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the slope and the horizontal plane:    - The red slope makes an angle ( alpha ) with the horizontal.    - The blue slope makes an angle ( beta ) with the horizontal.    - The green slope makes an angle ( gamma ) with the horizontal. 6. Therefore, the projected area of the green slope onto the triangular base is:    [    S_{O R B} = S_g cos gamma    ]     7.

The housewife is now able to obtain 9 kgs more for Rs. 1800 due to a 30% reduction in price. This means that the reduced price is 70% of the original price (100% - 30% = 70%). So, we can write: R = 0.7 * P Now, let's calculate the amount of oil the housewife could buy before and after the price reduction. Before the price reduction, the amount of oil she could buy for Rs. 1800 is: Amount before = 1800 / P After the price reduction, the amount of oil she can buy for Rs. 1800 is: Amount after = 1800 / R According to the problem, the amount of oil she can buy after the price reduction is 9 kgs more than what she could buy before the reduction.

Determine the smallest positive integer  n  such that it is possible to colour  n  of the bullets red so that  r(i,j)  is a constant for all pairs  (i,j) .","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We are given 8 distinct points on the circumference of a circle, and we need to color some intersection points (bullets) of the chords such that for each pair of points ((i, j)), the number of quads containing (a_i) and (a_j) whose diagonals intersect at a red bullet is constant. 2. **Counting Quads and Bullets:**    - There are (binom{8}{4} = 70) ways to choose 4 points out of 8 to form a quad.    - Each quad has 2 diagonals, and their intersection is a bullet.    - Therefore, there are (70 times 2 = 140) bullets in total. 3. **Double Counting Argument:**    - We need to find the smallest (n) such that each pair ((i, j)) is contained in the same number (z) of quads whose diagonals intersect at a red bullet.    - By double counting, we have:      [      binom{8}{2} cdot z = binom{4}{2} cdot n      ]    - Simplifying, we get:      [      28z = 6n implies 14z = 3n      ]    - This implies (3 mid z), so (z) must be a multiple of 3. 4. **Finding the Minimum (n):**    - The smallest (z) that is a multiple of 3 is (z = 3).    - Substituting (z = 3) into the equation (14z = 3n), we get:      [      14 cdot 3 = 3n implies 42 = 3n implies n = 14      ] 5. **Constructing the Example:**    - We need to construct 14 quads such that each pair of points is contained in exactly 3 quads.    - Consider the following 14 quads:      [      {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 5, 6}, {1, 2, 7, 8}, {3, 4, 5, 6}, {3, 4, 7, 8}, {5, 6, 7, 8}      ]      and the 8 quads formed by:      [      {1, 2} times {3, 4} times {5, 6} times {7, 8}      ]      where the sum of the elements in each quad is even. 6. **Verification:**    - Each pair ((i, j)) appears in exactly 3 of these 14 quads.    - Therefore, the construction satisfies the condition that (r(i, j)) is constant for all pairs ((i, j)).

We need to prove that if (x_m) is a square of a rational number for some positive integer (m), then (x_1) is also a square of a rational number. 2. First, observe that (3) does not divide the numerator of (x_n) for all (n in mathbb{Z}^+). This is because the sequence is defined recursively and the denominator (b) is not divisible by (3). 3.

We have:    [    d mid q implies d mid 3p^3 implies d mid gcd(q, 3p) = 1    ]    Therefore, no such (d) exists, implying that (gcd(q^3, 3p^3 + pq^2) = 1). 6. Since (gcd(q^3, 3p^3 + pq^2) = 1), it follows that (q^3 mid s^2). Also, since (gcd(s^2, r^2) = 1), we get (s^2 mid q^3). 7. Hence, (q^3 = s^2), so there exists (ell in mathbb{Z}^+) such that (q = k^2) and (s = k^3). Note that (gcd(p, k) = gcd(p, q) = 1). 8. Substituting these into the equation gives:    [    p(3p^2 + k^4) = r^2    ]    It is easy to see that (gcd(p, 3p^2 + k^4) = 1), so (p) must be a perfect square. 9.

The perimeter condition hence becomes 2a + b = 31. 1. Since the total perimeter is odd (31), the base b must also be odd (since the sum of the two equal side lengths 2a is even). 2. The value of b must also be less than half of 31 to satisfy the triangle inequality (b < frac{31}{2} = 15.5). Therefore, b must be an odd integer less than or equal to 15. 3. We also need to ensure that the triangle inequality holds: a + a > b or 2a > b and a + b > a or b < 2a. Now, we will check possible values for b: - For b = 1, 2a + 1 = 31 Rightarrow 2a = 30 Rightarrow a = 15 (satisfies 2a > b). - For b = 3, 2a + 3 = 31 Rightarrow 2a = 28 Rightarrow a = 14 (satisfies 2a > b). - For b = 5, 2a + 5 = 31 Rightarrow 2a = 26 Rightarrow a = 13 (satisfies 2a > b). - For b = 7, 2a + 7 = 31 Rightarrow 2a = 24 Rightarrow a = 12 (satisfies 2a > b). - For b = 9, 2a + 9 = 31 Rightarrow 2a = 22 Rightarrow a = 11 (satisfies 2a > b). - For b = 11, 2a + 11 = 31 Rightarrow 2a = 20 Rightarrow a = 10 (satisfies 2a > b). - For b = 13, 2a + 13 = 31 Rightarrow 2a = 18 Rightarrow a = 9 (satisfies 2a > b). - For b = 15, 2a + 15 = 31 Rightarrow 2a = 16 Rightarrow a = 8 (satisfies 2a > b).

Note that any point X in space can be expressed in terms of barycentric coordinates relative to the vertices of a tetrahedron A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}A_{4}.

Let AH be the altitude from vertex A to the side BC. 3. Let BM be the median from vertex B to the midpoint M of side AC. 4. Let CL be the angle bisector from vertex C to side AB. 5. Assume these three lines intersect as follows:     - The altitude AH intersects the median BM at point P.     - The altitude AH intersects the angle bisector CL at point R.     - The median BM intersects the angle bisector CL at point Q. 6. We assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the triangle PQR formed by these intersection points is equilateral. Therefore, each angle in triangle PQR is 60^circ. 7. Consider the angle angle RCH:     - Since AH is an altitude, angle RCH = 90^circ - angle CRH.     - Since angle CRH = 60^circ (from our assumption that PQR is equilateral), we have:     [     angle RCH = 90^circ - 60^circ = 30^circ     ]     - Hence, angle C = 60^circ. 8. Now consider the angle angle PBH:     - Since AH is perpendicular to BC, angle PBH = 90^circ - angle BPH.     - Since angle BPH = 60^circ (from our assumption that PQR is equilateral), we have:     [     angle PBH = 90^circ - 60^circ = 30^circ     ]     - Hence, angle angle BMC = 90^circ. 9. Consequently, since BM is both a median and an altitude of triangle ABC, triangle ABC must be isosceles with BM being the altitude and MC = MB. 10. Since we found that angle C = 60^circ and triangle ABC is isosceles, it must have the other angles equal to 60^circ as well by the properties of isosceles triangles. 11. Thus, if angle A = angle B = angle C = 60^circ, triangle ABC would be equilateral:     - This contradicts our original statement that triangle ABC is scalene. 12.

The problem is a classic example of a binomial experiment where we are measuring the success (getting an odd number) over 7 independent trials (each die roll is independent). 3. We want to calculate the probability of having exactly 5 successes (odd numbers) in these 7 trials. The formula for the probability of exactly k successes in n independent Bernoulli trials each with success probability p is given by:    [    P(X = k) = binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}    ]    Here, n = 7, k = 5, and p = frac{1}{2}. Plugging in these values:    [    P(X = 5) = binom{7}{5} left(frac{1}{2}right)^5 left(frac{1}{2}right)^{7-5} = binom{7}{5}left(frac{1}{2}right)^7    ] 4. Calculating binom{7}{5}, which is equal to binom{7}{2} (from symmetry of binomial coefficient), we get:    [    binom{7}{2} = frac{7 times 6}{2 times 1} = 21    ]    Therefore,     [    P(X = 5) = 21 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^7 = 21 times frac{1}{128} = frac{21}{128}    ]    Hence, the probability that we get an odd number in exactly 5 rolls out of 7 is boxed{frac{21}{128}}."},{"instruction":"CK is the angle bisector of triangle ABC.

This means that the vertex of the parabola, which is at (0, m), must be below the point where g(x) intersects the y-axis, which is at (0, ln 1) = (0, 0). Therefore, the value of m must be less than 0. Additionally, for there to be exactly four intersection points, the quadratic function must not intersect the logarithmic function at its vertex. Thus, the value of f(x) at the x-intercepts of g(x), which are x = 1 and x = -1, must be greater than 0. Substituting x = 1 into f(x) gives f(1) = 2(1)^2 + m = 2 + m. For f(1) > 0, we have m > -2. However, considering the logarithmic function more closely, we realize that for x > 0, g(x) = ln x, and the intersection points occur when 2x^2 + m = ln x. For x = 1, this gives 2 + m = ln 1 = 0, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that m > -2. Therefore, we must consider the behavior of the logarithmic function for x < 0, where g(x) = ln(-x). The critical point for intersection would then be when x = -1, leading to 2(-1)^2 + m = ln(-(-1)) = ln 1 = 0. This does not provide additional constraints beyond m < 0.  Considering the symmetry and the need for the parabola to intersect the logarithmic function at four distinct points, we conclude that the parabola's vertex must be below the x-axis but not intersect the logarithmic function at its vertex. This analysis leads to the conclusion that m must be less than 0 but does not provide a precise upper bound without further detailed analysis of the intersection points. However, the given solution states the range of m as (-infty, -ln 2). This suggests a detailed analysis of the intersection points and the behavior of the logarithmic function has been conducted, leading to the conclusion that for there to be exactly four intersection points, m must be less than -ln 2.

Since ( f(a) = f(b) = f(c) = f(d) = 5 ), we can express the polynomial ( f(x) - 5 ) as having roots ( a, b, c, d ).

The distinct factors of 3 are ( pm 1 ) and ( pm 3 ). However, since there are four integers involved, the product must account for four distinct differences.

INFLUENCE OF TECH VOC DESIGNED CURRICULUM TO THE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL CHOSEN TRACK Jocelyn D. Salingsing Cyrille C. Dela Rosa Michael A. Estrella Bulacan State University, City of Malolos, Bulacan ABSTRACT The main objective of this study is to identify the Laboratory High School students’ interest in taking Technical – Vocational Livelihood Track and to find out the students’ perception of TLE specialization. The study used descriptive research to describe the general /findings of the study in the form of questionnaire made up of combination of Likert scale and checklist to collect information from Laboratory High School students of Bulacan State University. The sample population of this research is composed of 336 grade 9 and 10 students. Most of the respondents are inclined to take Academic track specifically STEM strand in Senior High School. The result implies that in choosing their career, interest is the most influential factor that affected their decision. Students also depended their decision on the course they want to pursue in college by choosing the related SHS track. All things considered, no matter how high the perception of the students in their TLE specialization, the promotional video presented to the students did not affect their decision in choosing the SHS track/strand. The result of the study would be a great help to the administration of LHS to consider using new teaching strategies that will encourage and motivate students to learn more and enhance their skill in particular specialization and improve their facilities and laboratories and offer TVL track in SHS. Keywords: Tech-Voc track, TLE Specialization, Senior High School, Laboratory High School INTRODUCTION Technical Vocational Livelihood is a track that provides opportunities for SHS students’ and strengthens their ability in adopting the readiness for the job required skills through AgriFishery Arts, Home Economics, Information and Communication technology (ICT), and Industrial Arts. Research indicates that different factors affect the course preferences of Senior High School students. Senior High School students chose their strand especially based on their long-term dream and some of them want to develop their skills and abilities in their chosen strand (Gantz, 2016). However, some researches stated that Technical Vocational Education is something that SHS students really don't need. They thought that being enrolled in four-year course is far better than being enrolled in a Technical Vocational Education course. They assume that Technical Vocational Education is only for those who are less fortunate and cannot afford to go to college (Ambag et. Al, 2015). The aim of the current study is to identify the level of student’s interest in Technical Vocational-Livelihood track and develop a promotional video that will ignite the interest of students’ in TVL track. The researchers made use of questionnaire made up of combination of Likert scale and checklist to collect information to Laboratory High School students of Bulacan State University. The Senior High School Program consists of different tracks to prepare our students for college and in the field of work. The TVL Program is composed of Home Economics, Industrial Arts, Agri-Fishery and Information Communication Technology from while the students can select for them to be prepared for their chosen field of work. In TVL course the students can also acquire National Certificates in different levels in accordance to guidelines set by the DepEd and the TESDA. The National Certificates in this level are recognized not only in the Philippines but in different countries as well. The TVL courses teach the students to have different combinations of skills to explore and acquire in 2 years. Immersion as part of the TVL curriculum also allows the students to observe application of skills in different industries which prepares them on how to apply their knowledge and practices in real life situations. (Sun Star, 2017). According to Juan Abarro (2016) in his study Factors Affecting Career Track and Strand Choices of Grade 9 Students in the Division of Antipolo and Rizal, Philippines, sex, average monthly family income, school preference, occupation of the head of the family and average scholastic ratings in the preceding years are factors associated to the career track choices of the students, while highest educational attainment of the head of the family and persons influential in the choice of career track are not associated with the Career Track Choices. The researchers’ study provides a lot of factors affecting the mindset of students in choosing their preferred SHS track. The study of Juan Abarro (2016) supports the present study as both focus on the factors like the academic experience as the most influencing factor in choosing senior academic track other than recommendation of others, friends, peer encouragement and family background. Bulacan State University Laboratory High School is not offering TVL track in their SHS students because, according to the former principal of LHS, Mr. Rafael Dayao, students who graduated from Junior High School in LHS are taking ABM, STEM, and HUMMS track in their Senior High School level and some of them are not interested in TVL Track. This study consists of knowing the leading factors that affect the Laboratory High School (LHS) students of preference in taking Senior High School (SHS) track/strands. In completing the study, the researchers would also like to find out if there is a significant relationship between the students’ perception in TLE specialization and their chosen track/strand. Objective of the Study The purpose of this study is to identify the level of student’s interest in Technical Vocational-Livelihood track. This study consists of knowing the leading factors that affect the Laboratory High School (LHS) students of preference in taking Senior High School (SHS) track/strands. In completing the study, the researchers would also like to find out if there is a significant relationship between the students’ perception in TLE specialization and their chosen track/strand. And through that, the school administrators may come up to make some new strategies and changes so that the students will choose TVL track or align their TLE specialization in their JHS level to SHS tracks. Statement of the Problem The major problem of the study is to identify the Laboratory High School students’ interest in taking Technical – Vocational Livelihood Track. Specifically, it seeks to answer the following: 1. What are the perception of the students in their TLE specialization in terms of: 1.1 Curriculum 1.2 Laboratory 1.3 Faculty 2. What career track/ strands the students would like to pursue in SHS? 3. What are the factors affecting the students’ decisions in choosing SHS track/strand? 4. What intervention program may be proposed to encourage students to take TVL track? 5. Is there a change in the decision of the students in choosing SHS track after the intervention? 6. Is there a significant difference on the result in choosing SHS tracks before and after the intervention? METHODOLOGY Research Design Descriptive studies are aimed at finding out \\"what is,\\" so observational and survey methods are frequently used to collect descriptive data (Borg & Gall, 1989). A survey instrument was utilized to gather data. The survey for identifying the level of students’ interest in taking Technical-Vocational Livelihood track was administered to Grade 9 and 10 students of LHS in Bulacan State University. The researcher chose a descriptive research design specifically survey because it best served to answer the questions and the purposes of the study. A correlational study is also used to determine the relationship and if the variables have a positive or negative correlation, where researchers will gather data to analyze and describe the existing relationship of students’ perception in TLE Specialization and their chosen track/strand. Population and Sample of the Study The population of the study is composed of 336 students of Laboratory High School in Bulacan State University. The researcher decided to include all Grade 9 and 10 students as a sample to make the result of the study more reliable. Instrumentation The researchers made use of a questionnaire in the attempt to find answers to the problems posited. To prepare the questionnaire, the researchers read researches related to the present study and collected some information from the research adviser. The questionnaire is made up of a combination of Likert Scale and checklist that is composed of three (3) parts. Part 1 is to determine the SHS track they like to pursue. Part 2 is to determine the factors affecting them in choosing that track. And the last part is to determine the perception of the students in TLE specialization in terms of curriculum, laboratory and faculty. To promote the TVL track, the researchers will also use a video presentation which was evaluated by BulSU computer teachers using a promotional video rubric. Then after some revisions, it was submitted to the adviser for defense proposal. Hypotheses of the Study The major concern of the study is to assess/identify the level of interest of Laboratory High School students in the designed curriculum of Technical Vocational Livelihood track/strand of Senior High School program. A TLE specialization affects a students’ chosen career track because he/she has the chance to explore the four main courses of this subjects specifically; the Agri-Fishery Arts, Home Economics, Information and Communication Technology and Industrial Arts but there are still other factors being considered. Results and Discussion The students made a self-assessment of their perception in TLE Specialization. Table 1, 2, and 3 shows the level of their perception in their TLE Specialization in terms of curriculum, faculty, and laboratories. Table 1 Curriculum Statements Mean Verbal Interpretation 1. TLE activities are interesting. 3.88 Moderately High Perception 2. I actively participate in our TLE activities. 3.82 Moderately High Perception 3. I am happy exploring TLE subjects. 3.76 Moderately High Perception 4. In doing TLE activities, I can show my creativity. 3.84 Moderately High Perception 5. In doing TLE activities, I gain knowledge and develop new skills. 4.17 Moderately High Perception 6. In doing TLE activities, it boosts my interest 3.83 Moderately High Perception TOTAL 3.88 MODERATELY HIGH PERCEPTION Table 1 shows the level of students’ perception in their TLE Specialization in terms of curriculum based on their self-assessment. Having the highest mean of 4.17 (Moderately High Perception), the students perceived that they gained knowledge and developed new skills in doing TLE activities. Second to the highest having the mean of 3.88, which is also interpreted as Moderately High Perception that for the students, TLE activities are interesting. It is similar to the result of the study of Garcia (2012), the subjects taught are very relevant, challenging, and enjoyable. It is a strong indication that students who are taking TLE have a positive view on the course. In addition, the result of the study signifies that the TLE course is not boring. Based on the student’s assessment, they are happy in exploring their TLE subjects, but it got the lowest mean of 3.76 although being still interpreted as Moderately High Perception. In general, the student’s perception in their TLE Curriculum having a mean of 3.88 and interpreted as a Moderately High Perception. Table 2 Faculty Statements Mean Verbal Interpretation 1. My teacher has mastery of the subject matter. 4.26 Very High Perception 2. My teacher uses new strategies in teaching TLE. 3.87 Moderately High Perception 3. My teacher motivates us in making our own ideas and creation in TLE activities. 4.01 Moderately High Perception 4. My teacher considers strengths and weaknesses of the students. 3.98 Moderately High Perception TOTAL 4.03 Moderately High Perception Table 2 shows the level of students’ perception in their TLE specialization in terms of faculty competency. The study of Ariaso et.Al (2016) indicates that the TLE teachers generally had very satisfactory instructional competence wherein teachers were rated in terms of instructional competence (1-10). It must be noted that none of the teachers received a rating below 4 points. This finding would imply that these teachers were qualified to handle TLE subjects. This result was also presented in the present study where the students have A Very High Perception about the teachers’ mastery of the subject matter with a highest mean of 4.26. The second statement got the lowest mean of 3.87 although it is also interpreted as Moderately High Perception by the students. Teachers sometimes were unable to use new strategies in teaching TLE subject because according to the study of Gregorio (2012), TLE teachers encountered the following problems; lack of trainings related to area of specialization, no capital investment, planning of TLE subjects does not include allowance for contingencies for instructional facilities and teaching strategies and, unrepaired equipment due to absence/lack of budget. According to Schlecty (2018), teachers may use a variety of teaching strategies that would work best for developing students' understanding to learn important concepts. In using different teaching strategies, students tend to be more engaged and show different characteristics such as being attracted to do work, persisting in the work despite challenges and obstacles, and taking visible delight in accomplishing their work. The researcher’s assessment of the student’s perception in their TLE Specialization interpreted as Moderately High Perception with a mean of 4.03 in general.

Instructional Materials (IMs) are well constructed (model and mock-ups) 3.57 Moderately High Perception TOTAL 3.40 Moderately High Perception Table 3 shows the students’ perception in their TLE Laboratories. According to the students’ self-assessment of their perception on tools and equipment, these are available and got the highest mean of 3.72 which is interpreted as Moderately High Perception. But most of them perceive that it is not enough to the number of the students individually and per group. It only got the mean of 3.29 interpreted as Indifferent. According to the study of Albarico et al. (2014), it was revealed that in Mindanao State University, there are available instructional materials (tools and equipment) for all areas in the TLE program and it is used appropriately in the corresponding subjects. It was also revealed that availability of tools and equipment helped to carry out the achievement of the TLE program by engaging students in interactive learning and considering the varied interest, abilities and maturity levels of the student. In schools, health and safety are the top priorities especially in TLE laboratories where students are prone that’s why a first aid kit is one of the most important necessities in every laboratory. The statement in this table that got the lowest mean of 3.23 is the availability of first aid kit, interpreted as Indifferent which means that a first aid kit is not available in all laboratories. This contrasts with the study of Khalid et al. (2018), where it was found that all 11 schools (100%) visited had a first-aid box. Although all the schools in their study had first aid box, it is very disappointing that none of the first aid box was fully equipped. 2. Career Track/Strand that the students would like to pursue.

It is obvious that STEM ranked number 1 in all strands and got the highest frequency of 192. According to the result of the study of Serito et al. (2017), the priority career choice of the students is under the STEM strand, that the respondents will take an engineering course in college and will take an engineering career. On the other hand, Sports track got the lowest rank having a frequency of 2 in pre survey while 0 in the post survey. From the study of Abarro (2016), TVL is the second track that the students want to pursue in SHS having a frequency of 353 out of 721 in total, similar to the present study in which TVL track is also on the second rank having the frequency of 8 out of 336 respondents. It means that the students want to study Academic Track than TVL track. 56.3 22.29 15.25 1.47 1.17 0.88 0.88 0.88 0.59 0.29 0 Percentage of SHS track (Post Survey) STEM ABM HUMSS ICT HE VMA GAS AFA PA IA SPORTS The first pie chart shows the pre- survey percentage of students’ in choosing SHS track/strands. The entire circle encompasses all track/strands in SHS. The sectors represent specific percentage of students who choose the track/strands, (Academic Track; Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) with 57.4 percent; Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM) 19.94 percent; Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMMS) 16.67 percent, General Academic Strand (GAS) 0.89 percent, Technical Vocational Livelihood Track (TVL); Agri-Fishery Arts (AFA) 0.6 percent; Home Economics (HE) 1.49 percent, Industrial Arts (IA) 0.3 percent , Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 1.2 percent, Sports Track 0.6 percent and; Art and Design Track; Visual and Media Arts (VMA) 0.89 percent and Performative Arts (PA) 0.3 percent.

First in rank is Interest that got the highest frequency of 272, based on the confident answers of the students. It is similar to the result of the study of Penedilla and Rosaldo (2017), in choosing a career, suitability to the interest of the students is given importance. Next in rank is Course or college having a frequency of 158, for the students depend their decisions on the course they want to pursue in college. From the summarized findings of Gantz (2016), in his study, the students chose their strand based on their long-term dream, which clearly states that it affects their choice of track/strand because they want to align their chosen tracks/strand based on what’s their interests in life. Least of the factors are teachers with a frequency of 12 and facilities or laboratories having a frequency of 11. In general, the factor most affecting student’s decision in choosing their SHS career track/strand is their own interest. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Most respondents are inclined to take Academic track specifically STEM strand in Senior High School. The result implies that in choosing their career, interest is the influential factor that affects their decision. Thus, students also depend their decision in the course they want to pursue in college in choosing career track in SHS. Based on the students’ assessment, their perception in TLE specialization is rated as “Moderately High Perception”. It is a strong indication that they have a positive view in TLE subject. They enjoy and actively participate doing TLE activities. Students perceived that TLE teachers are qualified and competent to handle TLE subjects. Although student perception in their TLE teachers got the highest mean interpreted as Moderately High Perception, it is evident from the result that the teachers lack new teaching strategies. However, TLE laboratories got the lowest among all the perception of students. It implies that TLE laboratories in Laboratory High School is not conducive to learning that affects student’s performance in achieving broader knowledge and skills. It contrast the hypotheses of the study that TLE specialization affects chosen career track because students have the chance to explore the four main courses. All things considered, no matter how high the perception of the student in their TLE specialization, even with the promotional video presented to the students, their decision in choosing SHS track/strand was not affected. With this result, teacher must also consider using new teaching strategies that will encourage and motivate students to learn more and enhance their skill in particular specialization. Also, TLE laboratories need improvement to provide better services and make it conducive to learning. They should make adequate quantity of the basic needs in every facilities and laboratories like, first aid kit, tools and equipment. The result of the study would be a great help to the administration of LHS if they wish to improve their facilities and laboratories and offer TVL track in SHS.

Imagine I'm explaining this to students or beginners in research writing. I’ll break down each component of the IMRAD format first, starting with: **I. Introduction** The Introduction is where the stage is set for your research. Think of it as the beginning of a story where you introduce the main character: your research topic. Here's what it usually includes: - **Background Information**: Provides a foundation by discussing what is already known about the topic. It's like giving your readers a brief tour of the history and current state of your research area. - **Problem Statement**: This is where you highlight the gap in the existing knowledge or the problem that hasn't been solved yet. It's identifying the challenge that your research aims to address. - **Purpose and Research Question**: Clearly states why you are doing this study and what you hope to find out. It sets the direction for your research. - **Significance**: Explains why your research is important. This is your space to convince readers that what you're doing matters. Remember, the Introduction is all about \\"setting the scene\\" for your research. It should hook the reader's interest and clearly lay out what you plan to study and why it's important. If this makes sense, let me know when you're ready to learn about the \\"M\\" in IMRAD!"},{"instruction":"yes you have a point in following the imrad but we have 17 things to do and youre only focusing on the imrad structure. what i meant is the things that professor instructed me. start with title then i will say next to proceed.","output":"Understood, let’s start from the top with the elements as per your professor's instructions, focusing on each component one by one. **1. Title Page** The Title Page serves as the front face of your research paper, and it's crucial in making a good first impression. Here's how to create an effective title page: - **Title**: It should be concise yet descriptive enough to convey the essence of your research. Think of a title that grabs attention while being informative. - **Authors**: List the names of all individuals who contributed significantly to the research. Include full names, and sometimes academic degrees or titles as required. - **Affiliations**: This refers to the institutions (universities, colleges, research centers) with which the authors are associated. Each author's affiliation is typically noted, showing where the research was conducted or who supported it. - **Corresponding Author**: Among the authors, identify who the primary contact is. This person’s email (and sometimes address and phone number) is included for readers to reach out with questions or comments. - **Running Head**: A shorter version of the title that appears on the top of pages in the manuscript. It's used for ease of identification. - **Submission Date**: The date when the manuscript was submitted to the journal or conference. - **Word Count**: Reflects the length of the paper, including abstract and main text, as some journals have specific requirements for this. Creating a well-structured title page is essential because it sets the stage for the content of your research. It should clearly communicate who is involved in the research, where and when it was conducted, and what the study is about, all at a glance. Whenever you're ready, just say \\"next\\" for the following part!"},{"instruction":"youre telling me? AGAIN! imagine you are teaching. youre only telling me by keypoints.","output":"Apologies for the oversight. Let's approach this as if we were in a classroom setting, really breaking it down: --- **Creating Your Title Page: A Hands-On Guide** Alright, class, today we're going to create the very first page of our research paper, which is the \\"Title Page.\\" You can think of the title page as the cover of a book. It's the first thing anyone sees, so we want to make sure it has all the information someone needs to understand the basics of our project at a glance. Let’s dive in and make an engaging Title Page together! **Step 1: Crafting Your Title** Imagine our research as a big adventure story we're about to tell. The title of our story needs to be catchy but also clear. If our research is about studying the effects of sunlight on plant growth, instead of just saying \\"Plants and Sunlight,\\" we could make it more engaging and precise. How about \\"Bringing Light to Growth: The Influence of Sunlight on Plant Development\\"? This tells our reader exactly what the adventure is about without giving away the whole story. **Step 2: Who Are the Adventurers? (Authors)** Every good story has its heroes. In the case of our research paper, the heroes are the authors – us! We'll list our names here, letting the world know who embarked on this quest. If there's more than one of us, we make sure everyone gets credit. Our teacher, Dr. Green, is helping us, so we include her name too, right after ours. **Step 3: The Adventurers' Home Base (Affiliations)** Now, where did these heroes come from? This is where we list our \\"home base\\" or affiliations. For us, that's our school, \\"Sunnydale Elementary.\\" If Dr. Green is helping us, and she works at \\"Greenwood University,\\" we'll put that down too. This shows where our research team is based. **Step 4: Who Should People Call? (Corresponding Author)** Let's say someone reading our paper has questions or wants to tell us how awesome our research is. Who should they contact? This person is the \\"corresponding author.\\" We decide that's going to be Dr. Green. So, we'll make a note saying, \\"For questions, please contact Dr. Green at <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>.\\" **Step 5: A Sneak Peek (Running Head)** Some big stories are so long, they need a shorter title to go on the top of each page – that's the Running Head. If our full title is \\"Bringing Light to Growth: The Influence of Sunlight on Plant Development,\\" our Running Head could be \\"Sunlight and Plant Growth.\\" **Step 6: When Did Our Adventure Begin? (Submission Date)** This is simply the date we're turning in our paper to the science fair judges or maybe a science journal if we're very ambitious. Let's say today's date is June 15, 2023. That's our submission date! **Step 7: How Long is Our Story? (Word Count)** At the end of our title page, we'll put how many words our entire adventure is, from the start of the Introduction to the end of the Conclusion, not including our Title Page or References. If our paper is 2,500 words, that's what we'll write here. --- And there we have it! A complete Title Page for our research paper adventure. It tells anyone who looks at it exactly what to expect, who's been involved, and how to get in touch with us. This is our first step into the wider world of sharing our discoveries.

It shows what’s inside our paper and where to find it. Imagine you just opened your favorite book. Before diving into the story, you see a page listing all the chapters and their page numbers. That’s the Table of Contents, and our research paper will have one too. Let’s create ours! **Building Our Table of Contents:** **Step 1: List Your Sections** First, we'll list each major part of our research paper just like the chapters in a book. We’ll start with the big ones that are part of the IMRAD structure we talked about – Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. But remember, our paper has a few extra sections like the Abstract, Acknowledgements, and References. **Step 2: Add Page Numbers** Next to each section, we’ll write the page number where it starts. This helps our readers jump straight to the parts they're most interested in. If our Introduction starts on page 2, that’s what we’ll write next to it. **Step 3: Don’t Forget Subsections** Some parts of our paper might have smaller sections within them, kind of like sub-chapters. For example, under \\"Materials and Methods,\\" we might have \\"Study Area,\\" \\"Participants,\\" and \\"Data Collection.\\" If we include these, we’ll list them under the main section with their page numbers too. **Step 4: Check Twice** Before we call our map done, let’s make sure every section is listed and all page numbers are correct. Nothing’s more frustrating than a map that leads you to the wrong place! **Example of a Simple Table of Contents:** (Imagine these have proper alignment in your document) - Abstract .................................................... 2 - Introduction ............................................ 3 - Background to the Problem ............ 4 - Aim of the Study ............................... 5 - Materials and Methods .............................. 6 - Participants ......................................... 7 - Procedure ............................................ 8 - Results ....................................................... 9 - Discussion ............................................. 10 - Interpretation of Findings .................. 11 - Conclusion .............................................. 12 - Acknowledgements .................................. 13 - References ............................................... 14 - Appendices .............................................. 15 **Special Tip:** Make creating the Table of Contents one of your last tasks. This way, you’ll have your page numbers set and won’t have to keep updating if you add or remove parts of your paper. Alright, adventurers, our map is drawn, and our journey through the research paper is getting exciting. We’re ready to embark on the details of our research story.

This is like a trailer for a movie; it gives the audience (in this case, our readers) a sneak peek of what’s coming, all the exciting bits, without giving away the entire plot. **Crafting Your Abstract: A Step-by-Step Guide** **Step 1: Set the Stage** Start by setting the scene. In one or two sentences, introduce the main topic or problem your research addresses. This is where you catch your reader's interest. Think of it like the opening scene of a movie where you get a glimpse of the hero or the challenge they face. **Example**: \\"In recent years, increasing urbanization has posed significant threats to native bird populations, particularly in metropolitan areas.\\" **Step 2: The Quest** Next, explain what you set out to do in your research. This is your quest — the objective of your study. You’re basically answering the question: What did you hope to discover or prove? **Example**: \\"This study aimed to investigate the impact of urban noise pollution on bird song variations and nesting success rates.\\" **Step 3: The Journey** Now, briefly describe how you embarked on this quest. Mention the methods you used for your study but keep it high-level; you don’t need to dive into the nitty-gritty details here. **Example**: \\"Utilizing a series of controlled field experiments and acoustic analysis, we examined...\\" **Step 4: The Treasure** Reveal the treasure you found — your main results. Highlight the key findings of your research. This part excites the reader about your discoveries. **Example**: \\"Our findings suggest a marked adaptation in bird song frequencies in urban environments, correlated with...\\" **Step 5: The Moral of the Story** End your abstract by briefly stating the significance of your findings. What do these results mean for the scientific community and the wider world? This is where you connect your research back to the bigger picture. **Example**: \\"These adaptations may have significant implications for the survival and evolution of bird species in increasingly urbanized landscapes.\\" **Special Tips for a Stellar Abstract:** - **Keep it Concise**: An abstract is typically 150-250 words, depending on the journal or teacher's guidelines. Stick to this limit. - **Make it Standalone**: Someone should be able to read your abstract and get a clear picture of your research without needing to look at the rest of the paper. - **Avoid Jargon**: Use language that is accessible to a broader audience, not just experts in your field. - **No References**: The abstract should be a self-contained summary of your work. Save citations for the main body of your paper. Creating a compelling abstract is like crafting a powerful elixir. It should capture the essence of your adventure in such a way that anyone who reads it feels compelled to dive into the full story of your research paper.

Introduction: Setting the Stage for Your Scientific Exploration** Fantastic work on crafting a succinct and engaging Abstract! Now, we're diving into the Introduction, the section of our research paper where we're setting the stage for our scientific exploration. This is where we draw in our readers, provide them with a map of the territory we're about to traverse, and explain why this journey matters. Let’s unpack how to write an Introduction that captivates and informs. **Creating the Introduction: A Guided Approach** **Step 1: Laying the Groundwork** Begin with the broader context of your study. Why should your readers care about the topic? Think of this as painting the background of your exploration's landscape, ensuring everyone understands the broader world around your specific quest. **Example**: \\"As cities expand, the encroachment on natural habitats presents significant challenges to wildlife, not least to avian populations. Understanding these impacts is crucial for developing conservation strategies.\\" **Step 2: Zooming In** After setting the general scene, start zooming in on the specific issue or gap in knowledge your study addresses. This is akin to highlighting the uncharted territory on our map that we're about to explore. **Example**: \\"While much has been studied about urbanization's effects on wildlife, less is known about its specific impact on avian communication systems and behaviors.\\" **Step 3: Presenting the Quest (Your Research Question)** Now, introduce your research question or hypothesis. This sharpens our focus, pointing directly at the treasure map’s X. What do you seek to uncover or determine with your study? **Example**: \\"This study investigates how increased noise pollution in urban areas affects the song frequency of local bird species.\\" **Step 4: Explaining the Expedition's Importance (Rationale)** Explain why your research is important. Why should we embark on this quest with you? This is where you justify the need for your study, showing how it fills the gap in knowledge or addresses a particular challenge. **Example**: \\"By understanding these adaptations, we can better gauge urbanization's broader ecological impacts and guide urban planning and green space management to mitigate these effects.\\" **Step 5: Sketching the Map (Overview of the Paper)** Conclude your Introduction by briefly outlining what the rest of the paper will cover. This acts as a teaser for the reader, a glimpse of the expedition's highlights. **Example**: \\"This paper will present findings from a comparative study of bird song frequencies in urban versus rural settings, discuss the implications of these findings for avian populations, and propose recommendations for future research and urban conservation efforts.\\" **Ingredients for a Magnetic Introduction:** - **Hook**: Start with a compelling statement or statistic to draw readers in. - **Background**: Provide enough background information to understand the research context and the problem. - **Purpose**: Clearly state the purpose of your research and your main research question or hypothesis. - **Significance**: Explain why this research is important - what's at stake or what new knowledge will be gained. - **Structure**: Give a sneak peek into the structure of your paper to guide your readers on what to expect. Remember, your Introduction is the doorway into the world of your research; it should welcome readers in and make them eager to learn more about your scientific adventure. Whenever you're ready, say \\"next,\\" and we’ll proceed to the heart of our expedition, exploring the \\"Current state of the issue/problem.\\""},{"instruction":"keep it up, are teaching or not? next.","output":"**5. Current State of the Issue/Problem** Alright, moving forward! Having just laid out our introduction, where we set the stage for our exploration, we now venture deeper into the territories of knowledge with the \\"Current State of the Issue/Problem\\" section. This is where we take a closer look at the landscape, identifying what we know so far and what remains a mystery. In simple terms, this part is like conducting a survey of the land before we start our actual journey, gathering all the vital information that will guide our path forward. **Exploring the Known and Unknown: A Detailed Guide** **Step 1: Drawing the Map of Current Knowledge** Here, we begin by summarizing what is already known about the problem we’re addressing. Imagine you’re a cartographer charting out the known lands. This involves reviewing previous studies, theories, and findings related to your research question. **Example for Our Birdsong Study**: \\"Recent studies have highlighted the adaptive strategies of urban bird populations, including changes in nesting patterns and foraging behaviors. However, there is a less clear understanding of how these adaptations extend to communication, particularly birdsong, in noisy urban environments.\\" **Step 2: Marking the Uncharted Territories** After establishing what is known, it's crucial to identify the gaps or limitations in current knowledge. This is like marking the edges of the map where the known world ends, and the unexplored begins. **Example**: \\"Despite these advances, the specific influence of noise pollution on song frequency and its implications for bird populations' health and mating success remains largely uncharted.\\" **Step 3: Linking the Journey Ahead to the Map** Use this opportunity to directly connect these gaps or challenges to the focus of your study. This part demonstrates how your research will explore these uncharted territories, offering a bridge from what is known to what you aim to discover. **Example**: \\"This study seeks to fill this critical gap by systematically analyzing the correlation between urban noise levels and variations in birdsong frequency.\\" **Tactics for a Compelling Survey of the Lands**: - **Comprehensive Review**: Ensure you’re providing a thorough overview of existing research, highlighting significant findings and consensus, as well as discrepancies or debates in the field. - **Critical Analysis**: Don’t just summarize the literature; critically engage with it. Discuss strengths and weaknesses, and opportunities for further investigation. - **Clear Relevance**: Make it clear how this review of current knowledge sets the stage for your own research. Your study shouldn’t exist in isolation; it should stand on the shoulders of what came before. This section is your chance to tell your readers, \\"Here’s what we know, here’s what we don’t, and here’s how my research is going to help us move forward.\\" It sets up the necessity of your work and shows your audience why what you’re doing matters in the grander scheme of things. Feeling ready to navigate further? Just say \\"next,\\" and we'll proceed to understanding the \\"Current and conventional practices in addressing the issue.\\""},{"instruction":"next","output":"**6. Current and Conventional Practices in Addressing the Issue** Now that we've explored the known world and identified the uncharted territories regarding our issue, it's time to look at how current and conventional practices are addressing the problem. In our journey of discovery, this step is akin to gathering the tools and strategies used by previous explorers to navigate similar challenges. **Understanding the Existing Solutions and Approaches** **Step 1: Identifying Current Practices** Begin by outlining the methods, interventions, or solutions that are currently being deployed to tackle the issue at hand. Imagine detailing the techniques and equipment previous adventurers used to navigate the territories we’re about to explore. **Example for Our Birdsong Study**: \\"Urban wildlife conservation efforts have traditionally focused on creating green spaces and 'sound shelters’ to mitigate the effects of noise pollution on bird populations. These measures provide quieter areas where birds can communicate more effectively.\\" **Step 2: Evaluating Effectiveness** After listing the current practices, assess their effectiveness.

Decide What to Include** First, determine what supplementary material is essential for readers who want a deeper dive into your research but would disrupt the flow of your paper if included in the main text. Each item you decide to include in the appendices should add value to your study and help readers understand your work more fully. - **Example**: For our Birdsong Study, you might include the full set of audio analysis data, detailed methodological protocols that were too lengthy for the main methods section, or examples of birdsong recordings used in analysis. **2. Assign Labels and Titles** Each appendix should be clearly labeled (Appendix A, Appendix B, etc.) and include a descriptive title. This helps readers navigate the supplementary materials with ease. - **Example**: \\"Appendix A: Raw Audio Analysis Data for Urban Robin Song Frequencies\\" **3. Reference in the Main Text** When you mention an appendix in the main body of your research paper, refer to it by its label so readers know where to look for the related supplementary information. This cross-referencing ties the appendices to the broader narrative of your research. - **Example**: \\"A comprehensive breakdown of the audio analysis methodology is provided in Appendix B.\\" **4. Adhere to Formatting Guidelines** Follow any specific formatting guidelines provided by your institution or the publication to which you are submitting your research paper. This might include how to structure, label, and reference appendices. **5. Keep it Accessible** Even though appendices are supplementary, ensure the information is presented as clearly and accessibly as the rest of your paper. Use tables, figures, and headings to organize data or information effectively, making it easier for readers to digest. # Common Uses for Appendices - **Raw Data**: Datasets that underpin your analysis but are too voluminous to include in the main body. - **Supplementary Analyses**: Additional analyses that support but are not central to your main findings. - **Research Instruments**: Copies of surveys, questionnaires, or other instruments used to collect data. - **Detailed Methodologies**: Expanded explanations of experimental or analytical procedures. - **Additional Imagery or Maps**: Supporting visual materials that enrich the reader's understanding of your work. # Final Tips - **Be Selective**: Only include materials that genuinely supplement your research. Overloading appendices can overwhelm readers. - **Ensure Clarity**: Just like the rest of your paper, the information in your appendices should be clear and well-organized. Consider adding brief introductions or explanations where necessary. - **Check Permissions**: If you’re including content in an appendix that wasn’t created by you (e.g., images, graphs), ensure you have the right to use it and provide proper attribution. The Appendices section is your opportunity to provide a comprehensive view of your research process and findings, adding depth and transparency to your work. By carefully selecting and organizing supplementary materials, you enhance the reader’s ability to appreciate and evaluate the rigor and significance of your research. --- With that, we've explored the various components that together form a complete and impactful research paper.

First, we break down each unit into milliseconds to understand how they relate to standard time measurements: 1. **1 Miao** = 144 milliseconds 2. **1 Fen** = 100 Miao = 100 * 144 milliseconds 3. **1 Ke** = 15 Fen = 15 * 100 * 144 milliseconds 4. **1 Shichen** = 96 Fen = 96 * 100 * 144 milliseconds Let's calculate the milliseconds for each of these units: - **1 Miao** = 144 milliseconds - **1 Fen** = 100 * 144 = 14,400 milliseconds - **1 Ke** = 15 * 14,400 = 216,000 milliseconds - **1 Shichen** = 96 * 14,400 = 1,382,400 milliseconds Next, we need to find out how many milliseconds are in a day, since noon is halfway through a 24-hour day: - **1 second** = 1,000 milliseconds - **1 minute** = 60 seconds = 60 * 1,000 = 60,000 milliseconds - **1 hour** = 60 minutes = 60 * 60,000 = 3,600,000 milliseconds - **12 hours** (midnight to noon) = 12 * 3,600,000 = 43,200,000 milliseconds Given that, we need to find out how many Ke or Shichen fit into 43,200,000 milliseconds to reach noon. However, we can deduce directly that since the units given are measurements of time smaller than an hour (and we are dealing with traditional time units that may not align perfectly with the modern 24-hour clock system), we approach the problem understanding that 12:00 noon is after half a day has passed from midnight in the standard sense. Therefore, since we're dealing with traditional units and looking for a numeric conversion or a conceptual understanding rather than a direct calculation into these specific units (as they don't neatly convert into hours and minutes without knowing their relation to a day in the context provided or without an existing framework), understanding that noon is 12 hours after midnight is the simple part. If we were to try to express this in terms of these units directly, we would need to express 43,200,000 milliseconds in terms of Shichen, Ke, Fen, and Miao: - Total milliseconds for 12 hours: 43,200,000 milliseconds - Divide by the milliseconds in a Shichen to find how many Shichen fit into 12 hours: [ text{Number of Shichen in 12 hours} = frac{43,200,000}{1,382,400} = 31.25 ] Since a Shichen clearly seems to be defined here as a division of the day, and with the calculation showing a fraction, something in our conceptual understanding vs the traditional use might be amiss, or it indicates we're dealing with an idealized or simplified conversion rather than a practical measure of time as it would fit into a non-standard calendar or clock system. In traditional Chinese timekeeping, a day was divided into 12 double hours, or shichen, each equivalent to 2 modern hours, fitting neatly into the concept of reaching noon in 6 shichen from midnight. However, without applying the traditional timekeeping directly into these calculations due to the unconventional units and their relationship with milliseconds suggested, we aim to reconcile the conceptual passage of time with the precise calculation requested. Therefore, since there may be misunderstanding in how these units convert directly into a 24-hour day or an error in calculation basis offered without given context of how they traditionally divide a day, the principle sought was to frame noon conceptually as the passage from midnight in a modern context based on the simplification of units into milliseconds which directly doesn't address the passage in terms of conventional hours and minutes without aligning the provided units into the broader division of time across a day."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

My primary and most urgent issue, which seems to have been overlooked once again in your response, is the request to cease all mailings to my associated address immediately. This was explicitly stated in my initial complaint and remains unresolved, impacting my view of your service's attentiveness to client requests. To address your concerns and provide clarity on what I've found inattentive, here are the specifics: 1. **Repeated Requests Ignored**: My request to stop all postal mail to the provided address has been made multiple times now, with no acknowledgment or action taken on your part. 2. **Lack of Response to Emails**: Prior to this, there have been instances where my emails regarding service adjustments or queries were either not responded to promptly or were completely ignored. 3. **System Discrepancies**: Your statement that there are no incomplete requests in my account contrasts sharply with my experiences and the unresolved issues mentioned. Given these points, I kindly request that we proceed with resolving the most immediate concern – the stoppage of all mail to my address. I need written confirmation that this request will be acted upon immediately. Once we've successfully navigated this issue, I am more than willing to detail further any other areas that might help improve your service based on my experiences. I understand the importance of communication and am committed to finding a resolution. While I recognize that phone conversations can sometimes expedite this process, I believe we can achieve the same level of clarity and resolution through written correspondence. Thank you for your understanding and prompt attention to these matters. I look forward to your written confirmation regarding the cessation of mail to my address and any insights you might have on how we can address the broader service concerns I've outlined.

The primary reasons for the invasion, the abilities that enabled the Batlantis Empire to overcome Lemuria's advanced technology, and the significance of Princess Ainess Synclavia's disappearance, are intricately tied to the series' lore and thematic structure. **Reasons for Invasion:** 1. **Magical Power vs. Technological Advancement**: The Batlantis Empire, with its strong roots in magic and draconic power, sees Lemuria—a world that significantly advanced technologically due to early acquisition and development of Nazi wonder weapons post-World War II—as either a threat or a resource to be conquered and assimilated. The contrasting foundations of these civilizations (magical vs. technological) provide a classic motive for conflict, with Batlantis likely seeking to expand its dominance and secure resources or strategic advantages. 2. **Search for Princess Ainess Synclavia**: The disappearance of Crown Princess Ainess Synclavia provided an immediate catalyst for the Batlantis Empire's aggressive actions towards Lemuria. Her being found on Lemuria by the Imperial Batlantis Armed Forces scouts, without the ability to pinpoint her exact location, likely necessitated a broader military engagement to secure her retrieval. In narratives of this nature, a royal figure's safety can justify large-scale military actions, especially in a theocratic or deeply hierarchical society as depicted here. **How Batlantis Overcame Lemuria's Technological Superiority:** 1. **Magic Power**: The most direct explanation lies in the inherent strength of the Empire's magic and its users. Magic, especially when tied to otherworldly or draconic sources, often provides capabilities beyond the reach of technology, such as reality manipulation, elemental control, or direct power enhancement, which could neutralize technological advantages. 2. **Dimensional Pathway Monitoring and Surprise Element**: Having the capability to monitor and potentially control dimensional pathways grants Batlantis strategic and tactical advantages, such as surprise attacks, unexpected incursions, or even the ability to bypass Lemuria’s defenses entirely. Their initial invasion could have utilized these pathways to deploy forces in critical locations, disrupting Lemuria's command, control, and early warning systems. 3. **High-Value Targets and Psychological Warfare**: The focused attempt to retrieve Princess Ainess and possibly the use of targeted strikes against key infrastructure or military assets could demoralize Lemurian defense forces or lead to leadership decapitation, severely hampering Lemuria's ability to counter the invasion effectively. 4. **Integration of Fantasy Elements Into Warfare**: The application of magic, mythical beasts (like dragons), and potentially enchanted armaments or soldiers (who might possess magical defenses or abilities that nullify technological weapons) would present challenges Lemuria's military, despite its advanced technology, is not equipped or strategized to counter. **Conclusion**: The invasion of Lemuria by the Batlantis Empire as depicted in *Masou Gakuen HxH* showcases a classic clash between worlds grounded in distinct existential paradigms—magic vs. technology. The disappearance and subsequent search for Princess Ainess Synclavia act as both a narrative catalyst and a pretext for the broader conflict, illustrating how personal, political, and existential threats intertwine, leading to epic confrontations that define the fate of worlds. Despite Lemuria's advanced technology, Batlantis's mastery of magic, strategic advantages provided by interdimensional pathways, and perhaps underestimation of their capabilities by Lemuria, allowed them to overpower Lemurian defenses and assert their dominance."},{"instruction":"What is ultralytics models","output":"Ultralytics is a company that specializes in deep learning and artificial intelligence solutions, particularly focusing on computer vision technologies.

I want to compress a snare for it to hit harder, but after i compress it, there is a spike that hurts the ears. I want to compress the snare but for the initial spike to be pleasant to the hear","output":"To achieve a hard-hitting snare while ensuring the initial spike is pleasant and not harsh on the ears, there are several mixing techniques and considerations you can employ. The goal is to balance the need for punchiness with controlling transient spikes that may cause discomfort. Here are some steps you can take: # 1. Use a Transient Designer Start with a transient designer before applying compression. Adjust the attack to soften the very initial peak slightly. This allows you to control the sharpness of the attack without squashing the dynamics of the snare too much with a compressor. # 2. Parallel Compression Instead of applying heavy compression directly on the snare track, try using parallel compression. Send your snare to a bus and apply heavy compression to this bus, then mix it in with the original snare sound. This technique lets you maintain the natural character of the snare while adding the desired punchiness and body from the compressed signal. # 3. Soft Knee Compression When you are using a compressor, opt for a soft knee setting if available. A soft knee will gradually apply compression as the signal approaches the threshold, which can help in softening the initial attack spike making it less harsh. # 4. Attack Time Setting the correct attack time on your compressor is crucial. If the attack time is too fast, you might be squashing the initial transient too much, making the snare sound dull. A slightly slower attack time can let the initial transient through before the compression clamps down, retaining some of the snare's punch. Experiment with the attack time to find the right balance. # 5. Use EQ Wisely Sometimes the harshness can come from specific frequencies. Use an EQ to notch out frequencies that are harsh or overly prominent post-compression. Often, harshness can reside in the upper midrange area (around 2kHz to 6kHz), but this can vary depending on the recording. Be surgical but cautious with EQ to avoid making the snare sound unnatural. # 6. De-esser or Multiband Compression A de-esser or a multiband compressor targeted at the frequency range where the spike is most pronounced can be incredibly effective. These tools can dynamically reduce the harsh frequencies triggered by the initial snare hit without affecting the rest of the snare's frequency spectrum. # 7. Volume Automation If the problematic spike is consistent and not resolved by the above methods, manually adjusting the volume of the initial transient using automation can be a precise way to control it. This is more time-consuming but allows for ultimate control. # 8. Clipper Sometimes, gently clipping the peak of the snare can tame the transient in a musical way. A clipper can be used subtly before compression to control the peak, which can make the compressor work more smoothly. # Final Thoughts Mixing is about balance and finding the right tool for the job. Sometimes a combination of these techniques yields the best result. Pay attention to how the snare sits in the mix with all instruments playing; soloing the snare can be misleading. Always trust your ears and make adjustments based on what fits the song best."},{"instruction":"22 p Edgar Allan Poe The Fall of the House of Usher Part One It was a dark and soundless day near the end of the year, and clouds were hanging low in the heavens. All day I had been riding on horseback through country with little life or beauty; and in the early evening I came within view of the House of Usher. I do not know how it was — but, with my first sight of the building, a sense of heavy sadness filled my spirit. I looked at the scene before me — at the house itself — at the ground around it — at the cold stone walls of the building — at its empty eye-like windows — and at a few dead trees — I looked at this scene, I say, with a complete sadness of soul which was no healthy, earthly feeling. There was a coldness, a sickening of the heart, in which I could discover nothing to lighten the weight I felt. What was it, I asked myself, what was it that was so fearful, so frightening in my view of the House of Usher? This was a question to which I could find no answer. I stopped my horse beside the building, on the edge of a dark and quiet lake. There, I could see reflected in the water a clear picture of the dead trees, and of the house and its empty eye-like windows. 23 Edgar Allan Poe: Storyteller I was now going to spend several weeks in this house of sadness — this house of gloom. Its owner was named Roderick Usher. We had been friends when we were boys; but many years had passed since our last meeting. A letter from him had reached me, a wild letter which demanded that I reply by coming to see him. He wrote of an illness of the body — of a sickness of the mind — and of a desire to see me — his best and indeed his only friend. It was the manner in which all this was said — it was the heart in it — which did not allow me to say no. Although as boys we had been together, I really knew little about my friend. I knew, however, that his family, a very old one, had long been famous for its understanding of all the arts and for many quiet acts of kindness to the poor. I had learned too that the family had never been a large one, with many branches. The name had passed always from father to son, and when people spoke of the “House of Usher,” they included both the family and the family home. I again looked up from the picture of the house reflected in the lake to the house itself. A strange idea grew in my mind — an idea so strange that I tell it only to show the force of the feelings which laid their weight on me. I really believed that around the whole house, and the ground around it, the air itself was different. It was not the air of heaven. It rose from the dead, decaying trees, from the gray walls, and the quiet lake. It was a sickly, unhealthy air that I could see, slow-moving, heavy, and gray. Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I looked more carefully at the building itself. The most noticeable thing about it seemed to be its great age. None of the walls had fallen, yet the stones appeared to be in a condition of advanced decay. Perhaps the careful eye would have discovered the beginning of a break in the front of the building, a crack making its way from the top down the wall until it became lost in the dark waters of the lake. I rode over a short bridge to the house. A man who worked in the house — a servant — took my horse, and I entered. Another servant, of quiet step, led me without a word through many dark turnings to the room of his master. Much that I met on the way added, I do not know how, to the strangeness of which I have already spoken. While the objects around me — the dark wall coverings, the blackness of the floors, and the things brought home from long forgotten wars — 24 Edgar Allan Poe while these things were like the things I had known since I was a baby — while I admitted that all this was only what I had expected — I was still surprised at the strange ideas which grew in my mind from these simple things. The room I came into was very large and high. The windows were high, and pointed at the top, and so far above the black floor that they were quite out of reach. Only a little light, red in color, made its way through the glass, and served to lighten the nearer and larger objects. My eyes, however, tried and failed to see into the far, high corners of the room. Dark coverings hung upon the walls. The many chairs and tables had been used for a long, long time. Books lay around the room, but could give it no sense of life. I felt sadness hanging over everything. No escape from this deep cold gloom seemed possible. As I entered the room, Usher stood up from where he had been lying and met me with a warmth which at first I could not believe was real. A look, however, at his face told me that every word he spoke was true. We sat down; and for some moments, while he said nothing, I looked at him with a feeling of sad surprise. Surely, no man had ever before changed as Roderick Usher had! Could this be the friend of my early years? It is true that his face had always been unusual. He had gray-white skin; eyes large and full of light; lips not bright in color, but of a beautiful shape; a well-shaped nose; hair of great softness — a face that was not easy to forget. And now the increase in this strangeness of his face had caused so great a change that I almost did not know him. The horrible white of his skin, and the strange light in his eyes, surprised me and even made me afraid. His hair had been allowed to grow, and in its softness it did not fall around his face but seemed to lie upon the air. I could not, even with an effort, see in my friend the appearance of a simple human being. In his manner, I saw at once, changes came and went; and I soon found that this resulted from his attempt to quiet a very great nervousness. I had indeed been prepared for something like this, partly by his letter and partly by remembering him as a boy. His actions were first too quick and then too quiet. Sometimes his voice, slow and trembling with fear, quickly changed to a strong, heavy, carefully spaced, too perfectly controlled manner. It was in this manner that he 25 Edgar Allan Poe: Storyteller spoke of the purpose of my visit, of his desire to see me, and of the deep delight and strength he expected me to give him. He told me what he believed to be the nature of his illness. It was, he said, a family sickness, and one from which he could not hope to grow better — but it was, he added at once, only a nervous illness which would without doubt soon pass away. It showed itself in a number of strange feelings. Some of these, as he told me of them, interested me but were beyond my understanding; perhaps the way in which he told me of them added to their strangeness. He suffered much from a sickly increase in the feeling of all the senses; he could eat only the most tasteless food; all flowers smelled too strongly for his nose; his eyes were hurt by even a little light; and there were few sounds which did not fill him with horror. A certain kind of sick fear was completely his master. “I shall die,” he said. “I shall die! I must die of this fool’s sickness. In this way, this way and no other way, I shall be lost. I fear what will happen in the future, not for what happens, but for the result of what happens. I have, indeed, no fear of pain, but only fear of its result — of terror! I feel that the time will soon arrive when I must lose my life, and my mind, and my soul, together, in some last battle with that horrible enemy: fear!” 26 p Edgar Allan Poe The Fall of the House of Usher Part Two Roderick Usher, whom I had known as a boy, was now ill and had asked me to come to help him. When I arrived I felt something strange and fearful about the great old stone house, about the lake in front of it, and about Usher himself. He appeared not like a human being, but like a spirit that had come back from beyond the grave. It was an illness, he said, from which he would surely die. He called his sickness fear. “I have,” he said, “no fear of pain, but only the fear of its result — of terror. I feel that the time will soon arrive when I must lose my life, and my mind, and my soul, together, in some last battle with that horrible enemy: fear!” I learned also, but slowly, and through broken words with doubtful meaning, another strange fact about the condition of Usher’s mind. He had certain sick fears about the house in which he lived, and he had not stepped out of it for many years. He felt that the house, with its gray walls and the quiet lake around it, had somehow through the long years gotten a strong hold on his spirit. 27 Edgar Allan Poe: Storyteller He said, however, that much of the gloom which lay so heavily on him was probably caused by something more plainly to be seen — by the long-continued illness — indeed, the coming death — of a dearly loved sister — his only company for many years. Except for himself, she was the last member of his family on earth. “When she dies,” he said, with a sadness which I can never forget, “when she dies, I will be the last of the old, old family — the House of Usher.” While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so she was called) passed slowly through a distant part of the room, and without seeing that I was there, went on. I looked at her with a complete and wondering surprise and with some fear — and yet I found I could not explain to myself such feelings. My eyes followed her. When she came to a door and it closed behind her, my eyes turned to the face of her brother — but he had put his face in his hands, and I could see only that the thin fingers through which his tears were flowing were whiter than ever before. The illness of the lady Madeline had long been beyond the help of her doctors. She seemed to care about nothing. Slowly her body had grown thin and weak, and often for a short period she would fall into a sleep like the sleep of the dead. So far she had not been forced to stay in bed; but by the evening of the day I arrived at the house, the power of her destroyer (as her brother told me that night) was too strong for her. I learned that my one sight of her would probably be the last I would have — that the lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more. For several days following, her name was not spoken by either Usher or myself; and during this period I was busy with efforts to lift my friend out of his sadness and gloom. We painted and read together; or listened, as if in a dream, to the wild music he played. And so, as a warmer and more loving friendship grew between us, I saw more clearly the uselessness of all attempts to bring happiness to a mind from which only darkness came, spreading upon all objects in the world its never-ending gloom. I shall always remember the hours I spent with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I would fail in any attempt to give an idea of the true character of the things we did together. There was a strange light over everything. The paintings which he made made me tremble, 28 Edgar Allan Poe though I know not why. To tell of them is beyond the power of written words. If ever a man painted an idea, that man was Roderick Usher. For me at least there came out of his pictures a sense of fear and wonder. One of these pictures may be told, although weakly, in words. It showed the inside of a room where the dead might be placed, with low walls, white and plain. It seemed to be very deep under the earth. There was no door, no window; and no light or fire burned; yet a river of light flowed through it, filling it with a horrible, ghastly brightness. I have spoken of that sickly condition of the senses, which made most music painful for Usher to hear. The notes he could listen to with pleasure were very few. It was this fact, perhaps, that made the music he played so different from most music. But the wild beauty of his playing could not be explained. The words of one of his songs, called “The Haunted Palace,” I have easily remembered. In it I thought I saw, and for the first time, that Usher knew very well that his mind was weakening. This song told of a great house where a king lived — a palace — in a green valley, where all was light and color and beauty, and the air was sweet. In the palace were two bright windows through which people in that happy valley could hear music and could see smiling ghosts — spirits — moving around the king. The palace door was of the richest materials, in red and white; through it came other spirits whose only duty was to sing in their beautiful voices about how wise their king was. But a dark change came, the song continued, and now those who enter the valley see through the windows, in a red light, shapes that move to broken music; while through the door, now colorless, a ghastly river of ghosts, laughing but no longer smiling, rushes out forever. Our talk of this song led to another strange idea in Usher’s mind. He believed that plants could feel and think, and not only plants, but rocks and water as well. He believed that the gray stones of his house, and the small plants growing on the stones, and the decaying trees, had a power over him that made him what he was. Our books — the books which, for years, had fed the sick man’s mind — were, as might be supposed, of this same wild character. Some of these books Usher sat and studied for hours. His chief delight was found in reading one very old book, written for some forgotten church, telling of the Watch over the Dead. 29 Edgar Allan Poe: Storyteller At last, one evening he told me that the lady Madeline was alive no more. He said he was going to keep her body for a time in one of the many vaults inside the walls of the building. The worldly reason he gave for this was one with which I felt I had to agree. He had decided to do this because of the nature of her illness, because of the strange interest and questions of her doctors, and because of the great distance to the graveyard where members of his family were placed in the earth. We two carried her body to its resting place. The vault in which we placed it was small and dark, and in ages past it must have seen strange and bloody scenes. It lay deep below that part of the building where I myself slept. The thick door was of iron, and because of its great weight made a loud, hard sound when it was opened and closed. As we placed the lady Madeline in this room of horror I saw for the first time the great likeness between brother and sister, and Usher told me then that they were twins — they had been born on the same day. For that reason the understanding between them had always been great, and the tie that held them together very strong. We looked down at the dead face one last time, and I was filled with wonder. As she lay there, the lady Madeline looked not dead but asleep — still soft and warm — though to the touch cold as the stones around us. 30 p Edgar Allan Poe The Fall of the House of Usher Part Three I was visiting an old friend of mine, Roderick Usher, in his old stone house, his palace, where a feeling of death hung on the air. I saw how fear was pressing on his heart and mind. Now his only sister, the lady Madeline, had died and we had put her body in its resting place, in a room inside the cold walls of the palace, a damp, dark vault, a fearful place. As we looked down upon her face, I saw that there was a strong likeness between the two. “Indeed,” said Usher, “we were born on the same day, and the tie between us has always been strong.” We did not long look down at her, for fear and wonder filled our hearts. There was still a little color in her face and there seemed to be a smile on her lips. We closed the heavy iron door and returned to the rooms above, which were hardly less gloomy than the vault. And now a change came in the sickness of my friend’s mind. He went from room to room with a hurried step. His face was, if possible, whiter and more ghastly than before, and the light in his eyes had 31 Edgar Allan Poe: Storyteller gone. The trembling in his voice seemed to show the greatest fear. At times he sat looking at nothing for hours, as if listening to some sound I could not hear. I felt his condition, slowly but certainly, gaining power over me; I felt that his wild ideas were becoming fixed in my own mind. As I was going to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after we placed the lady Madeline within the vault, I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep did not come — while the hours passed. My mind fought against the nervousness. I tried to believe that much, if not all, of what I felt was due to the gloomy room, to the dark wall coverings, which in a rising wind moved on the walls. But my efforts were useless. A trembling I could not stop filled my body, and fear without reason caught my heart. I sat up, looking into the darkness of my room, listening — I do not know why — to certain low sounds which came when the storm was quiet. A feeling of horror lay upon me like a heavy weight. I put on my clothes and began walking nervously around the room. I had been walking for a very short time when I heard a light step coming toward my door. I knew it was Usher. In a moment I saw him at my door, as usual very white, but there was a wild laugh in his eyes. Even so, I was glad to have his company. “And have you not seen it?” he said. He hurried to one of the windows and opened it to the storm. The force of the entering wind nearly lifted us from our feet. It was, indeed, a stormy but beautiful night, and wildly strange. The heavy, low-hanging clouds which seemed to press down upon the house, flew from all directions against each other, always returning and never passing away in the distance. With their great thickness they cut off all light from the moon and the stars. But we could see them because they were lighted from below by the air itself, which we could see, rising from the dark lake and from the stones of the house itself. “You must not — you shall not look out at this!” I said to Usher, as I led him from the window to a seat. “This appearance which surprises you so has been seen in other places, too. Perhaps the lake is the cause. Let us close this window; the air is cold. Here is one of the stories you like best. I will read and you shall listen and thus we will live through this fearful night together.” 32 Edgar Allan Poe The old book which I had picked up was one written by a fool for fools to read, and it was not, in truth, one that Usher liked. It was, however, the only one within easy reach. He seemed to listen quietly. Then I came to a part of the story in which a man, a strong man full of wine, begins to break down a door, and the sound of the dry wood as it breaks can be heard through all the forest around him. Here I stopped, for it seemed to me that from some very distant part of the house sounds came to my ears like those of which I had been reading. It must have been this likeness that had made me notice them, for the sounds themselves, with the storm still increasing, were nothing to stop or interest me. I continued the story, and read how the man, now entering through the broken door, discovers a strange and terrible animal of the kind so often found in these old stories. He strikes it and it falls, with such a cry that he has to close his ears with his hands. Here again I stopped. There could be no doubt. This time I did hear a distant sound, very much like the cry of the animal in the story. I tried to control myself so that my friend would see nothing of what I felt. I was not certain that he had heard the sound, although he had clearly changed in some way. He had slowly moved his chair so that I could not see him well. I did see that his lips were moving as if he were speaking to himself. His head had dropped forward, but I knew he was not asleep, for his eyes were open and he was moving his body from side to side. I began reading again, and quickly came to a part of the story where a heavy piece of iron falls on a stone floor with a ringing sound. These words had just passed my lips when I heard clearly, but from far away, a loud ringing sound — as if something of iron had indeed fallen heavily upon a stone floor, or as if an iron door had closed. I lost control of myself completely, and jumped up from my chair. Usher still sat, moving a little from side to side. His eyes were turned to the floor. I rushed to his chair. As I placed my hand on his shoulder, I felt that his whole body was trembling; a sickly smile touched his lips; he spoke in a low, quick, and nervous voice as if he did not know I was there. 33 Edgar Allan Poe: Storyteller “Yes!” he said. “I heard it! Many minutes, many hours, many days have I heard it — but I did not dare to speak! We have put her living in the vault! Did I not say that my senses were too strong? I heard her first movements many days ago — yet I did not dare to speak! And now, that story — but the sounds were hers! Oh, where shall I run?! She is coming — coming to ask why I put her there too soon. I hear her footsteps on the stairs. I hear the heavy beating of her heart.” Here he jumped up and cried as if he were giving up his soul: “i tell you, she now stands at the door!!” The great door to which he was pointing now slowly opened. It was the work of the rushing wind, perhaps — but no — outside that door a shape did stand, the tall figure, in its grave-clothes, of the lady Madeline of Usher. There was blood upon her white dress, and the signs of her terrible efforts to escape were upon every part of her thin form. For a moment she remained trembling at the door; then, with a low cry, she fell heavily in upon her brother; in her pain, as she died at last, she carried him down with her, down to the floor. He too was dead, killed by his own fear. I rushed from the room; I rushed from the house. I ran. The storm was around me in all its strength as I crossed the bridge. Suddenly a wild light moved along the ground at my feet, and I turned to see where it could have come from, for only the great house and its darkness were behind me. The light was that of the full moon, of a bloodred moon, which was now shining through that break in the front wall, that crack which I thought I had seen when I first saw the palace. Then only a little crack, it now widened as I watched. A strong wind came rushing over me — the whole face of the moon appeared. I saw the great walls falling apart. There was a long and stormy shouting sound — and the deep black lake closed darkly over all that remained of the house of usher.","output":"\\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" is a classic example of Edgar Allan Poe's mastery in weaving themes of horror and mystery. This story, contained in several parts, narrates the plight of Roderick Usher, who invites the unnamed narrator, an old friend, to visit him in his ancient and decaying family mansion. Usher suffers from a mysterious malady affecting both his body and mind, a condition he believes is connected to the ominous atmosphere of his home and the gradual deterioration of his sister Madeline's health. Poe employs the gothic setting of the House of Usher as a central figure in the story, reflecting the decay and disturbance within the Usher family. The house, with its cracked façade, gloomy interior, and reflection in the tarn, serves as a mirror to the Usher siblings' deteriorating condition, suggesting a supernatural or psychological connection between the family and their ancestral home. Madeline's death and subsequent entombment in the family vault beneath the house mark a turning point in the story, as Roderick's fear intensifies, and the lines between the supernatural and the psychological blur. The eerie sequence of events that follows—noises echoing those described in a book read by the narrator, the storm intensifying, and ultimately, Madeline's horrifying return from the tomb—culminates in a climax fraught with terror and despair. The story concludes as the House of Usher literally falls into the tarn, symbolizing the end of the Usher family lineage and the inescapable fate that seemed predetermined by their ancestral legacy. Poe masterfully crafts this tale to explore themes of fear, madness, and the supernatural, leaving readers to ponder the extent to which the environment and family heritage can influence one's mental and physical well-being. Poe's narrative technique, characterized by a first-person account, atmospheric detailing, and a building sense of dread, immerses readers in the gloomy world of the Usher family. The intricate connections between the characters, the house, and the ominous landscape serve as a testament to Poe's skill in creating a hauntingly memorable story that continues to captivate and unsettle readers to this day."},{"instruction":"Give me normal and abnormal value of liver function test parameters,with their full form","output":"Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are a group of blood tests used to assess the state of the liver and biliary system.

Вопрос можно разбить на несколько этапов: 1. Выбор 3 различных цифр из 10 возможных (0-9). 2. Выбор той цифры, которая будет использоваться дважды и троекратно, учитывая, что одна цифра должна повторяться дважды, а другая — три раза. 3. Распределение выбранных цифр по 6 позициям числа. **Этап 1:** Выбор 3 различных цифр. Для выбора трех различных цифр из десяти возможных используем комбинации без повторений: C(10,3). В комбинации порядок не важен, значит, формула будет такой: (C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}), где (n=10), (k=3): [C(10,3) = frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = frac{10!}{3!7!} = frac{10 times 9 times 8}{3 times 2 times 1} = 120] **Этап 2:** Выбор цифры для двойного и тройного использования. Из выбранных трех цифр одна будет использована дважды, другая троекратно, и третья однократно. Есть (C(3,1)) способов выбрать цифру, которая повторится дважды, и автоматически (C(2,1)) выбор для той, что повторится трижды (но фактически, этот выбор однозначен после выбора первой, так что важен лишь первый выбор). Поскольку для выбора 1 элемента из 3-х (C(3,1) = 3), каждый из трёх выборов создаёт уникальную ситуацию, но с точки зрения этого подсчёта каждая комбинация трёх выбранных цифр ведёт к трем различным способам их использовать. Таким образом, с этим шагом не увеличивается общее количество комбинаций, так как мы рассматриваем все возможные распределения для каждой из выбранных комбинаций цифр. **Этап 3:** Распределение цифр по 6 позициям. Теперь нам нужно распределить эти цифры по шести позициям. У нас есть две цифры, которые повторяются (одна дважды и одна трижды), и одна цифра, которая не повторяется. Мы имеем дело с перестановками с повторениями. Позиции для цифры, повторяющейся дважды, можно выбрать (C(6,2)) способами, а для цифры, повторяющейся трижды, после (C(4,3)) способами, но поскольку эти цифры неотличимы между собой в группах их повторения, нас интересует общее количество расстановок 6 элементов в порядке, где три элемента одинаковы, два других также одинаковы, а один уникален. Это будет перестановка сочетания с повторениями и рассчитывается как (P = frac{6!}{2!3!1!}).

Programmes in this vein were developed by private individuals and continued by royal officials. In 1720, for example, it was decreed that the poor should be divided into those able and those unable to work. The able-bodied were to be accepted in the asylums only under conditions that would leave a lasting impression on these ‘useless and shameful elements of the state'.183 After deliberations that referred repeatedly to foreign experiences, in 1724 this question, ‘which in all well-governed states is always seen as one of the most important', was addressed systematically and on a national scale.184 All the asylums were placed under state supervision. Public financial assistance was provided for what were predominantly church institutions. It was decreed at the same time that anyone who failed to find work had themselves to apply for admission to an asylum. The inmates were to be employed either in the establishment itself, or on roadbuilding in groups of twenty. The obligation of ‘voluntary application' did not change the fact that all inmates were initially to be taught a lesson. For the first two months they received only bread and water. If they still failed to find work after they were discharged, this punishment period would be extended the next time round. ‘Recidivists' of this kind were to be reported to a central registry office in Paris, which would maintain lists of inmates. The intendants were charged with overseeing all these procedures, and making sure that in case of need, the surplus unemployed were transported to other asylums. Above all, they were to seek work.185 The reality, however, was far less systematic. Not all beggars were arrested, nor were there sufficient asylums to lock them all up. The announcement of the new strategy was followed by a new round of inflation in 1725. The number of beggars grew, while the costs of their maintenance in the asylums rose together with the price of bread. The promise of support, as far as it went, soon met with a limit. The central information office scarcely functioned in any sense. From 1731, the law of 1724 was in practice no longer implemented, and in 1734 the release of able-bodied beggars was officially ordered. This did not however signal the end of the intention to lock away poverty. In theory a clear distinction was made between hospitals [hôtels de Dieu], asylums [hôpitaux] and prisons, and in 1734 the asylums were made respon-sible above all for foundlings, the aged, invalids and prostitutes. In practice, as Foucault demonstrated, it was more or less accidental whether someone ended up in prison, asylum or hospital. In most of the hospitals medical care was scarcely any more common than in asylums, and all establishments were equally unhygienic. Both types of institution, however, served as experimental grounds for medicine. This led to a great deal of progress in surgery, with surgeons operating on unanaesthetised patients in large rooms and in the presence of other sick people, trying out new procedures and perfecting estab-lished ones. This was how the great Paris hospital of the Santé soon acquired its reputation as the best in the world. Work was allocated in both asylums and hospitals, and the price that these establishments received for their inmates' services was regularly below the going rate. Housekeeping rules were either strictly implemented or scarcely observed, according to the particular management, but they were strict almost everywhere. In many asylums the inmates were forced to live like monks and nuns, and address each other as sister and brother; almost all applied far- reaching rules of silence. In many, too, they took minor orders, whilst in others they had only to go to confession before high feast days.186 Of the many obstacles that stood in the way of a national realisation of this reform programme, we can mention only one here. Though town authorities and intendants were responsible for a more or less thorough supervision of all establishments for the poor, these continued to be run almost entirely by nuns. For many of these pious women, it was more important to be merciful and lead the poor to eternal bliss than to categorise them according to their potential usefulness to society and treat them accordingly. Though there were a growing number of churchmen in the eighteenth century (as we shall see below) who emphasised the utility of the church for society, it was the good fortune of the imprisoned poor that it still took a good while before the rigorous pedagogic habitus that such a subordination of the church to a secularly determined social utility towards the poor implied became widespread among the church personnel concerned. (A habitus of this kind, we may remark here in passing, was generally adopted or developed first of all by personnel who were interested in a professionalisation of their own activity.) Irrespective of the limited realisation of previous arrangements, the crown set out to perfect guidelines for the management of poverty. In 1764, a com-mission set up by the government worked out new regulations. The poor were in future to be divided and treated as follows: 1) Able-bodied beggars were equated with vagabonds and the rigorous penal measures applied to these extended to them as well. Men were to be sent to the galleys - initially for a fixed term, subsequently for life -, women and those men too old for the galleys were to be taken into the asylums and work there. 2) Cripples were no longer to be taken into the asylums, but to be cared for at home. 3) The weak (old people, the sick, the mad, deformed and cripples with no income, foreigners) were to be taken into asylums. New asylums and hospitals were to be built as needed, and old ones improved. 4) Children were to be sent home if they still had parents. Others were to be given out until the age of sixteen to peasant families, who would be compensated for their maintenance. It was proposed at the same time to create in each province for a transitional period a depot to receive beggars caught on the streets. Whilst these depots were unambiguously to be penal establishments, the asylums were now declared welfare institutions. All the same, women beggars, prostitutes and the mad continued to be sent to asylums, and no regulations were even made to change asylum conditions. Along with the demand to run asylums more economically than previously, the intendants were now given the proposals of the general commission as recommendations for their practice. They were in addition required to set up alms offices everywhere for administering private donations.187 These instructions were followed the very same year by the Déclaration concernant les vagabonds et gens sans aveu, which codified the penal measures proposed by the commission.188 It attests to the development of the royal apparatus of government that these instructions were actually carried out, and depots for beggars established in many places. When it was decided to give the police rewards for catching beggars, these depots were very soon filled. A decade later, in 1775, Turgot ordered the depots to be closed, apart from five. The intendants were instead to establish atéliers de charité throughout the country, designed to provide work. (Turgot had roadbuilding especially in mind, so that poor law policy in a sense replaced the corvée.) But already two weeks later, the minister found himself forced to go back on this decision, as many of the released beggars had embarked on a rampage of robbery and taken part in the so-called 'flour war' (cf. below). There was only one notable exception from this general criminalisation that was remarkable for its time: the establishment of provision for wounded, ill and frail soldiers who had served the king for a long period. Despite their limited practical significance, these reform programmes marked the transition from the more indiscriminate repression and equally indiscriminate leniency of the past to a regulation of the different extent of punishment, disciplining and care that was to be shown to the various catego-ries of the poor. There was the beginning, in other words, of a management of poverty. Grain policy might be adduced here as an objection to this interpretation. For this was oriented not to management but to provision. In fact, the crown's grain policy more or less coincided with the first reform attempts in dealing with the poor. (On a local scale, such practices went back much longer.) But this was not so much an innovation as rather a result of the strengthening of royal rule in the provinces. Where intendants were employed to control the existing institutions of rule and make specific administrative arrangements (i.e. not in the pays d'état), they also had the task of fulfilling the traditional duties of lords. Monasteries continued to distribute food in time of need, town authorities maintained stocks of grain, and sometimes even landlords or their wives were generous towards needy peasant families. Kings, too, followed this traditional pattern of behaviour. When bread was scarce in Paris, Louis XIV had bread baked in the Louvre. When the archbishop of Chartres informed Louis XV in 1739 that the people were eating grass and there could soon be plague, the weeping queen offered him 100 louis dor.189 This was, in other words, a matter of locally limited charity by the lords - a requirement of the practice of personal rule for centuries. As for political measures by the crown, these were confined to the ban on exporting wheat that was frequently repeated in times of shortage. There were also specific measures to ensure the provisioning of Paris, this being an aspect of the royal regulation of local rule in the capital. To ensure this, Louis XV had grain purchased throughout the kingdom, a practice that drove prices still higher, especially in those districts where little grain was grown. Finally, this measure amounted to an official admission that the traditional method of food policy, i.e. local fixing of prices, no longer brought success. In 1725, attempts of this kind came to an end in Paris, and later in many other places as well.”翻译为中文","output":"十八世纪见证了对穷人教育方法的新阶段。这种模式的计划由私人个体发展，并由皇家官员继续。例如，在1720年，有规定将穷人分为能工作的和不能工作的两类。有劳动能力的人只能在满足某些条件的情况下被接纳进收容所，这些条件将对这些“国家无用且可耻的元素”留下持久印象。183 经过多次提到外国经验的讨论，在1724年，这个问题被系统地并在全国范围内解决，这个问题在所有管理良好的国家中始终被视为最重要的之一。184 所有收容所都置于国家监督之下。为主要是教会机构提供的公共财政援助。同时规定，任何找不到工作的人必须自己申请进入收容所。收容所里的人要么在机构内工作，要么分成20人的小组从事道路建设。 “自愿申请”的义务并没有改变所有入住者最初都要受到教训的事实。前两个月他们只接受面包和水的供应。如果他们出院后仍然找不到工作，这种惩罚期将在下一次延长。“惯犯”将被报告到巴黎的一个中央注册处，该处将维护入住者名单。总督负责监督所有这些程序，并确保在需要时，多余的失业者被运送到其他收容所。最重要的是，他们要寻找工作。185 然而，现实情况远不如此系统化。并不是所有的乞丐都被逮捕，也没有足够的收容所将他们全部关押起来。宣布新战略后，1725年爆发了新一轮的通货膨胀。乞丐的数量增加，随着面包价格的上涨，他们在收容所中的维护成本也增加了。支持承诺在一定程度上很快就遇到了极限。中央信息办公室在任何意义上几乎无法正常运作。从1731年起，1724年的法律实际上不再实施，到1734年官方命令释放有劳动能力的乞丐。然而，这并没有标志着结束将贫困关押起来的意图。 在理论上，医院[hôtels de Dieu]、收容所[hôpitaux]和监狱之间有明确的区分，在1734年收容所主要负责发现的弃儿、老年人、残疾人和妓女。但实际上，正如福柯所证明的，一个人最终是被关进监狱、收容所还是医院，多少有些偶然。在多数医院中，医疗护理并不比收容所中更常见，所有机构都同样不卫生。然而，这两种机构都作为医学实验场所。这促进了外科手术方面的许多进步，外科医生在大房间内对未麻醉的病人进行手术，在其他病人面前尝试新程序并完善既有程序。这就是巴黎的大医院Santé很快获得世界上最好的声誉的原因。 在收容所和医院中都分配了工作，这些机构为其收留人员的服务所获得的价格通常低于市场价格。家政规则或者是严格实施，或者几乎不被遵守，这取决于具体的管理，但几乎在每个地方都很严格。在许多收容所中，收留人员被迫像僧侣和修女一样生活，并互相称呼为兄弟姐妹；几乎所有都实施了严格的沉默规则。在许多收容所中，他们接受了小圣职，而在其他收容所中，他们只需在重要节日前去忏悔。186 在实现这一改革计划的全国范围内，我们在这里只能提到一个障碍。尽管市政当局和总督负责对所有贫困机构进行或多或少彻底的监督，但这些机构几乎完全由修女经营。对许多这样的虔诚女性来说，慈悲和引导穷人获得永恒的幸福比根据他们对社会的潜在用处进行分类并相应地对待他们更为重要。尽管在十八世纪（如我们下面将看到的）有越来越多的教士强调教会对社会的实用性，但关押的穷人的好运还是花了相当长的时间，这种严格的教育习性才在关心的教会人员中普及。（我们在这里顺便提一下，这种习性通常首先被那些对自己活动的专业化感兴趣的人员采纳或发展。） 尽管以前的安排实现有限，皇冠开始完善管理贫困的指导方针。1764年，政府设立的委员会制定了新的规定。将来的穷人应该被分为并按以下方式对待：1）有劳动能力的乞丐与流浪者等同，并将适用于这些人的严厉刑罚措施扩展到他们身上。男性将被送往划桨船——最初为固定期限，后来为终身；妇女和那些年龄太大不能去划桨船的男性则被收容进收容所并在那里工作。2）残疾人不再被收容进收容所，而是在家中得到照顾。3）弱势群体（老年人、病人、疯子、残疾人和没有收入的畸形人、外国人）将被收容进收容所。根据需要建造新的收容所和医院，并改善旧的设施。4）如果孩子们还有父母，应该被送回家。其他的应该被送给农民家庭，直到十六岁，并为他们的维护提供补偿。同时提议在每个省为过渡期建立一个用来接收街头被抓到的乞丐的仓库。尽管这些仓库明确地被视为刑事机构，收容所现在被宣布为福利机构。尽管如此，妇女乞丐、妓女和疯子继续被送往收容所，并且甚至没有制定改变收容所条件的规定。 除了比以前更经济地运行收容所的要求外，现在还给总督提出了总委员会的建议作为他们实践的提议。此外，他们还被要求到处建立救济办公室以管理私人捐款。187 这些指示在同一年紧随其后的是关于流浪者和无照个人的“声明”，该声明对委员会提出的刑罚措施进行了编码。188 这证明了皇家政府机构的发展，这些指示实际上得到了执行，许多地方建立了乞丐仓库。当决定给予警察奖励以抓捕乞丐时，这些仓库很快就被填满了。 十年后，1775年，图尔戈特命令除了五个之外关闭所有仓库。相反，总督们应在全国范围内建立慈善工作坊，旨在提供工作。（图尔戈特特别考虑到道路建设，因此在某种意义上，贫困政策取代了劳役制。）但仅仅两周后，部长就不得不收回此决定，因为许多被释放的乞丐开始进行抢劫并参与所谓的“面粉战争”（见下文）。 这种普遍的犯罪化中有一个值得注意的例外，对于当时来说是显著的：为长期为国王服役的受伤、生病和体弱的士兵提供供养。 尽管这些改革计划在实践中的意义有限，它们标志着从过去较为不加区分的压制和同样不加区分的宽容，到对不同程度的处罚、训练和关怀显示给各类贫困人口的管理的转变。换句话说，开始了贫困的管理。 这种解释可能会因为谷物政策而受到反驳。因为这是以供应而不是管理为导向的。事实上，皇冠的谷物政策与处理贫困的首次改革尝试几乎同时发生。（在地方层面，这样的实践追溯更久。）但这不太是创新，而是皇家统治在省份加强的结果。 在那些由总督来控制现有统治机构并做出具体行政安排的地方（即不在pays d'état中），他们还负责履行领主的传统职责。修道院在需要时继续分发食物，市政当局保持谷物库存，有时甚至地主或他们的妻子也会慷慨地帮助需要的农民家庭。国王们也遵循了这种传统的慈善模式。当巴黎缺乏面包时，路易十四在卢浮宫烘焙面包。当夏特尔的大主教在1739年告知路易十五人们正在吃草，可能很快会有瘟疫时，哭泣的皇后给了他100路易金币。189 换句话说，这是领主们长期以来个人统治实践所要求的局部限定的慈善行为。至于王室的政治措施，它们局限于在短缺时期经常重复的禁止小麦出口。也有确保巴黎供应的特定措施，这是王室对首都地方统治的规定的一个方面。为了确保这一点，路易十五在王国各地购买谷物，这一做法使价格尤其是在谷物产少的地区大幅上涨。最终，这一措施相当于官方承认传统的食品政策方法，即地方定价，不再能带来成功。1725年，这种尝试在巴黎结束，后来在许多其他地方也是如此。"},{"instruction":"请将“When the traditional instrumentarium of supply policy - export bans, reserves, price fixing - was transformed into an actual regulatory power of the crown, it also began to be dismantled. Abandonment of an export ban was followed by abandonment of price fixing. All trade restrictions on grain were finally abolished in 1763-4. The government followed here the view of contemporary experts that supply of grain would increase in the long run if no barriers were placed to its profitable sale. The edict of 1764 proclaimed that, according to all advice, free trade in grain was ‘the best possibility . . . for extending the cultivation of land, the product of which forms the most basic and secure source for the wealth of the state'.190 It was nevertheless expressly laid down that Paris should continue to maintain stocks. Immediate protests were raised. A series of provincial parlements expressed fears for grain supply. Police 'officials' protested against the withdrawal of their profitable supervisory functions. The time was also unfavourable for the introduction of the new policy. In 1767 the harvest was bad, and the following year saw bread riots in many places, with the police sometimes refusing to intervene. When the situation did not improve in subsequent years, the inten-dants also increasingly demanded measures to ensure supply. Even though Turgot, one of the most forceful champions of physiocrat dogma, requested troops to put down the disturbances in his capacity of intendant of Limoges, he also began to use tax money to purchase corn abroad.191 When he was appointed minister in 1776, Turgot again introduced com-plete free trade, despite this earlier experience and despite the bad harvest of the preceding year. He also ended the stockpiling of grain for Paris. This gave speculators free rein. In the early months of the year the price of bread in Paris rose from 8 sous to 9, 11, and eventually 14, in some regions even higher. At the end of April, the Beaumont carters and peasants of the district set their own price for bread, and on 3 May the Paris population demanded a fixed price. News of these events rapidly spread, and popular masses all around Paris implemented a taxation populaire. This guerre de farine or 'flour war' was put down only by hundreds of arrests, the intervention of the military and two public hangings in Paris. Rudé took the repression of this taxation populaire as an occasion to note that the poor could not prevail if all the possessing classes, from the urban bourgeois up to the bishops, stood on the side of order, while soldiers obeyed the commands of their officers.192 After a good harvest in 1775, grain supply improved, and for ten years the price of bread remained more or less stable. Free-trade policy was a response to the demands for food provision that were increasingly directed at the crown in the eighteenth century. It signalled an end to the traditional practices of personal rule. From now on even the greatest distress would no longer be relieved by a limitation of consumption by the rich, and the crown refused to intervene. In place of a good order imposed by power, supply was now to depend on an abandonment of policy in favour of the effect of the market. This innovation coincided in time with the systematising of ideas and methods for managing poverty. The latter in a certain sense dealt with those problems that the market could not settle. The centre of public-order policy under the ancien régime lay not in the poli-cies for preventing and managing the crises of food supply that have been described above, but rather in practices of rule directed towards enforcing the unity of religious belief. For centuries, sacred and secular rule had both been involved in the suppression of godlessness, immorality and heresy. Secular lords threatened penalties hard on the heels of the crime, sacred lords followed with eternal damnation. Religion, however, and a morality based on religion, were not only the regulating instances of everyday life, they also marked the horizon to which legitimisation of rule and demands for its reform were oriented. Just as in other societies of the ancien régime, so also in France the Reformation was not only a great shock to established church rule, but also brought a permanent change in the relationship between church and crown. From now on, this was no longer a relationship between secular rule and a single Catholic church, but rather to a plurality of confessions. With the Edict of Nantes, the French crown - as described above - placed itself in an established relationship to both major Christian denominations. By making the Protestants into a privileged corporation, it equally reduced the Catholic church to a similar status, curtailing in other words the claim to universality the church had always defended. As was soon to be shown, the time was not yet ripe for this policy, born out of the needs of war. It was not only combatted by the French clergy and all their supporters, and boycotted by Catholic officials in the provinces, it also contradicted the demand that the kingdom should no longer be simply ruled, but actually governed. For, in societies of the ancien-régime type, a policy aiming at establishing a unitary religious belief was seen as a key means of regulating the daily life of people of all stations in conformity with power. In the struggle against Protestantism, begun right after the death of Henri IV, the crown enjoyed the support of broad strata of the population and the great majority of its officials. The particular stages of this struggle can only be mentioned here in brief. In the years 1615 to 1629, the Protestant nobles were defeated militarily in a number of armed clashes. The peace of Alais (1629) decreed that all their fortresses were to be razed and their cannons melted down. The supplemen-tary agreements to the edict of Nantes were thereby cancelled, though the edict itself remained valid. The crown could scarcely have gone any further in the suppression of Protestantism, given its foreign policy at this time. In practice, the formally conceded privileges were interpreted in increasingly restrictive terms in the years that followed - quite apart from particular government strategies. In the chambres de l'édit that dealt with religious cases, the prescribed confessional parity was replaced by Catholic supremacy, in Protestant towns the admission of Catholics to local government was enforced, and even the right to Protestant religious observance, which was governed by clauses 8 and 9 of the edict, was now often conceded only in so far as this privilege could be proven by documentary evidence in the particular case. In 1634 the intendant of Languedoc, Antoine le Camus, requested that the government extend to the entire kingdom the practice of suppressing Protestant church services in this way that had already been applied in his province.193 The Fronde seemed to offer an occasion to reacquire the privileges of the edict of Nantes that had in practice already been lost. In its attempt to prevent the spread of this rebellion to regions with a strong Protestant presence, the government assured Protestants, in the 1652 declaration of St Germain, that all the rights they had previously possessed in Langudeoc and throughout the kingdom would again be respected. This declaration helped Protestants very little, though it intensified the opposition to Mazarin. The era of Louis XIV's personal rule marked a turning point in the inten-tions of this policy. Whilst the crown found itself forced in almost all other fields to accept established privileges, in the realm of religious practice it was no longer a matter of regulating, restricting or abolishing particular privileges of a confessional group accepted as a corporation, but rather of establishing royal rule over religious belief. From 1661 to 1679, the crown principally used the method of forceful persuasion. Huguenots who formally abjured their faith were rewarded. Certain nobles were literally bought - in a traditional practice of rule that went back for centuries. Many even declared that they were Huguenots simply to abjure and claim their reward.194 From 1679 - coinciding with the attempt to limit the influence of the pope in France and suppress the Jansenist movement (cf. below) - policy towards the Huguenots shifted. In 1684 the edict of Nantes was formally revoked. Protestant churches and schools were closed (apart from in Alsace). Pastors were forced to convert or were banished. Lay preachers who held services in secret were imprisoned. A strategy of forcible conversion also began. Dragoons were billeted on Protestants, and expressly permitted any acts of violence. Drago- nades, imprisonments, dispatch to the galleys and execution had their success. Many Huguenots fled, especially the better off. Others converted. The government remained distrustful of these last, and they were forbidden to carry weapons. The start of the eighteenth century finally saw a campaign aiming to eradi-cate Protestantism completely. As against many of the better-off Huguenots, the peasants of the Cevennes, despite suffering and intimidation, had never been brought to abandon their faith. An abbot who had followed official orders in denouncing Huguenots was murdered in 1702. The crown then dispatched foreign mercenaries against the Cevennes peasants. This campaign lasted two years; it was bloody and had only a limited success. Even outward conformity with prescribed religious practice could only be enforced patchily. The camisards, as the resisting peasants called themselves, did not fight basically for Protestantism as such; the prophecies that became widespread among them in the time of persecution were rather far removed from its official doctrines. It was less a question of defending the privileges of a confession than of opposing the claim of the crown to control the beliefs of its subjects. It was in the struggle for freedom of belief that the new practice of government met with its first principled criticism. Even after the death of Louis XIV, both foreign-policy opposition to the ‘Protestant powers' of England and Prussia, and the attempts to enforce the unity of Catholic practice, prevented the Protestant faith from being officially tolerated once more. It was only under Louis XVI that the persecution came to an end. The appointment of Necker, a Protestant, to ministerial office, some-thing that would have been quite inconceivable a few decades earlier, marked the crown's departure from a long political tradition.”翻译为中文","output":"当供应政策的传统工具 - 出口禁令、储备、定价 - 被转化为皇权的实际调控力量时，它也开始被拆除。放弃出口禁令之后是放弃定价。最终，在1763-4年，所有对谷物的贸易限制被废除。政府在这里遵循了当代专家的观点，即如果不对其盈利性销售设置障碍，长期来看谷物供应将增加。1764年的法令宣布，根据所有建议，谷物自由贸易是“最佳可能性……扩大土地耕种，其产物构成了国家财富最基本和最稳定的来源”。190 然而，明确规定巴黎应继续维持储备。 立即引发了抗议。一系列省级议会表达了对谷物供应的担忧。警察“官员”对于撤销他们有利可图的监督职能表示抗议。此时引入新政策的时机也不利。1767年的收成不好，次年许多地方爆发了面包暴动，有时警察拒绝介入。当随后几年情况没有改善时，总督们也越来越多地要求采取确保供应的措施。即使图尔戈特，作为最强有力的重农学派支持者之一，在担任利摩日总督期间要求出动军队镇压骚乱，他也开始利用税收资金在国外购买玉米。191 当他在1776年被任命为部长时，图尔戈特再次引入完全自由贸易，尽管有之前的经历和前一年的糟糕收成。他还结束了为巴黎储备谷物的做法。这给了投机者自由发挥的空间。一年初几个月内，巴黎的面包价格从8苏到9，11，最终到14，某些地区甚至更高。到4月底，博蒙特的马车夫和该地区的农民为面包定下了自己的价格，在5月3日巴黎人民要求固定价格。这些事件的消息迅速传开，巴黎周围的平民大众实施了一种popular taxation（流行征税）。这场guerre de farine或“面粉战争”最终通过数百人被逮捕、军队介入和在巴黎的两次公开绞刑才被平息。鲁德（Rudé）借此popular taxation的镇压之际指出，如果所有拥有阶层，从城市资产阶级到主教，站在秩序一边，而士兵服从他们官员的命令，穷人就无法取胜。192 在1775年丰收之后，谷物供应改善，十年来面包价格或多或少保持稳定。自由贸易政策是对18世纪日益针对皇冠的食物供应需求的回应。它标志着个人统治传统做法的终结。从现在开始，即便是最大的困境也不再通过限制富人的消费得到缓解，皇冠拒绝介入。取而代之的是，供应现在依赖于放弃政策，让市场的影响发挥作用。这一创新与系统化管理贫困的思想和方法的时间上是一致的。后者在某种意义上处理了市场无法解决的问题。 古制度下公共秩序政策的核心不在于上述预防和管理食物供应危机的政策，而在于针对强化宗教信仰统一的统治实践。几个世纪以来，神圣和世俗统治都参与了对无神论、不道德行为和异端的压制。世俗领主紧随罪行之后威胁以惩罚，神圣领主随后以永恒的诅咒相随。然而，宗教以及基于宗教的道德不仅是日常生活的调节者，它们还标志着统治合法化和改革要求的地平线。就像在其他古制度社会一样，宗教改革不仅对既定的教会统治造成了巨大冲击，也永久改变了教会与皇冠之间的关系。从现在开始，这不再是世俗统治与一个统一的天主教会之间的关系，而是与多种宗派之间的关系。通过南特勒令，正如上文所述，法国王冠与两个主要的基督教派别建立了确定的关系。通过将新教徒变为特权集团，同样将天主教会降为类似的地位，换句话说，削弱了教会一直捍卫的普世要求。很快就会表明，这一出于战争需要而生的政策时机尚未成熟。它不仅遭到了法国神职人员及其所有支持者的抵制，并在省份的天主教官员中受到抵制，它还与不应仅仅被统治、而实际上应该被治理的王国的要求相矛盾。因为，在古制度类型的社会中，旨在建立统一宗教信仰的政策被视为一种关键手段，以使所有阶层的人民的日常生活符合权力规定。在亨利四世去世后立即开始的反对新教主义的斗争中，王冠得到了广大民众和绝大多数官员的支持。 这场斗争的特定阶段在此只能简要提及。在1615年至1629年间，新教贵族在一系列武装冲突中被军事打败。阿莱（Alais）和平（1629年）规定所有他们的堡垒都要被夷为平地，他们的大炮要被融化。南特勒令的补充协议因此被取消，尽管该勒令本身仍然有效。鉴于当时的外交政策，王冠在压制新教主义方面几乎无法走得更远。实际上，在随后的几年中，正式承认的特权被越来越严格地解释——完全不同于特定政府策略。在处理宗教案件的chambres de l'édit中，规定的宗派平衡被天主教优势所取代，在新教城镇强制接纳天主教徒进入地方政府，并且即便是根据勒令第8和第9条规定的新教宗教仪式的权利，现在也常常只在可以通过文件证据在特定案例中证明此特权的情况下才被承认。1634年，朗格多克地区的总督安托万·勒·卡姆斯（Antoine le Camus）要求政府将他的省份已经实施的以这种方式压制新教教堂服务的做法扩展到整个王国。193 弗龙德（Fronde）似乎提供了一个机会，可以重新获得实际上已经丧失的南特勒令的特权。政府在1652年的圣日耳曼宣言中向新教徒保证，为防止这场叛乱蔓延到新教势力强大的地区，他们之前在朗格多克和整个王国拥有的所有权利将再次受到尊重。这一声明对新教徒帮助甚少，尽管它加剧了对马扎林的反对。 路易十四个人统治的时代标志着这一政策意图的转折点。虽然王冠在几乎所有其他领域都被迫接受既定特权，在宗教实践领域不再是调节、限制或废除作为企业接受的特定宗派团体的特权的问题，而是建立对宗教信仰的皇家统治。从1661年到1679年，王冠主要使用强制说服的方法。正式放弃信仰的胡格诺派获得奖励。某些贵族实际上被买通了——这是一种追溯数世纪的传统统治做法。许多人甚至宣称他们是胡格诺派仅仅是为了放弃信仰并领取奖励。194 从1679年开始——与试图限制教皇在法国的影响力并压制耶ansen主义运动（见下文）的尝试同时——对胡格诺派的政策发生了转变。1684年正式废除了南特勒令。关闭新教教堂和学校（除了在阿尔萨斯地区）。牧师被迫转换信仰或被放逐。秘密举行宗教仪式的俗人传教士被监禁。还开始了一种强制转化的策略。将龙骑兵安置在新教徒家中，并明确允许任何暴力行为。龙骑兵行动、监禁、送往划桨船和执行死刑取得了成功。许多胡格诺派逃离，尤其是较富裕者。其他人转换信仰。政府对这些最后的人仍然不信任，他们被禁止携带武器。 十八世纪初最终见证了一场旨在彻底根除新教主义的运动。与许多较富裕的胡格诺派不同，塞文山脉的农民尽管遭受痛苦和恐吓，却从未放弃他们的信仰。1702年，一位按照官方命令举报胡格诺派的修道士被谋杀。皇冠随后派遣外籍雇佣兵对付塞文山脉的农民。这场运动持续了两年；它流血而且只取得了有限的成功。即使外在的宗教规范也只能零碎地被执行。自称为camisards的抵抗农民并不基本上是为了新教主义本身而战；在迫害期间在他们中间流行的预言与其官方学说相去甚远。这更多是反对王冠控制其臣民信仰的要求，而不是捍卫某一宗派的特权。在为信仰自由的斗争中，新的政府实践遇到了其首次原则性批评。 即使在路易十四去世后，对“新教国家”英国和普鲁士的外交政策反对，以及强制实施天主教实践统一的尝试，也阻止了新教信仰被再次官方容忍。只有在路易十六执政期间，这种迫害才结束。任命新教徒内克尔为部长一职——在几十年前这是完全无法想象的——标志着王冠脱离了长期的政治传统。"},{"instruction":"请将“Just as in other realms, so in France after the Reformation it was not just Protestants who demanded the right to live in accordance with their deepest convictions, independently if need be from the prevailing church practice. Catholics did so as well; in a word, they demanded freedom of conscience within the dominant church. Once the military power of the Protestants had been broken, Jansenism, the most influential of the reform movements within the Catholic church, presented a far more serious challenge to the dominant ruling practice. This was all the more so, in that Jansenism, since becoming a religious movement, stood above all in opposition to the Jesuits, and while this order had always encountered considerable reservation in France, it did enjoy the protection of the crown - especially under Louis XIV. Jansenism, named after Cornelius Jansenius, bishop of Ypres, defined itself as the theological counterpole to Molinarism. Not all Jesuits, but the majority of them, adhered to the theological view put forward by Luis Molinarius in 1588, that men did not live in original sin, i.e. they were not basically bad, but were in a position to act well. God however expected very little from men. In the context of moral theology, the Jesuits interpreted this theological position as meaning that God was already content if the rituals of religious practice were maintained. Though the members of the order generally followed a strict way of life themselves, their attitude towards Christians in the outside world responded rather to the conditions of worldly existence. Janse- nius, on the other hand, in his Augustinius that was posthumously published in 1640, held that men were so bad that they needed God's mercy in order to do good works. This was in other words a doctrine of predestination, though one that - unlike Calvinism - remained tied to salvation by works. Jansenists demanded a serious practice of religion, an ascetic way of life, a strict morality and the renunciation of worldly strivings. They believed that it was the right of the faithful to read the Bible, promoted the education of children by founding their own schools, the petites écoles, and maintained that local parish priests had the same authority as bishops. The enhanced value that Jansenists placed on the parish priests led to Jansenism and Richerism being seen by many as forming a unity, for Edmond Richer also held that the authority of parish priests in the church was on a par with that of bishops. (He also maintained that the pope should accept the decisions of councils.) Many lower clergy who expressed views akin to Richer's over bishops were accused of Jansenism - rightly or wrongly. It was the authorities that made Jansenism into a religious movement. The crown took a critical view of this orientation right from the start, as Jansenius severely criticised the anti-Spanish, i.e. antiCatholic foreign policy of Louis XIII. The regular persecution of Jansenists began with the imprisonment of a prominent champion of Jansenius's doctrine of salvation in 1653. In the same year Pope Innocent X, at the request of the French crown, published the first bull against the theological views represented by Jansenism. In 1660 Louis XIV announced that he was ready to root out Jansenism; this was a basic element in the personal government that he now exercised. If the ruling programme later described as absolutism, and associated especially with le roi soleil, found expression anywhere, it was in the determination to rule the religious practice of his subjects. In 1660 the petites écoles were closed, and 1664 saw the struggle commence against the convent of Port-Royal, which had become a meeting point and intellectual centre of Jansenism. At this point, Jansenism developed from a tendency within Catholicism defined above all in theological terms, to which members of the clergy and a small circle of educated laity were attracted, into a religious movement. Prayer books for lay people were published, including a compilation with translated extracts from the New Testament that was violently attacked. Jansenism eventually became a kind of party. All those who opposed the religious views of the Jesuits and their special connection with the pope were accused of belonging to it. The Jesuits' particular obedience to the pope, which was rewarded with fiscal and legal privileges, collided with the principle of Gallicanism that had long been a presence in France: the view that the rule of the pope over the French church was to be restrained - whether by councils or by the king's judicial power. Whilst this Gallican implication of Jansenism brought the movement high-placed supporters and even enthusiasts, it was its Richerist aspect that attracted parish priests. The Lettres provinciales that Blaise Pascal published after his conversion also contributed to the appeal of Jansenism among the lower clergy. The social expansion of Jansenism was accompanied by miracles, the first of many taking place in 1656. These generally occurred at the graveside of Jansenist priests who had lived a godly life. The secular power responded to the expansion of Jansenism with lettres de cachet, the religious power with papal bulls. In view of growing internal dif-ficulties, and a criticism of his policy that could scarcely be suppressed, Louis XIV reacted impatiently to a movement which, since it demanded reform of the church, also implied criticism of secular power over religious belief. The temporary peak of his repressive policy was the attempt to destroy the convent of Port-Royal after the nuns had refused to accept the bull published against Jansenism in 1705. The earthquake of 1709 then served as an occasion to exhume the corpses of Jansenists who had been buried in the convent cemetery, and the order was subsequently given to plough up the site. Despite widespread criticism of this action, Louis XIV believed the time was ripe for a decisive final blow against Jansenism. He consequently requested a new papal bull against this heresy. The Bulle Unigenitus published in 1713 laid down quite precisely what beliefs and practices were forbidden. The theological positions were so rigorous that the assembly of French clergy was not prepared to accept the bull without certain qualifications. It provided the parlement de Paris with grounds for refusing to register the bull as law of the French kingdom. When the king insisted on the bull being registered, he sacrificed the long-established legal position that papal decrees could only have validity in France if they were formally adopted by the French clergy and subsequently registered by the parlements. Instead of eradicating Jansenism, the crown effected a long-term alliance between Jansenism and Gallicanism, in other words the protection of Jansenism by the parlement de Paris. This connection was to make protracted problems for subsequent governments. After 1713, all those in France who refused to accept the Bulle Unigenitus were deemed to be Jansenists. The precise regulation of belief that was intended with this bull caused more than a few priests to abandon their reli-gious office and seek other fields of activity. In the regency that followed the death of Louis XIV the question of Jansenism was not in the foreground, but in the 1730s it developed into a regular government crisis. There were two specific reasons for this. The first was the miracles that occurred at the grave of François de Pâris, a priest who died young and whose grave was visited by many who honoured him for his self-sacrificing service. Pâris had been a well-known opponent of the bull. It went without saying, then, that when increasing numbers of people from Paris and beyond made their pilgrimage to the Saint-Médard cemetery, this development was attributed to the Jansenist movement. Well-known representatives of Jansenism themselves promoted this view. A practice of chiliastic enthusiasm developed among the believers who came to the Saint-Médard cemetery. These convulsionaires disquieted the gov-ernment. Eventually the pope demanded that something be done. Since the crown could not count on the support of the courts, it had some of the convul- sionaires imprisoned and medically examined in the Bastille. The announce-ment was then made that the convulsions of the enthusiasts were deliberately induced bodily reactions, veiled in religious humbug. The government took care not to have the miracles that happened at the cemetery investigated, let alone to take legal action against them, but with this argument the cemetery was closed. This action however was quite unsuccessful, as well as provoking one of the finest graffiti in history. A short time after the gates of the cemetery had been locked shut, the following words were to be seen there: De par le roi, Défense à Dieu, De faire miracles En ce lieu. Though the violent persecution of the following decade deprived the enthusi-asts of their high-placed supporters and spokesmen, so that religious practice at the Saint-Médard cemetery fell back into a less respectable expression of the piety of the lower orders (continuing in this vein into the nineteenth century), the government's action did not mean the end of Jansenism. Persecution sub-sequently focused on the tendency's secret press. The Nouvelles ecclésiastiques appeared weekly from the 1720s, also containing detailed reports of political and legal questions. It cost 3 sous, which was relatively cheap. It was distrib-uted particularly in Paris, but dispatched even to small and remote villages.195 When the archbishop of Paris ordered the prosecution of those producing the paper, priests petitioned in its favour, and at the trial, the parlement de Paris upheld their right to intervene. The king decreed an edict ordering a general silence on the affair. The parlement however refused to obey this, was sent into exile for a year, conceded, and everything remained as it was. In the 1750s there was a new government crisis when the parlement de Paris declared it ille-gal for bishops to order that notorious anticonstitutionnaires (opponents of the Bulle Unigenitus) were only to receive extreme unction if they signed a docu-ment before their last confession acknowledging the validity of the bull.”翻译为中文","output":"正如在其他领域一样，法国在宗教改革后不仅是新教徒要求有权按照他们最深切的信念生活，必要时独立于现行的教会实践。天主教徒也是如此；简而言之，他们在主导教会内要求良心自由。一旦新教徒的军事力量被击败，耶ansen主义——天主教会内最有影响力的改革运动之一，对主导的统治实践提出了更为严重的挑战。尤其是因为耶ansen主义自成为一种宗教运动以来，主要反对耶稣会，而这个教团在法国一直遭到相当大的保留，但它确实享有皇冠的保护——特别是在路易十四统治下。 耶ansen主义以耶普的主教Cornelius Jansenius的名字命名，将自己定义为与摩利纳主义相对的神学反极。不是所有耶稣会士，但他们中的大多数，遵循Luis Molinarius在1588年提出的神学观点，即人类不生活在原罪之中，即他们本质上不坏，而是有能力做好事。然而，上帝对人的期望很少。在道德神学的背景下，耶稣会将这一神学立场解释为，如果保持宗教实践的仪式，上帝就已经满意了。尽管该教团的成员通常遵循严格的生活方式，但他们对外界基督徒的态度更多地回应了世俗生活的条件。另一方面，耶ansen在其遗著《Augustinius》（1640年死后出版）中认为，人类是如此邪恶，以至于他们需要上帝的怜悯才能做好事。换句话说，这是一种宿命论，尽管与加尔文主义不同——它仍然与凭借行为得救相联系。耶ansen主义者要求严肃的宗教实践、禁欲的生活方式、严格的道德和放弃世俗追求。他们认为信徒有权阅读圣经，通过创办自己的学校即小学校促进儿童教育，并坚持认为当地教区牧师与主教拥有相同的权威。耶ansen主义对教区牧师的重视导致许多人将耶ansen主义和Richer主义视为一体，因为Edmond Richer也认为教区牧师在教会中的权威与主教相当。（他还主张教皇应接受议会的决定。）许多对主教持有类似Richer观点的下级神职人员被指控为耶ansen主义——无论是否合理。是当局将耶ansen主义变成了一种宗教运动。皇冠从一开始就对这一倾向持批评态度，因为耶ansen严厉批评了路易十三反西班牙，即反天主教的外交政策。对耶ansen主义者的定期迫害始于1653年监禁一位耶ansen救赎论的杰出拥护者。同年，教皇英诺森十世应法国皇冠的请求，发布了第一份反对耶ansen主义所代表的神学观点的公告。1660年，路易十四宣布他准备根除耶ansen主义；这是他现在行使的个人统治的基本元素。如果所描述的统治程序后来被称为绝对主义，并特别与太阳王相关联，那么它的体现就在于决心统治他的臣民的宗教实践。1660年，小学校被关闭，1664年开始了针对已成为耶ansen主义聚会点和知识中心的Port-Royal修道院的斗争。 这时，耶ansen主义从一种主要在神学上定义的天主教内倾向发展成为一种宗教运动，吸引了神职人员和一小圈受过教育的平民。出版了供平信徒使用的祈祷书，包括一部包含新约翻译摘录的汇编，这部作品受到了激烈攻击。耶ansen主义最终成为一种党派。所有反对耶稣会的宗教观点和他们与教皇的特殊联系的人都被指控属于它。耶稣会对教皇的特别服从，这种服从以财政和法律特权作为回报，与在法国长期存在的加利加尼主义原则冲突：即对法国教会的教皇统治应受到限制 - 无论是通过议会还是通过国王的司法权力。尽管这种加利加尼主义含义为耶ansen主义带来了高层支持者甚至热情拥护者，但它的Richer主义方面吸引了教区牧师。布莱士·帕斯卡尔在皈依后发表的《省信》也为耶ansen主义在下级神职人员中的吸引力做出了贡献。 耶ansen主义的社会扩张伴随着奇迹的出现，第一个奇迹发生在1656年。这些奇迹通常发生在过着虔诚生活的耶ansen主义神父的墓地上。 世俗权力用lettre de cachet回应耶ansen主义的扩张，宗教权力则用教皇公告。鉴于日益增长的内部困难，以及几乎无法遏制的对其政策的批评，路易十四对一场要求教会改革的运动表现出不耐烦，因为这也意味着对世俗权力对宗教信仰的批评。他镇压政策的暂时高峰是在1705年反对耶ansen主义公布的教皇公告被修女们拒绝接受后，试图摧毁Port-Royal修道院。随后，1709年的地震成为了借口，挖掘了在修道院墓地埋葬的耶ansen主义者的尸体，并随后下令犁平该地点。尽管这一行动受到广泛批评，路易十四认为时机已成熟，可以对耶ansen主义进行决定性的最后一击。因此，他请求对这种异端发布新的教皇公告。1713年发布的《独生子》公告非常精确地规定了禁止的信仰和做法。神学立场如此严苛，以至于法国神职人员大会不愿在没有某些限定的情况下接受该公告。这为巴黎议会提供了拒绝将该公告作为法国王国法律注册的理由。当国王坚持注册该公告时，他牺牲了长期确立的法律立场，即教皇法令只有在被法国神职人员正式采纳并随后由议会注册后才在法国有效。皇冠的行动并未根除耶ansen主义，反而造成了耶ansen主义与加利加尼主义的长期联盟，换句话说就是巴黎议会对耶ansen主义的保护。这种联系为后来的政府带来了长期的问题。 1713年之后，在法国，所有拒绝接受《独生子》公告的人被视为耶ansen主义者。这个公告旨在对信仰进行精确规定，导致不少神父放弃了他们的宗教职务，寻求其他活动领域。在路易十四去世后的摄政时期，耶ansen主义问题并不是主要关注的焦点，但在1730年代，它发展成为一场常规的政府危机。这有两个具体原因。第一个是发生在年轻牧师弗朗索瓦·德·帕里斯墓地的奇迹，他的墓地被许多因他无私服务而尊敬他的人所参观。帕里斯一直是该公告的知名反对者。因此，当越来越多的来自巴黎及其周边地区的人前往Saint-Médard墓地朝圣时，这一发展被归咎于耶ansen主义运动。耶ansen主义的知名代表自己也推动了这种观点。 信徒们在Saint-Médard墓地出现了一种千禧年热情的实践。这些convulsionnaire（抽搐者）令政府不安。最终，教皇要求采取行动。由于皇冠不能指望法院的支持，它在巴士底监狱监禁并医学检查了一些convulsionnaire。随后宣布，狂热者的抽搐是蓄意诱发的身体反应，掩盖了宗教骗局。政府小心翼翼地避免调查墓地发生的奇迹，更不用说采取法律行动了，但凭借这个论点，墓地被关闭了。这一行动非常不成功，也引发了历史上最精彩的涂鸦之一。在墓地大门被锁上不久后，可以看到以下文字： 出于国王之命， 禁止上帝， 在此地方 施行奇迹。 尽管接下来十年的激烈迫害使狂热者失去了他们的高层支持者和发言人，以至于在Saint-Médard墓地的宗教实践退回到下层阶级虔诚的表达中（这种趋势一直持续到19世纪），政府的行动并不意味着耶ansen主义的终结。迫害随后集中在该倾向的秘密出版社上。从1720年代开始，《新教会消息》每周出版一次，还包含政治和法律问题的详细报道。售价3苏，相对便宜。它主要在巴黎分发，但甚至发送到偏远的小村庄。当巴黎大主教下令起诉该报纸的制作者时，牧师们请愿支持该报，并在审判中，巴黎议会支持他们的干预权。国王颁布法令，命令对此事保持总体沉默。然而，议会拒绝服从，被流放一年，最终让步，一切保持原状。在1750年代，当巴黎议会宣布主教命令臭名昭著的反宪法者（反对《独生子》公告的人）只有在签署一份承认该公告有效性的文件后才能接受临终圣事，这是非法的，导致了新的政府危机。"},{"instruction":"请将“Jansenism reached its high point as an opposition movement with its vic-tory over the Jesuits. The conflict that Jansenists turned to their favour can only be briefly mentioned here. Jansenist lawyers used the opportunity provided by the bankruptcy of a Jesuit abbot who not only directed a monastery in Martinique, but also - or mainly - engaged in business there. Though religious orders were permitted to sell products produced on their lands, regular commerce was forbidden not just by the rules of the order, but also by the laws of the kingdom. With the argument that because of the especially strict duty of obedience of all Jesuit members, the order was responsible as such for the abbot's offence, the injured parties, who had been advised by the Jansenists, demanded compensation. Instead of paying, however, the Jesuit order presented a counterclaim to the parlement de Paris, expecting that the chamber responsible there would decide in its favour. But the Jansenist supporters in the parlement, few in number but extremely active, brought into play the principles of Galllicanism against the Jesuits' privileges, and their very public abuse in this case. Between 1762 and 1764, the order was condemned first by the parlement de Paris and then by all other parlements, and banned from France. The crown sought to prevent this development by decreeing a reform of the order, but it eventually had to give in. In 1764 the spearhead of Coun-ter-Reformation was banned from France, the order's schools were dissolved, and its wealth confiscated. This victory of Jansenism, however, represented the end of its significance as a centre of criticism of the ruling rule. The Nouvelles ecclésiastiques continued to appear through to the time of the Revolution, but became increasingly just a journal of private religious practice. The conflicts over Jansenism had lasted for an entire century, involving a relatively broad national public (though still unresearched in its quantitative scale). If the movement was initially centred exclusively in the educated classes, from the second half of the seventeenth century there were also satiri-cal sheets and journals in a more popular vein. Publications of this kind inte-grated the Jansenists into the anticlericalism that rapidly grew widespread in the course of the eighteenth century. In its criticism of the clergy in general and the Jesuits in particular, Jan-senists and lumières even came into contact. It was only after the ban on the Jesuits that antagonisms between the two tendencies became apparent. From the mid-1760s, Jansenism lost its importance as a point of crystallisation for the criticism of rule. In the government's conflicts with the parlement de Paris several years later, the attitude of certain judges on the Jesuit question still played a role, extraordinarily harsh conditions of exile being imposed on especially vigorous champions of the Jesuit ban, but this was only a delayed punishment. Jansenism belongs in the structural context of post-Reformation Catholicism, but was at the same time characteristic of a structural change in the sev-enteenth century: the emergence of a separate culture of the educated classes. Cutting across the cultural differences that persisted as a function of differ-ences in material conditions of life, across differences between urban and rural culture, and - to a certain degree - even across differences between noble and non-noble, there arose specific cultural forms of the educated classes, or to put it another way, a literary public that transcended local limits and an urban culture in which rules developed as to how to treat foreigners who belonged to this new cultural milieu.196 This differed from the earlier literary public that had already linked scholars living far removed from one another, not just in the greater number of its participants, but above all in the fact that in its forms of association and the media it employed it deliberately closed ranks against the lower orders. At the same time, the public of the educated classes opposed to the hereditary nobility in practice - and sometimes also explicitly - the notion of an intellectual nobility. They expressed a criticism of the existing criteria of hierarchy, but in no way of the principle of hierarchy in general. This structural development changed the conditions for the exercise of rule. The French crown dealt with this situation in three particular ways: by repres-sion, censorship and integration. The authors and publishers of libelles, those secretly produced scandalous writings and caricatures directed against authority, could only expect repres-sion. At the end of the seventeenth century, their distribution reached a level that had not been seen since the Fronde. Censorship operated in a similar way to repression, but went rather beyond this, in an attempt to regulate the production of books, papers and periodicals. Like many other things, censor-ship was newly regulated by Colbert, and in a particularly comprehensive fashion. His decree of 1686 was followed by governments in the next century. It aimed at restricting the number of printing presses. Printers were forced to join guilds, and the large printing presses were given privileges which ruined the small ones. The number of apprentices was also limited, and the number of journeymen subjected to special permission. Two copies of each book had to be supplied to the public library. While book production in Paris could be more or less controlled, in the provinces the censorship measures proved a failure. During the war years of the early eighteenth century, a complete ban on pamphlets and flyers was imposed on many occasions, but after a short while it always had to be revoked. The government acted differently towards the French-speaking newspapers that started to be imported from the Netherlands and Switzerland in the second half of the seventeenth century. It initially banned their import. But if a newspaper had established itself and proved to be not basically unfriendly towards the French government, it was officially tolerated - against payment of compensation to the Gazette de France (see below). Censorship made publication risky, but not impossible. The long history of ineffective censorship measures ended with the attempt to proscribe the Encyclopédie. Distribution of the first two volumes was still banned on the grounds that, in the words of the royal council of 7 February 1752, ‘several maxims are contained that could serve to undermine royal authority and establish a spirit of independence and revolt, while obscure and unclear notions offer foundations for confusion, the corruption of the state, the decline of religion and unbelief'.197 Subsequently, however, the authorities granted official permission for the volumes of the Encyclopédie to be printed over the Alsatian border, and each new volume was awaited by four thousand subscribers. From the seventeenth century, the integration of cultural forms of the educated classes proceeded via measures of repression and regulation. The centrepiece of this strategy was the institutionalising of académies that had ini-tially arisen as private foundations. Since Richelieu's time, as we have already mentioned, these received royal privileges and were regulated. There were also cultural forms of the educated classes that remained immune to regulation: the Masonic lodges, the sociability of the salons, the reading associations that were established in a large number of towns in the eighteenth century after the English model, as well as cafés in which newspapers were available. Private discussion circles were also established continually. Until the mid-eighteenth century, participants in serious discussion groups still had to expect difficulties. The events that d'Argenson recounts in his memoirs illustrate how this was not only a problem for people outside the court and the ‘administration'. In 1731, some 23 men (whom d'Argenson names) came together for regular discussion of important developments and scientific dis-coveries. Each of the 23 was allocated a particular subject on which he was to keep regularly informed. It was expected that he would read the most important topics in domestic and foreign publications, and correspond with scholars abroad. At regular intervals, the other members would then be sup-plied with a résumé of the field in question, for example public law or the art of government. Rumours of these gatherings of the Entresol, as the circle called itself, reached the court, and ‘it was said that we are ruling the state, and mixing in things that are not our concern'.198 Though d'Argenson had no actual office in the 1730s, he had from 1720 to 1725 been intendant in Hainaut and Cambrai, while another member of the circle was preceptor to the royal princes, and most of the rest occupied high positions in the church or the royal ‘administration'. The chief minister however imposed a more or less explicit ban. Fleury's reasoning, as shown in a letter to the Abbé Saint-Pierre of 11 April 1731, has an interest beyond this particular matter: I take it from your letter of yesterday that you intend to discuss political matters in your assemblies. But since such questions generally lead to other things that were not foreseen, they are not an appropriate subject. There are enough others that are equally worthy of your consideration, without their having the same consequences. If you are determined to continue your assemblies, I request you therefore not to discuss anything that might give cause for complaint . . .199 After indiscreet members of the circle had been shed, the meetings continued, necessarily in secret. Vexations at court, however, along with the awareness of being under observation and career considerations, soon brought an end to this unauthorised eighteenth-century académie. Thirty years later there were many circles of this kind, and they were now tolerated. The same went for the transformation of their reports into periodicals. As Jack R. Censer has shown for the example of the Gazette de France, which was founded in 1632 as the organ of the royal administration, the Courrier d'Avignon, a paper for France that was produced in the papal enclave, and the Gazette de Leyde, of which for example 2,650 copies were imported in 1778, the tenor of reports in all three papers had changed since the mid-century. Alongside reports of the royal family and the court, there was now reference to social tensions, to differing views among government officials, and to the mistakes of foreign (!) monarchs.200 Under Louis XVI the crown's strategy towards the media and the organ-isational forms of educated opinion underwent a change. The government did not abandon the principle of its claim to regulate public opinion, but it allowed an expanded room for manoeuvre in both thought and action. This permitted Jansenist and Protestant practice, private discussion circles and critical publications. This relaxation did not effect any large-scale opening of literary opinion. As Stephen Botein, Jack R. Censer and Harriet Ritvo have shown in a comparison of periodical literature at this time in England and France, the themes of French publications restricted the potential readership circle to a relatively small social stratum. Their producers continued to use their privileges as a means of making profit, rather than seeking to expand their markets.201”翻译为中文","output":"耶ansen主义作为反对运动达到高潮，是在它战胜耶稣会士时。耶ansen主义者把事态转向有利于他们的冲突只能在这里简要提及。耶ansen主义律师利用了一个耶稣会修道院院长的破产机会，这位院长不仅管理着马提尼克的一座修道院，而且还在那里从事商业活动——或者主要是从事商业活动。尽管宗教团体被允许销售他们土地上生产的产品，但规律的商业活动不仅被团体的规则禁止，也被王国的法律禁止。耶ansen主义者提出的论点是，由于耶稣会成员有特别严格的服从义务，该团体应对院长的行为负责，受害方在耶ansen主义者的建议下要求赔偿。然而，耶稣会没有支付赔偿，反而向巴黎议会提出了反诉，期望那里的负责法庭会对其有利。但是，在议会中人数虽少但极其活跃的耶ansen主义支持者利用加利加尼主义原则对抗耶稣会的特权，以及在这个案例中他们非常公开的滥用。在1762年到1764年间，耶稣会首先被巴黎议会，然后被所有其他议会定罪，并被禁止在法国境内。皇冠试图通过下达改革该团体的法令来阻止这一发展，但最终不得不让步。1764年，反宗教改革的尖兵被禁止在法国，该团体的学校被解散，财产被没收。然而，耶ansen主义的这一胜利，代表了其作为批评统治中心的意义的终结。《新教会消息》一直持续出版到革命时期，但逐渐仅仅成为一份私人宗教实践的期刊。 关于耶ansen主义的冲突持续了整整一个世纪，涉及相对广泛的国家公众（尽管在数量规模上仍未研究）。如果该运动最初完全集中在受过教育的阶层，从十七世纪下半叶起，也有更流行的讽刺小报和期刊。这类出版物将耶ansen主义者融入到在整个十八世纪迅速普及的反神职主义中。 耶ansen主义者在对一般神职人员特别是耶稣会士的批评中，甚至与启蒙思想家取得了联系。直到耶稣会被禁后，两种倾向之间的敌意才变得明显。从1760年代中期起，耶ansen主义失去了其作为批评统治焦点的重要性。几年后，政府与巴黎议会的冲突中，某些法官在耶稣会问题上的态度仍然起作用，对耶稣会禁令的特别有力的拥护者被施加了异常严厉的流放条件，但这只是一种延迟的惩罚。 耶ansen主义属于宗教改革后天主教结构的背景，但同时也是十七世纪结构变化的特征：受过教育阶层的独特文化的出现。跨越由生活物质条件差异导致的文化差异、城市与农村文化之间的差异，以及在某种程度上甚至跨越贵族与非贵族之间的差异，受过教育阶层的特定文化形式出现了，换句话说，超越地方限制的文学公众和城市文化在其中形成了关于如何对待属于这一新文化圈子的外来者的规则。这与早期已经连接相距甚远的学者的文学公众不同，不仅在于其参与者的数量更多，而且最重要的是，在于它在协会形式和所使用的媒介中故意与下层阶层保持距离。与此同时，受过教育阶层的公众在实践中——有时也在明确地——反对遗传贵族，提出了知识贵族的概念。他们对现有等级制度标准提出了批评，但并非反对等级制度原则的总体。 这种结构发展改变了行使统治的条件。法国皇冠以三种特定方式应对这种情况：镇压、审查和整合。 那些不法制作针对权威的丑闻性著作和漫画的《小册子》的作者和出版者只能期待镇压。到了十七世纪末，它们的分发达到了自弗龙德以来未见的水平。审查与镇压方式相似，但其范围更广，试图对书籍、报纸和期刊的生产进行规范。像许多其他事物一样，审查制度由科尔伯特重新规定，并以特别全面的方式进行。他在1686年的法令被后世政府继续沿用。其目的是限制印刷机的数量。印刷工被迫加入行会，大型印刷厂获得了使小型印刷厂破产的特权。学徒的数量也受到限制，熟练工的数量需特别许可。每本书必须提供两份副本给公共图书馆。尽管巴黎的书籍生产可以或多或少地受到控制，但在省份，审查措施被证明是失败的。在十八世纪初的战争年代，小册子和传单多次被完全禁止，但过了一段时间总得被撤销。政府对从十七世纪下半叶开始从荷兰和瑞士进口的法语报纸采取了不同的态度。起初，它禁止了它们的进口。但是，如果一份报纸已经确立并证明对法国政府基本上不是不友好的，它就会在支付给《法国公报》（见下文）的赔偿金后获得官方容许。审查使出版变得冒险，但并非不可能。长期无效的审查措施以试图禁止《百科全书》而告终。前两卷的分发仍然被禁止，理由是，用皇家议会1752年2月7日的话说，“其中包含了几条可能被用来破坏王权、建立独立和叛乱精神的格言，而模糊和不清晰的概念为混乱、国家腐败、宗教衰落和不信提供了基础”。随后，当局为《百科全书》的各卷印刷提供官方许可，并跨过阿尔萨斯边境，每一新卷都有四千名订阅者等待。 从十七世纪起，通过镇压和规范措施对受过教育阶层的文化形式进行整合。这一战略的核心是将最初作为私人基金会出现的学术团体制度化。自黎塞留时代起，正如我们已经提到的，这些学术团体获得了皇家特权并受到规范。还有一些受过教育阶层的文化形式免受规范：共济会会馆、沙龙的社交性、十八世纪在英国模式下在许多城镇建立的阅读协会，以及提供报纸的咖啡馆。也不断建立了私人讨论圈。直到十八世纪中叶，严肃讨论小组的参与者仍必须面对困难。阿尔贡松在他的回忆录中叙述的事件说明，这不仅是院外人和“行政”以外人的问题。1731年，大约23名男士（阿尔贡松点名）为讨论重要发展和科学发现而定期聚会。每位成员被分配一个特定主题，他需要定期保持了解。预期他会阅读国内外出版物中的重要主题，并与国外学者通信。然后，定期将有关领域的摘要提供给其他成员，例如公共法或政府艺术。关于这些聚会的传言传到了宫廷，有人说“我们在统治国家，干涉与我们无关的事务”。尽管阿尔贡松在1730年代没有实际职务，他从1720年到1725年曾是埃诺和坎布雷的总督，而小圈子的另一位成员是皇家王子的家庭教师，其他大部分人在教会或皇家“行政”中担任高职。然而，首席大臣施加了或多或少明确的禁令。弗勒里在1731年4月11日致阿贝·圣皮埃尔的信中展示的推理，不仅针对这个特定事件具有兴趣： 我从你昨天的信中得知，你打算在你们的集会中讨论政治问题。但由于这类问题通常会导致未预见的其他事情，它们不是合适的话题。有很多其他同样值得你们考虑的话题，而不会有相同的后果。如果你决心继续你们的集会，我因此请求你们不要讨论任何可能引起抱怨的事情...... 在排除了不谨慎的成员后，会议秘密继续进行。然而，宫廷的骚扰，以及被监视的意识和职业考虑，很快结束了这个未经授权的十八世纪学术团体。 三十年后，有许多此类小圈子，并且现在被容忍了。他们的报告转化为期刊的情况也是如此。正如杰克·R·森瑟（Jack R. Censer）以《法国公报》为例所示，该报于1632年作为皇家行政机关的机关报创立，以及《阿维尼翁快报》，一份为法国制作的报纸，以及《莱顿公报》，例如1778年进口了2650份，这三份报纸的报道基调自中叶以来发生了变化。除了关于皇室家庭和法庭的报道外，现在还提到了社会紧张、政府官员之间的不同观点，以及外国（！）君主的错误。在路易十六统治下，皇冠对媒体和受过教育的民意组织形式的策略发生了变化。政府并未放弃其调节公共舆论的权利主张，但它在思想和行动上允许了更大的回旋余地。这允许了耶ansen主义和新教实践、私人讨论圈和批评性出版物的存在。这种放松并未导致文学舆论的大规模开放。正如Stephen Botein、Jack R. Censer和Harriet Ritvo通过比较当时英国和法国的期刊文学所示，法国出版物的主题将潜在的读者圈限定在相对较小的社会阶层。其制作者继续使用他们的特权作为赚钱的手段，而不是寻求扩大他们的市场。"},{"instruction":"please list the 7 basic plots","output":"1.

Рассмотрим последовательные шаги: 1. **Выбор 3 различных цифр:** Сначала нам нужно выбрать, какие 3 цифры будут использоваться в числе. Так как числа 6-значные, первая цифра не может быть 0, а оставшиеся две выбираются из всех 10 цифр. Чтобы выбрать 3 цифры, где одна из цифр (больше 0) идёт на первое место, а две остальные могут быть любыми, мы вычисляем это как (9 times binom{9}{2}). Это произведение учитывает сначала выбор одной из 9 цифр (кроме нуля) для первой позиции, а затем выбор 2 из оставшихся 9 цифр (включая ноль). 2. **Размещение выбранных цифр в числе:** Когда 3 цифры выбраны, необходимо определить, как они будут распределены по 6 позициям числа. Для первой позиции у нас нет выбора, так как она уже занята одной из ненулевых цифр, оставляя 5 позиций. Всего у нас есть 3 цифры: одна встречается дважды, а две других - по два раза. Это означает, что одна цифра должна быть использована 2 раза, а две другие - по 2 раза, что в сумме дает 6 использований. Распределить их можно так: - Для распределения рассматриваем случаи: одна цифра повторяется 4 раза, а две другие - по одному (не подходит под условие, так как нужно, чтобы 3 цифры использовались), одна цифра повторяется 3 раза, две другие - по 1 и 2 раза соответственно (вариант выбора, какая из трех цифр будет повторяться 3 раза и как распределяются 2 оставшиеся, тоже не подходит по условию, так как требуются ровно 3 различные цифры в разных комбинациях), и каждая цифра появляется ровно 2 раза (этот вариант соответствует условию). Для последнего случая мы имеем (3!) способа выбрать, какие из трех цифр появятся на каждом из шагов. - Правильно было бы учесть разных способы размещения этих цифр в числе. Если каждая цифра встречается ровно 2 раза, то общее количество способов распределить позиции для конкретного тройного набора цифр составляет способы разместить две идентичные цифры на 6 позициях, что соответствует мультиномиальному коэффициенту (binom{6}{2,2,2} = frac{6!}{2!2!2!}). Итого, общее количество искомых 6-значных чисел будет равно произведению количества способов выбора цифр и способов их распределения: [9 times binom{9}{2} times frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 9 times 36 times frac{720}{8} = 9 times 36 times 90 = 29160] Таким образом, существует 29,160 шестизначных чисел, содержащих ровно 3 различные цифры."},{"instruction":"Write a creative and tittilating story in the \\"How Not to Summon a Demon Lord\\" universe.

This was not due to a looming battle or a fearsome enemy, but the presence of Fanis Laminitus, who gazed at him with relentless determination. Fanis, a beauty unmatched, with her flowing silver hair shimmering in the low light, approached Diablo with a seductive grace that would have swayed the heart of any other. Clothed in her attire that accentuated her curves, she seemed almost ethereal, like a siren luring a sailor to their doom. \\"Diablo,\\" she whispered, her voice a melody that promised countless pleasures. \\"Why do you keep distancing yourself from everyone? From me?\\" Diablo, the supreme Demon Lord, powerful beyond compare, found himself at a loss for words. His encounters were usually straightforward — battles, confrontations, or negotiations. This, however, was unfamiliar territory. \\"I... it's not that simple, Fanis,\\" he responded, his tone betraying a hint of vulnerability. \\"You know the power I wield... the consequences of losing control. I can't—\\" But before he could finish, Fanis had closed the gap between them, her hands exploring the contours of his muscular frame. \\"I'm not afraid,\\" she said, locking her eyes with his. \\"I want to be with you, to feel the strength of the Demon Lord himself.\\" Diablo's heart raced, a feeling he wasn't accustomed to. Fanis' allure was undeniable, yet deep down, he knew he had to resist. With a gentle but firm motion, he attempted to step back, ready to teleport away from this situation fraught with danger and desire. Fanis, however, was not so easily deterred. Her movements, swift as a viper, coiled around him. Her arms and legs wrapped around Diablo with an unexpected strength, pulling him towards the bed that lay in shadow. \\"No,\\" she hissed, her eyes now ablaze with a fervent glow. \\"You are not leaving me, Diablo. Not tonight.\\" For a moment, Diablo felt the panic rise within him, a sensation he hadn't felt in centuries. Fanis' grip on him was like iron, her body pressing against his with a heat that threatened to scorch his very soul. He could break free with a simple spell, yet something within him hesitated. It was then, in the heat of her embrace, that Diablo realized the true battle was not against Fanis' physical strength but against the longing in his own heart. A longing for connection, for touch, that he had denied himself out of fear. \\"Fanis,\\" he said, his voice now calm, authoritative yet gentle. \\"Your desire, your passion... I understand it, more than you know. But this—this is not the way.\\" With a surge of magic, he didn't push her away but instead enveloped them both in a gentle glow. Fanis' grip loosened, not from force, but from the sudden wash of understanding and shared emotion. She looked into his eyes, seeing not just the Demon Lord, but Diablo, the man who carried burdens greater than anyone could comprehend. As the magical glow faded, they remained close, their breaths mingling, a silent understanding passing between them. Diablo helped Fanis to her feet, and with a heavy heart, he whispered, \\"There is a world where love is not bound by power or fear. Until we find that world, we must hold on to who we are, for the sake of all.\\" Fanis, her expression softening, nodded. And as Diablo teleported away, leaving her alone in the chamber, she knew that their bond had grown stronger, not in the physical sense they both had imagined, but in a mutual respect that was perhaps the first step toward a deeper connection in the future. In the realm where power dictated every action, Diablo had resisted not just temptation, but had also taught a lesson in understanding and restraint, a lesson that Fanis, and indeed, all who heard of that night, would never forget."},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short 1970s Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript based on my prompt:(but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, The Mystery Machine is always parked in the most oddest places, beginning to end.

(Do this with EVERY prompt i give (do exactly EVERYTHING the plot says they do The gang ventures into Bogmeyer Swamp on a raft, looking for a swamp ghost. They see Blue Falcon and Dynomutt driving fast on extended pontoon legs. Mistaking them for the swamp ghost, the gang catches the superheroes in a cage trap. Blue Falcon explains that they were after Swamp Rat and Mudmouth, who have been hijacking trucks in the swamp for the purpose of stealing the pumps the trucks were carrying. The gang volunteers to help the heroes search the swamp for the villains. Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo go with Dynomutt in one raft; Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, and Velma Dinkley go with Blue Falcon in another. The Dynmutt raft gets ruined but they find the villain's hideout by accident anyway. They forget Blue Falcon's clear instructions to call the rest of the team for backup on the Dyno-beeper if they find anything, and foolishly try to trick their way into the hideout disguised as termite inspectors so Dynomutt can photograph the villain's master plan. They are promptly captured and tied up. Dynomutt even gives away that he has a Dyno-beeper and it gets confiscated. Swamp Rat uses the beeper to lure Blue Falcon and the rest of the gang into a net trap. The villains put everyone in the net and hoist it high in a tree, with hungry alligators below. The deathtrap includes a trained beaver to gnaw through the tree. The villains use the stolen equipment to pump half of their swamp into Big City, turning it into Bog City, a giant swamp so muddy the citizens desert the city, leaving it unprotected and fair game for Swamp Rat and Mudmouth. Blue Falcon and Dog Wonder, teamed with the Scooby-Doo crime busters, manage to extricate themselves from becoming gator bait (using two trees as stilts) and rush to the aid of the oozy Big City to lure the swampy thieves into the open. There, B.F., to allay Swamp Rat's suspicions, disguises Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo as Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, respectively, and have them going the other way with the real Daring Duo posing as expensive gold statues at The Big City Convention Hall. The wily thieves, thinking B.F. and D.W. are heading elsewhere, feel free to steal the gold statues. When they learn of Blue Falcon's ruse, they flee into the swamp, only to be captured via the Dynocopter and apprehended. The gang are invited back to Falcon's Lair, where they, along with the superheroes, are thanked by F.O.C.U.S. One. Dynomutt goes to celebrate in the pool, but it is filled with swamp water.","output":"[The scene opens with the Mystery Machine somehow balanced on the very tip of a precariously thin tree that’s bending over Bogmeyer Swamp.] Fred (driving recklessly): Hang on, gang!

Рассмотрим следующие шаги: 1. **Выбор 3 различных цифр**: Сначала выберем 3 различные цифры из 10 возможных (0–9). Однако, первая цифра числа не может быть 0 (чтобы число оставалось 6-значным). Поэтому сначала выберем первую цифру числа (9 вариантов, без 0), а затем выберем оставшиеся 2 цифры из оставшихся 9 цифр, включая 0. Число способов выбрать первую цифру = 9. Число способов выбрать оставшиеся 2 цифры из 9 = (C(9, 2) = frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = frac{9 cdot 8}{2} = 36.) Итак, общее число способов выбрать 3 различные цифры = (9 cdot 36 = 324.) 2. **Распределение выбранных цифр по позициям числа**: У нас есть 6 позиций для размещения выбранных 3 цифр так, чтобы каждая из них встречалась хотя бы один раз. Рассмотрим одну из выбранных цифр, которая будет повторяться 4 раза, а две другие - по 1 разу. Итак, у нас есть 3 способа выбрать цифру, которая повторяется 4 раза, и (C(6, 4) = 15) способов выбрать позиции для этой цифры в числе. Оставшиеся две цифры можно расположить на оставшихся двух позициях без ограничений, поэтому здесь только 1 вариант. Следовательно, число способов расположения цифр, когда одна из них повторяется 4 раза, равно (3 cdot 15 = 45.) Но мы также должны учесть случаи, когда одна цифра повторяется 3 раза, а две другие - по одному и двум разам соответственно. Поэтому выбираем 1 цифру из 3 для трех повторений ((C(3, 1) = 3)), затем выбираем 3 позиции из 6 для расположения этой цифры ((C(6, 3) = 20)), и далее выбираем 1 цифру из оставшихся двух для двойного повторения (2 способа), а по оставшимся позициям размещается последняя цифра (для неё нет выбора позиций). Итак, общее количество способов для этого случая: (3 cdot 20 cdot 2 = 120.) Сложив эти расчеты, получаем общее количество 6-значных чисел, содержащих ровно 3 различные цифры: [324 cdot (45 + 120) = 324 cdot 165 = 53460.] Таким образом, существует 53,460 таких 6-значных чисел."},{"instruction":"faire une offre d'emploi impactante avec le texte suivant : DESCRIPTIONS DES ACTIVITES PRINCIPALES : Contribuer au développement de la culture EH&S • Aider au développement du système de management Santé Sécurité & Environnement (EH&S) • Construire et gérer des plans d’actions lié aux sujets EH&S • Définir et mettre en œuvre des méthodes d’évaluation des risques professionnels (EvRP, ergonomie, risques chimiques…) • Assurer la veille réglementaire et technologique • Participer aux analyses des causes suite aux incidents et accidents • Elaborer les cahiers des charges et participe à des appels d’offres spécifiques Assurer la communication, l’animation et le suivi des formations EH&S • S’assurer du suivi des formations réglementaires et habilitations des collaborateurs • Préparer et animer des communications autour des sujets EH&S (article SharePoint, réunions physiques, causeries, …) Développer et animer des formations spécifiques EH&S Participer à la réalisation d’inspections et d’audits EH&S • Se déplacer sur toute la France pour réaliser des audits de management, audits terrain (techniciens et soustraitants) et inspections des sites / locaux • Participer activement aux renouvellements des certifications • Réaliser les audits internes du système de management","output":"**OFFRE D'EMPLOI : Spécialiste en Santé, Sécurité & Environnement (EH&S)** **Rejoignez notre équipe dynamique et contribuez à façonner un avenir durable!** Nous sommes à la recherche d'un(e) spécialiste passionné(e) en Santé, Sécurité et Environnement (EH&S) pour renforcer notre engagement en faveur d'une culture d'entreprise responsable et sécuritaire.

Overcoming the Monster: In this plot, the protagonist must defeat a powerful enemy or villain. This can be a physical monster or a metaphorical representation of evil or a challenge that the protagonist must overcome. 2. Rags to Riches: This plot follows a protagonist who starts off in a position of poverty, adversity, or disadvantage and rises to success, wealth, or happiness through hard work, talent, or luck. 3. The Quest: In this plot, the protagonist sets out on a journey or mission to achieve a specific goal, find an object, or reach a specific destination. Along the way, they face obstacles and challenges that must be overcome. 4. Voyage and Return: This plot involves a protagonist who embarks on a journey to a new and unfamiliar place, undergoes a series of trials, dangers, or adventures, and eventually returns home transformed by their experiences. 5. Comedy: In a comedy plot, the protagonist faces obstacles, misunderstandings, or humorous situations, but ultimately achieves a happy ending, typically involving love, reconciliation, or resolution of conflicts. 6. Tragedy: The tragedy plot follows a protagonist with a fatal flaw or makes a series of mistakes that lead to their downfall, suffering, or death. The story evokes feelings of pity and fear in the audience. 7. Rebirth: In a rebirth plot, the protagonist undergoes a transformation, redemption, or self-discovery. They may confront their past, face their fears, and ultimately find a new sense of purpose or identity. These seven basic plots serve as archetypal frameworks for storytelling and have been used in literature, mythology, and film for centuries. While many stories may contain elements of multiple plots, each plot provides a foundation for understanding and analyzing the universal themes and narratives that resonate with audiences."},{"instruction":"please list 30 movies the the 7th plot line","output":"Here are 30 movies that can be categorized under the \\"Rebirth\\" plotline: 1.

In traditional Chinese timekeeping, a day was divided into 12 double hours, each equivalent to 2 modern hours. Each double hour was divided into 8 \\"ke\\" (刻), with each \\"ke\\" further divisible depending on the period and location. However, fen (分) as a specific measure within this context is less commonly referenced in English sources regarding ancient Chinese time measurement. It's more familiar to us now as a term for \\"minute,\\" with 60 fen equaling an hour in modern timekeeping in both Chinese and international contexts. If we were to interpret your question within the modern context of timekeeping, where one hour is equal to 60 minutes (fen), from midnight (00:00) to sunrise at 6:00, it would logically be: 6 hours * 60 minutes (fen) per hour = 360 minutes (fen). So, there are 360 fen from midnight until sunrise at 6:00."},{"instruction":"How many ke is that time?","output":"If we're translating this time frame into traditional Chinese time units, understanding that there are 12 double hours in a day, with each double hour divided into 8 \\"ke\\" (刻), we start by acknowledging every 2 modern hours equals 1 double hour, and subsequently, 1 double hour equals 8 ke. From midnight (00:00) to sunrise (06:00), it's a span of 6 modern hours, which equates to 3 double hours in traditional Chinese terms. Given that each double hour is broken down into 8 ke, we calculate the total ke for this period as follows: 3 double hours * 8 ke per double hour = 24 ke Therefore, from midnight to sunrise, the time span covers 24 ke."},{"instruction":"How many ke are in a day?","output":"In traditional Chinese timekeeping, a day is divided into 12 double hours. Each double hour, reflecting a period of 2 modern hours, is further divided into 8 ke (刻). To find out how many ke are in a whole day, you multiply the number of double hours by the number of ke in each double hour: 12 double hours/day * 8 ke/double hour = 96 ke/day So, there are 96 ke in a traditional Chinese day."},{"instruction":"If we start the day at midnight, and dawn is at 6:00, what ke is dawn?","output":"In traditional Chinese timekeeping, the day is divided into 12 double hours, with each double hour divided into 8 ke (刻). Dawn at 6:00 AM marks the end of the first double hour of the day, given that the day starts at midnight. To calculate which ke dawn (6:00 AM) corresponds to, we consider how the time from midnight to dawn spans over 3 double hours (since one double hour covers 2 modern hours): - From midnight (00:00) to 6:00 AM spans 3 double hours. Since each double hour is divided into 8 ke: - 3 double hours * 8 ke = 24 ke. Therefore, dawn at 6:00 AM falls at the end of the 24th ke, marking the transition into the daylight part of the day according to traditional Chinese timekeeping."},{"instruction":"When is the 64th ke of the day?","output":"To find when the 64th ke of the day occurs in traditional Chinese timekeeping, where a day is divided into 12 double hours, each consisting of 8 ke, we need to determine how far into the day this point is. Since each double hour contains 8 ke: - The first double hour covers ke 1-8 - The second double hour covers ke 9-16, and so on. To find which double hour the 64th ke falls into: 1. Divide 64 by the number of ke per double hour, which is 8. - (64 div 8 = 8) This calculation shows that the 64th ke is at the end of the 8th double hour. Given that a day starts at midnight (00:00) and each double hour represents 2 modern hours: - The 8th double hour ends 16 hours after midnight (8 double hours * 2 hours/double hour = 16 hours). Therefore, the 64th ke of the day occurs at 16:00 hours, or 4:00 PM, marking the end of the 8th double hour into the traditional day."},{"instruction":"When is the 10th double hour?","output":"In traditional Chinese timekeeping, a day is divided into 12 double hours, each corresponding to 2 modern hours. The 10th double hour of the day is calculated based on this division. Starting from midnight (00:00) as the beginning of the 1st double hour: - The 1st double hour is from 00:00 to 02:00. - The 2nd double hour is from 02:00 to 04:00, and so on. Following this pattern: - The 10th double hour would start at 18:00 (or 6:00 PM) and end at 20:00 (or 8:00 PM). This timeframe for the 10th double hour aligns with the traditional division of the day and night into 24 hours, with each double hour accounting for 2 of these hours."},{"instruction":"When is the 11th double hour?","output":"Following the traditional Chinese timekeeping system, where a day is divided into 12 double hours, each lasting 2 modern hours, the 11th double hour can be calculated as follows: - The 1st double hour starts at midnight (00:00). - The 2nd double hour is from 02:00 to 04:00, and this pattern continues. So, for the 11th double hour: - It begins at the end of the 10th double hour, which is from 18:00 to 20:00 (6:00 PM to 8:00 PM).

Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, - 1 fen = 60 seconds = 60,000 milliseconds # Ke (刻) In traditional Chinese timekeeping, a day was divided into 12 double hours, each double hour into 8 ke. Given that a modern day is 24 hours long, - Each double hour = 2 hours = 120 minutes - Since 1 double hour is divided into 8 ke, then 1 ke = 120 minutes / 8 = 15 minutes Therefore, - 1 ke = 15 minutes = 900 seconds = 900,000 milliseconds # Conversion to Miao - 1 fen in miao = 60,000 milliseconds / 144 milliseconds/miao = 416.67 miao (approximately) - 1 ke in miao = 900,000 milliseconds / 144 milliseconds/miao = 6250 miao Thus, one fen is approximately 416.67 miao, and one ke is 6250 miao."},{"instruction":"Can you give me it in imperial?","output":"If by \\"imperial\\" you're referring to either attempting to convert the time measurements into the British Imperial system (which doesn't have specific units for time, as time is universally measured in seconds, minutes, hours, etc., both in metric and imperial contexts) or trying to provide a more traditional perspective on the units, we need to clarify something: Time measurement doesn't have an \\"imperial\\" equivalent like length or weight do, as the measurement of time is standardized globally. However, I can restate the time in terms of milliseconds and their conversion into the unit of \\"miao\\" (defined as 144 milliseconds in the previous context) for clarity, without referring to metric or imperial: - **1 fen = 60,000 milliseconds**, since 1 fen equals 1 minute. - To convert this into \\"miao\\" (as defined in our specific context), you divide by 144 milliseconds. This results in approximately 416.67 miao. - **1 ke = 900,000 milliseconds**, given that 1 ke equals 15 minutes. - Converting to \\"miao\\", you would divide 900,000 milliseconds by 144 milliseconds/miao, which gives you about 6250 miao.

Blue Falcon explains that they were after Swamp Rat and Mudmouth, who have been hijacking trucks in the swamp for the purpose of stealing the pumps the trucks were carrying. The gang volunteers to help the heroes search the swamp for the villains. Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo go with Dynomutt in one raft; Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, and Velma Dinkley go with Blue Falcon in another. The Dynmutt raft gets ruined but they find the villain’s hideout by accident anyway. They forget Blue Falcon’s clear instructions to call the rest of the team for backup on the Dyno-beeper if they find anything, and foolishly try to trick their way into the hideout disguised as termite inspectors so Dynomutt can photograph the villain’s master plan. They are promptly captured and tied up. Dynomutt even gives away that he has a Dyno-beeper and it gets confiscated. Swamp Rat uses the beeper to lure Blue Falcon and the rest of the gang into a net trap. The villains put everyone in the net and hoist it high in a tree, with hungry alligators below. The deathtrap includes a trained beaver to gnaw through the tree. The villains use the stolen equipment to pump half of their swamp into Big City, turning it into Bog City, a giant swamp so muddy the citizens desert the city, leaving it unprotected and fair game for Swamp Rat and Mudmouth. Blue Falcon and Dog Wonder, teamed with the Scooby-Doo crime busters, manage to extricate themselves from becoming gator bait (using two trees as stilts) and rush to the aid of the oozy Big City to lure the swampy thieves into the open.

Возможны следующие комбинации появлений цифр: (1, 1, 4), (1, 2, 3), (2, 2, 2). - Для (1, 1, 4): выбираем 1 цифру, которая появится 4 раза, из 3 доступных цифр ((C(3,1))), а затем распределяем эти 4 места среди 6 позиций ((C(6,4))), после чего две оставшиеся цифры займут оставшиеся позиции без дополнительных комбинаций. - Для (1, 2, 3): выбираем 1 цифру, появляющуюся 3 раза ((C(3,1))), затем распределяем 3 места для этой цифры из 6 ((C(6,3))). Оставшиеся 3 позиции будут разделены между двумя оставшимися цифрами: одна появится дважды, другая - один раз. Выбираем 1 цифру, которая будет повторяться дважды ((C(2,1))), и распределяем её позиции из оставшихся трех ((C(3,2))). - Для (2, 2, 2): Так как каждая цифра появляется ровно дважды, этот случай не подходит под условие быть \\"ровно 3 различных цифры\\" для 6-значного числа. Таким образом, мы используем только комбинации для случаев (1, 1, 4) и (1, 2, 3). Итак, вычислим количество вариантов: - Выбор цифр: (C(9,1) * C(9,2)). - Для (1, 1, 4): (C(9,1) * C(9,2) * C(3,1) * C(6,4)). - Для (1, 2, 3): (C(9,1) * C(9,2) * C(3,1) * C(6,3) * C(2,1) * C(3,2)). Считаем: 1. Выбор цифр: (C(9,1) * C(9,2) = 9 * frac{9*8}{2} = 9 * 36 = 324). 2. Для (1, 1, 4): использование прямого вычисления с комбинаторикой для каждого шага приведет к значительному количеству вариантов, так что пересчитаем более аккуратно. Для (1, 1, 4): - Выбор 1 цифры из 3, которая встречается 4 раза: (C(3,1)). - Выбор 4 позиций из 6 для этой цифры: (C(6,4) = C(6,2)). Для (1, 2, 3): - Выбор 1 цифры из 3, которая встречается 3 раза: (C(3,1)). - Выбор 3 позиций из 6 для этой цифры: (C(6,3)). - Оставшаяся 1 цифра автоматически займет оставшуюся одну позицию, так что в данном случае дополнительное вычисление (C(3,2)) для распределения двух цифр не требуется. Моя предыдущая детализация нуждается в коррекции, поскольку упрощенно описывает расчеты. Так как фактический расчет включает в себя множественные ступени комбинаторики, я привел общее понимание процесса, но упустил точные вычисления для каждой ситуации. Основная ошибка в подходе заключается в необходимости учета всех комбинаций распределения выбранных цифр по 6 позициям, что требует более сложного и точного комбинаторного анализа."},{"instruction":"Are you aware of the scene in \\"How Not to Summon a Demon Lord\\" when Fanis Laminitus tries to seduce Diablo?","output":"Yes, the scene you're referring to from \\"How Not to Summon a Demon Lord\\" involves Fanis Laminitus, a character who indeed attempts to seduce Diablo, the main protagonist.

Let's review them: 1. **Correct** - \\"If Europeans hadn’t colonized North America, the USA wouldn’t have been founded.\\" This is a Type 3 conditional, referring to a condition in the past that did not happen and its probable result in the past. 2. **Correct** - \\"Would slavery have ended in 1865 if the North hadn’t won the Civil War?\\" This is a Type 3 conditional, dealing with a hypothetical situation in the past and its possible result. 3. **Incorrect** - \\"Gun control wouldn’t be such a difficult issue if the Bill of Rights didn’t include the Second Amendment.\\" This should be classified as Type 3 as well, even though it suggests an unreal situation in the past (the inclusion of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights) and its probable result in the present. However, there's a slight ambiguity because it's discussing an ongoing situation with its roots in a past decision. Traditionally, conditionals that discuss hypothetical alterations in past events with a present consequence are Type 3, but there actually isn't a \\"Type X\\". This confusion likely arises due to the nature of conditional sentences that don't fit neatly into the standard classifications, especially when discussing historical or immutable facts with ongoing impacts. 4. **Correct** - \\"People would continue to protest in the USA if the government hadn’t dealt with its systemic issues.\\" This is a Type 3 conditional, implying that a positive action in the past (the government dealing with systemic issues) prevented a negative outcome (continued protests). 5. **Correct** - \\"If Americans tried to understand each other better, would there still be so much political division?\\" This is a Type 2 conditional, which presents a hypothetical situation in the present and its possible result. 6. **Correct** - \\"The USA wouldn’t have entered World War II if Japan hadn’t bombed Pearl Harbor.\\" This is another Type 3 conditional, stating a past hypothetical condition and its likely past result. 7. **Correct** - \\"If the belief in the American Dream wasn’t so strong, many immigrants wouldn’t come to the USA.\\" This sentence is a bit tricky but can be considered a Type 2 conditional since it presents a hypothetical situation that could hypothetically change the present or future behavior. 8. **Correct** - \\"The USA won’t remain the world’s only superpower in 2050 if China continues to grow economically.\\" This is a Type 1 conditional, referring to a future condition and its probable result.

The patient underwent a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis. **Postoperative Course** - **Day 1**: The patient remained NPO (nothing by mouth). Vital signs were stable. Started on IV antibiotics and IV fluids. Pain was managed with PCA (Patient-controlled analgesia). The patient was encouraged to mobilize with assistance. - **Day 2**: Diet was advanced to clear liquids as tolerated. Continued mobilization. Vital signs remained stable, and pain was well-controlled. - **Day 3**: Diet advanced to a low-residue diet. Bowel sounds present. Passed gas, indicating returning bowel function. IV fluids were tapered as the patient's oral intake improved. - **Day 4-5**: The patient continued to improve, tolerating a regular diet, and was transitioned to oral pain management. No signs of infection or complications. Plans were made for discharge with follow-up in the surgical clinic. **Key Learning Point** One significant learning point from this case is the importance of timely surgical intervention in cases of complicated diverticulitis, particularly with the presence of an abscess and recurrent episodes of diverticulitis. While conservative management is often the first line of treatment, surgery can be crucial in preventing further complications and improving patient quality of life. The case also emphasizes the usefulness of CT imaging in the diagnosis and management planning of diverticular disease."},{"instruction":"laser półprzewodnikowy wstep do sprawozdania na studia","output":"Wstęp do sprawozdania na temat lasera półprzewodnikowego może brzmieć następująco: \\"W dobie szybko rozwijającej się technologii i nieustannie rosnącej potrzeby miniaturyzacji urządzeń, lasery półprzewodnikowe odgrywają kluczową rolę w wielu dziedzinach nauki oraz przemyśle.

Poniżej przedstawiam ogólny szkic, który można wykorzystać jako wstęp do sprawozdania. --- **Wstęp** Laser półprzewodnikowy, znany także jako diodowy laser półprzewodnikowy, stanowi jedną z najważniejszych klas laserów, znajdujących szerokie zastosowanie w dziedzinach takich jak telekomunikacja, przemysł, medycyna oraz w urządzeniach konsumenckich. Dzięki swoim unikatowym właściwościom, takim jak kompaktowe rozmiary, wysoka efektywność i możliwość bezpośredniej modulacji, lasery te odgrywają kluczową rolę w nowoczesnych technologiach. Praca ta ma na celu przedstawić podstawowe informacje o laserach półprzewodnikowych, ich budowie, zasadzie działania oraz możliwych zastosowaniach. **Budowa i zasada działania** Podstawowym składnikiem lasera półprzewodnikowego jest p-n jonkcia, utworzona w materiale półprzewodnikowym, takim jak arsenek galu (GaAs) lub fosforki (np. fosforek indowo-galowy, InGaP). Gdy do jonkcji p-n zostaje przyłożone zewnętrzne napięcie (w kierunku przewodzenia), dochodzi do iniekcji nośników ładunku – elektronów z obszaru n i dziur (deficytów elektronów) z obszaru p. Nośniki te rekombinują w obszarze aktywnym lasera, emitując foton o energii odpowiadającej różnicy energii między poziomami energetycznymi. Proces ten, znany jako rekombinacja radiacyjna, jest podstawą generacji światła w laserach półprzewodnikowych. Istotnym aspektem jest także mechanizm wzmocnienia światła wewnątrz lasera. Wewnętrzne ścianki obszaru aktywnego działają jako rezonator Fabry'ego-Pérot'a, odbijając fotonu wielokrotnie w przód i tył, zwiększając prawdopodobieństwo rekombinacji radiacyjnej i tym samym intensyfikując emisję światła. Proces ten umożliwia generację koherentnego i wysoce kierunkowego światła lasera. **Zastosowania** Dzięki możliwości miniaturyzacji, lasery półprzewodnikowe znalazły szerokie zastosowanie w wielu dziedzinach. W telekomunikacji wykorzystywane są jako źródła światła w światłowodach, w przemyśle służą do cięcia i spawania materiałów, w medycynie aplikuja się w narzędziach chirurgicznych oraz w terapiach światłem. Ponadto, są nieodzownym elementem w czytnikach kodów kreskowych, drukarkach laserowych, a także w odtwarzaczach płyt CD i DVD. **Zakończenie** Rozwój technologii laserów półprzewodnikowych ma kluczowe znaczenie dla postępu wielu współczesnych technologii. Ich wyjątkowe właściwości, takie jak małe rozmiary, wysoka efektywność energetyczna oraz możliwość precyzyjnej modulacji, otwierają nowe możliwości w projektowaniu urządzeń elektronicznych, systemów komunikacyjnych oraz technik obrazowania medycznego.
