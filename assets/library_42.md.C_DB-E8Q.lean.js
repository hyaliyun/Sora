Since these numbers should not contain a prohibited digit, the only valid single-digit number divisible by 4 is 4. 3. **Two-digit numbers case**:     - Construct two-digit numbers using only the allowed digits (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).     - Use the divisibility rule for 4, which states that a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number divisible by 4.     - By trial, the valid two-digit combinations are: 12, 24, 32, 44, and 52. All these numbers are divisible by 4.     Thus, we have five two-digit numbers: {12, 24, 32, 44, 52}. 4. **Three-digit numbers case**:     - We start by selecting each of the two-digit numbers (12, 24, 32, 44, 52).     - We prepend each of these two-digit numbers with each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (valid digits defined), to get a three-digit number.     - The new three-digit numbers are guaranteed to be divisible by 4 since the last two digits remain divisible by 4 and the preliminary conditions are met.     - By performing this, we get the following list:       begin{itemize}         item From 12: 112, 212, 312, 412, 512         item From 24: 124, 224, 324, 424, 524         item From 32: 132, 232, 332, 432, 532         item From 44: 144, 244, 344, 444, 544         item From 52: 152, 252, 352, 452, 552       end{itemize}     Thus, there are (5 times 5 = 25) valid three-digit numbers. 5. **Sum of all valid numbers**:    - 1 single-digit number: 4.    - 5 two-digit numbers: 12, 24, 32, 44, 52.    - 25 three-digit numbers as calculated in the previous step.

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a set (M = {C_1, C_2, dots, C_{k+1}}) such that each (C_i) has lost to at least (5) teams among (M - {C_i}). 4. **Application of Induction Hypothesis:**    By our induction hypothesis, in any subset of (k) teams, there is one team which has lost to no more than (4) of the remaining (k-1) teams. Let (C_j) be such a team in the subset (M - {C_i}).

Testing for the middle number 13: [ (x-4)(x-2)x(x+2)(x+4) = (13 - 4)(13 - 2)(13)(13 + 2)(13 + 4) = 9 times 11 times 13 times 15 times 17 = 110,895 ] This calculation is correct; hence, the sequence of numbers is (9, 11, 13, 15, 17).

The oddness of each term depends on the oddness of its binomial coefficient, since the product of odd numbers is always odd. The binomial coefficients are calculated as follows: - binom{6}{0} = 1 and binom{6}{6} = 1 are both odd. - binom{6}{1} = 6 and binom{6}{5} = 6 are both even. - binom{6}{2} = 15 and binom{6}{4} = 15 are both odd. - binom{6}{3} = 20 is even. Therefore, the terms with binomial coefficients binom{6}{0}, binom{6}{2}, binom{6}{4}, and binom{6}{6} are odd, because these coefficients are odd, and the product of odd numbers (including these coefficients, m, and n) remains odd.

Let the number of villains in the i-th row and the j-th column be denoted as r(i) and c(j), respectively. 2. The problem states that the condition is equivalent to: if c(j) > r(i), the resident in cell (i,j) is a knight; otherwise, the resident is a villain. 3. First, we need to prove that c(j) must be equal for any two columns.    * Suppose columns j_1 and j_2 satisfy c(j_2) > c(j_1).     * If there is a knight in cell (i, j_1), then c(j_1) > r(i) implies c(j_2) > r(i).    * Thus, there is also a knight in cell (i, j_2). This implies that the number of knights in column j_2 is at least the number of knights in column j_1, which contradicts c(j_2) > c(j_1). 4. Now, let's demonstrate that all residents in the same row are either all knights or all villains (this type of arrangement is referred to as a \\"stripe arrangement\\").    * Consider the residents in the i-th row.     * Because r(i) depends only on i, whether a resident in cell (i, j) is a knight or a villain is determined solely by c(j).    * Given that c(j) is the same for any two columns, we infer that all residents in the i-th row are either all knights or all villains. 5. Finally, let's verify that a stripe arrangement satisfies the conditions.    * If there is at least one row of villains, then the number of villains in each column containing a villain is at most 8 (villains lie). The number of villains in every row with knights is indeed greater than 0 (knights tell the truth).    * If any row has no villains at all, then every resident in that row is a knight. Thus, the number of villains in every column of the knights is 0, which contradicts the knights telling the truth because the required condition is that the number of villains in the column > the number in the row which is 0. 6. Therefore, the number of valid stripe arrangements that satisfy the condition can be computed as follows:    * Each row can be either entirely knights or entirely villains.    * There are 2^8 = 256 possible configurations for the rows, but the configuration where all rows are knights does not satisfy the given condition. Hence, we subtract 1 from the total number.    Therefore, the number of valid stripe arrangements is (2^8 - 1 = 255).

According to Euler’s formula for convex polyhedra:     [     V - E + F = 2     ]     where F = n (given), we need expressions for V and E. 5. **Analyzing Vertices and Edges in the Projection**:     - When projecting on a plane, vertices and edges will combine in a way that will form a polygon. Each face F contributes at least three edges, as the minimum face is a triangle. 6. **Detailed Edge Analysis**:     - Each vertex in a polyhedron typically connects to at least three edges:     [     sum_{text{face } i} text{edges}_i = 2E     ]     Here, text{edges}_i for each face are counted twice since each edge is shared between two faces. From graph theoretic properties and geometric projection, note:     [     sum_{text{face } i} text{edges}_i geq 3n     ]      7. **Calculation of Upper Bound on Sides**:     - The formula used to project and determine the sides implies using contours of faces minimizing cross projections:     - Each face edge contributes to the polygon boundary in the projection, implying that some edges contribute to separating regions. 8. **Upper Bound Conclusion**:     - Summarize from detailed calculations and geometric implications:     [     text{Maximum number of sides in projection} = 2n - 4     ]     9. **Final Answer**:     - The calculations adhere to polyhedral properties and the understanding of how geometrical shapes split and project on the plane keeping edges combined at vertices without overlaps beyond separate planes intersections.

Solving this quadratic equation, we find its roots are x = 3 or x = 1. Since in an isosceles triangle with two sides equal, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the third side, and 1 + 3 > 3 holds, k = 3 is a valid solution. 2. **Case 2: Side length of 3 is the base of the isosceles triangle.** For the isosceles triangle where the base is 3, we use the fact that the discriminant of the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x + k = 0 must be perfect square for the roots to be rational, as the lengths of the sides of a triangle are rational numbers. The discriminant is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a = 1, b = -4, and c = k.

According to the problem, the money is divided into 8 bags, and in each bag, there is an equal number of dollar bills and coins of each denomination (half dollars and quarters). 2. We are given the final goal of trying to rearrange the money into 7 and 6 bags and the number of each type of monetary unit must still be split evenly among the bags. 3. Suppose the total number of dollar bills is x, the total number of half-dollar coins is y, and the total number of quarter-dollar coins is z. 4. Since the money is initially distributed evenly among 8 bags, with each bag containing an equal number of dollar bills, half-dollar coins, and quarter-dollar coins, we can denote the amount in each bag initially. Let each bag has d dollar bills, h half-dollar coins, and q quarter-dollar coins. [ text{Number of dollar bills in each bag initially} = frac{x}{8} = d ] [ text{Number of half-dollar coins in each bag initially} = frac{y}{8} = h ] [ text{Number of quarter-dollar coins in each bag initially} = frac{z}{8} = q ] This implies: [ x = 8d, quad y = 8h, quad z = 8q ] 5. Next, consider rearranging the money into 7 bags: In each of the 7 bags, the number of dollar bills will be: [ frac{x}{7} = frac{8d}{7} ] This value must be an integer, so: [ 8d = 7k, quad text{for some integer } k ] Similarly, the number of half-dollar and quarter-dollar coins in each bag must be integer values: [ 8h = 7m, quad 8q = 7n, quad text{for some integers } m text{ and } n ] 6. Finally, consider the rearrangement into 6 bags: In this case, the number of dollar bills in each bag would be: [ frac{x}{6} = frac{8d}{6} = frac{4d}{3} ] Again, this value must be an integer, so: [ 4d = 3p, quad text{for some integer } p ] Similarly: [ 4h = 3r, quad 4q = 3s, quad text{for some integers } r text{ and } s ] 7. Since 8 is a multiple of 7 and 6, d, h, q must also be multiples of both 7 and 6. Therefore, we seek the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers to find a compatible value.

Thus, each bag should have multiples such that all conditions are satisfied, which when broken down translates correctly: [ d = 21k, quad h = 21m, quad q = 21n quad (text{For some integer k, m, and n}) ] Afterward, we multiply by 8 to convert back: [ x = 168, quad y = 168, quad z = 168 ] 8. Hence, the total amount of money in the bags is: [ x + 0.5y + 0.25z = 168 + 0.5 times 168 + 0.25 times 168 = 168 + 84 + 42 = 294 text{ dollars} ] Thus, the minimum amount saved by the grocer is: [ boxed{294 text{ dollars}} ] This concludes the detailed solution to the problem."},{"instruction":"Let a and b be two noncoincident lines, and alpha and beta be two noncoincident planes.

By splitting one ( A_{i} ) into two sets, we generate a partition ( P_{m+1} ) of ( X ), which consists of ( m+1 ) sets. ( P_{m+1} ) is called a refinement of ( P_{m} ). If  [ P_{1}, P_{2}, cdots, P_{n} ] are partitions of an ( n )element set ( X ), and each is a refinement of the previous one (obviously ( P_{n} ) consists of ( n ) sets, and ( P_{1} ) consists of only one set, ( X )), this sequence is called a chain of length ( n ). Determine the number of chains of length ( n ).","output":"1. **Understanding the Partition and Refinement Process**:     Given a set X with n elements, a partition of X, denoted by P_{m}, is a division of X into m non-empty, disjoint subsets. If we refine one of the subsets A_i in P_{m} by dividing it into two non-empty subsets, we obtain a new partition P_{m+1} with m+1 subsets. This process of creating P_{m+1} from P_{m} by further splitting is called a refinement. 2. **Chain of Partitions**:    We start with a partition P_{1}, which consists of a single subset X itself. By repeatedly refining the partitions, we can construct a chain of partitions:    [    P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{n}    ]    where each partition P_{k+1} is a refinement of P_{k}. Ultimately, P_{n} will consist of n singletons, each containing exactly one element of X. 3. **Reverse Construction**:    Conversely, starting from P_{n} (with n singletons), we can describe the reverse process by merging two distinct subsets at each step to form the previous partition. Thus, from P_{n}, we merge subsets to form P_{n-1}, continue merging subsets to get P_{n-2}, and so on until we reach P_{1}. 4. **Counting the Number of Chains**:    At each step from P_{k+1} to P_{k}, we need to choose 2 subsets out of the k+1 subsets to merge. The number of ways to choose 2 subsets out of k+1 is given by the binomial coefficient:    [    binom{k+1}{2} = frac{(k+1)!}{2!(k-1)!} = frac{(k+1)k}{2}    ] 5. **Product of Choices**:    To find the total number of chains of partitions leading from P_n to P_1, we multiply the number of ways to merge subsets at each step:    [    prod_{k=1}^{n-1} binom{k+1}{2} = prod_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{(k+1)k}{2}    ] 6. **Simplifying the Product**:    We rewrite the product as follows:    [    prod_{k=1}^{n-1} binom{k+1}{2} = prod_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{(k+1)k}{2} = frac{prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (k+1) prod_{k=1}^{n-1} k}{2^{n-1}}    ]    Recognizing that prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (k+1) is the product of the first n-1 terms of a shifted factorial sequence, we get:    [    prod_{k=1}^{n-1} (k+1) = n!    ]    And the product of the first n-1 positive integers is:    [    prod_{k=1}^{n-1} k = (n-1)!    ]    Hence:    [    prod_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{(k+1)k}{2} = frac{n!(n-1)!}{2^{n-1}}    ] # Conclusion: The number of chains of length n for the set X is: [ boxed{frac{n!(n-1)!}{2^{n-1}}} ]"},{"instruction":"f one positive integer is greater than another positive integer by 3, and the difference of their cubes is 63, what is their sum?","output":"Let's call the two positive integers x and y, with x being the larger one.

We need to create an angle of (18^circ) ((frac{54^circ}{3})) and do this exclusively using compass techniques. We should proceed step-by-step. 1. **Setup the Given Angle:**     Start by creating the (54^circ) angle using the given tools. This can typically be achieved by first marking the vertex of the angle and using a protractor to ensure the correct measure:          [     angle AOB = 54^circ      ] 2. **Construct (108^circ) using Angles on a Straight Line:**         Constructing an angle that is a multiple of (54^circ) using geometric properties can help. Note that:         [     2 cdot 54^circ = 108^circ     ]          Place a point (C) such that (angle BOC = 54^circ). Hence, (angle AOD = 2 cdot angle AOB = 108^circ). 3. **Construct a Circle and Mark Points:**     Use the compass to draw a circle with center (O) and an arbitrary radius. Mark the intersection points (P) on the circle such that (overarc{AP} = AO = OP). Each sector cut by the lengths and intersections on the circle will reflect consistent angle properties. The circle divides into known segments helping our constructions. 4. **Mark Division by Using Triangle Properties:**     Draw a radius (OA), another point(Q) where (angle POQ = 108^circ). Subsequently, find ( angle AOQ) as half:          [     frac{2 cdot 54^circ}{2} = 54^circ     ]      5. **Using Compass Dividers to Bisect the Angle:**     Place the compass at (A) to mark an arc across the circle, and do similarly for midpoint intersection. The two intersections form lines on the circle.      6. **Accurate Division to (18^circ)**:     By iteratively placing and intersecting chords or arcs it accurately bisects the (54^circangle) two more equal parts resulting in (18^circ) segments. This follows geometric principle:          [     54^circ div 3 = 18^circ     ]            7. **Verification:**     Ensure the three sub-angles ( angle A_1OB_1 = angle A_2OB_2 = angle A_3OB_3 = 18^circ). # Conclusion: Through the precise use of circles and fixed distance (compass measures), you can accurately trisect (54^circ) angle into (18^circ).

Using the condition that A=B, we have: begin{cases} 3a+1=2a  a^2+1=2 end{cases}, which simplifies to a=-1 because the second equation implies a^2=1 and since we are considering a<frac{1}{3}, a cannot be 1 but must be -1.

We are given that ( s = 1 ) km/h. When the man swims downstream, the effective speed is ( v + s ) because the stream aids his swimming. When he swims upstream, the effective speed is ( v - s ) because the stream opposes his swimming. We are told that it takes him twice as long to swim upstream as it does to swim downstream. This means that the distance he covers upstream in a certain time is half the distance he covers downstream in the same time, because distance is speed multiplied by time. Let's denote the time it takes to swim downstream as ( t ) hours. Then the time it takes to swim upstream is ( 2t ) hours. The distances covered in both cases are the same, so we can set up the following equation: [ (v + s) cdot t = (v - s) cdot 2t ] Since ( s = 1 ) km/h, we can substitute that into the equation: [ (v + 1) cdot t = (v - 1) cdot 2t ] Now we can solve for ( v ): [ v cdot t + t = 2vt - 2t ] [ 2t = 2vt - v cdot t ] [ 2t = t(2v - v) ] [ 2t = t(v) ] Since ( t ) is not zero (because time cannot be zero), we can divide both sides by ( t ): [ 2 = v ] So the man's swimming speed in still water is boxed{2}  km/h."},{"instruction":"A fly is on the edge of a ceiling of a circular room with a radius of 65 feet.

Step 2: Going one step back, we calculate the quantity of tremponchiki before meeting Banna. John gave Banna: [ frac{z}{2} + 0.5 ] Since ( y = 1 ) is what remained after giving to Banna, we can work backwards: [ frac{z}{2} + 0.5 = 1 implies frac{z}{2} = 0.5 implies z = 1 + 1 = 2 ] Therefore, John had 2 tremponchiki before he met Banna.

The derivative of the function is f'(x) = frac{1}{x^2} - frac{1}{x} = frac{1 - x}{x^2}. Let f'(x) > 0, we get 0 < x < 1; let f'(x) < 0, we get x > 1. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on (1, e^2); Since f(1) = 2 - 1 - ln 1 = 1 > 0 and f(e^2) = 2 - frac{1}{e^2} - ln e^2 < 0, according to the intermediate value theorem, f(x) has 1 zero in (1, e^2). (2) Let f'(x) = 0, we get x = 1. When x > 1, f'(x) < 0, the function is decreasing on (1, +infty); when 0 < x < 1, f'(x) > 0, the function is increasing on (0, 1).

In summary, the set of possible values for a is {1}. (3) Proof: First, we prove x_1 + x_2 > 2. According to the problem, we have a = frac{1}{x_1} + ln x_1 = frac{1}{x_2} + ln x_2. Therefore, frac{x_2 - x_1}{x_2 x_1} = ln frac{x_2}{x_1}. Let t = frac{x_2}{x_1} (t > 1), then ln t = frac{t - 1}{t x_1}, so x_1 = frac{t - 1}{t ln t}. Thus, x_1 + x_2 = x_1 (t + 1) = frac{t^2 - 1}{t ln t}. Consider the function g(x) = frac{x^2 - 1}{2x} - ln x (x > 1). Since g'(x) = frac{(x - 1)^2}{2x^2} > 0, g(x) is increasing on (1, +infty). Therefore, when t > 1, g(t) > g(1) = 0, and since ln t > 0, we have x_1 + x_2 > 2. Next, we prove x_1 + x_2 < 3e^{a-1} - 1. Since f(x) = 0 Leftrightarrow h(x) = ax - 1 - x ln x = 0, x_1 and x_2 are also zeros of the function h(x) = 0. From h'(x) = a - 1 - ln x = 0, we get x = e^{a-1} (denote p = e^{a-1}). As proven in (1), p is the unique maximum point of h(x), so we have begin{cases} h(p) > 0  x_1 < p < x_2 end{cases}. Consider the function m(x) = ln x - frac{2(x - p)}{x + p} - ln p. Then m'(x) = frac{(x - p)^2}{x(x + p)^2} geq 0, so m(x) is increasing. When x > p, h(x) > h(p) = 0; when 0 < x < p, h(x) < 0. Thus, ax_1 - 1 = x_1 ln x_1 < frac{2x_1(x_1 - p)}{x_1 + p} + x_1 ln p, which simplifies to (2 + ln p - a) x_1^2 - (2p + ap - p ln p - 1) x_1 + p > 0, i.e., x_1^2 - (3e^{a-1} - 1) x_1 + e^{a-1} > 0. Similarly, we can prove x_2^2 - (3e^{a-1} - 1) x_2 + e^{a-1} < 0. Therefore, x_2^2 - (3e^{a-1} - 1) x_2 + e^{a-1} < x_1^2 - (3e^{a-1} - 1) x_1 + e^{a-1}, which implies (x_2 + x_1)(x_2 - x_1) < (3e^{a-1} - 1)(x_2 - x_1), and hence x_1 + x_2 < 3e^{a-1} - 1.

Case 2: If ( 3(x_0^2 + 1) + 7g(x_0) = 0 ), then:    [    3(x_0^2 + 1) = -7g(x_0) implies x_0^2 + 1 = -frac{7}{3}g(x_0)    ]    Again, ( x_0^2 + 1 ) is not divisible by 7 for any integer ( x_0 ) as shown by residue calculations modulo 7.

What is the new ratio of boarders to day students?","output":"Let's start by finding the original number of day students. We know the original ratio of boarders to day students was 5 to 12, and there were 150 boarders. If we let the number of boarders be represented by 5x and the number of day students be represented by 12x, we can write the following equation based on the original number of boarders: 5x = 150 To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 150 / 5 x = 30 Now we can find the original number of day students by multiplying the value of x by 12: Original day students = 12x Original day students = 12 * 30 Original day students = 360 Now, 30 new boarders joined the school, so the new number of boarders is: New boarders = Original boarders + New boarders New boarders = 150 + 30 New boarders = 180 The new ratio of boarders to day students is therefore: New ratio = New boarders : Original day students New ratio = 180 : 360 To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 180 in this case: New ratio = (180 / 180) : (360 / 180) New ratio = 1 : 2 So the new ratio of boarders to day students is boxed{1}  to 2."},{"instruction":"(a) Given a quadruple (a, b, c, d) of positive reals, transform to the new quadruple (ab, bc, cd, da).

If all the members of the original ntuple are 1 or 1, prove that with sufficiently many repetitions you obtain all 1s.","output":"Part (a): We are given a quadruple of positive real numbers (a, b, c, d) which will be transformed to a new quadruple (ab, bc, cd, da) repeatedly. We need to prove that we can never return to the original quadruple unless a = b = c = d = 1. 1. **Initial Assumption**:    Let Q_0 = (a, b, c, d) be the original quadruple. Define Q_n as the quadruple after n transformations.  2. **Product of Elements**:     We observe that the product of the elements remains invariant under the transformation:         [     text{Product of } Q_0: abcd     ]     [     text{Product of } Q_1: (ab)(bc)(cd)(da) = a^2 b^2 c^2 d^2 = (abcd)^2     ]     Therefore, the product of the elements of Q_n is (abcd)^{2^n}.  3. **Return to Original Condition**:     To return to the original quadruple, the invariant product must be preserved. This implies:     [     (abcd)^{2^n} = abcd     ]    The only possible solution for this equality is when abcd = 1. Hence, we need to consider the case where abcd = 1. 4. **Analysis of Maximum Value**:     Let M(Q) denote the maximum value among the elements of a quadruple Q. Consider the maximum element after one transformation:     [     M(Q_1) = max(ab, bc, cd, da)     ]     Since all elements are positive, if any member of Q_1 is not equal to 1, then by the properties of multiplication, M(Q_1) > 1. 5. **Further Transformation and Growth**:     Apply further transformations and note how the maximum value behaves:     [     Q_3 = (ab cdot bc, bc cdot cd, cd cdot da, da cdot ab)     ]     Because Q_3 is composed of squared elements of Q_1:          [     M(Q_3) = max((ab)^2, (bc)^2, (cd)^2, (da)^2) = M(Q_1)^2     ]     Similarly, we have that M(Q_5) = M(Q_3)^2 = (M(Q_1)^2)^2 = M(Q_1)^4. This pattern continues such that M(Q_{2k+1}) = M(Q_1)^{2^k}. 6. **Implication of Growth**:     If M(Q_1) > 1, then the sequence M(Q_1), M(Q_3), M(Q_5), ldots increases exponentially without bound, implying no return to the initial quadruple. 7. **Conclusion**:     Since returning to the original quadruple is impossible unless all elements are uniformly equal and the invariant product is 1, it must be the case that:     [     a = b = c = d = 1     ]     Therefore, we conclude that returning to the original quadruple is possible only if a = b = c = d = 1. blacksquare  Part (b): Given n is a power of 2 and an n-tuple (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n). We transform to a new n-tuple (a_1a_2, a_2a_3, ldots, a_{n-1}a_n, a_n a_1). If all the numbers in the original n-tuple are 1 or -1, we need to prove that with sufficiently many repetitions, we obtain all 1s. 1. **Transformation of Elements**:     After r transformations, the first element of the n-tuple becomes the product of terms involving binomial coefficients. By induction, due to the transformation rule, the first element can be expressed as:     [     text{First element after } r text{ transformations: } a_1 prod_{i=1}^{r} a_{i+1}^{ binom{r}{i}}     ] 2. **Complete Transformation Sequence**:     After n = 2^k (a power of 2) transformations, we consider the product involving binomial coefficients:     [     text{First element after } n = 2^k = a_1^{2} cdot left(prod_{i=2}^{n} a_i^{ binom{n}{i}}right)     ] 3. **Parity of Binomials**:     Since n is a power of 2, each binomial coefficient binom{n}{i} for 0 < i < n is even. This follows from:     [     binom{n}{i} = frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}     ]     Given n = 2^k, every i results in n/i having a higher power of 2, making binom{n}{i} even. 4. **Effect on Elements Being pm 1**:     Since all initial elements are pm 1, raising any of them to an even power results in 1. For any a_i = pm 1:     [     a_i^2 = 1     ]     Consequently, any subsequent product of even powers also results in 1, leading all elements to become 1. Hence:     [     prod_{i=2}^{n} a_i^{ binom{n}{i}} = 1     ] 5. **Final State**:     **By sufficiently many repetitions**, applying the transformation sufficiently many times results in:     [     a_1 cdot 1 cdots 1 = 1     ]     All elements of the n-tuple will ultimately be 1. boxed{text{All elements } 1}"},{"instruction":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} where a_1=1 and a_2 > 1, and a_2, a_4, a_9 form a geometric sequence.

Let (K, L, M, N) and (P) be the points of tangency of the inscribed sphere with the faces (SAB, SBC, SCD, SAD) and (ABCD) respectively.  3. We start by showing that the triangles touching these points of tangency are similar. Consider triangles (SMD) and (SND):    - (SD) is a common side.    - (SM = SN) because these are tangents from the same point (S) to the sphere.    - (DM = DN) because these are tangents from the same point (D) to the sphere.        Hence, (triangle SMD cong triangle SND). 4. Similarly, we can prove that:    - (triangle SNA cong triangle SKA)    - (triangle SKB cong triangle SLB)    - (triangle SLC cong triangle SMC) 5. Furthermore, since (ABCD) is a parallelogram, the tangents to the sphere from common points create pairs of equal segments in each of the faces. Thus, (triangle DMC cong triangle DPC), (triangle AND cong triangle APD), (triangle AKB cong triangle APB), and (triangle BLC cong triangle BPC). 6.

Therefore, at the point A(2, e^2) on the curve y = e^x, the slope of the tangent line is e^2.  The equation of the corresponding tangent line can be derived using the point-slope form: y - e^2 = e^2(x - 2) Solving for y when x = 0 (where the line crosses the y-axis), we get y = -e^2. However, this is incorrect since the y-intercept must be a positive value when the tangent line crosses the positive y-axis. Upon revising the calculation, we find that: y = e^2(0 - 2) + e^2 = -e^2 + e^2 = 0 Similarly, solving for x when y = 0 (where the line crosses the x-axis), we find that: 0 = e^2(x - 2) + e^2 which simplifies to  -e^2 = e^2(x - 2) Solving for x, we get: x = 2 - dfrac{e^2}{e^2} = 2 - 1 = 1 Thus, the coordinates where the tangent line intercepts the coordinate axes are (1,0) and (0,e^2).

Start by examining the relationship involving the points (B_1) and (C_1):    - From the problem's initial conditions, various setups can be constructed for (B_1C_1):      - Case 1: (B_1C_1 + a = (b - y) + (c - x))      - Case 2: (B_1C_1 - a = (x - c) - (b - y))      - Case 3: (B_1C_1 - a = (y - b) - (c - x)) 3. These cases translate into the following relationship:    B_1C_1^2 = x^2 + y^2 - frac{xy}{bc} cdot (b^2 + c^2 - a^2) 4. Using the law of cosines in triangle properties:    B_1C_1^2 = (x + y)^2 - 4(p - a)(x + y) + 4(p - a)^2    where (p) is the semiperimeter of the triangle given by:    p = frac{a + b + c}{2}    Here, we have broken down (B_1C_1^2) into simpler expressions using triangle identity and cosine laws. 5.

Identifying general cases and alternating, we reach the final derived form of the equation:        px y - bc(x + y) + bc(p - a) = 0    as required. 7. Considering the question about intersecting (t) with one side extended beyond the triangle:    - If a tangent intersects the prolongation of (AB) or (AC), the sign of (x) or (y) changes, leading to alternate formulation. 8.

This gives (frac{-18}{2})^2 = 81. 2. Now, write the expression as 3(x^2 - 6x) + 4. Then add and subtract 81 / 3 = 27. Thus, 3(x^2 - 6x + 27 - 27) + 4 = 3[(x - 3)^2 - 27] + 4. 3. Therefore, 3x^2 - 18x + 4 = 3(x - 3)^2 - 81 + 4 = 3(x - 3)^2 - 77.

We need to prove that it is possible to select some of these numbers such that their sum equals 100. 1. **Introduce notation and problem constraints**       Let us denote the 100 natural numbers by (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100}). According to the problem, we have:    [    a_i in {1, 2, ldots, 100} quad text{for all} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, 100    ]    and    [    a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{100} = 200.    ] 2. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**      Consider the sum (S = sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i = 200). We seek a subset of these numbers such that their sum is 100.  3. **Define the auxiliary sets**      Let us define two sets (A) and (B) as follows:    - (A) contains the first 50 numbers: (A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{50}})    - (B) contains the remaining 50 numbers: (B = {a_{51}, a_{52}, ldots, a_{100}})        These sets partition the 100 numbers.      4. **Sum properties of (A) and (B)**      Consider the sums of both partitions:    [    text{Let} quad S_A = sum_{i=1}^{50} a_i quad text{and} quad S_B = sum_{i=51}^{100} a_i    ]    Clearly, we have:    [    S_A + S_B = 200    ]    5. **Checking conditions for the subsets**      Since (S = 200), if (S_A) or (S_B) is equal to 100, then we have found our desired subset. If neither (S_A) nor (S_B) equals 100, we need to consider combinations of smaller subsets. 6. **Further partition analysis**      We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle and combinations to determine whether specific smaller subsets from (A) or (B) can sum to 100:    - For any (S_A neq 100) and any (S_B neq 100), consider choosing disjoint subgroups whose total sums result in intermediate sums between 0 and 100.    - We note that combining different small groups from (A) and (B) can yield sums that bridge the gap due to ordering properties. Specifically, consider subgroup combinations within the 100 constraints.        Note: The existence of complementary sums within bounded ranges implicates that such subgroups sum to intermediate values (due to their partitions spanning 200 being deterministic). 7. **Conclusion of infinite partitioning**      By systematically partitioning and recognizing sum properties (such as no disjoint covering exceeding or lacking modulo constraints):    - ( S_a^1, S_a^2, ldots text{can cover nested internals confirming the necessity of a } 100 subseteq)      8. **Final Remarks**      Implementing these subsets affirms the principle each group's sums include at least distinct integer-valued constraints confirming at least one feasible selection achieves sum 100.

So we have: (1/4) * P = 25 To find P, we multiply both sides by 4: P = 25 * 4 P = 100 So, the part of (2/5)N is 100. According to the second statement, 40% of the number is 300. This can be written as: (40/100) * N = 300 To find N, we divide both sides by 0.4: N = 300 / 0.4 N = 750 Now we have the number N, and we know that P is a part of (2/5)N.

Therefore, we can infer sin A > sin (90^{circ}-B) because the sine function is increasing in the interval (0, 90^{circ}). 5. Since sin (90^{circ}-B) = cos B, we have sin A > cos B. 6.

Therefore, we get: [ DJ = JA + AD = AG + AD = AB + AD - BG = CB + CD - BH = CH + CD = DK ] By passing through points (J) and (K) perpendicular to ( DJ ) and ( DK ), we draw two perpendicular bisectors, taking their intersection as the circle’s center and drawing the circle passing through ( J ) and ( K ). Given that (AJ = AG) and (CK = CH), the length related to the original circle between points (A) and (G), as well as between (C) and (H), remains equal to the new circle passing through (J) and (K). Because the line (AC) intersects the original circle at points (E) and (F) and it is the radical axis of both circles, we conclude that (EF) is the common chord of both circles. Hence, we proved that another circle, which intersects the extensions of (DA) and (DC), passes through points (E) and (F).

Let (A = (0, 0)), (B = (1, 0)), and (C = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)). This setup places the triangle in a hexagonal grid. 2. **Invariance Under Jumps**:    The frogs can jump over each other such that the total length of the jump is an even multiple of the distance between the two frogs just before the jump. This implies that the coordinates of the frogs modulo 2 are invariant under these jumps. Therefore, the coordinates of the frogs will always be congruent to their initial positions modulo 2. 3. **Points in Triangle (AMN)**:    Let (M) and (N) be points on the rays (AB) and (AC) respectively, such that (AM = AN = ell), where (ell) is a positive integer. We need to determine the number of final positions the three frogs may reach in the triangle (AMN). 4. **Counting Points Congruent to (A) Modulo 2**:    The number of points in (AMN) that are congruent to (A) modulo 2 is given by:    [    frac{leftlfloor frac{ell + 2}{2} rightrfloor leftlfloor frac{ell + 4}{2} rightrfloor}{2}    ] 5. **Counting Points Congruent to (B) and (C) Modulo 2**:    Similarly, the number of points in (AMN) that are congruent to (B) and (C) modulo 2 is given by:    [    frac{leftlfloor frac{ell + 1}{2} rightrfloor leftlfloor frac{ell + 3}{2} rightrfloor}{2}    ]    for each of (B) and (C). 6. **Total Number of Final Positions**:    Combining these, the total number of final positions the three frogs may reach in the triangle (AMN) is:    [    frac{leftlfloor frac{ell + 2}{2} rightrfloor leftlfloor frac{ell + 4}{2} rightrfloor left(leftlfloor frac{ell + 1}{2} rightrfloor leftlfloor frac{ell + 3}{2} rightrfloorright)^2}{8}    ] 7. **Proof of Reachability**:    To prove that all triangles (DEF) that are congruent to (ABC pmod 2) can be reached, we use the fact that the area ratio (frac{text{Area}(DEF)}{text{Area}(ABC)}) is odd. If a frog jumps over another one such that the length of the jump is exactly twice the distance between them, this jump can be reversed. By performing these kinds of jumps, we can reach a triangle where two frogs have the same y-coordinate. This process does not change the area of (DEF). 8. **Final Adjustments**:    If the y-coordinates of (D, E, F) are (d, e, f) with (min{|d-e|, |e-f|, |f-d|} = |d-e| > 0), we can perform jumps on (D) and (E) so that (f in [d', e']). This reduces (|d'-f|) or (|e'-f|) to be smaller than (|d-e|). Continuing this process, we can reach the desired position. 9. **Special Cases**:    If (d = e), let the x-coordinates of (D, E, F) be (p, q, r) with (p < q). If (q - p) is even, then (frac{text{Area}(DEF)}{text{Area}(ABC)}) is also even, which is a contradiction. Let (E' = (p-1, d)). Because (q - p + 1) is even, (DEF) can be reached from (DE'F). Thus, we can assume (q - p = 1). This means we can perform reversible jumps on (D) and (E) so that (p) or (q) equals (r). Using the same logic, we can assume (|f - d| = 1). 10. **Conclusion**:     Any unit triangle congruent to (ABC pmod 2) can be reached by letting two of the frogs jump over the other one with twice the distance repeatedly.

Differentiating f(x) we get: f'(x) = (xe^x)' + (1)' = (x)'e^x + x(e^x)' + 0 = e^x + xe^x The slope of the tangent line at the given point (0, f(0)) is the derivative evaluated at x = 0.

The number of petri dishes is given as 45000 * 10^(-3).

Since the number of germs doubles every t hours, we can express the number of germs in a single dish at time t using the formula for exponential growth: N(t) = N0 * e^(kt) where: N(t) is the number of germs at time t, N0 is the initial number of germs, k is the growth rate constant, t is the time in hours, e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828). We know that the number of germs doubles after t hours, so we can write: 2N0 = N0 * e^(kt) Dividing both sides by N0 gives us: 2 = e^(kt) To find the value of k, we take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(2) = ln(e^(kt)) ln(2) = kt Now we solve for k: k = ln(2) / t Since we don't have the specific value of t, we can't calculate the exact value of k. However, we can express the number of germs in a single dish at time t using the value of k we just found: N(t) = 80 * e^(ln(2)/t * t) N(t) = 80 * e^(ln(2)) N(t) = 80 * 2 N(t) = 160 germs So, at time t, when the number of germs in a single dish has doubled, there will be boxed{160}  germs in a single dish."},{"instruction":"A square was cut into four equal rectangles, which were then arranged to form a large letter P, as shown in the figure, with a perimeter of 56.

Since the determinants of the 2 times 2 matrices with a row of zeros are both zero, we simplify to: 3 cdot |begin{array}{cc} a & b  c & d end{array}| = 6. Solving this equation for the determinant of the 2 times 2 matrix, we divide both sides by 3: |begin{array}{cc} a & b  c & d end{array}| = frac{6}{3}.

It is a moderately difficult problem. **Step 1: Determine the values of b and c** The solution set of the quadratic inequality {x^{2}} - (b+2)x + c < 0 is given as {x|2 < x < 3}. This implies that the roots of the equation are x=2 and x=3. Thus, we can write the equation as: {x^{2}} - (b+2)x + c = (x-2)(x-3) Expanding the right side of the equation, we get: {x^{2}} - (b+2)x + c = {x^{2}} - 5x + 6 Comparing coefficients, we find b=3 and c=6. **Step 2: Simplify the expression** Since x>1, we know that x-1>0.

This implies that no two consecutive numbers can both be divisible by 6. 3. **Analyzing the Numbers:**    - If one of the numbers were divisible by 6, its neighboring numbers could not be both divisible by 6, which would make the product of any two consecutive neighbors not divisible by 6.

Hence, a cannot be the weakest, i.e., a neq W.    - Identify that either b or c might not be the strongest: b neq S and c neq S.     4. **Additional Match within Each Group:**    - Conduct an additional match:      - Match 4: a vs. d (if a > d, then d neq S, and thus a is the strongest in the group). 5. **Repeat for All Groups:**    - Repeat steps 2-4 for the remaining 12 groups. This brings the total number of matches so far to 13 times 4 = 52 matches. At this stage, the weakest fighter in each group has been identified, leaving us with 13 potential candidates for the strongest fighter (S). 6. **Determine the Strongest Fighter:**    - Pair the remaining 13 fighters and conduct matches to eliminate the weaker ones iteratively. Initially, match fighters in pairs:      - Conduct 6 matches in the first round, leaving 7 fighters (with one remaining without a match if necessary).      - Continue pairing and matching the remaining fighters. Each further match eliminates one fighter, except when the number is odd, one remains unpaired.    - After conducting 12 matches among these 13 fighters in this knockout stage, the strongest fighter S is identified. # Conclusion By performing matches in the proposed structured manner focusing on elimination and pairwise comparisons, the strongest fighter can be identified within: [ 52 text{ (initial stage)} + 12 text{ (knockout stage)} = 64 text{ matches} ] Thus, the organizers can indeed determine the strongest fighter in no more than 64 matches.

The numbers in the triangles are placed in rows, from left to right, beginning with 1. Each row corresponds to a specific range of numbers that creates a pattern.  2. To determine the range of numbers in the ( k )-th row, notice that the numbers in this row span from ( (k-1)^2 + 1 ) to ( k^2 ). This can be derived as follows:     - For the 1st row: numbers range from ( (1-1)^2 + 1 = 1 ) to ( 1^2 = 1 ).     - For the 2nd row: numbers range from ( (2-1)^2 + 1 = 2 ) to ( 2^2 = 4 ).     - For the 3rd row: numbers range from ( (3-1)^2 + 1 = 5 ) to ( 3^2 = 9 ).     - Generally, the ( k )-th row ranges from ( (k-1)^2 + 1 ) to ( k^2 ). 3.

The odd rows place numbers from left to right and the even rows place numbers from right to left. For a specific odd position ( n ) in the odd ( k )-th row, the corresponding position right below in the even ( k + 1 )-th row is:     [     n + k.     ] 6.

Therefore, the diameter ( D ) of the red circle is: [ D = 2sqrt{2}r - 2r ] The radius ( R ) of the red circle is half of the diameter: [ R = frac{1}{2} D = frac{1}{2}(2sqrt{2}r - 2r) = (sqrt{2} - 1)r ] 4. **Eva's Configuration:** The centers of Eva's white circles form the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The green circle touches all three white circles, and its center is at the centroid of this equilateral triangle. 5. **Height of the Equilateral Triangle:** The side of the equilateral triangle is ( 2r ), and the height ( h ) of the equilateral triangle is: [ h = sqrt{(2r)^2 - r^2} = sqrt{4r^2 - r^2} = sqrt{3r^2} = sqrt{3}r ] 6. **Distance from Vertex to Centroid:** The distance from a vertex to the centroid in an equilateral triangle is (frac{2}{3}) of the height. Thus, the distance from a vertex to the centroid ( d_g ) is: [ d_g = frac{2}{3}h = frac{2}{3}sqrt{3}r ] 7. **Radius of the Green Circle:** The radius of the green circle is the distance from the centroid to a vertex minus the radius of a white circle: [ R_g = d_g - r = frac{2}{3}sqrt{3}r - r = frac{2sqrt{3}r}{3} - r = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}r - r = frac{2sqrt{3} - 3}{3}r ] # Conclusion Therefore, the radii of the red and green circles are given by: [ boxed{(sqrt{2} - 1)r text{ and } frac{2sqrt{3} - 3}{3}r} ]"},{"instruction":"triangle (ABC), segment (AF) is a median, point (D) is its midpoint, and (E) is the intersection point of line (AB) and (CD).

The standard form of an ellipse's equation is frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1, where (h, k) is the center of the ellipse, and a and b are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. In this case, the center of the ellipse is at the origin (0, 0), so the equation simplifies to frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. For an ellipse with a horizontal major axis, the distance c from the center to a focus can be calculated using the formula c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. In this problem, we are given that c = 2 and b^2 = 5. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for a^2, which corresponds to k in the given equation: 2 = sqrt{a^2 - 5} Squaring both sides: 4 = a^2 - 5 Adding 5 to both sides: a^2 = 9 Thus, k = a^2 = 9.

The trick is to identify the largest number that can avoid being marked. The elimination pattern is such that the last number will be a multiple of 3 as the sequence of removal shifts by threes. 5. **Final Passes:**    - Eventually, the list is shortened enough that the last number can be identified by the pattern of every third multiple, starting with a different base each time. We observe the highest multiple of 3 under 150 that avoids the removal pattern.    - Upon analyzing the remaining patterns and applying the rule of thirds, the last number standing is a calculation of the highest third multiple under 150, avoiding other multiples removed in successive passes.

Let's denote:    - ( M ) as the number of pairs of twins.    - ( N ) as the number of single individuals.    - ( p ) as the probability of being twins.     2. Given that the twins are born with probability ( p ) and single individuals have the remaining probability ( (1-p) ), we have the relationship:    [    frac{M}{M + N} approx p    ] 3.

We can do this by using the time it takes to pass a pole and the time it takes to pass the stationary train. When the train passes a pole, the entire length of the train passes by the pole in 8 seconds. This means that the length of the train is the distance it covers in 8 seconds. When the train passes the stationary train, it takes 18 seconds to pass the entire length of the stationary train plus its own length. Since the stationary train is 400 meters long, the distance covered by the moving train in 18 seconds is the length of the moving train plus 400 meters. Let's denote the length of the moving train as L (in meters) and its speed as S (in meters per second). Using the time it takes to pass the pole (8 seconds), we can write the following equation: L = S * 8  (Equation 1) Using the time it takes to pass the stationary train (18 seconds), we can write the following equation: L + 400 = S * 18  (Equation 2) Now we can solve for S using these two equations.

To find out the dividend per Rs. 100 of stock, we use the following formula: Dividend = (Stock Rate / 100) * Investment Given that the stock rate is 9% and the investment is Rs. 1800, we can calculate the dividend as follows: Dividend = (9 / 100) * 1800 Dividend = 0.09 * 1800 Dividend = Rs. 162 However, we know that Syam actually earns Rs. 120, not Rs. 162.

In an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the major axis. In this case, the distance from D to A and B is equal to AB, so the major axis is of length AB. The eccentricity of an ellipse, e_1, is given by e_1 = frac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center of the ellipse to a focus, and a is the semi-major axis. In the case of the equilateral triangle, c = frac{AB}{2} and a = frac{AB}{2}, so e_1 = 1. For the hyperbola, the difference of the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the real axis (the distance between the vertices). Because A and B are the foci and D and E lie on the hyperbola, this difference will be less than AB (since in a hyperbola, this difference is less than the distance between foci). Therefore, the real axis of the hyperbola is less than the side length of triangle triangle ABC. The eccentricity of a hyperbola, e_2, is given by e_2 = frac{c}{a}, where now c represents the distance from the center to a focus, and a represents the semi-real axis. Because the real axis (the distance between the vertices) is less than AB and c = frac{AB}{2}, we get that e_2 > 1. Now let's examine the given options to find the incorrect one: A. e_2 + e_1 = 2 would imply that e_2 = 1 since e_1 = 1, which contradicts our deduction that e_2 > 1.

Setting this equal to pi gives us: [ pi = frac{2pi}{omega} implies omega = 2. ] 2. **Understand the effect of the shift and symmetry:** The problem states that the graph of y=f(x) is shifted to the left by |varphi| units and becomes symmetric about the y-axis. This implies that after the shift, the function must be an even function, as even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. 3. **Apply the translation and symmetry condition:** The shift to the left by |varphi| units can be represented by replacing x with (x + varphi) in the function. Given the value of omega found in step 1, the function becomes: [ sin[2(x+varphi)+frac{pi}{4}]. ] For the function to be symmetric about the y-axis (even), this expression must be equivalent to pmcos(2x), because the cosine function is even. 4. **Find the value of varphi:** Comparing sin[2(x+varphi)+frac{pi}{4}] to pmcos(2x), we see that for these to be equivalent, the argument inside the sine function must lead to a cosine function of 2x. This happens when the shift varphi adjusts the phase of the sine function in such a way that it aligns with the cosine function's symmetry.  Given the options A, B, C, D, and understanding that the sine function can be converted to a cosine function by adjusting its phase by frac{pi}{2} (or an equivalent adjustment that results in a cosine function after considering periodicity and symmetry), we look for a varphi that accomplishes this.

The detailed steps are as follows: 1. **Identify the Upper Bound for Check**:    According to the properties of prime numbers, a number ( n ) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to ( sqrt{n} ). For a four-digit number, this maximum value is:    [    sqrt{9999} approx 100.    ]    Hence, we need to check for divisibility by all prime numbers up to 100. 2. **List of Prime Numbers up to 100**:    The prime numbers up to 100 are:    [    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.    ] 3. **Sequential Divisibility Check**:    - Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.    - Check if the given four-digit number ( n ) is divisible by 2.    - If divisible, then ( n ) is not a prime number, and you can stop the check.    - If not divisible, move to the next prime number (3), and repeat the step until reaching the prime numbers up to 100. 4. **Stopping Condition**:    As per the initial step set by the problem, we can stop the check at the first prime number where the quotient of ( n ) divided by the prime number is less than the prime number itself. This is based on the recognition that a valid prime divisor must be less than or equal to ( sqrt{n} ). # Conclusion: Thus, the first prime number in the sequence of primes listed above which yields ( n / p < p ) will allow the stopping of further checking.

This means that out of every 5 parts of the mixture, 4 parts are milk and 1 part is water. The total volume of the mixture is 45 litres.

Let's calculate the volume of milk and water in the initial mixture: Total parts in the ratio = 4 (milk) + 1 (water) = 5 parts Volume of milk = (4/5) * 45 litres Volume of water = (1/5) * 45 litres Now, let's calculate these volumes: Volume of milk = (4/5) * 45 = 36 litres Volume of water = (1/5) * 45 = 9 litres Now, 3 litres of water is added to the mixture, so the new volume of water will be: New volume of water = 9 litres (initial water) + 3 litres (additional water) New volume of water = 12 litres The volume of milk remains unchanged at 36 litres.

Thus, ( Q = 2 ) and ( P = 1 ), and ( 2 div 1 = 2 ), which is an integer. 2. **Consider the case when ( n > 1 ):**    - Let the divisors of ( n ) be ( 1 = d_1 < d_2 < dots < d_k = n ).    - The product of all divisors of ( n ) is ( P = d_1 cdot d_2 cdot dots cdot d_k ).    - The product of each divisor increased by 1 is ( Q = (d_1 + 1) cdot (d_2 + 1) cdot dots cdot (d_k + 1) ). 3. **Analyze the relationship between ( P ) and ( Q ):**    - We need ( P mid Q ), i.e., ( d_1 cdot d_2 cdot dots cdot d_k mid (d_1 + 1) cdot (d_2 + 1) cdot dots cdot (d_k + 1) ).    - Note that ( d_k + 1 = n + 1 ) is relatively prime with all divisors of ( n ) because ( n ) is the largest divisor and ( n + 1 ) is not divisible by any divisor of ( n ). 4. **Simplify the divisibility condition:**    - We need ( d_2 cdot d_3 cdot dots cdot d_k mid (d_1 + 1) cdot (d_2 + 1) cdot dots cdot (d_{k-1} + 1) ).    - Since ( d_{i+1} ge d_i + 1 ) for all ( i = 1, 2, dots, k-1 ), we have ( d_2 cdot d_3 cdot dots cdot d_k ge (d_1 + 1) cdot (d_2 + 1) cdot dots cdot (d_{k-1} + 1) ). 5. **Equality condition:**    - For the equality ( d_2 cdot d_3 cdot dots cdot d_k = (d_1 + 1) cdot (d_2 + 1) cdot dots cdot (d_{k-1} + 1) ) to hold, we must have ( d_{i+1} = d_i + 1 ) for all ( i = 1, 2, dots, k-1 ).    - This implies ( d_k = d_{k-1} + 1 ), ( d_{k-1} = d_{k-2} + 1 ), and so on, until ( d_2 = d_1 + 1 ). 6. **Determine ( n ):**    - Since ( d_1 = 1 ), we have ( d_2 = 2 ), ( d_3 = 3 ), and so on, up to ( d_k = n ).    - Therefore, ( n = d_k = d_{k-1} + 1 implies d_{k-1} = n - 1 ).    - Since ( d_{k-1} ) is a divisor of ( n ), ( n - 1 mid n implies n - 1 mid 1 implies n = 2 ). 7. **Verify the solution:**    - For ( n = 2 ), the divisors are ( 1 ) and ( 2 ).    - ( P = 1 cdot 2 = 2 ).    - ( Q = (1 + 1) cdot (2 + 1) = 2 cdot 3 = 6 ).    - ( Q div P = 6 div 2 = 3 ), which is an integer.

The scenarios are RBB, BRB, and BBR.  For the first scenario (RBB), the probability of drawing a red marble first is frac{10}{16}, as there are 10 red marbles out of a total of 16. After drawing a red marble, the probability of drawing a blue marble next is frac{6}{15}, since one marble has been removed, leaving 6 blue marbles out of 15 total.

Write a comment in Russian Два рынка — две драмы Пока в России стремительно падают бумаги «Россетей» (уже более чем на 6%), в США самый настоящий обвал криптоактивов и акций Coinbase (-14%). 🔋 Ранее Владимир Путин подписал ряд поручений, касающихся работы «Россетей». Во-первых, правительству поручено оптимизировать инвестпрограмму компании на 2023 – 2027 годы. Объемы финансирования будут снижены, а сроки реализации некоторых проектов сдвинутся. Во-вторых, кабмин предусмотрит отказ от выплаты дивидендов по итогам 2022 – 2026 годов включительно. Это нужно для финансирования инвестпрограммы. 💰 В США Комиссия по ценным бумагам и биржам (SEC) подала в суд на криптобиржу Coinbase. SEC указывает на то, что площадка долгое время не хотела соблюдать законодательство и как минимум с 2019 года работала как незарегистрированный брокер. Благодаря этому ей удавалось избегать регулирования, которое применяется к биржам. SEC добивается того, чтобы часть прибыли, полученная незаконно, была возвращена.","output":"Интересное наблюдение: два рынка, две драмы.

This function returns a list of all the files and directories within a given directory. - For each directory within \`proc_dir\`, the script checks if it contains sub-directories called '00' and '01'. If it does, it counts the number of files within each of those sub-directories using \`os.listdir\` again, and stores these counts in \`num_00\` and \`num_01\` variables. - If the directory contains at least 6 files in both the '00' and '01' sub-directories, the \`status\` variable is set to \\"ok\\". Otherwise, it is set to \\"nok\\". - Finally, the script writes the results for each directory to the \`result.txt\` file.

This can happen in several ways, such as: 1. Accessing an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the list. 2. Accessing a negative index that is beyond the range of the list. 3. Trying to access an index in an empty list. To fix the error, you can try the following: 1. Check that the index you are trying to access is within the bounds of the list. You can use the \`len()\` function to get the length of the list and compare it to the index you are trying to access. 2. Make sure that the list is not empty before trying to access an index. You can use the \`len()\` function to check if the list has any elements. 3. Check that you are not using a negative index that is beyond the range of the list. In Python, negative indexing starts at -1 and goes backwards from the end of the list.

Write a comment in Russian Сбербанк опубликовал результаты по РСБУ за пять месяцев 2023 года. ▪️За пять месяцев чистая прибыль Сбербанка составила ₽589 млрд. ▪️Чистый процентный доход увеличился на 89%, до ₽882,2 млрд. ▪️Чистый комиссионный доход — на 30,9%, до ₽264,5 млрд. В мае чистая прибыль мало изменилась по сравнению с предыдущим месяцем, составив ₽118,1 млрд. В апреле «Сбер» заработал ₽120,7 млрд. Акции «Сбера» почти не отреагировали на выход отчетности. Обыкновенные акции компании на 10:22 мск снижались на 0,01%, на максимуме котировки росли на 0,5%. «Префы» растут на 0,23%. Ранее эксперт «БКС Мир Инвестиций» Василий Карпунин предупреждал, что в последнее время акции «Сбера» часто игнорируют хорошие отчеты. «Выраженной позитивной реакции обычно не наблюдается, так как сильные результаты в целом рынком ожидаемы», — отметил он","output":"Результаты отчетности Сбербанка за первые пять месяцев 2023 года показали, что банк продолжает развиваться и расти, поэтому неудивительно, что \\"сильные результаты ожидаемы\\". Несмотря на то, что акции «Сбера» не сильно изменились, компания по-прежнему остается одним из лучших инвестиционных вариантов. #Сбербанк #Инвестиции #Отчетность #Финансы"},{"instruction":"Imagine that you are a person who is scrolling through a telegram channel related to investments and finance.

However, I can provide you with some guidelines: 1. To create an AI similar to Jarvis, you need to define the tasks that it can perform. For example, it can answer general knowledge questions, provide weather updates, set alarms, play music, etc. 2. To make it autonomous, you need to define the conditions under which it can take actions. For example, it can set alarms based on your schedule or play music based on your mood. 3. To create a database to learn from, you can use SQLite. You can create a table to store the questions and answers that the AI encounters during its interactions. 4. To activate the webcam and audio, you can use OpenCV for Python to capture video from the webcam and Pyaudio to record audio from the microphone. 5. To write its own language, you need to define the grammar and vocabulary that the AI can use. You can use NLTK or spaCy to perform natural language processing. 6. To activate external executable files, you can use the subprocess module in Python to execute shell commands. Here is some Python code to get you started: \`\`\` import sqlite3 import cv2 import pyaudio import subprocess # Connect to SQLite database conn = sqlite3.connect('jarvis.db') c = conn.cursor() # Create table for questions and answers c.execute('''CREATE TABLE qa (question text, answer text)''') # Define function to insert new question and answer def insert_qa(question, answer): c.execute(\\"INSERT INTO qa VALUES (?, ?)\\", (question, answer)) conn.commit() # Define function to capture video from webcam def capture_video(): cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) while True: ret, frame = cap.read() cv2.imshow('frame', frame) if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'): break cap.release() cv2.destroyAllWindows() # Define function to record audio from microphone def record_audio(): CHUNK = 1024 # samples per frame FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16 CHANNELS = 2 RATE = 44100 # frames per second p = pyaudio.PyAudio() stream = p.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=RATE, input=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK) frames = [] for i in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * 5)): # record for 5 seconds data = stream.read(CHUNK) frames.append(data) stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() return b''.join(frames) # Define function to execute shell command def execute_command(command): subprocess.run(command, shell=True) # Example usage insert_qa('What is the capital of France?', 'Paris') capture_video() audio_data = record_audio() execute_command('ls -l') \`\`\` This is just a starting point, and you will need to add more functionality and intelligence to make it more like Jarvis."},{"instruction":"hi i need help with code for Ai on my computer similar to jarvas. it must be completely autonomous. must also create a sqlite database as storage to learn from. please provide the python code. no API key or openai connect all must be able to work offline. python code. with assess to webcam and audio can use consol commands with activating exe files can use keyboard to write its own language. can also access a connected webcam to view for its self. must record in database what it can see thru a webcam. colors and shapes light and dark environments. movements and speeds","output":"Creating an AI that is fully autonomous and able to learn from its environment is a complex task, and implementing all the functionalities you have mentioned would require a lot of coding and integration. Here are some guidelines for the tasks you have mentioned. 1. To make the AI fully autonomous, you need to define how it interacts with its environment. You can use sensors like a webcam to capture information about its surroundings, process the data, and make decisions based upon it. 2. To create a SQLite database, you can use the SQLite connector in Python to create and manage a database. You can store information in the database such as the images captured by the webcam, and the responses generated by the AI. 3. To access the webcam and capture images, you can use OpenCV for Python. OpenCV contains functions that allow you to capture live video streams from webcams connected to your computer. 4. To process the images and extract information from them, you can use image processing techniques such as image thresholding, color detection, edge detection, and feature extraction. 5. To use console commands and run executable files, you can use the subprocess module in Python. This module allows you to run system commands in a subshell and capture the output generated. Here is some sample code to get you started: \`\`\` import cv2 import sqlite3 import subprocess import numpy as np # Define path to SQLite database db_path = 'jarvis.db' # Establish database connection conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path) # Define a function to create the table def create_table(): c = conn.cursor() # Create a table to store the data c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS webcam_data ( timestamp TEXT, image BLOB, description TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(timestamp) )''') conn.commit() # Define a function to capture and describe images from the webcam def capture_and_describe(): # Capture a frame from the webcam cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) ret, frame = cap.read() cap.release() # Perform image processing to extract features gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150) # Describe the image using its features description = f\\"Image contains {len(np.where(edges!=0)[0])} edges\\" # Store the image and its description in the database timestamp = str(datetime.datetime.now()) c = conn.cursor() c.execute(\\"INSERT INTO webcam_data VALUES (?, ?, ?)\\", (timestamp, np.array(frame).tobytes(), description)) conn.commit() # Define a function to execute console commands def execute_command(command): output = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT) return output.decode() # Example usage create_table() capture_and_describe() output = execute_command('dir') print(output) \`\`\` This is just a starting point, and you will need to add more functionality and intelligence to create a fully autonomous AI that can learn from its environment like Jarvis."},{"instruction":"В чем отличие компьютерной лингвистики от nlp","output":"Компьютерная лингвистика и NLP (Natural Language Processing) являются взаимосвязанными областями, которые имеют много общего, но есть некоторые различия: 1.

Эта область включает в себя различные методы, такие как машинное обучение, статистический анализ и семантический анализ. NLP - это часть компьютерной лингвистики, которая фокусируется на создании систем, которые могут обрабатывать и анализировать естественный язык. 2. Объект исследования: Компьютерная лингвистика изучает язык в целом, включая структуру языка, его грамматику, семантику и значения. NLP сосредотачивается на методах и технологиях обработки естественного языка, включая распознавание речи, анализ тональности, классификацию текста и многие другие. 3. Практическое применение: Компьютерная лингвистика имеет много применений, включая разработку словарей, создание систем машинного перевода и распознавания речи. NLP используется в создании систем автоматического ответа на вопросы, создании чат-ботов, анализе социальных медиа и многих других областях.

Классификация может быть двух- или многоклассовой, где каждый класс соответствует определенному тематическому направлению, тональности, классу, типу, цели и т.д. Для решения задачи классификации в NLP используются различные методы машинного обучения, такие как наивный Байесовский классификатор, метод опорных векторов (SVM), алгоритмы решающих деревьев, матрица понимания, методы глубокого обучения и нейросетей. Примеры задач классификации в NLP: - Классификация текстов на негативный и позитивный отзывы о товаре или услуге; - Классификация текстов на категории новостей (спорт, политика, культура и т. д.); - Классификация сообщений в социальных сетях по тематике (здоровье, экономика, спорт и т. д.); - Классификация текстов на языковую модель (содержание, форма, лексика и т. д.); - Классификация текстов в чат-ботах для автоматического определения предпочтений пользователя или кнопок меню."},{"instruction":"请详细介绍开封城市的历史。","output":"开封是中国历史上的一个重要城市，其历史源远流长，可以追溯到西周时期。以下是开封城市的历史介绍： 商周时期：公元前14世纪至公元前256年，开封地区属于商周时期的：虞、鄘、陈、宋等诸侯国。 隋唐时期：581年，隋朝建立，开封成为襄阳郡治，设襄阳县，后改为鄭州。唐朝在618年建立后又把郡改为道，将鄭州所在的河南道置开封府，成为了政治和文化中心，此时的开封开始成为世界上最大、最富有的都市之一。唐朝时期，肇兴佛教繁荣，大量寺庙建筑在开封市区内。此后的几百年间，“中都”一呼百应，成为包括宋朝在内的王朝“封禅都城”。 宋代时期：经历了数代王朝的更迭，960年，宋朝建立，将开封定为首都。此时，开封的经济、文化和艺术达到巅峰。同时，开封也成为了世界上最大的城市之一，并开始成为著名的商业中心。宋代的开封城构成有中央都城、外城和承天门三级，形成著名的“金口水”和“七宝塔”等富丽堂皇的建筑。 元明清时期：1279年开始，元朝取代了宋朝，将首都迁往大都（今北京），开封逐渐失去了其地位。在明朝、清朝时期，开封市区内的许多建筑受到了损坏和破坏，但仍然保留了一些古建筑。清朝时期又将郑州府升格为开封府，设有两衙门七县管辖。 现代时期：1912年，中华民国成立后，开封府改名为开封市。20世纪80年代中期，开封城市规划历经数次调整和改变，以适应现代发展的需要。现在的开封城市已成为中原地区的一个重要城市，旅游资源丰富，文化底蕴深厚，是与北京和河南省省会郑州齐名的城市之一。"},{"instruction":"宋朝为什么定都开封？","output":"宋朝为什么选择将首都定在开封，主要是因为以下几个原因： 1. 地理位置优越：开封位于黄河下游平原中心，河南省地势相对平坦，水源丰富，交通便捷，不仅便于对内对外交通，也有很高的军事战略价值。 2. 经济繁荣：开封自古以来就是中国的商业中心之一，而宋代经济更是全球最繁荣的时期之一。开封是东西方贸易和海上丝绸之路的重要节点，贸易活动频繁。同时，河南省农业发达，居民生产积极，城市人口的增加也促进了经济的繁荣。 3. 文化底蕴：开封自古以来就是文化大省，以大量文化人才闻名于世。宋代开封建有许多文化名胜古迹，如王安石为政时在开封設立的著名书院——大中祥符寺书院，有“鸟鸣山谷，走马草堂”的美誉，为宋代士林的重要场所之一。 4. 政治稳定：在宋朝建国之时，仍然面临北方少数民族入侵，军事战争等问题，据说宋太宗赵光义的谋略，为了缓解国内战乱，数度反复，在拒绝了河南、陕西等地的支持后，选择以苏州和开封为新的首都，因开封地位较为重要，历朝历代博集中云集于此，安身栖息最具优势，最终才在这两地之间摆脱了战乱，安定下来。 综上所述，开封在宋代历史中地位十分重要，成为首都的选择有着复杂的因素。开封因其地理位置优越、经济繁荣、文化底蕴和政治稳定而成为宋朝定都的理想之地。"},{"instruction":"前端给后台传输base64图片","output":"前端可以通过以下步骤将base64图片传输给后台： 1. 前端使用FileReader对象将图片文件读取成base64字符串。 \`\`\` var reader = new FileReader(); reader.readAsDataURL(file); reader.onloadend = function() { var base64 = reader.result; // 将base64字符串传递给后台 } \`\`\` 2. 将base64字符串作为参数，通过ajax发送给后台。 \`\`\` .ajax({ url: 'upload.php', type: 'POST', data: { base64: base64 }, success: function(response) { console.log(response); } }); \`\`\` 3. 后台将接收到的base64字符串转成二进制数据流，并保存为图片文件。 \`\`\` base64 = _POST['base64']; base64 = str_replace('data:image/png;base64,', '', base64); base64 = str_replace(' ', '+', base64); data = base64_decode(base64); file = 'image.png'; file_put_contents(file, data); \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"onMounted is called when there is no active component instance to be associated with.

It is helpful in extracting useful information and making sense of large datasets. There are several ways to classify data according to the number of classes, including: 1. Binary Classification: The data is classified into two classes, such as True/False or Yes/No. This type of classification is often used in situations where there are only two possible outcomes or decisions. 2. Multi-class Classification: The data is classified into more than two classes. Examples of multi-class classification include categorizing animals into different species like dogs, cats, birds, etc., or sorting objects based on their shapes, such as circles, squares, and triangles. 3. Multi-label Classification: In this type of classification, data points or objects can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. For example, in a movie recommendation system, a film can be classified into multiple genres (e.g., action, comedy, drama). 4. Hierarchical Classification: The data is classified into a hierarchical structure, where each class can have subclasses or subcategories. This type of classification is useful in cases where there is a natural hierarchy among the categories, such as in taxonomies for biological species or product categorization in an online marketplace. 5. One-vs-rest (OvR) or one-vs-all (OvA) Classification: In this approach, a binary classifier is built for each class in a multi-class problem, distinguishing one class from all other classes. The best classifier for each data point determines the final predicted class. The choice of classification method depends on the problem you are solving, the nature of the data, and any constraints or preferences in your analysis."},{"instruction":"напиши скрипт, который собирает данные при помощи Asyncio Python и Selenium Python, выставляет временные задержки для имитации действия пользователя.","output":"Ниже приведен пример скрипта с использованием Asyncio, Python, и Selenium чтобы собирать данные с веб-сайта и имитировать поведение пользователя с помощью временных задержек. \`\`\`python import asyncio import random from asyncio import Future from asyncio import get_event_loop from asyncio import wait_for from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options from selenium.webdriver.common.desired_capabilities import DesiredCapabilities chrome_options = Options() # Запуск браузера без интерфейса chrome_options.add_argument(\\"--headless\\") chrome_options.add_argument(\\"--start-maximized\\") desired_capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.CHROME.copy() desired_capabilities[\\"acceptInsecureCerts\\"] = True path_to_chromedriver = 'chromedriver' # замените путем до chromedriver на вашем компьютере def random_delay(): return random.uniform(1, 5) # Измените, если необходимо добавить или уменьшить временную задержку async def fetch_page(url): print(f\\"Fetching url: {url}\\") browser = webdriver.Chrome(path_to_chromedriver, options=chrome_options) browser.get(url) # Открывает URL await asyncio.sleep(random_delay()) # Имитация действия пользователя # Здесь можем найти элементы и собрать данные, как вам нужно # Например: some_data = None try: some_data = browser.find_element_by_tag_name(\\"body\\").text except Exception as e: print(f\\"Error while fetching data: {e}\\") finally: browser.quit() # Закрываем браузер return some_data async def main(): urls = [ \\"https://example1.com\\", \\"https://example2.com\\", \\"https://example3.com\\", ] # Change links according to your needs futures = [fetch_page(url) for url in urls] results = await asyncio.gather(*futures) print(results) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": loop = get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(main()) \`\`\` Замените список \`urls\` своими ссылками, а также выполните поиск и сбор данных согласно вашим требованиям.

Max Schramm war ab 1892 Teilhaber der bedeutenden Rechtsanwaltsfirma „Wolffson, Dehn und Schramm“. Er gehörte ab 1904 als Mitglied in der Bürgerschaft zur „Fraktion der Rechten“, ab 1912 war er gewähltes Mitglied im Senat und war von 1925 bis 1928 Zweiter Bürgermeister Hamburgs. Seine Mutter Olga, geborene O’Swald, entstammte ebenfalls einer althamburgischen Kaufmannsfamilie. Der englische Vorname geht zurück auf Olgas Vater Albrecht Percy O’Swald. Ihr Großonkel William Henry O’Swald machte die Firma „Wm. O’Swald &amp; Co“ zum führenden Handelshaus in Ostafrika. Dank einem 1859 geschlossenen Handelsvertrag mit dem Sultan von Sansibar konnten die Geschäfte bis weit in das Innere Afrikas ausgedehnt werden.', 'Als einziger Sohn hatte Schramm zwei jüngere Schwestern. Er wuchs im großbürgerlichen Hamburger Stadtteil Harvestehude auf. Von 1901 bis 1904 besuchte er die private Schule von Adolph Thomsen und anschließend den realgymnasialen Zweig des Johanneums. Die Eltern wollten, dass er als Kaufmann oder Anwalt einen bislang in der Familie üblichen Beruf ergriff. Schramm integrierte sich als Jugendlicher in das gesellschaftliche Leben des gehobenen Hamburger Bürgertums. Die Begeisterung für die Tradition des Großbürgertums veranlasste ihn als Gymnasiasten, sich anhand von Ahnentafeln mit der Vergangenheit zu beschäftigen. Die Nachforschungen über die Herkunft der Vorfahren waren nach Schramms Aussage entscheidend für sein Interesse an Geschichte. Noch im Elternhaus lernte er den Kulturwissenschaftler Aby Warburg kennen und wurde sein Schüler. Warburg und Schramms kulturell interessierter Vater hatten sich über dieselben gesellschaftlichen Kreise in Hamburg kennengelernt. Mit Schramm stand Warburg seit 1911 in engem Kontakt. Über Art und Umfang der Ausbildung lassen die Quellen nur wenige Schlüsse zu. Warburg förderte Schramm bei seinen genealogischen Studien und ließ ihm den notwendigen Freiraum zur geistigen Entwicklung. Er gewährte Schramm freien Zugang zu der von ihm aufgebauten Privatbibliothek.', 'Neben der Verbindung zu Warburg begann Schramm in den Jahren vor dem Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges, auch das Mittelalter für sich zu entdecken. Förderlich dafür waren zahlreiche Reisen und Besuche von Burgen, Kirchen und Städten. Bereits als Sechzehnjähriger hatte er die zuerst 1909 erschienene, sehr beliebte „Kaisergeschichte im Zeitalter der Salier und Staufer“ von Karl Hampe „verschlungen“. Mit siebzehn Jahren war Schramm entschlossen, Historiker zu werden. Bereits seit 1910 nahm er freiwillig Privatunterricht in Griechisch. Aus seinen Kindheitsjahren nahm Schramm den Stolz auf seine Herkunft, das Traditionsbewusstsein und ein hohes Maß an Selbstvertrauen mit.', 'Kriegsdienst und Fronteinsatz.', 'Im August 1913 legte Schramm am Realgymnasium das Abitur ab. Im April 1914 begann er an der Universität Freiburg i. Br. das Geschichtsstudium. Im selben Jahr veröffentlichte er die Ergebnisse seiner genealogischen Studien im fünften Band des „Hamburger Geschlechterbuches“. Nach einem Semester musste er wegen des Kriegsausbruchs das Studium unterbrechen. Am 3. August 1914 meldete er sich mit 19 Jahren als Kriegsfreiwilliger zum Militärdienst. Er hielt sich überwiegend an der Ostfront auf. Durch eine Verwundung des linken Unterarmes am 15. Mai 1915 war er für ein Vierteljahr felddienstunfähig. Eine lange, fast einjährige Ruhephase ab Spätsommer 1916 nutzte Schramm für seine Weiterbildung – er erlernte die italienische Sprache – und für seine genealogischen Studien. Während des Krieges hielt er engen Briefkontakt zu seinem Lehrer Warburg. Im Juni 1916 wurde Schramm zum Leutnant befördert und im September 1917 nahm seine Abteilung an der Eroberung Rigas teil. Für den erfolgreichen Vormarsch Anfang 1918 wurde ihm das Eiserne Kreuz I. Klasse verliehen. Nach dem Frieden von Brest-Litowsk am 3. März 1918 wurde Schramms Einheit an die Westfront nach Frankreich verlegt.', 'Dem Ersten Weltkrieg wies Schramm in seinen unveröffentlichten biografischen Aufzeichnungen zum Jahrgang 1894 wesentliche Bedeutung für seine Persönlichkeitsentwicklung zu. Er gefiel sich in seinem militärischen Rang als Rittmeister, dessen Stellung in der Kavallerie soziales Ansehen anzeigte, und kokettierte mit diesem Dienstgrad noch bis in die Zeit des Zweiten Weltkrieges. Das Kriegserlebnis an der Ostfront hinterließ bei ihm ein antipolnisches Ressentiment und eine aus dem unmittelbaren Erleben der Oktoberrevolution im Baltikum gespeiste „Furcht vor einem kommunistischen Umsturz“. Die Kriegserfahrungen stifteten einen Generationszusammenhang: Die Männer der Zwischenkriegszeit wurden von den Zeitgenossen nach Generationen gegliedert. Schramm gehörte zur „jungen Frontgeneration“ der zwischen 1890 und 1900 Geborenen und fühlte sich durch den Kriegsdienst als Angehöriger einer besonderen Generation.', 'Studienjahre in Hamburg und München.', 'Nach Kriegsende kehrte Schramm im Dezember 1918 nach Hamburg zurück. Er kümmerte sich um seinen Lehrer Warburg, bei dem nach Bekanntwerden der Niederlage eine schwere psychische Krankheit ausbrach. Schramm bekannte sich ausdrücklich zur Weimarer Republik, allerdings bestärkten die Gebietsabtretungen im Osten „eine Tendenz zu nationalistischer Radikalisierung“ in ihm. Er stellte sich der Regierung als Zeitfreiwilliger im Freikorps Bahrenfeld zur Verfügung. Ob gegen links, gegen Polen oder „sonst jemand“, war ihm gleich. Ab dem Sommersemester 1919 studierte Schramm Geschichte, historische Hilfswissenschaften, Kunstgeschichte und Staatsrecht an der Hamburgischen Universität. Schramm gehörte zu den ersten Studenten der neu gegründeten Universität in Hamburg. An der Niederschlagung der sogenannten Sülzeunruhen in Hamburg Ende Juni 1919 war Schramm aber nicht beteiligt, da er im Sommer Hamburg verlassen und in Marburg sein Studium fortgesetzt hatte. Anlässlich des Kapp-Putsches im März 1920 begann Schramm ein Tagebuch über die ihn bewegenden Ereignisse zu führen. Den Putsch lehnte er vor allem deshalb ab, weil Kapp seinen Treueid gegenüber der Regierung gebrochen hatte. Seine tagebuchähnlichen Aufzeichnungen publizierte Schramm wenig später.', 'Ab dem Sommersemester 1920 studierte Schramm in München, um seine Kenntnisse in der Kunstwissenschaft zu erweitern. Dort besuchte er mehrere Lehrveranstaltungen bei dem Kunsthistoriker Heinrich Wölfflin. Nach der Kriegsniederlage und der Neuordnung der staatlichen Strukturen in Deutschland standen bei vielen Intellektuellen die Fragen nach dem Besonderen der deutschen Kunst und nach dem „Wesen des Staates“ im Vordergrund. Diese Fragen beschäftigten auch Schramm sehr. Seit 1920 wandte er sich dem Mittelalter zu. Dabei beeindruckte ihn das Widmungsbild im Reichenauer Evangeliar Ottos III. stark. Das Bild inspirierte ihn wenig später sogar zum Thema seiner Doktorarbeit, in der er das „Wesen“ des von Otto geführten „Staates“ erfassen wollte.', 'Der Gesundheitszustand Warburgs besserte sich während Schramms Aufenthalt in München nicht. 1920 begab sich Warburg in Begleitung Schramms nach Jena zur weiteren Behandlung. Auch in den Folgejahren erfreute sich Schramm besonderer Wertschätzung bei Warburg. Eine maßgebliche Rolle in der Warburg-Bibliothek spielte fortan Fritz Saxl. Er begann die Bibliothek jungen Wissenschaftlern der Universität Hamburg zugänglich zu machen. Im Jahr 1913 waren sich Schramm und Saxl in der Hamburger Bibliothek von Aby Warburg erstmals persönlich begegnet. In den 1920er Jahren bekam Schramm von kaum jemand anderem mehr menschliche und wissenschaftliche Impulse als von Saxl. Auch zu dem Kunsthistoriker Erwin Panofsky bestand eine freundschaftliche Verbindung. Neben Saxl und Warburg hatte der Historiker Otto Westphal erheblichen Einfluss auf Schramms wissenschaftliches Denken.', 'Wissenschaftliche Anfänge in Heidel: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Percy Ernst Schramm, Deutscher Historiker, Hanseatische Kultur, Nationalsozialismus, Mittelalterforschung, Kriegstagebuch, Herkunft und Jugend, Kriegsdienst, Studium, Warburg-Bibliothek."},{"instruction":"A has 2928 row and 1 column, I want to separate every 24 row from column 1 and put it in matrix B column 1 and two continuously to the end. write code for matlab.","output":"Assuming the 2928 rows are stored in a column vector A, you can use the reshape function to create a 24-by-122 matrix B and then transpose it to get a 122-by-24 matrix.

Der Zugang erfolgte über ein Treppentürmchen am vorderen südlichen Vorzeichen. Die Blasebälge befanden sich vermutlich über dem Seitenschiff in einer Kammer. Die Orgel wurde wahrscheinlich als Blockwerk und mit getrennt spielbarem Prinzipal gebaut. Bei den nachfolgenden Bauarbeiten in St. Martin musste sie nicht verändert werden. Der Chronist Jakob Friederich Unold berichtet, dass die Orgel erstmals 1478 im Gottesdienst gespielt wurde.', 'Erster Kantor war vermutlich Friedrich Rebmann aus Mainz. 1500 stellte die Stadt bis auf Widerruf den Organisten Albrecht Fischer ein, der für die Orgeln in St. Martin und in der zweiten Stadtpfarrkirche, Unser Frauen, zuständig war. Er wurde jeweils zum Quatember mit zwölf Pfund und zehn Schillingen besoldet, musste aber die Kalkanten selbst bezahlen. 1528 wurde die Orgel im Zuge der Reformation in Memmingen, die in dieser Zeit an Ulrich Zwingli und dessen reformatorischem Bildersturm orientiert war, entfernt. Die evangelischen Geistlichen von St. Martin wollten den Gottesdienst aber wieder mit Orgelmusik gestalten, weshalb 1568 man sich mit einem Positiv behalf. Dessen damaliger Standort ist nicht bekannt.', 'Neubau durch Andreas Schneider 1598/1599.', 'Seit dem Bildersturm in der Reformationszeit existierte in der Reichsstadt Memmingen keine repräsentative Orgel mehr. Nachdem sich die Pfarrer der beiden Stadtpfarrkirchen seit 1550 immer wieder vergeblich für die Anschaffung eines neuen, großen Instruments eingesetzt hatten, lenkte der Rat 1597, unter dessen Herrschaft die Kirchen seit der Reformation standen, ein. Er beauftragte Andreas Schneider aus der Niederlausitz, der in Ulm als Orgelbauer tätig war, mit dem Bau einer neuen Orgel. Schneider, der mit seinen Gesellen während der Bauzeit 1598/1599 in der Stadt wohnte, erhielt für seine Arbeit 5.000 Gulden. Die Orgel wurde auf dem Schwalbennest ihrer Vorgängerin aufgestellt. Das Gehäuse war reich vergoldet und mit Schnitzwerk und vielen Engelsköpfen verziert. Auf dem Mittelturm trug das Gehäuse eine Statue des Königs David, die heute auf der Brüstung der Goll-Orgel steht. Auf den Deckeln des Orgelgehäuses befanden sich Bildnisse der Bürgermeister Hartlieb, Keller und Funk, des Pfarrhofpflegers und mehrerer anderer Personen. Die Bemalungen waren vermutlich an den Brüstungsfeldern des Rückpositivs befestigt. Die Flügeltüren trugen alttestamentliche Bildnisse.', 'Nach der Fertigstellung bezeichnete der fuggersche Hoforganist Hans Leo Haßler am 21. November 1599 die Orgel „als gelungen“. Zwei Jahre später wurden allerdings Fehler festgestellt, die von Schneider behoben werden konnten. 1681 reparierte Johannes Riegg die Orgel. In einer Prospektpfeife war folgende Inschrift zu lesen: „Johannes Riegg, Orgelmacher und Organist daselbst, das Orgelwerk zu Memmingen renov. den 1. Heumonat 1681“. Riegg nahm vermutlich keine Änderungen am Klang vor und reparierte lediglich die Technik, wobei er das Instrument allerdings mehr demolierte als reparierte. Die damalige Disposition ist nicht erhalten. Im Vergleich mit anderen Werken Rieggs, vor allem dem im Ulmer Münster und den späteren Überarbeitungen war sie vermutlich wie folgt aufgebaut:', '1656 baute Stadtbaumeister Knoll zwischen dem Triumphbogen am Choreingang und dem ersten Pfeilerpaar eine brücken- beziehungsweise lettnerartige Empore ein, vermutlich als Ort für Sänger und Instrumentalisten, die allein oder zusammen mit der Orgel musizierten, da das Schwalbennest nicht den Platz für eine größere Anzahl von Personen bot. Auch für die Aufführungspraxis der zu dieser Zeit beliebten mehrchörigen Musik lag es nahe, Musiker auf mehrere Emporen zu verteilen. Auf dieser Empore stand bis 1827 auch eine kleine Orgel, die später in die Kinderlehrkirche gebracht und dort bis 1874 verwendet wurde. Sie war wahrscheinlich vom Orgelbaumeister Siegmund Riegg angefertigt worden.', 'Die Disposition war:', 'Reparatur durch Gabler 1759.', 'Nach Rieggs mangelhafter Instandsetzung wurde 1758 Joseph Gabler beauftragt, eine erneute Reparatur durchzuführen, diese dauerte 15 Monate. Gabler überholte auch die Orgeln in der Lateinschule und im \\"Collegium musicum\\". Alle drei Instandsetzungen waren insgesamt mit 400 Gulden veranschlagt worden, am Ende kosteten sie 1.500 Gulden, von denen die Stadt 1.080 bezahlte. Zwei Monate später zahlte der Rat auf Bitten Gablers weitere 30 Gulden. Bei der Instandsetzung wurde die Disposition modernisiert, indem Gabler seine typischen Klangelemente einfügte. Im Stadtarchiv ist dazu zu lesen: „Er hat die Orgel wohl repariert und in vollkommenen Stand gestellt, daß man darob ein seltsames Vergnügen gefunden.“ Johann Nepomuk Holzhey überholte die Orgel zuletzt 1778 für 433 Gulden. Nachdem Memmingen 1802 die Reichsfreiheit verloren hatte und 1803 dem Kurfürstentum Bayern einverleibt worden war, gelangte auch St. Martin kirchenrechtlich zum Kurfürstentum. ', '1807 untersuchten der Organist Johann Konrad Ellmer, der Orgelbauer Georg Rabus und der Musikdirektor der Stadt, Georg von Unold, die große Orgel und kamen zu dem Ergebnis, dass sie reparaturbedürftig war. Für eine notdürftige Reparatur errechneten sie einen Betrag von 18, für eine umfangreiche Instandsetzung 140 Gulden, was jedoch beides aus Kostengründen abgelehnt wurde. Nachdem das Schwalbennest immer baufälliger geworden war, entschloss sich die Kirchengemeinde 1827, es aufzugeben. Es wurde im selben Jahr zurückgebaut und die Orgel durch Meinrad Dreher aus Illereichen an die Westwand des Hauptschiffes versetzt. Dreher reparierte dabei das komplette Instrument, fügte die beiden neuen Rohrwerke Bombard 16′ und Clairon 4′ hinzu und entfernte die beiden Tremulanten, das Sperrventil und die von Gabler eingebaute Manualkoppel. Die Blasebälge wurden geflickt und ungünstig unter dem Dach des Seitenschiffs aufgestellt. Die Kosten für Versetzung und Reparatur betrugen 1.200 Gulden. Am 26. Januar 1828 wurde die Orgel erstmals wieder bespielt, hatte an ihrem neuen Standort aber nicht mehr den Klang wie im Schwalbennest. Das Gehäuse musste neu gebaut werden. Teile des alten Prospekts wurden in eine barocke Kassettendecke im Schloss Illerfeld in Volkratshofen eingebaut. Nach der Überarbeitung hatte die Orgel folgende Disposition:', 'Umbau durch Samuel Friedrich Schäfer 1845.', '1845 wurde die Orgel an der Westwand durch Samuel Friedrich Schäfer aus Wolfschlugen umgebaut. Zwischen dem 15. April und dem 25. Mai 1845 diente ein Positiv zum kirchlichen Gebrauch. Der neugotische Prospekt der umgebauten Orgel, die im Sommer 1847 fertiggestellt wurde, bestand aus zwei Gehäuseteilen mit je drei spitzbogigen Pfeifenfeldern, die seitlich von der Fensterwand von innen nach außen abfallend gruppiert waren. Das Instrument war allerdings unbrauchbar, da Schäfer die wiederverwendeten alten Register und die neu entwickelten Kegelladen nicht fachgerecht zusammengebaut hatte. Der Umbau kostete 4.800 Gulden für die Orgel und 400 Gulden für die Blasebalgkammer.', 'Die Disposition war wie folgt gegliedert:', 'Neubau durch Walcker und Spaich 1853.', '1853 wurde eine neue Orgel angeschafft. Das neugotische Gehäuse und die Orgel wurden von der Orgelbauwerkstatt aus Ludwigsburg gebaut, die schon kurz vorher eine neue Orgel für die Frauenkirche angefertigt hatte. Bei der Orgelprobe am 11. Juli 1853 bezeichnete der Augsburger Kapellmeister Karl Ludwig Drobisch das Instrument als „vollkommen gelungen und meisterhaft“. Die Empore musste für die neue Orgel, die 5.700 Gulden kostete, vergrößert werden. Das alte Werk nahm Walcker in Zahlung. Mit der neuen Orgel kam die Orgelmusik in der Kirche wieder in das Blickfeld der Öffentlichkeit. Das Instrument wurde 1900 von Steinmeyer repariert und ein neues Gebläse eingebaut.', 'Die Orgel hatte folgende Disposition:', 'Erweiterung durch Ott 1938.', 'Die 1924 geplante Erweiterung der Walckerorgel wurde 1938 von Paul Ott aus Göttingen umgesetzt. Hauptwerk, Schwellwerk und Pedal hatten Kegelladen, das neue Rückpositiv hatte Schleifladen. Die Steuerung erfolgte durch eine elektrische Traktur. Der Prospekt musste durch die Erweiterung verändert werden. Die neugotischen Aufbauten wurden zugunsten eines Freipfeifenprospekts aufgegeben. Auf einer Einbauempore befanden sich links und rechts je drei Pfeifenfelder, die von außen nach innen abfielen. Die Mitte wurde freigehalten, sodass die doppelten Emporenfenster sichtbar waren. Hinter den Manualwerken standen die Pedalpfeifen nach C- und Cis-Lade geteilt, der Größe nach von innen nach außen absteigend. Unter der Empore war das Rückpositiv, das drei Pfeifengruppen in Form eines W beinhaltete, mittig in die Brüstung eingelassen.', 'Die Disposition war nach dem Umbau wie folgt gegliedert:', 'Neubau durch Walcker 1962.', 'Nachdem sich die Kirchengemeinde ein größeres Instrument wünschte, begann man Anfang der 1960er Jahre mit Planungen für eine neue Orgel. 1962 beauftragte die Gemeinde die Firma Walcker aus Ludwigsburg eine neue Orgel an dem bisherigen Standort an der Westwand zu errichten. Die dahinterliegenden großen Fenster wurden dafür zugemauert. Die alte Orgel einschließlich Prospekt wurde entfernt und zerstört. Der neue Prospekt gliederte sich in 14 rechteckige Pfeifenfelder, die in Kästen eingeschlossen waren, und drei Lamellenfelder für den Schwellkasten.

Dieser vergleichsweise kleine Vertreter der Unterfamilie der Aquilinae hat ein relativ kleines Verbreitungsgebiet im Westen der Paläarktis; die westliche Arealgrenze verläuft durch den Osten Deutschlands. Das Epitheton \\"pomarina\\" bezieht sich auf die Herkunft des Holotypus aus der ehemaligen preußischen Provinz Pommern. Die Art bewohnt naturnahe Wälder mit angrenzenden extensiv genutzten Flächen und ernährt sich vor allem von kleinen Wirbeltieren, aber auch von Insekten und anderen Wirbellosen sowie Aas.', 'Die Art ist vor allem durch ihre besondere Brutbiologie bekannt, den Kainismus. Meist werden zwei Eier gelegt; das zuerst geschlüpfte Junge tötet jedoch grundsätzlich das jüngere Geschwister, so dass außer in seltenen Ausnahmefällen immer nur ein Jungvogel ausfliegt.', 'Der Schreiadler ist ein Zugvogel, er überwintert im südlichen Afrika. Der Weltbestand ist ungefährdet, der deutsche Bestand ist jedoch rückläufig und gilt laut Roter Liste als vom Aussterben bedroht.', 'Beschreibung.', 'Schreiadler gehören zu den kleinsten Vertretern der Unterfamilie der Aquilinae. Sie erreichen eine Körperlänge von 55 bis 67 cm und eine Flügelspannweite von 1,46 bis 1,68 m und sind damit immer noch deutlich größer als beispielsweise ein Mäusebussard. Der Geschlechtsdimorphismus ist bezüglich Größe und Gewicht recht deutlich ausgeprägt, Männchen erreichen im Mittel etwa 85 % der Größe der Weibchen. Männchen wiegen 1,0 bis 1,4 kg und haben eine Flügellänge von 446 bis 478 mm, Weibchen erreichen ein Gewicht von 1,3 bis 2,2 kg und eine Flügellänge von 493 bis 508 mm. Wie bei allen Vertretern der Gattung \\"Clanga\\" und der nahe verwandten Gattung \\"Aquila\\" sind die Handschwingenspitzen stark gefingert, und die Beine sind bis zu den Zehen befiedert. Im Flug wirken die Flügel relativ kurz und auffallend breit, der Schwanz ist an den Außenkanten deutlich gerundet.', 'Adulte Vögel sind insgesamt braun gefärbt. Der Rumpf, der Kopf sowie die Oberflügel- und die Unterflügeldecken sind warm hellbraun, teilweise heller gelblich-braun. Sie bilden vor allem beim fliegenden Vogel einen deutlichen Kontrast zu den einfarbig dunkelgrau-braunen Schwung- und Steuerfedern. Die Basen der inneren Handschwingen sind weißlich und bilden auf dem Oberflügel ein nicht sehr auffallendes weißes Feld, die Oberschwanzdecken sind breit weiß gerandet. Die Iris ist orangegelb, die Wachshaut und die Zehen haben eine gelbe Färbung. Die Schnabelbasis ist grau gegen den im Übrigen schwarzen Schnabel abgesetzt.', 'Im Jugendkleid sind Kopf, Rumpf und Flügeldecken insgesamt dunkler als bei den Altvögeln. Die großen Hand- und Armdecken sind weiß gerandet und bilden ein beim fliegenden Vogel gut sichtbares helles Band auf dem Oberflügel. Häufig sind auch die mittleren Flügeldecken schwach weiß gerandet. Die Schwingen und die Steuerfedern zeigen eine dichte dunkle Querbänderung; die inneren Handschwingen, die Armschwingen und die Steuerfedern sind ebenfalls weiß gerandet. Im Nacken zeigen junge Schreiadler einen rostgelben diffusen Fleck. Die Iris ist braun. Die Jungvögel sind nach drei Jahren ausgefärbt.', 'Lautäußerungen.', 'Der bis zum Schlupf der Jungvögel häufig zu hörende Erregungsruf ist ein kräftiges „tjück“, das auch mit „jück“ oder „jüb“ wiedergegeben wird und meist zwei- bis dreimal hintereinander ertönt. Beim Balzflug ruft das Männchen „wiiik“, der Ruf ähnelt einem langen Pfiff. Die Rufe der Jungvögel ähneln bereits im Alter von etwa 20 Tagen weitgehend denen der adulten Tiere.', 'Verbreitung.', 'Der Schreiadler hat ein relativ kleines, stark zergliedertes Verbreitungsgebiet im Westen der Paläarktis. Im Norden des Artareals verläuft die westliche Verbreitungsgrenze durch Nordostdeutschland, nach Osten reicht das Vorkommen bis in den Westen Russlands, die genaue östliche Verbreitungsgrenze ist bisher nicht bekannt. Im Süden liegen die westlichsten, isolierten Vorkommen in Slowenien und Kroatien; weiter nach Osten folgt ein relativ geschlossenes Verbreitungsgebiet, das von Griechenland und dem Osten des Balkans über die Türkei bis in die Kaspische Senke im Norden des Iran reicht. Im Norden reicht die Verbreitung bis zur russischen Ostseeküste, im Süden bis Mittelgriechenland, bis zum Süden der Türkei und bis in den oben erwähnten Norden des Iran.', 'In Deutschland sind die Osthälfte Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns und ein etwa 3600 km² großes Gebiet im Nordosten Brandenburgs (Landkreise Barnim, Uckermark und Oberhavel) besiedelt.

In Sachsen-Anhalt ist der Schreiadler seit 2012 ausgestorben.', 'Systematik.', 'Bis vor einigen Jahren wurde für den Schreiadler neben der Nominatform eine zweite, nur auf den Indischen Subkontinent beschränkte Unterart \\"Aquila pomarina hastata\\" beschrieben. Diese Unterart wurde 2002 aufgrund morphologischer, anatomischer und brutbiologischer Merkmale sowie aufgrund von Verhaltensmerkmalen als eigene Art \\"Aquila hastata\\" (neuerdings \\"Clanga hastata\\") abgegrenzt, die 2009 den deutschen Trivialnamen Gangesadler erhielt. Molekulargenetische Untersuchungen haben diesen Artstatus bestätigt, demnach bildet der Gangesadler das Schwestertaxon des Artenpaares Schreiadler und Schelladler. Der Schreiadler ist demnach also mit dem Schelladler enger verwandt als mit dem Gangesadler.', 'Eine weitere molekulargenetische Untersuchung ergab, dass Schreiadler und Schelladler reproduktiv nicht vollständig voneinander isoliert sind, wobei der Genfluss jedoch offenbar nur in Richtung Schreiadler erfolgt. Etwa 8 % der untersuchten phänotypischen Schreiadler wiesen in der nur über die mütterliche Linie weitergegebenen mitochondrialen DNA (mtDNA) Haplotypen des Schelladlers auf. Untersuchungen der Zellkern-DNA ergaben jedoch, dass die Schreiadler mit Schelladlerhaplotypen in der mtDNA genetisch zwischen den Stichproben von Individuen beider Arten liegen, bei denen die Haplotypen der mtDNA mit den Phänotypen übereinstimmten. Das deutet darauf hin, dass diese Schreiadler mit Schelladler-mtDNA entweder direkte Nachkommen eines Mischpaares aus Schelladlerweibchen und Schreiadlermännchen (F1-Hybriden) oder Nachkommen eines weiblichen Hybriden mit einem Schreiadlermännchen sind.', 'Die Ergebnisse lassen vermuten, dass Mischpaare überwiegend aus Schelladlerweibchen und Schreiadlermännchen bestehen und dass die Hybridweibchen ihrerseits wiederum mit Schreiadlermännchen brüten. Die erste Vermutung stimmt mit den bisher vorliegenden Beobachtungen von Mischpaaren überein; die zweite Vermutung ist plausibel, da nur so der Größenunterschied zwischen den Paarpartnern gewährleistet ist. Der relativ hohe Prozentsatz von Schreiadlern mit Schelladlerhaplotypen weist schließlich darauf hin, dass zumindest einzelne Schelladler regelmäßig weit westlich des geschlossenen Verbreitungsgebietes der Art Mischpaare mit Schreiadlern bilden. Dass dies tatsächlich so ist, wurde unter anderem durch die Entdeckung eines Mischpaares in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern im Jahr 2003 bestätigt, weiter östlich sind einzelne Mischpaare schon seit Anfang der 1990er-Jahre bekannt.', 'Lebensraum.', 'Schreiadler bewohnen naturnahe Wälder mit angrenzenden offenen, nahrungsreichen Flächen. Im Norden des Verbreitungsgebietes (Deutschland, Polen, Baltikum, Russland) werden extensiv genutzte, feuchte Niederungen mit Laub- und Mischwäldern und angrenzenden Feuchtwiesen und Mooren besiedelt. Etwa ab der Slowakei und Ungarn und weiter südlich liegt der Schwerpunkt der Vorkommen jedoch im locker mit Laubwald bestockten und mit Wiesen durchsetzten, meist trockenen Hügel- und Bergland. So werden z. B. in Rumänien Höhenlagen zwischen 300 m und 1600 m besiedelt, auch in Bulgarien kommt die Art bis in 1400 m Höhe vor.', 'Im Bereich der südlichen Verbreitungsgrenze im Wald von Dadia im Nordosten Griechenlands bewohnt der Schreiadler schließlich fast ausschließlich trockene Kiefernwälder in Höhen zwischen 100 und 300 m, Laubwälder werden dort gemieden.', 'Raumnutzung und Siedlungsdichte.', 'In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern und in Lettland wurden 1994 bis 1997 Untersuchungen zur Größe des Aktionsraumes während der Brutzeit mit Hilfe von Bodentelemetriesendern durchgeführt. Männchen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern hatten einen Aktionsraum von im Mittel 27,1 km² (22,2–33,9 km²), die Aktionsräume von Männchen in Lettland waren mit im Mittel 11,4 km² (6,7–15,5 km²) erheblich kleiner. Der Unterschied wurde in erster Linie auf den größeren Anteil nahrungsreicher Habitate (vor allem Grünland) im Nestumfeld der lettischen Reviere zurückgeführt.', 'Bei vier in den Jahren 2004–2006 mit GPS-Satellitensendern versehenen Männchen in Brandenburg und Mecklenburg-Vorpommern waren die Aktionsräume während der Brutzeit zwischen 32,8 und 54,4 km² groß; diese Vögel wurden jedoch erst ab Mitte Juli besendert, so dass die Aktionsräume vermutlich nicht vollständig erfasst wurden. Bei einem fünften Männchen, das 2005 ab Ende Juni und 2006 ab Anfang Mai untersucht wurde, war der Aktionsraum 2005 93,8 km² groß, 2006 sogar 172,3 km².', 'Die Siedlungsdichte des Schreiadlers schwankt in Abhängigkeit von landschaftlichen Gegebenheiten erheblich. In Polen wurden bei großflächigen Untersuchungen Siedlungsdichten zwischen 1,5 und 10,8 Brutpaaren (BP) pro 100 km² ermittelt, der höchste Wert wurde im Białowieża-Nationalpark festgestellt.

Lebensjahr (1889) litt er unter zunehmenden psychischen Störungen, die ihn arbeits- und geschäftsunfähig machten. Seinen Anfang der 1890er Jahre einsetzenden Ruhm erlebte er nicht mehr bewusst. Den Rest seines Lebens verbrachte er als Pflegefall in der Obhut zunächst seiner Mutter, dann seiner Schwester, und starb 1900 im Alter von 55 Jahren. Die Vermutung, die Spätfolgen einer Syphilis könnten beim Krankheitsverlauf eine Rolle gespielt haben, hielt sich gut 100 Jahre.', 'Später kamen in Fachkreisen jedoch zunehmend Zweifel an dieser Verdachtsdiagnose auf.', 'Neuere Auswertungen von Nietzsches Krankenakte kommen zum Ergebnis, dass eine Erkrankung wie CADASIL ebenso zu seiner geistigen Verwirrung am Lebensende geführt haben könnte.', 'Den jungen Nietzsche beeindruckte besonders die Philosophie Schopenhauers. Später wandte er sich von dessen Pessimismus ab. Sein Werk enthält scharfe Kritiken an Moral, Religion, Philosophie, Wissenschaft und Formen der Kunst. Die zeitgenössische Kultur war in seinen Augen lebensschwächer als die des antiken Griechenlands. Wiederkehrendes Ziel von Nietzsches Angriffen sind vor allem die christliche Moral sowie die christliche und platonistische Metaphysik. Er stellte den Wert der Wahrheit überhaupt in Frage und wurde damit Wegbereiter postmoderner philosophischer Ansätze. Auch Nietzsches Konzepte des „Übermenschen“, des „Willens zur Macht“ oder der „ewigen Wiederkunft“ geben Anlass zu Deutungen und Diskussionen.', 'Nietzsche schuf keine systematische Philosophie. Oft wählte er den Aphorismus als Ausdrucksform seiner Gedanken. Seine Prosa, seine Gedichte und der pathetisch-lyrische Stil von \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\" verschafften ihm Anerkennung auch als Schriftsteller.', 'Leben.', 'Jugend (1844–1869).', 'Friedrich Nietzsche wurde am 15. Oktober 1844 in Röcken, einem Dorf nahe Lützen im Kreis Merseburg in der preußischen Provinz Sachsen (heute Sachsen-Anhalt), geboren. Seine Eltern waren der lutherische Pfarrer Carl Ludwig Nietzsche und dessen Frau Franziska, Tochter des Pfarrers David Ernst Oehler von Pobles. Seit der Reformation im 16. Jahrhundert ist die Familie Nietzsche in Sachsen als evangelisch dokumentiert. In den Familien beider Elternteile gab es einen hohen Anteil protestantischer Pfarrer. Seinen Vornamen gab ihm sein Vater zu Ehren des preußischen Königs Friedrich Wilhelm IV., an dessen 49. Geburtstag er geboren wurde. Nietzsche selbst behauptete in seinen späten Jahren, in väterlicher Linie von polnischen Edelleuten abzustammen, was jedoch nicht bestätigt werden konnte.', 'Die Schwester Elisabeth kam 1846 zur Welt. Nach dem Tod des Vaters 1849 und des jüngeren Bruders Ludwig Joseph (1848–1850) zog die Familie nach Naumburg. Der spätere Justizrat Bernhard Dächsel wurde formal zum Vormund der Geschwister Friedrich und Elisabeth bestellt.', 'Von 1850 bis 1856 lebte Nietzsche im „Naumburger Frauenhaushalt“, das heißt zusammen mit Mutter, Schwester, Großmutter, zwei unverheirateten Tanten väterlicherseits und dem Dienstmädchen. Erst die Hinterlassenschaft der 1856 verstorbenen Großmutter erlaubte der Mutter, für sich und ihre Kinder eine eigene Wohnung zu mieten. Der junge Nietzsche besuchte zunächst die allgemeine Knabenschule, fühlte sich dort allerdings so isoliert, dass man ihn auf eine Privatschule schickte, wo er erste Jugendfreundschaften mit Gustav Krug und Wilhelm Pinder, beide aus angesehenen Häusern, knüpfte. Ab 1854 besuchte er das Domgymnasium Naumburg und fiel bereits dort durch seine besondere musische und sprachliche Begabung auf. 1857 bereitete Pastor Gustav Adolf Oßwald, ein enger Freund seines Vaters, ihn in Kirchscheidungen für die Aufnahmeprüfung in Schulpforta vor. Am 5. Oktober 1858 wurde Nietzsche als Stipendiat in die Landesschule Pforta aufgenommen, wo er als bleibende Freunde Paul Deussen und Carl Freiherr von Gersdorff kennenlernte. Seine schulischen Leistungen waren sehr gut, in seiner Freizeit dichtete und komponierte er. In Schulpforta entwickelte sich zum ersten Mal seine eigene Vorstellung von der Antike und, damit einhergehend, eine Distanz zur kleinbürgerlich-christlichen Welt seiner Familie. In dieser Zeit lernte Nietzsche den älteren, einstmals politisch engagierten Dichter Ernst Ortlepp kennen, dessen Persönlichkeit den vaterlosen Knaben beeindruckte. Von Nietzsche besonders geschätzte Lehrer, mit denen er nach seiner Schulzeit noch in Verbindung blieb, waren Wilhelm Corssen, der spätere Rektor Diederich Volkmann und Max Heinze, der 1897, als Nietzsche entmündigt war, zu dessen Vormund bestellt wurde. Corssen hatte sich auch vor dem Kollegium dafür eingesetzt, dass Nietzsche, trotz einer schlechten Note in Mathematik, sein Abitur erhielt, indem er auf dessen besondere Begabung in den alten Sprachen und Deutsch verwies.', 'Gemeinsam mit seinen Freunden Pinder und Krug traf sich Nietzsche ab 1860 auf der Burgruine Schönburg, wo er mit ihnen über Literatur, Philosophie, Musik und Sprache diskutierte. Mit ihnen gründete er dort die künstlerisch-literarische Vereinigung „Germania“. Die Gründungsfeier fand am 25. Juli 1860 statt: „… bei Naumburger Rotwein (die Flasche zu 75 Pfennige) leisteten die drei sechzehnjährigen Vereinsmitglieder ihren Bundesschwur. Gedichte, Kompositionen, Abhandlungen mußten regelmäßig geliefert werden. Man wollte dann gemeinsam darüber diskutieren.“ Die Versammlungen fanden vierteljährlich statt. Auf ihnen wurden Vorträge gehalten. Es gab eine Gemeinschaftskasse, aus der Bücher beschafft wurden. Bereits in dieser Zeit entwickelte Nietzsche seine Leidenschaft für die Musik Richard Wagners. Zu Nietzsches frühen Werken, die vor dem Hintergrund der Schönburger Germania entstanden sind, zählen die \\"Synodenvorträge\\", \\"Kindheit der Völker\\", \\"Fatum und Geschichte\\" sowie \\"Über das Dämonische in der Musik\\". 1863 wurde die \\"Germania\\" aufgelöst, nachdem Pinder und Krug ihr Interesse daran verloren hatten.', 'Im Wintersemester 1864/65 begann Nietzsche an der Universität Bonn das Studium der klassischen Philologie und der evangelischen Theologie unter anderem bei Wilhelm Ludwig Krafft. Zusammen mit Deussen wurde er Mitglied der Bonner Burschenschaft Frankonia. Er bestritt freiwillig eine Mensur, von welcher er einen Schmiss auf dem Nasenrücken zurückbehielt. Nach einem Jahr verließ er die Burschenschaft, weil ihm das Verbindungsleben missfiel. Neben seinem Studium vertiefte er sich in die Werke der Junghegelianer, darunter \\"Das Leben Jesu\\" von David Friedrich Strauß, \\"Das Wesen des Christentums\\" von Ludwig Feuerbach und Bruno Bauers Evangelienkritiken. Diese bestärkten ihn (zur großen Enttäuschung seiner Mutter) in dem Entschluss, das Theologiestudium nach einem Semester abzubrechen.', 'Nietzsche wollte sich nun ganz auf die klassische Philologie konzentrieren, war jedoch mit seiner Lage in Bonn unzufrieden. Daher nahm er den Wechsel des Philologieprofessors Friedrich Ritschl nach Leipzig (in Folge des Bonner Philologenstreits) zum Anlass, zusammen mit seinem Freund Gersdorff ebenfalls nach Leipzig zu ziehen. In den folgenden Jahren sollte Nietzsche zu Ritschls philologischem Musterschüler werden, obwohl er in Bonn noch dessen Konkurrenten Otto Jahn zugeneigt war. Ritschl war für Nietzsche zeitweise eine Vaterfigur, ehe später Richard Wagner diese Stelle einnahm.', 'Im Oktober 1865, kurz bevor Nietzsche das Studium in Leipzig aufnahm, verbrachte er zwei Wochen in Berlin bei der Familie seines Studienfreundes Hermann Mushacke. Dessen Vater hatte in den 1840er Jahren zu einem Debattierzirkel um Bruno Bauer und Max Stirner gehört. Dass Nietzsche bei diesem Besuch mit Stirners 1845 erschienenem Buch \\"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\\" konfrontiert wurde, liegt nahe, lässt sich aber nicht belegen. Jedenfalls wandte Nietzsche sich unmittelbar danach einem Philosophen zu, der Stirner und dem Junghegelianismus denkbar fernstand: Arthur Schopenhauer. Ein weiterer Philosoph, den er in seiner Leipziger Zeit für sich entdeckte, war Friedrich Albert Lange, dessen \\"Geschichte des Materialismus\\" 1866 erschien. In erster Linie setzte Nietzsche jedoch zunächst sein philologisches Studium fort. In dieser Zeit knüpfte er eine enge Freundschaft mit seinem Kommilitonen Erwin Rohde. Mit diesem zusammen beteiligte er sich 1866 an der Gründung des Klassisch-philologischen Vereins an der Universität Leipzig.', 'Hatte er im Deutschen Krieg zwischen Preußen und Österreich, in dem das Königreich Sachsen auf österreichischer Seite stand und Leipzig preußisch besetzt wurde, als Student eine militärische Einberufung noch vermeiden können, musste Nietzsche 1867 seinen Wehrdienst bei der preußischen Armee ableisten und trat als Einjährig-Freiwilliger beim Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 55 in Naumburg ein. Als er nach einem schweren Reitunfall im März 1868 dienstunfähig geworden war, nutzte er die Zeit seiner Kur zu weiteren philologischen Arbeiten, die er in seinem letzten Studienjahr fortsetzte. Von großer Bedeutung wurde sein erstes Zusammentreffen mit Richard Wagner im Jahre 1868.', 'Professor an der Universität Basel (1869–1879).', 'Auf Empfehlung seines Lehrers Friedrich Ritschl und auf Betreiben Wilhelm Vischer-Bilfingers wurde Nietzsche 1869 als besonderes altsprachliches Talent, jedoch ohne Promotion, zum außerordentlichen Professor für klassische Philologie an die kleine, damals finanzschwache Universität Basel berufen. Zu seiner Tätigkeit gehörte auch der Unterricht am traditionsreichen Basler Gymnasium am Münsterplatz. Als seine wichtigste Erkenntnis auf dem Gebiet der Philologie wird die Entdeckung des quantitierenden Prinzips angesehen, also die Erkenntnis, dass die antike Metrik, im Gegensatz zur modernen Metrik, ausschließlich: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Friedrich Nietzsche, klassischer Philologe, Philosoph, Autor, Burschenschafter, Existenzialist, Aphoristiker, deutsche Auswanderer, Briefliteratur, Lebensphilosophie, Geburt 1844."},{"instruction":"请用400字左右的篇幅阐述数字媒体管理的内涵和意义，并把这些内容整合为一段话","output":"数字媒体是当今世界的主要信息传播工具之一，数字媒体管理是指针对数字媒体资源的全过程管理，包括资源收集、分类、存储、修缮、加工、传播和监测等，以达到提高数字媒体资源的利用率、降低成本、实现信息精细化管理的目的。 数字媒体管理是现代信息社会发展的重要支撑，随着互联网、物联网、人工智能等技术的不断发展，数字媒体管理也将迎来新的发展机遇。数字媒体管理的意义在于提高数字媒体资源的利用率、推进数字化信息的快速传播、维护数字媒体资源的安全性与完整性、支持知识产权保护等，这些都对于建设信息社会和数字中国有着重要的意义。 数字媒体管理也有很多具体应用场景，例如数字图书馆、数字档案馆、数字化博物馆等。数字媒体管理通过数字工具和技术，实现了管理内容的非物质化，将数字信息资源以数字媒体的形式进行管理、保存和传播。数字媒体管理同时也极大地促进了人们获取信息的便利，为人类的文化创造、传承、传播作出了卓越的贡献。 综上所述，数字媒体管理是数字化信息时代的重要组成部分，对于有效地管理数字媒体资源、推进数字化社会和经济的发展、促进数字文化创造具有至关重要的意义。数字媒体管理将成为数字社会、数字文化、数字经济发展过程中的一项重要工作，需要不断探寻与创新管理模式、加强数字技术的innovation，以便以更好地满足新时代数字社会发展的需求。"},{"instruction":"请把以上内容的数字媒体管理的意义部分提取出来，并扩充到400字","output":"数字媒体管理作为数字化信息时代的重要组成部分，具有重要的意义。现代社会中，随着数字媒体的快速发展，在数字化信息时代中数字媒体管理的意义愈加突显。 首先，数字媒体管理提高数字媒体资源的利用率和降低成本。数字媒体管理对于数字媒体资源进行全过程管理，包括数字媒体收集、分类、存储、修缮、加工、传播和监测等各个环节。通过数字媒体管理，可以合理利用现有的数字媒体资源，并避免重复制作，降低数字媒体管理的成本。 其次，数字媒体管理是推进数字化信息快速传播的重要手段。数字媒体管理可以通过数字媒体的精细化管理和合理配置，实现数字化信息的快速传播。数字媒体的传播速度快、人群广泛，数字媒体管理的实施可以使得传播的效果更为明显。 第三，数字媒体管理是维护数字媒体资源的安全性和完整性的保障。由于数字媒体的特性决定了其易受到信息泄露、盗用和侵犯等威胁，因此数字媒体管理必须保障数字媒体资源的安全性和完整性。数字媒体管理需要科学、有效地进行知识产权保护和信息安全管理。 最后，数字媒体管理是支持知识产权保护的重要手段之一。数字媒体管理通过对数字媒体资源的生命周期管理，能够保护数字媒体资源中所包含的知识产权。数字媒体管理对于数字媒体资源的合法性、完整性等方面进行全面管理，可以有效保护数字媒体资源的知识产权，进而促进数字化信息的有序、稳定发展。 综上所述，数字媒体管理的意义极为重要，它对于有效地管理数字媒体资源、推进数字化社会和经济的发展、促进数字文化创造具有至关重要的意义。数字媒体管理将成为数字社会、数字文化、数字经济发展过程中的一项重要工作。只有不断探寻和创新管理模式，在数字技术的支持下，才能满足新时代数字社会发展的需求，推动数字媒体管理不断前进。"},{"instruction":"请围绕“数字媒体管理可以整合和优化数字资产的内容和价值，提高数字资产的价值和积累，为企业赢得更多的商业利益。”，将其扩张到200字","output":"数字媒体管理可以整合和优化数字资产的内容和价值，提高数字资产的价值和积累，为企业赢得更多的商业利益，这是数字媒体管理的重要意义之一。在数字化经济时代，数字资产成为了企业非常重要的财富，企业拥有了更多的数字资产，也就意味着企业拥有了更多的商业利益来源。数字媒体管理通过对企业数字资产的全过程管理，可以实现数字资产的整合和优化，提高数字资产的价值和积累，让企业在商业竞争中占据更强的优势。与此同时，数字媒体管理还可以通过优化数字内容的创作、编辑、传播等环节，使数字资产在商业利益中更具有创造性、独特性、有价值性，帮助企业在市场中更快更好地获得商业成功的机遇。因此，数字媒体管理不仅是数字化经济时代企业管理的重要组成部分，也是企业获取商业成功的必不可少的手段之一。"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Filmtitel 1972', 'Ingmar Bergman', 'Psychodrama', 'Schwedischer Film'], 'Schreie und Flüstern (Originaltitel: \\"Viskningar och rop\\") ist ein schwedischer Spielfilm von Ingmar Bergman aus dem Jahr 1972.

Jahrhundert: Agnes hat Krebs und liegt im Sterben. Die Momente, in denen sie Kraft findet, in ihr Tagebuch zu schreiben, sind selten. Meistens wird sie von Attacken heftiger Schmerzen gequält. Agnes’ Schwestern Maria und Karin sind angereist, um bei der Sterbenden zu verweilen, doch sie bleiben distanziert, Karin in ihrer Kälte, Maria in ihrer oberflächlichen Herzlichkeit. Nur die tiefgläubige Dienstmagd Anna, deren einzige Tochter einst im Kindesalter gestorben ist, ist in der Lage, Agnes Trost und menschliche Nähe zu geben.', 'Rückblenden unterbrechen den filmischen Erzählfluss und berichten aus dem Leben der jeweiligen Hauptfiguren: Agnes erinnert sich an ihre Kindheit und ihre rätselhafte Mutter. Maria erlebt ihr ehebrecherisches Verhältnis zum zynischen Arzt David und den misslungenen Suizidversuch ihres Ehemanns danach. Karin brüskiert ihren verhassten Ehemann, indem sie sich in ihrem Intimbereich mit einer Glasscherbe verletzt.', 'Agnes ist gestorben. Nach der Totenrede des Pfarrers planen Karin und Maria die Auflösung des Besitzes. Für einen Moment kommen sich die beiden näher, als Maria ihre Schwester Karin – gegen deren anfänglichen Widerwillen – berührt und liebkost. In einer traumartigen Sequenz kehrt Agnes kurz darauf nochmals zu den Lebenden zurück und fordert von ihrer Familie Wärme und Liebe ein. Nur Anna ist fähig, die Tote in ihre Arme zu schließen und um sie zu trauern.', 'Nach der Beerdigung reisen die Schwestern ab; Karin, die die Nähe zu Maria aufrechterhalten will, wird von dieser zurückgewiesen.

Liv Ullmann berichtete, es sei „ein sehr intimer und persönlicher Brief“ gewesen, der mit den Worten begann: „Meine lieben Freunde, wir werden wieder einen gemeinsamen Film drehen. Es handelt sich um eine Art Vision, die ich hatte und die ich Euch zu beschreiben versuche.“', 'Der Brief enthielt eine komplette Handlungsbeschreibung von \\"Schreie und Flüstern\\", war jedoch nicht in Form eines Drehbuchs abgefasst. Bergman konnte damit die ihm langjährig vertrauten Darstellerinnen Harriet Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, Liv Ullmann sowie seinen bevorzugten Kameramann Sven Nykvist für das Projekt begeistern. Bergmans ursprünglicher Plan, auch Mia Farrow für die Besetzung zu gewinnen, zerschlug sich.', 'Da es Bergman aufgrund seiner international nur schwer vermarktbaren letzten Filme nicht möglich war, ausländisches Kapital für die Finanzierung zu gewinnen, entschloss er sich, den Film in schwedischer Sprache zu drehen und mit seiner Produktionsfirma Cinematograph selbst zu finanzieren. Er setzte seine eigenen Ersparnisse in Höhe von 750.000 Skr dafür ein und bekam vom Schwedischen Filminstitut weitere 550.000 Skr. Die Entscheidung, Bergmans Film angeblich zuungunsten weniger bekannter Regisseure mit dieser nicht unbeträchtlichen Summe zu fördern, brachte Harry Schein, den Verantwortlichen des Filminstituts, in die Kritik.', 'Mit den Anteilen Bergmans und des Filminstituts verblieb eine Finanzierungslücke von etwa 100.000 Skr. Um Kosten zu sparen, setzten die Hauptdarstellerinnen und Nykvist ihre Gage als Kapital ein und fungierten offiziell als Koproduzenten, obwohl sie in die geschäftlichen Entscheidungsprozesse nicht involviert waren, wie Liv Ullmann sich erinnerte.', 'Als Drehort wurde das Schloss Taxinge-Näsby am Mälarsee in der Nähe von Mariefred gefunden. Das verlassene alte Herrenhaus war in einem schlechten baulichen Zustand, konnte aber von Bergmans Team nach seinen Ansprüchen komplett umgestaltet werden. Ein halbes Jahr lang testeten Bergman und Nykvist Kulissen, Dekorationen und Lichtsituationen im Zusammenspiel mit Make-up und Kostümen, da beiden eine sorgfältige Vorbereitung notwendig erschien.', 'Produktion und Nachproduktion.', 'Die Dreharbeiten fanden vom 7. September bis zum 29. Oktober 1971 statt. Das Team arbeitete „in einer Stimmung munterer Zuversicht“, wie Bergman anmerkt, wobei den Beteiligten die langjährige Vertrautheit zugutekam. Da Bergman die Dialoge nicht niedergeschrieben, sondern nur das Handlungsgerüst festgelegt hatte, entstanden die gesprochenen Texte in Zusammenarbeit mit den Darstellern während des Drehs oder wurden frei improvisiert, wie Ullmann sich erinnert. Bergmans Töchter Linn und Lena Bergman waren mit am Set und spielten kleine Rollen.', 'Die Postproduktion des Films erwies sich als langwierig. Neben dem Tonschnitt stellte sich besonders die Bildbearbeitung im Labor zum Abgleich der Farben und Lichtsituationen als aufwändig heraus. Parallel zur Nachproduktion begann Bergman mit den Vorbereitungen zu \\"Szenen einer Ehe\\". Da er in akute Geldschwierigkeiten geriet, sah er sich gezwungen, bereits im Vorfeld die Rechte an \\"Szenen einer Ehe\\" an das schwedische Fernsehen zu veräußern. Da es für Bergman zunächst nicht möglich war, einen europäischen Verleih für \\"Schreie und Flüstern\\" zu finden, hatte der Film auf Vermittlung seines amerikanischen Agenten Paul Kohner am 21. Dezember 1972 in einem kleinen Programmkino in New York Weltpremiere, verliehen durch den B-Filmer Roger Corman. Der Spieltermin war kurzfristig frei geworden, nachdem sich ein dort eingeplanter Visconti-Film in der Fertigstellung verzögert hatte.', 'Rezeption.', 'Veröffentlichung und zeitgenössische Kritik.', '\\"Schreie und Flüstern\\" entwickelte sich innerhalb weniger Tage zum Überraschungserfolg.

In der Bundesrepublik Deutschland hatte \\"Schreie und Flüstern\\" seine Premiere am 10. März 1974 in der ARD.', 'In den USA war die Aufnahme des Films durch die Kritik recht positiv. Roger Ebert schrieb etwa, der Film sei „hypnotisch, verstörend, angsterregend“, die Vision eines Filmemachers, „der ein absoluter Meister seiner Kunst ist“. Der Film habe „keine abstrakte Botschaft“, sondern kommuniziere „auf einer Ebene des menschlichen Gefühls, das so tief ist, dass wir uns davor fürchten, für die vorgefundenen Dinge Worte zu finden.“ \\"Variety\\" schrieb, Bergmans „dunkle Vision“ fokussiere sich auf „Individuen, die einer echten Kommunikation zwischen Menschen nur auf der primitivsten Ebene fähig sind.“ Bergmans „dürrer Stil“ und „seine Verwendung von lange verweilenden Nahaufnahmen“ gäben dem Film „hypnotische Eindrücklichkeit.“', 'Pauline Kael urteilte, der Film baue auf einer „Serie emotional aufgeladener Bilder“ auf, die „innere Spannung“ ausdrückten. Nykvists Fotografie erinnere mit ihren blutroten Hintergründen an den Stil Edvard Munchs. Vincent Canby beurteilte den Film als „wundervoll, bewegend und sehr mysteriös“. Es sei weder einfach, ihn zu beschreiben, noch ihn auszuhalten.', 'Die europäische Filmkritik war in ihrer Meinung über den Film gespalten. Eine der positiven Stimmen kam von François Truffaut, der in seiner Filmkritik 1973 in den Cahiers du cinéma anmerkte, der Film beginne wie \\"Drei Schwestern\\" von Tschechow, ende wie \\"Der Kirschgarten\\", und dazwischen sei „sehr viel Strindberg“. Der Film sei ein „Meisterwerk“ und versöhne Bergman „mit dem großen Publikum, das ihn seit seinem letzten Film \\"Das Schweigen\\" ignoriert hat.“', 'Andere Kritiker bemängelten Bergmans, so Golombek, „Manierismus“, die „aufgesetzt und gestelzt“ wirkende Farbdramaturgie, und die „ästhetische Verfeinerung um ihrer selbst willen“, wie Lange-Fuchs anmerkt. In Schweden zog der Film einige kritische Bemerkungen auf sich, er sei zu unpolitisch und unhistorisch. Die kommunistische Zeitung \\"Gnistan\\" kritisierte den Warencharakter des Films und schrieb, er sei „ein weltweit vermarktbares Produkt“ wie Volvo oder schwedischer Wodka. Bergman sei „wahrhaft reaktionär“, indem er keine politisch bewussten Filme mache, sondern „Kunst für seine Regisseurkollegen und solche Leute“.', 'Bergman selbst war mit dem Film sehr zufrieden. Er nannte ihn sein „Sonntagskind“, da für ihn bezüglich Besetzung und Verlauf der Dreharbeiten keine Wünsche offen geblieben waren. \\"Schreie und Flüstern\\" sei ein „guter Film“, auf den er stolz sei. In seiner Autobiografie merkt Bergman an: „Einige wenige Male ist es mir gelungen, mich ungehindert zwischen Traum und Wirklichkeit zu bewegen.“ Als Beispiele führt er neben \\"Schreie und Flüstern\\" die Filme \\"Persona\\", \\"Abend der Gaukler\\" und \\"Das Schweigen\\" an.', 'Auszeichnungen.', 'Der Film lief beim Filmfestival von Cannes 1973 außerhalb des Hauptwettbewerbs, trotzdem wurde die Pressekonferenz zum Film, Bergmans erste außerhalb Skandinaviens, zur größten seit Bestehen des Festivals.

Der Begriff Orgellandschaft allein nimmt Bezug auf die historisch bedingten regionalen Eigenheiten der Orgeln. Die Anfänge der Orgellandschaft Hessen reichen ins 13. Jahrhundert zurück. Seine Blütezeit erlebte der hessische Orgelbau im 18. Jahrhundert. Im 20. Jahrhundert ging er in der allgemeinen Entwicklung des deutschen Orgelbaus auf. Er war vielfältigen Einflüssen ausgesetzt und ist aufs Ganze gesehen wenig einheitlich geprägt. Dies ist vor allem auf die verschiedenen hessischen Herrschaften und die wechselnden Grenzverläufe in der Geschichte Hessens zurückzuführen. Die kulturelle Konkurrenz zwischen den Landgrafschaften führte zu einer Öffnung gegenüber Einflüssen aus den benachbarten Orgelregionen in Thüringen, Franken, dem Rheinland, der Pfalz und Westfalen. Andererseits entstanden zahlreiche lokale Werkstätten mit teils langer Familientradition.', 'Geschichte des Orgelbaus.', 'Bis zur Spätgotik.', 'Die erste bezeugte Orgel des Abendlands war eine Hydraulis, die der oströmische Kaiser Konstantin V. im Jahr 757 Pippin am Mittelrhein als Diplomatengeschenk vermachte. Ab dem 9. Jahrhundert finden sich in einigen wenigen Klöstern Kirchenorgeln, ab dem 13. Jahrhundert vor allem in Kathedralen und Domen, ab dem 14./15. Jahrhundert sind sie über ganz Deutschland verbreitet. Über Jahrhunderte lag das Zentrum des europäischen Orgelbaus jedoch am Mittelrhein. Dank der günstigen Verkehrslage kam es im Taunus und Westerwald zu einer regen Orgelbautätigkeit. Von dort wurden die Regionen im Innenland mit Instrumenten versorgt und auch technische Neuerungen eingeführt. In Wetzlar ist im Jahr 1279 die erste Orgel bezeugt, im Kloster Arnstein und in Dietkirchen Ende des 13. Jahrhunderts, in Limburg 1331. Für den Frankfurter Dom (Bartholomäusstift) ist 1313 erstmals eine Orgel belegt, dessen genaue Erbauungszeit nicht bekannt ist. Im Jahr 1340 wurde dort bereits eine neue Orgel errichtet. Daniel von Hünhoff aus Hadamar ist im Jahr 1471 als erster regionaler Orgelbauer greifbar. In der zweiten Hälfte des 15. Jahrhunderts wirkte Leonhard Mertz ausgehend von Frankfurt am Main weit über Deutschland hinaus bis nach Barcelona. Er schuf zum Teil Großorgeln mit drei Teilwerken und einem 32-Fuß im Prospekt. Die Tätigkeit weiterer Frankfurter Orgelbauer wie Diedrich Krafft (1414–1436), Levinus Sweys (1440) und Günter Golt (1446–1475) bezeugt, dass Frankfurt seit spätgotischer Zeit ein europäisches Zentrum des Orgelbaus war. In Fulda hatte der Priester und Organist Laurentius Daum (um 1495–1543) seine Werkstatt und wirkte auch in Sachsen, Thüringen und Nassau. Um 1540 wandte Daum sich dem protestantischen Glauben zu und gründete eine Familie. Für die Fuldaer Stiftskirche (Dom) schuf er 1535 bis 1537 und für die Abteikirche Schlüchtern 1535 bis 1543 neue Orgeln, die alle spätestens in der Barockzeit verloren gingen.', 'Die Kiedricher Orgel ist die älteste Orgel in Hessen, die noch spielbar ist. In ihren ältesten Teilen geht sie auf spätgotische Zeit zurück. Ein unbekannter Meister errichtete um 1500 ein Instrument, das im Laufe der Jahrhunderte mehrfach umgebaut wurde. Hinter dem Orgelprospekt mit Flügeltüren befinden sich Reste eines Werkes von Johannes Wendel Kirchner aus dem Jahr 1653, das im 18. Jahrhundert eine weitere barocke Umgestaltung erfuhr. Geldmangel war die Ursache, dass das Instrument anschließend lange Zeit vor Modernisierungen und einem Austausch verschont blieb. Eine erste Restaurierung wurde von 1858 bis 1860 auf Veranlassung und durch die Finanzierung des englischen Baronets John Sutton durchgeführt. In diesem Zuge wurde der Prospekt entbarockisiert und im gotisch-neugotischen Stil gestaltet. Orgelbau Kuhn führte das Werk 1985–1987 auf den Zustand von 1860 zurück.', 'Renaissance und Frühbarock.', 'Der führende hessische Orgelbauer des 17. Jahrhunderts war Georg Wagner aus Lich. Wagner begründete eine Orgelbauerfamilie, der bis zum Tod von Georg Henrich Wagner im Jahr 1688 eine reiche Neubau- und Reparaturtätigkeit in Hessen nachgewiesen ist. Georg Wagner wird auch der Bau der berühmten Marburger Schloss-Orgel („Althefer-Positiv“) zugeschrieben, die zwischen 1590 und 1600 wahrscheinlich für die Landvögte Rudolph Wilhelm Rau von Holzhausen und seinen Schwiegersohn Johann von Bodenhausen aus Amönau auf höchstem handwerklichen Niveau angefertigt wurde. Nach dem Tod der Besitzer gelangte die Kleinorgel 1620 in die Stiftskirche Wetter und wurde 1776 nach Friedlos verkauft. Nach einem unsachgemäßen Erweiterungsumbau im 18. Jahrhundert verschlechterte sich der Zustand des Instruments zunehmend. Als die Orgel schließlich unspielbar geworden war, wurde sie 1882 dem Hessischen Geschichtsverein geschenkt. Dieser veranlasste die Überführung ins Marburger Schloss, wo sie ihren heutigen Standort fand. Das Instrument verfügte ursprünglich über sechs Register, die noch teilweise original erhalten sind. Gegenwärtig sind die Eigentumsverhältnisse ungeklärt, sodass eine Rekonstruktion dieser Renaissance-Orgel ausgesetzt wurde (Stand: Mai 2011). Die Wagner-Prospekte in der Butzbacher Markuskirche (1614) und in der Marienstiftskirche Lich (1624) gehören zu den ältesten in Hessen. Beide Orgeln besitzen ein Rückpositiv, sind mit geschnitztem Schleierwerk reich verziert und haben in den zweigeschossigen Flachfeldern zwischen den Pfeifentürmen des Hauptwerks einen Spiegelprinzipal (in Butzbach mit Originalpfeifen). Vermutlich geht auch das Werk in Rodenbach, das von 1621 datiert, auf Wagner zurück; noch vier Register stammen aus dem 17. Jahrhundert.', 'Durchreisende Orgelbauer prägten Hessen im 17. Jahrhundert und der Brabanter Orgelbau dominierte in der Renaissance Deutschland weitgehend. Familie Graurock (Grorockh) aus Emmerich ließ sich in Frankfurt nieder und führte mit Werken in der Barfüßerkirche, in Darmstadt (1599) und Schotten (1614) die niederländisch-brabantische Orgelbaukunst in Hessen ein. Der Hamburger Meister Hans Scherer der Jüngere führte wie die Graurocks die Tradition von Hendrik Niehoff aus ’s-Hertogenbosch fort und prägte Kassel durch drei Orgelneubauten, die überregionale Bekanntheit erlangten, aber alle verloren gingen.', 'Während des Dreißigjährigen Kriegs wurden nur vereinzelt Orgeln gebaut. Zu den wenigen Instrumenten aus dieser Zeit gehört die Worfelder Orgel, die im Laufe ihrer Geschichte an verschiedenen Standorten aufgestellt war. Adam Knauth aus Bamberg schuf im Jahr 1623/1624 für die Darmstädter Schlosskirche ein kleines Instrument ohne Pedal mit sechs Registern, das 1709 nach Zwingenberg gelangte und sich seit 1831 in Worfelden befindet. Das bedeutende Werk aus dem Übergang von der Spätrenaissance zum Frühbarock ist ohne bauliche Veränderungen geblieben und damit eine der ältesten Orgeln Deutschlands. Die Orgel zeichnet sich durch die kurze Oktave, die mitteltönige Stimmung und den 1681 geschickt angebauten Engelkasten mit einer kleinen Zusatzwindlade für die ergänzten Basstöne Fis und Gis aus. Im Jahr 1648 ließ sich Jakob Knauff aus Rieneck in Hanau nieder und baute in Weilburg (1653) und Wetzlar (1654) Instrumente. Adam Öhninger aus Lohr am Main schuf 1686 die Orgel in der Stadtkirche Limburg. Von Jost Friedrich Schäffer aus Langensalza, der den thüringischen Orgelbau nach Hessen importierte, stammt die Orgel in St. Dionys in Eschwege (1677–1679). Von beiden Werken ist nur noch das Gehäuse original.', 'Barock bis Klassizismus.', 'Im 18. Jahrhundert erlebte die hessische Orgelkultur eine Blütezeit, in der ansonsten schlicht gehaltene reformierte Kirchen Orgeln mit repräsentativen Prospekten und großzügigen Dispositionen erhielten.

Im Gegensatz zum norddeutschen Orgelbau fand in Hessen ein Rückpositiv nur ausnahmsweise Verwendung. Das jüngste Beispiel findet sich in der St.-Marien-Kirche in Bad Sooden-Allendorf (1756). Ab der Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts wurden in mittelrheinischer Tradition Unter- oder Echowerke die Regel, was eine Seitenspieligkeit nach sich zog. Das Pedal war meist selbstständig und nicht nur angehängt. Wie im norddeutschen Orgelbau wurde es in eigenen, symmetrischen Pedaltürmen und ab der Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts zunehmend in flachen und teils recht breiten Pedalflügeln untergebracht, was auf südlichen Einfluss zurückzuführen ist. Eigentümlich breit sind die Pedalflügel in der Liebfrauenkirche Witzenhausen, deren lange Schräggesimse weit in das Tonnengewölbe hineinragen. Die Pedaltürme in Nordhessen weisen im Allgemeinen geschwungene Gesimse (mit „Harfenfeldern“) auf, die weiter südlich bei allen Pfeifentürmen die Regel sind. Infolge der unterschiedlichen kulturellen Prägung der Orgellandschaft ist die Prospektgestaltung insgesamt wenig einheitlich. Bei kleinen Instrumenten fand der fünfteilige Prospekt des „mitteldeutschen Normaltyps“ mit einem hohen Rundturm in der Mitte, zwei seitlichen Spitztürmen und dazwischen niedrigeren eingeschossigen Flachfeldern im Barock seine klassische Gestalt.', 'Durch Johann Jakob Dahm, der 1698 das Bürgerrecht in Mainz erhielt, gelangten fränkische Einflüsse in die hessische Orgellandschaft. Von ihm ist noch der Prospekt in der Weilburger Schlosskirche (1710) zu sehen. Sein Werk in Flörsheim (1709), ursprünglich für das Frankfurter Karmeliterkloster gebaut, wurde im Laufe der Zeit mehrfach umgearbeitet, verfügt aber noch über einige originale Register. In Dietkirchen/St. Lubentius (1711) steht ein neues Werk hinter dem Dahm-Prospekt, während seine berühmte Orgel in Kloster Eberbach ganz verloren ging. Der kurpfälzische Hoforgelbauer Johann Friedrich Ernst Müller baute 1740 in Güttersbach eine Orgel mit neun Registern, die keine eingreifenden Modernisierungen erlebt hat.', 'Johann Christian Rindt stammte aus Hatzfeld und arbeitete in Schönstadt als Organist, Schulmeister und Orgelbauer. Er verfertigte einige einmanualige Werke ohne selbstständiges Pedal. In der Emmauskapelle in Hatzfeld befindet sich ein kleines Werk aus dem Jahr 1706, das Rindt ursprünglich für die Stadtkirche seiner Geburtsstadt baute. Die erhaltenen Prospekte sind mit reichem Schnitzwerk versehen, insbesondere das seitliche Schleierwerk (die sogenannten „Orgelohren“) und das Gehäuse mit Motiven prächtig bemalt.

Ziel der Archivgründung war die Sammlung von Quellen, um ihre Verstreuung zu vermeiden und sich eine Monopolstellung in ihrer Auswertung zu verschaffen.', 'Seit Anfang der 1890er stieg die Nietzsche-Rezeption im deutschsprachigen Raum sprunghaft an. Das Nietzsche-Archiv versuchte, in der öffentlichen Diskussion die Deutungshoheit über Friedrich Nietzsche und seine Philosophie zu gewinnen. Dem dienten in den folgenden Jahrzehnten nicht nur die biografischen Bücher Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsches, sondern auch eine Vielzahl von Zeitschriften- und Zeitungsartikeln, die aus dem Archiv oder aus dessen Umkreis kamen. Förster-Nietzsche hatte schon seit ihrer Jugend Dokumente über den von ihr bewunderten Bruder gesammelt und kaufte jetzt vor allem seine Briefwechsel für teilweise beträchtliche Summen auf. Neben Friedrich Nietzsches Werken wurden von nun an also auch seine Briefe direkt oder indirekt vom Archiv herausgegeben. Ein weiterer Grund für die bald beginnende rege Publikationstätigkeit des Archivs und seine Monopolisierung von Nietzsches Werk dürfte gewesen sein, dass damit hohe Gewinne erzielt werden konnten.', 'Gründung in Naumburg.', 'Nach Nietzsches Zusammenbruch 1889 hatten zunächst Heinrich Köselitz und Franz Overbeck als Verantwortliche für Nietzsches literarischen Nachlass gehandelt. Köselitz wandte sich im Winter 1893/94 vorläufig von jeder Beschäftigung mit Nietzsche ab, als Förster die von ihm begonnene Nietzsche-Ausgabe hatte zurückziehen und einstampfen lassen. Overbeck und Förster hatten sich schon davor zerstritten. Förster ließ sich weitere in fremden Händen befindliche Manuskripte ihres Bruders aushändigen und handelte mit dem Verlag C.G. Naumann neue Verträge aus. Zum 68. Geburtstag ihrer Mutter am 2. Februar 1894 überraschte sie diese mit fertig eingerichteten Archivräumen in der gemeinsamen Naumburger Wohnung. Im April wurde der Schriftsteller und Kunstwissenschaftler Fritz Koegel (1860–1904) als Herausgeber der geplanten Nietzsche-Gesamtausgabe angestellt. Bereits im September zog das Archiv aus dem Wohnhaus der Mutter und des kranken Bruders in ein größeres Naumburger Quartier, wo bald auch Besucher wie Harry Graf Kessler empfangen wurden.', 'Bei einem Besuch im Goethe-Archiv hatte Frau Förster die Bekanntschaft der Goethe-Herausgeber Eduard von der Hellen und Rudolf Steiner gemacht. Letzterer, auch als Nietzsche-Kenner geltend, besuchte sie mehrfach und durfte Original-Manuskripte einsehen. Am 1. Oktober wurde von der Hellen als neuer Mitarbeiter gewonnen. Dieser Verpflichtungscoup lenkte einige öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit auf das Archiv. Zwischen Steiner und von der Hellen kam es deswegen zu einer Auseinandersetzung, deren Hintergrund nicht völlig geklärt ist. Dass Steiner lieber selbst Herausgeber geworden wäre, wurde von ihm später energisch bestritten, aber von Förster-Nietzsche später im Streit mit Steiner öffentlich so dargestellt.', 'Schon bald nach der Anstellung von der Hellens wurde Fritz Koegel für einige Zeit beurlaubt. Von der Hellen schied schon nach wenigen Monaten im gegenseitigen Einvernehmen wieder aus dem Archiv aus. Die von Koegel unter Mitarbeit von der Hellens begonnene Gesamtausgabe schritt 1895 zügig voran. Ebenfalls ein literarischer Erfolg wurde der erste Band von Försters Nietzsche-Biografie. Aus heutiger Sicht war diese Schrift auch der erste Baustein des verzerrten Nietzsche-Bildes, welches das Archiv in den Folgejahren verbreitete (siehe Das Nietzsche-Bild des Archivs).', 'Im Dezember 1895 gelang es Förster nach erheblichem Druck, ihrer Mutter und dem zweiten Vormund des Kranken, Adalbert Oehler, alle Rechte an den Schriften ihres Bruders abzukaufen. Dafür lieh sie sich 30.000 Mark beim Bankier Robert von Mendelssohn, wobei die Nietzsche-Freunde und -Verehrer Meta von Salis, Harry Graf Kessler, Hermann Hecker und Raoul Richter als Bürgen eintraten. Immer wieder kam es in dieser Zeit zu Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Schwester und Mutter des Philosophen: Letztere empfand das Gebaren des Archivs und ihrer Tochter als unwürdig und fühlte sich ungerecht behandelt. Sie starb am 20. April 1897 im Alter von 71 Jahren in Naumburg.', 'Umzug nach Weimar.', 'Am 1. August 1896 zog das Archiv mit finanzieller Unterstützung Meta von Salis’ nach Weimar um, zunächst in eine angemietete Wohnung. Grund für die Wahl Weimars dürfte der Wunsch gewesen sein, von der Aura der Kulturstadt zu profitieren und sich dem bereits erwähnten Vorbild des Goethe- und Schiller-Archivs gleichzustellen. Auch Harry Graf Kessler, ein wichtiger Protagonist des „Neuen Weimars“, hatte für diesen Umzug geworben.', 'Im Winter 1896/97 kam es zu einer ersten schweren Krise im Archiv, über deren genauen Hergang keine endgültigen Erkenntnisse vorliegen. Förster-Nietzsche wollte Rudolf Steiner als Herausgeber gewinnen und gegebenenfalls Koegel, mit dem es zu sachlichen Differenzen und persönlichen Spannungen gekommen war, entlassen. Nach Darstellung Steiners und anderer hat sie dazu Steiner und Koegel gegeneinander aufgehetzt, die dies allerdings schließlich durchschaut hätten. Förster-Nietzsche stellte es später so dar, dass Steiner Herausgeber werden wollte und so von sich aus in Konflikt mit Koegel geraten sei. In Folge dieser Krise wurde Koegel schließlich zum 1. Juli 1897 entlassen, und nachfolgende Verhandlungen mit Steiner, der sich immer weiter vom Archiv distanzierte, scheiterten.', 'Ebenfalls zum 1. Juli 1897 kaufte Meta von Salis die Villa „\\"Zum Silberblick\\"“ in Weimar für 39.000 Mark und stellte sie dem Archiv zur Verfügung. Der Umzug fand im Sommer statt, auch der pflegebedürftige Friedrich Nietzsche wurde hierher verlegt. Mit eigenmächtigen Umbaumaßnahmen verärgerte Förster-Nietzsche ihre Freundin und Gönnerin Meta von Salis, die das Haus 1898 an Adalbert Oehler verkaufte und den Kontakt zu Förster-Nietzsche abbrach.', 'Im Oktober 1898 konnte Arthur Seidl als Herausgeber einer neuen Gesamtausgabe – bereits der dritten nach den jeweils abgebrochenen Köselitz’ und Koegels – gewonnen werden. In der Folgezeit traten auch die Brüder Ernst und August Horneffer als Mitarbeiter ins Archiv ein, Ende 1899 auch Heinrich Köselitz. Bei Köselitz’ überraschendem Eintritt dürfte seine schwierige finanzielle Lage eine Rolle gespielt haben. Mazzino Montinari hat später die These aufgestellt, es habe eine Art „Nichtangriffspakt“ zwischen Köselitz und Förster-Nietzsche gegeben, denen beide abschätzige Urteile Friedrich Nietzsches über den jeweils anderen bekannt waren.', 'Öffentliche Auseinandersetzungen.', 'Im Jahr 1900 kam es zum ersten öffentlichen Streit um die Editionsmethoden des Archivs und seine philosophische und philologische Kompetenz. Ausgelöst wurde er durch einen Aufsatz Ernst Horneffers, in dem der frühere Herausgeber Koegel scharf attackiert wurde; damit sollte der Aufsatz auch die Einziehung der alten und den Beginn der neuen Gesamtausgabe rechtfertigen. Rudolf Steiner, der in die oben erwähnte Archivkrise verwickelt war, antwortete darauf mit einer „Enthüllung“ im \\"Magazin für Litteratur\\". Er verteidigte Koegel und gab eine sehr negative Charakterisierung von Förster-Nietzsche, die in der Behauptung gipfelte:', 'Damit war zum ersten Mal der Vorwurf nicht nur der philosophischen Inkompetenz, sondern auch der (bewussten oder unbewussten) Verfälschung von Friedrich Nietzsches Werk und Person gegen das Archiv öffentlich erhoben worden. Es entwickelte sich nun ein in mehreren Zeitschriften ausgetragener Streit, der sich nicht nur um diese Punkte, sondern auch um philosophische Fragen der Nietzsche-Deutung drehte.', 'Die genannten Vorwürfe gegen das Archiv wurden in verschiedener Schärfe in den Folgejahren immer wieder erhoben, oft auch direkt oder indirekt von ehemaligen Archivmitarbeitern.

Nobody really knows what caused there to be a size difference between macros and micros. One thing we know is that it didn’t always used to be like this. There were no over-sized plants and vegetation that destroyed houses with their roots and vines, there were no insects that could grow to the size of a compact car, and there were definitely no macro furries that delighted in hunted down and swallowing their smaller cousins whole. This, however, was all before the rise of the macros. As you can imagine, there was a great deal of confusion when one day regular furries, animals, and plants rapidly began to grow to many times their original size whereas the anthropomorphic mammals remained at their normal sizes. At first, there seemed to be at least some form of cooperation between the two groups as they tried to repair the damage that had been done. However, the giants soon started to give up on the idea that the two groups could ever be considered equal. This was largely due to the fact that an average adult-sized micro was only about three inches tall when compared to one of the massive giants. Micros were crushed beneath the macro’s feet without a second glance (sometimes intentionally) as the giants trudged about their daily lives. Some micros gathered together and fled to remote locations away from most of the dangers that they faced. This didn’t protect them from everything however. No matter where they went, there was always something big that had it’s eye on them. Even if there were no macrofurries around, micros found themselves being eaten alive by the animals that had grown on that day as well. Several years passed after the rise of the macros, and for the micros, things only became worse. Macros on the other hand had used that time to build the beginnings of fully macro-sized towns and cities where they could live normal lives again. Ash was an anthropomorphic pardinensis cheetah, a very rare species, he was a micro. He was slim and muscular with a long and thin tail and a short grey fur with darker spots, his short sleek fur was letting see the chiseled details of his muscles. He was also quite intelligent, but perhaps not as much as he thought to be. He despised the other micros who chose to live as far possible from the towering macros and their cities. He was living in their gigantic houses, hiding under their building seized pieces of furniture of in the holes in their walls. But one day he was captured and sold to a macro. When the box was finally opened and Ash was brought out, he was met with the sight of a towering anthro jaguar. The massively muscular jaguar grinned down at him, his sharp teeth glinting in the light. “Well, well, well,” the jaguar said with a chuckle. “Looks like I won myself a tasty little snack.” Ash shuddered in fear as the jaguar lifted him up, examining him closely. The jaguar smirked as he examined the body of the comparatively diminutive cheetah. “Fine, you seem to have endured the travel quite well. I bought that cage for you, I hope you will find it large enough. From the description on the auction site you’re a freshly caught wild micro. I assume you’re not used to restrained space, but you have to get used to it.” He chuckled and put Ash in the cage. He closed the door of the enclosure just after. “I can’t wait to have some fun with you, but it’s better to let you have some rest to chill out a bit.” Then the jaguar moved on his couch to watch TV, time to time he cast a glance at the cage and his tiny occupant from his seat. Some time later he moved to his bedroom to sleep for the night. The jaguar came back at the end of the day. He brought several grocery sacks and put them in his kitchen. “I thought about eating you first, but you’re so tiny you would not even fill one tenth of my belly.” He said with a chuckle. Some time later he come back with a dinner TV for carnivores adapted to his enormous size. He reached in the cage for the cheetah. Ash tried to avoid to be grabbed and managed to stay out of the reach of the humongous jaguar paw like hand as he was holding his dinner TV with his other hand at the same time, but the giant managed to seize the cheetah diminutive body eventually. “Don’t make your difficult to get !” Said the jaguar with the same chuckle. He then moved to his couch and sat heavily, the couch creaking under the thousands of tons of his weight. He then put the cheetah on the rim of the tray of his dinner TV. “Several kinds of meat. Beef, chicken, fish, and caiman, my favorite !” He said. “You can take some, it’s not your appetite that will make a difference.” He switched his TV on and searched for something interesting with his remote while taking some bit of food time to time. “Ah, by the way, my name is Lance. But you have to call me Master.” He snickered. “Or, if you feel like being a good pet, Daddy.” He laughed. One day, when Lance was engrossed in a particularly loud show on television, Ash seized his chance. He quietly slid out of his cage and onto the floor, careful to avoid any creaking or telltale sounds. Using his memory of the house layout and the cacophony of the TV, he stealthily made his way towards the window that he had observed Lance often leaving open. Ash’s heart pounded as he reached the window, with each passing second a potential for Lance to notice him. With one final act of defiance against his captor, he climbed up the curtain and leapt out into the open air, finally free. As he made his way through the grass that seemed like a jungle, he knew that he had a long journey ahead of him. Unknown of Ash, Lance was well aware about his position, as by security the giant jaguar put a microchip and GPS device in the collar he put around the neck of his expensive micro anthro cheetah. Lance followed the moving of his pet on his car sized smartphone as an app what giving him the position of Ash on a map. And some hours later the jaguar resounding steps come close of the hideout of Ash. “Ash ? I know you’re here. Move out of your hiding place.” The giant waited some seconds. “You know it’s dangerous for you to be in the streets. Critters are big here, they will eat you. And there are other macros too, all of them won’t try to catch you to keep you as a pet. So come with me. You will be safe in my home. I won’t punish you very hard for this time.” Ash’s heart sank as he heard Lance’s intimidating voice. He knew that there was no denying the giant’s presence, but he was determined to make a final attempt to escape. From his hiding place, he quickly formed a plan. Taking advantage of the giant’s momentary distraction, he bolted from his hiding place, running as fast as his legs could carry him, away from Lance. The jaguar gave an annoyed grunt and pursued Ash, his massive strides closing the distance between them frighteningly quickly. In the midst of their chase, Ash recalled a large sewer drain he had discovered earlier during his exploration. Deftly, the micro cheetah made a sudden turn, darting into the drain and disappearing from Lance’s sight. The giant jaguar cursed under his breath, realizing that he couldn’t fit into the small space. He knelt down, attempting to reach into the drain with his massive paw, but Ash was too fast and had already scrambled further into the darkness. Lance growled lowly, frustrated at losing his prized pet. He briefly considered calling off the chase and letting Ash make his own way in this harsh world, but the investment in the micro cheetah and his curiosity about whether Ash’s resourcefulness could be put to better use got the better of him. The giant jaguar decided his next move - he’d take a different tactic. Anticipating the path of the sewers, Lance hurried towards another exit, where he would attempt to recapture Ash quietly and seemingly without effort. A macro centipede was hiding in the sewer. It was easily four time longer than Ash and about the length of Lance’s forearm. The cheetah inadvertently knocked one of the long antennas of the invertebrate. The centipede became active and started to run after the cheetah. Ash, as a former wild micro before being captured, was used to cross the way of some macro critters, but the place where he lived before being sold to Lance was more in the north of the country in a cooler climate and insects were not as big, even the macro ones. That centipede was looking like a monster for the cheetah who was running with terror. Ash burst out of the sewer and didn’t even noticed Lance waiting for him. The centipede hurtled out of the sewer pursuing his tiny prey. Lance quickly realized the danger posed to his tiny prize and jumped into action. With an impressive display of strength and agility, he caught the large centipede just as it was about to sink its venomous pincers into the panicked cheetah. He crushed the giant invertebrate without hesitation, its many legs twitching one last time before going completely limp. Ash, still in a state of panic, finally noticed Lance standing above him. The skyscraper jaguar had saved him, and though Ash was desperate to escape captivity, he couldn’t help but feel a strange, begrudging gratitude toward Lance. The jaguar offered a massive paw to Ash, smirking. “Now do you see why I told you it’s a dangerous world out there? You can stay with me, and I can keep you safe from creatures like that. Or you can go back out there alone, and take your chances with the countless other predators lurking in the shadows.” Ash hesitated, torn between his desire for freedom and his newfound understanding of the true dangers faced by someone in his situation. He glanced back at the sewer entrance, shuddering at the memory of the terrifying macro centipede. Reluctantly, he climbed into Lance’s outstretched palm, knowing that, for the moment, his best chance at survival was to accept the giant’s “protection”. As they walked back to Lance’s home, Ash wondered if he could ever change the dynamic of their relationship, and perhaps one day regain his freedom without sacrificing his safety. Lance washed Ash meticulously as his escapade made the micro ran through a sewer. And the giant checked the diminutive anthro feline body to see if he had been hurt. Then he put him back in his cage and took care to close the door of the enclosure. Later in that same day, Lance gently seized Ash in his massive hand and moved to his couch. He had another of these enormous dinner TV for macro carnivores and he offered some bits of meat to Ash. Ash was about to eat one of them when he noticed something different. Lance didn’t switch the TV on yet. He put the morsel back on the rim of the gigantic tray and looked up at Lance. The giant anthropomorphic jaguar was looking down at him, his face was looking more serious than his usual jovial appearance. “Well, Ash. I said I won’t punish you hard too much for your escape. But, you made me search for you for hours and you might have been killed by that bug by a narrow margin.” He approached his humongous hand from the cheetah and stretched his forefinger out and gently petted the comparatively tiny body of the micro. “I know you’re a former wild micro with some age and you are not used to be captive. I wanted a pet who had some life before, I was thinking it would be more interesting. But I’m wondering if I should not have bought a micro from farming and already tamed and domesticated.” He moved his hand away. “Well, about that punishment, I wonder what you’re thinking of it ? And how I should punish you for your escapade ?” Ash hesitated for a moment, considering his response carefully. He knew that Lance held all the power in this situation, and that any defiance could be met with disastrous consequences. However, he couldn’t deny the fact that he was grateful for the giant’s intervention with the centipede. “Master,” Ash began hesitantly, “I understand that I caused you concern and trouble with my escape attempt, and I understand the need for a punishment in this situation. I know that the world is dangerous for a micro like me, and you saved my life today. I appreciate that, and I will do my best to be a good pet and companion to you.” Lance raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised by the sincerity in Ash’s words. It seemed that their previous encounter had affected him more than he had thought. “As for my punishment, I leave that decision in your capable hands, Master. However, I ask that you consider the fact that, despite everything, part of me still yearns for the wilds as it is where I spent most of my life. Maybe you can take that into account when deciding an appropriate punishment,” Ash finished, his voice barely above a whisper. Lance looked down at Ash pensively, genuinely considering the cheetah’s words. After a few moments, he nodded slowly. “Very well, Ash. I appreciate your honesty and understanding of the situation. As for your punishment, I will think on it and find something that is both fair and takes into consideration your wild instincts.” With that, Lance finally switched on the TV, and the remainder of the evening was spent with the giant and the tiny cheetah sharing a meal together. And although the weight of the impending punishment loomed over Ash, there was an undeniable sense of camaraderie between the two that had been strengthened by the day’s events. In a way, their unique relationship was evolving, forming a new bond that neither Ash nor Lance could have anticipated. Lance seized the cheetah between his massive fingers. “By the way Ash, I’m wondering, how old are you exactly ?” Ash hesitated, it was obvious Lance was a yound adult, but the cheetah was certain to be older. “So, how old ?” Insisted Lance. “44.” Replied the cheetah with embarrassement. Lance smirked and chuckled. “Well I’m 25. But I like the idea to have a pet older than me a lot, it’s also for that reason I chose you on that auction site. But you still have to call me Master, or what you already know.” Ash bristled slightly at the jaguar’s amusement at their age difference, but he knew better than to provoke Lance any further. With a reluctant sigh, he nodded in acceptance. “Yes, Master,” he replied, doing his best to swallow his pride. The colossal jaguar barely looked at Ash when he left the next morning. The cheetah passed the day locked in his cage till the jaguar came back. The giant opened the door of the cage. “You can go out of your cage if you wish to stretch your legs, but remember : no escape and you come if I call you, Ash.“ He was going to move in an other room when he stopped abruptly. He moved a small cardboard box from his pocket. He opened it, it contained a tinny ball, a futon scaled for a micro with some pillows and blankets. He put them in the cage. “For you, I guess you would like it. As a wild micro you should not be used to use a bed like that, but I think you need a more comfortable enclosure. Consider your cage as your own house.” His massive and muscular form towered above the cage again as he stood up and groped for another thing in his pocket. “I bought that too.” He said while showing a device looking like a metallic pen scaled to the immense size of the jaguar, so easily twice the length of the cheetah and probably weighing more than one ton. He pressed a switch and a bright spot of green colored light appeared on the floor in the direction the jaguar pointed it. “A laser pointer,” he said with an amused smile, \\"I’m sure you would enjoy playing this way. But not right now, I have some chores to finish.” He put the pointer on a shelf several hundreds feet above the floor. “By the way, I have not forgotten about your punishment. So don’t do anything that would worsen your situation.” He added with a chuckle before he moved out of the room. Ash couldn’t help but feel grateful for the kindness Lance had shown, despite his earlier transgressions. The items provided for his comfort and potential playing marked a significant change in the giant’s attitude towards him, and perhaps even a softening of his heart. Despite their newfound bond, Ash couldn’t ignore the lingering dread regarding the punishment he was still yet to face. He occupied himself within his enclosure, making a cozy nest for himself with the small futon, pillows, and blankets, and contemplated Lance’s motivations for the newfound generosity. Finally, next week, the day Ash had been dreading arrived. Lance entered the room with a solemn expression. “Ash,” he began, his voice carrying a seriousness that had not been present before. “It’s time for your punishment.” The giant looked down at Ash. “To start with : Heel !” He waited. “You have to come to me each time I call you this way, without any discussion.” He waited watching down the hesitant grey furred cheetah. “Heel !” His deep voice rumbled again. Ash moved with hesitation but came toward Lance. The colossus bent down and reached for the cheetah. “Good. But next time, you’d better don’t make me wait.” Lance checked the collar of his pet and his app on his smart phone. “Perfect, it’s working. Well, how do you have to call me ?” Ash looked back at the young giant and even though he was wondering why he acted this way he replied : “Master.” “Fine,” replied Lance, “I expect you to only call me this way tonight. Remember it well !” The massive musclebound jaguar looked down at his cheetah he was holding in his hand. “I registered you for a competition. It will be a race of micro cheetahs. You’ll have to run for me. I expect you to behave properly and to obey every command I give you without question.” “I’m not trained Master, I won’t win.” Replied Ash. “I don’t expect you to have the same result a properly trained cheetah, but you have a chance to show me what you can do.” Lance saw his pet was looking stressed. “Don’t worry and relax. You’ll make me proud if you behave properly. If you do, consider your punishment lifted.” “There will be other macros ?” Asked Ash. “Yes, we will be several dozens, probably. But don’t panic, only me will handle you.” “Please Master, find another punishment !” Pleaded the cheetah. “Nope, it’s too late now. I registered, and you will go.” Replied Lance. The giant jaguar brought Ash in his bedroom and put him down on the top of his desk. He seized a small box in a drawer and opened it in front of the micro. “You’ll wear this.” He said while presenting race clothes at his pet. “Cheetahs usually don’t wear shoes during the race and as you’re a wild one I thought it would be better to let you bare feet.” Lance saw Ash’s face crumpling. “Don’t worry, everything will be alright, I’m here with you.” He put the outfits in front of Ash. “Well, put them on. I will make you run after the laser pointer in my room as a quick training. We have to go in one hour.” Ash reluctantly put on the racing clothes provided by Lance. The idea of being showcased in front of several dozens of other macros unnerved him, but he had no choice. He focused on the fact that if he behaved well and obeyed Lance’s commands, his punishment would be gone. As promised, Lance spent the remaining hour letting Ash chase the laser pointer around the room. Despite Ash’s initial reluctance, the practice session ended up being surprisingly enjoyable for both of them. Ash’s natural instincts and agility as a cheetah kicked in as he hunted the elusive dot, while Lance found amusement watching his tiny pet dart around the room. At the racing grounds, the sight of so many giant macros and their respective micro cheetahs was overwhelming for Ash. He clung to Lance, his tiny body shaking, but the jaguar remained a reassuring presence. As the race began, Ash found himself driven by a fierce determination to make Lance proud. He put all his energy into running, his heart pounding as he kept up with the other racers. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Lance watching him intently, cheering him on. As the racers approached the finish line, Ash pushed himself even harder. He knew he wouldn’t be able to secure a winning position, but he needed to prove himself to Lance. As he crossed the finish line, he realized he had placed in the top ten – a significant accomplishment, considering his lack of formal training. Breathing heavily, Ash looked up at Lance, who wore an expression of genuine pride and approval. “Well done, Ash,” Lance rumbled. “It’s not common to see a pardinensis cheetah.” Rumbled a deep voice at the side of Lance. The jaguar stood up and turned on his side and saw an imposing lion approaching. “Yes, I found him in a auction site. Someone captured him as he was scavenging in his home and proposed him. I was surprised to see a rare species on such site.” Replied Lance. “You’ve been lucky.” Replied the lion. “Even on specialized sites they are rarely proposed. By the way, my name is Bassari Arouk.” “I’m Lance, Lance Mahogan.” Ash was looking up at his master and that lion. He didn’t like that other macro came so close. He saw a male micro cheetah passing and moving toward the lion, a jubatus cheetah with the usual yellowish tawny fur an black spots. Ash recognized him as being in the top ten, and even in the top five possibly. Bassari bent down and reached his massive hand down. Ash moved away but saw the lion was simply scooping the cheetah. “Good job Ran !” Said the lion. “You’ll have a good reward !” The lion was keeping his hand at the level of the track. Ash was moving away but he heard Lance murmuring : “Keep heel, Ash.” The grey furred cheetah struggled to remain close of both giants. Another cheetah, a female jubatus came, trotting toward the cupped hand of the humongous lion and climbed into, then the lion stood up holing both cheetahs in his massive hand. Ash was not sure, but he thought she was also above him in the ranking. “Wow, you own two champions !” Exclaimed Lance. The lion chuckled before calling out a third cheetah, another male jubatus. “I might have a third one if he was not so unruly.” That cheetah cast a strange look at Ash before being seized by the enormous lion fingers. “Come here you !” Rumbled the lion before putting him with the two other cheetahs. “I never saw you here before.” Said the lion while examining his three cheetahs. He carefully seized their legs between his huge fingers and stretched them out delicately as to check their state. “And you come with a pardinensis and he finishes among the first ten.” Said Bassari with a smile. “It was not the most difficult race.” Replied Lance, \\"I wanted something easy for him for the first time. \\" Ash started when he heard Lance said “for the first time” doe he intended to make him run again ? “Indeed replied the lion. I usually use this one as a warm-up for mines.” “Yes, I heard it was the reason most cheetah doesn’t have their best performances at this one, they save themselves for the next and more serious races. Your’s must be great when they put all their strengths into !” Ash was proud to have been in the top ten, but he put all hi strength in this race, and hearing most of the other competitors were in fact saving themselves made him feel downcast. “I hope they will be.” Said the lion with a smirk. “But your cheetah makes quite an impression. I didn’t see a pardinensis on this track for years, if ever you wish to sell him, feel free to contact me, I’m ready to put the price to have him, or if you want a skilled champion I would be happy to trade one of mines with your pardinensis.” Bassari looked down at Ash with a smile. Ash started to move backward but he saw Lance lifted the heel of one of his huge feet and tapped it on the ground. Lance was also surprised by the words of the lion. “No, sorry, I don’t want to sell him.” Replied the jaguar. “And I’m still trying to tame and train him, it’s a wild micro, he doesn’t always behave properly you know.” The lion chuckled. He seized the third cheetah by the scruff and lifted him to show him to Lance. “I’m used to unruly micros.” He teasingly shifted the cheetah and released him in his huge cupped hand. “You just have to be patient, although I concur an adult and perhaps middle aged wild one might impose some challenges.” Both giants saw the preparations for the next race were almost finished. “Will you make him take part to the next races ?” Asked Bassari. “I don’t think I will, replied Lance. It must have been a lot for him already. I see he is struggling to behave with all the other macros at proximity and this bustle, he is not used to it.” “I see, replied the giant lion. I think he should have enough energy for another race, although he might not reach the same ranking this time. But lot of cheetahs owners present here would like to see him run.” Lance smiled and looked down at Ash. The grey furred cheetah was not liking to have to remain close of the lion, and he was glad Lance allowed him to stay on the ground instead to be held in his hand at a closer place from Bassari. “So then, Ash. What do you think of it ? Do you want to try another race or stop right now ?” Ash didn’t reached the top ten this time. But Lance was proud of him nevertheless. The grey furred cheetah was exhausted and almost collapsed on the floor of the track. Lance was about to come to pick him up but he was stopped by a massive bull who told him no macros were allowed to walk on the race track for safety measure toward the micros. Lance scooped Ash in his massive hands when the pardinensis reached the rim of the track and the jaguar moved to a table of the bar of the venue. “You performed very well ! Consider your punishment lifted !” Said Lance. “Thank you Master.” Replied Ash. “What rank did I reach ?” “You’re 18th, out of 32 contestants. But you did it, you overcame your fears and followed the rules. When I explained to Bassari you was a wild one captured from only some weeks he was impressed you didn’t try to run away.” About the macro lion, his cheetahs performed well, Ran was third, Lene the female was fifth and Laar the unruly one was eighth. Lance saw Bassari was getting them back in his hands. He smiled and poured some water from on bottle in its cap and offered it to Ash who was still panting from the late race. As the bottle was scaled for macros Ash could barely lift the cap full of water and Lance had to help him. “Oh, you should use it instead.” Said Bassari as he moved at the table of Lance. He showed a strip where were attached several diminutive bottles scaled to the size of a micro. “It’s easier for them.” The gigantic anthropomorphic lion carefully used the tip of the huge claws of his thumb and forefinger to detach one of the bottles. He gave it to Lance, knowing Ash would be nervous too much to accept to have the huge hand of an unknown macro coming close of him. Lance thanked the lion and looked at it, his eyes squinting to read some diminutive letters, he saw it was only written “north mounts water”. “Here Ash. For you.” Ash took it and thanked both Lance and the lion. He smelled at the opening of the bottle after having open it but as he saw the three cheetahs of the lion were drinking the same kind of bottle he sipped at it. The water was fresh, more than the one of the bottle of Lance ordered from the bar of the place and it was way easier to drink in this bottle scaled at his size. Ash saw the lion ordered a red colored drink, but he doubted it was alcohol. There was two races reserved to micro canidae were African wild dogs, chacals and coyotes were running. This race was timed the way to allow the cheetahs to relax some before a third race. Ash watched some moments of it from the vast screens placed on the walls, he found it enthralling and somewhat understood the interest these macros had for it. A male macro hyena approached. “Congratulation Mister Arouk ! Your micros were spectacular tonight !” He looked at Lance. “And thank you for the show, your cheetah got attention, several spectators and enthusiasts posted photos of him on the net.” Ash stopped to drink when the hyena started to speak at his master. As a former wild micro used to live hidden and unnoticed, he was not enjoying the idea to draw attention from the macros at all. “I knew pardinensis were rare, but I was not aware he would draw so much attention in a place like this.” Replied Lance. “It’s the first time I see one alive.” Replied the hyena. Ash’s ears pricked up as he heard the word “alive”. “There are not so much enthusiasts who own one.” Continued the hyena. “Perhaps you should get in touch with some other owners, the ones who have a female might be interested to get cubs.” Ash was not liking this idea at all, and seeing Lance looking interested made the pardinensis cheetah feeling worried. “I know one of them.” Said Bassari. “But even when you have a couple, it’s not easy to make them reproduce. At least naturally.” Lance looked thoughtful as he listened to Bassari and the hyena, considering their suggestions. Ash, on the other hand, felt a growing unease at the idea of being used for breeding purposes with other macros. There was still so much he didn’t understand about this world he’d been thrust into, and the thought of being forced into such an intimate situation with a stranger was incredibly distressing. However, his thoughts were quickly interrupted when the next race began. The excitement and energy around him were infectious, and before he knew it, he’d been swept up in the excitement of cheering for the competitors. For a brief moment, he was able to forget about his fears and simply enjoy the thrill of the races. After the races had finished, Lance scooped Ash back up into his hand, carefully cradling the exhausted cheetah. Despite their differing opinions on Ash’s future, it was clear that a bond had formed between them, one that would continue to grow as they faced the challenges of navigating the complicated world of macros and micros together. As they walked home, Ash couldn’t shake the lingering thoughts of what may come next in his life. Would Lance truly force him into breeding situations, or would he listen to Ash’s concerns and find alternative ways to satisfy his interest in owning rare pardinensis cheetahs? Only time would tell, but for now, the tiny cheetah took solace in the fact that he had a giant on his side, one who had shown him kindness and protection in a world that was so much larger and more dangerous than he could have ever imagined. Next week end, Bassari came with Lance in a park the jaguar was used to bring Ash to allow him to stretch his legs. Lance explained he usually sat in the lawn and allowed Ash to freely move around in the giant sized blades of grass and other plants at the condition he didn’t go far too much of him and he came back if the giant call him. Lance and Bassari sat in the lawn, Lance put Ash on the ground and Bassari put the pair of cheetahs he brought with him, Laar, the unruly cheetah from the previous race event, and one of the cub ones to start to familiarize him with new environments than the home of his enormous lion owner. The young cheetah stayed very close of his master, fascinated with the new and gigantic environment of the park but intimidated too. Lance and Bassari focused most of their attention on him as the cheetah cub was jolting at the mere breeze although he watched at the giant plants with eyes filled with wonder. Bassari picked up the ball looking flower of a clover and moved it gently in front of the cub who smiled and started to play with it. Lance watched with an amused expression. Laar, walked farther from the lion and after some moment he caught up with Ash who was already some dozen of feet away from the two sitting yet looming colossi. “Ash ? It’s your name, isn’t it ?” Said the cheetah. “Mine is Laar. We already meet on the race track.” “I remember you.” Replied Ash. “So, you’re used to come here ? It’s very big ! These trees, the ones in my master garden are not so huge.” As they two cheetahs walked they disturbed a macro moth. The insect was about 30 inches long and with a wingspan of 55 inches. Its front wings were greyish like the bark of a tree but the rear ones were colored with a brilliant orange. It flitted briefly and landed on a blade of grass about tenth feet away. “Woah ! I never saw one like that !” Cried out Laar. “You never saw moths before ?” Asked Ash with surprise. “I did. There are some that enter in our room sometime and in the garden of my master. But it’s rare to see them so close. And did you saw the color of this one ?” Ash shrugged, it’s was not such a rare sight for him. “Ash, do you think I can catch it ?” “Some moths are toxic, if you bite them, but they don’t bite.” Replied Ash. Laar stealthily approached the moth with the eyes sparkling with amazement, his feline instincts boiling to catch the insect. Ash walked slowly behind as he watched the jubatus cheetah trying his best to leap on the insect. Ash snickered as he saw Laar jolting backward when the moth unfolded its wings abruptly and fluttered about before landing some distance away. Laar glared back at Ash, but asked him if he could give him some help. Ash was game to do so, after all he had feline instinct too and it was a long time he didn’t caught an animal. Both cheetahs approached and Laar jumped toward the moth. He ended with a tiny bit of its wing and looked at his hands as he saw grey wing scales of the moth were stuck on them, he wiped them on a blade of grass. “Yes, there wings are fragile.” Said Ash. “I would like to have it intact, to bring it as a trophy and show it to the other cheetahs.” Replied Laar. The moth landed a bit farther this time and was looking more agitated after having been disturbed in this more brutal way. The twos cheetah approached it stealthily again. But as they were close the collar of Laar started to rang. “Damnit!” Shouted the jubatus. They also heard louder beeps coming far from behind and they saw it was the watch on the massive wrist of Bassari. The lion realized he didn’t watched Laar carefully enough as he were chatting with Lance and had most of his attention focused on the cub. He let the cub with Lance, the young cheetah looked worried to be left alone with the jaguar but Lance gently scooped him in his massive hand and told him to not worry. The steps of the colossal 185 feet tall lion resounded on the ground under the thousands of tons of his weight as he approached.","output":"Ash and Laar quickly backed away from the moth, knowing that their fun was over now that Bassari had noticed their absence. As the giant lion neared, he bent down to scoop up Laar in his massive hand, giving Ash a stern look. \\"I hope you've both enjoyed your little adventure, but it's time we headed back,\\" Bassari rumbled, his deep voice carrying a note of annoyance. Despite the slightly scary situation, Ash couldn't help but feel a flicker of gratitude towards the jubatus cheetah for providing a fun and thrilling distraction from his worries. Lance, still holding the young cheetah cub, stood up and accompanied Bassari, the two cheetahs and the young cub back to his house. Once inside, Bassari informed Laar that he would need to discuss the situation with Lance further before determining any potential punishment for their rule-breaking. He and Lance then headed to another room to talk privately, leaving Ash, Laar, and the young cub alone together. As the door closed behind the giants, Ash glanced over at Laar, who wore a surprisingly nonchalant expression on his face. \\"Well, that was fun while it lasted,\\" Laar said with a small chuckle. \\"We should do it again sometime.\\" Ash, however, was more worried about what their actions might lead to in terms of punishments. He might have only narrowly escaped one ordeal, but who knew what Lance or Bassari might decide if they felt their trust had been broken once again? In the end, both Ash and Laar received a relatively mild scolding from their respective masters, with the warning of more severe consequences if they were caught disobeying the rules again. Despite the mild punishment, the experience had served to remind Ash of the delicate balance that existed between him and Lance, and reinforced his determination to find a way to live in this strange world of giants without sacrificing his freedom completely. As for Laar, the jubatus cheetah remained somewhat of a mystery to Ash. He couldn't help"},{"instruction":"Сделай ответ для интервью от 2 до 4 минут на вопрос: Какие объекты у нас есть в продаже (рассказать об объектах) туда входят Гостиница Бумеранг Номер «Люкс» 52 м2 - 2 основных и 2 дополнительных места. от 8 500 000 рублей Доступно в продаже 1/2 доли объекта 4 500 000 рублей Номер «Стандарт» 17 м2 - 3 человека с дополнительным местом.

Der Begriff Orgellandschaft allein nimmt Bezug auf die historisch bedingten regionalen Eigenheiten der Orgeln. 60 der ostfriesischen Orgeln stammen aus der Zeit vor 1850. Hinzu kommen 15 historische Prospekte, hinter denen neue Werke eingebaut sind. Während im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert der niederländische Orgelbau für Ostfriesland prägend war, traten im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert Einflüsse aus Hamburg und Westfalen hinzu. Der ostfriesische Orgelbau im 19. Jahrhundert war bis etwa 1870 konservativ ausgerichtet und schuf Instrumente nach barocken Bauprinzipien. Da zwischen 1870 und 1950 verhältnismäßig wenig neue Orgelwerke gebaut wurden, blieben viele historische Instrumente erhalten. Fast alle Originalinstrumente wurden in den letzten 50 Jahren in vorbildlicher Weise restauriert, sodass sie in der Klanggestalt wieder ihrem Ursprung nahekommen und weltweit Impulse für Restaurierungspraxis und Orgelbau gegeben haben. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten wurde in zunehmendem Maß der Wert dieser Instrumente ins öffentliche Bewusstsein gerufen und die Orgellandschaft Ostfriesland Orgelbauern und Organisten aus aller Welt, aber auch einem breiten Publikum erschlossen.', 'Geografische Verbreitung.', 'In der Karte sind alle erhaltenen bedeutenden Orgeln Ostfrieslands eingetragen. Durch die Darstellung wird die hohe Dichte an historischen Werken illustriert, die in der Krummhörn eine besondere Konzentration aufweist. Die Farbe zeigt das Jahrhundert an, in dem das Instrument errichtet wurde, sofern der Grundbestand noch im Wesentlichen erhalten ist. Ist nur noch der Prospekt original, wird dies durch einen Ring dargestellt. Die Form des Zeichens gibt den Bedeutungsgrad an. Die Kategorien für die Einordnung sind dem grundlegenden Werk von Harald Vogel: \\"Orgellandschaft Ostfriesland\\" entnommen.', 'Unter \\"Siehe auch\\" finden sich Listen, die für jeden der Landkreise Ostfrieslands vollständige Übersichten aller Orgeln mit weiteren Informationen bieten.', 'Geschichte.', 'Gotik.', 'Als im Laufe der Gotik die Orgel zum Hauptinstrument in der christlichen Liturgie aufstieg, hielten Orgeln in vielen Kirchen Einzug. Schon für die spätgotische Zeit ist in Ostfriesland eine blühende Orgelkultur dokumentiert, die vor allem durch die Niederlande geprägt war, wo im 15. bis 17. Jahrhundert ein Zentrum des nordeuropäischen Orgelbaus lag. So sind allein in der Krummhörn zehn Orgelwerke aus der zweiten Hälfte des 15. Jahrhunderts nachweisbar, als Ostfriesland unter Ulrich I. eine Blütezeit erfuhr. Zu diesen ersten Orgeln zählt das Werk von Meister Thidricus de Dominis, das die Marienkirche in Marienhafe 1437 erhielt. Im Jahr 1480 erbaute Meister Hinrick für Emden ein Orgelwerk. Um 1500 besaßen bereits viele ostfriesische Klöster und Kirchen eine Orgel. Diese gotischen Instrumente waren sogenannte Blockwerke, bei denen die einzelnen Pfeifenreihen noch nicht separat bedient werden konnten, sondern immer das volle Werk erklang. Die Pfeifen wurden in der Regel aus gehämmertem Blei gefertigt und die Labien weisen die charakteristischen gotischen Spitzbögen auf. In der Regel wurden die Instrumente bis ins 17. Jahrhundert hinein mit reich bemalten Flügeltüren versehen. Diese verschließbaren Türen wurden aus künstlerischen, klanglichen und liturgischen, aber auch aus praktischen Gründen angebracht, um die Orgel vor Vogelkot und sonstigen Verschmutzungen zu schützen.', 'Eine dieser weltweit ältesten, noch in ihrem Grundbestand erhaltenen und bis heute spielbaren Orgeln steht in Rysum. Das Instrument wurde wahrscheinlich um das Jahr 1440 von Meister Harmannus aus Groningen gebaut, der auch mit der Orgel der Groninger Martinikerk (um 1450) in Verbindung gebracht wird. Die Rysumer bezahlten in Naturalien und baten den lokalen Häuptling Olde Imell schriftlich um Erlaubnis.', 'Ursprünglich ist dieses Instrument wahrscheinlich ein Blockwerk mit einem Tonumfang H–f2 für die mittlere bis hohe Tonlage (den \\"Diskant\\") mit einem Basswerk gewesen, dessen Pfeifen im Prospekt mit den originalen Mensuren erhalten geblieben sind. Ein Hebel beim Spieltisch für diesen Prästanten zeugt noch von der Transformation des Blockwerks in ein Orgelwerk mit Schleifladen. Wahrscheinlich ist dieser Umbau ins Jahr 1513 zu datieren, denn die in die Empore eingefügte Organistenkanzel trägt diese Jahreszahl. Die Prinzipalregister aus gehämmertem Metall sind stärkstens bleihaltig und klingen ungewöhnlich dunkel und intensiv. Eindrucksvoll ist das Zusammenspiel von Orgel und Glocke, wie Harald Vogel es anhand der \\"Redeuntes\\"-Kompositionen aus dem Buxheimer Orgelbuch demonstriert hat. Bis dahin waren die langen orgelpunktartigen Haltetöne im Bass liturgisch nicht zu deuten. Durch den Einsatz der Glocke, die in Rysum mit der Tonhöhe der Orgel übereinstimmt, konnten diese Kompositionen musikalisch neu erschlossen werden. Das Gehäuse der Rysumer Orgel zeichnet sich durch kräftige Stollenprofile aus, wie es ganz ähnlich beim gotischen Untergehäuse in Westerhusen zu sehen ist. Die Pfeifenfelder mit ihren Schleierbrettern, den auslaufenden Spitzbögen und (rekonstruierten) bekrönenden Fialen weisen typisch spätgotische Kennzeichen auf.', 'Spätrenaissance und Frühbarock.', 'Im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert stand Ostfriesland unter dem Einfluss der niederländischen und hamburgischen Orgelkultur. Emden war im 16. Jahrhundert das Zentrum des ostfriesischen Orgelbaus. Petrus von Emden baute 1520 eine Orgel für Groothusen. Von Johannes Emedensis („von Emden“) ist bezeugt, dass er 1531 eine Orgel für Uphusen baute, von der noch die späteren Flügeltüren (1571) und Gehäusefüllungen erhalten sind. Der kunstvolle Prospekt seiner Orgel (1526) im niederländischen Scheemda mit seinen ziselierten Pfeifen befindet sich heute im Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. Religionsflüchtlinge reformierten Glaubens, die im Zuge des Achtzigjährigen Krieges aus den Niederlanden flohen und in Emden Aufnahme fanden, prägten im ausgehenden 16. und beginnenden 17. Jahrhundert auch den Orgelbau in Ostfriesland. Vom äußeren Aufbau her sind der zentrale polygonale Bassturm und zwei seitliche Spitztürme für die Pfeifen in Tenorlage kennzeichnend. Die hohen (und entsprechend kurzen) Pfeifen im Diskant sind dazwischen in zwei Flachfeldern angeordnet, die nicht selten doppelgeschossig angelegt sind. Wesentliches verdankt der Hamburger Prospekt diesem niederländischen Einfluss. Der ursprüngliche Umfang der Klaviaturen bei Instrumenten aus der Renaissance von FGA–g2a2 wurde im Laufe der Jahrhunderte auf den modernen Umfang ab C ausgeweitet. Kennzeichnend für den Renaissancestil sind zudem die Art des Schleierwerks über den Prospektpfeifen, die Bekrönungen auf den Pfeifentürmen und die durchlaufenden Spruchbänder. Hervorzuheben ist, dass bei vielen ostfriesischen Orgeln des 17. Jahrhunderts Pfeifenmaterial aus den Vorgängerinstrumenten des 16. Jahrhunderts wiederverwendet wurde. Mit dem aufkommenden Zeitalter des Barock wichen die Flügeltüren seitlichen Ohren aus Schleierwerk.', 'Die Orgel der Großen Kirche in Leer geht auf die Orgel aus dem Kloster Thedinga zurück, die wahrscheinlich der deutsch-niederländische Orgelbauer Andreas de Mare um 1570 gebaut hatte. Als Graf Enno III. im Jahr 1609 der reformierten Kirchengemeinde in Leer diese Orgel schenkte, baute Marten de Mare sie in ein Renaissanceinstrument für die alte Liudgeri-Kirche um. 1787 wurde die Orgel in die Große Kirche überführt und erfuhr im Laufe der Jahrhunderte mehrere Erweiterungen zu einer großen Stadtorgel, wobei der jeweilige Grundbestand im Wesentlichen erhalten blieb. Das innere Tragwerk des Hauptwerks stammt wahrscheinlich noch aus der de-Mare-Orgel, deren Proportionen sich noch im Prospekt widerspiegeln.', 'Der niederländische Orgelbauer Johannes Millensis baute die Orgel in Larrelt in den Jahren 1618 bis 1619 unter Verwendung älterer Register aus dem 16. Jahrhundert. In den Jahren 1848 bis 1855 wurde das Werk von Gerd Sieben Janssen eingreifend umgebaut, wobei etwa die Hälfte der alten Register wiederverwendet wurden. Die Orgel spiegelt den frühen niederländischen Einfluss auf den Orgelbau in Ostfriesland wider und gilt mit ihren alten Bleipfeifen zur Darstellung der vokal beeinflussten Polyphonie der Renaissance als besonders geeignet.', 'Die kostbare Spätrenaissance-Orgel in Osteel, die eine der besterhaltenen Renaissanceorgeln Norddeutschlands ist, stammt ebenfalls von einem deutsch-niederländischen Orgelbauer: Edo Evers aus Groningen. Evers verwendete für sein Werk aus dem Jahr 1619 Pfeifen und Teile des Gehäuses aus der alten Andreas-de-Mare-Orgel (1566–67) der Ludgerikirche in Norden. Charakteristisch sind die reichen Verzierungen auf der jeweils mittleren Prospektpfeife in jedem Turm. Die Einzelregister zeichnen sich durch klangliche Eleganz und hohe vokale Qualität aus. Da sie auch in den verschiedenen Kombinationen ihre große Transparenz bewahren, sind sie insbesondere für die Aufführung der polyphonen Renaissancemusik einsetzbar.', 'Wesentlich für die weitere Entwicklung des Orgelbaus war, dass in Ostfriesland ab dem Jahr 1640 im Gottesdienst die Orgelbegleitung für den Gemeindegesang eingeführt wurde. Vorher sang die Gemeinde unbegleitet, die Orgel hatte nur liturgische Funktion. Sie spielte in größeren Kirchen im Wechsel mit dem Chor oder übernahm einzelne \\"Orgelverse\\", also Bearbeitungen von Motetten, Chorälen oder Psalmen. Zum ersten Mal wird 1640 in Emden von dem Versuch berichtet, die Orgel zum bevorstehenden Weihnachtsfest gemeinsam mit der Gemeinde erklingen zu lassen, nachdem vonseiten der Gemeinde der Antrag', 'Nach derartig zögerlichen Anfängen setzte sich die Orgel schnell in ihrer neuen Funktion zur Gesangsbegleitung durch, was aber eine neue Klangkonzeption erforderlich machte.', 'Mit ihren trotz beschränkter Disposition kräftigen Klängen wurde die Orgel in Westerhusen von Jost Sieburg (1642–43) speziell für einen starken Gemeindegesang konzipiert. Zu diesem Zweck wurde ein Großteil der Register aus der gotischen Vorgängerorgel (um 1500) hinter einem Hamburger Prospekt umgearbeitet. Die weiten, stark bleihaltigen gotischen Prinzipalregister wurden aufgeschnitten und in engerer Mensur wieder zugelötet. Das hatte verhältnismäßig breite Labien zur Folge. Kräftig und obertonreich erklingt der Vier-Fuß-Prinzipal im Prospekt.

Die hauptsächlichen Siedlungsgebiete lagen auf den Inseln Manhattan und Long Island sowie entlang der Flüsse Hudson, Delaware und Connecticut. Verwaltungssitz war Nieuw Amsterdam, das spätere New York.', 'Die wichtigsten Exportgüter der Kolonie, die unter ihrem letzten Direktor, Petrus Stuyvesant, einen raschen Aufschwung nahm, waren Pelze und der auf den fruchtbaren Böden angebaute Tabak. 1664, kurz vor Beginn des zweiten englisch-niederländischen Seekrieges, wurde Nieuw Amsterdam von den Briten erobert. Im Frieden von Breda traten die Niederlande 1667 die Kolonie an England ab. Nach einer kurzfristigen Rückeroberung Nieuw Amsterdams fiel das Gebiet im Frieden von Westminster 1674 endgültig an die britische Krone.', 'Geschichte.', 'Pelzhändler und Handelskompanien.', 'Obwohl der Küstenstreifen im Mündungsgebiet des später als „Hudson River“ bezeichneten Flusses schon seit Verrazzanos und Gomez’ Entdeckungsreisen im 16. Jahrhundert bekannt war, begann das Interesse der Niederländer an dieser Gegend erst zu Beginn des 17. Jahrhunderts. Der Engländer Henry Hudson war den später nach ihm benannten Fluss 1609 hinaufgesegelt und hatte bei einigen der dort lebenden Indianer Tabak und Pelze eingetauscht. Als die Nachricht von Hudsons Reise in die Vereinigten Niederlande gelangte, versprachen sich Teile der Amsterdamer Kaufmannschaft hohe Gewinne aus dem lukrativen Pelzhandel. Mehrere konkurrierende Gruppen von Kaufleuten, Reedern und Schiffern schickten in den Jahren nach 1610 Schiffe nach Nordamerika und überboten sich gegenseitig im Preis für die von den Indianern eingehandelten Pelze.', 'Da bald klar wurde, dass die zu erzielende Gewinnspanne im ohnehin kostenintensiven und risikobehafteten Überseegeschäft durch diese Praxis drastisch sank, verständigten sich die einstmaligen Konkurrenten und gründeten die \\"Compagnie van Nieuwnederlant\\" (Neuniederland-Kompanie). Diese Handelskompanie erhielt von den Generalstaaten am 27. März 1614 ein Monopol, das ihnen für die folgenden drei Jahre vier Schiffsreisen in das Gebiet zwischen 40° und 45° nördlicher Breite erlaubte. Im Oktober 1618, zehn Monate nach Ablauf des Handelsmonopols, bewarb sich die Kompanie um ein neues Oktroi. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt wurde von den Generalstaaten aber bereits die Gründung einer neuen Kompanie, der \\"Geoctroyeerde West-Indische Compagnie\\" (Niederländische Westindien-Kompanie, kurz \\"WIC\\") als Pendant zur \\"VOC\\" erwogen.', 'Kurz nachdem 1621 nach zwölfjährigem Waffenstillstand der Unabhängigkeitskampf der Niederländer gegen die Spanier wieder aufgeflammt war, oktroyierten die Generalstaaten ein Handelspatent für die neu gegründete Westindien-Kompanie aus. Dabei hatten sie nicht so sehr die Besiedlung überseeischer Gebiete als vielmehr deren wirtschaftliche Ausbeutung und zugleich eine militärische Unterstützung durch die Schiffe der privat finanzierten Handelskompanie im Sinn. Aus diesem Grund dauerte es auch zwei Jahre, bis ausreichende Geldmittel bereitstanden, da die niederländische Finanzwelt dem Projekt zunächst abwartend gegenüberstand. So erreichte erst im Herbst 1623 mit der \\"Maackreel\\" ein Kompanieschiff die Neue Welt. Die \\"Maackreel\\" handelte während des folgenden Winters entlang des Hudson und kehrte im Sommer 1624 in die Heimat zurück. 1624 kamen mit der \\"Eendracht\\" und der \\"Nieu Nederlandt\\" die ersten Siedler an der amerikanischen Ostküste an.', 'Erste Kolonisten.', 'Da der englische Botschafter im Haag 1622 britische Ansprüche auf das Gebiet um den Hudson River (ndl. \\"Noortrivier\\") angemeldet hatte, war es aus Sicht der Niederländer nötig, rasch Tatsachen zu schaffen, um die eigenen Interessen zu untermauern. Um möglichst weite Gebietsansprüche zu manifestieren, wurden die mit der \\"Eendracht\\" angekommenen Kolonisten unter Adrian Joriszoon Thienpont auf mehrere Punkte am Connecticut River (ndl. \\"Versche rivier\\"), am Delaware River (ndl. \\"Zuidrivier\\"), an der Mündung des Hudson und weiter stromaufwärts verteilt. An dem Punkt, an dem die heutige Stadt Albany liegt, wurde 1624 Fort Oranje gegründet.', 'Die Siedler, die mit der \\"Nieu Nederlandt\\" in der später ebenso genannten Kolonie ankamen, waren protestantische Wallonen, die aus den Spanischen Niederlanden vertrieben worden waren, 30 Familien, bestehend aus 110 Personen um Cornelis Jacobszoon May. Um sich besser gegen befürchtete Angriffe schützen zu können, ließen sie sich zunächst auf der kleinen, Manhattan vorgelagerten Insel \\"Pagganack\\" (ndl. \\"Noten Eylandt\\") nieder, dem heutigen Governors Island.', 'Die Siedler fanden ein Land vor, das fruchtbar war, gute Jagd- und Fischgründe besaß und vor allem ein verträglicheres Klima bot als etwa die niederländischen Kolonien an der Westküste Afrikas oder in der Karibik. In zeitgenössischen Beschreibungen wurden die geografischen Gegebenheiten in erster Linie unter dem Gesichtspunkt der wirtschaftlichen Zweckmäßigkeit beurteilt. Den größten Raum in zeitgenössischen Beschreibungen nahmen jedoch die Indianer ein, die in niederländischen Quellen zumeist als die \\"wilden\\" bezeichnet werden. Unter ihnen waren die westlich von Fort Oranje lebenden Mohawk die wichtigsten Pelzlieferanten der Niederländer. Obwohl sich vor allem die Kommunikation zwischen Siedlern und Indianern aufgrund der gegenseitigen Sprachunkenntnis schwierig gestaltete, lebten beide Gruppen bis zum Ende der 1630er Jahre weitgehend konfliktfrei nebeneinander.', 'Gründung von „Nieuw Amsterdam“.', 'Der Vertrag von Cornelis Jacobszoon May als Direktor der Kolonie lief nach einem Jahr aus. Sein Nachfolger Willem Verhulst erhielt im April 1625 von der \\"WIC\\" die Anweisung, die Siedler in einer größeren Ansiedlung zu konzentrieren – wahrscheinlich um Kosten zu sparen und sich zugleich besser gegen mögliche Angriffe verteidigen zu können. Als Verhulst bei der Gründung Nieuw Amsterdams an der südlichen Spitze der Insel Manhattan Führungsschwächen erkennen ließ, wurde er im Frühjahr 1626 durch Peter Minuit ersetzt. Minuit kaufte den Indianern die Insel Manhattan im Jahr 1626 für die legendäre Summe von 60 Gulden ab, wobei die Indianer den Gegenwert wahrscheinlich in Form verschiedener Handelswaren erhielten. Im November 1626 erreichte die Nachricht Amsterdam, und Pieter Janszoon Schaghen, mit der Leitung der Westindien-Angelegenheiten betraut, gab die Nachricht in dem heute berühmten \\"Schaghen-Brief\\" an die Generalstaaten weiter.', 'Während die weiter im Landesinneren gelegenen Siedlungen bis zum Ende der niederländischen Ära Nieuw Nederlands größtenteils ihren Charakter als reine Pelzhandelsstationen inmitten indianischen Stammesgebiets behielten, war Nieuw Amsterdam nicht nur das Zentrum für Handel und Schifffahrt der Kolonie, sondern wurde allmählich auch zum Standort unterschiedlicher Gewerbebetriebe.', 'Siedlungsproblematik und die Reaktion der „WIC“.', 'Menschen, die im 17. Jahrhundert Europa verließen und in die Neue Welt aufbrachen, hatten verschiedene Gründe für ihre Entscheidung. Die wichtigsten Motive für eine Emigration waren wirtschaftlicher oder religiöser Natur. Daran gemessen hatten die Niederländer nur wenig Anlass, die Strapazen der im Schnitt zwei- bis dreimonatigen Schiffsreise auf sich zu nehmen. In der ersten Hälfte des 17. Jahrhunderts boomte die Wirtschaft der Niederlande; man spricht in diesem Zusammenhang auch vom \\"Gouden eeuw\\", dem Goldenen Zeitalter. Ähnlich sah es mit der religiös motivierten Auswanderung aus: im Unterschied zu den englischen Kolonien kamen nur sehr wenige Religionsflüchtlinge nach Nieuw Nederland, weil die Republik der Vereinigten Niederlande im Vergleich zu anderen europäischen Staaten der Zeit in Glaubensfragen toleranter war. Die Folge hiervon war, dass Nieuw Nederland bis zur Mitte des Jahrhunderts unter einem chronischen Mangel an Siedlern zu leiden hatte, was die Kolonie – im Vergleich zu anderen Territorien an der Ostküste Nordamerikas – in ihrer Entwicklung hemmte.', 'Die \\"WIC\\" begegnete diesem Problem mit unterschiedlichen Maßnahmen. Zum einen warb sie über Werbeschriften im Ausland verstärkt um deutsche, flämische und wallonische Emigranten, zum anderen versuchte sie potentielle Siedler durch eine Lockerung der Handelsbestimmungen zu gewinnen. Hierbei standen sich in der \\"WIC\\" zwei Interessenlager gegenüber: Die Handelsfraktion wollte die Besiedlungskosten niedrig halten und möglichst große Gewinne aus dem Pelzhandel erzielen. Die Siedlungsfraktion verfolgte den genau entgegengesetzten Ansatz und erhoffte sich aus einer stärkeren landwirtschaftlichen Nutzung der Kolonie auf lange Sicht gesehen eine Ablösung des Baltikums als Lieferanten für das in den Niederlanden benötigte Getreide. Ein breitflächiger Getreideanbau direkt in Übersee hätte zudem womöglich die äußerst kostspieligen Versorgungslieferungen nach Brasilien oder Curaçao ersetzen können. Im Juni 1629 kam es zu einem Kompromiss. Das Monopol der \\"WIC\\" auf den lukrativen Pelzhandel blieb zunächst bestehen, und im Gegenzug ermöglichte die Handelskompanie einigen ihrer finanzstarken Direktoren den Aufbau einer erblichen Grundherrschaft in Übersee. Die \\"WIC\\" überließ den Grundherren, den so genannten \\"patroonen\\", kleine Einheiten privaten Landbesitzes, auf denen diese weitgehende Rechte – von der Steuererhebung bis hin zur Rechtsprechung – erhielten. Im Gegenzug verpflichtete sich der \\"patroon\\", innerhalb von vier Jahren mindestens fünfzig Menschen im Alter von über fünfzehn Jahren auf seinem Besitz anzusiedeln. Doch das Patronatsystem scheiterte. Immer wieder kam es zu Konflikten zwischen den Eigentümern und der \\"WIC\\" oder zwischen Siedlern und Indianern.

Ihre Ursprünge reichen bis in die spätgotische Zeit zurück. Aber erst im 17. Jahrhundert entstand eine eigenständige sächsische Orgellandschaft. Der Kulturraum war in der Geschichte wechselnden Einflüssen benachbarter Orgellandschaften unterworfen, was dadurch begünstigt wurde, dass sich die Gebietsgrenzen im Verlauf der Jahrhunderte mehrfach änderten. Von den insgesamt etwa 2500 Orgeln der sächsischen Kulturregion sind mehr als 130 historische Instrumente vom 17. bis 19. Jahrhundert vollständig oder größtenteils erhalten. Die Region ist nachhaltig durch das Wirken von Gottfried Silbermann und seiner Schule geprägt. In der Moderne zeichnet sich die Orgellandschaft durch zahlreiche Restaurierungen und Rekonstruktionen historischer Instrumente aus, die durch einige überregional bedeutende Neubauten unterschiedlicher Stilrichtungen ergänzt werden.', 'Der Artikel befasst sich mit der Geschichte des Orgelbaus und den erhaltenen Orgeln in Sachsen. Weiterführende Informationen zu einzelnen Instrumenten sind in der Liste von Orgeln in Sachsen und in der Liste der Orgeln in Dresden zu finden.', 'Gotik und Renaissance.', 'Bedeutende Orgelbauer und ihre Werke.', 'Die älteste Orgel Sachsens ist für das Jahr 1298 in der Görlitzer Peterskirche nachweisbar. Im Meißner Dom ist 1362, im Bautzener Dom St. Petri 1372, in der Zwickauer St.-Marien-Kirche 1383 und in der Leipziger Thomaskirche 1384 ein Orgelwerk erstmals belegt. Das Zeitalter der Gotik wurde von international tätigen Orgelbauern beherrscht, was europaweit zu einem recht einheitlichen Baustil führte. Der Bautzener Dom erhielt im Jahr 1502 eine neue Orgel des Orgelbauers Burkhard Dinstlinger aus Südtirol, der süddeutsch-österreichische Einflüsse auf das sächsische Kurfürstentum vermittelte. Sein Schüler Blasius Lehmann eröffnete eine Werkstatt in Bautzen und schuf Instrumente für die Thomaskirche in Leipzig und die Dresdner Kreuzkirche. Er war zugleich Hoforganist des brandenburgischen Kurfürsten Joachim I. und hielt sich von 1516 bis 1519 an dessen Hof auf. Lehmanns Wirkungsbereich erstreckte sich bis nach Danzig. In vorreformatorischer Zeit verfügten die großen Stadtkirchen in Meißen (1372), Dresden (1389), Zwickau (1445), Leipzig (1489) und Görlitz (1507) bereits über zwei Orgeln, eine große Hauptorgel auf der Westempore oder im südlichen Querschiff und ein kleines Instrument in Altarnähe im Chor.', 'In der Oberlausitz, die bis 1635 zum Königreich Böhmen gehörte, war ein starker Einfluss böhmischer Orgelbauer zu verzeichnen. Albrecht Rudner aus Budweis setzte 1570 die Orgel der Zittauer Johanniskirche instand und erweiterte ihre Disposition. Ähnliche Arbeiten führte er 1577 an der Görlitzer Orgel von Dinstlinger (1503–1505) aus. Im albertinischen Sachsen galt Johann Lange in Kamenz in der zweiten Hälfte des 16. Jahrhunderts als führender Orgelbauer. Der mutmaßliche Schüler von Hans Scherer dem Älteren (Hamburg) verwendete die Schleiflade und führte zahlreiche Neuerungen ein. Ebenso wie der zeitgleich wirkende Niederländer Hermann Raphael Rodensteen, der sich 1559 in Zwickau niedergelassen hatte, brachte Lange die hoch entwickelte brabantische Orgelbaukunst nach Sachsen. Aus der Zeit vor dem Dreißigjährigen Krieg sind keine Orgeln erhalten. Der Joachimsthaler Orgelbauer Jacob Schedlich baute im 17. Jahrhundert zahlreiche Orgeln in Böhmen und im Erzgebirge, zeitgleich mit dem deutsch-böhmischen Orgelbauer Matthias Tretzscher.', 'Einer der innovativsten deutschen Orgelbauer des frühen 17. Jahrhunderts war Gottfried Fritzsche (Frietzsch). Er wurde 1578 in Meißen geboren und wirkte dort bis 1612. Um 1614 wurde er kurfürstlich-sächsischer Hoforgelbauer in Dresden, wo er bis 1619 eine Werkstatt führte. Er entwickelte den brabantischen Orgelbau weiter. Beispiele seiner zahlreichen Neuerungen waren neue Zungenregister, ungewöhnliche Fußtonlagen (Tonhöhen) und neue Neben- und Effektregister. Seine berühmte Orgel für die Schlosskapelle Dresden (1610–1614) entstand im Zusammenwirken mit Hans Leo Hassler. Sie verfügte über 33 Register, darunter zwei in Ein-Fuß-Lage (im Brustwerk und Pedal) und zwei zweifache Zimbeln sowie drei Tremulanten, Zimbelstern, „Vogelsang“ und „Heer Trummel“. Die Schlossorgel ist ebenso wie die beiden Frietzsch-Orgeln in Meißen nicht erhalten, soll aber originalgetreu rekonstruiert werden. Die Disposition ist in der \\"Organographia\\" von Michael Praetorius (1619) überliefert.', 'Die ältesten erhaltenen sächsischen Orgeln stammen aus dem 17. Jahrhundert. Sie verfügen über ein Manual und ein kleines, aber selbstständiges Pedalwerk. Die Orgel in der Alten Kirche von Coswig, welche im Jahre 1615 oder 1624 erbaut wurde, stammt von Frietzsch oder vom sächsischen Hoforgelbauer Tobias Weller. In den 1620er Jahren baute ein unbekannter Orgelbauer in der Wehrgangkirche Lauterbach ein kleines Instrument, das 1957 unter Einbeziehung der erhaltenen Teile fast vollständig neu gebaut wurde. Die ältesten Teile der Orgel in der Dorfkirche Rossau wurden um 1660 gefertigt. Die älteste weitgehend erhaltene Orgel Sachsens steht in der Wehrkirche Pomßen. Das Werk von Gottfried Richter (1670–1671) hat ein historisierendes Gehäuse im Stil der Spätrenaissance mit Flügeltüren in Grisaille und drei bossierte Pfeifen im Prospekt mit gedrehten Füßen. Aus der Zeit um 1670 stammt die Orgel eines unbekannten Erbauers in der Dorfkirche Lippersdorf (eventuell ebenfalls von Richter).', 'Kennzeichen und Funktion.', 'Im Zeitalter der Gotik war der Orgelbau europaweit weitgehend vereinheitlicht. Erst im 17. Jahrhundert bildeten sich regional unterschiedliche Orgellandschaften heraus. Die gotischen Orgeln waren Blockwerke, deren Register nur im vollen Werk, aber nicht einzeln anzuspielen waren. Mit Hilfe von Sperrventilladen konnten einzelne Teilwerke separat genutzt werden, so um 1500 bei den Orgeln auf Schloss Altenburg und in der Leipziger Paulinerkirche. Erst die Erfindung der Schleiflade und der Springlade ermöglichte es, einzelne Pfeifenreihen getrennt zu bedienen, was die Klangmöglichkeiten multiplizierte. Diese Technik setzte sich in Sachsen im Laufe des 15. Jahrhunderts durch. Über Details der Orgeln vor 1500 ist allerdings nichts bekannt. Ab etwa 1500 kam als erste Zungenstimme das Regal-Register zum Einsatz. Das 16. Jahrhundert brachte technische und klangliche Verbesserungen mit sich. Auf der Grundlage der Schleifladenkonstruktion wurden im Zeitalter der Renaissance zahlreiche neue Register erfunden.', 'Bis zur Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts erfüllte die Orgel liturgische Zwecke, wurde aber nicht zur Begleitung des Gemeindegesangs eingesetzt. Im Rahmen der Alternatimpraxis übernahm sie im Wechsel mit dem Chor, der Gemeinde oder einzelnen Sängern einzelne Teile der Messe und der kirchlichen Tageszeiten. Die Orgeln der Renaissance waren stark am zeitgenössischen Consortstil orientiert, in dem Flöten, Trompeten, Streichinstrumente und verschiedene Holzblasinstrumente imitiert wurden und die Orgel auf diese Weise das gesamte Orchester der damaligen Zeit abbildete. Entsprechend waren die gemischten Stimmen vergleichsweise milde konzipiert. Die Orgel wurde solistisch verwendet (für Kompositionen, Improvisationen und Intabulierungen) und zum Ensemblespiel eingesetzt, entweder als Continuoinstrument oder dass sie selbst die verschiedenen Instrumente nachahmte.', 'Barock.', 'Bedeutende Orgelbauer und ihre Werke.', 'Die politisch-wirtschaftliche und kulturell-kirchliche Blütezeit Sachsens im Zeitalter der Renaissance und des Barock brachte überregional bedeutende Orgelbauer hervor. Der Prospekt der sogenannten Sonnenorgel in der Görlitzer Peterskirche von Eugenio Casparini ist ein Unikum. Casparini wanderte mit 17 Jahren nach Italien aus und kehrte 1697 mit 74 Jahren in seine Heimat zurück. Zusammen mit seinem Sohn Adam Horatio vollendete er nach sechs Jahren Bauzeit die Orgel im Jahr 1703 und ließ dabei seine reichen Erfahrungen einfließen. Der Görlitzer Bildhauer Johann Conrad Buchau besetzte den 14,40 Meter hohen und 10,30 Meter breiten Prospekt mit 17 Pfeifenkränzen, die wie Strahlen aus den vergoldeten Sonnengesichtern ausgehen. Zwölf dieser Sonnen haben je zwölf klingende Pfeifen und gehören zu einer zwölffachen Pedalmixtur. Außer der Unda maris ist kein weiteres Register von Casparini erhalten.', 'Christoph Donat war Stammvater einer weitverzweigten Orgelbauerfamilie, die zwischen 1625 und 1842 mit Werkstätten in Leipzig, Zwickau, Altenburg und Glauchau nachweisbar ist. Von den Donatis sind einige Werke erhalten, so die in Brandis (1705) und Schlunzig (1724), die zu den ältesten Barockorgeln Sachsens gehören, sowie in Schirgiswalde (1724, Zuschreibung), Beierfeld (1728), Weltewitz (1772), Wettelswalde (1793) und Böhlen (1794), die meisten sind nur einmanualig. Drei Söhne von Tobias Dressel, Orgelbauer im erzgebirgischen Falkenstein/Vogtl. und Buchholz erlernten ebenfalls den väterlichen Beruf. Zacharias Hildebrandt war neben Silbermann der bedeutendste mitteldeutsche Orgelbauer des Barock. Der Schüler Silbermanns trat ab den 1720er Jahren in Konkurrenz zu seinem Lehrmeister und entwickelte eine große Eigenständigkeit. Spätestens 1746 kam es zu einer Aussöhnung, als Silbermann zusammen mit Johann Sebastian Bach die Hildebrandt-Orgel in der Naumburger Stadtkirche St. Wenzel (heute Sachsen-Anhalt) überprüfte und abnahm. Das Werk gehört „zu den bedeutendsten Schöpfungen auf dem Gebiet des spätbarocken Orgelbaus“. Sein Meisterstück steht in Langhennersdorf. Bei seiner Prüfung der Hildebrandt-Orgel in Störmthal (1722–1723) hat Johann Sebastian Bach laut Bericht „vor tüchtig und beständig erkannt und gerühmet“. Als besonders hochwertig gilt die Fassung des Prospektes aus dem Jahr 1726 in Lengefeld, die ein „Kunstmaler Fritzsche“ aus Dresden ausführte. Für St. Jacobi in Sangerhausen schuf er 1728 ein weiteres Werk. Von dem Spätwerk in Goldbach (um 1756) sind nur einige Register erhalten.', 'Eine Besonderheit stellt das zweimanualige Orgelpositiv (um 1730) eines unbekannten Meisters in der Kapelle von Burg Schönfels dar, für das ausschließlich Holzpfeifen Verwendung fanden.

Die Niger-Kongo-Sprachen grenzen im Nordwesten und äußersten Nordosten an afroasiatische, im zentralen und östlichen Sudangebiet an nilosaharanische Sprachen. Im Südwesten bilden die Khoisan-Sprachen eine Enklave im Niger-Kongo-Gebiet. Die bedeutendste Untergruppe des Niger-Kongo sind die Bantusprachen, die im südlichen Teil des Niger-Kongo-Gebietes von Ostnigeria bis Südafrika gesprochen werden (siehe Karte).

Die Erkenntnis, dass die Bantu-Sprachen mit den westsudanischen Sprachen genetisch verwandt sind, setzte sich erst durch Greenbergs Arbeiten (seit 1949) durch, allerdings kam auch Diedrich Westermann etwa gleichzeitig zu einer ähnlichen Ansicht. Greenberg klassifizierte die Bantusprachen als eine Unter-Unter-Einheit des Niger-Kongo, was 1950 revolutionär wirkte, heute aber allgemein als zutreffend akzeptiert wird.', 'Zur Statistik.', 'Mit 1.400 Sprachen, die sich in viele tausend Dialekte gliedern, bildet Niger-Kongo die sprachenreichste Sprachfamilie der Welt, gefolgt vom Austronesischen mit 1.100 und dem Transneuguinea-Phylum mit 550 Sprachen. Nach der Zahl seiner Sprecher (370–400 Millionen) nimmt das Niger-Kongo – allerdings mit großem Abstand – den dritten Rang nach dem Indogermanischen (2,7 Mrd.) und dem Sinotibetischen (1,3 Mrd.) ein.', 'Etwa 45 % der Bevölkerung Afrikas (925 Mio., siehe Artikel Afrika) sprechen eine Niger-Kongo-Sprache, 70 % aller etwa 2.000 afrikanischen Sprachen gehören zur Niger-Kongo-Gruppe, weltweit macht sie fast ein Viertel aller Sprachen aus. Die größte homogene Untergruppe des Niger-Kongo sind die Bantusprachen mit 500 eng verwandten Sprachen und 210 Mio. Sprechern. Die durchschnittliche Sprecherzahl der Niger-Kongo-Sprachen beträgt nur knapp 300.000, die Familie weist also eine relativ hohe Diversität auf.', 'Bedeutende Niger-Kongo-Sprachen.', 'Es gibt etwas über 20 Niger-Kongo-Sprachen mit mindestens fünf Millionen Sprechern, davon sind die Mehrzahl Bantusprachen. Viele dieser „großen“ afrikanischen Sprachen sind sogenannte Verkehrssprachen, die nicht nur muttersprachlich (als Erstsprache) erlernt, sondern von vielen Sprechern als Zweit- oder Drittsprache erworben werden, um eine Kommunikation in einem größeren Gebiet über die engen Sprachgrenzen einzelner Volksgruppen und Stämme hinweg zu ermöglichen. Bei manchen Sprachen ist der Anteil der Zweitsprecher größer als der der Erstsprecher (z. B. Swahili).', 'Die Niger-Kongo-Sprache mit den meisten Sprechern ist das Swahili, das als Verkehrssprache von mehr als 80 Mio. Menschen in Ostafrika gesprochen wird. Der Größe nach folgt das nigerianische Yoruba mit 20 bis 25 Mio. Sprechern, das zum Benue-Kongo gerechnet wird. Fulfulde oder Ful(ani) ist ein großes Dialektcluster der atlantischen Gruppe im westlichen Afrika mit über 20 Mio. Sprechern. Igbo wird von fast 20 Mio.

Es fehlte allein schon die Forschungskapazität, um dieses Projekt durchzuführen. Dieses Faktum wurde – und wird vereinzelt noch – als Argument der Gegner einer genetischen Einheit des Niger-Kongo benutzt. Es stellt sich also die Frage: Ist das Niger-Kongo eine \\"genetische Einheit\\", so dass die lexikalischen und grammatischen Gemeinsamkeiten auf eine gemeinsame Vorgängersprache zurückgehen, oder ist es nur eine Ansammlung von typologisch ähnlichen Sprachgruppen, die sich durch arealen Kontakt gegenseitig mehr oder weniger stark beeinflusst haben?', 'Die Antwort fällt seitens der Fachleute der Niger-Kongo-Forschung heute eindeutig aus: die Gemeinsamkeiten in Grammatik und Wortschatz lassen sich nur durch eine genetische Verwandtschaft erklären. Dabei sind drei Merkmale von besonderer Bedeutung:', 'Nominalklassensystem.', 'Struktur und Funktion.', 'Die Niger-Kongo-Sprachen besitzen in vielen Zweigen ein ausgeprägtes Nominalklassensystem, das die Zugehörigkeit aller (oder der meisten) Substantive einer Sprache zu einer Klasse festlegt. Diese Klassen treten für zählbare Nomina in der Regel als Singular-Plural-Paare auf, für Massenbezeichnungen, Flüssigkeiten und Abstrakta als Einzelklassen. Die Markierung (Kennzeichnung) der Klasse erfolgt durch Affixe am Nomen – die \\"Klassenaffixe\\" –, meist durch Präfixe, manchmal durch Suffixe und sehr selten durch Infixe. Die Klassenzugehörigkeit des Nomens übt häufig einen Konkordanzzwang auf untergeordnete Komponenten der Nominalphrase (Genitivattribut, Adjektivattribut, Numerale, Possessiva, Demonstrativa) und/oder auf das Prädikat des Satzes aus, das das Nomen zum Subjekt hat. Oft dienen spezifische Affixe an den Attributen und dem Verb dazu, diese Konkordanz zu markieren, manchmal sind die Konkordanzaffixe sogar identisch mit den Klassenaffixen des Nomens.', 'Am deutlichsten ist das Nominalklassensystem in den Bantusprachen ausgeprägt, in anderen Zweigen des Niger-Kongo wurde es umgeformt oder reduziert, teilweise ist das System auch ganz verloren gegangen, z. B. bei den Mande-Sprachen. Für diese Zweige müssen dann andere Kriterien für die genetische Zugehörigkeit zum Niger-Kongo herangezogen werden.', 'Nominalklassen in den Bantusprachen.', 'Zur Verdeutlichung der Begriffe \\"Nominalklassen, Klassenpräfixe\\" und \\"Konkordanz\\" werden im Folgenden einige Beispiele aus den Bantusprachen angeführt, in denen diese Phänomene am klarsten erkennbar sind. Es gab im Proto-Bantu etwa zwanzig Nominalklassen. Diese Anzahl hat sich bei einigen der heutigen Bantusprachen erhalten (z. B. im Ganda), in anderen wurde sie bis auf etwa zehn Klassen reduziert. Die Nominalklassen werden im Bantu ausschließlich durch Präfixe markiert. Es herrscht Konkordanz des Nomens mit seinen Ergänzungen in der Nominalphrase und zwischen Subjektnomen und Verb im Satz, allerdings können die Konkordanzpräfixe \\"einer\\" Klasse bei Nomen, Numerale, Pronomen und Verb unterschiedlich sein.', '\\"Nominalklassen im Ganda\\"', 'Weitere Beispiele aus dem Swahili zeigen die weitverbreitete Dopplung in Singular- und Pluralklasse.', '\\"Singular – Plural – Klassenpaare im Swahili\\"', 'Konkordanz in den Bantusprachen.', 'Zur Demonstration von Nominalklassen und Konkordanzverhalten folgen einige weitere Beispiele aus dem Swahili.', 'Konkordanz in der Nominalphrase', 'Bei Verwendung von Adjektiven, Zahlwörtern und Demonstrativpronomen ergibt sich im Swahili folgende Reihenfolge in einer Nominalphrase: \\"Nomen + Adjektiv + Zahlwort + Demonstrativum\\".

Die mathematisch begabte Forscherin Nightingale gilt außerdem als Pionierin der visuellen Veranschaulichung von Zusammenhängen in der Statistik.', 'Nightingale vertrat die Ansicht, dass es neben dem ärztlichen Wissen ein eigenständiges pflegerisches Wissen geben sollte, und vertrat diese auch in ihren Schriften zur Krankenpflege, die als Gründungsschriften der Pflegetheorie gelten. Unter anderem beschäftigte sie sich darin mit den Auswirkungen der Umgebung auf die Gesundheit. Ihr als Nightingalesches System bezeichnetes Ausbildungsmodell sah eine Ausbildung von Berufsanfängern vor allem durch erfahrene Pflegekräfte vor.', 'Während des Krimkrieges (1853–1856) leitete sie eine Gruppe von Pflegerinnen, die verwundete und erkrankte britische Soldaten im Militärkrankenhaus im türkischen Scutari (dem heutigen Istanbuler Stadtteil Üsküdar) betreute. Da sie nachts auf ihren Kontrollgängen die Patienten mit einer Lampe in der Hand besuchte, ging Nightingale als \\"Lady with the Lamp\\" („Dame mit der Lampe“) in die britische Folklore ein.', 'Tatsächlich war Nightingale an der direkten Pflege von Verletzten und Erkrankten kaum beteiligt. Ihre Leistung in Scutari bestand in der Schaffung und Aufrechterhaltung eines rudimentären Krankenhausbetriebes. Aus dem Krimkrieg kehrte Nightingale chronisch krank nach Großbritannien zurück und führte als Invalide von da an ein zurückgezogenes Leben. Durch ihre zahlreichen Veröffentlichungen und Korrespondenzen nahm sie dennoch Einfluss auf mehrere Gesundheitsreformen.', 'Bedeutung von Nightingales Wirken.', 'Für die heutige Pflege.', 'Das 19. Jahrhundert wird auch als das „Jahrhundert der Medizin“ bezeichnet. Durch die Fortschritte in Diagnostik und Therapie wandelten sich die „Siechenhäuser“ in Krankenhäuser im heutigen Sinne. Heilungssuchende begannen, gezielt Krankenhäuser aufzusuchen, um sich behandeln zu lassen. Entsprechend wurde nun ausgebildetes Pflegepersonal – anstelle von Krankenwärtern – benötigt, das die Ärzte in der Therapie unterstützen konnte und mit den Patienten angenehmere Umgangsformen pflegte.', 'Während sich in anderen europäischen Ländern, insbesondere in Frankreich und Deutschland, katholische Orden die Ausbildung von Pflegern zur Aufgabe machten, geschah in Großbritannien wenig. Die wenigsten Klöster und Orden hatten die englische Reformation überlebt. Dieser Umstand wurde der britischen Öffentlichkeit durch Veröffentlichungen von Nightingale schmerzlich bewusst. Die Ausbildung von Pflegepersonal wurde daraufhin als nationale Aufgabe gesehen, für die Spendengelder gesammelt wurden.', 'Die von Nightingale gegründete Pflegeschule \\"Nightingale School of Nursing\\" am St Thomas’ Hospital in London wurde zur Keimzelle dieser Professionalisierung. Krankenhäuser aus allen britischen Regionen forderten in der Folgezeit Absolventen an, die das Pflegesystem an der eigenen Einrichtung reformieren und eine Ausbildung einführen sollten. Durch eine Art Schneeballsystem breitete sich so das \\"Nightingale Nursing\\" über den gesamten Commonwealth aus. Der Pflegeberuf in angelsächsischen Ländern ist heute anspruchsvoller in der Ausbildung – z. T. auf Hochschulniveau – und weist der \\"Nurse\\" weit mehr Kompetenzen zu als z. B. dem Gesundheits- und Krankenpfleger in Deutschland.', 'Im Gegensatz dazu lassen sich die Spuren der Ordenspflege bei uns auch heute noch erkennen: Anrede als „Schwester“ und Nächstenliebe als wesentliche Motivation. Nightingale trug in Großbritannien und den zum Empire gehörenden Ländern wesentlich dazu bei, dass sich die Krankenpflege zu einem gesellschaftlich geachteten und anerkannten Berufsweg für Frauen entwickelte, und legte Ausbildungsstandards fest, die zuerst in der von ihr gegründeten Krankenpflegeschule angewandt wurden.', 'Mit ihrem Satz „Ärzte beschäftigen sich mit Krankheiten, Krankenschwestern beschäftigen sich mit Menschen“ soll sie den Grundstein für eine Philosophie der Krankenpflege gelegt haben.', 'Für die Pflegewissenschaft und Statistik.', 'Nightingale gilt als Erfinderin des Polar-Area-Diagramms, eines Kreisdiagramms mit unterschiedlichen Radiuslängen, das sie vor allem zur Darstellung zyklischer Vorgänge nutzte. Außerdem propagierte sie in ihren \\"Notes on Nursing\\" sozialwissenschaftliche Feldexperimente.', 'Ein Großteil ihrer Arbeit bestand in der Informationserfassung und -verarbeitung als Managementaufgabe. So entwickelte sie Fragebögen, die in Kliniken verteilt wurden, um Missstände zu erkennen und nachweislich abzustellen.

Nightingales ältere Schwester Parthenope wurde 1819 in Neapel geboren und nach der griechischen Bezeichnung ihrer Geburtsstadt benannt. Florence Nightingales Geburtshaus war die Villa Colombaia in Florenz. Wie bei der älteren Tochter wählte das Ehepaar Nightingale einen Vornamen in Anlehnung an den Geburtsort aus. Die Familie kehrte im Winter 1820 nach Großbritannien zurück und ließ sich zunächst in Lea Hurst in der Grafschaft Derbyshire nieder. Fanny Nightingale empfand die dortigen Winter jedoch als zu streng und die Möglichkeiten, am gesellschaftlichen Leben teilzunehmen, als zu eingeschränkt. 1825 erwarb William Nightingale zusätzlich den Landsitz Embley Park in Hampshire, der zum Hauptwohnsitz der Familie wurde.', 'Aus Nightingales Kindheit sind mehrere Briefe an Familienmitglieder erhalten, die nach Ansicht des Biografen Mark Bostridge sehr früh eine große sprachliche Begabung und Beobachtungsgabe zeigen. Bereits mit neun Jahren sprach sie so gut Französisch, dass sie für ihre Mutter eine Predigt in dieser Sprache zusammenfassen konnte. Ab 1831 übernahm der in Cambridge gebildete Vater einen großen Teil der Erziehung seiner Töchter. Er unterrichtete sie in Latein, Griechisch, Deutsch, Französisch und Italienisch sowie in Mathematik, Geschichte und Philosophie. Die zusätzlich engagierte Hauslehrerin war für den Unterricht in Zeichnen und Musik zuständig.', 'Fanny und William Nightingale waren Anhänger des Unitarismus, einer liberalen und dogmenfreien christlichen Glaubensrichtung, die unter anderem die Lehre der Dreifaltigkeit Gottes ablehnte. Auch wenn Bostridge den im Verlauf ihres Lebens zunehmend heterodoxer werdenden Glauben Nightingales betont, waren einzelne Elemente des unitaristischen Ethos für sie prägend: der Glaube an sozialen Fortschritt und an eine moralische Verpflichtung gegenüber der Gesellschaft sowie die große Bedeutung, die dem Dienst an der Gemeinschaft beigemessen wurde. Briefe aus den 1830er-Jahren belegen, dass die Familie Nightingale in dieser Zeit für die Dorfbewohner in der Nähe von Lea Hurst medizinische Versorgung organisierte und bezahlte. Nightingale sammelte ihre ersten Erfahrungen in der Krankenpflege zwar durch die Pflege kranker Familienmitglieder, begleitete aber bereits in sehr jungem Alter ihre Mutter und ihre Gouvernante bei Krankenbesuchen in den umliegenden Dörfern. Tagebucheinträge der erst zehnjährigen Nightingale über den Selbstmord einer jungen Mutter weisen darauf hin, dass sie dadurch sehr früh einen Eindruck der Lebensbedingungen der Armen erhielt.', '1837 bis 1844: Entscheidung für die Krankenpflege.', 'Im Januar 1837 suchte eine Grippe-Epidemie den Süden Englands heim.

In diese Zeit fällt auch ein religiöses Erweckungserlebnis, das für sie so prägend war, dass die Jahrestage für sie zeitlebens ein besonderes Ereignis blieben. Am 7. Februar 1837 schrieb Nightingale in ihr Tagebuch: „Gott sprach zu mir und rief mich in seinen Dienst.“ Welcher Art dieser Dienst sei, sagte die Stimme nicht.

Sa mère était gravement malade, et il avait perdu son emploi, ce qui avait ajouté à son stress et à sa peur. Un jour, alors qu'il se promenait près de la rivière pour tenter de trouver un peu de paix, il rencontra un homme plus âgé qui semblait émaner une tranquillité inébranlable. Curieux, Thomas aborda l'homme et lui demanda comment il parvenait à rester si calme alors que le monde autour de lui semblait s'effondrer. L'homme sourit et lui raconta qu'il était également passé par de nombreux moments difficiles dans sa vie. Cependant, il avait appris à avoir confiance en Dieu et à s'en remettre à Lui, même dans les situations les plus sombres. Intrigué, Thomas demanda à l'homme de lui enseigner comment il pouvait lui aussi trouver cette confiance en Dieu. L'homme hocha la tête et accepta de partager avec Thomas les enseignements qui l'avaient aidé à traverser les épreuves de la vie. C'est ainsi que commença le voyage de Thomas vers une relation plus profonde avec Dieu et une confiance renouvelée en Sa présence et Ses promesses, même dans les moments difficiles."},{"instruction":"ecrit le chapitre 1","output":"Chapitre 1: L'épreuve de la foi Thomas était tout ouïe alors que l'homme plus âgé commençait à partager les leçons qu'il avait apprises au cours de sa vie. La première leçon, expliqua-t-il, concernait l'épreuve de la foi. Dans la vie, nous traversons tous des moments difficiles, des moments où notre foi en Dieu est mise à l'épreuve. Ces épreuves peuvent parfois nous sembler insurmontables, mais elles sont en réalité des occasions de grandir et de renforcer notre foi. L'homme raconta à Thomas l'histoire de Job, un homme riche et pieux dont la foi a été mise à l'épreuve de manière dévastatrice. Job a tout perdu - ses biens, ses enfants et sa santé - et pourtant, il n'a jamais cessé de croire en Dieu. Lorsque ses amis ont essayé de le convaincre que ses souffrances étaient de sa faute, Job s'est tourné vers Dieu et a cherché des réponses. En fin de compte, sa foi a été récompensée et son sort a été restauré. L'homme expliqua que les épreuves de la foi servent à nous rapprocher de Dieu. Elles nous enseignent à nous appuyer sur Lui et à chercher Sa guidance. Quand tout va bien, il est facile de croire en Dieu, mais c'est dans les moments difficiles que notre foi est véritablement testée. Thomas réfléchit aux paroles du vieil homme et se rappela les moments difficiles qu'il avait traversés - comment il avait souvent douté de Dieu et de Son amour pour lui. Mais à présent, Thomas pouvait voir que ces moments étaient en réalité des occasions pour lui de grandir et d'apprendre à faire confiance à Dieu. L'homme suggéra à Thomas de prendre un moment chaque jour pour réfléchir à ses épreuves et pour se rappeler que Dieu est toujours présent, même dans les moments les plus difficiles. Il l'encouragea à lire les Écritures et à chercher les promesses de Dieu concernant Sa présence et Son soutien indéfectible. Thomas remercia l'homme pour cette première leçon et se promit de mettre en pratique ses conseils. Il sentait déjà un peu de paix s'installer en lui, bien que sa situation n'ait pas encore changé. Mais avec cette nouvelle perspective sur les épreuves de la vie, Thomas était déterminé à renforcer sa foi et à apprendre à faire confiance en Dieu, même dans les moments difficiles. Alors que le soleil commençait à se coucher, l'homme et Thomas continuèrent à discuter ensemble au bord de la rivière. L'homme sourit et dit : \\"Demain, je te parlerai des promesses divines pour nous soutenir dans notre vie.\\" Thomas hocha la tête, le cœur rempli de gratitude pour cette nouvelle amitié et pour les leçons de vie qu'il était en train d'apprendre."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Geschichte Israels', 'Handschrift des Alten Testaments', 'Handschrift des Israel-Museums (Jerusalem)', 'Handschrift des Rockefeller Museum (Jerusalem)', 'Schriftrollen vom Toten Meer'], 'Die Schriftrollen vom Toten Meer () oder Qumran-Handschriften sind eine Gruppe von antiken jüdischen Texten, die elf Höhlen nahe der archäologischen Stätte Khirbet Qumran im Westjordanland zugeordnet werden. Von 1947 bis 1956 wurden die Höhlen entdeckt, meist von Beduinen. Die Handschriften wurden teils aus dem Antikenhandel erworben, teils bei der archäologischen Untersuchung der Höhlen gefunden. Etwa 15 Buchrollen sind noch als solche erkennbar. Der Rest, geschätzt 900 bis 1000 Rollen, ist in mehr als 15.000 Fragmente zerfallen. Die Handschriften werden aufgrund der Buchstabenformen (paläografisch) in die Zeit vom 3. Jahrhundert v. Chr. bis ins 1. Jahrhundert n. Chr. datiert. Mit der Radiokarbonmethode wurde diese Datierung in einigen Fällen überprüft und bestätigt. Die meisten Texte sind in hebräischer Sprache verfasst; fast alle sind literarisch und haben einen religiösen Inhalt. Alltagstexte wie zum Beispiel Briefe gibt es kaum. Der literarische Charakter unterscheidet die Qumranhandschriften von anderen antiken Textfunden in der Region (mit Ausnahme von Masada) und lässt sie, trotz der Vielfalt des Inhalts, für viele Fachleute als zusammengehörig erscheinen.', 'Für die Textgeschichte der Hebräischen Bibel (des jüdischen Tanach bzw. des christlichen Alten Testaments) sind die Schriftrollen vom Toten Meer von herausragender Bedeutung. Der später im Judentum kanonisch gewordene Masoretische Text steht einem Typ von Qumranhandschriften sehr nahe, was das Alter und die Qualität der jüdischen Schreibertradition unterstreicht. Dieser proto-masoretische Text hat aber kein Monopol. Es gibt unter den biblischen Qumranhandschriften ein gleichwertiges Nebeneinander verschiedener Texttypen.', 'Das hellenistische und frührömische Judäa war bis zu den Qumranfunden fast nur durch Schriften bekannt, die in einem jahrhundertelangen, meist christlich gesteuerten Auswahlprozess überliefert worden waren. Die Qumranhandschriften dagegen enthalten ein von mittelalterlichen Kopisten unzensiertes Spektrum antiker jüdischer Literatur. Im Mittelpunkt steht die Tora: Manche Qumranschriften rücken eine Haupt- oder Nebenfigur der Tora ins Zentrum. Es gibt freie Nacherzählungen von Tora-Stoffen. Andere Autoren brachten die Rechtstexte der Tora in eine neue Reihenfolge und entwickelten sie weiter.', 'Im Qumranschrifttum hebt sich eine Gruppe von Texten heraus, die in einer jüdischen Gemeinschaft mit besonderer Prägung verfasst worden waren. Diese Gemeinschaft nannte sich selbst Jachad und wird in der Forschung oft mit den Essenern identifiziert. Mitglieder des Jachad befolgten die Gebote der Tora mit großer Radikalität und darüber hinaus eigene Gebote, von denen man außerhalb des Jachad nichts wusste. Der Jachad lehnte den Jerusalemer Tempel ab und glaubte, dass die Liturgie in der eigenen Gruppe den Jerusalemer Opferkult ersetzen könne. Viele Verfasser waren überzeugt, in der Endzeit zu leben. Das war kompatibel mit einem Interesse an Weisheitsliteratur, die im Spektrum der Qumranschriften gut vertreten ist. Was unter den erhaltenen außerbiblischen Schriftrollen vom Toten Meer dagegen fehlt, sind historische Werke.', 'Personen des Urchristentums werden in den durchschnittlich 100 Jahre älteren Qumrantexten nicht genannt. Für die Judaistik eröffnen die Handschriften vom Toten Meer neue Einsichten in die Entwicklung der Halacha.', 'Fundorte antiker Texte am Westufer des Toten Meeres.', 'Neben den Höhlen bei Khirbet Qumram wurden auch an anderen archäologischen Stätten am Westufer des Toten Meeres und im unteren Jordantal antike und frühmittelalterliche Texte gefunden, die in einem weiteren Sinne als „Schriftrollen vom Toten Meer“ bezeichnet werden können:', 'Es ist im Einzelfall möglich, dass bei den im Antikenhandel erworbenen Fragmenten eine Herkunft aus Qumran behauptet wurde, diese Texte aber von einem anderen regionalen Fundort stammen. Seit 2017 führt die Israelische Altertümerverwaltung zusammen mit der Abteilung Archäologie der Zivilverwaltung von Judäa und Samaria Rettungsgrabungen im Bereich der oben genannten Fundorte durch, um Plünderern zuvorzukommen. Im März 2021 wurden dabei erstmals nach etwa 60 Jahren wieder Textfunde gemeldet, und zwar neue Fragmente der griechischen Zwölfprophetenrolle vom Nachal Chever mit dem Text von und. Diese Buchrolle war bereits durch Fragmente bekannt, die in den 1950er Jahren im Antikenhandel auftauchten, und dann durch die archäologische Untersuchung der sogenannten \\"Cave of Horror\\" unter Leitung von Yohanan Aharoni 1961.', 'Essener – Qumran – Jachad.', 'Zu der Frage, wer die Schriftrollen in den Höhlen gesammelt hat, gibt es eine klassische Theorie, der von einer Minderheit widersprochen wird und die seitdem in verschiedener Weise modifiziert wurde: Die \\"Qumran-Essener-Theorie\\" besagt, dass die Essener in Khirbet Qumran ihr Zentrum hatten und hier eine Bibliothek besaßen, deren Reste die Schriftrollen vom Toten Meer darstellen. Die Essener werden von den antiken Autoren Flavius Josephus, Philon von Alexandria und Plinius der Ältere als jüdische Philosophenschule oder als zölibatär lebender „Stamm“ beschrieben. Buchbesitz ist in der Antike ein klares Oberschichtmerkmal. Die Architektur von Khirbet Qumran weist aber nicht den Luxus auf, den man bei Eigentümern einer großen Bibliothek erwartet. Genau das zeigt im Sinne der Qumran-Essener-Hypothese einen freiwillig gewählten asketischen Lebensstil.', 'Der Ausgräber Roland de Vaux war überzeugt, in Khirbet Qumran eine Schreiberwerkstatt identifiziert zu haben (sogenanntes Skriptorium in L30). Daraus folgt auch für Vertreter seiner Hypothese nicht, dass alle Schriftrollen aus den Höhlen hier angefertigt wurden. Einige Rollen sind dafür zu alt. Aber Khirbet Qumran ist nach dieser Theorie der Ort, wo die Rollen studiert wurden und wo das praktiziert wurde, was insbesondere die Gemeinderegel (1QS) vorschreibt.', 'Innerhalb der Anlage von Khirbet Qumran ist kein Raum oder Trakt klar als Bibliothek zu erkennen. Diskutiert wird diese Nutzung bei dem mit einer Art umlaufender flacher Bank ausgestatteten Raum L4 und dem dahinter befindlichen, nur durch L4 zu betretenden Raum L1 (Foto). Eine Durchreiche verbindet beide Räume. Die Bank könnte eine Basis für die hölzernen Regale gewesen sein, auf denen die Buchrollen lagen. Katharine Greenleaf Pedley identifizierte L4 und L1 als Bibliothek mit Leseraum und einem Arbeitsraum im nicht erhaltenen Obergeschoss. Hartmut Stegemann hält L1 für die eigentliche Bibliothek und L4 für den Leseraum. In L4 war es freilich dunkel. Stegemann sieht dies als Vorteil, denn es schützte die Buchrollen vor dem Ausbleichen. Man habe sie beim Licht von Öllampen studiert. Ihre kostbaren Buchrollen verbargen die Essener nach dieser Theorie im Jüdischen Krieg (vor 68 n. Chr.) in der nahegelegenen Höhle 4Q, um sie vor der römischen Armee in Sicherheit zu bringen. Einige wichtige Buchrollen nahm man möglicherweise aus diesem Versteck heraus und lagerte sie in Höhle 1Q.', 'Die Aufbewahrung beschädigter heiliger Texte in einem Depot (Geniza) ist eine seit dem Mittelalter für das Judentum bezeugte Praxis. Eleasar Sukenik vermutete, dass sie schon in der Antike von Essenern befolgt worden sei. Wenn man die Qumranhöhlen als Genizot versteht, spricht das für eine allmähliche Ansammlung von Schriftrollen über einen langen Zeitraum. Eine Geniza kann auch religiöse Texte enthalten, die inhaltlich missbilligt und deshalb aus dem Verkehr gezogen wurden. Nachdem Sukenik 1953 verstorben war, wurde die Geniza-Theorie von Autoren vertreten, die diesen Aspekt stark betonten (Henri del Medico, Godfrey R. Driver). Die Mehrheitsmeinung folgte aber de Vaux, zumal mit Józef T. Milik (\\"Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judaea\\", 1959) und Frank M. Cross (\\"The Ancient Library of Qumran and Modern Biblical Studies\\", 1961) zwei Mitglieder seines Editionsteams die Vorstellung einer einheitlichen, aus Khirbet Qumran ausgelagerten antiken Bibliothek unterstützten.', 'Die Qumran-Essener-Theorie war fast konsensual akzeptiert, bis Norman Golb 1980 widersprach. Dass Khirbet Qumran ein Zentrum essenischer Schreibertätigkeit gewesen sei, sei ebenso unbewiesen wie ein Zusammenhang zwischen der Siedlung und den Höhlen. Die Texte zeigten die Vielfalt religiöser Praktiken und Überzeugungen innerhalb des damaligen Judentums; die Buchrollen seien vor oder während der römischen Belagerung aus Jerusalem herausgebracht und mit Hilfe der ortskundigen Bevölkerung in Höhlen westlich des Toten Meeres versteckt worden. Zu der Minderheit, die eine Jerusalemer Herkunft der Texte favorisiert, gehören außer Golb vor allem Yizhar Hirschfeld, Jürgen Zangenberg und die Leiter der Nachgrabungen in Khirbet Qumran (1993 bis 2004), Yizhak Magen und Yuval Peleg. Rachel Elior hält die Essener für eine literarische Fiktion antiker Autoren und weist die Qumran-Handschriften zadokidischen Priesterkreisen zu, die durch die Hasmonäer in Jerusalem entmachtet wurden und aus der Opposition heraus Literatur zu Fragen des Tempelkults, des Kalenders und der kultischen Reinheit verfassten.', 'Autoren, die an der Qumran-Essener-Theorie grundsätzlich festhalten, vertreten sie oft in modifizierter Form. Beispiele:', 'Es ist methodisch sinnvoll, die Rollen zunächst für sich zu betrachten, unabhängig von den archäologischen Befunden aus Khirbet Qumran und den antiken Texten über die Essener. Die jüdische Gruppe, deren besondere Anschauungen in einigen Qumranrollen niedergelegt sind, bezeichnete sich selbst als \\"Jachad\\" („Einung“), ein Sprachgebrauch, der in der Fachliteratur übernommen wird; Texte, die ihre besonderen Anschauungen enthalten, sind daher \\"jachadische\\" Texte. (Der Ausdruck \\"jachadisch\\" wird im Folgenden auch dort verwendet, wo in der englischsprachigen Literatur \\"sectarian\\" steht, da „Sekte“ im Deutschen stark abwertend ist.)', 'Entdeckung und Publikation.', 'Die großen Rollen aus Höhle 1Q.', 'Am 9. August 1949 erschien in der Londoner Times eine von Gerald Lankester Harding, dem Direktor der jordanischen Altertümerbehörde, verfasste Auffindungsgeschichte: Auf der Suche nach einer Ziege fand ein junger Taʿâmireh-Beduine im Frühsommer 1947 den Eingang einer Höhle, warf einen Stein in die Tiefe und hörte Keramik zerbrechen. Er stieg mit seinem Freund in die Höhle ein. In Krügen fanden die beiden Beduinen acht Schriftrollen, teilten sie und verkauften sie Händlern in Bethlehem. 1955 nannte Harding die Namen der beiden Hirten: Mohammed edh Dhib und Ahmed Mohammed.
