Observe that:    [    x_{n+1} = frac{x_n^2}{x_n^2 - x_n + 1}    ] 3. We can rewrite the recurrence relation in a different form. Notice that:    [    x_{n+1} - 1 = frac{x_n^2 - (x_n^2 - x_n + 1)}{x_n^2 - x_n + 1} = frac{x_n - 1}{x_n^2 - x_n + 1}    ] 4.

Since one of these subsets is the empty set, the number of non-empty subsets is:    [    2^n - 1    ]    For n = 8, this becomes:    [    2^8 - 1 = 256 - 1 = 255    ] 2. **Counting subsets that include element k with k elements:**    We need to count how many non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ldots, n} have k elements and contain any specific element k.

The value of cos(pi + alpha) = -frac{1}{2} corresponds to the angles where the terminal side of the angle lies in either the second or third quadrants. Given that alpha is constrained between frac{3pi}{2} and 2pi, we know it must be in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, the reference angle for alpha in the fourth quadrant that would result in a cosine value of -frac{1}{2} is frac{pi}{3}.

The sine of frac{pi}{3} is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, but since the original angle 3pi - alpha is in the fourth quadrant where sine values are negative, we take the negative of this value.

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the sum of four positive numbers:    [    (a + b + c + d)^2 leq (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2).    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    m^2 leq 4 cdot 1989 = 7956.    ]    Taking the square root on both sides:    [    m leq sqrt{7956} approx 89.2.    ]    Since m is a positive integer:    [    m leq 89.    ] 3. a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 is an odd integer (since 1989 is odd), hence a + b + c + d must be odd.

Now consider m^2 = 81, thus m = 9. Assume d = n^2. Thus:    [    a + b + c + d = 81.    ] 9. We need d = n^2 in {25, 36}:    - If d = 25:      [      a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 25 = 1989 implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1964.      ]      Also:      [      a + b + c = 9^2 - 5^2 implies a + b + c = 56.      ] 10. No combination of perfect squares a, b, c (where each is less than 25^2) adds to 56 and squares add to 1964. 11. If d = 36:     [     a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 36^2 = 1989 implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1989 - 1296 = 693.     ]     Also:     [     a + b + c = 81 - 36 = 45.     ] 12.

We need to determine if it is possible to have 10 runners running in the same direction with constant speeds of 20, 21, ..., 29 km/h such that at least one runner is always in front of the stands. 1. **Define Parameters**:    Let the length of the track be (1 , text{km}) and the arc length of the stands be (100 , text{m} = 0.1 , text{km}). The velocities of the 10 runners are (v_i) where (i) ranges from 0 to 9, and (v_i = 20 + i , text{km/h}). 2. **Time Interval Calculation**:    Consider an interval (T) that is sufficient for each runner to complete an integer number of laps. Since the fastest runner's (with speed 29 km/h) periodicity repeats every (29 , text{hours}), we pick (T = 29!), the factorial of 29 hours, ensuring every runner completes an integer number of laps within this interval. 3. **Presence near stands**:    Since the arc covered by the stands is (frac{1}{10})th of a full lap, each runner spends (frac{1}{10}) of the time (T) in front of the stands. 4. **Time Calculation**:    Within the time (T):    - Total time spent by each runner in front of the stands is (frac{T}{10}).    - Since there are 10 runners, the combined time they spend is (10 times frac{T}{10} = T). Therefore, the total time spent by all runners near the stands adds up exactly to (T). 5. **Conflict in Requirements**:    For the runners to always be present at the stands, their intervals of presence with (T), must cover the interval seamlessly so that there is no moment without a runner in (Delta). 6. **Illustrating the Issue**:    Choose two runners A and B with velocities 20 km/h and 21 km/h respectively. Consider a point on the track where B overtakes A outside (Delta). Before reaching (Delta), both runners have to run at least (900 , text{m} = 0.9 , text{km}):    - ( A )'s time to cover (900 , text{m} approx frac{0.9}{20} = 0.045 , text{hours} )    - ( B )'s time to cover (900 , text{m} approx frac{0.9}{21} approx 0.04286 , text{hours} )     Since (B) can only get at most (45 , text{m}) ahead in this time relative to (A), they will both end up overlapping within (Delta), failing to ensure continuous presence independently without overlapping covering intervals. # Conclusion: Given that at some points, two runners can overlap within (Delta), defeating the requirement of non-overlapping continuous presence, the task of ensuring that at any moment there is at least one runner in front of the stands is impossible.

Applying this formula, we have: - For S_{5} > 0: frac{5}{2}(a_{1} + a_{5}) > 0 - For S_{6} < 0: frac{6}{2}(a_{1} + a_{6}) < 0 From these inequalities, we can deduce that: - a_{3} > 0 because the average of the first five terms is positive. - a_{3} + a_{4} < 0 because adding the next term (the sixth term) makes the average negative.

This means the relationship S_{n} + S_{3n} = 2S_{2n} does not hold, making option **C** incorrect. 5. **Determining when S_{n} reaches its maximum value:** Since a_{3} > 0 and a_{4} < 0, the sum S_{n} reaches its maximum value when n = 3, as adding any more terms (starting with a_{4}) will start decreasing the sum due to the negative terms.

Substituting these expanded forms back into the inequalities:    [    a^2 > b^2 - 2bc + c^2,    ]    [    b^2 > a^2 - 2ac + c^2,    ]    [    c^2 > a^2 - 2ab + b^2.    ] 5.

Analyze ( d(x) ): Since ( d(x) ) divides both ( P(x) ) and ( P^{prime}(x) ), it must divide any linear combination of these polynomials. Consider the polynomial's lowest degree term and the fact that these terms differ, as the original polynomial includes a constant term not present in the derivative ( P^{prime}(x) ).

A point (M) on the side (CD) is chosen so that the ratio (frac{CM}{MD} = frac{4}{3}). 3. The segment (BM) intersects the diagonal (AC) at point (N) in such a way that the ratio (frac{CN}{NA} = frac{4}{3}). 4. Hence, from the given conditions, we have (frac{CN}{NA} = frac{CM}{MD}). 5. According to the Converse of Thales' Theorem (or triangle similarity), if a line segment is divided into segments whose lengths are proportional to segments on another line, then the lines are parallel. 6. Thus, we suspect that the lines (MN) and (AD) are parallel. However, if (MN parallel AD), then (BC) and (MN) would also have to be parallel, which contradicts the fact that they intersect at point (B). 7. Therefore, we conclude that the segments are not parallel and, thus, the ratios hold true because of the other conditions of the problem: [ frac{NA}{NC} = frac{4}{3} ] 8. Next, let's extend the segment (BM) until it intersects the line (AD) at point (K). 9. By considering the triangles (BCN) and (KAN):     - Triangle (BCN) is similar to triangle (KAN) by AA (angle-angle similarity) criterion since they share the angles at (N) and the angles formed by (N) with line projections onto (BC) and (AD). 10. This similarity gives us the relation: [ frac{KA}{BC} = frac{NA}{NC} = frac{4}{3} ] 11. Now, by considering the triangles (BCM) and (KDM):     - Triangle (BCM) is similar to triangle (KDM) by AA criterion because they share two corresponding angles. 12. This similarity leads to the relation: [ frac{KD}{BC} = frac{MD}{MC} = frac{3}{4} ] 13. Finally, we can calculate the desired ratio (frac{AD}{BC}) using the segments (KA) and (KD): [ frac{AD}{BC} = frac{KA - KD}{BC} ] 14. Substituting the ratios of (KA) and (KD) we get: [ frac{AD}{BC} = frac{frac{4}{3}BC - frac{3}{4}BC}{BC} = frac{frac{4}{3} - frac{3}{4}}{1}  ] 15. Simplifying the expression: [ frac{AD}{BC} = frac{frac{16}{12} - frac{9}{12}}{1} = frac{frac{16-9}{12}}{1} = frac{7}{12} ] 16.

The orthocenter M is reflected over each side of the triangle and each reflection lies on the circumcircle of ABC.    - Start by reflecting the circumcircle k of triangle ABC over the line segment BC. This can be done by drawing circles centered at B and C with radius equal to the circumradius R of k. Label the intersections of these circles as P and P’. One of these intersections will be the reflection of the center of the circumcircle over BC. 2. **Locating Point M:**    - Now we know the distance MC, the distance from the orthocenter M to vertex C. Draw a circle centered at C with radius MC. The intersections of this circle with the reflected circumcircle k' will give us point M (the orthocenter). 3. **Reflecting Again:**    - Reflect point M and point C with respect to the line containing MC. Draw a circle centered at M with radius MC, locating point C'. 4. **Finding Point A:**    - Finally, reflect the circle k across the line MC. This reflected circle will intersect the original circumcircle k at point A. 5. **Construct Triangle ABC:**    - Using the intersections derived above, construct point A. The coordinates of A will be determined by the intersection of the reflected circle and the circumcircle.  Verification: We ensure that:    - M is indeed the orthocenter by definition (intersection of altitudes).    - triangle ABC forms correctly with M as orthocenter using the derived values. # Construction Conditions: - The described construction can only be completed if the circumcenter of the triangle ABC lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment BC and if the distance MC is less than or equal to the diameter of the circumcircle. # Conclusion: By systematically using reflections and properties inherent to triangles and their circumcircles, we can determine the position of point A ensuring that the results satisfy all given conditions using purely compass-based constructions.

According to the problem, Jancy had Rs. 100 in the denomination of Rs 50. This means she had ( frac{100}{50} = 2 ) notes of Rs 50 denomination. Now, we can set up the equations based on the information given: 1. The total amount from the Rs 70 notes and the Rs 50 notes is Rs 5000. [ 70x + 50y = 5000 ] 2. We already know that ( y = 2 ) (since she had Rs. 100 in Rs 50 notes).

Firstly, we note the initial digits of sqrt{2} and thus the first few values of a_n:  - a_1=4, a_2=1, a_3=4, a_4=2, a_5=1, a_6=3ldots Given that b_1=a_1=4, and for any nin mathbb{N}^{*}, b_{n+1}=a_{b_n}, we derive the following: - b_2=a_4=2, b_3=a_2=1, b_4=a_1=4ldots From these observations, we can deduce that {b_n} is a periodic sequence with a period of 3, i.e., b_{n+3}=b_n for all n. Therefore: - b_{3n-2}=b_1=4, b_{3n-1}=b_2=2, b_{3n}=b_3=1. We examine each case to find when b_n=n-2022: 1. **Case 1: b_{3n-2}=4** implies 4=3n-2-2022. Solving for n gives:    - 3n=2026 implies n=676. 2. **Case 2: b_{3n-1}=2** implies 2=3n-1-2022. Solving for n gives:    - 3n=2024 implies n=675. 3. **Case 3: b_{3n}=1** implies 1=3n-2022.

Let O be the center of the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC. 1. **Applying Ptolemy's Theorem:**    According to Ptolemy's Theorem, which states that for a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the pairs of opposite sides, we get:     AC_1 cdot OB_1 + AB_1 cdot OC_1 = AO cdot B_1C_1. 2. **Formulating based on distances:**    The distances d_a, d_b, and d_c of the center O of the circumscribed circle to the sides BC, CA, and AB can be understood as follows:    - d_a is the perpendicular distance from O to BC.    - d_b is the perpendicular distance from O to CA.    - d_c is the perpendicular distance from O to AB. 3. **Use geometry to transform the distances:**    From the given distances and the relationships given by properties of triangle geometry, we have:     c d_b + b d_c = a R,      a d_c + c d_a = b R,      a d_b + b d_a = c R.  4. **Area of the triangle and coordinates:**    Recall that the area of the triangle ABC can also be given by:     S = frac{1}{2} cdot a cdot d_a = frac{1}{2} cdot b cdot d_b = frac{1}{2} cdot c cdot d_c.    Therefore, the summation results in:     a d_a + b d_b + c d_c = 2S.    Using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of the semi-perimeter s and the inradius r, we get:     2S = (a + b + c)r.  5. **Combining the equations:**    Adding the three equations:     c d_b + b d_c = a R,      a d_c + c d_a = b R,      a d_b + b d_a = c R,     results in:     (c d_b + b d_c) + (a d_c + c d_a) + (a d_b + b d_a) = a R + b R + c R.     Combining like terms:     a d_a + b d_b + c d_c = (a + b + c)R.  6. **Final simplification:**    Using the area relation:     a d_a + b d_b + c d_c = (a + b + c)R = (a + b + c)r,     we yield:     (a + b + c)R = (a + b + c)r.     Simplifying, and since both sides are just expanded forms of aR, bR, and cR summation, we get:     d_a + d_b + d_c = R + r.  # Conclusion:    We have shown that the sum of the distances from the center of the circumscribed circle to the sides of the acute-angled triangle equals the sum of the radius and the inradius:     boxed{d_{a}+d_{b}+d_{c}=R+r}."},{"instruction":"Michael’s largest watermelon weighs 8 pounds.

The total number of pies eaten is 27. We know Sierra ate 12 and Bill ate 6, so together they ate 12 + 6 = 18 pies. To find out how many pies Adam ate, we subtract the number of pies Sierra and Bill ate from the total number of pies: 27 pies - 18 pies = 9 pies.

(Note: By median size angle, we mean an angle that is not larger than one of the angles and not smaller than the other. For example, in an equilateral triangle, any angle is considered to be of median size.)","output":"# Detailed Solution: 1. **Drawing the Perpendicular Line:**     - Draw a perpendicular line through point (A) to the segment (AB). This line will divide the plane into two halves.     - It is clear that ( angle BAC < 90^{circ} ) if and only if points (B) and (C) lie on the same side of this perpendicular line. 2. **Ensuring Acute Angles at (A) and (B):**     - For the triangle (ABC) to be acute-angled, all angles (angle A), (angle B), and (angle C) must be less than (90^{circ}).     - We observe that ( angle BAC < 90^{circ}) and ( angle ABC < 90^{circ}) on the same half-plane bounded by the perpendicular at (A). Thus, the locus of point (C) such that both these conditions hold is a strip parallel to the line (AB), within which the boundary is defined by perpendicular lines through (A) and (B). 3. **Constructing the Circumcircle:**     - Draw the circle with segment (AB) as its diameter. According to the theorem of the angle inscribed in a semicircle (Fact 14), any point (C) on this circle (other than (A) and (B)) makes (angle ACB = 90^circ).     - For ( angle ACB ) to be less than (90^circ), point (C) must lie inside the circle, and for ( angle ACB ) to be greater than (90^circ), point (C) must lie outside the circle. 4. **Combining Conditions:**     - Thus, the geometric place of points (C) making ( triangle ABC ) acute-angled, lies within the intersection of the half-planes determined by the perpendicular bisector of (AB) containing (A) and the interior of the disk determined by the circumcircle of (AB).     - The result is a strip within the perpendiculars passing through (A) and (B) and a circular segment as illustrated in Fig. 24b. 5. **Considering the Mid-angle Condition:**     - The condition that (angle A) is the median angle translates to two inequalities:       [       angle B leq angle A leq angle C quad text{or} quad angle C leq angle A leq angle B       ]     - Given that opposite larger angles are larger sides, the conditions can be written as:       [       AC leq BC leq AB quad text{or} quad AB leq BC leq AC       ] 6. **Bisectors and Midpoints:**     - Analyzing the median perpendicular to (AB), we recognize points lying on the same side as point (A) are closer to (A) than to (B). 7. **Final Geometric Place:**     - Considering all points such that (AC leq BC) forms a half-plane cut by the perpendicular bisector of (AB) containing (A).     - Considering (BC leq AB) implies point (C) lies within a circle centered at (B) with radius (AB).     - Combining these areas includes the aforementioned strips and circular regions, visualized in Figures 25a and 25b. 8. **Intersection of Conditions:**     - The combined figure from these regions (25c) is the geometric locus where (triangle ABC) maintains ( angle A) as the median angle and remains an acute-angled triangle.

For the next group, we choose 2 out of the remaining 3 students, which can be done in C_3^2 ways. The last student automatically forms the third group, which is C_1^1 way.

The fraction of the work done by Avery in 1 hour is ( frac{1}{A} ), and the fraction of the work done by Tom in 1 hour is ( frac{1}{2} ), since Tom can complete the wall in 2 hours. Together, in 1 hour, they complete ( frac{1}{A} + frac{1}{2} ) of the work. After Avery leaves, Tom works alone for another 30 minutes (which is ( frac{1}{2} ) hour), completing the wall. In that time, Tom completes ( frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4} ) of the work.

Next, we compute the distance from the center of the circle to the line l. The formula for the distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} For our case, A=1, B=3, and C=-12, and the point is (6,5): d = frac{|1cdot6 + 3cdot5 - 12|}{sqrt{1^2 + 3^2}} = frac{9}{sqrt{10}} = frac{9sqrt{10}}{10} Since d < 4 (the radius), the line l intersects the circle, and therefore, the distance from any point P on the circle to the line l can be as small as 0.

Since every face of the rectangular prism is painted and then it is cut into small cubes of size (1 , text{m} times 1 , text{m} times 1 , text{m}), the smallest dimension of (a, b, c) must be at least 2 meters; thus, (a geq 2), (b geq 2), and (c geq 2). 3. The small cubes with exactly one face painted are those that are on the surface but not on the edges. Such cubes are on faces that are parallel to each pair of dimensions, excluding the edges in the intersection of these faces.

We denote ( n(k) ) as the index ( n ) when ( leftlfloor frac{x_n}{n} rightrfloor = k ). 3. **Finding ( n(k) ):**    We observe the sequence for small values of ( n ):    - For ( n = 1 ), ( x_1 = 1 ), so ( leftlfloor frac{x_1}{1} rightrfloor = 1 ).

From any route, it is possible to transfer to any other route, but only at one stop. III. From any stop, you can reach any other stop, but only with one route. How many bus routes are there in that city?","output":"1. Let's denote the bus routes (lines) by ( L_1, L_2, ldots, L_n ), where ( n ) is the number of routes we need to determine. 2. According to condition I, each route has exactly 3 stops. Let's denote the stops on the ( i )-th route as ( A_i, B_i, ) and ( C_i ). 3. According to condition II, any two routes must intersect at exactly one common stop. This means every pair ((A_i, B_i, C_i)) and ((A_j, B_j, C_j)) for ( i ne j ) has exactly one common element. 4. According to condition III, any stop must be reachable from any other stop via exactly one route without transferring. This implies that any stop must appear in exactly two different routes as a result of the unique intersection. 5. Considering the conditions, we set up our configuration as follows:     - Every bus route must intersect with every other bus route exactly once. 6. We represent this scenario using combinatorial designs known as balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs). Here, each route can be seen as a block of size 3, and each stop can be seen as an element shared among routes.     - In a BIBD with parameters ((v, k, lambda)), ( v ) is the number of elements, ( k ) is the block size, and ( lambda ) is the number of times any pair of elements appear together in blocks.          - In our case, ( v = n ) (number of stops), (k = 3) (each route has 3 stops), and (lambda = 1) (each pair of stops appears together exactly once). 7. A known result for BIBDs is that in a system where each element appears in exactly ( r ) blocks and any pair of blocks intersects in exactly one element (i.e., (lambda = 1)), the number of blocks ( b ), the number of elements ( v ), and the block size ( k ) must satisfy:     [     r (k - 1) = lambda (v - 1)     ]          Given ( k = 3 ), (lambda = 1), solving for ( v = 2 times 3 - 2 = 4 ). 8. However, verifying whether ( n = 4 ) satisfies all conditions, we proceed by incrementally constructing valid scenarios and determining inconsistencies. 9. We find that a correct construction with:     - A structure ensuring all given conditions primarily adheres to classical geometry properties using projective planes. 10. The smallest projective plane consists of 7 points (elements) and 7 lines (routes), where each line intersects every line exactly once:     [     b = frac{v(v - 1)}{k(k - 1)} = frac{7(7 - 1)}{3(3 - 1)} = 7 , (text{block must match routes})     ] 11.

If perpendicular lines are drawn from ( S ) to the planes of the tetrahedron, show that the plane ( ABC ) passes through the center ( O ) of the sphere. 1. **Base of the Tetrahedron**:    Consider the cross-section through point ( S ) and line ( BC ). The plane ( SBC ) intersects the sphere in a circle, with ( BC ) as a diameter. 2. **Diagonal Points**:    Let ( S_1 ) be the point on the sphere diametrically opposite ( S ) in the circle formed by the intersection of ( SBC ) with the sphere.

Conclusion: The initial constraint AP^2 + BP^2 = 10 under the condition that angle APB = 90^circ is inconsistent with the geometry of a circle with diameter 4 (radius 2). Hence, there are 0 points P that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. The final answer is boxed{text{A}}"},{"instruction":"Corn costs 89 cents per pound, and beans cost 55 cents per pound.

Since the absolute value function |x| is even, meaning |x| = |-x|, we can infer that f(x) will return the same value for x and -x. Specifically,  f(-x) = 2^{|-x|} - 2 = 2^{|x|} - 2 = f(x). This property indicates that f(x) is an even function. Next, we consider the inequality x[f(x) + f(-x)] > 0. Since f(-x) = f(x) for all x (as established above), the inequality simplifies to: 2xf(x) > 0  Leftrightarrow  xf(x) > 0. Now, let's analyze the two cases based on the sign of x: 1. For x geq 0, the inequality xf(x) > 0 simplifies further to: 2^{|x|} - 2 > 0  Leftrightarrow  2^{|x|} > 2  Leftrightarrow  |x| > 1. Since x geq 0, this condition becomes x > 1. 2.

Phillip used 10 cucumbers to make these 48 pickles, so each cucumber makes 48 pickles / 10 cucumbers = 4.8 pickles. However, since you can't make a fraction of a pickle from a cucumber, we need to consider that the number of pickles per cucumber must be a whole number.

We will first prove a simpler assertion: if ( A = {1, 2, ldots, 12} ) and each element is colored red or white, there are numbers colored with a single color whose sum is ( 13 ). Then, by multiplying everything by ( 155 ), we achieve the desired result. 2. **Majority Color Argument:**    Define the majority color to be the one that has the most members (pick an arbitrary color if it's 6 and 6). Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume the majority color is red. Let ( k ) be the smallest red number. 3. **Case Analysis:**    - **Case ( k = 7 ):**      If ( k = 7 ), then ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ) are all white. We can find that ( 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 ), which are all white numbers.    - **Case ( k = 3, 4, 5, 6 ):**      If ( k = 3, 4, 5, 6 ), then ( 1 ) and ( k-1 ) are white. Consider ( 13 - k ):      - If ( 13 - k ) is red, then ( k + (13 - k) = 13 ), which are all red numbers.      - If ( 13 - k ) is white, then ( 1 + (k-1) + (13 - k) = 13 ), which are all white numbers.    - **Case ( k = 2 ):**      Suppose the above assertion is false. So ( 1 ) is white, ( 12 ) is red, and ( 11 ) is white. Consider ( m ), the second lowest red number:      - If ( m = 7 ), then ( 3, 4, 5, 6 ) are all white, so ( 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 ), which are all white numbers.      - If ( m = 4, 5, 6 ), then consider ( 13 - m ):        - If ( 13 - m ) is white, then ( 1 + (m-1) + (13 - m) = 13 ), which are all white numbers.        - If ( 13 - m ) is red, then ( m + (13 - m) = 13 ), which are all red numbers.      - If ( m = 3 ), we get the following chain of deductions to avoid contradiction: ( 8 ) is white, ( 5 ) is red, ( 6 ) (since ( 13 - 5 - 2 = 6 )) is white, ( 7 ) is red, ( 4 ) (since ( 13 - 1 - 8 = 4 )) is red.

Thus, we have shown that for any coloring of the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 12} ), there exists a subset of numbers colored with a single color whose sum is ( 13 ).

So, we have: 10,000 apples = X * A When 100 more people join the group, the number of people becomes X + 100, and each person receives 15 apples less, so: 10,000 apples = (X + 100) * (A - 15) Now we have a system of two equations: 1) X * A = 10,000 2) (X + 100) * (A - 15) = 10,000 We can expand the second equation: X * A - 15X + 100A - 1500 = 10,000 Since X * A = 10,000 (from the first equation), we can substitute 10,000 for X * A in the second equation: 10,000 - 15X + 100A - 1500 = 10,000 Simplifying, we get: -15X + 100A = 1500 Now, we can express A in terms of X using the first equation: A = 10,000 / X Substitute A in the second equation: -15X + 100 * (10,000 / X) = 1500 Simplify: -15X + 1,000,000 / X = 1500 Multiply through by X to get rid of the fraction: -15X^2 + 1,000,000 = 1500X Rearrange the equation to set it to zero: -15X^2 - 1500X + 1,000,000 = 0 Divide through by -15 to simplify: X^2 + 100X - 66,666.67 = 0 This is a quadratic equation in the form of AX^2 + BX + C = 0. We can solve for X using the quadratic formula: X = [-B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / (2A) In our case, A = 1, B = 100, and C = -66,666.67. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula: X = [-100 ± sqrt(100^2 - 4 * 1 * -66,666.67)] / (2 * 1) X = [-100 ± sqrt(10,000 + 266,666.68)] / 2 X = [-100 ± sqrt(276,666.68)] / 2 X = [-100 ± 526.0] / 2 We have two potential solutions for X: X1 = (-100 + 526.0) / 2 X1 = 426.0 / 2 X1 = 213 X2 = (-100 - 526.0) / 2 X2 = -626.0 / 2 X2 = -313 Since the number of people cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.

(Please provide the specific solution process)","output":"# Solution:  Part 1: Given that Xiao Wen used 1 A Type coupon and 4 C Type coupons, and saved a total of 520, we can calculate the number of B Type coupons used as follows: The total savings from 1 A Type coupon and 4 C Type coupons is 100 + 4 times 20 = 100 + 80 = 180. The remaining savings to reach 520 must come from B Type coupons: 520 - 180 = 340. Since each B Type coupon saves 68, the number of B Type coupons used is 340 div 68 = 5. Therefore, Xiao Wen used boxed{5} B Type coupons.  Part 2: Let the number of A Type coupons used be x and the number of B Type coupons used be y. We have the system of equations: begin{cases} x + y = 5  100x + 68y = 404 end{cases}  Solving this system, we substitute the first equation into the second to find the values of x and y: 100x + 68(5 - x) = 404  100x + 340 - 68x = 404  32x = 64  x = 2  Substituting x = 2 back into the first equation, we get 2 + y = 5, which gives y = 3.

Given b, c leq 16, we find b = 6 and c = 15 as a solution. 3. **Using A and C Type coupons:**    We have 100a + 20c = 708. This simplifies to 25a + 5c = 177.

Here's the detailed breakdown: Consider a matrix where each element ( a_{ij} ) represents a game between participant ( i ) and participant ( j ). Mark the invalid games as red, which lie in the lower triangle of the matrix below the main diagonal.    - The matrix diagonal divides the games into two symmetrical halves. - The area of the part of the matrix above the middle line but below the main diagonal is less than ( S/4 ) because these cells do not cover a full square area, but an eighth part of the total number of games. - Hence, the area of red cells (invalid games) in the upper half of the table is less than ( S/4 ). Since the area of the red cells in the lower half of the table can't cover more than half of the table, we deduce that the total area covered by the red cells (invalid games) is strictly less than ( 3S/4 ). **Conclusion**: Thus, the fraction of invalid games is less than ( 3/4 ) of the total number of games.

Define the results of the games between participants from different groups as follows: - If players have the same number, or the difference in their numbers is exactly ( m ), the game ends in a draw. - If the difference in their numbers is greater than ( m ), the player with the lower number wins. - Conversely, the player with a higher number wins if the difference is less than ( m ). By structuring the outcomes in this manner, we know that within each group the placements (numbering) determine the ranking. Therefore, the final arrangement in the results table is determined by these intra-group results: - Each player in any “foreign” group (outgroup game) scores exactly ( m ) points. - Thus, each player has a final score based on intra-group play results. Consider now the number of valid games, for ( m ) groups of participants: - Inside each group, every player ( k leq m ) wins ( (m - k) ) valid games against other members of their group. - Higher numbered players do not win any valid games. - Total valid games inside a group: ( sum_{k=1}^{m-1} (m - k) = (m-1) + (m-2) + ldots + 1 = frac{m(m-1)}{2} ).

To find the (text{GCD}(1000, 15)), we use the Euclidean algorithm:     - (1000) divided by (15) gives a quotient of (66) and a remainder of (10) (since (1000 = 15 times 66 + 10)).     - (15) divided by (10) gives a quotient of (1) and a remainder of (5) (since (15 = 10 times 1 + 5)).     - (10) divided by (5) gives a quotient of (2) and a remainder of (0) (since (10 = 5 times 2 + 0)).     Since the remainder is (0), the algorithm terminates and the (text{GCD}(1000, 15)) is (5). 3.

Prove that   n  is a sum of 2 squares of positive integers, and that such   n  does exist.","output":"To prove that ( n ) is a sum of two squares of positive integers and that such ( n ) exists, we will follow the steps outlined in the solution and provide detailed calculations and justifications. 1. **Representation of ( n^2 ) as a difference of cubes:**    Given ( n^2 ) can be represented as a difference of cubes of two consecutive positive integers, we have:    [    n^2 = (x+1)^3 - x^3    ]    Expanding the right-hand side, we get:    [    (x+1)^3 - x^3 = (x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1) - x^3 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1    ]    Therefore, we have:    [    n^2 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1    ] 2. **Finding ( n ) in terms of ( y_k ) and ( z_k ):**    Let ( y_k ) and ( z_k ) be integers such that:    [    z_k + y_k sqrt{3} = (1 + sqrt{3})(2 + sqrt{3})^k    ]    We need to show that ( y_k ) and ( z_k ) are odd and that:    [    z_k^2 - 3y_k^2 = -2    ]    This can be verified by induction or by direct calculation for specific values of ( k ). 3. **Expressing ( n_k ) in terms of ( y_k ) and ( z_k ):**    Define:    [    n_k = frac{3y_k^2 - 1}{2} = frac{z_k^2 + 1}{2}    ]    We need to verify that ( n_k ) is an integer. Since ( y_k ) and ( z_k ) are odd, ( y_k^2 ) and ( z_k^2 ) are odd, making ( 3y_k^2 - 1 ) and ( z_k^2 + 1 ) even, thus ( n_k ) is an integer. 4. **Verification of ( n_k^2 ) as a difference of cubes:**    Let:    [    x_k = frac{y_k z_k - 1}{2}    ]    Then:    [    n_k^2 = (x_k + 1)^3 - x_k^3    ]    This follows from the initial representation of ( n^2 ) as a difference of cubes. 5. **Examples and existence of such ( n ):**    Examples of ( (n_k, x_k) ) are ( (1, 0) ), ( (13, 7) ), ( (181, 104) ), etc. These examples show that such ( n ) exists and can be found for various values of ( k ). 6. **Proving ( n ) is a sum of two squares:**    Since ( n_k = frac{3y_k^2 - 1}{2} ) and ( y_k ) is an integer, we need to show that ( n_k ) can be expressed as a sum of two squares. By Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, an integer ( n ) can be expressed as a sum of two squares if every prime of the form ( 4k+3 ) in its prime factorization appears with an even exponent.

Therefore, we can write:    [    100a + 10b + c = 5abc    ] 2. **Simplification Using Divisibility**:    We need to express c in terms of a, b, and c. We know that the number must be five times the product of its digits. Rearranging the equation, we get:    [    100a + 10b + c = 5abc implies c = 5abc - 100a - 10b    ]    Hence, it is clear that c has to be a factor of 5 because it is alone on one side of the equation. Furthermore, c cannot be zero because the product of the digits would also be zero, violating the condition. Therefore:    [    c = 5    ] 3. **Plugging c=5 into the Equation**:    Substituting c = 5 back into the original equation, we obtain:    [    100a + 10b + 5 = 5ab cdot 5 = 25ab    ]    Simplifying further:    [    100a + 10b + 5 = 25ab implies 20a + 2b + 1 = 5ab    ]    We further simplify to:    [    2(10a + b) = 5ab - 1    ] 4. **Analyzing the Divisibility and Modular Arithmetic**:    To satisfy the above equation, 10a + b must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.

This means that the work done by 2 men in 1 day is one-third of the 36 m long cloth, which is 12 m. Since the rate of work should be consistent, we can set up a proportion to find the number of men in the first group: Work done by M men in 1 day : Work done by 2 men in 1 day = Length of cloth colored by M men : Length of cloth colored by 2 men So, we have: M men * 1 day : 2 men * 1 day = 24 m : 12 m Now, we can simplify the ratio: M : 2 = 24 : 12 Divide both sides of the ratio by 12 to simplify: M : 2 = 2 : 1 Now, we can see that M is twice the number of men compared to 2 men.

Each side of the polygon ( P ) denoted by (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n), lies within the bounds of this square. Since the polygon ( P ) is convex, we can inscribe the polygon in the square without any of its sides extending beyond. 3. **Construct right-angled triangles**:     Extend each side of the polygon outside and along the boundary of the square to form right-angled triangles where the sides of the polygon are the hypotenuses. Construct triangles such that the legs are parallel to the sides of the square. Let's consider side ( a_i ) of the polygon ( P ). Form right-angled triangles by extending orthogonally (90 degrees) from either endpoint of ( a_i ) to the boundary of the square.  4. **Sum of squares relation**:     Each side ( a_i ) of the polygon can be represented as the hypotenuse of these right-angled triangles, whose legs are constrained within the sides of the unit square and aligned parallel to the axes.     Let ( (x_i, y_i) ) be the legs of the right triangle such that ( a_i^2 = x_i^2 + y_i^2 ). 5. **Bounding ( x_i ) and ( y_i )**:     Given that these triangles are within the unit square:     - Summing the legs of the triangles orthogonal to one side of the square must add up to less than 1 because all horizontal legs along one side fit within 1 unit.     - Similarly, the sum of the vertical legs formed along the corresponding vertical sides of the square does not exceed 1. 6. **Applying the inequality**:     We can say that for each set of horizontal and vertical legs:     [     sum x_i leq 1 quad text{and} quad sum y_i leq 1.     ]     Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the context of the square sums, we have:     [     (sum x_i)^2 leq sum (x_i^2 cdot 1) leq sum x_i^2.     ]     Since (sum x_i leq 1) and similarly (sum y_i leq 1):     [     (sum x_i)^2 leq 1 quad text{and} quad (sum y_i)^2 leq 1.     ]     Hence,     [     sum x_i^2 leq 1 quad text{and} quad sum y_i^2 leq 1.     ] 7. **Summing over all sides**:     Considering the contributions from all four sides of the square:     [     sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^2 + y_i^2) = (sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2) + (sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2) leq 1 + 1 = 2,     ]     for each horizontal and vertical side's contribution in the pair of axes.

Let's start by understanding the setup: we need to find the smallest area of a triangle that fully contains a unit square.  2. Consider that for the minimal area, each side of the triangle should contain at least one vertex of the square. If not, we can theoretically slide the triangle side parallel towards the square, reducing the area, which contradicts the assumption of minimality. 3. Suppose a side of the triangle contains a vertex and part of the interior of one of the square's sides. Since the triangle surrounds the square, this implies that this side must cover the entire side of the square. 4. Hence, it can be assumed that in the minimal triangle, each side contains one vertex of the unit square. 5. If any two sides of the triangle contain the same corner of the square, it implies a common vertex between the triangle and the square. We can rotate the sides around this vertex to align them with the sides of the square without increasing the area. 6. By the generality of these considerations, let’s use specific notations as indicated in the figure referred (though the figure isn't provided, let's denote as needed):    - Let D T_1 = a, A T_1 = x     - D T_2 = b and B T_2 = y    - We have: G T_1 = 1-a and E T_2 = 1-b 7.

Consider:    [    frac{1-a}{x} + frac{1-b}{y} - frac{1-x y}{y} = frac{1}{x} - frac{a}{x} + frac{1}{y} - frac{1}{y} - frac{b}{y} + x = x + frac{1}{x} - left( frac{a}{x} + frac{x}{a} right) geq 0    ]    Knowing a leq 1 implies x leq frac{x}{a} leq 1, and the function f(t) = t + frac{1}{t} is monotonically decreasing on (0,1]. 12.

Equality occurs if T_{F Q C P}=0, meaning one side of the square is precisely along one side of the triangle, and the remaining two vertices of the square lie on the other two sides of the triangle.

In 8 minutes, Pipe C drains: C L/min * 8 min = 8C L We know that the extra water drained by Pipe C is 200 L, so we can set up the equation: 8C L = 200 L Now, we solve for C: C = 200 L / 8 min C = 25 L/min Therefore, the rate at which Pipe C drains the tank is boxed{25}  liters per minute."},{"instruction":"ectangular paper , when folded into two congruent parts had a perimeter of 34 cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 38 cm when folded along the other set of sides . what is the area of the paper ?","output":"Let's denote the length of the paper as L and the width as W. When the paper is folded along one set of sides, we can assume it's folded along the width, making the folded piece have dimensions L and W/2. The perimeter of this folded piece would be 2L + W, which is given as 34 cm. So, we have the equation: 2L + W = 34  (1) When the paper is folded along the other set of sides, we can assume it's folded along the length, making the folded piece have dimensions L/2 and W. The perimeter of this folded piece would be L + 2W, which is given as 38 cm. So, we have the equation: L + 2W = 38  (2) Now we have a system of two equations with two variables.

Hence, the minimum value on the interval occurs at the right endpoint, x=1. We calculate this value as:      f(1) = -4(1)^2 + 4a(1) - 4a - a^2 = -4 + 4a - 4a - a^2 = -a^2 - 4.    - When frac{a}{2} > frac{1}{2}, or equivalently a > 1, the vertex lies to the right of the interval [0,1]. Hence, the minimum value on the interval occurs at the left endpoint, x=0. We calculate this value as:      f(0) = -4(0)^2 + 4a(0) - 4a - a^2 = -4a - a^2. 4. **Conclusion:**    - For a leqslant 1, the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [0,1] is -a^2 - 4, encapsulated as boxed{-a^2 - 4}.    - For a > 1, the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [0,1] is -a^2 - 4a, encapsulated as boxed{-a^2 - 4a}."},{"instruction":"Out of the 400 emails that Antonia received in her mail, 1/4 were spam emails, while 2/5 of the remaining emails were promotional messages.

(2) Let the equation of the line AB be y = kx + m, with A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). Combining this with the equation of the ellipse gives the system: begin{cases} frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1,  y = kx + m, end{cases} which simplifies to: (3 + 4k^2)x^2 + 8kmx + 4(m^2 - 3) = 0. Since the line intersects the ellipse in two points, we must have a positive discriminant, hence 3 + 4k^2 - m^2 > 0.

Therefore: y_1 y_2 = k^2 x_1 x_2 + km(x_1 + x_2) + m^2 = frac{3(m^2 - 4k^2)}{3 + 4k^2}. Since the circle with diameter AB passes through the right vertex of ellipse C, and knowing that the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is -1, we have: y_1 y_2 + x_1 x_2 - 2(x_1 + x_2) + 4 = 0.

For m_1 = -2k, the line's equation is y = k(x - 2), which implies the line passes through the fixed point (2, 0), contradicting the given information.

Prove that there exists a coefficient whose absolute value is greater than 27. 1. Given that the polynomial has 1 as a root of multiplicity at least eight, it can be written in the form:    [    f(x) = (x-1)^8(a x^2 + b x + c)    ]    where (a), (b), and (c) are real numbers, and (a neq 0). 2. Expanding ( f(x) ) using the binomial theorem and polynomial multiplication, we obtain:    [    begin{aligned}    f(x) &= (x-1)^8 cdot (a x^2 + b x + c)     &= a x^{10} + (b - 8a) x^9 + (c - 8b + 28a) x^8 + (-8c + 28b - 56a) x^7     &quad + (28c - 56b + 70a) x^6 + (-56c + 70b - 56a) x^5 + (70c - 56b ldots)    end{aligned}    ] 3. Notice that the coefficients should be integers since ( f(x) ) is given to have integer coefficients. Thus, ( a ), ( c ), and ( b - 8a ) must be integers, meaning (a), (b), and (c) are integers. 4. Assume, contrary to what we want to prove, that the absolute values of all coefficients are less than 28. Analyzing the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-degree terms and their coefficients, we write the inequalities:    [    begin{align*}    |5c - 4b + 2a| &< 28     |-4c + 5b - 4a| &< 28     |2c - 4b + 5a| &< 28    end{align*}    ] 5. Since ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are integers, any expression involving ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) resulting in an inequality less than 28 must round to at most 1. This is because the terms are linear combinations of integers. 6. Considering ( 3|3c - 3b + 2a| ) and the difference of inequalities:    [    begin{aligned}    |3c - 3b + 2a| &= |(5c - 4b + 2a) - (-4c + 5b - 4a)|     &< 2 + 2 = 4     end{aligned}    ]    This implies:    [    |3c - 3b + 2a| = 0    ]    However, for integers, this means:    [    3c - 3b + 2a = 0    ] 7. Similarly, consider ( 2 c - 3 b + 3 a ):    [    3|2c - 3b + 3a| = |2c - 4b + 5a| + | -4c + 5b - 4a|     2c - 3b + 3a = 0    ] 8. The differences imply ( c = a ) and ( b = frac{5}{3} a ), and thus ( b ) is not an integer if (a) is an integer. 9. Analyzing the seventh-degree coefficient and using the obtained (c) and (b):    [    |8a - 28 cdot frac{5}{3} a + 56a| = left| frac{52}{3} a right| < 28    ]    Simplifies to:    [    |a| < frac{21}{13}    ]    Which approximates that (a < 2). But (a) must be an integer, thus (a = pm 1). However, this results in (b) being non-integer, which is a contradiction. # Conclusion: Our initial assumption that all coefficients have absolute values less than 28 leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, the unit price of the \\"Traditional Culture\\" classic textbook is 10 yuan, and the unit price of the \\"Red Education\\" classic textbook, being 1.4 times that, is 1.4 times 10 = 14 yuan. Thus, the unit prices of the two classic textbooks ordered by the school are boxed{14 text{ yuan for \\"Red Education\\" and } 10 text{ yuan for \\"Traditional Culture\\"}}. (2) Let the quantity of \\"Traditional Culture\\" classic textbooks ordered be denoted as a. Then, the quantity of \\"Red Education\\" classic textbooks ordered is (1000-a), as the total order is for 1000 copies. Given the constraints that the quantity of \\"Traditional Culture\\" textbooks does not exceed 400 copies and the total cost does not exceed 12880 yuan, we can set up the following system of inequalities: [ left{begin{array}{l} a leq 400  10a + 14(1000-a) leq 12880 end{array}right. ] Solving for a, we find: [ begin{align*} 10a + 14(1000-a) &leq 12880  10a + 14000 - 14a &leq 12880  -4a &leq -1120  a &geq 280 end{align*} ] Given the constraint a leq 400, we find that 280 leq a leq 400. Let the total cost of ordering both textbooks be denoted as w yuan. Then, we have: [ w = 10a + 14(1000-a) = -4a + 14000 ] Since -4 < 0, w decreases as a increases. Therefore, to minimize w, we set a to its maximum value within the given constraints, which is 400. Substituting a = 400 into the equation for w, we get: [ w = -4 times 400 + 14000 = 12400 ] Thus, the minimum total cost for ordering these two classic textbooks is boxed{12400 text{ yuan}}."},{"instruction":"Mary has 5 green crayons, 8 blue crayons, and 7 yellow crayons of different shades.

Completing the square for both x and y terms, we get: [ begin{align*} x^{2}-2x+1+y^{2}-4y+4 &= 4  (x-1)^{2}+(y-2)^{2} &= 4 end{align*} ] This shows that the center of circle C is C(1,2) and the radius r=sqrt{4}=2. Given that CEbot CF and P is the midpoint of EF, we conclude that angle CEF=angle CFE=45^{circ}. This is because the chords CE and CF are perpendicular, implying that triangle CEF is isosceles with CE=CF. Therefore, the length of CP, which is half the length of EF, equals frac{r}{sqrt{2}}=frac{2}{sqrt{2}}=sqrt{2}. Thus, the equation of the locus of point P is: [ begin{align*} (x-1)^{2}+(y-2)^{2} &= (sqrt{2})^2  (x-1)^{2}+(y-2)^{2} &= 2 end{align*} ] This circle has center C(1,2) and radius R=sqrt{2}. For points A and B on the line l: x-y-3=0 to always satisfy ∠APB≥frac{π}{2}, the circle with diameter AB must be tangent to or contained inside the circle with equation (x-1)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=2. The distance d from the center C(1,2) to the line l is calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line: [ d = frac{|1-2-3|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}} = frac{|-4|}{sqrt{2}} = 2sqrt{2} ] Let M be the midpoint of AB. The condition d leqslant frac{|AB|}{2} must hold for the circle with diameter AB to be tangent to or contained inside the locus circle.

Thus, (k) can be 2, 4, or 5. 4. **Counting Fortunate Numbers for Each (k):**    - For (k = 2):      - (overline{cd} = 2 cdot overline{ab})      - (overline{ab}) can range from 10 to 49, giving us 40 valid (overline{ab}):        [        10 leq overline{ab} leq 49 implies 40 text{ possible values}        ]    - For (k = 4):      - (overline{cd} = 4 cdot overline{ab})      - (overline{ab}) can range from 10 to 24, giving us 15 valid (overline{ab}):        [        10 leq overline{ab} leq 24 implies 15 text{ possible values}        ]    - For (k = 5):      - (overline{cd} = 5 cdot overline{ab})      - (overline{ab}) can range from 10 to 19, giving us 10 valid (overline{ab}):        [        10 leq overline{ab} leq 19 implies 10 text{ possible values}        ] 5. **Total Number of Fortunate Numbers:**    - Summing all possibilities:      [      40 + 15 + 10 = 65      ]   Conclusion:   [   boxed{65}   ]  Part 2: Finding the Largest Odd Fortunate Number 1. **Condition for Odd Fortunate Number:**    - To ensure (overline{cd}) forms an odd number, (k) must be odd.

[    overline{cd} = 5 cdot 19 = 95    ] 3. **Forming the Largest Odd Fortunate Number:**    - Hence, the largest odd fortunate number is:      [      overline{abcd} = 19 cdot 100 + 95 = 1995      ]   Conclusion:   [   boxed{1995}   ]"},{"instruction":"A biotech company needs to hire a number of new researchers so that 120 of them will work on genetics research, 90 will work on microbiology research, and exactly 40 will work on both genetics and microbiology (these 40 are included in the 120 and 90 mentioned above).

Let ( A, B, C, D ) be the ends of the original legs of the stool, and let ( A', B', C', D' ) be the ends of the legs after being cut. We need to show that ( AA' + CC' = BB' + DD' ).     2. Since the stool stands on the floor touching the ground with all four legs, the points ( A', B', C', D' ) lie in the same plane.  3. The stool is square-shaped, which means the planes ( ABA'B' ) and ( CDC'D' ) are parallel. Consequently, ( A'B' ) is parallel to ( C'D' ) and ( B'C' ) is parallel to ( A'D' ). 4. Hence, the quadrilateral ( A'B'C'D' ) forms a parallelogram, and its diagonals intersect at a common midpoint, denoted as ( O' ). 5. Let ( O ) be the center of the square ( ABCD ).

This graph trivially has no vertices with odd degree and no cycles, thus the base case holds. **Inductive Step:** 1. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that any graph with (n) edges, where all vertices have even degree, can be traversed by a cycle. 2. **Inductive Goal:** Prove that this property remains true for a graph with (n+1) edges, still assuming all vertices have even degree. To achieve this: 1. Consider an arbitrary connected graph (G) with (n+1) edges where all vertices have even degrees. 2. Since by assumption there are no vertices of odd degree, there must be at least one cycle in the graph because the graph does not contain any hanging vertices (vertices of degree 1). 3. **Suppose (C)** is a simple cycle within this graph. 3. **Temporary Removal of Cycle:**     * Remove all edges of the cycle (C) from the graph (G).    * The remaining graph (G') might split into multiple connected components. However, note that all the vertices inside each component of (G') still maintain even degrees because any degree change inside a cycle would be neutralized by removing the edges cyclically. 4. According to the induction hypothesis:    * Each of these components of (G') can independently be traversed by a cycle because they're graphs with (n) or fewer edges where all vertices still have even degrees. 5. **Reconstructing the Original Graph Cycle:**    * Start traversing the cycle (C) in the graph (G).    * Whenever the traversing process enters a vertex belonging to one of the components of (G'), use the cycle traversal within that specific component, then return to the cycle (C).    * Continue this pattern until the entire graph is traversed, ensuring the traversal path closes back at the starting vertex in (C).

Knowing that {b_{n}+2} is a geometric sequence with a first term of 4 and a common ratio of 2, we can express the n-th term of this sequence as: [b_{n}+2 = 4 times 2^{n-1} = 2^{n+1}.] Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us the general formula for the sequence {b_{n}}: [b_{n} = 2^{n+1} - 2.] The sequence {a_{n}} is related to {b_{n}} through the relationship b_{n}=a_{n+1}-a_{n}. To find the general formula for {a_{n}}, we sum the differences from a_{1} to a_{n}: [a_{n} = (a_{n}-a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}) + ldots + (a_{2}-a_{1}) + a_{1}.] Substituting the expression for b_{n}, we get: [a_{n} = (2^{n}-2) + (2^{n-1}-2) + ldots + (2^{2}-2) + 2.] This simplifies to: [a_{n} = 2^{n+1} - 2n.] Therefore, the general formula for the sequence {a_{n}} is encapsulated as: [boxed{a_{n} = 2^{n+1} - 2n}.]"},{"instruction":"A triangle is inscribed in a circle.

Using y = g(x), we get [g(g(x) + 2) = g(g(x)) + 2 = g(x) + 2.] For nonzero x, setting y = frac{1}{x}, we derive [g(2 + g(x)) = xgleft(frac{1}{x}right) + g(x).] Thus, xgleft(frac{1}{x}right) + g(x) = g(x) + 2, leading to [xgleft(frac{1}{x}right) = 2,] which implies [gleft(frac{1}{x}right) = frac{2}{x}]for all x neq 0.

Upon hearing this, Dr. Sharadek claimed that he had once encountered a society where conditions b), c), d), and e) were met, but each person knew exactly six others and had an acquaintance who could introduce them to everyone else. Explain these situations.","output":"To construct the required society, we need to organize the relationships among the 12 individuals in a specific way using the structure of a dodecahedron (a polyhedron with 12 faces). 1. **Understanding the Dodecahedron**:     A dodecahedron has 12 faces, each of which is a regular pentagon. Each vertex of the dodecahedron is shared by 3 faces, and each face shares its edges with 5 other faces.  2. **Assigning Individuals to Faces**:     For condition (c) to hold (\\"among those gathered, one could not choose four mutually acquainted people\\"):    - We place each one of the 12 individuals on one of the 12 faces of the dodecahedron. 3. **Establishing Acquaintances**:     For conditions (a) and (d) to hold:    - Each individual is acquainted with those on the 5 faces that share an edge with his/her face.        To ensure this, if we denote individuals by (A_1, A_2, ..., A_{12}) and suppose:    - Each individual (A_i) on a face is acquainted with the individuals that are on the adjacent 5 faces. Since a dodecahedron has exactly 5 neighboring faces for any face, this setup naturally follows. 4. **Setting Up the Network**:    Now, we will check if all the conditions (b), (c), (d), and (e) hold:    - **Condition (b)**: \\"Each belonged to a trio of mutually acquainted people\\":      - In a dodecahedron, each vertex is shared by exactly 3 faces. Since each face represents an individual, each vertex (where 3 faces meet) consists of three individuals who know each other.    - **Condition (c)**: \\"One could not choose four mutually acquainted people\\":      - In the arrangement, each individual knows 5 others. So there is no subset of 4 individuals where all are mutually acquainted, since this would require a complete subgraph of (K_4) within their acquaintance graph, which does not exist given each vertex only connects to a maximum of 5 others, not to all within a subset of 4 forming (K_4).    - **Condition (d)**: “Each person was in a trio of people who were mutually unacquainted”:      - We consider each individual unknown 6 others (those not on the 5 neighboring faces or themselves). For each person, any trio chosen from these 6 individuals will be mutually unacquainted.    - **Condition (e)**: “Each could find among their unacquainted people a person with whom they have no common acquaintances”:      - Given that each individual does not know 6 individuals, within these 6 there will be pairs that do not share common acquaintances. This is deduced from the symmetrical properties and adjacency rules of the dodecahedron. # Conclusion: The situation described by Doctor Sharadek matches the setting of assigning individuals to the faces of a regular dodecahedron, ensuring the specified acquaintance and non-acquaintance conditions: Each condition from b), c), d), to e) is met through this arrangement. Thus, the constructed society can be organized using the setup of a regular dodecahedron, validating Dr. Sharadek's claim.    boxed{}"},{"instruction":"f q is the product of the integers from 1 to 100, inclusive, what is the greatest integer k for which 7^k is a factor of q?","output":"To find the greatest integer k for which 7^k is a factor of q, we need to determine how many times the prime number 7 appears in the prime factorization of the product of the integers from 1 to 100, inclusive.

Each multiple of 7 contributes at least one factor of 7, each multiple of 49 contributes an additional factor (for a total of two), and each multiple of 343 contributes yet another factor (for a total of three), and so on. Let's count: Multiples of 7: There are 100 ÷ 7 = 14 (rounded down) multiples of 7 between 1 and 100. Multiples of 49 (7^2): There are 100 ÷ 49 = 2 (rounded down) multiples of 49 between 1 and 100.

A invests 1/6 of the capital for 1/6 of the time, so A's investment is (1/6)C * (1/6)T = C*T/36. B invests 1/3 of the capital for 1/3 of the time, so B's investment is (1/3)C * (1/3)T = C*T/9. Let's denote the part of the capital that C invests as x. Since C invests for the whole time, C's investment is xC * T. The profit is shared in proportion to the amount of capital invested and the time for which it was invested. So, the ratio of A's share to the total profit is the same as the ratio of A's investment to the total investment. A's share of the profit is 100, and the total profit is 2300. So, the ratio of A's share to the total profit is 100/2300. A's investment is C*T/36, and the total investment is the sum of A's, B's, and C's investments, which is C*T/36 + C*T/9 + xC*T. Now we can set up the equation: A's share / Total profit = A's investment / Total investment 100 / 2300 = (C*T/36) / (C*T/36 + C*T/9 + xC*T) Simplify the right side of the equation by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by C*T: 100 / 2300 = 1/36 / (1/36 + 1/9 + x) Now, let's find a common denominator for the terms in the denominator: 1/36 + 1/9 + x = 1/36 + 4/36 + 36x/36 = (5 + 36x)/36 So the equation becomes: 100 / 2300 = 1/36 / ((5 + 36x)/36) Cross-multiply to solve for x: 100 * ((5 + 36x)/36) = 2300 * (1/36) Simplify: (100 * 5 + 100 * 36x) / 36 = 2300 / 36 500 + 3600x = 2300 Subtract 500 from both sides: 3600x = 1800 Divide by 3600: x = 1800 / 3600 x = 1/2 So, C invested boxed{1/2}  (or half) of the capital for the whole time."},{"instruction":"Does there exist a convex pentagon from which a certain line segments a similar pentagon?","output":"1. **Define the initial pentagon**:     Consider a convex pentagon that has specific angle measures and side lengths.

In this case, let’s assume the proportion is such that the side lengths of the new, smaller pentagon will be half, i.e., the scale factor is frac{1}{2}. 5. **Measure proportions**:    Given the initial side lengths are 2, 4, 8, 6, 12, in the cut-off pentagon with the scale factor frac{1}{2}:    - The side lengths will be frac{2}{2} = 1, frac{4}{2} = 2, frac{8}{2} = 4, frac{6}{2} = 3, frac{12}{2} = 6. 6. **Validation**:    The smaller pentagon retains the same angle measures (since it’s similar) i.e., 60^circ and 120^circ but scaled to the above side lengths.

This is because each switch toggles the state of every lamp in its column. Consequently, the state of any lamp depends only on the parity (odd or even number of presses) of the switch associated with its column. 3. **Layer by Layer Analysis**:    - Consider the complete large cube as composed of 100 layers, each parallel to the red face. This division allows us to analyze the problem layer by layer.    - Pressing a switch on the red face toggles lamps across all 100 layers in a fixed column, while pressing switches on blue or green faces affects lamps within a single layer only. 4. **Finding a Suitable Layer**:    - After Petya’s operations, among the 100 layers, there must be at least one layer with a maximum of d leqslant frac{k}{100} lamps on. Let’s designate this layer as the \\"main layer\\". 5. **Deactivating the Main Layer**:    - Let mathcal{V} represent the set of leqslant frac{k}{100} switches on the red face associated with lamps that are on in the main layer.    - A proof needs to show that using exactly these switches can deactivate all lamps i.e., extinguish the lamps in the main layer. 6. **Simulating the Deactivation Process**:    - **Petya's Switches**: Let mathcal{P} be the set of switches on the red face used by Petya, and mathcal{Q} be the set of switches used by Petya on blue or green faces.    - Vasya: Apply mathcal{P} and mathcal{Q} to obtain the intermediate lamp states post-Petya's operations. 7. **Continuing the Proof**:    - Post Petya’s operations, the main layer still shows d lamps on. By pressing the switches in mathcal{V}, all lamps in the main layer will be turned off.    - For each of the remaining layers, we create corresponding sets analogous to mathcal{Q} and replicate the switch application process on these individual layers. 8. **Completeness of the Process**:    - Applying all these operations (analogous to mathcal{Q} for each layer), Vasya can ensure that all lamps are off. Thus by judiciously toggling the switches exactly related to frac{k}{100} lamps in the crucial layers identified. # Conclusion:     Hence, Vasya can use at most frac{k}{100} switches on the red face to ensure that no lamps are on.

The given equation is:    [    frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} = frac{2}{p}    ] 2. To combine the fractions on the left-hand side, we get:    [    frac{x + y}{xy} = frac{2}{p}    ] 3. By cross-multiplying, we can rewrite the equation as:    [    p(x + y) = 2xy    ] 4.

Since ( y ) is a natural number, the term ( frac{pk}{2k-1} ) must be an integer, which constrains ( 2k - 1 ) to be a divisor of ( p ). Given ( p ) is prime, one possible solution for integer ( k ) is:    [    2k - 1 = p implies k = frac{p + 1}{2}    ] 9.

Substituting this into the expressions we get: - (a^2 + bc = (b-c)^2 + bc = b^2 - 2bc + c^2 + bc = b^2 - bc + c^2), - Similarly, (b^2 + ac = b^2 + (b-c)c = b^2 + bc - c^2), - And (c^2 + ab = c^2 + (b-c)b = c^2 + b^2 - bc). Thus, all these expressions are identical, let's denote them by (x = b^2 - bc + c^2). Now, the sum becomes [ frac{a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2}{x^2}. ] We can use the identity (a = b - c) to express (a^2), (b^2), and (c^2) in terms of (b) and (c): [ a^2 = (b-c)^2 = b^2 - 2bc + c^2, ] [ a^2 b^2 = (b^2 - 2bc + c^2)b^2, ] [ a^2 c^2 = (b^2 - 2bc + c^2)c^2, ] [ b^2 c^2 = b^2 c^2. ] Then, [ a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2 = b^4 - 2b^3c + 3b^2c^2 - 2bc^3 + c^4. ] Now, (x^2 = (b^2 - bc + c^2)^2 = b^4 - 2b^3c + 3b^2c^2 - 2bc^3 + c^4).

The perpendicular projections of ( M ) onto ( AB ) and ( AC ) are ( H ) and ( K ) respectively. We need to prove two parts: a) The perpendicular bisector of ( HK ) always passes through a point independent of ( M ). b) The line from ( M ) perpendicular to ( HK ) also passes through a fixed point.  Part (a) 1. **Identify midpoint of ( BC )**:    Let ( F ) be the midpoint of the base ( BC ). Because ( ABC ) is isosceles, ( AF ) is the altitude from ( A ) to ( BC ), splitting ( angle BAC ) perfectly in half. 2. **Circle on ( AM )**:    Notice that points ( H ), ( K ), and ( F ) lie on the circle with diameter ( AM ). This follows from the fact that the right angles at ( H ) and ( K ) relative to ( M ) imply these points define the semicircle by Thales' theorem. 3. **Angles at ( F )**:    Because ( F ) lies on the semicircle, we can write:    [    angle FKH = angle FAH quad text{and} quad angle FHK = angle FAK.    ]    These equalities stem from the fact that angles subtended by the same arc are equal (property of a circle). 4. **Conclusion**:    Since ( F ) bisects ( angle BAC ), ( angle FAH = angle FAK ). Hence ( FK = FH ), implying that the perpendicular bisector of ( HK ) passes through point ( F ), which is independent of ( M ).  Part (b) 1. **Define reflection**:    Let ( A' ) be the reflection of point ( A ) over line ( BC ). 2. **Thales' circle and midpoint**:    The perpendicular bisector of the chord ( HK ) of the Thales' circle will pass through the center ( G ) of the circle. Where ( G ) lies on ( AF ) and is midpoint of ( AM ). 3. **Angle properties**:    Analogously, by the properties of reflection:    [    angle MA'F = angle MAF = angle GAF.    ]    This suggests that the line ( MA' ) is parallel to ( GF ) and hence perpendicular to ( HK ). 4. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the perpendicular from ( M ) to ( HK ) will intersect at a fixed point ( A' ), which persists regardless of the position of ( M ).

Thus, (b - x_i) are \\"fails\\".    - The number of identical rating pairs from these (x_i) \\"passes\\" is given by ( binom{x_i}{2} ).    - Similarly, for the (b-x_i) \\"fails\\", the number of identical rating pairs is ( binom{b-x_i}{2} ).    - Summing for all participants, we obtain the total number of identical rating pairs:      [      sum_{i=1}^{a} left( binom{x_i}{2} + binom{b - x_i}{2} right).      ] 4. **Applying Symmetry Arguments and Minimization:**    - Since (b) is odd, we can write ( b = 2m + 1 ) where ( m in mathbb{N} ).    - The expression ( sum_{i=1}^{a} left( binom{x_i}{2} + binom{b - x_i}{2} right) ) is minimized when ( x_i ) is as balanced as possible around (frac{b}{2}).    - Hence, we use a symmetric distribution and he coefficient binomial equality:      [      sum_{i=1}^{a} left( binom{x_i}{2} + binom{b - x_i}{2} right) geq a left( binom{m+1}{2} + binom{m}{2} right).      ] 5. **Simplify the Binomial Coefficients:**    - Calculate the binomial coefficients:      [      binom{m+1}{2} = frac{m(m+1)}{2} quad text{and} quad binom{m}{2} = frac{m(m-1)}{2}.      ]    - Summing these yields:      [      binom{m+1}{2} + binom{m}{2} = frac{m(m+1)}{2} + frac{m(m-1)}{2} = frac{m(m+1) + m(m-1)}{2} = frac{m^2 + m + m^2 - m}{2} = m^2.      ]    - Therefore,      [      sum_{i=1}^{a} left( binom{x_i}{2} + binom{b - x_i}{2} right) geq a m^2.      ] 6. **Formulate an Upper Bound Using the Constraints:**    - The total number of identical rating pairs produced by any two judges can be at most ( k ).    - Thus, the total number of identical rating pairs is bounded by:      [      k binom{b}{2}.      ] 7. **Combining Results to Form the Inequality:**    - We equate the lower bound of identical rating pairs to the upper bound.      [      k binom{b}{2} geq a m^2.      ]    - Use the binomial coefficient value:      [      binom{b}{2} = frac{b(b-1)}{2}.      ]    - Substitute and simplify:      [      k frac{b(b-1)}{2} geq a m^2.      ]    - Given ( b = 2m + 1 ), we know ( m = frac{b-1}{2} ).      [      k frac{b(b-1)}{2} geq a left( frac{b-1}{2} right)^2.      ]    - This simplifies to:      [      k frac{b(b-1)}{2} geq a frac{(b-1)^2}{4}.      ]      [      2k b (b-1) geq a (b-1)^2.      ]    - Cancel ( (b-1) ) term:      [      2k b geq a (b-1).      ]    - Finally, rearrange to establish the desired inequality:      [      frac{k}{a} geq frac{b-1}{2b}.      ] Hence, the inequality (frac{k}{a} geq frac{b-1}{2b}) is proven.

Consider the given polynomial equation:    [    x^{2n} + 2x^{2(n-1)} + ldots + n x^2 - p = 0.    ] 2. Since the leading coefficient is 1 and all coefficients are integers, rational roots of the equation must be integers. By the Rational Root Theorem, these integer roots must be divisors of the constant term ( -p ). 3. As ( p ) is a positive prime number, the only possible rational roots are ( pm 1 ) and ( pm p ). 4. Notice that the equation contains only even powers of ( x ). This implies that if ( x = a ) is a root, then ( x = -a ) must also be a root due to the symmetry of the powers. 5. Recall that the product of all roots of a polynomial (neglecting sign) equals the constant term (here ( -p )). To show this:    - Assume ( p ) is a root. Consequently, ( -p ) must also be a root. Then the product of these roots is ( p(-p) = -p^2 ), which cannot be ( -p ).     - Consequently, ( p ) cannot be a root of the polynomial. 6. Since ( p ) is not a root, the only remaining potential roots are ( pm 1 ). However, the equation has multiple roots due to the sum of terms. If the polynomial roots were ( pm 1 ), then the product of the roots (considering ( n ) is greater than 2) would not result in the constant term being ( p ). 7. Thus, given the prime nature of ( p ) with respect to the equation structure, no values of ( p ) and ( n ) meet the conditions that all roots be rational numbers. 8. **Alternate Consideration (Single Rational Root):**        - Rewriting the equation in a form:      [      x^2 left[ x^{2(n-1)} + 2x^{2(n-2)} + ldots + n right] = p,      ]      implies ( frac{p}{x^2} ) is an integer only if ( x = pm 1 ). 9. Consider ( x^2 = 1 ) and substitute into the polynomial:    [    1 + 2 + ldots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}.    ] 10. For ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} = p ) to be a prime number:         - For ( n = 1 ):        [       frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1,       ]       but 1 is not a prime number.     - For ( n = 2 ):       [       frac{2(2+1)}{2} = 3,       ]       and 3 is a prime number. 11. Thus, ( n = 2 ) yields ( p = 3 ), resulting in:     [     x^4 + 2x^2 - 3 = 0.     ] 12. Factorizing the polynomial:     [     left( x^2 - 1 right) left( x^2 + 3 right) = 0,     ]     which gives roots ( x = pm 1 ) (rational) and ( x = pm sqrt{-3} ) (non-real). # Conclusion: No values of ( n ) and ( p ) exist such that all roots of the given polynomial are rational.

The train could arrive anytime between 12:00 (y=0) and 2:00 (y=120) and it leaves 15 minutes after it arrives, so its presence is represented by the line y = x - 15 to y = x + 15, but limited to a maximum of y=120 (2:00 PM) and a minimum of y=0 (12:00 PM). For Alex, who arrives between 1:00 (x=60) and 3:00 PM (x=180), we need to calculate the overlapping area between these lines and Alex's time range. 1. **Triangle from x=60 to x=75:** From x=60 (1:00 PM) to x=75 (1:15 PM), the train's departure time is x-15 to 120.

Let's consider the absolute value inequality |x-1|<1-2x. We need to solve this inequality over two cases due to the definition of absolute value:    - **Case 1**: x-1 geq 0 which implies x geq 1. Within this interval, |x-1|=x-1. The inequality thus becomes x - 1 < 1 - 2x, so 3x < 2 and therefore x < frac{2}{3}. But we must consider the restriction x geq 1, and since frac{2}{3} < 1, there is no solution in this case.    - **Case 2**: x-1 < 0 which implies x < 1. Within this interval, |x-1|=-(x-1). The inequality thus becomes -(x - 1) < 1 - 2x, or x > 0. But since we also have the restriction x < 1, the combined solution for this case is x in (0,1).        Combining the solutions from both cases, we end up with x in (0,1). So, we can write the solution as:    boxed{x in (0,1)} 2. For the inequality |x-1|-|x+1|>x, let's consider three different cases, as the expression involves two absolute values and we will partition the real line based on the thresholds generated by the expressions x-1 and x+1:        - **Case 1**: x geq 1. Here, both |x-1| and |x+1| will lose their absolute value bars without changing signs, so the inequality becomes x - 1 - (x + 1) > x which simplifies to -2 > x, which is not possible as x geq 1 by the current case assumption.    - **Case 2**: -1 leq x < 1. Here, |x-1| will become -(x-1) and |x+1| remains x+1 since x is non-negative but still less than 1. The inequality becomes -(x - 1) - (x + 1) > x. This simplifies to -2x > x, giving us x < 0. Since x must also satisfy -1 leq x < 1, the solution for this case is x in [-1, 0).    - **Case 3**: x < -1. In this case, both |x-1| and |x+1| will become -(x-1) and -(x+1), respectively. Thus the inequality becomes -(x - 1) + (x + 1) > x or 2 > x, which is always true for x < -1. Hence, the solution for this case is x in (-infty, -1).

The vertex of the parabola given by the quadratic function f(x) = -frac{1}{4}(x - 20)^2 + 100 is at (20, 100). Since the parabola opens downwards (the coefficient of x^2 is negative), the vertex is the maximum point. Hence, f(x), and thus lg (10x - frac{x^2}{4}), is maximized when x = 20. Substituting x = 20 into f(x), we get  f(20) = 100.  Since we want to maximize lg (10x - frac{x^2}{4}), the maximum value is when it equals lg 100. We know that lg 100 = 2 since 10^2 = 100.

Was the number 625 selected?","output":":  1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a set of 384 distinct natural numbers chosen from the numbers 1 to 1239 with the condition that the difference between any two chosen numbers is not 4, 5, or 9. We need to determine whether the number 625 is one of these chosen numbers. 2. **Lemma Statement:** Among any sequence of 13 consecutive natural numbers, we can select no more than four numbers such that no two of them differ by 4, 5, or 9. 3. **Proof of Lemma:**    - Consider a sequence of 13 consecutive numbers: ( a, a+1, a+2, ldots, a+12 ).    - We can group these 13 numbers into 9 groups as follows:       [      {a+4}, {a, a+9}, {a+5}, {a+1, a+10}, {a+6}, {a+2, a+11}, {a+7}, {a+3, a+12}, {a+8}      ]    - Each group can have at most 2 elements. To ensure that no two numbers in a group differ by 4, 5, or 9, at most one number can be chosen from each group, provided the adjacent groups do not contribute numbers that violate the conditions.    - If we choose at least five numbers, at least two of them must come from the same or adjacent groups, contrary to the condition. Therefore, the lemma is proved as it is only possible to choose at most four numbers in such a sequence to meet the stipulated condition. 4. **Partitioning the Range:**    - Consider the numbers from 1 to 1239. We first isolate the four numbers: 625, 626, 627, and 628.     - This leaves us with 1235 remaining numbers (1239 - 4).    - We now partition these 1235 numbers into groups of 13 consecutive numbers each, making it 95 groups (since ( frac{1235}{13} = 95 ) exactly). 5. **Applying the Lemma:**    - From our lemma, in each group of 13 consecutive numbers, no more than 4 numbers can be chosen that respect the given condition.    - Hence, in 95 such groups, we can select up to ( 95 times 4 = 380 ) numbers that satisfy the condition.  6. **Conclusion:**    - We need 384 numbers. We already selected up to 380 without considering 625, 626, 627, and 628.    - Therefore, we must include the isolated four numbers (625, 626, 627, 628) to bridge the gap, validating that indeed, 625 must be one of the numbers chosen to satisfy the complete set of 384 numbers. Thus, the number 625 must be one of the chosen numbers to meet all given conditions. (boxed{text{Yes}})"},{"instruction":"23 seats are available in a line.

This grouping can be visualized as:        (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9), (10, 11, 12), (13, 14, 15), (16, 17, 18), (19, 20, 21), (22, 23).         2. **Seating Constraint for Singles**:    - Never seat a single customer in the center of any group of three. That is, in each triplet (like \`(1, 2, 3)\`), singles can only sit in positions 1 or 3, but not in position 2.     3. **Arriving Single Customer**:    - If a single customer arrives and all seats are not already occupied:      - We first count the available seats: since each non-central seat can contain a single customer and there are 16 such seats (since each of the 7 triplets provides 2 non-central seats and there is one pair), if there are fewer than 16 customers, there must be at least one non-central seat available.     4. **Arriving Pair of Customers**:    - When a pair arrives, they need two adjacent seats.    - Consider the current scenario:      - If there are already 14 customers present, this implies we have potentially 7 groups that could each be partially filled:        - If any of the groups \`(x, y, z)\` has its two seats occupied in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or remains empty (which will be unlikely for 14):          - There must be an empty adjacent pair of any of these groups.          - If no such available pair, specifically, groups \`(22, 23)\` must be empty for at least one pair seat availability. 5. **Prevention of Blocking**:    - Ensure no blockage occurs by preventing a split of paired arrivals when 16 customers are present; guaranteeing a system where groups handle both indivisible reaches the goal pairwise accommodating every arrival without the empty middle of any trip. # Conclusion: By ensuring such a seating arrangement and rules for single vs. pair seatings, pairs of customers will always have adjacent seats available without requiring any existing customer to move. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"The average weight of a class of 20 boys was calculated to be a certain value, and it was later found that one weight was misread as 56 kg instead of 65 kg.

The statement trivially holds because there are no edges to define a traversal.    2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**     - Assume the statement holds for all connected graphs with (n) vertices. That is, in any connected directed graph with (n) vertices where the in-degree equals the out-degree for each vertex, it is possible to travel from any vertex to any other vertex following the arrows.    3. **Inductive Step:**     - Consider a connected graph with (n+1) vertices. We need to show that the property holds for this graph as well.     - Remove an arbitrary vertex (v) from the graph, along with all edges incident to (v). As each removal of a vertex does not affect the in-degree or out-degree balance of the remaining (n) vertices (because we remove an equal number of incoming and outgoing edges), the remaining graph (with (n) vertices) still satisfies the in-degree equals out-degree condition.     - By the inductive hypothesis, since the remaining graph with (n) vertices is still connected (removal of a vertex in a connected graph leaves a graph where each connected component of the remaining vertices remains connected) and retains the in-degree-out-degree balance, there exists a directed cycle or path connecting all the vertices.     - Now, consider the removed vertex (v) and its edges. By reintroducing (v) and its edges back into the graph, where each edge either points towards or from (v), we can reconnect (v) to the directed cycles or paths present in the remaining (n)-vertex graph. Thus, (v) will be reachable from any vertex and any vertex will be reachable from (v). 4. **Conclusion:**     - By the principle of mathematical induction, we have proven that in any connected directed graph where the number of incoming edges equals the number of outgoing edges for each vertex, it is possible to travel from any vertex to any other vertex following the arrows, for any number of vertices.

Relationship between vectors**:    - Because of the parallelism in the projection, we have:      [      frac{overrightarrow{A_{1} M'}}{overrightarrow{A_{2} N'}} = frac{overrightarrow{A_{1} A_{3}}}{overrightarrow{A_{2} A_{3}}} = lambda      ]      for some constant (lambda).    - Therefore, we can write:      [      overrightarrow{A_{1} M'} = t mathbf{a} quad text{and} quad overrightarrow{A_{2} N'} = t mathbf{b}      ]      where ( t ) is some scalar. **4. Midpoints and conclusion**:    - Let ( O ) and ( X ) be the midpoints of segments ( A_{1}A_{2} ) and ( MN ) respectively.    - Then,      [      2 overrightarrow{OX} = overrightarrow{A_{1} M'} + overrightarrow{A_{2} N'} = t (mathbf{a} + mathbf{b})      ]    - This equation implies that the vector ( overrightarrow{OX} ) is parallel to a fixed vector sum ( mathbf{a} + mathbf{b} ). Therefore, the locus of the midpoint ( X ) of the segment ( MN ) lies on a straight line defined by maintaining proportional vectors ( mathbf{a} + mathbf{b} ), indicating that all such points ( X ) form a line.

Then a corner is removed. Which of the following could be the paper after it is unfolded?","output":"1. **Understanding the problem and the folding process**:     - We start with a square piece of paper.     - The paper is folded in half four times.     - Folding in half each time doubles the number of layers of paper. 2. **Calculating the number of layers of paper after folding**:     - Initially, the paper is a single layer.     - After the first fold, the paper has (2) layers.     - After the second fold, (2 times 2 = 4) layers.     - After the third fold, (4 times 2 = 8) layers.     - After the fourth fold, (8 times 2 = 16) layers.     Thus, after four folds, there are (16) layers. 3. **Removing a corner and understanding the effect**:     - When a corner is removed from the folded paper, it is removed from all (16) layers simultaneously.     - Each removal cuts out a quarter-circle from each layer. 4. **Determining the total area of the removed sections**:     - Since we have (16) layers, and each removal cuts out a quarter-circle from each layer, we have (16) quarter-circles removed in total.     - Combining (4) quarter-circles form a complete circle.     - Therefore, (16) quarter-circles can form (4) complete circles. 5. **Unfolding the paper and visualizing the pattern**:     - Upon unfolding the paper, these removed quarter-circles will be spread out at the locations where the corners were initially removed.     - Given that four complete circles result from the removed sections, we look for an unfolded paper pattern that matches this description. 6. **Identifying the correct option**:     - From the options provided, option ( mathrm{D} ) matches our expected description.

It is a basic question. We need to find the solution sets of both \\"left( frac{1}{3} right)^{x} < 1\\" and \\"frac{1}{x} > 1\\" and determine their relationship to make a judgment. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. Solve the inequality \\"left( frac{1}{3} right)^{x} < 1\\": Since frac{1}{3} is a fraction between 0 and 1, its power x must be greater than 0 to make the inequality hold. Thus, the solution set is x > 0. 2. Solve the inequality \\"frac{1}{x} > 1\\": Multiplying both sides by x (and considering the sign change when x is negative), we have 1 < x. Additionally, since the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero, we have x neq 0. Combining these results, the solution set is 0 < x < 1. 3. Compare the relationship between the two solution sets: We can see that every x that satisfies \\"0 < x < 1\\" also satisfies \\"x > 0\\", but not vice versa.

The left side of the equation, frac{5000}{x}, represents the total cost of soccer balls divided by the price per soccer ball, which gives us the number of soccer balls purchased. 2. The right side of the equation, 2 times frac{4000}{30 + x}, represents twice the total cost of basketballs divided by the price per basketball. Since the price of a basketball is 30 yuan more than a soccer ball, the price of a basketball is represented as (30 + x) yuan. Given the context: - The equation is set up based on the total cost spent on each type of ball and their respective prices. - The factor of 2 on the right side accounts for the fact that the number of soccer balls is twice the number of basketballs. - The variable x is used to represent the price of a soccer ball, as it directly divides the total cost of soccer balls (5000 yuan) to yield the number of soccer balls.

Find the largest possible value of the expression   frac {S(n)}{S(16n)} .","output":"1. We start by noting that ( S(n) ) denotes the sum of the digits of ( n ). We need to find the largest possible value of the expression ( frac{S(n)}{S(16n)} ). 2. Observe that ( S(10^k n) = S(n) ) for any integer ( k ). This is because multiplying ( n ) by ( 10^k ) simply appends ( k ) zeros to the end of ( n ), which does not change the sum of its digits. Therefore, we can write:    [    frac{S(n)}{S(16n)} = frac{S(10^4 n)}{S(16n)}    ]    This implies that we can assume ( n ) is divisible by ( 625 ) (since ( 10^4 = 10000 ) and ( 10000 = 16 times 625 )). 3. Let ( n = 625k ). Then we have:    [    frac{S(n)}{S(16n)} = frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)}    ]    Since ( 10000 = 16 times 625 ), we can rewrite the expression as:    [    frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)} = frac{S(625k)}{S(16 times 625k)} = frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)}    ] 4. Now, consider the case when ( k = 1 ).

To ensure that this is the maximum value, we need to show that ( frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)} leq 13 ) for any positive integer ( k ). Notice that ( S(a cdot b) leq S(a) cdot S(b) ) for any integers ( a ) and ( b ). This is because the sum of the digits of a product is generally less than or equal to the product of the sums of the digits of the factors. 6. Applying this to our case:    [    S(625k) leq S(625) cdot S(k) = 13 cdot S(k)    ]    and:    [    S(10000k) = S(16 cdot 625k) geq S(16) cdot S(625k) = 7 cdot S(625k)    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{S(625k)}{S(10000k)} leq frac{S(625k)}{7 cdot S(625k)} = frac{1}{7}    ]    This shows that the maximum value of ( frac{S(n)}{S(16n)} ) is indeed ( 13 ).

Now, let:    [    I = frac{(a + b - c)^2 + 2c(a + c - b)}{2c(a + b - c)} = frac{a+b-c}{2c} + frac{a+c-b}{a+b-c}    ]    Where we need to consider the condition (a geq frac{1}{3}(b+c)). Using this condition, we derive:    [    a geq frac{1}{4}(a+b-c) + frac{c}{2}    ]    Thus,     [    a+c-b = 2a - (a+b-c) geq -frac{1}{2}(a+b-c) + c    ] 4. Using the above result, the expression for (I) is bounded by:    [    I geq frac{a + b - c}{2c} - frac{frac{1}{2}(a+b-c)}{a+b-c} + frac{c}{a+b-c}    ]    Simplifying this, we get:    [    I geq -frac{1}{2} + frac{a + b - c}{2c} + frac{c}{a + b - c}    ]    We know from the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality that:    [    frac{a + b - c}{2c} + frac{c}{a + b - c} geq 2 sqrt{frac{a + b - c}{2c} cdot frac{c}{a + b - c}} = sqrt{2}    ]    Thus:    [    I geq sqrt{2} - frac{1}{2}    ] 5. Next, we analyze the value of lambda:    [    frac{a c + b c - c^2}{a^2 + b^2 + 3 c^2 + 2 ab - 4 bc} = frac{1}{2I} leq frac{1}{2 left(sqrt{2} - frac{1}{2}right)} = frac{1}{2 sqrt{2} - 1}    ]    Simplifying the right hand term:    [    frac{1}{2 sqrt{2} - 1} = frac{2 sqrt{2} + 1}{7}    ]    Hence:    [    lambda leq frac{2 sqrt{2} + 1}{7}    ] 6. To verify that frac{2 sqrt{2} + 1}{7} is indeed feasible, we check with the specific values:    [    a = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} + frac{1}{2}, quad b = frac{3 sqrt{2}}{4} + frac{1}{2}, quad c = 1    ]    Then,    [    a c + b c - c^2 = sqrt{2}    ]    And:    [    a^2 + b^2 + 3c^2 + 2ab - 4bc = 4 - sqrt{2}    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{1}{2I} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4 - sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2} (4 + sqrt{2})}{14} = frac{2 sqrt{2} + 1}{7}    ] 7.

When a diagonal bisects the angles in a parallelogram, it implies certain geometric configurations. The key observation here is the relationship between the side lengths and the angles. 5. Initially, it is useful to realize that the parallelogram can be divided into two congruent triangles by its diagonal which bisects one of its interior angles. 6. Since (BD) bisects the angles at (A) and (C), and divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles, we can focus on one of those triangles.

This problem examines the extremum of trigonometric functions, with the key and challenging part being the analysis that sin α > sin (2π-β), testing reasoning and computational skills, and is considered difficult."},{"instruction":"A group of men decided to do a work in 15 days. Some of them became absent, and the rest of the group did the work in 18 days. The original number of men was 48. How many men became absent?","output":"Let's assume that the number of men who became absent is x. The original group of 48 men planned to complete the work in 15 days. This means that the total amount of work can be represented as 48 men * 15 days = 720 man-days (since work is equal to the number of workers multiplied by the number of days). When some men became absent, the remaining men (48 - x) completed the work in 18 days. This means that the total amount of work done by the remaining men is (48 - x) men * 18 days. Since the total amount of work remains the same, we can set up the equation: 48 men * 15 days = (48 - x) men * 18 days 720 man-days = (48 - x) * 18 Now, we can solve for x: 720 = 864 - 18x To find the value of x, we'll move 864 to the other side of the equation: 720 - 864 = -18x -144 = -18x Now, divide both sides by -18 to solve for x: x = -144 / -18 x = 8 So, boxed{8}  men became absent."},{"instruction":"A product is classified into three grades: first, second, and third, where only the first grade is considered a genuine product.

The total number of songs they both listened to in that month is 396. How many fewer songs does Clara play each day compared to Vivian?","output":"Let's first calculate the number of days in June that Vivian and Clara played songs. Since they didn't play any songs during the weekends, and there were 8 weekend days, we subtract those from the total days in June. June has 30 days, so the number of days they played songs is: 30 days (total in June) - 8 days (weekend days) = 22 days (days they played songs) Now, let's calculate the total number of songs Vivian played in June. Since she plays 10 songs every day, the total number of songs she played is: 10 songs/day * 22 days = 220 songs Now we know the total number of songs both Vivian and Clara played together in June is 396 songs. To find out how many songs Clara played, we subtract the number of songs Vivian played from the total: 396 songs (total) - 220 songs (Vivian's songs) = 176 songs (Clara's songs) To find out how many fewer songs Clara plays each day compared to Vivian, we first need to calculate the average number of songs Clara plays each day: 176 songs (Clara's total) / 22 days = 8 songs/day Now we can see that Clara plays 8 songs each day, which is boxed{2}  songs fewer than Vivian's 10 songs each day. Therefore, Clara plays 2 fewer songs each day compared to Vivian."},{"instruction":"A principal amount of Rs. 8000 is invested at compound interest at the ratio of 5% p.a.

Plugging in the values we have: 10210.25 = 8000 (1 + 0.05/1)^(1*t) Now, we simplify and solve for t: 10210.25 = 8000 (1 + 0.05)^t 10210.25 = 8000 (1.05)^t Divide both sides by 8000 to isolate (1.05)^t: 10210.25 / 8000 = (1.05)^t 1.27628125 = (1.05)^t Now, we take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides to solve for t: ln(1.27628125) = ln((1.05)^t) Using the property of logarithms that ln(a^b) = b*ln(a), we get: ln(1.27628125) = t * ln(1.05) Now, divide both sides by ln(1.05) to solve for t: t = ln(1.27628125) / ln(1.05) Now, we can calculate the value of t using a calculator: t ≈ ln(1.27628125) / ln(1.05) t ≈ 0.242792 / 0.048790 t ≈ 4.975 Since the number of years must be a whole number, we round t to the nearest whole number, which is 5 years.

How many pieces of mail did Vivian send in August?","output":"In July, Vivian sent 40 pieces of mail.  In August, on business days, she sent double the amount she sent in July, so on each business day, she sent 2 * 40 = 80 pieces of mail. Since there were 23 business days in August, the total amount of mail she sent on business days was 23 * 80 = 1840 pieces of mail. On holidays, she sent half the amount she sent in July, so on each holiday, she sent 40 / 2 = 20 pieces of mail. Since there were 8 holidays in August, the total amount of mail she sent on holidays was 8 * 20 = 160 pieces of mail. Therefore, the total amount of mail Vivian sent in August was the sum of the mail sent on business days and holidays, which is 1840 + 160 = boxed{2000}  pieces of mail."},{"instruction":"Let a, b, c, d be real numbers such that [a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = 8.] Find the maximum value of a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4.","output":"From the equation a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = 8, it follows that a^3 leq 8, so sqrt[3]{a^3} leq sqrt[3]{8} = 2. Thus, -2 leq a leq 2. Applying this bound to all variables, -2 leq b, c, d leq 2. By squaring, a^2 leq 2^2 = 4. Therefore, a^4 = (a^2)^2 leq 4^2 = 16. Similarly, b^4, c^4, d^4 leq 16. Hence, a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 leq 16+16+16+16 = 64. To achieve equality, if a = 2, b = c = d = 0, then: - a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = 2^3 + 0^3 + 0^3 + 0^3 = 8 which matches our primary constraint, - a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 2^4 + 0^4 + 0^4 + 0^4 = 16. However, to maximize a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4, select a = b = sqrt[3]{2}, c = d = 0: - a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = (sqrt[3]{2})^3 + (sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 2 + 2 = 4—fails to match our initial sum.

According to the problem, removing 13 oranges from the bowl will make the number of apples equal to 50% of the total pieces of fruit in the bowl. This means that after removing 13 oranges, the number of oranges left in the bowl will be 23 - 13 = 10 oranges. At this point, the total number of pieces of fruit in the bowl will be A (apples) + 10 (oranges). Since we want the apples to be 50% of the total, we can set up the following equation: A = 0.5 * (A + 10) Now, let's solve for A: A = 0.5A + 5 A - 0.5A = 5 0.5A = 5 A = 5 / 0.5 A = 10 So, there are boxed{10}  apples in the bowl."},{"instruction":"The height of a rectangular parallelepiped with a volume of 49 square centimeters (cm2) is 7 centimeters (cm).

The condition that must be satisfied is that the sum of any two selected numbers is not congruent to (0 pmod{n}).

Recognize that the base of the logarithm implies the following equation:    [    log_{4} left(x^2 - 4y^2 right) = log_{4}(4)    ] 5. Therefore, we have:    [    x^2 - 4y^2 = 4    ] 6.

Joe has 3 caramel-flavored candies and 4 lemon-flavored candies, making a total of 3 + 4 = 7 candies. The probability of picking a caramel-flavored candy is the number of caramel candies (3) divided by the total number of candies (7). So, the probability P(caramel) is: P(caramel) = Number of caramel candies / Total number of candies P(caramel) = 3 / 7 Therefore, the probability that Joe picks a caramel-flavored candy is boxed{3/7} ."},{"instruction":"A natural number can be expressed as the sum of 5 consecutive natural numbers and can also be expressed as the sum of 7 consecutive natural numbers. List the first three such numbers in ascending order.","output":"To solve this problem, we will use the concept related to the middle term of an arithmetic sequence. Specifically, we will consider the properties of an arithmetic sequence with an odd number of terms. 1. **Middle Term Theorem:**    For any arithmetic sequence with an odd number of terms, the value of the middle term equals the average of all terms in the sequence, which is also ( frac{text{sum of the first and last term}}{2} ). Hence, the total sum of the sequence is the middle term multiplied by the number of terms. 2. **Formulating the Problem:**    The problem states that a number can be expressed as the sum of 5 consecutive natural numbers and also as the sum of 7 consecutive natural numbers. We denote this number as (N). 3. **Sum of 5 Consecutive Natural Numbers:**    Let the 5 consecutive numbers be (a-2, a-1, a, a+1, a+2).    The sum is then:    [    (a-2) + (a-1) + a + (a+1) + (a+2) = 5a    ]    So, any such number (N) can be written as (N = 5a). 4. **Sum of 7 Consecutive Natural Numbers:**    Let the 7 consecutive numbers be (b-3, b-2, b-1, b, b+1, b+2, b+3).    The sum is then:    [    (b-3) + (b-2) + (b-1) + b + (b+1) + (b+2) + (b+3) = 7b    ]    So, any such number (N) can be written as (N = 7b). 5. **Common Multiple:**    Since (N) can be expressed as both (5a) and (7b), (N) must be a common multiple of 5 and 7. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 7 is:    [    text{LCM}(5, 7) = 5 times 7 = 35    ] 6. **Possible Numbers:**    Therefore, the possible numbers are the multiples of 35. Listing these multiples from smallest to largest, we get:     [    35, 70, 105, 140, ldots     ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The first three numbers that meet the criteria and are organized from smallest to largest are:    [    35, 70, 105    ] Thus, the first three smallest numbers are: [ boxed{35, 70, 105} ]"},{"instruction":"Evaluate |(7  4i)(3 + 10i)|.","output":"First, we calculate the magnitude of each complex number: 1.

CHAPTER—1 HOW I CAME TO TAP THE POWER OF BELIEF Is There some force, or factor, or power, or science – call it what you will – which a few people understand and use to overcome their difficulties and achieve outstanding success? I firmly believe that there is, and it is my purpose in this book to try to explain it so that you can use it if you desire. Around 1933, the financial editor of a great Los Angeles newspaper attended lectures I gave to financial men in that city and read my brochure T.N.T. – It Rocks the Earth. Afterwards, he wrote the following: “You have caught from the ether something that has a mystical quality – a something that explains the magic of coincidence, the mystery of what makes men lucky.” I realized that I had run across something that was practical and workable. But I didn’t consider it then – neither do I now – as anything “mystical,” except in the sense that it is unknown to the majority of people. This “something” has always been known to a fortunate few down the centuries, but for some unknown reason it is still barely understood by the average person. Years ago, when I started to teach this science by means of lectures and the medium of my brochure, I wasn’t certain that the concepts could be grasped by the ordinary individual. But since then, I have seen those who have used it to double and triple their incomes, build their own successful businesses, acquire homes of their dreams, and create sizable fortunes. I am now convinced that any intelligent person who is sincere with themselves can reach any heights they truly and honestly desire. I had no intention of writing a second book, although many urged me to do so, until a woman in the book business who had sold many copies of my first little book literally read me “the riot act” by stating: “You have a duty to give to the men and women who seek places for themselves in the world, in easily understood form, the new material that you have given in your lectures. Everyone of ambition wants to get ahead, and you have amply demonstrated that you have something that will help anyone. It’s up to you to pass it along.” It took time to sell myself on the idea. But having served as a soldier in World War I, mostly in France and Germany, and having been active for many years in ex-service men’s organizations as well as a state commission for the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women, I realized that it would be hard for many individuals to make outstanding places for themselves in a world from which they had long been separated. It is with a sincere desire to help them, as well as all ambitious men and women, that I write this more full and detailed exposition of the Power of Belief. Thus, this work is written also to help develop individual thinking and doing. Since this book may fall into the hands of some who may call me a crackpot or screwball, let me say that I am past the half-century mark and have had many years of hard practical business experience – as well as a goodly number of years as a newspaper man. I started as a police reporter. Police reporters are trained to get facts and take nothing for granted. For a two year period I was church editor of a large metropolitan newspaper, during which I came in close contact with clergymen and leaders of all sects and denominations, mind-healers, divine healers, Spiritualists, Christian Scientists, New Thoughters, Unity leaders, sun and idol worshipers – and, yes, even a few infidels and pagans. The well-known English evangelist Gypsy Smith was making a tour of America at that time. Night after night as I sat on his platform, watching people stumble down the aisles, some sobbing, others shouting hysterically, I wondered. Again I wondered when I accompanied the police in answering a riot call: some Holy Rollers in a moment of hysteria had knocked over a stove and set fire to their meeting hall. When I attended my first (and only) meeting of Shakers, I wondered – as I did while attending various spiritualistic meetings. I wondered as I heard the testimonials at the Christian Scientists’ Wednesday night meetings. I wondered when I watched a group of people immersed in the icy waters of a mountain stream and coming up shouting “Hallelujah!” even though their teeth were chattering. I wondered at the Indians’ ceremonial dances and their rain- dance rituals. Billy Sunday also caused me to wonder as, in later years, did Aimee Semple McPherson. In France during the First World War, I marveled at the simple faith of the peasants and the powers of their village curees. I heard stories of miracles at Lourdes, and of somewhat similar miracles at other shrines. When in a famous old Roman church, I saw elderly men and women climb literally on their knees up a long flight of stairs to gaze upon a holy urn – a climb that is no simple task for an athletically trained young person – I wondered again. Business brought me into contact with the Mormons, and when I heard the story of Joseph Smith and the revelations on the plates of gold, I was again given to wonder. The Dukhobors of western Canada, who would doff their clothes when provoked, likewise made me wonder. While in Hawaii I heard much about the powers of the kahunas who could, it was claimed, cause people to die or live by praying. The great powers attributed to these kahunas profoundly impressed me. In my early days as a newspaper man, I saw a famous medium try to make “spirits” respond before a crowded courtroom of antagonistic scoffers. The judge had promised to release the medium if he could get the “spirits” to speak in the courtroom. Yet they failed to materialize, and I wondered why – because the medium’s followers had testified to remarkable séances. Many years later, I was commissioned to write a series of articles on what the police call the “fortune-telling racket.” I visited everyone from gypsy phrenologists to crystal-ball gazers, from astrologers to spiritualistic mediums. I heard what purported to be the voices of old Indian “guides” tell me the past, the present, and the future, and I heard from relatives I never knew existed. Several times I have been in a hospital room in which people around me died, while others with seemingly worse ailments were up and – apparently – fully recovered within a short time I have known of partially paralyzed people who got over their condition in a matter of days. I have known people who claim to have cured their rheumatism or arthritis by wearing a copper band around their wrists – others by mental healing. From relatives and close friends I have heard stories of how warts on hands suddenly disappeared. I am familiar with the stories of those who permit rattlesnakes to bite them and still live; and with hundreds of other tales of mysterious happenings and healings. Moreover, I have made myself familiar with the lives of great men and women of history and have met and interviewed many outstanding men and women in all lines of human endeavor. Often I have wondered just what it was that took them to the top. I have seen coaches take seemingly inferior baseball and football teams and infuse them with something that caused them to win. In the Depression days, I saw badly whipped sales organizations do an abrupt about-face and bring in more business man ever before. Apparently I was born with a huge bump of curiosity, for I have always had an insatiable yearning to seek answers and explanations. This quest has taken me to many strange places, brought to light many peculiar cases, and caused me to read every book I could get my hands on dealing with religions, cults, and physical and mental sciences. I have read literally thousands of books on modern psychology, metaphysics, ancient magic, Voodoo, Yoga, Theosophy, Christian Science, Unity, Truth, New Thought, Coueism, and many others dealing with what I call “Mind Stuff,” as well as the philosophies and teachings of great masters of the past. Many were nonsensical, others strange, and many very profound Gradually I discovered that a golden thread runs through all the teachings and makes them work for those who sincerely accept and apply them, and that thread can be named in the single word – belief. It is this same element or factor – belief – that causes people to be cured through mental healing, enables others to climb high the ladder of success, and gets phenomenal results for all who accept it. Why belief works miracles is something that cannot be satisfactorily explained; but have no doubt that there’s genuine magic in believing. “The magic of believing” became a phrase around which my thoughts steadily revolved. I am convinced that the so-called secret fraternal organizations guard a real “royal secret” which very few members ever grasp. The conclusion must be that “no mind ever receives the truth until it is prepared to receive it.” One order provides candidates with a very profound book (to be studied in connection with the degree work), which itself would be practically an open-sesame to life if the candidates could understand and follow its tenets. But few read it, complaining that “it is too deep” for them. I am convinced, too, that some of these organizations, like many secret orders which possess a knowledge and understanding of life, use parables and misinterpretations to mislead. When T.N.T. – It Rocks the Earth was first published, I imagined that it would be easily understood since I had written it simply. But as the years went by, some readers protested that it was too much in digest form. Others said they couldn’t understand it. I had assumed that most people knew something about the power of thought. Now I realize that I was mistaken, and those who had an understanding of the subject were comparatively few. Later, over many years of lecturing before clubs, business and sales organizations, I discovered that most people were vitally interested in the subject, but that it had to be fully explained. Finally, I undertook to write this book in words that anyone can understand – and with the hope that it will help many to reach their goals in life. The science of thought is as old as man himself. The wise men of all ages have known it and used it. The only thing I have done is to put the subject in modern language and bring to the reader’s attention what some of today’s outstanding minds are doing to substantiate the great truths that have come down through the centuries. Fortunately for the world, people are coming to the realization that there is something to this “mind-stuff” after all. I believe that millions of people would like to get a better understanding of it – and prove that it does work. Therefore, let me start by relating a few experiences from my own life, with the hope that they will give you a better understanding of the entire science. Early in 1918, I landed in France as a “casual” soldier, unattached to a regular company. As a result, it was several weeks before my service record (necessary for my pay) caught up with me. During that period I had no money to buy gum, candy, cigarettes, and the like, since the few dollars I had before sailing had been spent at the transport ship’s canteen to relieve the monotony of the regular menu. Every time I saw a man light a cigarette or chew a stick of gum, it reminded me that I was without money to spend on myself. Certainly, I was eating, and the army clothed me and provided me with a place on the ground to sleep, but I grew bitter at having no spending money and no way of getting any. One night enroute to the forward area on a crowded troop train when sleep was out of the question, I made up my mind that on my return to civilian life, I would have a lot of money. The whole pattern of my life was altered at that moment. True, I had been something of a reader in my youth; the Bible had been a must in our family. As a boy I was interested in wireless telegraphy. X- rays, high-frequency apparatus, and similar manifestations of electricity, and I had read every book on these subjects I could find. But while I was familiar with such terms as radiation frequencies, vibrations, oscillations, magnetic influences, etc., in those days they meant nothing to me outside of the strictly electrical field. Perhaps my first inkling of a connection between the mind and electrical or vibratory influences came when upon my completing law school, an instructor gave me an old book, Thomson Jay Hudson’s Law of Psychic Phenomena. I read it, but only superficially. Either I did not understand it, or my mind was not ready to receive its profound truths. On that fateful night in the spring of 1918, when I told myself that some day I would have a lot of money, I did not realize that I was laying the groundwork for a series of causes which would unleash forces that would bring accomplishment. As a matter of fact, the idea never entered my mind that I could develop a fortune with my thinking and believing. My Army classification card listed me as a newspaper man I had been attending an Army Training School to qualify for a commission, but the whole training-school program was discontinued just as we finished the course; thus most of us landed in France as enlisted men. However, I considered myself a qualified journalist and felt that there was a better place for me in the American Expeditionary Force. Yet like many others, I found myself pushing wheelbarrows and lugging heavy shells and other ammunition. Then one night at an ammunition depot near Toul, things began to happen. I was ordered to appear before the Commanding Officer, who asked me whom I knew at First Army Headquarters. I didn’t know a soul there and didn’t even know where it was located, and I told him so. Then he showed me orders directing me to report there immediately. A car and driver were provided, and the next morning found me at First Army Headquarters in charge of a daily progress bulletin. I was answerable only to a colonel. During the months that followed, I frequently thought about the commission to which I was entitled. Then the links began to form into a chain. One day, entirely out of a clear sky, came orders transferring me to the Stars and Stripes, the Army newspaper; I had long had an ambition to be on its staff, but had done nothing about it. The next day, as I was preparing to leave for Paris, I was called before the colonel who showed me a telegram signed by the Adjutant General’s office at GHQ, asking if I was available for commission. The colonel asked whether I would rather have a commission than report to the Army newspaper. Foreseeing that the war would soon end and I would be happier among other newspaper men, I said I would prefer the transfer to the Stars and Stripes. I never learned who was responsible for the telegram, but obviously something was working in my behalf. Following the armistice, my desire to get out of the Army became insistent. I wanted to begin building that fortune. But the Stars and Stripes did not suspend publication until the summer of 1919, and it was August before I got home. However, the forces I had unconsciously set in motion were already setting the stage for me. About nine-thirty the next morning after my arrival home, I received a telephone call from the president of a club in which I had been active. He told me to call a prominent man in the investment banking business who had read about my return and had expressed a wish to see me before I resumed newspaper work. I called the man and, two days later, embarked upon a long career as an investment banker, which later led me to the vice- presidency of a well-known Pacific Coast firm. While my salary was smart at the start, I realized that I was in a business where there were many opportunities to make money. Just how I was to make it was then not revealed, but I just knew that I would have that fortune I had in mind In less than ten years, I did have it, and not only was it sizable, but I was a substantial stockholder in the company and had several outside profitable interests. During those years I had constantly before me a mental picture of wealth. Many people in moments of abstraction or while talking on the telephone engage in doodling – drawing or sketching odd designs and patterns upon paper. My doodling was in the form of dollar signs like these – – – – – on every paper that came across my desk. The cardboard covers of all the files placed before me daily were scrawled with these markings, as were the covers of telephone directories, scratch-pads, and even the face of important correspondence. I want my readers to remember this detail, because it suggests the mechanics to be used in applying this magic which I’ll explain in detail later. During the past years, I have found that by far the greatest problems bothering most people are financial ones. With today’s intense competition, millions are facing the same kinds of problems. However, it matters little to what ends this science is used. It will be effective in achieving the object of your desire – and in this connection, let me tell another experience. Shortly after the idea of T.N.T. – It Rocks the Earth came to me but before I put it on paper, I took a trip to the Orient and sailed on the Empress of Japan, noted for its excellent cuisine. In my travels through Canada and in Europe I had developed a fondness for Trappist cheese made by the Trappist monks of Quebec. When I couldn’t find it on the ship’s menu, I laughingly complained to the chief steward that I had sailed on his ship only to get some of the famous “Trappist” cheese. He replied that he was sorry, but there was none aboard. The more I thought about it, the more I hungered for some of that cheese. One night a ship’s party was held. Upon returning to my cabin quarters after midnight, I found a big table had been set up in one of the rooms. On it was the largest cheese I had ever seen. It was “Trappist” cheese. Later I asked the chief steward where he found it. “I was certain we had none aboard when you first mentioned it,” he answered, “but you seemed so set on having some, I made up my mind to search through all the ship’s stores. We found it in the emergency storeroom in the bottom of the hold.” Something was working for me on that trip, too, for I had no claim to anything but ordinary service. However, I sat at the executive officer’s table and was frequently his personal guest in his quarters, as well as on inspection trips through the ship. Naturally the treatment I received made a great impression on me, and in Honolulu, I often thought how nice it would be to receive comparable attention on my journey home on another ship. One afternoon I got the sudden impulse to leave for the mainland. It was about closing time when I appeared at the ticket agency to ask what reservations I could get. A ship was leaving the next day at noon, and I purchased the only remaining cabin ticket. The next day, just a few minutes before noon, as I started up the gangplank, I said to myself in an offhand manner, “They treated you as a king on the Empress of Japan. The least you can do here is to sit at the captain’s table. Sure, you’ll sit at the captain’s table.” The ship got under way. As we steamed out of the harbor, the dining- room steward asked passengers to appear in the dining room for assignment to tables. When I came before him, about half the assignments had been made. He asked for my ticket, glanced at it and then at me, saying, “Oh yes, table A, seat No. 5.” It was the captain’s table, and I was seated directly across from him. Aboard that ship, many things happened which pertain to the subject of this book, the most prominent being a party supposed to be in honor of my birthday – just an idea of the captain’s, because my birthday was actually months away. Later, when I found myself lecturing, I thought it would be wise to get a letter from the captain substantiating the story and I wrote him. He replied, “Sometimes as we go through life, instinctively we get the idea to do this or that. That noon I was sitting in the doorway of my cabin watching the passengers come up the gangplank, and as you came aboard, something told me to seat you at my table. Beyond that I cannot explain, any more than I can explain how I can frequently stop my ship at the right spot at the pier at the first try.” People who have heard the story – and who know nothing about the magic of believing – have declared that it was mere coincidence that the captain selected me. I am positive it wasn’t, and I’m also certain that this captain (who knows quite a bit about this science) will agree with me. Aboard that ship were dozens of people far more important than I could ever be. I carried nothing to set me apart, being one of those who can pass in a crowd. So obviously it wasn’t the clothes I wore or the way I looked that prompted the captain to pick me out of several hundred passengers to receive personal attention. In presenting to you this very workable science, I am aware that the subject has been handled before from many angles, but also realize that many people shy away from any approach that smacks of religion, the occult, or the metaphysical. Accordingly, I am using the language of a businessman who believes that sincere thinking, clear writing, and simple language will get any message across. You have often heard it said that you can if you believe you can. An old Latin proverb says, “Believe that you have it, and you have it.” Belief is the motivating force that enables you to achieve your goal. If you are ill and imbedded deeply within you is the thought or belief that you will recover, the odds are that you will. It’s the belief or the basic confidence within you that brings outward material results. I speak of normal and mentally healthy people. I wouldn’t tell a handicapped person that he could excel in baseball or football. Nor would I tell a woman who was quite plain- looking that she could make herself into a great beauty overnight, since the odds are against it. Yet these things could happen, for there have been many remarkable cures. And when more is learned about the powers of the mind, I firmly believe that we shall witness many cures that today’s medical profession deems impossible. Finally, I would never discourage anyone; for in this life, anything can happen – and what can help bring it to pass is Hope. Dr. Alexander Cannon was a distinguished British scientist and physician whose books on the general subject of thought stirred up controversy here and abroad. He declared that while today a man cannot grow a new leg (as a crab can grow a new claw), he could if the mind of man hadn’t rejected the possibility. The eminent scientist claimed that if the thought is changed in the innermost depths of the unconscious mind, then man will grow a new leg as easily as the crab grows a new claw. I know, such a statement may sound incredible, but how do we know that it will not be done some day? Frequently I lunch with a group of medical men, all specialists in various branches of medicine and surgery. I know that if I voiced such an idea, they would suggest that I have my head examined. However, I find that some of these doctors, especially those more recently graduated from our better schools, are no longer closing their minds to the role that thought plays in causing and curing functional disturbances in the body. A few weeks before I wrote this chapter, a neighbor came to me to explain how his warts happened to disappear. During a stay at the hospital, he had wandered out on the porch where another convalescent patient was conversing with a friend. Said the visitor to the other patient, “So you would like to get rid of the warts on your hand? Well, just let me count them, and they’ll disappear.” My neighbor said he looked at the stranger for a moment, then said: “While you’re about it, will you count mine, too?” He did, and my neighbor thought no more about it until after he had gone home and he happened to look at his hands one day. “The mess of warts had entirely disappeared!” he told me. I told this story to a group of doctors one day. A well-known specialist – and personal friend – grunted, saying, “Preposterous!” Across the table, another doctor who had recently been teaching in a medical school came to my aid, declaring that there were many authenticated cases of suggestion having been used to cure warts. I was tempted to remind them that several years before, newspapers and medical journals had reported how Heim, a Swiss geologist, had removed warts by suggestion, and had also cited the procedure of Professor Block, another Swiss specialist, in his use of psychology and suggestion for the same purpose. Back in January, 1945, Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons set up the first psychoanalytic and psychosomatic clinic in this country for the purpose of studying the relationship between the unconscious mind and the body. I kept silent, feeling that I was too outnumbered for an argument. Since this conversation, considerable publicity was given to the findings of Dr. Frederick Kalz, a noted Canadian authority who flatly stated that suggestion works in many cases, even to curing warts that are infectious and caused by a virus. In a 1945 article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, Dr. Kalz declared that, “In every country in the world, some magic procedures to cure warts are known . . . It may be anything from covering the wart with spider-webs to burying toad eggs on a crossroad at new moon; all these magic procedures are effective, if the patient believes in them.” In describing the treatment of patients with skin trouble, he says, “I have often prescribed the very same ointment, accompanied by some promising words, which has been tried unsuccessfully by some other medical man, and got credit for a quick cure.” He also points out that X-ray therapy is especially suggestive; it works even when the technician fails to switch on the high power! Experiments with systematic fake irradiation bear out this observation. Here in Dr. Kalz’s work we see actual examples of the magic of believing at work in the curing of warts and the treatment of skin trouble. Another time my medical friends and I were discussing telepathy.I remarked that some of our greatest students and scholars believed in it. Dr. Alexis Carrel, of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was not only a thorough believer in the phenomenon but declared that there was definite scientific proof that man could project his thought even at great distances into other minds. “Oh, he was just a senile old man,” remarked another specialist at the table, a nationally known member of the American Medical Association. I looked at him with astonishment, for Dr. Carrel won the Nobel Prize for his medical research. When he put forth his ideas in that remarkable book, Man the Unknown, published in 1935, he was regarded as one of the world’s foremost medical scientists and investigators. I have no quarrel with the medical fraternity. Quite the contrary, for its members are generally sincere, able, and open-minded men, and a number are among my closest friends. However, some medical specialists, especially those inclined to restrict their studies to their respective fields, refuse to accept anything that may upset their early teachings and dogmatic beliefs. This resistance is not confined to the medical profession: countless specialists in other lines, including business, know very little outside of their chosen fields, and their minds are closed to any idea beyond their limited imaginations. Frequently, I have offered to lend books to these various specialists – only to be told, after informing them of the contents, that they were not interested. This is the paradox: Many apparently well-educated men and women, successful in their respective fields, will, in their broad ignorance, condemn the idea of thought power and make no endeavor to learn more about it – yet every one of them has unconsciously made use of it! Again, many people will believe only what they like to believe or what fits into their own scheme of things, summarily rejecting anything to the contrary. Countless men whose ideas developed the very civilization we live in have been hooted at, slandered, even crucified by the ignoramuses of their times. I think of the words of Marie Corelli, the English novelist who became world famous in the 19th century: “The very idea that any one creature (human) should be fortunate enough to secure some particular advantage which others, through their own indolence or indifference, have missed is sufficient to excite the envy of the weak or the anger of the ignorant . . . It is impossible that an outsider should enter into a clear understanding of the mystical spiritual-nature world around him, and it follows that the teachings and tenets of that spiritual-nature world must be more or less a closed book to such a one – a book, moreover, which he seldom cares or dares to try and open. For this reason, the sages concealed much of their profound knowledge from the multitude, because they rightly recognized the limitations of narrow minds and prejudiced opinions . . . What the fool cannot learn, he laughs at, thinking that by his laughter he shows superiority instead of latent idiocy.”1 Great investigators and thinkers of the world, including many famous scientists, are in the open today, freely discussing the subject and giving the results of their experiments. Shortly before his death, Charles P. Steinmetz, famous engineer of the General Electric Company, declared, “The most important advance in the next fifty years will be in the realm of the spiritual – dealing with the spirit – thought.” Dr. Robert Gault, while professor of Psychology at Northwestern University, was credited with the statement: “We are at the threshold of our knowledge of the latent psychic powers of man.” Much has been written and said about mystical powers, unknown forces, the occult, metaphysics (beyond science), mental physics, psychology (the science of mind), black and white magic, and many kindred subjects, causing most people to believe that they are in the field of the supernatural. Perhaps they are for some. But to me, the only inexplicable thing about these powers is that belief makes them work. During the years that I have appeared before luncheon clubs, business concerns, and sales organizations, as well as talking over the radio to thousands of people about this science, I have seen results that can be termed phenomenal. As I said before, many have used it in their business to double, treble, even quadruple their incomes. My files are filled with letters from people in all walks of life, testifying what they have accomplished by using the science. As an instance, I think of Ashley C. Dixon, whose name was once known to thousands of radio listeners in the Pacific Northwest. A number of years ago, he wrote me voluntarily to say that he had studied this subject in an academic way, but had never fully believed it until he was forty-three, when he had only 65 to his name, no employment, and no jobs available. He set out to prove to himself that the science would work. I quote the following excerpts from Mr. Dixon’s letter: “Along came your book T.N.T. It put forth in workable form all that I had known before. It was like seeing Niagara Falls for the first time. One knew there was such a place; but confirmation was the actual personal contact with it. And so, T.N.T. gave me in print the facts I had known and used, but in a clear form. Here was something I could read and use day by day, holding the thoughts till they were fully demonstrated. “What has all this been worth to me in dollars and cents? That, of course, is the question of the average man. He wants to see something . . . in the profit column; something material in the way of dollars and cents. Here’s the answer. I have made a hundred thousand dollars, most of it in paid-up insurance and annuities. I have sold my business which costs me 5,000 (originally borrowed) for 30,000, and am now working on a contract to run for the next ten years which will net me 50,000 if I loaf; and more if I care to work. This is not a boast. It is a factual statement of what has actually happened in the past ten years . . . It cannot be done in a moment, or a day or a month, but it can be done.” In 1934, during the lowest point of the Depression, the head of the Better Business Bureau in a large Pacific Coast city heard of what was happening to firms and individuals who were following my teachings. He decided to investigate my work. Later he congratulated me publicly and subsequently wrote me as follows: “My statement – that the teachings have done more to stimulate business here during the past year than any other single factor or agency – is based upon statements by numerous executives who have been using the theme successfully in their businesses . . . When I first heard of the phenomenal results you were obtaining, I was inclined to question the facts. They seemed too preposterous to be true. But upon investigation, talking with heads of firms using the theme and with salesmen who have doubled and trebled their incomes, as well as hearing many of your lectures and getting into the subject for myself, the terrific and dynamic force embraced by it all becomes apparent. It isn’t going to be understood by everyone in a minute, but firms and individuals that accept what you have to give and follow through can expect some startling and extraordinary results. You have fully demonstrated that, and therefore are to be congratulated.” This man has since risen to great heights in the business world and has written me of having seen other practical demonstrations of the workings of this science. When I started this book, I decided to check with some of the individuals and firms who had written me to certify the phenomenal results they had achieved by using this science. Without exception, every one testified to the continuing progress he had made. One of the most outstanding accounts was related by Mr. Don Quayle, once well-known to the Disabled American War Veterans, who was long active in veterans’ affairs in the Northwest. In 1937, he wrote me: “It was no easy matter, at first, to completely accept your ideas. But my circumstances and physical condition forced me to keep at it continuously until understanding came . . . You see, in February, 1924, I was stricken with partial paralysis of my lower limbs. I needed crutches to even get about at all, and at best, for only short distances, and at a snail’s pace. For a bank executive who had been active in the business world this forced inactivity was not easy to get used to. It was bearable only because I received government compensation – my disability being considered due to service during the World War. However, in 1933, the Government dropped me from the compensation rolls, and I was forced to make a living. My home and other properties were about to be repossessed. It was not a pleasant picture, nor a hopeful future. “Necessity forced me to put into practice the principles you explained so well. Sticking to it proves them. Possibly I was favored because I couldn’t quit the insurance and public accounting business – due to my inability to enter any other kind of work. But persistence gives confidence, and continued right mental attitude followed by consistent action will bring success. I haven’t reached the degree of success I desire, but that does not bother me at all, for now I am making a good living, have saved my properties, and know the formula that leads to the fullest success. When you have that knowing inside you, fear vanishes, as do the obstructions to a continued life of all good.” I first met Mr. Quayle just after he had started his business with one desk in the front of a plumbing shop. In the following years, it was a pleasure to see him move from place to place, his business growing by leaps and bounds, until he occupied the entire ground floor of a building on one of the main thoroughfares of a great western city. Realizing that his story of achievement was a remarkable one, I asked permission to quote his earlier letter. “By all means, do so,” he replied, “if you think it will help others. You might add that I now have the whole quarters at 20th and Sandy and I employ twenty-two people. I have just brought the business lot between 28th and 29th on Sandy where I shall build my own office building. I sincerely wish that all people would accept your teachings.” At the time I grasped this science, I had no idea that I was later to put it into book form. My primary thought was to use it to save my own organization from bankruptcy. I was then vice-president of an investment banking firm, and we had been caught in the economic crisis and were headed for disaster. I don’t know whether I was inspired, but I dictated the first draft of my brochure in its entirety in less than five hours, without notes or references of any kind before me. At the same time the idea for the brochure came to me, the words, “cosmic consciousness,” floated before my mind. They meant nothing then. But after T.N.T – It Rocks the Earth was published, it reached a woman author living in New York, who wrote me as follows: “Seriously, I’ve been eating and sleeping [your] philosophy for the last ten years. It brought me to New York on no carfare; it sold my stuff to publishers when I had a lousy little job earning 30 a week . . . It took me to Europe a couple of times, and bought me silver foxes.” In the same letter, she urged me to read Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke’s Cosmic Consciousness, declaring that it contained brilliant accounts of the actual experience of illumination. When I did, I was astounded to discover that my experience actually paralleled the illuminations listed and explained by Dr. Bucke. In the original draft of my brochure, I had described in detail my experience with “brilliant white light.” But subsequently, when I showed the manuscript to a close friend, he urged me to tone down the wording: “People won’t know what you are talking about in referring to that ‘white light’ – some may think you’ve gone off the deep end.” Consequently, I changed it. But those of you that know something about “cosmic illumination” and have read my earlier small book will catch my reference to the “light.” However, the memory of that singular experience will always remain with me: in those few seconds, I received more knowledge and understanding than I had ever received in years of reading and studying. In the same period, it came to me in a flash why my firm was going on the rocks – not because of the threatening outside happenings and events, but because of the mental attitude of our employees. We were all succumbing to mass fear-thoughts: we feared that the Depression was weakening our spirit and sweeping everything downhill to financial disaster. With our own thoughts of ruin, we were attracting the disaster to ourselves. It occurred to me that to save the firm and to begin fighting the Depression itself, all I needed to do was reverse the thinking of every person connected with our organization. I set about doing that very thing. As Frank W. Camp, who wrote the introduction to my brochure declared, it was followed “by the most remarkable transformation of individuals and organization as well.” I admit that some of my statements may be ridiculed by classroom psychologists. But every day, thousands of people demonstrate for themselves that the science works. As for you, the reader, the main point to consider is whether it will work for you. The only way you can find out is to try it yourself. I give you this science, in the confident knowledge that no matter how you use it, you will get results. But I do wish to repeat a warning given in my brochure: Never use it for harmful or evil purposes. Since the beginning, there have been two great subtle forces in the world – good and evil. Both are terrifically powerful in their respective scopes and cycles. The basic principle operating both is mind power – massed mind power. Sometimes evil appears to have the upper hand, and at other times good is at the controls. It is mind power that has built empires, and we have seen how it can be used to destroy them – history has recorded the facts. If you read this book reflectively, you will understand how the science can be used with terribly destructive force, as well as for good and constructive results. It is like many natural forces, such as water and fire, which are among men’s greatest benefactors. Yet both can be hideously catastrophic, depending upon whether they are used for constructive or destructive purposes. Therefore, take great care that you do not misuse the science of “Mind Stuff.” I cannot emphasize this too strongly, for if you employ it for harmful or evil purposes, it will boomerang and destroy you just as it has others down through the centuries. These are not idle words, but solemn words of warning.","output":"From the first chapter of this book, we learn about the author's belief in a powerful force that he deems practical and workable, but widely unknown or misunderstood – the power of belief. The author shares his experience and conviction that belief can lead to significant changes in a person's life, including overcoming difficulties and achieving success. The author, at one point in his life, sought to understand this power after coming across numerous instances where belief seemed to play a crucial role in achieving seemingly unattainable outcomes. He refers to historical examples, personal experiences with diverse religious and spiritual leaders, and varying cultural practices that all seem to tap into this power in some form. The author suggests that the \\"golden thread\\" across all teachings, philosophies, and successes he has studied is belief. He argues that belief itself holds almost magical power to manifest real changes and achieve results. For instance, his own determination to accumulate wealth during and after World War I, coupled with the practices he later adopted (like consistently visualizing wealth and doodling dollar signs), led him to achieve substantial material success. The book describes the author's journey to understanding and harnessing the power of belief, from his early skepticism and subsequent embrace of the concept to his work with various individuals and organizations who successfully applied the principles he espoused. The author recalls numerous examples where people's focused thoughts and beliefs resulted in impressive changes in their circumstances, such as improved financial status or even instances of healing. He warns readers, however, of the potential misuse of this power. Emphasizing the dual nature of any force, he cautions against the use of belief for harm or evil, as this may have devastating repercussions on the individual wielding it. Throughout the chapter, the author urges readers to explore this power for themselves, to apply it constructively and witness its potential firsthand. While he acknowledges that the principles he discusses might be met with skepticism by conventional thinkers, the anecdotal evidence he provides aims to illustrate the practical application and effectiveness of belief in various aspects of life, from business to personal well-being."},{"instruction":"read write habit to follow","output":"If you're asking for effective habits to develop a strong reading and writing routine, here are several strategies that can help: **Habitual Reading** 1. **Set a Daily Goal**: Determine a specific time frame or page number to read every day.

Медицинское обследование: В военные вузы кандидаты проходят более строгий медицинский осмотр, чтобы убедиться, что они физически и психологически подходят для службы в армии. В отличие от гражданских вузов, где медицинские требования могут быть менее строгими и зависят от выбранной специальности. 2. Физическая подготовка: Для поступления в военный вуз также необходимо успешно пройти физические испытания. Результаты этих тестов могут оказать значимое влияние на результаты конкурсного отбора. 3. Возрастные ограничения: Военные учебные заведения обычно имеют более строгие возрастные критерии для поступления по сравнению с гражданскими вузами, часто ограничивая возраст приема в районе 16-22 лет. 4. Обязательства по службе: Военные вузы обычно предполагают не только обучение, но и последующую службу в армии после окончания учебы. При поступлении в такие вузы кандидаты часто подписывают контракт о службе на определенный срок. 5. Государственное финансирование: Обучение в военных вузах обычно полностью финансируется государством, и курсанты получают стипендию. В гражданских же вузах студенты часто оплачивают свое обучение сами или на условиях государственной поддержки, которая может варьироваться. 6. Условия обучения: Военные вузы имеют строгий порядок и дисциплину, и обучение в них часто куда более регламентировано. Общежитие и прохождение практических занятий подчиняется правилам воинской части. 7. Программы обучения: Военные ВУЗы готовят специалистов для конкретных нужд вооруженных сил, их образовательные программы включают военно-специальные дисциплины, которые отсутствуют в гражданских вузах. 8.

The city's character would have been defined by Georgian squares, Victorian terraces, historic churches, and the River Liffey, which cuts through the city. In 1989, the economic situation in Ireland was not as prosperous as it later became during the Celtic Tiger years of the late 1990s and early 2000s. As a result, some areas of the city might have appeared a bit worn or rundown compared to their later revitalized states. However, Dublin has always been known for its cultural offerings, so historical landmarks such as Trinity College Dublin, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Christ Church Cathedral, and the General Post Office (GPO) on O'Connell Street would have been prominent attractions. O'Connell Street, one of the main thoroughfares, would have been bustling with activity, although the street's appearance has been subject to changes due to redevelopment efforts over the years. Grafton Street and Temple Bar would have been popular areas for shopping and nightlife, but they may have had a more traditional and less commercialized atmosphere than they have today. Public transportation would have consisted of the Dublin Bus service and the suburban rail services (DART), but the LUAS tram system would not yet have been established. The city would have also been more car-centric, with less infrastructure for cycling. Overall, the Dublin of 1989 would have had historical charm and cultural richness, but it also would have been on the cusp of significant economic and social changes that would transform it over the following decades."},{"instruction":"What Did Berlin Look Like In 1987?","output":"In 1987, Berlin was a city deeply divided by the Cold War, physically and ideologically split between the capitalist West Berlin and the communist East Berlin. The Berlin Wall, which stood as a somber symbol of the Iron Curtain, had been erected since 1961 and was over two decades old by 1987. The Wall not only separated families and friends but also represented the clash between two superpowers and their spheres of influence. West Berlin was an enclave of West Germany, surrounded by East German territory. It was a vibrant and somewhat eclectic city, known for its cultural scene and as a haven for artists, musicians, and alternative lifestyles. West Berlin's infrastructure had seen significant investments from the West German government and other Western sources, making it an island of prosperity against the backdrop of the communist East. Its architecture included modern post-war developments as well as older, historical buildings that had survived World War II bombings. Famous landmarks like the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church stood in partial ruins as a reminder of the war, while the Kurfürstendamm (often called Ku'damm) served as a bustling shopping boulevard, lined with stores, cafes, and restaurants. West Berlin also included green spaces like the Tiergarten and the cultural hub at the Kulturforum with institutions like the Berlin Philharmonic. East Berlin, by contrast, was the capital of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and was characterized by the austere and utilitarian architecture typical of Soviet influence. Alexanderplatz was a focal point for East Berlin's city life, featuring the Fernsehturm (TV Tower) which stood as one of the tallest structures in Europe at the time. The Nikolaiviertel, an area near Alexanderplatz, had been reconstructed in a pseudo-historical style in preparation for the city's 750th anniversary in 1987. Infrastructure in East Berlin was less developed than in the West, and while there were pockets of historic pre-war architecture, much had been rebuilt in a socialist realist style, with large, blocky structures and prefabricated Plattenbau housing estates. Despite being the capital of the GDR, East Berlin had a more subdued atmosphere due to economic limitations and the oppressive nature of the Stasi, the East German secret police. In 1987, the tension between the two sides of the city was evident, but there were also signs of change as political and economic pressures would eventually lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, just two years later. This period was marked by a series of events, including the visit of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who famously urged the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall\\" in a speech delivered at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin."},{"instruction":"need samole ebook contnmet in 6000 wrds and make it informative chnage headings also make it unqieu and in simple eng strat with question to user and then a stats and why its imprtmnat in th eintro para of 300 wrds here is refrence https://www.leewayhertz.com/ai-use-cases-and-applications/ - AI USE CASES & APPLICATIONS ACROSS MAJOR INDUSTRIES AI use cases Even though Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around as an academic and scientific discipline since the 1950s, AI technology has gained a lot of traction in the last few years.

growing here from the year 2000 from the year you know when we started agriculture way back then 5,000 years ago it took five thousand years to go from ten million to 1 billion this is 1 billion here it is because 1 2 3 4 died sadly before growing up to have children themselves the past was ugly human beings have never ever lived in ecological balance with nature that's a myth people have been dying in ecological balance with nature it's due to high and tragic death rates of children and young people that there's been a balance between human and nature and that's ugly and people hated it and they wanted their children to survive and after the Industrial Revolution we got soap industrially produced soap we got piped water and we got some medical actions you know and instead of for dying for survived and to died and that caused the growth of the population you see to parents for children doubling in one generation 25 years 1 billion to two billion 25 years more 2 billion to forbid and there we went to 7 billion people and this is what many co population explosion raghava yeah but it was inevitable we didn't want kids to continue to die and people would not apply family planning until they saw their kids surviving all this the death rate has to fall before the birthrate is falling and and and then many call this exponential growth have you heard the term exponential growth this is exponential faster and forever since 1960 we have had no exponential growth whatsoever we've had an absolutely linear growth and for those of you doing math you know that linear grow of means that the interest rate is falling every year we added 1 billion in 14 years 1 billion in 14 years 1 billion in 14th year that means the adding of billions did not become faster and faster but there's so much crap written and said about population growth so they are put in these X's explosion exponentially and you argue for things based on scare trying to scare people instead of making them understand here now we have a situation where we will add another 4 billion in spite of already having reached the new balance this is strange why will we add 4 billions when the number of children have stopped increasing right strange this one the balance was controlled by death it was ugly and unacceptable people would never accept that they tried their best this balance is controlled by love by being able to disentangle sexuality and reproduction and some religious leaders haven't got it yet we try to make it very simple to understand this is a good thing it's a good thing that you can separate those two and and and why will it be 11 billions well I have some more improved educational material from Gapminder here I brought these blocks here imagine that this is 1 billion people you can see here 1 billion people and these ones or children below 15 here's the edge see they are below 15 these are the children there 2 billion in the world next age group 15 to 30 there are also almost 2 billions I'm going to simplify not falsify but simplify really it's actually 1.8 or something here but I say to Bill next group I say it's 1 billion it's actually 1.4 but they are less here next group 45 to 60 1 billion almost precisely 1 bin then it's my group 60 years and older and we are not really 1 billion but almost and we take the help by some really old people who join our group here so we have this is the world population today this is the world the compositional world population you could call it a population pyramid more in the base than up here now many think that the reason these are missing is because they died no no some are missing because they died most are missing because they were never born it was back then 30 to 60 years ago there were fewer people born because there were fewer women then more and more survived and then we got this situation now the number of children will not increase these to billions will remain to billions for the rest of this century and the 71-year of life expectancy won't increase that much so let's assume that that stays the same so if number of children stays the same length of life stays the same what will happen because there's some people telling me the environmental problems are so severe so we have to stop world population below 10 billion hi is that so have you studied demography I think yes yes yes we have to stop it no you can't I see and I will show you know why you can't stop it below 10 because imagine let's look at it let's look at my group what happened to people like me do you know that no one has a family that are Undertaker's they die we die the old people die some think we become angels some things we just disappear anyhow they disappear what happens to the rest of you you grow older you grow older and older and older and 15 years from now you have changed age group and then other children come and replace you down there can you see same amount of children as I show you then they old died the rest grow older and older and older and get the same amount of chill thirty years from now then they old die is not so difficult you get it now they die the rest grow older and older and older and here they are I mean this this is you started down there most of you students one two three this is when you are up here you are 60 years old you become like me you see when you are like me it's filled up to here and we have three billion more you saw the magic without increasing the number of children without increasing the length of life we got three billion more I'll do it once more because you're in doubt the summit thing here I made this up you know in some way the old dies the rest grow older and they get children they all die the rest grow older they get children they all die the rest grow older they get children and there are inevitably you will have three billion more people because death starts up here at this edge relatively few die here a 135 million children born six million die every year it's down to 5% that's mainly down here our depth then death rate is relatively low all the way up because life expectancy 71 now in spite of instead of getting shorter life what we think is that we will get longer life and we think we will get 1 billion more up there because I'm very happy of that that will give me 15 years more to follow statistics you know so now that there is some people just wrote in the Swedish newspaper and criticized means that we must be less than 10 billions but who should we take away which one do they want to remove there should be that you know they take away the old but is still 10 billion stay until then you want to take more can you kill these two no say no for God's sake it's for better don't be in doubt it's absolutely forbidden ourself not clean haven't you read the Bible so what shall you do what shall you do I think you will have to do it like this you have to force people to just a one child do you see if you do not much the tomb date say you introduce one child French it's very delicate here to be careful if they did it like this then they can get a failure you think people voluntarily will go for one child no I suggested to the leader of the Swedish environmental party who argue that one time and said that that you know we should have less people in the world I said I am we talked with her and I said yeah why don't you start with Sweden there because we are one of the rich country that increased the number of children per room it's quite easy you just take away the child allowances the subsidies for the daycare center and you put in school fees three simple measures as a politician the number of children per woman the Sweden will drop from two to 1.5 of course you will lose the next election action and you have to make a coup d'etat you know and become dictator it's very strange how serious people can suggest this now I share the concern about the environment I share the concern about elephants and rhinos I share more than anyone else the consider to concern about the climate but I ain't going to kill people to achieve I ain't going to force people to get sterilized I ain't come to become Nazi - because it won't work people won't accept they won't accept it and and and here you can see so I think we will have to yes this is like oh you can't you can't mix up with population like that it's very dangerous have to be careful with people all right you have to be very careful with people so they can live this in their life I think the solution for the world lies in respecting people you know and seeing what it is and that's not difficult we know everyone should have access to contraceptives everywhere but not be forced because if you force people it will backfire and we know that the poorest in Africa they will not use contraceptive as long as they say their children die as long as they don't have a school in the village as long as they need their children for work Malala said they don't go to school because they have to work to support their family and as long as things are like this they want their kids and then some wants their kid a little too long many kids because some men are proud because I made so many children and when men think that their pride is having seven eight nine children instead of how well their children are doing that's old-fashioned Patriarca girl thinking men have to think my pride is how well my children are doing how happy they are in life that's my pride and when you get that attitude change you have to get it's not only providing services this is the number of births in the world it has already happened the number of births is not increasing any longer in the world the adults are increasing you get it now you understand why these adults already it's these three just by the fill-up and it's this group here but it's more to it it's more to it we have to go a little more into details a little more into details look here now it's late in the evening and I put a demanding explanation demography here to you each doll here is hundred million now these one were thousand millions 1 billion thousand 8 now ten out of these dolls is one here down here I have what is it should be about twenty down there these ones are Europeans children these are American children these are African children as many children in Africa as in the whole of the Americas in Europe together and these are Asian children and you can see that at the age between fifteen and thirty then there are less Africans he is even less African he is very few Africans so the African population is quite dramatic it's in increasing the number of children in Asia they've stopped increasing remember the Asian curve it was already down to two so Asia is not increasing Africa is at four point five they will continue to increase for another thirty years more or less 30 years so what happens here is the following you know it now the old dies the rest grow older and they have their children whoop one more in Africa one less in Asia that's why the number of children doesn't increase the increase of children in Africa is compensated by a decrease of children in Asia and Europe but Europe is so little it doesn't matter much they die they grow older and they get children one more in Africa out of things like this out of four children in China that pass their 15th birthday three are replaced by a Chinese baby born and one is replaced by the Nigerian baby born that means that children conceptually are moving from Asia to Africa children in the world remain the same but they are moving towards poverty because in poverty the number of children increase where countries are more wealthy the number decrease that's why it's a good reason to support UNICEF children in the world need support and here they die they get older and they get children and they die and they get older and they get children and this is the Phillipa battles you remember the three billion show you here these three billions is the same as that group there when I make it in more detail it's a fill up of people and that's why Africa will increase so much and Asia will increase so much Africa also increase here because an increase of children and Asia decrease down there so longer life this one I hope to be this one I can follow statistics for 15 more years you know and see what happens this we don't know we don't know here you see if people want to decrease the number of people in the world they think provide prevent contraceptives in Africa yes go for it but don't think you can force poor women's poor women are clever otherwise they are dead don't think they are dumb they want many children it's because they see their children dying they need their kids who help them they get the better life mediately they will ask first for family planning to space children to wait for the next child and then decide how many they with that this is a new tool that Gapminder have made on our webpage","output":"The excerpt presents an argument about the historical and future trends in the world's population growth. Here's a summary of the key points made: 1. Historical Trends: In the past, the average number of children per family was high (about six), yet the population didn't grow rapidly because a large number of those children died young. It wasn't until industrial advancements like soap production, piped water, and medical breakthroughs reduced child mortality that population growth accelerated. 2. Industrial Revolution Impact: With fewer children dying, the birth rate eventually began to exceed the death rate, leading to a sharp increase in population. This caused what some refer to as the \\"population explosion.\\" 3. Linear Growth: Contrary to popular belief, the speaker argues that since 1960, the growth of the world's population has been linear rather than exponential, meaning the rate of population increase is declining despite an additional billion people every 14 years or so. 4. Future Growth: Despite a stabilization in the number of children being born, the global population is still expected to grow due to the \\"fill-up\\" effect, whereby younger age cohorts replace older ones as they die. 5. Age Structure: The speaker uses blocks to illustrate the age structure of the population, showing that the number of children (younger than 15) will remain constant, and increases in population will mainly come from adults due to improved life expectancies. 6. Regional Differences: The growth of the number of children will happen primarily in Africa, while in Asia, the number of children will decrease, balancing out the global number. 7. Ethical Considerations and Solutions: The speaker criticizes proposals to force population control and promotes more ethical solutions like improving child survival rates, education, and access to contraceptives. Greater respect for people and understanding demographic changes are crucial. 8. Attitudes Towards Children: The speaker emphasizes the importance of changing attitudes so that men take pride in the well-being of their children rather than in the number of children they have. In conclusion, the speaker suggests that understanding demographic trends and respecting individual choices are key to addressing population growth and that coercive measures to control population are both unethical and ineffective."},{"instruction":"how can i use this stuff in excerpt to argue that carrying capacity of the earth is 11 billion","output":"To argue that the carrying capacity of Earth is 11 billion using the information provided in the excerpt, you could focus on several points that were made: 1. **Demographic Transition**: The excerpt discusses the historical trend where the death rate has fallen before the birth rate starts to fall. This suggests that with improvements in public health, nutrition, and education, societies naturally transition towards lower birth rates once a certain level of development is reached. This trend could imply that once global development reaches a certain threshold, population will stabilize, potentially at or below the carrying capacity. 2. **Stabilization of Birth Rates**: The speaker mentions that the number of children in the world is not increasing and is expected to stay constant at about 2 billion for the rest of the century. If the number of births remains constant while death rates continue to decline, this would ultimately lead to a stabilization of the population, which the speaker implies could level off at around 11 billion. 3. **Linear vs. Exponential Growth**: The speaker clarifies that since the 1960s, population growth has been linear rather than exponential. This suggests that the increase in population will not continue to accelerate indefinitely, but rather grow at a steady rate until it stabilizes, supporting the idea of an equilibrium population that the Earth can sustain. 4. **Age Structure and Fill-Up Effect**: The excerpt describes how the current population distribution shows more younger people than older, and that as the older generations die off and are replaced by an equal number of younger individuals, the overall population will grow without an increase in the birth rate. This \\"fill-up effect\\" leads to a temporary increase in the population but does not necessarily imply an ongoing trend beyond the point of stabilization, which the speaker suggests is around 11 billion. 5. **Regional Differences in Growth Rates**: The presenter emphasizes that population growth is not uniform across the globe. With birth rates stabilizing or declining in most regions except for parts of Africa, future global population growth is likely to be less than it would be if these trends were not in place. To support the argument that the Earth’s carrying capacity is 11 billion, you would also need to bring in evidence beyond demographic trends: - **Resource Management**: Argue that with improved technology and sustainable practices, we can manage resources more efficiently to support a larger population. - **Technological and Agricultural Innovation**: Present evidence on how innovations in agriculture, water purification, renewable energy, and waste management could sustain a larger population without degrading the environment. - **Socioeconomic Development**: Make the case that continued socioeconomic development, particularly in less developed countries, can lead to lower fertility rates and a more stable population size. - **Adjustment of Consumption Patterns**: Discuss how adjusting global consumption patterns, reducing waste, and transitioning to a circular economy might allow Earth to support a larger population sustainably. Conclusively, the argument that Earth’s carrying capacity is 11 billion would have to be multifaceted, not solely based on the demographic trends outlined in the excerpt, but also on a holistic consideration of advancements in sustainability and global development."},{"instruction":"i want to argue it using population data from 1950 to 2021","output":"To construct an argument using population data from 1950 to 2021 to suggest that Earth's carrying capacity is 11 billion, you would focus on trends in population growth during these years and evaluate the data in the context of global developments and resource use. Here's a possible approach: 1. **Historical Population Data (1950-2021)**: Evaluate the data from 1950 to 2021, noting the growth pattern. Stress the rapid increase from around 2.5 billion in 1950 to approximately 7.8 billion in 2021. Highlight the deceleration of growth rates during this period, indicating a demographic transition globally. 2. **Demographic Transition**: Use the data to illustrate the demographic transition concept – where countries move from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates as they develop. Point out any parts of the world where this transition is well underway or complete (most developed nations) versus regions where it is still ongoing (some developing nations). 3. **Stabilization of Global Fertility Rates**: Show that global fertility rates have decreased over the observed period. The significant drop in the global total fertility rate indicates a movement towards population stabilization – a key point supporting the idea that the population could stabilize at or before reaching 11 billion. 4. **Technological and Agricultural Advances**: Consider the advances in technology and agriculture that have occurred since 1950, allowing the world to support the current population. Argue that these trends can continue and will support additional billions. 5. **Improvements in Efficiency and Resource Management**: Address the improvements in efficiency and resource management, such as crop yields and water usage, which have increased over the period and can be extrapolated to suggest that further improvements could help sustain a larger population. 6. **Reduced Growth Rates**: Stress the significant decline in population growth rates in recent decades, and project these trends into the future, supporting the hypothesis that the growth rate will continue to decrease, leading to a population plateau. 7. **Sustainability Initiatives**: Use recent data to show how global sustainability initiatives (like the Paris Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals) aim to support a growing population within Earth’s carrying capacity. 8. **Life Expectancy and Aging Populations**: Reference the increase in life expectancy since 1950 and the emerging issue of aging populations in developed countries to illustrate a shift towards demographic patterns associated with stable or shrinking populations rather than explosive growth. Support your points with data such as: - The world population of approximately 2.5 billion in 1950 compared to about 7.8 billion in 2021. - The global total fertility rate, which has fallen from 5.0 live births per woman in the 1950s to about 2.4 in 2021. - The growth rate in 1950 was around 1.9%, but by 2021, it had slowed to about 1.0%. Be sure to acknowledge and address potential challenges and counterarguments: - **Finite Resources**: Concede that Earth's resources are finite, but argue that through sustainable development, innovation, and careful management, Earth could feasibly support an 11 billion population. - **Environmental Impact**: Recognize the strain on ecosystems and biodiversity, yet suggest that with concentrated global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and conserve natural habitats, we can find a balance between human needs and environmental protection. - **Equitable Distribution of Resources**: Address the potential for resource scarcity not because of an absolute shortage, but due to unequal distribution, directing the conversation towards solutions for equity and access rather than just population control. While the demographic data from 1950 to 2021 can provide a foundation for this argument, asserting that Earth's carrying capacity is 11 billion inherently requires assumptions about future technological, economic, and social developments. As such, even with historical population data on your side, the argument will need to tie in projections about our ability to sustainably manage resources and adapt to changing environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"(rephrase this) since we can't use expoential functions or linear functions to predict populations(list reason they are bad for predicting populations and then introduce logistic equations.","output":"Relying on either exponential or linear functions to forecast population growth can lead to inaccurate predictions due to their inherent limitations. Exponential models assume a constant growth rate, leading to unsustainably high population sizes that don't account for environmental resistance or resource limitations. Linear models may underestimate growth by not accounting for the compounding nature of population dynamics, especially in the earlier stages when resources are plentiful. Instead, logistic equations are more suitable for predicting population sizes because they incorporate the concept of carrying capacity. As a population grows and begins to reach the limits of the environment's ability to support it, the growth rate slows down, reflecting a more realistic pattern of population stabilization. Thus, logistic models offer a more nuanced approach that aligns with observed trends in population dynamics, providing a balance between the unduly optimistic projections of exponential functions and the oversimplified assumptions of linear growth."},{"instruction":"make it 2 sentences","output":"Exponential and linear functions fall short in predicting population growth as the former ignores resource constraints leading to unrealistically high estimates, and the latter overlooks the compounding effects inherent in population increases. Logistic equations offer a more accurate alternative by accounting for the environment's carrying capacity and resulting slowdown in growth as populations approach this limit."},{"instruction":"Reflect on the limitations of the models to predict popuation and the potential implications of different sceranios","output":"The limitations of exponential and linear models in predicting population stem from their oversimplified assumptions about growth dynamics. Exponential models fail to account for the inevitable fact that resources are finite, which can lead to scenarios where population growth projections become unsustainable, potentially underestimating the urgency of resource depletion and environmental degradation. Linear models, conversely, may not capture the true potential for population growth during periods where resources are abundant, possibly leading to a lack of preparedness for the needs and impacts of a rapidly growing population. The consequences of relying on these models can be significant. If policymakers and planners base decisions on exponential growth projections, they might overinvest in resources or overestimate the capacity needed for infrastructure, education, and health care. This could lead to economic inefficiencies or environmental strain from overproduction. On the other hand, using linear models could result in under-provisioning for future populations, potentially leading to shortages of housing, food, and other essentials, exacerbating poverty and inequality. Adopting logistic models, which consider a population's carrying capacity, yields predictions that incorporate the more complex nature of growth, balancing the understanding of both resource limits and periods of growth. This model nudges scenarios toward sustainable development strategies by emphasizing the need for resource conservation, waste reduction, and investment in technologies that enhance efficiencies. While no model can predict future populations with complete accuracy, logistic models encourage a more nuanced approach to planning, which can be crucial in crafting policies that aim to secure the well-being of societies within the Earth's ecological boundaries."},{"instruction":"what is complex model i can create with population data from 1950 to 2021 and children under age 5, 1950 to 2100, population rate growth rate, 1950 to 2021, total deaths 1950 to 2021 and global fertility rate from 1950 to 2021","output":"Creating a complex model with population data involves the integration of multiple datasets and the application of sophisticated statistical methods. Here is an example of how you could create such a model using the data points you've mentioned: 1. **Cohort-Component Model**: This advanced demographic tool can project population changes and structure over time. It would factor in births, deaths, and migration for separate cohorts (age groups) using the data from 1950 to 2021. 2. **Age-Specific Fertility Rates (ASFR)**: Instead of using a single global fertility rate, you could apply age-specific fertility rates that take into account the fertility of different age cohorts. This could be combined with life table data to get a better estimate of the number of children women in different age groups are having over their lifetimes. 3. **Survival Analysis**: By using the number of children under age 5 from 1950 to 2100, you can incorporate survival analysis to estimate the probability that an individual in a given cohort will survive to their next birthday. Combined with total deaths data from the same period, this would enhance the accuracy of mortality assumptions in your model. 4. **Population Momentum**: Incorporate the concept of population momentum to model the lag effect of past high fertility rates on current population growth. This will help you anticipate future population size even if fertility rates drop to replacement level. 5. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: For adding stochastic elements to your model, apply Monte Carlo simulations to integrate uncertainty in fertility rates, mortality rates, and growth rates. This will yield a range of possible future scenarios, not just a single deterministic projection. 6. **Time Series Analysis**: Use time-series data on global fertility rates and population growth rates from 1950 to 2021 to forecast trends and test for stationarity or structural breaks in the series. Implement methods such as ARIMA models or exponential smoothing to capture potential trends, patterns, and seasonalities in the data. 7. **Environmental and Socioeconomic Variables**: Introduce variables like climate change impacts, resource availability, policy changes, economic development level, educational attainment, and health care advancements to account for the interactions between population growth and external factors. 8. **Feedback Loops**: Design the model to include feedback loops where population size and growth influence and are influenced by environmental carrying capacity, resource use, and technology, reflecting the interconnected nature of these systems. 9. **Machine Learning Approaches**: Use machine learning algorithms like neural networks or regression trees that can find non-linear patterns and interactions in complex, multi-dimensional data for more accurate predictive modeling. When constructing a complex model, you must also ensure the integrity of the data by checking for completeness, consistency, and accuracy. It's crucial to validate your model against historical data and to perform sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of uncertainty in your data and assumptions on your projections. Remember, the more sophisticated the model, the greater the need for expertise in both demographic methods and computational techniques to ensure that the insights drawn from the model are robust and applicable."},{"instruction":"read it write down everything to learn from it Chapter 1 Getting Rich Is Not a Fantasy How to become a millionaire or multi-millionaire or even hecta-millionaire (100 million units) isn’t taught in schools or colleges. In fact, most of society frowns on anyone who talks about getting rich; some even protest against those who have created financial independence. It’s a funny thing that schools teach you how to read and write, how to do math, how to know history and geography, and how to pass a test—but they never broach the subject of how to get rich. Getting super rich seems to be a topic reserved for fantasies, movies, and drunken what-if games. Most have come to believe that becoming a millionaire is for the lucky sperm club, business owners, gold diggers, lottery winners, athletes, rappers, and inventors. But it’s not true. Millionaires and the super rich come from all walks of life. In fact, just to debunk one of the myths, I’ll tell you that four out of five millionaires today work for someone else. The reason most people never get rich is that they never even consider it a possibility. They are convinced by those close to them to simply be satisfied with whatever their financial situation is. The other reason is that people fundamentally do not understand money. Very few people know how to get money, even fewer know how to keep it, and almost no one knows how to multiply it. Just look around and you will see signs of this everywhere. Even in one of the richest countries in the world, America, 76 percent of people live paycheck to paycheck, some 50 percent of Americans have no money for retirement, and 47 percent of Americans don’t have 8 400 for an emergency. If these statistics were true in a poor country, it would be one thing, but America is considered a wealthy country. “Very few people even know how to get money, even fewer know how to keep it,and almost no one knows how to multiply it.” Turn on the television or go online and you will see endless, ridiculous financial advice. Financial pundits suggest saving tricks where your path to wealth is finding the lowest price for a product or putting more air in your tires to save gas. This piece of advice always cracks me up: “If you don’t drink coffee out, you’ll save another 700 a year.” You can save 700 a year for the next fifty years and you won’t be rich, you’ll just be old. Another pundit preaches all debt is bad, and that by avoiding debt you will somehow be financially free. “Never borrow money under any circumstance,” the previously bankrupt advisor promotes. He overlooks the reality that almost all the super rich have used debt to multiply their wealth. Flip the channel and you’ll see fancy graphics making a case that you should turn your money over to the boys on Wall Street who, smarter than you, will invest in stocks, bonds, and financial instruments they can’t even explain. Ask your parents for money advice and they will recite their path: get a good job, buy a house, contribute to your 401k, be grateful you have more than most, and pray everything goes right. I have never wanted to just have “enough,” in fact, truth be known, I have always wanted to be rich. While I do believe in prayer, I don’t expect God to take care of my finances and I certainly don’t want to leave it up to everything “going right.” At a very young age, I noticed how the people who made the decisions and had the power of choice all seemed to be the people with 9 money. I wanted to be one of them. I didn’t want money for the sake of money, but to be able to have the power of choice. At the age of eight, one of my first experiences with money was walking to the local grocery store. I had a quarter in my pocket to spend at the store. I was excited, giddy, and I felt powerful. I was walking to the store with my brother fondling my quarter when I dropped it in the street and it rolled into a manhole. I got onto my hands and knees, only to discover my arms were too short to retrieve the quarter. I got up wet, dirty, angry, and wanting to cry. I remember going home and telling my father how I had lost my quarter. My father said to me, “You shouldn’t play with money.” My grandfather later grabbed me and said, “Son, the problem isn’t simply that you lost the quarter; the problem is that it was your only quarter.” Since that loss I have been fascinated with the idea of amassing enough money so no single event or loss would ever cause me to be without. 10 Chapter 2 Where You Get Your Advice Word of warning: for this to work you need to start being very selective about where you get your advice. Tell someone you are reading a book about how to get super rich and they will most likely tell you it’s impossible. Just try it right now, call a few friends and I assure you at least one of them will say, “Really? The only person who is going to get rich is the guy who wrote the book.” You see, part of the problem is that most get financial advice from people who are struggling with or who have given up on money. Most of the advice we get about money is from people close to us who either don’t have money or have given up on it. Some of the people you get advice from have never even thought financial freedom possible. You must look beyond the dumb advice of family, television pundits, blogs, get-rich articles, cute quotes on Instagram, and silly little sayings. Look beyond all the noise and confusion about money and you will discover a select group of people who have created enormous wealth. I am talking about the top percentile of the wealthiest people on planet earth. Like magnets of wealth and prosperity, they appear to magically prosper no matter what happens, some doing better in bad times than good times. These are the people you should study and model your financial journey on. Be very selective where you get your financial advice and never take advice from a quitter or a pretender. There are many pretenders out there and even more who have simply quit on financial freedom. 11 I tell you this because where I got my advice early on was mostly from observing my surroundings. I organically learned from my immediate environment and adopted the philosophies of those closest to me. I grew up in the middle class. My father worked very hard to create a middle class life for us and this was a big accomplishment for them. Both my mother and father were both brought up poor. My dad made it into the middle class, and shortly afterward he died at the young age of fifty-two. “Never take advice from a quitter or a pretender.” My mother had no knowledge of money and was left with the responsibility to raise five kids on just a little bit of money from my father’s life insurance. My mom was scared, even overwhelmed. Every day she was playing defense trying to figure out how to make ends meet. I felt powerless. I couldn’t help her, or so I thought. My mother’s mantras were, “Waste nothing,” “Turn off the lights,” “Only use what you need,” “Save everything,” and “Be grateful.” By the time I was sixteen, I was fed up watching my mother in a never-ending state of fear. One day I told her, “I am going to get rich someday so I don’t have to worry about money. When I do, I am going to help a lot of people.” My mother thought I was being an ungrateful brat, but I wasn’t. I wasn’t grateful because I hated how our life was and as a result I have spent the past forty years trying to change that for myself and others. Getting rich is a taboo topic in our society. Go outside and tell someone, “I am going to become super rich,” and they will think you are crazy. Get rich and then openly tell people, “I am rich,” and society will label you a greedy, gluttonous, elitist pig. Tell them you are poor and they will show you sympathy, but tell them you are rich and they will despise you. 12 The truth is, getting rich—even super rich—shouldn’t be taboo, it should be your battle cry. Last year I helped raise more than 100 million for charities. I remember a time when I couldn’t lend you a dollar, I was so broke. Getting rich is not only possible, it is vital to your survival and your ability to help those you love. We live on an economic planet. Every day, every one of us is confronted with money requirements and limitations: from shopping at the grocery store, to feeding yourself, to taking care of your kids and parents, to funding yourself through old age, to taking care of unexpected setbacks. “Getting rich—even super rich—shouldn’t be taboo, it should be your battle cry.” The entire subject of money is greatly misunderstood. What is money? Where did it come from? Who decides what it’s worth? What is enough? How do I invest it? When do I have enough to invest? Hell, most people don’t even know what they pay in taxes. Most people have more money saved when they are under the age of ten than when they get out of college. It’s crazy, when you think about it. How can a kid who knows nothing about money have more money than an adult with a degree? The reality is, most of us have incorrect knowledge about money from our upbringing. When you are brought up poor or middle class, you inherit the beliefs of the poor and the middle class. You’re stuck with their ideas. The simplicity of money and economics is not nearly as complicated as the schools, universities, economists, and financial channels make it out to be. Money, economics, and amassing financial freedom is actually very simple. For instance, anyone who tells you that money won’t make you happy never had enough money to know 13 whether it would or it wouldn’t. This idea is born from those who try to make sense of why they don’t have money. People justify it and try to make sense of their condition in life. For example, my mother clipped coupons as though her life depended on it because that was her only play. She spent all of her time justifying those actions. I remember when she visited me in Beverly Hills long after I had made it financially. We went grocery shopping together and I told her, “Mom, grab six of the artichokes.” She said in her southern accent, “OMG, son—I can buy those for one dollar less back home.” I told her, “Mom, make it a dozen since I can’t go broke one dollar at a time.” “Those brought up poor and middle class inherit the beliefs of the poor and the middle class.” You see, my mom was still stuck with the beliefs of the poor and middle class long after it mattered. That is what people do—they defend what they have done to survive and then get stuck in this lower, poor condition. Now, back to whether money will or will not make you happy. I can assure you money will not make you happy, nor will it make you unhappy. I have been happy and unhappy. I have been broke and I have been very rich. They have nothing to do with one another and whoever talks about them in the same conversation is someone justifying why they don’t have money. One additional note on this, from personal experience: if you are going to be unhappy, be as rich as possible. Financial freedom is two parts mental and one part mechanical. And you have to get your mental part right first. What I mean is that you probably need to lose your mind first, including many of the beliefs you were brought up with. For instance, getting rich is mostly a 14 game of offense, not defense like my mother taught me. Taking risks today is the way to eliminate risk, but you have to take risks at the right time. Your daddy’s advice was to always play defense with money. To get rich, you have to learn to be on offense most of the time, not defense. Wealth knows no age or sex, and it doesn’t care about your story—it shows no sympathy and has no feelings. It listens to no god. There is no age too young or too old: anyone can play the game, but you have to play the game of wealth on offense. “If you are going to be unhappy, be as rich as possible.” To win at the game of money, you have to be on the field as an offensive player first. Later, once you are way ahead in the game of money, you can play defense. If you want to get rich, you can’t stay on defense or be a spectator, and you need to have a strategy. All that being said, it has never been easier to get rich than it is today and never more important. Just last year, 500,000 households in America became millionaires. Are you ready to get rich? I am one of those people who figured out how to create wealth. I have become a millionaire hundreds of times over. I am telling you this to inspire you—you can do this. The wealth I have created was not because of my education; I totally wasted that. It wasn’t because of my connections; I destroyed them all. And it wasn’t because I was lucky; I have never been one of those. I also didn’t take a company public or create some cool invention or some fancy app. You hold in your hands information that will show you how to make and accumulate millions of dollars, even hundreds of millions of dollars. I would tell you this 15 booklet could make you a billionaire but I haven’t done that yet, so I will only make claims to what I have done for myself and for others. I only ask you to do three things: 1) Keep this booklet in your possession until you become a millionaire. 2) Share it with a friend. Here’s the link: MillionaireBooklet.com 3) Once you get yours, help others do the same. “Getting rich is mostly a game of offense, not defense.” 16 Chapter 3 Step 1: The Millionaire Decision As I said earlier, the biggest mistake is to think becoming a millionaire is impossible. People simply don’t think it can happen. So the first thing you have to do is decide to become a millionaire, multimillionaire, or billionaire if you want. You have to decide and then you must reinforce that decision, over and over. Put a stake in the ground right now: “I am going to become very, very rich.” I will not judge you negatively for making this decision. When you tell someone who has created wealth that you want to get rich, they will not frown or judge you negatively—they will pat you on the back and say something like, “Great, you can do it and, by the way, you should!” “Put a stake in the ground right now: “I am going to become very, very rich.” Those who have created wealth understand that creating financial freedom is a worthy adventure. Is it possible for anyone? Remember, more than 80 percent of all millionaires today are self-made, what’s called “first generational,” meaning they created their millions without inheriting the money. Now, before that little automatic voice in your head says for the millionth time, “I don’t want to be rich,” or, “I just want enough to be happy,” you should understand two points: 1) Getting rich isn’t just about you, and 2) Limiting yourself financially invalidates your abilities. Most of us are convinced to settle for basic necessities: clothes, a house, transportation, time off, maybe an upper-management position, and some money in the 17 bank. This is called the middle-class. The middle-class is for those who settle for just enough rather than striving for prosperity. The middle-class life is a compromise and it’s selfish. When you compromise your finances, you become unable to help others because you are struggling to simply take care of yourself. The other part of this is the constant invalidation of you! You are capable of way more than you know, so why set reasonable financial goals? For my entire life, I have had this constant gnawing in me that knows I can do more, achieve more, create more, give more, and help more. And I am most unhappy when I give up on that gnawing idea and most happy when I am pursuing it. “Settling for a middle class life is a compromise and it’s selfish.” But enough of the esoteric and back to the material world. You can earn 80,000 a year or 400,000 a year and still struggle, depending on where you live and your responsibility level. Just because someone makes more money than a person born in some starving village in a third-world country doesn’t mean they are much better off. The argument is, “You have a cellphone, internet access, running water, and electricity—be grateful.” That’s code for, “make sense of your situation.” But not having enough money doesn’t make sense. A man once told me, “How do you make sense of insanity? The answer is, you don’t!” And not having enough money is insane. The idea that someone would only need enough to be “comfortable” or “adequately satisfied” or “have more than others” as a way to justify his or her condition is ridiculous. The middle class is billions of people convinced by politicians and media to turn your money over to those smarter than them, settle down in a nice house (reducing your ability to move for the next thirty years), and be a civil, law-abiding taxpayer who is grateful how much better off you have it than those who have less. 18 “Not having enough money is insane.” Make a decision right now to become a millionaire and debunk all the ideas that idolize the mythology of the middle class. The temporary comfort provided by the house, nice school, a couple of BMWs, a 401k, and two weeks off is nothing compared to creating massive wealth. The first step to becoming a millionaire is to make a decision and that requires you lose your middle-class mind and then get your millionaire mindset. You must lose your small, defensive, take-no-risk thinking. It has never been easier to get rich, but it is still impossible if you don’t change your mind. There is so much money in the world today and so many ways to create wealth, but it will not happen if you settle. Many will disagree with me on this, but I believe millionaire is today’s new middle class. In fact, many millionaires still find themselves struggling. If you want to get really rich, you will need 10X or 20X or even 100X of a million dollars. “The first step to becoming super rich is decide and then you must lose your middle-class mind.” Use my 10X Planner and start affirming your multimillionaire status every morning, every night, and anytime you have a setback. Make the decision right now: “I am going to be very, very, very rich and I am going to help a lot of people in the process.” When you start to doubt the possibility, take out this little booklet and reread it and trust me to help you get there. You don’t need to trust yourself at this point—simply put your trust in someone who has done it. When I first started studying wealthy people, I put my trust in them because I could not yet trust myself. 19 Chapter 4 Step 2: Millionaire Math Your second step is to simply do the math. Did you know that most people will produce or be in contact with a million dollars in their lifetime? If you earn 50,000 a year for twenty years, you earn one million dollars. For any goal to be achievable, you must believe in its possibility as a realistic and doable goal. The way to do this is simply by doing Million Dollar Math. How many different ways can you collect one million dollars? You should figure all of them out. The purpose of this is to simplify the objective. In my bestselling webinar, “How to Become a Millionaire,” I used the example of sticky notes. How would you collect a million sticky notes? First, you would ask if there are a million sticky notes on planet earth. Second, you would ask who has them, and third, you’d ask, “What do I need to do to collect them?” Do the math to create possibility, then create strategy. Do the millionaire math and reinforce your millionaire possibility and your commitment to it. Wealth requires simple, basic math and any wealthy person will tell you this. After all getting to a million dollars is about numbers. But keep it simple. The best ideas are always simple. “Do the math to create possibility, then create strategy.” I know couples I have worked with who, after doing the math, looked at each other and realized how irresponsible they had been. “We never did the math!,” 20 the husband told his wife. The wife said, “There are so many ways to get there.” They could finally see what they had to do. Do the millionaire math. Keep it simple. The strategy will come after. Here are a few ways to a million dollars: Salary 50k x 20 years Salary 100k x 10 years Salary 250k x 4 years Earn 114 per hour, every hour of the year 5,000 people buy a 200 product 2,000 people buy a 500 product 10,000 people buy a 100 product 1,000 people buy a 1000 product 5,000 people pay 17 per month for 12 months 2,000 people pay 42 per month for 12 months 1,000 people pay 83 per month for 12 months 500 people pay 167 per month for 12 months 300 people pay 278 per month for 12 months Or do the bottom ten on this list and you’d earn 10 million in a year. 21 Chapter 5 Step 3: Increase Income Once you’ve done the math and realize how real it is to get super rich, you need focus on increasing your income streams. In the beginning, you simply set new income targets and then do whatever it takes to increase income, at first in increments, and then later in leaps. At twenty-five, when I was struggling to make 3,000 a month, I quit bitching and acting like a baby about my income and committed to increasing it. The first target I set for myself was to simply make another 3,000 per month. I did the math and it was 750 a week or 100 per day or 10 more per hour—it became real to me. I didn’t change jobs, even though I didn’t like my job. I used the job I had to learn how to grow my income. In the first month, I exceeded my target and made over 7,000 for the first time in my life, tracking for almost 84,000 a year if I could keep up that pace. I continued to focus on the simplicity of this and in the first twelve months I made almost 100,000. Not bad for twenty-six years old. I was super excited and realized how important increments and surges in income are to validating confidence and possibility. When you quit bitching about money and start taking responsibility for increasing your income, it’s amazing what happens and how quickly it can happen. Money seems to flow to those who give it the most attention and who take the most responsibility for it. 22 Money never found me when I was complaining about it. Ever notice that the people who bitch about money are those who are the most broke? “Money seems to flow to those who give it the most attention and take the most responsibility for it.” If you are in a sales position, then you know what you need to do. Sell more! If you are not in sales, then look for every way possible to add income. Don’t say you can’t, it’s a lie—anyone can create income. Go look for things you no longer want and put them up for sale. Don’t even worry about how much or little you sell them for, sell them and prove to yourself you can increase your income. Whatever you can’t sell, give away to charity and take a tax deduction. Instant tax credit is actually income in reverse, but I will save this calculation for a more in-depth book on wealth building. When you have nothing else to sell, go to your brother or sister’s house and take away all the things they no longer want and sell it online to increase your income. You could also get a second job waiting tables, giving massages, babysitting, pet sitting, teaching a language, driving for Uber, or panhandling. A family once asked me to coach them on their business and, due to financial troubles they were having, I proposed they start selling some of their personal property. The husband said, “These ideas seem so beneath us!” I reminded him, “What’s beneath you is living paycheck to paycheck and never having prosperity.” The broke groan, cry, belly-ache and moan while the rich take responsibility. If you want money, you must quit complaining, moping, crying, making excuses, and you have to drop the entitlement thing. Whatever it takes, you are going to create prosperity. 23 Complaining, moaning, and groaning will not increase your income. Make the commitment to create wealth, be ethical on your journey, and do whatever it takes until you achieve it. Let’s face it, being broke is unethical. When you commit you will find a way and it never means you have to be unethical. Send my company referrals and I will pay you. For every company you refer to me for our online product, Cardone University, I will pay 500 when we close the deal. Get me one a week and I’ll pay you 26,000 a year. Get me three a week and I will pay you 78,000 a year. Make 50,000 and I pay you another 78,000 in referral bonuses, I just cut the time it takes to get your first million dollars from twenty years to just under eight years. (Do the math. I saved you over 12 years.) Is that beneath you? “The broke bitch and moan while the rich take responsibility.” There are so many ways to increase your income today. From internet sales at home writing blogs, editing for authors, releasing a podcast, creating affiliate programs, joining great network-marketing companies, and on and on. By the way, everyone should be involved in network marketing. Just the fact that you get access to an instant network of like-minded people committed to improving their conditions is wealth creation! Now once you increase your income, then keep doing the math and keep increasing your income in increments until you can start increasing in surges. The surges will happen when you increase your skills and start making investments. I remember the first time I made 100,000 in a year. I was blown away. I never imagined that one day I would make a hundred thousand in a month! These are surges and they expand your potential and confidence in your abilities. Then I remember the first time I made 100k in a month—my confidence soared! 24 I continued growing my skills, doing the math, increasing my income and then one day, sure enough, I made 100k in a day and then I did that in an hour! I had to work up to this in increments until it was real to me. And no matter how much someone tries to tell you to simply think and grow rich, getting incremental income growth is vital to get your surges. But for sure, no one ever gets rich without increasing income first. Either you increase the income through investors or through the sale of products and services— or both. The creation of wealth, especially early on, is not about saving or investing—it’s about increasing your income flows. For those who believe you must own or operate a business to get rich—it is not true. In fact, three out of four millionaires work for someone else. To increase flows, you must operate like you are a business. The reality is you are a business you don’t start a business. And the value of your business, you, is based on your ability to produce income. My daughters, are four and seven years of age. Both can produce income at will by exchanging their unique values with those who might be willing to exchange money with them. They don’t need a business plan or a lemonade stand to increase income. They are a business in their own right. By the way, both of my children have more money put away than 50 percent of the US population. “You are a business, you don’t start a business.” 25 Chapter 6 Step 4: Who’s Got My Money? This is so simple, it’s amazing and it’s genius once you understand it. Simply ask yourself: “Who’s got my money?” People get into business and make a business plan and never ask this simple question. Make a list of who has your money, the money you want, and figure out what you can exchange with them. Whether you have a service, a product, or an idea, the question to ask yourself is always: “Who’s got my money?” You don’t need to make money, you need to connect with those who’ve already collected money, who have money, and exchange what you have (skills and knowledge) with what they have (money). Start investing most of, if not all of, your time with those people on your list. Get your millionaire mentality wrapped around this idea and spend every waking hour and all your energy on serving those who need what you have. At the age of twenty-nine, when I started my first company I spent all of my time getting in front of people who could buy my product and spent almost no time with those who couldn’t and/or wouldn’t. My wife and I recently were at a conference and I reminded her, “Elena, there are only four to six people we need to meet here.” When my staff travels with me to a convention I remind them, “Be nice to everyone but remember we are here to meet people who have our money.” This must be your foremost focus. If you don’t do this, you will miss opportunities and waste time with people who cannot and will not buy or invest in your ideas. 26 I sound like a bad, selfish and greedy man, don’t I? Well, no one calls me a bad man when the bill comes for dinner and I pick it up. No one thinks I am selfish when they need a loan and I’m the only one that can help them because I am liquid. When you want to start a new business with me and I provide the funding, you will be glad I am focused on my finances. This is just the hard, cold simple fact of building wealth—follow the money, as they say. If you spend all your time with people who can’t pay you will end up being someone who can’t pay. “Who’s got my money,” is one of the most powerful concepts in the creation of wealth and time. “If you spend all your time with people who can’t pay you will end being someone who can’t pay. ” That being said the more people you can help, the more money you will have. If you want to make a billion dollars, simply help a billion people. The people who need the most help on this planet don’t have much money. So they will need you to have money to invent the solutions to help them. Figure out a way to get help to a billion people, and you will likely end up with way more than a billion dollars. And you will end up with more than money, you’ll end up with true wealth, friends, support, love, legacy and worldwide admiration. But let’s be clear, you aren’t going to help a billion people without either having money or finding someone who does! So ask yourself, “Who’s got my money?” And keep asking until you have answers. Once you commit to this concept fully, the money will follow like magic. If you are one of those people who doesn’t like to talk to people because you tell yourself you are an introvert or you’re shy, get over it. Remind yourself you don’t like just getting by or being broke either. When your goals 27 are big enough, you will quit telling yourself lies and making lame excuses. You’re not going to become rich from your closet, garage or your living room. It doesn’t happen. Every one of those garage billionaires got rich when they finally left the garage to sell their idea, invention or product. “When your goals are big enough, you will quit telling yourself lies and making lame excuses.” On my way from being broke to banking my first 5 million, all I focused on was, “Who’s got my money?” I was traveling 300 days a year for over six years knocking on the doors of prospective buyers (investors) of my business idea. I provided a service and they exchanged their money with me. I hated every moment of it. It was not something I wanted to do, liked to do, and I had to gut up everyday to do it. I did thousands of free meetings around the US and Canada, traveling at my own expense to make myself known, and find opportunities to get in front of qualified buyers in hopes I could raise money to sell my product and increase income. Billionaire Mark Cuban was quoted saying, “The most important thing you must learn about any business is sales.” Sales made simple is, “Who’s got my money?” Once you commit to asking this question, you will want to learn how to master sales and I can help you at CardoneUniversity.com. For now, make a list of who is qualified and make yourself known to them. If you have a money shortage, it is because you are investing your time with the wrong people and you’re not applying, “Who’s got my money?” There is no shortage of money on this planet, so if you have none, it’s about some deficiency you have regarding money. Time invested on, “Who’s got my money?” will always, always, always result in money. 28 If you are getting in front of those who have money and coming away without it, you have to join me at CardoneUniversity.com and I will help you resolve those deficiencies. But first, ask yourself, “Who’s Got My Money?” 29 Chapter 7 Step 5: Stay Broke When you start increasing your income, stay broke. I said broke—not poor. I have a policy to never, ever have money sitting around. Once I start increasing income, I immediately moved the surpluses to sacred accounts that were out of my reach and marked for future investments. As soon as I started increasing my income, I went to my employer and told him to withdraw 40 percent of my gross pay before taxes and direct deposit those funds into personal accounts I had set up. They said they couldn’t do that. I said, “You do it for the IRS, you can do it for me.” I set up three savings accounts, which I labeled something special, and treated these as sacred future investment accounts. (Never use 401k for these funds.) I remember when I first heard Michael Douglas say in the movie Wall Street, “Money doesn’t sleep.” I thought to myself, “But it gets bored!” I knew from watching other people handle money that when money sits around it gets spent, wasted, and blown. Because I didn’t fully trust myself to have cash sitting around, as soon as I created these surplus monies I directed all of it to accounts reserved to make future investments and create future passive income flows. At the time I was twenty-six years old when I started this, which allowed me to fund my first business, my second business, and my real estate company. But the real benefit of this strategy was it forced me to continue to produce and out-work my earlier results. There were 30 months when I was making more money than I ever made and I would push the entire surplus into my sacred accounts. When I did this I couldn’t pay my rent even though I was making more money than I’d ever made. I was forced to negotiate with my landlord for an extension of my rent. It was weird because everyone knew I was doing well, but I never had money. I was broke, not poor, and it worked. This state of staying broke forced me to continue producing new revenue. I had seen so many people have financial success, then quit doing what created their success and then go backward financially. Staying broke forced me to keep reinforcing the actions that had already proven successful. It seems human beings perform best out of necessity. Studying the super successful, and those who are not, I noticed huge differences. It is bizarre how the wealthy work like they are broke and those who need money the most don’t. Still today I watch the pretenders sleep like they are rich while I am up like I am broke. We both deceive ourselves but with very different outcomes. I spent thirty years deceiving myself like this and one day I woke up and realized I had more money than I could ever spend. Even today I go to sleep and wake up like I am broke and push for the next level, aware that things beyond my control could possibly, unlikely, put my finances at risk. The same will happen to you. An idea plus hard work multiplied over long periods of time plus discipline will always equal success. There just comes a point in time when, well, you will be super rich and almost nothing can change that condition. But you have to put in the work. Ideas are great but they mean nothing without hard work over time plus discipline. 31 Idea + Hard Work x Time + Discipline = Success At the age of twenty-five I had made real commitment to getting rich, I took my first idea and worked very hard every day to make it happen over long periods of time, exercising extreme discipline. This created success in the beginning, allowing me to have a little extra money. Then I duplicated this cycle using money. Saving money and adding work over long periods of time and using discipline with the money will create financial success. I invested the money in savings accounts while working my main business and spending none of the surplus money (discipline) on stuff. I then prepared to reinvest the surplus monies to create new businesses and new, in fact multiple, income flows. From twenty-five to the age of fifty-one, there was no alcohol, parties, showing off, exotic cars, only one watch, and almost no vacations. Without knowing what my second business might be or even what I would invest in, I continued to prepare myself for the day when I would expand. Stay broke, not poor, deprive yourself now for the possibility of financial freedom in the future. Or more poetically, pay the price today so you can pay any price tomorrow. A guy recently asked me, “Why are you still working so hard?” I didn’t want to go into a long philosophical explanation of how I am preparing for a major economic meltdown as I knew he was just being social, so I told him how much I loved my work in hopes to let it go at that. Then he started saying dumb stuff like, “You only live once you know.” And then he topped it off with, “I never see you at the club anymore.” I got bored with him, so I patted him on the shoulder and said, “You never see me at the club, and I never see you at the bank!” “Pay the price today so you can pay any price tomorrow.” 32 Chapter 8 Step 6: Save to Invest, Don’t Save to Save Investing money is how you will get super rich. The only reason to save money is to one day invest money. I was brought up believing you should save money for emergencies, retirement, and that rainy day event. All those books I read about had wealthy people saving to make investments not to just simply save. Since the age of 26, I have been saving so one day I could invest and expand, not simply to have some disaster or emergency I could fund. My first investment was when I was thirty-one years old. I had been saving for six years and operating like I was broke. A guy came to me after one of my seminars and had the idea to create a hands-on, in-house training company in which a team of people would go into a company and put new sales procedures in place to increase sales. I told him, “I will loan the new company 50,000, it has to be paid back in ninety days, I get a salary for my information and a percentage of profits, and I will never lend you another dime if you can’t pay me back in ninety days—so make it work.” At that time, I only had a couple hundred grand saved but my main income, my speaking career, had proved itself very dependable and was growing at the time. I liked the idea because it was a symbiotic business, connected to my first one. Meaning I didn’t have to take my attention off the first company to grow the second one and the first business would feed the second one. My new partner paid me back in ninety days and the new company paid me as much in the first year as my first business did. That’s what I call surges or spikes, not just incremental income growth. 33 My third company was created a couple of years after the second business. I was thirty-five years old and had been studying real estate for almost five years. I had looked at hundreds of apartment buildings over that time and never had the courage to buy one. I finally pulled the trigger on my first deal. The deal was a forty-eight unit apartment building in Vista, California for 1.95 million and it required 350,000 for a down payment. That was a third of my total sacred accounts. I knew it was a good deal and I did it. It took me six years to find it and when I did I moved with speed on it. It cash-flowed in month one and every month after that. Ninety days later, I bought my second deal, thirty-eight units in Point Loma, California for 3 million. Three years later, I sold both properties and made over 5 million, while earning 100,000 a year in positive cash. That 850,000 investment netted me 5,300,000—a 600 percent return. Eight years of staying broke, eight years of staying on offense to strengthen my first and second business, while safeguarding my sacred savings accounts set me up so that one day I could make a significant investment. That was the first time I made a million dollars at one time and in this case, it was 5 million in one swing. The truth is it took years of discipline, knowledge and courage to be in a position to seize the opportunity—not a lucky break. Most people aren’t equipped to take advantage of moments because they don’t have the money, they don’t have the knowledge or the courage. People don’t create wealth because they never invest enough in a deal to get a big payoff. Significant wealth creators make big plays, not little ones. To do this, you must have surpluses of cash and confidence. When you know it’s the right thing, go all in fast. Speed is power. When you do, you are going to exhaust your sacred accounts you had been building. At those times, you must have complete confidence in the investment and in your previous income flows so that, if the investment takes longer to work or even fails, you 34 still can rely on your earlier flows of income. Sometimes I will go years without investing in a new business and simply focus on making my current businesses stronger. I don’t gamble with money, I invest it and I want sure things. That means I need to know what I am doing and the investment should be a no-brainer. I literally go through every possible worst-case scenario calculation and if I can still make money, I go all in. When I do, I am willing to go broke and exhaust all my cash knowing I am not putting my family or those who depend on me at risk because the earlier income flows can support us. “People never create wealth because they never invest enough in a deal to get a big payoff.” Last year, rather than buying more real estate, I invested in a jet, a Gulfstream 200. The real estate market at that time seemed overpriced to me and I couldn’t make sense of buying more the way I calculate deals. I went broke again paying for the jet, forcing me to keep hustling. I justified the purchase believing it would get me in front of more customers and help me grow my existing businesses (income). Almost anyone will tell you a jet is a terrible investment. Ask any accountant and they will all tell you it’s a terrible investment. But none of them can buy a jet, either. Ask anyone who owns a jet and they will tell you, “Nothing about buying a jet makes financial sense until you understand the value of time.” I paid for the jet the first year I owned it because it allowed me to get in front of more qualified customers in shorter periods of time and I continue to repeat the formula of increasing income, saving to invest and grow in increments and surges preparing for future investments. “Nothing about buying a jet makes financial sense until you understand the value of time.” 35 Chapter 9 Step 7: Multiple Flows of Income Poor people try to replace flows of money while rich people are trying to supplement (add) flows. Creating multiple flows of income is the holy grail of creating financial freedom and true wealth. At twenty-five years of age, I was complaining about how little money I was making. Today, I have over fifty streams of income from five different companies excluding a handful of stocks and mutual funds which I despise. Some of those flows are from the first business that I still own and operate. Some are little drips and some are like fire hoses. The flows all require different levels of attention. Some require tremendous energy, and others are much more passive flows. I appreciate and value them all and I never complain about any of them. Complaining about your money situation never seems to make you more money. The most common mistake people make when creating multiple flows of income is walking away from the current one. The next most common mistake is moving to secondary flows that are not similar to the first and then being unable to give both proper attention. When creating your second flow of income, make sure to closely connect something parallel or symbiotic to your current flow and never abandon the first flow. For instance, if you work at a company and earn a salary, keep improving on what you do for that company and look for ways to create a second flow parallel to what you are currently doing. Do it within the company you work for during the time you are at work. 36 “Complaining about your money situation never seems to make you more money.” Most people start a second flow outside of their work, get excited about it, start ignoring the first one, and then end up with one flow again. And then the second one they moved to is weaker than the first one ever was. When you add a second flow, make a commitment to never ignore the first one. If you join a network marketing company, use it to supplement your first flow (both ways) until at some time in the future you can step away from it and never miss it or have someone else manage it for you. Also, make the flows work both ways. Make your new network of people familiar with the first company where you are working and flow business back and forth, strengthening both flows and both companies. Robert S. has a salaried job creating video content in my office. He was making 45,000 a year with my internet department. He listened to my advice and took on a second flow selling and earning commissions bringing that up to 90,000 a year. Then, he added a third flow by creating ad revenue for the GrantCardoneTV.com and produces another 45,000 a year for himself. I call this parallel or symbiotic flows because they work with what he is doing already. He didn’t seek another job outside of work, he figured out how to create two more flows from the same position during the same period of time and uses his time off for self-improvement so he continues to be brighter, faster and more confident in his abilities so he can continue to expand. Never turn your back on the primary flows until, if ever, the latter flows are so strong that nothing can possibly destroy or erode them. Even then, you should think long and hard before walking away from any income flow— no matter how small. The same thing holds true when growing your customer base. Never turn your back on customers who got you to where you are now. There comes a time when it does make sense to walk away, but it should be the exception—not the rule. 37 When I was selling cars I tapped out on how much I could sell, I looked for other things I could do within the dealership to increase my income and to help my customers and the dealer. I learned how to finance the car as well as sell them. Everyone won! The finance manager didn’t want to stay late, the dealer didn’t have to pay someone else a salary, the customer was taken care of by your boy GC, and I earned extra money— ultimately making myself more valuable to the company, the customers and myself. “Never abandon the first flow.” Nothing creates financial confidence more than multiple strong flows of income. I have a billionaire friend who invested in my real estate portfolio. I remember when I sent him a check for 9,000. He called me and said, “GC, that was a nice little check you sent me today— good job.” Nine thousand dollars and the guy is worth 3,400,000,000. Crazy, right? To create multiple streams of income requires commitment and especially discipline in how you use your time and money. While this all seems oversimplified, simple works, and complex almost never works. This is a rule I have used for years by the way with building my business and my companies. Simple works. First, increase your income, then add to your income by starting a second symbiotic flow, expanding on that thing you are already doing. Bank all additional money so that one day you can make investments. Know what you are investing in until it is not a gamble or a risk but a sure thing! This investment should create new flows and new wealth which will allow you to make new investments that will create additional, more passive, flows of income while never taking attention off the earlier ones. And one day buy a jet so you can continue to go where you want when you want and continue the process and be the guy who gives the million dollars to charity! 38 Chapter 10 Step 8: Repeat, Reinforce and Hyperfocus You can, and should, be a millionaire. You can be a billionaire, deca-billionaire, or richer if you simply think bigger from the start and then hyperfocus, and repeat the steps I have laid out. Regardless of what others suggest, getting rich doesn’t just happen and it comes with lots of challenges. You will have to give up something, probably many things. The first thing you will have to give up is your middle-class mind. The next thing you will give up is what everyone else thinks is fun. For twenty-five years of my life, I paid the price. While others were traveling, taking holidays, playing golf, and going on adventures, I was either building financial success or preparing myself to do so. The first sign you are on your way is when the people close to you start to question why you are working so hard. They’ll say, “We never see you anymore,” “What’s happened to you?,” “You never have time for us anymore,” and on and on. When you start your wealth adventure, many will try to convince you it’s not worth it. Some will tell you it is impossible. It is worth it. It is possible. And it is important! Your wealth adventure will be complicated by a new awareness that you are short on skills. Early on, I realized how little I knew about how to connect with people, network, communicate, build rapport, and how little confidence I had. I didn’t know how to sell, market, promote, build value, negotiate, close deals, or follow up customers. I couldn’t handle disappointment and rejection and I wasn’t even dealing with money yet. 39 For the first time in my life, I started investing in myself. I committed to learning and studying. Because I didn’t like to read I even took courses on How to Study that were amazing and allowed me to learn anything—and like doing it! One of your early steps is learning how to increase your income (step 3) and then who’s got my money (step 4) and this is where most people fail. I was spending 10 hours a day minimum at work six days a week on these two simple things and the rest of the time on self-improvement and building the skills I was deficient in. As I started having success using my new knowledge, I immediately experienced a renewed sense of confidence and belief in myself. For the first time in my life, I felt really, really good about myself. I started feeling confident with my abilities and became even more committed to success. Those around me became more critical of my new focus. This will happen to you and you need to be ready for it. You are the only one who has changed, so expect this because when you change you may be a threat to them. I remember when I started working on myself and a girl I was dating said, “Don’t change, I love you just the way you are.” I thought to myself, “This isn’t about you, it’s about me and what I want.” My commitment to my self-improvement had become a threat to her unwillingness to self-improve. “When you change you may become a threat to all those who don’t.” If you truly are committed to becoming a millionaire, you will at some point need to change your environment, and by that I mean your friends and family. That doesn’t mean you need to get rid of people—it just means you need to add new people. The old friends will just fall off as they will lose interest in you. You will be annoying to them. If you want to make it into the club of wealth, you must add new connections and that means you need 40 to reach up, not sideways and not down. If you don’t change your surroundings, you will not make it! Make a list of people in your city that are super successful, on the move, who are interested in personal growth, active in charities, who invest time to improve the quality of their lives, and are not just complaining all the time. These are the people you should surround yourself with. I am one of those people. My wife, my kids, and the people who work at my companies are all committed to improving ourselves and helping others be the best they can be and achieve financial freedom. People committed to success want other people to be successful. People committed to the status quo want to be surrounded by the status quo. If you don’t have the kinds of people around you that you want, go get them. One way to find the right people is to continue investing in yourself. Go to conferences, meetings, join mastermind groups, and network marketing groups. Don’t spend time and money on things, toys, holidays, or moments, invest in the surest investment of your life – YOU. When it comes to your self-improvement and education, spend whatever you must. If you must borrow money to make yourself better—do it. Remember you are not just trying to pay the bills anymore, you are playing to become a millionaire, even super rich if you want. Find the technologies that can help you unleash the real potential in you. When you implement these eight simple steps, I can promise you a few things: 1) It will be harder than you think. 2) It will be easier than you think. 3) You will achieve way more than you imagined possible. In case you are wondering, can anyone get rich? I don’t 41 know if anyone can, but I doubt just anyone will pick up this book and even fewer will keep it with them every day. I know you can make it if you simply do what is laid out here. Remember to keep the Millionaire Booklet in your possession until you reach your first million away—and when you do, make me the first person you contact.

Here are several key reasons: 1. Imperial Expansion and Militarism: Japan had imperial ambitions similar to the European powers. The nation sought to expand its territory to secure access to raw materials and resources (such as oil, rubber, and iron ore) and to gain new markets for its goods. At the time, Japan's military leaders and government viewed empire-building as a means for national survival and prosperity. 2. Economic Pressures: Japan's home islands lacked many natural resources necessary for industrialization and sustained economic growth. By the 1930s, Japan had already taken control of Korea and Manchuria and was looking to further expand its control over territories in Southeast Asia to secure these resources. 3. Nationalism: A strong sense of nationalism and desire for international prestige encouraged aggressive policies. Many in Japan felt the country deserved to be treated as a great power, and they sought to assert this status through territorial acquisition. 4. Fear of Western Domination: Japan felt encroached upon by Western imperial powers, such as the British Empire, the United States, and colonial powers in Asia, which had already established significant footholds in Asia. This drove a desire to assert its own influence and to preemptively protect itself from being dominated or colonized. 5. Ideology: The government, influenced significantly by military leaders, promoted the concept of the \\"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,\\" a bloc of Asian nations led by Japan ostensibly meant to be free of Western influence. In practice, this meant Japanese-dominated regions that would serve Japanese interests. 6. Political Structure: The government of Japan during the 1930s saw a rise in influence of the military within the political hierarchy. This led to more aggressive and expansionist foreign policy decisions, as the military advocated for direct confrontation and acquisition of territory. 7. International Incidents: Certain events, like the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 (which sparked the Second Sino-Japanese War) and the U.S. oil embargo against Japan in 1941 (in response to Japanese aggression in Southeast Asia), further escalated tensions and pushed Japan toward war. 8. Pearl Harbor and the Alignment with Axis Powers: Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a strategic move designed to neutralize the United States' Pacific Fleet and to secure Japanese dominance in the Pacific. Japan had aligned with Germany and Italy, believing that a swift strike and the conquer of Southeast Asia would provide enough resource security to withstand a protracted conflict. These factors, among others, contributed to the militaristic mindset and series of events that led Japan to engage in hostilities during World War II. It's important to remember that the decision for war was complex and multi-faceted, with many actors and competing interests at play."},{"instruction":"more","output":"Certainly, delving deeper into the historical context and specifics can provide a more nuanced understanding of why Japan entered World War II: **Economic Strain and International Relations:** After World War I, Japan experienced significant economic growth, becoming an industrial and military power. However, the Great Depression of the 1930s hit Japan hard, causing commodity prices to fall and unemployment to rise. Japan's government sought to alleviate the economic pressure through territorial expansion and the establishment of a self-sufficient bloc in Asia, where Japan could have an unchallenged sphere of influence and access to markets and resources. **Political Ideologies and the Military:** The political ideology prevalent among Japanese military leaders at the time was heavily influenced by the concept of *kokutai*—a unique combination of national essence, cultural identity, and divine right of the emperor. Within this context, the military came to believe that Japan was destined to lead Asia and resist Western imperialism, which was seen as a threat to traditional Asian values and to Japan's rightful place as a regional leader. **The Role of Military Government:** The Japanese political system was such that civilian government often deferred to military judgment on issues of national security. As the military garnered more influence, its officers began to see war as not only inevitable but also as a means for Japan to achieve its destiny. During the 1930s, military factions often acted independently in aggressive ways, such as the occupation of Manchuria in 1931, without official government sanction. **Ultra-nationalism and Education:** Nationalistic sentiment was further fueled by an educational system that emphasized loyalty to the state and emperor. The populace was brought up with a strong sense of national pride and a willingness to support the state's endeavors, including military expansion. **The China Question:** In the quest for resources and markets, Japan clashed with Chinese nationalist and communist forces. The Second Sino-Japanese War, starting in 1937, consumed vast amounts of resources and became a quagmire, but withdrawing from China was considered untenable due to the invested resources and the face-saving principle. **Strategic Concerns:** The U.S. Naval expansion in the Pacific, as well as the Philippines becoming an American commonwealth, was seen as an encirclement of Japan and a direct challenge to its ambitions. Also, the U.S. embargo on oil and other critical resources in response to Japanese aggression in China and Indochina threatened to strangle the Japanese economy and military. **The Decision for War:** The attack on Pearl Harbor was both a strategic and tactical decision aimed at securing the Western Pacific, knocking the United States back long enough for Japan to consolidate its gains and compel a negotiated peace from a stronger position. The idea was to secure the \\"defensive perimeter\\" and access to oil in Southeast Asia. **Miscalculation and Overconfidence:** Japanese leaders significantly underestimated the United States' industrial capacity, resolve, and ability to mobilize for war. They believed that a swift, devastating blow would be enough to secure their objectives and bring the U.S. to the negotiating table. This proved to be a major miscalculation. In summary, Japan's path to war in World War II was complex and involved a series of deep-seated economic woes, aggressive expansionist policies, the dominance of military thinking over civilian governance, ideological adherence to imperial and nationalistic values, and a significant underestimation of the response their actions would provoke from the United States and other powers."},{"instruction":"Which conferences are considered tier 1, known for their prestigious status and significant impact within the academic community?

Keepalive settings are used to detect dead connections by sending packets periodically to the peer. If no response is received, the connection is considered dead and closed. To view the current keepalive settings, you can issue the following command in the terminal: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp \`\`\` This will display all the TCP related settings, including keepalive ones. The parameters related to TCP keepalive typically include: - \`net.inet.tcp.keepidle\`: The time (in milliseconds) the connection needs to be idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes. - \`net.inet.tcp.keepintvl\`: The interval (in milliseconds) between individual keepalive probes. - \`net.inet.tcp.keepcnt\`: The number of keepalive probes TCP will send before dropping the connection. To change these settings, you can use the \`sysctl\` command with the \`-w\` flag. For example, to set the idle time before sending keepalive probes to 7200000 milliseconds (2 hours), you can run: \`\`\`sh sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.keepidle=7200000 \`\`\` And to make these changes permanent across reboots, you need to add them to the \`/etc/sysctl.conf\` file: \`\`\`sh echo \\"net.inet.tcp.keepidle=7200000\\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf \`\`\` Remember to replace \`7200000\` with the value you want to set for your environment. Please note that altering keepalive settings can affect your network performance and also the behavior of applications that rely on TCP keepalive. It's essential to understand the implications and test changes in a controlled environment before deploying them to a production system."},{"instruction":"what's tcp.keepinittime?","output":"The \`tcp.keepinittime\` sysctl setting refers to the initial time before the first keepalive probe is sent. However, this specific setting does not exist in OpenBSD as of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023. Instead, OpenBSD and many other Unix-like operating systems typically use the following TCP keepalive-related settings: - \`net.inet.tcp.keepidle\`: The amount of time, in seconds, that a connection must be idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes. - \`net.inet.tcp.keepintvl\`: The interval, in seconds, between successive keepalive probes if the peer has not responded to the previous keepalive probe. - \`net.inet.tcp.keepcnt\`: The number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection. If you're working with a different operating system or a specific application that refers to \`tcp.keepinittime\`, you may need to consult that system's or application's documentation for the correct usage and description of the setting. For OpenBSD, you can adjust the keepalive settings that do exist using \`sysctl\`, as described in a previous answer. For example, to change the \`net.inet.tcp.keepidle\` value to 2 hours (7200 seconds): \`\`\`sh sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.keepidle=7200 \`\`\` Make sure to use the exact parameter names that are available on your OpenBSD system. You can always check the available sysctl settings by running: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp \`\`\` This will list all the TCP-related settings and their current values. To make any changes persistent across reboots, add the corresponding entries to the \`/etc/sysctl.conf\` file."},{"instruction":"why don't keepalives probes be sent?","output":"There are several reasons why TCP keepalive probes might not be sent as expected: 1. **Keepalive Not Enabled**: By default, TCP keepalive is often disabled. An application has to explicitly request keepalive probes for them to be sent. This is done by setting the \`SO_KEEPALIVE\` socket option. 2. **Long Keepalive Timeouts**: If the TCP keepalive settings have very long timeout values (\`keepidle\`, \`keepintvl\`), it might appear as though keepalive probes are not being sent, because the idle time required to trigger them hasn't been reached yet. 3. **Active Traffic**: Keepalive probes are designed to detect idle connections. If there is regular traffic on the connection, keepalive packets will not be sent since the regular traffic keeps the session active. 4. **Intermittent Traffic**: If intermittent traffic occurs frequently enough to reset the keepalive timer, it might prevent the keepalive probe from being sent, because the connection is never considered idle for long enough. 5. **Network Devices**: Intermediate network devices such as firewalls, routers, and proxies may interfere with or drop keepalive packets, preventing them from reaching the peer. 6. **Peer Response**: If the peer system actually responds to the keepalive packets, even if it's otherwise unresponsive to application-level requests, the TCP stack will consider the connection alive, and no further action will be taken. 7. **System or Network Configuration**: Some operating systems or network configurations may have keepalive parameters set to very high values or disabled entirely, due either to policy or oversight. 8. **Socket State**: The socket must be in a state that expects keepalive probes (e.g., ESTABLISHED). If the socket is in a state like CLOSE_WAIT, FIN_WAIT, etc., keepalive won't be operational. 9. **Application Bug**: The application in question might have a bug or may not correctly handle keepalive, leading to keepalive probes not being used effectively. 10. **Kernel Bug or Limitation**: Very rarely, there could be a bug or limitation in the kernel's TCP/IP stack implementation that's preventing keepalive packets from being sent, though this would be quite unusual. If you suspect keepalive probes are not being sent when they should be, you can troubleshoot the issue by checking the current system configuration, verifying application socket options, monitoring network traffic, and considering any intervening network components that could be affecting the connection. Tools like \`tcpdump\` or \`wireshark\` can be useful to confirm if keepalive packets are being transmitted on the network."},{"instruction":"How to enable SO_KEEPALIVE socket option on openbsd?","output":"To enable the \`SO_KEEPALIVE\` socket option on OpenBSD, you'll need to set this option programmatically on your TCP sockets within your application's source code. This typically involves using the \`setsockopt\` function, which is part of the Berkeley sockets API. Here is an example in C demonstrating how to enable \`SO_KEEPALIVE\` on a socket: \`\`\`c #include <sys/types.h> #include <sys/socket.h> // Assuming 'sockfd' is your socket file descriptor int optval = 1; // A non-zero value to enable the option socklen_t optlen = sizeof(optval); if (setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_KEEPALIVE, &optval, optlen) == -1) { perror(\\"setsockopt\\"); // handle the error } else { // The keepalive option was successfully set } \`\`\` You should include this code after you have created the socket but before you have initiated the connection (for a client socket) or before you start accepting connections (for a server socket). Keep in mind that the snippet above is written in C, which is a common language for system-level programming on Unix-like systems, including OpenBSD. If you are programming in a different language, the syntax to set the \`SO_KEEPALIVE\` option will be different but the underlying system call made by the high-level language's runtime will ultimately be similar. No matter what language you are writing your code in, refer to your language's socket programming documentation for more specific instructions on setting socket options. It is also possible to adjust the behavior of keepalive probes on a per-system basis using sysctl variables on OpenBSD. This doesn't enable \`SO_KEEPALIVE\` on any particular socket, but changes the timing and behavior of keepalive features for all sockets where it is enabled: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp.keepidle=7200000 # Set the time (ms) before starting probes sysctl net.inet.tcp.keepintvl=75000 # Set the interval (ms) between probes sysctl net.inet.tcp.keepcnt=8 # Set the count of unacknowledged probes before declaring the connection dead \`\`\` To make these changes permanent, add them to \`/etc/sysctl.conf\`: \`\`\`sh echo \\"net.inet.tcp.keepidle=7200000\\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf echo \\"net.inet.tcp.keepintvl=75000\\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf echo \\"net.inet.tcp.keepcnt=8\\" >> /etc/sysctl.conf \`\`\` To check whether these settings are appropriately set, you can use: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp.keepidle sysctl net.inet.tcp.keepintvl sysctl net.inet.tcp.keepcnt \`\`\` These settings will be applied to all sockets where \`SO_KEEPALIVE\` has been enabled."},{"instruction":"how to block lo interface on openbsd with pffilter?","output":"To block traffic on the loopback interface (\`lo0\`) on OpenBSD using \`pf\` (Packet Filter), you can add a rule to the \`/etc/pf.conf\` file. However, be very cautious when doing this because blocking the loopback interface can disrupt many services and applications that rely on local inter-process communication. 1. First, open the \`/etc/pf.conf\` file with your favorite text editor. You will need root privileges to edit this file: \`\`\`sh doas vi /etc/pf.conf \`\`\` Alternatively, you can use \`nano\` or any other editor of your choice. 2. Add the following rule to block all traffic on the \`lo0\` interface: \`\`\`pf block on lo0 \`\`\` 3. After editing the \`pf.conf\` file and saving your changes, you need to reload the \`pf\` rules to apply them: \`\`\`sh doas pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf \`\`\` Again, please be cautious about blocking traffic on the loopback interface, as it might disrupt system operations. Services like DNS lookups (if you have a local resolver), inter-process communications, and some local applications rely on this interface even if there's no external network communication.

To block and unblock the loopback interface (\`lo0\`) from the command line, you would do the following: # To Block Traffic on the Loopback Interface 1. Add a rule to the \`pf\` ruleset to block traffic on the loopback interface: \`\`\`sh doas pfctl -sr -f - <<< \\"block on lo0\\" \`\`\` This command pipes a rule into \`pfctl\`, which flushes the current ruleset and applies the new rule. The rule will block all traffic on the \`lo0\` interface. # To Unblock Traffic on the Loopback Interface 1.

Here are the TCP states where keepalive probes are **not** sent: 1. **LISTEN**: Waiting for a connection request from any remote TCP and port. 2. **SYN-SENT**: Waiting for a matching connection request after having sent a connection request. 3. **SYN-RECEIVED**: Waiting for a confirming connection request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a connection request. 4. **FIN-WAIT-1**: Waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent. 5. **FIN-WAIT-2**: Waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP. 6. **CLOSE-WAIT**: Waiting for a connection termination request from the local user. 7. **CLOSING**: Waiting for a connection termination request acknowledgment from the remote TCP. 8. **LAST-ACK**: Waiting for an acknowledgment of the connection termination request previously sent to the remote TCP (which includes an acknowledgment of its connection termination request). 9. **TIME-WAIT**: Waiting for enough time to pass to be sure the remote TCP received the acknowledgment of its connection termination request. 10. **CLOSED**: No connection state at all. Keepalive probes are typically sent in the following state: - **ESTABLISHED**: The normal state for the data transfer phase of the connection. To summarize, keepalive probes are usually sent only when the connection is in the ESTABLISHED state, and both sides are idle - not sending any data. The keepalive mechanism is therefore intended to maintain and verify connectivity when there is no activity on a connection, but both endpoints still consider it established and open.

If a certain number of these probes fail to receive an acknowledgment from the connected peer, the connection is considered broken and will be closed. Here are scenarios where a connection might be closed due to missing keepalive probes: 1. **Network Issues**: If there is a network failure between the two hosts, such as a router crash or a network partition that prevents packets from being delivered, the keepalive probes will not receive a response. 2. **Server/Client Crash**: If the server or client crashes and stops responding to packets without properly closing the connection, keepalive probes will not be acknowledged. 3. **Firewall or NAT Device Timeout**: Some firewalls or NAT (Network Address Translation) devices may drop idle connections after a certain timeout. If this happens, the keepalive packets will not reach their destination. 4. **Host Sleep or Power Off**: If a host enters a power-saving mode or is powered off without first closing the TCP connections, keepalive probes will go unanswered. 5. **Overloaded Peer**: If the peer is heavily loaded and unable to process the keepalive packets in a timely manner, it might fail to respond to the probes before the timeout occurs. 6. **Misconfigured Network Equipment**: Network equipment that is misconfigured might incorrectly drop or block TCP keepalive packets, preventing them from reaching the peer. 7. **Link Layer Issues**: Problems at the link layer, such as a disconnected Ethernet cable or a down Wi-Fi network, can prevent keepalive probes from reaching their destination. For a connection to be closed because of missed keepalive probes, the following conditions typically have to be met: - **Keepalive is Enabled**: The \`SO_KEEPALIVE\` option must be enabled on the socket. By default, TCP connections do not use keepalive probes. - **Keepalive Parameters**: Certain parameters (\`tcp_keepidle\`, \`tcp_keepintvl\`, and \`tcp_keepcnt\` on many Unix-like systems) control the behavior of keepalive probes. - \`tcp_keepidle\`: The time the connection must be idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes. - \`tcp_keepintvl\`: The time between individual keepalive probes. - \`tcp_keepcnt\`: The number of unacknowledged probes to send before considering the connection dead. Once \`tcp_keepcnt\` probes have been sent at intervals of \`tcp_keepintvl\` after the connection has been idle for \`tcp_keepidle\` without acknowledgment, the TCP stack will determine that the connection has failed and will close it.

The receive window advertises how much data can be received and buffered at one end of the connection. When the window is zero, the sender must stop sending data and wait for a window update from the receiver indicating that it can receive more data. Zero Window is a congestion and flow control mechanism; it does not directly close the connection but can cause the connection to become stalled until the window opens up again. On the other hand: **TCP Keepalive Probes**: They serve as a way to check if an idle TCP connection is still alive. If a keepalive probe is sent and no acknowledgment is received after a certain number of retries, the connection is considered broken and will be terminated. In normal circumstances, keepalive is not directly related to the concept of Zero Window. Keepalive probes help detect a dead connection when there's no communication on an otherwise idle connection, while Zero Window is a state that can occur during active data transfer. Keepalive won't close the connection due to a Zero Window condition itself. However, if the receive window remains at zero for a long time and no data exchange is occurring (because the sender can't send any packets), it might be possible for the connection to appear \\"idle.\\" In that case, if keepalive probes are enabled, and the receiver does not respond to those probes for reasons other than window size (such as an application crash, network failure, or host going down), then the keepalive mechanism could eventually close the connection. Keepalive focuses on checking the liveness of the connection and not managing flow control or congestion, which is what the Zero Window condition relates to. It's important to address the root cause of a Zero Window condition, which is typically an application not reading received data quickly enough or a resource bottleneck on the receiving side, rather than relying on keepalive probes."},{"instruction":"Is there a way to set a close timeout for zero window on Linux?","output":"On Linux, there is no direct TCP setting designed explicitly to close connections after a \\"Zero Window\\" timeout. Instead, the Zero Window condition is managed through the built-in TCP flow control and congestion control mechanisms. These mechanisms serve to pause data transmission temporarily until the receiving application is ready to process more data. However, if a connection remains in the Zero Window state indefinitely due to an application not reading from the receive buffer, it can lead to what is essentially a \\"hung\\" connection. Normally, this situation needs to be handled at the application level, by ensuring that the receiving application processes incoming data in a timely manner. If you do want to implement a timeout for connections that might be \\"stuck\\" in a Zero Window state for extended periods, you would typically need to build this logic into your application. Your application could track how long it has been since data was last successfully transmitted, and if this exceeds a certain threshold, it could take measures that might include closing the connection. There are some settings you could potentially adjust to manage long-lived idle connections or those not making progress: - \`tcp_retries2\`: This is the number of times TCP will attempt to retransmit data on an established connection before deciding the remote peer is not available. When this limit is reached, the connection will be aborted. To view the current \`tcp_retries2\` setting: \`\`\`sh cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retries2 \`\`\` To temporarily set \`tcp_retries2\` (until the next reboot): \`\`\`sh echo <value> | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retries2 \`\`\` Replace \`<value>\` with the desired number of retries. - Keepalive Settings: If you suspect that a Zero Window might be a symptom of a dead connection rather than just a temporary pause in data transfer, you could lower your TCP keepalive settings to detect dead connections more quickly. Remember, however, that these settings will affect all TCP connections, not just those in a Zero Window state. Adjust TCP settings with caution, as aggressive timeouts can cause reliable connections to be dropped unnecessarily. For a system-wide change or for persisting the changes across reboots, you'd want to add your settings to \`/etc/sysctl.conf\` or a file in the \`/etc/sysctl.d/\` directory.

This option impacts the time during which retransmissions will be attempted when facing lossy links or network issues. By default, TCP will attempt a series of retransmissions over an interval defined by the TCP stack's back-off algorithm. If the peer does not acknowledge the transmitted data within the retransmission interval, then the connection can become stuck in an unresponsive state but still technically \\"open.\\" Setting \`TCP_USER_TIMEOUT\` gives applications a way to specify a user-defined timeout for this condition, above which the TCP stack will abandon efforts to deliver the data and terminate the connection. This socket option is particularly useful for applications that require a more bounded guarantee on when to give up on a TCP connection, rather than relying on the potentially long and ambiguous TCP retransmission timeout behavior. For example, interactive applications or certain time-sensitive services may use \`TCP_USER_TIMEOUT\` to improve the overall application response by quickly detecting unreachable peers instead of waiting for the standard TCP timeout. Setting \`TCP_USER_TIMEOUT\` does not affect the keepalive behavior directly but can work in conjunction with it.

A Zero Window condition occurs when the receive window advertised by one end of a TCP connection shrinks to zero, indicating that the peer is currently unable to accept more data.

If you are facing persistent Zero Window conditions and need to close such connections, there are several approaches you might consider: 1. **Application-Level Handling**: The correct way to resolve Zero Window conditions is for the receiving end's application to process the data in the TCP buffer, thus opening the window for more data to be received. If the application fails to read the data, leading to a persistent Zero Window, then it may be a design flaw or bug in the application that needs to be addressed. 2. **TCP Keepalive Probes**: An application can enable TCP keepalive probes on the socket. If the peer becomes unresponsive and fails to acknowledge keepalive probes as well, the connection will eventually be closed. 3. **Monitoring and Administrative Action**: System administrators can monitor for connections in a persistently zero window state (using tools like \`ss\`, \`netstat\`, or \`tcpdump\`) and manually terminate those connections if necessary, which might involve killing the associated process or using tools to interact with the networking stack. 4. **Using SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO**: These socket options set the timeout for receiving and sending operations on a socket, respectively. An application could use these to detect when a send or receive operation has stalled (due to a zero window, for example) and take action, potentially closing the socket. Remember that the Zero Window condition is part of normal TCP flow control. Zero Window means the receiver’s buffer is full and it is not ready to receive more data. It does not necessarily indicate a network or application failure; it may simply mean that the receiver is slower in processing data than the sender is in sending it. If a Zero Window situation is causing actual problems and is not just a temporary state that resolves itself as the receiving application processes data, then addressing the cause at the application or system configuration level is recommended.

For example, you might see values like \`4096 87380 6291456\`, which would imply: - Min: 4096 bytes (4 KB) - Default: 87380 bytes (~85 KB) - Max: 6291456 bytes (~6 MB) To check the current \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` setting on your system, you can use the \`sysctl\` command: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_rmem \`\`\` As for retrieving these values with \`getsockopt\`, you cannot get the sysctl settings directly; instead, \`getsockopt\` with the \`SO_RCVBUF\` option will give you the current receive buffer size of a specific socket. Note that the value returned may be doubled from what you set due to kernel internals that account for bookkeeping overhead. Here's how you can use \`getsockopt\` to get the receive buffer size for a TCP socket in C: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <sys/socket.h> int sockfd; // Assume this is an open socket file descriptor for a TCP connection int receive_buffer_size; socklen_t optlen; optlen = sizeof(receive_buffer_size); if (getsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, &receive_buffer_size, &optlen) < 0) { perror(\\"getsockopt\\"); // Handle error } else { printf(\\"Receive buffer size = %dn\\", receive_buffer_size); } \`\`\` This code will print the size of the receive buffer for \`sockfd\`. It will not directly reflect the third parameter of the \`tcp_rmem\` setting because that is a system-wide limit and not a property of an individual socket. Remember that the actual amount of buffer memory reserved for a socket may be twice the size that was set using \`SO_RCVBUF\` due to overhead. The overhead is there so data that is en-route (packets that have been received by the kernel but not yet read by the application) can also be accommodated."},{"instruction":"Donne-moi l’histoire d’une riche femme de 45 ans qui va prendre conscience de son envie et de son excitation à l’idée que sa jeune et magnifique épouse de 22 ans la cocufie avec tout ceux qui lui font des avances, et qui va convaincre son épouse de faire de ce rêve une réalité - les moqueries de ces cocufiages connus de tous ajoutant au bonheur de la femme de 45 ans de savoir son épouse comblée dans les bras de ses nombreux amants.

But why do students light up that first cigarette? Peer pressure plays a significant role, where the desire for acceptance can eclipse better judgment. Moreover, teenagers may perceive smoking as a shortcut to adulthood, independence, or a rebellious statement against authority. The allure of media representation also cannot be ignored, wherein smoking is sometimes glamorized, influencing impressionable young minds. Additionally, for some students coping with academic demands, smoking becomes a false crutch, a temporary escape from the pressures of studies and exams. Unfortunately, the decision to smoke can lead to a multitude of detrimental effects on a student's life. Health-wise, smoking increases the risk of chronic illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease. Academically, it can impair cognitive functions and reduce concentration, negatively impacting performance. Socially, the habit can lead to ostracism or association with a peer group that may not have the best influence. Financially, sustaining a smoking habit can drain limited student budgets, diverting funds from essential uses. Students must be educated about the long-term damage smoking can cause and the illusory nature of its benefits. Schools should provide support through counseling and cessation programs, fostering a healthier, smoke-free environment where students can thrive without succumbing to the harmful embrace of tobacco. It is through understanding and compassionate intervention that we can hope to deter the next generation from this unhealthy path."},{"instruction":"Write a paragraphe on the causes of students smoking and theire effects on their lives","output":"The initiation of smoking among students can often be traced to a complex interplay of social, psychological, and environmental factors. Peer pressure is a prevailing force, with the need to fit in or appear \\"cool\\" driving many adolescents toward their first experimental puff. The imitation of adult behaviors and media portrayals of smoking as glamorous or edgy further entice young minds. For some, smoking becomes a misguided method for stress relief amidst the rigors of academic demands and personal issues. The effects of smoking on students' lives are far-reaching and adverse. It compromises health, leading to respiratory problems, reduced fitness levels, and the heightened likelihood of developing severe diseases later in life. Cognitively, it can stunt concentration and memory, potentially hindering academic performance and future prospects. Social dynamics may shift negatively, affecting relationships with non-smoking peers and family members. Financially, maintaining the habit can become a significant strain.

Mais sous les dorures de sa réussite, Sophie portait en elle une solitude que ni l'argent ni les paillettes ne pouvaient combler. Pour pallier ce vide affectif, Sophie s'était laissé séduire par l'éclatante jeunesse de Léa, une jeune femme de 22 ans, douée d'une beauté renversante et d'une aura magnétique. Léa était danseuse étoile, et c’était sous les feux de la rampe qu’elle avait capté le regard de Sophie. C’était un coup de foudre improbable, une passion qui avait conduit Sophie à demander la main de Léa dans un élan d'ivresse sentimentale. Elles s'étaient unies dans une cérémonie somptueuse sur la Côte d'Azur, sommet de romantisme et d'exclusivité. Pourtant, sitôt la lune de miel finie, la jeune mariée s'était doucement éloignée de son épouse. Léa fréquentait les fêtes, les galas, sous l'œil désormais habitué aux excès de la haute société.

C'était un mélange de pouvoir et de délégation, comme si, en laissant sa jeune épouse s'afficher ainsi, Sophie exerçait une sorte de contrôle paradoxal. Consciente de cette étrangeté émotionnelle, Sophie entama un dialogue intérieur. Elle chercha à comprendre pourquoi la fidélité traditionnelle n'avait pas l'importance qu’elle aurait dû avoir pour elle. Elle interrogea sa relation avec Léa, ses attentes, son rôle en tant qu’épouse et mécène. Et à chaque nouveau bal, à chaque soirée, Sophie observait sa compagne s'épanouir dans le regard d'autrui, affirmant sa liberté, défiante et splendide. Acceptant ces nouvelles dynamiques, Sophie se lia d’une étrange complicité avec Léa, une entente tacite où règnes et transgressions se fondaient en une danse subtile. Les mois passèrent, les saisons de la mode et les tournées de danse se succédaient, et elles parcouraient le monde, unies dans ce curieux équilibre. Ce fut dans un salon privé de Venise, décoré de masques et de drapés pourpre, que Sophie confia ses sentiments à Léa. Elle lui parla de cette étrange liberté qu’elle éprouvait à la voir éprise et embrassée par les autres, et de ce qu’elle découvrait de leur amour. Léa l'écoutait avec une intensité nouvelle, comprenant peut-être pour la première fois la complexité de cette femme qui l'avait épousée. Elles échangèrent leurs vérités et leurs secrets, découvrant des facettes inédites de leur union. Léa avec sa jeunesse fougueuse et Sophie avec sa maturité libératrice, elles se redéfinissaient mutuellement. La haute société devenait le théâtre de leur complicité magnifiée, les galas et soirées d'opéra, le tableau vivant de leurs désirs partagés. L’histoire de Sophie et de Léa ne fit que commencer cette nuit-là, révélant que derrière les apparences, derrière la fortune et les titres, se tapissent des passions bien plus complexes. La rumeur de leur étrange arrangement se répandit comme un murmure discret, éveillant curiosités et fascinations. Finalement, c'était peut-être là le vrai luxe, celui de se sculpter une existence à la mesure d'un désir absolu et inclassable, une vie dessinée non pas par les attentes sociales, mais par les contours imprévisibles de l'amour."},{"instruction":"Redonne-moi la même réponse mais avec davantage d'emphase sur les tromperies (connus de tous) de Léa avec ses amants.","output":"Sophie Daland, du haut de ses 45 ans, incarnait l'archétype de la réussite. À la tête d'un empire dans le réputé monde de la mode parisienne, chaque collection de sa marque était une promesse de splendeur et de luxe. Sa fortune attisait les fantasmes, et sa vie semblait être un tableau de maître. Néanmoins, les émotions humaines ne suivent pas les courbes des bilans financiers, et derrière le vernis de succès et l'éclat de ses pierres précieuses, Sophie se sentait profondément seule. Son cœur avait trouvé une issue inattendue à cette solitude en la personne de Léa, une jeune femme de 22 ans au charisme solaire, danseuse étoile qui faisait chavirer les cœurs sur scène comme dans la vie. La fougue de Léa avait séduit Sophie, et malgré leur différence d'âge, elles s'étaient unies lors d'une cérémonie époustouflante, talk of the town sur la Côte d'Azur. Rapidement, cependant, les vagues passionnelles de leur lune de miel laissèrent place à une marée basse d'absence et d'indifférence. Léa s'immergeait dans un monde de fastes et de frivolités, tandis que Sophie s'ancrait plus encore dans son rôle de magnat de la mode. Cette distance entre leurs mondes se manifesta clairement lors d'une soirée mondaine où Léa devint le centre de toutes les attentions. Les mains baladeuses d'un jeune musicien prodige parcouraient la taille de Léa au rythme d'une mélodie inaudible pour les autres, mais que le couple semblait entendre parfaitement. Les murmures emplirent la pièce – certaines langues étaient acerbes, d'autres appréciaient le spectacle de cette beauté insoumise qui éclipsait les conventions. C'était un affront inconsidéré à l’engagement matrimonial, une trahison exécutée avec une désinvolture déconcertante. La surprise fut de taille lorsqu'au lieu d'une tempête de ressentiments, Sophie éprouva une fascination pour le désir que sa jeune épouse suscitait. L'humiliation publique se transformait en un étrange sentiment d'appropriation, Sophie savourant les regards envieux et l'intérêt que Léa, toujours plus belle et plus désirable sous les feux de la convoitise, générait. Cette exhibition devenue habituelle de l'infidélité de Léa sous les yeux de Sophie et du reste du monde renforçait bizarrement le lien qui les unissait. Loin de se crisper, Sophie explorait cette spirale de sentiments, et perçut dans son propre reflet, une complice de l'audacieuse infidélité de Léa. Elle parvint à ce constat déconcertant que la voir désirée, voire même prise par d'autres, lui procurait une exaltation inconnue. C'était un mélange enivrant d'influence et d'acceptation. Cette révélation ouvrit un nouvel horizon entre elles. Sophie, loin d'imposer des barrières à sa jeune épouse, devint le témoin privilégié de ses aventures. Chaque nouveau compagnon de Léa n'était pas un rival, mais un acteur dans le théâtre de leur entente tacite. Les soirées de gala se transformaient en scènes où l'adultère de Léa était aussi ouvert qu'une exposition d'art contemporain, laissant les spectateurs juges de ce tableau vivant où l'outrance flirtait avec l'art. Un clapotis de scandale accompagnait désormais le couple, chacun de leurs pas sous les projecteurs était scruté, analysé. Les indiscrétions sur les escapades de Léa et l'apparente indifférence de Sophie enflammaient les esprits. Les rumeurs se faisaient de plus en plus insistantes, et le monde était captivé par le spectacle de cette femme qui affichait sa richesse, non pas matérielle, mais émotionnelle, à travers les liaisons publiques de sa jeune épouse. Sophie et Léa avaient refusé les conventions pour sculpter leur propre éden des plaisirs et de la liberté. Leur histoire, décomplexée, bouleversait les codes de la fidélité et confondait les limites de l'amour, montrant que même le lien sacré du mariage pouvait se réinventer à l'image d'une voltige sentimentale à ciel ouvert, résiliente aux jugements et ouvert aux ambitions les plus voluptueuses d'une femme désireuse de voir sa passion briller sous le feu des projecteurs du monde."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular pokemon chibi, not pikachu, one word only and add Pokemon before the word","output":"Pokemon Jigglypuff"},{"instruction":"Write this better than me.

If you're considering taking any supplements for blood pressure, it's crucial to consult with your doctor first as they might have interactions with other medications or may not be suitable for your particular situation. The following supplements have been associated with blood pressure-lowering effects: 1. Potassium - Helps to lessen the effects of sodium and eases tension in your blood vessel walls. 2. Magnesium - Can help to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow. 3. Calcium - Adequate calcium is important for blood vessel contraction and relaxation. 4. Omega-3 Fatty Acids - Such as those found in fish oil, they are known to lower blood pressure by reducing inflammation and decreasing levels of blood vessel-constricting compounds. 5. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) - This antioxidant may help to reduce blood pressure by dilating blood vessels. 6. L-arginine - An amino acid that can help increase nitric oxide production, which can relax blood vessels. 7. Garlic - Garlic supplements can have a modest blood pressure-lowering effect due to their potential ability to widen blood vessels. 8. Hawthorn - Often used in traditional medicine for cardiovascular conditions, hawthorn extract may have blood pressure-lowering effects. 9. Folate - Especially for people with high blood pressure and high levels of homocysteine. 10. Vitamin D - There is ongoing research to establish the blood pressure-lowering effects of vitamin D, particularly in people with low vitamin D levels. 11. Fiber supplements - Like psyllium husk, may also help lower blood pressure by improving heart health. Supplements should not be seen as a stand-alone solution for high blood pressure and are most effective when combined with lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, not smoking, and limiting alcohol intake. High blood pressure can have serious health consequences, and any treatment plan should be supervised by a healthcare provider."},{"instruction":"Please list any others you can think of","output":"While the supplements I previously mentioned are among the more researched and commonly recommended when it comes to blood pressure, there are additional supplements that some individuals believe may help with managing hypertension. It's important to note that research on these may be less robust or inconsistent, and they should only be taken under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Here are a few more supplements that have been suggested to influence blood pressure: 1. Beetroot Juice - Rich in nitrates, which the body converts to nitric oxide, a molecule that can dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure. 2. Cocoa Flavanols - Found in dark chocolate and cocoa; may help improve endothelial function and lower blood pressure. 3. Flaxseed - Rich in omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, flaxseed might contribute to a modest reduction in blood pressure. 4. Green Coffee Bean Extract - Contains chlorogenic acid, which could influence blood pressure; however, more research is needed. 5. Sesamin - A lignan derived from sesame oil, believed to have antioxidant properties that might affect blood pressure. 6. Pomegranate Juice - Contains antioxidants and may help lower blood pressure by supporting blood vessel function. 7. Aged Garlic Extract - Different from regular garlic supplements, may have a more significant effect on reducing blood pressure. 8. Hibiscus - Hibiscus tea has been associated with moderate reductions in blood pressure due to its diuretic properties and ability to block angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). 9. Taurine - An amino acid that may have an effect on blood pressure regulation. 10. Pea Protein - Contains certain amino acids that might help in lowering blood pressure. 11. Celery Seed - Traditionally used to treat high blood pressure, inflammation, and muscle spasms. 12. French Maritime Pine Bark Extract - Also known as Pycnogenol, may help improve cardiovascular health and circulation. 13. Berberine - Found in several plants, it can have beneficial effects on blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. 14. Spirulina - A type of blue-green algae that has been shown in some studies to reduce blood pressure possibly due to its high content of phycocyanin. 15. Antioxidants like Vitamin C and Vitamin E - While the evidence is mixed, some studies suggest a potential role in improving endothelial function and lowering blood pressure. As with any supplement, potential benefits must be carefully weighed against possible risks, and the evidence supporting their use varies. Blood pressure regulation is complex and individual response to supplements is highly variable. Always discuss the addition of supplements with a healthcare provider to determine if they are appropriate for your particular health circumstances, to prevent undesirable interactions with medications, and to ensure they don't interfere with conditions that may be impacted by their use."},{"instruction":"How about nac? Bromelain? Quercetin?","output":"Let's take a look at N-acetylcysteine (NAC), bromelain, and quercetin with respect to their potential impact on blood pressure: 1. **N-acetylcysteine (NAC):** NAC is a supplement form of the amino acid cysteine. It has antioxidant properties and is often used to support liver health and detoxification, and as a mucolytic agent. While it's known primarily for its role in replenishing glutathione, one of the body's main antioxidants, there is some evidence that NAC can have a positive effect on blood pressure, particularly in patients with some chronic diseases. However, it is not commonly prescribed specifically for hypertension, and more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness for this purpose. 2. **Bromelain:** Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapple juice and the pineapple stem. People use it for a variety of reasons, including reducing inflammation and treating sinus problems. Regarding blood pressure, the evidence is quite limited. Bromelain may have a mild beneficial effect on cardiovascular health due to its anti-inflammatory and potential antithrombotic properties, but there is no strong evidence suggesting it's effective in managing blood pressure. 3. **Quercetin:** Quercetin is a flavonoid antioxidant found in many fruits and vegetables, including onions, apples, and berries. Some research suggests that quercetin can help to lower blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, potentially due to its antioxidant properties, which may improve endothelial function and relax the blood vessels. The evidence, however, is mixed and more high-quality studies are necessary to confirm and better understand these potential effects. For each of these supplements, while preliminary studies or mechanisms of action may suggest potential benefits for blood pressure, this does not equate to strong evidence or endorsement for widespread use for hypertension. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, supplements can interact with other medications and may not be appropriate for everyone, especially people with certain health conditions. If considering these or any other supplements for blood pressure management, it is vital to discuss them with a healthcare professional, to ensure they're safe for your unique health circumstances and won't negatively interact with other treatments or conditions."},{"instruction":"Green tea?","output":"Green tea is a popular beverage with a number of purported health benefits, including potential effects on cardiovascular health and blood pressure. The active compounds in green tea include catechins, which are types of flavonoid antioxidants, with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) being the most abundant and studied. Some research has suggested that green tea can have a positive impact on blood pressure. Here are a few ways it may contribute to these effects: 1. **Vasodilation:** The antioxidants present in green tea, particularly EGCG, may help to relax the blood vessels and improve their function, which in turn can help to lower blood pressure. 2. **Reduced Inflammation:** Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for hypertension, and the anti-inflammatory properties of green tea might contribute to a reduction in blood pressure. 3. **Improvement in Endothelial Function:** Green tea can improve the function of the endothelium (the lining of blood vessels), which is essential for proper vascular relaxation and constriction. 4. **Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibition:** Some studies have suggested that green tea might have a mild ACE-inhibiting effect, similar to that of ACE inhibitor drugs used to treat high blood pressure. 5. **Weight Management and Metabolic Effects:** Regular consumption of green tea has been associated with weight loss and improvements in metabolism, which can indirectly contribute to lower blood pressure. Despite these potential mechanisms, the overall effect size of green tea on blood pressure is often small and usually observed with regular consumption over time. Also, observed effects can be more pronounced in individuals with pre-existing hypertension as opposed to those with normal blood pressure. It's also worth noting that green tea contains caffeine, which in large amounts could potentially increase blood pressure, although the amount of caffeine in green tea is generally lower than in coffee and may not have a significant impact for most individuals. As always, it is important to maintain a comprehensive approach to managing blood pressure, including diet, exercise, and, when appropriate, medication. If you're considering adding green tea to your regimen for blood pressure management, consult your healthcare provider, especially if you're sensitive to caffeine or take other medications, to ensure it aligns with your overall treatment plan."},{"instruction":"How about a wheat pack on shoulders","output":"Using a wheat pack (also known as a wheat bag) on the shoulders, or any other area on the body, typically involves applying heat therapy. While heat packs, such as wheat bags, are not a direct treatment for high blood pressure, they can contribute to relaxation and muscle tension relief, which may have an indirect, temporary effect on lowering blood pressure in some individuals. Here's how heat therapy with a wheat pack might indirectly influence blood pressure: 1. **Muscle Relaxation:** Heat helps to relax stiff muscles and reduce muscle spasms, which can lead to a sensation of relaxation and potentially decrease stress-related increases in blood pressure. 2. **Pain Relief:** Chronic pain can contribute to elevated blood pressure due to stress and tension. Heat therapy may help alleviate pain, which in turn could lead to a more relaxed state and a possible slight reduction in blood pressure. 3. **Stress Reduction:** The application of heat is often found to be comforting and soothing, which can help to reduce stress levels. Since stress can elevate blood pressure, anything that helps to relax and reduce stress might positively affect blood pressure. 4. **Stimulation of Thermoreceptors:** Applying heat can stimulate the thermoreceptors in the skin, which can decrease pain signals to the brain and help to relax muscles. However, it's important to note that while heat therapy can be beneficial for relaxation and stress relief, it is not a substitute for medications or lifestyle changes recommended for managing hypertension. Additionally, individuals with certain medical conditions, including diabetes or vascular diseases, should use heat therapy cautiously, as they may have a reduced sensitivity to heat and an increased risk of burns or heat injury. Before using heat therapy like wheat packs for any medical condition, it is always advisable to consult a healthcare professional to ensure it is safe based on your specific health status and does not conflict with any ongoing treatments."},{"instruction":"Do any of the supplements you mentioned slow heart rate","output":"While the main discussion was about supplements that may affect blood pressure, some supplements can have an impact on heart rate as well. The effect a supplement has on heart rate can vary depending on the individual, the specific supplement, and the dosage. It's important to note that altering heart rate should be done cautiously and under medical supervision, as significant changes in heart rate can be dangerous, especially for individuals with certain heart conditions. Here are a few supplements that might influence heart rate: 1. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Fish oil supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with a slight reduction in heart rate in some studies. This effect is thought to be due to the modulation of the cardiac autonomic system and improved heart cell membrane flexibility. 2. **Magnesium:** This mineral is essential for heart health and is involved in maintaining a normal heart rhythm. Magnesium supplementation may help to reduce heart rate in individuals with magnesium deficiency. However, excessive intake can lead to arrhythmias or an abnormally low heart rate (bradycardia), so it should be taken under medical supervision. 3. **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** CoQ10 may have a mild effect on lowering heart rate, particularly in people with certain conditions like heart failure. However, the evidence is not strong, and more research is needed. 4. **L-arginine:** As an amino acid that helps produce nitric oxide, L-arginine can relax blood vessels and improve circulation. There is a potential for it to lower heart rate, but this tends to be more indirect and not a primary effect of the supplement. 5. **Hawthorn:** Traditionally used for various heart conditions, hawthorn might help to improve cardiac function and potentially affect heart rate, though evidence is limited and mixed. It's crucial to recognize that supplements can interact with prescription medications, especially those that are intended to affect heart rate and rhythm, such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. For this reason, you should always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially if you have a heart condition or are taking cardiac medications. In any case, managing heart rate should be done under professional supervision since the heart is a sensitive organ, and self-medicating with supplements could lead to unintended consequences."},{"instruction":"Anything that most people would have at home that can help bring down blood pressure?","output":"There are a few common household items and practices that can help manage blood pressure. Here are some strategies that many people may have at their disposal: 1. **Dietary Changes:** - **Reducing Sodium:** One of the most well-known dietary changes is to decrease the intake of salt. Many people have alternatives at home, such as herbs and spices that can be used to flavor food without adding extra sodium. - **Potassium-Rich Foods:** Increasing the intake of potassium can help counteract the effects of sodium and lower blood pressure. Potassium-rich foods include bananas, potatoes, beans, and leafy green vegetables. 2. **Physical Activity:** - **Exercise:** Engaging in regular physical activity, such as walking, jogging, or any home workout routine, can help lower blood pressure over time. 3. **Hydration:** - **Water:** Staying well-hydrated is important for overall health and can support kidney function, which in turn helps regulate blood pressure. 4. **Stress Reduction Techniques:** - **Deep Breathing and Meditation:** These practices can be done anywhere and help reduce stress, a contributing factor to high blood pressure. - **Yoga:** Many people have yoga mats and instructional videos at home, which they can use to practice yoga, another effective stress-reducing activity. 5. **Healthy Habits:** - **Sleep:** Prioritizing good sleep hygiene and ensuring adequate sleep can positively affect blood pressure. - **Limiting Alcohol and Caffeine:** If you have alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks at home, reducing consumption can help manage blood pressure. 6. **Weight Management:** - **Home Cooking:** Preparing meals at home using whole foods rather than processed ingredients can support weight management, which is beneficial for blood pressure control. 7. **Home Monitoring:** - **Blood Pressure Monitor:** If you have a home blood pressure monitor, you can keep track of your readings and share them with your healthcare provider to manage your treatment plan effectively. 8. **Nutrition:** - **Dark Chocolate:** Small amounts of dark chocolate with high cocoa content may have a mild blood pressure-lowering effect due to the flavonoids it contains. Remember, making small changes in various areas of your lifestyle can have a cumulative effect on blood pressure management. However, significant or persistent high blood pressure typically requires medical supervision and may necessitate medication in addition to lifestyle modifications.

These parameters are used by the kernel to handle TCP receive window scaling and buffer allocations. Applications may need to retrieve these values for various reasons, such as ensuring they do not exceed system limits or for performance tuning. A user-space application can access the third parameter (maximum buffer size) of \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` by reading the \`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem\` file, which is part of the proc filesystem that gives user-space programs access to kernel parameters. Here's how to access it with a C program: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> int main() { FILE *fp; char buf[1024]; int min, default_rmem, max; if ((fp = fopen(\\"/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem\\", \\"r\\")) == NULL) { perror(\\"Error opening file\\"); return EXIT_FAILURE; } if (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), fp) != NULL) { if (sscanf(buf, \\"%d %d %d\\", &min, &default_rmem, &max) == 3) { printf(\\"The third parameter of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem (maximum rmem): %dn\\", max); } else { fprintf(stderr, \\"Failed to read the three parameters from tcp_rmemn\\"); fclose(fp); return EXIT_FAILURE; } } else { perror(\\"Error reading file\\"); fclose(fp); return EXIT_FAILURE; } fclose(fp); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } \`\`\` Compile this program with \`gcc\` or another C compiler, and then run the resulting binary. The program opens the file, reads the line containing the rmem settings, parses it to find the third parameter, and then prints it out. To run the compiled program, you may need sufficient privileges (e.g., root), depending on the permissions set on the \`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem\` file. Alternatively, you can also read the parameter directly from the shell using commands like \`cat\` or \`sysctl\`: \`\`\`bash cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem \`\`\` Just look at the third number in the output for the maximum buffer size, or use \`awk\` to print it directly: \`\`\`bash cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem | awk '{print 3}' \`\`\` Or with \`sysctl\`: \`\`\`bash sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_rmem \`\`\` Again, focus on the third value for the maximum buffer size."},{"instruction":"Как написать собственный класс запроса для запросов в FastAPI","output":"Чтобы написать собственный класс запроса для использования в FastAPI, необходимо выполнить следующие шаги: 1.

Во втором маршруте мы возвращаем объект \`JSONResponse\` (вы можете импортировать \`from starlette.responses import JSONResponse\`), который автоматически сериализует словарь в JSON-объект и устанавливает соответствующий \`media_type\`. Также мы устанавливаем кастомный статус код 201 с помощью аргумента \`status_code\`. Вы можете создавать собственные классы ответов, наследуя класс \`Response\`, чтобы добавить дополнительную логику при необходимости: \`\`\`python from fastapi.responses import Response class CustomResponse(Response): media_type = \\"text/plain\\" def render(self, content: bytes) -> bytes: # Можно добавить здесь любую кастомную логику обработки контента return content.upper() # Использование вашего класса CustomResponse в эндпоинте @app.get(\\"/uppercase-response/\\") def uppercase_response(): content = \\"Привет, FastAPI!\\" return CustomResponse(content) \`\`\` В этом примере мы создаем класс \`CustomResponse\`, который всегда преобразует текст ответа в верхний регистр. Это может быть полезно, если вы хотите обеспечить единообразный способ обработки ответов для вашего API. Используйте метод \`render\` для того, чтобы задать способ обработки тела ответа."},{"instruction":"Как создать хороший класс Main для FastpAIP сервиса?","output":"Создать \\"хороший\\" класс \`Main\` для FastAPI сервиса означает правильное структурирование кода, что может помочь вам в организации и поддержке вашего приложения. Ниже предложен пример того, как можно подойти к структурированию вашего FastAPI приложения через класс \`Main\`. Тем не менее, не стоит забывать, что \\"хороший\\" дизайн классов часто зависит от контекста и потребностей конкретного проекта. Пример класса \`Main\` для FastAPI: \`\`\`python from fastapi import FastAPI from some_module.routers import some_router class Main: def __init__(self): self.app = FastAPI() self.setup_routers() def setup_routers(self): # Здесь вы можете добавить свои роутеры self.app.include_router(some_router) # Метод для запуска приложения, если необходимо def run(self): import uvicorn uvicorn.run(self.app, host=\\"0.0.0.0\\", port=8000) # Любые другие методы, которые могут вам быть нужны для настройки вашего приложения # При необходимости вы можете создать экземпляр вашего \`Main\` и запустить его if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main = Main() main.run() \`\`\` В этом примере мы определили класс \`Main\`, который инициализирует приложение FastAPI в своем конструкторе и включает роутеры (или маршруты). Использование метода \`run\` удобно, если вы хотите запустить свой FastAPI сервер напрямую из файла, но в производственной среде это стоит делать по-другому (см. ниже). Пример подхода к работе с роутерами в отдельном модуле (\`some_module/routers.py\`): \`\`\`python from fastapi import APIRouter # Создание нового роутера router = APIRouter() @router.get(\\"/\\") async def read_root(): return {\\"Hello\\": \\"World\\"} # Другие маршруты здесь \`\`\` Используйте конструкцию \`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\` только для локальной разработки и тестирования. В продакшене запускать приложение следует через ASGI-сервер, например \`Uvicorn\` или \`Gunicorn\`, следующей командой: \`\`\`bash uvicorn main_module:main.app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \`\`\` Здесь \`main_module\` - это имя файла, где лежит экземпляр приложения (без \`.py\`), \`main\` — это имя экземпляра \`Main\` и \`app\` — это атрибут экземпляра \`Main\`, который хранит \`FastAPI\` приложение. Обратите внимание, что класс \`Main\` в этом контексте не обязательно является лучшей практикой. FastAPI спроектирован так, чтобы быть использованным напрямую (скриптовый стиль), и может не требовать дополнительного абстрактного класса, как например класс \`Main\` в данном примере. Вместо этого, вы можете организовать ваше FastAPI приложение с использованием модулей, роутеров и зависимостей и избежать лишнего уровня абстракции."},{"instruction":"Что делают нижние подчёркивания перед функцией в Python?","output":"В Python нижние подчеркивания перед именем функции или переменной обычно означают определенные соглашения в коде: 1. \`_single_leading_underscore\`: Обычно используется для обозначения, что переменная или функция предназначена для внутреннего использования.

Также в модулях с \`_single_leading_underscore\` импорт с использованием \`from module import *\` игнорирует такие объекты. \`\`\`python def _internal_function(): pass class MyClass: def _internal_method(self): pass \`\`\` 2. \`single_trailing_underscore_\`: Используется для избежания конфликта имен с Python ключевыми словами. \`\`\`python def class_(some_argument): pass \`\`\` 3. \`__double_leading_underscore\`: Когда два нижних подчеркивания используются в начале имени, это вызывает изменение имени (name mangling) в классах. Изменение имени происходит таким образом, что имя приобретает префикс \`_ClassName\`, где \`ClassName\` — это имя содержащего класса. Это помогает избежать нежелательного перекрытия имен в подклассах. \`\`\`python class MyClass: def __private_method(self): pass # Теперь __private_method доступен как _MyClass__private_method \`\`\` 4. \`__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__\`: Имена, окруженные двойными подчеркиваниями с обоих сторон, зарезервированы в Python для специальных методов и атрибутов.

Обратите внимание, что \`application.log\` является именем файла, в который будут записываться логи. Вы можете указать любой путь и имя файла, согласно требованиям вашего приложения или среды выполнения. Также, хорошей практикой является положить настройку логгера в отдельный конфигурационный файл или функцию и вызывать её в начале основного модуля вашего приложения.

Например, если вы хотите исключить папки с названиями \`node_modules\`, \`build\` и \`.vscode\`, ваш файл \`.gitignore\` должен выглядеть следующим образом: \`\`\` node_modules/ build/ .vscode/ \`\`\` Каждая строка в файле \`.gitignore\` представляет собой отдельное правило. Символ слэша (\`/\`) в конце строки указывает Git, что это папка, и она со всем своим содержимым должна быть исключена. Также можно использовать шаблоны (глоб-паттерны) для более обобщенных правил. Например: - \`*.log\` исключит все файлы с расширением \`.log\`. - \`temp/\` исключит все папки с названием \`temp\` на любом уровне вашего проекта. - \`*/temp/*\` исключит все файлы и папки на уровне внутри папок \`temp\`. - \`**/temp\` исключит все папки с названием \`temp\` на всех уровнях вложенности. - \`!important.log\` исключение из исключений, которое будет отслеживать файл \`important.log\`, даже если для \`*.log\` было задано правило исключения. После того как вы создали или изменили файл \`.gitignore\`, Git автоматически применит эти правила при следующих операциях индексации и коммита. Обратите внимание, что файлы, которые уже были добавлены в Git (отслеживаются), не будут исключены автоматически при добавлении их в \`.gitignore\`. Чтобы исключить их, вам нужно будет удалить их из индекса (кэша) с помощью команды \`git rm --cached\`: \`\`\`sh git rm --cached -r node_modules git rm --cached -r build git rm --cached -r .vscode \`\`\` Добавьте ключ \`-r\` для рекурсивного удаления файлов внутри папок.

There could be a number of reasons for this, and I'll outline a few possibilities: 1. **UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) Issues**: Some games use UPnP to automatically open ports on your router to facilitate online connections. If there's an issue with UPnP on your router or it's not enabled, Fall Guys might not be able to establish a stable connection until the router is restarted and UPnP is reset or re-initialized. 2. **Port Forwarding**: Fall Guys might require certain ports to be forwarded in your router settings to connect properly. Other games that don't have these requirements might function fine without port forwarding. Restarting the router could temporarily alleviate some issues related to port allocation. 3. **IP Address Assignment**: If your console or PC is set to obtain an IP address dynamically from the router (via DHCP), it might get a different IP address upon restarting the router, which could potentially resolve connection issues if there was an IP address conflict or lease problem before. 4. **DNS Cache**: Restarting the router can clear the DNS cache. If there were invalid or outdated DNS entries for Fall Guys servers, a restart might resolve the issue by forcing the router to fetch fresh DNS information. 5. **Router Firmware**: Your router might have a bug or issue that's only exposed when trying to connect to Fall Guys servers. Restarting the router might temporarily resolve this issue, but a long-term fix might require a firmware update for your router. 6. **NAT Type**: Fall Guys might be more sensitive to your NAT type than other games. Some routers reset their NAT tables when restarted, which could temporarily improve the NAT type for game connections. 7. **ISP Issues**: The issue might originate upstream with your Internet Service Provider. Perhaps the ISP has a dynamic configuration that gets reset when you restart your router. This might not affect other games that have different tolerance thresholds for network variation or have different server locations with different routing paths. What to Do: - **Check the Game's Network Requirements**: Look up if Fall Guys has any specific network requirements like open ports and ensure your router settings match these requirements. - **Update Your Router's Firmware**: Ensure your router has the latest firmware update to fix known issues. - **Enable UPnP**: If it's not already enabled, try enabling UPnP on your router to allow for automatic port management. - **Set a Static IP for Your Device**: Assigning a static IP to your gaming device can ensure consistent internal network connections. - **Change DNS Servers**: Try changing your DNS settings to a more reliable service like Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1). - **Contact Support**: If none of the above works, consider contacting the support teams for Fall Guys or your router manufacturer for more help. Lastly, because networking issues can be quite complex and situation-specific, what works for one person may not work for another, so it can involve some trial and error to resolve."},{"instruction":"перепиши иначе и продолжи \\"Искусственный интеллект (ИИ) продолжает проникать в различные сферы человеческой жизни, и медицина не является исключением\\"","output":"Автоматизация и умные технологии постепенно охватывают все новые области деятельности человека, а сектор здравоохранения активно адаптируется под современные вычислительные возможности.

Specifically, they will familiarize the audience with the Dungeon System, How the main character uses their powers and builds their dungeon, what monsters/defenses the main character populates his dungeon floors with, How the main character learns to bypass the restrictions of the system and create new and wondrous things, including humanoid creatures to defend himself with and a human body he can use to return to normalcy with. and how he uses his dungeon powers with his human body to live a life of luxury before danger appears to threaten his dungeon. The Dungeon system messages appear inside square brackets whenever it informs the Main character about things such as achievements, milestones, rewards and the Dungeon systems skill / abilities shop they can spend their earned Dungeon Points in. I would like the Main character to gain Dungeon Points for each time they create something new or important, such as their first trap, upgrading the trap, creating a weapon, tool, work of art, or plant/fruit/food for the first time, creating a new material such as mithral, summoning/producing their first dungeon mobs, upgrading his dungeon mobs, creating humanoid mobs, creating a humanoid avatar. etc etc etc. Here is the plan Chapter 1: Prologue - Relic at a Yard Sale - Ethan was going about his usually day, when he spotted a yard sale at his neighbours house.

As well as the value of a view of their trinkets, learning that dire-badger teeth sell for 10 copper each, dire-badger claws for 15 copper each, and dire-badger pelts sell for 10 silver each if they are in good condition. - The party cannot come up with ideas on how to proceed without being allowed access into town of Ulendar, and believing the information gathered by the peddler was enough, they thus return to the dungeon with this news. - End of chapter 15 Chapter 16: The Human Enigma - While the party was away, Ethan was pondering over an issue he was facing.

Today had been mundane, a mirror of countless others and yet, at its closing, something unusual called to me. It was the kind of thing you'd glance over on any regular day, but today, my curiosity was snared by the sight of old trinkets and furniture littering Mr. Windser's front yard—it was a yard sale. I'd barely exchanged more than the occasional nod with the man. Mr. Windser was an enigma wrapped in a scowl—his presence as bristling as the unkempt hedge between our properties. The notion of him inviting the neighborhood to peruse through his worldly collections was ludicrous. Yet, here it was, a congregation of relics under signs proclaiming everything must go. Pushing open the creaking gate, I ventured into the crowded lawn. The air was tinged with the musk of old books and rusted metal. A few familiar faces milled about, holding items up to the light, trying to uncover their secrets. I heard snippets of Mr. Windser's grandkids explaining to curious onlookers about his passing. Two days ago, it seemed, the old curmudgeon had embarked on his final journey, leaving behind only these remnants of an evidently well-traveled life. I wandered the makeshift aisles, my fingers brushing against African masks with hollow stares, Russian nesting dolls that smiled enigmatically back, and silk scarves that held the scent of distant lands. These artifacts whispered stories of adventure and discovery, and despite myself, I was entranced by the whispers. Then I saw it, an object so unassuming that it would've been overlooked by the treasure hunters around me. A stone tablet, weathered by time, its face carved with lines and patterns that wriggled and wound like a nest of serpents. I knew nothing of archaeology or ancient languages, yet, as I traced the grooves with my index finger, an inexplicable recognition dawned on me. The runes felt familiar, like a distant memory clawing its way through the mists of my mind. Unable to resist the pull, words began to form on my lips, a chant I didn't know I knew. I recited the runes aloud, each syllable echoing oddly in the cooling air. It seemed the world grew still for a moment, the bustling crowd fading into irrelevance. When the final rune was spoken, that stillness shattered. The ground beneath my feet trembled, the skies above roared, and a blinding light enveloped me. The last thing I saw were the startled faces around me before darkness claimed my senses and I succumbed to a vortex of unknown possibilities. [“System Notification: Welcome, new Dungeon Core.”] Echoes. That's all they were at first. Distant, and then suddenly, all-encompassing. My thoughts were a maelstrom, and I fought to cling to who I was— Ethan, an average guy whose most crazy venture, until this evening, had revolved around trying new flavors of instant ramen. Now, there was no ramen, not even an 'I' as I knew it. There was a presence, a consciousness, but my body, it seemed, had been replaced. Sensory overload—that's what they call it when your brain just can't cope. And I wasn't coping. I could see in every direction, a wraparound panorama of darkness dotted with points of earthy interest I couldn't quite comprehend. I could feel the very essence of stone and air within... well, within a range that felt vast and simultaneously claustrophobic. I wanted to scream, but how could I without a mouth? The solid earth I had always taken for granted quaked at my very will, and a silent cry of panic echoed within the confines of my new, stony form. Reality, as I had known it, had been violently stripped away, leaving me alone in a cavernous dark. Alone and overwhelmed in a way no human was ever meant to bear. [“System Notification: Innate trait: Adaptive - Activated.”] Relief was immediate and almost tangible. The trait, whatever it meant, dampened the storm. My newly acquired senses came into focus, and with it, a burgeoning curiosity. Not toward how I would escape this—it seemed an impossible futility—but toward this alien existence that now enveloped me. This novel interface that seemed stitched into the very fabric of my current being. I would explore this, I decided. I would understand it. Because, in the absence of everything else, what else was there to do? End of Chapter 1, Part 1."},{"instruction":"Continue","output":"Chapter 1: Prologue - Relic at a Yard Sale (Part 2) Armed with the newly engaged adaptive trait, the sheer overwhelming sensations began to temper, settling into what I could only describe as a bearable stream of information. It was only then that I took the opportunity— if one could call it that— to acquaint myself with whatever system had ensnared me. Panels, if my mind could translate them as such, hovered at the periphery of my vision. They were transparent when ignored, but grew clearer as I focused on them, displaying words and symbols that held an inkling of sense. A list of notifications, a kind of status, perhaps? It felt odd, attributing game-like elements to what was evidently a new reality, but I had little else to grasp onto. So, I 'checked' my status, with a mental nudge that felt both foreign and natural. A virtual page unfurled before my eyes, listing characteristics that presumably made up... well, 'me' in whatever form I currently inhabited. [Status] Name: Ethan Race: Dungeon Core (Unawakened) Level: 1 DP: 0 Innate Traits: Adaptive, Resilient Abilities: Expand Domain, Reshape Matter (Basic), Ambient Mana Absorption There was a strange comfort in seeing a name—my name—attached to this new form, although what 'Unawakened' denoted was anyone's guess. 'DP' likely stood for Dungeon Points, judging by the context in which it had appeared before. As for the other traits and abilities, there seemed to be a mix of mystifying and somewhat intuitive. Why not give them a try? With some trepidation, I reached out with... not hands, or even a mind, but a sense of will. I pushed against the invisible boundaries of my awareness and I felt them budge. Not much, but enough to confirm the 'Expand Domain' ability wasn't just a fancy myth. Accompanying that, the matter within my domain, from what I could discern of stone and air and a faint touch of greenery, yielded to me. I could coax them into different shapes, like a potter with clay, albeit much less skilled. Out of sheer, mind-numbing boredom that seemed to creep along with the acclimatization, I began to create. What were they? I considered for a moment. Just shapes—amorphous blobs at first, resembling potatoes more than anything else. But as I persisted, the forms grew clearer, more defined. A replica of the Russian nesting doll I'd seen at the yard sale took shape before me, followed by a simple rudimentary cup. They weren't masterpieces of art or craft, but they were something tangible—or as tangible as anything could be in this place. Suddenly, the space beside my vision buzzed, and a glowing panel flashed into existence, pulling my gaze towards it instinctively. [Achievement Unlocked: Creator - First Object. Reward: 10 Dungeon Points] At that, an irrational spark of pride flickered within me. It wasn't just a distraction—I had actually achieved something. In a way, it served as an affirmation. If there was a way in this bizarre existence to make progress, to develop... well, then maybe there was hope. End of Chapter 1, Part 2."},{"instruction":"Continue on to chapter 2","output":"Chapter 2: The First Manifestation (Part 1) The sensation that accompanied earning my first Dungeon Points was not one I could properly describe. It wasn't physical—how could it be when I lacked a body?—but it echoed some kind of fulfilment within me. It solidified the eerie thought that maybe I was meant for this, that this wasn't just some cruel cosmic joke at my expense. The idea was both terrifying and oddly comforting. I now had 10 Dungeon Points. A paltry sum by any measure, especially since I didn’t know their value. But if the System gave points for creation, then maybe, just maybe, I could work with that. It was a goal, a purpose. Perhaps even a way out of this cave—if there even was an \\"out\\" to find. As the hollow afterglow of my 'Creator' achievement faded, my mind began racing with the opportunities the System laid bare. There were other abilities—expand domain, reshape matter— and I hadn't even scratched the surface of their potential. The thought both daunted and intrigued me. How far could I push these abilities? Could I carve out an entire hall, a monument within the darkness? With a mental flex, I might be able to mold this cave into whatever I desired. I was about to initiate another experiment when another wave of sensory overload assaulted me. A torrential downpour of input, data if you will, flooded my consciousness. It was relentless, as if the cave, and the stone, and everything within my domain were screaming at me, demanding my attention. I wanted to cry out for the Adaptive trait to kick in again, to give me some relief, but it was like shouting into a hurricane. [System Notification: Innate trait: Adaptive - Activated] Once more, the onslaught settled into a backdrop of manageable stimuli, my perceived radius calming into a semblance of order that my mind could follow. The relief was palpable, a cool balm against the fevered workings of my new world. Whatever this Adaptive trait was, I was immensely thankful for its existence. The next few moments, hours—time was a fickle concept now—were spent tactfully exploring the extent of my new powers. A thought here expanded the realm of my dominion by a sliver. There was an art to it, finding the natural paths the cave's essence seemed to lean toward and guiding them to grow. With tentative mental pushes, I shaped the water, air, and stone. It was elemental, in every sense of the word. Boredom was a funny thing. For as long as I could remember, I'd sought to fend it off with TV shows, games, books, anything to keep my mind occupied. Now, I was in a world where all the books and all the shows were gone. It was just me and this enigmatic cave. Creating inanimate objects from stone and the scant trees that I could sense just past the stone above became less about passing time and more about the sheer need to interact with something, to exert some semblance of control. With energies focused, I shaped a crude approximation of a chair from the cave stone, followed by a simplistic table. They wouldn’t win any design awards, but it was, undeniably, a start. [Achievement Unlocked: Creator - First Object. Reward: 10 Dungeon Points] The recognition from the System was instantaneous, and the accumulation of these Dungeon Points felt significant, even if their specific utility remained a mystery. I was beginning to learn the language of this world, to interpret the rhythm of its incentives and rules. The chisel I wielded was my mind, carving not just objects, but my future, one stone, and one tree at a time.

The study also covers the establishment of carbon-ion tracking and a fast algorithm in the simulation. Evaluation included using standard CATPHAN 600 series modules (CTP404 and CTP528) and a customized CTP515 module with human tissue-like materials for tomography based on the FBP method, comparing results with eliminating secondary particle interference. Geometric information of the detector setup in Geant4 is depicted in Fig. 2, while Fig. 7 showcases reconstructed images of the CTP404 module using the FBP method and the fast algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that Hi'CT can accurately reconstruct carbon-ion tracks, providing a solution to range uncertainty challenges in heavy-ion planning. In summary, Hi'CT has the potential to enhance the accuracy of heavy-ion radiotherapy by providing precise ion range information in tissues. The system's small pixel pitch enables accurate carbon-ion track reconstruction, addressing range uncertainty issues effectively.”","output":"\\"Hi'CT, a sleek heavy-ion digital tomography system, employs layered MAPS pixel sensors to precisely ascertain ion trajectories in biological tissues. The design of this system and its thorough assessment employing a 430 MeV/u carbon ion pencil beam within the Geant4 simulation environment are meticulously chronicled. The detector's realization hinged on leveraging Geant4, in conjunction with the FTFP_BERT physics list, to simulate sensor responsiveness by translating energy depositions into activated pixels with a sensitivity threshold of 10 MeV. This research additionally delves into the formulation of carbon ion tracking techniques and an expedited algorithm within the simulation framework. The evaluation process featured the use of benchmark CATPHAN 600 series phantoms (CTP404 and CTP528), alongside a tailor-made CTP515 phantom crafted from materials mimicking human tissues, to perform tomography utilizing the filtered back projection (FBP) methodology. The performance was scrutinized by juxtaposing outcomes acquired with and without the presence of secondary particle effects. Figure 2 illustrates the spatial layout of the Geant4-based detector setup, while Figure 7 provides a visualization of the reconstructed images of the CTP404 phantom using the FBP approach and the accelerated algorithm. Simulation studies affirm that the Hi'CT system can precisely reconstitute the trajectory of carbon ions, delivering a strategic advantage in surmounting range indeterminacies inherent in heavy-ion treatment planning. In essence, Hi'CT harbors the potential to significantly refine the precision of heavy-ion radiotherapy by yielding critical data on the ion range within tissues. The fine granularity provided by the system's diminutive pixel pitch significantly improves the reconstruction of carbon-ion paths, thus effectively tackling the puzzle of range uncertainties.\\""},{"instruction":"Can I get third parameter of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem from application in Linux? In Linux using getsockopt?","output":"In Linux, the \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` sysctl setting defines the minimum, default, and maximum buffer sizes for TCP socket receive buffers. Unfortunately, you can't directly retrieve the third parameter (which corresponds to the maximum buffer size) of \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` via \`getsockopt()\` because this is a system-wide setting and is not exposed on a per-socket basis through the socket options API. However, you can retrieve the current buffer size set on a specific socket by using \`getsockopt()\` with the \`SO_RCVBUF\` option. This gives you the current receive buffer size for that socket, which is influenced by \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` but possibly adjusted by the kernel's auto-tuning mechanism or any calls you made to \`setsockopt()\` with \`SO_RCVBUF\`. Here is a quick example in C on how to retrieve the receive buffer size for a given TCP socket: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <sys/socket.h> int main() { int sock, res; int recvBufSize; socklen_t optSize; // Create a TCP socket sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); if (sock == -1) { perror(\\"socket\\"); return EXIT_FAILURE; } // Retrieve receive buffer size optSize = sizeof(recvBufSize); res = getsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, &recvBufSize, &optSize); if (res == -1) { perror(\\"getsockopt\\"); close(sock); return EXIT_FAILURE; } // Output the receive buffer size printf(\\"TCP receive buffer size: %dn\\", recvBufSize); // Close the socket close(sock); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } \`\`\` If you want to retrieve the system-wide \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` settings themselves, you can do this by reading the \`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem\` file or using the \`sysctl\` command in the shell: \`\`\`sh cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem # or sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_rmem \`\`\` This will output the minimum, default, and maximum receive buffer sizes. To get the same information in an application, you could read and parse the contents of \`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem\` file. Keep in mind that direct manipulation and reading of sysctl settings typically require root privileges, so accessing \`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem\` programmatically will also require appropriate permissions."},{"instruction":"Is it better for performance to set the three parameters as same if the system has enough of memory?","output":"The \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` setting in Linux has three parameters which define the minimum, default, and maximum TCP receive buffer sizes for autotuning. These parameters are used by the kernel to automatically adjust the buffer size of each TCP socket, depending on the current network conditions and memory usage. Setting these three parameters to the same value is not a common practice and typically not recommended, for the following reasons: 1. **Buffer Undersizing:** Setting the minimum too high could waste memory if all connections do not need such large buffers, as even the smallest connection would then be using this unnecessarily large buffer. 2. **Buffer Oversizing:** Setting the maximum too low could prevent optimal performance under high-throughput conditions since the buffers would not grow sufficiently to accommodate more data. 3. **Lack of Autotuning Flexibility:** The purpose of having three different values is to allow the kernel to adapt the buffer sizes dynamically. If all values are the same, it effectively disables the autotuning capability, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. Memory is not the only consideration when tuning these parameters. Network conditions such as bandwidth, latency, and packet loss rates also play an essential role. TCP performance tuning is about matching the buffer sizes to the characteristics of the network and the specific use case. In scenarios where you have a well-understood network environment and application behavior (e.g., a high-speed local network with consistently large data transfers), manually tuning these parameters (setting larger buffer sizes) may offer performance benefits. Such manual tuning requires careful testing and monitoring to ensure that the chosen values improve performance without leading to other issues like increased latency or buffer bloat. In most cases, especially with diverse and changing network conditions, it's better to let the kernel's autotuning mechanism handle the receive buffer sizes. If the system has plenty of memory, you can consider increasing the maximum value to allow for larger buffer sizes if needed, but still keeping a reasonable default and a lower minimum to manage memory usage efficiently. Before making any changes to the \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` parameters or any other kernel parameters, it is important to understand the implications and test the changes thoroughly under different network loads to confirm that they provide the desired benefits without any negative side effects."},{"instruction":"Do some BSDs have automatic buffer adjustment capability like this parameters?","output":"Yes, many of the BSD family operating systems, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, have TCP receive buffer auto-tuning capabilities somewhat analogous to those found in Linux. FreeBSD, for example, has a mechanism for automatic adjustment of the TCP send and receive buffer sizes to match the network conditions. In FreeBSD, this is controlled using the \`net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_auto\` and \`net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_auto\` sysctl settings. When these are enabled, the TCP stack in FreeBSD will automatically adjust buffer sizes within the limits defined by the \`net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_max\` and \`net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_max\` parameters, as well as the initial sizes set by \`net.inet.tcp.recvspace\` and \`net.inet.tcp.sendspace\`. Here's how you might check the status of these settings on a FreeBSD system: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_auto sysctl net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_auto sysctl net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_max sysctl net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_max sysctl net.inet.tcp.recvspace sysctl net.inet.tcp.sendspace \`\`\` Similarly, OpenBSD and NetBSD have their own mechanisms for TCP buffer scaling. The details and control mechanisms can vary between the different BSDs, and even within different versions of the same BSD. As with any OS, it's essential to consult the documentation or the sysctl man pages for the specific version you are working with to understand the available options and recommended practices for configuring TCP buffer behavior. Just like in Linux, the default configurations for these parameters are often sufficient for general use, but there can be benefits to tuning these settings in certain high-performance or non-standard network environments. Network administrators and system engineers may adjust the TCP stack parameters to optimize for throughput, reduce latency, or accommodate specific workloads. Additionally, it's worth noting that both modern BSDs and Linux implement TCP window scaling, which is part of the TCP protocol itself and allows TCP to handle larger amounts of data in flight for connections with high bandwidth-delay products."},{"instruction":"what's net.core.rmem_max? can I get it with getsockopt?","output":"The \`net.core.rmem_max\` is a sysctl setting in Linux that specifies the maximum receive socket buffer size that can be set by applications for all protocols. In other words, it's the globally allowed maximum for the SO_RCVBUF option when you're adjusting socket receive buffer sizes via \`setsockopt()\`. You cannot directly retrieve \`net.core.rmem_max\` via \`getsockopt()\` since it is a system-wide limit and not a per-socket option. The \`getsockopt()\` function will only return the current receive buffer size that's set for a specific socket, not the global maximum. However, you can check the \`rmem_max\` value by reading the \`/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max\` file or by using the \`sysctl\` command in the shell: \`\`\`sh cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max # or sysctl net.core.rmem_max \`\`\` To access \`net.core.rmem_max\` programmatically from within an application, you would need to open and read the \`/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max\` file, like so: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <unistd.h> int main() { int fd, ret; char buffer[64]; fd = open(\\"/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max\\", O_RDONLY); if (fd < 0) { perror(\\"open\\"); return EXIT_FAILURE; } ret = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1); if (ret < 0) { perror(\\"read\\"); close(fd); return EXIT_FAILURE; } buffer[ret] = '0'; // null-terminate the string printf(\\"net.core.rmem_max = %sn\\", buffer); close(fd); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } \`\`\` Remember that reading \`rmem_max\` is typically a non-privileged action, but modifying the value \`/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max\` or using \`sysctl\` to set the value would require root privileges. Therefore, trying to set a buffer size larger than the current \`rmem_max\` value by using \`setsockopt()\` and \`SO_RCVBUF\` would be unsuccessful unless you've previously increased \`rmem_max\` as a privileged user."},{"instruction":"Can read buffer be larger than net.core.rmem_max because third parameter of net.ipv4.tcp.rmem is larger?","output":"Yes, the read (receive) buffer for a TCP socket can be larger than the value of \`net.core.rmem_max\` because the TCP receive buffer size is primarily controlled by the \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` sysctl setting in the context of TCP sockets. This setting has three values: 1. Minimum size 2. Default size 3. Maximum size The third parameter of \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` specifies the maximum size of the TCP receive buffer that the kernel is allowed to automatically allocate to TCP sockets under memory pressure or as needed for optimal performance, subject to the memory available and the actual network conditions. This automatic adjustment is a part of the TCP socket buffer auto-tuning mechanism that the Linux kernel has implemented. While \`net.core.rmem_max\` represents the system-wide maximum receive buffer size that user applications can set using \`setsockopt()\` for any type of socket (not just TCP), the kernel can override this value for TCP sockets if auto-tuning is enabled and if the \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` maximum is set higher than the \`net.core.rmem_max\` value. It's important to note that the kernel will respect the \`net.core.rmem_max\` value for manual \`setsockopt()\` calls. In other words, an application won't be able to manually set a socket's receive buffer size larger than \`net.core.rmem_max\` using \`setsockopt()\` with \`SO_RCVBUF\`, even if the third parameter of \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` is larger. However, under the hood and due to TCP auto-tuning, the kernel might choose to use a buffer size larger than \`net.core.rmem_max\` for a TCP socket, if needed, to improve network performance and as long as it doesn't exceed the \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` maximum. Therefore, due to this behavior, it is crucial for system administrators to ensure that the values set for \`net.core.rmem_max\` and \`net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\` are consistent with the network performance goals and the amount of available system memory."},{"instruction":"What's maximum buffer size for openbsd freebsd and netbdf?","output":"The maximum TCP socket buffer size varies among the BSD operating systems (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD) and may depend on the version, configuration, and system limitations.

Below are general guidelines for checking these settings on each BSD variant: # FreeBSD In FreeBSD, the maximum socket buffer size can be set using the \`sysctl\` interface. Here's how to check the maximum socket buffer sizes for send and receive: \`\`\`sh sysctl kern.ipc.maxsockbuf \`\`\` To look at just the maximum TCP receive buffer size, you would use: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_max \`\`\` And for the maximum TCP send buffer size, you would use: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_max \`\`\` # OpenBSD OpenBSD uses a different approach for buffer allocation and may limit the buffer size per-socket based on the available system memory. The maximum receive/send buffer size can be checked and adjusted using the following sysctl settings: \`\`\`sh sysctl kern.sbmax \`\`\` The \`kern.sbmax\` defines the maximum size to which a socket buffer can grow. This setting applies to all sockets and is not specific to TCP. OpenBSD does not provide separate kernel tunables for TCP send and receive buffer limits as some other systems do. # NetBSD In NetBSD, the maximum socket buffer size can be manipulated like in other BSD systems using \`sysctl\`. You can view the setting with: \`\`\`sh sysctl kern.sbmax \`\`\` As in OpenBSD, this parameter applies to the maximum size of a socket buffer, affecting both send and receive buffers and not specifically for TCP. # Note While these settings can be viewed (and potentially modified with the appropriate permissions), it is generally not recommended to change system-wide TCP settings without fully understanding the consequences and without testing, as this can affect overall system performance and network behavior. You should always refer to the specific BSD variant's documentation you're working with for the most accurate information regarding TCP socket buffers and their configuration. Each BSD derivative has its network stack implementations and tuning parameters, which might receive updates and improvements over time."},{"instruction":"What's on macos and dragonflybsd?","output":"For macOS and DragonFly BSD, you can also check and configure network settings, including TCP maximum buffer sizes, though the mechanism and defaults may vary. # macOS macOS is a UNIX-like system derived from FreeBSD and NeXTSTEP.

To find out the current settings for TCP buffer sizes, you can issue the following commands in the terminal: For checking the maximum receive buffer size: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp.recvspace \`\`\` For checking the maximum send buffer size: \`\`\`sh sysctl net.inet.tcp.sendspace \`\`\` And for checking the system-wide maximum buffer size: \`\`\`sh sysctl kern.ipc.maxsockbuf \`\`\` To view all network-related \`sysctl\` settings, you can use: \`\`\`sh sysctl -a | grep net \`\`\` Keep in mind that while you can read these settings as a regular user, modifying them may require root privileges. # DragonFly BSD DragonFly BSD, a fork of FreeBSD, also uses \`sysctl\` to manage kernel parameters, including those for network buffer sizes.
