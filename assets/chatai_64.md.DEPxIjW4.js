We aim to count the number of pairs of subsets ( (A, B) ) such that ( A subseteq B ) and ( |A| = m ), where ( |A| ) denotes the cardinality (number of elements) of the set ( A ). 2. **Counting via Choice of ( A ) First**:    - First, choose a subset ( A ) of ( m ) elements from ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ). There are ( binom{n}{m} ) ways to choose such a subset ( A ).        - For each choice of ( A ) (with ( |A| = m )), we then choose any subset ( B ) such that ( A subseteq B ) and ( B ) can be any subset of the remaining ( n - m ) elements that are not in ( A ).

There are ( binom{n}{k} ) ways to choose each such subset ( B ).        - Given a subset ( B ) of size ( k ), we then need to choose ( A ) such that ( A subseteq B ) and ( |A| = m ).

Let us start by framing the assumption: Assume it is possible to have an equal, non-zero number of checkers on each cell of a 3 times 3 board after several moves. 2. According to the problem, on each move, three checkers are added to any three cells that form the corner of an L-shape (or rotated versions thereof). 3. Suppose after a certain number of moves, each cell contains ( n ) checkers. Therefore, the total number of checkers on the board would be ( 9n ). 4. At each step, we add 3 checkers. Hence, after ( k ) moves, a total of ( 3k ) checkers would be added. 5. Given that we want ( 9n ) checkers eventually, the total number of moves required would be ( k = 3n ). Therefore, the condition ( 9n = 3k ) must hold, giving ( k = 3n ). 6. Now, consider that each corner cell (four corners at top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right positions) should individually get checkers in separate moves as no L-shape can have two corners. Consequently, each corner has been selected ( n ) times in different moves.    7. Since there are 4 corners and each needs to have ( n ) checkers placed individually, the minimum moves required to place ( n ) checkers in each corner would be ( 4n ).  8. This creates a contradiction:     - From steps 1-5, we established that ( 3n ) moves were needed to achieve ( 9n ) checkers.    - But from step 7, each corner independently needing ( n ) placements implies at least ( 4n ) moves.    - Since ( 3n < 4n ), it contradicts the assumption that every cell would have ( n ) checkers after ( 3n ) moves.

Prove that there exist two adjacent numbers such that after their removal, the remaining numbers cannot be divided into two groups with equal sums.","output":"To prove the assertion, let's proceed by contradiction. Assume that for any pair of adjacent numbers removed, the remaining numbers can always be split into two groups with equal sums.  Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Initial Approach with Even Numbers:**    - Suppose all 2005 natural numbers placed in a circle are even.    - Divide all numbers by 2.    - Note that the property of being able to split remaining numbers into two groups with equal sums persists after this division.    Thus:    - Keep dividing by 2 until at least one number becomes odd.    - This shows that within these 2005 numbers, there must be at least one odd number. 2. **Splitting Strategy and Parity Check:**    - Restate the problem for the cases where the sum of all numbers is either even or odd.  3. **Case 1: Sum of all numbers (S) is even:**    - Since 2005 is an odd number, the sum ( S ) cannot be even if all numbers are odd, because any odd number of odd numbers sum up to an odd number.    - Hence, there are both odd and even numbers.    - Identify an adjacent pair comprising one odd and one even number.    - Remove this pair.    - The sum of the remaining numbers would then be odd.     - This contradicts our assumption that the remaining numbers can be split into two groups with equal sums (each group would then inherently have to sum up to an integer, but since the sum is odd, it's impossible).    - Thus, there cannot be such a pair of numbers. 4. **Case 2: Sum of all numbers (S) is odd:**    - There must be an adjacent pair of numbers with the same parity, either both even or both odd.    - Removing this adjacent pair leaves 2003 numbers.    - The sum of the remaining numbers would still be odd (since ( S - 2k_e ) where ( k_e ) is even makes ( S ) odd).     - This again contradicts the initial assumption that the remaining numbers can be split into two groups with equal sums. 5. **Conclusion:**    - The contradiction in both cases means our assumption is incorrect.     - Hence, there must exist an adjacent pair of numbers such that when removed, the remaining numbers cannot be split into two groups with equal sums, as proven by contradiction.

We need to find the necessary and sufficient condition for the area of triangles BDF and EDF to be equal. 2. **Using angle bisector properties**: Based on the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio in which the angle bisector divides the opposite side is the same as the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle, we have:    [    BD = a cdot frac{c}{b+c}, quad text{and} quad BF = c cdot frac{a}{a+b}    ]    where a, b, and c are the lengths of sides BC, CA, and AB, respectively. 3. **Calculating the area of triangle BDF**: Using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of sides and angle, we get:    [    text{Area of } triangle BDF = frac{1}{2} BD cdot BF cdot sin(beta) = frac{1}{2} left( a cdot frac{c}{b+c} right) left( c cdot frac{a}{a+b} right) sin(beta)    ]    Simplifying the expression:    [    text{Area of } triangle BDF = frac{a^2 c^2 sin(beta)}{2(a+b)(b+c)}    ] 4. **Relating the area of triangle BDF to triangle ABC**: The area of triangle ABC is given by:    [    text{Area of } triangle ABC = frac{1}{2} a c sin(beta)    ]    Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangle BDF and triangle ABC is:    [    frac{text{Area of } triangle BDF}{text{Area of } triangle ABC} = frac{frac{a^2 c^2 sin(beta)}{2(a+b)(b+c)}}{frac{1}{2} a c sin(beta)}    ]    Simplifying further:    [    frac{a^2 c^2 sin(beta)}{2(a+b)(b+c)} cdot frac{2}{a c sin(beta)} = frac{a c}{(a+b)(b+c)}    ] 5. **Finding the areas of triangle AEF and triangle CDE**: Similarly, we find the ratios of the areas of these triangles to triangle ABC:    [    frac{text{Area of } triangle AEF}{text{Area of } triangle ABC} = frac{c b}{(c+a)(a+b)}    ]    [    frac{text{Area of } triangle CDE}{text{Area of } triangle ABC} = frac{b a}{(b+c)(c+a)}    ] 6. **Summing the ratios and finding triangle DEF's area ratio**:    [    text{Sum of ratios} =  frac{a c}{(a+b)(b+c)} + frac{c b}{(c+a)(a+b)} + frac{b a}{(b+c)(c+a)}    ]    Therefore, the ratio of triangle DEF's area to triangle ABC's area is:    [    1 - left( frac{a c}{(a+b)(b+c)} + frac{c b}{(c+a)(a+b)} + frac{b a}{(b+c)(c+a)} right)    ]    Simplifying using the common denominator:    [    = 1 - left( frac{a c (a+b)(b+c) + c b (b+c)(c+a) + b a (c+a)(a+b)}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} right)    ] 7. **Condition for equal area of triangle BDF and triangle EDF**: We set the two areas equal:    [    frac{2b}{c+a} = 1    ]    This gives:    [    b = frac{a+c}{2}    ] 8. **Conclusion**: Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for the areas of triangles BDF and EDF to be equal is that the side b must be the arithmetic mean of the other two sides a and c.

Since line L passes through the point A(4,1), we have: frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by ab to clear denominators: 4b + a = ab. Now let's analyze a + b: begin{align*} a + b &= (a + b)left(frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b}right) &= frac{4(a + b)}{a} + frac{(a + b)}{b} &= 4frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + 4 + 1 &= 4frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + 5. end{align*} By the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality), for positive numbers we have: sqrt{xy} leq frac{x + y}{2}, which means that for the two positive terms 4frac{b}{a} and frac{a}{b}, we can apply the AM-GM inequality as follows: frac{4frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b}}{2} geq sqrt{4frac{b}{a}cdot frac{a}{b}}.

Notation: Let:  - M be an arbitrary point on the figure. - M_1 be the point symmetric to M with respect to the axis of symmetry. - M_2 be the point symmetric to M with respect to the center of symmetry.  3. Analyzing Symmetry: - Since M is symmetric to M_1 with respect to the axis, the line segment overline{MM_1} is bisected perpendicularly by this axis. - Since M is symmetric to M_2 with respect to the center, the center lies at the midpoint of the line segment overline{MM_2}.  4. Constructing another axis of symmetry: We need to show that M_2 is symmetric to M with respect to another axis, specifically an axis: - Perpendicular to the first axis, - Passing through the center of symmetry.  5. Consider properties of symmetric points: - The coordinates of M_1 and M_2 in relation to M and the symmetry properties. - Place the figure in a coordinate system where:   - The center of symmetry O is at the origin (0,0).   - The initial axis of symmetry is the y-axis.  6. Coordinate Relationships: - Suppose M has coordinates (x, y). - Then M_1 will have coordinates (-x, y) (reflection across the y-axis). - M_2 will have coordinates (-x, -y) (reflection across the origin).  7. Verifying new symmetry: - Check if M_2 is symmetric to M with respect to the x-axis (perpendicular to the y-axis):   - Reflecting (x, y) across the x-axis would give (x, -y),   - Reflecting (x, -y) across the origin (which is also a reflection across both axes) gives (-x, -y) which matches M_2.  8. Conclusion: - The figure indeed has another axis of symmetry:   - Perpendicular to the original axis (y-axis),   - Passing through the center of symmetry (origin).

Each such diameter creates ( 2 cdot (n-1) = 2n - 2 ) triangles. 6. **Combining the cases:**    - If ( n ) is odd, the total count of right-angled triangles is ( 2n(n-1) ).    - If ( n ) is even, the total count is:      [      2(n-1)n + 2n = 2n^2      ] # Conclusion:    Therefore, the total number of right-angled triangles is:    begin{itemize}      item When ( n ) is odd: (boxed{2n(n-1)})      item When ( n ) is even: (boxed{2n^2})    end{itemize}"},{"instruction":"ABC is an equilateral triangle with sides of 3cm. overline{BC} is extended by half of its length to point D, and E is the midpoint of overline{AC}.

Let's prove this theorem step by step: 1. **Base Case:**     - For ( r leq 1 ), the theorem is trivially true because ( K_1 ) (a single vertex) or ( overline{K_1} ) (an empty graph) is always present in any graph with at least one vertex. 2. **Inductive Step:**     - Assume ( r geq 2 ). We need to find ( n ) such that any graph with at least ( n ) vertices contains either ( K_r ) or ( overline{K_r} ).    - Set ( n := 2^{2r-3} ), and let ( G ) be a graph with at least ( n ) vertices.

Consider ( (p_1, ldots, p_{2010}) = (e_i, 0, ldots, 0) ) and ( (q_1, ldots, q_{2010}) = (e_1, ldots, e_{i-1}, 0, ldots, 0) ). This construction works as required.

The base case ( k = 1 ) is obvious since we are given a nonzero multiple of ( [1, 0, ldots, 0] ) for ( k = 1 ).

We need to show that the coefficient of ( [k, 0, ldots, 0] ) in the representation of ( sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i + x_j)^k ) is nonzero. 9. **Coefficient Analysis:**    We write:    [    sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i + x_j)^k = 2009 sum_{i=1}^{2010} x_i^k + sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} sum_{a=1}^{k-1} binom{k}{a} x_i^a x_j^{k-a}    ]    and:    [    frac{1}{2} sum_{a=1}^{k-1} binom{k}{a} (x_1^a + cdots + x_{2010}^a)(x_1^{k-a} + cdots + x_{2010}^{k-a}) = frac{1}{2} sum_{a=1}^{k-1} binom{k}{a} left( sum_{i=1}^{2010} x_i^k + sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i^a x_j^{k-a} + x_i^{k-a} x_j^a) right)    ]    Since the blue parts are the same, it follows that if ( sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i + x_j)^k ) can be expressed as a linear combination of the above polynomials with the ( x_1^k + cdots + x_{2010}^k ) coefficient zero, then we must have:    [    2009 = frac{1}{2} sum_{a=1}^{k-1} binom{k}{a} = frac{1}{2} (2^k - 2) = 2^{k-1} - 1    ]    but this is never true. 10. **Conclusion:**     Since we know the values of ( sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i + x_j)^k ) and all the polynomials in ( S ), we can find the value of ( [k, 0, ldots, 0] ). Then, since ( S ) and ( [k, 0, ldots, 0] ) form a basis for symmetric homogeneous degree-( k ) polynomials in ( x_1, ldots, x_{2010} ), we can find the value of every ( [i_1, ldots, i_{2010}] ) where ( i_1 + cdots + i_{2010} = k ), completing the inductive hypothesis. (blacksquare) 11. **Final Step:**     By our key claim, we can find the ( k )-th elementary symmetric sum of the ( x_i ) for ( 1 leq k leq 2010 ), which we can use to write down a unique monic degree-( 2010 ) polynomial whose roots are precisely ( x_1, ldots, x_{2010} ). Thus, the multiset ( {x_1, ldots, x_{2010}} ) is uniquely determined.

Without loss of generality, let (a > b > c).    - Analyze the circles:      - Circle ((AXY)) does not contain (B) or (C), so it is not a separator.      - Circle ((BXY)) contains (A) but not (C), so it is a separator.      - Circle ((CXY)) contains both (A) and (B), so it is not a separator.    - Thus, there is exactly one separator passing through (X) and (Y). 4. **Case 2: Two Points on One Side, One Point on the Other Side of Line (XY)**:    - Assume (A) and (B) lie on one side of (XY) and (C) lies on the other side.    - Without loss of generality, let (a > b).    - Analyze the sub-cases:      - **Sub-case 1**: (180^circ - c > a > b)        - Circle ((AXY)) does not contain (B) or (C), so it is not a separator.        - Circle ((BXY)) contains (A) but not (C), so it is a separator.        - Circle ((CXY)) does not contain (A) or (B), so it is not a separator.        - Thus, exactly one separator passes through (X) and (Y).      - **Sub-case 2**: (a > 180^circ - c > b)        - Circle ((AXY)) contains (C) but not (B), so it is a separator.        - Circle ((BXY)) contains (A) but not (C), so it is a separator.        - Circle ((CXY)) contains (A) but not (B), so it is a separator.        - Thus, exactly three separators pass through (X) and (Y).      - **Sub-case 3**: (a > b > 180^circ - c)        - Circle ((AXY)) contains (C) but not (B), so it is a separator.        - Circle ((BXY)) contains (A) and (C), so it is not a separator.        - Circle ((CXY)) contains (A) and (B), so it is not a separator.        - Thus, exactly one separator passes through (X) and (Y). 5. **Counting Separators**:    - There are 10 segments that contain 2 points from the set.    - Each segment's separator score (number of separators passing through both vertices) is either 1 or 3.    - Let (N) be the sum of all separator scores. Since each separator is counted three times (once for each pair of points it passes through), (N) must be a multiple of 3.    - (N) is also an even number greater than 10, so the number of separators is even and at least 4. 6. **Bounding the Number of Separators**:    - **Case 1**: 5 segments on the convex hull      - Each segment on the convex hull has a separator score of 1.      - (N leq 5 cdot 1 + 5 cdot 3 = 20), so there are at most 6 separators.      - Since the number of separators is even, there are at most 4 separators.    - **Case 2**: 4 segments on the convex hull      - Let (A, B, C, D) be on the convex hull and (X) not on the convex hull.      - (X) is inside either (triangle ABC) or (triangle ADC). Assume (X) is inside (triangle ABC).      - Circle ((ABC)) is a separator because (X) is inside it and (D) is outside.      - There are at most 3 separators involving segments from the convex hull.      - There are at most 2 separators not involving segments from the convex hull.      - Thus, there are at most 4 separators.    - **Case 3**: 3 segments on the convex hull      - Let (A, B, C) be on the convex hull, and (X) and (Y) not on the convex hull.      - Segment (XY) has a separator score of 1.      - There is only 1 triangle not involving a segment from the convex hull.      - There are at most 3 separators involving segments from the convex hull.      - Thus, there are at most 4 separators. 7. **Conclusion**:    - In all cases, there are at least 4 and at most 4 separators.    - Therefore, there are exactly 4 separators.

By using multiplication, we can find out what percentage of the cost price the selling price is, and then determine how much higher the selling price is compared to the cost price in percentage terms. This difference corresponds to 40 yuan. By using division, we can calculate the cost price. Let's denote the cost price as x. The original price after marking up by 20% is x + 0.2x = 1.2x. The selling price, after applying a 10% discount, is 1.2x times 0.9 = 1.08x. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is 1.08x - x = 0.08x = 40 yuan.

For x(x-3) < 0, the product is negative when one factor is negative and the other is positive. Thus there are two cases: 1. x < 0 and (x-3) > 0 which is impossible since if x < 0, then (x-3) is also less than zero.     2. x > 0 and (x-3) < 0 which leads us to the interval 0 < x < 3.

Approach: 1. **Understanding Compatibility**: Sequences are considered compatible if they match exactly in 4 positions. Thus, for the sequences to be incompatible, they must not match in precisely 4 positions. 2. **Binary Sequences and Combinatorics**: Let's analyze sequences by considering their first 5 positions. The goal will be to group these sequences in a manner where no two sequences in the same group are compatible. 3. **Combinatorial Enumeration**: We will use combinations to count ways of placing either zeros or ones in the first five positions. The total number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 5 for ones (or zeros) is represented by ( C_5^3 = binom{5}{3} = 10 ).    This means there are 10 ways to distribute 3 ones among the first 5 positions. 4. **Grouping by Patterns**: We will group sequences based on the positions of the first three ones (or zeros) in the first five positions. Each pattern determines a group.  Detailed Process: 1. **Choosing the Groups**:    - Consider the positions in the sequence where the first five elements are examined.    - Each sequence can be categorized based on where the first three ones (or zeros) are placed in the first five positions.    This results in 10 distinct patterns (since ( C_5^3 = 10 )). 2. **Validation with Respect to Compatibility**:      - Note that any sequences within any pattern group will have at least 3 matches (positions) out of the five spots chosen for ones (or zeros).      - Since we are seeking to ensure that no two sequences are compatible (match in exactly 4 places), sequences within the same group (each with a different first-5-position pattern) cannot be compatible because they already match in 3 out of 5 positions by group definition. 3. **Extending this Logic**:    - By similar logic, every sequence with its first five positions having at least three ones can be grouped into one of the 10 categories based on combinations of the first five positions.      - Likewise, every sequence with its first five positions having at least three zeros can be grouped into another set of 10 categories (again using the combinations).      - This leads us to two sets of 10-group partitions, one for the sequences with three ones and another for the sequences with three zeros, covering all possible sequences of the form described.      - Consequently, because any given sequence must belong to one of these 20 groups, we ensure that no two sequences in the same group match exactly in 4 positions.

This places the left-most grasshopper at -1, the middle one at 0, and the right-most one at 1. 2. **Observation Regarding Jumps**:    Each jump involves one grasshopper leaping over another to a point symmetric about the position of the second grasshopper. If a grasshopper initially at coordinate A jumps over another at coordinate B to coordinate A_1, the new coordinate A_1 can be calculated as:    [    A_1 = 2B - A    ]    Since the homogenity of the systematic coordinate translation follows symmetry logic. 3. **Integral Coordinates during Jumps**:    Notice that the coordinates of grasshoppers remain integers throughout the movements. This consistently happens because the calculation:    [    2B - A    ]    will always result in an integer if both A and B are integers. 4. **Even Distance Movement**:    We need to verify that the grasshoppers maintain their relative positioning around zero. When any grasshopper at position A jumps over the grasshopper at position B, the distance moved:    [    |2B - A - A| = |2B - 2A| = 2|B - A|    ]    This shows the distance moved is always even, maintaining the parity of positions.  5. **Returning to Initial Positions**:    Given that the distances are always even, let's discuss initially distributed positions for subsequent visual verification.

Let's affirm for some possible interchanges:    - Initial: -1, 0, 1    - Possible arrangement requires middle one to be necessarily at 0 (since every jump sustains middle man's zero location). 7. **Conclusion**:    The only plausible reordering of -1 and 1 guarantees the middle position rester to zero returning the extreme at reflected points engaging mutual interchange.

Therefore, the distance between two adjacent intersection points, which corresponds to the function's period, is pi. So the distance between two adjacent points where the line parallel to the x-axis intersects f(x) is boxed{pi}."},{"instruction":"Let S be the set of positive integer divisors of 24^9.

We know the total amount paid was 30, and the cost of the tax-free items was 12.72. So, we subtract the cost of the tax-free items from the total amount paid to find the cost of the taxable items plus the sales tax. Total amount paid = Cost of tax-free items + Cost of taxable items + Sales tax 30 = 12.72 + Cost of taxable items + Sales tax Now, let's find the cost of the taxable items plus the sales tax: Cost of taxable items + Sales tax = 30 - 12.72 Cost of taxable items + Sales tax = 17.28 Next, we need to calculate the sales tax on the taxable items. We know the tax rate is 8%, so we can represent the sales tax as 8% of the cost of the taxable items. Let's call the cost of the taxable items \\"x\\". The sales tax would then be 0.08x. So we have: x + 0.08x = 17.28 Combining like terms, we get: 1.08x = 17.28 Now, we solve for x to find the cost of the taxable items before tax: x = 17.28 / 1.08 x = 16 Now that we have the cost of the taxable items before tax, we can calculate the sales tax: Sales tax = 0.08 * 16 Sales tax = 1.28 So, the amount paid for sales tax on taxable purchases was boxed{1.28} ."},{"instruction":"Computers use binary numbers, which have two digits 0 and 1.

Let the speeds of Andrey, Boris, and Valentin be denoted as a, b, and c meters per second, respectively. 2. From the problem, we know that Andrey finishes 50 meters ahead of Boris. Since they are running at a constant speed, the relationship between their speeds can be given by:    [    b = 0.95a    ]    This implies that Boris's speed is 95% of Andrey's speed. 3. Similarly, Boris finishes 40 meters ahead of Valentin. Thus, the relationship between Boris's and Valentin's speeds is:    [    c = 0.96b    ]    This implies that Valentin's speed is 96% of Boris's speed. 4. Substituting the speed b in terms of a into the equation for c:    [    c = 0.96 cdot 0.95a = 0.912a    ]    This means Valentin's speed is 91.2% of Andrey's speed. 5.

Suppose (b = 2) for a new expression, as dividing the entire initial expression by (b/2) shows no loss of generality:    [    frac{2}{2c - a + 2} + frac{c}{a + 2}    ] 4. **Applying Constraints**:    We need to find the minimum value of:    [    frac{2}{2c - a + 2} + frac{c}{a + 2}    ] 5. **Extending Known Inequalities**:    From known inequalities such as:    [    (c - (h - k))^2 geq 0    ]    This implies:    [    c^2 + c(2k - 2h) + h^2 - 2hk + k^2 geq 0    ]    Hence,    [    c^2 + ck + h^2 geq (2h - k)(c + k)    ] 6. **Utilizing Specific Values**:    Assign (h = sqrt{a + 2}) and (k = 1 - frac{a}{2}), to target the problem structure:    [    frac{c}{a + 2} + frac{2}{2c + 2 - a} geq frac{2}{sqrt{a + 2}} + frac{a - 2}{2a + 4}    ]     7. **Transforming Variable**:    Let (x = frac{1}{sqrt{a + 2}}), changing the range (0 leq a leq 4) implies:    [    frac{1}{sqrt{6}} leq x leq frac{1}{sqrt{2}}    ] 8. **Simplifying the Inequality**:    Hence,     [    frac{2}{sqrt{a + 2}} + frac{a - 2}{2a + 4} = 2x + frac{1}{2} - 2x^2    ]    This reduces to:    [    2x + frac{1}{2} - 2x^2 = 1 - frac{(2x-1)^2}{2}    ] 9. **Establishing the Bounds**:    Since:    [    -sqrt{2} + 1 leq 2x - 1 leq sqrt{2} - 1    ]    This results in:    [    2x + left(1 - 2x^2right) ge sqrt{2} - frac{1}{2}    ] 10. **Final Calculation and Verification**:    Hence:    [    frac{b}{c + d} + frac{c}{a + b} ge sqrt{2} - frac{1}{2}    ]        Checking at specific values: (b = 2), (c = sqrt{2} - 1), (a = 0), (d = sqrt{2} + 1) verifies that the minimum value is achieved. **Conclusion**:    [    boxed{sqrt{2} - frac{1}{2}}    ]"},{"instruction":"A sequence has 2500 terms.

This is described mathematically as:    - For row numbers (1, 3, 5, ldots, 19), paint all cells black. 3. **Count the Initial Black Cells**:    There are 10 odd-numbered rows in a 19 times 89 grid. Therefore:    [    text{Total black cells} = 10 times 89 = 890    ] 4. **Verification of Condition**:    Next, we verify that this coloring satisfies the condition that any 2 times 2 subgrid has at most 2 black cells. Consider any such 2 times 2 subgrid in the grid. The possible configurations of such subgrids in relation to our painted rows are:    - **Case 1**: Subgrid includes two consecutive rows, one black and one not. This ensures at most 2 black cells.    - **Case 2**: Subgrid includes two black rows, which cannot happen because we only painted the odd rows and any two consecutive rows, one of which being black, contains at most 2 black cells.  The initial guess ensures no 2 times 2 subgrid exceeds 2 black cells. 5. **Upper Bound and Proof by Induction**:    Now we need to prove that this number of 890 black cells is indeed the maximum. We employ mathematical induction to confirm this:        - **Base Case**: Consider a simpler, rectangular subgrid of size 2 times (2n + 1). It can clearly have at most 2(n+1) black cells if it satisfies the given condition. Verify for the smallest case with any valid 2n+1. Suppose (n = 1); then the grid is 2 times 3, having a maximum of 4 black cells in this pattern.        - **Inductive Case**: Let's assume for an (2k+1) times (2n+1) grid, it satisfies the condition having ((k+1)(2n + 1)) as the maximum number of black cells. We need to establish this for the (2k+3 times 2n+1) rectangle.      - Consider an separated single extra block (2-row block in new size)       - Suppose row-wise as above, if the additional strip does not exceed 2(n+1) cells. 6. **Final Assembly and Conclusion of Inductive Proof**:     By induction, for (2k+3) times (2n+1) grid, ngeq k, we shall have max feasible points ((k+2)(2n+1)) still appending due to above logic of stripping.

The exception is when a = 2n+1 and p-a = 2n^2, so p = 2n^2 + 2n + 1. 5. **Handling Remaining Cases**:    If P(2n) le P(2n+1), then from the expressions in step 2, we also have:    [    P(4n^2 + 2n + 1) = p    ]    Similarly, if P(2n+2) le P(2n+1), we are done. 6. **Final Case Analysis**:    The remaining case is when P(2n), P(2n+2) > P(2n+1). Using the previous idea, we get:    [    P(2n) = P(4n^2 - 2n + 1) = P(4n^2 + 2n + 1) = q    ]    [    P(2n+2) = P((2n+2)(2n+1) + 1) = P((2n+2)(2n+3) + 1) = q'    ]    We are not done only when 4n^2 + 1 = q and (2n+2)^2 + 1 = q'. 7. **Conclusion**:    For large n, surely p, q, q' > 5. We have (2n)^2 + 1 = q, (2n+1)^2 + 1 = 2p, (2n+2)^2 + 1 = q'. These are not divisible by 5, which is only possible if 2n, 2n+1, 2n+2 are -1, 0, 1 modulo 5, respectively. 8. **Final Step**:    Let b be the smallest number such that q mid b^2 + 1. We have b = 2n and q - b = 4n^2 - 2n + 1 and q + b = 4n^2 + 2n + 1. So b equiv -1 mod 5 and q equiv 2 mod 5.    We claim that P(3q - b) = q. This is true because (3q - b)^2 + 1 is divisible by 10 (as 3q - b equiv 2 mod 5 and it is odd), and it is smaller than 10q^2. Thus, we have:    [    P(b) = P(q - b) = P(q + b) = P(3q - b)    ] Therefore, we have shown that there are infinitely many quadruples (a, b, c, d) of positive integers that satisfy a < b < c < d and P(a) = P(b) = P(c) = P(d). blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Megan bought 5 dozen eggs and carried them in 5 differently sized trays.

Our task is to cut out rectangles of dimensions (1 times (n+1)).     - Each such rectangle of size (1 times (n+1)) will consume (n+1) vertical or horizontal units. 2. **Case Analysis**:     - **For (n = 1)**:         - The square is (2 times 2).         - The maximum number of (1 times (1+1) = 1 times 2) rectangles that can be cut is (2).

The relationship between the circumference and the diameter of a circle is given by the formula: C = π * D Where π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

Thus, (A,D,M,) and (N) are all on the same side of (PAD). 3. **Length Analysis:**     - Length equations based on (N, M,) and the remote point:     [     PA + PD = 2PM quad text{and} quad PB + PC geq 2PN quad text{as} quad PM < PN     ]     - This would imply an incorrect inequality contradicting (PA + PD leq PB + PC). 4. **Correct Placement:**     - Therefore, (N) should coincide with (M) implying:     [     B text{ and } C text{ lie on the segment } AD text{ with } AB = CD     ] 5. **Ensuring Position Between (A) and (D):**     - Take (P = B).

Define the transformation ( L ) as follows. Let ( X ) be an arbitrary point. Since ( mathbf{e}_1, mathbf{e}_2 ) form a basis, there exist uniquely determined numbers ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) such that:    [    overrightarrow{OX} = x_1 mathbf{e}_1 + x_2 mathbf{e}_2    ] 2.

Let ( a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 ) be the coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ) in the basis ( mathbf{e}_1, mathbf{e}_2 ), that is, such numbers that:    [    overrightarrow{OA} = a_1 mathbf{e}_1 + a_2 mathbf{e}_2    ]    [    overrightarrow{OB} = b_1 mathbf{e}_1 + b_2 mathbf{e}_2    ] 4.

Uniqueness of the transformation ( L ) follows from the result of problem 29.4. Essentially, ( L(overrightarrow{OX}) = x_1 L(mathbf{e}_1) + x_2 L(mathbf{e}_2) ), meaning the image of point ( X ) is uniquely determined by the images of the vectors ( mathbf{e}_1, mathbf{e}_2 ) and the point ( O ).

We need to find the values that the magnitude ( |boldsymbol{a}-lambda boldsymbol{b}-(1-lambda) boldsymbol{c}| ) cannot take. First, let's simplify the expression for the magnitude: [ |boldsymbol{a}-lambda boldsymbol{b}-(1-lambda) boldsymbol{c}| ] 1. Since (boldsymbol{b}) and (boldsymbol{c}) are orthogonal, we can utilize the Pythagorean theorem to calculate their contributions separately. 2.

The x-coordinate of the vertex, h, is given by -frac{b}{2a}. Thus, for our function, the axis of symmetry is at: x = -frac{-3}{2cdot 1} = frac{3}{2} Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [1, frac{3}{2}] and monotonically increasing on the interval (frac{3}{2}, 3].

Suppose statement 3 is true:    [    a + 6b + 1 = (a + 2b + 1) + 4b    ]    Note that (a + 2b + 1) is divisible by 4, thus:    [    a + 6b + 1 equiv 4b pmod{4}    ]    Since 4b equiv 0 pmod{4}, a + 6b + 1 must be divisible by 4.

Let (k) be the size of the subset (S). We need to choose (k) elements out of (n) to form the subset (S). This can be done in (binom{n}{k}) ways. 3. **Permuting the Elements:**    For each subset (S) of size (k), we need to place these (k) elements into the remaining (n-k) positions (since (alpha(x) notin S) for all (x in S)). The number of ways to do this is given by (binom{n-k}{k}k!(n-k)!). 4. **Summing Over All Possible Sizes of (S):**    We sum over all possible sizes of (S) from (0) to (n):    [    sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} binom{n-k}{k} k!

The equation of line NF is y = sqrt{2}(x - 2sqrt{2}) = sqrt{2}x - 4, so N(0, -4). The length of MN is 6, so the circumcircle of triangle MFN has center (0, -1) and radius 3. The equation of the circle is boxed{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 9}. (ii) The equation of line AN is y = k(x + 4). Solving the system of equations begin{cases} y = k(x + 4)  frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{8} = 1 end{cases} gives x_1 = -4 and x_2 = frac{4 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2}, so y_2 = frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2}. Thus, P(frac{4 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2}, frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2}). The slope of line MF is -sqrt{2}k, and M(0, 4k), F(2sqrt{2}, 0). The slope of line NF is frac{1}{sqrt{2}k}, and the equation of line NF is y = frac{1}{sqrt{2}k}(x - 2sqrt{2}). Thus, N(0, -frac{2}{k}). The equation of line AN is y = -frac{1}{2k}x - frac{2}{k}. Substituting this into the equation of the ellipse gives (1 + frac{1}{2k^2})x^2 + frac{4}{k^2}x + frac{8}{k^2} - 16 = 0. Solving this equation gives x_1 = -4 and x_2 = frac{8k^2 - 4}{1 + 2k^2}, so y_2 = -frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2}. Thus, Q(frac{8k^2 - 4}{1 + 2k^2}, -frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2}). The slope of line PQ is frac{2k}{1 - 2k^2}, so the equation of line PQ is y - frac{8k}{1 + 2k^2} = frac{2k}{1 - 2k^2}(x - frac{4 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2}). The distance between point A(-4, 0) and line PQ is d = frac{8|k|}{sqrt{1 + 4k^2}}. The length of PQ is |PQ| = frac{8sqrt{1 + 4k^2}}{1 + 2k^2}, so the area of triangle PAQ is S = frac{1}{2}|PQ| cdot d = frac{1}{2} times frac{8sqrt{1 + 4k^2}}{1 + 2k^2} times frac{8|k|}{sqrt{1 + 4k^2}} = frac{32|k|}{1 + 2k^2} = frac{32}{frac{1}{|k|} + 2|k|} leqslant frac{32}{2sqrt{2}} = 8sqrt{2}, with equality if and only if 2|k| = frac{1}{|k|}, i.e., when k = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}.

Reverse Direction: Assume s is a divisor of p-1. Suppose s divides p-1. Then p-1 = sk for some integer k. Consider any m and n such that 0 < m < n < p. We need to show that it is impossible to have left{ frac{sm}{p} right} < left{ frac{sn}{p} right} < frac{s}{p}. Since sm equiv m cdot s pmod{p} and sn equiv n cdot s pmod{p}, and s divides p-1, the sequence s, 2s, ldots, (p-1)s modulo p is a permutation of s, 2s, ldots, (p-1). Therefore, the sequence wraps around at p-1 = sk, meaning ks equiv p-1 pmod{p} and (k+1)s equiv s-1 pmod{p}, cycling back. This implies that the fractional parts left{ frac{sm}{p} right} and left{ frac{sn}{p} right} are not strictly increasing for 0 < m < n < p. Thus, if s divides p-1, it is impossible to find such m and n satisfying the given condition. Combining both directions, we conclude that there exist integers m and n with 0 < m < n < p and left{ frac{sm}{p} right} < left{ frac{sn}{p} right} < frac{s}{p} if and only if s is not a divisor of p-1. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"the geometric sequence {a_n}, the first term a_1= frac {2}{3}, a_4= int _{ 1 }^{ 4 }(1+2x)dx, find the common ratio.","output":"Since a_4= int _{1}^{4}(1+2x)dx=(x^{2}+x) |_{ 1 }^{ 4 }=18 and a_1= frac {2}{3}, According to the formula of geometric sequence, we have q^{3}= frac {a_{4}}{a_{1}}=27, Hence, q=3.

Therefore:      [      A + B + C = 20      ] 3. **Calculate individual distances:**    - Anderson, Brown, and Carter must each travel their portion of the journey using the bicycle and walking such that the total distance sums up to 20 km. 4. **Distance and time equations:**    - Establish the equations based on distance equals speed times time:      [      D = v times t      ]    - For Anderson:      [      D_{Af} + D_{Ab} = v_{Af} times t_{Af} + v_{Ab} times t_{Ab}      ]    - For Brown:      [      D_{Bf} + D_{Bb} = v_{Bf} times t_{Bf} + v_{Bb} times t_{Bb}      ]    - For Carter (assuming equal distances):      [      D_{Cf} + D_{Cb} = v_{Cf} times t_{Cf} + v_{Cb} times t_{Cb}      ] 5. **Summarize the distribution of distances and individual travel times:**    - Anderson travels ( 7 frac{11}{27} ) km, Brown travels ( 1 frac{13}{27} ) km, and Carter travels ( 11 frac{3}{27} ) km.    - This distribution ensures that their total contributions sum up to 20 km:      [      7 frac{11}{27} + 1 frac{13}{27} + 11 frac{3}{27} = 20 text{ km}      ] 6. **Travel time calculation based on respective speeds:**    - The total time taken by each must be the same ( T = 3 frac{8}{9} ) hours.    - Since the problem states that the traveling time for each is the same, it verifies that all participants will reach the destination simultaneously.

This quadratic equation has only one root, hence its discriminant is 0. This leads to a quadratic equation in k, where k_1 and k_2 must be its two roots.

Therefore, points A and B have coordinates (0,0) and (2,2) respectively. Let E(x_{0}, frac { x_{0}^{2} }{2}), where x_{0} neq 0 and x_{0} neq 2. The perpendicular bisector of AB has the equation y=-x+2. Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of AE can be written as: y = -frac{2}{x_{0}}x + 1 + frac{ x_{0}^{2} }{4}.

Gauss's theorem states that the roots of the derivative of a polynomial lie within the convex hull of the roots of the polynomial itself.

Since sides are positive, and rearranging terms, we get:    [    ef ge (a + c)(b + d)    ]    Since ( e ge f ), we can analyze in terms of extreme cases where ( e ) is much larger than ( f ). 5. **Bounding ( e ) and ( f )**:    Utilize geometric mean relationships or specific trapezoid properties if needed, particularly focusing on the difference:    [    left| sqrt{(a+c)^2 + (b-d)^2} - sqrt{(a+c)^2 + (d-b)^2} right|    ]    Knowing diagonal lengths ( e ) and ( f ), use algebraic manipulation, enforcing:    [    sqrt{e^2 - f^2} > sqrt{b^2 - d^2}    ] 6. **Final Steps**:    Clearly, it falls to ensuring that the lengths are appropriately bounded:    [    |e - f| > |b - d|    ]    Thus, the quadrilateral's properties and trapezoid specifics confirm our intended inequality. Conclusively, by rigorous bounding and applying theorem properties based on diagonals of quadrilaterals, the relation holds, ensuring the final boxed result: [ boxed{|e - f| > |b - d|} ] Completing the proof."},{"instruction":"Right triangle ABC has hypotenuse AB = 10 cm, and leg BC = 6 cm.

The sum of the perimeters of all the triangles is given as 300 cm.

Next, we determine the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 2. This can occur in two scenarios: 1.

For the multiple-choice questions, each question has 4 options, so there are ( 4^n ) ways to answer ( n ) multiple-choice questions. The total number of ways to write the answer key is the product of the number of ways to answer the true-false questions and the number of ways to answer the multiple-choice questions. According to the problem, this total is 480.

The prime factors in the numerator ( A_n ) and the prime bases of the denominator ( 2^{100} cdot 3^{100} ) determine if the fraction can be reduced further:     - ( A_n ) will vary based on the partial sum properties.     - Since the divisors count covers all forms (2^a cdot 3^b) (0 to 100), the sums (S_n) can include both even and odd numbers depending on the parity of their constituents. 4. **Reduction to Ensuring Distinct Denominators**:     Given these characteristics, we need to ensure that for (S_n), different ( A_n ) forms result in two potential distinct reduced denominators:     - For some (n), ( A_n ) will have sufficient factors of 2 and/or 3 to remain distinct whenever reduced by (6^{100}). 5. **Verification by Construction**:     When we explore the terms ( A_n ):     - Some (A_n) could only include even contributions (e.g., all terms involve (2^a cdot 3^b) where (a, b neq 0)), ensuring non-redundant power by either 2 or 3.     - Likewise, by arranging all odd terms initially, followed by even divisor sums, it's evident (S_n)’s partial sums fluctuate between needing either an added 2 factor divisor or left with just 3, preserving distinctions in partial sums.

The condition frac{alpha}{beta^2} being a real number and |alpha - beta| = 2 sqrt{3} guides us through the solution. 1. **Determining |y| from |alpha - beta|:**    From the given |alpha - beta| = 2 sqrt{3}, we have:    begin{align*}    |alpha - beta| &= |(x + yi) - (x - yi)|     &= |2yi|     &= 2|y| = 2 sqrt{3}.    end{align*}    Therefore, we find that |y| = sqrt{3}. 2. **Analyzing frac{alpha}{beta^2} being real:**    Since alpha and beta are conjugates, alpha^2beta^2 is real. Thus, frac{alpha}{beta^2} cdot alpha^2beta^2 = alpha^3 must also be real. Expanding alpha^3 gives:    begin{align*}    alpha^3 &= (x + yi)^3     &= (x^3 - 3xy^2) + (3x^2y - y^3)i.    end{align*}    For alpha^3 to be real, the imaginary part must be zero, i.e., 3x^2y - y^3 = 0. This simplifies to:    begin{align*}    y(3x^2 - y^2) &= 0.    end{align*}    Given |y| = sqrt{3}, y neq 0, so we must have 3x^2 = y^2. 3. **Finding x^2 and |alpha|:**    Since y^2 = 3, substituting into 3x^2 = y^2 gives 3x^2 = 3, leading to x^2 = 1. Therefore, the magnitude of alpha is calculated as:    begin{align*}    |alpha| &= sqrt{x^2 + y^2}     &= sqrt{1 + 3}     &= sqrt{4}     &= boxed{2}.    end{align*} This step-by-step approach adheres closely to the original solution, providing a clear path to the final answer."},{"instruction":"A line  l  is drawn through the intersection point  H  of altitudes of acuteangle triangles.

The critical points where the derivative equals zero are when: (4x - 2)ln x = 0, which implies x = frac{1}{2} or ln x = 0 (hence, x = 1). For f'(x) > 0, we need (4x - 2)ln x > 0: This occurs when both factors have the same sign; thus we have two cases: 1. x > frac{1}{2} and ln x > 0 (which is true for x > 1). 2. 0 < x < frac{1}{2} and ln x < 0 (which is not possible since ln x is positive for x > 1). For f'(x) < 0, we need (4x - 2)ln x < 0: This occurs when the factors have different signs; thus we have: frac{1}{2} < x < 1. Summarizing these results, the function f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{2}) and (1, +infty), while it is decreasing on (frac{1}{2}, 1).

Therefore, g(x) is increasing on (0, 1) and decreasing on (1, +infty). At x=1, g(x) attains its maximum with g(1) = 0. Thus, a must be greater than this maximum value of g(x), so a > 0.

Line l passes through F_{2}, intersects the hyperbola at points A and B, and has an angle of inclination of frac{pi}{2}. Also, triangle F_{1}AB is an equilateral triangle. We can deduce that point A is (c, b^2). Using the properties of an equilateral triangle, we get frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot 2b^{2} = 2c.

For the equation to hold, either (sin 2x - pi sin x = 0) or (sqrt{11x^2 - x^4 - 10} = 0):    First, solve (sqrt{11x^2 - x^4 - 10} = 0): [ 11x^2 - x^4 - 10 = 0. ]    This expression factors into cases where the quadratic goes to zero: [ 11x^2 - x^4 - 10 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 10) = 0. ]    Thus, the possible values are: [ x^2 = 1 quad text{or} quad x^2 = 10. ]    Therefore, we have: [ x = pm 1 quad text{or} quad x = pm sqrt{10}. ] 3. For (sin 2x - pi sin x = 0), use the trigonometric identity: [ sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x, ] so, [ 2 sin x (cos x - frac{pi}{2}) = 0. ]    This equation holds when: [ sin x = 0 quad text{or} quad cos x = frac{pi}{2}. ] - For (sin x = 0), the solutions are: [ x = kpi, quad k in mathbb{Z}. ] - For (cos x = frac{pi}{2}), (pi/2) is greater than 1, thus there is no practical solution in real numbers for ( cos x = pi/2 ). Hence realistic conditions only stem from ( sin x = 0 ). 4. Considering the valid solutions ( x = kpi ) within the previously derived domain for ( x ):    Within (left[-sqrt{10}, -1right] cup left[1, sqrt{10}right]), only the values ( pm pi ) are included since ( 0 < pi < sqrt{10} ). Thus, the complete solution set becomes: [ x in {-sqrt{10}, -pi, -1, 1, pi, sqrt{10}}. ] Conclusion: [ boxed{x in {-sqrt{10}, -pi, -1, 1, pi, sqrt{10}}} ]"},{"instruction":"Use the Horner's method to calculate the value of the polynomial (f(x)=x^{6}5x^{5}+6x^{4}+x^{2}+3x+2) when (x=2), and find the value of (v_{3}).","output":"According to Horner's method, we can rewrite the given polynomial as: [f(x)=x^{6}-5x^{5}+6x^{4}+x^{2}+3x+2=(((((x-5)x+6)x+0)x+1)x+3)x+2] When (x=-2), we can calculate the values of (v_{0}), (v_{1}), (v_{2}), and (v_{3}) as follows: [ begin{align*} v_0 &= 1  v_1 &= -2 + (-5) = -7  v_2 &= -7 times (-2) + 6 = 20  v_3 &= 20 times (-2) + 0 = boxed{-40} end{align*} ] Therefore, the value of (v_{3}) is (boxed{-40}).

Given f(1)=0, this means the point (1, 0) lies on the graph of the function y=f(x). Because the graph is symmetric around the line y=x, the point (0, 1) is also on the graph, which implies f(0)=1. After shifting the graph left by one unit, let's denote the new function as y=g(x)=f(x+1). It follows that g(-1)=1, and because y=g(x) is still symmetric around y=x, we have g(1)=-1. Utilizing the relationship imposed by the horizontal translation, we get f(2)=-1. Continuing in this pattern, we deduce: f(-1)=2, g(-2)=2, g(2)=-2; f(3)=-2, f(-2)=3, g(-3)=3, g(3)=-3; f(4)=-3; ...

(Here  K_{2017}  is defined as the complete graph on 2017 vertices, with an edge between every pair of vertices.)   *Proposed by Michael Ma*","output":"1. **Define the sets and subgraphs:**    - Let ( V ) be the set of vertices of ( K_{2017} ).    - Let ( E ) be the set of edges of ( K_{2017} ).    - For ( i = 1, 2, 3 ), let ( E_i ) be the set of edges labeled with ( i ).    - Let ( G_1 ) be the subgraph of ( K_{2017} ) with all vertices in ( V ) and all edges in ( E_1 ). 2. **Lemma:**    - Define a function ( f: V rightarrow mathbb{N} ) which associates each vertex with the maximum degree of vertices connected to it in ( G_1 ).    - We need to show that ( sum_{v in V} f(v) ge 2|E_1| ). 3. **Proof of the Lemma:**    - Define a function ( g: V rightarrow mathbb{Q} ) which associates each vertex with the average of the degrees of vertices connected to it in ( G_1 ).    - Clearly, ( g(v) le f(v) ).    - We need to show that ( sum_{v in V} g(v) ge sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 2|E_1| ). 4. **Calculation:**    - Let ( S ) be the set of ordered pairs of connected vertices in ( G_1 ).    - Then, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) = sum_{(u,v) in S} frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} ).    - Let ( S_1 ) be the set of unordered pairs of connected vertices in ( G_1 ) (i.e., ( S_1 equiv E_1 )).    - Then, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) = sum_{(u,v) in S_1} left( frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} + frac{deg(v)}{deg(u)} right) ).    - By the AM-GM inequality, ( frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} + frac{deg(v)}{deg(u)} ge 2 ).    - Therefore, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) ge sum_{(u,v) in S_1} 2 = 2|S_1| = 2|E_1| ). 5. **Return to the main problem:**    - Define a function ( h ) that associates each vertex with the number of edges in ( E_3 ) which start from it.    - Clearly, ( frac{1}{2} sum_{v in V} h(v) = |E_3| ). 6. **Relate ( h(v) ) and ( f(v) ):**    - Note that ( h(v) ge f(v) - 1 ).    - Consider the vertex ( u ) such that ( (u,v) in E_1 ) and its degree in ( G_1 ) is ( f(v) ).    - Define ( V_{1,u} ) as the set of vertices connected to ( u ) in ( G_1 ).    - Then, ( {v} times (V_{1,u} setminus {v}) subseteq E_3 ). 7. **Calculate ( |E_3| ):**    - ( |E_3| = frac{1}{2} sum_{v in V} h(v) ge frac{1}{2} sum_{v in V} (f(v) - 1) ).    - Therefore, ( |E_3| ge frac{1}{2} left( sum_{v in V} f(v) - 2017 right) ).    - By the lemma, ( sum_{v in V} f(v) ge 2|E_1| ).    - Hence, ( |E_3| ge |E_1| - frac{2017}{2} ). 8. **Minimum average calculation:**    - Since ( |E_3| ) is an integer, it must be at least ( |E_1| - 1008 ).    - The minimum average is reached when ( |E_3| ) is minimum.    - Therefore, the minimum average is at least:      [      frac{3(|E_1| - 1008) + |E_1| + 2 left( binom{2017}{2} - 2|E_1| + 1008 right)}{binom{2017}{2}} = frac{4033}{2017}      ] 9. **Verification:**    - This optimal situation is reached if all edges of ( K_{2017} ) are labeled with ( 2 ) except for edges connecting ( v_{2i-1} ) and ( v_{2i} ) for ( i = 1, ldots, 1008 ), which are labeled with ( 1 ).    - It is easily verifiable that in this case, the hypothesis is respected.

We need to prove:     [     frac{1}{4} < f_{n}(1) leq frac{1}{3}     ] 12. This is equivalent to proving:     [     3 leq 1 + left( 1 + frac{1}{n} right)^{n} < 4     ] 13.

Let's consider the expression (k^n - b^n), which is factored as: [ k^n - b^n = (k - b) left( k^{n-1} + k^{n-2}b + cdots + b^{n-1} right). ]    From this, we can see that (k^n - b^n) is divisible by (k - b). 3. Since for any (k neq b), (a - k^n) is divisible by (b - k), consider the difference: [ left( k^n - b^n right) - left( k^n - a right). ]    Simplifying the above expression, we get: [ k^n - b^n - k^n + a = a - b^n. ]    Therefore, for any (k neq b), the expression (a - b^n) is divisible by (k - b). 4. Because (k) can be any number other than (b), particularly, we can choose (k) such that (k) takes any different values. The only way (a - b^n) can be divisible by (k - b) for all such (k) is if (a - b^n = 0), which implies: [ a = b^n. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{a = b^n} ]"},{"instruction":"Solve [arcsin x + arcsin 3x = frac{pi}{2}.]","output":"From the given equation, we have  [arcsin 3x = frac{pi}{2} - arcsin x.] Thus, [sin (arcsin 3x) = sin left(frac{pi}{2} - arcsin xright).] Using the identity (sin(frac{pi}{2} - theta) = cos theta), we get: [3x = cos (arcsin x).] Since (cos(arcsin x) = sqrt{1 - x^2}), it follows that: [3x = sqrt{1 - x^2}.] Squaring both sides yields: [9x^2 = 1 - x^2,] or  [10x^2 = 1,] which simplifies to  [x^2 = frac{1}{10},] and hence  [x = pm frac{1}{sqrt{10}} = pm frac{sqrt{10}}{10}.] Verification of the solution: For (x = frac{sqrt{10}}{10}), we check if both (arcsin x) and (arcsin 3x) are within their valid domains. Since (3x = frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}), and (left|frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}right| = 0.9487) which is less than 1, the domain is satisfied.  Now, compute: [arcsin left(frac{sqrt{10}}{10}right) + arcsin left(frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}right) = frac{pi}{2}.] Thus, (x = frac{sqrt{10}}{10}) is a valid solution. Since (arcsin x) and (arcsin 3x) would be out of the principal value range for (x = -frac{sqrt{10}}{10}), we discard this as a valid solution.

Rebate amount = 6% of Rs. 6650                = (6/100) * 6650                = 0.06 * 6650                = Rs. 399 Now, let's subtract the rebate amount from the original price to find the price after rebate. Price after rebate = Original price - Rebate amount                    = Rs. 6650 - Rs. 399                    = Rs. 6251 Next, we need to calculate the sales tax on the price after rebate.

Гармонизированная система делится на главы, разделы и подразделы, представляющие разные категории товаров. Каждый товар или группа товаров получает свой уникальный код, состоящий из 6 цифр, называемый HS-кодом. Некоторые страны добавляют к этому коду дополнительные цифры для дальнейшей детализации и уточнения классификации на национальном уровне. # Пример структуры кода ГС: - Первые две цифры определяют главу (группу товаров). - Следующие две цифры указывают на товарную позицию внутри главы. - Последние две цифры в стандартном 6-значном коде ГС обозначают товарную подпозицию. # Примеры товарных позиций: - **0901** – кофе; обозначает всю категорию кофе внутри ГС. - **0901 21** – кофе необжаренный, обескафеинированный. - **0901 22** – кофе необжаренный, кроме обескафеинированного. Понимание товарных позиций важно для международных торговцев, поскольку они влияют не только на процесс таможенного оформления, но и на применение таможенных тарифов, налогов, импортных ограничений, правил происхождения товаров и статистики торговли.

La radio emitía una cumbia alegre, que contrastaba fuertemente con el ambiente tenso del vehículo. En el asiento trasero, completamente embalado de pies a cuello, se encontraba Jonathan, el delincuente más irritante con el que había tenido que lidiar en mucho tiempo. Y, para colmo de males, llevaba pañales. \\"Porque el viaje es largo\\", le había dicho Sofía antes de salir, sin poder contener la risa al ver su cara de indignación. —Esto es humillante, Sofía. ¡Es una violación de los derechos humanos! —se quejó Jonathan, retorciéndose como una oruga en su capullo de plástico. —Ay, dale, Jonathan. Pensá que es como estar en un spa de máxima seguridad. Además, ¿querés hacer un alto en cada estación de servicio? Con esos pañales, estás listo para el Récord Guinness al viaje más largo sin paradas —replicó Sofía, su voz rebosante de un sarcasmo tan afilado que podría cortar acero. Después de varias horas de viaje y de aguantar las quejas continuas de su pasajero especial, Sofía ya no podía más. La mezcla de furia y súplicas de Jonathan comenzaba a agotar su paciencia. Miró por el retrovisor y sus ojos se encontraron con los de él, que lanzaban chispas de ira. —Basta, Jonathan. Me vas a volver loca —dijo, mientras se detenía al costado de la ruta. Sofía buscó algo en la guantera y sacó un rollo de cinta de embalar con un gesto triunfal. Jonathan la miró, confundido primero y luego horrorizado al entender las intenciones de la oficial. —Mirá, Jonathan, te voy a ser sincera. O salimos de este auto siendo amigos o no salimos. Pero antes, tengo que amordazarte. Es por mi salud mental, ¿viste? Ahora, necesito tu consentimiento para esto... por las formalidades, claro —explicó Sofía, sin poder ocultar una sonrisa perversa. —¡Esto es insólito! ¿Consentimiento para amordazarme? ¿Estás loca? —Bueno, si querés podés negarte, pero te advierto que tengo muy buen oído y tu voz me está lastimando suavemente el tímpano... Vamos, decime que sí, así seguimos viaje. A regañadientes y después de una larga y tensa negociación, Jonathan finalmente asintió con la cabeza, furioso pero sin opciones. Sofía, siempre meticulosa, sacó su teléfono y grabó un video de Jonathan, dando su \\"permiso\\" para ser amordazado para lo que restaba del viaje. Una vez hecho, Sofía procedió a sellar la boca de Jonathan con la cinta, no sin antes asegurarse de que pudiera respirar correctamente. Al verlo finalmente en silencio, soltó una carcajada sincera que resonó en el tranquilo paisaje. —Te lo creíste, ¿no? Es completamente ilegal amordazar convictos. Ay, Dios mío, ¡la cara que pusiste! —dijo Sofía entre risas, mientras arrancaba el auto y retomaba la ruta. Jonathan, ahora doblemente humillado pero en silencio, solo podía fulminarla con la mirada. Sin embargo, en el fondo, no pudo evitar sentir un retorcido respeto hacia la oficial Celasco por su ingenio mordaz y su impecable sentido del humor, aunque nunca lo admitiría en voz alta, incluso si pudiera. Y así, con una oficial sofocándose de risa y un delincuente furioso pero amordazado, el viaje hacia el sur continuó, prometiendo ser una odisea tan hilarante como inolvidable."},{"instruction":"La misma escena, que sea más descriptiva en la cantidad de cinta que uso para la boca de Jonathan y la risa al decirle que era mentira......que tenga varios diálogos sofia irónicos al tener a Jony mudo","output":"# Capítulo 1: Redefiniendo la \\"Libertad de Expresión\\" El sol bajaba lentamente sobre la ruta desolada, lanzando largas sombras que se entremezclaban con el polvo levantado por el paso del auto de Sofía Celasco. Dentro del vehículo, un curioso contraste de emociones: Sofía, divertida y relajada al volante, y Jonathan, su compañero de viaje involuntario, cocoonizado en una compleja envoltura de cinta de embalar que lo mantenía más seguro que un bebé en su moisés; bueno, si no consideramos el detalle de los pañales. —Che, ¿todavía seguís insistiendo con eso de que te trato mal? Pensá en esto como en unas vacaciones todo-incluido. Tenés transporte, comida... bueno, cuando te quite la cinta, y los paisajes, mirá qué lindo atardecer —comentó Sofía, indicando con un ademán casual hacia el horizonte teñido de rosa y naranja. Jonathan mmmf-eó algo ininteligible, claramente furioso pero tan inofensivo como un cachorro enfadado. Los pañales crujían cada vez que intentaba moverse, haciéndolo aún más consciente de su humillante situación. Sofía, incapaz de resistir la tentación de inyectar otra dosis de su característico sarcasmo al viaje, detuvo el auto a un lado de la ruta y buscó en la guantera antes de sacar triunfante un rollo de cinta de embalar. —Mirá, Jony, esto va a ser por tu bien... y principalmente por el mío. La cuestión es que tengo dos opciones: o escucharte quejarte durante las próximas seis horas o disfrutar del viaje en paz. Y, sinceramente, elegí la paz mundial —explicó, mientras cortaba con cuidado un largo y generoso trozo de cinta. —Mmmph, ¡mmmph! —protestó Jonathan, entendiendo las intenciones detrás del gesto. —Necesito que asientas con la cabeza, querido. Decime que entendés que esto es por el bien común y por el amor a la serenidad en este vehículo —continuó Sofía, conteniendo una carcajada mientras filmaba con su celular la resignación en los ojos de Jonathan, seguido por un lento y derrotado asentimiento. Con la precisión de un artista, Sofía aplicó uno, dos, tres largos trozos de cinta sobre la boca de Jonathan, asegurándose de que su \\"permiso\\" quedara bien sellado. Jonathan lanzó una mirada que intentaba ser asesina, pero en su estado, lo máximo que logró fue parecer moderadamente ofendido. —Ay, mirá qué silencio más hermoso. Es como esa canción, ¿cómo era? Ah, sí. \\"El sonido del silencio\\". Tremendo hit —comentó Sofía, arrancando el auto de nuevo mientras se perdía en su propia carcajada. Jonathan intentaba comunicarse a través de gruñidos y miradas fulminantes, pero Sofía estaba demasiado entretenida respondiendo a sus \\"comentarios\\". —Ah, totalmente de acuerdo, Jony. La política es un desastre. —Una pausa, como si escuchara su respuesta. —Y sí, yo también creo que deberíamos comer más verduras. Mirá, ¡estamos teniendo el mejor diálogo de nuestra relación! Tras un rato, Sofía se giró con una sonrisa todavía más amplia, si es que eso era posible. —Ah, por cierto, olvidé decirte. Es completamente ilegal amordazar convictos. ¡La cara que deberías ver, Jony! —La carcajada que siguió resonó en el auto, alimentada aún más por la ira impotente pero completamente muda de Jonathan. Así, con una oficial absolutamente divertida al volante y un convicto silenciosamente furioso en el asiento trasero, continuaron su viaje por la ruta, marcando el principio de una de las aventuras más inusuales e irónicas de sus vidas."},{"instruction":"Sofia se detiene para ir al baño no si antes chequearlo el pañal a Jony para molestarlo.....antes de bajarse del auto ella le pone un barbijo paf a nadie lo vea así....muchos diálogos irónicos de sofia","output":"# Capítulo 1: Parada Técnica con Humor y Barbijo La ruta se extendía frente a ellos como una cinta sin fin, el sol ya habiendo cedido su lugar a un cielo salpicado de estrellas. A lo largo del viaje, el silencio de Jonathan había sido una bendición mixta; por un lado, Sofía disfrutaba de la paz, pero por el otro, no podía resistirse a la tentación de picarlo con su ingenio afilado, aunque fuera un monólogo unilateral. Finalmente, sentido la llamada de la naturaleza, Sofía ve una estación de servicio próxima y decide hacer una \\"parada técnica\\", como ella lo llamaba. Antes de bajar del auto, gira hacia Jonathan con una sonrisa traviesa. —Bueno, Jony, antes de que yo vaya al baño, deberíamos chequear tus... ehm, necesidades. No queremos accidentes, ¿verdad? —dijo, sin poder contener una risita al ver la indignación palpable en los ojos de su cautivo. Jonathan mmmf-eó algo que, sin duda, hubiera sido una sarta de insultos si no fuera por la cinta que sellaba su boca. Sofía, sin embargo, lo interpretó a su manera. —Ay, sí, qué considerada soy. Totalmente de acuerdo. —Levantando una ceja, simuló inspeccionar el estado del pañal de Jonathan, solo para añadir a su humillación. Luego, como si se le ocurriera una idea brillante, Sofía sacó un barbijo del guante y se lo colocó a Jonathan con un aire de solemnidad exagerada. —Ahí tenés, para que nadie te reconozca. Imaginate, el gran Jonathan en pañales, ¡sería la comidilla del pueblo! —comentó, claramente disfrutando de cada momento. Jonathan, ahora con barbijo y todavía embalado, parecía el protagonista de una comedia de errores muy mal planificada. —Mirá, si actuamos rápido y con suerte, tal vez hasta te confundan con un influencer experimentando una nueva tendencia de moda. \\"Minimalismo extremo\\", le podríamos llamar —continuó Sofía, saliendo del auto para dirigirse al baño. No sin antes echarle otra mirada a Jonathan, agregó: —Te dejo el ambiente climatizado con mi mejor selección de música para que te relajes. ¿Quién dice que no cuido a mis pasajeros? Las notas de una balada romántica invadieron el espacio, creando el contraste más absurdo con la situación. Sofía, antes de cerrar la puerta, le lanzó a Jonathan una mirada cómplice, como si él pudiera ser parte de su broma. —No te vayas a ninguna parte, ¿eh? Ya vengo. Y si necesitás algo, chiflá. —Sofía acompañó el comentário con una carcajada, sabiendo muy bien que el pobre Jonathan no podía hacer otra cosa que bufar en silencio. Ella caminó hacia el baño, sacudiendo la cabeza y pensando que este, definitivamente, sería un viaje para recordar. Mientras tanto, Jonathan se quedaba en el asiento trasero, contemplando las estrellas y preguntándose cómo había terminado en esta situación, barbijo incluido, a merced de la oficial más irónica y mordaz que había conocido jamás."},{"instruction":"Que cuando sofia le chequee el pañal se ponga unos guantes y al levantarle el chaleco note que el pañal es más chico que los q usaría el y encima tienen dibujos...solo para rerise antes de bajarse del auto","output":"# Capítulo 1: El Chequeo Pre-Baño Con la estación de servicio finalmente a la vista, Sofía no contuvo su entusiasmo por agregar una nueva capa a la broma que había venido construyendo durante el viaje. Aparcó el coche a un lado, bajo un farol que derramaba una luz amarillenta sobre el asfalto, y se giró hacia Jonathan con una sonrisa que prometía travesuras. —Es momento de un rápido chequeo. No podemos arriesgarnos a un... incidente, ¿verdad? —dijo Sofía mientras buscaba en la guantera, sacando de ella un par de guantes de látex con un dramatismo digno de una cirujana preparándose para operar. Jonathan, envuelto ya en su dignidad perdida, solo podía ofrecer una mirada que oscilaba entre la resignación y el desafío, mientras Sofía se ponía los guantes con un chasquido ceremonioso. —Tratemos esto con la seriedad que se merece, ¿sí? —comentó Sofía mientras procedía a una inspección superficial muy teatral, levantando cuidadosamente el chaleco de Jonathan para revelar el pañal que había debajo. Lo que vio la dejó momentáneamente sin palabras, antes de que una risa incontenible empezara a escapársele. El pañal, evidentemente más pequeño que cualquier talla razonable que Jonathan hubiera necesitado, estaba decorado con dibujitos animados, lo que lo hacía parecer más propio de una guardería que de un convicto en tránsito. —Ay, Jony, pero si es una edición limitada, ¿eh? Estos dibujitos... ¿Son hipopótamos? —Sofía no podía contener la risa mientras señalaba los coloridos dibujos impresos en el pañal—. Es que realmente te hice un favor, pensalo. Por lo menos ahora tenés temas de conversación para cuando te aburras. El rostro de Jonathan, tanto como la cinta y el barbijo permitían interpretar, era un poema. La combinación de furia, humillación y resignación era tal que Sofía decidió que si alguna vez dejaba la policía, podría dedicarse a ser comediante. —Bueno, parece que todo está en orden por aquí, no vamos a necesitar cambiar nada... todavía. —Sofía hizo una pausa dramática, aún con la risa bailando en sus ojos—. Ahora, si me disculpás, voy a hacer una parada técnica. Ya sabés, sin guantes esta vez. Diciendo esto, se quitó los guantes con el mismo chasquido exagerado y salió del coche, dejando atrás a un Jonathan que, a pesar de las circunstancias, no podría negar la originalidad de su captora. La noche continuaba pacífica, y el solo hecho de estar parados ahí, bajo la luz de la estación de servicio, rodeados de silencio salvo por el ocasional pasar de otro vehículo, le daba a la escena un aire surrealista. Sofía, mientras se alejaba, aún se reía suavemente.

Launched in 2013, it combines elements from various genres like looter-shooters, RPGs, and melee combat games, setting itself apart with its unique gameplay, complex lore, and the iconic space ninja theme. # Gameplay Players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryo-sleep to find themselves at war with different factions in the solar system. The game is known for its fast-paced parkour-style movement, extensive customization, and cooperative multiplayer missions. Players can engage in a variety of activities such as missions, quests, and events either solo or with up to three other teammates. # Mission Types and Economy Missions are diverse, ranging from sabotage, assassination of high-value targets, defense against waves of enemies, to stealth missions. The economy in Warframe is complex, involving various currencies, resources, and items that players can earn through missions, trade with other players, or purchase with real money. # Warframes and Weapons What sets Warframe apart is the titular Warframes — each a unique suit offering different abilities and playstyles. As of my last update in 2023, there are over 70 Warframes, each with its own set of four unique abilities that can be augmented through mods and customization items. Weapons in Warframe are just as varied, including traditional firearms, bows, melee weapons, and more exotic armaments, all of which can be customized and upgraded. # The Community and Development Digital Extremes has cultivated a strong community around Warframe, partly due to their responsiveness to feedback and the regular updates and expansions they release.

It is gradually revealed through quests, with major storylines involving the mysterious Tenno's origins, the nature of the Warframes, and the history of the solar system's factions. The \\"Second Dream\\" quest is particularly well-regarded for its storytelling and revelations about the player's character. # Challenges and Criticisms Despite its success, Warframe is not without its criticisms. New players often find the game overwhelming due to its complex systems and lack of straightforward guidance. The grind for resources and items can also be tedious without investing either significant time or real money. # Conclusion Warframe stands out as a testament to the potential of free-to-play models done right, offering deep, engaging gameplay, a supportive community, and continuous, expansive updates that keep the game fresh even years after its initial release. Whether you're interested in its lore, the cooperative play, or just the thrill of slicing through enemies as a space ninja, Warframe has something to offer.

Though it's challenging to encapsulate every minute nuance, several key reasons contributed significantly to the conclusion of this era: 1. **Soviet Economic Stagnation:** The Soviet Union's economy, burdened by the massive costs of the arms race, failed to keep up with that of the Western powers, particularly in areas of consumer goods and technological innovation. This stagnation made it increasingly difficult for the Soviet government to maintain its military spending and uphold the promises of socialism. 2. **Reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev:** After coming to power in 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced major reforms under the policies of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness). His efforts aimed at restructuring the Soviet economy and making the Soviet political environment more open and transparent significantly changed the political landscape within the USSR and its relationship with the West. 3. **Eastern European Revolutions:** Starting in 1989, a series of revolutions swept across Eastern Europe, leading to the fall of communist governments in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Many of these revolutions were largely peaceful, such as those in Czechoslovakia (the Velvet Revolution) and East Germany, which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and eventually German reunification in 1990. 4. **The Fall of the Berlin Wall:** The demolition of the Berlin Wall, which had served as the most potent symbol of the Cold War division between East and West, marked a significant turning point. It not only symbolized the failure of communist isolation but also galvanized further democratic movements within the Eastern Bloc. 5. **Nationalism and Independence Movements within the USSR:** The Baltics and other regions within the Soviet Union began to assert their desire for independence, fueled by Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost and perestroika, further weakening the Soviet Union’s hold on its satellite states and its own national territories. 6. **The Afghan War:** The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the subsequent war until their withdrawal in 1989 drained Soviet resources and morale, akin to the impact of the Vietnam War on the United States. It was a costly and unpopular war that further exacerbated the USSR’s economic and political problems. 7. **Diplomatic Efforts and Arms Reduction Treaties:** A series of negotiations and treaties aimed at reducing the nuclear arsenals and easing tensions between the superpowers, such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987, played a crucial role. These efforts were particularly championed by Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan and later George H.W. Bush. 8. **Changes in U.S. Policies:** The shift in the United States' approach towards the Soviet Union, especially under the Reagan administration, which initially took a hardline strategy but later engaged more constructively with Gorbachev's reformist USSR, helped ease hostilities. 9. **Soviet Union’s Dissolution:** The culmination of these economic issues, internal unrest, reform attempts, and loss of control over satellite states led to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The emergence of Boris Yeltsin as a key figure in Russian politics and the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union effectively dissolved, marked the end of the Cold War era. These primary factors, among others, contributed to the complex and multifaceted process that led to the end of the Cold War. The collapse was not the result of a single event or moment but rather a gradual process influenced by a confluence of internal and external pressures."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They are able to tackle complex problems with ease and showcase their knowledge with poise. In terms of volition, they are flexible and open-minded, willing to adapt their approach in order to achieve their goals. However, when it comes to emotions, FVEL tends to be insecure and unsure of themselves, often experiencing self-doubt and anxiety. Despite this, their logic remains unbothered and clear, allowing them to make rational decisions and problem-solve effectively."},{"instruction":"Assign it with MBTI and enneagram","output":"Based on the characteristics described, FVEL could be associated with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) type of ENTJ (Extroverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging) and the Enneagram Type 3 (The Achiever). ENTJs are known for their confidence, logical thinking, and ability to lead with a clear vision. They are often goal-oriented and decisive, which aligns with the description of FVEL in terms of confident physics and unbothered logic. Enneagram Type 3 individuals, also known as Achievers, are ambitious, success-oriented, and adaptable. They strive for achievement and recognition, and are often driven by a desire to excel and be the best in their field, which corresponds with FVEL's flexible volition and goal-driven mindset.

Thorough and careful planning is essential to the flow of the project and the success of the student. In the beginning, children use organizers to isolate an inquiry question. They then brainstorm what their procedure will be for research and identify the materials that they will need to do their research. Next, students select a way to display what they have learned in the form of a project. A target audience with whom to share their project is selected, ranging from their peers, to the principal, to their parents. The audience must be authentic and appropriate. For example, if students are working on a science inquiry on the topic of energy, they may choose to research how to harness hydropower to make a machine. A group may elect to make a working catapult. The culmination of the project might be a contest to see how far they can catapult a ball or an egg, with the class as the audience. Accountability to an audience coupled with a due date keeps students on track.","output":"PBL包含若干阶段。每个阶段都必须及时完成。深入而谨慎的规划对于项目的推进和学生的成功至关重要。一开始，孩子们使用组织者来确定一个探究问题。然后他们大脑风暴，规划他们研究的程序并找出他们需要进行研究的材料。接下来，学生们选择一种方式来展示他们学到的知识，形成一个项目。他们选择一个目标受众，可以是同龄人、校长，或是父母等。受众必须真实且合适。例如，如果学生们正在进行一个有关能源话题的科学探究，他们可能选择研究如何利用水力发电制作机器。一个小组可以选择制作一个真实可运作的弹射器。项目的高潮可能是比赛，看看他们能够多远地投射一个球或一个鸡蛋，全班同学作为观众。对于受众的责任和截止日期让学生保持在正确的轨道上。"},{"instruction":"Learning responsibility, independence, and discipline are three outcomes of PBL. The organizational blueprint that students have designed for themselves guides them and allows them to stay focused and on-task. As children become more proficient in the PBL approach, they learn to self-monitor their progress through daily agenda setting. At the end of each work session, students report on whether they have met their goals for the day. Students must use their work time effectively and stay focused and on-task to succeed. Goal setting helps students learn to manage their own time. It is important for the teacher to confer with students regularly to ensure that students are on track and developing their ideas and skills fully. These skills are critical for future success in both school and life.","output":"PBL的三个成果是学习责任感、独立性和纪律性。学生们为自己设计的组织蓝图指导着他们，让他们保持专注和任务导向。当孩子们在PBL方法上变得更加熟练时，他们学会通过每日议程设定来自我监控进展。在每个工作会话结束时，学生们要报告他们是否达到了当天的目标。学生们必须有效利用他们的工作时间、保持专注和任务导向才能成功。设定目标帮助学生学会管理自己的时间。老师定期与学生交流非常重要，以确保学生走在正确的轨道上，全面发展他们的想法和技能。这些技能对于未来在学校和生活中取得成功至关重要。"},{"instruction":"Students learn accountability with PBL through the daily goal setting, as well as through expectations of their peers. When students work collaboratively, there is an expectation that each child will contribute to the project equally. The group dynamic creates an interdependent team in which students must each do their part, and as a result, a natural consequence exists for those students who do not demonstrate accountability—others may no longer want to be paired with students who do not do their fair share. Therefore, peer pressure contributes to the accomplishment of ongoing group tasks throughout the learning process and the culmination of a successful final product. Students are conscientious because they must complete their project in the allotted time. They can be incredibly resourceful when time is of the essence. Accountability to peers often has greater consequences and provides more motivation for students than if they were only responsible to the teacher. Children do not want to let their friends down.","output":"学生通过PBL的日常目标设定以及对同龄人的期望，学习责任感。当学生合作工作时，有一个期望，即每个孩子都要平等地贡献到项目中。小组动态创造出一个相互依存的团队，学生们必须各自尽自己的一份责任，因此，对于那些未展现责任感的学生，存在一个自然的后果——其他人可能不再愿意与不尽公平份额的学生合作。因此，同龄人的压力有助于在整个学习过程中完成持续的小组任务，以及最终成功的产物。学生们要有责任感是因为他们必须在规定的时间内完成他们的项目。当时间紧迫时，他们可以变得非常有创造力。对同龄人的责任感常常具有更大的后果，为学生提供了比仅对老师负责更多的动机。孩子们不想让他们的朋友失望。"},{"instruction":"Project-Based Learning for the 21st Century: Skills for the Future","output":"21世纪的项目式学习：未来的技能"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши от первого лица. Пиши эмоционально с раздражением про невыносимые условия. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Странный автосалон, реально странный. Хотел купить у них Lada Vesta SW Cross — по заявке 1300000 р с хвостиком. Типа 8 цветов наличии, выбрал черную. Говорят черные 1658000 р, дефицитный цвет. Ну и с кредитом протащили. Заявку подал в сбер на авто под 9% через них, отказали. Первый автомобиль по автокредиту должен быть меньше миллиона. Менеджеры гнали на банк. И предложили потребительскую хню под 27%. через свои каналы. Название банка до этого ни разу не слышал. Неоправданно дорого и не вызывает доверия. Слишком большая выплата в месяц получается. Не стал связываться. Атмосфера в салоне болото. Видно, что пытаются нажиться и менеджеры из кожи лезут, чтобы впарить свой кредит даже в ущерб здравому смыслу. но получается через пень колоду — раз за разом-то одно и тоже и еще через клиента или даже чаще отказы получать. Злятся и выходят из себя. Не посоветую.","output":"1. Никогда бы не подумал, что покупка машины превратится в кошмар, но в салоне Декар это стало реальностью. Приглянулся мне Renault Kaptur, на сайте указали соблазнительную цену, но когда дело дошло до покупки, оказалось, что добавляются непонятные сборы, которые увеличивают стоимость на 20%! И при этом менеджеры умудрились предложить мне страховку вдвое дороже рыночной цены. Пытался добиться справедливости, но все было безтолку, только нервы потратил. Чувствую себя полностью обманутым и оставляю это как предупреждение для других. 2. Вот это разочарование… Думал, что в салоне Декар смогу легко и быстро оформить покупку Hyundai Elantra, которую выбрал еще до того, как пришел. Однако, столкнулся с абсолютно беспомощными менеджерами, которые либо не могли ответить на простые вопросы, либо пытались подсунуть мне явно ненужные опции. К тому же, после оглашения итоговой цены шок – оказалось на 25% выше обещанной! Видимо, их тактика – сначала заманить клиента низкой ценой, а затем выкачивать деньги. Ужасно раздражает такое отношение! 3. Похоже, что в салоне Декар ценят не клиентов, а свой кошелек. Иначе как объяснить, что за Volkswagen Polo мне насчитали цену на 30% дороже, чем было заявлено изначально? И это не считая того, что предлагаемые опции к авто оказались втридорога! Менеджеры, кажется, игнорировали все мои запросы и замечания, зато с энтузиазмом навязывали дорогие сервисы. Ощущение, будто ты не покупатель, а капля в море их прибылей. Настоятельно не рекомендую иметь дело с этим салоном - только потратите время и деньги. 4. Самая ужасная покупка в моей жизни произошла именно в салоне Декар. Планировал приобрести Mazda CX-5, но в итоге столкнулся с абсурдными манипуляциями со стороны менеджеров. Причем до того, как огласили итоговую цену, мне втридорога насчитали стоимость страховки и затем влепили штраф за якобы поздний отказ от сделки, когда я попытался отказаться из-за завышенной стоимости. Чувствовал себя как в ловушке, где каждый поворот – очередной способ выманить у меня деньги. Пожалуйста, обходите этот салон стороной. 5. Это был абсолютный ад, а не покупка автомобиля в салоне Декар. Решил купить Skoda Octavia, всё казалось нормальным до момента, когда начали появляться скрытые платежи. За каждую мелочь требовали доплату, а финальная стоимость оказалась на 40% выше, чем уверяли вначале. К тому же, когда я начал выражать свое возмущение, менеджеры оказались крайне грубы и непрофессиональны. Полный кошмар и разочарование. Любым способом пытаются выманить деньги. Никому не советую связываться с этим салоном!"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

做空中国金融市场的金融工具","output":"做空中国金融市场意味着投资者通过出售其预期下跌的资产来盈利。由于市场、法规和可用金融产品的不断变化，请注意我的回答是基于2023年4月的信息，随时间的变化，具体的投资工具和方法可能会有所不同。 截至目前，做空中国金融市场的金融工具主要包括： 1. **做空中国股票的交易所交易基金（ETFs）**：这些是在美国等地上市的ETF，允许投资者通过做空某一指数来投资中国市场。例如，做空沪深300指数的ETF。这些基金通过使用衍生品如期货和期权来实现做空的效果。 2. **期货和期权**：投资者可以通过交易在香港或其他国际衍生品市场上的中国股指期货和期权来做空中国股市。例如，恒生中国企业指数（H股指数）期货和期权就是一个例子，通过这些工具，投资者可以放空与该指数挂钩的资产。 3. **逆向ETFs**：这些特殊的ETF设计用来跟踪其基准的相反表现。例如，如果基准指数下跌，逆向ETF的价值就会上升。这样的ETF可以针对特定的中国市场指数，为希望做空中国市场的投资者提供方便。 4. **借贷股票进行卖空**：对于有能力参与更复杂交易的投资者，直接通过证券账户借入希望下跌的中国公司的股票，并将其卖出，等股价下跌时再买回还给借贷方，从中获益。 5. **差价合约（CFD）**：CFD是一种金融衍生品，它允许投资者对股票、商品、指数等资产的价格变动进行投机，而无需拥有这些资产。通过CFD，投资者可以做空中国的股票或指数，以期在价格下跌时获利。 请注意，做空市场或特定资产涉及高风险，因为理论上，做空的损失可能是无限的（因为价格上涨没有上限）。此外，上述某些工具可能涉及高级投资策略，适用于有经验的投资者。在涉足这些市场之前，进行充分的研究和风险评估非常重要。此外，不同国家的监管机构对这类投资活动的态度不同，应确保符合当地法律法规。"},{"instruction":"ETF代码是什么","output":"提供具体ETF代码前，需要明确一点：ETF（交易所交易基金）的代码和名称会根据它们交易的证券交易所而异。因此，针对之前提及的**做空中国金融市场**的ETF，我不能提供具体的实时代码而不知道您感兴趣的具体市场或指数。此外，新的ETF可能会推出，而旧的ETF可能会停止交易，因此任何提供的ETF代码都可能随时间发生变化。 举例来说，针对中国或香港市场的逆向ETF（做空ETF）、做空或逆向ETF在美国市场上可能较为常见，但需要特别注意的是，具体ETF的表现、策略和风险特征。 例如，对于希望追踪中国大盘股票并且提供相反表现的逆向ETF，投资者可能会找到像Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bear 1X Shares（代码：CHAD），这只ETF旨在提供与沪深300指数相反的日收益。 另外，对于投资者而言，重要的是了解ETF的具体投资目标、风险因素以及它是如何管理的。不同的做空ETF会采取不同的策略来实现其目标，这些策略可能包括使用衍生品如期权和期货，或者通过借股票来卖空。这些因素都可能对ETF的风险和回报特性产生影响。 注意：在考虑投资任何ETF，包括做空中国市场的ETF之前，至关重要的是需要做深入研究，并考虑咨询金融顾问。投资总是伴随风险，尤其是涉及做空或使用杠杆的金融工具时更是如此。"},{"instruction":"没有CHAD","output":"抱歉，我之前提到的CHAD ETF是用作示例，没有准确地反映当前市场上实际可用的做空中国相关ETF。ETF（交易所交易基金）的名称和代码可能会随着时间和市场条件的变化而变化，这意味着可用的ETF和其相应的特征可能有所不同。 如果你对做空中国金融市场或特定股票指数感兴趣，那么你需要查找当前可用的产品。例如，在美国市场上，存在着许多旨在提供中国市场指数（如沪深300指数或恒生指数）相反表现的逆向ETF或做空ETF。 为了找到最新的、特定目的的ETF，我建议： 1. **使用金融新闻网站和市场研究工具**：像彭博、路透和雅虎财经等平台通常可以提供最新的ETF信息和数据。 2. **直接访问ETF发行商的网站**：如Direxion、ProShares等是知名的做空和杠杆ETF提供者，他们会在官方网站列出旗下的ETF产品，并提供详细的产品说明和市场表现数据。 3. **咨询专业的金融顾问或经纪人**：他们通常具有最新的市场信息，并能提供专业的投资建议。 请记住，在考虑任何形式的投资，特别是做空和使用杠杆的ETF投资时，了解相关产品的风险是非常重要的。这类投资可能会带来高风险，包括损失部分或全部投资资金的可能性。因此，确保你完全理解你所考虑的投资产品，并考虑是否适合你的投资目标和风险承受能力。"},{"instruction":"아래 내용중에 가장 간단하게 사용하는 방법이 무엇일까? # Whisper [[Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/whisper) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) [[Model card]](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md) [[Colab example]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/whisper/blob/master/notebooks/LibriSpeech.ipynb) Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. Approach ![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png) A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets. Setup We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI's tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command: pip install -U openai-whisper Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies: pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run: pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git It also requires the command-line tool [\`ffmpeg\`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers: \`\`\`bash # on Ubuntu or Debian sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg # on Arch Linux sudo pacman -S ffmpeg # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) brew install ffmpeg # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) choco install ffmpeg # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/) scoop install ffmpeg \`\`\` You may need [\`rust\`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the \`pip install\` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the \`PATH\` environment variable, e.g. \`export PATH=\\"HOME/.cargo/bin:PATH\\"\`. If the installation fails with \`No module named 'setuptools_rust'\`, you need to install \`setuptools_rust\`, e.g. by running: \`\`\`bash pip install setuptools-rust \`\`\` Available models and languages There are five model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model; actual speed may vary depending on many factors including the available hardware. | Size | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed | |:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:| | tiny | 39 M | \`tiny.en\` | \`tiny\` | ~1 GB | ~32x | | base | 74 M | \`base.en\` | \`base\` | ~1 GB | ~16x | | small | 244 M | \`small.en\` | \`small\` | ~2 GB | ~6x | | medium | 769 M | \`medium.en\` | \`medium\` | ~5 GB | ~2x | | large | 1550 M | N/A | \`large\` | ~10 GB | 1x | The \`.en\` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the \`tiny.en\` and \`base.en\` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the \`small.en\` and \`medium.en\` models. Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of \`large-v3\` and \`large-v2\` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356), as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3. ![WER breakdown by language](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/266841/f4619d66-1058-4005-8f67-a9d811b77c62) Command-line usage The following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the \`medium\` model: whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model medium The default setting (which selects the \`small\` model) works well for transcribing English. To transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language using the \`--language\` option: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese Adding \`--task translate\` will translate the speech into English: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese --task translate Run the following to view all available options: whisper --help See [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) for the list of all available languages. Python usage Transcription can also be performed within Python: \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") result = model.transcribe(\\"audio.mp3\\") print(result[\\"text\\"]) \`\`\` Internally, the \`transcribe()\` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window. Below is an example usage of \`whisper.detect_language()\` and \`whisper.decode()\` which provide lower-level access to the model. \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") # load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds audio = whisper.load_audio(\\"audio.mp3\\") audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio) # make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device) # detect the spoken language _, probs = model.detect_language(mel) print(f\\"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}\\") # decode the audio options = whisper.DecodingOptions() result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options) # print the recognized text print(result.text) \`\`\` More examples Please use the [🙌 Show and tell](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) category in Discussions for sharing more example usages of Whisper and third-party extensions such as web demos, integrations with other tools, ports for different platforms, etc. License Whisper's code and model weights are released under the MIT License.

I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that.

I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do this. I’m not so natural that I’m able to do that. I just want you to just do it. Oh, by the halo. Oh, I don’t think there’s anything wrong. second. Oh, by the halo. I don’t think there’s that. You have really lost many of our members now. You are really lost. Yes, indeed. Or you want me to just leave those members earlier. Bring carrotethers. OK, let’s look at these. Okay. So everyone’s are great gestions. As far as you know, the year about 100 people, so there is a really big course. I’m sorry, but that’s that’s how it works. So you can read it. I will not this today. I can’t but so basically every course will be recorded. So I will go through the zoom. And then I will upload the video after the class. Probably one day after the class. So you can take a look again. I strongly recommend you to come to the class offline. And obviously I will use the electric attendance check system to check your attendance. And that’s going to be part of your grades, not that much, but small. But still that’s very important. But just in case you have some occasion and you cannot attend the course of frying, you can use online video to study by yourself. Sounds good. So this is quite important. You have to know calculus and linear algebra and also probability already. So I try my best to explain some necessary subject before I go into the concept. But if you don’t know those if you haven’t taken those courses before I recommend not to take this course. It’s up to you. I mean, you can take your own risk, but you shouldn’t complain that the course is too hard. Does make sense? You can study these topics first and then take this course later. So this course is. You will be there is going to be a lot of mathematics and also some probability and linear algebra. So hopefully your family with the topics already. And we’re going to have programming homework. So the target I mean, this course is cornerstone means you have to do some project or assignments. And I’m not going to do any project because I don’t know about it. You guys are great. So your business or I don’t want to give more pressure to your workload. But we need to do some programming assignments. Then every program assignments will be based on the Python. So if you don’t know about Python, you shouldn’t take this course. Sorry. That’s good. Any questions about background? And you have to do the English on me. I explain already. And exam is also English. You have to write answers in English. Everything is English except for live interaction with you guys. You can ask questions Korean. But I will use English. But sometimes I can use Korean to explain better. But I guess maybe 99% will be English. I know my English is not really good. But I try to slow. So that you can understand what I’m trying to say. That’s the most important thing. I change my mind this morning. So you’re going to have four programs. And then I just have to do the math assignments. 10% the attendance plus your participation. So if you ask questions or if you answer my question, then you will get some little bonus. important points at the end. And there is an electronic system in the back. So before you come to the tips, you have to check. You know how to use the app, right? So I’ve done this for about two or three years already. And I know the first class, there are a lot of people, like 100 students. And sometimes some students just check there and then just go away. It’s up to you. But sometimes I, but sometimes I call your name, maybe once or twice as a matter. And if you try to cheat, maybe you’re being trouble. But do you know that? And homework. 40%. So 10 points for homework. And so I want to do a lot of homework. But the thing is, you can’t do 100 students homework like every week. We don’t have that much research. If you want to learn more, you can do yourself. You can study by yourself. If I don’t ask you to do something. But there will be four homeworks. And try to exam 50% and there’s no meat term. It’s difficult for you. So. Yeah. So T first. We have two. Is it here? No, no. So you should contact T first. I will. You know, I will. I mean, there are my greatest. And I will talk with them. A weekly basis. So I will know the issues and the homeworks, whatever. But please use email. And with this. So that line. Start with this. This point. Otherwise, you may may not. We send to T on me. And so I will not check the icon for the message. So please don’t send the icon for the message to you. So this is. Temporal schedule. It may change over time. But topics are pretty obvious. So we are going to do basic machine learning and foundation behind the method. And. So first we start from linear regression. And also some optimization method. And then we are going to look at some probabilistic interpretation. And. And we’re going to learn how to do classification. It’s logistic regression. And then we are going to look at regularization. And also from generative learning algorithm. And meet on break. We don’t have any midterm exam. So just you can take some break. And then. Two neural networks. And also SDM support that come. And then on spot is learning came in. Caution, visual model. And expectation. Maximization, I go into. And finally, we’re going to do some dimensionally reduction. PCA and some others. So that’s my schedule. But it can be changed over time, depending on the schedule. So, I’m going to do some other issues. So. So from this year. The 16 weeks. For every course. And the final week. There’s going to be final exam. And. Yeah. And those are some reference. So if you want to study very hard, maybe you can read. Some textbook. And the CS 2 to 9 lecture. It’s very useful information. And I will also follow those lecture notes from time to time. So that’s also great. Way to learn. And. CS 4780. This is a great. And you can have YouTube lectures. So if you want, you can take a look. And also a lot of. Text book from. So classical textbook. From Bishop and Murphy and others. Any question about course logistics. Yep. Yeah. Only. Yeah. Only. Yeah. Have you taken linear algebra course. I think that should be okay. Good. Yeah, I think that should be fine. But again, it’s up to you. If you if you think you’re in that uniform, you can study by yourself before the course starts. Any other questions. Yeah. Yes. Yes. So every slide will be on. I will try my best. So most of the lectures slide before the class. I cannot guarantee. That’s right. Any other questions. No. So. My goal is to finish today by one. I’m going to. By the way, have you taken my undergraduate course. I see three zero forty five. Raise your hand if you take. If you took that course, please don’t take this course. So there are a lot of materials are redundant. Right. These need to leave it out of the band stand under the course. The contents are about the same. I don’t recommend you to take both courses. So usually first week. I don’t do any lecture, but I introduce. I’m going to do some examples of what we can do with machine learning. To motivate you to study hard. So I’m going to do some examples of what we can do. I’m going to study in this class because this course is about. Very basic methods before the team learning. Most of the listen machine learning breaks. But the contents that we are going to learn into course is. Literally, it’s a foundation. So you should know the concepts. Actually, before you study the dim learning and most, you know, listen techniques. But most of the example that I’m showing is basically all dim learning. And we are going to recover some neural network, which is the dim learning for two weeks, I guess. But that’s really basic stuff. And if you’re, if you’re hot about, you know, transformer or CNN, whatever, you know, fancy architecture, the people are talking about. It’s not covered by this course. If you’re a study that for the topics. You have to take that courses. We have a lot of course offerings in SKK. There are a lot of, you know, YouTube material, you can take a look. So object detection. It’s a very simple concept in given an image. Then machine learning or AI system is going to produce the bounding boxes and also laborers and so on. So there are a lot of information here, right? There’s car here in the stop sign. And then you can also throw, you know, load line in the load. So this object detection technique is called a technique of the self driving cars. And every self-train car company are using this technique. And another example. It’s called image segmentation. And given an image. And you’re going to labor able to pixel. So the AI of the machine learning is going to tell you which picture. Which category this picture belongs to. And this is person. And this is car. And this is tree. And this is load and so on. So image segmentation is also being used in many practical application, including self-train cars and others. And human pose automation. So many practical applications are related to what human do. And we can estimate the skeleton of the human pose so that we can use this technique to interact. So I don’t know some games or some metaverse. So detection segmentation and pose automation. Those are something that. Machine learning system. Recognize some concept in the image. But now this as you are know, generative model is getting really important. And. This images. And not the real images. This is images that produced by. Machine learning model. Actually, this is quite old. It’s already. This is. This is called dog ball. It’s dog and it’s a tennis ball. Any obviously this image doesn’t exist. You exist in the world. So there’s a kind of evidence that. Machine learning system can actually. Interest. Some new concept. Whether they memorize the training. If you are not example. This task is called novel view synthesis. Basically you take a picture of the same. And then some. Machine learning system. Take these images. For example, here. Maybe around. Say you were 30 images around the same from different view perspective. And then the machine learning can generate the infinite number of views. So basically can generate novel view images. Even though you never seen that images from your training. The pictures you take. It’s quite realistic. You can also express some reflectance here. And also, ML. And then you can. And then you can. Explain a really important role in medical images. Nowadays. Medical image analysis. The accuracy is going to be more than higher than 95% or something. It’s almost similar to what. That’s what. The doctor said. And. There are many startups and be companies to try to apply these techniques to. In real medical situation. And then you can actually detect. Some cancers and other disease. That doctors cannot recognize in your eye. It’s quite useful. The basically what happened in practice is that. The AI let doctors know that these regions might be. So suspicious. Then doctor take a look and double check. And maybe take another. Images. And so on. So they will improve. The. Their process. This is not surprising anymore because of such a pity. But even maybe three or four years ago. And then. And then. This is. Gmail. I’m using this all the time. So if you type a little bit, then. The ML automatically. Complete your sentence. And this is quite interesting example because. You type, you know, talk about your stay. And then. ML. Know the contents. And then it’s such as your. A completion of your. And co pilot. And you have used this one. When you call. It’s very useful. And. If you type some prompt here, just. Code function prototype. Then ML automatically complete. And. The rest of the code. This is working really good. And. I was told that. Once you start this. Program. Then you never go back to before. But it is really convenient. And Amazon Alexa Google Home. There are a lot of. A year of seasons. You can actually talk to an internet. To do something. I think that’s from our country. How I think. And Alpha goal. It’s already. Seven or eight years ago. 2015 or 16. I remember. And. And. For the first time. AI system. Bit. The human expert. And this game is so complex. And the number of complications. You can actually think of. It’s people say it’s more than. Number of Adam in the universe. You can actually do. For search. To. Simulator entire game. So. Pattern. You learn from the. The games. And. Was really surprising. And I remember at the time. The alpha. Alpha. Bit. This is all. Four to. One. The list. Only one. One game. But it turns out that they were so. And. Actually, big. The old version of Alpha goal. Maybe hundred to zero. The human is nowhere close to their. Performance. I made this slide maybe two years ago. I feel like all the contents are really out of date. You know, I mean. I have to think. And. So the. I spoke Google. And then it bit the human. Human professional player. It’s a little bit different than Alpha goal. Because the. The game is set. It doesn’t give you the full information. Right. The. If you look at this map, you can only see the map close to what. Where you are. And you have to guess what’s happening. In the high date area. So it’s a. The. The. The partially observable environment. And also. The actions pace. The. The controller space that you have to pick is really huge. Compared to. The goal or other simple games. It’s pretty impressive. And this is robot. Trying to the Rubik’s cube. And this robot is called shadow hands. And they have about the same number of. But the joints, the human fingers have. And they also have some contact sensors that they can feel something that they contact with them. And this is really. This is only seven years ago. But when first I can I saw this. This. The charity is really surprising. Right. They can. So in this is control program from robotics. And the people have tried this. This control forever. And they never imagined this is going to happen. But. This is based on the reinforcement running. It’s based on the simulation. And then you train your reinforcement system based on millions of. Trier. Without. Actually having the real robots. They apply the learn system to the real robot. And it’s kind of works. And self-taughting carditions obviously good example. And it’s also really hard problem. Did you guys hear the news that Apple. The car business. That means it’s really hard. And it’s the way more from Google. Tesla and geocrystance. They’re all good company. But it’s still far from. The 100% self-driving. Another example. Google has their own. The process. It’s similar to the chip. That. When they make their. AI processor. They use AI techniques to. Do something. Actually, I don’t know what they are trying to do. But some layout problem is really hard. But they said. The AI is much. Not much. But a little bit better than human can do. In their chip designing. This is another example. And alpha for. I’m going to show. The video. This is required. What’s the building. So I will play this video. I play this video. Every course. Then I’m teaching. I’m teaching. I’m teaching. We’ve discovered more about the world than any other civilization before us. But we have been stuck on this one problem. How the proteins follow. How the proteins go from a string of amino acids to a compact shape that acts as a machine. And drives life. When you find out about proteins, it is very exciting. You could think of them as little biological matter machines. And the building blocks that borrow everything living on the planet. If we can reliably predict protein structures using AI, that could change the way we understand the natural world. Protein folding is one of these holy grail type problems in biology. We’ve always hypothesized that AI should be helpful to make these kinds of big scientific breakthroughs more quickly. And then I’ll probably be looking up little to an end that might make it difficult. It should be causing this to come on at a back up. We’ve been working on our system alpha fold really hard now for over two years. Rather than having to do painstaking experiments in the future, biologists might be able to instead rely on AI methods to directly predict structures quickly and efficiently. Generally speaking, biologists tend to be quite skeptical of computational work. And I think that skepticism is healthy and I respect it. But I feel very excited about what alpha fold can achieve. The task is when we say, look, deep mind is doing protein folding. This is how good we are and maybe it’s better than everybody else. Maybe it doesn’t. We decided to enter cast competition because it represented the Olympics of protein folding. Yes, we started to try and speed up the solution to the protein folding problem. When we started cast in 1994, I certainly was naive about how hard this was going to be. It was very cumbersome to do that because it took a long time. Let’s see what we’re doing still to quickly. Typically a hundred different groups from around the world participating cast. And we take a set of 100 proteins and we ask the groups to send us what they think the structures look like. We can reach 57.9 GDT on cast well ground truth. Has a metric on which you will be scored, which is this GDT metric. On a scale of zero to 100, you would expect a GDT over 90 to be a solution to the problem. If we do achieve this, this has incredible medical relevance. The implications are immense from how diseases progress, how you can discover new drugs. It’s endless. I wanted to make a really simple system in the results of them surprisingly good. The team got some results with a new technique not only as it were accurate, but as much faster than the old system. I think we’ll substantially see what we’re doing right now. So then it’s going to be a game, game changer, I think. In cast 13, something very significant had happened. For the first time, we saw the effective application of artificial intelligence. We’ve advanced the state of the art in the field, so that’s fantastic. But we still have a long way to go before we’ve solved it. The shapes were now approximately correct for many of the proteins, but the details exactly where each atom sits, which is really what we would call a solution, were not yet there. It doesn’t help if you have the tallest ladder when you’re going to the moon. We hit a little bit of a brick wall since we won cast. Then it was back to the drawing board and like brought out new ideas. And then it’s taken a little while, I would say for them to get back to where they were, but with the new ideas. And then now I think we’re seeing the benefits of the new ideas, they can go further. So that’s a really important moment. I will see that moment so many times now, but I know what that means now. And I know this is the time now to press. We need to double down and go as fast as possible from here. I think we’ve got no time to lose. So the intention is to intercast again. As if it’s deeply stressful. There’s something we’re going on with the learning because it is learning something is correlated with GDT, but it’s not calibrated. I feel slightly uncomfortable. We should be learning this, you know, in the blink of an eye. The technology advancing outside deep mind is also doing incredible work. And there’s always the possibility another team has come somewhere out left field that we don’t even know about. Someone asked me, well, should we panic now? Of course, we should have been panicking before. It does seem to do better, but still doesn’t do quite as well as the best model. So it looks like there’s room for improvement. There’s always a risk that you’ve missed something. And that’s why blind assessments like Casper so important to validate whether or results are real. Obviously I’m excited to see how Casper 14 goes. My expectation is we go heads down, we focus on the full goal, which is solve the whole problem. The Prime Minister has announced the most drastic limits to our lives that the UK has ever seen in living memory. I’m going to give the British people a very simple instruction. You must stay at Alan. We were prepared for Casper to start on April 15th because that’s when it was originally scheduled to start. And it’s been delayed by a month due to coronavirus. I really miss everyone. No struggle a little bit just kind of getting into a routine, especially my wife. She came down with the virus. And we luckily didn’t turn out to be serious. Casper started on Monday. Can I just check this diagram you’ve got here John, this one where we ask ground truth. This is one we’ve done badly on. We’re actually quite good on this region. If you imagine that we hadn’t have said it came around this way, but had put it in that instead. Yeah. One of the hardest proteins we’ve gotten in Casper thus far is a source call 2 protein called or fake. Orphate is a coronavirus protein. We tried really hard to improve our prediction. Like really, really hard. Probably the most time that we have ever spent on a single target. So we’re about two thirds of the way through Casper. And we’ve gotten three answers back. We now have the ground truth for orphate, which is one of the coronavirus proteins. And it turns out we did really well in predicting that. Amazing job everyone. The whole team. It’s been incredible efforts. Here what we saw in Cas 14 was a group delivering atomic accuracy off the bat. Essentially solving what in our world is two problems. How do you look to find the right solution and then how do you recognize you’ve got the right solution when you’re there. All right, are we mostly here? I’m going to read an email. I got this from John Balls. Now this reading says John, as I expect you know. Your group has performed amazingly well in Cas 14. Both relative to other groups and an absolute model accuracy. Congratulations on this work. It is really outstanding. Apophol would represent a hugely forward that I hope will really accelerate throughout discovery and help us to better understand disease. It’s pretty my blessing. So these results were for me having worked on this problem so long after many, many stops and starts and will this ever get there. Suddenly this is a solution we solved the problem. This gives you such excitement about the way science works about how you can never see exactly or even approximately what’s going to happen next. There are always these surprises and that really as a scientist is what keeps you going. What’s the going to be the next surprise? Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. There is also movie alpha goal. She’s really. I really like it. When the new crane is always harsh with the wall continuing. It is. This is too long. I cannot play here. It’s one and a half hour. So when you’re relaxed time, please take a look. It’s really inspiring. So AI works through in science and medicine and biology. It’s really taking off right now. People try to make drugs from. They try to find new material with the machine learning. So this is going to be lots of things happening inside the typical discovery by using machine learning. So really excited. I’m going to show you. There are a couple more examples that I’m going to show today. I’ll check if it. Everyone knows. There’s a chat. I’m going to show you. And. And. Have you seen this before? You tied some tax and it generate the images. I mean, realistic. I mean, you know, for real, it’s time. They boom. They generate this image. Never in the world. Probably. And there’s a picture of Batman in an item. We don’t have these images in your work. Because Batman and Ironman is different thing. And they beautifully combine this concept together. And this is Ironman. If you notice. And also an example. I kind of like this one. If you ever come to have VGV US. There’s Walmart and Target. In the Walmart. It’s kind of E-Marth in Korea. But they have to Walmart. The signature color is blue. And then this logo. It’s Target logo. That they kind of combine this two. Which is amazing. And tax is a world that is kind of. The combined is to. Interesting. So, generally, they are. It’s really changing. But we are trying to generate some contents nowadays. This is a lot example that people. It’s doing research a lot. So you not just generate images. They generate. Really model. So if you imagine animation. And. And then you can use it. It’s going to be really useful. So you, you just type. Some tax. And then in generate. Really high resolution. 3D model. Then it can use in the other. Use cases. People this generation. The model. It’s really labor intensive. It is very, very much. It’s very very. It allows you to create. It can be managed by your hands. This is really time consuming. And annoying. And also, very expensive to make some. Some three model. But just give tax. Can generate. Highly nice. Is the example. The border training to generate. This model. And then it’s really quite. Nice. I think. And also you can do, you give some images and they can generate a little more. Chief. And I’m going to show last example that I think everyone knows right now. Have you ever heard about the open solar? Because you release a last six or two weeks before. And then the quality is this, this, this, this, this, Tony. I cannot actually believe. So it’s basically you give text and the each other video. And the quality is. Yeah, I cannot still believe this is happening. It’s crazy. Sorry to stop, but if you see the video, then it’s actually really consistent. It’s not just generating just random stuff. They just move camera to point right and then. It’s a people have actually tried to be concept. Really from their video and it actually work that means that. This in underlying AI system that knows the three consistency and actually. Computer graphics rendering. Knowledge inside the model, which is really surprising. I think. My favorite. My favorite. This is my favorite example. This is the. This is the person in the window. Yeah, here. It’s really scary. Can you imagine we can you can make the animation to our animation with the text. So there’s a technique that you can generate the. The audio as well. You can put the audio and then. Video. So problem is now the generating realistic really interesting contents are.

YouTube 강의도 있어요. 원한다면 살펴보세요. 그리고 Bishop, Murphy 및 기타의 고전적인 교과서도 많아요. 수업 운영에 대한 질문이 있나요? 네. 네. 네. 선형대수학 수업을 들었나요? 생각해보면 괜찮을 것 같아요. 네, 괜찮을 것 같아요. 하지만 다시 말하지만, 여러분에게 달려있어요. 만약 여러분이 그 과목에 자신이 없다면, 수업이 시작하기 전에 혼자서 공부할 수 있어요. 다른 질문이 있나요? 네. 네. 네. 각 슬라이드가 올라올 거예요. 최선을 다해 수업 전에 대부분의 강의 슬라이드를 준비할 거에요. 보장할 수는 없지만요. 다른 질문이 있나요? 없나요? 그러면. 제 목표는 오늘 한 시까지 마치는 거예요. 저는... 그런데, 혹시 제 학부 과정을 들었나요? 제가 가르친 CS3045 과정을 들었다면, 손을 들어주세요. 그 과정을 들었다면, 이 과정을 듣지 말아주세요. 많은 내용이 중복되거든요. 이 두 과정을 모두 듣는 것은 권장하지 않아요. 보통 첫 주에는 강의를 하지 않고, 이 수업에서 기계 학습으로 할 수 있는 것들의 예시를 들어 여러분이 열심히 공부하도록 동기를 부여하고 싶어요. 그러니 이 수업에서는 딥 러닝 전의 매우 기본적인 방법들을 배울 건데요. 많은 사람들이 기계 학습의 대부분을 딥 러닝이라고 생각하지만, 우리가 이 수업에서 배울 내용은 실제로 그 기초입니다. 그러니 딥 러닝과 대부분의 최신 기술을 공부하기 전에 이 개념들을 알아야 해요. 하지만 제가 보여줄 대부분의 예시는 기본적으로 모두 딥 러닝이에요. 우리는 약 두 주 동안 신경망, 즉 딥 러닝의 기본을 다룰 거예요. 하지만 만약 여러분이 트랜스포머나 CNN 또는 사람들이 이야기하는 다른 멋진 구조에 대해 듣고 싶다면, 이 수업에서는 다루지 않아요. 그러한 주제들을 공부하려면 해당 과정을 들어야 해요. 서울대학교에는 많은 과목이 있고, YouTube에서도 많은 자료를 볼 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 객체 탐지는 사진에서 AI 시스템이 경계 상자와 라벨을 생성하는 매우 단순한 개념입니다. 여기에는 많은 정보가 있죠, 예를 들어 여기에는 차와 정지 신호가 있고, 도로에는 선들이 그어져 있어요. 이 객체 탐지 기술은 자율 주행 차의 기술인데, 모든 자율 주행 차 회사들이 이 기술을 사용하고 있어요. 또 다른 예는 이미지 분할인데요, 주어진 이미지에서 AI 또는 기계 학습이 각 픽셀을 라벨링해요. 예를 들어, 이것이 사람이고, 이것이 차고, 이것이 나무고, 이것이 도로라고요. 이미지 분할도 자율 주행 차와 같은 많은 실용"},{"instruction":"whisper는 음성 지시 없이 수업 음성 같은 것을 넣으면 어떤 출력을 해주는가? 아래는 whisper의 README.md 이다. # Whisper [[Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/whisper) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) [[Model card]](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md) [[Colab example]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/whisper/blob/master/notebooks/LibriSpeech.ipynb) Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. Approach ![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png) A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets. Setup We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI's tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command: pip install -U openai-whisper Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies: pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run: pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git It also requires the command-line tool [\`ffmpeg\`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers: \`\`\`bash # on Ubuntu or Debian sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg # on Arch Linux sudo pacman -S ffmpeg # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) brew install ffmpeg # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) choco install ffmpeg # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/) scoop install ffmpeg \`\`\` You may need [\`rust\`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the \`pip install\` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the \`PATH\` environment variable, e.g. \`export PATH=\\"HOME/.cargo/bin:PATH\\"\`. If the installation fails with \`No module named 'setuptools_rust'\`, you need to install \`setuptools_rust\`, e.g. by running: \`\`\`bash pip install setuptools-rust \`\`\` Available models and languages There are five model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model; actual speed may vary depending on many factors including the available hardware. | Size | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed | |:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:| | tiny | 39 M | \`tiny.en\` | \`tiny\` | ~1 GB | ~32x | | base | 74 M | \`base.en\` | \`base\` | ~1 GB | ~16x | | small | 244 M | \`small.en\` | \`small\` | ~2 GB | ~6x | | medium | 769 M | \`medium.en\` | \`medium\` | ~5 GB | ~2x | | large | 1550 M | N/A | \`large\` | ~10 GB | 1x | The \`.en\` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the \`tiny.en\` and \`base.en\` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the \`small.en\` and \`medium.en\` models. Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of \`large-v3\` and \`large-v2\` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356), as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3. ![WER breakdown by language](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/266841/f4619d66-1058-4005-8f67-a9d811b77c62) Command-line usage The following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the \`medium\` model: whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model medium The default setting (which selects the \`small\` model) works well for transcribing English. To transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language using the \`--language\` option: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese Adding \`--task translate\` will translate the speech into English: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese --task translate Run the following to view all available options: whisper --help See [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) for the list of all available languages. Python usage Transcription can also be performed within Python: \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") result = model.transcribe(\\"audio.mp3\\") print(result[\\"text\\"]) \`\`\` Internally, the \`transcribe()\` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window. Below is an example usage of \`whisper.detect_language()\` and \`whisper.decode()\` which provide lower-level access to the model. \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") # load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds audio = whisper.load_audio(\\"audio.mp3\\") audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio) # make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device) # detect the spoken language _, probs = model.detect_language(mel) print(f\\"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}\\") # decode the audio options = whisper.DecodingOptions() result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options) # print the recognized text print(result.text) \`\`\` More examples Please use the [🙌 Show and tell](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) category in Discussions for sharing more example usages of Whisper and third-party extensions such as web demos, integrations with other tools, ports for different platforms, etc. License Whisper's code and model weights are released under the MIT License.

Trained on 680k hours of labelled data, Whisper models demonstrate a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains without the need for fine-tuning. Whisper was proposed in the paper Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision by Alec Radford et al. from OpenAI. The original code repository can be found here. Whisper large-v3 has the same architecture as the previous large models except the following minor differences: The input uses 128 Mel frequency bins instead of 80 A new language token for Cantonese The Whisper large-v3 model is trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudolabeled audio collected using Whisper large-v2. The model was trained for 2.0 epochs over this mixture dataset. The large-v3 model shows improved performance over a wide variety of languages, showing 10% to 20% reduction of errors compared to Whisper large-v2.

The models were trained on either English-only data or multilingual data. The English-only models were trained on the task of speech recognition. The multilingual models were trained on both speech recognition and speech translation. For speech recognition, the model predicts transcriptions in the same language as the audio. For speech translation, the model predicts transcriptions to a different language to the audio. Whisper checkpoints come in five configurations of varying model sizes. The smallest four are trained on either English-only or multilingual data. The largest checkpoints are multilingual only. All ten of the pre-trained checkpoints are available on the Hugging Face Hub. The checkpoints are summarised in the following table with links to the models on the Hub: Size Parameters English-only Multilingual tiny 39 M ✓ ✓ base 74 M ✓ ✓ small 244 M ✓ ✓ medium 769 M ✓ ✓ large 1550 M x ✓ large-v2 1550 M x ✓ large-v3 1550 M x ✓ Usage Whisper large-v3 is supported in Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers through the main branch in the Transformers repo. To run the model, first install the Transformers library through the GitHub repo. For this example, we'll also install 🤗 Datasets to load toy audio dataset from the Hugging Face Hub: pip install --upgrade pip pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git accelerate datasets[audio] The model can be used with the pipeline class to transcribe audio files of arbitrary length. Transformers uses a chunked algorithm to transcribe long-form audio files, which in-practice is 9x faster than the sequential algorithm proposed by OpenAI (see Table 7 of the Distil-Whisper paper). The batch size should be set based on the specifications of your device: import torch from transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline from datasets import load_dataset device = \\"cuda:0\\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \\"cpu\\" torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32 model_id = \\"openai/whisper-large-v3\\" model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained( model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True ) model.to(device) processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id) pipe = pipeline( \\"automatic-speech-recognition\\", model=model, tokenizer=processor.tokenizer, feature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor, max_new_tokens=128, chunk_length_s=30, batch_size=16, return_timestamps=True, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, device=device, ) dataset = load_dataset(\\"distil-whisper/librispeech_long\\", \\"clean\\", split=\\"validation\\") sample = dataset[0][\\"audio\\"] result = pipe(sample) print(result[\\"text\\"]) To transcribe a local audio file, simply pass the path to your audio file when you call the pipeline: - result = pipe(sample) + result = pipe(\\"audio.mp3\\") Whisper predicts the language of the source audio automatically. If the source audio language is known a-priori, it can be passed as an argument to the pipeline: result = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={\\"language\\": \\"english\\"}) By default, Whisper performs the task of speech transcription, where the source audio language is the same as the target text language. To perform speech translation, where the target text is in English, set the task to \\"translate\\": result = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={\\"task\\": \\"translate\\"}) Finally, the model can be made to predict timestamps. For sentence-level timestamps, pass the return_timestamps argument: result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True) print(result[\\"chunks\\"]) And for word-level timestamps: result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=\\"word\\") print(result[\\"chunks\\"]) The above arguments can be used in isolation or in combination. For example, to perform the task of speech transcription where the source audio is in French, and we want to return sentence-level timestamps, the following can be used: result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True, generate_kwargs={\\"language\\": \\"french\\", \\"task\\": \\"translate\\"}) print(result[\\"chunks\\"]) Additional Speed & Memory Improvements You can apply additional speed and memory improvements to Whisper-large-v3 which we cover in the following. Flash Attention We recommend using Flash-Attention 2 if your GPU allows for it. To do so, you first need to install Flash Attention: pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation and then all you have to do is to pass use_flash_attention_2=True to from_pretrained: - model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True) + model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True, use_flash_attention_2=True) Torch Scale-Product-Attention (SDPA) If your GPU does not support Flash Attention, we recommend making use of BetterTransformers. To do so, you first need to install optimum: pip install --upgrade optimum And then convert your model to a \\"BetterTransformer\\" model before using it: model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True) + model = model.to_bettertransformer() Fine-Tuning The pre-trained Whisper model demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to different datasets and domains. However, its predictive capabilities can be improved further for certain languages and tasks through fine-tuning. The blog post Fine-Tune Whisper with 🤗 Transformers provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning the Whisper model with as little as 5 hours of labelled data. Evaluated Use The primary intended users of these models are AI researchers studying robustness, generalization, capabilities, biases, and constraints of the current model. However, Whisper is also potentially quite useful as an ASR solution for developers, especially for English speech recognition. We recognize that once models are released, it is impossible to restrict access to only “intended” uses or to draw reasonable guidelines around what is or is not research. The models are primarily trained and evaluated on ASR and speech translation to English tasks. They show strong ASR results in ~10 languages. They may exhibit additional capabilities, particularly if fine-tuned on certain tasks like voice activity detection, speaker classification, or speaker diarization but have not been robustly evaluated in these areas. We strongly recommend that users perform robust evaluations of the models in a particular context and domain before deploying them. In particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent or purporting to use these models for any kind of subjective classification. We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes. The models are intended to transcribe and translate speech, use of the model for classification is not only not evaluated but also not appropriate, particularly to infer human attributes. Training Data The models are trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudolabeled audio collected using Whisper large-v2. As discussed in the accompanying paper, we see that performance on transcription in a given language is directly correlated with the amount of training data we employ in that language. Performance and Limitations Our studies show that, over many existing ASR systems, the models exhibit improved robustness to accents, background noise, technical language, as well as zero shot translation from multiple languages into English; and that accuracy on speech recognition and translation is near the state-of-the-art level. However, because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself. Our models perform unevenly across languages, and we observe lower accuracy on low-resource and/or low-discoverability languages or languages where we have less training data. The models also exhibit disparate performance on different accents and dialects of particular languages, which may include higher word error rate across speakers of different genders, races, ages, or other demographic criteria. Our full evaluation results are presented in the paper accompanying this release. In addition, the sequence-to-sequence architecture of the model makes it prone to generating repetitive texts, which can be mitigated to some degree by beam search and temperature scheduling but not perfectly. Further analysis on these limitations are provided in the paper. It is likely that this behavior and hallucinations may be worse on lower-resource and/or lower-discoverability languages. Broader Implications We anticipate that Whisper models’ transcription capabilities may be used for improving accessibility tools. While Whisper models cannot be used for real-time transcription out of the box – their speed and size suggest that others may be able to build applications on top of them that allow for near-real-time speech recognition and translation. The real value of beneficial applications built on top of Whisper models suggests that the disparate performance of these models may have real economic implications. There are also potential dual use concerns that come with releasing Whisper. While we hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making ASR technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication. Moreover, these models may have some capabilities to recognize specific individuals out of the box, which in turn presents safety concerns related both to dual use and disparate performance. In practice, we expect that the cost of transcription is not the limiting factor of scaling up surveillance projects.

This includes, but is not limited to, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics, and more. AI systems can perform tasks that would require intelligence if done by humans, such as: - Driving cars autonomously. - Diagnosing diseases from medical images or data. - Playing and competing in complex games like Chess or Go. - Generating human-like text, art, or music. - Making decisions in business or finance based on large datasets. # Data Compression Data compression is a method or technology aimed at reducing the size of data. It's used to save storage space or decrease the time needed for the transmission of data over networks. Compression can be lossless, where no data is lost in the process, or lossy, where some data is lost to achieve higher compression rates. # AI as “Glorified Compression” On a superficial level, this statement might find some grounding in the fact that a subset of AI techniques, particularly in machine learning and deep learning, involve encoding large amounts of data into more compact, efficient representations. For example: - **Neural Networks:** Deep learning models, especially deep neural networks, learn compressed representations of the input data during training. However, calling it \\"glorified compression\\" is an oversimplification because the aim is not just to compress but to understand, categorize, and even generate new data based on learned representations. - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) are used to reduce the number of variables in data, effectively compressing information while retaining the essence necessary for analysis or further learning tasks. However, reducing AI to \\"just glorified compression\\" misses the broader and more profound aspects of artificial intelligence: - **Understanding and Generation:** AI is not only about compressing or encoding information but also about generating new content, making decisions, understanding natural language, and more, which goes far beyond the domain of compression. - **Interaction and Adaptation:** AI systems can interact with humans and environments in a meaningful way, adapting to new situations and learning from them, unlike traditional compression algorithms. # Conclusion While there's an element of truth in the notion that AI, especially in the context of machine learning, involves encoding data in more efficient, compressed forms, calling AI \\"just glorified compression\\" is a significant underestimation of its capabilities, applications, and potential. AI is about seeking to emulate, augment, or surpass human intelligence in specific areas, a goal that encompasses far more than compression."},{"instruction":"Poszukuje dodatku do programu Blender który używa kamery tak jak w komiksie, potrafi tak rozciągnąć obiekty przed obiektywem aby widz na nich skupiał swoją uwagę.","output":"Aktualnie nie ma jednoznacznego dodatku do Blendera, który byłby bezpośrednio sprofilowany na imitowanie \\"komiksowego\\" użycia kamery w taki sposób, aby automatycznie rozciągać obiekty w pierwszym planie i zmuszać widza do skupienia na nich uwagi w stylu, który jest charakterystyczny dla komiksów. Techniki te, znane jako \\"foreshortening\\" oraz użycie perspektywy w dynamiczny sposób, często są realizowane manualnie przez artystów 3D poprzez manipulowanie kamerą i obiektami w scenie. Jednakże, możesz osiągnąć podobny efekt w Blenderze, wykorzystując kilka dostępnych narzędzi i technik: 1. **Manipulacja Soczewką Kamery**: Zmieniając długość ogniskowej kamery (focal length) w Blenderze, możesz manipulować percepcją głębi. Krótsze ogniskowe (szeroki kąt) przesadzą obiekty w pierwszym planie, czyniąc je bardziej dominującymi, podczas gdy dłuższe ogniskowe (teleobiektyw) spłaszczą scenę i zminimalizują różnice między przednimi a tylnymi planami. 2. **Kluczowe Klatki i Animacja**: Tworzenie dynamicznych scen, w których kamera i obiekty zmieniają swoje pozycje lub przeskalowania na przestrzeni czasu, jest kolejną techniką na naśladowanie dynamicznego ruchu charakterystycznego dla komiksów. Kombinując to z odpowiednim tempem animacji, możesz skupić uwagę widza na kluczowych elementach sceny. 3. **Kompozycja i Prowadzenie Oka**: Oprócz pracy z kamerą, ważne jest ułożenie elementów w scenie w taki sposób, aby kierowały wzrok widza tam, gdzie tego chcesz. Używaj kontrastu, kierunków linii, jasności i koloru, aby przyciągnąć uwagę do głównego obiektu. 4. **Postprodukcja i Efekty Wizualne**: Za pomocą systemu węzłów compositora w Blenderze, możesz dodatkowo manipulować obrazem, dodając efekty, które podkreślą styl komiksowy – na przykład poprzez zastosowanie nietypowych gradientów kolorów czy dodanie linii konturowych. Warto również eksperymentować z dodatkami do Blendera, które mogą nie być specjalnie zaprojektowane do tego celu, ale oferują funkcje przydatne w stylizacji komiksowej, takie jak freestyle dla linii konturowych, czy też dodatki do tworzenia toon shading. Jeśli szukasz bardziej zautomatyzowanego rozwiązania, warto śledzić aktualności związane z dodatkami do Blendera i forami poświęconymi grafice komputerową, gdyż środowisko wokół Blendera jest bardzo dynamiczne i regularnie pojawiają się nowe narzędzia stworzone przez społeczność."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) directly aim to reduce the dimensionality of data, essentially compressing information while retaining its essence. 2. **Efficient Data Representation**: Some machine learning models, especially in the realm of deep learning, learn to represent data in a more efficient manner. Autoencoders, for example, are designed to encode input data into a compressed format and then reconstruct it. This is a direct form of learning to compress data. 3. **Information Theory**: The connection between machine learning and information theory suggests a perspective where learning can be seen as a form of compression. By finding regularities and patterns, a model effectively compresses the information, making predictions based on these learned compressions. # Counterpoints: The Breadth and Depth of Machine Learning 1. **Beyond Compression**: While compression might be a component of machine learning, equating them fully overlooks the breadth of tasks and goals in ML. Machine learning encompasses a wide variety of algorithms and methodologies aimed not only at reducing data size or dimension but at making predictions, generating new data, understanding language, recognizing images and patterns, and much more. 2. **Reasoning and Cognition**: Some advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) systems are designed to mimic human cognition and reasoning to some extent. These include models that perform complex tasks like natural language understanding, game playing, and autonomous driving, which involve more than just compressing information but also entail understanding context, making decisions, and learning from interactions. 3. **Generative Models**: Another aspect that distinguishes machine learning from mere compression is the ability to generate new data instances. Generative models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are able to create data (e.g., images, text) that resembles the training data, showcasing a level of understanding and creativity not encapsulated by the notion of compression. # Conclusion The view of machine learning as \\"just glorified compression\\" highlights an important principle in terms of how some algorithms work by efficiently encoding and decoding information. However, this perspective is limited when considering the full scope and aims of machine learning. ML's capabilities extend far beyond compression, encompassing a wide array of tasks from simple regression to complex decision-making and creativity, which are not aptly described by the notion of compression alone.

Developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO), the HS is a six-digit identification code that is uniform across countries to facilitate the classification of goods in international trade. Here’s a breakdown of how it works: - **Structure**: The HS code is composed of six digits, organized into chapters (the first two digits), headings (the next two digits), and subheadings (the last two digits). This structure allows for the classification of thousands of different types of goods in a systematic and logical way. - **Expansion**: While the HS code itself consists of six digits, countries can add additional digits to classify goods more specifically according to their own tariff and statistical needs. For example, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States adds further digits to the six-digit HS code for more precise classification. - **Purpose and Use**: - **Customs Tariffs**: HS codes are used by customs authorities around the world to determine the duties and taxes that should be applied to imported and exported goods. - **Trade Statistics**: They also play a crucial role in the compilation of international trade statistics. - **Trade Regulations**: HS codes are used to apply various trade policies, including import restrictions, quotas, and anti-dumping duties. - **Global Adoption**: The HS code system is used by over 200 countries and economies as a basis for their customs tariffs and for the collection of international trade statistics. Over 98% of the merchandise in international trade is classified in terms of the HS. - **Updates**: The HS system is not static; it is updated every five years to reflect changes in technology or patterns of international trade. These updates ensure that the classification system remains relevant and up-to-date with current trade practices. Understanding HS codes is essential for exporters and importers because these codes determine the tariffs applied to goods, affect documentation requirements for shipments, and influence trade statistics. Correct classification of goods using HS codes is crucial for compliance with customs regulations and for minimizing the risk of delays or penalties during the import/export process."},{"instruction":"What is Within access commitment when calculatibg import duties","output":"The term \\"within access commitment\\" pertains to a concept related to tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) in international trade, particularly in the context of agricultural commodities. Tariff-rate quotas allow a specific quantity of a product to be imported at a lower or more favorable tariff rate (\\"within quota\\" or \\"within access commitment\\") up to a predefined limit. Once imports exceed this limit, any additional quantity (\\"over quota\\") is subject to a higher tariff rate. Here's how it works: 1. **Within Quota Rate**: Under a TRQ, a lower duty rate applies to imports of a product up to a certain volume. This volume is known as the quota. The aim is to protect domestic industries while still allowing a specific amount of imports at a reduced tariff, thereby fulfilling international trade commitments, such as those agreed upon in the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements or in bilateral or regional trade agreements. 2. **Over Quota Rate**: Once the volume of imports exceeds the established quota, any additional imports of that product are subject to a higher duty rate. This higher rate is often significantly more restrictive and is designed to protect the domestic market from being overwhelmed by imports. 3. **Calculation of Duties**: When calculating import duties for a product subject to a TRQ, it is essential to know whether the shipment falls within the quota limit (within access commitment) or if it exceeds the quota (over quota). The duty rate applied will significantly affect the total cost of importing the goods. Importers often need to apply for a quota allocation, and the process for doing this can vary by country and commodity. 4. **Administration**: TRQs can be administered in various ways, including on a first-come, first-served basis; by auction; through historical importers' shares; or by using import licenses specific to a country, region, or exporter.
