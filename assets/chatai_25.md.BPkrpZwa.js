To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s. So, the speed of each train in m/s is: 108 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 30 m/s Since the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Therefore, the relative speed is: 30 m/s + 30 m/s = 60 m/s The total distance to be covered when the trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is: 120 meters + 120 meters = 240 meters Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed To find the time it takes for the trains to cross each other, we divide the total distance by the relative speed: Time = 240 meters / 60 m/s = 4 seconds Therefore, it takes boxed{4} seconds for the two trains to cross each other."},{"instruction":"Consider 2018 pairwise crossing circles no three of which are concurrent. These circles subdivide the plane into regions bounded by circular edges that meet at vertices. Notice that there are an even number of vertices on each circle. Given the circle, alternately colour the vertices on that circle red and blue. In doing so for each circle, every vertex is coloured twice once for each of the two circles that cross at that point. If the two colourings agree at a vertex, then it is assigned that colour; otherwise, it becomes yellow. Show that, if some circle contains at least 2061 yellow points, then the vertices of some region are all yellow.","output":"1. **Define Variables**: Given ( n = 2018 ) circles, let's analyze the situation and ensure our understanding of terms: - **Vertex**: The point where two circles cross. - **Yellow vertex**: A vertex whose color differs on each circle that crosses at that point. - We need to show that if a circle has at least 2061 yellow points, there exists a region where all vertices are yellow. 2. **Lemma 1**: - **Statement**: If two circles intersect at points ( x ) and ( y ), then both ( x ) and ( y ) are yellow or neither. - **Proof**: Since each circle is alternately colored, the parity (odd/even nature) of vertices between intersections ensures consistency. Thus, if one intersection point is yellow, both must be, and vice versa. 3. **Lemma 2**: - **Statement**: For three intersecting circles ( C_1, C_2, C_3 ) at points ( x, y, z ), the set ( {x, y, z} ) contains an odd number of yellow vertices. - **Proof**: Consider ( C_1 cap C_2 = x ), ( C_2 cap C_3 = y ), ( C_3 cap C_1 = z ). Note that each circle crossing the cycle ( overline{xy} cup overline{yz} cup overrightarrow{zx} ) does so at an even number of points. Thus, counting bichromatic pairs and color transition consistency leads us to deduce an odd total of yellow vertices in ( {x,y,z} ). 4. **Bounding the Number of Yellow Vertices**: - If each region has at least one non-yellow vertex, consider a circle ( C ) with ( k ) yellow points. - These ( k ) yellow vertices form ( k/2 ) pairs, each pair resulting from ( k/2 ) intersecting circles (Lemma 1). - Lemma 2 reassures that additional intersecting circles deliver at least ( 2binom{k/2}{2} ) new yellow vertices. - Remaining ( n - k/2 - 1 ) circles intersect in non-yellow vertices adding ( 2binom{n-k/2-1}{2} ) yellow points. This yields: [ k + 2binom{k/2}{2} + 2binom{n - k/2 - 1}{2} = frac{k^2}{2} - (n - 2)k + (n - 2)(n - 1) ] 5. **Graph Analysis**: - ( G ) (the geometric graph of our circles) holds ( n(n-1) / 2 + 1 ) non-yellow vertices (since it composites degree 4 vertices, Euler's formula, and consistent face boundary non-yellow alternation). Thus: [ frac{n(n-1)}{2} - 1 geq frac{k^2}{2} - (n-2)k + (n-2)(n-1) ] Solving above restricts: [ k leq n + lfloor sqrt{n-2} rfloor - 2 ] Plugging actual values: [ 2018 + lfloor sqrt{2018-2} rfloor - 2 = 2018 + 44 - 2 = 2060 ] 6. **Consequently**: If some circle contains at least 2061 yellow points (contradicting the above): - It forces multiple circles' intersections to yield all yellow vertices in some region, hence proving our assertion. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The vertices of some region are all yellow.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Karl sells clothing in his store.

During a celebration for the opening of the new football season, 50 football fans are seated around a round table: 25 fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and 25 fans of the \\"Super Lions\\". Each of them declared: \\"The fan to my right is a fan of the 'Super Eagles'.\\" Could it be that there are an equal number of liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\"? : 1. Assume there are ( k ) liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and ( k ) liars among the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\". 2. Then, the total number of liars is ( 2k ). 3. Each fan claims that the fan to their right is a fan of the \\"Super Eagles\\". If this declaration is a lie, it means the fan to the right is actually a fan of the \\"Super Lions\\". Conversely, if the declaration is true, the fan to the right is genuinely a fan of the \\"Super Eagles\\". 4. If there are ( 2k ) liars, the statements \\"The fan to my right is a fan of the ‘Super Eagles’\\" are lies an even number of times, i.e., ( 2k ) times. 5. Therefore, the number of times the statement \\"The fan to my right is a fan of the ‘Super Eagles’\\" is false implies that there must be an even number of times this claim is false and therefore, according to the claim, an even number of \\"Super Lions\\" must appear twice consecutively. 6. However, recall the seating arrangement specifies exactly 25 fans from each team. If there were ( 2k ) fans representing an incorrect statement based on lies, this would imply that ( 2k ) is an even number representing inconsistencies around the table. 7. But since the fans are alternately seated and ( k ) is half the consistent fans which should account for fan types (Super Eagles and Super Lions) equally, its count would be odd versus evenly altering statements contrary to seating counts. 8. As there are 25 fans of each team (which is odd in summation for 50 and alternating roundly), such an arrangement would be impossible because, for every incorrect assertion (per fan seat adjacency) to be uniformly even-numbered (distributing knights and liars) contradicts the count variability. 9. Hence an equal number of liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\" is incorrect based on logical seating criteria and consistent truth-lie parity distribution. **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is impossible to have an equal number of liars among the fans of the \\"Super Eagles\\" and the fans of the \\"Super Lions\\" sitting as described. boxed{text{no}}"},{"instruction":"Kyle has a newspaperdelivery route.

The projections of point O onto the chords A_1A_3, A_1A_2, A_2A_3, A_3A_4, A_4A_1 are H_0, H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4 respectively. 2. Denote the distances from O to these chords as h_i = OH_i for i = 0, ldots, 4. 3. Let S_1, S_2 and p_1, p_2 be the areas and semiperimeters of the triangles A_1A_2A_3 and A_3A_4A_1 respectively, and let r_1, r_2 be the radii of the inscribed circles in these triangles. 4. Assume point O lies within triangle A_1A_2A_3 for determination and use Figure 37 for reference. 5. Apply Ptolemy’s Theorem (Theorem 69) to the cyclic quadrilaterals A_3H_0OH_2, A_1H_1OH_0, and A_2H_2OH_1. 6.

Applying the same theorem and approach to this case, we get: [ left( R + r_2 right) p_2 = H_0H_4 + H_0H_3 + H_3H_4 + S_2 ] Simplifying, we get: [ R + r_2 = h_3 + h_4 - h_0 ] 10. Summarizing, for both configurations, the sum of radii of the inscribed circles in the divided triangles is: [ r_1 + r_2 = h_1 + h_2 + h_3 + h_4 - 2R ] Therefore, the sum of the radii does not depend on the choice of the diagonal.

Since the sampling is stratified, we assume the proportion of male and female in the group to be the same as in the class. Therefore, the number of male and female students in the extracurricular interest group would be in the ratio 3:1, meaning there are 3 male students and 1 female student. **(II)** Let's denote the three male students as a_1, a_2, a_3, and the one female student as b.

First, we calculate the rate at which the tank is being emptied by the leak. Since the leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, the rate of the leak is: [ text{Rate of leak} = frac{C}{6 text{ hours}} ] Next, we calculate the rates at which the pipes fill the tank. Pipe A fills the tank at a rate of 4 liters/minute, which is: [ text{Rate of Pipe A} = 4 text{ liters/minute} times 60 text{ minutes/hour} = 240 text{ liters/hour} ] Pipe B fills the tank at a rate of 6 liters/minute, which is: [ text{Rate of Pipe B} = 6 text{ liters/minute} times 60 text{ minutes/hour} = 360 text{ liters/hour} ] When both pipes are opened and the leak is present, the net rate at which the tank is being filled is the sum of the rates of the pipes minus the rate of the leak.

Consider the equation formed by evaluating at the points (a_i) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, n): [ P(a_i) = f(a_i) cdot g(a_i) ] Since (a_i) is a root of the polynomial (P(x)), we have: [ P(a_i) = (a_i - a_1)(a_i - a_2) cdots (a_i - a_n) - 1 = -1 ] 2. Therefore, we get: [ f(a_i) cdot g(a_i) = -1 ] This implies that for each (a_i), either ( f(a_i) = 1 ) and ( g(a_i) = -1 ) or ( f(a_i) = -1 ) and ( g(a_i) = 1 ). 3. Now define the polynomial ( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) ). 4. Since either ( f(a_i) ) and ( g(a_i) ) are equal to ( 1 ) and (-1), respectively (in some order), we have for each ( a_i ): [ h(a_i) = f(a_i) + g(a_i) = 1 + (-1) = 0 ] Therefore, ( h(a_i) = 0 ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ). 5. Since ( h(x) ) has at least ( n ) distinct roots ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ), the polynomial ( h(x) ) must have degree at least ( n ). 6. However, we also know the degrees of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ): If ( f(x) ) has degree ( k ) and ( g(x) ) has degree ( m ), then: [ k + m = n ] 7. For ( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) ) to have degree (geq n), one of (f(x)) and (g(x)) must have degree (n) since adding polynomials cannot increase the degree more than the larger degree of the two. 8. However, if one of (f(x)) or (g(x)) had degree ( n ), then the other would have to be a constant polynomial (because (k + m = n)), contradicting our assumption that both (f(x)) and (g(x)) are nonconstant. # Conclusion: Therefore, our initial assumption that such nonconstant polynomials (f(x)) and (g(x)) exist must be false.

To prove that ( p_n > 3n ) for all ( n geqslant 12 ), we first organize all the natural numbers into groups of three numbers each: [ begin{gathered} (1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9), ldots, (34,35,36), (37,38,39), (40,41,42), ldots end{gathered} ] 2. Primes within these groups appear in a predictable pattern. Specifically, in the first 12 groups, we can determine that there are exactly 11 prime numbers ( {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31} ). 3. In any subsequent groups, each group consists of three consecutive integers, of which the last number of each group is divisible by 3, and one of the other two numbers is always even. Recall that a number which is even and greater than 2 is not prime. 4. From these properties, we observe that each group has at most one prime number after the initial 12 groups. 5. If ( n geqslant 12 ), then ( p_n ) - the nth prime number - must be in the ((n+1))th group or even further. This results from the fact that the 12th prime (37) occurs in the 13th group ((37, 38, 39)), which fits the grouping after 36. 6. Therefore, the ( n )-th prime would always exceed the upper bound of (3n). This is evident since: [ p_n > 3 times 12 = 36 quad (text{for } n = 12) ] 7.

This is because once you pick one shoe, there is only one other shoe that can match it (its pair). The total number of ways to pick any two shoes is given by the combination formula ( C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} ), where ( n ) is the total number of items to choose from, ( k ) is the number of items to choose, and ( ! ) denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways to pick any two shoes from 18 shoes is: [ C(18, 2) = frac{18!}{2!(18-2)!} = frac{18 times 17}{2 times 1} = 9 times 17 ] Now, we can set up the equation for the probability: [ P(text{matching pair}) = frac{9}{9 times 17} = frac{1}{17} ] The given probability is ( 0.058823529411764705 ), which is approximately ( frac{1}{17} ) (since ( frac{1}{17} approx 0.058823529411764705 )).

Each female citizen provides the information that her age is the average of the ages of all the citizens she knows. We aim to prove that the age of each female citizen can be uniquely determined in terms of the ages of male citizens. 2. **Base Case:** Consider the case when (n = 1), where there is only one female citizen. Let her age be (x), and assume she knows (k) citizens. Since she must know at least one male citizen, we can list the ages of the known citizens as (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k}). Thus, by the problem's condition, we have: [ x = frac{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k}}{k} ] Hence, the age of this female can be expressed in terms of the ages of male citizens, satisfying our goal for (n = 1). 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for any group of (n) female citizens, each female's age can be expressed as a linear combination of the male citizens' ages, i.e., [ x_j = c_{j1}a_{1} + c_{j2}a_{2} + cdots + c_{jm}a_{m} ] for some constants (c_{ji} geq 0) and (1 leq j leq n). 4. **Inductive Step:** We now consider the situation where there are (n+1) female citizens. Choose any one of them, say (A) with age (x_{A}), who knows (k) citizens. By the induction hypothesis, the age of each of the other (n) female citizens can be expressed as: [ x_i = c_{i1}a_{1} + c_{i2}a_{2} + cdots + c_{im}a_{m} + c_{ix}x_A, quad 1 leq i leq n ] where (c_{ij} geq 0) and (c_{i1} + c_{i2} + cdots + c_{im} + c_{ix} = 1), using the induction hypothesis. 5. **Summing the Ages of the Citizens Known by (A):** In this scenario, the sum of the ages of the (k) citizens known by (A) can be written as: [ text{Sum of ages} = k x_A = b_{1}a_{1} + b_{2}a_{2} + cdots + b_{m}a_{m} + b_{0}x_A ] where (b_{i} geq 0) and (b_{1} + b_{2} + cdots + b_{m} + b_{0} = k). Since (A) knows at least one male citizen who does not contribute to the coefficient of (x_A), we have (b_{0} leq k - 1). 6. **Solving for (x_A):** Rearrange the equation to solve for the age (x_A): [ k x_A - b_{0} x_A = b_{1}a_{1} + b_{2}a_{2} + cdots + b_{m}a_{m} ] [ x_A (k - b_{0}) = b_{1}a_{1} + b_{2}a_{2} + cdots + b_{m}a_{m} ] Hence, [ x_A = frac{b_{1}a_{1} + b_{2}a_{2} + cdots + b_{m}a_{m}}{k - b_{0}} ] This shows that (x_A) is still a linear combination of (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{m}) with non-negative coefficients, preserving the induction hypothesis. # Conclusion: By mathematical induction, we have shown that the age of each female citizen in the city can indeed be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of the ages of the male citizens, with non-negative coefficients.

Since there are three people, the total number of ways to arrange them in a row is the number of permutations of three distinct objects, which is 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6. Now, let's identify the arrangements where A is standing in front of B, and C is not standing in front of A.

We notice that only these two scenarios out of the six possible permutations meet the condition since in both cases, A is in front of B, and C is not in front of A.

However, this calculation is incorrect as it was based on a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements. The correct approach is to consider that after assigning one volunteer to each exit, the remaining volunteer can be assigned to any of the 4 exits, which is a simple combination problem, not requiring the permutation calculation initially described. The correct calculation is to use the stars and bars method, where we have 5 stars (volunteers) and 3 bars (to create 4 sections for the exits).

From the table, we see that 12 appears 6 times, which is more than any other value. Therefore, the mode is 12. **Median Calculation:** To find the median, we arrange the daily production quantities in ascending order. Since there are 16 workers, the median will be the average of the 8^{text{th}} and 9^{text{th}} values. Given the distribution, both these values are 12. So, the median is: [ text{Median} = frac{12 + 12}{2} = 12 text{ pieces} ] Therefore, the answers are: - Average: 12.5 pieces, - Mode: 12, - Median: 12. Part 2: Choosing the Daily Production Quota **Setting Quota at 13 Pieces:** If the quota is set at 13 pieces, only the workers with a daily production of 13 pieces or more will meet or exceed the quota. From the table, this includes 4 workers with a production of 13 pieces, 2 workers with 14 pieces, and 1 worker with 16 pieces, totaling 7 workers. This means 13 - 7 = 6 workers will be rewarded, not 3 as previously mentioned, which was an error in the initial solution. **Setting Quota at 12 Pieces:** If the quota is set at 12 pieces, workers with a daily production of 12 pieces or more will meet or exceed the quota. This includes 6 workers with 12 pieces, 4 workers with 13 pieces, 2 workers with 14 pieces, and 1 worker with 16 pieces, totaling 13 workers. This means 16 - 13 = 3 workers will not meet the quota, and thus 13 workers will be rewarded, which is beneficial for improving the motivation of the majority of workers. Therefore, setting the quota at 12 pieces is beneficial for improving the motivation of the majority of workers. Hence, the median should be chosen as the daily production quota.

Show that there exists a rectangle whose vertices are all the same color.","output":"To prove that there exists a rectangle whose vertices are the same color in a two-colored plane, let's consider the two colors to be red and blue. To simplify our argumentation, we start with a rectangular grid of dimensions ( 7 times 3 ), where every point on the grid is either red or blue. 1. **First Column Analysis**: - Consider the first column of 7 points. Since there are only 2 colors (red and blue), by the pigeonhole principle, at least (lceil frac{7}{2} rceil = 4) points must be of the same color. Without loss of generality, let’s assume these are 4 blue points. 2. **Reduced Grid Consideration**: - Now, reduce the problem to a (4 times 3) grid. This is done by considering only the rows that contain the 4 blue points in the first column. Thus, every row in this smaller grid contains a point that is blue in the first column. 3. **Second Column Analysis**: - We now examine the points in the second column of this (4 times 3) grid. There are 4 points in this column, and again by the pigeonhole principle, at least (lceil frac{4}{2} rceil = 2) points must be the same color. Suppose we find 2 blue points in the second column. - If we find 2 blue points in the second column, we have a rectangle with vertices that share the same color (since the first two columns now form a rectangle with vertices (blue, blue, blue, blue)). 4. **Counter-Case (Second Column Analysis)**: - However, if this is not the case, at least (lceil frac{4}{2} rceil + 1 = 3) points in the second column must be red (since we already assumed that the second column does not have at least 2 blue points). 5. **Third Column Analysis**: - Lastly, we check the third column in the (4 times 3) grid. By the pigeonhole principle, at least (lceil frac{4}{2} rceil = 2) points must be the same color. Suppose these 2 points are also red. - If this is the case, we now consider the configuration formed by the three columns: - The second and third columns have at least 2 points each which share the same color (in this case red). Therefore, we will have a rectangular arrangement among these two columns with all-red vertices. **Conclusion**: - In either of the analyzed cases, we will always find a rectangle whose vertices are all the same color (either all blue or all red). This confirms that within any (7 times 3) grid colored in two colors, there exists a rectangle with all four vertices of the same color.

Nhai needs to hire 60 more employees to finish it in time working a certain number of hours a day. How many hours a day should the new employees work?","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we know that 100 men can complete the entire highway in 50 days working 8 hours a day. This means the total man-hours required to complete the highway is: 100 men * 50 days * 8 hours/day = 40,000 man-hours After 25 days, they have completed 1/3 of the work. This means they have used: 100 men * 25 days * 8 hours/day = 20,000 man-hours Since 1/3 of the work is done, there are 2/3 of the work left to complete. The remaining man-hours required to complete the highway is: 40,000 man-hours (total) - 20,000 man-hours (used) = 20,000 man-hours (remaining) Now, NHAI is hiring 60 more employees, so there will be a total of: 100 men (original) + 60 men (new) = 160 men They have 25 days left to complete the remaining work. To find out how many hours a day the new employees should work, we divide the remaining man-hours by the number of men and the number of days left: 20,000 man-hours (remaining) / (160 men * 25 days) = X hours/day 20,000 man-hours / 4,000 man-days = X hours/day X = 5 hours/day Therefore, the new employees should work boxed{5} hours a day to complete the highway in time."},{"instruction":"Given that S_{n} is the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, with a_{1}=2, a_{1}+a_{4}=a_{5}, find the minimum value of n such that S_{n} > 32.

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is: [ 6 times 1 = 6 text{ square units} ] 2. **Consider covering the cube with rectangles:** Let's consider covering the entire surface of the cube using two equal rectangles of dimensions (1 times 3). Each rectangle will cover three adjacent faces of the cube. 3. **Determine the dimensions and area of each rectangle:** Each rectangle has dimensions (1 times 3), so its area is: [ 1 times 3 = 3 text{ square units} ] Thus, both rectangles together cover: [ 3 + 3 = 6 text{ square units} ] which matches the total surface area of the cube. 4. **Divide each rectangle into two equal triangles:** Next, cut each of these (1 times 3) rectangles along a diagonal from one corner to the opposite corner. This diagonal splits each rectangle into two congruent right triangles. 5. **Calculate the area of each triangle:** Since cutting a rectangle into two equal parts does not change the total area, the area of one triangle is: [ frac{text{Area of the rectangle}}{2} = frac{3}{2} = 1.5 text{ square units} ] 6. **Verify the triangles cover the entire cube's surface:** After cutting each (1 times 3) rectangle diagonally, we get two triangular pieces from each rectangle, making a total of four triangles.

How much does each box of pencils cost?","output":"Let's denote the cost of each box of pencils as P dollars. The school bought 20 cartons of pencils, and each carton contains 10 boxes. So, the total number of boxes of pencils is 20 cartons * 10 boxes/carton = 200 boxes. The school also bought 10 cartons of markers, with each carton costing 4. Since each carton contains 5 boxes, the total cost for the markers is 10 cartons * 4/carton = 40. The total amount spent by the school is 600, which includes the cost of both pencils and markers. We can set up the following equation to represent this: Cost of pencils + Cost of markers = Total cost (200 boxes * P dollars/box) + 40 = 600 Now, we can solve for P: 200P + 40 = 600 200P = 600 - 40 200P = 560 P = 560 / 200 P = 2.80 Therefore, each box of pencils costs boxed{2.80} ."},{"instruction":"Please ! help me on how do i set up this problem to answer it .

First, let's find out how much of the job each person can complete in one minute. Sylvia can complete the job in 45 minutes, so her work rate is: 1 job / 45 minutes = 1/45 of the job per minute Carla can complete the job in 30 minutes, so her work rate is: 1 job / 30 minutes = 1/30 of the job per minute When they work together, their work rates add up. So, the combined work rate is: (1/45) + (1/30) of the job per minute To add these fractions, you need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 45 and 30 is 90, so we convert the fractions: (1/45) = (2/90) of the job per minute (1/30) = (3/90) of the job per minute Now, add the two rates together: (2/90) + (3/90) = (5/90) of the job per minute Simplify the fraction: (5/90) = (1/18) of the job per minute This means that together, Sylvia and Carla can complete 1/18 of the job per minute.

Then there exists exactly one vertex ( w ), which we call the *center*, in the intersection ( P_x cap P_y cap P_z ), where the paths are taken to contain both vertices and edges. Furthermore, we have ( d_T(x,y) = d_T(x,w) + d_T(w,y) ) and similarly for the other pairs. 3. **Proof of Lemma**: - Consider the intersection of ( P_y cap P_z ). Both ( P_y ) and ( P_z ) are paths starting from ( x ), which is a leaf. At some point, they diverge and do not rejoin since ( T ) is a tree. - If ( w ) is the last vertex the paths share in common, then ( P_y cap P_z ) is a path from ( x ) to ( w ); let it be ( Q_x ). Similarly, define ( Q_y ) and ( Q_z ). - Notice that ( Q_x cap Q_y ), ( Q_y cap Q_z ), and ( Q_z cap Q_x ) are all equal to ( {w} ). - Furthermore, since a path from ( x ) to ( y ) is ( Q_x cup Q_y ) and there is only one such path, ( P_z = Q_x cup Q_y ) and similarly for ( P_y ) and ( P_x ). So, [ P_x cap P_y cap P_z = Q_x cap Q_y cap Q_z = {w}. ] - Finally, from ( P_z = Q_x cup Q_y ), we deduce ( d_T(x,y) = d_T(x,w) + d_T(w,y) ), and similarly for the other pairs. (blacksquare) 4. **Application of Lemma**: Notice that for any leaf ( x ) and non-leaf ( w ), we can find ( y ) and ( z ) such that ( w ) is the center of ( x, y, z ). Since ( w ) is a non-leaf, it has degree at least 3, so deleting it creates at least three connected components. Choose three vertices from different components with one of them being ( x ); this gives us our ( x, y, z ) with ( w ) as the center. 5. **Distance Preservation**: Next, we show that if ( w ) is a non-leaf vertex and the center of ( x, y, z ) in ( S ), and ( W ) is the center of ( f(x), f(y), f(z) ) in ( T ), then ( d_S(x,w) = d_T(f(x),W) ) and similarly for ( y ) and ( z ). - Define ( a = d(y,z) ), ( b = d(z,x) ), and ( c = d(x,y) ). From the lemma, we know there exist positive ( a', b', c' ) with ( a = b' + c' ), ( b = c' + a' ), and ( c = a' + b' ); such a representation is unique. - Let ( a'' = d_T(f(x), W) ), ( b'' = d_T(f(y), W) ), and ( c'' = d_T(f(z), W) ). Since ( W ) is the center of ( f(x), f(y), f(z) ), we have ( b'' + c'' = d_T(f(y),f(z)) = d_S(y,z) = a ). Similarly, ( c'' + a'' = b ) and ( a'' + b'' = c ). Therefore, ( a' = a'' ), ( b' = b'' ), and ( c' = c'' ). Then ( d_S(x,w) = a' = a'' = d_T(f(x), W) ), as desired. 6. **Define the Function ( g )**: - For a leaf ( v in S ), set ( g(v) = f(v) ). - For ( w ) a non-leaf vertex of ( S ), choose ( x, y, z ) with ( w ) as the center. Define ( g(w) ) as the center of ( f(x), f(y), f(z) ). By the previous paragraph, this is well-defined. 7. **Distance Preservation for All Vertices**: All that is left to show is that ( d_S(u,v) = d_T(g(u),g(v)) ) for all ( u, v in S ). - Delete ( u ) from ( S ) and choose two leaves ( x_u, y_u ) that are not in the same component as ( v ) or each other. Likewise, choose ( x_v, y_v ). - Then ( u ) is the center of ( x_u, x_v, y_u ) and ( v ) is the center of ( x_u, x_v, y_v ), with the path from ( x_u ) to ( x_v ) passing through ( u ) and ( v ) in that order.

We are given that ( f: mathbb{C} setminus A to mathbb{C} ) is an analytic function that is bounded. We need to prove that ( f ) is constant. 2. **Boundedness and the collection ( mathcal{S} ):** Since ( f ) is bounded, there exists a constant ( M ) such that ( |f(z)| leq M ) for all ( z in mathbb{C} setminus A ). Consider the collection ( mathcal{S} ) of pairs ( (X, g) ) where ( X ) is an open set such that ( mathbb{C} setminus A subset X subset mathbb{C} ) and ( g ) is an analytic extension of ( f ) to ( X ) with ( |g(z)| leq M ) for all ( z in X ). 3. **Ordering the collection ( mathcal{S} ):** We order the collection ( mathcal{S} ) by defining ( (X_1, g_1) leq (X_2, g_2) ) if ( X_1 subset X_2 ) and ( g_1(z) = g_2(z) ) for all ( z in X_1 ). 4. **Applying Zorn's Lemma:** If ( {(X_i, g_i)} ) is a chain in ( mathcal{S} ), then ( (cup_{i} X_i, g) ) where ( g(z) = g_i(z) ) if ( z in X_i ), is an upper bound of the chain. By Zorn's Lemma, there exists a maximal element ( (Y, h) in mathcal{S} ). 5. **Analyzing the maximal element ( (Y, h) ):** Since ( Y ) is an open set containing ( mathbb{C} setminus A ), the set ( mathbb{C} setminus Y ) is closed and countable. By Baire's Category Theorem, ( mathbb{C} setminus Y ) is either empty or has an isolated point. 6. **Case 1: ( mathbb{C} setminus Y ) is empty:** If ( mathbb{C} setminus Y ) is empty, then ( Y = mathbb{C} ). Thus, ( h ) is an analytic function on the entire complex plane that is bounded. By Liouville's Theorem, ( h ) must be constant. Since ( h ) is an extension of ( f ), ( f ) must also be constant. 7. **Case 2: ( mathbb{C} setminus Y ) has an isolated point:** If ( mathbb{C} setminus Y ) has an isolated point ( z_0 ), we can extend ( h ) to ( z_0 ) because ( h ) is analytic and bounded near ( z_0 ). This would contradict the maximality of ( (Y, h) ) because we could create a larger pair ( (Y cup {z_0}, h') ) where ( h' ) extends ( h ) to ( z_0 ). Therefore, this case cannot occur. 8. **Conclusion:** Since the case where ( mathbb{C} setminus Y ) has an isolated point leads to a contradiction, the only possibility is that ( mathbb{C} setminus Y ) is empty. Hence, ( f ) must be constant.

Since p lor q is true, and p land q is false, either p is true and q is false, or p is false and q is true. If p is true and q is false, the combined conditions are: [ 0 leq m < 4 quad text{and} quad (m geq 2 text{ or } m leq 1) ] Solving these gives us the ranges 0 leq m leq 1 and 2 leq m < 4. If p is false and q is true, then the conditions are: [ (m < 0 text{ or } m geq 4) quad text{and} quad 1 < m < 2 ] Since there is no m that satisfies these conditions simultaneously, this case contributes nothing to the final range.

In each step, select the largest remaining disk and remove it as well as any intersecting disks. 5. **Constructing the Subcollection**: - Continue the above process until all disks in the original collection have either been selected or removed because they intersect a previously selected disk. - Let ( S ) be the set of all disks chosen during this iterative process. By construction, the disks in ( S ) are pairwise disjoint. 6. **Verification of Coverage**: - Each selected disk ( D in S ) is replaced by ( 3D ), a disk with three times the radius. - Since every removed disk was removed due to intersection with a selected disk, (bigcup {3D : D in S}) will cover ( X ). # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that given a finite collection of disks covering ( X ), one can indeed find a pairwise disjoint subcollection ( S ) such that ( X subseteq bigcup {3D : D in S} ).

We start with the given equation for the vertices of the quadrilateral: [ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 ] This equation is known to have roots that are the non-unity fifth roots of unity. To see why, consider the factorization: [ (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = z^5 - 1 ] This shows that the roots of (z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0) are the fifth roots of unity excluding (z = 1). 2. The fifth roots of unity are given by: [ z_k = e^{2pi i k / 5} quad text{for} quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ] These roots are evenly spaced on the unit circle in the complex plane.

To determine the shape formed by these points, we plot them on the complex plane. The points (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) form a regular polygon (specifically, a quadrilateral) inscribed in the unit circle. 4. We need to determine the type of quadrilateral formed by these points. Since the points are the vertices of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the quadrilateral is symmetric. However, we need to check if it is a specific type of quadrilateral such as a rectangle, rhombus, isosceles trapezium, or square. 5. By symmetry and the properties of the fifth roots of unity, the quadrilateral formed by (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) is an isosceles trapezium. This is because the opposite sides are equal in length, and the angles between adjacent sides are equal, but not all sides are equal in length (which would be required for a square or rhombus).

Hence, one corner of the rectangle, denoted as ( P ), lies in the first quadrant with coordinates ( left( frac{a}{2}, frac{b}{2} right) ). 3. **Relationship of the Corner Coordinates**: - Given that the area of the rectangle is ( T ) (a constant), we can express this as: [ a cdot b = T ] The coordinates of ( P ) are derived by halving ( a ) and ( b ). Therefore, the coordinates ( left( frac{a}{2}, frac{b}{2} right) ) must satisfy: [ left( frac{a}{2} right) cdot left( frac{b}{2} right) = frac{T}{4} ] 4. **Identifying the Hyperbolic Path**: - Thus, the point ( P ) lies on the hyperbola defined by: [ xy = frac{T}{4} ] This reveals that one branch of the hyperbola represents all points ( P ) corresponding to one corner of rectangles centered at ( O ). 5. **Symmetry and Opposing Corners**: - The opposing corner to ( P ) will reflect across the origin, lying on the other branch of the same hyperbola. 6. **Considering Remaining Corners**: - The other two corners of the rectangle will similarly lie on coordinates whose product is the negative equivalent of ( frac{T}{4} ): [ xy = -frac{T}{4} ] - This corresponds to a second hyperbola. 7. **Enclosing the Region**: - Consequently, the located points ( P ) and symmetric counterparts fall within the branches of the hyperbolas ( xy = frac{T}{4} ) and ( xy = -frac{T}{4} ), extending infinitely. 8. **Conclusion**: - Since any point ( S ) in the region can be considered part of a rectangle's perimeter (with area ( T )), the rectangles with sides producing these points collectively blacken the paper along the regions defined by these hyperbolas. Hence, the shaded region is the entire set of points encompassed by the combined regions of the hyperbolas: [ xy = frac{T}{4} text{ and } xy = -frac{T}{4} ] **Conclusion**: Thus, the paper will be blackened along the regions of the two hyperbolas: [ boxed{xy = frac{T}{4} text{ and } xy = -frac{T}{4}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that the side lengths of an acuteangled triangle are 1, 3, and a, what is the range of values for a?

The total amount spent on each type can be represented as the product of the number of backpacks purchased and the unit price for each type.

To determine if {b_{n}} is periodic, note that: [ (n+10)^{2} = n^{2} + 20n + 100 ] Therefore, the unit digit of (n+10)^{2} is the same as n^{2} because 100 contributes 0 to the unit digit and 20n contributes tens to the digit.

Now, the unit digit of a_{n} = (1^{2} + 2^{2} + cdots + n^{2}) is equal to the unit digit of (b_{1} + b_{2} + cdots + b_{n}).

To prove this, consider: [ a_{n+20} = text{unit digit of} (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{n+20}) ] Due to the periodicity of {b_{n}} with a period of 10: [ b_{1} + b_{2} + cdots + b_{10} = 0 quad text{(unit digit)} ] [ b_{11} + b_{12} + cdots + b_{20} = 0 quad text{(unit digit)} ] Therefore: [ a_{n+20} = text{unit digit of} left( (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{10}) + (b_{11} + b_{12} + cdots + b_{20}) + (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{n}) right) ] Since unit digit of (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_m) = 0 for every complete 10 terms: [ a_{n+20} = text{unit digit of} (1^{2} + 2^{2} + cdots + n^{2}) = a_{n} ] 7.

Let the semiperimeter be ( s = frac{a + b + c}{2} ). 2. The points ( D ) and ( E ) are the points where the incircle touches the sides ( BC ) and ( AC ), respectively. Therefore, we have: [ BD = s - b quad text{and} quad DC = s - c ] 3. Using Stewart's Theorem, we can express ( AD^2 ) and ( BE^2 ) as follows: [ AD^2 = frac{(s - b)b^2 + (s - c)c^2}{a} - (s - b)(s - c) ] [ BE^2 = frac{(s - a)a^2 + (s - c)c^2}{b} - (s - a)(s - c) ] 4. Given ( AD = BE ), we have ( AD^2 = BE^2 ).

Therefore, the minimum value of left( x - frac{1}{2} right)^2 - frac{1}{4} is when left( x - frac{1}{2} right)^2 = 0, which gives us -frac{1}{4}. Since arcsin is defined from [-1, 1] to [-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}] and the minimum value for x^2 - x is -frac{1}{4}, we conclude that the range of y starts at arcsin left( -frac{1}{4} right). For the maximum value, since x^2 - x can never exceed 1 (the maximum input for the arcsin function), the maximum value of y will be frac{pi}{2}, which is the maximum output for the arcsin function within its domain.

Lemma: Let (ABCD) be a cyclic quadrilateral and (gamma_1) and (gamma_2) be the (C)-mixtilinear and (D)-mixtilinear incircles of triangles (ABD) and (ABC) respectively. The external common tangent (t) of circles (gamma_1) and (gamma_2) which is closer to (CD) is parallel to (CD). We will divide the proof into a few main claims. Claim 1: Let (ABCD) be a cyclic quadrilateral, and (omega_1) and (omega_2) be the incircles of triangles (ABD) and (ABC) respectively. The external common tangent (ell) of circles (omega_1) and (omega_2) different from (AB) is parallel to (CD). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_c21e1fe3d80c53dc08c8g-17.jpg?height=568&width=1060&top_left_y=921&top_left_x=178) **Proof:** Let (I_1, I_2) be the centers of (omega_1, omega_2) respectively, and let ( ell) touch (omega_1, omega_2) at (X_1, Y_1) respectively. Also, let (CD) intersect (AB) at (E). We know that: [ angle AI_1B = 90^circ + frac{angle ADB}{2} = 90^circ + frac{angle ACB}{2} = angle AI_2B ] Therefore, (AI_1I_2B) is a cyclic quadrilateral. We also know that lines (AB, X_1Y_1, I_1I_2) concur at the point (T), which is the center of homothety between (omega_1) and (omega_2). It can be easily seen that line (T-I_1-I_2) is the bisector of (angle X_1TA). Hence, we have: [ angle X_1TA = 2 cdot angle I_1TA = 2 cdot left( angle I_1AB - angle TI_1A right) = 2 cdot left( angle I_1AB - angle ABI_2 right) = 2 cdot left( frac{angle DAB}{2} - frac{angle ABC}{2} right) = angle DAB - angle ABC ] On the other hand, [ angle DAB - angle ABC = angle DAB - angle ADE = angle AED ] Thus, we have: [ angle X_1TA = angle AED, ] which implies that (ell) is parallel to (CD). Claim 2: Consider the homothety (mathcal{H}_1) with center at (D) which sends (omega_1) to (gamma_1), and homothety (mathcal{H}_2) with center at (C) which sends (omega_2) to (gamma_2).

We know that (J_1) lies on the bisector of (angle ADB), and (J_2) lies on the bisector of (angle ACB). Thus, lines (D-I_1-J_1) and (C-I_2-J_1) intersect at (Q), the midpoint of an arc (AB) of (odot(ABCD)) which doesn’t contain (C) and (D). We also know that (Q) is the center of (odot(AI_1I_2B)). It's a well-known property of the mixtilinear incircle that (T_1I_1) passes through (P), the midpoint of arc (AB) of (odot(ABCD)) which contains (C) and (D). The same holds for (T_2I_2). Let (O) be the center of (odot(ABCD)). We know that (O, J_1, T_1) are collinear, and that (O) is the midpoint of (PQ). Let the line passing through (J_1) parallel to (PT_1) intersect (PQ) at (R). Then (T_1J_1RP) is an isosceles trapezoid, hence (T_1J_1 = PR). On the other hand, from (RJ_1 parallel PI_1), we have that: [ frac{I_1J_1}{J_1T_1} = frac{I_1J_1}{PR} = frac{QI_1}{QP}. ] Analogously, we can prove that: [ frac{I_2J_2}{J_2T_2} = frac{QI_2}{QP}. ] Because (QI_1 = QI_2), we can conclude that: [ frac{I_1J_1}{J_1T_1} = frac{I_2J_2}{J_2T_2} = k. ] Let (r_1, r_2, rho_1, rho_2) be radii of circles (omega_1, omega_2, gamma_1, gamma_2) respectively. We know that the ratio of (mathcal{H}_1) is (frac{r_1}{rho_1}), and the ratio of (mathcal{H}_2) is (frac{r_2}{rho_2}). Also, we have: [ DI_1 = frac{r_1}{sinfrac{angle ADB}{2}}, quad DJ_1 = frac{rho_1}{sinfrac{angle ADB}{2}}. ] We know that: [ k = frac{I_1J_1}{J_1T_1} = frac{DJ_1 - DI_1}{rho_1} = frac{frac{rho_1 - r_1}{sin angle ADB}}{rho_1} ] which simplifies to: [ frac{r_1}{rho_1} = 1 - k cdot sin frac{angle ADB}{2}. ] Analogously, we can get: [ frac{r_2}{rho_2} = 1 - k cdot sin frac{angle ACB}{2}. ] Therefore, as (angle ADB = angle ACB), [ frac{r_1}{rho_1} = frac{r_2}{rho_2}. ] Claim 3: (t parallel ell) ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_c21e1fe3d80c53dc08c8g-18.jpg?height=709&width=1060&top_left_y=2007&top_left_x=181) **Proof:** Let (ell) touch (omega_1) and (omega_2) at (X_1) and (X_2) respectively. Let (Y_1) and (Y_2) be points on segments (DX_1) and (CX_2) respectively, such that (I_1X_1 parallel J_1Y_1) and (I_2X_2 parallel J_2Y_2). From (frac{DI_1}{DJ_1} = frac{r_1}{rho_1}) and (I_1X_1 parallel J_1Y_1), we have that (J_1Y_1 = rho_1). Therefore, (Y_1) lies on (gamma_1). Analogously, (Y_2) lies on (gamma_2). We know that: [ frac{DX_1}{DY_1} = frac{r_1}{rho_1} = frac{r_2}{rho_2} = frac{DX_2}{DY_2}. ] This means that because (CD parallel X_1Y_1), we have: [ CD parallel X_1X_2 parallel Y_1Y_2. ] Now, from (I_1X_1 parallel J_1Y_1), we have (I_1X_1 perp Y_1Y_2). So, (Y_1Y_2) is tangent to (gamma_1). Analogously, (Y_1Y_2) is tangent to (gamma_2). Therefore, line (Y_1Y_2) coincides with (t). Connection to Main Problem: Now let's conclude why the original problem follows from our main lemma. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_28_c21e1fe3d80c53dc08c8g-19.jpg?height=842&width=1054&top_left_y=550&top_left_x=181) We know that (CE) is tangent to the mixtilinear incircle of the triangle (ADF) and is parallel to (AB). From our main lemma, we can conclude that (CE) has to be tangent to the mixtilinear incircle of the triangle (BDF) as well because there exists a unique tangent line to the mixtilinear incircle of the triangle (ADF) which is parallel to (AB) and closer to (AB) than the center of that circle. Thus, there exists a circle tangent to (BD), (BF), (CE), and (tau).

However, since we are looking for P(X geqslant 1), which includes all values greater than 1, this probability is not directly symmetrical to P(-3leqslant X leqslant -1)=0.4. Considering the properties of the normal distribution, the probability of X being in the interval (-infty, -1] is 0.5 because -1 is the mean of the distribution.

It has 5/3 the number of teeth that a hammerhead shark has, so we calculate: Number of teeth in a mako shark = (5/3) * 30 = 50 teeth Finally, let's add up the number of teeth for all four sharks: Total number of teeth = 180 (tiger shark) + 30 (hammerhead shark) + 420 (great white shark) + 50 (mako shark) Total number of teeth = 680 teeth Therefore, all four sharks together have boxed{680} teeth."},{"instruction":"Jasmine now has access to three sizes of shampoo bottles.

Two players, A and B, take turns placing the circles on the vertices of a cube. After all circles are placed, if any edge of the cube has the same color on both ends, player A wins; otherwise, player B wins. Determine which player has a winning strategy in this game. 1. Let's denote the two players as Player A and Player B. 2. Each player has access to 8 small circles, colored as follows: - 2 Red - 2 Blue - 2 White - 2 Black 3. Players take turns placing these circles on the 8 vertices of a cube. The objective for Player A is to have at least one edge of the cube with circles of the same color at both ends. If Player A achieves it, they win. Otherwise, Player B wins. 4. Without loss of generality, let Player A make the first move. Suppose Player A places a circle on any vertex ( v_1 ) of the cube. 5. Player B's strategy is key to the game. Player B must place his circles in such a way that he can ensure that Player A never achieves the winning condition (i.e., an edge with both ends having the same color). 6. Player B can achieve this by applying the following strategy: **Mirror Placement Strategy** - Each time Player A places a circle on a vertex ( v_i ) of the cube, Player B places a circle of the same color on the vertex ( v_{j} ) which is directly opposite ( v_i ) relative to the cube's center. 7. To elaborate, the cube is symmetrical, and every vertex ( v_i ) has a corresponding opposite vertex ( v_{j} ). By mirrored placement: - When Player A places the red circle on vertex ( v_1 ), Player B places the red circle on vertex ( v_2 ) directly opposite ( v_1 ). - This mirroring continues for all turns taken by both players. 8. Why does this strategy ensure Player B’s win? - Any edge of the cube will connect a vertex and its neighbor. - If Player B places circles on the vertices opposite to Player A's placements, then each vertex's neighbor will always have a circle of a different color placed by Player B. Thus, there will not be any pair of vertices connected by an edge having the same color. 9. By using this mirroring strategy, Player B ensures that every time Player A places a colored circle on one vertex, the direct opposite vertex gets the same color circle from Player B, ensuring that no edge will have endpoints with circles of the same color, thus preventing Player A from winning. # Conclusion: Player B has a winning strategy by always placing the same colored circle on the vertex directly opposite to the one chosen by Player A. Therefore, Player B has a forced win. [ boxed{text{Player B wins}} ]"},{"instruction":"Félicie placed seven points inside a rectangle with dimensions 3 times 4.

Consider the term (frac{2}{a^x + 1}): Given that (y = a^x) is increasing, (a^x) increases as (x) increases, thus (a^x + 1) is also increasing. Consequently: [ frac{2}{a^x + 1} ] is a decreasing function because, as the denominator increases, the fraction decreases.

The derivative of h(x) is h'(x)=ln x-x. The second derivative of h(x) is h''(x)= frac{1-x}{x} < 0. Therefore, h'(x) is decreasing on (4,+infty). Thus, h'(x)_{max} > h'(4)=ln 4-4 < 0.

So we have: 307.50 = P * (1 + y/100)^2 - P 307.50 = P * [(1 + y/100)^2 - 1] 307.50 = P * [(1 + y/100 + y^2/10000) - 1] 307.50 = P * [y/100 + y^2/10000] (Equation 2) Now, we can use Equation 1 to express y in terms of P: y = 150 / P Substitute y in Equation 2: 307.50 = P * [(150/P)/100 + (150/P)^2/10000] 307.50 = P * [1.5/P + 22500/P^2] 307.50 = 1.5 + 22500/P Now, we can solve for P: 307.50 - 1.5 = 22500/P 306 = 22500/P P = 22500 / 306 P = 225 * 100 / 306 P = 22500 / 306 P = 75 * 100 / 102 P = 7500 / 102 P = 750 / 10.2 P = 7500 / 102 P = 73.52941176 (approximately) Therefore, the value of the amount invested is approximately boxed{73.53} ."},{"instruction":"The whole numbers from 1 to 2022 are written on the board.

For two numbers to have a GCD of 5, they both must be multiples of 5. The number must also be such that no higher common factor than 5 exists with 15. The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5, therefore, our number should ideally be a multiple of 5 but not a multiple of 3 to avoid a higher GCD. Now, we will look for multiples of 5 within the range of 70 to 80: - 70 = 5 times 14 (multiple of 5, but also of 2 which does not affect the GCD with 15) - 75 = 5 times 15 (multiple of 5, and also of 3, so the GCD with 15 is 15, not 5) - 80 = 5 times 16 (multiple of 5, and also of 2 and 4, not multiple of 3) Out of 70, 75, and 80, only 70 and 80 are not multiples of 3 and thus would maintain a GCD of 5 with 15. Since we need only one answer and the problem doesn't specify that there are multiple or that we select one, both seem to be potential answers under usual circumstances. However, for a single valid choice, confirming that we seek only numbers maintaining the GCD precisely to the asked value, 70 and 80 are each valid given no other restrictions were specified.

We can do this by using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time We know that the train passed a pole (which we can consider as a negligible distance compared to the length of the train) in 10 seconds, and the length of the train is 250 meters. So, the speed of the train is: Speed = 250 meters / 10 seconds = 25 meters/second Now, let's consider the time it takes for the train to pass a platform. We are given that it takes 60 seconds to pass the platform. During this time, the train covers its own length plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the platform as \\"P\\" meters. Total distance covered while passing the platform = Length of the train + Length of the platform Total distance = 250 meters + P meters We know the speed of the train is 25 meters/second, and it takes 60 seconds to cover the total distance.

Therefore, the sum of the internal angles angle A_1, angle A_3, and angle A_5 can be found by considering the corresponding intercepted arcs. 3. **Calculating the intercepted arcs:** Each internal angle angle A_i intercepts an arc of three vertices on the circle. For example, angle A_1 intercepts the arc overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6 A_7}. The measure of this arc is equal to the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc: [ overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6 A_7} = 360^circ - overarc{A_1 A_2} ] where overarc{A_2} = 180^circ as the center is within the heptagon, making the intercepted arcs summing up to 360^circ. 4. **Summing the angles:** By using the inscribed angle theorem and accounting for all such intercepted arcs for angle A_1, angle A_3, and angle A_5, the total intercepted subsequent arcs can aforementioned as follows: [ angle A_1 + angle A_3 + angle A_5 = frac{1}{2} left( (360^circ - overarc{A_7 A_1 A_2}) + (360^circ - overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4}) + (360^circ - overarc{A_4 A_5 A_6}) right) ] 5. **Evaluating the sums:** Simplify the summation inside the parenthesis: [ (360^circ - overarc{A_7 A_1 A_2}) + (360^circ - overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4}) + (360^circ - overarc{A_4 A_5 A_6}) = 1080^circ - (overarc{A_7 A_1 A_2} + overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4} + overarc{A_4 A_5 A_6}) ] Since combining any three internal arcs covered less than four meshes, thus we assert: [ overarc{A_7 A_1 A_2} + overarc{A_2 A_3 A_4} + overarc{A_4 A_5 A_6} geq 360^circ ] 6. **Final calculation:** Having such arcs converging all vertices resolving each arc itself lesser than 360^circ: [ angle A_1 + angle A_3 + angle A_5 < frac{1}{2} (1080^circ - 360^circ) ] [ = frac{1}{2} times 720^circ = 360^circ + 90^circ = 450^circ ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{angle A_1 + angle A_3 + angle A_5 < 450^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"Given a function f(x), if there exists x_0 in its domain such that f(x_0) = f(x_0) holds, then x_0 is called a local symmetry point of the function f(x).

From the properties of the parallelogram: [ OM = BM - BO = BM - BP ] - Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AC ), ( BM = MD ). Therefore: [ OM = MD - BP ] 4. **Finding ( PC ):** - Since ( P ) is on ( BC ), we have: [ PC = BC - BP ] - In the parallelogram ( ABCD ), ( BC = AD ). Therefore: [ PC = AD - BP = OD - BP ] - Since ( OD = MD + OM ), we have: [ PC = (MD + OM) - BP ] - Substituting ( OM = MD - BP ) into the equation: [ PC = (MD + (MD - BP)) - BP = 2MD - 2BP ] 5. **Calculating the Ratio ( frac{OM}{PC} ):** - We have: [ frac{OM}{PC} = frac{MD - BP}{2(MD - BP)} ] - Simplifying the ratio: [ frac{OM}{PC} = frac{1}{2} ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{2}})."},{"instruction":"For real numbers B,M, and T, we have B^2+M^2+T^2 =2022 and B+M+T =72.

Then for any ( r ) with (-2 leq r leq s), you can choose some of the blocks whose total weight is at least ( r ) but at most ( r + 2 ). **Induction Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), the smallest block weighs at least 1 and at most 2 (since the total weight is at most ( 2n = 2 )). Therefore: - The possible sums are 1, 2. - For any ( -2 leq r leq s ), choosing the single block will provide a weight between 1 and 2, satisfying ( r leq text{weight} leq r + 2 ). **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for ( n-1 ) blocks.

For (f(x)), we have: [ f(x) = frac{x - x^9}{1-x} + 10x^9 ] For (g(x)), we have: [ g(x) = frac{x - x^{11}}{1-x} + 10x^{11} ] 3. **Monotonicity of the Functions:** We observe that both (f(x)) and (g(x)) are strictly monotonic increasing for (x > 0). This is because the derivatives of (f(x)) and (g(x)) with respect to (x) are positive for (x > 0). 4. **Existence of Roots:** Since (f(x)) and (g(x)) are strictly increasing functions, the equations (f(x) = 8) and (g(x) = 8) each have at most one real positive root. 5. **Behavior at the Boundaries:** Evaluating these functions at the boundaries: [ f(0) = g(0) = 0 ] [ f(1) = g(1) = infty quad text{(since they diverge as } x to 1^-) ] Therefore, the roots must lie between 0 and 1. 6. **Bounding the Roots More Precisely:** Let us evaluate (f(x)) and (g(x)) at (x = 0.9): [ f(0.9) = frac{0.9 - 0.9^9}{1 - 0.9} + 10 cdot 0.9^9 ] Since (0.9^9) is very small, the numerator (0.9 - 0.9^9 approx 0.9) and the denominator is (0.1). Therefore: [ f(0.9) approx frac{0.9}{0.1} + 10 cdot 0.9^9 = 9 + text{(a small positive term)} ] Similarly, for (g(x)): [ g(0.9) = frac{0.9 - 0.9^{11}}{1 - 0.9} + 10 cdot 0.9^{11} ] Since (0.9^{11}) is even smaller: [ g(0.9) approx frac{0.9}{0.1} + 10 cdot 0.9^{11} = 9 + text{(an even smaller positive term)} ] 7. **Check for Negative Roots:** If (x leq -1), then (|10x^9|) is much larger than (|x + x^2 + cdots + x^8|) for (f(x)), and similarly for (g(x)). Thus (f(x) < 0) and (g(x) < 0) in this range, hence no roots. For (-1 < x < 0), the odd powers (x, x^3, ldots) are negative, and the even powers (x^2, x^4, ldots) are positive but smaller. Consequently: [ f(x) < x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + x^8 < 4 < 8 ] Similarly: [ g(x) < x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + x^8 + x^{10} < 5 < 8 ] Thus, there are no roots for (f(x) = 8) or (g(x) = 8) in the range (-1 < x < 0). 8. **Comparing the Roots:** Suppose (h) is the root of (f(h) = 8): [ f(h) = frac{h - h^9}{1 - h} + 10h^9 = h + (10 - 1)h^9 > frac{h - h^9}{1 - h} + 0.9^{10} approx 9 ] Now, comparing (g(h)): [ g(h) = frac{h - h^{11}}{1 - h} + 10h^{11} = h + (10 - 1)h^{11} > frac{h - h^{11}}{1 - h} ] Since the higher power terms of (h) in (g(h)) contribute less than in (f(h)), (f(h)) is marginally larger.

Let it enter the loop at point P after traveling from chord a to chord b. - If it completes a loop, it must return to P traveling the same path, contradicting that P was the entry point. Thus, no present enters a loop, and every present eventually reaches a sink. 5. **Paths Do Not Cross**: - Consider any two paths intersecting at point P, the intersection of chords a and b. - If one path moves from a to b and another moves from b to a, they only touch at P and do not further intersect. This means paths do not cross each other. 6. **Dividing the Circle and Paths**: - Each path divides the circle into two regions with paths connecting vertices within each region. - Every path splitting a region ensures that presents will be delivered to distinct endpoints, meaning all n sinks will receive a present. 7. **Ensuring Even Numbers**: - Vertices are evenly divided within each region as paths are directed from i to (i+n) mod 2n. - Starting at any vertex (e.g., vertex 1 with Tony), the circle gets divided into two halves, each containing an even number of vertices. 8. **Directing Paths and Sinks**: - Direct each chord from i to (i+n) mod 2n if 1 leq i leq k and from (i+n) mod 2n to i otherwise. - This ensures that vertices k+1 to k+n are designated as sinks. - This results in paths originating from various vertices delivering presents to evenly numbered vertices, ensuring all sinks (recipients) receive a present. # Conclusion: Thus, with the construction and the direction of each chord, Tony can successfully send presents to exactly n out of his 2n - 1 friends.

Given: The sides of a triangle are (a, b, c) and its area is (A). We need to prove that [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 geq 4sqrt{3} A. ] Step 1: Express the area (A) of the triangle.

The volume of the cubical box (V_box) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cube: V_box = side^3 Given that the edge of the cube is 30 cm, the volume of the box is: V_box = 30 cm * 30 cm * 30 cm V_box = 27,000 cm³ Now, we need to calculate the change in water level in the vessel when this volume of water is displaced by the box.

How many seconds does it take for the train to cross the pole?","output":"To find out how many seconds it takes for the train to cross the pole, we need to calculate the time taken by the train to cover a distance equal to its own length. First, we convert the speed from km/hr to m/s because the length of the train is given in meters. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 108 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 108 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 30 m/s Now, we know the speed of the train is 30 meters per second, and the length of the train is 210 meters.

We need to prove that ( PQ ) is parallel to ( AB ). 1. **Understanding the Circle and Symmetry:** Since ( O ) is the center of the circle and it lies on ( AB ), the line ( AB ) is the diameter of the circle. Hence, the circle is symmetric with respect to ( AB ). 2. **Angles Involving Point ( D ) and Its Reflection ( E ):** Points ( D ) and ( E ) are symmetric relative to ( AB ). Therefore, the arcs subtended by segments ( AD ) and ( AE ) are equal. Consequently, the angles ( angle ACD ) and ( angle ACE ) are equal: [ angle ACD = angle ACE ] 3. **Angles Related to the Diameter:** The points ( D ) and ( B ) both lie on the circumference of the circle with ( AB ) as the diameter. Therefore, the angles ( angle ABD ) and ( angle ACD ) subtending the same arc ( AD ) are equal: [ angle ABD = angle ACD = angle ACE ] 4. **Isosceles Triangle Insight:** The triangle ( OBD ) is isosceles with ( OB = OD ) as radii of the circle. Hence, the base angles ( angle OBD ) and ( angle ODB ) are equal: [ angle OBD = angle ODB ] 5. **Collecting Angle Relations:** Combining all the established equalities: [ angle ACE = angle ACD = angle ABD = angle ODB ] Let us denote these equal angles by ( varphi ): [ angle ACE = angle ACD = angle ABD = angle ODB = varphi ] 6. **Implications on the Quadrilateral ( PQCD ):** Consequently, in the quadrilateral ( PQCD ), we have: [ angle PDQ = angle PCQ ] This makes quadrilateral ( PQCD ) a cyclic quadrilateral, meaning ( PQCD ) can be inscribed in a circle. 7. **Further Angle Relationships:** Because ( angle POD ) is an external angle to triangle ( OBD ), and triangles ( OBD ) and ( ODP ) share the same line ( OD ), we get: [ angle AOD = 2varphi ] Since ( angle OPQ ) is subtended by the same arcs in the circumscribed quadrilateral: [ angle OPQ = 2varphi ] 8. **Conclusion on Parallel Lines:** Since ( angle AOD ) and ( angle OPQ ) are equal at ( 2varphi ), the lines ( AB ) and ( PQ ) are parallel.

Since the sequence ( {A_i} ) is a descending chain, ( A'_0 ) is well-defined and ( A'_0 subseteq A_i ) for all ( i ). 3. **Case 1: ( A'_0 = emptyset ):** If ( A'_0 = emptyset ), then we have: [ mu(emptyset) = emptyset ] This is because ( emptyset ) is a subset of every set, and by the property of ( mu ), ( mu(emptyset) subseteq mu(A_i) = A_{i+1} ) for all ( i ). Since ( A'_0 = emptyset ), it follows that ( mu(emptyset) = emptyset ). 4. **Case 2: ( A'_0 neq emptyset ):** If ( A'_0 neq emptyset ), we need to consider two sub-cases: - **Sub-case 2.1: ( mu(A'_0) = A'_0 ):** If ( mu(A'_0) = A'_0 ), then we have found a fixed point, and we are done. - **Sub-case 2.2: ( mu(A'_0) subsetneq A'_0 ):** If ( mu(A'_0) subsetneq A'_0 ), we can define another sequence ( A'_i = mu(A'_{i-1}) ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots ).

If ( A''_0 neq emptyset ), we repeat the process. 5. **Using Zorn's Lemma:** To make the argument rigorous, we use Zorn's Lemma. Define a partial order on ( mathcal{P}(X) ) by ( A prec B ) if and only if ( A supseteq mu(A) supseteq B ). This is indeed a partial order. For any chain ( mathcal{A} subseteq mathcal{P}(X) ) under ( prec ), the intersection ( bigcap_{A in mathcal{A}} A ) is an upper bound of ( mathcal{A} ). By Zorn's Lemma, there exists a maximal element ( A ) in ( (mathcal{P}(X), prec) ). For this maximal element ( A ), we must have ( mu(A) = A ).

If Betty eats 6 cookies a day, after a week, she would have eaten: 7 * 6 = 42 cookies And she would have eaten: 7 * 1 = 7 brownies The difference between the number of cookies and brownies would then be: 42 - 7 = 35 This is 1 less than the 36 more cookies than brownies that she is supposed to have. Therefore, Betty must eat 7 cookies a day because: 7 * 7 = 49 cookies 7 * 1 = 7 brownies The difference is: 49 - 7 = 42 Which is boxed{36} more cookies than brownies. So, Betty eats 7 cookies per day."},{"instruction":"A box contains 3 white balls, 3 black balls, and 3 red balls. I draw them out of the box, one at a time. What is the probability that no two balls of the same color are drawn consecutively?","output":"Let W, B, and R denote drawing a white, black, and red ball, respectively. The successful arrangements would require the colors to alternate and not repeat. We start by calculating the total number of arrangements for 3 white, 3 black, and 3 red balls, which is given by the multinomial coefficient: [ binom{9}{3,3,3} = frac{9!}{3!3!3!} = 1680 ] Next, to find the number of successful sequences where no two balls of the same color are drawn consecutively, we can use a recursive approach or generate functions, which could become quite complex. However, for simplification, let's consider the simpler cases such as starting with one color and then alternating among the others. Each color has two choices for the next step (since it cannot be the same as the previous one), leading to: [ 3 times 2^8 ] However, this method overcounts due to restrictions after a few steps as choices reduce when a color runs out of balls. The exact counting without overcomplex computation or simulation might not be feasible here, so we'll need to approximate or use advanced combinatorial algorithms or simulation for precise answers. Assuming the approximation holds without overcounting corrections, the probability is then: [ frac{3 times 2^8}{1680} = frac{768}{1680} ] [ approx frac{48}{105} approx 0.4571 ] This is a rough approximation, so further refinement or exact counting methods would be necessary for a precise answer.

Hence, calculating the possible forms of mathbf{A}^2 requires analyzing the nilpotency of a 3 times 3 matrix. Such a matrix, being nilpotent, generally has a Jordan form consisting of blocks with only 0 on the diagonal, but potential complexities arise in the actual Jordan block construction. For simplicity and typical cases: 1. If mathbf{A}^2 is zero, it matches the minimal condition of nilpotency. 2. If not zero, its structure depends on the specific entries of mathbf{A} but remains such that mathbf{A}^2 squared must result in the zero matrix. Since mathbf{A} can be any matrix that results in mathbf{A}^4 = mathbf{0}, including those that are not diagonalizable, and mathbf{A}^2 follows that it's nilpotent, the number of distinct mathbf{A}^2 matrices depends on the choice of mathbf{A}'s entries aligning with nilpotency.

By the well-known formula for the area of (triangle ABC), we have: [ text{Area} = frac{abc}{4R} = frac{1}{2}bc sin{alpha} ] Given that (bc = 8Rr), we can substitute this into the area formula: [ frac{8Rr sin{alpha}}{2} = 4Rr sin{alpha} ] Since the area can also be expressed as (pr) where (p) is the semiperimeter, we have: [ 4Rr sin{alpha} = pr ] Dividing both sides by (r), we get: [ 4R sin{alpha} = p ] 3. The semiperimeter (p) is given by: [ p = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] Therefore: [ 4R sin{alpha} = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] Since (a = BC), we can rewrite this as: [ 8R sin{alpha} = a + b + c ] 4.

We need to determine the maximum number of distinct integers that can be in a (16 times 16) table where each row and each column contains at most 4 distinct integers. 2. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are 50 or more distinct integers in the table. 3. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one row must contain exactly 4 distinct integers because this is the maximum number allowed per row. Let's say this row is the first row. 4. This means there are 4 distinct integers in the first row. There remain (50 - 4 = 46) distinct integers that must fit into the remaining 15 rows. 5. By the Pigeonhole Principle again, in these 15 rows, there will be at least one row with 4 distinct integers. 6. Label the set of integers in the first two rows as (S). Each of these rows has 4 distinct integers, and since they are distinct from each other, the set (S) contains (4 + 4 = 8) distinct integers. 7. Now consider the subcolumns containing the cells from rows 3 to 16 in each column. Since each column can have at most 4 distinct integers and the first two rows already use up 2 distinct integers, each subcolumn (from rows 3 to 16) must contain at most 2 additional distinct integers. 8. Therefore, in each subcolumn, the total number of distinct integers (including 2 from the set (S) and up to 2 more) is: [ 2 + 2 = 4 ] 9. Since there are 16 columns, and each column can contribute 2 new integers from rows 3 to 16, the maximum number of additional distinct integers is: [ 16 times 2 = 32 ] 10. Adding the 8 distinct values from the first two rows, the maximum number of distinct integers possible in the entire table is: [ 32 + 8 = 40 ] 11. This leads to a contradiction because we assumed there were at least 50 distinct integers. Therefore, the true maximum number of distinct integers must be fewer than 50. 12.

Since ( 2 times 0 + 3 = 3 ), the base case holds. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Suppose the statement is true for ( n - 1 ), i.e., ( 7^{7^{n-1}} + 1 ) is the product of at least ( 2(n-1) + 3 ) prime numbers. 3. **Induction Step**: We need to show that ( 7^{7^n} + 1 ) is the product of at least ( 2n + 3 ) prime numbers. Let ( x = 7^{7^{n-1}} ), then ( 7^{7^n} = x^7 ). Thus, [ 7^{7^n} + 1 = (x^7 + 1) ] Using algebraic identities, we observe: [ x^7 + 1 = (x + 1) cdot frac{x^7 + 1}{x + 1} ] 4. **Factoring the Polynomial**: We hypothesize: [ frac{x^7 + 1}{x + 1} = (x + 1)^6 - 7x left( x^2 + x + 1 right)^2 ] Verifying, we expand the right-hand side: [ (x + 1)^6 = x^6 + 6x^5 + 15x^4 + 20x^3 + 15x^2 + 6x + 1 ] And, [ -7x (x^2 + x + 1)^2 = -7x (x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1) = -7x^5 - 14x^4 - 21x^3 - 14x^2 - 7x ] Therefore, [ (x + 1)^6 - 7x (x^2 + x + 1)^2 = x^6 + 6x^5 + 15x^4 + 20x^3 + 15x^2 + 6x + 1 - 7x^5 - 14x^4 - 21x^3 - 14x^2 - 7x = x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1 ] Hence, [ x^7 + 1 = (x + 1) left( (x^6 - 7x^5 + 15x^4 - 21x^3 + 15x^2 - 7x + 1 right) ] 5. **Analyzing the Factors**: Based on our Induction Hypothesis, ( x = 7^{7^{n-1}} ) is the product of at least ( 2(n-1) + 3 ) primes (induction hypothesis). [ (x + 1) = 7^{7^{n-1}} + 1 ] This factor contributes at least one new prime. Each term of ( (x + 1)^3 - 7^m (x^2 + x + 1) ) contributes at least ( 1 ) new factor. 6. **Conclusion**: By induction, ( 7^{7^n} + 1) is the product of at least ( 2n + 3 ) primes.

First, let's find the axis of symmetry for the parabola represented by this quadratic function. The formula for the axis of symmetry is x = -frac{b}{2a}, where b is the coefficient of x. In our case, b = -2a, so we have: [x = -frac{-2a}{2a} = 1] This means the axis of symmetry is the vertical line x=1.

To determine the direction in which the parabola opens, we consider the positions of these points relative to the axis of symmetry. The distance from (-1,1) to the axis of symmetry (x=1) is 1 - (-1) = 2 units. The distance from (-5,5) to the axis of symmetry is 1 - (-5) = 6 units. Since the point (-5,5) is further from the axis of symmetry than (-1,1) and is located on the left side of the axis, and given that the parabola passes through both points, it implies that the parabola opens upwards. This is because for the parabola to include both points and have its axis of symmetry at x=1, it must extend upwards from the vertex, which is located to the left of both points. An upward-opening parabola indicates that the coefficient a in the quadratic function y=ax^{2}-2ax+c is positive.

Additionally, we must find other points in the plane where tangents to these two circles are equal in length. 1. Let ABC be a triangle with circles k_a and k_b drawn over the medians AA_1 and BB_1 as diameters, respectively. The centers of these circles are O_a and O_b. Note that O_a and O_b are different since they bisect the medians and their common point trisects them. 2. From vertex C, we can draw tangents to circles k_a and k_b if angle ACB is acute. If angle ACB = 90^circ, then point C lies on both circles. If angle ACB > 90^circ, point C lies inside both circles. - **Property of Tangents**: The square of the length of a tangent drawn from an external point to a circle equals the product of the line segments formed by any secant passing through that point and intersecting the circle. # Calculations and Proof 3. Assume angle ACB is acute. Let the perpendiculars from A and B to lines CB and CA meet the lines at points A_0 and B_0 respectively. If A_0 neq A_1, then A_0 sees segment AA_1 at a right angle, placing A_0 on circle k_a. Consequently, line BC intersects k_a at points A_0 and A_1. If A_0 = A_1, then AA_1 perp BC, and BC is tangent to k_a. - In both scenarios, the square of the tangent length from C to k_a is equal to CA_1 cdot CA_0. - Similarly, CB_1 cdot CB_0 is the square of the tangent length from C to k_b. 4. Triangles AA_0C and BB_0C are right-angled and similar due to sharing angle angle C. Hence, [ frac{CA}{CA_0} = frac{CB}{CB_0} ] This implies that: [ CA_0 cdot CB = CA cdot CB_0 ] Dividing by 2, we get: [ CA_0 cdot CA_1 = CB_1 cdot CB_0 ] This confirms that the tangents from C to k_a and k_b are equal. # Identifying Slope of Points with Equal Tangents 5. For circles k_a and k_b with radii r_a and r_b, let P lie outside both circles and project perpendicularly onto the line connecting O_a and O_b. Denote the projection as P'. The square of the tangent length from P to k_a is: [ e_a^2 = PP'^2 + P'O_a^2 - r_a^2 ] Similarly for k_b: [ e_b^2 = PP'^2 + P'O_b^2 - r_b^2 ] - Moving P along the line PP', only PP' changes. Thus, if e_a = e_b, then the same scales as P moves along PP'. Conclusively, all points on the orthogonal line to O_aO_b passing through C are such that tangents drawn to k_a and k_b are equal. # Conclusion: We have shown that points satisfying equal tangents to k_a and k_b lie on the altitude from C in triangle ABC. Therefore, the equal tangent point lies on the altitude from vertex C. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Solve the system of equations: left{begin{array}{l}{x^{2}5xy+6y^{2}=0}{x^{2}+y^{2}+x11y2=0}end{array}right.","output":"To solve the system of equations: [ left{begin{array}{l} x^{2}-5xy+6y^{2}=0 quad (1) x^{2}+y^{2}+x-11y-2=0 quad (2) end{array}right. ] From equation (1), we can factor it as follows: [ x^{2}-5xy+6y^{2} = (x-2y)(x-3y) = 0 ] This gives us two possible cases: - x-2y=0 - x-3y=0 **Case 1:** x-2y=0 Substituting x=2y into equation (2), we get: [ (2y)^{2}+y^{2}+2y-11y-2=0 implies 4y^{2}+y^{2}+2y-11y-2=0 implies 5y^{2}-9y-2=0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find: [ y = frac{9 pm sqrt{(-9)^{2}-4cdot5cdot(-2)}}{2cdot5} = frac{9 pm sqrt{81+40}}{10} = frac{9 pm sqrt{121}}{10} = frac{9 pm 11}{10} ] Thus, we have two solutions for y: - y_1 = -frac{1}{5}, which gives x_1 = -frac{2}{5} - y_2 = 2, which gives x_2 = 4 **Case 2:** x-3y=0 Substituting x=3y into equation (2), we get: [ (3y)^{2}+y^{2}+3y-11y-2=0 implies 9y^{2}+y^{2}+3y-11y-2=0 implies 10y^{2}-8y-2=0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find: [ y = frac{8 pm sqrt{(-8)^{2}-4cdot10cdot(-2)}}{2cdot10} = frac{8 pm sqrt{64+80}}{20} = frac{8 pm sqrt{144}}{20} = frac{8 pm 12}{20} ] Thus, we have two solutions for y: - y_3 = -frac{1}{5}, which gives x_3 = -frac{3}{5} - y_4 = 1, which gives x_4 = 3 Therefore, the solutions to the original system of equations are: [ boxed{left{begin{array}{l}x_{1}=-frac{2}{5}y_{1}=-frac{1}{5}end{array}right., left{begin{array}{l}x_{2}=4y_{2}=2end{array}right., left{begin{array}{l}x_{3}=-frac{3}{5}y_{3}=-frac{1}{5}end{array}right., left{begin{array}{l}x_{4}=3y_{4}=1end{array}right.} ]"},{"instruction":"Calculate:<br/>(1)sqrt{80}sqrt{20}+sqrt{5};<br/>(2)(4sqrt{2}3sqrt{6})÷2sqrt{2}.","output":"For the given problems, let's break down the solutions step by step: # Problem 1: Calculate sqrt{80}-sqrt{20}+sqrt{5} 1.

Similarly, the planes of the faces ( a_2 S a_3 ) and ( a_4 S a_1 ) intersect along a line ( n ), sharing the point ( S ) as well. 3. Choose an arbitrary point ( A ) on the edge ( S a_1 ) and from this point draw a line in the plane of the face ( a_1 S a_2 ) parallel to ( m ). Name this line ( l_1 ). 4. From the same point ( A ), draw a line in the plane of the face ( a_1 S a_4 ) parallel to ( n ). Name this line ( l_2 ). 5. The lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) define a plane. This plane’s intersection with the given tetrahedral angle results in a parallelogram. This is because the opposite sides of the resulting intersection (the parallelogram) are parallel to the lines of intersection of the planes of the original faces (i.e., ( m ) and ( n )). Another Solution: 1. Consider the edges ( S a_1 ) and ( S a_3 ), as well as ( S a_2 ) and ( S a_4 ). Draw diagonal sections through these pairs of edges. Let these diagonals intersect at some line ( l ). 2. Select an arbitrary point ( M ) on the line ( l ). Through this point ( M ), draw a segment inside the angle ( a_1 S a_3 ) such that it bisects ( M ). This segment can be termed ( M_1 ). 3. Perform a similar construction inside the angle ( a_2 S a_4 ), drawing a segment through ( M ) which will be parallel and of equal length, let’s name this segment ( M_2 ). 4. These two segments (( M_1 ) and ( M_2 )) will be the diagonals of a parallelogram when projected inside the original tetrahedral angle. Hence, a plane passing through these defines a parallelogram-shaped section. 5. By continuing to draw planes parallel to the one intersecting at ( M ), we can form as many intersection sections (spread across the tetrahedral angle) that yield parallelograms. # Conclusion: Considerations ensure that the tetrahedral angle mentioned is indeed convex when using such segments and constructing the intersection sections yielding parallelograms. Hence, the scenarios align with the properties of a convex tetrahedron.

If she wants to make all the papers identical, with the same combination of heart, star, smiley, and sun stickers, and no stickers left over, what is the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate?","output":"To find the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate with no stickers left over, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) that will divide evenly into the number of each type of sticker, given the constraints. First, let's deal with the constraint that the number of heart stickers must be twice as many as the smiley stickers. Since we have 240 heart stickers and 90 smiley stickers, the ratio of heart to smiley stickers is already 240:90, which simplifies to 8:3. However, we need a 2:1 ratio. To achieve this, we need to find a number that both 240 and 90 can be divided by that will result in a 2:1 ratio. The largest number that divides 90 is 90 itself, and twice 90 is 180, which is less than 240. So, we can use 90 smiley stickers and 180 heart stickers, leaving us with 60 heart stickers that we cannot use if we want to maintain the 2:1 ratio. Next, let's deal with the star to sun sticker ratio of 3:1. We have 162 star stickers and 54 sun stickers, which is already a 3:1 ratio (162:54 simplifies to 3:1).

Mark a dot at points ((i, a_i)) for each (1 leq i leq 16). If (a_{16} < 16), draw a vertical line from ((16, a_{16})) to ((16, 16)). This gives us an up-and-right lattice path from ((0,0)) to ((16,16)). The height of column (i) under this path is (a_i), so the sum of (a_i) is the area under the path. 3. **Analyzing the Parity of the Sum:** Consider the first (odd, odd) point in the path. To reach this point, the path must have either: - (1) a vertical segment followed by a horizontal segment, or - (2) a horizontal segment followed by a vertical segment. Flipping between (1) and (2) changes the area under the path by exactly 1. Therefore, one configuration has an even area, and the other has an odd area. This bijection shows that exactly half of the paths with at least one (odd, odd) point have an even area. 4. **Paths with No (Odd, Odd) Points:** If there is no (odd, odd) point, every column must have an even height. If (i) is odd, then (a_i) must be even. If (i) is even, even columns cannot have odd height, as this would create an (odd, odd) point in the next column. Thus, every path with no (odd, odd) point has an even area. 5. **Counting the Paths:** Let (A) be the number of paths with no (odd, odd) point. The total number of paths from ((0,0)) to ((16,16)) is (binom{32}{16}). The number of paths with no (odd, odd) point is (binom{16}{8}). 6. **Final Calculation:** The number of paths with an even area is: [ frac{1}{2} left( binom{32}{16} - A right) + A = frac{1}{2} left( binom{32}{16} - binom{16}{8} right) + binom{16}{8} ] Simplifying this, we get: [ frac{1}{2} left( binom{32}{16} + binom{16}{8} right) ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{2} left( binom{32}{16} + binom{16}{8} right)})"},{"instruction":"Repair a road, on the first day, frac {1}{3} of the entire road was repaired, and on the second day, frac {2}{5} of the remaining part was repaired.

By how much percent did each side of the field diminish?","output":"Let's assume the original length of the field is L and the original width is W. The original area of the field is A = L * W. The area of the field diminished by 64%, so the new area A' is 36% of the original area (since 100% - 64% = 36%). Therefore, A' = 0.36 * A. Let's assume each side of the field diminishes by x%. This means the new length L' is (100% - x%) of the original length L, and the new width W' is (100% - x%) of the original width W. So, L' = (1 - x/100) * L and W' = (1 - x/100) * W. The new area A' can also be expressed as the product of the new length and width: A' = L' * W'. Substituting the expressions for L' and W' into the equation for A', we get: A' = (1 - x/100) * L * (1 - x/100) * W Since A' is also equal to 0.36 * A, we can set the two expressions for A' equal to each other: 0.36 * A = (1 - x/100)^2 * A We can cancel A from both sides since A is not equal to zero: 0.36 = (1 - x/100)^2 Now we need to solve for x. First, take the square root of both sides: √0.36 = 1 - x/100 0.6 = 1 - x/100 Now, solve for x: x/100 = 1 - 0.6 x/100 = 0.4 x = 0.4 * 100 x = 40 So, each side of the field diminished by boxed{40%} ."},{"instruction":"The equivalent ordinary equation of the parametric equation [ begin{cases} x= sqrt {t} y=2 sqrt {1t} end{cases} ] (where t is the parameter) is A: x^{2}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1 B: x^{2}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1(0leqslant xleqslant 1) C: x^{2}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1(0leqslant yleqslant 2) D: x^{2}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1(0leqslant xleqslant 1,0leqslant yleqslant 2)","output":"From the parametric equation [ begin{cases} x= sqrt {t} y=2 sqrt {1-t} end{cases} ] (where t is the parameter), we have [ begin{cases} tgeqslant 0 1-tgeqslant 0 end{cases} ] Solving this, we get 0leqslant tleqslant 1, which leads to 0leqslant xleqslant 1 and 0leqslant yleqslant 2.

However, ac = 1cdot1 = 1 and bd = (-1)cdot(-1) = 1 which implies ac = bd.

So, the new dimensions including the path are: Length = 95 m + 5 m = 100 m Width = 55 m + 5 m = 60 m Now, we can calculate the area of the entire field including the path: Area = Length * Width Area = 100 m * 60 m Area = 6000 sq m Next, we need to find the area of the grass field without the path: Area of grass field = Original length * Original width Area of grass field = 95 m * 55 m Area of grass field = 5225 sq m Now, to find the area of the path alone, we subtract the area of the grass field from the area of the entire field including the path: Area of path = Area of entire field including path - Area of grass field Area of path = 6000 sq m - 5225 sq m Area of path = 775 sq m Now that we have the area of the path, we can calculate the cost of constructing it at Rs. 2 per sq m: Cost = Area of path * Cost per sq m Cost = 775 sq m * Rs. 2/sq m Cost = Rs. 1550 Therefore, the area of the path is boxed{775} sq m and the cost of constructing it is Rs. 1550."},{"instruction":"f real numbers a and b satisfy |a+2|+sqrt{b4}=0, then frac{{a}^{2}}{b}=______.","output":"Given that real numbers a and b satisfy |a+2|+sqrt{b-4}=0, we can analyze this equation step by step.

Thus, the pattern for cube roots can be described as: [ boxed{text{When finding the cube root, if the decimal point of the radicand moves three places to the left (or right), the decimal point of its cube root moves one place to the left (or right).}} ] Part (3) - For the value of a, using the pattern of square roots: [ because sqrt{2} approx 1.4142 ] We can deduce that: [ sqrt{200} approx 14.142 ] Therefore, a = 200. - For the value of b, according to the pattern of cube roots: [ because sqrt[3]{0.7} approx 0.8879 ] We can infer that: [ sqrt[3]{700} approx 8.879 ] Thus, b = 8.879.

In this particular case, we are investigating the possibility of both a convex and a non-convex 17-gon being divided into 14 triangles and identifying the minimum number of triangles a 17-gon can be divided into. First, let's recall a few fundamental properties about the division of polygons into triangles: 1. The sum of interior angles in a polygon with n sides is (n-2) times 180^circ. 2. When dividing a polygon into triangles, each triangle contributes 180^circ to the total sum of angles. For a convex polygon, the sum of its interior angles must fulfill the requirement for every division into triangles. Now let's examine the convex 17-gon first: 1. Calculate the sum of interior angles of the convex 17-gon: [ sum(text{angles of 17-gon}) = (17-2) times 180^circ = 15 times 180^circ = 2700^circ ] 2. Next, consider the sum of the angles for the 14 triangles that one might form: [ sum(text{angles of 14 triangles}) = 14 times 180^circ = 2520^circ ] 3. However, for the polygon to be divided into smaller shapes, the sum of the angles in the resulting triangles must at least match the total interior angles of the 17-gon. Since: [ 2700^circ > 2520^circ ] It's clear that it is impossible to divide a convex 17-gon into only 14 triangles, because the angles would not suffice to match the required sum of the interior angles. Next, let's explore if a non-convex (concave) 17-gon could be divided into a different number of triangles and find the minimum number of triangles required for such division. 1. Each vertex of a polygon either coincides with a triangle vertex or lies on the side of the triangle division. Any vertex part of a side would imply an interior angle greater than 180^circ (due to the concave nature). 2. For a 17-gon, suppose we want to determine the minimum number of triangles required. The number of vertices provided by the triangles must at least equate to the sides of the polygon. Thus: [ 3T geq 17 ] Solving for T: [ T geq frac{17}{3} approx 5.67 ] Given that T must be an integer, the minimum integer value satisfying this inequality is: [ T = 6 ] Therefore, a 17-gon, regardless if it is convex or non-convex, cannot be divided into fewer than 6 triangles without conflicting the necessary geometric constraints.

A classic solution to this problem is known as the \\"eight queens puzzle.\\" 4. **Constructive Example:** - One of the classic solutions for placing 8 non-attacking queens on an 8 times 8 board is as follows. The queens can be placed at these coordinates: - (1, 1) - (2, 3) - (3, 5) - (4, 7) - (5, 2) - (6, 4) - (7, 6) - (8, 8) - In matrix notation, where each cell (i, j) indicates a queen at the i-th row and j-th column, the board looks like: [ begin{bmatrix} Q & . & . & . & . & . & . & . . & . & Q & . & . & . & . & . . & . & . & . & Q & . & . & . . & . & . & . & . & . & Q & . . & Q & . & . & . & . & . & . . & . & . & Q & . & . & . & . . & . & . & . & . & Q & . & . . & . & . & . & . & . & . & Q end{bmatrix} ] 5. **Verification:** - Each queen is placed such that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. - Therefore, this configuration correctly places 8 queens on the board without any queen attacking another. # Conclusion: [ boxed{8} ]"},{"instruction":"A cylinder has a base radius of 1cm and a height of 2cm.

To do this, we will analyze two functions g(x) and f(x) to determine the relationships between a, b, and c. **Step 1: Analyzing g(x)=x-1-ln x for x>0** First, we find the derivative of g(x): [g'(x)=1-frac{1}{x}=frac{x-1}{x}.] Next, we analyze the sign of g'(x): - For g'(x) > 0, we have x > 1. - For g'(x) < 0, we have 0 < x < 1. This tells us that g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,1) and monotonically increasing on (1,+infty). Therefore, the minimum value of g(x) occurs at x=1, giving us g(1)=0. This implies that for all x>0, we have x-1geqslant ln x. From this, we can conclude that a > b since a=frac{1}{2} and b=lnfrac{3}{2}, and frac{1}{2}-1geqslant lnfrac{3}{2}. **Step 2: Analyzing f(x)=frac{pi}{2}sin x-x** Now, let's find the derivative of f(x): [f'(x)=frac{pi}{2}cos x-1.] We note that f'(x) is decreasing on the interval (0,frac{pi}{6}). To check the behavior of f(x), we evaluate f'(frac{pi}{6}): [f'left(frac{pi}{6}right)=frac{pi}{2}cdotfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}-1=frac{sqrt{3}pi-4}{4} > 0.] This indicates that f(x) is increasing on the interval (0,frac{pi}{6}). Therefore, since frac{1}{2} < frac{pi}{6}, we have f(frac{1}{2}) > f(0)=0, which means frac{pi}{2}sinfrac{1}{2} > frac{1}{2}, i.e., c > a. **Conclusion:** Given that a > b and c > a, the correct relationship between a, b, and c is b < a < c.

Specifically, for any integer ( i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, k ), we have: [ sum_{m=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-m} F(i+m) binom{n}{m} = n!. ] **Step 3:** Consider a sequence of coefficients ( x_0, x_1, ldots, x_k ). Note that [ sum_{i=0}^{k} left( x_i sum_{m=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-m} F(i+m) binom{n}{m} right). ] This can be rearranged as: [ sum_{i=0}^{k} x_i sum_{m=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-m} F(i+m) binom{n}{m} = sum_{i=0}^{n+1} left( F(t) sum_{i=0}^{k} x_i (-1)^{n+i-t} binom{n}{t-i} right). ] **Step 4:** Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we get: [ left( sum_{i=0}^{n+k} |F(t)|^2 right) left( sum_{i=0}^{n+k} left( sum_{i=0}^{k} x_i (-1)^{n+i-t} binom{n}{t-i} right)^2 right) geq left( sum_{t=0}^{n+k} left( F(t) sum_{i=0}^{k} x_i (-1)^{n+i-t} binom{n}{t-i} right) right)^2. ] By evaluating this for ( F(t) ), the right-hand side becomes: [ left( sum_{i=0}^{k} left( x_i sum_{m=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-m} F(i+m) binom{n}{m} right) right)^2 = (n!)^2 left( x_0 + x_1 + cdots + x_k right)^2. ] Therefore, using the above result, we see that: [ sum_{i=0}^{n+k} left(F(t)right)^2 sum_{i=0}^{n+k} left( sum_{i=0}^{k} x_i (-1)^{n+i-1} binom{n}{t-i} right)^2 geq (n!)^2 left( x_0 + x_1 + cdots + x_k right)^2. ] **Step 5:** To achieve equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, observe that the equality condition is met when: [ F(t) : sum_{i=0}^{k} x_i (-1)^{n+i-t} binom{n}{t-i} ] is a constant. Also considering the other constraints, we can choose: [ x_{i} = binom{n+i}{i} binom{n+k-i}{k-i}. ] This means: [ sum_{i=0}^{k} x_i (-1)^{i-j} binom{n+i}{i} binom{n+k-i}{k-i} binom{2n}{n+j-i} = binom{2n}{n}. ] By exploring the function properties and symmetry, we verify that this choice satisfies all conditions. **Conclusion:** Thus, the minimum value of ( sum_{i=0}^{n+k} |F(i)|^2 ) is: [ text{Minimum} = frac{(n!)^2 binom{2n+1+k}{k}}{binom{2n}{n}}. ] Our final answer is: [ boxed{frac{(n!)^2 binom{2n+1+k}{k}}{binom{2n}{n}}} ]"},{"instruction":"Determine b a if the length of the interval of solutions of the inequality a le 3x + 6 le b is 15.

Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify this to: [ log_aleft(x^2 - x - 2right) > log_aleft(x - frac{2}{a}right) + log_a(a) ] 3. Combining the logs on the right-hand side: [ log_aleft(x^2 - x - 2right) > log_aleft(a(x - frac{2}{a})right) ] 4. Since (log_a(y)) is strictly increasing when (a > 1), the inequality (log_a(U) > log_a(V)) implies (U > V), so: [ x^2 - x - 2 > a(x - frac{2}{a}) ] 5. Simplifying the equation ( x^2 - x - 2 > a(x - frac{2}{a}) ) yields: [ x^2 - x - 2 > ax - 2 ] Bringing all terms to one side, we get: [ x^2 - x - 2 - ax + 2 > 0 implies x^2 - (1+a)x > 0 ] 6. This quadratic inequality can be factored: [ x(x - (1+a)) > 0 ] Solving this we get: [ x < 0 quad text{or} quad x > 1 + a ] And we must also consider the constraints from the original logarithms: - ( x^2 - x - 2 > 0 ): Solve the quadratic inequality, yielding: [ (x - 2)(x + 1) > 0 quad implies quad x > 2 quad text{or} quad x < -1 ] - ( x - frac{2}{a} > 0 ): Thus, [ x > frac{2}{a} ] 7. Combining all, we find that for (a > 1): - ( x > 2 ) - ( x > 1 + a ) - ( x > frac{2}{a} ) because x>2 and x>1+a imply x>1+a since age1. So, the solution in this case is: [ x > 1 + a ] Case 2: ( 0 < a < 1 ) 1. Rewrite the inequality similarly: [ log_aleft(x^2 - x - 2right) > log_aleft(x - frac{2}{a}right) + 1 ] As above, simplifying gives: [ log_aleft(x^2 - x - 2right) > log_aleft(ax - 2right) ] 2. Since (log_a(y)) is strictly decreasing when (0 < a < 1), the inequality (log_a(U) > log_a(V)) implies that: [ x^2 - x - 2 < a(x - frac{2}{a}) ] [ x^2 - x - 2 < ax - 2 implies x^2 - (1-a)x < 0 ] 3. This solves to: [ x(x - (1-a)) < 0 ] This inequality tells us that: [ 0 < x < 1 + a ] Additionally, considering the constraints: - ( x - frac{2}{a} > 0 ) [ x > frac{2}{a} ] - ( x^2 - x - 2 > 0 ) gives: [ (x - 2)(x + 1) > 0 implies x > 2 quad text{or} quad x < -1 ] 4. Combining these constraints, we see: [ 0 < x < 1 + a ] [ x > frac{2}{a} ] [ x > 2 ] However, since frac{2}{a} will be much larger than 1 + a when 0 < a < 1, and 1 + a < 2, there is no (x) that satisfies all these inequalities. So for (0 < a < 1), there is no solution. # Conclusion: - When ( a > 1 ): [ x > 1 + a ] Solution set is ( (1 + a, +infty) ). - When ( 0 < a < 1 ): [ varnothing ] Thus, the overall solution is: [ boxed{(1 + a, +infty) , text{for} , a > 1 , text{and} , varnothing , text{for} , 0 < a < 1} ]"},{"instruction":"the first 10 overs of a cricket game, the run rate was only 3.6.

Start a walk from ( v_0 ), traversing edges without repetition until movement is not possible. Let's traverse ( t_1 ) edges from ( v_0 ), resulting in a sequence of vertices ( v_0, v_1, ldots, v_{t_1} ). Let these edges be labeled ( 1, 2, ldots, t_1 ). 3. **Edge Labeling Strategy**: - Clearly, ( 1 leq t_1 leq k ). - For each intermediate vertex ( v_i ) (( i = 1, 2, ldots, t_1-1 )), there are at least two edges, namely ( v_{i-1}v_i ) and ( v_iv_{i+1} ), labeled ( i ) and ( i+1 ) respectively. These numbers are consecutive integers, which means ( gcd(i, i+1) = 1 ). 4. **Case Where All Edges are Labeled**: - If ( t_1 = k ), then all edges have been labeled, and the labeling process terminates successfully. 5. **Continuing the Labeling Process**: - If ( 1 leq t_1 < k ), consider the remaining edges. - Due to the connectivity of ( G ), there exists a vertex with at least one unlabeled edge. Select such a vertex ( v' ) and treat it as a new initial vertex ( v_0 ), continuing the labeling process sequentially from ( t_1 + 1 ). 6. **General Verification**: - Continue the above strategy to sequentially label each segment of the edges until all ( k ) edges are labeled. - Consider any vertex ( v ) in ( G ). If ( v = v_0 ), ( v ) is connected to edge labeled 1. Hence, GCD is satisfied trivially. - For any other vertex ( v neq v_0 ), due to the labeling scheme, it is incident to edges labeled with consecutive integers, ensuring ( gcd ) of these labels is 1. # Conclusion: We have shown a structured method to label the edges of a connected graph ( G ) with ( k ) edges such that the GCD of the labels of the edges incident to any vertex with at least two edges is 1.

This can be made by 1.5 + 1 or two slips of 1.5. Thus, 4.5 can fit in box R effectively. - Other boxes either exceed or do not fit the required sum after adding 4.5 and considering already assigned slips. 5. **Conclusion**: The most appropriate location based on leftover numbers and ensuring the total sum integer constraint in each box is maintained, slip 4.5 should go to box R.

Let's start by considering two of these 2n + 3 points and draw a line l passing through them. We can choose any two points for this purpose, say P and Q. This leaves us with 2n + 1 remaining points which we denote as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n+1}. 3. Next, we consider the angles formed by the points A_i with respect to line l. Specifically, for each point A_i, we denote angle PA_iQ as theta_i for i = 1, 2, ldots, 2n + 1. 4. Because no four points are concyclic, all the angles theta_1, theta_2, ldots, theta_{2n+1} are distinct. Without loss of generality, we can assume these angles are sorted in increasing order: [ theta_1 < theta_2 < cdots < theta_{2n+1}. ] 5.

We analyze the relative positions of the remaining points with respect to this circle: - For the points A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n, their associated angles theta_1, theta_2, ldots, theta_n are all less than theta_{n+1}. Hence, all these points lie outside the circle. - For the points A_{n+2}, A_{n+3}, ldots, A_{2n+1}, their angles are theta_{n+2}, theta_{n+3}, ldots, theta_{2n+1} which are all greater than theta_{n+1}. Hence, all these points lie inside the circle. 7.

Case 1: ( n ) is even 4. For even ( n ), we use the fact that: [ 75 equiv -1 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad 53 equiv 1 pmod{4} ] 5. Therefore: [ 75^n equiv (-1)^n equiv 1 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad 53^n equiv 1^n equiv 1 pmod{4} ] 6. Summing these, [ 75^n + 53^n equiv 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] 7. Since ( frac{1}{2^n} left( 75^n + 53^n right) ) must be an integer, and ( 75^n + 53^n ) is of the form ( 4k + 2 ), this implies ( 2^{n+1} mid (4k + 2) ), which is not possible for even ( n ). Therefore, ( n ) cannot be even. Case 2: ( n ) is odd 8. For odd ( n ): [ 75^n + 53^n = (75 + 53) (75^{n-1} - 75^{n-2} cdot 53 + cdots + 53^{n-1}) ] 9. Note that: [ 75 + 53 = 128 = 2^7 ] 10.

Therefore, the minimum value of g(x) occurs at x_0, giving g(x)_{min} = g(x_{0}) = frac{(x_{0}-2)ln{x}_{0}}{x_{0}+2}.

Given that: 2 O F^{2} - 4 F I^{2} = 0, we simplify the equation: O A^{2} + O B^{2} = F A^{2} + F B^{2}. 8. Notice that the term ( 2 F I^{2} ) added on both sides of our initial equations effectively cancels out due to the isosceles property and the fact they come from an angle of ( 45^{circ} ). 9. Consequently, the sum of the squares of the segments into which point ( F ) divides the second cut remains consistent with our calculations. Therefore, ( F A^{2} + F B^{2} ) remains identical to ( 2 O A^{2} ). Conclusion: Hence, we conclude that the result is not a coincidence. It systematically follows the geometry of the circle, given the stated properties and placements of the cuts and the bean. boxed{text{No, it is not a coincidence.}}"},{"instruction":"a nonobtuse triangle ( triangle ABC ), where ( AB > AC ) and ( angle B = 45^circ ), ( O ) and ( I ) are the circumcenter and incenter of ( triangle ABC ) respectively.

Behind the wheel was the happiest of the immortals, Koshchei. Ivan was amazed: What is this? Ivan inquired. It's called a machine, replied Koshchei, beaming. It doesn't require horses, but it has the power of one hundred horses! It moves on its own, just add gasoline. Ivan got interested and thought it would be useful. How much did it cost? 1,300,000 rubles. Ivan was shocked. He had just paid off the terem and had no savings. Don't worry, there is a solution. Go to Baba Yaga; she understands this stuff now. Ivan hurried home, called Vasilisa, told her everything, and they went to Baba Yaga. A sign above the old hut said: Financial Consultant. Let's see. You say you need to save as quickly as possible?

When (d < R-r), the circles are nested; when (d=R-r), the circles are internally tangent; when (R-r < d < R+r), the circles intersect; when (d=R+r), the circles are externally tangent; when (d > R+r), the circles are disjoint. By identifying the centers (C_{1}) and (C_{2}) and the radii (r_{1}) and (r_{2}) from the equations of the two circles, and letting the radius of circle (M) be (r), based on the external tangency of circle (M) with (C_{1}), we get the distance between their centers (MC_{1}=r+1).

We need to add these fractions to find the total part of his allowance that he spent: [ frac{7}{15} + frac{3}{10} + frac{1}{6} ] To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15, 10, and 6 is 30. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 30: [ frac{7}{15} = frac{14}{30} ] [ frac{3}{10} = frac{9}{30} ] [ frac{1}{6} = frac{5}{30} ] Now we can add them: [ frac{14}{30} + frac{9}{30} + frac{5}{30} = frac{28}{30} ] This simplifies to: [ frac{28}{30} = frac{14}{15} ] So, John spent 14/15 of his allowance before going to the toy store. This means he had 1/15 of his allowance left. Next, he spent 2/5 of his remaining allowance at the toy store. To find out how much of his total allowance this represents, we multiply 1/15 by 2/5: [ frac{1}{15} times frac{2}{5} = frac{2}{75} ] Now, we subtract this amount from the remaining allowance (1/15) to find out how much he had left before spending the last 1.20 at the candy store: [ frac{1}{15} - frac{2}{75} ] To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 75: [ frac{5}{75} - frac{2}{75} = frac{3}{75} ] This simplifies to: [ frac{3}{75} = frac{1}{25} ] So, John had 1/25 of his allowance left before spending 1.20 at the candy store. Since this last amount is equal to 1.20, we can set up the equation: [ frac{1}{25}A = 1.20 ] To find A, we multiply both sides by 25: [ A = 1.20 times 25 ] [ A = 30 ] Therefore, John's weekly allowance is boxed{30} ."},{"instruction":"Solve the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation in a circle: begin{gathered} Delta u + 4u = 0, quad 0 leq r < 1, u|_{r=1} = sin^3(varphi). end{gathered}","output":"Given the boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation in a disk: [ begin{gathered} Delta u + 4u = 0, quad 0 leq r < 1, u(r = 1, varphi) = sin^{3} varphi . end{gathered} ] We start by expressing the Helmholtz equation in polar coordinates ((r, varphi)): 1. **Transformation to Polar Coordinates**: [ Delta u + 4u = 0 ] In polar coordinates, this transforms to: [ frac{1}{r} frac{partial}{partial r} left( r frac{partial u}{partial r} right) + frac{1}{r^2} frac{partial^2 u}{partial varphi^2} + 4u = 0 ] 2. **Separation of Variables**: Assume a solution of the form [ u(r, varphi) = R(r) Phi(varphi) ] Substituting ( u(r, varphi) = R(r) Phi(varphi) ) into the transformed equation: [ frac{1}{R} frac{d}{dr} left( r frac{dR}{dr} right) + 4r^2 = -frac{1}{Phi} frac{d^2 Phi}{dvarphi^2} = lambda ] where (lambda) is a separation constant. 3. **Solving for (Phi(varphi))**: [ frac{d^2 Phi}{d varphi^2} + lambda Phi = 0 ] The periodic boundary condition (Phi(varphi + 2pi) = Phi(varphi)) implies that (lambda = n^2) for (n = 0, 1, 2, ldots).

The sum of the digits is less than 22. 3. The middle digit y equals twice the first digit x. Step 1: Analyze divisibility by 3 If a number overline{xyz} is divisible by 3, then x + y + z must be divisible by 3. To avoid divisibility by 3, x + y + z should not be a multiple of 3. Step 2: Apply the specific digit relationship Given y = 2x, substitute this in all expressions. Step 3: Evaluate the sum condition The sum of the digits x + 2x + z = 3x + z. This must be less than 22. As z is a digit (ranging from 0 to 9), we analyze potential values of x: - **If x = 1:** 3x + z = 3 + z < 22, possible z values are from 0 to 9 (10 possibilities). - **If x = 2:** 3x+z = 6 + z < 22, similar range for z, 0 to '9 (10 possibilities). - ... Continue this for each x. - **If x = 4:** Beyond x = 4 (as y = 2x must also be a digit), the maximum valid x is 4, yielding y = 8. Step 4: Check each possibility Repeat the sum check and ensure no total is divisible by 3: - Example: For x = 1, z = 0, total sum = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3, not counted. Calculate valid counts accordingly. Summing up all cases up to x = 4, recognizing cases where divisibility by 3 does not apply: - The sum of x = 1 also gives 0 acceptable values due to condition 3x + z neq text{multiple of } 3. Thus, the correct total count must be 0, since y = 2x and x = 1, 2, 3, 4 all yield sums divisible by 3. So the new condition renders the problem unsolvable under the given constraints.

We do not need to adjust the mode since it was calculated correctly. For the average: 1. The first number was read as 33.5 instead of the correct 43.5. The difference is 43.5 - 33.5 = 10. 2. The second number was read as 47.75 instead of the correct 56.25. The difference is 56.25 - 47.75 = 8.5. 3. The third number was read as 58.5 instead of the correct 68.5.

A can finish the work in 5 days, so A's work rate is ( frac{1}{5} ) of the work per day. B can finish the work in 10 days, so B's work rate is ( frac{1}{10} ) of the work per day. When A and B work together, their combined work rate is: ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{10} = frac{2}{10} + frac{1}{10} = frac{3}{10} ) of the work per day. In two days, A and B together will complete: ( 2 times frac{3}{10} = frac{6}{10} ) or ( frac{3}{5} ) of the work. This means that ( frac{2}{5} ) of the work is still remaining after A leaves.

Therefore, there are ( n - 3d ) possible values for ( a ). 5. **Summing over all possible ( d ):** - The common difference ( d ) must be such that ( 1 + 3d leq n ). Solving for ( d ), we get: [ d leq frac{n-1}{3} ] - Let ( d_{text{max}} = left[ frac{n-1}{3} right] ) (where ( [cdot] ) denotes the floor function, i.e., the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument). 6. **Summing the valid progressions for each ( d ):** - The total number of arithmetic progressions is given by the sum: [ sum_{d=1}^{d_{text{max}}} (n - 3d) ] 7. **Simplifying the summation:** - The sum can be rewritten as an arithmetic series: [ sum_{d=1}^{d_{text{max}}} (n - 3d) = (n-3) + (n-6) + ldots + (n-3d_{text{max}}) ] - This is an arithmetic series with the first term ( a_1 = (n - 3) ), the last term ( a_l = (n - 3d_{text{max}}) ), and common difference ( -3 ). 8. **Number of terms ( k ) in the series:** - Since ( d ) ranges from 1 to ( d_{text{max}} ), there are ( d_{text{max}} ) terms. 9. **Sum of an arithmetic series:** - The sum of the first ( k ) terms of an arithmetic series is given by: [ S_k = frac{k}{2} left( a_1 + a_l right) ] - Substituting the values of ( a_1 ) and ( a_l ): [ S_k = frac{d_{text{max}}}{2} left( (n-3) + (n - 3d_{text{max}}) right) ] - Simplifying, we get: [ S_k = frac{d_{text{max}}}{2} left( 2n - 3 - 3d_{text{max}} right) = frac{(2n - 3d_{text{max}} - 3)d_{text{max}}}{2} ] 10. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the first ( n ) natural numbers forming an increasing arithmetic progression is: [ boxed{frac{(2n - 3d_{text{max}} - 3)d_{text{max}}}{2}} ] where ( d_{text{max}} = left[frac{n-1}{3}right] )."},{"instruction":"Let x, y, and z be numbers such that (x + 8)(y 8) = 0 and x + y + z = k, where k is a constant.

Case 2: y - 8 = 0, which implies y = 8. We also have the equation x + y + z = k. Let's consider each case separately: Case 1: If x = -8, then the equation x + y + z = k becomes -8 + y + z = k. We can rearrange this to find y + z = k + 8. Now, we want to minimize x^2 + y^2 + z^2. Since x is already determined to be -8, we have x^2 = 64. We need to minimize y^2 + z^2 under the constraint y + z = k + 8. The minimum value of y^2 + z^2, given that y + z is constant, occurs when y = z. This is because the sum of squares is minimized when the values are as close to each other as possible (by the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means). So, let y = z = (k + 8)/2. Then y^2 + z^2 = 2 * ((k + 8)/2)^2 = 2 * (k^2/4 + 4k + 16) = k^2/2 + 4k + 32. Adding x^2 to this, we get the total minimum value for x^2 + y^2 + z^2 as 64 + k^2/2 + 4k + 32. Case 2: If y = 8, then the equation x + y + z = k becomes x + 8 + z = k. We can rearrange this to find x + z = k - 8. Again, we want to minimize x^2 + y^2 + z^2. Since y is already determined to be 8, we have y^2 = 64. We need to minimize x^2 + z^2 under the constraint x + z = k - 8. Using the same reasoning as in Case 1, we let x = z = (k - 8)/2. Then x^2 + z^2 = 2 * ((k - 8)/2)^2 = 2 * (k^2/4 - 4k + 16) = k^2/2 - 4k + 32. Adding y^2 to this, we get the total minimum value for x^2 + y^2 + z^2 as 64 + k^2/2 - 4k + 32. Now, we compare the two cases: Case 1: 64 + k^2/2 + 4k + 32 Case 2: 64 + k^2/2 - 4k + 32 The difference between the two cases is the sign of the 4k term. Since we want the smallest possible value, we choose the case with the negative 4k term, which is Case 2. Therefore, the smallest possible value of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is boxed{64} + k^2/2 - 4k + 32."},{"instruction":"f the graph of the quadratic function y=x^{2}+x+1 passes through the points A(3,y_{1}), B(2,y_{2}), C(frac{1}{2},y_{3}), the relationship between y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3} is ____ (connect with lt ).","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given quadratic function and how it behaves graphically.

Moreover, it reveals that the vertex of the parabola is at left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{4}right), which means the axis of symmetry of the parabola is the vertical line x = -frac{1}{2}. Given the points A(-3, y_1), B(2, y_2), and Cleft(frac{1}{2}, y_3right), we can analyze their positions relative to the axis of symmetry to understand their vertical positions on the graph. 1. The point A(-3, y_1) is to the left of the axis of symmetry, and the point B(2, y_2) is to the right. Given the symmetry of the parabola, the vertical positions (or y-values) of points symmetric about the axis of symmetry are equal. Therefore, y_1 = y_2. 2. The point Cleft(frac{1}{2}, y_3right) is on the right side of the axis of symmetry but closer to it than point B. Since the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is the lowest point on the graph, any point on the graph that is horizontally closer to the vertex (but not the vertex itself) will have a lower y-value than points further away. Therefore, y_3 < y_1.

Start with the original inequality that we need to prove: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 geq 4 sqrt{3} Delta + (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 ] 2.

Utilize trigonometric identities: [ cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} ] Rewrite (cos A) using the expression (1 + frac{(b - c)^2 - a^2}{2bc}): [ cos A = 1 + frac{(b - c)^2 - a^2}{2bc} ] 5.

Further converting using half-angle formulas: [ tan frac{A}{2} + tan frac{B}{2} + tan frac{C}{2} geq sqrt{3} ] 7.

Alternatively, using the notation: [ S = frac{1}{2} (a + b + c), quad S-a = x, quad S-b = y, quad S-c = z ] 12. Then: [ 4 sqrt{3} Delta = 4 sqrt{3S(S-a)(S-b)(S-c)} = 4 sqrt{3(x+y+z)xyz} ] 13. Rearranging, we get: [ [a^2 - (b-c)^2] + [b^2 - (c-a)^2] + [c^2 - (a-b)^2] = 4(S-b)(S-c) + 4(S-c)(S-a) + 4(S-a)(S-b) ] [ = 4yz + 4zx + 4xy ] 14.

Let's calculate the number of tiles that can be accommodated in each orientation: Option 1: 45 cm side parallel to the 250 cm side - Along the 250 cm side, we can fit ( frac{250}{45} ) tiles. - Along the 180 cm side, we can fit ( frac{180}{50} ) tiles.

Now let's calculate the number of tiles for each option: Option 1: - Along the 250 cm side: ( frac{250}{45} approx 5.55 ), so we can fit 5 tiles (since we cannot have a fraction of a tile). - Along the 180 cm side: ( frac{180}{50} = 3.6 ), so we can fit 3 tiles. Total number of tiles for Option 1: ( 5 times 3 = 15 ) tiles. Option 2: - Along the 250 cm side: ( frac{250}{50} = 5 ), so we can fit 5 tiles. - Along the 180 cm side: ( frac{180}{45} = 4 ), so we can fit 4 tiles. Total number of tiles for Option 2: ( 5 times 4 = 20 ) tiles. Comparing the two options, we can see that Option 2 allows us to fit more tiles on the floor.

This is one of the defining properties of a parallelogram. Therefore, condition ① ensures that quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram. - **Condition ②**: Knowing that AB = CD but without information on the angles or other sides being parallel, we cannot guarantee that ABCD is a parallelogram solely based on the sides being equal. Quadrilaterals with equal opposite sides but without parallel opposite sides are not necessarily parallelograms. Thus, condition ② does not ensure that ABCD is a parallelogram. - **Condition ③**: Given angle A = angle C and AD parallel to BC, we can infer that angle A + angle B = 180^{circ} (since AD parallel BC, angles A and B are supplementary). If angle A = angle C, then it must also be true that angle C + angle B = 180^{circ}. This implies that AB is parallel to CD, fulfilling another condition for ABCD to be a parallelogram. Therefore, condition ③ ensures that ABCD is a parallelogram. - **Condition ④**: With angle B = angle C and AD parallel to BC, we lack sufficient conditions to conclude that ABCD is a parallelogram. This condition alone does not imply that the opposite sides are parallel or equal, which are necessary conditions for a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.

This triangle has three acute angles, i.e., all its angles are less than 90^circ. 2. **Initial Assumption on Cutting the Polygon:** - When we perform a straight-line cut on a polygon, it results in two new polygons. - Importantly, we need to prove that if the original polygon has at least three non-obtuse angles (angles less than or equal to 90^circ), then at least one of the resulting polygons from any straight-line cut retains this property. 3. **Behavior of Angles Upon Cutting:** - For clarity, recall that when a straight-line cut is made, it introduces new vertices and consequently new angles at the ends of the cut. - If the cut intersects an existing angle that is non-obtuse, at least one of the resulting angles at the new vertices will also be non-obtuse. 4. **Induction on Maintaining at Least Three Non-Obtuse Angles:** - Start with the initial polygon (triangle) having three acute angles. - After each straight-line cut, one part of the polygon will definitely inherit the property of having at least three non-obtuse angles. 5. **Ensuring Non-Obtuse Angles upon Every Cut:** - Consider the situation where every time a straight-line cut is made, if it splits a non-obtuse angle, the resultant angles created at the end points of the cut will preserve the non-obtuse nature as splitting a non-obtuse angle cannot yield obtuse angles. 6. **Result After Multiple Cuts:** - Continuing this process, each iteration of cutting ensures at least one of the newly formed polygons has at least three non-obtuse angles. - Ultimately, through multiple such cutting steps, when we are left with only triangles, it ensures that among the resulting triangles, at least one will always have all three angles being non-obtuse. 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, it's impossible for all resulting triangles to be obtuse after repeatedly cutting the original acute triangle. Conclusion: None of the resulting triangles can be exclusively obtuse after cutting steps.

We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that any subset of ( X ) (where ( X = {1, 2, ldots, 98} )) with ( n ) elements has a good subset. 2. First, observe that ( n > 49 ). To see why, consider the set of all even numbers in ( X ): ( {2, 4, 6, ldots, 98} ). This set has 49 elements and any subset of 5 elements from this set will have a common factor of 2. Hence, such a subset does not satisfy the condition of a good subset. Therefore, ( n ) must be greater than 49. 3. Now we show that if ( n = 50 ), then any subset ( Y ) of ( X ) with 50 elements has a good subset. 4. For any subset ( Y ) with 50 elements, let ( e(Y) ) be the number of even elements in ( Y ). We will consider several cases based on ( e(Y) ). Case 1: ( e(Y) geq 31 ) 5. Suppose ( e(Y) geq 31 ), then ( Y ) has at most 19 odd numbers. 6. If ( Y ) contains an odd element ( x ) which is coprime to at least 9 even elements of ( Y ), then ( Y ) is good. Take ( Z ) to be ( x ) and 9 even elements of ( Y ) coprime to ( x ). Suppose ( Z ) is partitioned into ( A ) and ( B ). Without loss of generality, assume ( x in A ). Then ( x ) is coprime to the other elements of ( A ). All elements of ( B ) have a factor of 2, so no two elements of ( B ) are coprime. 7. For an odd element ( x ), since ( x < 3 times 5 times 7 = 105 ), ( x ) has at most 2 distinct prime factors. If ( x ) is prime, then any even element of ( X ) which has a common factor with ( x ) must be a multiple of ( 2x ). There are at most (leftlfloor frac{98}{6} rightrfloor = 16) such numbers. 8. If ( x = pq ) (with ( p ) and ( q ) distinct primes), there are at most (leftlfloor frac{98}{6} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{98}{10} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{98}{30} rightrfloor = 16 + 9 - 3 = 22) even numbers in ( X ) that have a common factor with ( x ). 9. Since ( e(Y) geq 31 ), ( Y ) must have at least ( 31 - 22 = 9 ) even members which are relatively prime to ( x ). Hence, the result is established. Case 2: ( 21 leq e(Y) leq 30 ) 10. In this case, ( Y ) has at least ( 20 ) odd numbers. 11. ( X ) has 16 odd multiples of 3 (like 3, 9, 15, 21, ...). We can choose ( x ) to be an odd number not divisible by 3. 12. Suppose ( x = 5 ), then there are (leftlfloor frac{98}{10} rightrfloor = 9) even numbers in ( X ) having a common factor with ( x ). 13. If ( x = 5p ) with ( p geq 13 ), then there are at most (leftlfloor frac{98}{10} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{98}{26} rightrfloor = 9 + 3 = 12) such even numbers. 14. If ( x = p > 7 ), then there are at most (leftlfloor frac{98}{14} rightrfloor = 7) even numbers sharing a common factor with ( x ). 15. If ( x = pq ), with ( p > 5 ), then there are at most (leftlfloor frac{98}{14} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{98}{22} rightrfloor = 7 + 4 = 11) even numbers sharing a common factor with ( x ). 16. So there are at most 12 such even numbers, hence, at least ( 21 - 12 = 9 ) even numbers are coprime to ( x ). Thus, the result is established. Case 3: ( 11 leq e(Y) leq 20 ) 17. In this scenario, ( Y ) has at least 30 odd numbers. 18. ( X ) has 16 odd numbers with the smallest prime factor being 3, 7 odd numbers with the smallest prime factor being 5 (5, 25, 35, etc.), 4 odd numbers with the smallest prime factor being 7, and 1 odd number with the smallest prime factor larger than 7. 19. Thus ( 16 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 28 ), allowing us to pick ( x ) such that its smallest prime factor ( p geq 17 ). 20. There are at most (leftlfloor frac{98}{34} rightrfloor = 2) even numbers of ( X ) that share a common factor with ( x ). Thus, there are at least 9 even numbers coprime to ( x ). Hence, the result is established. Case 4: ( e(Y) = 9 ) or ( 10 ) 21. Here, ( Y ) has at least 40 odd members. 22. These 40 members include at least one of the primes 53, 59, 61, 67, etc. 23. Pick ( x ) to be a prime ( geq 53 ). There are no even numbers in ( Y ) sharing a common factor with ( x ), hence, at least 9 even numbers must be coprime to ( x ). Thus, the result is established. Case 5: ( e(Y) leq 8 ) 24. ( Y ) contains at least 42 odd members. 25. These 42 members include at least one of the primes 61, 67, etc. 26. Let ( x ) be a prime ( geq 61 ), and let ( Z ) be formed by ( x ) and any 9 other multiples of 3 in ( Y ). Then ( Z ) is good as per earlier reasons discussed. 27.

Substituting the given magnitudes: boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b} = 2 cdot 5 cdot cos 120^circ = 2 cdot 5 cdot left( -frac{1}{2} right) = -5 2. **Express (2 boldsymbol{a} - boldsymbol{b}) cdot boldsymbol{a} using the distributive property of the dot product:** The dot product (2 boldsymbol{a} - boldsymbol{b}) cdot boldsymbol{a} can be expanded as: (2 boldsymbol{a} - boldsymbol{b}) cdot boldsymbol{a} = 2 (boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{a}) - (boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b}) 3. **Calculate boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{a}:** The dot product of boldsymbol{a} with itself is the square of its magnitude: boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{a} = |boldsymbol{a}|^2 = 2^2 = 4 4. **Substitute the known values into the expanded expression:** We already determined that boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b} = -5. Therefore: (2 boldsymbol{a} - boldsymbol{b}) cdot boldsymbol{a} = 2 (boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{a}) - (boldsymbol{a} cdot boldsymbol{b}) = 2 cdot 4 - (-5) (2 boldsymbol{a} - boldsymbol{b}) cdot boldsymbol{a} = 8 + 5 = 13 # Conclusion: The value of (2 boldsymbol{a} - boldsymbol{b}) cdot boldsymbol{a} is: boxed{13}"},{"instruction":"Walking 5/4 of his usual rate, a boy reaches his school 4 minutes early. What is his usual time to reach the school?","output":"Let's denote the boy's usual rate as ( R ) and his usual time to reach the school as ( T ). When he walks at ( frac{5}{4} ) of his usual rate, his new rate becomes ( frac{5}{4}R ). Since speed and time are inversely proportional (when distance is constant), we can set up the following relationship: ( frac{R}{T} = frac{frac{5}{4}R}{T - 4} ) This equation states that the boy's usual speed to time ratio is equal to his increased speed to the decreased time ratio (since he arrives 4 minutes early). Now we can solve for ( T ): ( R cdot T = frac{5}{4}R cdot (T - 4) ) Divide both sides by ( R ) to cancel out the rate: ( T = frac{5}{4} cdot (T - 4) ) Expand the right side: ( T = frac{5}{4}T - 5 ) Now, let's isolate ( T ) on one side: ( T - frac{5}{4}T = -5 ) Combine like terms: ( frac{1}{4}T = -5 ) Multiply both sides by 4 to solve for ( T ): ( T = -5 cdot 4 ) ( T = -20 ) However, time cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake in our signs.

Thus, k equiv 0, 7 pmod{8}. 2. **Divisibility by 3^3:** - We need k(k+1)(2k+1) to be divisible by 27. Considering the factors individually: - If k equiv 0 pmod{3}, 3|k, and we need at least another k or 2k+1 divisible by 9 for a total of 27. - If k equiv 1 pmod{3}, then 3|2k+1; k or k+1 must also be divisible by 9. - If k equiv 2 pmod{3}, then 3|k+1; k or 2k+1 must also be divisible by 9. - Let's assume k equiv 0 pmod{9} for simplicity. 3. **Divisibility by 5:** - Only one of k, k+1, or 2k+1 can be divisible by 5.
