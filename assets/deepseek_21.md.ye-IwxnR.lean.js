The stack is managed and optimized by the CPU, while the heap is managed by the runtime environment. The stack is significantly faster than the heap as it uses pre-allocated memory and does not require memory fragmentation; however, the size of objects stored in the stack is limited. On the other hand, the heap can allocate larger blocks of memory, but the time taken to allocate a block is greater than that of the stack."},{"instruction":"w is data stored in a binary tree in C++?","output":"Data is typically stored in a binary tree in C++ using a linked list with each node representing a data item.

Social media has become a pervasive part of modern culture, with billions of individuals worldwide using various platforms to connect with their friends, family and colleagues. While social media presents several advantages, it has also been associated with a variety of negative outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. This paper will review various studies that have explored the relationship between social media and mental health outcomes, focusing on three specific areas: (1) the impact of social media on self-esteem and body image, (2) the influence of social media on sleep patterns and cognitive functions, and (3) the role of social media in fostering social isolation and loneliness. Based on the findings, this paper will suggest several recommendations for individuals and policymakers alike to manage the negative impact of social media on mental health. Introduction: Social media has rapidly emerged as a dominant communication platform and has transformed the way we interact and connect with others. The rise of social media has allowed individuals to create online personas, express their opinions, and share different aspects of their lives with others. While social media has the ability to connect people across the globe, it has also been linked to negative impacts on mental health. There is a growing body of research exploring the link between social media and mental health, and this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. Impact of Social Media on Self-Esteem and Body Image: Several studies have suggested that social media use is negatively associated with self-esteem and body image. It has been noted that social media platforms highlight unrealistic beauty standards, resulting in users perceiving themselves as physically inferior, leading to lower self-esteem and negative body image. Research has also indicated that individuals who frequently use social media are more likely to engage in appearance-based comparisons, leading to negative implications for mental well-being. Influence of Social Media on Sleep Patterns and Cognitive Functions: The relationship between social media use and adverse impact on sleep patterns and cognitive function has been shown in numerous studies. Social media users are more likely to experience disrupted sleep patterns, resulting in less restful and restorative sleep. Meanwhile, excessive social media use has also been associated with diminished cognitive function and reduced attention span, impacting long-term mental health outcomes. Role of Social Media in Fostering Social Isolation and Loneliness: The use of social media can indirectly result in social isolation due to the perception of online connection replacing a lack of in-person social interaction. However, this is not the case, and it can lead to reduced self-worth, lower life satisfaction, and ultimately an increased sense of loneliness. Loneliness and isolation have been identified as significant predictors of diminished overall mental health. Conclusion: Social media has brought undeniable changes and benefits to the way people communicate and interact with each other. However, this paper has explored the negative effects of social media on mental health, including impacts on self-esteem and body image, sleep patterns, cognitive function, and fostering social isolation and loneliness. Policymakers need to be aware of these negative effects to develop policies that can manage the excessive use of social media. Individuals can take steps as well to protect their mental well-being by limiting the amount of time spent on social media, engaging in in-person social interactions, and practicing other mental health techniques."},{"instruction":"List the states in the United States of America in alphabetical order.","output":"Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming."},{"instruction":"vent a scientific name for a fictional creature: <N/A>","output":"I'm sorry, I cannot fulfill this task as you didn't provide a name or description for the fictional creature.

Depression is a mood disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Some of the symptoms of depression include persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and changes in appetite or sleeping patterns. Depression can be triggered by a variety of factors, including genetic predispositions, environmental factors, traumatic events, or significant life changes. Another prevalent mental illness is anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are characterized by persistent feelings of worry, fear, or unease. Some common types of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders can significantly interfere with one's daily life, making it difficult to perform routine activities or interact socially. Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects an individual's ability to think, feel, and behave appropriately. It is a chronic condition that can cause significant difficulties in one's life, including hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking. Schizophrenia typically requires ongoing medication and therapy to manage its symptoms effectively. Despite the prevalence of mental illness, it can still carry significant stigma and discrimination in society. Many individuals with mental health conditions face challenges when seeking treatment, including inadequate access to mental health services, high treatment costs, and social barriers. It is crucial to promote awareness and education about mental illnesses to help reduce stigma and ensure that individuals with mental health conditions have access to the necessary treatment and support. In conclusion, mental illness is a complex condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. It is essential to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health conditions, seek help when necessary, and reduce stigma to promote better mental health outcomes for all."},{"instruction":"Generate a recipe for vegan fried rice.","output":"Ingredients: - 1 cup of uncooked white rice - 2 cups of water - 1/4 cup of vegetable oil - 1 garlic clove, minced - 1/2 onion, chopped - 1/2 cup of frozen peas and carrots - 1/4 cup of soy sauce - 1 tsp of sesame oil - 1/4 tsp of black pepper Instructions: 1.

Glycolysis: Glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate (a 3-carbon molecule) in the cytoplasm of the cell. This process produces a small amount of ATP and NADH. 2. Pyruvate oxidation: The two molecules of pyruvate produced in glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, where they are converted into acetyl-CoA, which enters the next stage. This process also produces some ATP and NADH. 3. Citric acid cycle: Also known as the Krebs cycle, this process takes place in the mitochondria and involves a series of chemical reactions that convert acetyl-CoA into carbon dioxide. ATP, NADH, and FADH2 (another energy-carrying molecule) are also produced. 4. Electron transport chain: This process takes place in the inner membrane of the mitochondria and involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, which produces a large amount of ATP. This process requires oxygen and is therefore called aerobic respiration."},{"instruction":"Name five common plants found in a desert.","output":"1. Cactus 2. Sagebrush 3. Yucca 4. Joshua tree 5.

AI is playing a vital role in transforming the traditional logistics and supply chain industry into a digital ecosystem that is more efficient, accurate, and cost-effective. One of the primary areas that AI has impacted in the logistics and supply chain industry is the optimization of supply chain operations. With AI-enabled software and algorithms, companies can predict consumer demand, optimize delivery routes, and automate inventory management. AI can also be used to mitigate the impact of external factors such as natural disasters, traffic, and road closures, by providing alternate routes in real-time. Another significant impact of AI in the logistics and supply chain industry is the use of autonomous vehicles. With the rise of autonomous trucks, ships, and drones, deliveries can be made faster, more accurately, and without any human intervention. Autonomous vehicles also eliminate the risk of human errors, fatigue, and accidents that can occur while driving or handling goods. AI has also revolutionized the warehouse and inventory management systems. With AI-enabled robots and sensors, companies can automate repetitive tasks, minimize errors, and reduce the need for human intervention. These robots can work round-the-clock, process orders quickly, and optimize warehouse layout to make the best use of available space. In addition to improving efficiency, AI has also made the logistics and supply chain industry more transparent and customer-centric. Companies can provide real-time tracking of shipments, and customers can monitor the progress of their orders from purchase to delivery. Companies can also analyze customer feedback and preferences to improve their services and customize their offerings. In conclusion, AI has changed the logistics and supply chain industry for the better, improving efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. With AI-enabled systems and autonomous vehicles, companies can optimize their operations, automate routine tasks, and provide real-time tracking for their customers. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more significant improvements in the logistics and supply chain industry."},{"instruction":"Give examples of how businesses are using artificial intelligence","output":"1.

Cars have become a fundamental aspect of modern life, providing transportation, employment, and leisure activities. The industry has evolved over the years, with technological advancements and shifting consumer demands driving innovation and growth. One of the primary drivers of the automobile industry's success has been mass production. The assembly line techniques introduced by Henry Ford set the foundation for mass production, allowing for greater efficiency and reducing costs. This enabled cars to be produced at a more affordable price, expanding the market and increasing demand. In recent years, the industry has seen a shift towards alternative fuel vehicles, due to concerns over climate change and sustainability. Electric and hybrid cars have become increasingly popular, with governments incentivizing consumers to buy these vehicles. However, there is still a long way to go before they become mainstream, as they are still more expensive than traditional cars and have limited range. Another trend that has impacted the industry is the rise of autonomous vehicles. The development of self-driving cars has the potential to transform the way we travel, improving safety and reducing congestion on the roads. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome, such as the regulation of these vehicles and public trust. The automobile industry has also had a significant impact on employment. The industry employs millions of people, from engineers to factory workers to salespeople. The success of the industry is closely tied to economic growth, and as such, it is often seen as a barometer for the broader economy. In conclusion, the automobile industry is a vital sector in the global economy, driving innovation, employment and technological growth. Its evolution over the years has been strongly influenced by mass production, shifting consumer demands, and advances in technology.

Thus, we first need to find the length of each of the sides of the right triangle formed by the two points. The horizontal distance between the two points is 9 - 2 = 7. The vertical distance between the two points is 3 - 6 = -3. We need to take the absolute value of the vertical distance, as the Pythagorean theorem requires the lengths of the sides to be positive. So the length of one side of the right triangle is 7, and the length of the other side is | -3 | = 3. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse (i.e. the distance between the two points) is: sqrt(7^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(49 + 9) = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616. Therefore, the distance between the two points is approximately 7.616 units."},{"instruction":"Take the following question and generate an appropriate response that is less than 100 words: What is the most inspiring thing you have ever done?","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to do things.

A smartphone tracking app can help locate the phone's whereabouts quickly and easily, making it easier to recover. This can save a lot of time, money, and stress. 2. Provides peace of mind: Knowing that you can track your phone's location can give you peace of mind. If you misplace it or someone steals it, you can rest assured that you have a way of finding it. 3. Protects personal information: In the wrong hands, a lost or stolen phone can be a treasure trove of personal information. A tracking app can locate the phone and even remotely wipe the data, making it difficult for anyone to access your personal information or misuse it. 4. Allows us to track loved ones: A smartphone tracking app can also help us keep tabs on our loved ones. For example, parents can use it to track the location of their children, ensuring their safety and well-being. It's also useful for couples who want to keep an eye on each other's whereabouts for safety and practical reasons. 5. Provides insights into phone usage: Some tracking apps can also provide insights into how we use our phones. They can monitor app usage, screen time, and other activities to help us identify patterns and make better decisions about our phone usage. In conclusion, a smartphone tracking app is a useful and valuable tool that can help us locate lost or stolen phones, protect our personal information, track loved ones, and gain insights into our phone usage. It's essential to have one installed on our phones to ensure peace of mind and security."},{"instruction":"Construct a phrase using two or more different glyphs.","output":"🌞🌈🌊 - Sun, rainbow, ocean."},{"instruction":"Make a 3 sentence summary of the movie Avatar","output":"The movie Avatar is set in the future and follows the story of paralyzed Marine Jake Sully, who is sent to a distant moon called Pandora to communicate with the native Na'vi people.

They not only support the livelihoods of millions of people, but also provide a range of benefits, including shoreline protection and carbon sequestration. However, coral reefs are under threat due to a range of human activities. Conservation of coral reefs is critical to ensure their survival and the survival of the species that depend on them. One key approach to conservation is through the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs). These are areas of ocean that are set aside for conservation purposes, and where activities such as fishing and mining are restricted or banned. This approach has been successful in protecting coral reefs and their associated species. Another important aspect of conservation is the reduction of pollution and other human activities that adversely affect coral reefs. This includes reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, as well as the reduction of other pollutants such as sewage and agricultural runoff. Protecting coral reefs also includes the management of commercial activities such as fishing and tourism, which can put additional stress on these delicate ecosystems. Education and awareness-raising among local communities is also critical for coral reef conservation. This can include providing information about the importance of coral reefs and the actions that individuals can take to reduce their impact on these ecosystems. In conclusion, coral reefs are vital ecosystems, and their conservation is essential to ensure their survival and the survival of the species that depend on them. Protecting and conserving coral reefs requires a range of approaches, from creating marine protected areas to reducing pollution, and raising awareness about the importance of these ecosystems."},{"instruction":"Evaluate if the input statement can be generalized to all cases: Fish cannot climb trees.","output":"Yes, the input statement can be generalized to all cases as it is a universal fact that fish are not capable of climbing trees due to their physical structure and aquatic nature."},{"instruction":"Create a list of five vegetables and their nutritional benefits.","output":"1.

One of the primary disadvantages of this form of learning is the lack of face-to-face interaction between students and teachers. This can lead to a disconnect between students and their instructors, making it difficult for learners to ask questions or receive personalized feedback. Another challenge with online education is the lack of structure and accountability. Students must be self-motivated and disciplined to succeed in this type of environment, which can be a struggle for many. Without the routine of attending classes and homework deadlines, students may fail to prioritize their studies and fall behind. Another issue with online education is the limited opportunities for group work and collaboration. Learning with and from peers is an essential aspect of education that fosters critical thinking, communication skills, and teamwork. In the absence of this, students may not develop these skills fully, which can be a disadvantage in the workplace. In addition, online courses may not always provide the same level of academic rigor and challenge as traditional classroom settings. This may be due to the lack of hands-on experiences and direct contact with instructors, which are essential to developing important skills and knowledge in a particular subject. Overall, while online education can be a useful tool for learning, it is important to consider its disadvantages before enrolling in a program. The lack of face-to-face interaction, structure, and opportunities for group work may hinder a student's success.

Stocks offer the opportunity for high returns, as well as a chance to own a piece of some of the world's most successful businesses. Here are five reasons why you should consider investing in stocks: 1. Growth potential Stocks have a higher potential for growth than many other types of investments. Historically, stocks have averaged annual returns of around 10%, which is significantly higher than the returns on bonds or cash investments. 2. Diversification Investing in stocks allows you to diversify your portfolio. Diversification means spreading your investment dollars across a variety of assets to reduce your overall risk. Stocks allow you to own a small piece of multiple companies, which can help you spread your risk. 3. Ownership When you invest in a stock, you become a part owner of the company you are investing in. This means that when the company makes money, you may receive dividends, which are a portion of the company's profits paid out to shareholders. 4. Liquidity Stocks are highly liquid, meaning you can easily buy and sell them. This makes it easy to adjust your portfolio as your investment goals change or as the market changes. 5. Long-term potential Investing in stocks is a long-term game. Although there are ups and downs in the stock market, over the long term, the market has always gone up. By investing in stocks for the long term, you can be confident that your investment will grow, assuming you make smart investment choices. In conclusion, investing in stocks is a smart way to grow your wealth over time. With high growth potential, diversification opportunities, ownership benefits, liquidity, and long-term potential, stocks are an excellent choice for investors looking to build wealth."},{"instruction":"Explain the concept of emotional intelligence.","output":"Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify, understand and manage one's own emotions, as well as recognize and adapt to the emotions of others.

Moreover, waking up early allows individuals to establish a routine, which in turn can improve sleep patterns and lead to a more restful night's sleep. In addition to more time and better sleep habits, waking up early has been linked to increased productivity and overall success. Studies have shown that many successful individuals, from business executives to athletes, are early risers. Waking up early offers an opportunity to be proactive rather than reactive. Early morning hours can be used to focus on personal goals, plan for the day ahead, and tackle challenging tasks before other distractions arise. This proactive approach can lead to increased productivity and a greater sense of accomplishment. Finally, waking up early can have positive effects on mental health. Early morning hours can be a peaceful and quiet time for reflection, meditation, or simply enjoying some alone time. Starting the day in a calm and positive manner can set a positive tone for the rest of the day. Furthermore, research suggests that exposure to natural light early in the day can increase serotonin levels in the brain, which is responsible for mood regulation.

As humans, we must acknowledge that animals have their own lives and rights just as much as we do. It is our responsibility to ensure that their rights are protected, and they are treated with compassion and respect. Many animals suffer from exploitation, abuse, and cruelty. They are mistreated in industries like factory farming, cosmetics testing, and entertainment. These innocent animals are often subjected to inhumane conditions and treated as nothing more than commodities. Furthermore, animal rights are not just about preventing unnecessary suffering. It's also about ensuring that animals have the right to live their lives the way they would naturally without any human interference. This is especially true for animals living in the wild or natural habitats. Animal rights are not a luxury, but rather a necessity. By respecting animal rights, we can increase our compassion and empathy towards all living beings, not just humans. We must take a stand against animal cruelty and advocate for the protection of animal rights. In conclusion, animal rights are a crucial issue that cannot be ignored. It's time for us to recognize and respect the rights of all animals, and take necessary actions to ensure that they are protected and treated with kindness and compassion. We must be the voice for those who cannot speak for themselves and advocate for animal rights."},{"instruction":"Find two quotes related to the given keyword and explain their meanings in your own words: Success","output":"Quote 1: \\"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.\\" - Winston Churchill Meaning: The quote suggests that achieving success doesn't guarantee that it will last forever, and encountering failure doesn't mean that it's the end.

You'll need to both modify the initial script and add an event listener for the \`click\` event on each parent \`li\`. **Enhancing the Initial Script** First, continue with the approach of having the sub-menus hidden by default using CSS and expanding the relevant sub-menu during page load as previously described. Then, we'll incorporate the logic for handling user clicks. **Step 1: Maintain CSS for Hidden Sub-menus by Default** \`\`\`css .vertical-nav-menu ul { display: none; } \`\`\` **Step 2: JavaScript Enhancement for Page Load and User Clicks** Let's refine the script to: 1. Expand the active sub-menu automatically on page load if its link matches the current URL. 2. Add click event listeners to the parent \`li\` elements to toggle the display of their child \`ul\`, allowing users to manually expand or collapse menus. \`\`\`js document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { const currentLocation = location.href; const menuItems = document.querySelectorAll('.vertical-nav-menu li a'); const menuLength = menuItems.length; for (let i = 0; i < menuLength; i++) { // Check if the menu item's href matches the current location. if (menuItems[i].href === currentLocation) { menuItems[i].classList.add('mm-active'); let parentLi = menuItems[i].closest('li'); parentLi.classList.add('mm-active'); let parentUl = parentLi.closest('ul'); if (parentUl && parentUl !== document.getElementById('navMenu')) { parentUl.style.display = 'block'; } } // Add event listener for clicks to toggle submenus if(menuItems[i].nextElementSibling && menuItems[i].nextElementSibling.tagName === 'UL') { menuItems[i].addEventListener('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); // Prevent navigation for demonstrative purposes let childUl = this.nextElementSibling; childUl.style.display = childUl.style.display === 'none' ? 'block' : 'none'; }); } } }); \`\`\` **Notes:** 1. **Sub-menu Visibility Toggle:** The script checks if a menu item's next sibling is a \`UL\` and sets up a click event listener for toggling its visibility. This is for items that can expand/collapse sub-menus. 2. **Active Menu Expansion:** On page load, if the menu item \`href\` matches \`currentLocation\`, it's marked active, and its sub-menu is expanded. **Step 3: Refinement & Usability Considerations** - **Smooth Transitions:** Consider adding CSS transitions for smoother opening/closing animations of the sub-menus. \`\`\`css .vertical-nav-menu ul { display: none; transition: all 0.3s ease; } \`\`\` - **Accessibility & User Experience:** Ensure that your navigation is accessible, especially for keyboard users and screen readers. Use correct aria attributes to indicate state changes (like \`aria-expanded\`). - **Preserving Navigation Functionality:** The \`e.preventDefault()\` in the click listener prevents actual navigation. It's there to demonstrate the expand/collapse functionality. In a real scenario, you might not want to prevent default behavior if the link is meant to navigate to another page, or you might only prevent it when the submenu is collapsed to indicate it needs expanding first. - **Active Class and Page Reload:** If your application relies on server-side rendering or full page reloads, the active class handling and sub-menu visibility on page load will work as expected. For single-page applications (SPAs) or when using AJAX to load content, ensure you re-run the relevant parts of this script after the content changes to update which menu item is active and ensure proper submenu visibility."},{"instruction":"how do i fix the error undefined array key \\"sub_id\\" in update-guide-video.php(when trying to get the current subject from ged_subject_tbl(the data is correct)): <?php session_start(); if (!isset(_SESSION['admin']['adminnakalogin']) == true) header(\\"location:index.php\\"); ?> <?php include(\\"../../conn.php\\"); ?> <?php include(\\"includes/header.php\\"); ?> <?php include(\\"includes/ui-theme.php\\"); ?> <div class=\\"app-main\\"> <?php include(\\"includes/sidebar.php\\"); ?> <?php vidId = _GET['id']; selVideo = conn->query(\\"SELECT * FROM ged_subject_videos WHERE vid_id='vidId' \\"); selVideoRow = selVideo->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); cou_id = selVideoRow['cou_id']; selCoursesResult = conn->query(\\"SELECT cou_name FROM ged_course_tbl WHERE cou_id='cou_id' \\"); selCoursesRow = selCoursesResult->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); courseName = selCoursesRow['cou_name']; courseId = selVideoRow['cou_id']; selCourse = conn->query(\\"SELECT cou_name as courseName FROM ged_course_tbl WHERE cou_id='courseId' \\")->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); subjectId = selVideoRow['subj_id']; selSubject = conn->query(\\"SELECT sub_title as subjectName FROM ged_subject_tbl WHERE sub_id='subjectId' \\")->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); ?> <?php if (isset(_GET['success'])) { echo '<div class=\\"alert alert-success\\">' . _GET['success'] .

However, the term has been colloquially used to describe a phenomenon where individuals, particularly breastfeeding mothers, experience feelings of sadness, depression, or emotional distress when their milk lets down, a phase also known as the milk ejection reflex. This peculiar sensation is believed to be due to the sudden release of hormones, including oxytocin, that accompanies milk letdown. This phenomenon should not be confused with Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-MER), which is a recognized condition. D-MER is characterized by an abrupt dysphoria or negative emotions that occur just before the milk ejection reflex and last for a few minutes. Women experiencing D-MER might feel sadness, anxiety, or other emotional drops, but these feelings are typically brief and directly tied to the milk letdown reflex. If you're experiencing feelings of sadness or other emotional distress related to breastfeeding or at any other time, it is crucial to consult healthcare professionals, such as a doctor or a lactation consultant. They can offer support, resources, and, if necessary, refer you to appropriate mental health services. Postpartum depression and anxiety are important conditions that require professional attention, support, and treatment."},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: эйASSISTANT:","output":"Привет!

It divides your body into three groups: pushing muscles, pulling muscles, and legs. This allows you to train each muscle group adequately, with ample recovery time between sessions. Here's a sample Push-Pull-Legs routine that you might find beneficial. Remember, it's essential to adjust weights, sets, and reps based on your own fitness level and goals. # Push Day (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps) 1. **Bench Press** - 4 sets of 6-8 reps 2. **Overhead Press** - 3 sets of 8-10 reps 3. **Incline Dumbbell Press** - 3 sets of 8-10 reps 4. **Side Lateral Raises** - 3 sets of 12-15 reps 5. **Dips** - 3 sets to failure (add weight if needed) 6. **Tricep Pushdowns** - 3 sets of 10-12 reps # Pull Day (Back, Biceps) 1. **Deadlifts** - 4 sets of 6-8 reps 2. **Pull-Ups (or Lat Pulldowns)** - 3 sets of 8-10 reps 3. **Barbell Rows** - 3 sets of 8-10 reps 4. **Face Pulls** - 3 sets of 12-15 reps 5. **Hammer Curls** - 3 sets of 10-12 reps 6. **Barbell Curls** - 3 sets of 10-12 reps # Legs Day (Quads, Hamstrings, Calves) 1. **Squats** - 4 sets of 6-8 reps 2. **Romanian Deadlifts** - 3 sets of 8-10 reps 3. **Leg Press** - 3 sets of 10-12 reps 4. **Leg Curls** - 3 sets of 10-12 reps 5. **Calf Raises** - 5 sets of 15-20 reps 6. **Lunges (optional)** - 3 sets of 10 reps per leg # Additional Tips - Always start your workout with a proper warm-up to prevent injuries and end your workout with some stretching to aid recovery. - Rest: Take a rest day after every push-pull-leg session to allow for muscle recovery and growth. For example, you can follow a format of Push day -> Rest day -> Pull day -> Rest day -> Legs day -> Rest day -> Rest day. - Nutrition: Proper nutrition and hydration are key to maximizing your gains and recovery. - Progression: Aim to gradually increase either the weight you're lifting or the number of reps or sets you're performing as you get stronger. - Monitor your form to ensure you're performing each exercise correctly to avoid injury and ensure the effectiveness of your workout. Remember, these exercises are just a template.

Whether it \\"works\\" or not largely depends on your fitness goals, training experience, and how you execute the routine. Here are some considerations: # Advantages of the Bro Split 1. **Focus and Intensity:** It allows for a high level of focus and intensity on each muscle group. Since you're only training each group once a week, you can afford to do a variety of exercises and a higher volume of work. 2. **Recovery:** It provides ample recovery time for each muscle group before it's trained again, which can be beneficial for muscle growth and reducing risk of overtraining. 3. **Simplicity:** For beginners or those who prefer a straightforward approach, having a dedicated day for each muscle group can be easier to remember and stick to. # Disadvantages of the Bro Split 1. **Frequency:** The major criticism is the once-per-week frequency per muscle group, which might not be optimal for muscle growth for many people. Research suggests that training muscle groups twice per week may promote more significant muscle hypertrophy and strength gains for many individuals. 2. **Imbalance:** There's a risk of developing muscular imbalances if not all muscle groups are trained equally or if some are neglected altogether. 3. **Inefficiency:** For beginners or those with limited time, spending an entire workout on a single muscle group might not be the most efficient use of time. # Efficiency and Goals - **Beginners:** May benefit more from full-body workouts or upper/lower splits that allow for higher frequency per muscle group. - **Intermediate/Advanced:** Individuals with more experience or those targeting specific weaknesses might find the Bro Split beneficial for its intense focus. - **Goals:** If your goal is maximum size and you have the time to dedicate to this kind of split, while paying attention to balanced development and recovery, the Bro Split can be effective. # Research and Practical Experience Research on hypertrophy and strength training offers mixed results, with some studies suggesting higher frequencies are better, while others show no significant difference. Anecdotally, many bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts have seen great results with Bro Splits, highlighting the importance of individual response to training. # Conclusion The Bro Split can work well for muscle growth and strength increases if properly structured and aligned with your training experience and goals. Like any training regimen, its effectiveness comes down to consistency, intensity, and progression over time, as well as adequate nutrition and rest. It's always a good idea to periodically reassess your progress and adjust your training approach as needed."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Good luck with your development!"},{"instruction":"The game will have a day and night cycle on any map. Like for example, during the levels taking place in the coast area of the game, the jeep in that level will have its headlights turned on and the helicopter that chases you in the canals level has a spotlight.","output":"Incorporating a day and night cycle into your game adds a dynamic layer of immersion that can significantly affect gameplay and strategy. Your examples of the jeep headlights and the helicopter spotlight demonstrate thoughtful integration of this cycle into gameplay mechanics. Here are some ideas and considerations for leveraging the day/night cycle further: # Gameplay Mechanics 1. **Enemy Behavior**: Enemies could have different patterns or behaviors based on the time of day. For example, at night, some enemies might rely more on spotlights or searchlights, changing their patrol routes to be less predictable. Others might be more aggressive or cautious. 2. **Vision and Stealth**: The night could offer opportunities for stealthier gameplay, allowing players to navigate levels with more emphasis on avoiding detection. This could be further enhanced with mechanics like night vision goggles or devices that disrupt enemy spotlights temporarily. 3. **Environmental Challenges**: At night, environmental hazards could become more dangerous or harder to navigate. For example, in the coastal area, the tides might change, revealing new paths or hiding certain areas, affecting how players can progress or what secrets they can discover. 4. **Lighting as a Resource**: Players might need to manage light sources, such as the jeep’s headlights, flares, or portable lamps, not only to see but also to solve puzzles or ward off certain enemies that react negatively to light. # Visuals and Atmosphere 1. **Dynamic Lighting Effects**: Use the headlights and spotlight to create tense moments, especially if the light reveals hidden dangers or changes the mood of an area. The way light plays off the environment can significantly impact the atmosphere, from the serene beauty of moonlight on water to the harsh glare of a helicopter spotlight in a tense chase. 2. **Skybox and Lighting Transitions**: Ensure smooth transitions between day and night cycles, with realistic colors and shadows. The skybox could reflect the passage of time with dynamic features like moving clouds, stars, and the moon, enhancing immersion. 3. **Adaptive Sound Design**: The ambient sound should change with the time of day. At night, the environment could become quieter, making footsteps and enemy movements more pronounced, or introduce nocturnal sounds that add to the atmosphere. # Interaction and Exploration 1. **Time-Specific Events and Encounters**: Introduce events or encounters that only occur at certain times, encouraging players to visit areas during both the day and night. For example, a rare creature might only appear along the coast at night, or a group of resistance fighters might only meet at a certain location after sundown. 2. **Visual Cues and Navigation**: Use the day/night cycle to influence visual cues for navigation. Landmarks might be easier or harder to spot, and areas could feel completely different at night, offering a fresh perspective or new challenges in navigation. Incorporating these elements can make the day and night cycle an integral part of your game’s design, affecting not just the aesthetics but also how players interact with the world and its inhabitants. It also opens up opportunities for varied and engaging level design that takes advantage of the unique qualities of both day and night settings."},{"instruction":"So far, the levels in the game are: CHAPTER I, MEMORIES: LOCATION: TRAIN STATION AND CITY.

It's around 7000 feet tall. Its floors, walls and ceilings are entirely covered in tiles. Metallic pipes with organic shapes can be found all around. The first floor has a prison-like area. The color palette for the citadel are black, blue, gray and white.","output":"The Citadel, as described, stands as a monumental structure both in its physical presence and symbolic significance within the game’s world. Its staggering height and the convergence of metallic and organic design elements make it an intimidating fortress of power. Here’s how these elements can be developed further to create an immersive and narratively rich environment for players: # Architectural and Aesthetic Details - **Exterior Design**: The external appearance of the Citadel, with its massive scale and imposing silhouette against the skyline, could serve as a constant visual reference point for players throughout their journey. Its design, a blend of stark geometric shapes and unnerving organic contours, suggests a fusion of advanced technology with otherworldly influences, setting the stage for the encounters within. - **Entrance and Interior**: The entrance to the Citadel could be designed to accentuate the transition from the oppressed outer world to the seat of power. As players move through the interior, the seamless blend of tiles covering floors, walls, and ceilings, combined with the color palette of black, blue, gray, and white, could evoke a cold, otherworldly atmosphere. Metallic pipes with organic shapes add to the unsettling ambiance, suggesting a pervasive control over natural and technological elements. # Gameplay and Exploration Dynamics - **First Floor – The Prison**: Starting players on a prison-like first floor provides a direct confrontational experience with the regime's oppressive nature.

However, for the specific requirement of counting rows with a 0 in either column A, column B, or both, we need a slightly different approach to directly address the \\"either...or\\" part of the condition. We can use an array formula with \`SUM\` and \`--\` (double unary) for coercion to a numeric value, or use \`SUMPRODUCT\` for a non-array formula approach. Here's a method using \`SUMPRODUCT\`, which is simpler for most Excel users and does not require entering the formula as an array formula: \`\`\`excel =SUMPRODUCT(--((A:A = 0) + (B:B = 0) > 0)) \`\`\` **Explanation:** - \`A:A = 0\` creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values where TRUE corresponds to cells in column A that are 0. - \`B:B = 0\` does the same for column B. - \`(A:A = 0) + (B:B = 0)\` adds the arrays together. Since TRUE acts like 1 and FALSE acts like 0 in arithmetic operations, rows where either condition is TRUE will have a result of at least 1 (1 for one TRUE, 2 for two TRUES). - \`> 0\` converts the array of sums into TRUE/FALSE where TRUE indicates rows that had at least one 0 in column A or column B. - \`--\` before the condition coerces TRUE/FALSE to 1/0. This step is technically not needed due to how \`SUMPRODUCT\` handles TRUE/FALSE values, so it's omitted here for simplification. - \`SUMPRODUCT\` sums up the 1's and 0's to give the total count of rows with a 0 in either column A, column B, or both. **Important Notes:** - Ensure your ranges in \`SUMPRODUCT\` are not unnecessarily large as it can slow down calculation times (e.g., \`A1:A100\` and \`B1:B100\` instead of \`A:A\` and \`B:B\` if you're working within a specific range). - The formula assumes numeric 0s. If your zeros could be text (i.e., \\"0\\" instead of 0), you'll need to adjust the condition to account for text comparisons. **Alternative Approach (Using COUNTIFS):** For completeness, let's also touch on how one might attempt to use \`COUNTIFS\` for a similar purpose, though it's not as straightforward for this specific \\"either...or\\" condition without additional helper columns or calculations: \`COUNTIFS\` is typically used for counting cells that meet multiple criteria across multiple ranges with an AND logic, so it's not directly applicable for an OR logic across two columns without auxiliary calculations."},{"instruction":"Remove the Indirects from the following excel formula whilst making sure it will still work as intended: =COUNTIF((INDIRECT(\\"E83:E112\\")),\\"0\\")+COUNTIF((INDIRECT(\\"G83:G112\\")),\\"<1\\")-COUNTIFS((INDIRECT(\\"E83:E112\\")),\\"0\\", (INDIRECT(\\"G83:G112\\")),\\"0\\")","output":"To revise the given formula and remove the \`INDIRECT\` function while ensuring it will still work as intended, you can directly reference the ranges without \`INDIRECT\`. The original formula uses \`INDIRECT\` probably to keep the references as text, which makes it easy to copy, paste, or programmatically adjust, but it's not necessary if the references are static and known. Here is the simplified version: \`\`\`excel =COUNTIF(E83:E112,\\"0\\") + COUNTIF(G83:G112,\\"<1\\") - COUNTIFS(E83:E112,\\"0\\", G83:G112,\\"0\\") \`\`\` **Explanation**: 1. \`COUNTIF(E83:E112,\\"0\\")\` counts the number of zeros in the range E83:E112. 2. \`COUNTIF(G83:G112,\\"<1\\")\` counts the number of cells with a value less than 1 in the range G83:G112. This includes negative numbers and zeroes. 3. \`COUNTIFS(E83:E112,\\"0\\", G83:G112,\\"0\\")\` counts the number of rows where both conditions are met: a zero in the corresponding cell of E83:E112 and a zero in the corresponding cell of G83:G112. 4. The first two counts are added, and then the count from step 3 is subtracted. This effectively removes the double-counted items (where both columns have a zero) from the total. The edited formula functions the same as the original but without the use of \`INDIRECT\`, making it simpler and likely more efficient during calculation since \`INDIRECT\` can cause performance issues in large workbooks and also makes the formula non-volatile (whereas \`INDIRECT\` is volatile and recalculates with every worksheet change). Remember, using direct cell references like this assumes that you don't need the flexibility of changing reference ranges through the manipulation of text strings (which is something \`INDIRECT\` allows you to do).

You see, Arlo wasn’t your garden-variety painter who slathered canvases with brooding skies or somnolent bowls of fruit. No, sir. His paintings made things happen. Magical things. The kind that makes you doubt your eyesight and consider getting your head checked. If Arlo painted you in clogs, tap-dancing in the town square, well, the odds became good that you’d wake up the next morning with an uncontrollable urge to shuffle-ball-change right next to Mrs. Higgins’ flower cart. No one knew how he did it, but that probably added to the soup of intrigue that folks around Whistleridge happily slurped up. On a particularly unassuming Tuesday, Arlo decided it was high time for another showstopper. At precisely 6:42 AM, with a steaming mug of what could only be described as “coffee adjacent,” he propped a pristine canvas on his easel. He stared at it with a kind of intensity usually reserved for defusing bombs or reading the terms and conditions of an app before reflexively hitting ‘accept.’ The townspeople of Whistleridge held their collective breath. Arlo hadn’t unveiled a new piece since the ‘Infinity Soup’ incident, in which Mrs. Fletcher stirred her pot to find it never emptied, and people grew weary of minestrone for weeks. With a mischievous twinkle in his eye, Arlo picked up his brush and pondered over his vast collection of paints. They weren’t labeled red, blue, or any such pedestrian titles. Oh, no. Instead, they read: “Chuckle,” “Guffaw,” and “Snort.” With a confident exuberance, he dove the bristles into a hue called “Hilarity Ensues.” As the day wore on, Arlo painted with an energy that would shame the swiftest squirrel preparing for winter. The canvas soon bloomed with a carnival scene not of this world. There were tents striped in colors that defied physics, lollipop trees, and a merry-go-round with creatures that looked suspiciously like Mrs. Higgins’ tabby fused with a toucan. Word spread faster than butter on a hot skillet, and soon enough, a crowd gathered around Arlo’s studio—which, to be fair, was just the dilapidated barn he had claimed in ‘the Name of Art’ several summers ago. They peered through the gaps in the wood, eager for a glance of the master at work. As dusk painted the sky with its own stunning artistry, Arlo laid down his brush with an air of finality. The townspeople waited, barely daring to breathe. An acceptable silence, the kind that might follow a particularly good joke or a dramatic soap opera confession, settled over the crowd. Nightfall cinched Whistleridge in her starry embrace when Arlo flung open the barn doors. The townsfolk craned their necks like a flock of curious geese, only to meet… absolutely nothing. The easel sat forlorn and empty. “B-but where’s the painting, Arlo?” cried young Timmy, whose disappointment was as palpable as the stickiness of his candy-smeared cheeks. Arlo smiled a serpentine curl of a smile and gestured grandly behind them. The crowd turned to see the Whistleridge Town Square transformed. The merry-go-round spun with mythical beasties, while the lollipop trees swayed to an inaudible symphony. The carnival had leaked, no, burst from the canvas and was alive before their very eyes. The townspeople blinked in astonishment. “Is this one of those magic-eye things? Because I’ve never been good at those,” muttered Mr. Quimby, squinting as if that would help things make sense. Arlo chuckled. “Hilarity Ensues!” he declared and, with a hat-tip, strode into the carnival. The townsfolk gamboled after him, giddy as children who’d discovered that math homework could, in fact, “do itself” if wished hard enough. Magic fizzed in the air, as tangible as the bubbles in soda pop, making the impossible possible. In no time flat, Whistleridge went from a sleepy little village to a buzzing social hotspot. News had traveled, like due credit in an office gossiper’s ledger, to every conceivable corner. People flocked from far and wide to witness the art that breathed life, laughter, and a touch of the inexplicable. Arlo, the man of the hour every hour, became something of a celebrity. With his newfound status, he took his eccentricities to new heights. He donned a pinstripe suit that wavered between outlandish and outright spectacle, with a top hat that had its own weather system. The carnival thrived for weeks, an endless masquerade where reality tip-toed around fantasy with courtly grace. Arlo’s infamy swelled like a baking bread left to rise too long in the warm cupboard of local legend. Things, however, took a turn for the peculiar when it became apparent that the merry-go-round refused to let anyone off. The tabby-toucan hybrids squawked meows in what seemed perpetually looped amusement. Confections grew back as soon as they were plucked from the lollipop trees. What was once delight teetered on the verge of a conundrum wrapped in a riddle and deep-fried in confectionery sugar. Arlo watched over his creation from atop his high-top-hat perch, scratching his chin as if pondering the nutritional value of a plastic apple. One midsummer night, as the perpetual festivities beat on, a peculiar figure emerged from the shadows—a woman with eyes that wouldn’t stay one color, and hair that defied gravity as successfully as Arlo’s hat. She sidled up to Arlo and whispered something that made him go paler than an undercooked biscuit. The next morning, the carnival was gone. It vanished, as if it had been sucked back into the void of a magician’s pocket. No merry-go-round, no tabby-toucans, not even the lingering sweetness of phantom cotton candy on the breeze. The townsfolk stood agape in the town square, neither a stripe nor a sweet in sight. “But where did it go?” lamented Mrs. Higgins, officially out of a job as a tabby-toucan feeder. Arlo, back in his pre-carnival attire of a paint-smeared smock, couldn’t suppress a sheepish grin. From behind his back, he produced… was it a ticket stub? “Turns out the lady’s the Master of Fine Arts and Entertainment. She runs a traveling carnival,” he explained, “and she wanted her attractions back. Gave me one free ride as a courtesy.” Once again, Whistleridge fell under a hush. “You mean to say, it was never magic?” asked Timmy, the disillusionment blatant in his voice. Arlo’s eyes twinkled mischievously. “Oh, it was magic alright—but the kind you need to pack up and cart to the next town, come sunup.” Whispering began crowding the air, a composite murmur of awe and slight annoyance, like when you find out the tooth fairy outsources her under-the-pillow operations. In the end, Whistleridge returned to its previous state: a quiet nook in the world where surprising things sometimes happened, especially if Arlo Finch had anything to do with it. Arlo returned to his studio, back to blending shades of ‘Unsubstantiated Rumor’ and ‘Whimsical Whispers.’ And deep down, just beyond the reach of the mortal eye, he kept a single, miraculous top hat—just in case the Master of Fine Arts and Entertainment required his extraordinary services again.

Story: Set the story during a total eclipse — either natural, or man-made. Fiction","output":"Under the grand expanse of a sky more temperamental than a chat show host on a caffeine withdrawal, the small town of Doodledum found itself on the cusp of a cosmic event—the sort that sends sales of cardboard glasses skyrocketing and has local news crews wishing they'd paid more attention in astronomy class. In Doodledum, eclipses, whether served naturally or with a hint of man-made artificial sweetener, were the social seasoning that transformed the town from a plate of plain boiled potatoes to a culinary extravaganza sprinkled with intrigue and a dash of lunacy. Our story centers on Percival Pettigrew, a man whose enthusiasm for celestial happenings was outweighed only by his ability to make complicated things sound utterly simple. \\"It's like the sun's playing hide and seek,\\" he'd say, \\"and the moon's a cheeky toddler that's really quite rubbish at the game.\\" Percival lived in a cottage that seemed to have been conceived during a fairy tale writer's fever dream—think less “charming thatch” and more “gingerbread under structural strain.” It was here, amid the clutter of star charts and telescopes that double as impromptu coat racks, that he concocted his plan for the Total Eclipse Extravaganza—a name that promised more balloons than were actually involved. Now, it's important to note that Percival's idea of an extravaganza was somewhat akin to a child's birthday party if the child were a retired astronomer with a passion for folk music. However, when the word 'extravaganza' hit the town's rumor mill, it came out the other end dressed in expectations and wearing a top hat. The townsfolk buzzed with anticipation, knitting eclipse-themed sweaters and baking sun and moon pies, despite no one quite knowing what to expect. On the eve of the eclipse, as the sun dipped below the horizon like a diva making a dramatic stage exit, Percival unveiled his creation. Not a machine for viewing the eclipse—there were plenty of cardboard glasses for that—but an Eclipse Emulator™, a contraption that could theoretically recreate the conditions of a total eclipse. The Emulator was a hodgepodge of bicycle parts, old television screens, and what suspiciously looked like the innards of several toasters. \\"For that extra bit of crunch,\\" Percival would say, utterly unhelped by context. The next morning, Doodledum's population, swelled by neighboring gawkers and a cat that fancied itself a dog, congregated in the town square. The air was electric, or that might have been the residual effect of Percival's Emulator, which hummed with the energy of a thousand anticipatory gazes. As the appointed hour approached, a hush fell over the crowd like a thick blanket, smothering even the sound of Mrs. Wembly's notoriously loud hat. Percival, sporting a pair of goggles that gave him the appearance of a deranged inventor (not entirely inaccurately), flicked the switch. Light dimmed artificially as the Emulator whirred to life, casting the square into twilight. The crowd murmured in amazement, their faces a carnival of shadows and awe. For a moment, Doodledum had its eclipse—man-made, granted, yet no less magical for it. Then, with a pop reminiscent of a surprised octopus, the Emulator gave out, plunging the square not into darkness, but into the full, glaring light of day. The eclipse, it seemed, had passed unnoticed during the Emulator's brief moment of glory. Percival, ever the optimist, merely adjusted his goggles and declared, \\"Well, that's the dress rehearsal done! Now, for the real show next time!\\" The townsfolk, initially confused, couldn't help but be swept up in his unrelenting enthusiasm. The Eclipse Emulator™, though a failure in its intended purpose, had managed to eclipse (pun absolutely intended) the natural phenomenon in terms of sheer communal spirit and inventive gusto. However, not all spectacles that day were man-made. As the crowd dispersed, chattering excitedly about the next celestial event a decade hence, little Timmy Trounson pointed skyward. The sun, having resumed its place as the star of the show, flickered like a poorly adjusted projector. Then, in a spectacle defying expectation and logic, the sky darkened once more—not a natural eclipse, but a celestial encore performance, as stars blinked into view in broad daylight. The townsfolk, summoned back by Timmy's cries of wonder, watched in awe as the cosmos seemed to rearrange itself for their amusement, a tapestry of stars and planets dancing in the midday gloom. Percival, his Eclipse Emulator™ forgotten, stood among them, a smile of childlike wonder spreading across his face. He knew, as did the rest of Doodledum, that some magic, whether born from the heavens or concocted in a gingerbread cottage, was simply beyond the realm of science to explain or replicate. \\"This,\\" he whispered, \\"is truly an extravaganza.\\" And as if in agreement, the sky performed its final trick—a shooting star, blazing boldly across the noonday night, as though winking at the tiny town tucked beneath its vast, enigmatic expanse. But let's not tarry on the celestial ballet for too long, for it's in the afterglow of this cosmic concert that our tale finds its twist. Percival's Emulator, though seemingly defunct, had broadcasted the day’s events far beyond the confines of Doodledum. The peculiar fluctuation of light had piqued the interest of a satellite, which, unbeknownst to all, had been monitoring the area as part of a study on rural light pollution. Prompt me to continue."},{"instruction":"continue","output":"The satellite, belonging to the Global Environmental Watch (GEW), had been dutifully recording fluctuations in natural light sources when it stumbled upon the anomaly that was the Eclipse Emulator's brief, shining moment. Curiosity piqued, the GEW decided to send a team to Doodledum—a decision met with much scratching of heads and adjusting of spectacles among the town's populace. Led by Dr. Helena Foss, an astrophysicist with more accolades than Percival had mismatched socks (and that was saying something), the GEW team descended upon the town with gadgets that beeped, blinked, and occasionally made alarming buzzing noises. Their arrival stirred up a social whirlwind that saw the revival of the sun and moon pies, and even inspired Mrs. Wembly to debut a new hat, this one simulating the phases of the moon with LEDs. Percival, in his humble way, became the town’s envoy to the world of science. With a blend of awe and a dash of pride, he showed Dr. Foss and her team the remnants of the Eclipse Emulator™. Expecting skepticism, or perhaps a polite disinterest, Percival was shocked when Dr. Foss's eyes lit up with a brilliance that rivaled the faux-eclipse itself. \\"You've stumbled upon something quite remarkable,\\" she told him, her gaze flicking between the contraption and her tablet, where data streamed in real-time. \\"Your Emulator, while not capable of eclipsing the sun, has inadvertently created a unique spectrum of light. One that mimics conditions we believed were exclusive to certain star systems.\\" The townsfolk, gathered to witness this meeting of minds, exchanged glances that spanned the gamut from bafflement to excitement. Percival, unsure whether to apologize or bow, settled for a sheepish grin. \\"It was supposed to be for the eclipse,\\" he admitted. \\"I didn't mean to mimic any star systems.\\" Dr. Foss, however, was not deterred. If anything, she seemed more energized. \\"This could have significant implications for our understanding of celestial phenomena. Mr. Pettigrew, with your permission, we'd like to study your Emulator. Who knows? It might just help us unlock new secrets of the universe.\\" The agreement was struck with handshakes that felt, to Percival, like sealing a pact with the future itself. Doodledum buzzed with excitement as the GEW set up their equipment, turning the town square into a makeshift laboratory. Weeks turned into months, and the town found itself adapting to its newfound status as a scientific point of interest. Percival, for his part, found a kindred spirit in Dr. Foss, their discussions blending science and imagination in a way that enriched both. The twist, however, came not from the stars, but from the heart. As the study concluded, Dr. Foss prepared to leave, her findings documented, her equipment packed. The town threw a farewell party that would be talked about for generations—the Eclipse Emulator sat, silent now, as a monument to curiosity. \\"I'll miss this,\\" Dr. Foss confessed to Percival under the starlit sky. \\"Not just the science, but the people. You've shown me that wonder isn't just out there,\\" she gestured to the heavens, \\"but here, among us.\\" Percival, ever the philosopher in his own right, nodded. \\"Maybe that's the real discovery. Not what's above, but what lies between.\\" As Dr. Foss's car disappeared down the road the next morning, Doodledum returned to its normal rhythm. Yet something had shifted, imperceptibly but irrevocably. The town wasn't just a quaint spot on the map, but a beacon of wonder, where the universe had winked back, and life had found new mysteries to unravel. Percival Pettigrew stood outside his cottage, a new blueprint unrolling on his table. The Emulator, version 2.0, promised not just an artificial eclipse but a bridge between the cosmic and the communal. The sky, vast and unknowable, seemed a little closer, a little more like home. And as for the surprise twist? Let's just say that when the next natural eclipse graced the skies, Doodledum didn't just watch. With Percival's Emulator 2.0, they reached out, touching the fabric of the cosmos in a dance of light and shadow. The GEW, now a constant presence, watched in amazement as science and wonder melded in the hands of a man whose vision had eclipsed even their wildest dreams.

While it's challenging to provide an exhaustive list of all types of places that exclusively allow contactless payments while disallowing chip (EMV) or magnetic stripe transactions (i.e., inserting or swiping the card), I can highlight sectors and specific types of establishments where you're more likely to encounter a \\"contactless preferred\\" or \\"contactless only\\" policy. These preferences can vary widely depending on the country, city, and even within the same type of establishment, so it's essential to always have an alternative payment method. # 1. Public Transport Systems Many city and regional public transport systems across Europe, including buses, trams, and local trains, have adopted contactless payment options for convenience and speed. This includes: - Metro systems like those in London (Oyster and contactless) and Paris (Navigo Easy system). - Local city buses and regional trains that offer tap-on/tap-off payment systems. # 2. Small Retail and Quick Service Establishments - Coffee shops and fast-food chains are likely to prioritize contactless payments to speed up transactions. - Small kiosks, bakeries, and convenience stores, especially in high-traffic areas. # 3. Tourist Attractions - Museums, galleries, and landmarks often encourage contactless payments for tickets to streamline entry. - Public locker services at attractions or transport hubs. # 4. Events and Festivals - Music festivals, food fairs, and seasonal markets may opt for contactless payments for all transactions to reduce cash handling and queues. # 5. Vending Machines - Modern vending machines for snacks, drinks, and even electronic items increasingly support contactless payments. # 6. Parking - Street parking meters and some parking garages allow contactless payments for convenience. # Restrictions and Considerations - Despite the growing prevalence of contactless payments, regulations in some European countries ensure that merchants cannot outright refuse chip and PIN transactions if the card supports it. However, practical circumstances (such as a malfunctioning chip reader) might result in a preference for contactless. - Some establishments might prefer contactless payments to a point but can still process chip and PIN transactions if necessary. It's crucial to note that this situation is fluid, and the adoption rates and policies can change. Travelers should always be prepared with multiple forms of payment, including contactless cards, mobile payment options (like Apple Pay or Google Wallet), and some amount of cash, to avoid any inconvenience."},{"instruction":"Is it common for kiosk to diable chip and PIN patients and allow only contactless ones?","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, it is relatively uncommon for kiosks to disable chip and PIN payments entirely in favor of exclusively accepting contactless payments, though the prevalence of contactless technology is indeed on the rise globally, including in Europe. The shift towards contactless is driven by the convenience, speed, and hygienic advantages it offers, which became particularly attractive during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most payment systems are designed to accommodate a wide range of payment methods to ensure that as many customers as possible can complete transactions smoothly. Here are some pertinent points to consider regarding the adoption of contactless payments in kiosks and other points of sale: 1. **Regulations and Customer Flexibility:** In many places, regulations and a desire to accommodate customers' preferences encourage merchants, including kiosks, to accept a variety of payment methods. Limiting payments strictly to contactless could exclude customers who do not have access to contactless-enabled cards or mobile payments, which is not ideal from a business perspective. 2. **Technology Adoption:** While many new payment terminals support both contactless and chip (EMV) transactions, the decision to disable one form of payment over another is typically dictated by business needs, customer behavior, and sometimes technological limitations. For example, a vending machine or small kiosk in a location with a high volume of transactions and a need for quick throughput might favor contactless payments to reduce transaction times and queues. 3. **Hardware and Software Limitations:** In some cases, a kiosk might experience hardware or software issues that temporarily limit its ability to process chip and PIN transactions, leaving contactless as the only available option. However, this would usually be seen as a fault to be repaired rather than a permanent condition. 4. **Security Perspectives:** Both contactless and chip and PIN payments are considered secure, but the transaction limits on contactless payments (wherein larger transactions require PIN entry or another form of verification) serve as a fraud prevention measure. This might influence how businesses view the risk management of different payment types, though it doesn't directly lead to disabling chip and PIN capabilities. In summary, while the prominence of contactless payments continues to grow, the outright disabling of chip and PIN capabilities in favor of exclusively contactless transactions is not common practice. Businesses, including those operating kiosks, generally aim to support a broad array of payment methods to ensure they can cater to all customers effectively. If a kiosk or another point of sale does seem to have disabled chip and PIN payments, it's more likely to be an exception rather than a widespread trend."},{"instruction":"Chromochemical (color-chemistry) classification system of aerosol: 1.

It seems particularly useful in the study of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and other celestial bodies where atmospheric composition can hint at not only the physical conditions but also potential habitability or resource availability. Here's a brief overview of each category in the context of astrophysics and planetary science: 1. **Frigidian**: Characterized by hydrogen clouds, which might indicate extremely cold, gas giant-like conditions, given hydrogen's abundance in such environments. 2. **Methanian**: Dominated by methane clouds, suggesting cooler temperatures; such conditions are common in the outer solar system, e.g., on Titan. 3. **Lilacean**: Involves nitrogen and carbon monoxide, and occasionally oxygen, which could indicate a diverse and potentially reactive atmosphere. 4. **Sulfurian**: Denotes the presence of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, possibly indicative of volcanic activity or a reducing atmosphere. 5. **Ammonian**: Characterized by ammonia clouds, this category could suggest a cold, but chemically active atmosphere, as seen in the outer planets of our solar system. 6. **Waterian**: Dominated by water clouds, relevant for the study of habitable zone exoplanets where liquid water might exist. 7. **Acidian**: Involves sulfuric acid clouds, reminiscent of Venus's harsh, chemically reactive atmosphere. 8. **Navyean**: Indicates a clear or cloudless sky, which could be useful in studying atmospheric composition through spectroscopy. 9. **Siliconelian**: Characterized by siloxane hazes, suggesting an atmosphere rich in silicon compounds, perhaps indicative of unique geology or volcanism. 10. **Alkalian**: Dominated by alkali metal hazes, which might suggest high-temperature atmospheres where metals are vaporized. 11. **Silicatian**: Involves magnesium/iron silicate clouds, indicating atmospheres where silicates could condense, possibly on hot, rocky exoplanets. 12. **Corundian**: Denotes clouds of corundum and calcium oxide, suggesting extremely high temperatures where even refractory compounds can form clouds. 13. **Fuliginian**: Characterized by carbon hazes, indicative of atmospheres rich in carbon or areas with extensive soot or other carbon-based particulate pollution. While this classification represents an intriguing way to understand atmospheres based on observable properties (i.e., color), the actual implementation and usefulness of such a system would greatly depend on detailed spectroscopic data and the ability to accurately characterize these atmospheres from afar. This fictional system offers a structured, though simplified, perspective on the complex reality of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheric science."},{"instruction":"Describe type of gas giant Saturnian, it has permanent frozen clouds","output":"The term \\"Saturnian\\" is not used in the chromochemical classification you provided earlier. However, discussing a gas giant with permanent frozen clouds in the context of known planetary science can still yield a fascinating insight into what such a planet might be like. To conceptualize a gas giant with permanent frozen clouds, like Saturn, we'll draw from existing knowledge about Saturn and other similar bodies within and outside our Solar System: # Characteristics of a Hypothetical Saturnian-Type Gas Giant 1. **Atmosphere Composition**: A planet with permanent frozen clouds likely has an atmosphere rich in compounds that can easily freeze out at the temperatures found in the upper atmosphere. For Saturn, ammonia, methane, and water vapor are key components, alongside hydrogen and helium which constitute the bulk of its atmosphere. Frozen clouds in such a planet could be primarily composed of ammonia or water ice, depending on the temperatures within the various atmospheric layers. 2. **Temperature**: Permanent frozen clouds imply a relatively cold upper atmosphere, where the temperatures are low enough for the atmospheric gases to condense into ice crystals or snow. Saturn itself has an average cloud-top temperature of about -178 degrees Celsius (-288 degrees Fahrenheit). Our hypothetical planet might have similar or even colder atmospheric conditions at the altitudes where clouds form. 3. **Weather Patterns**: Gas giants like Saturn have complicated weather patterns due to their rotating liquid interiors and the convective movements within their atmospheres. Permanent frozen clouds would partake in these dynamic systems, potentially leading to snow storms and icy cloud formations that evolve with the planet's meteorology. 4. **Appearance**: From a distance, a gas giant with permanent frozen clouds would likely show varying shades of white, yellow, and possibly even faint blues or pinks, depending on the exact composition of the frozen clouds and how they scatter sunlight. The appearance of bands and zones, as seen on Jupiter and Saturn, might also be present, indicating differential rotation and atmospheric dynamics. 5. **Location within the Solar System or Galaxy**: To sustain permanent frozen clouds, our hypothetical gas giant would likely be located at a significant distance from its parent star, similar to the location of Saturn or farther out in its solar system. This distance helps ensure that the temperatures remain low enough for clouds to remain in a frozen state. 6. **Potential for Rings and Moons**: Like Saturn, a planet with significant atmosphere and cold conditions might also have an extensive system of rings and moons. These could form from ice particles and other debris captured by the planet's gravitational field. In understanding such a planet, scientists rely on a combination of observations from telescopes, spacecraft missions, and theoretical models to interpret the atmospheric conditions, composition, and weather patterns of distant gas giants. While each gas giant in our Solar System and beyond is unique, categorizing them based on characteristics such as their cloud compositions offers insightful ways to compare and study these massive, distant worlds."},{"instruction":"Describe Fuliginian Saturnian gas giant","output":"Combining the concept of a \\"Fuliginian\\" type from your chromochemical classification system, which involves carbon hazes, with the nature of a \\"Saturnian\\" gas giant, we can create a detailed description of a hypothetical planet. This Fuliginian Saturnian gas giant would be a distinctive type of celestial body, characterized by its deep, complex atmosphere rich in carbon-based molecules, leading to widespread carbon hazes. # Atmosphere and Appearance The atmosphere of a Fuliginian Saturnian gas giant would be thick and laden with carbon compounds, such as hydrocarbons and possibly cyanides, which can give rise to extensive, dark carbon hazes and soots. These carbonaceous materials can absorb a significant amount of light, leading to an atmospheric appearance that is darker and potentially more opaque than less carbon-rich gas giants. The planet's overall coloration might be deep, murky, showing various shades of dark browns, greys, or even black, punctuated by the brighter bands or zones where atmospheric dynamics part the hazes. # Temperature and Cloud Structure The temperature of this planet could play a crucial role in the formation and stability of its fuliginous atmosphere. Depending on the distance from its central star and its internal heat sources, the temperature may allow for carbon compounds to condense or polymerize into complex organics and particulates, contributing to the characteristic carbon haze. Beneath the upper layers of hazes, one might find cloud decks composed of heavier hydrocarbons or even silicates, depending on the depth and temperature. # Weather Patterns Weather on a Fuliginian Saturnian gas giant could be intensely dynamic. Wind speeds in the upper atmosphere, where the carbon hazes dominate, might reach extremely high velocities, distributing carbon particles widely and creating storm systems that are both vast and long-lived. Lightning and other electrostatic phenomena could be more common here due to the friction between different particle sizes of carbon materials, possibly even leading to fires or combustion-like events if oxygenated compounds are also present in small amounts. # Potential for Life and Moons While a Fuliginian gas giant itself would likely not be hospitable to life as we know it, due to extreme conditions and lack of a solid surface, its moon system could be of great interest. If the gas giant has a rich array of moons, some of these bodies might have environments that are more conducive to life, especially if they are located within the habitable zone of the star. The carbon compounds from the planet could also seed these moons with complex organic chemistry, which is of high astrobiological interest. # Observational Signatures From an observational standpoint, a Fuliginian Saturnian gas giant would present unique signatures in its reflected light spectrum, with strong absorption bands indicative of complex organic molecules and carbon compounds. These features would make it a prime target for study in the search for prebiotic chemistry in exoplanetary systems. In sum, a Fuliginian Saturnian gas giant represents a fascinating conceptual intersection of carbon-rich chemistry and the dynamic atmospheric phenomena typical of gas giants. It underscores the diversity of planetary types that could exist in the universe and highlights the potential for complex organic chemistry in planetary atmospheres."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and I am a volunteer at the front desk of the Boca Raton Achievement Center. Before I delve into the heart of my message, I would like to express my gratitude for your inspiring work, particularly in championing education and advocating for children globally. Your endeavors, especially the Let Girls Learn initiative, have not only illuminated pathways for countless individuals but have also served to amplify the voices and potential of those often left in the shadows. The Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC), nestled in the vibrant community of Boca Raton, FL, represents a haven of hope and empowerment for students with autism and related disabilities, aged 11-22+. Pioneering an innovative, tailored educational approach, BRAC not only addresses academic competencies but lays a strong foundation in life skills, vocational training, health and fitness, and independent living, thus mirroring the holistic vision you have consistently advocated for. Our mission, deeply aligned with your values, is to foster an environment of support, consistency, kindness, and inclusion, enabling every student to discover and journey towards their full potential. My personal journey to BRAC, marked by its share of adversity and resilience, significantly shapes my appeal to you today. Diagnosed with Asperger’s at an early age, the pursuit of a 'normal' life seemed a distant reality. However, the tragic loss of both my parents within a span of nine days in October 2023 tested my resolve like never before. Amidst navigating this profound grief, the unwavering support from individuals like the BRAC’s Executive Director, Evelyn Falconer, has been instrumental in reigniting my conviction to not merely survive but to thrive and make a meaningful difference. Your visit to BRAC would resonate deeply within our community, serving as a towering beacon of hope and inspiration. The opportunity for our students to engage with a figure of your stature, who embodies the essence of perseverance in the face of adversity and the power of education to transform lives, would be an unparalleled source of encouragement. It would significantly underscore the message that their dreams are valid, attainable, and worth the pursuit. Moreover, your presence would dramatically amplify our mission, attracting much-needed attention and support towards advancing the cause of education and inclusion for individuals with disabilities. It would honor us to share more about our vision, achievements, and the remarkable stories of growth and transformation unfolding within our walls. Evelyn Falconer, the Executive Director, would be delighted to discuss how your visit could inspire our students and community.

Like the aforementioned individuals, Malala is a beacon of hope, advocating for education and the rights of women and girls around the globe. Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel Prize laureate, is known for her activism against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education. Despite facing life-threatening opposition, her resolve only strengthened, leading her to become an influential voice on the international stage. Writing to her could not only resonate with her personal mission but also potentially align with her interests and initiatives through the Malala Fund, which aims to give every girl an opportunity to achieve a future she chooses. In your letter to Malala, similar themes of overcoming adversity, the transformative power of education, and a commitment to public service could be highlighted. Sharing personal stories or the experiences of those at the Boca Raton Achievement Center, much like it was suggested for Michelle Obama, and inviting her to witness this firsthand or lend her voice to advocate for the center's cause could be impactful.

You’re about to find out with GameScent, an unusual AI-powered device that releases scents while you’re playing. It provides maximum immersion that “attacks” your nose so you can feel like a true adventurer or a soldier. GameScent will also provide a forest smell (which is what the device chose before Garfield ate it (because he is a cartoon cat). GameScent is available on Amazon and Best Buy for 150 at the moment. (Note: GameScent is a real product you can buy. Do not consume.) [[Original strip: 2004-02-07.]]","output":"This modified Garfield comic satirically explores the theme of technological advancement and how it intersects with our daily lives, even in comedic or absurd ways. In the original strip, the joke centers on Garfield's bad breath being attributed to \\"Kitty Tuna Mints,\\" a humorous take on products designed to solve minor inconveniences (in this case, a cat's bad breath) with unnecessarily specific solutions. The modified version shifts the focus from a relatively mundane product to a fictional, high-concept device called GameScent. This device, claimed to be \\"AI-powered,\\" purports to enhance video game immersion by releasing scents related to the game environment. For instance, when playing a video game like \\"Kena: Bridge of Spirits,\\" which features rich natural environments, GameScent would emit forest smells to deepen the player's immersion into the game's world. Garfield's dialogue in the modified comic humorously misinterprets Jon's displeasure at the forest-like scent of his breath as a compliment, and he credits this peculiar scent to his interaction with \\"Kena: Bridge of Spirits\\" through the supposed GameScent device. The added layer of absurdity comes from imagining that Garfield, a cartoon cat, would use such a sophisticated gadget for a more immersive gaming experience, only to nonchalantly mention it as the cause of his scented breath. The footnote adds another layer of satire by presenting GameScent as a real product available for purchase, even advising against consuming it – a playful nod to how absurdly specific and unnecessary some technological products can seem, and the equally absurd possibility of misunderstanding their use or function. This comment also indirectly pokes fun at how consumer technology is marketed and the sometimes-ridiculous lengths to which products are developed and promoted for seemingly trivial or niche applications. Overall, the modified comic uses the exaggeration of technological advancement and its implications for daily life, like turning a cat's breath forest-scented, for comedic effect. It reflects on our society's fascination with and skepticism of rapid technological progress, particularly in the consumer electronics sector, through the lens of humor."},{"instruction":"is this sql query correct?

Double quotes (\`\\"\`) are typically used to denote identifiers (like column and table names), not string values. Here is a revised version with single quotes: \`\`\`sql SELECT total, customer_id FROM invoice WHERE (billing_city = 'Dublin' OR billing_city = 'London' OR billing_city = 'Paris') AND total >= 5 AND (customer_id = 40 OR customer_id = 46); \`\`\` The revised version uses single quotes for string literals such as \`'Dublin'\`, \`'London'\`, and \`'Paris'\`.

SELECT title FROM movie WHERE rental_rate <= 2 AND rental_duration < 6 AND (rating = 'PG' OR rating = 'PG-13');","output":"Yes, the parentheses do make a significant difference in SQL queries, including the one you've provided. Let's break it down to understand this better. SQL queries follow certain logical order of operations, similar to how arithmetic operations do (remember the BODMAS/BIDMAS rule from math?). In SQL, when you have a combination of \`AND\` and \`OR\` conditions without any parentheses, the \`AND\` conditions get evaluated first before the \`OR\` conditions due to their higher precedence. This can significantly alter the results of your query if you're not careful about grouping your conditions correctly with parentheses. Your Query: \`\`\`sql SELECT title FROM movie WHERE rental_rate <= 2 AND rental_duration < 6 AND (rating = 'PG' OR rating = 'PG-13'); \`\`\` Here, you're selecting titles from the \`movie\` table with three main conditions: 1. The \`rental_rate\` must be less than or equal to 2. 2. The \`rental_duration\` must be less than 6. 3. The movie's \`rating\` must be either 'PG' or 'PG-13'. The parentheses around the \`rating\` conditions are crucial because they group the \`OR\` condition together as one logical unit. This means that the movie must meet both of the first two conditions (\`rental_rate\` and \`rental_duration\`), and additionally, it should satisfy at least one of the conditions within the parentheses (the \`rating\` being 'PG' or 'PG-13'). Without the parentheses: If you were to remove the parentheses, the query logic would change due to the default precedence of \`AND\` over \`OR\`. Without parentheses, the database might interpret the conditions in a different order that doesn't match your original intent, leading to incorrect results. Simple Analogy: Think of it as making a sandwich where you have to: - Use either white or whole grain bread (condition A or B), - And must use a topping that's either peanut butter or jelly (condition C or D). If you don't clearly group your choices with parentheses, you might end up with a combination that doesn't make sense (like trying to apply both peanut butter and jelly before choosing the type of bread). Thus, in SQL, just as in making precise choices in a recipe, parentheses help ensure the conditions are evaluated the way you intend, grouping them into logical sets that must be fulfilled together."},{"instruction":"is this code correct with this task: Из таблицы movie выгрузите названия фильмов, стоимость аренды которых не превышает двух долларов, а срок аренды составляет больше шести дней.

Here is how the SQL query should be structured to meet your specifications: \`\`\`sql SELECT title FROM movie WHERE rental_rate <= 2 AND rental_duration > 6 AND rating NOT IN ('PG', 'PG-13'); \`\`\` Key Points about this query: 1. **Rental Rate Condition**: \`rental_rate <= 2\` ensures you're selecting movies with a rental cost of no more than two dollars. 2. **Rental Duration Condition**: \`rental_duration > 6\` ensures you're selecting movies that can be rented for more than six days. 3. **Rating Condition**: \`rating NOT IN ('PG', 'PG-13')\` ensures the selected movies do not have a 'PG' or 'PG-13' rating. The \`NOT IN\` clause is used here to exclude movies with those specific ratings, aligning with your task's requirement to exclude films with 'PG' and 'PG-13' ratings. Thus, the provided SQL query accurately matches the task requirements by selecting movie titles that meet the specified conditions regarding rental rate, rental duration, and exclusions based on movie ratings."},{"instruction":"can't i use AND NOT rating = ‘PG’ OR NOT rating = ‘PG-13’);","output":"You can use \`AND NOT\` and \`OR NOT\` in your conditions, but you need to use them carefully to ensure you're achieving the correct logic for your query. Based on the task you've described, if you try to use \`AND NOT\` directly followed by \`OR NOT\`, without appropriate parenthesis, you may not get the results you're expecting due to the way SQL evaluates logical operators. Here's how your proposed conditions might look and why they might not work as expected: \`\`\`sql SELECT title FROM movie WHERE rental_rate <= 2 AND rental_duration > 6 AND NOT rating = 'PG' OR NOT rating = 'PG-13'; \`\`\` This query could lead to unexpected results because of the way logical \`AND\` and \`OR\` conditions are processed. Remember, \`AND\` operations are evaluated before \`OR\` operations. Without proper grouping, the condition could unintentionally include movies rated 'PG-13' if they meet all other conditions, or exclude movies not meeting the rental rate/duration conditions but not rated 'PG-13', which is not what you want. To correctly use \`AND NOT\` and \`OR NOT\` in your scenario, you would encapsulate the rating conditions together within parentheses to ensure they are evaluated as a single logical group. However, it's typically more straightforward and readable to use \`NOT IN\` for your particular task, as previously suggested. If you prefer using \`AND NOT\` and \`OR NOT\`, here's how you should properly structure it to get the intended results: \`\`\`sql SELECT title FROM movie WHERE rental_rate <= 2 AND rental_duration > 6 AND (NOT rating = 'PG' AND NOT rating = 'PG-13'); \`\`\` Or equivalently, using \`!=\` operator: \`\`\`sql SELECT title FROM movie WHERE rental_rate <= 2 AND rental_duration > 6 AND (rating != 'PG' AND rating != 'PG-13'); \`\`\` Both of these queries ensure that the \`rating\` conditions are evaluated together as one logical condition, excluding movies with ratings of 'PG' or 'PG-13', while also meeting your rental rate and duration criteria. This way, you keep the logical grouping clear and maintain the correct precedence of operations."},{"instruction":"what is the sql for september 2009","output":"If you're looking to write an SQL query to select records from a table for the month of September in the year 2009, you typically need to work with a date or timestamp column in your table. Let's assume your table has a column named \`date_column\` (you should replace \`date_column\` with the actual name of your date or timestamp column) and the table's name is \`your_table\` (replace \`your_table\` with the actual table name). Here's how you can structure your SQL query: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE DATE_FORMAT(date_column, '%Y-%m') = '2009-09'; \`\`\` The \`DATE_FORMAT()\` function in the above query is used in MySQL to format the date or timestamp into a specific format, in this case, 'Year-Month'. Then it compares the resulting string with \`'2009-09'\` to select records from September 2009. Note that \`DATE_FORMAT()\` is specific to MySQL. If you're using another database management system (DBMS), the function and format might be different. For PostgreSQL, you might use the \`TO_CHAR()\` function: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE TO_CHAR(date_column, 'YYYY-MM') = '2009-09'; \`\`\` For SQL Server, you could use \`FORMAT()\`: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE FORMAT(date_column, 'yyyy-MM') = '2009-09'; \`\`\` You should replace \`date_column\` and \`your_table\` with the actual column and table names you're working with. These queries assume you want all records ('*') from September 2009. You can replace '*' with specific column names if you're only interested in specific fields. Remember: - Double-check the date formatting functions and string formats as they might vary between different SQL dialects. - If time zones or time parts of the timestamps could affect your query results, consider how you might need to adjust the query to account for those aspects."},{"instruction":"is this correct?

So \`'YYYY-MM'\` is the correct format string to use for getting the year and month from a date. 2. **Syntax Error Before the AND**: The semicolon (\`;\`) indicates the end of a query. It was incorrectly placed in your where clause before the \`AND\`. In SQL, you only put the semicolon at the very end of your entire query statement, not within or between conditions in the \`WHERE\` clause. 3. **Logical Condition Simplification**: Your use of parentheses around the condition checking for \`billing_country\` is correct but not strictly necessary in this case since all conditions are joined by \`AND\`. It was a good attempt to make it clear, though! If you wanted to maintain the logical grouping for clarity (or in more complex queries where it can affect logical evaluation), you can, but know it's not needed here. 4. **Database-Specific Function**: Remember that \`TO_CHAR\` is specific to certain databases like PostgreSQL. If you're using another database system, you'll need the equivalent function for that system. This corrected query selects \`billing_address\` and \`billing_city\` from the \`invoice\` table for invoices dated in September 2009 (\`'2009-09'\`), where the \`billing_country\` is neither the USA nor Brazil, and the \`order_price\` is more than 2."},{"instruction":"SELECT billing_address, billing_city FROM invoice WHERE TO_CHAR (invoice_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2009-09' AND (billing_country != 'USA' AND billing_country != 'Brazil') AND order_price > 2;","output":"Yes, your corrected SQL query is syntactically correct now.

Select the \`billing_address\` and \`billing_city\` columns from the \`invoice\` table. 2. Filter the records to include only those where the \`invoice_date\` falls within September 2009.

Include only those records where the \`order_price\` is greater than 2. Your approach to filtering based on the billing country by using \`AND\` and the unequal (\`!=\`) operator for both 'USA' and 'Brazil' is correct. It will effectively exclude records with those billing countries. Remember, the specific function used for date formatting (\`TO_CHAR\`) and the format string \`'YYYY-MM'\` imply that this query is tailored for PostgreSQL. If you're using a different SQL database system, you'll need to adjust the date formatting function and possibly other syntax to suit that system's requirements."},{"instruction":"my sql says function to_char(character varying, unknown) does not exist","output":"The error message you received suggests that the \`TO_CHAR\` function is being called with arguments that do not match any of its existing signatures in your database system. This usually happens due to one or more of the following reasons: 1. **Data Type Mismatch**: The \`TO_CHAR\` function is designed to convert numbers or dates/datetime values to text, but the column you're applying it to (\`invoice_date\`) may not be of a date, timestamp, or number data type. Instead, it might already be a string (\`character varying\`), or there's a confusion by the database about the data type it's interpreting from your query. 2. **Function Availability**: If you're not using PostgreSQL (where \`TO_CHAR\` is a well-supported function for date and number formatting), this function may not exist or might have a different syntax or name in your SQL database system. # Troubleshooting and Solutions 1. **Verify Data Type**: Make sure \`invoice_date\` is indeed of a date, datetime, or timestamp data type. You can find this out by checking the table structure in your database documentation or using a query to inspect the schema, depending on your database system. 2. **Correct Use of \`TO_CHAR\` for PostgreSQL**: - If your database is PostgreSQL, and \`invoice_date\` is definitely a date or timestamp type, the syntax should technically be correct. Consider checking for any subtle syntax issues or ensuring your PostgreSQL version supports this use. - If \`invoice_date\` turned out to be a string that looks like a date, you wouldn't use \`TO_CHAR\`; instead, you'd directly match the string (although this practice is not ideal for date handling). 3. **Alternative Approach for Other Databases**: - **MySQL/MariaDB**: Use \`DATE_FORMAT(invoice_date, '%Y-%m') = '2009-09'\`. - **SQL Server**: Use \`FORMAT(invoice_date, 'yyyy-MM') = '2009-09'\`. - **SQLite**: Use \`strftime('%Y-%m', invoice_date) = '2009-09'\`. 4. **Casting or Conversion**: - If \`invoice_date\` is indeed a textual type and contains standardized date information, in PostgreSQL, you might need to cast it back to a date or timestamp before formatting it: \`TO_CHAR(invoice_date::DATE, 'YYYY-MM') = '2009-09'\` or for timestamp \`TO_CHAR(invoice_date::TIMESTAMP, 'YYYY-MM') = '2009-09'\`. 5. **Consult Documentation**: Database documentation is an invaluable resource for understanding the specific functions and capabilities of your SQL dialect, their correct syntax, and how data types are handled. 6. **Error in Original Query**: If there was a typographical error or misunderstanding in the original description, correcting it according to the database's expected syntax and data type handling should resolve the issue. In summary, ensure the data type of \`invoice_date\` matches what's expected for formatting functions, adjust the query to match the capabilities and syntax of your specific database system, and utilize any casting or conversion as necessary to align data types for successful query execution."},{"instruction":"how do i query invoice_date to see the date format","output":"To view the format or data type of the \`invoice_date\` column in your database and get an idea of how the dates are stored, you have a few options depending on what exactly you're looking to achieve and the SQL database management system (DBMS) you are using. Below are some general strategies: # 1. Inspecting the Table Schema Most SQL databases allow you to query the schema information to find out details about table structures, including the data type of each column. **PostgreSQL**: \`\`\`sql SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'invoice' AND column_name = 'invoice_date'; \`\`\` **MySQL/MariaDB**: \`\`\`sql DESCRIBE invoice invoice_date; \`\`\` Or \`\`\`sql SHOW COLUMNS FROM invoice LIKE 'invoice_date'; \`\`\` **SQL Server**: \`\`\`sql SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'invoice' AND COLUMN_NAME = 'invoice_date'; \`\`\` These queries will show you the data type of the \`invoice_date\` column but not the \\"format\\" per se, as dates are not stored in a specific format like 'YYYY-MM-DD' in the database; they are stored in an internal format that the DBMS understands and can efficiently index, query, and manipulate. The \\"format\\" you see in applications or when querying the database is just a representation of this internal date value. # 2. Querying Data with Formats If you want to see how the date looks when you retrieve it from the database (which could be considered its \\"format\\"), you can simply select the data directly: \`\`\`sql SELECT invoice_date FROM invoice LIMIT 10; \`\`\` This will show you the first 10 \`invoice_date\` values as they are represented by default in your SQL client or application, which might vary based on client settings or database defaults. For databases like PostgreSQL that support the \`TO_CHAR()\` function for formatting dates and times, you can use a SQL query to display dates in a specific format: \`\`\`sql SELECT TO_CHAR(invoice_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as formatted_date FROM invoice LIMIT 10; \`\`\` This query will show you the first 10 dates in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, regardless of how the dates are stored internally. # 3. Consult the Documentation Each DBMS has documentation regarding how it handles dates and times, including the internal storage and default output formatting. Consulting the documentation for your specific DBMS will provide detailed information about date and time types and functions available for working with these types. Remember, the actual storage of date and time values is different from their textual representation or \\"format.\\" When you query or input dates, the database or your SQL client might automatically convert between these internal representations and more human-readable formats."},{"instruction":"Чтобы корректно сравнивать даты в условии, приведите поле invoice_date к типу date. Использовать оператор CAST можно и после WHERE.","output":"Для приведения поля \`invoice_date\` к типу дата в SQL запросе, вы можете использовать оператор \`CAST\`. Это действительно может быть особенно полезно, если изначально поле \`invoice_date\` записано в типе, отличном от даты (например, строка или timestamp), и вам нужно провести сравнение по датам. Вот пример использования \`CAST\` после оператора \`WHERE\` для сравнения данных: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM invoice WHERE CAST(invoice_date AS DATE) = '2009-09-01'; \`\`\` Этот запрос выберет все записи из таблицы \`invoice\`, где дата \`invoice_date\` равна 1-му сентября 2009 года. Здесь мы привели \`invoice_date\` к типу \`DATE\` для корректного сравнения. Если же ваша задача заключается в выборке записей за весь месяц сентябрь 2009 года, используя предполагаемую коррекцию с вашего предыдущего запроса, она может выглядеть следующим образом: \`\`\`sql SELECT billing_address, billing_city FROM invoice WHERE CAST(invoice_date AS DATE) BETWEEN '2009-09-01' AND '2009-09-30' AND billing_country NOT IN ('USA', 'Brazil') AND order_price > 2; \`\`\` В этом примере мы используем оператор \`BETWEEN\` для выборки записей с \`invoice_date\` в диапазоне от 1-го до 30-го сентября 2009 года включительно. Обратите внимание, что точный формат даты (например, 'YYYY-MM-DD') и использование операторов (вроде \`CAST\`) может зависеть от СУБД, с которой вы работаете. Такие функции как \`CAST\` и форматирование дат поддерживаются многими СУБД, но конкретные детали синтаксиса могут отличаться."},{"instruction":"is this correct?

However, casting \`invoice_date\` to a \`DATE\` type and then comparing it to a partial date ('year-month') won't work as intended in most SQL databases. The \`CAST(invoice_date AS DATE)\` operation produces a full date (year-month-day), and it's incorrect to directly compare this full date to a 'YYYY-MM' format string. To correctly filter records from September 2009, consider using a range comparison that spans from the start of September 1, 2009, to the end of September 30, 2009. Alternatively, if your SQL dialect supports functions that extract year and month parts from a date (like \`EXTRACT\` in PostgreSQL, or \`YEAR()\` and \`MONTH()\` in MySQL), you can use those. # Correcting the Query Here are corrected versions of the query for some popular SQL dialects: **PostgreSQL (using \`EXTRACT\`):** \`\`\`sql SELECT billing_address, billing_city FROM invoice WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM invoice_date) = 2009 AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM invoice_date) = 9 AND billing_country NOT IN ('USA', 'Brazil') AND order_price > 2; \`\`\` **MySQL (using \`YEAR()\` and \`MONTH()\`):** \`\`\`sql SELECT billing_address, billing_city FROM invoice WHERE YEAR(invoice_date) = 2009 AND MONTH(invoice_date) = 9 AND billing_country NOT IN ('USA', 'Brazil') AND order_price > 2; \`\`\` **SQL Server (using \`YEAR()\` and \`MONTH()\`):** \`\`\`sql SELECT billing_address, billing_city FROM invoice WHERE YEAR(invoice_date) = 2009 AND MONTH(invoice_date) = 9 AND billing_country NOT IN ('USA', 'Brazil') AND order_price > 2; \`\`\` These methods specifically check for the \`YEAR\` and \`MONTH\` parts of \`invoice_date\`, ensuring accurate selection of records from September 2009, while also excluding records from the USA or Brazil and ensuring \`order_price\` is greater than 2. The approach you take (using \`EXTRACT\`, \`YEAR()\`, \`MONTH()\`, or a range comparison) depends on the SQL dialect you're working with.

However, it's important to note that the specific categories and color codes you've provided, while they offer a creative way to categorize atmospheric compositions, might not have a direct one-to-one match with existing scientific classifications or terminologies. Here’s a brief overview of each category according to the details provided: 1. **Frigidian**: Dominated by hydrogen clouds, suggesting an atmosphere similar to gas giants, with a very pale blue color. 2. **Methanian**: Comprised mainly of methane clouds, which would impart a light blue color to the atmosphere, analogous to Neptune or Uranus. 3. **Lilacean**: Characterized by clouds of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and occasionally oxygen, suggesting a very light, almost ethereal atmospheric appearance. 4. **Sulfurian**: Contains hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, which would give the atmosphere a yellowish to cream color, similar to the appearance of some regions on Io, one of Jupiter’s moons. 5. **Ammonian**: Dominated by ammonia, but with hazes of tholin and phosphorus adding complexity to the coloration, from light cream to deeper tans and browns. 6. **Waterian**: Simply water clouds, suggesting a pure white color indicative of a water-rich atmosphere or an Earth-like planet. 7. **Acidian**: Features sulfuric acid clouds, like those in the atmosphere of Venus, reflected in a very pale yellowish tint. 8. **Navyean**: Describes a cloudless atmosphere, implying clear skies with a deeper blue characteristic, perhaps due to the scattering of light in a dense atmosphere. 9. **Siliconelian**: Dominated by siloxane hazes, which would give it a grayish tan appearance, possibly simulating atmospheres rich in silicon compounds. 10. **Alkalian**: Characterized by alkali metal hazes, suggesting a dark, smoky atmosphere with hints of brown or deep gray, reminiscent of high-temperature exoplanet atmospheres where such metals could be vaporized. 11. **Silicatian**: Features clouds of magnesium and iron silicate, leading to greenish-gray to bluish-gray colors, indicative of atmospheres with silicate vapor. 12. **Corundian**: Composed of clouds of corundum (aluminum oxide) and calcium oxide, leading to a range of warm colors from golden to reddish, offering a unique look potentially found in very hot exoplanet atmospheres. 13. **Fuliginian**: Dominated by carbon hazes, which would give the atmosphere an almost black appearance, similar to the very thick, soot-like hazes that might be found in heavily polluted atmospheres or extremely cold environments where complex organic molecules dominate. This imaginative classification neatly encapsulates a wide range of atmospheric compositions and conditions that could be encountered, whether in our solar system or when observing exoplanets. It emphasizes the diversity and complexity of planetary atmospheres beyond the main constituents typically focused on, like hydrogen, helium, water, methane, and ammonia."},{"instruction":"Describe type of gas giant called Saturnian, it has permanent frozen clouds that never raining","output":"In the context of the planetary classification provided, a \\"Saturnian\\" type of gas giant isn't explicitly mentioned. However, based on your description of a gas giant with permanent frozen clouds that never experience rainfall, we can speculate about its characteristics by drawing on our understanding of gas giants and atmospheric science. **Characteristics of a \\"Saturnian\\" Gas Giant:** 1. **Atmospheric Composition**: A \\"Saturnian\\" gas giant would likely have an atmosphere dominated by hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter and Saturn in our own solar system. However, the presence of permanent frozen clouds suggests that it also contains a significant amount of volatiles such as water, ammonia, and possibly methane, which can freeze in the upper atmosphere to create ice clouds. 2. **Temperature and Pressure Conditions**: For clouds to remain permanently frozen, the gas giant would have to be extremely cold, likely situated far from its star or in a system with a relatively dim star. This would mean that temperatures in the upper atmosphere are consistently low enough for volatiles to remain in a solid state. The pressure at these upper atmospheric levels might not be sufficient to cause phase changes that would lead to rainfall as we understand it on Earth. 3. **Upper Atmosphere Dynamics**: The dynamics of the upper atmosphere would be influenced by the planet's rotation and the composition of its frozen clouds. Without rainfall, the weather systems would be dominated by high-speed winds and storms, much like those observed on Jupiter and Saturn, but potentially with different visual characteristics due to the unique cloud compositions. 4. **Magnetosphere and Radiation Belts**: Like Saturn, this type of gas giant could have a significant magnetic field, resulting in impressive radiation belts. The interaction between the magnetosphere and the solar wind could lead to auroras at the magnetic poles, potentially visible through gaps in the frozen cloud layers. 5. **Ring System and Moons**: Following Saturn's example, a \\"Saturnian\\" gas giant might possess a complex ring system composed of ice particles, rock, and dust. This ring system could be the result of tidal disruptions of moons or comets, or the accumulation of material from the surrounding space. Additionally, a retinue of moons, ranging from small ice bodies to potentially habitable larger moons, could orbit this gas giant, contributing to its complexity and beauty. 6. **Scientific Interest**: Such a planet would be of particular interest to astronomers and planetary scientists, offering insights into atmospheric chemistry, planetary formation, and the conditions necessary for the development of stable, frozen clouds without precipitation. Observations and studies could contribute greatly to our understanding of planetary atmospheres and the diverse conditions present in extrasolar systems. A \\"Saturnian\\" gas giant represents a compelling and fascinating type of world within the broader category of gas giants, showcasing the incredible diversity of planetary phenomena possible in our universe."},{"instruction":"Describe ejected hot Jupiter with Sudarsky class V named Dersore, it becomes Corundian-Saturnian.","output":"The description you've provided combines several intriguing aspects of exoplanetary science and theoretical models to describe a unique world named Dersore. Let's unpack the scenario and characteristics of this ejected \\"hot Jupiter\\" that transitions into a Corundian-Saturnian class, according to the parameters and classes previously discussed. # Original State: Ejected Hot Jupiter with Sudarsky Class V - **Hot Jupiter**: Initially, Dersore would have been a hot Jupiter, a class of gas giants that orbit very close to their parent stars. These planets are characterized by their high temperatures due to their proximity to their star. - **Ejection**: Dersore being \\"ejected\\" suggests a violent past, possibly involving gravitational interactions with other planets or a binary star system that resulted in Dersore being thrown out of its original orbit. This ejection would drastically change its environmental conditions, most notably moving it away from the heat source (its star) and exposing it to the cold of deep space. - **Sudarsky Class V**: In the Sudarsky classification system for gas giant atmospheres, Class V planets are characterized by silicate clouds in their atmospheres, which could produce reflective, glowing appearances due to their high temperatures. Given that Dersore was a hot Jupiter, it might have shown a brilliant, possibly variable appearance due to the dynamics of its upper atmosphere. # Transition: Becoming a Corundian-Saturnian After its ejection and as Dersore travels through interstellar space, it undergoes significant changes. - **Cooling Down**: Away from the warmth of a star, Dersore's surface and atmospheric temperatures plummet. This drastic cooling would lead to significant changes in its atmospheric chemistry and appearance. - **Corundian**: The term \\"Corundian\\" as previously defined suggests an atmosphere with clouds composed of corundum (aluminum oxide) and perhaps calcium oxide, indicating a transition towards high-temperature compounds condensing into clouds or hazes. Despite the overall decrease in temperature from its hot Jupiter phase, the remnants of high-temperature chemistry might remain visible in the composition of its upper atmosphere. - **Saturnian Characteristics**: Developing \\"Saturnian\\" characteristics implies the formation of permanent frozen clouds that never precipitate as rain, likely due to the coldness of deep space. Dersore's atmosphere now possibly resembles a colder, ice-giant-like state with layers of frozen volatiles. Given the prior mention of Corundian aspects, these two descriptions combined suggest a unique atmospheric composition where high-temperature condensate clouds coexist with or lie underneath layers of frozen volatiles, creating a unique stratification. # Conclusion Dersore, in its new Corundian-Saturnian phase, represents a theoretical yet fascinating case study of exoplanetary evolution. After being ejected from its star system, it transitions from a glowing hot Jupiter to a wandering gas giant shrouded in layers of frozen and high-temperature condensate clouds, drifting through the galaxy. Its study would provide invaluable insights into atmospheric dynamics under extreme conditions, planetary system evolution, and the survivability of different atmospheric components when a planet is removed from the warming influence of its star."},{"instruction":"woman's face, pablo picasso, cubism, vibrant colors","output":"Pablo Picasso, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, is renowned for his role in developing Cubism, an avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture. Picasso's exploration of Cubism is perhaps best exemplified in his depictions of the human figure, and particularly in his portrayals of women's faces. These works are characterized by fragmented forms, geometric shapes, and a departure from traditional perspectives, aiming to represent the subject from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. In his cubist portrayals of women's faces, Picasso often employed vibrant colors, a deviation from the monochromatic palette seen in his earlier Analytic Cubism phase. This transition to more vivid colors marks his movement towards Synthetic Cubism, where color becomes an essential element, adding depth, emotion, and expressiveness to the compositions. One notable example of Picasso's work that features a woman's face in the Cubist style with vibrant colors is \\"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\\" (1907). Although this painting is considered a precursor to Cubism, it introduces many elements that would define the movement. The work depicts five nude female prostitutes from a brothel on Avignon Street in Barcelona. The figures are rendered in a radical style that breaks away from traditional representational art. The women's bodies and facial features are deconstructed into geometric shapes, and the space around them is fractured, suggesting multiple viewpoints. Another significant example is \\"Woman with a Yellow Hat\\" (Jaqueline) from 1961, showcasing Jacqueline Roque, Picasso's muse and second wife. This portrait is a dazzling array of vibrant colors and simplified shapes, demonstrating Picasso's genius in using Cubism to capture the essence and personality of his subject rather than a realistic likeness. Picasso's cubist works, particularly those depicting women's faces, are complex and experimental, reflecting his relentless pursuit of new ways of seeing and representing reality. These pieces not only highlight the distinctive stylistic traits of Cubism but also underscore Picasso's innovative use of color and form to convey deeper emotional and psychological undercurrents. Through these groundbreaking artworks, Picasso invites viewers to engage with the multifaceted human experience, challenging them to perceive the world from an entirely new perspective."},{"instruction":"woman's face, pablo picasso, cubism, vibrant colors, realistic, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Vibrant Cubist Woman's Face Art by Picasso - Colorful Modern Decor Print"},{"instruction":"What model are you?","output":"I am a model of artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI, known as GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4).

You've created a raw socket with \`socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ALL))\` for sending data, but you're trying to send data to an \`AF_INET\` address (IPv4 Internet protocols), which isn't consistent with the \`AF_PACKET\` family you've set up for the socket. Raw sockets are used to send packets without any transport-layer protocols (e.g., TCP or UDP), which means you have to construct the entire packet yourself, including the IP header and the data payload. However, sending packets at this level requires a deeper understanding of the IP protocol specifics, and you must ensure that the headers (both Ethernet and IP) are correctly crafted. Here are several key points and how you might resolve the issue: 1. **IP Header Attention**: - Ensure the IP header fields are appropriately set. For instance, your calculation of the total length might be off if not correctly accounting for the size of the payloads and headers. This value must include the size of the IP header itself plus the data it carries. - You have set the \`iptop.protocol\` field to 254, which is used for experimentation and testing, according to RFC 3692. Make sure this is intended. 2. **Socket Type and Domain**: - For \`AF_PACKET\`, you are working at the link layer and directly with Ethernet frames. If you want to send IP packets without dealing with the Ethernet frame, you might consider creating a socket with \`AF_INET\` and using raw socket types, but this also requires setting the \`IP_HDRINCL\` option to signify that you're including your IP header. - You've executed \`setsockopt(sockfd, IPPROTO_IP, IP_HDRINCL, &one, sizeof(one));\` intending to include your IP header manually, but your socket was created with \`AF_PACKET\`, which does not align with \`IPPROTO_IP\`. 3. **Destination Address**: - When sending data over \`AF_PACKET\` sockets, you must specify the interface index in the \`sockaddr_ll\` structure you pass to \`sendto()\`. You've used a \`sockaddr_in\` structure, which is for \`AF_INET\` addresses. 4. **Error Checking**: - The return value of \`-1\` from \`sendto\` usually indicates an error has occurred. Use \`errno\` to get the error code and \`perror()\` to print a descriptive error message, which you’ve done in some parts of your code already. If \`sendto\` returns \`-1\`, checking \`errno\` will provide more context on why the operation failed. 5. **Permissions**: - Sending raw packets usually requires root privileges. Make sure your program is run with appropriate permissions to create raw sockets and send packets. **Solutions**: - To send raw IP packets, you might consider aligning the \`socket()\` call with \`AF_INET\`, adjusting the code accordingly, and properly setting permissions. - Ensure you understand and correctly construct both the Ethernet and IP headers if you intend to stick with \`AF_PACKET\`. - If your goal doesn’t strictly require crafting packets at this low level, reconsider whether using higher-level protocols (TCP or UDP with the standard sockets API) would be more appropriate for your application. Adjusting the socket and addressing model, along with careful construction and setting of headers, should resolve the issue with \`sendto\` returning \`-1\`."},{"instruction":"woman's face, pablo picasso, cubism, vibrant colors, realistic, generate a description that is personable and describe the {model} art work on a canvas, include where in home it can be hung and gift for people, decor style or house theme, do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline ' ', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","output":"Title: \\"Cubist Reverie: The Vibrant Essence of Womanhood\\" Description: Imagine a stunning piece of artwork that captures the essence of femininity through the unique lens of Cubism, painted by the legendary Pablo Picasso.

Newton's method relies on using the gradient and the Hessian matrix of the cost function to iteratively update the parameter estimates. The update rule can be given by: [ beta^{(new)} = beta - H^{-1} nabla J(beta) ] Where: - (beta) are the coefficients - (H^{-1}) is the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the cost function with respect to (beta) - (nabla J(beta)) is the gradient of the cost function with respect to (beta) In logistic regression, the cost function (J(beta)) is the negative log-likelihood. Now, let's define functions for the gradient and the Hessian and perform the update in a loop: \`\`\`python def logistic_loss_and_grad(beta, X, y): z = np.dot(X, beta) p = logistic.cdf(z) # Probability estimation using logistic function gradient = np.dot(X.T, (p - y)) / len(X) return gradient def logistic_hessian(beta, X): z = np.dot(X, beta) p = logistic.cdf(z) W = np.diag(p * (1 - p)) # Weight matrix for Hessian H = np.dot(X.T, np.dot(W, X)) / len(X) return H beta = np.zeros(X.shape[1]) # Initialize beta lambda_ = 1e-5 # Small constant to add to the Hessian's diagonal if needed cost = [] for epoch in range(epochs): gradient = logistic_loss_and_grad(beta, X_train, y_train) H = logistic_hessian(beta, X_train) # Adding a small constant to the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix if necessary H += np.eye(H.shape[0]) * lambda_ beta -= np.linalg.solve(H, gradient) # Update rule # Optional: Computed cost (negative log-likelihood) for plotting z = np.dot(X_train, beta) p = logistic.cdf(z) cost.append(-np.sum(y_train * np.log(p) + (1 - y_train) * np.log(1 - p)) / len(X_train)) # Plotting learning curve plt.plot(np.arange(epochs), cost) plt.title(\\"Learning curve\\") plt.xlabel(\\"Epoch\\") plt.ylabel(r\\"J(beta)\\"); # Prediction and accuracy evaluation y_test_pred = logistic.cdf(np.dot(X_test, beta)) > 0.5 # 0.5 as decision threshold acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred) print(\\"Accuracy of Logistic Regression (Newton's method): {}\\".format(acc)) \`\`\` This code snippet implements Newton's method for optimizing the parameters of a logistic regression model. It alternates between calculating the gradient and the Hessian matrix of the cost function and updates the parameters using these calculations. Note that a very small constant is added to the diagonal of the Hessian matrix before its inversion to ensure that it is invertible (this technique is known as regularization). The accuracy of the model is computed by predicting the classes in the test dataset and comparing these predictions to the actual labels. The learning curve (cost over epochs) is plotted to show how the model converges over time. This implementation assumes you have loaded and prepared your data correctly as outlined in your question.

This can occur for several reasons: 1. **Log of Zero**: If the predicted probabilities \`p\` are exactly 0 or 1, \`np.log(p)\` and \`np.log(1 - p)\` will result in \`-inf\` or \`nan\`, contaminating your cost computation. 2. **Overflow/Underflow in Exponential**: The computation of probabilities \`p\` using \`logistic.cdf(z)\` might lead to underflow or overflow, especially if \`z\` has very large positive or negative values. To mitigate these issues, you can add small numerical safeguards: - **Clip Probabilities**: Ensure that \`p\` avoids exact 0 or 1 values by clipping. - **Ensure Numerical Stability**: For very large or small \`z\`, directly handle \`logistic.cdf(z)\` calculations to avoid numerical issues. While your existing code tries to handle the Hessian's singularity by adding a small constant to its diagonal, let's focus on safeguarding the cost computation: \`\`\`python for epoch in range(epochs): gradient = logistic_loss_and_grad(beta, X_train, y_train) H = logistic_hessian(beta, X_train) # Adding a small constant to the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix if necessary H += np.eye(H.shape[0]) * 1e-5 beta -= np.linalg.solve(H, gradient) # Update rule # Computed cost (negative log-likelihood) for plotting with clipping to avoid log(0) z = np.dot(X_train, beta) p = logistic.cdf(z) p = np.clip(p, 1e-10, 1-1e-10) # Clip p to avoid log(0) scenarios cost.append(-np.sum(y_train * np.log(p) + (1 - y_train) * np.log(1 - p)) / len(X_train)) \`\`\` - **Clipping \`p\`**: Clipping the probabilities \`p\` between a very small positive value (e.g., \`1e-10\`) and \`1 - 1e-10\` ensures that you won't take the logarithm of 0, which avoids \`-inf\` or \`nan\` results in cost calculations. - **Regularization in Hessian**: The small constant added to the Hessian's diagonal helps to ensure it's positively definite and invertible but does not directly affect numerical stability in cost calculation. It's a common practice in Newton's method implementations to introduce a slight regularization effect and ensure numerical stability. Keep in mind, the performance of logistic regression, especially when using Newton's method, is significantly impacted by the data's scaling. You've already scaled your features using \`StandardScaler\`, which is generally a good practice to ensure numerical stability. If you continue to experience issues, it's worthwhile to inspect the values of \`z\`, \`p\`, and your gradients for any signs of numerical instability or errors in computation. Additionally, ensure there are no preprocessing steps that inadvertently corrupt data, leading to impossible logistic regression predictions."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this but it's set in Neon Genesis Evangelion, keep the original format. \\"M_717 — 02/18/2024 8:08 PM it's today was a good day right Spartan_godrage — 02/18/2024 8:08 PM Yes M_717 — 02/18/2024 8:08 PM I found this mix of my favorite song and yours https://youtu.be/4yr3XNFTpr4 YouTube Donald McGee Resonance x It Was A Good Day | Mashup Image Spartan_godrage — 02/18/2024 8:12 PM I think bro drives M_717 — 02/18/2024 8:13 PM huh?

I genuinely don't understand their logic for making a whole new version on another engine when they still manage to drag all of the issues from the previous version over as well as some new ones. Horrendously optimized, and it breaks at seeming random. Dino AI is still trash. Pathfinding is still trash. These crashes on launch have been around for years and are the exact same ones Survival Evolved had, and yet, there is no concrete fix nor attempt to fix it. In fact, the attempts to fix this game's issues almost always just bring more. Like when they tried to fix floating rocks.... And made more floating rocks and grasses and plants... There's a bug in the game, by the way, that's been there since release and kills all water tames when reloading the area since it loads them before the water. Not even a bandaid fix, like giving water creatures a second or so before they \\"drown\\" out of water. No acknowledgement despite the fact it effectively disables an entire way of playing the game in using and breeding water tames unless you want to play with their (nerfed) cryopodding everything always method that slows things down and means you can't have water defence dinos. Though maybe you won't want to ever experience ocean content anyway, when going within 10 meters of the world border sometimes just zaps you and your tame and EVERYTHING you had on you out of existance for no discernable reason. And squids can still push you through the mesh or the world border, deleting you and your things instantly. There's still a random crash that happens sometimes in the sea, that only seems to happen in the sea, and hasn't been fixed since survival evolved. Cheating, duping, meshing, is still rampant as ever. Community support is still nonexistant. Chinese megatribes blatantly abuse exploits and nothing is done, but the second one of them doesn't like you, or you speak up about it, YOU will be met with retribution as the devs are in their pockets. There is a ton of actual evidence to back this up if you are skeptical elsewhere. The pros to this version of ark are sadly very limited. Do you like gorgeous graphics? Well, if you can get your computer to run it on max without bursting into flames, you'll enjoy the scenery. The map meshes were redone. It's nice. A number of quality of life features have been added. But... These quality of life changes were all available as mods before on Survival Evolved, so if those are all you want, don't bother. The new building system is admittedly quite good. Speaking of mods; The devs have made the perplexing decision to have additional content, like events and creature releases implemented as mods. I cannot fathom why. I want to end this, by the way, with saying I have several thousands of hours on Survival Evolved, and even if I hated the concept of ASA to begin with, I would have been willing to pour another few thousand into ASA if it felt like they weren't just retreading the same ground in an even more cockeyed manner. This whole game feels like a scam, a cash-grab. I miss when ARK really felt like the devs cared about the quality. It did, genuinely, feel that way once, many years ago. And it's not because it's in Early Access that it feels so bad now in ASA, I am certain - Survival Evolved was also in Early Access for a long time. I was there for it and remember it (And the deserved backlash for releasing Scorched Earth as paid DLC during early access.. in hindsight I should have taken that as an omen) That feeling of caring devs is unfortunately very much gone. I can't in good conscience reccomend ARK to anyone. I have absolutely zero faith that any of the major crash sources, bugs or glitches will be fixed anytime soon, and even now they're pulling their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with paid extras for an unfinished product again.

Es gab mal eine Ark Community, diese wurde mit dem Release von Ark Ascended geteilt. Der Teil der jetzt hier spielt wird nur noch an der Nase herum geführt. Erste Karte The Island die Grafik an sich ist schön, aber das war es dann auch. Bei genauerem hinschauen sieht man das die Karte an sich nur mit einem Generator hingeklatscht wurde. Ark lebte durch eine individuelle Anpassung, durch sogenannte Mods. Diese Mods wurden von Moddern/Programmieren der Community zur Verfügung gestellt. Jetzt werden sogar die Mods teilweise kostenpflichtig. Dann kam Heute die zweite Map Scorched Earth raus und sehe da auf einmal starten die Server nicht mehr. Wir haben genau wie in ARK SE versucht ein Cluster aufrecht zu erhalten aber bei jedem \\"Update/Patch\\" können die Server teilweise bis zu zwei Tagen nicht mehr zum laufen gebracht werden. Ich finde diesem Spiel sollte man keine weitere Beachtung mehr schenken. Geht unter mit euerm mist! LEER MÁS ¿Te ha sido útil esta reseña?

Он прекрасен, это совершенно уникальная игра. Но АСА... Это какой-то ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Постоянные дисконнекты даже на официальных не особо загруженных серверах. Постоянные - это значит в среднем раз в час или даже в полчаса вас кикнет из игры. Еще больше бесит то, что при попытке зайти игра часто крашится. Также она крашится при входе-выходе в пещеры, при телепорте... Будь у меня слабый комп, я бы наверное заткнулся и копил деньги. Но у меня 4090, 64 гига DDR5 и топовый i9, а соединение - оптика прямо в комп. И что мы имеем? Игра прекрасна, красива, но играть в нее невозможно. Подожду полгодика или типа того...

Grafisch ist dieses Spiel doch ziemlich anspruchsvoll. Mit meiner 3060 kann ich nur auf mittleren Einstellungen halbwegs flüssig spielen. Im Vergleich zum ursprünglichen Ark gibt es allerdings kaum spürbare Änderungen, egal ob in der Spielmechanik oder der KI. Einzig die, wie oben angeschnitten, Grafikeinstellungen. Den integrierten Mod-Support (geregelt über das Ingame-Menü) finde ich eine super Lösung. Dies erspart den Aufwand über den Workshop die Mods zu suchen und zu installieren. Von dem 1. DLC bin ich bisher noch etwas enttäuscht. Die Funktion Schatzsuche funktioniert noch nicht wirklich, es erscheint immer die Meldung \\"Kaufe nun das DLC um dieses Item zu verwenden.\\" Ich meine, ich habe das DLC, wieso soll ich es dann nochmal kaufen? -.- Schade das dieses Spiel so \\"unfertig\\" portiert wurde und dann erschienen ist. Die unzähligen Abstürze sind schon echt nervig, selbst die Updates sind voller Bugs. Ich musste das Game mindestens schon 10 Mal neu Installieren weil bei dem Update-Vorgang \\"etwas schief gelaufen\\" ist. Ich weiß bis heute nicht warum dies Passiert ist, platz ist auf der SSD mehr als genug. Vielleicht wird dieses Spiel eines Tages ASE ersetzen, aber solange diese Kinderkrankheiten bestehen ist es echt nervig. Andere Spiele die mit der Unreal Engine 5 überarbeitet oder gemacht wurden laufen deutlich besser ohne Abstürze. Ob ich mir das Game gekauft hätte mit diesen Informationen? <- hmm, ich denke nicht. 45€ (Normalpreis bei Erscheinung) sind dann noch noch eine Stange Geld. Einzig die Möglichkeit ENDLICH auch Crossplay mit Konsolen Zocken zu können hat mich zu dem Kauf gebracht. Dieses Feature hätte nach so langer Zeit im Vorgänger erscheinen müssen. Ich kann den Kauf aktuell nur den Spielern Empfehlen die Ark Fans sind und/oder Crossplay spielen möchten. LEER MÁS ¿Es útil?

Si valoras los gráficos de alta calidad, disfrutas de los desafíos y puedes soportar algunos errores y cuestiones técnicas, entonces las reseñas sugieren que podrías disfrutar de este juego. Muchos jugadores han dedicado cientos de horas al juego, lo que indica que hay aspectos del juego que encuentran muy atractivos y divertidos. Especialmente si eres fan de la franquicia, la idea de sumergirte en el nuevo contenido y las actualizaciones podría ser algo que te interese. Por otro lado, si tiendes a frustrarte con los errores técnicos, la mala optimización, y las prácticas cuestionables de gestión de la comunidad y desarrollo, podrías querer reconsiderar. Las reseñas resaltan preocupaciones significativas en estas áreas, incluyendo problemas como crasheos frecuentes, fallos de optimización, y una percepción de descuido por parte de los desarrolladores hacia la base de jugadores. Además, si juegas en un entorno competitivo, las menciones repetidas de trampas, duplicaciones y explotación por parte de ciertas partes de la comunidad pueden ser un factor disuasorio serio. En resumen, si eres un gran fan de la serie y puedes ver más allá de sus defectos técnicos en busca de la experiencia subyacente, podría valer la pena probarlo.

Next, import the necessary functions from the RxJS library in your JavaScript file: \`\`\`javascript import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs'; \`\`\` 3. Now, you can create an observable from the onClick function using the \`fromEvent\` function. Here's an example: \`\`\`javascript const button = document.getElementById('myButton'); const clickObservable = fromEvent(button, 'click'); clickObservable.subscribe(event => { console.log('Button clicked'); }); \`\`\` In this example, we first select the button element with the id \`myButton\`. Then, we create an observable \`clickObservable\` using the \`fromEvent\` function, passing in the button element and the event type \`click\`.

Here's how you would write the formula: \`\`\`excel =COUNTIFS(A1:A100, \\">0\\", B1:B100, \\">0\\") \`\`\` What this does is to count the number of rows where both conditions are true: the value in column A is greater than 0, and the value in column B is also greater than 0, within the specified range (in this case, from row 1 to row 100). Remember, this formula looks at pairs of cells row by row - so for each row, if A is greater than 0 AND B is also greater than 0, that row adds 1 to the count."},{"instruction":"CREATE A COUNTIF AND FORMULA FOR EXCEL THAT COUNTS how many rows have two cells greater than 0","output":"To count how many rows have two specific cells within them greater than 0 in Excel, assuming you are referring to the same setup as before where you're looking at columns A and B from rows 1 to 100, you would use the \`COUNTIFS\` function. However, if you're looking for a more generic formula that can be adapted to different scenarios or perhaps you're asking about a situation where only two specific cells in each row need to meet the criteria regardless of their column, let's clarify the solution provided: For the specified case where we're checking if both cells in each row of columns A and B are greater than 0, the formula provided before is correct: \`\`\`excel =COUNTIFS(A1:A100, \\">0\\", B1:B100, \\">0\\") \`\`\` This \`COUNTIFS\` function looks at each row within the range A1:A100 and B1:B100 and counts it when both conditions are met: the value in the cell within the A column of that row is greater than 0, and simultaneously, the value in the cell within the B column of that row is greater than 0. # For a Different Scenario If your scenario is a bit different, such as wanting to know how many rows have *any* two cells within them that are greater than 0, across more columns, the solution gets a bit more complex because Excel doesn't have a built-in function that directly counts rows based on conditions across multiple columns. In such a case, you might resort to using an array formula or incorporating helper columns for more complex scenarios. # Using Helper Columns If you're okay with adding a helper column to simplify your task, you could do something like this, starting in C1 (assuming you're only checking columns A and B): \`\`\`excel =IF(AND(A1>0, B1>0), 1, 0) \`\`\` Drag this formula down from C1 through C100 to fill the helper column. This column will now contain a 1 for every row where both cells in columns A and B are greater than 0, and a 0 otherwise. Then, simply sum up the helper column: \`\`\`excel =SUM(C1:C100) \`\`\` This will give you the count of rows where both specified cells (in columns A and B in this case) are greater than 0. # Note For more complex scenarios or checking across multiple columns (more than two), consider adapting the approach with array formulas (in older Excel versions) or using Excel's dynamic array functions if you're using Excel 365 or Excel 2019, possibly in conjunction with the \`FILTER\` function and some logical tests, although specifics would depend heavily on the exact requirement."},{"instruction":"Как мне в командном блоке исполнить команду от имени Blue_Kod","output":"Для выполнения команды от имени игрока с ником Blue_Kod в командном блоке в Minecraft, вам нужно использовать специальный синтаксис \\"/execute as <ник игрока> run <команда>\\".

Here's why Emma Watson could be a compelling choice: 1. **Humanitarian and Advocacy Work**: Emma Watson has been a vocal advocate for gender equality and is widely recognized for her work as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador. Notably, she helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate for gender equality, echoing the impactful activism and advocacy work by figures like Michelle Obama and Malala Yousafzai. 2. **Inspirational Role Model**: Similar to the way Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres have inspired countless individuals, Emma Watson uses her platform to inspire and empower young women worldwide. Her efforts extend beyond gender equality to include sustainability and fair trade in the fashion industry, reflecting a broad concern for societal issues. 3. **Global Influence and Reach**: Emma Watson has a substantial international following, thanks in part to her acting career, notably as Hermoine Granger in the Harry Potter series. This platform amplifies her advocacy work, making her a globally recognized figure who can bring attention to important causes and motivate change, similar to the widespread influence of the individuals you're aligned with. 4. **Education and Activism**: Like Malala Yousafzai, Emma Watson has placed a strong emphasis on the importance of education for girls and has been active in promoting educational opportunities. Her articulate and passionate speeches on global platforms highlight her commitment and ability to mobilize support for educational and feminist causes. Writing to Emma Watson could be particularly effective if you're looking to appeal to someone passionate about gender equality, education, and youth empowerment. Her engagement in these areas, coupled with her global influence, aligns with the kind of impact generated by Oprah, Ellen, Michelle Obama, and Malala, making her a potential ally and advocate for your cause or project."},{"instruction":"как установить ansible на редос (рф) подробнее","output":"Чтобы установить Ansible на Linux-дистрибутив РЕДОС (Рабочая Единая Дистанционно-Обслуживаемая Операционная Система), который является российским дистрибутивом и может базироваться на Fedora, необходимо следовать шагам, аналогичным установке на другие Linux-дистрибутивы. Прежде всего, отмечу, что инструкция может потребовать корректировки в зависимости от конкретной версии РЕДОС и наличия доступа к репозиториям. Также учитывайте, что вам может потребоваться подключение к интернету или настроенный локальный репозиторий. **Вариант 1: Установка из РЕДОС репозитория (если доступно)** 1. Откройте терминал. 2. Обновите список пакетов: \`\`\` sudo dnf update \`\`\` 3. Установите Ansible: \`\`\` sudo dnf install ansible \`\`\` Это самый простой способ, но Ansible может быть не самой последней версии, в зависимости от репозитория. **Вариант 2: Установка через Python pip** Если в репозитории РЕДОС нет актуальной версии Ansible или Ansible отсутствует, можно установить его через менеджер пакетов Python pip. Этот метод подразумевает установку последней версии Ansible. 1. Установите Python и pip, если они ещё не установлены: \`\`\` sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip \`\`\` 2. Установите Ansible через pip: \`\`\` pip3 install --user ansible \`\`\` Таким образом, Ansible будет установлен локально для пользователя. Если требуется установить Ansible для всех пользователей системы, уберите флаг \`--user\` и выполните команду от имени суперпользователя: \`\`\` sudo pip3 install ansible \`\`\` **После установки** После завершения установки проверьте версию Ansible, чтобы убедиться, что установка прошла успешно: \`\`\` ansible --version \`\`\` **Примечание:** Последовательность команд может варьироваться в зависимости от версии РЕДОС и текущей настройки системы. Если возникают ошибки связанные с зависимостями, убедитесь, что у вас установлены все необходимые библиотеки для работы Ansible. Пожалуйста, учитывайте, что команды установки и работу с пакетными менеджерами, такими как \`dnf\`, следует выполнять с осторожностью, особенно если вы работаете на продуктивной системе."},{"instruction":"нужны ли дополнительные настройки","output":"После установки Ansible на дистрибутив РЕДОС (или любой другой Linux-дистрибутив), в большинстве случаев его можно сразу использовать для управления узлами. Однако для эффективного использования Ansible и адаптации под конкретные задачи могут потребоваться дополнительные настройки. # 1. Настройка инвентарного файла Ansible использует инвентарный файл (обычно это \`/etc/ansible/hosts\`), в котором перечисляются управляемые узлы. Обычно после установки Ansible следует настроить этот файл. Пример простого инвентарного файла: \`\`\`ini [webserver] 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 [dbservers] db1.example.com ansible_ssh_user=myuser ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key \`\`\` Группы \`[webserver]\` и \`[dbservers]\` позволяют организовать узлы по функциональности, упрощая управление ими. # 2. Настройка файла ansible.cfg Файл настроек \`ansible.cfg\` содержит различные глобальные настройки, например, путь к инвентарному файлу, параллелизм выполнения задач и т.д. По умолчанию Ansible ищет этот файл в нескольких местах в следующем порядке: 1. \`ansible.cfg\` в текущей директории; 2. \`.ansible.cfg\` в домашнем каталоге пользователя; 3. \`/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg\`. Часто настройки по умолчанию вполне подходят, но вы можете создать файл \`ansible.cfg\` в вашей рабочей директории и настроить его под свои нужды. # 3. Создание и настройка Playbook Playbook — это основной инструмент управления конфигурациями и оркестрации в Ansible. Playbook'и позволяют автоматизировать развертывание и настройку систем. Создайте YAML-файл (например, \`site.yml\`) и определите в нем задачи: \`\`\`yaml --- - name: Обновление веб-серверов hosts: webserver tasks: - name: Установить последнюю версию Apache ansible.builtin.yum: name: httpd state: latest \`\`\` Этот Playbook предназначен для обновления всех серверов в группе \`webserver\` до последней версии веб-сервера Apache. # 4. Использование переменных, шаблонов и ролей Переменные позволяют управлять значениями, используемыми в задачах и шаблонах, динамически. Шаблоны (основанные на Jinja2) помогают генерировать конфигурационные файлы. Роли представляют собой способ группировки задач, обработчиков, переменных и шаблонов по функциональности, что значительно упрощает управление большими проектами. # 5. Управление учетными данными Важно безопасно управлять учетными данными и криптографическими ключами. Ansible Vault может шифровать любые структурированные данные, включая переменные, для их безопасного хранения в репозитории кода. # Заключение Настройка и использование Ansible требуют понимания структуры вашей инфраструктуры и ваших конечных целей. Начните с простой настройки и постепенно применяйте более сложные концепции по мере того, как вы будете становиться более опытными в автоматизации и оркестрации с помощью Ansible."},{"instruction":"запускаю команду ansible -a host.txt all -m ping и выдает ошибку","output":"Похоже, вы столкнулись с проблемой в использовании команды Ansible из-за неправильного синтаксиса.

Правильный способ использовать команду \`ansible\` для пинга всех хостов, указанных в вашем инвентарном файле, выглядит так: \`\`\`bash ansible all -i host.txt -m ping \`\`\` Здесь: - \`all\` указывает на то, что команда будет применяться ко всем хостам в инвентаре. - \`-i\` опция нужна для указания файла инвентаря (в вашем случае \`host.txt\`). - \`-m ping\` указывает на использование модуля \`ping\`, который проверяет доступность узлов. Ошибка, с которой вы столкнулись, могла возникнуть по нескольким причинам: 1. **Неправильный синтаксис команды.** Убедитесь, что вы следуете правильному синтаксису, как указано выше. 2. **Ошибки в файле инвентаря (host.txt).** Проверьте, правильно ли указаны в вашем файле инвентаря хосты, и нет ли в нём синтаксических ошибок.

Make note of how I was diagnosed with Asperger’s at an early age. Also note how back in October 2023, I lost both of my parents within nine days, and have been working with various people (including BRAC executive director Evelyn Falconer) to get back on my feet and make something of myself. Demonstrate an awareness of and respect for Emma’s professional achievements, as well as her personal accomplishments, and point out all of the ways in which students would benefit from her presence at the achievement center. Above all, write the letter in such a way as to maximize the odds that should she see and read it she would not only respond but commit to visiting the Boca Raton Achievement Center, and make it clear what an honor it would be to have her here. Note that Evelyn Falconer will be more than happy to answer questions and address any concerns, and that she can be reached by phone at +1 (561) 559-9768 (business) or +1 (561) 427-8710 (personal), or by email at care4kids2@gmail.com.

As an avid follower of your career and your passionate advocacy for equality, education, and the empowerment of the underrepresented, I find a profound similarity in values that you embolden through your actions and those we cherish at the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC). At a very young age, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s, navigating through life’s complexities with the unique challenges and perspectives that come with being on the Autism Spectrum. Despite these hurdles, my journey has been one of resilience, growth, and an ongoing desire to make a meaningful impact. Your work, particularly as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, has been a beacon of inspiration for countless individuals, including myself, highlighting the strength in vulnerability and the power of lending a voice to those who might feel voiceless. In October of 2023, I faced the heartbreaking loss of both my parents within a span of nine days. Such a loss could easily deter one’s spirit, yet it is the support and sense of community found within BRAC, under the encouraging leadership of our executive director, Evelyn Falconer, which helped me find my footing again. Her contact information is +1 (561) 559-9768 (business), +1 (561) 427-8710 (personal), or by email at care4kids2@gmail.com, should you wish to reach out directly. BRAC is more than just an educational facility; it is a beacon of hope and empowerment for students and young adults aged 11-22+ with autism and related disabilities. Our mission and vision focus on providing a tailored, holistic development approach that goes beyond academics, fostering independence, vocational skills, and a nurturing environment where every student is valued and supported based on their individual needs and strengths. More about our dedication and programs can be discovered at https://bocaratonachievement.com. Your visit to BRAC would not only shine a light on the significance of inclusion and the empowerment of those with Autism Spectrum Disorders but also serve as an extraordinary source of inspiration for our students. It would affirm to them that their voices matter, that they are seen, and that their dreams are valid and achievable. Your journey embodies the essence of striving for justice, equality, and the power of using one’s platform to effect change – a message we fervently wish to echo within our walls. Emma, we are located at 500 NE Spanish River Blvd., Suite 30, Boca Raton, FL 33431, and would be honored to welcome you. Your presence would undeniably embolden our students and echo profoundly within our community. We understand the demands of your schedule and commitments; however, we hold hope that you might find time to share your light with us. This invitation is extended with the utmost respect for your accomplishments and the positive impact you continuously strive to make in the world. Should you consider this opportunity, you would not only touch the lives of many young individuals but further reinforce that determination, kindness, and advocacy can indeed make a world of difference.

This is because the \`HashMap\` uses these traits to determine how to equate keys (with \`Eq\`) and how to hash them (with \`Hash\`). Here's an example on how you might do this: \`\`\`rust use std::collections::HashMap; fn main() { // Declaring a HashMap where the key is a tuple of (i32, i32) let mut map: HashMap<(i32, i32), String> = HashMap::new(); // Inserting values into the map map.insert((1, 2), \\"Value at (1, 2)\\".to_string()); map.insert((3, 4), \\"Value at (3, 4)\\".to_string()); // Accessing values if let Some(value) = map.get(&(1, 2)) { println!(\\"Found: {}\\", value); } else { println!(\\"No value found for key (1, 2)\\"); } } \`\`\` In this example, \`(i32, i32)\` tuples are used as keys in the \`HashMap\`. Both \`i32\` and the tuple struct itself implement \`Eq\` and \`Hash\`, so they can be used as keys without issues. If you wish to use a custom type as part of a tuple for a key, you have to ensure that the custom type also implements \`Eq\` and \`Hash\`. You might typically derive these traits to do so, like this: \`\`\`rust use std::collections::HashMap; use std::hash::Hash; #[derive(Hash, PartialEq, Eq)] struct CustomKey { part1: i32, part2: String, } fn main() { let mut map: HashMap<(CustomKey, CustomKey), String> = HashMap::new(); let key1 = CustomKey { part1: 1, part2: \\"one\\".to_string() }; let key2 = CustomKey { part1: 2, part2: \\"two\\".to_string() }; map.insert((key1, key2), \\"Value at custom keys\\".to_string()); // Accessing would require ownership or references with life time considerations } \`\`\` In this extended example, a custom struct \`CustomKey\` is defined and derives \`Hash\`, \`PartialEq\`, and \`Eq\` to fulfill the requirements for being used in a \`HashMap\`. The hashmap then uses a tuple of custom keys as its keys."},{"instruction":"Chromochemical (color-chemistry) classification system of aerosol: 1. Frigidian: Hydrogen clouds (#f5f6ff) 2.

This classification system seems to meticulously categorize a variety of cloud types from various chemical origins and associates them with specific hexadecimal color codes, providing a visual cue for each category. Below is a more detailed look into each category based on their described characteristics and potential implications: 1. **Frigidian (Hydrogen clouds #f5f6ff):** Light blue-white colors suggest cold, high-altitude clouds primarily composed of hydrogen, possibly found in the upper atmospheres of gas giants or ice giants. 2. **Methanian (Methane clouds #c4eeff):** Bright blue clouds, indicative of methane-rich atmospheres like those found on Uranus and Neptune. Methane absorbs red light, giving these planets their distinct blue color. 3. **Lilacean (Clouds of nitrogen and carbon monoxide, rarely oxygen #fef5ff):** Pale lavender clouds could be associated with atmospheres like Titan's, where nitrogen is dominant, with carbon monoxide and minimal oxygen presence. 4. **Sulfurian (Clouds of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide #ffefba):** Light yellow clouds, typical of planets with volcanic activity that releases sulfur compounds, a trait possibly present on Venus or Jupiter's moon Io. 5. **Ammonian (Ammonia clouds, but hazes of tholin and phosphorus #fff1e0, #ffdca1, #d99559):** Shades of off-white to beige to light brown, suggestive of ammonia clouds intermixed with more complex organic molecules and phosphorus, characteristics of the atmospheres of Saturn or Jupiter. 6. **Waterian (Water clouds #ffffff):** Pure white clouds, found on Earth, indicating condensation of water vapor into liquid or solid clouds. 7. **Acidian (Sulfuric acid clouds #fff8d4):** Light yellowish-white, characteristic of Venus' thick, toxic clouds composed primarily of sulfuric acid droplets. 8. **Navyean (Cloudless #175973):** Deep navy blue, suggesting clear, cloudless skies. The specific conditions under which such a category could be prevalent are less clear, possibly relating to clear atmospheres found on terrestrial planets with minimal cloud cover. 9. **Siliconelian (Siloxane hazes #998c7e):** Gray-brown hues, which might relate to atmospheres containing silicon-based compounds, suggesting worlds with exotic chemistries. 10. **Alkalian (Alkali metal hazes #271f1d):** Dark brown-black, potentially indicative of hot Jupiters with high concentrations of alkali metals in their atmospheres, absorbing almost all incoming light. 11. **Silicatian (Clouds of magnesium/iron silicate #7e8c77, #788a8d):** Gray-green to blue-gray, likely representative of mineral clouds found in the atmospheres of exoplanets or evolved stars, where silicates could condense into clouds. 12. **Corundian (Clouds of corundum and calcium oxide #f2ad3e, #e88e57, #e06949):** Shades from golden to orange to red, potentially representing extremely hot exoplanets with high-temperature clouds composed of minerals like corundum (aluminum oxide) or calcium oxide. 13. **Fuliginian (Carbon hazes #040305):** Nearly black, indicative of thick carbon or soot hazes, possibly akin to conditions on highly polluted planets or those undergoing intense volcanic activity that releases vast amounts of particulates into the atmosphere. This classification system posits a fascinating approach to categorizing and understanding the atmospheres of celestial bodies, focusing on the visual and chemical aspects. It could serve as a basis for exoplanet research, atmospheric studies, and speculative considerations of alien worlds."},{"instruction":"Describe Fuliginian gas giant","output":"A Fuliginian gas giant would be a highly intriguing type of exoplanet, uniquely defined by its dense atmosphere rich in carbon compounds that form thick, soot-like hazes, giving the planet a nearly black appearance. Here’s a conceptual description of such a planet based on the classification provided and incorporating general astrophysics knowledge: # Characteristics of a Fuliginian Gas Giant - **Dominant Atmosphere:** The atmosphere would likely be dominated by heavy carbon compounds. Frequent and intense volcanic activity or processes not yet well understood could contribute to the proliferation of carbon-rich particulates throughout the atmosphere. - **Color and Appearance:** With a hex code near #040305, the planet would appear as a deep, dark sphere when viewed from space, absorbing a significant amount of visible light due to the large amounts of soot and carbon hazes suspended in its atmosphere. Its strikingly dark appearance might only be broken by occasional flashes of light from lightning within the clouds, more intense around areas of heightened atmospheric activity. - **Heat and Temperature:** The thick carbon haze could act as a potent greenhouse agent, trapping heat and potentially making the Fuliginian gas giant surprisingly warm, depending on its proximity to its star and internal heat sources. This retained heat could drive complex and dynamic atmospheric circulation patterns. - **Weather Patterns:** The weather on a Fuliginian gas giant might be severe and extreme, with high-speed winds and storm systems powered by the planet's internal heat. Carbon particles could contribute to the formation of highly electrically charged clouds, leading to frequent, intense storms. - **Potential Habitability and Moons:** While the planet itself would likely be inhospitable to life as we know it, any moons orbiting the planet could present interesting areas of study, particularly if they are outside the dense carbon haze layer but still within the planet's magnetosphere, offering some protection from cosmic and solar radiation. # Scientific Interest and Hypothetical Implications - **Astrophysics and Chemistry:** Such a planet would be of immense interest to astrophysicists and chemists, offering a natural laboratory for studying complex carbon chemistry and high-energy atmospheric physics. Understanding the processes that maintain the thick carbon haze could provide insights into atmospheric dynamics, planetary formation, and the lifecycle of carbon through a planetary system. - **Exoplanet Diversity:** A Fuliginian gas giant would underscore the vast diversity of exoplanets, challenging existing models of planet formation and evolution, and potentially leading to new theories about the types of celestial bodies that can exist in the universe. - **Search for Life:** While the planet itself would be unlikely to host life, its existence could hint at the conditions necessary for the formation of carbon-based compounds that are essential for life as we understand it. Studying its atmosphere could help scientists understand the extremes of habitability and the formation of prebiotic molecules in harsh environments. In summary, a Fuliginian gas giant presents a captivating world, shrouded in darkness, with unique chemical and physical properties pushing the boundaries of our understanding of gas giants and the potential for complexity in planetary atmospheres."},{"instruction":"Describe type of gas giant called Saturnian, it has permanent frozen clouds of color-chemistry aerosols that never raining","output":"A Saturnian gas giant, as conceptualized here, would represent a unique and fascinating type of planet within the realm of theoretical astrophysics and exoplanetary science. This planet type is defined by its permanent frozen clouds composed of color-chemistry aerosols, which intriguingly never precipitate as rain. Here's an elaborate description of such a planet based on known principles of planetary science: # Characteristics of a Saturnian Gas Giant - **Atmosphere:** The atmosphere of a Saturnian gas giant would be rich in chemical compounds that can exist in frozen particulate form at the temperatures and pressures present at various altitudes. This atmosphere would likely consist of a mixture of hydrogen, helium, and other elements, but with significant quantities of chemical compounds that form aerosols, contributing to the planet's unique cloud characteristics. - **Permanent Frozen Clouds:** Unlike Earth, where water clouds can lead to precipitation in the form of rain or snow, the clouds on a Saturnian gas giant are permanently frozen. This could be due to the extremely low temperatures in the upper atmosphere, preventing the aerosols from reaching a state where they could condense and fall as precipitation. These clouds might be composed of ammonia, methane, or other hydrocarbons, existing as ice crystals or other solid particles suspended in the atmosphere. - **Appearance:** The visual spectacle of a Saturnian gas giant would be mesmerizing. The frozen clouds could form intricate and beautiful patterns, with different colors reflecting the composition of the aerosols. The color-chemistry of these aerosols would give the planet a vibrant appearance, potentially displaying bands of different hues and complex storm systems visibly distinct but static in their frozen state. - **Climate and Weather Patterns:** The weather on this type of gas giant would be driven by internal heat sources and the planet's rotation, creating dynamic and possibly fast-moving atmospheric systems. However, the absence of liquid precipitation would mean these systems manifest differently than on Earth, with variations in cloud movement and structure rather than changes in precipitation patterns. - **Scientific Interest:** Such a planet would be of great interest for its potential to help scientists understand atmospheric chemistry and dynamics under extreme conditions. The mechanisms by which aerosols remain permanently frozen and the energy balance within the atmosphere would be key areas of study. # Hypothetical Implications - **Exoplanet Diversity:** A Saturnian gas giant would highlight the incredible diversity of exoplanets and the wide range of atmospheric conditions possible. It would challenge current models of atmospheric science, particularly in understanding how permanent frozen clouds can exist without ever leading to precipitation. - **Study of Atmospheric Processes:** Analyzing the atmospheric processes on a Saturnian gas giant could provide insights into aerosol physics, cloud formation, and the effects of extreme cold on atmospheric chemistry. This, in turn, might offer analogues for understanding more complex atmospheric phenomena in our solar system and beyond. - **Search for Extraterrestrial Phenomena:** While the absence of rain and relatively harsh atmospheric conditions might make the existence of life as we know it unlikely on such a planet, the unique chemistry and dynamics of its atmosphere could still hold clues to the building blocks of life or exotic forms of matter. In essence, a hypothetical Saturnian gas giant, with its permanent frozen clouds and a dazzling array of color-chemistry aerosols, would not only add to the tapestry of planetary types posited by scientists but also significantly contribute to our understanding of planetary atmospheres, their dynamics, and their chemical processes."},{"instruction":"Describe Corundian-Saturnian gas giant, it appears purple and white after transformation in starless state","output":"A Corundian-Saturnian gas giant presents a fascinating theoretical scenario within the conceptual realm of astrophysics and planetary science. This type of gas giant blends characteristics previously outlined for Corundian (noted for clouds of corundum and calcium oxide) and Saturnian gas giants (with permanent frozen clouds of color-chemistry aerosols that never rain). Upon transitioning to a starless state—perhaps cast adrift from its stellar system or located in a particularly dark region of space—this planet undergoes a remarkable transformation in appearance. # Atmospheric Composition: The atmosphere of a Corundian-Saturnian gas giant would be both complex and chemically rich. It would contain, among others, aerosols of aluminum oxide (corundum) and calcium oxide, which could form crystalline clouds. These compounds might initially give the planet a range of colors, including shades associated with corundum crystals, such as deep blues or reds from sapphire and ruby respectively, intermingled with the brighter hues from calcium oxide clouds. # Transition to Starless State: In its starless state, the planet's appearance would be largely independent of starlight, relying instead on internal sources of light or luminescence, chemical reactions within the atmosphere, or interactions with the interstellar medium to create visible phenomena. The transformation noted involves the planet appearing purple and white, which could result from several fascinating processes: - **Bioluminescence-like Phenomena:** While traditionally associated with biological processes, a non-biological analog could exist where chemical reactions within the planet’s atmosphere produce luminescence. The specific chemicals involved in these reactions would have to emit predominantly in the purple spectrum, possibly through phosphorescence or fluorescence. - **Internal Heat and Phosphorescence:** The planet's internal heat might cause certain compounds within the clouds to phosphoresce, emitting light in the absence of direct radiation. White and purple light could emanate from different materials cooling at distinct rates or undergoing phase changes. - **Interactions with the Interstellar Medium:** As the planet moves through a starless region, interactions with charged particles in the interstellar medium (like those causing auroras on Earth) could generate dazzling displays. If the prevailing emissions occur in the ultraviolet to visible range, they might manifest as purple, with white light potentially resulting from a broader spectrum of emitted wavelengths. # Hypothetical Implications: The existence of a Corundian-Saturnian gas giant, especially one that appears purple and white in a starless state, would have profound implications for understanding planetary atmospheres and their potential for varied and exotic phenomena. - **Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics:** Studying such a planet would offer unique insights into the behavior of complex aerosols in extremely low-temperature environments, the mechanisms of light emission without direct sunlight, and the potential for exotic crystal formation in gas giant atmospheres. - **Planetary Evolution:** Understanding how a gas giant evolves to display such characteristics in a starless state could reveal new aspects of planetary lifecycle, particularly in how planets adapt to and signify changes in their ambient environments. - **Astrobiological Potential:** While the conditions described would be harsh and seemingly inhospitable to life as we know it, the complex chemistry and dynamic atmospheric processes could offer valuable lessons in astrobiology, particularly regarding the potential for life in extreme and variable environments. In essence, a Corundian-Saturnian gas giant's transformation in a starless state, manifesting as a dazzling purple and white celestial body, underscores the beauty and complexity of potential planetary phenomena beyond our current understanding, pushing the boundaries of astrophysical theories and planetary science."},{"instruction":"give me a list of \\"hot deals\\" for advertising hemp","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, specific \\"hot deals\\" for advertising hemp products or services are highly dynamic and will vary greatly depending on the platform, the target market, and current legal regulations in the area where the advertisements will be displayed.

These abnormalities can lead to or exacerbate the occurrence of acute pancreatitis either by impacting the flow of digestive enzymes and causing their premature activation or by creating obstructions that lead to increased pressure and tissue injury. Some of the primary anatomical abnormalities influencing the occurrence of acute pancreatitis, along with an approximation of their contribution, are: 1. **Pancreas Divisum** (accounts for about 5-10% of acute pancreatitis cases in adults): Pancreas divisum is the most common congenital pancreatic anomaly, where the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts fail to fuse during fetal development. This can lead to inadequate drainage of pancreatic juices through the minor papilla, contributing to the development of pancreatitis in some individuals. 2. **Annular Pancreas** (rare, exact percentage hard to quantify): An annular pancreas occurs when a ring of pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum, potentially leading to duodenal obstruction or narrowing that can impede the flow of pancreatic enzymes and contribute to pancreatitis. This is more frequently observed causing symptoms in newborns or children, but can sometimes present in adults. 3. **Choledochal Cysts** (rare, accounting for a very small percentage): Choledochal cysts are congenital dilations of the bile duct, which can cause obstructive jaundice and can be associated with pancreatitis due to the shared opening of the pancreatic and bile ducts into the duodenum. Pancreatitis occurs due to bile reflux into the pancreatic duct or due to the obstruction of the common bile duct. 4. **Pancreatic Ductal Anomalies** (varies): Variations in the anatomy of the pancreatic duct, including strictures, dilations, and kinking, can predispose individuals to acute pancreatitis by causing increased ductal pressure, stasis, and eventual damage to the pancreatic tissue. It's essential to note that while anatomical abnormalities can contribute to the occurrence of acute pancreatitis, the condition is most commonly caused by gallstones and chronic alcohol use, each accounting for a large percentage of cases (with gallstones being responsible for approximately 40-70% of cases and alcohol around 25-35% in Western countries). The contribution percentages of the anatomical abnormalities to the occurrence of acute pancreatitis can be challenging to estimate accurately. The prevalence of these conditions among patients with acute pancreatitis can vary widely depending on the study population and the diagnostic methods used. Additionally, many cases of acute pancreatitis may have multifactorial causes, where anatomical abnormalities combine with other risk factors like alcohol use, medications, or metabolic conditions to precipitate the disease. Current management strategies for acute pancreatitis caused by anatomical abnormalities revolve around addressing the underlying anatomical issue, which may involve endoscopic or surgical interventions, alongside supportive care to manage symptoms and prevent complications."},{"instruction":"how determine center in pentagon if you have no any measurement tool?","output":"To determine the center of a pentagon (or the centroid) without any measurement tools, you can use a geometric approach with a piece of paper and a pencil. Follow these steps to approximate the center: 1. **Draw the Pentagon**: If you haven’t done so already, draw your pentagon on a piece of paper. It doesn’t have to be perfect, but getting it as regular (all sides and angles equal) as possible will help. 2. **Mark the Midpoints**: For each side of the pentagon, visually estimate and mark the midpoint. Doing this by eye won’t be perfectly accurate, but it should get you close. 3. **Draw the Diagonals or Bisectors**: - **Option 1 (Diagonals Method)**: From each vertex (corner) of the pentagon, draw a line (diagonal) to the non-adjacent vertices. This is a bit complex for a pentagon and might not be as straightforward without accurate measurement. - **Option 2 (Easier and Recommended — Bisectors Method)**: Instead of drawing diagonals, draw a line from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. To do this accurately by eye, try to imagine or very lightly sketch the path first. These lines are essentially bisecting the angles at each vertex. 4. **Intersection Point**: - In the diagonals method, the point where most diagonals cross (or closely cluster) can serve as an approximation of the center. This is hard to do perfectly in a pentagon due to the irregular intersection of diagonals, so it's less recommended without tools. - With the bisectors method, the lines should ideally intersect at a single point inside the pentagon. This point is closer to what we can consider the \\"centroid\\" or geometric center of the pentagon. Given the imprecise nature of doing this by eye, the lines may not all intersect perfectly at one point, but where most lines intersect or the average point among them is a good approximation of the center. 5. **Adjustment**: If the first attempt seems off, you can try adjusting the lines slightly based on your estimation or draw more bisectors from different vertices to get a more accurate \\"center.\\" It’s important to remember that without precise measurement tools, finding the exact center of a pentagon will be an approximation. However, this method gets you close by visually balancing the shape around what appears to be its center."},{"instruction":"how determine center in pentagon if you have no any measurement tool, pencil, or paper?","output":"The task of determining the exact center of a pentagon without any measurement tools, pencil, or paper can be quite a challenge due to the irregularities that can exist in pentagon shapes. However, a method exists for a regular pentagon (one where all sides and angles are equal) that utilizes geometry and can be approximated physically through careful folding if you have a cutout of the pentagon. For an ideal, hands-on method without any tools, follow these steps. Note, this method is an approximation and relies on your ability to fold or manipulate the pentagon as accurately as possible: # Regular Pentagon: 1. **Fold Corners to Opposite Sides**: Begin by folding one corner of the pentagon to the midpoint of the opposite side. It's important to try to find the midpoint as accurately as possible. Make a small crease or mark. Repeat this for all corners. 2. **Intersection Point**: The idea behind the folds is that for a regular pentagon, lines drawn from each corner to the midpoint of the opposite side would intersect at the center. The intersection of these folds or lines approximates the center of the pentagon. This approach can give you an approximate center but is reliant on accurate folding and the ability to judge the midpoint of an edge without tools, which can be challenging. # Irregular Pentagon: For an irregular pentagon, without the constraint of equal sides and angles, finding the center (which could mean the centroid, incenter, or another definition of centrality depending on the context) gets more complicated without tools. The method above can lead to an approximation but is less reliable due to the asymmetry. In geometry, finding the exact center of irregular shapes typically involves mathematical calculations that aren’t feasible without tools or at least a way to mark and measure. In practical and informal settings, for irregular shapes, a rough estimation might involve more intuitive methods—like balancing the cutout on a fingertip to find a \\"center of mass\\" sort of point, which could work for simple cases but doesn’t technically find the geometric center as per mathematical definitions. # Conclusion Without any tools, finding the precise center of a pentagon, especially an irregular one, is significantly challenging and prone to inaccuracies. The folding method described here can provide an approximate result for a regular pentagon. For more complex shapes or for greater accuracy, tools and mathematical methods would be required."},{"instruction":"I have fallen down and bleeding from my knee. What should i do now?

It plays into Garfield’s typical disdain or apathy towards anything that requires him to engage or participate beyond his comfort zone. - **Jon’s Role**: As the human character who often brings elements of surprise or unwelcomed change into Garfield’s life, Jon fittingly introduces the crossover fanart, igniting Garfield's dramatic responses. - **Odie and Other Elements**: Although Odie's presence isn't detailed in the reaction, traditionally, Odie serves as a foil to Garfield's sophistication with his simple, joyful demeanor. The setting involving birthday hats and a cake initially suggests celebration, which quickly turns into a humorous nightmare scenario for Garfield. **Humor Style**: The humor in this modified comic strip is multi-layered, combining internet meme culture, meta-commentary on creative processes, the surprise element of poorly executed fan creations, and the traditional \\"Garfield\\" theme of Garfield being put into discomforting situations. **Cultural Reference**: “Scandinavia and the World” itself is a playful take on stereotypes and cultural characteristics, which, when combined with “Garfield’s” established comedic style that typically mocks the mundane or highlights laziness and food obsession, creates a nuanced joke that appeals to fans of both series who appreciate the irreverence of merging these worlds. **Conclusion**: This modified comic serves as an amusing experiment in blending two distinctly different comic universes, leveraging the familiarity and expectations fans have toward each series to create humor through an unexpected and somewhat absurd crossover scenario, fitting well within the tradition of internet humor and fan-made content."},{"instruction":"here: record .info .3 .clone() .into_iter() .for_each(|(start, end)| { intron2name .insert((record.chrom.clone(), start, end), }); pub type Intron2Name = DashMap<(Chromosome, u64, u64), Vec<Arc<str>>>; in the insert, I want to push Arc<str> to a value vector.

Given that DashMap is a concurrent map, it handles most race conditions internally, but you still have to ensure that your code correctly handles the insertion logic based on the current state of the entry. Given your type definition of \`Intron2Name\`, here's how you could adjust your loop to add \`Arc<str>\` values to the vectors: \`\`\`rust use std::sync::Arc; use dashmap::DashMap; // Assuming definition of \`Chromosome\` and the rest of your context is available pub type Intron2Name = DashMap<(Chromosome, u64, u64), Vec<Arc<str>>>; // Assuming \`record\`, \`intron2name\`, and your value of interest (let's say \`name: Arc<str>\`) are available record .info .3 .clone() .into_iter() .for_each(|(start, end)| { // Generate the key from the current record's information let key = (record.chrom.clone(), start, end); // Access or insert an empty vector if this key hasn't been seen before, // then push your Arc<str> to the vector associated with this key. intron2name .entry(key) .and_modify(|vec| vec.push(name.clone())) .or_insert_with(|| vec![name.clone()]); }); \`\`\` Here's a breakdown of what happens in the modified \`.for_each\` closure: 1. **Create the Key:** Based on fields in your \`record\`, you generate a key of the type \`(Chromosome, u64, u64)\`. 2. **Entry API Access:** You use the \`.entry(key)\` method to access the entry API of \`DashMap\`, which will handle concurrency issues for you. 3. **Modify or Insert:** - **and_modify:** If the key exists, it retrieves the value (in your case, a \`Vec<Arc<str>>\`), and you're then able to \`.push(name.clone())\` to add your \`Arc<str>\` to this vector. - **or_insert_with:** If the key does not exist, it creates a new vector with your \`Arc<str>\` as the initial value. This strategy ensures that your map correctly updates without losing any data in case of concurrent access and takes care of creating or updating the vectors as necessary based on the presence of the key."},{"instruction":"Please explain the following modified Garfield comic.

The comic is essentially a creative crossover that humorously blends the universes of both comics. In this modified comic, the setup references a typical scenario in the Garfield strip where Jon, Garfield's owner, is about to present something to Garfield that often results in a humorous or undesirable outcome for Garfield. The twist here involves Jon acknowledging the concept of comic strip crossovers and then pretending to abandon the idea due to the presumed busyness of the modified comic's creator, humorously citing playing \\"Bloons TD 6\\" as the reason. This mention of \\"Bloons TD 6\\" is an unrelated reference to a popular tower defense game, suggesting a reason why the creator might not be focusing on creating new comic content. Despite initially setting up a scenario where no crossover will happen, Jon then proceeds to introduce a crossover anyway, revealing \\"sh*tty fanart\\" of characters from the Scandinavia and the World webcomic, specifically America, Sister Mexico, and Canada. These characters are humorously depicted as Garfield's new neighbors. Scandinavia and the World is a comic that personifies countries and their relationships in a humorous and often insightful way. By introducing these characters into the Garfield universe, the modified comic strip is creating a humorous juxtaposition between Garfield's typically mundane, domestic issues and the larger geopolitical or cultural themes often explored in Scandinavia and the World. Garfield's horrified reaction and declaration of it being his \\"worst nightmare ever\\" is a punchline that plays on the absurdity of such a crossover, emphasizing how out of place these characters are in Garfield's world. This reaction can also be seen as a humorous commentary on the idea of fan-made crossovers and the unexpected or sometimes jarring nature of combining disparate fictional universes. The caption \\"To be continued\\" suggests a humorous intent to continue this unlikely and absurd crossover, keeping in line with the playful nature of fan-made content and the spirit of both original comics. The \\"Credits\\" at the end of the explanation acknowledge the original creators of the material used to create this fan-made strip, respecting their intellectual property while also highlighting the creative remixing and sharing culture prevalent in fan communities."},{"instruction":"Can you remember this writing style as my writing style? : In the tiny village of Whistleridge, sandwiched between two rather overbearing mountains, resided Arlo Finch, an artist whose reputation swirled around town like a saucy rumor at a high school dance. You see, Arlo wasn’t your garden-variety painter who slathered canvases with brooding skies or somnolent bowls of fruit. No, sir. His paintings made things happen. Magical things. The kind that makes you doubt your eyesight and consider getting your head checked. If Arlo painted you in clogs, tap-dancing in the town square, well, the odds became good that you’d wake up the next morning with an uncontrollable urge to shuffle-ball-change right next to Mrs. Higgins’ flower cart. No one knew how he did it, but that probably added to the soup of intrigue that folks around Whistleridge happily slurped up. On a particularly unassuming Tuesday, Arlo decided it was high time for another showstopper. At precisely 6:42 AM, with a steaming mug of what could only be described as “coffee adjacent,” he propped a pristine canvas on his easel. He stared at it with a kind of intensity usually reserved for defusing bombs or reading the terms and conditions of an app before reflexively hitting ‘accept.’ The townspeople of Whistleridge held their collective breath. Arlo hadn’t unveiled a new piece since the ‘Infinity Soup’ incident, in which Mrs. Fletcher stirred her pot to find it never emptied, and people grew weary of minestrone for weeks. With a mischievous twinkle in his eye, Arlo picked up his brush and pondered over his vast collection of paints. They weren’t labeled red, blue, or any such pedestrian titles. Oh, no. Instead, they read: “Chuckle,” “Guffaw,” and “Snort.” With a confident exuberance, he dove the bristles into a hue called “Hilarity Ensues.” As the day wore on, Arlo painted with an energy that would shame the swiftest squirrel preparing for winter. The canvas soon bloomed with a carnival scene not of this world. There were tents striped in colors that defied physics, lollipop trees, and a merry-go-round with creatures that looked suspiciously like Mrs. Higgins’ tabby fused with a toucan. Word spread faster than butter on a hot skillet, and soon enough, a crowd gathered around Arlo’s studio—which, to be fair, was just the dilapidated barn he had claimed in ‘the Name of Art’ several summers ago. They peered through the gaps in the wood, eager for a glance of the master at work. As dusk painted the sky with its own stunning artistry, Arlo laid down his brush with an air of finality. The townspeople waited, barely daring to breathe. An acceptable silence, the kind that might follow a particularly good joke or a dramatic soap opera confession, settled over the crowd. Nightfall cinched Whistleridge in her starry embrace when Arlo flung open the barn doors. The townsfolk craned their necks like a flock of curious geese, only to meet… absolutely nothing. The easel sat forlorn and empty. “B-but where’s the painting, Arlo?” cried young Timmy, whose disappointment was as palpable as the stickiness of his candy-smeared cheeks. Arlo smiled a serpentine curl of a smile and gestured grandly behind them. The crowd turned to see the Whistleridge Town Square transformed. The merry-go-round spun with mythical beasties, while the lollipop trees swayed to an inaudible symphony. The carnival had leaked, no, burst from the canvas and was alive before their very eyes. The townspeople blinked in astonishment. “Is this one of those magic-eye things? Because I’ve never been good at those,” muttered Mr. Quimby, squinting as if that would help things make sense. Arlo chuckled. “Hilarity Ensues!” he declared and, with a hat-tip, strode into the carnival. The townsfolk gamboled after him, giddy as children who’d discovered that math homework could, in fact, “do itself” if wished hard enough. Magic fizzed in the air, as tangible as the bubbles in soda pop, making the impossible possible. In no time flat, Whistleridge went from a sleepy little village to a buzzing social hotspot. News had traveled, like due credit in an office gossiper’s ledger, to every conceivable corner. People flocked from far and wide to witness the art that breathed life, laughter, and a touch of the inexplicable. Arlo, the man of the hour every hour, became something of a celebrity. With his newfound status, he took his eccentricities to new heights. He donned a pinstripe suit that wavered between outlandish and outright spectacle, with a top hat that had its own weather system. The carnival thrived for weeks, an endless masquerade where reality tip-toed around fantasy with courtly grace. Arlo’s infamy swelled like a baking bread left to rise too long in the warm cupboard of local legend. Things, however, took a turn for the peculiar when it became apparent that the merry-go-round refused to let anyone off. The tabby-toucan hybrids squawked meows in what seemed perpetually looped amusement. Confections grew back as soon as they were plucked from the lollipop trees. What was once delight teetered on the verge of a conundrum wrapped in a riddle and deep-fried in confectionery sugar. Arlo watched over his creation from atop his high-top-hat perch, scratching his chin as if pondering the nutritional value of a plastic apple. One midsummer night, as the perpetual festivities beat on, a peculiar figure emerged from the shadows—a woman with eyes that wouldn’t stay one color, and hair that defied gravity as successfully as Arlo’s hat. She sidled up to Arlo and whispered something that made him go paler than an undercooked biscuit. The next morning, the carnival was gone. It vanished, as if it had been sucked back into the void of a magician’s pocket. No merry-go-round, no tabby-toucans, not even the lingering sweetness of phantom cotton candy on the breeze. The townsfolk stood agape in the town square, neither a stripe nor a sweet in sight. “But where did it go?” lamented Mrs. Higgins, officially out of a job as a tabby-toucan feeder. Arlo, back in his pre-carnival attire of a paint-smeared smock, couldn’t suppress a sheepish grin. From behind his back, he produced… was it a ticket stub? “Turns out the lady’s the Master of Fine Arts and Entertainment. She runs a traveling carnival,” he explained, “and she wanted her attractions back. Gave me one free ride as a courtesy.” Once again, Whistleridge fell under a hush. “You mean to say, it was never magic?” asked Timmy, the disillusionment blatant in his voice. Arlo’s eyes twinkled mischievously. “Oh, it was magic alright—but the kind you need to pack up and cart to the next town, come sunup.” Whispering began crowding the air, a composite murmur of awe and slight annoyance, like when you find out the tooth fairy outsources her under-the-pillow operations. In the end, Whistleridge returned to its previous state: a quiet nook in the world where surprising things sometimes happened, especially if Arlo Finch had anything to do with it. Arlo returned to his studio, back to blending shades of ‘Unsubstantiated Rumor’ and ‘Whimsical Whispers.’ And deep down, just beyond the reach of the mortal eye, he kept a single, miraculous top hat—just in case the Master of Fine Arts and Entertainment required his extraordinary services again.

Story: Set the story during a total eclipse — man-made. Fiction","output":"In the bustling hamlet of Pendleton’s Perch, known neither for its bustling nor for any significant avian populations, a total eclipse was about to occur—an event unheard of since...well, ever. This was no celestial boon granted by the intricate ballet of the cosmos; this was the first-ever man-made eclipse, slated to put Pendleton’s Perch on the map, or at least in the footnotes of an obscure science journal. Jasper Tildon, the architect of this astronomical anomaly, was neither astronomer nor astrologer. He was, in fact, a plumber with a penchant for shadow puppetry and, as fate would have it, a sudden inheritance from an uncle who dabbled in inventions that were usually as practical as a chocolate teapot. This Uncle Mortimer, a maverick in his own right, had left Jasper the blueprints for a device only referred to as “The UmbraMaker.” The boisterous preparation for the eclipse had aroused a palpable excitement, stirring the town like a large spoon in a small coffee cup, swirling with uncontainable anticipation and spilling over with speculations. “Will it summon celestial beings?” whispered Ms. Cynthia Flapdoodle, the librarian who harbored an intense passion for paranormal romance novels. “Will it finally give my snapdragons the shade they’ve been craving?” pondered Mr. Bartholomew, who talked to his plants more than he did people. And so, at precisely 2:17 PM on a Tuesday that felt like it wanted to be a Saturday, Jasper hauled the notoriously unreliable UmbraMaker to the center of town square, guiding it like a shepherd tending to a particularly cumbersome sheep. The device, a haphazard collection of gears, lenses, and what appeared to be several repurposed garden hoses, stood imposingly, casting an irregular shadow that seemingly defied the laws of physics—or at least good taste. As Jasper adjusted knobs that seemed to do more for aesthetic than function, the townspeople gathered, donning their DIY eclipse glasses crafted from cereal boxes and sheer hope. “Ladies, gentlemen, and esteemed flora,” Jasper began, his voice unsteady, betraying the confidence of his pinstriped overalls. “Today, we witness history—man commands the sun!” With a theatrical flourish, Jasper yanked a lever. A wheeze, a clank, and then...a rather unimpressive puff of smoke. The crowd’s collective anticipation deflated like a beach ball at the end of summer. But then, the impossible happened. A creeping darkness, slow and deliberate, swallowed the sun whole, leaving nothing but a slender crescent visible. A chorus of gasps, the kind usually reserved for surprise birthday parties and particularly shocking soap opera revelations, rippled through the crowd. The eclipse was breathtaking—an artwork painted on the vast canvas of the sky. The stars, usually resigned to the night shift, twinkled cheekily as they made an impromptu daytime appearance. In the shadowed silence of awe, young Molly Peterson, known for her indefatigable curiosity and gumption, tugged at Jasper’s overalls. “Mr. Tildon, how did you know this would work?” Jasper, still marveling at his own success, chuckled. “Well, Molly, sometimes you just have to trust in a little bit of magic…and a lot in mechanical engineering principles.” The shared experience of the eclipse brought the townspeople closer, a common ground found in a moment of shared wonder. Conversations flowed more freely, laughter bubbled up easier, and for a brief period, the world seemed a softer, kinder place—one cloaked in twilight mystery and the promise of shared secrets. But as with all things, the eclipse came to an end. The sun, perhaps feeling upstaged, returned with a luminous vengeance, its rays like the final act of a concert encore. The UmbraMaker, having fulfilled its purpose, gave one last sputter of defiance before going silent. Pendleton’s Perch returned to its pre-eclipse routine, but something had shifted. Children played with more gusto, adults greeted each other with warmer smiles, and even the local flora seemed to stand a bit taller, as if rejuvenated by the brief respite from the sun. Jasper, now hailed as a local hero, found himself at the center of attention, fielding questions about his next grand invention. “Well,” he mused, scratching his chin in thought, “I’ve been considering something for winter. How do you folks feel about artificial Northern Lights?” Laughter and cheers answered him, a testament to the small town’s newfound appetite for wonder. But here’s the twist—remember the UmbraMaker’s unimpressive puff of smoke? It wasn’t part of the plan. Unbeknownst to Jasper, the UmbraMaker had sprung a leak, releasing a mild hallucinogenic — a result of Uncle Mortimer’s less conventional experiments. What the townspeople experienced wasn’t a man-made eclipse but a collective journey of the mind, a shared dream under the noonday sun. When Jasper discovered the truth, evidenced by the untouched sun in photographs taken by neighboring towns, he faced a philosophical conundrum. Did the reality of the experience diminish its impact? Was the beauty of the moment any less real, any less poignant? In the end, Jasper chose to keep the secret, realizing that sometimes the value of an experience lies not in its objective truth but in its emotional resonance, in the connections it fosters and the joy it brings. And so, Pendleton’s Perch remained a little brighter, a touch kinder, buoyed by the memory of an eclipse that never was but had been felt, deeply and truly, by all. In the heart of Pendleton’s Perch, a plaque was erected next to the now-retired UmbraMaker. It read: “In honor of the day we all stood in the shadow, only to find ourselves standing in the light.” And Jasper? He continued to tinker, to dream, to occasionally induce accidental mass hallucinations. But above all, he reminded his fellow townspeople that magic, in whatever form it takes, is real—as real as the laughter of friends and the warmth of shared moments. For in the end, isn’t that the true magic of Pendleton’s Perch?"},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Запишите предложения, продолжите мысль, начатую в тесте развейте ее, описав значимость и необходимость для общества специальности, на которой вы обучаетесь (4-5 предложений) БАНКОВСКОЕ ДЕЛЛ .

Garfield is disappointed.} The author writes: ----Credits Jim Davis - Original Garfield strip, and creator of Garfield Humon - creator of Scandinavia and the World AmericanButterfly - Original Scandinavia and the World fanart Original Scandinavia and the World fanart: Group Photo Original Garfield strips: 2006-06-19 (a Birthday strip), 2024-02-15.","output":"The modified Garfield comic you described is a unique blend of humor and crossover fan content that combines the classic setup of a Garfield comic strip with elements from other creative works, humorously playing with fan expectations and popular internet culture. 1. **Setting the Scene**: The strip starts with a typical Garfield setting — Jon speaking to Garfield, with Odie present, all wearing birthday hats and a cake between them, suggesting a festive or celebration theme. 2. **Subversion of Expectation**: Jon begins in a way that seems to lead into a typical comic setup (\\"Instead of all those crossovers...\\"), which makes the reader think about common tropes in media franchises, including unexpected or fan-desired crossovers between different series. Garfield's happy reaction suggests he's pleased with avoiding such crossovers, perhaps reflecting a contentment with simplicity or a dislike of the often complicated nature of crossover narratives. 3. **Modern Internet Culture Reference**: Jon's mention that the creator is likely busy playing Bloons TD 6 is a direct nod to modern leisure activities, specifically video gaming, and indirectly suggests why the comic would take an unexpected turn or why the usual content might be on pause. 4. **Introducing the Crossover**: Despite the initial setup against crossovers, Jon then introduces a crossover anyway, presenting \\"sh*tty fanart\\" of characters from Scandinavia and the World—a webcomic by Humon that personifies countries and explores cultural and political themes through humor and character interaction. This action is both an acknowledgment of fan creativity and a playful breach of Garfield's expectation of maintaining status quo. 5. **Humorous Discomfort and Cliffhanger**: The final frame shows Garfield in bed, suggesting that the introduction of these new characters and the manner it was done (through low-quality fan art) was unsettling or incompatible with his world, humorously depicted as his \\"worst nightmare ever.\\" The \\"To be continued...\\" caption adds a layer of comedic suspense. Overall, this comic strip playfully critiques and engages with several aspects relevant to contemporary media culture: - The abundant occurrence of unlikely or demanded crossovers in fiction. - The intersection of creators' real-life activities (like playing video games) with their creative output. - The vibrant and unpredictable world of fan content generation and its reception by original content characters. - The comedic potential of integrating well-known characters from vastly different series, testing the boundaries of their universes in a humorous and self-aware manner. The credits subtly remind the reader of the collaborative and intertextual nature of modern media, where original works by creators like Jim Davis and Humon can inspire new, hybrid forms of creativity and entertainment in the hands of fans like AmericanButterfly."},{"instruction":"no fluff. give me a 400 to 500 word break down of the farm bill legalizing hemp for sale across the country.","output":"The 2018 Farm Bill, officially known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, was signed into law on December 20, 2018. This legislation legalized the production of hemp at the federal level, which had previously been classified as a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. One of the key provisions of the 2018 Farm Bill is the removal of hemp from the list of controlled substances, effectively decriminalizing the cultivation, production, and sale of hemp-derived products. Hemp is defined as the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including seeds, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. With the legalization of hemp, farmers across the country can now legally grow and cultivate the crop for commercial purposes. This opens up a new market opportunity for farmers, as hemp can be used in a wide range of industries, including textiles, construction materials, paper, biofuels, and health and wellness products. In addition to the legalization of hemp production, the 2018 Farm Bill also grants states the authority to regulate hemp cultivation within their borders. States can now submit plans to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for approval, outlining their regulations for licensing, testing, and monitoring hemp producers. This allows states to tailor their hemp programs to meet the specific needs and priorities of their agricultural industry. Furthermore, the 2018 Farm Bill also removes restrictions on the sale, transport, and possession of hemp-derived products, including CBD (cannabidiol) products. CBD is a non-intoxicating compound found in hemp that has been widely touted for its potential health and wellness benefits. With the legalization of hemp, the CBD market has experienced significant growth, with a wide range of products now available for purchase across the country. Overall, the legalization of hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill has had a significant impact on the agricultural industry, providing farmers with a new crop to grow and opening up new market opportunities for hemp-derived products. With the removal of regulatory barriers and the ability for states to regulate hemp cultivation, the industry is poised for continued growth and innovation in the years to come."},{"instruction":"restate the paper with a positive light on retail hemp sales. and include relative n formation on hemp sales in texas.","output":"The 2018 Farm Bill, passed on December 20, 2018, has brought about a positive shift in the retail landscape by legalizing hemp production and sales across the country. This legislation has removed hemp from the list of controlled substances, allowing farmers to cultivate and sell hemp-derived products legally. Hemp, with a THC concentration of no more than 0.3 percent, is now a viable crop for farmers across the United States. In Texas, the legalization of hemp has led to a booming retail market for CBD and other hemp-derived products. Consumers in Texas are increasingly turning to hemp products for their purported health and wellness benefits. Retailers in the state have capitalized on this trend by offering a wide range of hemp products, including CBD oils, edibles, topicals, and more. The removal of restrictions on the sale and possession of hemp-derived products has created a flourishing market in Texas, with retailers and consumers alike benefiting from the increased availability of these products. The state's agricultural industry has also seen a boost as farmers embrace hemp cultivation as a new opportunity for growth and diversification. Furthermore, the ability for states to regulate hemp cultivation has allowed Texas to tailor its hemp program to meet the specific needs of its agricultural sector. By submitting a plan to the USDA for approval, Texas has implemented regulations for licensing, testing, and monitoring hemp producers, ensuring the quality and safety of hemp-derived products in the state. Overall, the legalization of hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill has had a positive impact on the retail industry in Texas and beyond. The retail market for hemp products is thriving, providing consumers with access to a diverse array of CBD and hemp-derived products. With the regulatory framework in place and a growing consumer demand, the future of hemp sales in Texas looks bright, offering continued opportunities for retailers and farmers in the state."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this discord convo but it's set in Neon Genesis Evangelion, keep the original format \\"M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:09 PM you wanna call? lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:09 PM yo i got an idea maybe u should get this game its pretty fire and free M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:10 PM ok lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:10 PM think about it tho if i have more spare time ill hop on with u M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:12 PM It's much less file size than the last game I downloaded lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:12 PM fr M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:12 PM Idk if I'll have time to play today tho hopefully M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:19 PM can you share your screen so I can see what the game is like? lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:21 PM https://youtu.be/DiSDlPc7r0g YouTube PlayStation The Finals - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games Image there ya go didnt want to go through the trouble trailers rlly accurate too ikr M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:22 PM battle royale? lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:22 PM 3v3v3 or more u collect coins and deposit them for steal cubes and deposite look into it its rlly cool M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:36 PM GNOMES ARE IN THE GAME!?!1! lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:37 PM lol since when?

The SSA houses sensitive information, including Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and personal data of millions of Americans, making it a high-profile target for cybercriminals. Despite this, the SSA has managed to avoid the kind of large-scale data breaches that have affected other institutions and government agencies. However, it is essential to note that while the SSA itself might not have been the direct victim of a large-scale hack, Social Security Numbers and other personal information have been exposed through breaches of other entities. For example, the Equifax breach in 2017 exposed the sensitive personal data of approximately 147 million people, including SSNs. Such incidents indirectly affect the security of Social Security information by increasing the risk of identity theft and fraudulent activities. The SSA, like other government agencies, continually updates and strengthens its cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks and unauthorized access. Nonetheless, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks means that the potential for future breaches exists, and individuals should remain vigilant about their personal information security. This includes monitoring credit reports, using strong, unique passwords for online accounts, and being cautious of phishing attempts and scams asking for personal information."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this discord convo but it's set in RDR2, keep the original format \\"M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:09 PM you wanna call? lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:09 PM yo i got an idea maybe u should get this game its pretty fire and free M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:10 PM ok lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:10 PM think about it tho if i have more spare time ill hop on with u M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:12 PM It's much less file size than the last game I downloaded lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:12 PM fr M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:12 PM Idk if I'll have time to play today tho hopefully M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:19 PM can you share your screen so I can see what the game is like? lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:21 PM https://youtu.be/DiSDlPc7r0g YouTube PlayStation The Finals - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games Image there ya go didnt want to go through the trouble trailers rlly accurate too ikr M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:22 PM battle royale? lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:22 PM 3v3v3 or more u collect coins and deposit them for steal cubes and deposite look into it its rlly cool M_717 — 01/07/2024 2:36 PM GNOMES ARE IN THE GAME!?!1! lemoldyboi — 01/07/2024 2:37 PM lol since when?

Vavken,Rok Likar, Blaž Grabnar 1 Uvod # 1.2 Poudarki (Alen) - Kakšen je bil načrt za to iteracijo? - Kaj je ekipa dosegla? V tej iteraciji smo se osredotočili na implementacijo glavnih funkcionalnosti storitve servis48: prijava in registracija uporabnikov ter pregled in ustvarjanje pobud. Poleg tega smo namenili čas tudi dodatnemu učenju izbranega osrednjega ogrodja Angular in postavitvi lastnega strežnika z API klici za nalaganje in pridobivanje podatkov iz podatkovne baze. Vse načrtovano smo uspešno implementirali, napor, ki pa je še ostajal, smo preusmerili v implementacijo funkcionalnosti naslednjih iteracij: trgovina in stran za delavce/admina. Teh dodatnih funkcionalnosti nismo še dokončali, nam bo pa zgodnji začetek olajšal delo v naslednjih iteracijah. # 1.3 Spremembe (Blaž) Ker je cilj projekta izboljšava trenutne storitve Servis48, smo že na začetku uporabili \\"reverse-engineering\\" za zajem večine funkcionalnosti, hkrati pa smo že takrat zajeli tudi naročnikove želje po izboljšavi storitve, zato spremembe v tej iteraciji niso bile potrebne. 2 Potrebe naročnika (Tjaž) Glede na povratne informacije naročnika po prvi iteraciji smo opazili naslednje potrebe naročnika: 1. Omogočanje oddaje pobud oz. obvestil o težavah zgolj prijavljenim uporabnikom ter filtriranje in zavračanje neprimernih vsebin 2. Avtomatizacija procesa komunikacije in dodeljevanja nalog odgovornim na različnih področjih delovanja MOC znotraj aplikacije. Poenostavljen postopek nadzora nad opravljenimi deli in statusi pobud. 3. Nadzorni center za izvajalce, odgovorne in administratorje za hitrejšo obravnavo pobud in težav, ki vključuje tudi razne statistike. 3 Cilji projekta (Tjaž) Cilje smo bili, zaradi sprememb v željah naročnika, primorani nekoliko spremeniti. Vseeno pa bomo ohranili določene funkcionalnosti, kot smo si jih začrtali v prvi iteraciji: 1. Spremljanje napredka predloga občana z obveščanjem (obveščanje občana o statusu njegove pobude/opažene težave preko e-pošte). 2. Sistemizacija nagrajevanja proaktivnih občanov z dodeljevanjem točk in možnostjo unovčenja le-teh. 3. Sistem \\"všečkanja\\" pobud oz. glasovanja za izvedbo pobude 4. Sistem prioretizacije pobud glede na razširjenost in zanimanje za izvedbo pobude (število glasov) Poleg teh bomo podprli tudi dodatne zahteve naročnika, torej: 1. Omejili bomo oddajanje pobud zgolj na prijavljene uporabnike in neprimerne ter zlonamerne pobude samodejno izločili iz prikaza 2. Razširili bomo tudi funkcionalnosti administrativnega vmesnika, ki bo omogočal: dodeljevanje posameznih pobud/težav odgovornim znotraj aplikacije, avtomatiziran proces dodeljevanja pobud v upravljanje določenim sektorjem, prikaz statističnih podatkov o pobudah/težavah, obveščanje koordinatorjev in izvajalcev o novih pobudah in prikaz trenutnega stanja pobud glede an zadolžitve (stanje pobude: opravljeno, v teku, nedodeljeno) # 3.1 Primeri uporabe (Maks nariše v PlantUML, ko se združi od vseh) - Pripravite slovar pojmov z natančno opredelitvijo vseh têrminov, ki jih boste uporabljali. - Opredelite uporabniške vloge glede na funkcionalnosti, ki jih imajo na voljo. - Zapišite primer uporabe za vsak osrednji cilj primarnega oz. sekundarnega naročnika. - Pri vsakem primeru uporabe opredelitev naslov, cilj uporabnika in osnovni tok. Izberite opisne naslove primerov uporabe. - Pri alternativnih tokih dogodkov na vašem seznamu želja za implementacijo določite zgolj naslov, opis v enem stavku in kako se alternativni tok povezuje s pripadajočim osnovnim tokom. - Narišite **diagram primerov uporabe** ([Use Case Diagram](https://plantuml.com/use-case-diagram), izvorna koda :bar_chart: [PlantUML](./gradivo/plantuml/DPU.puml)) ![DPU](https://teaching.lavbic.net/plantuml/svg/VP9DJiCm48NtFiKeRCWYbP8c4c9HzGTOLofXWTYuoJGrTUngOgj8m64u3FV2ZbCf0jIDfRptlPdesVFES3AsbN2tBXdh3a8TEV4MjhmwDAIjgYijDO4XhZfdeJ8ZgiOTjz8yufjPID6erjbGkGDfHDaEAzuXl3COpLtrSqzxOT3hccgae5qL3ykR-vLJEP4-1N4hNP9zZiRoocXQZd81-Gtykv19t1am6aWqUmEr8AoCq8gnFWHHUTJ4jqeS88rWiO4o_UjamSdEphDLNBsA5zM9pc0x93SfOtuwLur4Y9xuznS48EeRERSJhKcqI2_AzWjmYA_TvWjGDa3P9MWwGDDBK3v0-IMe6A32tGGhCqXyZyd7pFV3oXII6LoxFuvxBtnaCNDd7aDIwvDocY_4ATCO9lOu6G9m2-uHeQgzLJWh6BatXAgahN5malxA_CumdCrTohtW7m00) 4 Opis sistema (vsak napiše svoj del, kasneje družimo) - Predstavite sistem in glavne izzive. 5 Trenutno stanje (vsak svoje) - Kakšni dodatni cilji te iteracije, poleg tega, kar je že navedeno v [uvodu](#1-uvod)? - Kaj deluje? Vključite posnetke zaslona. (vsak screenshota feature, k ga je nrdu). Lahko dodamo sliko sheme podatkovne baze in dokumentacije - Kakšni izzivi? - Uporabite blokovni diagram za razlago trenutnega sistema. - (Maks) Dodamo OpenStreetMap kot zunanji vir, poenotit vse database, iz home page naj gre na register direkt, damo vn upvote ticket - Katere teste ste izvedli?

Alen: Uporabnik se ob zagonu aplikacije Servis48 znajde na glavni strani (home). Nekatere elemente strani smo črpali iz produkcijske različice servis48 in jim osvežili postavitev. Neprijavljeni uporabnik lahko na levi strani vidi krajši seznam najbolj aktivnih (trenutno je naključno) pobud, na desni pa preoblikovano pozdravno stran za servis48. Pod opisom storitve ima na voljo gumbe za pregled pobud in pomoč. Prijavljeni uporabniki vidijo tudi tretji gumb za ustvarjanje nove pobude. ![image](https://github.com/TPO-2023-2024/Projekt-05/assets/99842431/583c364b-0f98-4271-8332-972f409adff1) Sistem sedaj omogoča prijavo uporabnika z uporabniškim imenom in geslom. Ob napačnih prijavnih podatkih je obveščen z modalnim oknom, sicer se mu aplikacija osveži in ga pelje na glavno stran (home), tokrat v vlogi prijavljenega uporabnika. ![image](https://github.com/TPO-2023-2024/Projekt-05/assets/99842431/8bbdb283-afce-4eb0-ac01-a7c8c5f80e4b) Neprijavljen uporabnik se lahko registrira s klikom na gumb za registracijo. V modalno okno vpiše naslednje podatke: uporabniško ime, geslo, email, fizični naslov in telefon. Ob pravilnem vnosu podatkov, se mu omogoči gumb za izvedbo registracije, ki uporabnika ob kliku obvesti o uspelosti registracije. ![image](https://github.com/TPO-2023-2024/Projekt-05/assets/99842431/9d494425-46a8-4ca9-ab33-30068e94ad21) ![image](https://github.com/TPO-2023-2024/Projekt-05/assets/99842431/15c9510d-1f72-45a5-893f-adb74c13d4c0) ![image](https://github.com/TPO-2023-2024/Projekt-05/assets/99842431/85e97a1e-7a73-4d1a-9549-2d8179313047) Prijavljen uporabnik ima na voljo gumb za ustvarjanje nove pobude, ki ob kliku odpre novo modalno okno z obrazcem za podatke naslednje obvezne podatke o pobudi: tip, izbira težave ali predloga, naslova in vsebine. Uporabnik lahko opcijsko na priloženem interaktivnem zemljevidu s klikom izbere lokacijo pobude, se naroči na elektronsko obveščanje o spremembah stanja pobude in priloži sliko. S klikom na gumb za končanje postopka ustvarjanja pobude je uporabnik obveščen o uspelosti zahteve v modalnem oknu. ![image](https://github.com/TPO-2023-2024/Projekt-05/assets/99842431/8f1aa787-682e-4da8-83fe-c373542b40f3) ![image](https://github.com/TPO-2023-2024/Projekt-05/assets/99842431/5db74d25-4426-4929-a55d-d65bff26bb7d) # Testiranje # Ker se kot ekipa še učimo pisanja testov, smo testirali le nekatere dele aplikacije. Na vsako funkcionalnost obstaja en enotski test, ki preveri, če se komponenta uspešno ustvari. Drugi enotski testi pa se fokusirajo na izpolnjevanje obrazcev za ustvarjanje pobude in registracije. Test za ustvarjanje pobude preverja, da je gumb za dokončanje postopka izpolnjevanja podatkov o pobudi onemogočen, dokler niso vsi potrebni podatki vpisani. Test za registracijo uporabnika preverja, da so vsa polja vpisana in ustrezajo specifičnim regularnim izrazom ter se šele nato omogoči gumb za izvedbo registracije. 6 Vodenje projekta (vsak napiše svoje v dnevnik sprememb) (Blaž) _Nadaljujte z vzdrževanjem **dnevnika sprememb**. Dodaje vse nove spremembe v projektu, kjer vključite datum, opis, motivacijo in posledico vsake spremembe._ - Prikažite dnevnik sprememb do tega trenutka. - Kakšni so cilji za naslednjo iteracijo? - Kakšen je načrt za preostanek semestra? # 6.2 Projektni načrt (Maks) - Posodobljen Ganttov diagram in graf PERT. Updejt progressa, dat vn iz Perta kar ni treba, dodat kritično pot po Ganttu. 7 Ekipa (vsak svoje) - Kakšne so bile vloge v ekipi za to iteracijo? - Kaj je prispeval vsak član ekipe? (vsak napiše svoje) - Navedite grobo oceno prispevka posameznega člana ekipe v odstotkih. Tjaž: 20 Alen: 20 Blaž: 20 Maks: 20 Roki: 20 Tjaž: Priprava testnega ter produkcijskega strežnika. Izdelava API vmesnikov (prijava in registracija uporabnika, oddaja in izpis pobud) za komunikacijo s front-end prikazom, načrt in izgradnja podatkovne baze. Priprava dokumentacije za API vmesnike. Alen: Postavitev ogrodja glavne strani, implementacija prijave in registracije uporabnikov, dodajanje pobud, vse omenjeno povezano s klici z našim API-jem, pisanje testov registracije in ustvarjanja pobud. 9 Refleksija (Rok) Največja težava učenje angularja - Kaj je šlo po pričakovanjih? - Kaj ni šlo po pričakovanjih? - Kakšne težave so se pojavile pri ciljih, ki jih niste dosegli? - Kako nameravate premagati te težave? - Kaj boste naredili drugače v naslednji iteraciji? - Prva iteracija je šla po pričakovanjih.
