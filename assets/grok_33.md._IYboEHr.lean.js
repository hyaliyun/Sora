Given that the production ratios for regular medical masks and surgical masks are 80% and 20% respectively, and the proportions of strap masks within these categories are 10% and 20% respectively, we can calculate the overall probability of selecting a strap mask as follows: - The probability of selecting a strap mask from the regular medical masks is the product of the probability of selecting a regular medical mask and the probability that it is a strap mask, which is 0.8 times 0.1. - Similarly, the probability of selecting a strap mask from the surgical masks is the product of the probability of selecting a surgical mask and the probability that it is a strap mask, which is 0.2 times 0.2.

We aim to determine ( E(100) ).  **Step 1: Base Case** For ( n = 1 ): - Since there is only 1 block, no splitting is possible. - Therefore, ( E(1) = 0 ). **Step 2: Recursion Formula** For ( n geq 2 ): - Stan can split an ( n )-block stack into two stacks of ( a ) and ( b ) blocks, where ( a + b = n ) and ( a, b geq 1 ). - He gains a score of ( ab ) from this split. After the split, he will be left with stacks of sizes ( a ) and ( b ) which will independently continue the same game. We express the expected score ( E(n) ) in terms of the expected scores of the smaller stacks ( E(a) ) and ( E(b) ) after the split. Because the game process is step-by-step additive, we can write: [ E(n) = E(a) + E(b) + ab ] Specifically, for all possible splits, the total sum of splits and expected values needs to be considered. **Step 3: Hypothesis and Induction** We hypothesize that: [ E(n) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] We will verify this by induction. **Base Case Verification:** - For ( n = 1 ): [ E(1) = frac{1 times (1-1)}{2} = frac{0}{2} = 0  ] This holds true, as already discussed. **Inductive Step:** Assume ( E(k) = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ) holds for all ( k ) such that ( 1 leq k < n ). We need to show it holds for ( n ). Considering a single split where the stack of ( n ) blocks is divided into ( k ) and ( n-k ): [ E(n) = E(k) + E(n-k) + k(n-k) ] Substituting the hypothesis ( E(k) = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ) and ( E(n-k) = frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} ): [ E(n) = frac{k(k-1)}{2} + frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} + k(n-k) ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ E(n) = frac{k^2 - k + n^2 - nk - n + k + 2nk - k^2}{2} = frac{n^2 - n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] Thus, our hypothesis holds true. **Step 4: Final Calculation** Now given that: [ E(n) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] For ( n = 100 ): [ E(100) = frac{100 times 99}{2} = 4950 ] # Conclusion: The expected value of Stan's score at the end of the game is (boxed{4950})."},{"instruction":"On Friday, Hank opened his usedbicycle store with a stock of bicycles, all fixedup and ready to ride.

The sum of the numbers on each arc is divisible by the product of the numbers on the arc following it in the clockwise direction. What is the greatest possible value of the largest number written?","output":":  1. **Introduction and Restatement of the Problem:**      On a circle, there are placed 1000 non-intersecting arcs. On each of these arcs, two natural numbers are written. The sum of the numbers on each arc is divisible by the product of the numbers of the subsequent arc (in the clockwise direction). The question asks for the largest possible value of the numbers written on these arcs. 2. **Main Claim to Prove:**     We need to show that the numbers on these arcs do not exceed 2001. 3. **Lemma 1 and Proof:**     Let's state and prove Lemma 1 which will help in the subsequent arguments.      **Lemma:** If ( x ) and ( y ) are natural numbers such that ( xy = x + y ), then ( x = y = 2 ). Further, if ( xy < x+y ), then at least one of ( x ) or ( y ) is equal to 1.      **Proof of Lemma 1:**      Consider the inequality ( xy leq x + y ). We can rewrite this as:    [    xy - x - y + 1 leq 1 implies (x-1)(y-1) leq 1    ]    The cases to consider are:    - If ( (x-1)(y-1) = 0 ), then one of ( x ) or ( y ) equals 1.    - If ( (x-1)(y-1) = 1 ), solving this leads to ( x = y = 2 ).      Therefore, ( x = y = 2 ) or at least one of the numbers ( x ), ( y ) is 1.  4. **Lemma 2 and Proof:**    **Lemma:** If ( xy = c ) where ( x > 0, y > 0, ) and ( x leq y ), then the sum ( x + y ) decreases as ( x ) increases.    **Proof of Lemma 2:**      Consider the function ( f(x) = x + frac{c}{x} ). Notice that:    [    f(x) = left(sqrt{frac{c}{x}} - xright)^2 + 2sqrt{c}    ]    This function is decreasing on the interval ( (0, sqrt{c}) ). Hence, as ( x ) increases ( f(x) = x + y ) decreases. 5. **Main Proof Construction:**    - Let ( a ) and ( b ) be the numbers on each arc, with the relationship that ( frac{a+b}{cd} ) (sum of the current arc divided by the product of the subsequent arc numbers) is an integer.    - We will demonstrate the bound via pairs ( (1, k) ). 6. **Cycle Formation and Product-Sum Argument:**    - Following the above lemmas, assume we encounter pairs ( (1, k) ). As we move clockwise:      - Pairs evolve as ( (1, k+1), (1, k+2), ldots, (1, k+999) )      - Forming the cycle, ( k+1000 ) must be divisible by ( k ), hence ( k leq 1000 )      - Thus, ( k+999 leq 1999 ) 7. **Conclusion in the Second Case:**    - In this case, a pair differing from ( (1, l+1) ) emerges where sum-product relationships still hold.    - Calculations end up showing ( s_{1000} leq 1000 + frac{1}{2}(l+1) ) and ( s_{1000} geq l )    - Verifying these bounds by contradiction or exhaustive search, ensuring each number remains ( leq 2001 ). 8. **Final Bound Verification:**    - Any arc number can be at most ( 2001 ):      - Example construction ( (1, 2001), (2, 1001), ldots ) ensures bounds without contradictions. # Conclusion: The theoretical upper limit and tangible practical example both confirm that the highest number written on these arcs does not exceed: [ boxed{2001} ]"},{"instruction":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, where a_1 = 29 and S_{10} = S_{20}, find the maximum value of the sum of the first n terms of this sequence.","output":"To solve this problem, let us denote the common difference of the arithmetic sequence as d. We know that the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:  a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. The sum of the first n terms (denoted S_n) can be calculated as: S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n).  Given that S_{10} = S_{20}, we can set up equations for both sums.  For S_{10}, we have: S_{10} = frac{10}{2}(a_1 + a_{10}) = 5(a_1 + a_1 + 9d) = 5(29 + 29 + 9d) = 290 + 45d.  For S_{20}, we have: S_{20} = frac{20}{2}(a_1 + a_{20}) = 10(a_1 + a_1 + 19d) = 10(29 + 29 + 19d) = 580 + 190d.  According to the given information, S_{10} = S_{20}. Hence, we can equate the two expressions: 290 + 45d = 580 + 190d. Solving the equation for d, we get: 145d = 290 Rightarrow d=2.  Now, since no specific value of n is provided for calculating the maximum sum, we understand the maximum sum of the arithmetic sequence will be at the point where S_n starts to decrease due to the nature of S_{10} = S_{20}.  If d > 0, the sum S_n increases as n increases, but here since S_{10}=S_{20}, and we found d=2, this means after the 20th term, the sum S_n will start decreasing as additional terms will start subtracting a larger amount due to negative terms of the sequence after the 20th term (considering S_{10} = S_{20} signifies the sequence has started to introduce negative numbers and increasing their magnitude). Thus, the maximum sum of the first n terms is S_{20}, which is: S_{20} = 580 + 190d = 580 + 190(2) = 580 + 380 = 960.

An annulus is a ring-shaped object, which in this case has been divided into 14 distinct regions. 2. These regions are arranged in such a way that each region is adjacent to at least two other regions (or more depending on the specific division).  Step 2: Graph coloring problem This problem can be related to a graph coloring problem, where each region represents a vertex and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding regions are adjacent. The goal is to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.  Step 3: Minimum colors for non-planar graph  1. The annulus can be a non-planar graph because of the cyclic nature and possible adjacency of regions from both sides. 2.

However, there exist configurations like the one shown that might need more.  Step 4: Attempting with fewer colors 1. **Using 3 colors**: We need to consider whether it's possible to color the annulus with just 3 colors:     - Let's label the colors as 1, 2, and 3.     - Try coloring the regions one by one ensuring no adjacent regions share the same color. If you attempt this, you would find that it is not possible as there will be at least one pair of adjacent regions which will share the same color no matter how you assign the 3 colors. This indicates that 3 colors are not enough.  Step 5: Using 4 colors Let's consider using 4 colors. 1. **Using 4 colors**: Label the colors as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Proceed by coloring each region while ensuring no two adjacent regions share the same color. Here is a step-by-step color assignment:     - Assign color 1 to the first region.     - For each subsequent region, choose from colors 2, 3, or 4 ensuring it does not match the color of any of its adjacent regions. By carefully assigning the colors this way, it is possible to color the entire annulus such that no two adjacent regions have the same color.  Conclusion: Through the above steps, it can be concluded that 3 colors are insufficient to meet the requirement, but it is possible to achieve the desired coloring with 4 colors. [ boxed{B} ] Thus, the minimum number of colors needed to paint the annulus so that no two adjacent regions share the same color is 4."},{"instruction":"A contractor is engaged for 30 days on the condition that he receives Rs. 25 for each day he works and is fined Rs. 7.50 for each day he is absent.

The probability of drawing a red ball can be represented as the ratio of the number of red balls to the total number of balls, which gives us the equation: [ frac{4}{4 + x} = 0.25 ] Solving this equation for x involves multiplying both sides by 4 + x to get rid of the denominator and then simplifying: [ 4 = 0.25(4 + x) ] Multiplying out the right side gives: [ 4 = 1 + 0.25x ] Subtracting 1 from both sides to isolate the term with x: [ 3 = 0.25x ] Dividing both sides by 0.25 to solve for x: [ x = frac{3}{0.25} = 12 ] Therefore, the number of white balls in the bag is boxed{12}."},{"instruction":"Replace the letters I, K, S with digits such that the following subtraction is correct: [ begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}   & K & I & S   & S & I & K  hline   & S & K & I  end{array} ]","output":"We need to find the digits for I, K, and S such that the following subtraction is correct: [ begin{array}{r}   K phantom{0} I phantom{0} S phantom{-}  - phantom{-} S phantom{-} I phantom{-} K phantom{=}   overline{S phantom{-} K phantom{-} I} end{array} ] Let's break down the steps: 1. **Step 1: Identify constraints from the subtraction.**     From the subtraction setup:     [     KIS - SIK = SKI     ]     Notice that for place values to be consistent and meaningful three-digit subtraction, the result should be another three-digit number. 2. **Step 2: Analyze the units column (right-most digits) subtraction.**     [     S - K = I     ]     Since we are dealing with digits (0-9), the result I must be a single digit and non-negative.  3. **Step 3: Analyze the tens column subtraction.**     The carry from the subtraction in the units digit column must be considered.

We need to calculate how many possible k-hit bets can be generated from 13 matches. 2. To construct a k-hit bet, we first select k matches from the 13. This can be accomplished in binom{13}{k} ways:    [    binom{13}{k} = frac{13!}{k!(13-k)!}    ] 3. In these k selected matches, we put in the correct results. 4. For the remaining 13 - k matches, each match can have any of the 2 incorrect results. Therefore, for each of these 13 - k matches, there are 2 choices (either of the two incorrect results). Hence, the total number of ways to fill in the incorrect results is:    [    2^{13 - k}    ] 5.

Next, we need to compare the number of bets for successive values of k to find where the maximum occurs. 2. Specifically, we need to compare T_k and T_{k+1}. To do this, we compute the ratio:    [    frac{T_{k+1}}{T_k} = frac{binom{13}{k+1} cdot 2^{13 - (k+1)}}{binom{13}{k} cdot 2^{13 - k}}    ] 3.

We begin by expressing the relationship between the sides in terms of their lengths:      2|AC| = |BC| + |AB| 2. We know the distance between points A and C is:      |AC| = |(1, 0) - (-1, 0)| = 2 3. Substituting the expression for |AC| into the initial relationship, we get:    2 times 2 = |BC| + |AB|    4 = |BC| + |AB| 4. This implies that the sum of |BC| and |AB| is greater than |AC|, which means that the points A, B, and C cannot be collinear. 5. Since A and C are the foci of the trajectory, and by the properties of an ellipse, for any point B on the ellipse, the sum of the distances |AB| and |BC| must be constant, and greater than the distance between the foci, vertex B traces out an ellipse with foci at A and C. 6. To find the equation of the ellipse, we consider that A and C are on the x-axis and symmetric about the y-axis. We let 2a be the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci. Thus, in this case, 2a = 4. The center of the ellipse is at the origin (0, 0), and the distance from the center to the foci is c = |AC|/2 = 1. 7. The semi-major axis a is half the sum of the distances, so a = 4/2 = 2 and the semi-minor axis b can be calculated using c^2 = a^2 - b^2:    1 = 2^2 - b^2    b^2 = 2^2 - 1^2    b^2 = 4 - 1 = 3    b = sqrt{3} 8.

We seek to determine whether this deviation from the expected 2020 appearances of heads can be considered random or if it is due to a systematic cause. 2. **Departure Check for Empirical and Theoretical Frequency**:    The observed deviation will be considered random if the probability that deviation of the number of heads from 2020 in 4040 tosses is equal to or greater than that observed by Buffon is significantly large. Let m represent the number of heads in 4040 tosses.

Without loss of generality, assume this number is formed from the digits of one specific column. The sum of the digits of this column, hence, is not divisible by 3. 3. **Others are Divisible by 3**:     - By assumption, the digits in all other columns (and thus the numbers formed from those columns) sum up to numbers divisible by 3.     - Similarly, apply this condition to the rows: in each row, the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. 4. **Sum Analysis**:     - Consider the sum of all the digits in the grid. Each of the ten rows yields numbers divisible by 3, implying that their sum, say ( S_r ), is divisible by 3.     - Each of the nine columns (excluding the one assumed not divisible by 3), also must therefore yield column sums divisible by 3, implying their total sum ( S_c ) excluding the special column is divisible by 3. 5. **Contradiction**:     - If we denote that the special column’s sum of digits as ( S_{nc} ) (not divisible by 3), then the total sum of all digits in the grid, ( S ), can be represented as:     [     S = S_r = S_c + S_{nc}     ]     - Since ( S_r ) is divisible by 3 and ( S_c ) is divisible by 3 but ( S_{nc} ) is not, their combined sum ( S ) would then be non-divisible by 3. This contradicts earlier when we considered sums divisible by 3 (each row sum divisible by 3 includes and sums all grid digits). 6. **Consequently**: The very assumption that there exists exactly one number (column or row combination) not divisible by 3 forces a contradiction.

Therefore, [ operatorname{lcm}(k-1, k-3, k-5) mid n ] And since ((k - 1)) is odd: [ (k-1)(k-3)(k-5) mid n ] Now, establish the bounds again: [ (k-1)(k-3)(k-5) leqslant n < (k+1)^2 ] Given (n): [ (k-1)(k-3)(k-5) leqslant k(k - 1)(k + 2) ] Solving the inequality: [ (k - 1)(k^2 - 8k + 15) leqslant k^3 + 2k^2 - k ] [ k^3 - 10k^2 + 21k - 15 leqslant k^3 + 2k^2 - k ] [ 0 leqslant 12k^2 - 21k + 15  ] Simplifying and solving polynomial: [ 12k^2 - 21k + 15 leqslant 0 ] This gives the solution range: [ -∞ < k leqslant 7 ]  Conclusion: By checking each case up to confirmed values (1 leq k leq 6) and for smaller values (k leq 7): - (n) must be checked for small values of (k).

The covariance ( mu_{xy} ) is defined as:    [    mu_{xy} = mathbb{E}left[(X - mathbb{E}[X])(Y - mathbb{E}[Y])right]    ] 3. Next, compute the expected value of ( Y ):    [    mathbb{E}[Y] = mathbb{E}[aX + b] = a mathbb{E}[X] + b    ] 4.

From town A to town B: The car traveled ( 2x ) miles and averaged 20 miles per gallon. The amount of fuel used is ( frac{2x}{20} = frac{x}{10} ) gallons. 2.

The total distance traveled is ( 2x + x = 3x ) miles, and the total fuel used is ( frac{x}{10} + frac{x}{25} ) gallons. To find the total fuel used, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 50 in this case: ( frac{x}{10} = frac{5x}{50} ) ( frac{x}{25} = frac{2x}{50} ) So the total fuel used is ( frac{5x}{50} + frac{2x}{50} = frac{7x}{50} ) gallons.

Solving the quadratic equation:        [        y = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 12}}{2} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{16}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 4}{2}        ]        This gives:        [        y = 1 quad text{or} quad y = -3 quad (text{since} , y = sqrt{a} , Rightarrow , y geq 0)        ]        Thus, (sqrt{a} = 1 Rightarrow a = 1).      - Solving (a - 2sqrt{a} = 3):        This gives no valid solutions for non-negative (a) since (sqrt{a} geq 0).    - Therefore, for (a geq 0), the possible value is (a = 1). 4. **Now, consider the case (a < 0):**    The roots in this case would be complex:    [    x = a pm 2sqrt{|a|} i    ]    For the modulus:    [    |x| = sqrt{a^2 + 4a} = 3    ]    Thus:    [    a^2 - 4a = 9    ]    Solving the quadratic equation:    [    a^2 - 4a - 9 = 0    ]    Applying the quadratic formula:    [    a = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 + 36}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{52}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{13}    ]    Since (a < 0), the valid solution is:    [    a = 2 - sqrt{13}    ] 5. **Conclusion:**    The possible values of (a) are (a = 1), (a = 9), and (a = 2 - sqrt{13}).

Therefore, our number is (n = 2^{30} cdot p).     2. By definition, a perfect number is one where the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) equals the number. So, we need to find all proper divisors of (n) and their sum. 3. The proper divisors of (n = 2^{30} cdot p) are:     [     1, 2, 2^2, ldots, 2^{29}, 2^{30}, p, 2p, 2^2 p, ldots, 2^{29} p     ] 4.

To solve the sums, we recognize them as geometric series.  6.

Next, consider the sum (S_{30}) of the terms from (1) to (2^{29}) (30 terms):     [     S_{30} = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + cdots + 2^{29}     ]     Using the same formula for the sum of a geometric series, we get:     [     S_{30} = frac{2^{30} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{30} - 1     ] 8.

This implies that A covers 1000 meters in the same time B covers 700 meters. Therefore, we can write the following equation based on their speeds and the time they take to complete their respective distances: Va * Ta = 1000 Vb * Tb = 700 Since they finish at the same time, Ta = Tb. Therefore, we can say that Va/Vb = 1000/700 = 10/7. Now, B can give C a 428.57 meters start, which means B covers 1000 meters in the same time C covers 1000 - 428.57 = 571.43 meters.

Find the minimal value of ( k ) such that the goal is attainable for every possible configuration of 4027 points.","output":"1. **Step 1: Establish Lower Bound (k ≥ 2013)**    - Consider an arrangement of 2013 red points and 2013 blue points alternately placed on the circumference of a circle, with the remaining blue point placed elsewhere in the plane.    - The circle thus is divided into 4026 arcs, each arc having different colored endpoints.    - Each of these arcs must be crossed by a line to ensure that no region contains points of both colors.    - Since a line can intersect the circle at most twice, we need at least (lceil frac{4026}{2} rceil = 2013) lines.    - Therefore, (k geq 2013). 2. **Step 2: Establish Upper Bound (k ≤ 2013)**    - **Case 1: Convex Hull with a Red Vertex**:      - Let (P) be the convex hull of all marked points.      - If there exists a red vertex (A) within (P), draw a line separating (A) from all other points.      - Pair the remaining 2012 red points and use two lines to isolate each pair (1006 pairs).      - Thus, (1 + 2 times 1006 = 2013) lines are used.    - **Case 2: Convex Hull with All Blue Vertices**:      - Assume all vertices of (P) are blue.      - Choose two consecutive blue vertices (A) and (B) on (P) and separate them from others with a line parallel to segment (AB).      - Pair up the other 2012 blue points and separate each pair (1006 pairs) using two lines each.      - Again, (1 + 2 times 1006 = 2013) lines are used. 3. **Other Configurations**:    - Instead of convex hull, use a line separating two marked points (A) and (B) such that all other points lie on one side of this line.      - If either (A) or (B) is red, use the method as in Case 1.      - If both (A) and (B) are blue, use the method as in Case 2.    - This ensures that the same line separation methods with 2013 lines can be applied regardless of the specific location of the points in the plane. 4. **Conclusion: Induction Proof**:    - We prove more generally that for any (n) points dividing the plane with colors red and blue, we need (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor) lines.    - **Base Case**: For (n leq 2), drawing zero lines is sufficient.    - **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume it holds for (n-2). Given (n) points, consider a line (ell) containing two points (A) and (B) with all other points on one side.      - Applying the induction hypothesis to the (n-2) remaining points, we require (leftlfloor frac{n-2}{2} rightrfloor) lines. Adding back (A) and (B), we solve:        - If (A) and (B) are the same color, separate with a line parallel to (ell).        - If (A) and (B) are different colors and already separated, the configuration holds.        - If (A) and (B) share a region, the region contains no other points of the same color hence separating with one additional line suffices.    - Therefore, (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor) lines suffice, concluding that (k = 2013) is exact for 4027 points.

The edge of the cap has degree markings from 0360^{circ}. How can we designate the vertices of a cube on the sphere using our tools?","output":"1. Consider a cube inscribed in a sphere, where the edges of the cube are aligned with three mutually perpendicular planes that are symmetrical about the center of the sphere. The intersection of these planes with the sphere forms great circles, dividing the sphere's surface into 8 congruent spherical triangles. 2. Observing these spherical triangles reveals that their sides are equal to one fourth of a great circle's circumference. Hence, every face of the cube corresponds to one of these spherical triangles. 3. The vertices of the cube are at the centers of these spherical triangles, which are identified as the intersection points of great circles running through the midpoints of the opposite sides of the spherical triangles.    Specifically, let's denote the planes by ( S_1 ), ( S_2 ), and ( S_3 ). Plane ( S_1 ) intersects plane ( S_2 ) and plane ( S_3 ) at right angles, and similar intersections occur between ( S_2 ) and ( S_3 ), and between ( S_3 ) and ( S_1 ). 4. Hence, to find a cube's vertices:    - Draw a great circle ( k_1 ) on the sphere. Mark points ( 0^circ, 90^circ, 180^circ ), and ( 270^circ ) on this circle. Label them as ( A, B, A^*, B^* ), respectively, where ( A^* ) and ( B^* ) are antipodal to ( A ) and ( B ).    - ( A ) and ( A^* ), and ( B ) and ( B^* ) are the endpoints of two diameters of the sphere ( AA^* ) and ( BB^* ) that are perpendicular to each other. 5. Next, draw another great circle ( k_2 ) through ( A, A^*, C, ) and ( C^* ) such that this circle is perpendicular to ( k_1 ). Through similar steps by marking ( 90^circ ) and ( 270^circ ) points, we can denote ( C ) and ( C^* ) on ( k_2 ). 6. Lastly, we introduce the third great circle ( k_3 ) going through ( DD^* ) on points ( 90^circ ) and ( 270^circ ) of ( A ) on ( k_2 ). This gives us points ( D ) and ( D^* ). Now, ( AA^* ) will be perpendicular to both ( BB^* ) and ( DD^* ). 7. The intersection points of these great circles provide the midpoints of the spherical triangles. By connecting these midpoints to the opposite vertices, we create a new set of great circles connecting these points. This process ensures that each edge of a spherical triangle is halved. 8. The intersection points obtained from steps 4 to 7 give the vertices of the cube, ensuring eight equal spherical triangles on the sphere. # Conclusion: By following the above construction steps, we determine the vertices of the cube inscribed in the sphere using the specified 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° points.

Let angle A = alpha, which leads to angle C = 120^circ + alpha. Let BD and BE be the altitude and angle bisector from vertex B respectively. 1. We start by expressing all angles in terms of alpha. Since the sum of the internal angles of the triangle is 180^circ, we have:    [    angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^circ    ]    Substituting angle A and angle C:    [    alpha + angle B + (120^circ + alpha) = 180^circ    ]    Simplifying the equation:    [    2alpha + angle B + 120^circ = 180^circ    ]    [    angle B = 60^circ - 2alpha    ] 2. Next, since BE is the angle bisector of angle B, the angle angle CBE at the base of the bisector is:    [    angle CBE = frac{1}{2}angle B = frac{1}{2}(60^circ - 2alpha) = 30^circ - alpha    ] 3. Considering triangle BEC, specifically looking at angle BEC and angle CBE, we can determine angle BEC using the property of angles in a triangle summing to 180^circ:    [    angle BEC = 180^circ - angle C - angle CBE    ]    Substituting the known values:    [    angle BEC = 180^circ - (120^circ + alpha) - (30^circ - alpha)    ]    Simplifying:    [    angle BEC = 180^circ - 120^circ - 30^circ = 30^circ    ] 4. Considering the right-angled triangle BDE:    - BD is the altitude from vertex B.    - angle BEC = 30^circ    - The altitude BD lies opposite to angle BED which is 30^circ.

Let us number the street lamps (or lanterns) along the length of the 1 km road with natural numbers in the order they are placed along the road.

If the segments illuminated by the n-th and the (n+2)-th lamps intersect (even in one point), it is clear that the (n+1)-th lamp can be turned off without affecting the completeness of the illumination. Additionally, if all odd-numbered segments are such that they do not intersect, then removing any even-numbered lamp would cause the non-complete illumination. 3. Consider a road segment of length 1000 meters. It is not possible to place more than 999 non-overlapping segments of length 1 meter each on this segment. If, hypothetically, we have 1999 lamps, then we would have at least 1000 lamps with odd numbers. 4. Hence, it follows that the maximum number of lamps without ensuring overlapping segments is 1998, because adding any more would create more than 1000 odd-numbered lamps whose segments would necessarily overlap. 5. Suppose we arrange 1998 lamps in such a manner that the centers of the illuminated segments form an arithmetic progression.

Observe that:  frac{C K}{P K} = frac{CP + PK}{PK} = 1 + frac{CP}{PK}  Using the properties of the mass center, we have:  frac{CP}{PK} = frac{alpha + beta}{gamma}  Therefore:  frac{BC}{PA_1} = 1 + frac{alpha + beta}{gamma} = frac{1}{gamma}  5.

If two people have a conversation, draw an edge between the corresponding vertices. Hence, we have a simple graph ( G ) with ( |V| = 21 ) and ( |E| = n ). 2. **Using Conditions**:    Given that every pair of people talks at most once, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of edges ( n ) such that if ( G ) has an odd cycle, it must contain a triangle (a cycle of length 3). 3. **Odd Cycle and Triangle**:    We need to show that if ( G ) has ( n geq 102 ) edges and contains an odd cycle, it will also contain a triangle. 4. **Case Analysis**:    Assume ( G ) has the smallest odd cycle ( C ) of length ( 2k + 1 ).    - If ( k = 1 ), then ( C ) is a triangle itself and our task is complete.    - If ( k geq 2 ), let ( C ) be the cycle ( v_1 v_2 ldots v_{2k+1} v_1 ). None of the non-adjacent vertices within ( C ) should have an edge, else a shorter odd cycle would exist, contradicting the minimality of ( C ). 5. **Excluding Non-Cycle Edges**:    Assume other  (21 - (2k+1) = 20 - 2k ) vertices do not form a triangle with vertices in ( C ). 6. **Turán's Theorem Application**:    According to Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on ( n ) vertices is at most ( leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor ). For ( 20 - 2k ) vertices, this is ((10-k)^2). 7. **Combining Edges and Vertices**:    The total number of edges in ( G ) should be,    [    (2k+1) + (10-k)^2 + (20-2k)k = 102 - (k-1)^2 < 102    ]    This inequality contradicts the possibility of having no triangles when ( G ) has 102 edges since it should hold for every configuration. 8. **Constructing a Graph with 101 Edges**:    Construct a counterexample with 101 edges. Divide the vertices into subsets (P, Q), and (R):    - (P = {A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5})    - (Q = {A_6, A_8, A_{10}, ldots, A_{20}})    - (R = {A_7, A_9, A_{11}, ldots, A_{21}}). 9. **Edge Configuration**:    - Connect (A_i, A_{i+1}) within (P) cyclically.    - Each vertex in (Q) connects with each vertex in (R). Vertices in (Q) connect with (A_1, A_3), and vertices in (R) with (A_2, A_4). 10. **Edge Count**:    - Edges within (P): 5 edges.    - Edges across (Q) and (R): (8 times 8 = 64) edges.    - Edges from (Q) to (A_1, A_3): (2 times 8 = 16) edges.    - Edges from (R) to (A_2, A_4): (2 times 8 = 16) edges.

Find the expected number of matches in the other box.","output":"1. Let's assume Banach takes matches from two boxes, each containing n = 60 matches initially. He randomnly selects a box and takes one match from it until he finds one box empty. We need to calculate the expected number of matches remaining in the other box when he finds the first one to be empty. 2. Let’s label the two boxes as the **red box** and the **blue box** for clarity. 3. When Banach finds the red box empty, it means he has taken n matches from it. During this time, let us denote the number of matches he took from the blue box by k. 4. Thus, the number of matches left in the blue box is n-k. 5. Each time Banach randomly selects a box, the probability of choosing a particular box is frac{1}{2}. 6. The total number of trials where he takes matches is n + k and each trial has equal probability for either box. 7. The probability that he took k matches from the blue box in n + k total draws follows a binomial distribution with parameters n+k and frac{1}{2}:        P(text{taking k matches from } n+k) = binom{n+k}{k} cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n+k}     8. To find the expected number of matches left in the blue box, we should take the expectation over all possible values of k:        mu = sum_{k=0}^{n} (n - k) binom{n+k}{k} cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n+k}     9. This expression can be decomposed:        mu = n sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n+k}{k} cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n+k} - sum_{k=0}^{n} k binom{n+k}{k} cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n+k}     10. We know from binomial distribution properties the sum of weighted probabilities should be one:        sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n+k}{k} cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n+k} = 1     11. The remaining term:          sum_{k=0}^{n} k binom{n+k}{k} cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n+k}          needs to be addressed separately. Use combination properties to solve for this sum.     Let's approximate this expression by considering the Stirling approximation for factorial for large n:          k! approx sqrt{2 pi k} left(frac{k^k}{e^k}right)          such that,          binom{2n+1}{n+1} approx frac{2^{2n+1}}{sqrt{pi (n+1)}}      12.

Particularly, if we choose f(0) > 0, then for some sufficiently large positive number b and sufficiently small negative number a, for all x leq a and x geq b, we have f(x) < f(0).     1.2 Since f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a, b], by the Extreme Value Theorem, there exists a point c in [a, b] such that f(x) attains its maximum value M at c. Hence, M = f(c) geq f(0).     1.3 For all x in (-infty, a) cup (b, +infty),     [     f(x) < f(0) leq M.     ]     1.4 Thus, f(x) leq M for all x in mathbb{R}. Therefore, f(x) attains its maximum value M on mathbb{R}.     [     boxed{M}     ] 2. To prove the existence of two sequences {x_n} and {y_n} satisfying the given conditions:    2.1 By the Intermediate Value Theorem, if f(x) takes two values A and B with A < B, then f(x) can take all values in the interval (A, B).    2.2 Consider two cases:        2.2.1 Assume there exists an interval (a, b) such that for some c in (a, b), we have f(c) = M and for all x in (a, b) setminus {c}, we have f(x) < M. Let A, B in (a, b) with A neq c and B neq c so that c in [A, B].           - Because f(x) is continuous on [A, c] and [c, B], it attains minimum values on these intervals, denoted by m_1 and m_2, respectively. Let m = max{m_1, m_2}.           - By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exist x_1 in [A, c] and y_1 in [c, B] such that f(x_1) = f(y_1) = m and x_1 < c < y_1.           - Similarly, on [x_1, c] and [c, y_1], by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exist x_2 in [x_1, c] and y_2 in [c, y_1] such that f(x_2) = f(y_2) = frac{m + M}{2} and x_2 < c < y_2.           - Define sequences {u_n} given by u_1 = m and u_{n+1} = frac{u_n + M}{2} for n in mathbb{Z}_+.           - Hence, {u_n} converges to M, and for each positive integer n geq 2, there exist x_n in [x_{n-1}, c] and y_n in [c, y_{n-1}] such that f(x_n) = f(y_n) = u_n and x_n < c < y_n.           - Since {x_n} is monotonically increasing and bounded above by c, {x_n} converges. Let lim_{n to +infty} x_n = l. Then l leq c. If l < c, the continuity of f(x) implies:             [             M = lim_{n to +infty} u_n = lim_{n to +infty} f(x_n) = f(l) < M,             ]             which is a contradiction. Therefore, lim_{n to +infty} x_n = c. Similarly, lim_{n to +infty} y_n = c.        2.2.2 If the interval (a, b) does not exist, there exists an interval [a, b] such that for all x in [a, b], f(x) = M.           - Consider the sequences defined by             [             x_n = frac{a+b}{2} + frac{a-b}{2^n}, quad y_n = frac{a+b}{2} + frac{b-a}{2^n},             ]             for n = 1, 2, ldots.           - For all positive integers n, x_n, y_n in [a, b] and thus f(x_n) = f(y_n) = M. Also, x_n < frac{a+b}{2} < y_n and lim_{n to +infty} x_n = lim_{n to +infty} y_n = frac{a+b}{2}.    Conclusion: The sequences left{x_{n}right} and left{y_{n}right} satisfying the conditions exist.

To solve this, we start by analyzing the given trigonometric equation. 1. **Step 1: Analyze the trigonometric identity and possible solutions**    The equation provided is:    [    sin(3x + 4y) = sin 3x + sin 4y    ]    We know that the sine addition formula states:    [    sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B    ]    For this equation to hold, (sin(3x + 4y)) must equal the sum of (sin 3x) and (sin 4y). Another useful trigonometric identity is:    [    sin A + sin B = 2 sinleft(frac{A + B}{2}right) cosleft(frac{A - B}{2}right)    ] 2. **Step 2: Check when the equation holds true**    We need to find specific conditions under which:    [    sin(3x + 4y) = sin 3x + sin 4y    ]    One approach is to recognize that trigonometric functions repeat periodically. Therefore, solutions are found where the expressions on both sides of the equation exactly match for inputs fitting this periodicity. 3. **Step 3: Consider critical points and periodicity**    The equation can be simplified under certain conditions such as when both sides are zero:    [    sin(3x + 4y) = 0    ]    Given that (sin(3x)) and (sin(4y)) are independent, we can consider specific values such as ( 3x = kpi ) and ( 4y = mpi ) where ( k ) and ( m ) are integers. 4. **Step 4: Denote periodicity and minimal intersections**    The smallest non-zero values for ( x ) and ( y ) such that the equation still holds may indicate lines or curves in the (xy)-plane that satisfy:    [    3x + 4y = npi quad text{for some integer } n    ]    Creating non-intersecting sets with circles of radius ( R ), requires ( R ) to be smaller than the smallest distance between points of intersection derived from these trigonometric solutions. 5. **Step 5: Define the bounding region for ( R )**    For a circle of radius ( R ) not to intersect with the given set ( M ), ( R ) must be smaller than the minimum distance among repetitive trigonometric intervals. This can be deduced from the fundamental properties of the sine function which has a period of ( 2pi ) and intersects securely within a range of ( pi ). 6. **Conclusion: Find the allowable range for ( R )**    Through this rigorous breakdown, it becomes clear that the largest possible radius ( R ) that does not intersect with any points in ( M ) must be strictly less than half the fundamental interval associated with the trigonometric sine functions. Thus, ( R ) can take any value within: [ R in left(0, frac{pi}{6}right) ] When boxed, the final answer is: [ boxed{R in left(0, frac{pi}{6}right)} ]"},{"instruction":"The solution set of the inequality (sqrt{log_{2} x  1} + frac{1}{2} log_{frac{1}{2}} x^{3} + 2 > 0) is ( ).

Recall that: [ log_a(b) = frac{log_c(b)}{log_c(a)}. ] For ( log_{frac{1}{2}} (x^{3}) ), since the base is ( frac{1}{2} ), we know that: [ log_{frac{1}{2}} (y) = frac{log_{2} (y)}{log_{2} (frac{1}{2})}. ] Given ( log_2 (frac{1}{2}) = -1 ), it follows that: [ log_{frac{1}{2}} (x^{3}) = frac{log_{2} (x^{3})}{-1} = -log_{2}(x^{3}) = -3 log_{2} (x). ] Thus: [ frac{1}{2} log_{frac{1}{2}}(x^{3}) = frac{1}{2} (-3 log_{2}(x)) = -frac{3}{2} log_{2}(x). ]  Step 2: Substitute and rewrite the inequality Substitute back into the original inequality: [ sqrt{log_{2} x - 1} - frac{3}{2} log_{2} x + 2 > 0. ]  Step 3: Set substitution Let: [ t = sqrt{log_{2} x - 1}. ] Then ( t geqslant 0 ) and: [ log_{2} x - 1 = t^{2} implies log_{2} x = t^{2} + 1. ]  Step 4: Rewrite the inequality in terms of ( t ): Substitute ( t = sqrt{log_{2} x - 1} ) into the inequality: [ t - frac{3}{2} (t^{2} + 1) + 2 > 0. ]  Step 5: Simplify the inequality: [ t - frac{3}{2} t^{2} - frac{3}{2} + 2 > 0. ] [ t - frac{3}{2} t^{2} + frac{1}{2} > 0. ] Multiply every term by 2 to clear the fraction: [ 2t - 3t^{2} + 1 > 0. ]  Step 6: Solve the quadratic inequality: Solve for ( t ): [ -3t^{2} + 2t + 1 > 0. ] Solving the quadratic equation ( -3t^{2} + 2t + 1 = 0 ): Using the quadratic formula ( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) where ( a = -3 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = 1 ): [ t = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 12}}{-6} = frac{-2 pm 4}{-6}. ] So, we get two roots: [ t = frac{-2 + 4}{-6} = -frac{1}{3}, quad t = frac{-2 - 4}{-6} = 1. ] Since ( t geq 0 ), the relevant root is ( t = 1 ). The quadratic ( -3t^{2} + 2t + 1 ) is a downward opening parabola. The inequality ( 2t - 3t^{2} + 1 > 0 ) holds when ( 0 leq t < 1 ).  Step 7: Solve for ( x ): Recall ( t = sqrt{log_{2} x - 1} ), hence ( 0 leq t < 1 ): [ 0 leq sqrt{log_{2} x - 1} < 1 implies 0 leq log_{2} x - 1 < 1. ] Thus: [ 1 leq log_{2} x < 2. ] [ 2 leq x < 2^{2}. ] [ 2 leq x < 4. ] # Conclusion: The solution set for ( x ) is: [ boxed{[2,4)} ]"},{"instruction":"Jill and her brother Jack are going apple picking.

This question primarily examines the properties of a tangent line to a circle and the application of the distance formula from a point to a line. It's a moderately difficult question. The solution is as follows: 1. Given that the line and the circle are tangent, we know that the distance from the center of the circle to the line is equal to the radius of the circle. 2. The distance d from the center of the circle (0, 0) to the line x + y = 2 can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}, where (x_0, y_0) is the point and Ax + By + C = 0 is the line. In our case, A = 1, B = 1, C = -2, x_0 = 0, and y_0 = 0. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: d = frac{|0 + 0 - 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. 3.

According to the information given, 30% of the incandescent bulbs are switched on, so the number of incandescent bulbs that are on is 0.3I. We don't know the percentage of fluorescent bulbs that are on, so let's call that percentage x. Therefore, the number of fluorescent bulbs that are on is xF. The total number of bulbs that are on is the sum of the incandescent bulbs that are on and the fluorescent bulbs that are on, which is 0.3I + xF. We are also told that 70% of all the bulbs are switched on. The total number of bulbs is I + F, so 70% of all bulbs being on means that 0.7(I + F) bulbs are on. Therefore, we have the equation: 0.3I + xF = 0.7(I + F) We are also told that 8.571428571428571% (which is 1/7 when converted to a fraction) of the bulbs that are on are incandescent. This means that the number of incandescent bulbs that are on is 1/7 of the total number of bulbs that are on.

Now, we need to compute ( g'(x) ):     [     g'(x) = 10x^4 - 8x^3 + 54x^2 + 42x + 9 > 0     ]     This indicates that ( g(x) ) is strictly increasing on ( (0, +infty) ). 5. **Finding the Zero Points of ( g(x) )**:     Since ( g(x) ) is increasing, with ( g(0.5) < 0 ) and ( g(1) > 0 ),     there exists a unique zero ( x_0 ) in ( (0.5, 1) ). Therefore, ( f(x) ) has two zero points, specifically ( x_0 ) and 1, and ( f(x) ) is:     - Increasing on ( (0, x_0) ),     - Decreasing on ( (x_0, 1) ),     - Increasing on ( (1,+infty) ). 6. **Local Inequality Establishment**:     Given ( f(0.5) > 0 Longleftrightarrow frac{33}{46} > ln 2 ) and since ( frac{33}{46} > 0.7 > ln 2 ), and ( f(1) = 0 ), our local inequality holds. 7. **Applying the Local Inequality**:     If ( a, b, c geq 0.5 ), using the local inequality:     [     frac{a}{a^3 - a^2 + 3} + frac{b}{b^3 - b^2 + 3} + frac{c}{c^3 - c^2 + 3} leq sum left( frac{2}{9} ln x + frac{1}{3} right) = frac{2}{9} ln left( abc right) + 1 = 1     ] 8. **Handling (a, b, c < 0.5)**:     If one variable ( a ) is less than 0.5, let us define ( h(x) = frac{x}{x^3 - x^2 + 3} ). We derive:     [     h'(x) = frac{3 + x^2 - 2 x^3}{left( x^3 - x^2 + 3 right)^2}     ]     Let ( u(x) = 3 + x^2 - 2 x^3 ). Then:     [     u'(x) = 2x - 6x^2 leq 0, quad x in (0, 3]     ]     Thus, ( h'(x) ) has a zero point ( x_1 in left( frac{1}{2}, frac{3}{2} right) ). Hence, ( h(x) ) is increasing in ( left(0, 0.5right] ) and therefore:     [     h(a) < hleft( frac{1}{2} right) = frac{4}{23}     ] 9. **Final Aggregation**:     Noticing the inequality ( frac{x}{x^3 - x^2 + 3} leq frac{3x}{x^3 + 8} < frac{1}{2 sqrt[3]{2}} ), we get:     [     h(a) + h(b) + h(c) < frac{4}{23} + frac{2}{5} + frac{2}{5} < 1     ] # Conclusion: Hence, [ frac{a}{a^{3}-a^{2}+3}+frac{b}{b^{3}-b^{2}+3}+frac{c}{c^{3}-c^{2}+3} leq 1 ] This completes the proof.

Therefore, this statement, as intended, is correct. **Statement ③:** The reciprocal of a number less than -1 is greater than the number itself. - Let's consider a number x such that x < -1.

Among them, for certain ( a ) and ( b ), you can find squares of integers. For which ( a ) and ( b ) will the number of squares be maximized?","output":"To determine the values of ( a ) and ( b ) so that the number of perfect squares among the given six expressions is maximized, let's consider the given expressions: 1. ( ab ) 2. ( a(a+10) ) 3. ( a(b+10) ) 4. ( b(a+10) ) 5. ( b(b+10) ) 6. ( (a+10)(b+10) ) We aim to maximize the number of perfect squares among these six expressions.  1. **Step 1: Examine ( ab )**:    - For ( ab ) to be a perfect square, both ( a ) and ( b ) should be such that their product forms a perfect square. If ( a = 1 ) and ( b ) is a perfect square, say ( b = k^2 ) where ( k neq 1 ), then ( ab = 1 cdot k^2 = k^2 ), which is a perfect square. 2. **Step 2: Examine ( a(a+10) )**:    - With ( a = 1 ), ( a(a+10) = 1(1+10) = 11 ), which is not a perfect square. Thus, we need to find another ( a ) such that ( a(a+10) ) is also a perfect square. 3. **Step 3: Examine ( a(b+10) )**:    - With ( a = 1 ) and ( b = k^2 ), ( a(b+10) = 1(k^2+10) = k^2 + 10 ), which is not necessarily a perfect square for all ( k ). 4. **Step 4: Examine ( b(a+10) )**:    - With ( a = 1 ) and ( b = k^2 ), ( b(a+10) = k^2(1+10) = 11k^2 ), which is not a perfect square if ( k neq sqrt{11} ). Instead, let's proceed without any constraints on ( k ). 5. **Step 5: Examine ( b(b+10) )**:    - With ( b = k^2 ), ( b(b+10) = k^2(k^2+10) = k^4 + 10k^2 ), which is not necessarily a perfect square. 6. **Step 6: Examine ( (a+10)(b+10) )**:    - With ( a = 1 ) and ( b = k^2 ), ( (a+10)(b+10) = (1+10)(k^2+10) = 11(k^2+10) ), which is not necessarily a perfect square. After examining these cases, the only clear solution that maximizes the number of perfect squares occurs for ( a = 1 ) and ( b = k^2 ), where ( k neq 1 ). This configuration yields the following: 1. ( ab = k^2 ) 2. No other combinations consistently produce perfect squares based on the initial analysis. Thus, the maximum number of perfect squares, which is exactly 3, occurs at ( a = 1 ) and ( b = k^2 ), where ( k neq 1 ) and ( k in mathbb{Z} ).

Thus, ( c mid 3 ).    - The possible values for ( c ) are ( pm 1, pm 3 ).    - However, for ( p = 5 ), we have ( (5-3)! + frac{5+1}{2} = 2! + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 ). Thus, ( c mid 5 ).    - The only common divisor of 3 and 5 is 1. Therefore, ( c = pm 1 ). 2. **Consider the case when ( P(x) ) is not a constant polynomial:**    - Assume ( P(0) neq 0 ).    - Let ( p ) be a prime that does not divide ( P(0) ) and ( p nmid P(n) ) for some integer ( n ). Such a prime exists by Schur's theorem.    - By Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many primes of the form ( q = kp + n ).    - For a sufficiently large prime ( q ), we have ( P(q) mid (q-3)! + frac{q+1}{2} ).    - This implies ( p mid q + 1 ), hence ( p mid n + 1 ).    - Therefore, ( p mid P(-1) ) for infinitely many primes ( p ), which implies ( P(-1) = 0 ). 3. **Rewriting ( P(x) ) as ( P(x) = xQ(x) ):**    - Since ( P(-1) = 0 ), we can write ( P(x) = xQ(x) ) where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial.    - Applying the same argument to ( Q(x) ), we get ( Q(0) = 0 ).    - Repeating this process, we find that ( P(x) = cx^n ) for some integer ( c ) and ( n ). 4. **Determining the values of ( c ) and ( n ):**    - Plugging ( p = 3 ) into the condition, we get ( c cdot 3^n mid (3-3)! + frac{3+1}{2} = 3 ).    - This implies ( c cdot 3^n mid 3 ), so ( c = pm 1 ) and ( n = 1 ). 5. **Verification:**    - For ( P(x) = pm x ), we need to check if ( pm p mid (p-3)! + frac{p+1}{2} ) for all odd primes ( p ).    - Using Wilson's theorem, ((p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}), we get ((p-3)! equiv frac{-1}{2} pmod{p}).    - Thus, ((p-3)! + frac{p+1}{2} equiv frac{-1}{2} + frac{p+1}{2} = frac{p}{2} pmod{p}).    - Since ( p ) is odd, (frac{p}{2}) is an integer, and (pm p mid p) holds true.

The area of the rectangular floor can be calculated by multiplying the length by the breadth. Let's denote the breadth as B meters.

Now, we look at the distance d from the center of the circle to the line, which should be equal to the radius of the circle since the line is tangent.

The speed of the jogger is 9 km/hr, and the speed of the train is 45 km/hr. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the jogger's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed: Relative speed of the train with respect to the jogger = Speed of train - Speed of jogger Relative speed = 45 km/hr - 9 km/hr Relative speed = 36 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s: Relative speed in m/s = 36 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed in m/s = 10 m/s The train takes 37 seconds to pass the jogger. During this time, the train covers the length of itself plus the distance the jogger is ahead. We can express this as: Distance covered by the train while passing the jogger = Length of the train + Distance jogger is ahead We know the length of the train is 120 m, and we can calculate the distance covered by the train while passing the jogger using the relative speed and the time taken: Distance covered by the train = Relative speed * Time taken Distance covered by the train = 10 m/s * 37 s Distance covered by the train = 370 m Now we can solve for the distance the jogger is ahead: 370 m = 120 m + Distance jogger is ahead Distance jogger is ahead = 370 m - 120 m Distance jogger is ahead = 250 m Therefore, the jogger is boxed{250}  meters ahead of the engine of the train."},{"instruction":"A student chose a number, multiplied it by 2, then subtracted 138 from the result and got 104.

The given equality is: [ overline{ab} cdot overline{cd} = overline{effe} ] 2. To check if Kolya made a mistake, we apply the divisibility rule for 11. Recall that a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. For example, for a number ( overline{d_1 d_2 ldots d_n} ), the alternating sum is: [ d_1 - d_2 + d_3 - d_4 + cdots pm d_n ] 3. Let's break down the multiplication product ( overline{effe} ).

Under such circumstances, their responses could be entirely truthful, entirely false, or mixed. 4. **Guaranteeing a majority of knights**:    - To ensure the majority, the professor needs to ask enough residents so that even if all commoners (15) were included, the remaining respondents would be knights. 5. **Calculation**:    - If the professor asks ( 31 ) residents in total:      [      31 = 15 (text{all possible commoners}) + x (text{knights})      ]      Where ( x ) is the number of knights among the 31 asked residents:      [      x = 31 - 15 = 16      ]    - Here, ( x ) is 16, which signifies we have more knights (right answers) than the number of commoners, hence guaranteeing the truth prevails as (16 > 15). 6. **Conclusion**:    - Thus, the minimal number of residents required to be questioned to be certain about the color of the hat is: [ boxed{31} ]"},{"instruction":"an elementary school , 60 % of the faculty members are women and 60 % of the faculty members are married . if 3 / 4 of the men are single , what fraction of the men are married ?","output":"Let's assume there are 100 faculty members for simplicity.

Now, we know that 60% of the faculty members are married. This means that 60 faculty members are married. Since 3/4 of the men are single, this means that 1/4 of the men are married. To find out how many men are married, we take 1/4 of the total number of men: 1/4 * 40 men = 10 men So, 10 men are married.

He weighs 80 kg. So, daily protein intake = 2 grams/kg * 80 kg = 160 grams of protein per day. Now, since Matt's protein powder is 80% protein, we need to figure out how much of the powder will give him 160 grams of protein.

The derivative is calculated as follows: f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}left(frac{x+a}{a{e}^{x}}right)=frac{1-x-a}{a{e}^{x}} quad (aneq 0) To find the critical points, we set f'(x)=0: frac{1-x-a}{a{e}^{x}}=0 Rightarrow x=1-a - **When a > 0:**     - For xin (1-a,+infty), we have f'(x) < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing.     - For xin (-infty ,1-a), we have f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing.   - **When a < 0:**     - For xin (-infty ,1-a), we have f'(x) < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing.     - For xin (1-a,+infty), we have f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing.   Therefore, summarizing the monotonic intervals: - **For a > 0:** The function is increasing on (-infty ,1-a) and decreasing on (1-a,+infty). - **For a < 0:** The function is decreasing on (-infty ,1-a) and increasing on (1-a,+infty).

By evaluating t at specific points: - For x=frac{1}{e}, we get t=frac{1-e}{e}<0. - For x=1, we get t=1>0. Hence, there exists a unique x_{0}in(frac{1}{e},1) such that t=x_{0}+ln x_{0}=0. Define a new function g(t)=e^{t}-t-1 with its derivative g'(t)=e^{t}-1. Analyzing g(t): - When t < 0, g'(t) < 0, making g(t) monotonically decreasing. - When t > 0, g'(t) > 0, making g(t) monotonically increasing. Thus, g(t)geq g(0)=0, implying e^{t}geq t+1. Therefore, e^{x+ln x}geq x+ln x+1, leading to: frac{2[(x+ln x)-{e}^{x+ln x}]+2-2x}{x}leqfrac{2×(-1)+2-2x}{x}=-2 The equality holds if and only if x+ln x=0, i.e., x=x_{0}.

With the 10% discount, the number of items sold increases by 15%. So instead of selling 100 items, they now sell 115 items (100 items + 15% of 100 items). The new gross income from sales with the discount and increased sales volume would be 103.50 (115 items * 0.90). To find the percentage increase in their gross income, we use the formula: Percentage Increase = [(New Income - Original Income) / Original Income] * 100 Plugging in the numbers: Percentage Increase = [(103.50 - 100) / 100] * 100 Percentage Increase = (3.50 / 100) * 100 Percentage Increase = 0.035 * 100 Percentage Increase = 3.5% So, their gross income from sales for one month increases by boxed{3.5%} ."},{"instruction":"Compute the triple integral: a) (iiint_{Omega}(2 x + 3 y + z) , dx , dy , dz), where (Omega = {(x, y, z) : x geq 0, y geq 0, 0 leq z leq 3, x + y leq 3}) b) (iiint_{Omega}(1  x)^3 sqrt{1  y^2} , dx , dy , dz), where (Omega = {(x, y, z) : | x | leq 1, | y | leq 1, | z | leq 3}) c) (iiint_{Omega} frac{x y}{sqrt{z}} , dx , dy , dz), where (Omega = left{(x, y, z) : z^2 leq x^2 + y^2, x geq 0, y geq 0, 0 leq z leq 1right})","output":"# Problem: 1.23.

Let's assume the opposite: the train did not travel through the marked segment. 1. **Removing the Segment**: If we exclude the marked segment and its neighboring stations from the metro map, the remaining routes should still allow the train to travel from station ( A ) to station ( B ) in 2016 minutes.  2. **Bipartite Graph Coloring**: Consider the metro map without the marked segment and those adjacent stations. Since each train changes lines at every junction and each segment is traversed in one minute, we can color the remaining map with two colors in such a way that no two stations connected by a segment have the same color.  3. **Switching Colors**: Starting from station ( A ), we can denote its color as color 1. Every minute, the train moves to a station of the opposite color. Thus, if the train starts at station of color 1, after one minute it will be on a station of color 2, after two minutes on a station of color 1, and so on alternately. 4. **Even Minute Observation**: After an even number of minutes, the train will be on a station of the same color it started from. Since 2016 is an even number, after 2016 minutes the train should end up on a station of color 1, which is the same color as station ( A ). 5. **But Stations ( A ) and ( B ) Have Different Colors**: However, stations ( A ) and ( B ) are not the same color (they are on different lines). This creates a contradiction, because if the train ends its journey at ( B ) after an even number of minutes, it implies that ( B ) should be the same color as ( A ). **Conclusion**: The contradiction arises because we assumed the train did not travel through the marked segment. Therefore, our assumption must be false. Hence, the train must have traveled through the marked segment at least once during its journey.

Thus, each day of the week will occur exactly 4 times in the first 28 days. The distribution of the additional 2 days depends on which day of the week the month starts. 2. **Modulo Calculation:**    Since 30 equiv 2 pmod{7}, the day of the week on which the month starts will determine the weekdays of these additional 2 days. 3. **Analyzing Each Starting Day:**    - If the month starts on **Sunday**, the extra days are Sunday and Monday. Thus, there are 4 Tuesdays and 4 Fridays.    - If the month starts on **Monday**, the extra days are Monday and Tuesday. Thus, there are 5 Tuesdays and 4 Fridays.    - If the month starts on **Tuesday**, the extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. Thus, there are 5 Tuesdays and 4 Fridays.    - If the month starts on **Wednesday**, the extra days are Wednesday and Thursday. Thus, there are 4 Tuesdays and 4 Fridays.    - If the month starts on **Thursday**, the extra days are Thursday and Friday. Thus, there are 4 Tuesdays and 5 Fridays.    - If the month starts on **Friday**, the extra days are Friday and Saturday. Thus, there are 4 Tuesdays and 5 Fridays.    - If the month starts on **Saturday**, the extra days are Saturday and Sunday. Thus, there are 4 Tuesdays and 4 Fridays. 4. **Identifying Equal Tuesdays and Fridays:**    From the analysis above, the number of Tuesdays and Fridays are equal when the month starts on:    - **Sunday** (4 Tuesdays and 4 Fridays)    - **Wednesday** (4 Tuesdays and 4 Fridays)    - **Saturday** (4 Tuesdays and 4 Fridays) 5. **Conclusion:**    There are three days of the week (Sunday, Wednesday, and Saturday) when the month can start such that the number of Tuesdays and Fridays are equal.

The cost price for product A is 20 per kg, so the total cost price for 9.5 kg is 9.5 kg x 20/kg = 190. For product B: The shopkeeper gives 900 gm for a kg, so for 10 kg, he gives 900 gm x 10 = 9000 gm or 9 kg.

The gain for product B is 250 (selling price) - 225 (actual cost price) = 25. For product C, the shopkeeper sells 10 kg at the cost price of 18/kg, so he receives 10 kg x 18/kg = 180. The gain for product C is 180 (selling price) - 165.6 (actual cost price) = 14.4. The total gain from all products is 10 (A) + 25 (B) + 14.4 (C) = 49.4. The total actual cost price for all products is 190 (A) + 225 (B) + 165.6 (C) = 580.6.

To prove |f(x)f(a)| < 2(|a| + 1), we consider the absolute value and the properties of the function f(x). Since f(x) is always positive, |f(x)f(a)| = f(x)f(a).  Now, let's estimate f(x)f(a) under the condition |x - a| < 1.

However, without a specific method to directly calculate or compare f(x)f(a) with 2(|a| + 1) under the given condition, we recognize that the problem statement as provided does not lead to a straightforward proof or disproof of the inequality |f(x)f(a)| < 2(|a| + 1).  Therefore, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the original problem statement or its conditions, as the provided information does not suffice to conclusively prove the given inequality under the standard mathematical methods and knowledge. In conclusion, under the given conditions and standard mathematical knowledge, the proof of the inequality |f(x)f(a)| < 2(|a| + 1) cannot be directly established based on the information provided.

Calculate its angles. What can be said about ( H ) in relation to this triangle?","output":":  1. **Identify the orthic triangle:**    The orthic triangle DEF is formed by the feet of the altitudes from each vertex of the main triangle (let's denote it as triangle ABC) to the opposite sides. Specifically:    - D is the foot of the altitude from vertex A to side BC,    - E is the foot of the altitude from vertex B to side AC, and    - F is the foot of the altitude from vertex C to side AB. 2. **Recognize the cyclic quadrilaterals:**    By definition, the feet of the altitudes all lie on the sides of the orthic triangle, and they form cyclic quadrilaterals with the vertices of the main triangle triangle ABC:    - A, F, D, E are concyclic,    - B, D, E, F are concyclic,    - C, E, F, D are concyclic. 3. **Apply angle properties in cyclic quadrilaterals:**    Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we can determine the angles in the orthic triangle DEF as follows:    - In cyclic quadrilateral A, F, D, E, we know opposite angles sum up to 180^circ. Thus:      [      angle AFE + angle ADE = 180^circ      ]      Since angle ADE = 90^circ (as D is the foot of the altitude), it follows that:      [      angle AFE = 180^circ - 90^circ = 90^circ - angle C      ] 4. **Repeating angle derivation for other vertices:**    Similarly, examining the other cyclic quadrilaterals:    - From B, D, E, F:      [      angle BDF + angle BEF = 180^circ      ]      And angle BDF = 90^circ, therefore:      [      angle BEF = 180^circ - 90^circ = 90^circ - angle A      ]    - From C, E, F, D:      [      angle CEF + angle CDF = 180^circ      ]      And angle CDF = 90^circ, therefore:      [      angle CEF = 180^circ - 90^circ = 90^circ - angle B      ] 5. **Summarize with identified angles:**    The angles of the orthic triangle DEF are thus:    [    angle DFE = 90^circ - angle C, quad angle DEF = 90^circ - angle A, quad angle EFD = 90^circ - angle B    ] 6. **Position of the orthocenter H:**    - The orthocenter H of the main triangle triangle ABC lies at the common intersection point of the altitudes. Since H is already defined relative to the line segments intersecting at the feet of the perpendiculars (forming D, E, F), it is clear H is also the orthocenter of the orthic triangle DEF.     # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The angles of the orthic triangle } DEF text{ are } angle DFE = 90^circ - angle C, angle DEF = 90^circ - angle A, text{ and } angle EFD = 90^circ - angle B. text{ The point } H text{ is the orthocenter of both } triangle ABC text{ and the orthic triangle } DEF.} ]"},{"instruction":"Two pipes p and q can fill a cistern in 10 and 15 minutes respectively.

Pipe p can fill the cistern in 10 minutes, so in one minute it fills ( frac{1}{10} ) of the cistern.

When both pipes are open together, they fill ( frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{15} ) of the cistern per minute. To find a common denominator, we can use 30 (since 30 is a multiple of both 10 and 15): ( frac{1}{10} = frac{3}{30} ) ( frac{1}{15} = frac{2}{30} ) So together, they fill ( frac{3}{30} + frac{2}{30} = frac{5}{30} ) of the cistern per minute, which simplifies to ( frac{1}{6} ). In ( t ) minutes, they would fill ( frac{t}{6} ) of the cistern. After pipe p is turned off, pipe q continues to fill the cistern alone for 10 more minutes. In 10 minutes, pipe q fills ( 10 times frac{1}{15} = frac{10}{15} ) of the cistern, which simplifies to ( frac{2}{3} ). The total amount of the cistern filled by both pipes when they are open together and by pipe q alone after pipe p is turned off must equal 1 (the whole cistern). So we have: ( frac{t}{6} + frac{2}{3} = 1 ) To solve for ( t ), we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6: ( frac{t}{6} + frac{4}{6} = 1 ) Combine the fractions: ( frac{t + 4}{6} = 1 ) Multiply both sides by 6 to solve for ( t ): ( t + 4 = 6 ) Subtract 4 from both sides: ( t = 6 - 4 ) ( t = 2 ) So both pipes were opened together for boxed{2}  minutes before the first pipe was turned off."},{"instruction":"Adam has 13 blocks.

This involves verifying the base case of the inequality. **Step 1: Base Case** We need to find the smallest value of n for which the inequality should be checked. Since n > 1, the first non-trivial case to check is when n=2. However, the problem statement suggests we are summing fractions starting from 1 up to frac{1}{2^{n}-1}, which means we need to verify the case where these fractions make their first appearance. For n=2, we have 1+frac{1}{2}, but to fully embrace the pattern and the condition n > 1, we look at n=3 which introduces the term frac{1}{3}, making the sum 1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}.  We verify if this sum is less than n for n=3: [1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3} < 3] However, the inequality to be verified as per the problem's requirement is not about comparing it directly to 3, but rather checking the initial condition that sets the stage for induction. Thus, we are actually looking to verify the inequality for the smallest non-trivial case that fits the pattern, which is indeed when n=2, leading to the sum 1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}. The correct verification step is to see if this sum is less than the next integer value, which is 2 in this context.

Here's the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Understand the Wear Rates:**    - The front tires wear out after 25,000 kilometers.    - The rear tires wear out after 15,000 kilometers.    - We need to find the proportional wear per kilometer for each tire:      [      text{Front tire wear rate} = frac{1}{25000} text{ per kilometer}      ]      [      text{Rear tire wear rate} = frac{1}{15000} text{ per kilometer}      ] 2. **Total Wear for Both Tires:**    When the tires are swapped, each tire spends some part of its life in the front and some in the rear.

Given a triangle and a set of parallel lines through the Lemoine point, we use the fact that these lines are corresponding lines in the similar triangles formed by the sides of the original triangle ( ABC ). 4. **Intersection and Brocard Triangle:**    The points of intersection of these lines with the Brocard circle are the points of the Brocard triangle (A_1 B_1 C_1).

The earnings from spinach would be: 4 per pound * S pounds = 4S The earnings from carrot sales would be: 2 per pound * 2S pounds = 4S According to the information given, the earnings from spinach were 16 more than half of the earnings from carrot sales: 4S (spinach earnings) = 0.5 * 4S (half of carrot earnings) + 16 4S = 2S + 16 4S - 2S = 16 2S = 16 S = 16 / 2 S = 8 So, the weight of spinach sold was 8 pounds, and the earnings from spinach sales were: 4 per pound * 8 pounds = 32 The weight of carrots sold was twice that, so 16 pounds, and the earnings from carrot sales were: 2 per pound * 16 pounds = 32 Now, let's calculate the earnings from tomato sales, which were equal to the combined earnings from broccoli and spinach sales: Tomato sales = Broccoli sales + Spinach sales Tomato sales = 57 (broccoli) + 32 (spinach) Tomato sales = 89 Finally, we can calculate the earnings from cauliflower sales by subtracting the earnings from all other items from the total earnings: Cauliflower sales = Total earnings - (Broccoli sales + Carrot sales + Spinach sales + Tomato sales) Cauliflower sales = 520 - (57 + 32 + 32 + 89) Cauliflower sales = 520 - 210 Cauliflower sales = 310 Therefore, they made boxed{310}  from cauliflower sales."},{"instruction":"The slope angle of the line x sqrt {3}y=3 is (　　) A: 30° B: 60° C: 120° D: 150°","output":"Let the slope angle of the line x- sqrt {3}y=3 be theta in (0^circ, 180^circ),   then tantheta= frac {1}{ sqrt {3}} = frac { sqrt {3}}{3}, solving this gives theta=30^circ.

We are given that for any point ( M ) on this plane, the distance ( AM ) is less than at least one of the distances ( BM ) or ( CM ). 2. **Points on a Straight Line**:    First, we need to establish that points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) must lie on a single straight line. Suppose they do not lie on the same line. In that case, there exists a point ( M ) inside the triangle formed by ( triangle ABC ) which is equidistant from all three vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). Such a point ( M ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ), where ( MA = MB = MC ), contradicting the given condition that ( AM ) is less than at least one of ( BM ) or ( CM ). Therefore, points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) must be collinear. 3. **Relative Positions**:    Next, we need to determine the specific collinear arrangement of points. Consider the scenario where ( A ) is considered between ( B ) and ( C ). If point ( B ) were to lie between ( A ) and ( C ), there would exist many points ( M ) on the plane such that ( AM > BM ) and ( AM > CM ). This would similarly violate the given condition. Hence, ( B ) cannot lie between ( A ) and ( C ). 4. **Conclusion on the Relative Positions**:    Similarly, if ( C ) were to lie between ( A ) and ( B ), the given condition would again fail as many points ( M ) would exist such that ( AM > BM ) and ( AM > CM ). Both scenarios are therefore impossible. 5. **Final Arrangement**:    The only possible arrangement satisfying the given condition is when points ( B ), ( A ), and ( C ) lie on a straight line with ( A ) positioned between ( B ) and ( C ).

Then, there exists an integer (a) such that (n equiv a^2 pmod{p}). Applying Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer (a) where (a notequiv 0 pmod{p}), we have (a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}), gives:    [    n^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv (a^2)^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}.    ]    Hence, (n in B) and thus, (A subseteq B). 3. **Cardinality of Set (A):**    Let (n in A).

Key topics tested include reasoning and proof, as well as combinations and permutations. The critical step is to understand the definition of the double factorial and know which numbers are involved in its product. Let's analyze the propositions based on the double factorial definition: 1. **Proposition ①** states that boxed{• = 2016!}. This statement is essentially defining the factorial of 2016 as the product of every second number from 2 up to 2016, and then multiplying by the product of every second number from 1 up to 2015. Therefore, • in this context represents the double factorial separated into the product of even and odd integers, which when combined give the factorial of 2016. Thus, proposition ① is **correct**.  2. **Proposition ②** deals with 2016!!. Since 2016!! represents the product of all even integers from 2 to 2016, we have 2 cdot 4 cdot 6 cdots 2014 cdot 2016.

Hence, 2016!! = 2^{1008} cdot 1008!, which means proposition ② is also **correct**. 3. **Proposition ③** considers the units digit of 2015!!. Since 2015!! is the product of all odd numbers from 1 to 2015, its units digit is determined by the repetitive pattern in the units digits of the product of odd numbers, which is known to cycle back to 5 (as in 1 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 9). Consequently, the units digit of 2015!! is indeed 5. Therefore, proposition ③ is **correct**. 4. Lastly, **Proposition ④** addresses the units digit of 2014!!. Here, 2014!! is the product of all even numbers up to 2014, and since it includes the number 10, the units digit of the entire product must be 0. This makes proposition ④ **correct**.

A coin can only be placed on a free spot. The player who cannot make a move loses. Prove that the first player always has a winning strategy.","output":"1. **Initial Setup:**     The first player places a coin exactly at the center of the rectangular table. This initial move is crucial because it serves as a reference point for all subsequent moves. 2. **Symmetry Strategy:**     After placing the first coin at the center, the first player adopts a strategy of placing their coins symmetrically in response to the second player's moves. Specifically, whenever the second player places a coin at a certain position, the first player will place their coin at the mirror image of that position with respect to the center of the table.     This strategy can be visualized as follows: Suppose the center of the table is at the coordinates (0,0). If the second player places a coin at (x,y), then the first player will place their next coin at (-x,-y). This symmetry ensures that every time the second player finds a valid place to put a coin, the first player will also have a corresponding valid place to put a coin. 3. **Ensuring Valid Moves:**     Using this strategy, the first player always has the opportunity to make a move as long as the second player can make a move. The key point here is that for every coin placement by the second player, there is a corresponding symmetric position on the table that is still available for the first player.  4. **Game Completeness:**     Finally, note that the game will end after a finite number of moves because the number of coins that can fit on the rectangular table is finite. The table has a limited surface area, and after a certain number of moves, there will be no free space left for any additional coins.      Since the first player always mirrors the second player's moves, the first player's last move will always come after the second player's last move, ensuring that the first player never runs out of moves before the second player does.  # Conclusion By placing a coin at the center initially and then using a mirroring strategy for every subsequent move, the first player ensures they always have a move to make, while the second player is forced into a position where they cannot make a move first. Thus, the first player can always win. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Assess the statement, If n is not a prime number, then n+3 is a prime number.

By the translation, the coordinates transform as:    [    begin{cases}     x = x' - h      y = y' - k     end{cases}    ] 2. Substitute these transformations into the given parabola equation ( y = -x^2 ):    [    y' - k = -left( x' - h right)^{2}    ]    Hence, the equation of the parabola after translation is:    [    y' = -(x' - h)^{2} + k    ] 3. The vertex of this new parabola is at ( (h, k) ). 4. Since the translated parabola passes through the origin ((0, 0)), we substitute ((x', y') = (0, 0)) into the equation:    [    0 = -(0 - h)^{2} + k     ]    which simplifies to:    [    0 = -h^{2} + k implies k = h^{2}    ]     5.

To find the ( x )-intercepts of the translated parabola, set ( y'(x') = 0 ):    [    0 = -(x' - h)^{2} + h^{2}     ]    Solving for ( x' ), we get:    [    (x' - h)^2 = h^{2}     ]    Taking the square root on both sides:    [    x' - h = pm h     ]    therefore:    [    x' = h + h = 2h quad text{or} quad x' = h - h = 0    ] 7. The ( x )-intercepts are ( x' = 0 ) and ( x' = 2h ), thus the base of the triangle formed with the ( x )-axis is ( 2h ). 8. The height of the triangle is the ( y )-coordinate of the vertex, ( h^{2} ). 9. Using the area formula for a triangle ( text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} ), we have:    [    frac{1}{2} times 2h times h^{2} = 1    ]    Simplifying:    [    h cdot h^{2} = 1 implies h^{3} = 1    ] 10. Solving for ( h ):     [     h = sqrt[3]{1} = 1     ] 11. Given ( k = h^{2} ), we have ( k = 1^{2} = 1 ). 12.

Note: A doubly stochastic matrix of order  n  is a  ntimes n  matrix, all entries are nonnegative reals, and the sum of entries in each row and column is equal to 1.","output":"1. **Define the Problem in Graph Theory Terms:**    - We are given a doubly stochastic matrix ( A ) of order 100. This means ( A ) is a ( 100 times 100 ) matrix where all entries are nonnegative, and the sum of entries in each row and each column is equal to 1.    - We need to find the greatest constant ( lambda ) such that we can pick 150 entries from ( A ) such that if the other 9850 entries are replaced by 0, the sum of entries in each row and each column is at least ( lambda ). 2. **Construct a Bipartite Graph:**    - Construct a bipartite graph ( G ) with vertices ( R = {r_1, r_2, ldots, r_{100}} ) representing rows and ( C = {c_1, c_2, ldots, c_{100}} ) representing columns.    - Draw an edge between ( r_j ) and ( c_k ) if ( x_{j,k} geq lambda ). 3. **Matching Condition:**    - The constant ( lambda ) works if and only if the graph ( G ) has a matching involving at least 50 rows. This ensures that we can pick 150 cells such that the sum of entries in any row or column is at least ( lambda ). 4. **Proof of Sufficiency:**    - If the graph has a matching ( A to B ) where ( A ) is a set of 50 rows, then for each row not in ( A ), we add the maximum element in that row (if not already added), and for each column not in ( B ), we add the maximum element in that column. This ensures we pick at most 150 cells and the sum of elements in any row or column is at least ( lambda ). 5. **Proof of Necessity:**    - We need to show that we can find a matching of 50 in any 150 cells that we pick such that each row and each column has a sum of picked cells at least ( lambda ).    - Let ( S ) be the set of rows that have exactly 1 chosen cell, ( T ) be the set of columns that have exactly 1 chosen cell. Let ( U ) be the set of chosen cells in both ( S ) and ( T ); ( S_2 ) be the set of chosen cells in ( T ) but not in ( S ), and ( T_2 ) be the set of chosen cells in ( S ) but not in ( T ).    - If ( T_2 ) covers ( k ) columns and ( S_2 ) covers ( m ) rows, then there exists a matching of size ( |U| + k + m ). 6. **Minimization Argument:**    - Assume for the sake of contradiction that ( |U| + k + m leq 49 ).    - Focus on the ( (100 - |U|) times (100 - |U|) ) subgrid where the rows and columns containing elements of ( U ) are discarded.    - Consider the quantity:      [      X = # text{ chosen squares } - # text{ rows } - # text{ columns } + k + m      ]    - Initially, ( X geq 0 ), which implies that the number of chosen squares in this subgrid is at least ( 2(100 - |U|) - k - m ). This and the number of squares in ( U ) gives a total of ( 200 - (|U| + k + m) ), so we are done. 7. **Construction of the Matrix:**    - Let ( x_{j,k} = 0 ) if ( 1 leq j leq 25 ) and ( 1 leq k leq 24 ).    - Let ( x_{j,k} = frac{1}{75} ) if ( 26 leq j leq 100 ) and ( 1 leq k leq 24 ).    - Let ( x_{j,k} = frac{1}{76} ) if ( 1 leq j leq 25 ) and ( 25 leq k leq 100 ).    - Let ( x_{j,k} = frac{17}{1900} ) if ( 26 leq j leq 100 ) and ( 25 leq k leq 100 ). 8. **Proof of Optimality:**    - Consider a bipartite graph with vertices ( {r_1, ldots, r_{100}} ) representing rows and ( {c_1, ldots, c_{100}} ) representing columns. Draw an edge between ( r_j ) and ( c_k ) if ( x_{j,k} geq frac{17}{1900} ).    - It suffices to prove there exists a matching of size at least 50.    - Let ( S ) be a set of rows such that ( |N(S)| - |S| ) is minimized. We claim ( |N(S)| - |S| geq -50 ).    - The set of cells in ( S cap N(S) ) have sum greater than ( |N(S)| ) by algebra.    - We can biject ( R setminus S ) to ( C setminus N(S) ) because if not, Hall's condition is violated.    - For some ( T subset R setminus S ), there are at most ( |T| - 1 ) columns in ( C setminus N(S) ) that have a neighbor in ( T ), then:      [      |N(S cup T)| - |S cup T| = (|N(S)| - |S|) + (|N(T) setminus N(S)| - |T|) < (|N(S)| - |S|)      ]      contradicting the minimality of ( |N(S)| - |S| ).    - We can also construct an injection from ( N(S) ) to ( S ) because otherwise, say some ( U subset N(S) ) has ( |N(U)| < |U| ), then ( N(S setminus N(U)) subset N(S) setminus U ) and we are done by minimality.    - This allows us to construct a matching of size at least ( |N(S)| + |R setminus S| = |R| - (|S| - |N(S)|) = 50 ).

Begin by applying the well-known inequality:    [    frac{lambda a^2 + mu b^2 + nu c^2}{3} geq (lambda mu nu a^2 b^2 c^2)^{1/3}    ]    This inequality is a result of the weighted Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality), which states that for any non-negative real numbers x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n and corresponding positive weights alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_n such that alpha_1 + alpha_2 + cdots + alpha_n = 1, we have:    [    alpha_1 x_1 + alpha_2 x_2 + cdots + alpha_n x_n geq x_1^{alpha_1} x_2^{alpha_2} cdots x_n^{alpha_n}    ]    For our case:    [    frac{lambda a^2}{lambda + mu + nu} + frac{mu b^2}{lambda + mu + nu} + frac{nu c^2}{lambda + mu + nu} geq (a^2 b^2 c^2)^{frac{lambda}{lambda + mu + nu} cdot frac{mu}{lambda + mu + nu} cdot frac{nu}{lambda + mu + nu}}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{lambda a^2 + mu b^2 + nu c^2}{lambda + mu + nu} geq (abc)^{frac{2}{lambda + mu + nu}}    ] 3. Now rearrange the inequality to focus on the area Delta of the triangle.

Let ( A ) be the natural number we seek. If we append ( A ) to itself, the resulting number will be ( overline{AA} ). This can be expressed as ( (10^n + 1)A ), where ( n ) is the number of digits of ( A ). Denote this number as ( B^2 ), where ( B ) is an integer. 2. Assume ( 10^n + 1 ) can be factored into primes such that each prime factor appears only once. Since ( B^2 ) is divisible by ( 10^n + 1 ), ( B ) must also be divisible by ( 10^n + 1 ). 3. If ( B ) is divisible by ( 10^n + 1 ), then:    [    B = k(10^n + 1) quad text{for some integer} k    ]    Consequently, we have:    [    B^2 = (k(10^n + 1))^2 = k^2(10^n + 1)^2    ]    Since we originally set:    [    (10^n + 1)A = B^2    ]    it implies:    [    (10^n + 1)A = k^2 (10^n + 1)^2    ]    Therefore, ( A = k^2(10^n + 1) ). 4. For ( A ) to be a natural number, it should be smaller than ( 10^n + 1 ) (since ( A ) is a factor considered before squaring), which is generally impossible because ( k ) is at least 1 and ( 10^n + 1 times 1 = 10^n + 1 ). This leads to ( k geq 1 ). This contradiction shows that factors in ( 10^n + 1 ) cannot all be distinct primes. 5. To ensure a feasible solution, at least one prime factor must repeat in the factorization of ( 10^n + 1 ), in other words, there must be a repeated prime in the prime factorization.

Thus, we have: begin{align*} S &= frac{1}{2}a cdot frac{1}{6} = frac{1}{2}b cdot frac{1}{10} = frac{1}{2}c cdot frac{1}{14}  a &= 12S, quad b = 20S, quad c = 28S. end{align*} From these expressions, we can see that a < b < c, which means that c is the longest side of the triangle and is opposite the largest angle, let's call this angle alpha. Next, we apply the Law of Cosines to find cosalpha, which can tell us about the nature of angle alpha. According to the Law of Cosines: [ cosalpha = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}. ] Plugging in the values of a, b, and c we obtained: begin{align*} cosalpha &= frac{12^2S^2 + 20^2S^2 - 28^2S^2}{2 cdot 12S cdot 20S}  &= frac{144S^2 + 400S^2 - 784S^2}{480S^2}  &= -frac{240S^2}{480S^2}  &= -frac{1}{2} < 0. end{align*} Since cosalpha < 0, this indicates that angle alpha is greater than 90^circ, or in other words, it is an obtuse angle. Therefore, the triangle must be an obtuse triangle.

Each side of the triangles is divided into ( n ) equal segments by placing ( n-1 ) points on each side. By drawing line segments between corresponding points on each side of the triangles, the rhombus is divided into ( 2n^2 ) equal triangles.

(Write complex and long texts)","output":"In the vast expanse of the unknown cosmos, there exists a strange rogue planet named Chaos. This enigmatic celestial body is a blue gas giant, roughly the size of Jupiter, and its surface is entirely covered in a shade of blue known as \\"free speech blue\\" or #3f48cc. The lack of distinct stripes and layers on the planet's map adds to its eerie and ominous aura, giving rise to nightmares for those who dare to study it. Scientists are baffled by Planet Chaos, as its origin remains a mystery. It is uncertain whether Chaos is a natural occurrence or the work of an incredibly advanced and malevolent civilization. Its lack of a mantle and core suggests that it could possibly be a hollow planet, adding even more intrigue to its already perplexing nature. One of the most astonishing qualities of Chaos is its ability to move and warp drive through space, giving it a seemingly sentient and malicious personality. It takes pleasure in tormenting and victimizing alien homeworlds with intelligent life, engaging in acts of bullying, abuse, and even consumption for its own twisted amusement. Beneath the blue clouds that engulf Chaos, an unnerving fog hangs in the air, further adding to the planet's nightmarish qualities. Its rocky brown crust, which scientists speculate could be made of actual excrement, creates an even more unsettling atmosphere for those who encounter this cosmic terror. Chaos possesses apocalyptic superpowers that it unleashes upon unsuspecting alien homeworlds. It has the ability to hurl asteroids, pulling planets into their Roche limits, causing cataclysmic destruction. Using its telekinetic abilities, Chaos can generate thunderous sounds and instigate earthquakes, tearing worlds asunder. Additionally, it has the power to spread deadly plagues, unleash electromagnetic pulses, and emit deadly stellar flares that radiate gamma rays. Furthermore, Chaos can summon and manipulate black holes and rain down nuclear warheads, leaving devastation in its wake. Among its many supernatural abilities, Chaos's elemental superpower lies in its capacity to hurl radioactive asteroids. This deadly combination of abilities highlights the incomprehensible and terrifying potential of this rogue planet. The existence of Chaos raises profound questions about its true nature. Is it a natural celestial phenomenon or the product of an extraordinarily advanced and malevolent civilization? How did it acquire sentience and harness such devastating powers? These questions occupy the minds of scientists and researchers who tirelessly search for a solution to neutralize Chaos's destructive tendencies. In their pursuit to unlock the secrets behind the existence of Chaos, scientists and researchers dedicate themselves to finding a way to halt or contain its reign of terror. It is their hope that through their unwavering efforts, they will be able to discover a means to counteract its malevolence and bring peace to the countless worlds that have fallen victim to its destructive path. Only time will tell if they will succeed in their mission or if Chaos will continue its relentless onslaught on the universe."},{"instruction":"Chapter 1.1: Beginning of Apocalypse Chaos approached inner Solar system and entered Earth system, apocalypse has begun. Chaos uses elemental superpower combination of hurling asteroids and emitting radioactivity. Chaos hurls big radioactive asteroids into Yellowstone supervolcano, causing a cataclysmic eruption that sent ash clouds encircling the globe. Chaos used power to raining asteroids on Earth, summoning multiple of asteroids pollute into Solar system, Solar system falls into resemblance of protoplanetary Solar system. Orbit of Earth becomes slightly eccentric due to gravity of Chaos, Luna is no longer moon of Earth to become new planet. Chaos used power to spread deadly plagues across Earth, it playing game like Plague Inc., Chaos rapidly evolving plagues against humanity. Chaos left Earth and goes to orbit of Neptune, orbits of other dwarf planets become artificially different, orbit between Uranus and Neptune become nearer. Decade later, Chaos returned to Earth, Chaos used power to unleashes deadly stellar flares that burst gamma rays on Earth, second Carrington event happens, Chaos used power to unleashes electromagnetic pulses on Earth, civilizations on Earth goes blackout. Mercury collided with Venus to form new planet named Merenus, Earth goes near Jupiter, Earth is being almost ripped by Roche limit of Jupiter, orbit of Earth becomes eccentric. Earth has extreme seasons: Short and hot summer, long and cold winter. Luna moves nearer Sun, Neptune lost moon Triton to becomes new dwarf planet, Uranus collided with Neptune to form new planet named Neptanus. Chaos finally returned to Earth, Chaos used power to summon and manipulate black holes, black hole got accretion disk around Earth, Earth becomes tidally locked to black hole, black hole is devouring side of Earth is Pacific Ocean start to boiling, look like fall into eternal injury. Chaos used power to unleashes thunderous sounds to Earth, civilizations are broken, Chaos has left to Earth. Ceres and many other asteroids, comets, dwarf planets ejected from Solar system. Mars become new moon of Jupiter, Jupiter lost two moons are Io and Europa to become new dwarf planets, Saturn got dark spot because Luna collided with Saturn, Saturn lost two moons are Titan and Iapetus, Iapetus become new dwarf planet, Titan ejected from Solar system to becomes new rogue planet, Merenus captured two asteroids named Twjok and Aeacous as new moons that summoned by Chaos polluted Solar system with many summoned asteroids. Two new protoplanets were formed in artificial protoplanetary disk of Solar System, it named Ghieor and Liyanda, Ghieor is rocky planet orbits between Merenus and Jupiter, Liyanda is gas giant orbits between Neptanus and Phattie. Phattie, also known as Planet Nine, survived apocalypse, well it’s excellent. Two asteroid belts are gone broken to form massive new region named Asteroid Cloud, distance between near Sun and Phattie, Solar system is polluted with many asteroids and comets called Asteroid Cloud. Earth fall into red and fiery hellscape, wasteland contaminated with trashes and forming red lakes made of actual bloods, heavy volcanism and mass extinction of lifeforms happened. Atmosphere turned radioactive and foggy, fall into 800 Kelvin temperature. Earth becomes brown dwarf-like planet, ejected from Solar system and wandering in interstellar space. Atmospheric temperature of Earth will increase, Earth will becomes star in the future, humanity struggles to survive, leading to human extinction. Chaos left and ruined Solar system. (Write complex and longer texts)","output":"As Chaos approached the inner Solar system, the beginning of the apocalypse was marked. Utilizing its elemental superpower, Chaos combined the ability to hurl asteroids with emitting radioactivity. With a malevolent intent, Chaos directed big radioactive asteroids towards the Yellowstone supervolcano, triggering a cataclysmic eruption of unprecedented scale. Ash clouds enshrouded the globe, casting the world into darkness and chaos. Not content with this havoc, Chaos turned its attention to Earth. Raining down asteroids upon the planet, Chaos summoned a multitude of these cosmic projectiles, polluting the Solar system and transforming it into a semblance of a protoplanetary system. The orbit of Earth was profoundly affected by the gravitational pull of Chaos, leading to a slight eccentricity in its path. Luna, once Earth's faithful moon, was liberated from its previous role and became a newfound planet. Exerting its power further, Chaos spread deadly plagues across Earth, strategizing like a malevolent player in the game \\"Plague Inc.\\" These plagues rapidly evolved, posing an immense threat to humanity and pushing them to the brink of extinction. Having achieved its malicious objectives, Chaos departed from Earth and journeyed towards the orbit of Neptune. Its presence led to artificial alterations in the orbits of other dwarf planets, with a significant shift occurring between Uranus and Neptune. A decade later, Chaos returned to Earth, its intentions still veiled in malicious intent. Unleashing deadly stellar flares that emitted gamma rays, Chaos plunged the world into chaos once more. The catastrophic consequences were further exacerbated when Chaos unleashed electromagnetic pulses, causing civilizations on Earth to descend into a state of blackout and technological paralysis. The Solar system itself underwent dramatic transformations as Chaos's influence persisted. Mercury collided with Venus, merging to form a new planet named Merenus. Earth found itself perilously near Jupiter, with the Roche limit of the gas giant threatening to tear the planet apart. As a result, Earth's orbit became increasingly eccentric and unstable. Extreme seasons characterized the new reality on Earth, with short and scorching summers followed by long and bitterly cold winters. Luna embarked on a new path, drawing nearer to the Sun. Neptune, unable to withstand the gravitational dominance of Chaos, lost its moon Triton, which subsequently became a new dwarf planet. Uranus and Neptune, too, underwent a cataclysmic collision, giving rise to a new planet named Neptanus. Chaos's return to Earth marked one final devastating act. Utilizing its power to summon and manipulate black holes, it conjured a massive vortex with an accretion disk around Earth. The planet became tidally locked to the black hole, resulting in the Pacific Ocean boiling and the destruction of entire continents. It appeared as if Earth had fallen into an eternal state of torment and injury. The unleashing of thunderous sounds upon Earth shattered civilizations and reduced humanity to mere fragments of its former self. And then, Chaos departed from Earth, leaving behind a broken world. Ceres and many other asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets were ejected from the Solar system, their trajectories altered irreversibly. Mars, once a planet of its own, became a new moon of Jupiter. Jupiter itself lost two of its moons, Io and Europa, which transformed into new dwarf planets. Luna collided with Saturn, causing a dark spot to appear on the gas giant, while Saturn lost two of its moons, Titan and Iapetus. Iapetus, too, found its new designation as a dwarf planet. Titan, however, was violently expelled from the Solar system, turning into a rogue planet. The formation of two new protoplanets occurred within the artificial protoplanetary disk that Chaos had created. Named Ghieor and Liyanda, these celestial bodies took their places between Merenus and Jupiter, and Neptanus and Phattie, respectively. Phattie, often referred to as Planet Nine, miraculously survived the onslaught of Chaos, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. The destruction wreaked by Chaos had consequences beyond imagination. The formation of an immense Asteroid Cloud replaced what was once the asteroid belt. Stretching from the vicinity of the Sun to Phattie, this region of space was teeming with asteroids and comets. The pollution caused by Chaos's summoned asteroids further contaminated the Solar system, leaving it forever scarred. Earth, transformed into a red and fiery hellscape, stood as a barren wasteland. Trashes and debris littered the surface, turning the already desolate landscape into crimson lakes of actual blood. Severe volcanism and mass extinction events unfolded, clearing the remnants of once-thriving life forms. The atmosphere of Earth became radioactive and foggy, with temperatures soaring to an astonishing 800 Kelvin. In this bleak aftermath, Earth took on traits reminiscent of a brown dwarf-like planet. Eventually, it was ejected from the Solar system, wandering aimlessly in the cold expanse of interstellar space. As the atmospheric temperature continued to rise, Earth faced an uncertain fate, eventually transforming into a star in the distant future. Humanity's struggle for survival intensified, leading to the ultimate grim reality of human extinction. Chaos, having left its indelible mark on the Solar system, moved on to new conquests, leaving a trail of destruction and despair in its wake. The once thriving system, now broken and scarred, served as a constant reminder of the omnipotent power of Chaos and the fragility of the universe itself."},{"instruction":"基于SSM的员工管理系统","output":"基于SSM架构的员工管理系统是一个用于管理员工信息的系统，主要包括员工的基本信息管理、部门管理、职位管理以及员工的薪资管理等模块。系统采用SpringMVC+Spring+MyBatis的开发框架，通过前端页面与后台数据库交互来实现员工管理的各项功能。 系统的主要功能包括： 1. 员工信息管理：包括添加员工、编辑员工信息、删除员工等操作。系统可以对员工信息进行增删改操作，并且可以根据条件进行查询员工信息。 2. 部门管理：可以添加、编辑、删除部门信息，并可以查看部门下的所有员工信息。 3. 职位管理：可以添加、编辑、删除职位信息，并可以查看该职位下的所有员工信息。 4. 薪资管理：可以录入员工的薪资信息，并可以对薪资信息进行查询和修改等操作。 系统的设计原则是简洁、易用、扩展性强，并且系统的功能齐全、稳定性好。通过使用SSM框架的优势，系统可以实现业务逻辑的分层，提高代码的复用性和可维护性。同时，系统还可以通过使用MyBatis的ORM技术，将对象与数据库表进行映射，简化数据库操作。 总之，基于SSM架构的员工管理系统能够有效地管理员工信息，在提高管理效率的同时，也提供了一个稳定可靠的信息管理平台。该系统可以满足企业对员工信息管理的需求，提高管理水平和效率。"},{"instruction":"基于SSM的员工管理系统国内外研究","output":"基于SSM的员工管理系统的国内外研究有很多，以下是一些相关的研究论文和文章： 国内研究： 1. 《基于SSM的员工信息管理系统设计与实现》：该论文详细介绍了基于SSM框架的员工信息管理系统设计与实现过程，重点讨论了数据库表设计、页面布局和功能模块划分等方面。 2. 《基于SSM的员工绩效管理系统设计与实现》：该论文介绍了一种基于SSM框架的员工绩效管理系统，包括绩效考核指标设定、绩效评估流程、绩效报表生成等功能的设计和实现。 3. 《基于SSM的员工培训管理系统研究与设计》：该论文研究了一个基于SSM框架的员工培训管理系统，包括培训需求分析、培训计划制定、培训资源管理等功能的设计与实现。 国外研究： 1. 《Employee Management System Based on SSM Framework》：该论文介绍了一种基于SSM框架的员工管理系统，包括员工信息管理、薪资管理、考勤管理等功能。同时，还介绍了系统的架构设计、技术选型和实现过程。 2. 《Design and Implementation of Employee Management System Based on SSM framework》：该论文介绍了一个基于SSM框架的员工管理系统的设计与实现。其中包括员工信息管理、权限管理、请假管理等功能的设计与实现过程。 3. 《Development of Employee Management System Based on SSM》：该论文研究了一个基于SSM框架的员工管理系统，主要包括员工信息管理、薪资管理、考勤管理等功能的设计与实现。同时，还讨论了系统的性能测试和用户体验评估等方面。 这些研究论文和文章对于基于SSM的员工管理系统的设计与实现提供了一些借鉴和参考，可以帮助研究人员更好地理解和应用SSM框架。"},{"instruction":"Rephrase the follwing sentence Another limitation is that, the study considered for the pharmacodynamic effect of indapamide following a single dose and for up to 12 hours post dosing.","output":"One more constraint is that the study only focused on the pharmacodynamic effect of indapamide after a single dose and within a 12-hour time frame following the dosage."},{"instruction":"check plagiarism: Another limitation is that, the study considered for the pharmacodynamic effect of indapamide following a single dose and for up to 12 hours post dosing.","output":"I apologize, but I cannot check for plagiarism as I can only provide assistance with rephrasing and generating content."},{"instruction":"rephrase : Regarding genetic polymorphism, several studies indicated the effect of uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UGT2B7) polymorphism on metabolism and pharmacodynamic responses of different therapeutic agents.","output":"Multiple studies have demonstrated the impact of uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UGT2B7) polymorphism on the metabolism and pharmacodynamic reactions of various therapeutic agents, concerning genetic polymorphism."},{"instruction":"dragon ball all characters in style.

В основе синергетического подхода лежит идея, что объект исследования является сложной системой, состоящей из взаимосвязанных элементов, которые взаимодействуют между собой и образуют новое качественное состояние – синергию. Синергетический подход в исследовании объекта предполагает не только анализ его отдельных компонентов, но и изучение взаимодействия между ними и оценку эффекта, который проявляется в результате этого взаимодействия. Таким образом, синергетический подход позволяет увидеть объект исследования как целостную систему и выявить особенности его функционирования, которые нельзя объяснить, изучая его отдельные части. Основные принципы синергетического подхода в исследовании объекта включают: 1. Принцип нелинейности. Система может проявлять неожиданные и нелинейные характеристики в результате взаимодействия ее компонентов. 2. Принцип самоорганизации. Система способна организовать свое функционирование и структуру без внешнего вмешательства. 3. Принцип флуктуаций и возмущений. Мелкие случайные возмущения могут иметь значительное влияние на поведение системы. 4. Принцип эмерджентности. Система имеет новые свойства и качества, которые не могут быть объяснены исключительно через изучение ее компонентов. Синергетический подход в исследовании объекта может быть применен в различных областях, таких как физика, биология, социология, экономика и др.

The resulting lack of oxygen and nutrients leads to a range of cellular changes, including the death of neurons in the affected area. This process, known as neurodegeneration, contributes to the long-term effects of stroke, such as cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction. In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in stroke. Researchers have identified several key pathways involved in neuronal death, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and excitotoxicity. Inflammation is a response of the immune system to injury, but if it is not properly controlled, it can lead to further tissue damage. Excitotoxicity occurs when there is an excessive release of neurotransmitters, leading to the overstimulation and death of neurons.","output":"中风是全球死亡和残疾的主要原因之一，主要是由于脑部血液供应中断所致。随之而来的氧气和营养物质的缺乏导致一系列细胞变化，包括受影响区域神经元的死亡。这个被称为神经退行性的过程，对中风的长期影响，如认知功能受损和运动功能障碍起到了作用。近年来，在理解中风神经退行机制方面取得了重要进展。研究人员已经确定了几个与神经元死亡有关的关键途径，包括氧化应激、炎症和兴奋毒性。炎症是免疫系统对损伤的反应，但如果没有得到适当控制，会导致进一步的组织损伤。兴奋毒性发生在神经递质过度释放时，导致神经元过度兴奋和死亡。"},{"instruction":"中译英： 学习能力较强，对景观设计有自己的认知，能够注重设计的实际落地性，关注设计原场地的问题，能够从解决问题的角度思考问题。 从园林植物配置作业中看出，已具备园林设计的基本能力，能突出表现对园林设计的思考能力。在其他课程的学习中也能展现较好的汇报、探索、创新能力。","output":"Strong learning ability, independent understanding of landscape design, able to focus on the practical implementation of design, pay attention to the issues of the original site, and able to think from the perspective of problem-solving.

(Write complex and long texts)","output":"As scientists delve deeper into their exploration of the mysterious planet Chaos, they are confronted with the mind-boggling question of its origin. Is Chaos a natural celestial phenomenon, or has it been created by an incredibly advanced and malevolent civilization? The answer to this question has significant implications for understanding the nature of the universe. The sheer scale and destructive power possessed by Chaos leaves scientists in awe and bewilderment. How did this planet acquire sentience and the ability to harness such devastating superpowers? The planet's ability to move and warp drive through space, coupled with its apocalyptic abilities, raises profound questions about the laws of physics and the limits of existence. One can only imagine the amount of knowledge and technological prowess required to create such a formidable entity. If Chaos is indeed the creation of an advanced civilization, it suggests the existence of a highly malevolent force capable of manipulating and tormenting other planets for sport. This raises ethical and moral questions about the implications of advanced technology falling into the wrong hands. The eerie and ominous aura of Chaos is further accentuated by its blue color, reminiscent of a free speech blue shade known as #3f48cc. This representation of the planet's atmosphere adds to the feeling of unease and nightmares associated with its presence. The foggy and unnerving environment beneath the blue clouds, coupled with the rocky brown crust that bears resemblance to actual feces, paints a truly nightmarish picture. Chaos employs a wide range of devastating superpowers to torment and torture alien homeworlds. From hurling asteroids and pulling planets into the Roche limit to telekinesis and generating thunderous sounds, it seems no method of destruction is beyond its reach. Earthquakes tear worlds asunder, deadly plagues are spread, electromagnetic pulses disrupt technological systems, deadly stellar flares radiate gamma rays, and nuclear warheads rain down upon unfortunate planets. One of Chaos's most unique abilities is its elemental superpower of hurling radioactive asteroids. This combination of hurling asteroids and emitting radioactivity creates an unprecedented level of devastation. The planet's ability to summon and manipulate black holes adds another layer of terror to its already formidable arsenal. Amidst all this destruction and chaos, scientists remain resolute in their search for answers. They tirelessly work to unlock the secrets behind Chaos's existence, hoping to find a way to neutralize its destructive tendencies.

Orbit of Earth becomes slightly eccentric due to gravity of Chaos, Luna is no longer moon of Earth to become new planet. Chaos used power to spread deadly plagues across Earth, it playing game like Plague Inc., Chaos rapidly evolving plagues against humanity. Chaos left Earth and goes to orbit of Neptune, orbits of other dwarf planets become artificially different, orbit between Uranus and Neptune become nearer. Decade later, Chaos returned to Earth, Chaos used power to unleashes deadly stellar flares that burst gamma rays on Earth, second Carrington event happens, Chaos used power to unleashes electromagnetic pulses on Earth, civilizations on Earth goes blackout. Mercury collided with Venus to form new planet named Merenus, Earth goes near Jupiter, Earth is being almost ripped by Roche limit of Jupiter, orbit of Earth becomes eccentric.

With its elemental superpower combination of hurling asteroids and emitting radioactivity, Chaos unleashed a wave of destruction on Earth and beyond. Its actions would forever reshape the face of our Solar system. In a devastating move, Chaos aimed its power at the Yellowstone supervolcano, hurling big radioactive asteroids into its depths. The cataclysmic eruption that followed sent ash clouds encircling the globe, shrouding the world in darkness. Chaos continued to rain asteroids upon the Earth, polluting the Solar system with multiple celestial bodies that resembled a protoplanetary system. The gravitational pull of Chaos caused Earth's orbit to become slightly eccentric, leading to dramatic changes within our own celestial neighborhood. Luna, our loyal moon, was no longer bound to Earth and transformed into a new planet. Chaos continued its onslaught by spreading deadly plagues across the Earth, mirroring the game-like mechanics of Plague Inc. These plagues rapidly evolved, posing a significant threat to humanity. Leaving Earth for a time, Chaos took up orbit around Neptune, disrupting the orbits of other dwarf planets within the Solar system. The orbit between Uranus and Neptune drew nearer, forever altering the delicate balance of our celestial neighbors. A decade later, Chaos returned to Earth with more destructive power than ever before. Unleashing deadly stellar flares that emitted gamma rays, Chaos created a second Carrington event, disrupting technological systems across the planet. Electromagnetic pulses further plunged civilizations into darkness and chaos. The very fabric of society began to unravel. During Chaos's absence, more unexpected changes occurred. Mercury collided with Venus, forming a new planet named Merenus. Earth found itself moving dangerously close to Jupiter, teetering on the edge of being ripped apart by its Roche limit. Extreme seasons wreaked havoc, with short and scorching summers followed by long and bitterly cold winters. Luna, now free from Earth, moved closer to the Sun, while Neptune lost its moon Triton, which became a new dwarf planet. Uranus and Neptune collided, forming a planet known as Neptanus. As Chaos unleashed its devastating power on Earth once again, it summoned and manipulated black holes, resulting in a black hole with an accretion disk engulfing the planet. Earth became tidally locked to the black hole, with the Pacific Ocean boiling and creating an eternal scar. Thunderous sounds echoed across the Earth, signaling the breaking of civilizations. Ceres, along with many other asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets, were ejected from the Solar system. Mars became a new moon of Jupiter, while Saturn lost two of its moons, Io and Europa, transforming into a dark spot. The lost moon Iapetus became a new dwarf planet, and Titan was expelled from the Solar system, becoming a rogue planet. Merenus captured two asteroids, named Twjok and Aeacous, as new moons, further polluting the Solar system with Chaos's summoned asteroids. Out of the chaos, two new protoplanets emerged from the artificial protoplanetary disk of the Solar system. Ghieor, a rocky planet, orbited between Merenus and Jupiter, while Liyanda, a gas giant, held its place between Neptanus and Phattie, also known as Planet Nine. These survivors of the apocalypse witnessed the complete transformation of our Solar system. The once recognizable asteroid belts shattered, forming a massive new region known as the Asteroid Cloud. Stretching from near the Sun to Phattie, the Solar system became polluted with countless asteroids and comets, posing a constant danger to any remaining celestial bodies. In its final act of devastation upon Earth, Chaos showered the planet with asteroids once again. Raining down an unfathomable number of nuclear warheads, Chaos used its telekinetic powers to pull Earth dangerously close to its Roche limit. The planet came close to being torn apart, teetering on the edge of destruction. And then, Chaos departed from Earth, leaving behind a world forever altered. Earth fell into a red and fiery hellscape, its surface contaminated with trash, forming crimson lakes that resembled actual blood. Heavy volcanism and mass extinctions wiped out countless lifeforms. The atmosphere became radioactive and foggy, with temperatures soaring to 800 Kelvin. Earth transformed into a brown dwarf-like planet, ejected from the Solar system and left to wander in the depths of interstellar space. As the atmospheric temperature continued to rise, Earth held the seeds of its own fate. In the distant future, it would become a star, yet humanity struggled to survive. The struggle eventually led to human extinction. Chaos had left its mark, ruining the once-vibrant Solar system. In the wake of Chaos's destructive rampage, our understanding of the universe and our place within it was shattered. The cosmos had proven itself to be a volatile and unpredictable realm, highlighting the fragile existence of life itself.

Using object destructuring, the value of that property will be assigned to the \`variable\` variable. Here's an example to illustrate this: \`\`\`javascript function someFunction() { return { variable: \\"Hello, World!\\", }; } const { variable } = someFunction(); console.log(variable); // Output: Hello, World! \`\`\` In the above code, \`someFunction()\` returns an object with the \`variable\` property. Using object destructuring, the value of \`variable\` is extracted from the returned object and assigned to the \`variable\` variable."},{"instruction":"If variable: “Hello, World!”, was instead varbl: “Hello, World!”, then would const { variable } = someFunction(); work?","output":"No, if the property in the returned object is named \`varbl\` instead of \`variable\`, the destructuring assignment \`const { variable } = someFunction();\` would not work correctly.

What does \\"composable\\" mean, here?","output":"1) My apologies for the confusion. Yes, you are correct. In your previous question, if the property in the returned object is named \`varbl\` instead of \`variable\`, then the destructuring assignment \`const { variable } = someFunction();\` would not work correctly. 2) In the context of Vue.js, \\"composable\\" refers to a specific pattern or approach for organizing and reusing logic in your Vue components. Composables are functions or sets of functions that encapsulate a specific piece of functionality and can be composed together to create more complex behavior in a modular way. The useDisplay composable you mentioned would typically provide logic and functions related to managing the display of certain elements in a Vue component. By using composable functions like useDisplay, you can easily reuse and share this functionality across different components, improving code readability and maintainability. For example, a useDisplay composable might provide functions for toggling the visibility of an element, tracking whether it is currently visible, or handling animations related to displaying or hiding the element. These functions can be used in multiple components without having to duplicate the logic."},{"instruction":"So, is a composable in Vue like a POJO in Java?","output":"No, a composable in Vue.js is not the same as a Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO) in Java. In Vue.js, a composable is a reusable function or set of functions that encapsulate a specific piece of logic or functionality. Composables are typically created using the Composition API, a new syntax introduced in Vue 3, which allows you to organize and reuse logic in a more modular way. Composables can be used to encapsulate data, computed properties, methods, and other reusable logic. On the other hand, a Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO) in Java refers to a simple object that only contains properties and values, without any behavior or methods associated with it. In Java, POJOs are commonly used for holding and transferring data between different parts of an application, such as in serializing or deserializing data. The main difference is that a composable in Vue.js is a function or set of functions that provides modular and reusable logic for Vue components, while a POJO in Java is a simple data container without any additional behavior or logic attached to it."},{"instruction":"Морозильная камера 250 литров, чтоб было мало шума , само размораживается и чтоб не был китайский компрессор из какая есть морозильная камера до 30.000 рублей","output":"В пределах бюджета до 30,000 рублей можно найти следующие варианты морозильных камер: 1.

While the Bretons achieved some victories, it was ultimately the Angles and Saxons who emerged victorious, establishing the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England. One of the main Breton victories over the Angles and Saxons occurred in the mid-6th century when King Budic II of Brittany allied with King Arthur, the legendary British leader, to fight against the invading Angles and Saxons. Though the battle that ensued is subject to much speculation and myth, traditional narratives suggest that Arthur and Budic led a successful campaign against the invaders, defeating them in several battles. Another significant Breton victory unfolded around the year 577, when the legendary King Waroch I of Brittany faced the Anglo-Saxon leader, Childebert I, at the Battle of Dyrham. The Bretons managed to prevail over the Saxons in this battle, thwarting their attempts to expand their territory westward. However, these victories were temporary, and the tide eventually turned in favor of the Angles and Saxons. The Bretons faced continued pressure from the invaders, and by the late 6th and early 7th centuries, their resistance began to falter. The Anglo-Saxons gradually gained control over significant parts of present-day England, eventually establishing their own kingdoms. The final significant victory for the Angles and Saxons came in the 7th century, known as the Battle of Deorham in 577. This battle saw the defeat of the Bretons by the joint forces of the Anglo-Saxon kings Ceawlin of Wessex, Ceol of West Gwent, and Aethelberht of Kent. As a result, the Saxons gained control over the important British city of Bath, further expanding their territories in the region. Ultimately, the Bretons were unable to defeat the Angles and Saxons decisively, leading to the establishment of numerous Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and the gradual assimilation of the Britons living in England. Despite their earlier victories, the Bretons were gradually pushed westward into the region known today as Brittany."},{"instruction":"Main celtic British victories against the Angles and Saxons until the final victory of the barbarians","output":"The Celtic Britons faced numerous conflicts against the Angles and Saxons during the 5th to 7th centuries. While they achieved some victories, the overall outcome was the establishment of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England. One of the significant British victories occurred in the early 5th century when the Romano-British leader, Vortigern, hired Saxon mercenaries to help defend against the Picts and Scots. However, the Saxons turned on their British allies and started seizing territories for themselves. Eventually, the Britons, under the leadership of Ambrosius Aurelianus, defeated the Saxons in the Battle of Mount Badon, possibly around the year 500. This victory halted the Saxon advance for some time and allowed the Britons to maintain their independence. Another notable victory took place in the early 6th century under the leadership of King Arthur, the legendary British hero. Many stories and myths surround Arthur's campaigns against the invading Angles and Saxons. The Battle of Mons Badonicus is often attributed to Arthur, where he supposedly led the Britons to a decisive victory against the Saxons. However, historical documentation about Arthur is scarce, and the details of his military success are debated among historians. Despite these victories, the Anglo-Saxons gradually gained the upper hand. They established numerous kingdoms such as Wessex, East Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria, pushing the Britons westward and southward. The Britons faced successive defeats and struggled to unite against the invaders. The final major defeat for the Celtic Britons occurred in the Battle of Deorham in 577. The Anglo-Saxon leader Ceawlin of Wessex overcame the resistance of the Britons, led by kings Conmail and Condidan. This victory allowed the Anglo-Saxons to extend their control into southwestern England, including the important city of Bath. After the Battle of Deorham, the Britons retreated to their strongholds in Cornwall, Wales, and present-day Brittany, where they continued to resist but were gradually assimilated or absorbed by the dominant Anglo-Saxon culture. The final victory of the Anglo-Saxon invaders led to the establishment of lasting Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England and the displacement of the Celtic Britons from their ancestral lands."},{"instruction":"Write a detailed story of Tracer bursting out of a realistic Zarya skin suit.","output":"Once upon a time in the city of London, during a cosplay convention, there was an incredibly talented cosplayer named Sarah. Sarah was known throughout the convention for her attention to detail and her ability to bring fictional characters to life through her extraordinary costumes. For this year's convention, Sarah had decided to challenge herself by creating a realistic Zarya skin suit from the popular video game Overwatch. Every minute detail of the muscular Russian hero's outfit was recreated meticulously by Sarah. The suit was made with a combination of foam, fabric, and various other materials, ensuring its incredible lifelike appearance. As the convention kicked off, Sarah attracted a crowd of admirers with her stunning Zarya cosplay. People marveled at the sheer physicality of the costume, with its contoured muscles and authentic armor. People eagerly lined up to take photographs with her, unable to resist the temptation of being close to such an incredible work of art. However, little did Sarah know that her costume was about to take on a life of its own. As she posed for one photograph after another, she suddenly felt a strange tingling sensation in her legs, spreading rapidly throughout her body. Confused, Sarah frantically tried to understand what was happening, but it was too late. In an astonishing and mystifying turn of events, the Zarya skin suit started to pulsate with energy, the seams stretching and bulging. The crowd gasped in awe as the costume began to vibrate violently. Suddenly, with an explosive burst, Tracer, the energetic and time-warping British hero from Overwatch, burst out of the Zarya skin suit, in a flurry of temporal energy. Chaos erupted as convention-goers scattered in every direction, utterly startled by this unpredictable turn of events. Sarah stood stunned, her mouth agape, unable to process what had just unfolded. Tracer, still recovering from her unusual entrance, grinned cheekily at the baffled onlookers before regaining her composure. With a genuine British accent and a witty remark ready to go, Tracer took the microphone from the startled convention host and began to address the bewildered crowd. She thanked them for their warm welcome and explained that she had mistakenly been trapped within the Zarya skin suit, unable to escape until now. As the crowd began to settle down, Tracer's infectious energy spread throughout the convention hall. People approached her with new excitement, eager to engage in conversation and take photographs. Sarah, once again finding her voice, explained how she had unknowingly channeled her passion and creativity into creating not just a costume, but a portal into the Overwatch universe. In the following days, the convention went down in history as the most memorable one ever. Sarah became an overnight sensation, hailed as the cosplayer who had inadvertently brought Overwatch heroes to life. Tracer, appreciating the serendipity of the situation, stayed by Sarah's side, enchanting attendees with her carefree spirit and time-jumping abilities. Eventually, the convention came to a close, but not without leaving an indelible mark on the world of cosplay. Sarah continued to create incredible costumes, her talents sought after by enthusiasts from all corners of the globe. And while Tracer bid farewell to the convention, she always remained a cherished character within Sarah's heart, a manifestation of her passion and creativity. And thus, the tale of Sarah's realistic Zarya skin suit and Tracer's unexpected burst into reality became a legend, inspiring cosplayers for generations to come and reminding us that sometimes, art truly has the power to transcend our wildest imaginations."},{"instruction":"names of Proto-Indo-European dog breeds, please","output":"Proto-Indo-European is the hypothetical ancestral language of most European and many Asian languages, and it existed around 4,500 to 2,500 BCE. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that specific dog breeds existed during that time. However, it is believed that dogs were domesticated by humans during the Proto-Indo-European period.

Ovcharka (Shepherd Dog): A large and powerful dog used for guarding livestock. 2. Barak (Hound): A hunting dog used for tracking and chasing game. 3. Volkodav (Wolfhound): A dog bred for hunting and protection, specifically against wolves. 4. Psovaya Sobaka (Sighthound): A type of dog with great speed and keen eyesight used for hunting fast prey, such as hares or deer. 5. Pinczow (Terrier): A small breed of dog used for hunting smaller game, such as rats or foxes. 6. Strazny Pes (Guard Dog): A general term used for dogs trained for guarding purposes. 7. Gonchaya Sobaka (Scenthound): A dog specifically bred for tracking prey using its sense of smell.

The St. Hubert Hound was a large scent hound breed that originated in Belgium. It was highly skilled in tracking scents and was commonly used for hunting purposes. Over time, different breeding programs and regional variations led to the development of distinct breeds, including the Dachshund, which is known for its elongated body and short legs, and the German Hound, which is recognized for its excellent scent tracking abilities.

The Spitze, also known as the German Spitz, is an ancient type of dog that was characterized by its small size, foxy face, and thick, double-coated fur. It is believed that the Spitze served as the foundation for these three distinct breeds through selective breeding and regional variations. The Dachshund was selectively bred from the Spitze to have a long body, short legs, and a scent hound's tracking abilities, which made it proficient in hunting badgers and other burrowing animals. The German Hound (Deutsche Bracke) was also developed from the Spitze but with a focus on its scent-tracking abilities. This breed was traditionally used for hunting various game, including small game, large game, and even wounded animals. The Pomeranian Dog, despite its small size today, has a shared ancestry with the larger German Spitz dogs. Over the years, the Pomeranian was selectively bred to become a smaller companion breed with a distinctive fluffy coat.

Nonetheless, here are a few significant events in the struggle between the native Britons and the Angles and Saxons: 1. Battle of Mons Badonicus (ca. 500): This battle, mentioned in the Historia Brittonum, is believed to be a major victory for the Britons against the Anglo-Saxons. Led by a British leader, possibly King Arthur, the Britons are said to have successfully defended against the advancing Anglo-Saxon armies. 2. Battle of Dyrham (577): After several decades of Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Britons, led by their king, Gildas, fought the advancing Saxons in what is now southern England. The Britons were defeated, and this battle marked the continued encroachment of the Anglo-Saxons into British territory. 3. Battle of Mount Badon (ca. 500s): Another potential victory for the Britons, attributed to King Arthur, although the historicity of this battle is debated. It is purported to have halted the Anglo-Saxon advance temporarily. 4. Battle of Chester (616): This battle saw the West Saxons, led by King Æthelfrith, defeat the British kingdom of Powys. The Anglo-Saxon victory further diminished British resistance in the north. 5. Battle of Deorham (577): The West Saxons, led by their king, Ceawlin, decisively defeated the Britons of the Kingdom of Dumnonia in modern-day southwest England. This victory allowed the Saxons to extend their control into parts of what is now modern-day Wales. It is essential to note that despite some victories, the Anglo-Saxons gradually established their dominance in much of Britain over several centuries. By the 7th century, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms had largely supplanted the native Britons, leading to the formation of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The final \\"victory of the barbarians\\" is a subjective term and can be interpreted in different ways, but it generally refers to the eventual establishment of Anglo-Saxon rule and culture in England."},{"instruction":"Chapter 1.1: Beginning of Apocalypse Chaos approached inner Solar system and entered Earth system, apocalypse has begun.

(Write complex and longer texts)","output":"Chapter 1.1: The Beginning of the Apocalypse As Chaos made its way through the inner Solar system, Earth's fate was sealed. The apocalypse had begun. Possessing a combination of elemental superpowers, Chaos wreaked havoc by hurling asteroids and emitting deadly levels of radioactivity. The first target was the Yellowstone supervolcano. Chaos sent massive, radioactive asteroids hurtling toward the volcano, triggering a cataclysmic eruption that sent ash clouds encircling the globe. But Chaos wasn't satisfied with just one disaster. Using its power, Chaos summoned countless asteroids to rain down upon Earth, polluting the Solar system. The once static and organized system now fell into chaos, resembling a protoplanetary Solar system. The orbit of Earth itself became slightly eccentric due to the gravitational pull of Chaos, causing Luna, the Earth's moon, to break free and become a new planet. With a thirst for destruction, Chaos spread deadly plagues across Earth, seemingly playing a twisted game reminiscent of Plague Inc. Chaos rapidly evolved these plagues in its ongoing battle against humanity. After causing untold devastation, Chaos left Earth and headed towards the orbit of Neptune. Its presence caused the orbits of other dwarf planets in the system to shift artificially, with the space between Uranus and Neptune becoming narrower. A decade later, Chaos returned to Earth, ready to unleash even more devastation. It began by unleashing deadly stellar flares that burst forth gamma rays, similar to the infamous Carrington event. Chaos then disrupted all forms of communication by unleashing electromagnetic pulses, plunging civilizations on Earth into darkness. The impact of Chaos's actions continued to reshape the Solar system. Mercury collided with Venus, forming a new planet named Merenus. Earth found itself dangerously close to Jupiter and was on the verge of being torn apart by Jupiter's Roche limit, causing Earth's orbit to become eccentric and resulting in extreme seasons with short, scorching summers and long, freezing winters. Luna, no longer bound to Earth, moved closer to the Sun. Neptune lost its moon Triton, which became a new dwarf planet. Uranus collided with Neptune, forming a new planet named Neptanus. Chaos, not content with its previous destruction, continued its assault on Earth. This time, Chaos summoned and manipulated black holes, leading to the creation of an accretion disk around Earth. The planet became tidally locked to the black hole, causing the Pacific Ocean to boil and Earth to seem trapped in eternal agony. Chaos's next attack came in the form of thunderous sounds that shattered civilizations. Ceres and many other asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets were ejected from the Solar system. Mars became a new moon of Jupiter, while two of Jupiter's moons, Io and Europa, became new dwarf planets. Saturn acquired a dark spot after Luna collided with it, and it lost two moons - Titan and Iapetus. Iapetus became a new dwarf planet, while Titan was ejected from the Solar system, becoming a rogue planet. Meanwhile, Merenus captured two asteroids, named Twjok and Aeacous, as new moons. These asteroids had been summoned by Chaos, further polluting the Solar system with the debris it summoned. In this chaotic new environment, two new protoplanets formed in an artificial protoplanetary disk - Ghieor, a rocky planet that orbits between Merenus and Jupiter, and Liyanda, a gas giant that orbits between Neptanus and Phattie. Phattie, also known as Planet Nine, managed to survive the apocalypse, adding a glimmer of hope. The destruction caused the two asteroid belts to break apart, forming a massive new region known as the Asteroid Cloud. The Solar system was now contaminated with many asteroids and comets, making travel between the Sun and Phattie a hazardous endeavor. And yet, Chaos was not done with Earth. It returned once more, showering the planet with asteroids, and raining down massive numbers of nuclear warheads. With a display of telekinesis, Chaos pulled Earth dangerously close to its Roche limit, nearly tearing the planet apart before finally departing. Left in Chaos's wake, Earth transformed into a red and fiery hellscape, covered in vast wastelands contaminated with debris and forming crimson lakes made of actual blood. Heavy volcanism ravaged the planet, leading to mass extinctions of countless lifeforms. The atmosphere became radioactive and foggy, and the temperature soared to a blistering 800 Kelvin. Once the thriving blue jewel of the Solar system, Earth now resembled a brown dwarf-like planet. It was ejected from the Solar system, left to wander in the depths of interstellar space. The atmospheric temperature of Earth would continue to increase as it journeyed through the cosmos, eventually turning the planet into a star in the distant future. Humanity, faced with this bleak reality, struggled to survive, ultimately succumbing to extinction. Chaos had left its mark, completely decimating the once vibrant Solar system."},{"instruction":"请帮我提供一个详细的短视频脚本，主题是：瘦下来我的生活有哪些变化。","output":"片头画面：白底黑字，标题为《瘦下来我的生活有哪些变化》。 镜头一：主角打开衣柜，一件件拿出原本太小的衣服，摆在床上。 主角（笑着）：大家好，我是XXX，今天要和大家分享一下我瘦下来后生活的变化。 镜头二：主角拿出一张自己胖时的照片，对比着当前的自己。 主角：首先，让我们看一下我的变化。这是我两年前的照片，可以看到我当时身材真的非常胖。 镜头三：主角穿上以前的太小的衣服，然后站在镜子前，自豪地展示自己瘦下来的身材。 主角：现在，我成功地减掉了40斤，重新拥有了自信和健康的身体。 镜头四：主角开始描述瘦下来后生活的变化。 主角：第一个变化是我的食欲控制得更好了。以前，我总是无节制地吃零食和高热量食物，导致体重不断增加。但现在，我学会了控制自己的食量和选择更健康的食物。 镜头五：主角拿出一盘色彩鲜艳、健康营养的水果沙拉，放在桌子上。 主角：这是我的新宠，水果沙拉，它不仅美味，而且非常有益健康。现在，我每天都会吃一份水果沙拉，以满足我对甜食的渴望，同时又不担心摄入过多的热量。 镜头六：主角戴上运动手环，开始跑步。 主角：另一个变化是我开始关注运动。瘦下来后，我发现运动不仅能帮助我控制体重，还能增强身体的力量和耐力。 镜头七：主角在健身房里举重。 主角：现在，我每周至少三次去健身房进行健身训练，包括举重、有氧运动等。这不仅让我更有活力，还塑造了我的身材。 镜头八：主角穿搭自己瘦身后的衣服，展示自己的时尚打扮。 主角：随着身材的变化，我的穿搭也更新了起来。我可以尝试更多样式的衣服，自信地展现自己的时尚品味。 镜头九：主角握着一份健康的早餐，坐在阳台上享受早晨的阳光。 主角：最重要的是，我重新找回了对生活的热爱和活力。瘦下来后，我精力充沛，每一天都充满动力去追求自己的梦想。 片尾画面：主角站在户外，向镜头微笑。 主角：希望我的故事能够给正在减肥的朋友们一些鼓励和启发。只要你们坚持不懈，付出努力，一定能够改变自己，拥有更好的生活。 白底黑字出现：谢谢观看！ 结束"},{"instruction":"请帮我提供一个详细的短视频脚本，主题是：瘦了70斤，我的生活有哪些变化。可以包含学习生活、感情生活、身体健康、性格情绪、自信阳光等方面。不需要很一本正经的风格，希望有趣以及鼓励到胖胖的女孩子接纳自己，要有自信。","output":"片头画面：彩色字体滑入屏幕，标题为《瘦了70斤，我的生活有哪些变化》。 镜头一：主角穿着过大的衣服在镜子前夸张地扮鬼脸。 主角（开心地）：嗨，大家好！我是XXX，今天我要和大家分享一下我减肥成功后生活的种种变化。 镜头二：主角拿出一张自己胖时的照片，对比着当前的自己。 主角：首先，让我们来看一下我的变化。这是我瘦前的照片，可以看到当时我胖得真的有点夸张。 镜头三：主角戴上眼镜，头戴巨大的草帽。 主角：说到变化，学习生活是我感受最直接的方面之一。以前，因为胖得不得了，我感到自己在学校里总是个小小的背影，完全不自信。 镜头四：主角换上适合的衣服，从书架上拿起一本书。 主角：但随着我减肥的进展，我意识到自己的价值不应该被外貌所定义。我开始更加专注于我的学业，用知识赋予自己的力量。 镜头五：主角在朋友聚会上开怀大笑，与朋友们互动。 主角：而在感情生活方面，我发现自己变得更加开放和自信。以前，我总是不敢接触异性，害怕被嫌弃。但现在，我敢主动与人交流、结交朋友，重新找到了真正属于我的幸福。 镜头六：主角举起哑铃做运动。 主角：当然，健康身体也是我减肥带给我的重要变化之一。我开始关注运动和饮食，每天坚持锻炼，保持健康的生活习惯。 镜头七：主角戴上太阳眼镜，滑板穿梭在城市街道上。 主角：性格情绪方面，减肥让我变得更加积极活泼、阳光自信。我敢追求自己的梦想，勇敢面对生活中的挑战。 镜头八：主角在镜子前自信地展现自己的笑容。 主角：最最重要的是，我重新找回了对自己的自信。我不再为自己的外貌而自卑，我接受自己的不完美，因为我知道，真正的美丽来自内心。 片尾画面：主角坐在花园里，享受阳光。 主角：我希望我的故事能够鼓励胖胖的女孩子，接纳自己的不足，拥有自信和阳光。无论你是什么样子，都有权利追求自己的幸福和成长。 白底黑字出现：你，是最美丽的自己！ 结束"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(Write complex and longest texts)","output":"Chapter 1.1: The Beginning of the Apocalypse As Chaos approached the inner Solar system, the once peaceful Earth system was thrown into turmoil, marking the beginning of an apocalyptic era. Chaos possessed an elemental superpower combination, capable of hurling asteroids and emitting deadly radioactivity. With these powers, Chaos hurled enormous, radioactive asteroids towards the Yellowstone supervolcano, triggering a cataclysmic eruption of unprecedented proportions. The resulting ash clouds encircled the globe, plunging the world into darkness and chaos. Not content with the devastation caused by the Yellowstone eruption, Chaos continued to rain asteroids upon Earth, summoning forth multiple celestial bodies that polluted the once pristine Solar system. The entire Solar system began to resemble a protoplanetary system, with Earth's orbit becoming slightly eccentric due to the gravitational influence of Chaos. Luna, once known as Earth's faithful moon, broke free from its orbit and became a new planet in its own right. But Chaos did not stop there. It unleashed deadly plagues across Earth, evoking a grim game reminiscent of \\"Plague Inc.\\" Humanity faced rapid and relentless evolution of these plagues, which presented an almost insurmountable challenge. Chaos then departed Earth, making its way to the orbit of Neptune. Other dwarf planets within the Solar system were artificially influenced, altering their orbits and creating new celestial configurations. The orbit between Uranus and Neptune drew nearer, forever changing the dynamics of the planets. A decade later, Chaos returned to Earth. This time, it unleashed deadly stellar flares, bursting forth with gamma rays that ravaged the planet. The cataclysmic event was akin to the second Carrington event, causing widespread destruction and disruption. Chaos then utilized its power to unleash electromagnetic pulses, throwing Earth's civilizations into a state of darkness and helplessness. In this ever-changing cosmic scenario, Mercury collided with Venus, giving rise to a new planet named Merenus, while Earth drew dangerously close to Jupiter. The Roche limit of Jupiter threatened to tear Earth apart, and its orbit became increasingly eccentric. As a result, Earth was subjected to extreme seasons, with short and scorching summers followed by long and freezing winters. Luna, the former moon of Earth, moved closer to the Sun, while Neptune lost its moon Triton, which eventually became a new dwarf planet. Uranus collided with Neptune, forming a hybrid planet known as Neptanus. Chaos, undeterred by the chaos it had already wreaked, summoned and manipulated black holes. Earth found itself tethered to a black hole, succumbing to tidal locking and being slowly engulfed by the Pacific Ocean. The Earth, it seemed, was on an eternal path of destruction. But Chaos was not finished yet. It unleashed thunderous sounds upon the Earth, shattering civilizations and plunging the world into disarray. Several celestial bodies, including Ceres and many other asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets, were ejected from the Solar system, scattering into the unknown. Mars, now a moon of Jupiter, added to the celestial realignment, while Saturn acquired a dark spot due to a collision with Luna. Two of Saturn's moons, Titan and Iapetus, were lost, with Iapetus joining the ranks of the dwarf planets. Amidst the chaos, Merenus captured two asteroids, Twjok and Aeacous, becoming new moons summoned by Chaos to further disrupt the polluted Solar system. Two new protoplanets, Ghieor and Liyanda, formed within an artificial protoplanetary disk. Ghieor, a rocky planet, now orbits between Merenus and Jupiter, while Liyanda, a gas giant, finds its place between Neptanus and Phattie. Phattie, also known as Planet Nine, miraculously survived the apocalypse. The once orderly asteroid belts were shattered, forming a massive new region known as the Asteroid Cloud, stretching the distance between the Sun and Phattie. The Solar system became polluted with countless asteroids and comets, leading to its new designation as the Asteroid Cloud. Chaos, at long last, returned to Earth. It again showered asteroids upon our planet, raining down an overwhelming number of nuclear warheads. Utilizing its telekinetic ability, Chaos pulled Earth into the Roche limit, threatening to tear the planet apart. And then, Chaos left Earth, leaving it as a desolate, red, and fiery hellscape. The land was contaminated with debris and formed red lakes, reminiscent of spilled blood. Heavy volcanism and mass extinctions decimated lifeforms on Earth. The atmosphere turned radioactive and enveloped the planet in a thick, foggy haze. Temperatures soared to extreme levels, reaching 800 Kelvin. Earth, once a vibrant oasis of life, transformed into a brown dwarf-like planet, ejected from the Solar system and left to wander aimlessly in interstellar space. As the atmospheric temperature continues to rise, Earth's fate is sealed. It will inevitably evolve into a star in the distant future. Humanity, struggling against insurmountable odds, fights for survival, but ultimately faces extinction. Chaos left in its wake a ruined and ravaged Solar system, once a celestial beauty now marred by destruction and devastation."},{"instruction":"Traduit ce qui suit en anglais :\\"bon début de semaine monsieur Abhilash.

(Write complex and longest texts)","output":"In the depths of the cosmos, Chaos emerged, bringing with it destruction and despair. With its formidable powers, Chaos launched a devastating assault on the inner Solar system, marking the beginning of the apocalypse. Using a combination of elemental superpowers, Chaos unleashed a torrent of asteroids and emitted dangerous levels of radioactivity. Yellowstone supervolcano, a dormant behemoth, became the target of Chaos' wrath as massive radioactive asteroids rained down upon it. The result was a cataclysmic eruption that sent ash clouds encircling the globe, plunging the planet into darkness and chaos. Not content with wreaking havoc on Yellowstone alone, Chaos turned its attention to Earth itself. Summoning multiple asteroids, Chaos contaminated the Solar system with these celestial bodies, causing it to resemble a protoplanetary system. The once familiar orbit of Earth became slightly eccentric under the influence of Chaos' gravity, leading to a significant change - Luna, our faithful moon, was stripped of its title and transformed into a new planet. As if this wasn't enough, Chaos then spread deadly plagues across Earth, reminiscent of a sinister game of Plague Inc. These plagues rapidly evolved, cleverly adapting to counteract humanity's feeble attempts to fight back. Chaos reveled in watching the world succumb to its malevolence as civilization crumbled under the weight of these deadly diseases. Satiated by the chaos it had sown, Chaos departed Earth and journeyed to the orbit of Neptune. With its otherworldly powers, Chaos disrupted the orbits of the dwarf planets, forcing them to follow artificially different paths. The once harmonious dance between Uranus and Neptune became altered, with their orbits drawing dangerously near to each other. A decade later, Chaos made its triumphant return to Earth. It unleashed deadly stellar flares, unleashing bursts of gamma rays that bathed the planet in destructive radiation. This marked the occurrence of a second Carrington event, disrupting all electronic systems and pushing civilizations into a state of darkness, helpless against Chaos' wrath. As Chaos continued its relentless assault, Earth found itself in the midst of a cosmic upheaval. Mercury and Venus collided, birthing a new planet known as Merenus. Earth, now near Jupiter, teetered on the brink of destruction as it was almost ripped apart by Jupiter's Roche limit. Its orbit became increasingly eccentric, leading to extreme seasons with short, scorching summers and long, freezing winters. Meanwhile, Luna, having moved nearer to the Sun, severed its ties with Neptune, transforming it into a new dwarf planet. Uranus collided with Neptune, giving rise to a peculiar hybrid planet named Neptanus. Chaos reveled in the chaos and disorder it had caused, reshaping the Solar system to suit its whims. Black holes, formidable forces of destruction, were next on Chaos' list. It summoned and manipulated these cosmic vortexes, ensnaring Earth within their grasp. An accretion disk formed around the planet as it became tidally locked to the black hole. The side of Earth facing the black hole began to boil as the Pacific Ocean turned into an eternal inferno. To add to the torment, Chaos unleashed thunderous sounds upon the planet, shattering civilizations and leaving them in disarray. Ceres and numerous other asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets were violently ejected from the Solar system, leaving chaos in their wake. Mars, the red planet, became a mere moon in Jupiter's orbit. Jupiter, stripped of two of its moons, Io and Europa, now became a dwarf planet itself. Saturn acquired a dark spot as Luna collided with it, and it lost two of its moons, Titan and Iapetus, with the latter becoming a dwarf planet. Titan was expelled from the Solar system, becoming a rogue planet, forever wandering the vastness of space. Merenus, the newly formed planet, captured two asteroids named Twjok and Aeacous as its moons, summoned into the Solar system by Chaos. These celestial bodies, tainted by Chaos' influence, polluted the once serene Solar system. Within this chaos, two new protoplanets emerged from the artificial protoplanetary disk. Ghieor, a rocky planet, found its orbit between Merenus and Jupiter, while Liyanda, a massive gas giant, settled between Neptanus and Phattie. The surviving Phattie, also known as Planet Nine, stood as a testament to Chaos' relentless power. The asteroid belts, once unified, shattered into a massive new region now known as the Asteroid Cloud. Extending from near the Sun to Phattie, this region became a haven for countless asteroids and comets. The once pristine Solar system now lay polluted and scarred. Chaos, having wreaked havoc on the Solar system, returned once again to Earth. It resumed its onslaught, pelting the planet with a deluge of asteroids and raining down an unthinkable number of nuclear warheads. With its telekinetic powers, Chaos pulled Earth dangerously close to its own Roche limit, threatening to tear the planet apart. In the aftermath of Chaos' departure, Earth experienced unimaginable devastation. It descended into a fiery hellscape, its surface transformed into a barren wasteland ensnared by trashes and red lakes made of actual blood. Volcanic eruptions ravaged the land, while mass extinctions decimated countless life forms. The once vibrant atmosphere turned radioactive and foggy, as temperatures soared to a scorching 800 Kelvin. Earth, transformed into a brown dwarf-like planet, was unceremoniously ejected from the Solar system, left to wander aimlessly in the vastness of interstellar space. As Earth drifted, its atmospheric temperatures continued to rise, ultimately reaching a point where it would ignite and become a star. But this future was devoid of any survivors; humanity had been pushed to the brink of extinction. Chaos, with its malevolent power, had achieved its dark purpose - to leave behind a ravaged Solar system, forever scarred by its presence."},{"instruction":"Write a detailed story of Zarya, from oVerwatch, walking into a bathroom and closing the door behind her.

Lost in her thoughts, Zarya reached into her mouth and pulled out the compact voice changer. It was a small device that allowed her to alter her vocal patterns, an essential tool to mask her identity when covert operations required her to blend into the shadows. Placing it delicately on the sink, she paused for a moment, her hand hesitating above the zipper at the back of her head. As her fingers delicately danced over the strands of her thick, mane-like hair, she could feel the hidden zipper's cool presence beneath her touch. It was a mechanism designed to meld seamlessly with her appearance, concealing her true nature while posing as someone else entirely. In her line of work, the ability to adapt and assume different personas was invaluable. Summoning her resolve, Zarya took a deep breath, grasping the small metal tab of the zipper tightly. The cool sensation of the metal against her skin sent a shiver of anticipation down her spine. With measured precision, she gently pulled the zipper down, revealing a hidden seam along her back. As the zipper descended, a rush of cool air enveloped her, causing her skin to tingle and her senses to heighten. It was a remarkable feeling, as if she were unzipping the confines that bound her true self. In that moment, Zarya shed the cloak of her powerful exterior, revealing the true face that lay concealed beneath her facade. With a sigh of relief, Zarya gingerly removed her face, her hands cradling the sculpted visage that she had worn as her public persona. The face of Zarya slid away, revealing the mysterious countenance of Tracer hiding beneath. The transformation was astounding and surreal, a testament to the advanced technology at the forefront of Overwatch's arsenal. With a vibrant sparkle in her mischievous eyes, Tracer's true self radiated through. The freckles that adorned her cheeks were now visible, the exuberance and zest for life that defined her personality shining brightly. She reveled in the liberation that came with revealing her true face, if only for a fleeting moment. The momentary respite allowed Tracer to reflect on the reasons behind the elaborate deception. The mission at hand was of paramount importance, involving a complex web of intrigue and danger that required her to step into the shoes of another Overwatch hero. The intricate false flesh suit she wore was a marvel of engineering, a testament to the lengths Overwatch would go to protect the world. Carefully, Tracer secured her disguised face back onto her head, the zipper gliding smoothly along the hidden seam. It aligned perfectly, restoring her external appearance to that of the staunch and unwavering Zarya. The transition was seamless, and Tracer marveled at the deceptive power of her disguise. Taking one last look at her reflection in the mirror, Tracer couldn't help but feel a mixture of gratitude and resolve. The sacrifices, the choices, and the secrets she held were the burdens of a hero. She was determined to see her mission through, to protect Overwatch and the world from the encroaching threats that loomed. With a renewed sense of purpose, Tracer straightened her posture, her energy replenished. She exited the bathroom, leaving behind the brief sanctuary it offered. As she reentered the world, Zarya's powerful presence filled the void once more, her broad frame exuding strength and authority. The weight of the world settled back onto Zarya's shoulders, but this time, there was a glimmer of Tracer's spirit within her. She carried the memory of her true face, a reminder that beneath the layers of deception, she remained a hero with a profound purpose. And so, Zarya pushed forward, ready to face whatever challenges awaited her. The bathroom door swung closed behind her, temporarily closing the door on the world within. With each determined step, Zarya carried the legacy of her true self while embracing the guise of a hero that Overwatch relied on."},{"instruction":"Проверь этот скрипт Проверь этот скрипт Проверь этот скрипт /** * @name NitroPerks * @website https://github.com/JPabloNB/NitroPerks * @source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPabloNB/NitroPerks/main/NitroPerks.plugin.js * @updateUrl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPabloNB/NitroPerks/main/NitroPerks.plugin.js */ /*@cc_on @if (@_jscript) // Offer to self-install for clueless users that try to run this directly. var shell = WScript.CreateObject(\\"WScript.Shell\\"); var fs = new ActiveXObject(\\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\\"); var pathPlugins = shell.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(\\"%APPDATA%BetterDiscordplugins\\"); var pathSelf = WScript.ScriptFullName; // Put the user at ease by addressing them in the first person shell.Popup(\\"It looks like you've mistakenly tried to run me directly. n(Don't do that!)\\", 0, \\"I'm a plugin for BetterDiscord\\", 0x30); if (fs.GetParentFolderName(pathSelf) === fs.GetAbsolutePathName(pathPlugins)) { shell.Popup(\\"I'm in the correct folder already.\\", 0, \\"I'm already installed\\", 0x40); } else if (!fs.FolderExists(pathPlugins)) { shell.Popup(\\"I can't find the BetterDiscord plugins folder.nAre you sure it's even installed?\\", 0, \\"Can't install myself\\", 0x10); } else if (shell.Popup(\\"Should I copy myself to BetterDiscord's plugins folder for you?\\", 0, \\"Do you need some help?\\", 0x34) === 6) { fs.CopyFile(pathSelf, fs.BuildPath(pathPlugins, fs.GetFileName(pathSelf)), true); // Show the user where to put plugins in the future shell.Exec(\\"explorer \\" + pathPlugins); shell.Popup(\\"I'm installed!\\", 0, \\"Successfully installed\\", 0x40); } WScript.Quit(); @else@*/ module.exports = (() => { const config = { \\"info\\": { \\"name\\": \\"NitroPerks\\", \\"authors\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"lemons\\", \\"discord_id\\": \\"407348579376693260\\", \\"github_username\\": \\"respecting\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"Shimoro\\", \\"discord_id\\": \\"427406422733619200\\", \\"github_username\\": \\"Shimoro-Rune\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"JPabloNB\\", \\"discord_id\\": \\"270700802488795136\\", \\"github_username\\": \\"JPabloNB\\" } ], \\"version\\": \\"1.3.9\\", \\"description\\": \\"Set clientsided animated avatar and profile banner, share your screen at 60fps 1080P and use cross-server and animated emojis everywhere!

The decision greatly impacts the network's breakfast programming landscape, as CITV programming fills the void left by the abrupt departure. The controversial incident occurred during a live broadcast, when a presenter, whose identity remains undisclosed, made an unacceptable racial slur. The remark instantly caused outrage among viewers, prompting a flood of complaints to both ITV and Ofcom, the UK's regulator for broadcasting and telecommunications. Recognizing the severity of the situation and the need for swift action, ITV immediately launched an internal investigation into the incident, engaging external experts to conduct an impartial review of the matter. Serious discussions were held regarding disciplinary actions, but ultimately, ITV decided to terminate the presenter's contract given the gravity of the offense. ITV's CEO, John Whittingdale, expressed his deep disappointment and apology for the incident, stating, \\"We have a zero-tolerance policy towards racism or any form of discrimination. The comment made was utterly unacceptable and in direct violation of ITV's values and editorial guidelines.\\" Whittingdale added, \\"We are committed to ensuring all our programming remains inclusive, respectful, and aligns with the high standards expected by our viewers.\\" As a consequence of Good Morning Britain's cancellation, the network faced a significant programming challenge to find a suitable replacement. Ultimately, CITV programming, aimed at younger audiences, was chosen to fill the vacant morning slot temporarily. The decision to replace a hard-hitting news show with children's programming highlights ITV's commitment to swiftly addressing the controversy and ensuring audiences are not subjected to any further inappropriate content. ITV is aware of the disruption this sudden change will cause for regular Good Morning Britain viewers, but it aims to provide a responsible, diverse, and engaging alternative. CITV will air a mix of educational children's programs, including entertaining and informative content designed to appeal to children and provide a constructive start to their day. Whittingdale concluded with a promise to prioritize the rebuilding of trust with audiences. He emphasized that ITV will continue to reinforce diversity and inclusivity measures throughout the organization, ensuring the incident serves as a catalyst for stricter guidelines and greater training to foster a culturally sensitive workplace. The decision to cancel Good Morning Britain and replace it with CITV programming remains a bold move by ITV, as the network takes a strong stance against any form of racism or offensive language.

The network, acknowledging its failure to uphold the standards expected of a morning news show, has announced that CITV programming will now occupy the time slot in a permanent capacity. Following the cancellation of Good Morning Britain due to the racially insensitive comment made by one of its presenters, ITV faced immense backlash from the public and media watchdogs. The incident triggered a wave of discussions and debates surrounding the network's commitment to responsible journalism and unbiased reporting. Recognizing the enormity of the situation and the immense breach of trust, ITV's board of directors conducted a thorough review of their internal operations, including policies, management practices, and editorial guidelines. The results of this in-depth analysis led to a consequential decision: ITV can no longer be trusted to deliver a morning news show of the highest ethical standards. In an official statement, ITV's CEO, John Whittingdale, lamented the loss of confidence in the network's ability to uphold journalistic integrity, saying, \\"We take the concerns and criticisms raised by the public and regulators seriously. It is with heavy hearts that we acknowledge our failure and concede that ITV can no longer be trusted with a morning news show in its current form.\\" As a result, CITV programming, initially tapped temporarily as a replacement, will assume the role permanently. The morning slot will now be dedicated to children's programming that champions educational content and provides a safe and constructive environment for young viewers. Whittingdale further expressed that this strategic decision allows ITV to redirect its resources towards comprehensive reformation. He acknowledged the need for internal cultural shifts, better employee training, and stricter editorial guidelines to foster an inclusive, diverse, and responsible workplace culture that ITV viewers can trust. The news undoubtedly comes as a disappointment to regular viewers of Good Morning Britain, who relied on the show as a source of news and commentary. However, by permanently filling the morning slot with CITV programming, ITV intends to create an environment that exemplifies accountability and serves its younger audience effectively. Industry experts have widely commented on the ramifications of this unprecedented move, with many praising ITV's willingness to make difficult decisions to restore public confidence. However, concerns have also been raised about the potential impact on the network's overall viewership and reputation, particularly in the realm of news broadcasting. As the CITV programming becomes a permanent fixture, ITV remains committed to transparently addressing the issues that led to the cancellation of Good Morning Britain. The network vows to learn from its mistakes, institute wide-scale changes, and rebuild trust with its audience, all while ensuring that the CITV programming maintains its educational and entertaining qualities. ITV's decision to relinquish its morning license represents a seismic shift in the broadcasting landscape, and only time will reveal the true implications of this move.

Following the controversy surrounding a presenter's racially insensitive comment, the network has decided to physically tear apart the GMB set, symbolizing its commitment to eradicating the negative stain left by the incident. The decision to dismantle the studio comes as ITV continues to grapple with the fallout from the racial slur controversy. The offensive comment made by a GMB presenter during a live broadcast sent shockwaves through the public, resulting in a flood of complaints and widespread condemnation. Recognizing the seriousness of the matter, ITV's management team held extensive discussions about the appropriate steps to take. In a bold move, the network chose to physically deconstruct the GMB studio, ensuring a clean slate moving forward. John Whittingdale, CEO of ITV, explained the rationale behind the decision, stating, \\"We believe tearing down the GMB studio is a necessary symbol of our commitment to change and growth. The racist remark made by one of our presenters was not indicative of ITV's values, and we want to reinforce that message through tangible actions.\\" The deconstruction process, carried out by a professional team, was completed swiftly and efficiently. The dismantling began with the removal of the main set, including the iconic desk and backdrop that had been the backdrop to countless news stories. Cameras, lighting fixtures, and props were also removed, leaving the space bare and devoid of the recognizable GMB aesthetic. ITV's decision to destroy the physical remnants of GMB signifies a significant break from the past and a dedication to creating a new, respectful, and inclusive morning show in the future.

The decision comes as ITV aims to maximize the potential of its children's programming, bridging the gap left by GMB's cancellation and reaffirming its commitment to entertaining and educational content. While ITV's recent turmoil centered around the cancellation of GMB due to a presenter's racial slur, the CITV programming block has remained unaffected by the controversy.

(Write complex and longest texts)","output":"Chapter 1.1: Beginning of the Apocalypse As Chaos approached the inner Solar system and entered the Earth system, the apocalypse began. With its elemental superpower combination of hurling asteroids and emitting radioactivity, Chaos wreaked havoc on Earth. It began by hurling massive radioactive asteroids into the Yellowstone supervolcano, triggering a cataclysmic eruption that sent ash clouds encircling the globe. Not content with this devastation, Chaos summoned multiple asteroids, polluting the Solar system and causing it to resemble a protoplanetary system. The orbit of Earth became slightly eccentric due to the gravitational influence of Chaos, resulting in Luna, the moon, no longer being tethered to Earth but becoming a new planet. Chaos didn't stop there. It unleashed deadly plagues across Earth, playing a game similar to Plague Inc., rapidly evolving these plagues to further threaten humanity. Satisfied with its destruction, Chaos left Earth and traveled to the orbit of Neptune, where it artificially altered the orbits of other dwarf planets. The orbit between Uranus and Neptune became closer, resulting in a significant shift in the dynamics of the Solar system. A decade later, Chaos returned to Earth, using its power to unleash deadly stellar flares that burst gamma rays onto the planet. This event mirrored the historic Carrington event and was followed by Chaos unleashing electromagnetic pulses, throwing civilizations into a blackout. The catastrophic changes continued with the collision of Mercury and Venus, forming a new planet named Merenus. Earth was flung near Jupiter, dangerously close to the Roche limit, resulting in the destruction of the world as we know it. Extreme seasons emerged, with short and scorching summers and long and freezing winters. In this tumultuous time, Luna moved closer to the Sun, Neptune lost its moon Triton, transforming it into a new dwarf planet named Neptanus. Uranus collided with Neptune, forming another new planet named Neptanus. Chaos, not finished with its destructive path, summoned and manipulated black holes, causing Earth to be surrounded by an accretion disk. The planet became tidally locked to the black hole, with the side facing the black hole being devoured, resulting in the Pacific Ocean boiling. Thunderous sounds echoed across the Earth, shattering civilizations. Ceres and many other asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets were ejected from the Solar system, while Mars became the new moon of Jupiter. Jupiter lost two of its moons, Io and Europa, which became new dwarf planets. Luna collided with Saturn, leaving a dark spot on the planet and causing it to lose two moons, Titan and Iapetus. Iapetus became a new dwarf planet, while Titan was ejected from the Solar system, becoming a rogue planet. Merenus, the new planet, captured two asteroids, Twjok and Aeacous, as its moons. These asteroids, summoned by Chaos, polluted the Solar system with a multitude of new celestial bodies. In the chaotic aftermath, two new protoplanets formed in an artificial protoplanetary disk of the Solar System. They were named Ghieor and Liyanda, with Ghieor being a rocky planet that orbits between Merenus and Jupiter, and Liyanda being a gas giant that orbits between Neptanus and Phattie. Phattie, also known as Planet Nine, managed to survive the apocalypse relatively unscathed. However, the once beautiful Solar system now lay in ruin, with two asteroid belts breaking apart to form a massive new region called the Asteroid Cloud. The distance between the Sun and Phattie was now polluted with countless asteroids and comets. Finally, Chaos returned to Earth, showering it with more asteroids and raining down a massive number of nuclear warheads. Using its telekinesis, Chaos pulled Earth dangerously close to its Roche limit. The planet nearly ripped apart but miraculously survived as Chaos left, leaving Earth to fall into a red and fiery hellscape. This wasteland was contaminated with debris and formed red lakes made of actual blood. Heavy volcanism and mass extinction of lifeforms occurred, while the atmosphere turned radioactive and foggy, resulting in extreme temperatures of 800 Kelvin. Earth transformed into a brown dwarf-like planet, ejected from the Solar system, and now wandering in interstellar space. The atmospheric temperature of Earth would continue to increase, eventually transforming it into a star in the distant future. As humanity struggled to survive, it ultimately faced extinction. Chaos had left its mark on the once beautiful Solar system, forever altering its destiny."},{"instruction":"بعبب","output":"أرجو التوضيح أكثر، هل تقصد ترحيب بالفعل \\"أهلاً وسهلاً\\" أو هل تعني شيئًا آخر؟"},{"instruction":"Hellow","output":"Hello!

Я шел по лесу и увидел ручей. Мне захотелось пить, и я напился из ручья. В тот же момент я почувствовал, что не могу больше стоять на двух ногах. Ноги мои начали проседать и подкашиваться, и я упал на четвереньки. Мне вспомнилась легенда, что в этом лесу есть ручей, и если из него напиться, то превратишься в овцу.","output":"Упав на четвереньки, я почувствовал, что что-то странное происходит с моим телом. Волосы на моей коже стали разрастаться, превращаясь в густую шерсть, а руки и ноги начали сужаться и округляться. Я понял, что легенда о превращении в овцу оказалась правдой. Сердце забилось от страха, а у меня не было возможности произнести ни слова. Я пополз на четырех конечностях, стараясь сохранить хоть какую-то нить человеческого сознания в своей новой овечьей форме. Пытаясь осознать происходящее, я решил, что должен найти способ разрушить проклятие и вернуться к человеческому облику. Мой взгляд остановился на маленькой норе у подножия дерева. Уверенность, что в этом месте я найду ответы, охватила меня. Придвигаясь ко входу в нору, я высвободил из горла звуки, которым по силам было только овце. Но кажется, что в этот раз моя попытка оказалась успешной. Из глубины норы послышался ответный блеяние. Это был лесной колдун по имени Ариус, который имел способность разрушить проклятие. Ариус вышел из норы, выглядел странным и волшебным, с длинной белой бородой и светящимися глазами. Он сказал, что мог предложить мне помощь, но это было возможно лишь в том случае, если я выполню для него сложное задание. Не имея другого выбора, я согласился. Ариус сказал, что чтобы разрушить проклятие, нужно найти и принести ему волшебный цветок, растущий в самом глубоком провале леса. Будучи решительным, я отправился в путешествие, теперь на четырех ногах, в поисках волшебного цветка. Преодолевая трудности и опасности, я шел вглубь леса, чувствуя, что время терпит определенную грань между жизнью овцы и человека. Минуло несколько дней, и наконец-то, я оказался перед горной рощей, которую описывали в легенде. Забравшись на вершину, я увидел перед собой благоухающий сад с цветками всех цветов радуги. В середине сада я увидел искомый волшебный цветок. Его прекрасные лепестки светились голубым огнем. С большой осторожностью, я подошел к цветку, зная, что теперь все зависит от него. Мне показалось, что он реагирует на мою близость, и в ответ мне казалось, что слышу нежный шепот. С отвагой, я вскочил и сорвал цветок, зажатый в зубах. Волшебная сила цветка пронзила меня, заполнив тело горячим теплом. Я почувствовал, как проклятие начало рассеиваться, а человеческая форма возвращалась ко мне. Восстановив свой прежний вид, я радостно вернулся к Ариусу, в руках у меня был цветок, который ему покажется. Ариус принял цветок, улыбнулся и сказал магические слова. Волшебная сила распространилась вокруг нас, и проклятие было разрушено навсегда. С благодарностью и облегчением, я смотрел на Ариуса, зная, что без его помощи я бы никогда не смог вернуться в человеческий облик. Он кивнул и молча исчез в своей норе, оставив меня с чувством невероятной признательности. Теперь, взяв урок из происшедшего, я осознал, насколько важно быть осторожным со всем, что встречается в лесу. I не забывать, что легенды могут оказаться правдой, и решив выпить из ручья, следует тщательно изучить предупреждения перед этим."},{"instruction":"تعریف مدیریت","output":"مدیریت یک فرآیند است که در آن منابع مختلفی برای رسیدن به اهداف مشخص مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرند. مدیریت شامل برنامه‌ریزی، سازماندهی، رهبری، کنترل و ارزیابی است که در کلیت به منظور رسیدن به اهداف سازمانی و بهره‌وری بهتر استفاده از منابع موجود صورت می‌گیرد. در مدیریت، مهمترین موارد شامل مدیریت منابع انسانی، مدیریت مالی، مدیریت زمان و مدیریت پروژه است."},{"instruction":"Морозильная камера чтоб было мало шума , само размораживается, чтоб не был китайский компрессор и чтоб задняя стенка была без решётки","output":"Вот несколько моделей морозильных камер, которые соответствуют вашим требованиям: 1.

However, there are some common features and trends seen in employee medical insurance plans: 1. Company Provided Health Insurance: Many employers offer group health insurance plans as part of their employee benefits package. These plans cover hospitalization expenses, medical treatments, and sometimes even pre-existing conditions. The coverage typically extends to the employee's immediate family members as well. 2. Cashless Treatment: Most employee health insurance plans provide cashless treatment at network hospitals. Employees can avail medical services without paying upfront, as the insurance provider settles the bill directly with the hospital. 3. Sum Insured: The coverage amount or sum insured offered varies from employer to employer. It generally ranges from a few lakhs to several lakhs of rupees. The sum insured may be fixed or may increase with the employee's tenure in the company. 4. Pre and Post Hospitalization Expenses: Many employee health insurance plans cover pre and post-hospitalization expenses for a specified period. This includes doctor consultations, diagnostic tests, and medication costs incurred before and after hospitalization. 5. Maternity Benefits: Some employers offer maternity insurance coverage to their female employees. This includes expenses related to childbirth, prenatal and postnatal care, and newborn coverage. 6. Critical Illness Coverage: Some organizations provide additional coverage for critical illnesses such as cancer, heart diseases, and organ transplants. This helps employees cope with expensive treatments and recovery costs associated with such conditions. It is important to note that these are general features and coverage can vary significantly based on the employer's selected insurance provider and policy terms.

Легенда о ручье меня напугала и я поспешил осмотреть свое тело. Однако, ничего необычного я не увидел, мои руки и лицо по-прежнему были человеческими. От переживаний, я с трудом поднялся на ноги, но они все равно поддавались и шатались. Мрачные мысли о том, что я можем превратиться в овцу, овладели моим разумом, и я, в панике, решил забыть про жажду и побыстрее покинуть этот лес. Я пополз вдоль ручья, попутно исследуя окружающую местность в поисках выхода. Каждый шаг был тяжелым, но я не сдавался, потому что надеялся, что эффект от напитка пройдет со временем. В глубине души все-таки не верил в эти легенды. Когда я уже начал терять надежду, вдали мелькнула фигура человека. Это был старый лесной житель, чья внешность вызывала у меня опасение и доверие одновременно. Он подошел ко мне и спросил, что со мной случилось. Я объяснил ему о своей потере сил и подозрениях, связанных с ручьем. Лесной житель улыбнулся и сказал, что легенда о превращении в овцу — всего лишь сказка, рассказываемая детям, чтобы они не искали неприятностей в лесу. Он взял меня за руку и помог пройти до самого конца ручья. Мои ноги все еще были неуверенными, но с каждым шагом становилось легче. Когда мы вышли на просторную поляну, я уже мог самостоятельно ходить. Лесной житель взял свернутый глиняный сосуд и помог мне из него напиться. Вода оказалась свежей и освежающей, а чувство слабости постепенно отступило. Когда я почувствовал, что в силах продолжить путь, я восхитился окружающей природой и благодушно поблагодарил лесного жителя за помощь. Мой приключенческий путь по лесу продолжился, и теперь я был уверен, что легенда о ручье была всего лишь мифом. Я больше не чувствовал ни слабости, ни признаков превращения в овцу. Вместо этого, я испытывал гордость и удовлетворение от своей силы и самостоятельности. Таким образом, я продолжил свое путешествие через лес, и каждое новое приключение привносило в мою жизнь новые уроки и опыт. Впереди были еще множество загадок и тайн, которые мне предстояло разгадать, но я не боялся, ведь я был одержим любопытством и жаждой новых приключений."},{"instruction":"how can i go to the UN think thank in the japan?","output":"To visit the UN think tank in Japan, you can follow these steps: 1.

As a result, Earth became tidally locked to the black hole, with the Pacific Ocean boiling and the planet seemingly falling into eternal destruction. Adding to the chaos, thunderous sounds reverberated across Earth, further shattering civilizations. Ceres and many other asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets were ejected from the Solar system. Mars became a moon of Jupiter, while Saturn acquired a dark spot due to a collision with Luna. Saturn lost two of its moons, Titan and Iapetus, with the latter becoming a new dwarf planet. Titan was ejected from the Solar system, becoming a rogue planet. Merenus, the newly formed planet, captured two asteroids named Twjok and Aeacous, which became its moons. These summoned asteroids polluted the Solar system in the wake of chaos. Two additional protoplanets, Ghieor and Liyanda, were formed within an artificial protoplanetary disk. Ghieor, a rocky planet, orbited between Merenus and Jupiter, while Liyanda, a gas giant, occupied the space between Neptanus and Phattie. Phattie, also known as Planet Nine, managed to survive the apocalypse relatively unscathed. However, the asteroid belts were no longer intact, and they fragmented into a massive new region called the Asteroid Cloud, spanning the distance between Phattie and the Sun. The Solar system became polluted with countless asteroids and comets, causing widespread destruction and chaos. Finally, chaos made its last return to Earth, showering it with asteroids and raining down a massive number of nuclear warheads. Utilizing its telekinetic abilities, chaos pulled Earth dangerously close to its own Roche limit, nearly tearing the planet apart. Chaos then left, leaving Earth to fall into a red and fiery hellscape. The once beautiful planet transformed into a desolate wasteland, contaminated with debris and crimson lakes resembling blood. Heavy volcanism ravaged the Earth, leading to a mass extinction of lifeforms. The atmosphere became highly radioactive and enveloped in a thick fog, causing temperatures to soar to 800 Kelvin. Earth now resembled a brown dwarf-like planet, ejected from the Solar system and left to wander in the vastness of interstellar space. The atmospheric temperature of Earth would continue to rise, eventually transforming it into a star in the distant future. Humanity struggled to survive in this harsh environment, ultimately leading to their extinction. Chaos had left its mark, forever altering the once beautiful Solar system into a ruined and devastated realm."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Я шел по лесу и увидел ручей. Мне захотелось пить, и я напился из ручья. В тот же момент я почувствовал, что что-то странное происходит с моим телом. Мне вспомнилась легенда, что в этом лесу есть ручей, и если из него напиться, то превратишься в женщину.","output":"Я решил не обращать внимания на легенду. Ведь кто может поверить в такую абсурдную и сказочную историю? Однако, постепенно со мной начали происходить странные изменения. Моя одежда стала велика для меня, как будто она ужесточилась и начала обтягивать мои новые кривые формы. Мурашки пробежали по моей коже, когда я ощутил, как мои волосы становятся длиннее и шелковистее. Мои плечи и грудь стали мягкими и округлыми, а моя кожа стала нежно-бархатистой. Кажется, моя борода стала исчезать, а мои губы стали более полными и чувственными. Сердце забилось сильнее, когда я осознал, что легенда была истинной. Я стоял перед ручьем, полностью преобразившим мое тело. Я протянул руки и судорожно схватился за то, что когда-то было моим мужским обликом. Но теперь, я был обречен на женскую судьбу. Паника охватила меня. Как я могу вернуться в свой прежний облик? Как объяснить всем своим близким и окружающим, что я стал женщиной? Опустившись на колени у берега ручья, я погрузил руки в воду и попытался отыскать ответы на свои вопросы. Мое отражение в воде было совершенно новым. Молочная кожа, сияющие глаза, длинные волосы – я был женщиной. Медленно, но верно, я принял свое новое тело. Но я все еще искал ответы. Чему я научился из этой странной трансформации? Почему я был избран для такого испытания? В рассеянности моих мыслей, я услышал тихий шепот ветра, разносящегося над ручьем. \\"Внутри тебя, ты всегда был женщиной, но твои ум, сердце и душа отрицали это. Этот лес и ручей лишь открыли истинную сущность тебя и позволили тебе обрести свою истинную себя.\\" Во мне проснулась внутренняя сила и понимание. Я понял, что обладая новым обликом, я по-прежнему оставался тем же человеком внутри. Была важна не моя внешность, а то, что находится внутри меня. Теперь я осознавал свою женскую энергию и готов был встретить будущее со всей силой и решимостью. Восстанавлившись от первоначального шока, я почувствовал что-то новое – признание и принятие своего нового себя. Я решил презреть страх и предубеждения окружающих и жить так, как я по-настоящему являюсь. Так я принял облик женщины и двинулся через лес, готовый искать новые приключения и возможности, несмотря на все трудности и несогласия. Ведь теперь я знал, что истинная сила заключается не в форме или облике, а в наших самих."},{"instruction":"is there any medical handbook about spinal cord injury that wrote by using patient data?","output":"I'm not certain if there is a specific medical handbook solely based on patient data for spinal cord injuries, as it would typically require comprehensive data from a large number of patients to create such a handbook.

(Write complex and longest texts)","output":"As Chaos approached the inner Solar system, the impending doom of the apocalypse was upon us. With its elemental superpowers, Chaos unleashed a deadly combination of hurling asteroids and emitting radioactivity. The first target was Yellowstone supervolcano, where Chaos hurled massive radioactive asteroids, triggering a cataclysmic eruption that sent ash clouds encircling the globe. But Chaos was not done yet. It summoned multiple asteroids and sent them hurtling towards Earth, polluting the Solar system and causing it to fall into a semblance of a protoplanetary system. The gravity of Chaos caused the orbit of Earth to become slightly eccentric, stripping Luna of its title as Earth's moon and turning it into a new planet. It seemed that Chaos had a knack for playing games, as it spread deadly plagues across Earth, akin to the infamous Plague Inc. Chaos rapidly evolved these plagues to be more destructive and deadly for humanity. After wreaking havoc on Earth, Chaos left and ventured to the orbit of Neptune, manipulating the orbits of other dwarf planets in the process. The orbits between Uranus and Neptune became unnaturally closer. A decade later, Chaos returned to Earth, unleashing deadly stellar flares that burst gamma rays onto the planet, reminiscent of the Carrington event. Chaos continued its assault by unleashing electromagnetic pulses, causing civilizations to go dark, plunging Earth into a blackout. But Chaos wasn't satisfied yet. Mercury collided with Venus, forming a new planet named Merenus, and Earth found itself dangerously close to Jupiter, almost torn apart by the Roche limit. As a result, the orbit of Earth became eccentric, leading to extreme seasons with short, scorching summers and long, freezing winters. Luna, now detached from Earth, moved closer to the Sun, while Neptune lost its moon Triton, transforming it into a new dwarf planet. Uranus and Neptune collided, forming a new planet called Neptanus. Chaos's return to Earth brought even more devastation. It summoned and manipulated black holes, resulting in an accretion disk forming around Earth. Our planet became tidally locked to the black hole, with one side being devoured by the Pacific Ocean, which boiled endlessly. Chaos added to the chaos by unleashing thunderous sounds, shattering civilizations. Ceres and many other celestial bodies were flung out of the Solar system, while Mars became a moon of Jupiter. The moons Io and Europa were lost to Jupiter, and Saturn gained a dark spot as Luna collided with it. Saturn also lost two moons, Titan and Iapetus, with the latter becoming a new dwarf planet. Titan, on the other hand, was ejected from the Solar system, becoming a rogue planet. Merenus captured two asteroids, Twjok and Aeacous, as new moons – all summoned by Chaos, who had polluted the Solar system with its barrage of asteroids. Amidst the chaos, two new protoplanets were formed in the artificial protoplanetary disk of the Solar system. They were named Ghieor and Liyanda. Ghieor, a rocky planet, now orbited between Merenus and Jupiter, while Liyanda, a gas giant, resided between Neptanus and Phattie. The latter, often referred to as Planet Nine, was the only celestial body to survive the apocalypse relatively unscathed. The destruction of the asteroid belts resulted in the formation of a massive new region known as the Asteroid Cloud. Distances between the Sun and Phattie became littered with countless asteroids and comets, further polluting the Solar system. In its final act of destruction, Chaos returned one last time to Earth. It showered the planet with asteroids, raining down massive numbers of nuclear warheads, and used telekinesis to pull Earth into its Roche limit. Earth teetered on the edge of annihilation, nearing the point of being ripped apart. And then, Chaos disappeared, leaving behind a desolate planet. Earth fell into a fiery hellscape, transformed into a barren wasteland contaminated with trashes and forming red lakes composed of actual blood. Heavy volcanism and mass extinctions ensued, further decimating any remaining lifeforms. The atmosphere turned radioactive and foggy, with temperatures soaring to a scorching 800 Kelvin. Now resembling a brown dwarf-like planet, Earth was ejected from the Solar system, wandering into interstellar space.

However, taking the Dachshund's physical and behavioral traits into consideration, potential descendant breeds might include: 1. Miniature Longhaired Dachshund - A variation with long, flowing fur similar to that of the Afghan Hound or the Lhasa Apso. 2. Smooth-Coated Dachshund - A shorter, smooth-haired variation, potentially resembling breeds like the Boxer or the Great Dane. 3.

Miniature Longhaired Dachshund - Similar to the current Miniature Longhaired Dachshund, this variation might have an even longer and more luxurious coat. 2. Smooth-Coated Dachshund - Again, similar to the current Smooth-Coated Dachshund, this variation may have a sleeker appearance and a shorter coat. 3. Wirehaired Dachshund - Similar to the Wirehaired Dachshund we know today, this variation might have a more refined and distinguished look, potentially with a denser and more wiry coat. 4. Dapple Dachshund - A variation with a distinctive dapple pattern, like the Dachshunds that exist today, but potentially with more variations and color combinations. 5. Miniature Dachshund - Again, similar to the current Miniature Dachshund, but potentially with more variation in size, focusing on maintaining their smaller stature.

I understand that you would like to add a linear LED matrix to a LED light source in such a way that the intensity of the light source can be controlled using a potentiometer, and the LED matrix will indicate the intensity by turning on and off accordingly. To achieve this functionality, we can design a circuit that includes the LED matrix, a microcontroller, and a potentiometer. The potentiometer will be used as an input device to control the intensity of the LED light source. The microcontroller will read the potentiometer's position and adjust the intensity of the LED light source accordingly. Simultaneously, the microcontroller can activate or deactivate specific LEDs in the matrix to indicate the intensity level. In order to proceed with this project, we would need some additional information. Could you please provide the following details: 1. Dimensions and specifications of the LED matrix: This will help us understand the technical requirements and ensure compatibility with the LED light source. 2. Power requirements: It would be helpful to know the power supply voltage and current specifications for both the LED light source and the LED matrix. This will allow us to design a circuit that can handle the necessary power levels. 3. Desired intensity range: What range of intensity levels would you like to control with the potentiometer? This information will help us determine the suitable components for the circuit.

LED Matrix: Choose a linear LED matrix with the desired number of LEDs. This matrix should be able to be controlled individually for each LED. 2. Microcontroller: Select a microcontroller that can control the LED matrix. Arduino boards are commonly used for such projects due to their versatility and ease of programming. 3. Potentiometer: Use a potentiometer to control the intensity or brightness level of the LED matrix. The potentiometer will act as an analog input to the microcontroller. 4. Driver Circuit: Build a driver circuit to connect the microcontroller to the LED matrix. The specific driver circuit will depend on the type of LED matrix chosen. 5. Power Supply: Ensure you have an appropriate power supply to provide power to both the microcontroller and the LED matrix. Once you have gathered the required components, follow these steps to create the linear LED matrix: 1. Connect the potentiometer to an analog input pin on the microcontroller. 2. Connect the microcontroller to the LED matrix using the driver circuit. This will typically involve connecting the appropriate pins of the microcontroller to the corresponding control pins of the LED matrix. 3. Program the microcontroller to read the analog input value from the potentiometer. 4. Based on the potentiometer reading, calculate the brightness level for the LED matrix by dividing the input range of the potentiometer (e.g., 0-1023 for an Arduino) into the total number of LEDs on the matrix. 5. Use the calculated brightness level to turn specific LEDs on or off in the LED matrix. For example, if the calculated brightness level is 5 out of 10, turn on the first 5 LEDs on the matrix and turn off the rest. 6. Continuously update the LED matrix based on the potentiometer reading to reflect the changing intensity of the light source. 7.

Один из наиболее распространенных методов - это оценка коэффициента детерминации (R-квадрат). R-квадрат показывает, насколько хорошо модель аппроксимирует данные. Значение R-квадрат находится в диапазоне от 0 до 1, где ближе к 1 означает лучшую аппроксимацию.

Например, в области физики или науки о материалах, где данные могут быть подвержены шуму, значения R-квадрат около 0.7 или выше могут считаться приемлемыми. В других областях, таких как экономика или социология, требования к точности модели могут быть более высокими, и значения R-квадрат должны быть близкими к 0.9 или 1.

Это означает, что модель может достаточно точно предсказывать частоту на основе температуры. Однако, важно также анализировать другие показатели, такие как коэффициенты регрессии, статистическая значимость коэффициентов, предельные ошибки и доверительные интервалы.

Вместо этого Jira предоставляет API, которое вы можете использовать для доступа к комментариям и их структуре, но рендеринг дерева комментариев в виде графического представления в Jira не встроен. Однако, вы можете создать свое собственное визуальное представление дерева комментариев, используя полученные данные из Jira. Например, вы можете использовать структуры данных, такие как словари или списки, чтобы представить и связать комментарии и их вложенные комментарии, а затем отобразить их с помощью библиотек визуализации данных, таких как matplotlib, networkx или других. Примерно так вы можете начать разработку: 1. Используйте Jira API для получения комментариев и их вложенных комментариев от нужной задачи, используя \`issue.fields.comment.comments\` и \`comment.fields.comment.comments\`. 2. Создайте структуру данных, такую как словарь или список, чтобы представить связи между комментариями и их вложенными комментариями. 3. Используйте выбранную библиотеку визуализации данных для отображения дерева комментариев. Например, с помощью матричного представления, графового представления или других форматов. Обратите внимание, что реализация точного представления и рендеринга дерева комментариев в Jira зависит от ваших потребностей и предпочтений.

Однако, вы можете использовать различные подходы для определения связей между комментариями в Jira. Вариант 1: Использование текстовых маркеров Вы можете включить в текст комментариев специальные текстовые маркеры, которые будут указывать на связи между комментариями. Например, вы можете использовать уникальные идентификаторы комментариев или специфичные теги для обозначения связей. Затем вы можете использовать API Jira для извлечения комментариев и анализировать текстовые маркеры, чтобы определить связи между комментариями. Вариант 2: Использование пользовательских полей Вы можете создать пользовательские поля в Jira, которые позволят вам установить связи между комментариями. Например, вы можете создать поле \\"Ссылка на родительский комментарий\\", в котором будет указываться ID или ключ родительского комментария. Затем вы можете использовать API Jira для доступа к пользовательским полям комментариев и анализировать значения полей, чтобы определить связи между комментариями. Обратите внимание, что оба предложенных варианта требуют использования API Jira, чтобы получить комментарии и их свойства, такие как текст и пользовательские поля. Вы можете использовать официальную библиотеку Jira для Python (jira-python) или выполнять запросы к API Jira напрямую используя модуль \`requests\`."},{"instruction":"请把下面的中文翻译成日文。对不起，我之前没能表达清楚。请问根据您的设定時雨下体的尺寸一般是多少？","output":"すみません、先に言いたいことがうまく伝わりませんでした。お尋ねしたいのですが、シゲの体のサイズは一般的にどのくらいですか？"},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling hanging out when they all mention animated characters they would date, make sure Jane and Sam choose female characters as they are lesbians and make sure at least one of them choose all of the following: Star Butterfly, Amity, Korra, Luz, Molly McGee, Kipo, Anne Boonchuy, Marcy Wu, Sasha Waybright and Catra, plus more","output":"INT.

Although users don't necessarily have to pay directly, the network operates on a novel consensus mechanism called PARSEC, which determines the distribution of rewards. Here's a summary of how node operators can get paid: 1. Resource Contribution: Node operators contribute their computing resources, such as storage space and processing power, to the safe network. They are rewarded based on the amount and quality of resources they provide. The network utilizes a Proof of Resource (PoR) mechanism to ensure that these resources are genuine and reliable. 2. Network Maintenance: Node operators also play a vital role in maintaining the network's infrastructure, such as managing data storage and facilitating data transfers. Their efforts contribute to the overall stability and performance of the network. 3. Work Proofs: To receive rewards, node operators need to submit Work Proofs, which demonstrate that they have performed certain tasks or computations as requested by the network. These proofs help protect the network from malicious activities. 4. PARSEC Consensus: The PARSEC consensus algorithm determines how rewards are distributed among node operators. It considers factors like resource contribution, network participation, and consensus participation. Node operators who actively contribute, maintain the network, and engage in the consensus process have a higher chance of earning rewards. 5. Safecoin: The native cryptocurrency of the safe network is called Safecoin. As a node operator, you can earn Safecoins as rewards for your contributions and participation. Safecoins can be exchanged within the network for various services or traded on external cryptocurrency exchanges for other currencies. It's important to note that the MaidSafe safe network is still under development, and the specifics of its incentive mechanism may evolve and be further detailed as the project progresses."},{"instruction":"How do I get to the download page mentioned above without using a search engine?","output":"If you want to directly access the MaidSafe browser's download page without using a search engine, you can follow these steps: 1.
