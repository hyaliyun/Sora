Combining both inequalities, we get the interval for each k as follows: kpi-frac{5pi}{8} leq x leq kpi-frac{pi}{8}, which can be rewritten as: left[kpi-frac{5pi}{8}, kpi-frac{pi}{8}right].

Prove that  frac{a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}}{3} geq a b c + a + b + c .  When does equality hold?","output":"1. **Assuming Conditions:**    Given the problem is to prove the inequality:        frac{a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}}{3} geq a b c + a + b + c,        where (a, b,) and (c) are pairwise distinct natural numbers.    We assume without loss of generality (w.l.o.g.) that:        a < b < c.     2. **Introducing Auxiliary Variables:**    Since (a, b,) and (c) are natural numbers and (a < b < c), we can introduce auxiliary variables (x) and (y) to express (b) and (c) in terms of (a). Specifically, we let:        b = a + x + 1 quad text{and} quad c = b + y + 1 = a + x + y + 2,        where (x, y geq 0). 3. **Substituting and Expanding:**    Substituting these expressions into the original inequality, we start with the left-hand side:        frac{a^3 + (a + x + 1)^3 + (a + x + y + 2)^3}{3}.        On the right-hand side, we have:        a(a + x + 1)(a + x + y + 2) + a + (a + x + 1) + (a + x + y + 2).     4. **Simplifying the Inequality:**    Let us expand and collect terms. The expanded left-hand side is:    begin{align*}    (a^3 + (a + x + 1)^3 + (a + x + y + 2)^3) &= a^3 + (a^3 + 3a^2(x + 1) + 3a(x + 1)^2 + (x + 1)^3)     &quad + (a^3 + 3a^2(x + y + 2) + 3a(x + y + 2)^2 + (x + y + 2)^3).    end{align*}    The expanded right-hand side is:    begin{align*}    a(a + x + 1)(a + x + y + 2) + a + a + x + 1 + a + x + y + 2 &= a^3 + ax + a(x+y+2) + ax(x+y+2)    &quad + a + a + x + 1 + a + x + y + 2.    end{align*} 5. **Justifying the Inequality:**    After simplifying and comparing each term, we convert the inequality:    begin{align*}    frac{2x^3}{3} + frac{y^3}{3} + 3x^2 + ax^2 + x^2y + y^2a + y^2x + 2y^2 + 2x + 3y + 3ax + 3ay + 4xy + axy &geq 0.    end{align*}    Each term on the left-hand side is non-negative because (x, y geq 0). 6. **Equality Condition:**    The equality holds when (2x + 3y = 0). Given (x) and (y) are non-negative, the only solution is:        x = 0 quad text{and} quad y = 0.        Therefore, the equality holds when (a = b - 1) and (b = c - 1). # Conclusion: Thus, the inequality frac{a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}}{3} geq a b c + a + b + c is proven to be true, and equality occurs when (a, b,) and (c) are three consecutive natural numbers.

What is the maximum (k) such that, after removing any rook from the board, there will be at least one marked cell that is no longer under attack?","output":"To understand the problem, let's consider the constraints and the conditions given for arranging k rooks on a 10 times 10 chessboard. The goal is to determine the maximum value of k such that, after removing any rook, there is at least one cell that is no longer under attack by any rooks. Let's analyze this step-by-step. 1. **Initial Observation**:     - Each rook can attack all cells in its row and column.     - We need to place the rooks in such a way that, upon removing any rook, at least one cell it previously attacked becomes unmarked, meaning no other rook is attacking that cell. 2. **Case 1: One rook per row or column**:     - Let's first consider placing rooks such that each column has exactly one rook. Thus, all cells on the chessboard are under attack.     - If we remove any rook, the column it was in will no longer be under attack by any rooks. Hence, no row will be free of attack, and the constraint is not satisfied this way.     - Therefore, each column (or equivalently, each row) must contain exactly one rook to cover all cells. This gives us k leq 10. (As identical logic holds for rows, k leq 10). 3. **Case 2: Ensuring removal of any rook leaves unmarked cell**:     - Suppose there exists a row without any rook and a column without any rook. The cell at the intersection of this row and column will not be under attack.     - This configuration implies that there's some row-direction or column-direction without a rook.    4. **Generalizing this to find maximum k**:     - If for each rook either its row or column is unique to it (i.e., no other rook is placed in the same row or column if we place a new rook), then, upon removal of any rook, some unique column or row becomes free.     - To maintain the balance, let's consider marking rows and columns distinctively. Suppose only 8 rows and 8 columns are marked with rooks. In this setup, we can uniquely place up to 8 rooks in such a manner.     - If we attempt to mark more rows or more columns, e.g., 9 such marking would imply each row or each column uniquely housing a single rook. Extending this scenario logically, we get a max configuration of k=8+8=16 rooks satisfying the stated conditions. 5. **Conclusion**:     - From the careful analysis, ensuring after removal of any rook the constraints still hold true, the maximum number of rooks k can be determined to be up to 16. # Final Answer: boxed{16}"},{"instruction":"Given rectangle (R_1) with one side measuring (4) inches and area (32) square inches.

Consider two squares mathbf{Q} and mathbf{Q}' that overlap, sharing a common center O. Rotate square mathbf{Q} around O by an acute angle theta to align it with mathbf{Q}'. 2. The intersection of these two squares mathbf{Q} and mathbf{Q}' creates an octagon mathbf{C}, as indicated in the problem.  3. First, observe that both squares individually are symmetric with respect to a 90-degree rotation about their center O. Consequently, if we rotate both mathbf{Q} and mathbf{Q}' by 90^circ, they map to themselves. 4. Since the intersection mathbf{C} inherits the rotational symmetry of the squares, mathbf{C} must also map onto itself with a 90^circ rotation around O. This symmetry suggests that mathbf{C} is centrally symmetric and possesses properties of an equiangular octagon. 5. Let's delve further into the geometric structure:    - Consider one edge of mathbf{C}, say t_1. After a 90^circ rotation around O, this edge maps to t_2, again a tangent line to mathbf{C}, and similarly, t_3 and t_4 are the tangents derived from further 90^circ rotations of t_1.         - These four tangents t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 create a grid that aligns with the symmetry of mathbf{C}, forming a supporting square grid due to perpendicular pairs and equal distances. 6. The common intersection mathbf{C} between the rotated square mathbf{Q}' and the original square mathbf{Q} remains a convex polygon due to the rotational and symmetric properties. 7. Since each side of mathbf{C} corresponds to segments lying within orientation preserving properties of the two squares, mathbf{C} is bounded within the supporting tangents arranged at 90^circ intervals - reaffirming the structure of the octagon. 8. A precise argument involves constructing an auxiliary geometric figure by identifying the coordinates of the points C_k forming vertices of mathbf{C} and analyzing their behavior under the consecutive rotations/translations mentioned. Due to symmetry, the resulting figure preserves a combinational structure of square sub-tangents.

We use the binomial coefficient to determine the number of ways to get exactly 9, 10, 11, and 12 heads: - Ways to get exactly 9 heads: binom{12}{9} = frac{12 times 11 times 10}{3 times 2 times 1} = 220 - Ways to get exactly 10 heads: binom{12}{10} = frac{12 times 11}{2 times 1} = 66 - Ways to get exactly 11 heads: binom{12}{11} = 12 - Ways to get exactly 12 heads: binom{12}{12}= 1 Adding these, the total number of favorable outcomes is 220 + 66 + 12 + 1 = 299.

Also, R S is greater than Q T and angle R is a right angle. The angle bisector of angle R A T intersects R T at point U, and a line through U parallel to R S intersects S Q at point W. We need to prove that U W = R T. 2. **Expression for area equality:**    The areas of trapezoids are equal, providing the initial condition:    [    S_{R T Q S} = S_{R U W S} + S_{U T Q W}    ]    This can be rearranged to show:    [    (R S + T Q) cdot (T U + U R) = (R S + U W) cdot U R + (U W + T Q) cdot T U    ]    Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:    [    R S cdot T U + T Q cdot U R = U W cdot (U R + T U)    ]    Therefore, expressing U W gives:    [    U W = frac{R S cdot T U}{T R} + frac{T Q cdot U R}{T R}    ] 3. **Using Similar Triangles:**    Triangles QAT, QTR, TAR, TRS, and RAS are all similar by AA similarity (they are right-angled triangles sharing a common angle). 4. **Ratio Relations:**    From the setup, we get:    [    frac{A T}{A R} = frac{T R}{R S} = frac{T Q}{T R}    ]    Since A U is the angle bisector of angle RAT in triangle TAR, it is true that:    [    frac{U T}{U R} = frac{A T}{A R}    ] 5. **Substituting and Simplifying:**    Substituting these ratios relationships into our expression for U W:    [    U W = frac{R S}{T R} cdot U T + frac{T Q}{T R} cdot U R = frac{R S}{T R} cdot frac{T R cdot U R}{R S} + frac{T Q}{T R} cdot frac{U T cdot T R}{T Q}    ]    Simplifying this expression, we find:    [    U W = U R + U T = TR    ] 6. **Alternative Approach:**    Consider intersection points Y and Z:    Define Y as the intersection of R Q and U W, and Z as the intersection of S T and U W.    Analyze quadrilateral U T A Y: since angle U and angle A are 90^circ, it is cyclic (able to inscribe a circle).

Assume if (ak) and (bk) have the same residue modulo 101 for (0 leq a < b leq 100). Then,    [    (b-a)k equiv 0 pmod{101}    ]    which implies 101 divides ( (b-a)k ). Given (1 leq k leq 100) and (1 leq b-a leq 100), it's impossible for (101) to divide ((b-a)k). Thus, each term yields a distinct residue. 4. **Extend the sequences considering periodicity:**    We extend the sequence to include terms shifted by 101, namely:    [    mathcal{P}_k: 0, k, 2k, ldots, 100k, 100k + 101, 99k + 101, ldots, k + 101, 101    ]    Therefore, all residues modulo 202 of numbers in (mathcal{P}_k) are distinct. If two distinct numbers in (mathcal{P}_k) yield identical residues modulo 202, they must also be identical modulo 101, which they are not. 5. **Arrive at maximum number considering constraints:**    Since each airline must operate at least 201 flights (connections), given that they cover all cities,    the total number of flights required is:    [    frac{202 cdot 201}{2} = 20301    ]    It means the number of airlines must be at most:    [    leftlceil frac{20301}{201} rightrceil = 101    ] 6. **Construct the solution for 101 airlines:**    If every set associated with (k) connects any city to every other city with flights among these uniquely covering the connections modulo constraints and ensuring distinctness, we can extend the connectivity.        Since the sequences span the entire residue set modulo 202, combining up to 100 airlines handled different partitions. If excluding one connection, additional considerations ensure the entire connection attribute spans fully.

Draw the diagonal BD. This diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles. We will consider the triangle that contains point P. 1. **Labeling and Configuration**: Identify the point where parallel lines through P intersect the sides of the rectangle. Denote these intersections such that they divide the rectangle into four smaller rectangles. Enhance the rectangle segment with vertex A such that P lies on the BD diagonal. 2. **Observation and Claim**: We will show that the area of the sub-rectangle with vertex A and diagonal AP^* is at most half of the area of triangle ABD. This implies that the area of the sub-rectangle with vertex P cannot exceed 1/4 since the total area of ABCD is 1.    - The given method involves examining the sub-rectangles formed by drawing the segments through P parallel to the sides. 3. **Geometric Transformation and Analysis**: By segmenting triangle ABD into smaller sections:     [     P^*D = p, quad P^*B = q     ]    The areas of these truncated triangles can be expressed as:     [     left(frac{p}{p+q}right)^2 cdot text{Area}(ABD) + left(frac{q}{p+q}right)^2 cdot text{Area}(ABD)     ] 4. **Use AM-GM Inequality**:      [     begin{aligned}       &text{Sum of areas} geq frac{text{Area}(ABD)}{2}        &sqrt{frac{left(frac{p}{p+q}right)^2 + left(frac{q}{p+q}right)^2}{2}} geq frac{frac{p}{p+q} + frac{q}{p+q}}{2}        &sqrt{frac{(frac{p}{p+q})^2 + (frac{q}{p+q})^2}{2}} geq frac{1}{2}     end{aligned}     ]    The equality condition of the AM-GM inequality ensures that P = P^* if and only if P coincides with the midpoint of the diagonal DB.     This verification establishes that at most one sub-rectangle can have an area greater than 1/4.

By drawing lines through O parallel to the sides of the rectangle, the rectangle is divided into four congruent smaller rectangles. 2. **Placement of Point P**: If point P is chosen in any of the sub-rectangles that contain vertices A or C, the statement is evidently true. Since any sub-rectangle cannot exceed frac{1}{4} of the total area, the conclusion follows. 3. **Symmetry Argument**: Consider the reflection of point P over point O, denoted as P'. The configuration now has a central smaller rectangle, denoted with a diagonal PP', which cuts ABCD in a specific pattern reflecting P. 4. **Combining Areas**: The total area computation of these sub-rectangles involving vertices A and C will overlap measures symmetrical to P.

Consider the orthocentric tetrahedron (ABCD) and the edges (AB) and (CD). Since these edges are perpendicular to each other, it is possible to place a unique plane through each that is perpendicular to the other edge. Let (T_1) represent the intersection of this plane with (CD), and (T_2) represent the intersection with (AB). Consequently, the line segment (T_1T_2) lies within both planes, making it their line of intersection. 2. Each line in the plane (ABT_1), including (T_1T_2), is perpendicular to (CD). Similarly, each line in the plane (CDT_2), including (T_1T_2), is perpendicular to (AB). Hence, (T_1T_2) is perpendicular to both (AB) and (CD), making it the normal transversal. The points (T_1) and (T_2) correspond to the foot of the altitudes from vertices (A) and (B) to edge (CD) and from vertices (C) and (D) to edge (AB), respectively. 3. The above statement holds for any pair of opposite edges due to the lack of any distinguishing property between the edges in an orthocentric tetrahedron. Thus, the proof generalizes for all opposite pairs of edges. 4. To address the first assertion of the problem for a single pair of opposite edges, consider the height (AM_1) from vertex (A) to the opposite face (BCD). Since (AM_1) is perpendicular to the plane (BCD), and consequently to (CD), it belongs to the plane (ABT_1). Similarly, the height (BM_2) from vertex (B) intersects (ABT_1). Therefore, the common intersection point (M) of heights (AM_1) and (BM_2) lies on (T_1T_2). 5. By symmetry, the common intersection (M) also lies on the plane (CDT_2), as it results from the heights drawn from vertices (C) and (D). Consequently, the intersection point of (T_1T_2) with the heights of faces (ACD) and (BCD) confirms that (M) is the orthocenter of tetrahedron (ABCD). Thus, the line (T_1T_2) indeed passes through (M). 6. To validate further, the projections of the normal transversals onto the planes of the faces of the tetrahedron will lie on the altitudes of the respective faces. This proves both assertions: - The normal transversals of the opposite edges pass through the tetrahedron's orthocenter. - The points of intersection of these transversals with the edges are the feet of the altitudes of the respective faces at the tetrahedron's edges. # Conclusion: blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Levi has 5 lemons.

Jayden has one-third as many lemons as Eli, so J = E/3. 3. Eli has one-half as many lemons as Ian, so E = I/2. We also know that the total number of lemons they have is 115, so we can write the equation: Levi's lemons + Jayden's lemons + Eli's lemons + Ian's lemons = 115 5 + J + E + I = 115 Now, let's substitute J and E with the expressions in terms of I: 5 + (I/2)/3 + I/2 + I = 115 5 + I/6 + I/2 + I = 115 To solve for I, we need to combine the terms with I: 5 + (1/6)I + (3/6)I + (6/6)I = 115 5 + (10/6)I = 115 Now, subtract 5 from both sides: (10/6)I = 110 Multiply both sides by 6/10 to solve for I: I = (110 * 6) / 10 I = 660 / 10 I = 66 Now that we have the number of lemons Ian has, we can find the number of lemons Eli has: E = I/2 E = 66/2 E = 33 And now we can find the number of lemons Jayden has: J = E/3 J = 33/3 J = 11 Now we know Jayden has 11 lemons.

Replace the number ( k ) on the board with a positive divisor of ( k ) different from 1 and ( k ), gaining 1 point.      2. Replace the number ( k ) on the board with ( k+1 ), losing 1 point.    - The game ends when a player has zero points, and that player loses. 2. **Analyzing Small Numbers:**    - If ( n = 2 ), Ada can only move to ( 3 ) (since 1 is not allowed), losing 1 point. Charles then moves to ( 4 ), gaining 1 point. This cycle continues, and Ada will eventually lose all her points first.    - If ( n = 3 ), Ada can move to ( 4 ) (losing 1 point) or to ( 2 ) (gaining 1 point). If Ada moves to ( 4 ), Charles can move to ( 5 ) (losing 1 point), and the cycle continues. If Ada moves to ( 2 ), Charles can move to ( 3 ), and the cycle continues. 3. **General Strategy:**    - Numbers like ( 2, 4, 8 ) are winning positions for the first player because they can force the second player into a losing cycle.    - Numbers like ( 3, 5 ) are losing positions for the first player because they force the first player into a cycle where they lose points faster. 4. **Prime Numbers:**    - For prime numbers ( p ), if ( p ) is a winning position, then ( 2p ) is a losing position. This is because if ( p ) is winning, then ( 2p + 1 ) is divisible by 3, making it a winning position.    - The primes ( 7 ) and ( 13 ) are special cases where the first player can force a win by moving to ( 8 ) or ( 14 ), respectively. 5. **Composite Numbers:**    - Composite numbers that are not of the form ( 26, 14, 8, 49, 169, 91 ) are generally winning positions for the first player because they can force the second player into a losing cycle. 6. **Conclusion:**    - Charles has a winning strategy for all primes except ( 2, 7, 13 ) and for the numbers ( 8, 14, 26, 49, 91, 169 ).

Solving for a, we get two possible scenarios: - a < -2   or - a > 7 Thus, the range of values for the real number a is (-infty, -2) cup (7, +infty). We can summarize this result as boxed{a in (-infty, -2) cup (7, +infty)}. 2. If q is a sufficient but not necessary condition for p, then the interval for B must be contained entirely within the interval for A. From the inequality a-4 leq 2 and 3 leq a+4, we find the range of a to be: - a geq 1   and - a leq 6 Therefore, the range of values for the real number a is [1, 6]. We can express this result concisely as boxed{a in [1, 6]}."},{"instruction":"The locus of the complex number ( z ) satisfying ( 2|z2+mathrm{i}| + 2|z+3mathrm{i}| = 12 ) is: A. Circle B. Ellipse C.

Next, we check if the diagonals of this rectangle are perpendicular to each other: E F = sqrt{2} cdot O_1 F = 2 sqrt{2} neq 3 sqrt{2} = sqrt{2} cdot O_2 F = F G  Thus, (E F G H) is not a square, implying that its diagonals are not perpendicular. This contradicts the \\"if and only if\\" statement for the given quadrilateral (O_1 O_2 O_3 O_4).  Second Part: To refute the other part, consider the following example: 1. Let (O_1 O_2 O_3 O_4) be a rhombus with each side length (sqrt{frac{2}{3}} + sqrt{2}) units, and an acute angle of (60^circ). 2. Draw circles centered at (O_1) and (O_3) with radius (sqrt{2}) units and centered at (O_2) and (O_4) with radius (sqrt{frac{2}{3}}) units. 3. Let these circles touch at points (E, F, G,) and (H). Refer to the figure below: ![Figure 2](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_44e69776373fc76132e5g-1.jpg?height=534&width=718&top_left_y=1218&top_left_x=690) - The rhombus (O_1 O_2 O_3 O_4) is not a cyclic quadrilateral since the sum of its opposite angles is (120^circ) and (240^circ), respectively. - However, (E F G H) is a square since each angle of quadrilateral (E F G H) is (90^circ). In detail: angle H E F = 180^circ - left(angle H E O_1 + angle F E O_2right) = 180^circ - left(frac{180^circ - 60^circ}{2} + frac{180^circ - 120^circ}{2}right) = 90^circ  Also, H E = O_1 H = sqrt{2} = 2 cdot sqrt{frac{2}{3}} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2 E O_2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = E F  Thus, the statement's assumption does not hold. # Conclusion The problem statement is incorrectly posed. The result, however, reminds us of a valid geometric fact: A tangential quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral if and only if the segments connecting opposite tangency points are perpendicular. For the given problem, the specific quadrilateral (O_1 O_2 O_3 O_4), though tangential, does not generally have its inscribed circle's tangency points coinciding with the specified points of the problem. Therefore, both parts of the statement are shown to be incorrect.

Verification of these functions is generally left as an exercise, showing they indeed satisfy the original functional equation.  Part II: Substitution To find general solutions, consider the function ( g(x) = f(x) - 1 ). This function ( g(x) ) inherits the non-decreasing property of ( f ). The given functional equation becomes: [ f(f(x)) + f(y) = f(x + f(y)) + 1. ] Substitute ( f(x) = g(x) + 1 ): [ g(g(x) + 1) + 1 + g(y) + 1 = g(x + g(y) + 1) + 1 + 1, ] which simplifies to: [ g(g(x) + 1) + g(y) + 2 = g(x + g(y) + 1) + 2. ] Thus it reduces to: [ g(g(x) + 1) + g(y) = g(x + g(y) + 1). ]  Lemma: Properties of ( g ) To understand ( g ) better, we analyze further: 1. **At ( x = 0 )**:    By substituting ( x = 0 ):    [    g(g(0) + 1) + g(y) = g(0 + g(y) + 1),    ]    resulting in:    [    g(g(0) + 1) + g(y) = g(g(y) + 1).    ]    For this to hold for all ( y ), setting ( y = 0 ) further simplifies to:    [    g(g(0) + 1) + g(0) = g(g(0) + 1).    ]    This necessitates ( g(0) = 0 ). 2. **Proceeding with ( g(0) = 0 )**:    [    begin{aligned}    P(x, 0): quad & g(g(x) + 1) = g(x + 1),     P(0, y): quad & g(1) + g(y) = g(g(y) + 1).    end{aligned}    ]    Thus, combining, we have:    [ g(x + 1) = g(x) + g(1). ]        This shows ( g ) is additive with a linear step ( g(1) ).  Part III: Analysis of ( g ) If ( g(1) = 0 ), then for all integers ( n ), ( g(n) = n cdot g(1) = 0 ), implying ( g(x) = 0 ). Suppose ( g(1) > 0 ): **Claim: If ( g ) is not the identity, then ( g(1) = 1 )** Let ( g(1) = c ). Then: [ g(n) = cn text{ for all positive integers } n, ] [ g(c n) = c n text{ and } g(c(n pm 1)) = c(n pm 1). ] Since ( c(n pm 1) ) must stay consistent across the functional domain, ( c=1 ).

Before delivering the box to customers, the fruits must be inspected according to a set standard. If any unqualified fruits are found, they will be replaced with qualified ones. During the inspection, 10 fruits are randomly selected from the box for inspection, and a decision is made whether to inspect the remaining fruits based on the inspection results. Let the probability of each fruit being unqualified be p (0 < p < 1), and whether each fruit is unqualified is independent of each other. (I) Denote the probability of having exactly 2 unqualified fruits in the 10 selected fruits as f(p), find the value of p (denoted as p0) when f(p) reaches its maximum. (II) Now, after inspecting 10 fruits from a box, it was found that exactly 2 were unqualified. Using the p0 determined in (I) as the value of p. Given that the inspection cost for each fruit is 1.5 yuan, if an unqualified fruit ends up in the customer's hands, the plantation must pay a compensation fee of a yuan for each unqualified fruit (a ∈ N*). (i) If the remaining fruits in the box are not inspected, denote the sum of the inspection fee and compensation fee for this box as X, find E(X).

By solving f'(p) = 0, we get p = 0.2. When p ∈ (0, 0.2), f'(p) > 0, and when p ∈ (0.2, 1), f'(p) < 0. ∴ The maximum value point of f(p) is p0 = 0.2. (II) From (I), we know p0 = 0.2. (i) Let Y represent the number of unqualified fruits among the remaining 70 fruits. According to the problem, Y ~ B(70, 0.2), X = 10 × 1.5 + aY = 15 + aY. ∴ E(X) = E(15 + aY) = 15 + aE(Y) = 15 + a × 70 × 0.2 = 15 + 14a.

We know that each large pizza has 14 slices, so 2 large pizzas would have 2 x 14 = 28 slices. Since they need at least 36 slices in total, we can subtract the number of slices from the large pizzas from the total number of slices they need to find out how many slices the small pizza should have. 36 slices (total needed) - 28 slices (from 2 large pizzas) = 8 slices.

She bought 4/9 square yards of one type of material and 2/3 square yards of another type of material. To add these two amounts together, we need to find a common denominator.

Thus, [ begin{align*} w &= (x - 30) cdot y  &= (x - 30) cdot (-x + 60)  &= -x^2 + 60x - 30x + 1800  &= -x^2 + 90x - 1800. end{align*} ] Therefore, the analytical expression of the function between w and x is boxed{w = -x^2 + 90x - 1800}.  Part (2): Maximizing Daily Profit To find the selling price x that maximizes the daily profit w, we rewrite the expression for w as: [ begin{align*} w &= -x^2 + 90x - 1800  &= -left(x^2 - 90x + 1800right)  &= -left(x - 45right)^2 + 225. end{align*} ] Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the vertex represents the maximum point. The vertex occurs at x = 45, and the maximum value of w at this point is 225. Therefore, the selling price should be set at boxed{x = 45} yuan to maximize the daily profit, which is boxed{225} yuan.  Part (3): Setting the Selling Price with a Profit Constraint Given the constraint that the selling price must not exceed 48 yuan and the store needs to make a daily profit of 200 yuan, we set w = 200 and solve for x: [ begin{align*} -x^2 + 90x - 1800 &= 200  -x^2 + 90x - 2000 &= 0. end{align*} ] Solving this quadratic equation yields two solutions, x_1 = 40 and x_2 = 50. However, since the selling price must not exceed 48 yuan, x_2 = 50 does not meet the requirements.

Finally, on Friday it rained for half the day and she managed to pull up 10 fewer weeds than she did on Thursday. In total, she pulled up 120 weeds. What is the ratio of the number of weeds she pulled on Thursday to the number of weeds she pulled on Wednesday?","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. On Tuesday, Sarah pulled 25 weeds. 2. On Wednesday, she pulled three times the number of weeds she did on Tuesday, so that's 3 * 25 = 75 weeds. 3. On Thursday, she pulled a certain fraction of the weeds she pulled on Wednesday. We don't know this fraction yet, so let's call it \\"x\\". So, the number of weeds she pulled on Thursday is x * 75. 4. On Friday, it rained for half the day, and she managed to pull up 10 fewer weeds than she did on Thursday. So, the number of weeds she pulled on Friday is (x * 75) - 10. 5. In total, she pulled up 120 weeds over the four days. Now, let's write an equation to represent the total number of weeds she pulled: 25 (Tuesday) + 75 (Wednesday) + x * 75 (Thursday) + ((x * 75) - 10) (Friday) = 120 Simplifying the equation: 25 + 75 + 75x + 75x - 10 = 120 100 + 150x - 10 = 120 150x + 90 = 120 150x = 120 - 90 150x = 30 x = 30 / 150 x = 1 / 5 So, the fraction of weeds Sarah pulled on Thursday compared to Wednesday is 1/5. This means on Thursday, she pulled 1/5 of the weeds she pulled on Wednesday, which is 1/5 * 75 = 15 weeds. Now, we need to find the ratio of the number of weeds she pulled on Thursday to the number of weeds she pulled on Wednesday: Number of weeds on Thursday / Number of weeds on Wednesday = 15 / 75 = 1 / 5 Therefore, the ratio of the number of weeds Sarah pulled on Thursday to the number of weeds she pulled on Wednesday is boxed{1:5} ."},{"instruction":"What is the degree of the polynomial ((7sin x  3x^5 + 15 + 2log(x) x^2 + e^x x^6  sqrt{5}))?","output":"Like the original problem, this polynomial includes multiple terms with variables raised to different powers, and additional new terms involving trigonometric and logarithmic functions.

Prove that among the regions into which they divide the plane, there are at least n regions bounded solely by red lines.","output":"1. **Base Case (For Induction):** Verify initial condition for small values of ( n ).        Let's start with ( n = 1 ):        - We have ( 2n = 2 ) red lines and ( n = 1 ) blue line.        - The 2 red lines intersect forming a total number of regions on the plane given by:      [      2(1)^2 + 1 + 1 = 4       ]      regions.    - When we introduce the blue line, it intersects both red lines. Each of these intersections creates additional regions such that the blue line can affect up to ( 2n + 1 = 3 ) regions. This reduces the purely red-enclosed regions by at most 3:      [      4 - 3 = 1       ]      pure red region remains, which is at least ( n = 1 ).          Thus, our base case holds as there is at least 1 region bounded purely by red lines. 2. **Inductive Step:**        Assume the statement is true for ( n ); that is, for ( 2n ) red lines and ( n ) blue lines, there are at least ( n ) regions bounded purely by red lines. 3. **Add One More Blue Line (from ( n ) to ( n+1 )):**        - Initially, ( 2n ) red lines divide the plane into:      [      2n^2 + n + 1       ]      regions.        - Each existing blue line can spoil and split up:      [      2n + 1       ]      purely red regions.        - Once we have one blue line, it affects and ensures ( 2n^2 + n + 1 ) minus the regions le 2n + 1 gives:      [      2n^2 + n + 1 - (2n + 1) = 2n^2 - n       ]      regions left potentially bound only by red lines.     4. **Each Additional Blue Line:**        - Let's add another blue line. Each new blue line intersects all red lines and adds intersections which, worst case, spoils up to 2n regions each time, interacting with previous setups.        - After ( n ) blue lines, the potentially impacted regions after initial spoilage is:      [      (2n^2 - n) - 2n(n-1) = 2n^2 - n - 2n^2 + 2n = n       ]      regions are unspoiled and bound purely by red lines. 5. **Conclusion**:        We have shown by induction and direct calculation, confirming that despite additional blue lines, there will remain:    [    boxed{n}    ]    regions bounded purely by red lines even after intersecting initially clear bounds of blue lines.

To find the maximum value of f(x), we evaluate it at x = -1:  begin{align*} f(-1) &= (-1)^3 - 3(-1)         &= -1 + 3         &= 2. end{align*}  Thus, the maximum value of f(x) is boxed{2} at x = -1."},{"instruction":"The sequences ({a_n}) and ({b_n}) satisfy: [ begin{array}{l} a_1 = 1, , b_1 = 2,  a_{n+1} = frac{1 + a_n + a_n b_n}{b_n}, , b_{n+1} = frac{1 + b_n + a_n b_n}{a_n}. end{array} ] Compare (a_{2019}) with 5, and prove your conclusion.","output":"To compare (a_{2019}) with 5, we analyze the sequence {a_n} and {b_n} given by: [ a_{1}=1, b_{1}=2,  ] [ a_{n+1}=frac{1+a_{n}+a_{n} b_{n}}{b_{n}}, quad b_{n+1}=frac{1+b_{n}+a_{n} b_{n}}{a_{n}}. ] 1.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Consider the factorials**:    Let's examine the values of the factorials involved:    - p!: This is the product of all integers from 1 to p.    - (p!)^n: This represents the factorial p! raised to the power n.    - p^2!: This is the factorial of p^2, i.e., the product of all integers from 1 to p^2. 2. **Factorial Expansion**:     Expand the factorial expressions:     [     p! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots p     ]     [     p^2! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots p^2     ]     We need to show:     [     left( p^2 right)! text{ is divisible by } (p!)^{p+1}     ] 3. **Using the concept of permutations**:     Consider arranging p^2 distinct elements. We can arrange these elements into a p times p table. There are p! ways to arrange p elements, and we need to do this p times for each row, making it  (p!)^p  ways. However, since there are p rows in each column, and these can be permuted as well, the total number of distinct arrangements (including swapping rows within blocks) results in:     [     (p!)^{p+1}     ]     This indicates that essentially, in a block matrix, we can shuffle columns and rows within each mini-block. 4. **Key Insight**:     An important property of factorials is involved in the prime factorization. Each q leq p must appear in any arrangement involving (p!)^{p+1}. 5. **Counting the prime factors**:     Let's count the occurrences of any prime q in the factorization of (p!)^{p+1}:     [     v_qleft((p!)^{p+1}right) = (p+1) sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{p}{q^k} rightrfloor     ]     Similarly, for p^2!, we have:     [     v_q(p^2!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{p^2}{q^k} rightrfloor     ]     Using the inequality:     [     sum_{k=1}^{n} leftlfloor frac{x}{y^k} rightrfloor leq frac{x}{y - 1}     ]     Since p factors into smaller integers far more frequently within the factorial array of p^2, we conclude:     [     (p+1) sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{p}{q^i} rightrfloor leq sum_{j=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{p^2}{q^j} rightrfloor     ]     Essentially highlighting that the total prime decomposition within (p^2)! will provide a sufficiently large divisor set to encompass (p!)^{p+1}. 6. **Conclusion**:     We reach the conclusion that n leqslant p+1 because p^2! ensures that it can cover the decompositions provided by (p!)^{p+1}.

Let ( I ) be the center of the inscribed circle.     2. Since ( I ) is the point of intersection of the angle bisectors of the internal angles of the trapezoid, ( angle IAD + angle IDA = ( angle DAB + angle ADC ) / 2 = 180^circ / 2 = 90^circ ) due to the parallel lines (AB) and (CD).

Let Y denote the number of times player A shoots in the first n shots, find E(Y).","output":"# Solution:  Part (1): Probability that player B takes the second shot Given that player A has a shooting accuracy of 0.6 and player B has a shooting accuracy of 0.8, the probability that player B takes the second shot can be calculated as follows: - Player A misses their first shot and player B gets to shoot: 0.5 times (1 - 0.6) = 0.5 times 0.4 - Player B starts and makes their first shot: 0.5 times 0.8 Therefore, the probability P that player B takes the second shot is: [P = 0.5 times 0.4 + 0.5 times 0.8 = 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6] So, the probability that player B takes the second shot is boxed{0.6}.  Part (2): Probability that player A takes the i-th shot Let P_{n} denote the probability that player A takes the n-th shot.

Thus: [P_{n} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1}] Solving for P_{n} gives us: [P_{n} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1}] Therefore, the probability that player A takes the i-th shot is boxed{P_{i} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1}}.  Part (3): Expected number of times player A shoots in the first n shots From part (2), we know that P_{i} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1}. To find E(Y), the expected number of times player A shoots in the first n shots, we sum up the probabilities for i from 1 to n: [E(Y) = sum_{i=1}^{n} P_{i} = frac{1}{6}sum_{i=1}^{n} left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1} + frac{n}{3}] Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we get: [E(Y) = frac{frac{1}{6}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}]}{1 - frac{2}{5}} + frac{n}{3} = frac{5}{18}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}] + frac{n}{3}] Therefore, the expected number of times player A shoots in the first n shots is boxed{E(Y) = frac{5}{18}[1 - (frac{2}{5})^{n}] + frac{n}{3}}, for n in mathbb{N}^{*}."},{"instruction":"Solve for P if sqrt{P^3} = 81sqrt[3]{81}.","output":"1.

Angle (angle NOK) is a right angle since ( NO ) is parallel to ( BC ) and ( OK ) is perpendicular to ( BC ). 7. Next, we examine points ( E ). The tangents to the circle at points ( A ) and ( C ) meet at ( E ). By properties of circle tangents from a point, ( EA = EC ). 8. Triangle ( AEC ) is isosceles, with ( EA = EC ) and therefore its perpendicular bisector ( EO ) bisects ( angle AEC ). 9. Combining these facts:    - ( E ), ( N ), and ( O ) lie on a straight line because ( EN ) is half the length of ( EO ) (since they're medians in the isosceles triangle ( triangle EAC )). 10. Applying the theorem of intersecting chords in a circle:     [     AN cdot NC = EN cdot NO     ] 11. Applying the same theorem considering segments ( AC ) and ( MK ):     [     AN cdot NC = MN cdot NK     ] 12. By combining these two results:     [     MN cdot NK = EN cdot NO     ] 13. By the converse of the theorem on intersecting chords, points ( M ), ( K ), ( E ), and ( O ) lie on one circle. 14. Thus, the angles ( angle EMK ) and ( angle EOK ) are subtended by the same arc which means they are equal. Since ( angle EOK ) is right, ( angle EMK ) is also right. Hence, (boxed{angle EMK=90^circ})."},{"instruction":"Let M be the greatest integer multiple of 9, no two of whose digits are the same.

To have a common denominator of 20, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4, resulting in frac{3 times 4}{5 times 4} = frac{12}{20}. - For -frac{3}{4}, its absolute value is |frac{3}{4}| = frac{3}{4}. To adjust it to the same denominator of 20, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5, leading to frac{3 times 5}{4 times 5} = frac{15}{20}. Now, comparing frac{12}{20} and frac{15}{20}, we see that frac{12}{20} < frac{15}{20}.

Let ( angle AKO = angle AOK = alpha ). Since (K) divides (AK) and (AO) equally, we have: [ AK = AO implies angle AKO = angle AOK = alpha ] 2. Similarly, because (KM parallel AC), angles alternate: [ angle MKC = angle MCA ] And let: [ angle KMC = beta implies angle MCK = beta ] Since (KM parallel AC), we have: [ angle KCM = angle MAC = beta ] 3.

Since (triangle KSC sim triangle MOC) and (K) divides (AK = AO) and (KM = MC) into corresponding proportional segments, the third pair of angles must also be equal because of the consistency in angle pairings.

The area of the bottom surface can be found by integrating this function over the given rectangular region. The side surfaces are the vertical walls of the cistern that are in contact with the water.

So we can write the equation: K + 2K + (3/4)K + 6K = 216 Combining like terms, we get: 9.75K = 216 Now, we solve for K: K = 216 / 9.75 K = 22.15 (approximately) Now we can find the hours charged by each person: - Kate: K = 22.15 hours - Pat: 2K = 2 * 22.15 = 44.31 hours (approximately) - Alice: (3/4)K = (3/4) * 22.15 = 16.61 hours (approximately) - Mark: 6K = 6 * 22.15 = 132.9 hours (approximately) To find out how many more hours Mark charged to the project than the combined hours of Kate and Alice, we subtract the sum of Kate's and Alice's hours from Mark's hours: Mark - (Kate + Alice) = 132.9 - (22.15 + 16.61) Mark - (Kate + Alice) = 132.9 - 38.76 Mark - (Kate + Alice) = 94.14 hours (approximately) Mark charged approximately boxed{94.14}  more hours to the project than the combined hours of Kate and Alice."},{"instruction":"Find the equation of the line that passes through point A(2,3) and where the intercept on the xaxis is twice the intercept on the yaxis.","output":"Solution: (1) When the intercepts on both the x-axis and y-axis are zero, let the equation of the line be y=kx.

Part (1):  If xin A is a sufficient but not necessary condition for xin B, find the range of real number a. **Solution:** First, we solve the inequality for A and B: - For A, we have (x-a)(x-a+1)leqslant 0, which implies the roots of the inequality are x=a and x=a-1. By analyzing the sign, we find that A={x,|,a-1leqslant xleqslant a}. - For B, we have x^{2}+x-2 < 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we find the roots are x=-2 and x=1. Thus, B={x,|,-2 < x < 1}. Given that xin A is a sufficient but not necessary condition for xin B, we derive the conditions for a: 1. The smallest element in A must be greater than the smallest element in B, which gives a-1 > -2 implies a > -1. 2. The largest element in A must be less than the largest element in B, which gives a < 1. Combining these conditions, we find that ain (-1,1). Thus, the range of real number a is boxed{(-1,1)}.  Part (2):  Let proposition p:exists xin B, x^{2}+(2m+1)x+m^{2}-m > 8.

Since you've mentioned that the mass percentage is 37.21%, I will assume that you are referring to the mass percentage of bromine in HBrO3, as it is the heaviest element in the compound and likely to have a significant mass percentage. First, let's calculate the molar mass of HBrO3: - Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.01 g/mol. - Bromine (Br) has an atomic mass of approximately 79.90 g/mol. - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.00 g/mol, and there are three oxygen atoms in HBrO3. Molar mass of HBrO3 = (1.01 g/mol) + (79.90 g/mol) + 3 * (16.00 g/mol) Molar mass of HBrO3 = 1.01 g/mol + 79.90 g/mol + 48.00 g/mol Molar mass of HBrO3 = 128.91 g/mol Now, let's find the mass percentage of bromine in HBrO3: Mass percentage of Br = (mass of Br in the compound / molar mass of the compound) * 100% Mass percentage of Br = (79.90 g/mol / 128.91 g/mol) * 100% Mass percentage of Br = 0.6199 * 100% Mass percentage of Br = 61.99% However, you've mentioned that the mass percentage is boxed{37.21%,}  which does not match the calculated mass percentage of bromine in HBrO3.

There will be frac{22 times 22}{2 times 2} = 121 such blocks. 3. **Analyzing distribution in each 2 times 2 block:**      We need to figure out the distribution of the remainders in such a way that the sum of any two adjacent cells (either by side or vertex) does not divide evenly by 4.      - Each block contains numbers 0, 1, 2, 3.    - If we assume each 2 times 2 block can have at most one zero and one two, then the rest must be filled with ones and threes.      4. **Analyzing numbers within each block:**      Since the number of blocks (121) is equal to the number of zeros and twos, each block must contain exactly one zero and one two. 5. **Rechecking adjacent sum properties:**      Let's reconsider sums within each 2 times 2 block: the remaining two numbers in each block would have to be ones or threes. If they were both ones or both threes, then two adjacent cells in some block would sum up as:    - 1 + 1 = 2, not divisible by 4.    - 3 + 3 = 6, not divisible by 4.        However, by breaking blocks as we claimed, we are ensuring that the total number of ones is even. 6. **Checking contradiction with units count:**      Yet, the total number of ones calculated earlier is actually 121, which is an odd count. This leads to a mathematical contradiction since the count should be even if every block had such a structure. Conclusion: This contradiction suggests that our initial assumption is incorrect. Therefore, Oleg can indeed choose two adjacent cells (by side or vertex) such that the sum of the numbers in those cells is divisible by 4. boxed{text{True}}"},{"instruction":"Real numbers a and b have an arithmetic mean of 20 and a geometric mean of sqrt{110}.

Denote by (P) the point of intersection of the perpendiculars to the lines (a) and (b), drawn from (A) and (B) respectively. Find the locus of points (P). 1. **Identify Key Angles and Orientations**:    Since the lines (a) and (b) intersect at point (O), and (A) lies on (a) while (B) lies on (b), we can consider the triangle (AOB). 2. **Geometry of (P)**:    The angles (angle PAO) and (angle PBO) are right angles because (P) is the intersection of the perpendiculars from (A) and (B) to lines (a) and (b) respectively. Hence, the points (A), (B), (O), and (P) lie on a circle where (OR) is the diameter of this circle. 3. **Applying Circle Properties**:    By the properties of a circle, specifically the intercept theorem or the inscribed angle theorem, the triangle (AOB) being inscribed such that (AB) subtends the diameter (overline{PO}), and because (angle PAO = 90^circ) and (angle PBO = 90^circ), we immediately know that (OR) spans across a circle. 4. **Radius Calculation Using the Law of Sines**:    According to the Law of Sines in triangle (AOB), we know:    [    frac{AB}{sin theta} = 2R quad Rightarrow quad frac{l}{sin x} = 2R,    ]    where (x) is the angle between lines (a) and (b), and therefore:    [    R = frac{l}{2 sin x}.    ] 5. **Summarizing the Locus**:    Thus, the point (R) must lie on a circle with radius (R = frac{l}{2 sin x}) because (OR) is essentially the radius that defines the geometrical constraints we have:    [    OR = frac{l}{sin x}.    ] 6. **Special Case Discussion**:    The only special case that needs to be mentioned is when the lines (a) and (b) are perpendicular.

Therefore, we set up the inequality: [ x^{4} - 625 < 700 ] Adding 625 to both sides to isolate the x^{4} term, we get: [ x^{4} < 1325 ] To find the values of x that satisfy this inequality, we take the fourth root of both sides: [ x < sqrt[4]{1325} ] We know that sqrt[4]{1325} is a number between 6 and 7 because 6^4 = 1296 and 7^4 = 2401. This means that x can be any positive integer less than 7. Therefore, the possible values of x are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. However, we must also consider that the width of the box is given by x-5 units, which must be a positive number for the box to have a physical form. This condition implies that x > 5.

So, the relative speed of the two trains is: 60 km/h - 40 km/h = 20 km/h To convert this speed into meters per second, we use the conversion factor 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s: 20 km/h * (5/18) = (20 * 5) / 18 = 100 / 18 ≈ 5.56 m/s Now, let's denote the length of each train as L meters. Since the trains are of equal length, when they cross each other, they cover a distance of 2L meters (the sum of their lengths). The time taken to cross each other while running in the same direction is given as 50 seconds. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed 50 seconds = 2L / 5.56 m/s Now we can solve for L: 2L = 50 * 5.56 2L = 278 L = 278 / 2 L = 139 meters So, each train is 139 meters long. When the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds: 60 km/h + 40 km/h = 100 km/h Converting this speed into meters per second: 100 km/h * (5/18) = (100 * 5) / 18 ≈ 27.78 m/s Now, we can calculate the time taken to cross each other when running in opposite directions using the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed Since the total distance to be covered is still 2L (the sum of their lengths), we have: Time = 2L / 27.78 m/s Time = 2 * 139 / 27.78 Time ≈ 278 / 27.78 Time ≈ 10 seconds Therefore, the two trains will take approximately boxed{10}  seconds to cross each other when running in opposite directions."},{"instruction":"ertain number of workers can do a work in 45 days . if there were 10 workers more it could be finished in 10 days less . how many workers are there ?","output":"Let's denote the original number of workers as W and the amount of work as A.

We can use the SI formula to express R in terms of P: SI = (P * R * 2) / 100 10200 = (P * R * 2) / 100 R = (10200 * 100) / (P * 2) Now, let's substitute this value of R into the equation we derived from CI - SI: P * ((10200 * 100) / (P * 2) / 100)^2 = Rs. 1530 P * (10200 / P)^2 = 1530 * 4 P^2 * (10200^2) / P^2 = 1530 * 4 10200^2 = 1530 * 4 * P P = 10200^2 / (1530 * 4) Now, let's calculate the value of P: P = 10200^2 / (1530 * 4) P = 104040000 / 6120 P = 17000 Therefore, the principal sum (P) is Rs. boxed{17000} ."},{"instruction":"1Let  A  and  B  be two diametrically opposite points on a circle with radius  1 .

Applying the change of base formula and exponent rules:    [    2 cdot left( frac{log cos x}{log 3} - frac{log sin x}{log 3} right) = frac{log cos x}{log 2}    ]        Now, we rewrite the equation using natural logarithms:    [    log 2 cdot left( 2 left( frac{log cos x}{log 3} - frac{log sin x}{log 3} right) right) = log cos x    ]      4. **Simplification and Analysis:**    Simplifying the logarithmic coefficients:    [    2 frac{log cos x}{log 3} - 2 frac{log sin x}{log 3} = log_{2} cos x    ]    This can be simplified further:    [    frac{2}{log 3} (log cos x - log sin x) = frac{log cos x}{log 2}    ]    Simplifying the terms:    [    frac{2}{log 3} log left( frac{cos x}{sin x} right) = frac{log cos x}{log 2}    ] 5. **Conclusion:**    Given that (cos x) and (sin x) are trigonometric functions with known behavior within specific intervals, and observing the function properties (logarithms, cosines, and sines), the only solutions must conform to the form:    [    x = frac{pi}{3} + 2 pi k, quad k in mathbb{Z}    ] Since we have shown that no other solutions exist within the defined domains by showing function decrement and increment behaviors, we can conclude: [ boxed{x = frac{pi}{3} + 2 pi k, quad k in mathbb{Z}} ]"},{"instruction":"The function f(x)=3sin (2x frac {pi }{3}) has a graph denoted as C.

Then, ( f(6) = f(2 cdot 3) = f(2)f(3) = 2k ). 5. **Bounding ( f(5) ):**    Since ( f ) is strictly increasing, ( f(4) ) must be between ( f(3) ) and ( f(5) ). Therefore, ( k + 2 leq f(5) leq 2k - 1 ). 6. **Bounding ( f(10) ):**    Using the multiplicative property, ( f(10) = f(2 cdot 5) = f(2)f(5) = 2f(5) ). Since ( f(5) leq 2k - 1 ), we have ( f(10) leq 4k - 2 ). 7. **Bounding ( f(9) ):**    Similarly, ( f(9) = f(3^2) = f(3)^2 = k^2 ).

After the first discount of 20%, the price becomes: P1 = P - (20/100) * P P1 = 0.8 * P After the second discount of 10%, the price becomes: P2 = P1 - (10/100) * P1 P2 = 0.9 * P1 P2 = 0.9 * (0.8 * P) After the third discount of D%, the final price becomes: F = P2 - (D/100) * P2 F = (1 - D/100) * P2 F = (1 - D/100) * (0.9 * (0.8 * P)) We know the final price F is Rs. 6400, so we can set up the equation: 6400 = (1 - D/100) * (0.9 * (0.8 * P)) Now we can plug in the value of P and solve for D: 6400 = (1 - D/100) * (0.9 * (0.8 * 9356.725146198829)) First, calculate the value inside the parentheses: 0.9 * (0.8 * 9356.725146198829) = 0.9 * 7485.380116959063 = 6736.842105263157 Now we have: 6400 = (1 - D/100) * 6736.842105263157 Divide both sides by 6736.842105263157 to isolate (1 - D/100): 6400 / 6736.842105263157 = 1 - D/100 0.9500000000000001 = 1 - D/100 Subtract 1 from both sides to solve for D/100: -0.0499999999999999 = -D/100 Multiply both sides by -100 to solve for D: D = 0.0499999999999999 * -100 D = -4.99999999999999 Since a discount cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of D: D = 4.99999999999999 Rounding to two decimal places, the third discount percentage is approximately: D ≈ 5.00% So, the third discount percentage is approximately boxed{5%} ."},{"instruction":"On an island, there are two tribes: knights, who always tell the truth, and liars, who always lie.

Let's test different scenarios to determine who is a knight and who is a liar: 4. **Assume A is a Knight**:     - If A is a knight (truth-teller), then his statement must be true. Therefore, his tribesman (also a knight) stands 1 meter away from him, which leaves only islander B as an option.     - Thus, B must be a knight as well (since he is the one standing 1 meter away from A and A's statement is true). 5. **Validate B's Statement**:     - If B is a knight, his statement must also be true. According to his statement, his fellow tribesman (also a knight) stands 2 meters away from him. This means their fellow knight should be islander D (standing 2 meters away from B). 6. **Contradiction Check**:     - If A and B are both knights, and their statements are true, we have a contradiction: based on A’s and B's statements, C must be a knight because:         - A said his fellow knight stands 1 meter away. (Rightarrow B)         - B said his fellow knight stands 2 meters away. (Rightarrow D)     - However, this would mean there are three knights, which contradicts the problem statement that there are only two knights. 7. **Reconsider A's Status**:     - Hence, A must be lying. If A is lying (a liar), his statement is false. Therefore, his fellow tribesman (knight) does not stand 1 meter away from him. 8. **B as a Knight**:     - Since B's position is 1 meter away from A and A is a liar, B could still be a knight.     - B states his fellow knight stands 2 meters away from him. Therefore, D must be a knight (standing 2 meters away from B). 9. **Remaining Islanders**:     - If B and D are knights, A is a liar, C must also be a liar.      10. **Evaluate Possible Statements by C and D**:     - Since liars always lie, C and D's statements will be false.     Possible distances for C (a liar):     - Could not be 1 meter (since that would be truthful if referencing B or D).     - Any other distance 2 meters, 3 meters, 4 meters, or more would maintain the lie.     Possible distances for D (a knight):     - Truthful distance: 2 meters (referencing B or A or both). **Conclusion**: - **Possible statements by 3rd islander (C) (a liar)**: 1m, 3m, 4m (as any accurate less than 2 meters would be a truth, conflicting with him being a liar). - **Possible statements by 4th islander (D) (a knight)**: 2m (which is the true distance to B).

We know the total amount he got back after two years, which includes both the principal and the interest earned.  Total amount after two years = Principal + Interest earned 19828.80 = Principal + 2828.80 Now, let's find the principal: Principal = Total amount after two years - Interest earned Principal = 19828.80 - 2828.80 Principal = 17000 Now that we have the principal, we can use the formula for compound interest to find the annual interest rate. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount) r = the annual interest rate (decimal) n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for In this case, we have: A = 19828.80 P = 17000 n = 1 (since the interest is compounded annually, we'll assume n=1) t = 2 (the number of years) We need to find r, the annual interest rate. Rearranging the formula to solve for r gives us: r = (A/P)^(1/nt) - 1 Plugging in the values we have: r = (19828.80/17000)^(1/(1*2)) - 1 r = (1.1664)^(1/2) - 1 r = (1.1664)^0.5 - 1 r = 1.0800 - 1 r = 0.0800 To express r as a percentage, we multiply by 100: r = 0.0800 * 100 r = 8% Therefore, the annual interest rate is boxed{8%} ."},{"instruction":"The general term formula for the sequence frac {1}{3}, frac {1}{8}, frac {1}{15}, frac {1}{24}, ... is (　　) A: a_n = frac {1}{2^{n}+1} B: a_n = frac {1}{n+2} C: a_n = frac {1}{n(n+2)} D: a_n = frac {1}{2^{n}1}","output":"Solution: (1) Let's denote this sequence as {a_n}.

Apply the Binomial Theorem to expand both terms. Here, the Binomial Theorem states:    (a + b)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k    Thus, we get:    (x+t)^{2028} = sum_{k=0}^{2028} binom{2028}{k} x^{2028-k} t^k    (x-t)^{2028} = sum_{k=0}^{2028} binom{2028}{k} x^{2028-k} (-t)^k 4.

Each t^{2m} term can be expanded further since t = y + z:    [    t^{2m} = (y+z)^{2m} = sum_{j=0}^{2m} binom{2m}{j} y^j z^{2m-j}    ] 8.

A) 7 B) 17 C) 24 D) 119 E) 120","output":"1. **Details of the game**: Sam begins the game by taking the first chocolate and also ends up taking the last chocolate from a bowl containing 120 chocolates. 2. **Understanding the distribution**: Each student takes one chocolate before passing the bowl, and the game ends when the bowl comes back to Sam after the last chocolate is taken. 3. **Complete cycles and the final count**: For Sam to take both the first and last chocolates, the total number of chocolates minus one (i.e., 119) must be completely distributed among the students in complete cycles. Thus, the number of students must be a divisor of 119. 4. **Finding divisors of 119**: Factoring 119 gives 119 = 7 times 17. The divisors of 119 are thus 1, 7, 17, and 119. 5. **Conclusion**: The possible number of students is such that they can complete whole rounds with 119 chocolates being distributed. The divisors are 7 and 17. Therefore, the possible number of students in the game could be 7 text{ or  17}.

Let ( p = 2^{2^n} + a ) be a prime number for some ( n ). 2. **Valuation of ( p-1 )**: Notice that ( p - 1 = 2^{2^n} + a - 1 ). We need to consider the 2-adic valuation ( v_2(p-1) ). Since ( a ) is a positive integer greater than 1, ( v_2(a-1) ) is well-defined. Let ( k = v_2(a-1) ). Then ( v_2(p-1) = v_2(2^{2^n} + a - 1) = v_2(a-1) = k ). 3. **Condition on ( n )**: Choose ( n ) such that ( n > k + 1 ). This ensures that ( 2^n ) is much larger than ( k ). 4. **Expression of ( 2^{2^n} ) modulo ( p )**: Since ( p = 2^{2^n} + a ) is prime, we have ( 2^{2^n} equiv -a pmod{p} ). 5. **Properties of ( -1 ) modulo ( p )**: It is a well-known fact that ( -1 ) can be expressed as ( x^{2^m} pmod{p} ) for ( m leq v_2(p-1) - 1 ). Since ( v_2(p-1) = k ), we have ( -1 equiv x^{2^m} pmod{p} ) for ( m leq k - 1 ). 6. **Expression of ( a ) modulo ( p )**: Since ( a = -2^{2^n} pmod{p} ), we can write ( a equiv x^{2^m} pmod{p} ) for ( m leq k - 1 ). This implies ( a^{text{odd}} equiv -1 pmod{p} ) for some odd exponent. 7. **Choosing the odd exponent**: We can choose the odd exponent to be of the form ( 2^x - 1 ) for ( x > 1 ). Thus, we have ( a^{2^x - 1} equiv -1 pmod{p} ). 8. **Raising to the power ( 2^x )**: This implies ( a^{2^x} equiv -a pmod{p} ). Substituting ( a = -2^{2^n} ), we get ( (-2^{2^n})^{2^x} equiv -a pmod{p} ). 9. **Simplifying the expression**: This simplifies to ( 2^{2^{n+x}} equiv -a pmod{p} ). Since ( x > 1 ), let ( m = n + x ). Then ( m > n ) and we have ( 2^{2^m} + a equiv 0 pmod{p} ). 10. **Conclusion**: This implies that ( 2^{2^m} + a ) is divisible by ( p ), and hence it cannot be prime (since it is greater than ( p ) and divisible by ( p )). Therefore, our initial assumption that ( 2^{2^n} + a ) is prime for all ( n ) is false. Hence, for some nonnegative integer ( n ), the number ( 2^{2^n} + a ) is not prime.

There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute.

If the net increase is 2 people per second, and the birth rate contributes 3 people per second, then the death rate must be subtracting 1 person per second to result in a net increase of 2 people per second.

Monthly payment for the house = Monthly payment for the trailer + 1500 So, the monthly payment for the house = T + 1500 Total amount paid for the house over 20 years = (T + 1500) * 240 Now, let's set up an equation to find the cost of the house. Cost of the house = Total amount paid for the house over 20 years Cost of the trailer = 120,000 We know that the total amount paid for the trailer is 120,000, so: 120,000 = T * 240 Now, we can solve for T: T = 120,000 / 240 T = 500 So, the monthly payment for the trailer is 500. Now, we can find the monthly payment for the house: Monthly payment for the house = T + 1500 Monthly payment for the house = 500 + 1500 Monthly payment for the house = 2000 Now, we can calculate the total amount paid for the house over 20 years: Total amount paid for the house = Monthly payment for the house * 240 Total amount paid for the house = 2000 * 240 Total amount paid for the house = 480,000 Therefore, the cost of the house is boxed{480,000} ."},{"instruction":"Given a tetrahedron (ABCD) where one edge has a length of 3, and the remaining five edges each have a length of 2, find the radius of its circumscribed sphere.","output":"Given the tetrahedron (ABCD), we know one edge length is (3) while the rest of the five edge lengths are (2).

Since the sum of all the vectors from the original 100-gon including parallelograms still results in a net vector sum of zero, each of the triangles' side vectors must also sum to zero.    - Choose ell parallel to one side of the first triangle.

Now, simplify each fraction: dfrac{15sqrt{2}}{10sqrt{2}} = dfrac{15}{10} = dfrac{3}{2}, dfrac{7sqrt{2}}{7} = sqrt{2}. Assuming sqrt{2} can be approximated as frac{sqrt{2}}{1}, we now add the two fractions: frac{3}{2} + sqrt{2}. Since sqrt{2} is approximately 1.414, we express sqrt{2} as a fraction that fits with the denominator of 2: sqrt{2} approx frac{1414}{1000} approx frac{1414}{1000} cdot frac{2}{2} = frac{2828}{2000} = frac{1414}{1000}. To add frac{3}{2} and frac{1414}{1000}, we convert frac{3}{2} into a fraction with a denominator of 1000: frac{3}{2} = frac{3 cdot 500}{2 cdot 500} = frac{1500}{1000}. Now, add the two: frac{1500}{1000} + frac{1414}{1000} = frac{2914}{1000} = frac{1457}{500}.

It's given that both points are above the line y=-3a, and y_{1} > y_{2}. We need to find the range of values for m. First, let's analyze the condition that both points are above the line y=-3a: 1. Since a < 0, we know that -3a > 0 because multiplying a negative number by a negative constant results in a positive number. 2. For point A(m,y_{1}), substituting x=m into the quadratic equation gives us y_{1} = am^{2}-4am. Similarly, for point B(2m,y_{2}), substituting x=2m gives us y_{2} = 4am^{2}-8am. 3. Given that y_{1} > y_{2} and both are above the line y=-3a, we have:    - am^{2}-4am > -3a and 4am^{2}-8am > -3a.    - Simplifying the inequality for y_{2} gives us 4am^{2}-8am > -3a Rightarrow 4m^{2}-8m+3 < 0 (dividing by a < 0 reverses the inequality sign).    - Solving the quadratic inequality 4m^{2}-8m+3 < 0 gives us frac{1}{2} < m < frac{3}{2}.

Create their script in FILIPINO Here is the chapter 4: Those who have read the first part of this story will perhaps remember an old wood-cutter who lived in the depths of the forest.1 Tandang Selo is still alive, and though his hair has turned completely white, he yet preserves his good health. He no longer hunts or cuts firewood, for his fortunes have improved and he works only at making brooms. His son Tales (abbreviation of Telesforo) had worked at first on shares on the lands of a capitalist, but later, having become the owner of two carabaos and several hundred pesos, determined to work on his own account, aided by his father, his wife, and his three children. So they cut down and cleared away some thick woods which were situated on the borders of the town and which they believed belonged to no one. During the labors of cleaning and cultivating the new land, the whole family fell ill with malaria and the mother died, along with the eldest daughter, Lucia, in the flower of her age. This, which was the natural consequence of breaking up new soil infested with various kinds of bacteria, they attributed to the anger of the woodland spirit, so they were resigned and went on with their labor, believing him pacified. But when they began to harvest their first crop a religious corporation, which owned land in the neighboring town, laid claim to the fields, alleging that they fell within their boundaries, and to prove it they at once started to set up [31]their marks. However, the administrator of the religious order left to them, for humanity’s sake, the usufruct of the land on condition that they pay a small sum annually—a mere bagatelle, twenty or thirty pesos. Tales, as peaceful a man as could be found, was as much opposed to lawsuits as any one and more submissive to the friars than most people; so, in order not to smash a palyok against a kawali (as he said, for to him the friars were iron pots and he a clay jar), he had the weakness to yield to their claim, remembering that he did not know Spanish and had no money to pay lawyers. Besides, Tandang Selo said to him, “Patience! You would spend more in one year of litigation than in ten years of paying what the white padres demand. And perhaps they’ll pay you back in masses! Pretend that those thirty pesos had been lost in gambling or had fallen into the water and been swallowed by a cayman.” The harvest was abundant and sold well, so Tales planned to build a wooden house in the barrio of Sagpang, of the town of Tiani, which adjoined San Diego. Another year passed, bringing another good crop, and for this reason the friars raised the rent to fifty pesos, which Tales paid in order not to quarrel and because he expected to sell his sugar at a good price. “Patience! Pretend that the cayman has grown some,” old Selo consoled him. That year he at last saw his dream realized: to live in the barrio of Sagpang in a wooden house. The father and grandfather then thought of providing some education for the two children, especially the daughter Juliana, or Juli, as they called her, for she gave promise of being accomplished and beautiful. A boy who was a friend of the family, Basilio, was studying in Manila, and he was of as lowly origin as they. But this dream seemed destined not to be realized. The first care the community took when they saw the family prospering was to appoint as cabeza de barangay its most [32]industrious member, which left only Tano, the son, who was only fourteen years old. The father was therefore called Cabesang Tales and had to order a sack coat, buy a felt hat, and prepare to spend his money. In order to avoid any quarrel with the curate or the government, he settled from his own pocket the shortages in the tax-lists, paying for those who had died or moved away, and he lost considerable time in making the collections and on his trips to the capital. “Patience! Pretend that the cayman’s relatives have joined him,” advised Tandang Selo, smiling placidly. “Next year you’ll put on a long skirt and go to Manila to study like the young ladies of the town,” Cabesang Tales told his daughter every time he heard her talking of Basilio’s progress. But that next year did not come, and in its stead there was another increase in the rent. Cabesang Tales became serious and scratched his head. The clay jar was giving up all its rice to the iron pot. When the rent had risen to two hundred pesos, Tales was not content with scratching his head and sighing; he murmured and protested. The friar-administrator then told him that if he could not pay, some one else would be assigned to cultivate that land—many who desired it had offered themselves. He thought at first that the friar was joking, but the friar was talking seriously, and indicated a servant of his to take possession of the land. Poor Tales turned pale, he felt a buzzing in his ears, he saw in the red mist that rose before his eyes his wife and daughter, pallid, emaciated, dying, victims of the intermittent fevers—then he saw the thick forest converted into productive fields, he saw the stream of sweat watering its furrows, he saw himself plowing under the hot sun, bruising his feet against the stones and roots, while this friar had been driving about in his carriage with the wretch who was to get the land following like a slave behind his master. No, a thousand [33]times, no! First let the fields sink into the depths of the earth and bury them all! Who was this intruder that he should have any right to his land? Had he brought from his own country a single handful of that soil? Had he crooked a single one of his fingers to pull up the roots that ran through it? Exasperated by the threats of the friar, who tried to uphold his authority at any cost in the presence of the other tenants, Cabesang Tales rebelled and refused to pay a single cuarto, having ever before himself that red mist, saying that he would give up his fields to the first man who could irrigate it with blood drawn from his own veins. Old Selo, on looking at his son’s face, did not dare to mention the cayman, but tried to calm him by talking of clay jars, reminding him that the winner in a lawsuit was left without a shirt to his back. “We shall all be turned to clay, father, and without shirts we were born,” was the reply. So he resolutely refused to pay or to give up a single span of his land unless the friars should first prove the legality of their claim by exhibiting a title-deed of some kind. As they had none, a lawsuit followed, and Cabesang Tales entered into it, confiding that some at least, if not all, were lovers of justice and respecters of the law. “I serve and have been serving the King with my money and my services,” he said to those who remonstrated with him. “I’m asking for justice and he is obliged to give it to me.” Drawn on by fatality, and as if he had put into play in the lawsuit the whole future of himself and his children, he went on spending his savings to pay lawyers, notaries, and solicitors, not to mention the officials and clerks who exploited his ignorance and his needs. He moved to and fro between the village and the capital, passed his days without eating and his nights without sleeping, while his talk was always about briefs, exhibits, and appeals. There was then seen a struggle such as was never before carried on under the skies of the Philippines: that of a poor Indian, [34]ignorant and friendless, confiding in the justness and righteousness of his cause, fighting against a powerful corporation before which Justice bowed her head, while the judges let fall the scales and surrendered the sword. He fought as tenaciously as the ant which bites when it knows that it is going to be crushed, as does the fly which looks into space only through a pane of glass. Yet the clay jar defying the iron pot and smashing itself into a thousand pieces bad in it something impressive—it had the sublimeness of desperation! On the days when his journeys left him free he patrolled his fields armed with a shotgun, saying that the tulisanes were hovering around and he had need of defending himself in order not to fall into their hands and thus lose his lawsuit. As if to improve his marksmanship, he shot at birds and fruits, even the butterflies, with such accurate aim that the friar-administrator did not dare to go to Sagpang without an escort of civil-guards, while the friar’s hireling, who gazed from afar at the threatening figure of Tales wandering over the fields like a sentinel upon the walls, was terror stricken and refused to take the property away from him. But the local judges and those at the capital, warned by the experience of one of their number who had been summarily dismissed, dared not give him the decision, fearing their own dismissal. Yet they were not really bad men, those judges, they were upright and conscientious, good citizens, excellent fathers, dutiful sons—and they were able to appreciate poor Tales’ situation better than Tales himself could. Many of them were versed in the scientific and historical basis of property, they knew that the friars by their own statutes could not own property, but they also knew that to come from far across the sea with an appointment secured with great difficulty, to undertake the duties of the position with the best intentions, and now to lose it because an Indian fancied that justice had to be done on earth as in heaven—that surely was an idea! They had their [35]families and greater needs surely than that Indian: one had a mother to provide for, and what duty is more sacred than that of caring for a mother? Another had sisters, all of marriageable age; that other there had many little children who expected their daily bread and who, like fledglings in a nest, would surely die of hunger the day he was out of a job; even the very least of them had there, far away, a wife who would be in distress if the monthly remittance failed. All these moral and conscientious judges tried everything in their power in the way of counsel, advising Cabesang Tales to pay the rent demanded. But Tales, like all simple souls, once he had seen what was just, went straight toward it. He demanded proofs, documents, papers, title-deeds, but the friars had none of these, resting their case on his concessions in the past. Cabesang Tales’ constant reply was: “If every day I give alms to a beggar to escape annoyance, who will oblige me to continue my gifts if he abuses my generosity?” From this stand no one could draw him, nor were there any threats that could intimidate him. In vain Governor M—— made a trip expressly to talk to him and frighten him. His reply to it all was: “You may do what you like, Mr. Governor, I’m ignorant and powerless. But I’ve cultivated those fields, my wife and daughter died while helping me clear them, and I won’t give them up to any one but him who can do more with them than I’ve done. Let him first irrigate them with his blood and bury in them his wife and daughter!” The upshot of this obstinacy was that the honorable judges gave the decision to the friars, and everybody laughed at him, saying that lawsuits are not won by justice. But Cabesang Tales appealed, loaded his shotgun, and patrolled his fields with deliberation. During this period his life seemed to be a wild dream. His son, Tano, a youth as tall as his father and as good as his sister, was conscripted, but he let the boy go rather than purchase a substitute.[36] “I have to pay the lawyers,” he told his weeping daughter. “If I win the case I’ll find a way to get him back, and if I lose it I won’t have any need for sons.” So the son went away and nothing more was heard of him except that his hair had been cropped and that he slept under a cart. Six months later it was rumored that he had been seen embarking for the Carolines; another report was that he had been seen in the uniform of the Civil Guard. “Tano in the Civil Guard! ’Susmariosep!” exclaimed several, clasping their hands. “Tano, who was so good and so honest! Requimternam!” The grandfather went many days without speaking to the father, Juli fell sick, but Cabesang Tales did not shed a single tear, although for two days he never left the house, as if he feared the looks of reproach from the whole village or that he would be called the executioner of his son. But on the third day he again sallied forth with his shotgun. Murderous intentions were attributed to him, and there were well-meaning persons who whispered about that he had been heard to threaten that he would bury the friar-administrator in the furrows of his fields, whereat the friar was frightened at him in earnest. As a result of this, there came a decree from the Captain-General forbidding the use of firearms and ordering that they be taken up. Cabesang Tales had to hand over his shotgun but he continued his rounds armed with a long bolo. “What are you going to do with that bolo when the tulisanes have firearms?” old Selo asked him. “I must watch my crops,” was the answer. “Every stalk of cane growing there is one of my wife’s bones.” The bolo was taken up on the pretext that it was too long. He then took his father’s old ax and with it on his shoulder continued his sullen rounds. Every time he left the house Tandang Selo and Juli trembled for his life. The latter would get up from her loom, go to the window, pray, make vows to the saints, and [37]recite novenas. The grandfather was at times unable to finish the handle of a broom and talked of returning to the forest—life in that house was unbearable. At last their fears were realized. As the fields were some distance from the village, Cabesang Tales, in spite of his ax, fell into the hands of tulisanes who had revolvers and rifles. They told him that since he had money to pay judges and lawyers he must have some also for the outcasts and the hunted. They therefore demanded a ransom of five hundred pesos through the medium of a rustic, with the warning that if anything happened to their messenger, the captive would pay for it with his life. Two days of grace were allowed. This news threw the poor family into the wildest terror, which was augmented when they learned that the Civil Guard was going out in pursuit of the bandits. In case of an encounter, the first victim would be the captive—this they all knew. The old man was paralyzed, while the pale and frightened daughter tried often to talk but could not. Still, another thought more terrible, an idea more cruel, roused them from their stupor. The rustic sent by the tulisanes said that the band would probably have to move on, and if they were slow in sending the ransom the two days would elapse and Cabesang Tales would have his throat cut. This drove those two beings to madness, weak and powerless as they were. Tandang Selo got up, sat down, went outside, came back again, knowing not where to go, where to seek aid. Juli appealed to her images, counted and recounted her money, but her two hundred pesos did not increase or multiply. Soon she dressed herself, gathered together all her jewels, and asked the advice of her grandfather, if she should go to see the gobernadorcillo, the judge, the notary, the lieutenant of the Civil Guard. The old man said yes to everything, or when she said no, he too said no. At length came the neighbors, their relatives and friends, some poorer than others, in their simplicity magnifying [38]the fears. The most active of all was Sister Bali, a great panguinguera, who had been to Manila to practise religious exercises in the nunnery of the Sodality. Juli was willing to sell all her jewels, except a locket set with diamonds and emeralds which Basilio had given her, for this locket had a history: a nun, the daughter of Capitan Tiago, had given it to a leper, who, in return for professional treatment, had made a present of it to Basilio. So she could not sell it without first consulting him. Quickly the shell-combs and earrings were sold, as well as Juli’s rosary, to their richest neighbor, and thus fifty pesos were added, but two hundred and fifty were still lacking. The locket might be pawned, but Juli shook her head. A neighbor suggested that the house be sold and Tandang Selo approved the idea, satisfied to return to the forest and cut firewood as of old, but Sister Bali observed that this could not be done because the owner was not present. “The judge’s wife once sold me her tapis for a peso, but her husband said that the sale did not hold because it hadn’t received his approval. Abá! He took back the tapis and she hasn’t returned the peso yet, but I don’t pay her when she wins at panguingui, abá! In that way I’ve collected twelve cuartos, and for that alone I’m going to play with her. I can’t bear to have people fail to pay what they owe me, abá!” Another neighbor was going to ask Sister Bali why then did not she settle a little account with her, but the quick panguinguera suspected this and added at once: “Do you know, Juli, what you can do? Borrow two hundred and fifty pesos on the house, payable when the lawsuit is won.” This seemed to be the best proposition, so they decided to act upon it that same day. Sister Bali offered to accompany her, and together they visited the houses of all the rich folks in Tiani, but no one would accept the proposal. The case, they said, was already lost, and to show favors to an enemy of the friars was to expose themselves to their [39]vengeance. At last a pious woman took pity on the girl and lent the money on condition that Juli should remain with her as a servant until the debt was paid. Juli would not have so very much to do: sew, pray, accompany her to mass, and fast for her now and then. The girl accepted with tears in her eyes, received the money, and promised to enter her service on the following day, Christmas. When the grandfather heard of that sale he fell to weeping like a child. What, that granddaughter whom he had not allowed to walk in the sun lest her skin should be burned, Juli, she of the delicate fingers and rosy feet! What, that girl, the prettiest in the village and perhaps in the whole town, before whose window many gallants had vainly passed the night playing and singing! What, his only granddaughter, the sole joy of his fading eyes, she whom he had dreamed of seeing dressed in a long skirt, talking Spanish, and holding herself erect waving a painted fan like the daughters of the wealthy—she to become a servant, to be scolded and reprimanded, to ruin her fingers, to sleep anywhere, to rise in any manner whatsoever! So the old grandfather wept and talked of hanging or starving himself to death. “If you go,” he declared, “I’m going back to the forest and will never set foot in the town.” Juli soothed him by saying that it was necessary for her father to return, that the suit would be won, and they could then ransom her from her servitude. The night was a sad one. Neither of the two could taste a bite and the old man refused to lie down, passing the whole night seated in a corner, silent and motionless. Juli on her part tried to sleep, but for a long time could not close her eyes. Somewhat relieved about her father’s fate, she now thought of herself and fell to weeping, but stifled her sobs so that the old man might not hear them. The next day she would be a servant, and it was the very day Basilio was accustomed to come from Manila with presents for her. Henceforward she would have to give up that love; Basilio, who was going to be a doctor, couldn’t marry a [40]pauper. In fancy she saw him going to the church in company with the prettiest and richest girl in the town, both well-dressed, happy and smiling, while she, Juli, followed her mistress, carrying novenas, buyos, and the cuspidor. Here the girl felt a lump rise in her throat, a sinking at her heart, and begged the Virgin to let her die first. But—said her conscience—he will at least know that I preferred to pawn myself rather than the locket he gave me. This thought consoled her a little and brought on empty dreams. Who knows but that a miracle might happen? She might find the two hundred and fifty pesos under the image of the Virgin—she had read of many similar miracles. The sun might not rise nor morning come, and meanwhile the suit would be won. Her father might return, or Basilio put in his appearance, she might find a bag of gold in the garden, the tulisanes would send the bag of gold, the curate, Padre Camorra, who was always teasing her, would come with the tulisanes. So her ideas became more and more confused, until at length, worn out by fatigue and sorrow, she went to sleep with dreams of her childhood in the depths of the forest: she was bathing in the torrent along with her two brothers, there were little fishes of all colors that let themselves be caught like fools, and she became impatient because she found no pleasure in catchnig such foolish little fishes! Basilio was under the water, but Basilio for some reason had the face of her brother Tano. Her new mistress was watching them from the bank.","output":"**Steven's Recap Script:** **Steven:** Magandang araw sa inyong lahat! Bago natin simulan ang ating pangunahing talakayan ukol sa akdang \\"El Filibusterismo\\" ni Gat Jose Rizal, hayaan ninyo akong magbigay pugay at pagkilala sa dakilang manunulat na lumikha ng obra maestrang ito. Si Dr. Jose Rizal ay isang Pilipinong bayani, manunulat, makata, at isang rebolusyonaryo na nakilala sa buong mundo dahil sa kanyang makabuluhang kontribusyon sa laban para sa kalayaan ng Pilipinas mula sa kolonyalismong Espanyol. Isa siyang henyo sa iba’t ibang larangan at aktibong lumahok sa kilusang reporma. Isinulat ni Jose Rizal ang \\"El Filibusterismo,\\" na karugtong ng kanyang unang nobela, \\"Noli Me Tangere,\\" bilang tugon sa di-makatarungang pamamalakad ng mga Kastila sa ating bayan. Layon ng akdang ito na ipakita ang mapait na kalagayan ng mga Pilipino at pasiklabin ang damdamin ng kanyang mga kababayan upang mag-alsa laban sa pang-aapi. Sa pagsulat ng \\"El Filibusterismo,\\" inilarawan ni Rizal ang mga masasaklap na realidad ng lipunang Pilipino sa ilalim ng mga frayleng mapang-abuso at ang kolonyal na gobyerno. Hinikayat niya ang mga Pilipino na magising, mag-isip, at kumilos laban sa mga katiwaliang nagaganap. Ngayon, makakasama natin sina Jerben at Gleann, dalawang di-umano'y Katipunero na \\"naglakbay sa oras\\" dito sa ating panahon, at magbabahagi sila ng kuwento patungkol sa kabanata apat ng \\"El Filibusterismo.\\" Salamat at makinig po kayong mabuti! **Radio Interview Script with Jerben, Gleann, and Krez:** **Krez:** Magandang araw, mga kababayan! Ako si Krez at inyo akong sasamahan sa isang hindi pangkaraniwang panayam kasama si Jerben at Gleann, dalawang matatapang na Katipunero na napadpad sa ating panahon. Mga bayani, ihayag ninyo ang mga pangyayari sa kabanata apat ng \\"El Filibusterismo.\\" Simulan natin ang kuwento – sino ba si Tandang Selo at ano ang kanyang ginagawa sa kagubatan? **Jerben:** Ah, si Tandang Selo po, siya ay dating mangangahoy na naninirahan sa kailaliman ng gubat. Bagamat tumanda na at nagkaputi ang buhok, nananatiling malakas at masigla si Tandang Selo. Sa ngayon, siya’y gumagawa na lamang ng mga walis dahil naging mabuti ang takbo ng buhay nila. **Gleann:** Tama ka diyan, Jerben. Ang kanyang anak na si Tales, o Telesforo, ay dati ring nagtatrabaho sa lupa ng isang mayaman subalit siya’y nagpasyang magtrabaho sa kanyang sariling paraan nang magkaroon siya ng dalawang kalabaw at ilang daang piso. Pinutol nila at nilinang ang mga kakahuyan sa hangganan ng bayan na inaakala nilang walang nagmamay-ari. **Krez:** Pero ano naman ang nangyari sa pamilya habang linilinang nila ang lupa? **Jerben:** Naku, mahirap po ang kanilang sinapit, Krez. Lahat sila'y nagkasakit ng malaria at namatay pa ang ina at panganay na anak na si Lucia. Itinuring nila itong palatandaan ng galit ng espiritu ng kagubatan, ngunit nagpatuloy pa rin sila sa gawaing bukid. **Krez:** Napakalungkot naman. Ngunit ano itong narinig ko na may isang relihiyosong korporasyon na umangkin sa kanilang lupain? **Gleann:** Ah, oo. Nang magsimula silang umani ng kanilang mga pananim, ang nasabing korporasyon, na may-ari ng lupa sa kalapit bayan, ay nag-angkin sa kanilang taniman at hiningian sila ng taunang bayad bilang kabayaran sa paggamit ng lupa. Bagama’t mapayapa si Tales at ayaw sa gusot, napilitan siyang pumayag dahil wala siyang pera sa pag-abogado at hindi rin siya marunong mag-Espanyol. **Krez:** Nakakabahala nga ang kanilang sitwasyon. Pero, totoo bang patuloy na tumaas ang upa sa kanilang lupa? **Jerben:** Oo, Krez. Dahil mabuti ang takbo ng ani, itinaas ng mga frayle ang upa hanggang sa puntong hindi na makayanan ni Tales. At dahil sa hindi niya pagtanggap sa panibagong halaga, naramdaman niyang kinakailangan niyang labanin ang mga paratang. **Krez:** Mabigat na desisyon nga ito para kay Tales. Ano ang naging epekto nito sa kanyang pamilya? **Gleann:** Naging mahigpit siya sa pera dahil ginugol niya ito sa pambayad sa mga abogado para sa kasong kanyang hinaharap. At nang siya ay hindi pumayag na bayaran ang malaking upa, napilitan siyang ipagtanggol ang kanyang lupa sa mga taong nagtangka na kunin ito sa kanyang pamilya. **Krez:** Mga bayani, salamat sa inyong tapang at dedikasyon sa paglalahad ng pangyayari sa kabanata apat ng “El Filibusterismo.” Marami tayong natutunan sa pakikibaka ni Tales at sa laban ng kanyang pamilya para sa kanilang karapatan at dignidad. Maraming salamat, Jerben at Gleann. **Jerben:** Walang anuman, Krez. **Gleann:** Maraming salamat din at nawa’y magsilbi itong inspirasyon sa ating lahat. Mabuhay ang kalayaan! **Krez:** Muli, ako po si Krez, nagpapaalam sa inyo hanggang sa muli nating pagkikita. Mabuhay ang laya ng Pilipinas!"},{"instruction":"Перефразируй “2.

On January 3, 2023, \\"Elelo\\", a five-year-old pacific white-sided dolphin housed in Pompano pool 3, underwent a gastroscopy procedure to identify and remove foreign material from his digestive tract. The procedure successfully removed a plastic zip tie, a piece of broken plastic, and what was described as a large piece of cement. Zip ties are used to secure the fencing around the sides of the pool, the broken plastic was determined to likely be from a target pole, and divers noted that the floor of the pool has a layer of broken, flaking cement. On July 5, 2023, \\"Elelo\\" was once again suspected to have a foreign body. He was made to regurgitate, producing sand and glass filtration media. What is \\"media\\" in this context and how are captive dolphins made to regurgitate","output":"In the context provided, \\"media\\" refers to the materials used in a filtration system, which is designed to purify water by removing contaminants. Filtration media can consist of various substances, including sand, activated charcoal, glass beads, or any other compound used within the filters to help clean the water in which the dolphins swim. The media mentioned here is likely used in the facility's water filtration system for Pompano pool 3. If not properly maintained, pieces of this material could end up in the pool and potentially be ingested by marine mammals like dolphins. As for inducing regurgitation in captive dolphins, it is a procedure often undertaken by veterinarians or trained marine mammal specialists when there is a suspicion that an animal has ingested something harmful, and it needs to be expelled from the stomach to prevent further complications or health issues. This process involves stimulating the pharyngeal area or using certain medications to trigger a vomiting reflex. It should be noted that making an animal regurgitate is a sensitive procedure and should only be carried out by professionals to ensure the welfare of the animal. This procedure can be stressful and may not always be successful, so it is used with caution and typically only when necessary for the animal's health."},{"instruction":"what is this code? #define IR_SENSOR_RIGHT 11 #define IR_SENSOR_LEFT 12 #define MOTOR_SPEED 125 //Right motor int enableRightMotor=5; int rightMotorPin1=7; int rightMotorPin2=8; //Left motor int enableLeftMotor=6; int leftMotorPin1=9; int leftMotorPin2=10; void setup() { //The problem with TT gear motors is that, at very low pwm value it does not even rotate. //If we increase the PWM value then it rotates faster and our robot is not controlled in that speed and goes out of line. //For that we need to increase the frequency of analogWrite. //Below line is important to change the frequency of PWM signal on pin D5 and D6 //Because of this, motor runs in controlled manner (lower speed) at high PWM value. //This sets frequecny as 7812.5 hz.

Here's a summary of what key parts of the code do: - Defines and setup variables for the IR sensors and motor pins. - The \`#define\` preprocessor directives set up constants for the right and left IR sensors' pin numbers (11 and 12) and the default motor speed (125). - Setup for the PWM frequency. - Changes the frequency of the PWM signals on pins D5 and D6 (where the enable pins for the motors are) to 7812.5 Hz by manipulating the Timer/Counter Control Registers (TCCR0B). This allows for a finer control of motor speed at lower power levels. - Pin modes are set for the motor control pins and IR sensor pins in the \`setup()\` function. - OUTPUT for the motor enable and control pins - INPUT for the IR sensor pins - \`rotateMotor\` function: - Takes two arguments (\`rightMotorSpeed\` and \`leftMotorSpeed\`) to control the speed and direction of the right and left motors, respectively. - Adjusts the motor control pins (HIGH/LOW) to determine the direction (forward or reverse). - Uses \`analogWrite\` to set the speed of the motors by using PWM on the enable pins. - In the \`loop()\` function (which runs continuously): - Reads the values from the IR sensors (\`HIGH\` when no line is detected; \`LOW\` when black line is detected). - Determines the movement of the robot based on the sensor values: - If neither sensor detects a line, the robot moves forward. - If the right sensor detects a line, the robot turns right. - If the left sensor detects a line, the robot turns left. - If both sensors detect a line, the robot stops. The code is likely used in a line-following robot where IR sensors detect a line on the ground, and the robot's logic uses this information to follow the line by controlling the motors' speeds and directions. Some possible applications include line-tracking robots for educational purposes or automated vehicles that follow predefined paths in industrial settings."},{"instruction":"does it have errors? like it is my code way before in the year 2022. maybe the arduino updated that the old code no longer works?","output":"The code you've provided appears syntactically correct for the version of the Arduino environment as of my knowledge cut-off date in early 2023, and it should work if the right hardware setup is used. However, without knowledge of your specific hardware setup, it is difficult to confirm that the code will work exactly as intended. There are a few points to consider: 1. Hardware Compatibility: Make sure that your hardware (IR sensors, motor driver, Arduino board, motors) is still functional and properly wired according to the pin definitions in the code. 2. Library and Board Updates: If the Arduino IDE, libraries, or boards definitions have been updated, you need to make sure that the code is still compatible. Issues might arise if newer versions have changed the way certain functions work or if there are changes in the timers or PWM settings. 3. Timer Configuration: The line \`TCCR0B = TCCR0B & B11111000 | B00000010;\` modifies the timer's control register to change the PWM frequency on pins 5 and 6. This line of code directly manipulates the MCU's registers. If there have been changes to the MCU architecture or the register layout in newer versions of the Arduino hardware, this could lead to unexpected behavior or may no longer be valid. 4. Motor Driver: Ensure that the motor driver can handle the frequency and current requested by the motors and that it's compatible with the signals provided by the Arduino board. 5. Testing: Before assuming that the code will not work, it's always best to upload and test the code with your current setup to see if it behaves as expected. If there is an issue, the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor is a great debugging tool to help understand what's going on. 6. Documentation: Keep an eye on the official Arduino release notes and documentation for any breaking changes that may affect your code. Check if newer versions of the Arduino IDE have deprecated or introduced functions that your code relies on. If you run into any issues or error messages when trying to upload or run this code on newer versions of the Arduino IDE, you might have to make some adjustments. As of the date of my knowledge, the core functions used in the code (\`pinMode\`, \`digitalRead\`, \`analogWrite\`, etc.) have not seen breaking changes that would render the code inoperable. If you are attempting to run this code on newly released hardware or using a significantly updated IDE version, it would be advisable to review the release notes and hardware specifications for any relevant changes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

(Сначала приведите пример, затем назовите фактор производства.) (Каждый пример должен быть сформулирован развёрнуто.)ASSISTANT: Конечно, вот три примера влияния изменения цены факторов производства на предложение товаров и услуг:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Рост цен на сталь для автомобильной промышленности</strong> <br/> Пример: Предположим, что на мировом рынке происходит значительное подорожание стали, которая является ключевым ресурсом для производства автомобилей. Это увеличение стоимости сырья ведет к повышению общих издержек производства для автомобилестроительных компаний. В результате, чтобы сохранить свою рентабельность, производители могут сократить объем производства или поднять цены на свои автомобили. Значит, предложение автомобилей на рынке уменьшается, что может увеличить цены или привести к дефициту некоторых моделей.<br/> Фактор производства: Сырье (сталь).<br/><br/>2. <strong>Изменение стоимости электроэнергии для IT-центров</strong><br/> Пример: Компаниям, предоставляющим облачные сервисы, для работы своих дата-центров требуется большое количество электроэнергии. Если стоимость электроэнергии резко возрастает из-за, например, политического решения или увеличения цен на ископаемое топливо, то операционные затраты таких компаний также повышаются. Это может вынудить их или увеличить цены на предоставляемые услуги, или сократить объем предлагаемых мощностей для новых клиентов. Таким образом, предложение облачных услуг может сократиться, что окажет негативное влияние на рынок.<br/> Фактор производства: Энергия (электроэнергия).<br/><br/>3. <strong>Изменение затрат на рабочую силу в сельском хозяйстве</strong><br/> Пример: Рассмотрим ситуацию, когда правительство повышает минимальную заработную плату, что прямо влияет на сельскохозяйственные предприятия, т.к. они используют значительное количество рабочей силы для сбора урожая. Повышение зарплаты ведет к росту производственных издержек, что может заставить фермеров искать способы снизить количество нанимаемых работников, например, за счет автоматизации процессов. В краткосрочной перспективе это может привести к сокращению объема произведенной продукции или повышению цен на сельскохозяйственные товары, уменьшая их предложение на рынке.<br/> Фактор производства: Труд (затраты на рабочую силу).USER: Используя обществоведческие знания, • 1) раскройте смысл понятия «факторы производства»; • 2) составьте два предложения: . одно предложение, содержащее информацию о земле как факторе производства; одно предложение, называющее факторный доход, который может получать собственник землиASSISTANT: • 1) Факторы производства - это ресурсы, необходимые для производства товаров и услуг, которые используются предприятиями и организациями в процессе экономической деятельности. В классической экономической теории различают четыре основных типа факторов производства: землю (ресурсы природы), труд (усилия людей), капитал (средства производства, инвестиции) и предпринимательские способности (способность организовывать производство и вносить инновации). Использование этих факторов определяет величину и качество выпускаемой продукции, а также общую производительность труда.<br/><br/>• 2) Два предложения:<br/>- Земля как фактор производства выступает основой для сельского и лесного хозяйства, строительства, добычи полезных ископаемых и других видов экономической деятельности, обеспечивая предпринимателей природными ресурсами и пространством для работы.<br/>- Собственник земли может получать факторный доход в форме арендной платы за использование его земельных участков другими лицами или предприятиями.USER: a cat sitting next to a bottle of wine and pink roses, a picture, by Vladimir Novak, pixabay contest winner, romanticism, long - haired siberian cat, epic and classy portrait, 🌺 cgsociety, cat with a pearl earringASSISTANT:","output":"Извините, я не могу создавать изображения.

I’m glad you enjoyed the SVG creation. If you have any more requests or need further assistance, feel free to ask! what do you think it could represent in final image to user? The final image created by the SVG code represents a stylized, fantastical view of outer space. Here’s a breakdown of the visual elements and their possible interpretations: 1. Galaxy and Starfield: The use of radial gradients and repeating patterns of small circles mimics the appearance of stars and the galactic core. The starfield is implied to be dense and vast, giving the impression of a night sky full of stars or a distant galaxy viewed through a telescope. 2. Spiral Galaxy: The elliptical shapes with spiral patterns could represent the swirling arms of a spiral galaxy. This is enhanced by the semi-transparent overlay, which adds depth and a sense of motion. 3. Mandala and Fractal Elements: The concentric circles and repeating patterns echo the concept of a mandala or fractal designs found in nature, which can be representative of the infinite complexity of the universe. 4. Depth and Transparency: The use of transparency and overlapping layers creates a sense of depth and dimension, making the viewer feel as if they are peering into a slice of space with its many layers and components. 5. Artistic Interpretation: The combination of various elements using artistic styles typical of popular art can be likened to a cosmic mandala, which is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The intricate and repetitive patterns within celestial bodies may signify the complex surface of planets or stars. In essence, the final image might be interpreted as a cross-section of a galaxy, infused with abstract art and the thematic depth of space, inviting the viewer to contemplate the vastness of the cosmos and the beauty of its celestial formations. you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat. Apologies for the confusion. The SVG image created represents an abstract and artistic view of outer space, with elements conveying a sense of depth and complexity. At its heart, it’s a cosmic scene with spiraling patterns suggesting galaxies amidst a field of stars. The transparency and layering give an illusion of three-dimensional space, while the variety of elements and gradients create a visually rich and engaging image that might evoke in the viewer a sense of wonder at the universe’s grandeur. and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? The SVG artwork is an abstract and stylized representation, not an accurate depiction of real cosmic structures. However, here’s an interpretation of the various elements as if they were parts of the universe: - Radial Gradient Background: This part of the image could represent the vast and expansive backdrop of space itself, possibly a region of interstellar medium with varying concentrations of gas and dust creating a diffuse nebula. - Dense Starfield Pattern: The small, randomly placed circles within the pattern might symbolize countless distant stars, possibly those found in our own Milky Way galaxy, creating the effect of a dense starfield that one might see far from the light pollution of inhabited areas. - Spiral Patterns: The elliptical shape with a spiral pattern may evoke the spiraling arms of a spiral galaxy, reminiscent of galaxies such as the Milky Way or Andromeda, with the semi-transparency implying layers of stars and cosmic dust. - Concentric Circles: These could stand in for a simplified artistic version of a solar system or a planetary nebula, with layers representing planet orbits or the shells of gas and dust expelled by a dying star. - Central Circles: The central circles, with varying opacities and sizes, might be interpreted as a stylized artistic representation of a star or its surrounding accretion disk, exhibiting a luminous core surrounded by layers of material. The overall image is meant to convey a fantastical impression of a region in the universe where the intricate dance of stellar and galactic formations can lead the observer’s imagination on a journey through the cosmos. It doesn’t correspond to a specific real-world location in the universe but rather serves to capture the beauty and mystery of the celestial realm as a whole. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. The SVG image isn’t a map of real celestial objects, but if we were to assign imaginative names to the abstract elements inspired by cosmic features, we could name them as follows: - Nebulous Expanse: The gradient background suggests the dark canvas of space, possibly a region within the Orion Arm of the Milky Way where Earth is located. - Luminous Field: The pattern of small circles could represent a starfield within the Milky Way, an array of distant suns from various star clusters. - Galactic Swirl: The elliptical spiral could be an artistic interpretation of the Andromeda Galaxy, a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way and our nearest galactic neighbor. - Orbital Rings: The concentric circles might represent an artistic portrayal of the Trappist-1 system, known for its seven Earth-sized planets. - Stellar Core: The central circles with varying opacity could symbolize the bright core of a star, perhaps resembling a young, hot star within the Pleiades cluster. Each element symbolizes a different aspect of space without exactly pinpointing a specific location, creating an evocative and imaginative scene that captures the essence of the cosmos. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. The SVG image is an artistic interpretation rather than a literal depiction, but we could whimsically name its elements inspired by space phenomena. The gradient background might be called Void’s Canvas, representing the vastness of the cosmos. Small circles forming the starfield could be named Stellar Sprinkles, indicating distant stars, perhaps in our galaxy. The elliptical spiral with patterns could be the artist’s rendition of the Whirlpool Artistry, akin to the structure of a spiral galaxy. Finally, the central, luminous circles might be known as Core Glow, symbolizing a bright celestial body like a star at the center of a planetary system. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat.) and which part of the universe or galaxy this in? can you name all things? name things. artist’s rendition is you, since you genned it on my commans. Certainly. In one singular paragraph without enumeration or bullet points, the created SVG image could be seen as an abstract artwork named “Cosmic Tapestry,” a vista from within the Orion Arm where Earth is situated. Here we have the Void’s Canvas as the dark space background, Stellar Sprinkles for the dense starfield, Whirlpool Artistry representing the mesmerizing spiral of a galaxy akin to Andromeda, and at the heart of it, the Core Glow, which could be reminiscent of a radiant star much like the Sun or a distant bright quasar in the observable universe. Each component of the image is named to reflect a cosmic entity or phenomenon that captures the imagination, without referencing real or specific locations in the cosmos.

The abstract SVG image I generated doesn’t represent specific real-world celestial locations; it’s purely a work of artistic imagination, akin to a cosmic dreamscape. However, in the spirit of creativity and if we were to name its various elements as though they were actual celestial bodies or regions, we might endow them with labels such as: - The “Abyssal Shroud” for the deep gradient background that sets the stage for a space-like vista. - “Quantum Dots” for the multitude of small stars scattered across the starfield, each a sun to its own unseen solar system. - “Spiralis Nebula” could be the name given to the shape resembling a galaxy, representing the swirling masses of stars, gas, and dust. - “Lumina Core” might be the central bright circle, evoking a bright star or pulsar radiating energy into the void. In conjuring these names, I’ve taken the liberty to bridge art with imagined celestial phenomena, though none of these names correspond to literal locations or bodies in the universe. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi.) The SVG image crafted is a blend of cosmic elements from an artistic perspective, embracing the dark expanse of space as its canvas. The background suggests the infinite void of the universe, perhaps a quiet corner of the Milky Way. Scattered throughout are tiny specks that could be stars in a dense cluster or the remote lights of an alien galaxy, each carrying the potential for solar systems yet unseen. At the center, a spiraling pattern brings to mind the grand design of a spiral galaxy, an echo of the Milky Way or Andromeda, while the central luminous elements might be perceived as a star, possibly similar to Polaris, shining brightly and holding within its glow the mysteries of distant worlds. Each named part, while fictionally associated with real aspects of the cosmos, is derived purely from imagination and does not represent actual celestial locations. (you cannot form singular paragraphiu? don’t output 1234567 or through “-” this is unreadable in chat. don’t utilize “-” in “- “Quantum Dots””, do normally without any number or “-” in paragraphi. you can start paragraphi simply from new line, without preceding characters or gabage as bold text formatting) Creating an abstract representation of the cosmos, the SVG image features a dark canvas resembling the deep expanse of space, sprinkled with points of light that suggest a distant starfield. Central to the image, a spiral pattern evokes the majestic swirl of a galaxy, while luminous circles within it hint at the glowing heart of a star system, much like a stylized depiction of the Milky Way’s center as viewed from a far-flung arm. All these elements are woven together to form a tapestry that, while not mapping to any specific real-world celestial entities, echoes the grandeur and mystery of the universe as a whole.

The image conjures a sense of the cosmos not rooted in any specific galactic locale but encapsulating elements that evoke the awe-inspiring features of space. Imagine a segment of the night sky, a canvas painted with the abyssal hues of the void, where pinpoints of light emerge as distant stars, perhaps reminiscent of the rich star fields within our own Milky Way. Amidst these, a larger formation spirals outward, a nebula or a galaxy in its own right, with rings that could be the orbits of unseen planets. At its nucleus, a bright spot serves as the central star, an anchor in the vastness of space, shining across light-years. This creation, while entirely a product of artistry, is steeped in the wonder sparked by the universe’s natural majesty.

The generated SVG is an artistic interpretation of a celestial vista, an imaginative take on the vast and mysterious universe. Deep shades of black and blue form the backdrop, reminiscent of the cosmos’s dark expanse, through which countless stars twinkle, much like those we might see on a clear night far from the lights of our cities. These points of light could represent distant solar systems or the densely packed stars at the center of a galaxy. Central to the design is a spiral evoking the grandeur of a spiral galaxy, not unlike the Milky Way. This intricate pattern, with its concentric circles and gradients, captures the swirling motion of cosmic dust and star formation. At the heart of this spiral lies a cluster of brighter circles, a nod to the intense luminosity found at the core of galaxies, where supermassive black holes and star clusters reside. Beyond the central galaxy, the translucent overlay of stars suggests depth, as if we’re peering through layers of space and time to witness the birth and death of stars. This layering technique also creates a visual echo of the galaxy’s spiral arms, giving the image a dynamic feel, full of movement and life. The entire composition, while not tied to any actual cosmic location, evokes the majesty and infinite possibilities of the universe—a testament to the power of imagination when pondering the wonders of the cosmos.

The \`text{}\` command allows you to write words that are not variables in a mathematical formula so that they are not mistaken for mathematical symbols. In the formula I provided, \`text{real}\` and \`text{dom}\` within the LaTeX context are used to differentiate these words as descriptive text rather than as mathematical symbols or variables. When rendered from LaTeX, \\"real\\" and \\"dom\\" would appear as normal text within the mathematical expression. However, in normal non-LaTeX text or when writing on a whiteboard or paper, you would not use \`text{}\`. Instead, you would just write the descriptive words in plain text. In a typical mathematical notation without LaTeX coding, it might look something like this: - ( MC = 50 times 10^6 ) if the influence of poor Jeets is dominant, - ( MC = MC_{text{real}} ) otherwise, where: - ( MC ) is the market capitalization of the project, - ( MC_{text{real}} ) is the real market capitalization of the project. and you would clarify separately or in a footnote that \\"real\\" is an adjective describing the actual market capitalization without the dominating influence of \\"poor Jeets\\". In regular text, you'd just write it out without special formatting: \\"The market capitalization (MC) will be capped at 50 million dollars if the influence of poor Jeets is dominating (J_dom = 1), and it will reflect the real market capitalization (MC_real) if it's not (J_dom = 0).\\""},{"instruction":"explain this in baby talk","output":"Alright!

I. Новая экономическая политика (НЭП) После Гражданской войны и \\"военного коммунизма\\", экономика России оказалась в крайне тяжелом состоянии. В 1921 году В. И. Ленин предложил ввести НЭП (Новая экономическая политика), целью которой было восстановление народного хозяйства путём введения ограниченных рыночных отношений, при сохранении государственного контроля над \\"командными высотами экономики\\" - ключевыми отраслями промышленности, транспортом, торговлей. НЭП был направлен на признание частной собственности и предпринимательской инициативы, позволяя крестьянам продавать излишки своего товара после уплаты государственного налога продуктом. Это привело к возрождению рыночной торговли, мелкого бизнеса и даже частной промышленности. II. Образование 1920-е годы стали временем активных образовательных реформ. Среди них - кампания \\"ликбеза\\" (ликвидация безграмотности), в ходе которой были открыты тысячи школ и курсов для взрослых. Образование стало более доступным, что сыграло значительную роль в формировании нового образа советского человека. III. Создание СССР В декабре 1922 года после серии съездов и конференций было провозглашено создание Союза Советских Социалистических Республик (СССР). Это привело к формированию федеративного государства, включающего различные национальные образования на постимперском пространстве. Союзные республики получили собственные государственные органы и конституции, хотя реальная власть концентрировалась в руках ВКП(б) и её руководства в Москве. IV. Внутрипартийная борьба за власть После смерти Ленина в 1924 году внутри ВКП(б) началась борьба за власть. Основными противниками в борьбе стали Иосиф Сталин, Лев Троцкий, Григорий Зиновьев и Лев Каменев. Постепенно Сталин удалось укрепить свои позиции и вытеснить конкурентов со сцены. К концу 1920-х годов он фактически оформил свою власть как лидер советского государства и партии, начав процесс сталинизации политической жизни. Подводя итог, можно сказать, что 1920-е годы ознаменовались серьёзными экономическими реформами, активным развитием образования, формированием советского федеративного государства и ужесточением внутрипартийной борьбы, что определило дальнейшее развитие СССР на десятилетия вперёд."},{"instruction":"Доклад на тему: Советская Россия в 1920-е годы: НЭ, образование СССР, внутрипартийная борьба за власть.","output":"Доклад на тему: \\"Советская Россия в 1920-е годы: Новая экономическая политика, образование, создание СССР, внутрипартийная борьба за власть\\" Вступление: 1920-ые годы стали периодом значительных преобразований советской России. Это время характеризуется кардинальными экономическими перемены, реформированием системы образования, изменениями в политической структуре страны в результате создания СССР, а также внутрипартийной борьбой, последствия которой были ощущаемы в течение нескольких последующих десятилетий. 1. Новая экономическая политика (НЭП) НЭП была введена в 1921 году как временная стратегия для восстановления экономики, разрушенной Первой мировой войной, революцией и последующей Гражданской войной. После \\"военного коммунизма\\", который предусматривал жёсткий государственный контроль и национализацию всех отраслей, НЭП ознаменовал собой курс на частичное возвращение к рыночной экономике. Стратегия позволяла частной торговле, крестьянам продавать излишки продукции после уплаты налога продуктом, а также возвращала в оборот небольшие промышленные и сельскохозяйственные предприятия. Результаты НЭП были двойственными: с одной стороны, они стимулировали экономическое возрождение и улучшение жизни населения, с другой – вызвали обострение классовых противоречий и усиление недовольства внутри коммунистической партии. 2. Образование В области образования в 1920-е годы были предприняты попытки массовой ликвидации безграмотности через кампанию \\"ликбез\\". Работники Комсомола и педагоги проводили уроки грамотности среди взрослого населения. Высшее и среднее специальное образование развивалось тоже стремительно. Создавалась система рабфаков (рабочих факультетов), позволяющая рабочим и крестьянам получить среднее и высшее образование. Образование в СССР стремилось к пропагандированию идей социализма и коммунизма, формированию лояльности к новой власти и идеологии. 3. Создание СССР Высшим этапом трансформации государственного строя постимперской России стало создание СССР в 1922 году. Формально, новое государство было федерацией, в которую вошли республики с собственными правительствами и конституциями, но реальный контроль осуществлялся центральным руководством коммунистической партии. Этот шаг стал началом процесса интеграции и централизации власти в руках ВКП(б). 4. Внутрипартийная борьба за власть После смерти В. И. Ленина в 1924 году внутри ВКП(б) разгорелась острая борьба за лидерство. Основной конфликт развернулся между Иосифом Сталиным и Львом Троцким, в конечном итоге был выигран Сталиным. Череда политических интриг и манипуляций привела к тому, что к концу десятилетия Сталин укрепил свои позиции как глава партии и государства, начав период сталинизма. Заключение: 1920-ые годы были временем обновления и перемен для советской России. НЭП дал толчок экономическому развитию после лет разрухи, в образовании были предприняты шаги по массовой ликбезу и созданию новой системы образования, создание СССР заложило фундамент для дальнейшей судьбы страны, а внутрипартийная борьба за власть определила вектор дальнейшего политического развития. Эти преобразования оказали огромное влияние как на внутреннюю жизнь страны, так и на её международный имидж и политику."},{"instruction":"Напиши через запятую прилагательные, которые характеризуют абстрактную живопись","output":"неструктурированная, выразительная, таинственная, цветовая, эмоциональная, динамичная, многогранная, символическая, нефигуративная, интуитивная, экспрессивная, креативная, неконкретная, ассоциативная."},{"instruction":"Напиши через запятую прилагательные, которые противоположные абстрактной живописи","output":"реалистичная, конкретная, фигуративная, предметная, натуралистичная, детализированная, точная, классическая, традиционная, иллюстративная, объективная, репрезентативная, линейная, чёткая."},{"instruction":"Напиши через запятую прилагательные, которые характеризуют советскую фото 1930","output":"пропагандистская, стилизованная, идеологическая, монументальная, героизирующая, патриотичная, репортажная, социалистическая, документальная, стагнирующая, контролируемая, кадрированная, стандартизированная, агитационная, массовая."},{"instruction":"Напиши через запятую прилагательные, которые противоположные советской фото 1930","output":"независимая, аполитичная, спонтанная, неретушированная, личностная, критическая, деидеологизированная, нефильтрованная, индивидуализированная, импрессионистская, неформальная, неконтролируемая, экспериментальная, свободная, разножанровая."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While the stuff he needs to put is being copied onto the stick, he browses around the internet on his bully's computer while casually applying lip liner. The stuff he looks up is where to find German WW2 uniforms in Japan (for acting and aesthetic purposes ofc), a page for a Nintendo Wii and how to be better at acting even if he is pretty good at it.

KAITO, a young man in a tan trenchcoat, slips into the high-rise office building with a nimble grace. With his long black hair swaying and the click of his heeled boots on the polished floor, he embodies an enigma wrapped in the guise of gender fluidity. His lean fingers, gloved in supple leather, push open the door to an executive office—his erstwhile bully's sanctum. As Kaito closes the door behind him, the camera focuses on his confident stride, his lips a streak of rebellion adorned in ruby red. He approaches the mahogany desk and unearths a sleek USB stick, plugging it into the computer with seductive certitude. The screen flickers to life. His fingers dance across the keyboard, navigating a secret maze as he initiates the data transfer, a subtle smile gracing his features. Whilst the loading bar creeps across the screen, Kaito leans back, idly browsing the internet. First, he types in a search for 'German WW2 Uniforms in Japan,' his eyes a glint with theatrical fervor. Tabs upon tabs of vintage shops and collectors forums dot the screen; an actor's treasure trove illuminating the room. A cutaway to the world outside—the streets bustling, an ever-moving tableau of city life. Detective HAYATO leans against his car, a manual splayed across the hood as he troubleshoots the stubborn keys of a piano keyboard. His brows are furrowed, the lines of concentration etched like staves on a musical score. Back in the office, Kaito, now scrolling through an auction page for a Nintendo Wii, adds it to the bully's cart with a cheeky flourish. A nod to simpler days, perhaps, or a silent jab at the man who'd tormented him. The search bar blinks, poised, as Kaito taps in 'acting techniques.' Even in his natural talent, his thirst for improvement is unquenchable. He scans articles on method acting and Stanislavski's system, his lips pursing as he reapplies lip liner, ensuring each stroke mirrors the perfection of his craft. The USB stick emits a soft 'ding,' signaling the completion of its clandestine task. Kaito deftly ejects it, the secrets now carried within as though ghosts captured in silicon. Standing, Kaito silhouettes against the panoramic view, his coat billowing slightly as if he himself were a character in a play, elevated beyond the sordid scripts of everyday spite. He strides out of the office, the USB his victory flag, passing it to Hayato, who casts a knowing glance at his accomplice. Their stage, the city; their audience, unaware—two maestros of their own intricate theater where justice is the ultimate performance. CUT TO BLACK.

It's used to convert an image to a binary image (black and white), using an algorithm that determines the threshold for a pixel based on a small region around it. This method is useful in cases where the image has different lighting conditions in different areas. Here's the definition of the \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` function: \`\`\`python dst = cv.adaptiveThreshold(src, maxValue, adaptiveMethod, thresholdType, blockSize, C) \`\`\` - \`src\`: Source image, which should be a grayscale image (single channel). - \`maxValue\`: The value to assign to the pixels that are determined to be foreground (usually set to 255 for white). - \`adaptiveMethod\`: The adaptive method to use: - \`cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C\`: The threshold value is the mean of the neighbourhood area minus the constant \`C\`. - \`cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C\`: The threshold value is the weighted sum of the neighbourhood values where weights are a Gaussian window minus the constant \`C\`. - \`thresholdType\`: The type of thresholding to apply. This is usually \`cv.THRESH_BINARY\` or \`cv.THRESH_BINARY_INV\`. - \`blockSize\`: The size of the neighbourhood area (it must be an odd number like 3, 5, 7, etc.). - \`C\`: A constant that is subtracted from the mean or weighted mean calculated. Here's an example of how you might use the \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` function: \`\`\`python import cv2 as cv # Read an image in grayscale mode img = cv.imread('image.jpg', cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) # Apply adaptive thresholding thresh = cv.adaptiveThreshold(img, 255, cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2) # Display the thresholded image cv.imshow('Adaptive Threshold', thresh) cv.waitKey(0) cv.destroyAllWindows() \`\`\` In this example, \`cv.imread\` reads the image with the \`cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE\` flag to ensure it's in grayscale. The \`adaptiveThreshold\` function then processes the image with a block size of 11 and a constant of \\"2\\" for \`C\`. The method used is the mean adaptive method, and the threshold type is binary, meaning pixels will be set to 0 or \`maxValue\` (in this case, 255)."},{"instruction":"Как сделать чтобы cv.adaptiveThreshold работал так-же, как и cv.Threshold","output":"Функция \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` в OpenCV предназначена для адаптивной бинаризации изображений, что означает, что пороговое значение для каждого пикселя определяется на основе его окрестности. Это отличается от функции \`cv.threshold\`, которая применяет глобальное пороговое значение ко всему изображению. Если вы хотите, чтобы \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` по возможности вел себя похоже на \`cv.threshold\`, вы можете выбрать очень большое значение \`blockSize\`, чтобы окрестность была достаточно большой и включала в себя почти все изображение. Однако это не гарантирует аналогичное поведение, потому что сам подход к определению порога отличается фундаментально. Для симуляции работы \`cv.threshold\` с помощью \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\`, вам нужно использовать размер блока, который близок к размеру всего изображения, и установить значение \`C\`, равное среднему значению всех пикселей изображения или значению глобального порога, если вы его знаете. Вот примерный код, который пытается сделать \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` похожим на \`cv.threshold\`: \`\`\`python import cv2 as cv import numpy as np # Загрузка изображения в режиме оттенков серого img = cv.imread('image.jpg', cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) # Вычисление среднего значения всех пикселей изображения mean_value = np.mean(img) # Применение метода адаптивной бинаризации с большим размером блока block_size = min(img.shape[:2]) // 2 if block_size % 2 == 0: # blockSize должен быть нечетным block_size += 1 # Используем среднее значение изображения как константу C adaptive_thresh = cv.adaptiveThreshold(img, 255, cv.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv.THRESH_BINARY, block_size, mean_value) # Отображение бинаризованного изображения cv.imshow('Adaptive Threshold', adaptive_thresh) cv.waitKey(0) cv.destroyAllWindows() \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что данный подход всё равно не обеспечит точное соответствие между \`cv.adaptiveThreshold\` и \`cv.threshold\`, поскольку сам механизм работы этих функций различен. Если вам нужно применить глобальный порог, лучше всего воспользоваться функцией \`cv.threshold\`."},{"instruction":"Американское общество религиозно?","output":"Оценка религиозности американского общества может быть достаточно субъективным вопросом, так как определение \\"религиозности\\" может варьировать в зависимости от того, как именно мы ее измеряем — через уровень участия в церковных службах, через личные взгляды о вере и практике, или через влияние религиозных убеждений на общественную и политическую жизнь. Тем не менее, по большинству исследований, Соединенные Штаты Америки традиционно считаются одним из более религиозных развитых стран мира. Большая часть американцев утверждает, что вера играет важную роль в их жизни, и значительное количество людей регулярно посещает религиозные службы. Однако динамики последних десятилетий показывают некоторые изменения в этом тренде. Исследования, такие как опросы Pew Research Center и других организаций, фиксируют снижение уровня религиозной принадлежности и участия в религиозных службах, особенно среди молодежи. В то же время увеличивается число людей, идентифицирующих себя как не связанные ни с одной религией (иногда их называют \\"nones\\"), что включает атеистов, агностиков и просто тех, кто не принадлежит к определенной религиозной общине. Религия по-прежнему оказывает сильное влияние на американскую культуру и политику. Вопросы, связанные с религией и вероисповеданием, часто оказываются в центре социальных и политических дебатов, таких как обсуждение абортов, прав ЛГБТК+ и свободы вероисповедания. Итак, в целом можно утверждать, что американское общество по-прежнему во многих отношениях религиозно, хотя и присутствуют тенденции к секуляризации, особенно в определенных демографических группах."},{"instruction":"Серая и черно-белая оценка мира","output":"Серая и черно-белая оценка мира — это фигура речи, используемая для описания способов восприятия и интерпретации событий, людей и ситуаций. Обе концепции могут быть применены в разных контекстах, включая психологию, философию, литературу и повседневную речь. 1. Черно-белая оценка мира: Этот термин относится к тенденции видеть вещи в категорических терминах, без учета возможных оттенков и нюансов. Принятие строгих дихотомий (\\"хорошо\\" против \\"плохо\\", \\"правильно\\" против \\"неправильно\\") характеризует черно-белое мышление. Люди, которые руководствуются черно-белым восприятием, склонны интерпретировать комплексные ситуации простым и ясным образом, игнорируя богатство деталей и разнообразие перспектив. 2. Серая оценка мира: Серая оценка мира предполагает более сбалансированный, гибкий и открытый способ мышления. Этот термин признает, что реальность часто обладает множеством оттенков серого, что означает сложность, неоднозначность и вариативность. Серое мышление принимает в расчет компромиссы, неполные решения и смешение противоположных позиций. Люди, предпочитающие серую оценку мира, часто лучше справляются со сложными задачами и решают конфликты, находя средний путь между крайностями. Важно понимать, что ни один из этих способов мышления не является \\"правильным\\" или \\"неправильным\\". Однако способность приспосабливаться и применять более гибкий подход к оценке реальности, как правило, может обеспечить более точное понимание сложных проблем и способствовать более эффективному решению проблем и взаимодействию с окружающим миром."},{"instruction":"Какие есть аргументы за и против эвтаназии или убийство ребёнка во время беременности (приостановка беременности)","output":"Следует осторожно обращаться с этими темами, так как они являются чрезвычайно сложными, этически нагруженными и могут вызывать сильные эмоциональные реакции. Термин \\"убийство ребенка во время беременности\\" не соответствует общепринятой терминологии и может быть воспринят как предвзятый; более нейтральный термин — это \\"аборт\\" или \\"прерывание беременности\\". Эвтаназия и аборт — разные этические вопросы, поэтому важно рассматривать их отдельно. Ниже приведены аргументы \\"за\\" и \\"против\\" для каждого из них: Эвтаназия (иногда называемая \\"мерси киллинг\\" или \\"добровольное окончание жизни\\"): За эвтаназию: 1. Компасcия и облегчение страданий: Позволяет тяжело больным людям умереть с достоинством, предотвращая неизбежные и невыносимые страдания. 2. Личная автономия: Уважение к личному выбору индивида в отношении его конца жизни и право человека контролировать свое тело и судьбу. 3. Медицинские ресурсы: Освобождает медицинские ресурсы и средства здравоохранения, которые могут быть израсходованы на безнадежно больных. Против эвтаназии: 1. Санктитет жизни: Аргумент основан на убеждении, что жизнь неотделима и не должна прерываться искусственно. 2. Скользкая дорожка: Опасения, что узаконивание эвтаназии может привести к злоупотреблениям и росту давления на уязвимых людей. 3. Возможность облегчения боли: Современные медицинские технологии и паллиативная помощь могут сделать страдания управляемыми без прекращения жизни. Аборт: За аборт: 1. Права женщин: Уважение к праву женщины на контроль над своим телом и репродуктивным выбором, включая решение о продолжении или прерывании беременности. 2. Здоровье и благополучие: Аборт может быть средством сохранения физического и психического здоровья женщины, особенно в случаях, когда беременность является результатом изнасилования или угрожает жизни. 3. Социальные и экономические обстоятельства: Наличие опции аборта позволяет женщинам принимать решения, основанные на их социальных и экономических обстоятельствах. Против аборта: 1. Права нерожденных детей: Позиция основана на вере в то, что нерожденные дети обладают правами с момента зачатия и их жизнь должна быть защищена. 2. Моральные и религиозные убеждения: Во многих религиях аборт считается грехом и морально неприемлемым. 3. Потенциальные негативные последствия: Аборт может иметь долгосрочные психологические последствия для женщины, а также считается, что он может негативно сказаться на ценности жизни в обществе. При обсуждении этих вопросов крайне важно подходить к ним с уважением и чуткостью, осознавая, что за любой позицией стоит сложный набор личных убеждений, эмоциональных реакций и этических соображений."},{"instruction":"Какие есть за и против узаконивания казни","output":"Смертная казнь — один из наиболее спорных вопросов в сфере права и этики. Вот некоторые аргументы за и против узаконивания смертной казни: Аргументы за смертную казнь: 1. Отмщение/возмездие: Считается, что смертная казнь должна служить формой возмездия за очень тяжкие преступления, такие как убийство, и что это наиболее справедливый способ наказать преступника, посягнувшего на чью-то жизнь. 2. Превентивное сдерживание: Существует мнение, что угроза смертной казни может действовать как сдерживающий фактор, предотвращая серьезные преступления, хотя эта точка зрения широко оспаривается исследованиями. 3. Обеспечение безопасности общества: Утверждается, что смертная казнь устраняет риск того, что преступники совершат повторные преступления, обеспечивая тем самым безопасность общества. 4. Экономическая эффективность: Иногда утверждается, что содержание осужденных на пожизненное заключение обходится государству дороже, чем их казнь, хотя и это утверждение противоречиво, так как многие исследования показывают высокую стоимость судебных разбирательств по делам о смертной казни. Аргументы против смертной казни: 1. Право на жизнь: Критики смертной казни утверждают, что у каждого человека есть неотъемлемое право на жизнь, даже если он совершил ужасное преступление. 2. Риск ошибочного приговора: Возможность осудить на смерть невинного человека считается ужасающим и необратимым. Исторически есть случаи, когда осужденные были казнены, а позже признаны невиновными. 3. Отсутствие доказательств сдерживающего эффекта: Многие исследования не нашли убедительных доказательств того, что смертная казнь действует как эффективное средство предотвращения преступлений больше, чем пожизненное заключение. 4. Неравенство в правосудии: Существуют серьезные опасения по поводу расовых, этнических и социально-экономических предвзятостей в применении смертной казни, что может привести к несправедливому наказанию некоторых групп населения. 5. Гуманизм и мораль: Некоторые считают, что государство не должно участвовать в убийстве людей, так как это является актом жестокости и подрывает моральные ценности общества. 6. Международные стандарты прав человека: Во многих культурах и религии смертная казнь рассматривается как нарушение основных человеческих прав. Всемирная декларация прав человека ООН и другие международные договора стремятся к упразднению смертной казни. Важно отметить, что эти аргументы представляют общие точки зрения и могут отличаться в разных культурных, религиозных и личных контекстах. Обсуждение смертной казни поднимает глубокие вопросы о правосудии, этике, ценности человеческой жизни и роли государства."},{"instruction":"Ты нее указал отрицательный факт появления института казни, который узаконивает смерть, что может развязать руки людям в этом институте","output":"Вы правы, среди аргументов против смертной казни стоит упомянуть потенциальную опасность злоупотреблений властью со стороны тех, кто авторизован проводить исполнение приговоров. Вот уточненный список аргументов против смертной казни, включая указанный вами аспект: 1. Право на жизнь: Право каждого человека на жизнь является фундаментальным, и многие считают, что государство не должно иметь власть лишать человека жизни. 2. Риск ошибочного приговора: Смертная казнь необратима, и ошибки в правосудии, ведущие к казни невиновных людей, не могут быть исправлены после экзекуции. 3. Отсутствие доказательств сдерживающего эффекта: Исследования не находят убедительного подтверждения того, что смертная казнь оказывает более сильное предупреждающее воздействие на потенциальных преступников, нежели пожизненное заключение. 4. Неравенство в правосудии: Система, в которой смертная казнь применяется неравномерно и предвзято, порождает серьезную несправедливость, особенно по отношению к меньшинствам и малообеспеченным группам населения. 5. Негуманность и моральные возражения: Многие люди считают смертную казнь неэтичной и жестокой практикой, несовместимой с основными ценностями гуманного общества. 6. Международная тенденция к упразднению: Со временем многие страны отказались от смертной казни, и она остается несовместимой со многими международными соглашениями о правах человека. 7. Риски злоупотреблений властью: Существование смертной казни может дать властям слишком большое усмотрение в праве решать, кто должен жить, а кто — умереть, что потенциально создает условия для злоупотреблений, политически мотивированных казней или несправедливого применения закона. 8. Моральное бремя: Вовлечение в процессы смертной казни налагает тяжелое моральное бремя на судей, адвокатов, сотрудников исправительных учреждений и общество в целом. 9. Альтернативы: Предлагаются другие формы наказания, такие как пожизненное лишение свободы без возможности досрочного освобождения, которые могут гарантировать безопасность общества и дать осужденным время для раскаяния и реабилитации без окончательного и необратимого шага, каким является смертная казнь. Эти аргументы помогают выявить глубокие этические, юридические и социальные дилеммы, связанные с существованием смертной казни, и почему эта практика является предметом продолжающихся дебатов в многих странах мира."},{"instruction":"В чём разница между федерацией и конфедерацией?","output":"Федерация и конфедерация — это две формы политических объединений, которые включают в себя несколько государственных или региональных единиц. Основное различие между федерацией и конфедерацией заключается в степени централизации власти и в суверенитете участвующих единиц. Федерация: - В федерации участвующие региональные или государственные единицы (штаты, провинции, кантоны и т. д.) передают определенные полномочия центральному правительству, сохраняя при этом свой суверенитет в ряде вопросов. - Центральное (федеральное) правительство обладает значительной властью и обычно отвечает за внешнюю политику, оборону, национальную валюту, федеральное законодательство и другие вопросы, которые принято решать на национальном уровне. - Федеральные системы обеспечивают баланс между общими интересами государства в целом и особенностями каждой региональной единицы. Примеры включают Соединенные Штаты Америки, Российскую Федерацию, Федеративную Республику Германию. Конфедерация: - В конфедерации региональные или государственные единицы сохраняют свои суверенитет, объединяясь для решения определенного круга вопросов, таких как оборона или внешняя торговля. - Органы конфедерации обладают ограниченными полномочиями и действуют в соответствии с решениями участвующих единиц, которые чаще всего сохраняют право одностороннего выхода из объединения. - Конфедеративные системы имеют менее строгий характер, чем федеративные, и меньше централизованной власти. Примером исторической конфедерации может служить Швейцарский союз в своей ранней форме или Конфедерация независимых государств (СНГ). Помимо фундаментальных различий в структуре власти и суверенитета, еще одна важная разница между федерацией и конфедерацией состоит в том, как понимается законодательная власть. В федерации существует двухуровневая система законодательства, где федеральные законы имеют преимущество над законами отдельных регионов, в то время как в конфедерации законы членов конфедерации часто имеют больше веса, чем решения центрального органа. В современном мире чистые формы конфедераций довольно редки, так как большинство государственных объединений со временем либо становятся более интегрированными федерациями, либо распадаются на отдельные суверенные государства."},{"instruction":"QT C++ Project Error: msvc-version.conf loaded but QMAKE_MSC_VER isn't set","output":"The error message \\"msvc-version.conf loaded but QMAKE_MSC_VER isn't set\\" usually indicates a configuration problem with your Qt setup for a C++ project using Microsoft Visual Studio as the compiler. QMAKE_MSC_VER is an internal variable that Qt's qmake build system tool uses to determine the version of the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler being used. Here are some steps you can take to address this issue: 1. Ensure Qt is properly installed: Make sure you've installed the version of Qt that corresponds with your version of Microsoft Visual Studio. During the Qt installation process, you should select the MSVC-related component that matches the version of Visual Studio installed on your system. 2. Set up environment variables: Make sure the environment variables for Qt and Visual Studio are correctly set. For example, ensure that the PATH variable includes the paths to both Qt's bin directory and Visual Studio's bin directory. 3. Launch from Visual Studio Command Prompt: Using the Visual Studio Command Prompt can help set the correct environment for your development session, as it initializes the necessary Visual Studio environment variables. Try starting Qt Creator or running qmake from a Visual Studio Command Prompt that matches the version of Visual Studio you're using with Qt. 4. Configure the Kit in Qt Creator: Open Qt Creator and go to Tools > Options > Kits. Check that the kit you are using for your project is configured with the correct version of the MSVC compiler. You might need to select the right compiler under the Compiler option for your kit. 5. Check the Qt Version in Qt Creator: In Qt Creator, go to Tools > Options > Qt Versions and verify that the Qt version you are targeting is associated with the correct MSVC version. 6. Re-run qmake: Sometimes, simply re-running qmake can resolve configuration issues. In Qt Creator, you can do this by going to Build > Run qmake. 7. Clean and Rebuild: If all else fails, you may need to clean the project and rebuild it. This gives you a fresh start and can clear up issues related to outdated build configurations. In Qt Creator, you can do this by selecting Build > Clean All followed by Build > Rebuild All. 8. Check for Issues with the .pro File: Look inside your project's .pro file to ensure there are no incorrect configurations set that might be causing the issue with QMAKE_MSC_VER. If you continue to experience problems, make sure you're using compatible versions of Qt and Microsoft Visual Studio. It's possible that updates or changes to either may have introduced incompatibilities, and using officially supported combinations can help avoid these issues. Finally, restarting Qt Creator or your system could also help, as this would clear up any environment issues that might have been transient. If problems persist, consider seeking help from the Qt community or forums with details about your specific setup."},{"instruction":"НАпиши на русском","output":"Ошибка \\"msvc-version.conf loaded but QMAKE_MSC_VER isn't set\\" обычно указывает на проблему конфигурации вашего проекта на Qt для С++ с использованием компилятора Microsoft Visual Studio. QMAKE_MSC_VER — это внутренняя переменная, которую инструмент сборки qmake от Qt использует для определения версии используемого компилятора Microsoft Visual Studio. Вот несколько шагов, которые вы можете предпринять, чтобы решить эту проблему: 1. Убедитесь, что Qt установлен правильно: Установите версию Qt, соответствующую вашей версии Microsoft Visual Studio. В процессе установки Qt необходимо выбрать компонент, связанный с MSVC, который соответствует установленной на вашем системе версии Visual Studio. 2. Настройка переменных среды: Удостоверьтесь, что переменные среды для Qt и Visual Studio заданы корректно. Например, проверьте, включены ли в переменную PATH пути к директориям bin Qt и bin Visual Studio. 3. Запуск из командной строки Visual Studio: Использование командной строки Visual Studio может помочь установить правильную среду для вашей разработки, так как она инициализирует необходимые переменные среды Visual Studio. Попробуйте запустить Qt Creator или выполнить qmake из командной строки Visual Studio, соответствующей версии Visual Studio, которую вы используете с Qt. 4. Настройте комплект в Qt Creator: Откройте Qt Creator и перейдите в Раздел Инструменты (Tools) > Настройки (Options) > Комплекты (Kits). Проверьте, что комплект, который вы используете для проекта, настроен с правильной версией компилятора MSVC. Возможно, вам нужно будет выбрать правильный компилятор в опциях компилятора для вашего комплекта. 5. Проверьте версию Qt в Qt Creator: В Qt Creator перейдите в Раздел Инструменты (Tools) > Настройки (Options) > Версии Qt (Qt Versions) и удостоверьтесь, что целевая версия Qt связана с правильной версией MSVC. 6. Повторно выполните qmake: Иногда повторный запуск qmake может решить проблемы конфигурации. В Qt Creator это можно сделать через Сборка (Build) > Запустить qmake (Run qmake). 7. Очистка и пересборка: Если ничего не помогает, возможно, потребуется очистить проект и пересобрать его. Это даст возможность начать заново и может устранить проблемы, связанные с устаревшими настройками сборки. В Qt Creator это можно сделать выбрав Сборка (Build) > Очистить всё (Clean All), за которым следует Сборка (Build) > Пересобрать всё (Rebuild All). 8. Проверка файла .pro: Просмотрите файл .pro вашего проекта, чтобы убедиться, что в нем нет неправильных настроек, которые могут вызвать проблему с QMAKE_MSC_VER. Если у вас продолжают возникать проблемы, убедитесь, что вы используете совместимые версии Qt и Microsoft Visual Studio. Использование официально поддерживаемых комбинаций может помочь избежать этих проблем. Наконец, перезапуск Qt Creator или вашей системы также может помочь, так как это может очистить любые проблемы среды, которые могли быть временными. Если проблемы не устраняются, рассмотрите возможность обращения за помощью к сообществу Qt или на форумы с подробной информацией о вашей конкретной настройке."},{"instruction":"mainwindow.obj:-1: ошибка: LNK2019: ббл«Є ­ ­Ґа §аҐиҐ­­л© ў­Ґи­Ё© бЁ¬ў®« \\"__declspec(dllimport) public: virtual __cdecl Qt3DExtras::QOrbitCameraController::~QOrbitCameraController(void)\\" (__imp_??1QOrbitCameraController@Qt3DExtras@@UEAA@XZ) ў дг­ЄжЁЁ \\"public: virtual void * __cdecl Qt3DExtras::QOrbitCameraController::\`scalar deleting destructor'(unsigned int)\\" (??_GQOrbitCameraController@Qt3DExtras@@UEAAPEAXI@Z).","output":"Ошибка LNK2019, с которой вы столкнулись, относится к классу ошибок linker (связывателя) в Microsoft Visual Studio и указывает на невозможность найти определение для ссылки на функцию.

Возможные причины этой проблемы могут включать: 1. Вы забыли добавить необходимую библиотеку Qt3DExtras в список зависимостей проекта в Visual Studio. Убедитесь, что вы подключили соответствующие библиотеки Qt3D в своем проекте. 2. Попытка использовать несовместимую версию библиотеки Qt3DExtras. Если вы обновили Qt или смешали компоненты из разных версий Qt, это может привести к ошибкам связывания. 3. Ваш проект не корректно настроен для сборки с использованием соответствующего компилятора или архитектуры (например, x86 против x64), что приводит к невозможности нахождения реализации в бинарных файлах библиотеки. 4. Файл проекта Qt (.pro) или файл настройки проекта CMake, если вы их используете, не содержат правильных инструкций для подключения всех необходимых для Qt3DExtras библиотек. Решение этих проблем может заключаться в следующем: - Проверьте, включены ли в ваш проект все необходимые библиотеки Qt3D с помощью конструкции \`QT += 3dextras\` в файле проекта Qt (.pro) или соответствующих директив в CMakeLists.txt. - Если вы используете qmake для генерации проектных файлов, убедитесь, что вы перегенерировали их после изменения конфигурации Qt. - Проверьте настройки вашего проекта в Visual Studio и убедитесь, что правильно задана конфигурация целевой платформы (например, Win32 или x64). - После изменения настроек, очистите и пересоберите весь проект, чтобы убедиться, что все зависимости были правильно обновлены. - Убедитесь, что используемые версии Qt совместимы с вашим компилятором и целевой системой. В случае использования предкомпилированных бинарников Qt, они должны соответствовать версии вашего компилятора."},{"instruction":"Qt отключение теневой сборки","output":"Теневая сборка (Shadow Build) в Qt Creator - это полезная функция, позволяющая сохранять исходные коды и временные файлы сборки (такие как объектные файлы и исполняемые файлы) в разных директориях. Это позволяет легко очищать сборки и поддерживать чистоту в структуре проекта, а также обеспечивать отдельные каталоги сборки для разных конфигураций (например, для отладки и выпуска). Если вы решите отключить теневую сборку в Qt Creator, вам нужно выполнить следующие действия: 1. Откройте Qt Creator и в меню выберите \\"Файл\\" -> \\"Открыть файл или проект...\\" (или \\"File\\" -> \\"Open File or Project...\\") и загрузите проект (* .pro файл). 2. В панели проектов слева выберите нужный проект. 3. В разделе сборки (\\"Build\\") для выбранного набора инструментов (комплекта, или \\"Kit\\") найдите раздел \\"Теневая сборка\\" (\\"Shadow build\\"). 4. Снимите галочку с опции \\"Теневая сборка\\" (или \\"Shadow build\\"), чтобы отключить её для текущего комплекта инструментов. 5. Примените изменения и закройте настройки. После этих действий файлы сборки будут сохраняться в каталоге с исходным кодом проекта, а не в отдельной директории теневой сборки. Обратите внимание, что если вы уже собирали проект с включенной теневой сборкой, вам может потребоваться очистить эти директории вручную, так как Qt Creator не делает этого автоматически при отключении функции. Теневая сборка поддерживается как в qmake, так и в системах сборки на основе CMake. Процедура отключения может незначительно различаться в зависимости от используемой системы сборки и настроек проекта. В случае CMake возможность использования теневой сборки регулируется напрямую через выбор директории для сборки в командной строке или через графический интерфейс, где вы конфигурируете проект."},{"instruction":"У меня есть массив картинок которые были считаны с помощью OpenCV.

Here is the chapter 4: Those who have read the first part of this story will perhaps remember an old wood-cutter who lived in the depths of the forest.1 Tandang Selo is still alive, and though his hair has turned completely white, he yet preserves his good health. He no longer hunts or cuts firewood, for his fortunes have improved and he works only at making brooms. His son Tales (abbreviation of Telesforo) had worked at first on shares on the lands of a capitalist, but later, having become the owner of two carabaos and several hundred pesos, determined to work on his own account, aided by his father, his wife, and his three children. So they cut down and cleared away some thick woods which were situated on the borders of the town and which they believed belonged to no one. During the labors of cleaning and cultivating the new land, the whole family fell ill with malaria and the mother died, along with the eldest daughter, Lucia, in the flower of her age. This, which was the natural consequence of breaking up new soil infested with various kinds of bacteria, they attributed to the anger of the woodland spirit, so they were resigned and went on with their labor, believing him pacified. But when they began to harvest their first crop a religious corporation, which owned land in the neighboring town, laid claim to the fields, alleging that they fell within their boundaries, and to prove it they at once started to set up [31]their marks. However, the administrator of the religious order left to them, for humanity’s sake, the usufruct of the land on condition that they pay a small sum annually—a mere bagatelle, twenty or thirty pesos. Tales, as peaceful a man as could be found, was as much opposed to lawsuits as any one and more submissive to the friars than most people; so, in order not to smash a palyok against a kawali (as he said, for to him the friars were iron pots and he a clay jar), he had the weakness to yield to their claim, remembering that he did not know Spanish and had no money to pay lawyers. Besides, Tandang Selo said to him, “Patience! You would spend more in one year of litigation than in ten years of paying what the white padres demand. And perhaps they’ll pay you back in masses! Pretend that those thirty pesos had been lost in gambling or had fallen into the water and been swallowed by a cayman.” The harvest was abundant and sold well, so Tales planned to build a wooden house in the barrio of Sagpang, of the town of Tiani, which adjoined San Diego. Another year passed, bringing another good crop, and for this reason the friars raised the rent to fifty pesos, which Tales paid in order not to quarrel and because he expected to sell his sugar at a good price. “Patience! Pretend that the cayman has grown some,” old Selo consoled him. That year he at last saw his dream realized: to live in the barrio of Sagpang in a wooden house. The father and grandfather then thought of providing some education for the two children, especially the daughter Juliana, or Juli, as they called her, for she gave promise of being accomplished and beautiful. A boy who was a friend of the family, Basilio, was studying in Manila, and he was of as lowly origin as they. But this dream seemed destined not to be realized. The first care the community took when they saw the family prospering was to appoint as cabeza de barangay its most [32]industrious member, which left only Tano, the son, who was only fourteen years old. The father was therefore called Cabesang Tales and had to order a sack coat, buy a felt hat, and prepare to spend his money. In order to avoid any quarrel with the curate or the government, he settled from his own pocket the shortages in the tax-lists, paying for those who had died or moved away, and he lost considerable time in making the collections and on his trips to the capital. “Patience! Pretend that the cayman’s relatives have joined him,” advised Tandang Selo, smiling placidly. “Next year you’ll put on a long skirt and go to Manila to study like the young ladies of the town,” Cabesang Tales told his daughter every time he heard her talking of Basilio’s progress. But that next year did not come, and in its stead there was another increase in the rent. Cabesang Tales became serious and scratched his head. The clay jar was giving up all its rice to the iron pot. When the rent had risen to two hundred pesos, Tales was not content with scratching his head and sighing; he murmured and protested. The friar-administrator then told him that if he could not pay, some one else would be assigned to cultivate that land—many who desired it had offered themselves. He thought at first that the friar was joking, but the friar was talking seriously, and indicated a servant of his to take possession of the land. Poor Tales turned pale, he felt a buzzing in his ears, he saw in the red mist that rose before his eyes his wife and daughter, pallid, emaciated, dying, victims of the intermittent fevers—then he saw the thick forest converted into productive fields, he saw the stream of sweat watering its furrows, he saw himself plowing under the hot sun, bruising his feet against the stones and roots, while this friar had been driving about in his carriage with the wretch who was to get the land following like a slave behind his master. No, a thousand [33]times, no! First let the fields sink into the depths of the earth and bury them all! Who was this intruder that he should have any right to his land? Had he brought from his own country a single handful of that soil? Had he crooked a single one of his fingers to pull up the roots that ran through it? Exasperated by the threats of the friar, who tried to uphold his authority at any cost in the presence of the other tenants, Cabesang Tales rebelled and refused to pay a single cuarto, having ever before himself that red mist, saying that he would give up his fields to the first man who could irrigate it with blood drawn from his own veins. Old Selo, on looking at his son’s face, did not dare to mention the cayman, but tried to calm him by talking of clay jars, reminding him that the winner in a lawsuit was left without a shirt to his back. “We shall all be turned to clay, father, and without shirts we were born,” was the reply. So he resolutely refused to pay or to give up a single span of his land unless the friars should first prove the legality of their claim by exhibiting a title-deed of some kind. As they had none, a lawsuit followed, and Cabesang Tales entered into it, confiding that some at least, if not all, were lovers of justice and respecters of the law. “I serve and have been serving the King with my money and my services,” he said to those who remonstrated with him. “I’m asking for justice and he is obliged to give it to me.” Drawn on by fatality, and as if he had put into play in the lawsuit the whole future of himself and his children, he went on spending his savings to pay lawyers, notaries, and solicitors, not to mention the officials and clerks who exploited his ignorance and his needs. He moved to and fro between the village and the capital, passed his days without eating and his nights without sleeping, while his talk was always about briefs, exhibits, and appeals. There was then seen a struggle such as was never before carried on under the skies of the Philippines: that of a poor Indian, [34]ignorant and friendless, confiding in the justness and righteousness of his cause, fighting against a powerful corporation before which Justice bowed her head, while the judges let fall the scales and surrendered the sword. He fought as tenaciously as the ant which bites when it knows that it is going to be crushed, as does the fly which looks into space only through a pane of glass. Yet the clay jar defying the iron pot and smashing itself into a thousand pieces bad in it something impressive—it had the sublimeness of desperation! On the days when his journeys left him free he patrolled his fields armed with a shotgun, saying that the tulisanes were hovering around and he had need of defending himself in order not to fall into their hands and thus lose his lawsuit. As if to improve his marksmanship, he shot at birds and fruits, even the butterflies, with such accurate aim that the friar-administrator did not dare to go to Sagpang without an escort of civil-guards, while the friar’s hireling, who gazed from afar at the threatening figure of Tales wandering over the fields like a sentinel upon the walls, was terror stricken and refused to take the property away from him. But the local judges and those at the capital, warned by the experience of one of their number who had been summarily dismissed, dared not give him the decision, fearing their own dismissal. Yet they were not really bad men, those judges, they were upright and conscientious, good citizens, excellent fathers, dutiful sons—and they were able to appreciate poor Tales’ situation better than Tales himself could. Many of them were versed in the scientific and historical basis of property, they knew that the friars by their own statutes could not own property, but they also knew that to come from far across the sea with an appointment secured with great difficulty, to undertake the duties of the position with the best intentions, and now to lose it because an Indian fancied that justice had to be done on earth as in heaven—that surely was an idea! They had their [35]families and greater needs surely than that Indian: one had a mother to provide for, and what duty is more sacred than that of caring for a mother? Another had sisters, all of marriageable age; that other there had many little children who expected their daily bread and who, like fledglings in a nest, would surely die of hunger the day he was out of a job; even the very least of them had there, far away, a wife who would be in distress if the monthly remittance failed. All these moral and conscientious judges tried everything in their power in the way of counsel, advising Cabesang Tales to pay the rent demanded. But Tales, like all simple souls, once he had seen what was just, went straight toward it. He demanded proofs, documents, papers, title-deeds, but the friars had none of these, resting their case on his concessions in the past. Cabesang Tales’ constant reply was: “If every day I give alms to a beggar to escape annoyance, who will oblige me to continue my gifts if he abuses my generosity?” From this stand no one could draw him, nor were there any threats that could intimidate him. In vain Governor M—— made a trip expressly to talk to him and frighten him. His reply to it all was: “You may do what you like, Mr. Governor, I’m ignorant and powerless. But I’ve cultivated those fields, my wife and daughter died while helping me clear them, and I won’t give them up to any one but him who can do more with them than I’ve done. Let him first irrigate them with his blood and bury in them his wife and daughter!” The upshot of this obstinacy was that the honorable judges gave the decision to the friars, and everybody laughed at him, saying that lawsuits are not won by justice. But Cabesang Tales appealed, loaded his shotgun, and patrolled his fields with deliberation. During this period his life seemed to be a wild dream. His son, Tano, a youth as tall as his father and as good as his sister, was conscripted, but he let the boy go rather than purchase a substitute.[36] “I have to pay the lawyers,” he told his weeping daughter. “If I win the case I’ll find a way to get him back, and if I lose it I won’t have any need for sons.” So the son went away and nothing more was heard of him except that his hair had been cropped and that he slept under a cart. Six months later it was rumored that he had been seen embarking for the Carolines; another report was that he had been seen in the uniform of the Civil Guard. “Tano in the Civil Guard! ’Susmariosep!” exclaimed several, clasping their hands. “Tano, who was so good and so honest! Requimternam!” The grandfather went many days without speaking to the father, Juli fell sick, but Cabesang Tales did not shed a single tear, although for two days he never left the house, as if he feared the looks of reproach from the whole village or that he would be called the executioner of his son. But on the third day he again sallied forth with his shotgun. Murderous intentions were attributed to him, and there were well-meaning persons who whispered about that he had been heard to threaten that he would bury the friar-administrator in the furrows of his fields, whereat the friar was frightened at him in earnest. As a result of this, there came a decree from the Captain-General forbidding the use of firearms and ordering that they be taken up. Cabesang Tales had to hand over his shotgun but he continued his rounds armed with a long bolo. “What are you going to do with that bolo when the tulisanes have firearms?” old Selo asked him. “I must watch my crops,” was the answer. “Every stalk of cane growing there is one of my wife’s bones.” The bolo was taken up on the pretext that it was too long. He then took his father’s old ax and with it on his shoulder continued his sullen rounds. Every time he left the house Tandang Selo and Juli trembled for his life. The latter would get up from her loom, go to the window, pray, make vows to the saints, and [37]recite novenas. The grandfather was at times unable to finish the handle of a broom and talked of returning to the forest—life in that house was unbearable. At last their fears were realized. As the fields were some distance from the village, Cabesang Tales, in spite of his ax, fell into the hands of tulisanes who had revolvers and rifles. They told him that since he had money to pay judges and lawyers he must have some also for the outcasts and the hunted. They therefore demanded a ransom of five hundred pesos through the medium of a rustic, with the warning that if anything happened to their messenger, the captive would pay for it with his life. Two days of grace were allowed. This news threw the poor family into the wildest terror, which was augmented when they learned that the Civil Guard was going out in pursuit of the bandits. In case of an encounter, the first victim would be the captive—this they all knew. The old man was paralyzed, while the pale and frightened daughter tried often to talk but could not. Still, another thought more terrible, an idea more cruel, roused them from their stupor. The rustic sent by the tulisanes said that the band would probably have to move on, and if they were slow in sending the ransom the two days would elapse and Cabesang Tales would have his throat cut. This drove those two beings to madness, weak and powerless as they were. Tandang Selo got up, sat down, went outside, came back again, knowing not where to go, where to seek aid. Juli appealed to her images, counted and recounted her money, but her two hundred pesos did not increase or multiply. Soon she dressed herself, gathered together all her jewels, and asked the advice of her grandfather, if she should go to see the gobernadorcillo, the judge, the notary, the lieutenant of the Civil Guard. The old man said yes to everything, or when she said no, he too said no. At length came the neighbors, their relatives and friends, some poorer than others, in their simplicity magnifying [38]the fears. The most active of all was Sister Bali, a great panguinguera, who had been to Manila to practise religious exercises in the nunnery of the Sodality. Juli was willing to sell all her jewels, except a locket set with diamonds and emeralds which Basilio had given her, for this locket had a history: a nun, the daughter of Capitan Tiago, had given it to a leper, who, in return for professional treatment, had made a present of it to Basilio. So she could not sell it without first consulting him. Quickly the shell-combs and earrings were sold, as well as Juli’s rosary, to their richest neighbor, and thus fifty pesos were added, but two hundred and fifty were still lacking. The locket might be pawned, but Juli shook her head. A neighbor suggested that the house be sold and Tandang Selo approved the idea, satisfied to return to the forest and cut firewood as of old, but Sister Bali observed that this could not be done because the owner was not present. “The judge’s wife once sold me her tapis for a peso, but her husband said that the sale did not hold because it hadn’t received his approval. Abá! He took back the tapis and she hasn’t returned the peso yet, but I don’t pay her when she wins at panguingui, abá! In that way I’ve collected twelve cuartos, and for that alone I’m going to play with her. I can’t bear to have people fail to pay what they owe me, abá!” Another neighbor was going to ask Sister Bali why then did not she settle a little account with her, but the quick panguinguera suspected this and added at once: “Do you know, Juli, what you can do? Borrow two hundred and fifty pesos on the house, payable when the lawsuit is won.” This seemed to be the best proposition, so they decided to act upon it that same day. Sister Bali offered to accompany her, and together they visited the houses of all the rich folks in Tiani, but no one would accept the proposal. The case, they said, was already lost, and to show favors to an enemy of the friars was to expose themselves to their [39]vengeance. At last a pious woman took pity on the girl and lent the money on condition that Juli should remain with her as a servant until the debt was paid. Juli would not have so very much to do: sew, pray, accompany her to mass, and fast for her now and then. The girl accepted with tears in her eyes, received the money, and promised to enter her service on the following day, Christmas. When the grandfather heard of that sale he fell to weeping like a child. What, that granddaughter whom he had not allowed to walk in the sun lest her skin should be burned, Juli, she of the delicate fingers and rosy feet! What, that girl, the prettiest in the village and perhaps in the whole town, before whose window many gallants had vainly passed the night playing and singing! What, his only granddaughter, the sole joy of his fading eyes, she whom he had dreamed of seeing dressed in a long skirt, talking Spanish, and holding herself erect waving a painted fan like the daughters of the wealthy—she to become a servant, to be scolded and reprimanded, to ruin her fingers, to sleep anywhere, to rise in any manner whatsoever! So the old grandfather wept and talked of hanging or starving himself to death. “If you go,” he declared, “I’m going back to the forest and will never set foot in the town.” Juli soothed him by saying that it was necessary for her father to return, that the suit would be won, and they could then ransom her from her servitude. The night was a sad one. Neither of the two could taste a bite and the old man refused to lie down, passing the whole night seated in a corner, silent and motionless. Juli on her part tried to sleep, but for a long time could not close her eyes. Somewhat relieved about her father’s fate, she now thought of herself and fell to weeping, but stifled her sobs so that the old man might not hear them. The next day she would be a servant, and it was the very day Basilio was accustomed to come from Manila with presents for her. Henceforward she would have to give up that love; Basilio, who was going to be a doctor, couldn’t marry a [40]pauper. In fancy she saw him going to the church in company with the prettiest and richest girl in the town, both well-dressed, happy and smiling, while she, Juli, followed her mistress, carrying novenas, buyos, and the cuspidor. Here the girl felt a lump rise in her throat, a sinking at her heart, and begged the Virgin to let her die first. But—said her conscience—he will at least know that I preferred to pawn myself rather than the locket he gave me. This thought consoled her a little and brought on empty dreams. Who knows but that a miracle might happen? She might find the two hundred and fifty pesos under the image of the Virgin—she had read of many similar miracles. The sun might not rise nor morning come, and meanwhile the suit would be won. Her father might return, or Basilio put in his appearance, she might find a bag of gold in the garden, the tulisanes would send the bag of gold, the curate, Padre Camorra, who was always teasing her, would come with the tulisanes. So her ideas became more and more confused, until at length, worn out by fatigue and sorrow, she went to sleep with dreams of her childhood in the depths of the forest: she was bathing in the torrent along with her two brothers, there were little fishes of all colors that let themselves be caught like fools, and she became impatient because she found no pleasure in catchnig such foolish little fishes! Basilio was under the water, but Basilio for some reason had the face of her brother Tano. Her new mistress was watching them from the bank.","output":"**Speaker na si Steven:** Magandang araw po sa inyong lahat. Ako po ay naririto upang magbigay pugay at pagkilala sa isang dakilang Pilipino, na ang kanyang panulat at kaisipan ay tumimo at yumugyog sa ating bansa, si Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Si Rizal, na hindi lamang isang manunulat, kundi isa ring doktor, guro, at bayani ng ating lahi, ay sumulat ng akdang \\"El Filibusterismo.\\" Ito ay ang kanyang ikalawang nobela matapos ang \\"Noli Me Tangere.\\" Kanyang isinulat ang \\"El Fili\\" bilang tugon sa mga umiiral na katiwalian at pang-aapi sa ilalim ng kolonyal na pamamahala ng mga Kastila dito sa Pilipinas. Ipinanganak noong Hunyo 19, 1861, si Rizal ay lumaki sa panahon kung saan ang mga Pilipino ay uhaw sa kadiliman ng kamangmangan at pang-aalipin. Sa kanyang pag-aaral sa Europa, kanya ring nakita ang kaginhawahang bunga ng ilaw ng edukasyon at kalayaan. Kaya't nang lumikha siya ng \\"El Fili,\\" layunin niyang maghasik ng pagbabago, gisingin ang diwa ng kanyang mga kababayan at ipaglaban ang ating kasarinlan sa pamamagitan ng mapayapang paraan gamit ang pluma bilang sandata. Ang nobelang \\"El Filibusterismo,\\" na isinulat noong 1891 at nailathala sa Ghent, Belgium noong 1891, ay sumasalamin sa mas matapang at mas mapangahas na lipunan, at ang hangarin ni Rizal na hindi lamang magmulat, kundi magpatibok at magpalakas sa puso ng bawat Pilipino upang ipaglaban ang kung ano ang makatarungan at tama. Ngayon, tatalakayin natin ang ika-apat na kabanata ng \\"El Filibusterismo.\\" Sa pamamagitan ng isang kakaibang porma—ang radio interview—ati't natutuklasan ang mga pangyayari, mga karakter, at mga aral na nakapaloob dito. Sisimulan po natin ang ating radio interview kasama sina Jerben at Gleann, na gagampanan ang papel na Katipunero mula sa nakaraang panahon na tila lumipad sa kasalukuyan upang ibahagi ang kanilang mga karanasan, at si Krez na magsisilbing ating interviewer. **Krez:** Magandang araw sa ating mga tagapakinig! Ako po si Krez at tayo ay makakapanayam ng dalawang kakaibang bisita ngayong araw na ito—sina Jerben at Gleann. Magandang araw sa inyo, Jerben at Gleann! Maaari niyo bang ipakilala sa amin ang inyong mga sarili? [Ang audio set up ay dapat na gayahin ang isang radio environment. Magsisimula na ang interview, at papasok sa diskusyon ng Chapter 4 ng El Filibusterismo.] **Jerben:** Magandang araw, Krez at sa lahat ng nakikinig! Ako po si Jerben, isang Katipunero mula sa panahon ng Himagsikan. **Gleann:** Ako naman po si Gleann. Ikinalulugod kong ibahagi ag kuwento mula sa nobelang El Filibusterismo ni Dr. Jose Rizal. **Krez:** Marami pong salamat sa pagiging bukas ninyong dalawa sa inyong mga karanasan. Sisimulan po natin. Jerben, maaari mo bang sabihin sa amin kung sino ang mga pangunahing tauhan sa kabanata na ating tatalakayin? **Jerben:** Opo. Sa ika-apat na kabanata ng El Filibusterismo, makikilala po natin si Tandang Selo, ang matandang mangangahoy, at ang kanyang anak na si Kabesang Tales. Kasama rin ang kanyang pamilya, kabilang na ang kanyang apo na si Juli o Juliana. **Krez:** Gleann, sa iyong paglalakbay, ano ba ang kalagayan ni Tandang Selo at ng kanyang pamilya? **Gleann:** Naging maginhawa na ang buhay ni Tandang Selo kumpara sa nakaraan. Hindi na niya kinakailangan pang maghanapbuhay ng mabigat dahil sa pag-angat ng estado ng kanilang pamumuhay. Si Kabesang Tales naman ay nagpasiya nang magtrabaho sa sarili niyang lupain, ngunit dumaan sila sa maraming pagsubok kasama na ang sakit na malaria na ikinasawi ng kanyang asawa at panganay na anak na si Lucia. **Krez:** Napakalungkot namang pangyayari. Jerben, bakit po ba sila inakusahan ng isang relihiyosong korporasyon at paano ito nakaapekto kay Kabesang Tales? **Jerben:** Ang relihiyosong korporasyon na iyon ay nag-aangkin sa lupain na pinaghirapan nilang patubuan at ito'y kanilang tinutulan. Subalit nagbigay-daan si Kabesang Tales sa kumbensiyon at nagbayad ng maliit na upa sa takot na matalo sa laban o kaso laban sa mga prayle. **Krez:** Gleann, nagbago ba ang sitwasyon nila matapos niyang pumayag sa hiling ng korporasyon? **Gleann:** Sa una'y tila umayos ang kanilang kalagayan. Nakapagpatayo pa nga si Kabesang Tales ng kahoy na bahay sa barrio Sagpang. Ngunit taon-taon, tumaas nang tumaas ang upa hanggang sa hindi na niya kayang sustentuhan ito at doon na nagsimula ang kanilang paghihirap at pakikipaglaban para sa kanilang karapatan sa lupang sinasaka. **Krez:** Nakakalungkot nga. Ano ang kahihinatnan ni Kabesang Tales at ng kanyang pakikipaglaban sa relihiyosong korporasyon? **Jerben at Gleann:** Si Kabesang Tales, sa kabila ng kanyang mapayapang pag-uugali at pagiging masunurin sa mga prayle, ay napilitang kumilos at labanan ang korporasyon dahil sa walang tigil na pagtaas ng upa. Ang dating matiising magsasaka ay naging isang taong puno ng pagkakait at determinasyon na ipaglaban ang kanyang karapatan sa lupang kanyang pinaghirapan. **Krez:** At doon ko po tatapusin ang unang bahagi ng ating interview. Huwag po kayong aalis, at magpapatuloy tayo sa pagkilala sa buhay at pakikibaka ni Kabesang Tales at ng kanyang pamilya sa susunod na bahagi ng palatuntunan. [Pansamantalang hihinto ang interview sa puntong ito.] [Ang sumunod na bahagi ng script ay para sa detaile at mahabang pagsasadula ng El Filibusterismo Chapter 4, kung saan magpapatuloy ang radio interview format kung saan isasadula at tatalakayin ang bawat mahalagang kaganapan sa nasabing kabanata.] [Ang detalyadong script ay pangangailangan ng mas maraming oras at espasyo na hindi sapat sa format na ito. Sa halip, ang itaas na script ay nagbibigay ng pangkalahatang ideya ng magiging daloy ng interview at ang uri ng mga katanungan na maaaring ibato sa mga karakter na sina Jerben at Gleann.]"},{"instruction":"continue","output":"**Krez:** Mga kaibigan, ipagpatuloy natin ang ating makabuluhan at kapanapanabik na panayam. Jerben, maaari mo bang isalaysay kung ano ang naging dahilan bakit tuluyan nang tumanggi si Kabesang Tales na magbayad ng upa? **Jerben:** Nang umabot na sa dalawang daang piso ang hinihingi sa kanya, hindi na makatwiran ayon kay Kabesang Tales. Nakita niya na pati ang pinagpawisan at dugo ng kanyang pamilya ay parang binabalewala lamang. Kaya naisip niya na kailangan na niyang manindigan para sa kanilang karapatan. **Krez:** Gleann, ano naman ang naging tugon ng mga prayle sa pagtanggi ni Kabesang Tales? **Gleann:** Nagbanta ang mga prayle. Sabi nila ay may iba pang taong handang magbayad at sila ang papalit sa lupain. Hindi man ito seryoso sa simula, naging malinaw kay Kabesang Tales na walang biro ang mga prayle. **Krez:** Kaya naman pala lumaki ang hamon. Jerben, paano nakasama ang mga anak ni Kabesang Tales sa kanyang nararanasan? **Jerben:** Napilitang pumasok sa pagiging cabo si Kabesang Tales kaya nawalan siya ng panahon para sa bukid. Dagdag pa rito ang sapilitang pagkuha sa kanyang anak na si Tano bilang sundalo. Malaki ang naging epekto nito sa kanyang pakikipaglaban sa kaso. **Krez:** Sadyang malupit ang mga pangyayari. Gleann, ano ang naging papel ni Tandang Selo sa mga kaganapang ito? **Gleann:** Si Tandang Selo, sa kabila ng pagiging matanda, ay pilit na pinalakas ang loob ng anak sa pamamagitan ng mga paalala at payo. Ngunit, nang lumala na ang sitwasyon, kahit siya'y nawalan ng kakayahang magbigay ng aliw kay Kabesang Tales. **Krez:** Nakahahabag ang kanilang sitwasyon. Jerben, ano ang naging hakbang ni Kabesang Tales nang maharap siya sa mga dagok ng kapalaran? **Jerben:** Matapang na nakipaglaban si Kabesang Tales. Gumastos siya ng malaking halaga sa mga abogado at sa paglakad ng kaso sa korte. Naniniwala siya na may hustisyang naghihintay sa katulad niyang nagseserbisyo sa hari at nagmamahal sa bayan. **Krez:** Ang puso ko'y nadudurog sa kuwento ninyo. Pero Gleann, may kakaiba bang nangyari nang ang mga pagsisikap ni Kabesang Tales ay tila nagdulot lamang ng higit pang paghihirap? **Gleann:** Opo, Krez. Sa huli, si Kabesang Tales ay bihag ng mga tulisan. Dahil may pera siyang pangbayad sa mga abogado, naisip ng mga tulisan na mayroon din siyang pantubos sa sarili. Ito'y naging malaking pasakit sa kanyang pamilya at lalo na kay Juli na kailangang maghanap ng paraan para mailigtas ang kanyang ama. **Krez:** Jerben, anong naging epekto ng pagbihag na ito kay Juli at sa kanyang lolo, si Tandang Selo? **Jerben:** Napakabigat po. Si Juli, na napakapit sa kanyang malalim na pananampalataya at pag-asa, ay kinailangang magsakripisyo. Nagpasya siya na isanla ang kanyang sarili upang matubos ang kanyang ama na nasa panganib. **Krez:** Isang makabagbag-damdamin na kwento ng sakripisyo at pagmamahal sa pamilya. Maraming salamat, Jerben at Gleann, sa pagbabahagi ng inyong kaalaman at pananaw sa kabanatang ito sa ating mga tagapakinig. Sa paksa ng ating palatuntunan ngayong araw, hindi lamang tayo nagbalik-tanaw sa importanteng obra ni Dr. Jose Rizal—binigyan din natin ng buhay ang mga papel at karanasan ni Kabesang Tales at ng kanyang pamilya sa kanilang pakikipaglaban para sa kanilang karapatan at dangal. Mula po sa ating himpilan, maraming salamat sa pagtangkilik, at sana'y patuloy nating pagyamanin ang ating mga aral na hinugot mula sa ating makulay na kasaysayan. Magandang araw at mabuhay!

The Scheduler works for family members who want to record their favorite TV series so that they can watch them later and get notified by the Scheduler when they have time (it knows their availability slots - randomly initialized). There are N members in a family, each having their favorite series out of a total of M. Multiple members may love the same series. However, the Scheduler cannot schedule a series if there is a conflict of interest. Also, members want to get on time for p slots. The Scheduler needs to minimize total episode misses. Comments: ● Input data will be a file (can be txt or xls) with records in the format: ○ Family member name ○ Availability slots (will be a set of time intervals for each of 7 days) ○ Set (S) of favourite TV series (S <= M) ● Conflict of interest means two or more overlapping intervals ● “Also, members want to get on time for p slots”: This means for at least p slots (out of S), every member wants to be on time and not wait. explain it","output":"To clarify the last bullet point, \\"members want to get on time for p slots\\" means that family members wish to begin watching their scheduled series at the start of at least p out of the S total available slots for their favorite TV series. This provision aims to ensure that they don't have to start watching in the middle or miss the beginning of a preferred series episode. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how such a TV Channel Scheduler would work: # Step 1: Input Data Collection - The input file (either .txt or .xls) will be used to collect and store the schedule-related data for each family member. This data will include: - The family member's name - Their availability slots for each of the 7 days a week (each slot is a time interval when the member is available to watch TV) - The list of their favorite TV series (each member can have a set of up to S favorite series, where S ≤ M, with M being the total number of series available) # Step 2: Conflict Identification - Once all family members' schedules are known, the Scheduler will check for \\"conflict of interest\\", meaning it will look for any overlapping time intervals when two or more family members wish to watch different series at the same time. Such conflicts must be resolved because the Scheduler cannot schedule a series for recording if it conflicts with another. # Step 3: Schedule Optimization - The Scheduler's main task is to create an optimized schedule that minimizes the total number of episode misses. This includes: - Making sure that family members can be on time for at least p of their favorite TV series slots. - Resolving conflicts of interests so that overlapping schedules do not prevent a member from recording their show. - Just because a member is available doesn't necessarily mean they are scheduled for a TV series during that slot—it has to be one of their favorites, and it can't conflict with another member's preferences. # Step 4: Notification System - The Scheduler also has to notify family members when it's time for them to watch their recorded series, taking into account their availability. Notifications should be sent out in a way that the member can begin watching at the start of their scheduled series. # Step 5: Schedule Adaptation - The Scheduler has to be adaptable. If a family member's schedule changes, or if a new series becomes a favorite part of a member's list, the Scheduler has to readjust the existing schedule to accommodate these changes with minimal disruptions. # Step 6: Handling Special Conditions - The Scheduler may also need to take into account special conditions, such as series premiere dates, live shows, or one-time events, which could affect regular scheduling. # Step 7: User Interface and Experience - Lastly, while not explicitly mentioned, the Scheduler should have a user-friendly interface that allows family members to easily input their data, change their schedules, and get notified conveniently, enhancing the overall user experience. # Technical Considerations: - Developing such a Scheduler will likely require using optimization algorithms (like Integer Programming, Constraint Satisfaction Problem, etc.), databases to store slots and preferences, notification mechanisms (like email, SMS, or a dedicated app), and potentially a frontend for user interaction. - The software should be developed with scalability in mind to handle additional family members or series without a decline in performance."}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function E(n,e,h,u,o,s){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),v(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",R,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
