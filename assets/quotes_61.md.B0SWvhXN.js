I lived through those times and remember distinctly that it didn’t have half the impact that is attributed to it decades later. New genres come round all the time and most are not remembered as much as punk - but why? Punk bands didn’t have comparatively huge sales** and didn’t have great longevity. Other genres in the early 80s claim that the record business had (again) stagnated and needed to be reinvigorated, which is pretty much what the punks said a few years earlier. I am not sure why punk has retained this aura, possibly because of the look and anti-social behaviour? But I am sure that it was not as important as it’s advocates, and all the documentaries of the time seem to suggest. (Perhaps there could be a Quora question asking if punk was ever as popular as most people today seem to believe, though I’m not quite sure of the wording. ** I heard (I am not stating this as absolute truth but I would not be surprised) that during the punk years in the UK, German middle of the road orchestra leader James Last outsold all the punk bands combined.

However, as of October 28, 1533, France was still eating like Gauls, Celts and other barbarians. Pretty much just boiled vegetables and animals roasted over an open fire. Pretty much what you'd expect to see at a Renaissance Fair, only far less sanitary. On October 28, 1533, King Henry, II of France married Catherine de' Medici of the wealthy Italian Medici family of Florence, Italy. When Catherine de’ Medici moved to Paris to live with her new husband, she brought a virtual armada of ships with her. 2 of the ships just carried her dresses and other clothing. Other ships carried her vast compliment of servants, including her chefs. It was those Italian chefs that taught the French how to cook, because after a dinner at Versailles every French noble and their wealthier patrons all sent their own cooks to the royal palace to learn from Catherine's Italian chefs. So, in another sense, the most influential chefs in France weren't French - they were unknown, unnamed, enremembered Italian chefs."},{"instruction":"What are the best decisions ever made by Apple?","output":"Hiring Jony Ive…nuff said."},{"instruction":"Should I purchase Marrow notes or prepare notes by myself as a secondyear MBBS student?","output":"NEET PG 2019 Rank 715 ALWAYS prepare your own custom notes.

Upon entering the World Between Worlds, Ezra meets Morai, a female convor with spiritual ties to the Daughter on Mortis. She leads Ezra to the duel between Ahsoka and Vader, so that she could be saved. Morai was the one who urged for Ezra to pull Ahsoka out. As for Kanan, here’s why Ezra couldn’t save him. As we know from this episode, Ezra actually really wanted to save Kanan. He tells Ahsoka (after saving her life) that he feels obligated to do so since Kanan saved him. He continues on and states that he believes Kanan sent him there to save him. Ezra was about to put his hand into the portal when Ahsoka abruptly grabs him and tries to reason with him. She says: Ezra, Kanan gave his life so that you could live. If he is taken out of this moment, you all die. Ezra then says: You don’t understand what you’re asking me to do. Ahsoka replies with: Yes, I do. You can’t save your master…. and… I can’t save mine. I’m asking you…. to let go. [Ezra watches Kanan’s sacrifice in the portal and puts his hand down.] [Ahsoka]: I’m sorry Ezra, but you must see. Kanan found the moment when he was needed the most…. and he did what he had to do…. for everyone…. So, as you can see, it wasn’t about whether or not Ezra could’ve saved Kanan. He could’ve totally done so… but instead, he didn’t let his emotions get to him. He accepted the truth. He accepted Kanan’s sacrifice for him, for his family, and for the Rebellion. At this point, there was nothing more Ezra could’ve done. After realizing what Kanan did and the impact of his sacrifice, Ezra officially let his emotions go. He said goodbye one last time…………… Time to cry.😭😭😭"},{"instruction":"Are there any real differences between covert narc discard and classic narc discard?

Why or why not?","output":"No way at all. Though I'm a right wing and BJP supporter, there's no way Arnab goswami is or ever can be more deserving than Ravish Kumar for any journalism award. Though Ravish Kumar is politically biased towards left and I don't like his political bias, his series on job and education crisis was very good and these things must be highlighted into mainstream media and news debates instead of daily debates on useless and communal matters which most of the media houses are doing now.Ravish kumar keeps highlighting government failures and keeps questioning the government on important issues likes jobs, education, infrastructure, law & order which are the basic ethics of journalism. These issues must be highlighted and debated instead of daily debates on communal matters with a bunch of clowns shouting at each other having no debating standards.Though both of them didn't let the person of opposite ideology enough many times, but Ravish kumar's way of presenting the news and organising the debates is far better than Arman's. At least it is not annoying with all that unnecessary shouting as Arnab's.Also, Arnab goswami rarely organise debates and talks about relevant issues like jobs and economy compared to Ravish kumar. Arnab goswami's over nationalism and shouting style made him very popular in beginning, but now is very annoying as hell. I also like Sudhir Chaudhary and his show DNA a lot but he doesn't do debates and much ground level journalism compared to Ravish Kumar. So, considering all these factors, I think Ravish kumar is among the best we have for any kind of journalism related award."},{"instruction":"a video game ever predicted the future?","output":"There a few but I will write my favourite!

Anyone who uses longer words to describe the Federation, or tries to paint it as any more complicated than that, is giving them way too much credit. That said, I wish people would be a little smarter when watching this movie, because its message is not “The Federation is bad.” The message is that violence is bad, period. The film is genius in that it gives the audience zero reliable information to work with. The joke then becomes the audience, who proceed to make assumptions and express which side is “right” or “wrong” … based on nothing but their own biases. Do you believe that the Mormon settlers in the Quarantine Zone fired the first shots? That's nice, but you don't know. Your pretense to absolute knowledge has been noted. Do you believe that the Mormon settlers deserved to die because they settled in “bug territory,” and the bugs were “defending their territory\\"? Congratulations, you're no different from the Federation, who also assume control over territory and punish those who question it. Do you believe the bug meteorite that wiped out Buenos Aires was a false flag, because there's no way it could have traveled across the galaxy so quickly? Well, the Federation warships crossed the galaxy that quickly. Who's to say the “meteorites” — which, mind you, are being shot out of bugs' asses — aren't biomechanical in nature, and equipped with similar technology to the warships'? You can't know, because this is a movie. But your pretense to absolute knowledge has been noted. There are lots of motivations for pretending to have knowledge you don't have. None is good. The popular response to this movie is to presume that, because Federation news is presented in the style that screams “propaganda,” it must be false. But this is just as foolish as viewing “normal\\" news and assuming that it's true because it doesn't look like obvious propaganda. It is warm and comfortable to be able to call the Federation the bad guy in this conflict. Are they evil, period? Yes. They give us more than enough information to know that. Do they deserve to be deleted, like a bad disease? Yep. But are they actually the aggressors in the conflict with the bugs? We can't know. Are they Nazis? If military service were mandatory, they would deserve that title, yes. The fact that Federal military service is not mandatory, however, makes the Nazi comparison much more difficult. In fact, all else considered, that reduces their scariness close to the level of modern, real-world governments — and that's what no one wants to talk about. The Federation steals your freedom upon birth and only gives it back to you if you become a citizen. Sound familiar? That is exactly what modern governments do: “Were you born somewhere else? Jump through our hoops to acquire citizenship, a.k.a. permission to exist here. Do you want to live, produce, trade? You're free to do that, as long as you do it exactly how we say.” We know an awful lot about how real-world governments control people, but most of what we “know\\" about the Federation we don't actually know. We are manipulated into assuming it based on the Riefenstahl style of their newsreels, a style that rings our “Nazi\\" Pavlov bell. The simple fact is that we don't know whether the Federation is significantly worse than modern governments, and that should be what people talk about. But it's easier to say “Federation bad!” because it tells you the comforting story that your brand of government must be better — which is not necessarily true at all."},{"instruction":"What is a good ham radio to get for a beginner?

Some researchers have estimated that more than 60 percent of the brain consists of \\"neural dark matter,\\" or neurons that have no apparent purpose and seem unresponsive to common stimuli. If we take human evolution into accounts, our develop this magnificent ability of reasoning merely 70 thousand years ago. Considering nearly 2.5 million years of human evolution 70k is very very small fraction. That means nearly 2.5 million years we were just like other animals with limited brain capacity & thinking ability. Modern humans sport a brain averaging 1,200–1,400 cubic centimetres. brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. That means even if we are using merely 10-20% of our brain, it consumes 25% of body energy at rest, & encompasses 1200–1400 CC area. For using our 100% of our brain it size also need to expand which will make our head very large, which will be not supported by our rest of body due to inappropriate brain to body proportion. That means even if we are using merely 10-20% of our brain, it consumes 25% of body energy at rest, imagine we started to use 100% of brain power, than we have to provide constant food supply to keep it working otherwise it will just absorb all the energy of body and create condition of death oftenly, because we can't feed our body every seconds of time. 100% brain uses will need so much nutrients, blood supply, oxygen etc that it will create deficit in rest of body & start to absorb as much as it can from rest of body which will eventually kill us. So it's neither good nor possible to use 100% of brain. But let's imagine we have started to use 100% without any side effects or death. Than we will be able to create so many things, our Civilization will become too much advance in terms of Science, religion, psychology and so on. We might be able to develop some alien technologies, like one you have seen in movies etc But still we can't create energy because of universal law that energy neither be created nor be destroyed. So we might not be able to create something like entire separate human universe. So even we start to use 100% brain our options will be limited. No matter how much advanced you became you can never overtake universe or nature.

If that happens, Jon will be the only one left with a dragon. And Dany would find it difficult to challenge Jon's claim without a dragon.","output":"I love this question as much as i despise it. I love it because it is making it clearer abd more obilvious to me that I've been right in a big reason why a lot of people hate Dany. Which is because she had everything their fave needed to fight against the dead. A large ass army, 3 dragons(fire) and dragonglass. I hate this question because in showing me this, it has also shown me that i was right in that people just want Dany to be the means their fave gets what they need and then Dany herself can go f*** off. Now that she has come to the north, one dragon is dead and Jon is riding north, her army is now in formatioj and the battle is about to begin, then all the haters want dany to either ditch the battle effectively dashing her army to jon snow, or to kill some innocent northerner like lyanna or sansa, effectively alienatiolng herslef from the people who believe in her, or for Drogon to die. Leaving her in a position where Jon has the dragon and Dnay has nothing. You see what people don't want to admit is that it is not a coincidence that Dany had all the things needed to fight the dead. You don't give an antagonist all the things required to fight an even bigger bad. That's just not how it works. Dany obtained allbshe did for a reason. Becaslyse she was meant to join with the north and fight the dead. And that in the end means that no she is not an antagonist but a protagonist separate from our other heroes and the only way they could all win is by coming together.

His performances in films like the cult classic Maya Bazaar, Missyamma, Muthyala Muggu, Sankarabaranam and so on remain memorable to fans of cinema. Rama Lingaiah had four children - Allu Aravind, Surekha Konidela, Vasantha Lakshmi, and Nava Bharathi. While Vasantha and Bharathi chose to stay out of the limelight, Allu Aravind became one of Tollywood's most prominent film producers and distributors. He founded Geetha Arts in 1972, a production company which began with small budget films and grew to produce big blockbusters, including the Aamir Khan starrer Ghajini (Hindi). In 1980, Surekha married Konidela Siva Sankara Vara Prasad. For those who don't recognise the name, it belongs to Megastar Chiranjeevi, one of Telugu cinema's biggest superstars. She is the link between the Chiranjeevi and Allu families. Allu Aravind and his wife Nirmala have three children - Venkatesh, Arjun and Sirish. Allu Venkatesh and Allu Arjun made their acting debut in as child artistes in the 1985 film Vijetha, which starred their uncle Chiranjeevi in the lead role and was produced by their father Allu Aravind. While the film was the only one in which Venkatesh acted, Arjun went on to do several more. His younger brother, Allu Sirish, too, acts in south Indian films, his last release being 1971: Beyond Borders with Mohanlal. Chiranjeevi and Surekha also have three children - Ram Charan, Srija, Susmitha. Ram Charan made his acting debut in 2007 and is among the highest paid stars in Tollywood. He has acted in many blockbusters, including SS Rajamouli's Magadheera. Ram Charan also established a production house called Konidela Production Company which produced his father Chiranjeevi's 150th film, Khaidi No.150. His sibling Sushmita Konidela is an accomplished stylist and costume designer. She was behind Chiranjeevi's stylish look in Khaidi No.150 and several other films. The youngest sibling, Srija, gave plenty of fodder for gossip mills when she eloped with her college boyfriend Sirish Bharadwaj in 2007. However, the marriage did not last and the couple got divorced. She married Kalyan, an NRI, last year. Chiranjeevi's brothers, Pawan Kalyan and Nagendra Babu, are also actors. While Nagendra Babu mainly played supporting roles in films and currently appears in TV serials and shows, Pawan Kalyan commands a massive fan following and his followers consider his style and philosophy - dubbed 'Pawanism' - to be almost like a religion! He entered politics in 2014 by founding the Jana Sena Party. Pawan Kalyan has married thrice - to Nandini from 1997 to 2007, to Renu Desai from 2009 to 2012 and to Anna Lezhneva since 2013. He has two children, Akira Nandan Konidela (born 2004) and Aadhya Konidela (born 2010), both with Renu Desai. Renu Desai made her directorial debut with the Marathi film Ishq Wala Love, that was later dubbed in Telugu and her son Akira Nandan Konidela played a cameo role in it. Nagendra Babu, who also owns a production company called Anjana Productions, has two children - Varun Tej Konidela and Niharika Konidela. While the hero of the recently released Fidaa, Varun Tej, is a relatively well-established actor in Tollywood, his sister, Niharika Konidela, is a television anchor and actor. Niharika also owns the production house Pink Elephant Pictures. Akkineni-Daggubati family The Akkineni family came into prominence with the prolific Nageswara Rao (ANR), an actor and producer. He was one of Tollywood's most respected personalities. He was also the recipient of the prestigious Dada Saheb Phalke award and was awarded the Padma Vibushan. In 1975, ANR founded the legendary Annapurna Studios, which was named after his wife. He'd go on to establish the Annapurna International School of Film and Media (AISFM) in 2011, three years before his death. ANR had five children -- Akkineni Nagarjuna, Akkineni Venkat Rathnam, Naga Susheela Akkineni, Saroja Akkineni, and Sathyavathi Akkineni Venkat, who is also a film producer, and Susheela, are directors at Annapurna Studios. Sathyavathi Akkineni would go on to marry film producer Surendra Yarlagadda. Nagarjuna, ANR's most famous son, became a huge star in the Telugu industry, acting in cult films like Siva. He's mostly known for his biographical films, especially Annamayya. In 1984, Nagarjuna married Lakshmi Daggubati, whose surname belongs to one of the most powerful families in Tollywood. The marriage, however, did not last. Nagarjuna and Lakshmi divorced in 1992. Both of them remarried - Nagarjuna to actor Amala and Lakshmi to Sharath Vijay Raghavan, a corporate executive. At the head of the Daggubati family was Padma Bushan recipient Ramanaidu, who founded Suresh Productions. The first film to come out under this banner was in 1964. Ramanaidu was married to Rajeswari and the couple had three children - Lakshmi, Suresh Babu, and Venkatesh. Venkatesh is a well-known actor in the Telugu industry and has had a long and successful career of over three decades. He also holds the distinction of winning the most number of Nandi Awards for Best Actor so far. Suresh Babu is the managing director of Suresh Productions. The third generation of the Akkineni-Daggubati family also features several prominent names. Image Courtesy: Facebook/Akkineni Nagarjuna From the Akkineni family, Nagarjuna's children, Naga Chaitanya (born to Lakshmi Daggubati), and Akhil Akkineni (born to Amala), are both actors. Naga Chaitanya will soon wed actor Samantha Ruth Prabhu. While Akhil has acted in a handful of films, Naga Chaitanya's career has seen its fair share of ups and downs. Satyavathi, Nagarjuna's sister, is married to film producer Surendra Yarlagadda. Their son, Sumanth, is an actor, producer and partner at Annapurna Studios. Their daughter Supriya Yarlagadda is an Executive Director with Annapurna Studios. Naga Susheela, another sister of Nagarjuna's, married Anumolu Sathyabushana Rao, the son of producer AV Subba Rao. Their son, Anumolu Sushanth, is an actor in Tollywood. From the Daggubati family, Suresh Babu's son, Rana Daggubati has made his own name in the industry, particularly with the Baahubali franchise in which he played the antagonist to critical acclaim. Image Courtesy: Facebook/Akkineni Nagarjuna Nandamuri Family Possibly Telugu cinema’s first superstar, NT Rama Rao acted in around 300 films over 33 years, before going on to set up the TDP and then become three-time Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Of all his roles, it was his portrayals of the deities Krishna and Rama in multiple films including in classic hits like Maya Bazaar and Shri Venkateshwara Mahatyam (1960) that created a mass aura around him. While much of his early career was devoted to playing mythological characters, NTR then moved onto playing the role of the heroic common man in films such as Devudu Chesina Manushulu, Driver Ramudu, Sardar Papa Rayudu and so on. In his final film before entering politics, Bobbilli Puli, NTR played an upright officer taking on a corrupt government. NTR’s younger brother Trivikram Rao was also a notable presence in Tollywood in the NTR years and after. He produced over 20 films, including some starring NTR like Justice Chowdhary. Trivikram was also credited with introducing director Puri Jagannath to the industry. With his first wife Basava Tarakam, NTR had eight sons and four daughters. Of these, Nandamuri Balakrishna, popularly known as Balayya, became the most successful on-screen, starring in over 100 movies. Some of his famous hits include Narasimha Naidu, Legend, Simha, Bhairava Dweepam, and Muddula Krishnayya. Despite having entered politics as a TDP MLA, Balakrishna continues a successful acting career, with his 100th film Gautamiputra Satakarni drawing both critical and popular acclaim. NTR’s fourth son, Nandamuri Harikrishna found some success in the film industry as a child artiste in the 1960s and 1970s in films like Shri Krishnavataram and Talla Pellama, and had some film appearances since the 1990s. NTR’s third son Saikrishna, who owned a theatre in Hyderabad, died in 2004 due to complications from diabetes. Two more sons Jayakrishna and Mohanakrishna are cinematographers, while one son Ramakrishna Jr is a film producer. One of NTR’s daughters Bhuvaneswari married N Chandrababu Naidu, who would eventually go onto toppling NTR to gain control of the TDP and become Chief Minister himself. Among the next generation of NTR’s family, Jr NTR, the son of Harikrishna has made the most significant mark on Tollywood. Rated among the top stars of Tollywood, Jr NTR has had a slew of successes such as Aadhi, Simhadri, Student No 1, Janata Garage and Nannaku Prematho. Harikrishna’s other son Kalyan Ram is an actor and producer. He has starred in films such as Athanokkade, Hare Ram, Pataas, and ISM. Kalyan Ram also owns a production house called NTR Arts and a visual effects company called Advitha Creative Studios. Harikrishna’s third son Janakiram was a film producer, but passed away in a road accident in 2014. NTR grandson Tarak Ratna, has been struggling to make his mark in the industry, and is best known for his award-winning negative role in the film Amaravathi. Chandrababu Naidu’s family too bears a connection with the film industry, through Nara Rohit, Naidu’s nephew. The alumnus of the New York Film Academy is an actor and a producer and has appeared in films like Baanam, Solo, Prathinidhi, Rowdy Fellow, Asura, and Jyo Achyutananda."},{"instruction":"What is it like to be morbidly obese (BMI > 40)?","output":"Body Mass Index (BMI) is a tool that medical practitioners and fitness experts use to determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height. It's essentially a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters (kg/m²). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines the following BMI categories for adults: Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9Obesity: BMI is 30 or more Obesity itself is further categorized into three classes: Class 1: BMI of 30 to 34.9Class 2: BMI of 35 to 39.9Class 3: BMI of 40 or more, often referred to as \\"morbidly obese\\" or \\"severely obese\\" Being morbidly obese affects individuals both physically and emotionally. Here's a detailed description: Due to the excessive weight, individuals may find it difficult to move around or perform regular activities. This might lead to a sedentary lifestyle, further worsening their health. Morbid obesity increases the risk of various health issues, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, certain types of cancer, sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis. Studies suggest that morbid obesity can significantly reduce life expectancy due to the associated health risks. Many morbidly obese individuals struggle with self-esteem issues, often due to societal pressure and stereotypes about weight and appearance. These mental health conditions are more prevalent in people who are morbidly obese, partly due to societal prejudice, but also as a result of the physical discomfort and health concerns they may face. Weight stigma is a significant issue in many societies, and it can manifest in many ways, including workplace discrimination, unfair treatment in healthcare settings, and social exclusion. ⛔️⛔️ Bonus tips ⛔️⛔️ Tired of relentless battles against stubborn fat and draining fatigue?

My perspective is a bit strange, actually. I come from a very intelligent family, where an IQ above 130 is the norm in a family of 5. My dad is a hardware architect for a billion-dollar chip manufacturing company, and my mom is a nuclear physicist. When you have a family like this, you actually don't feel smart at all. It wasn't until I began public school that I started to notice. And it was disappointing. People assumed me emotional, and sensitive, but really, I was depressed. I couldn't put it into words as a child, but something felt completely off and I felt totally alienated. Concepts that came naturally to me, and what I thought was common sense in every day life, seemed to be totally ignorant amongst the rest. I remember being in math class, and crying because the kids couldn't understand basic multiplication, and I felt like I was in a world of stupidity. Ive never once felt smart in my life. But I look at everyone else, and wonder, how on earth are you still alive? And without college, it's a struggle. Because nobody wants to believe you're just inherently smart. Nobody wants to believe you could possibly understand something without some figurehead granting you a title that allows you to think a certain way and have good ideas. Until you make it far in business, you'll be frustrated beyond frustrated for your incompetent bosses. You'll watch as your stupid co workers become successful, while you have to just wait for your “dues to be paid\\". It's miserable, until you make it.

Thermal conductivity says how much thermal energy will permeate a material in a unit amount of time, whereas thermal diffusivity says how much area a unit of energy will permeate in a unit amount of time. If not, what am I missing?","output":"The equation defining thermal conductivity is as follows: [math]q = kappa nabla T[/math] This is a simplified form of Fourier’s law of heat conduction which is valid in an isotropic medium. In general the heat conductivity [math]kappa[/math] is described by a tensor. The equation relates the flux of heat [math]q[/math] through some material instantaneously to the gradient of the temperature that exists in the material. Heat has the units of energy and this equation makes it explicitly clear that heat is a flow of energy which occurs in response to a temperature gradient. Flux of anything is the amount crossing through an area perpendicular to the direction of motion, per unit area, per unit time. In this case [math]kappa[/math] is a simple number, a scalar. A given temperature gradient in a material with a higher thermal conductivity will produce a greater flux of heat than the same temperature gradient in a material with a smaller thermal conductivity. This is a simplified description, but I hope it should serve to give the idea. Now, the heat equation, in the theory of heat transfer describes also how the temperature at every point in the material changes with time, and so also how the temperature gradient changes with time and it is commonly written as: [math]frac{partial T}{partial t} =alpha nabla^2 T[/math] This, you have to note first, is a partial differential equation which is supposed to be satisfied at every point inside a material which transfers heat only by conduction, such as an ordinary solid. Other forms of heat transfer exist in materials with a liquid or gaseous or solid state or in vacuum, and these must also be taken account of in general so the equations rapidly become really quite complex. However this is the basic idea. The constant [math]alpha[/math] is called the thermal diffusivity. It is related to the thermal conductivity, the density of the material and the specific heat capacity of the material at constant pressure (that the pressure is constant is fairly often a good starting approximation to make). The relation is as follows: [math]alpha = frac{kappa}{rho c_p}.[/math] So the thermal conductivity relates the size of the heat flux to the temperature gradient, while the thermal diffusivity actually determines how fast the material heats up or cools down at all points, once boundary conditions are given on the heat equation. It’s the thermal diffusivity that determines how fast heat flows from the hot end of a steel rod, let’s say, towards the cold end, if the rod is insulated at its surface, that is, if it is surrounded by a material with very low heat conductivity and diffusivity, along its whole length. To find out this rate of heat flow you would have to place boundary conditions on the heat flow, amounting to constant high temperature at one end and constant low temperature at the other end and then solve the heat equation, which will eventually reach a steady state, given a reasonable initial temperature distribution in the rod. Then you can compare the results with experiments."},{"instruction":"Why are HDMI cords so expensive?","output":"You are trying to buy them at the wrong place."},{"instruction":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

From then on, their children and children’s children’s children’s children - carry the blessing of being a Jew, plus the horrors perpetrated on Jews by non-Jews - still. A Christian can become a Jew - as well as some Jews choose to become other religions. However, when Hitler wanted to exterminate Jews - all Jews and anyone with “one drop of Jew blood” were exterminated. My daughter’s father was born a Jew in Warsaw in 1930 - and in 1938 landed in the USA wearing tsitsis - and became an adult anti-Semitic Jew. I didn’t know until after children - and now our daughter hated his hypocrisy so much that she became a Catholic - and our son hates all religions and has no interest in Israel. When my ex died, she found that he was entitled to be buried in a family plot and so, the anti-Semitic Jew is buried in a Jewish cemetery - next to his mother - the woman he stole money from for years! I say: be whatever you choose - and suffer the consequences of your choice. As a person looking to become a Jew, I say: wear a Chai or Star of David or Mezuzah so all can see that you are a Jew (even if you are not). Remember: Jesus was a Jew. Judaism does not recognize him as our messiah - but Christians do - and yet they are still anti-Semitic."},{"instruction":"f you agree with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan that its time to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because the deficit has skyrocketed, what percentage of cut to each program would you support?","output":"No percentage.

Granite is made by solidification and cooling of magma deep within the earth over a period of millions of years. It is known as an igneous rock because of its origin from the cooling down of molten Magma. During the process of heating and then slow cooling, granite forms as an exceedingly hard material. Granite consists of primarily Feldspar, Quartz which are very hard minerals. Marble is known as metamorphic stone as it is made by the transformation of another type of stone called sedimentary stone. Sedimentary rocks form from sediments in the earth combined with buried plant life under the earth over a long period of time. These sedimentary rocks get metamorphosed into marble beneath intense heat and pressure. This method incorporates different minerals into the marble that can provide the stone engaging colors.

Because it will give you right direction and has content relevant to GATE. If you do on your own then you will waste lot of time. And go with reputed brands like Ace Academy/ Made Easy or IES MasterTake non technical section seriously. Your competition is preparing it and if you don't do it properly then it will definately cost youRevise regularly else you will forget everything. But work smart, what most aspirants do is that they get handbook of handwritten notes from websites like hindustanphotostat (.in) and append their personal notes in it. The material is way superior then what you can make plus it saves time which can be invested in practicingSectional mocks are also important and are much better material to practice questions rather then random websites and question banks. They have enough questions on relevant pattern and newly added topics. Also you get hands-on on digital calculatorPrevious year question cannot replace mock test. So do enroll for it. Not just for sake of giving test. Rather to learn from your mistakes and get access to solutions to questions you couldn't solve And this is not relevant to GATE preparation but still make note of this.

Here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision: Financial Situation: Evaluate your current financial situation, including your income, expenses, and savings. Determine if you have enough savings to cover the upfront costs of buying a home or if you need a loan to finance the purchase.Interest Rates: Consider the prevailing interest rates on home loans. If interest rates are low, taking a home loan may be more favorable as it allows you to benefit from leverage and potentially earn higher returns on your invested savings.Loan Terms: Assess the terms and conditions of the home loan, including the interest rate, loan duration, and any associated fees. Understand the monthly payment obligations and the total cost of the loan over its duration.Monthly Budget: Review your monthly budget to see if you can comfortably afford to set aside a portion of your salary for savings without significantly impacting your lifestyle. It's essential to strike a balance between saving for a home and maintaining a reasonable quality of life.Investment Opportunities: Consider alternative investment options and their potential returns compared to the interest rate on the home loan. If you can invest your savings in avenues that offer higher returns than the loan interest, it may be more beneficial to take a loan and invest your savings elsewhere.Risk Tolerance: Evaluate your risk tolerance and financial stability. If you prefer lower financial risk and want to avoid debt, saving money from your salary might be a more suitable option for you.Long-Term Goals: Consider your long-term financial goals and how buying a home fits into your overall financial plan. Evaluate whether you want to prioritize owning a home quickly or if you have other financial objectives that require your attention. It's crucial to assess your financial situation, preferences, and goals before making a decision."},{"instruction":"What is your say to All India Muslim Personal Law Board's plan to open Sharia courts in all districts?","output":"The demand of AIMPLB to setup Sharia Court in every district is very disturbing. Muslims (though there are many other religions) now and then demand separate systems for them (based on Quran). This is the outcome of politician's appeasement policy for the sake of vote bank.

Just think if one can give talaq to his wife (because only men are allowed to) just by pronouncing it three times (even through mobile) and not liable to pay any maintenance to his (house)wife, is inhuman to say the least. We know that majority of indian women (married) are housewives and the number is even higher in Muslims, how would they sustain their livelihood. Also in case husband and wife want to get back together after divorce, wife has to undergo Nikah Halala which affects dignity and modesty of Muslim women.

We could theoretically design an enzyme that converts heme (as in hemoglobin) to chlorophyll ([LINKED_TEXT: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341161980_Bacteriochlorins_and_their_metal_complexes_as_NIR-absorbing_photosensitizers_properties_mechanisms_and_applications/figures?lo=1] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341161980_Bacteriochlorins_and_their_metal_complexes_as_NIR-absorbing_photosensitizers_properties_mechanisms_and_applications/figures?lo=1]): 3. But then what? Chlorophyll by itself does not do much more then absorb light. Any food coloring (or any color) will do the same. You need the protein environment. Here is a picture of one such system - there are 2, and the image is of [LINKED_TEXT: Photosystem II] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosystem_II]; note that for clarity its only part of the system (the full system is even more complex). Each colored ‘spring’ is a different protein, encoded by a different gene, thus there are ~25 genes in total for PSII alone. To make things worse these systems need to embedded in a membrane to work, and you need a specific arrangement of the membrane. 4. Even if we did get all the above working all we gain is proton motive force ([LINKED_TEXT: Chemiosmosis] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemiosmosis#Proton-motive_force]) that help us generate ATP ([LINKED_TEXT: ATP synthese] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthase]) and electrons. Again, membrane embedment is needed. Humans have this mechanism (aka mitochondria) so lets skip it. 5. And then we actually need the whole [LINKED_TEXT: Calvin cycle] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_cycle], where CO2 is fixed to sugars. That will take another ~9 enzymes. We also need the enzymes that make the compounds used in the cycle, like Ribulose-5-P (~4 enzymes). 6. Finally we need to worry about physics of light and gas diffusion. Ever wondered why most leaves are flat? Leaves are flat because (a) light does not penetrate very deep, and (b) CO2 does not solubilize well in water, the main component of every living cell. That why leaves need high surface to volume ratio. Humans suck in this ratio, that is why we have lungs, but the lungs are not exposed to light… Bottom line, the naive assumption that ‘if stupid plants can do it, it must be simple’ is simply wrong. Living systems are in general much more complex than man-made systems. Furthermore, they are ‘built’ by very different principles. Assume less and you will learn much more."},{"instruction":"New theory: in Endgame, could Tony Stark have given Steve Rogers a metal shield (instead of vibranium) before the final battle since he is still a little mad at him?

However, I can provide you with some general tips that may help you jumpstart your weight loss fast journey. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine. Here are some guidelines: 1. Create a calorie deficit: To lose weight fast, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. Calculate your daily caloric needs and aim to create a deficit by reducing your calorie intake or increasing your physical activity. 2.Eat a balanced diet: Focus on consuming whole, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages high in calories. 3.Portion control: Be mindful of your portion sizes. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control the amount of food you eat. Eating slower can also give your body time to recognize feelings of fullness. 4.Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water can help control hunger, support digestion, and keep you hydrated. 5.Regular exercise: Incorporate both cardiovascular exercises (like walking, jogging, cycling) and strength training into your routine. Cardiovascular exercises burn calories, while strength training helps build muscle, which can boost your metabolism. 6.Increase physical activity: Find ways to be more active throughout the day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, go for short walks during breaks, or engage in activities you enjoy that get you moving. 7.Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Sufficient sleep helps regulate appetite hormones and supports overall well-being. 8.Manage stress: High stress levels can contribute to weight gain or hinder weight loss fast. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as practicing meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. Remember, losing weight too quickly can be detrimental to your health and can lead to muscle loss or nutritional deficiencies. Aim for gradual, sustainable weight loss by making long-term lifestyle changes rather than relying on quick fixes. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice.

Geoffrey Boycott: India has already lost the 1st test. Another loss here would mean losing the series. Ravi Shastri: India should never have allowed the Aussies to reach 445 after they had them at 269–8. Geoffrey Boycott: Harbhajan must be wondering what more he could have done after taking that hat-trick. Aussies have got this in their bag. Ravi Shastri: Well, as they say the match isn’t over until it’s over. Let’s see what India has got in store in their second innings. Mind you, they will be under tremendous pressure having been told to follow-on. ======================India’s 2nd Innings begin======================= Day-3 *After the loss of 1st wicket* Geoffrey Boycott: Looks like India has changed their batting order. Ravi Shastri: Yeah! It’s the half centurion from last innings, instead of the one the whole country is depending on. *India loses their second wicket and the man the whole country is eagerly waiting for arrives at the crease* Geoffrey Boycott: He is finally here. I wonder how much pressure he must be feeling. Ravi Shastri: There is a huge task ahead. His wicket is the difference between a Draw and an Australian win. *In the meanwhile, camera points at someone who is looking at the match with utmost concentration and suddenly, India loses another wicket.* Geoffrey Boycott: Australia have got him! Oh my god, that’s a huge wicket. Indian hopes must be dashed after this. Ravi Shastri: It’s not just another wicket, it’s Sachin Tendulkar. Who can save India now that he is gone. If I was an Indian fan, I wouldn’t keep my hopes high. *After a decent partnership with Laxman, the captain gets dismissed. Scoreboard reads 232–4* Geoffrey Boycott: Another one departs. India is still 42 runs behind and Ganguly is gone now. Ravi Shastri: This seemed like a good partnership. India’s chances of a draw are all but gone. *India’s No. 6 arrives on the crease and takes his guard.* There is this steely determination in his eyes even as the crowd starts to leave the stadium. He defends the 1st ball solidly and takes his guard again. India survive the day without any further loss. Day-4 Camera focuses on his eyes again.. They are not blinking, not even for a second while facing the ball, and the next ball and the ball after that. This man is batting with all his concentration on one thing and one thing only, to not lose his wicket. Day-4 ends with India at 589–4 and now at a position to dictate terms. Laxman is batting at 275 and on the other side is his partner at 155 n.o. Day-5 Geoffrey Boycott: When do you think will India declare now? The match has been saved and they should push for a win. Ravi Shastri: They do seem to be going for quick runs now. Let’s see what score Ganguly finds comfortable to declare at. *Laxman soon gets dismissed but his partner bats on. He is not giving his wicket away anytime soon.* Geoffrey Boycott: What an innings has it been. Laxman has played the innings of a lifetime. Ravi Shastri: He deserves all the applause from the crowd for that. Will India declare now? No signal from Ganguly yet. *India’s 6th wickets falls and then the 7th wicket through a run-out and it’s him* Geoffrey Boycott: I don’t think there was any other way to dismiss him. Only a run-out or a declaration could have stopped him from batting today. Ravi Shastri: I guess this is the reason why they call him ‘The Wall’. If India wins today, he deserves as much credit for it as Laxman. India wins and there he is finally smiling. Camera points at him again. He is relieved more than anything. He doesn’t want the MOM award or his name in articles tomorrow or on anyone’s lips. He got what he wanted — An Indian win! He stands there and soaks in the moment. He knows it’s a historical day and he is just glad to be a part of it. He closes his eyes and relives the moments again.

My daughter in law is refusing to vaccinate her children based on this belief.","output":"It’s possible. Many other answers here lack context and a detailed discussion of the matter. Let’s begin with the story of Hannah Poling. From the CBS article: “Hannah was described as normal, happy and precocious in her first 18 months. Then, in July 2000, she was vaccinated against nine diseases in one doctor's visit: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae. Afterward, her health declined rapidly. She developed high fevers, stopped eating, didn't respond when spoken to, began showing signs of autism, and began having screaming fits. In 2002, Hannah's parents filed an autism claim in federal vaccine court. Five years later, the government settled the case before trial and had it sealed. It's taken more than two years for both sides to agree on how much Hannah will be compensated for her injuries. [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/eveningnews/main3915703.shtml] [URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/06/eveningnews/main3915703.shtml]In acknowledging Hannah's injuries, the government said vaccines aggravated an unknown mitochondrial disorder Hannah had which didn't \\"cause\\" her autism, but \\"resulted\\" in it. It's unknown how many other children have similar undiagnosed mitochondrial disorder. All other autism ‘test cases’ have been defeated at trial. Approximately 4,800 are awaiting disposition in federal vaccine court.” So it seems there are pre-existing conditions that can be exacerbated by vaccination leading to autism, such as in Hannah’s case. Arguably, the vaccines were causal in her case. We can examine the counterfactual to determine the truth - if she were not given the vaccines, then she would not have developed autism in the given timeframe. Many other answers then fail to cite an important fact - there was never an investigation into vaccine safety based on the knowledge of mitochondrial disease. Unfortunately, medicine is not too keen to undertake such an investigation. On the other hand, as part of receipt for compensation, the Polings were told to keep silent under a gag order. This might tell you something about the state of affairs our society is in. You can’t find evidence unless you earnestly look for it. The “absence of evidence” is not evidence that something cannot happen. So it is possible.

Typically, mobile carriers maintain records of call history for a limited period of time, usually a few months, for their customers. If you are the account holder for the mobile phone number in question, you may be able to access the call history by logging into your account on the mobile carrier's website or by contacting their customer service. If you are not the account holder, you may still be able to access the call history if you have a valid legal reason, such as if you are a law enforcement officer with a warrant or court order. However, in most cases, it is not possible to access the call history of a mobile phone number without the account holder's permission or a valid legal reason.

A powerful beginning for a wonderful book. We all need to dream a little to stay sane. But my favorite lines come after the opening lines. “Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met nearly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.” A must-read for sure. Now onto the next line, \\"The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation\\" —The Secret History, Donna Tartt The line just sets the scene. You know you are in for a ride. “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" —Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen From a classic with a classic beginning. Witty dialogues, clever prose, sharp humor, great social satire. The kind of book you must read before you die. “Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.” —The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, Douglas Adams A fun beginning. This book is full of fun and absurd quotes. Another must-read."},{"instruction":"Can you take control of your blood sugar?","output":"Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is paramount for overall well-being and vitality.

Most planes do not have auto land—meaning the plane at some point has to be flown by hand, the autopilot is not designed to land the plane. There is no “auto-takeoff” feature. Takeoff and departure, and approach and landing are almost always hand flown. This is the most interesting and busy time of the flight. Climbs with intermediate level offs, turns to get to your assigned route, radio calls. checklists, power changes. Lots of things going. Once you get past the departure control airspace and into the enroute center airspace it quickly becomes rather boring—by now you are established on a heading that will take you to your first point on the flight plan where you are mostly going in a straight line. You also have a clearance to your final altitude. Somewhere along the line you engage the autopilot and let it handle the mundane aspects of flying while you monitor and pre-FMS, actually used a heading knob to command the autopilot to turn the plane. Hand flying a plane at altitude is hard work — air is thin requiring constant attention to maintain heading and altitude, and if the yaw damper isn’t working, you will not have a good day. Better to have a working autopilot. At some point in the descent, go back to hand flying where you get some beneficial practice and experience."},{"instruction":"the Indian economy going to hit a recession in the coming months?","output":"It is difficult for economists and policymakers to foresee when a recession will occur and how severe it would be. Economic data and trends can shed light, but the economy is very sensitive to unforeseen occurrences and external forces. As a result, predicting whether or not a recession will occur in the near future is fraught with uncertainty. But there are indicators that a recession could be coming. An inverted yield curve is one warning of a possible economic downturn. Bond interest rates at various maturities are plotted on a graph called the yield curve. Generally speaking, the risk and uncertainty of lending money for a longer period of time is reflected in the higher yields offered by long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. However, an inverted yield curve occurs when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds, and this is seen as a precursor to a recession. This is because it indicates that investors are fretting more about the short-term than the long-term prospects of the economy. Slowing economic growth is another sign of a possible recession. Many countries' economies have reported slower growth rates in recent years, reflecting the global economic slowdown. The slowdown in global commerce that has resulted from trade tensions between the United States and China has had a significant impact on economies around the world. In addition, many nations' economies have slowed because of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on global supply networks and consumer spending. A recession can be exacerbated by high levels of debt and unstable finances. Countries with significant amounts of government debt, such as the United States, may be less able to weather economic storms. A financial crisis may also result from other factors, such as the increasing levels of corporate debt and the prevalence of unsafe lending practices. It's important to remember that although if these signs point to the possibility of a recession, they in no way ensure that one will actually happen. It's not uncommon for economic trends to shift suddenly, and unforeseen occurrences may derail economic growth. For instance, a possible recession may have been avoided if the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines and the reopening of economies had resulted in a spike in economic activity. And fiscal and monetary policies can help stabilize the economy and lessen the blow of a downturn. In sum, it is challenging to forecast the exact date and depth of a recession, although there are warning signs that one may be approaching. There are a number of causes that could lead to a recession, including the inverted yield curve, sluggish economic development, and high levels of debt and financial instability. Economic forecasts are volatile and susceptible to sudden shifts in response to unforeseen occurrences and external forces. To maintain economic growth and stability, policymakers must constantly monitor and anticipate potential threats to the economy.

I don’t see how impaling is any worse than the iron maiden, or quartering, or burning at the stake (practices preferred in Western Europe). They did what they had to do to set examples and warnings. At the time fear was the only method employed to handle most every situation. Starting with the catholic church who later judged Vlad and called him satan instead of worshiping him for having saved their cassock wrapped asses. (Mehmet II had vowed after conquering Constantinople to feed his horse his oats out of the altar of the Saint Peter’s in Rome) 2) Vlad could not have possibly impaled tens of thousands of Turks himself. He gave the order, and the soldiers in his army executed it. So not only him, but the entire Wallachian army set that warning. Gladly, and rightfully so. On a different note - I personally don’t think Vlad’s entire dynasty (Draculesti) was named after some medal bestowed on one of the members.

The tester works by allowing current to flow through your body. When I wore footwear, I saw that the bulb glowed less brightly than when I didn't wear any footwear. The wiki page [LINKED_TEXT: Test light] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_light] confirms this: A low-cost type of test lamp only contacts one side of the circuit under test, and relies on stray capacitance and current passing through the user's body to complete the circuit. Disclaimer: If you get shocked, don't sue me for telling you not to wear footwear. It probably means that either the tester is faulty, you touched the tester's tip that's in direct contact with the live pin, or there is some other issue. If you want to be cautious, use some equipment like a phone charger or hair-dryer, or just get a qualified electrician to check it for you."},{"instruction":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","output":"Years ago, circa 1980, I was walking down the sidewalk and saw a police officer, a woman, and two young boys, the were perhaps early teens, perhaps a bit younger.

The boy said no and the woman turned to the officer and said ‘That’s okay officer, I don’t want to file a report.” She turned to her son and said “You know that the rule is that you always lock your bike if you leave it outside like this.” That was, and still is, the most creative discipline applied to a child.

Here are the key benefits of using eSIM: 1. Flexibility and Convenience: eSIM eliminates the need for a physical SIM card, allowing you to switch between mobile carriers without changing the physical card.You can add multiple eSIM profiles to a single device, enabling you to have separate lines for personal and business use or when traveling internationally. 2. Remote Activation: eSIM activation can be done remotely, without the need for a physical SIM card to be inserted. This makes it easier to set up new devices or switch carriers. 3. Storage and Space Efficiency: eSIM is embedded directly into the device's hardware, freeing up the SIM card slot for other purposes, such as expandable storage.It eliminates the risk of losing or damaging physical SIM cards. 4. Global Roaming Simplified: When traveling, you can easily switch to a local carrier's network through eSIM, without having to buy a new SIM card or change your number. 5. Instant Activation: eSIM activation is typically faster than traditional SIM card activation, as it doesn't require manual insertion and setup. 6. Streamlined Device Setup: When purchasing a new device, eSIM allows for a quicker and smoother activation process, reducing the need for physical handling of SIM cards. 7. Compatibility with IoT Devices: eSIM is particularly useful for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wearables, as it allows them to be connected to cellular networks without the need for large SIM cards. 8. Enhanced Security: eSIM technology incorporates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. 9. Reduced Plastic Waste: With eSIM, there's less reliance on physical plastic SIM cards, contributing to a reduction in e-waste and environmental impact. 10. Remote Management: Carriers and device manufacturers can remotely manage and update eSIM profiles, making it easier to provide new services or switch plans without the need for a physical swap. 11. Future-Proofing: eSIM technology is becoming increasingly common and supported by more carriers and devices, making it a future-proof choice. 12. No Physical Swaps: eSIM eliminates the inconvenience of swapping SIM cards between devices, especially if you frequently switch between devices. In summary, eSIM offers greater flexibility, convenience, and efficiency compared to traditional physical SIM cards. It simplifies the process of changing carriers, setting up new devices, and managing multiple lines, making it an attractive option for modern mobile users."},{"instruction":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter.

The problem is what we base our universe on. We have put all of our chips on gravity as being the sole creator of the universe. We are convinced that gravity alone can turn ordinary matter into the greatest objects known to man. It can't. It is impossible to realize how the history of our universe unfolded but so many questions about what we see now can be answered if we just would realize that gravity doesn't make heat but heat makes gravity. It is a “chicken or the egg” type situation. We think it was gas and dust turning into a star or black hole when really the matter started out superheated and was creating the gravity from the beginning. Our galaxy was one spinning, fusion filled mass. It flattened and cooled. After that, our stars were spinning, fusion filled masses. They flattened then cooled. Then our planets, again, fusion filled masses. They flattened and cooled creating the moon's and rings. So many questions answered. Why most everything rotates in nearly the same plane is answered. Why is everything so hot is answered. Why things we see billions of light years away are so bright are answered. Why stars start forming when the black hole seems to still have more to consume is answered. This theory is called the “centrifugal matter distribution process” and it does connect everything together with heat. Besides the bb theory, this is the only other way it all could have happened.

In universe, the answer is pretty simple; the Borg got too cocky, and picked a fight with the wrong people. as another poster commented, the Undine-Borg war destroyed hundreds if not thousands of Borg ships, and dozens of their stronghold worlds. Considering the Borg also got a cube destroyed by the Romulans, and 2 destroyed by the federation, along with an important transwarp conduit. They clearly decided to take a step back and regroup. In real life? The Borg had become pretty impossible to write for realistically. They started off as an all powerful, nearly unstoppable juggernaut, got a pasting, came back with a vengeance, got one again, got too cocky and nearly got destroyed, survived only through the intervention of Voyager, and became a serious threat once again only to get their butts handed to them again. all of this came together to make the Borg an increasingly unrealistic threat moving forward, unless they became even more powerful, at which point it would strain credulity quite a bit to see them still defeated in the end.

([LINKED_TEXT: Click for the image source] [URL: https://img0.etsystatic.com/194/1/15933998/il_570xN.1302443306_ql5m.jpg], since my mother apparently threw away the actual object the last time we moved, I’ve had to search for a similar object online.) As you see, it is a whiskey bottle. I was one of those kids who loved to sniff around at home and satisfy her curiosity by monkeying with the contents of the drawers, closets, and wardrobes (to my mother’s great dismay); and who wondered at the occasional interesting vintage object that happened to come her way. And one day I came across this whiskey bottle that had been hiding in a shady corner of a display cabinet in our living room, concealed by a chaotic arrangement of porcelain knick-knacks, small flower vases, old picture frames with black and white photographs encased in them, and other nostalgic paraphernalia that you can find in an average Turkish household. But a whiskey bottle? A whiskey bottle was really out of place in our home, especially considering that my mom was a sworn teetotaller. In my fascination, I took the bottle in my hand and fumbled with it, and only then noticed a slit in the glass, which ran along the periphery of the bottle somewhere in the middle, and seemed to split the bottle into two halves. (If you look closely, you can see the slit I mention in the picture above as well. It is above the label, but beneath the beam of light reflected off the surface of the bottle.) So as a next step, I gripped the neck of the bottle and pulled it up and voila! I saw this. ([LINKED_TEXT: image source] [URL: https://a.1stdibscdn.com/archivesE/upload/8080/3348/XXX_8080_1337980319_1.jpg]) The upper part of the “bottle” easily came off, and about two dozen small metallic cylindrical tubes popped out with a tinkle and spread like the petals of a lotus flower before my eyes. I was seriously confused, and took the bottle to my mom to ask her what this “bottle” actually was. To my surprise, she told me that the object in my hand was a “cigarette dispenser.” The cigarettes would be inserted in those little brass cylinders, and when the bottle was opened, they would pop out, and you could pick your cigarette. You see, in times of yore, people did not really know much about how hazardous smoking was to your health (hey, remember how common cigarette ads used to be in the past, and how they glorified and romanticized smoking!), and smokers practically outnumbered non-smokers. Therefore, believe it or not, it used to be a mundane affair to offer cigarettes to your guests in Turkey, as if you were simply offering them tea or coffee. And since Turkish people cannot bear to offer something to their guests in an unpretentious, plain package; they wanted to add some elegance to it and thus pamper the guests - and as a result, my family purchased one of these fancy cigarette dispensers that deceptively looked like a whiskey bottle. (I can only speculate about when these cigarette dispensers became popular in Turkey, and I surmise that this object may have come into our possession in the late 70s or so.) From a contemporary perspective, everything about this object looks weird to me. Since we are much more knowledgeable about the dangers of smoking (and also second-hand smoking) today, I cannot imagine my mother offering any cigarettes to our guests, even if she knew they were smokers. In addition, in the current conservative climate of Turkey, I don’t think anyone would want to sell cigarette dispensers in the form of a whiskey bottle, lest they alienate some religious customers who smoke cigarettes but vehemently abstain from alcohol and cannot even tolerate the idea of getting their cigarettes from a dispenser that remotely resembles a whiskey bottle. All in all, I think it was an interesting vintage object and I wish we didn’t throw it away. It had a beautiful story, and it shed light on a tiny but intriguing chapter of the history of “domestic life” in Turkey, if you like. I would have liked to keep it."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between perfume, eau de toilette and cologne?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Cologne, Perfume, or Body Spray?

When H'El was created. He was created because the blood samples in the Kryptonian ship sent by Jor-El, they were meant to be exposed to different kinds of interstellar energy, to see what the effects would be on Kryptonian physiology. The ship was thus programmed to allow certain dosages of stellar or interstellar radiation enter the ship, and expose the blood samples to those energies. And the energy of a Quasar made it so from the blood samples H'El was created. And H'El got his Kryptonian physiology permanently evolved. To the point he no longer needed any sunlight at all to keep his powers working, same as red sunlight could not depower him. Even Kryptonite couldn't kill him. And magic barely affected him, if anything at all. H'El had all the powers that a yellow empowered Kryptonian has and much more. He didn't had just the abilities, but far more raw power, and he had other abilities within Kryptonian potential unlocked and very developed. Like… Highly advanced telepathy, highly advanced telekinesis, teleportation, chronokinesis, and other powers H'El wasn't even aware he had them, seeing a yellow empowered Superman has them. So those blood samples were just exposed to a limited dose of the energy emitted by this… A Quasar is just the supermassive Black Hole at the center of a galaxy, feeding on matter and energy. While GRB (gamma ray bursts) are the byproduct of stars that go Hypernova. Not supernova. Hypernova! Hypernovas only happen when a star is massive enough to create a Black Hole. And unlike its weaker brother the Supernova, it emits most of its energy through two jets. With some particles moving close to the speed of light, and others moving actually at the speed of light. So what would be better for a Kryptonian?! A GRB obviously. The types of energy emitted by a Quasar and a GRB are mostly the same. The main differences are the energy released per second and how long is that energy emitted. Most GRB’s emit far more energy than a Quasar per second, although a Quasar lasts longer and thus will release more energy in its entirety. Om average a GRB lasts only 30 seconds, but it can last one second, ten seconds… It depends on the mass of the star. So here's a simple example… Superman exposed to a GRB and a Quasar for let's say 30 seconds. In a GRB during those 30 seconds, Superman could be exposed to something like 8.8E+47 Joules. While with a Quasar during those 30 seconds, Superman would only be exposed to something between ~9.75E+36 Joules and ~1.95E+39 Joules. Our entire sun only has an energy output of 3.8E+26 Joules. That's why a GRB would be better for Superman and Kryptonians in general, seeing they would get more energy per second than with a Quasar. And if H'El is used as a measuring tool, then if Superman absorbed all the energy of one of the energy jets of a GRB, then he should immediately start to evolve into his Superman-Prime OM evolutionary stage, and go beyond it. Where Superman would have all the powers of Superman-Prime OM and more. Which considering Superman-Prime OM was stated to possess powers far beyond those ever held by any meta, then you would get a Nigh-Omnipotent character in seconds. All of that in less than a minute. So if Superman was pressed for time he could use a GRB to permanently evolve his powers, putting them closer to his true potential. Into perhaps something like this… A Superman that was Nigh-Omnipotent, and thus capable of also being Nigh-Omniscient and Nigh-Omnipresent. Too powerful to limit himself to any Multiverse in the countless Multiverses of DC. Becoming a being of the Omniverse."},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

That’s a very risky strategy. There has been a tendency for decades for minorities to dismiss schools as “white man’s knowledge”. Teaching that math and science have been used to enforce systemic racism is a good way to instill a dislike of math and science.

Isn't there a chance that in a hurricane or weather event that causes a power outage that the natural gas will be shut off as well? Wouldn't this defeat the purpose of it in these events?","output":"I’ve spent a lot of time working with standby generators, but none of them were fueled with natural gas. Here are my preferences, for what they are worth: Gasoline sours in storage. If it sits for 6 months, it goes bad. For this reason alone, it is a bad choice. Gasoline is also more prone to explode than other choices. If gasoline is used, be sure and add fuel stabilizer to the tank.Propane works well and doesn’t go bad like gasoline. It burns clean and is easy to use. The major problem, depending on your location would be availability during an extended outage.Diesel wins as far as I am concerned. It is less volatile than the other choices, and is readily available. It stores well and generates more power than others as well.More thoughts: It is important to exercise standby generators. My routine was to fail the incoming power and start the generator and let it run under load. This was done once per month (We had ATS Automatic Transfer Switch). Change the oil and fuel filters annually."},{"instruction":"After you prepared to retire, what area of your life did not go as planned?","output":"My plan was to retire at age 66 as half of a couple. My husband was essentially pushed into early retirement by job loss at age 61 during the recession. Not a total deal breaker. We re-calibrated our financial plans and could make it work if I stayed the course at work and continued saving/investing. He filed for his social security benefits at 63. Things would probably have worked out just fine. But the night of November 12, 2014, my husband of 43 years inexplicably drove away from the house, leaving his phone behind. We suspected sleep walking, maybe aggravated by the meds he was taking for prostate cancer. His body was found the next day in his overturned truck just a few miles from home. Nothing prepares you for a gut-punch like that. Once I started to emerge from the brain fog of grief, I adjusted my life plan and financial plans. I extended my retirement date to 68–1/2. Financially, I've made it work, but I would have enjoyed retirement more as a couple rather than as a lone retiree."},{"instruction":"Was Iran/Persia powerful before? Was it full of barbarians as mentioned in the movie “300”? If it was, then did Persians raise the three empires of Achamedians, Safavid, and Sasanian?","output":"Yes, Persia was very powerful in ancient times. So powerful, in fact, that they created one of the largest empires in the world. They were able to conquer the civilizations of the Middle East, and they were even able to conquer Egypt, one of the most advanced ancient civilizations. The Persians also nearly conquered another great ancient civilization in Greece, but the Greeks stopped them as it was portrayed in the movie “300”. The Persians did indeed create the 3 empires that you said. Here is the Persian Empire at it’s greatest extent: As you can see, it’s pretty damn big. It has territories in 3 continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. To conquer and manage that big of an empire, you have to be pretty damn powerful. 300 is just a movie based on a comic book. It’s not really historically accurate. But the Greeks did regard the Persians as “barbarians”, because they were not Greek. That doesn’t mean they weren’t powerful or advanced."},{"instruction":"Why do people from other countries think the USA’s healthcare system is so great?","output":"Some people are convinced that the most expensive thing is the best.

Mistakes can be expensive and devalue your property. But if you can do them well and have the time, it will save you money. On the other hand, even if you can, it just may not be worth the hassle. Sometimes pros can save you hassle and money. If you hire, interview well. References from people you trust may help you get started, but sometimes those you trust and should know better will send you people who will rip you off or are incompetent or inexpensive because they really don’t know any better. Also remember that when you ask contractors for references, they are not going to give you the names of their dissatisfied customers but rather of those who like their work best. Or their mothers or best friends. Also don’t rely on Craigslist, especially, or Angie’s list or the other lists of supposedly top professionals. Some of the lists are only sites where those listed pay to be on them (depending on what lists).

I am blessed and humbled to have Telugu as my Mother Tongue.. 1) The first and Foremost Thing I like about Telugu is that , we call Kids ether in adorable manner or in respectful manner as “Amma/Nanna” (Mother /Father).. Like “ Ituchudandi naanna, itu vinale amma, adi kaadu nanna/naayana, etc” ..Even many teachers address students as “Arthamayinda Amma, Arthamayinda nanna”.. That is the beauty of telugus.. we see our elders in children !! This is in addition to “kanna, buji, bidda, etc” (the adorable addresses specific to children).. Perhaps it is more to do with culture than language, as it is primary way of addressing children, I put it as part of language.. 2) Another Beautiful aspect of Telugu is Having Dvyarthi and Trayarthi kavyas (Double and triple Entendres[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre]) .. Very few languages have that like Sanskrit or Kannada /Tamizh have such extremely tough poetic works.. Take the examples of Raghava Pandaveeyam, Raghva Yadava Pandavaeeyam, etc It is said that Vemulawada Bhimakavifirst written “Raghava Pandaveeyam”, a work which was lost in course of time.. But During Golden Age of telugu Literature in Viajayanagara SriKrishna Devaraya Time, one of his court poets (Ashta Diaggajas)- Pingali Surana has written Raghava Pandaveeyam and is said to have mentioned earlier work of Bhima kavi.. In Raghava Pandaveeyam , Surana had written in such a way that if we read the kavyam/poetic book from first to last with one meaning , we get the story of Ramayana . If read the same book from first to last by considering the other meaning of words , we get the story of Mahabharata.. Two epics !! Raghava Yadava Pandaveeyam tells the story of Rama, Krishna and mahabharatha by considering three different meanings of the words.. Think the beauty of creativity in that.. And just assume how tough and hard problem is it,.. People from Mathematics and Computer Science domains can easily analyze the complexity of this problem— “The poet has to chose the words that will have different meanings, which should satisfy the grammatical set up, also the words which will help the flow of the story , the character names in completely two different and long stories, and most importantly making it interesting to readers !!” I think it is definitely NP-Hard problem.. Perhaps it will be a great insight into algorithmic and NLP research if we try to decode the algorithm employed by these poets to scale double entendres to such a long epic !! Even Shakespeare is said to have written double entendres of not more than one paragraph due to the complexity of the problem!! Just great , no words !! 3) What I like about telugu is that it is highly classical , beautiful and musical both with and without vowel ending.. Many feel that telugu is beautiful just because of vowel Ending.. No it is also beautiful even with consonant ending !! Observe the following images of Anjaneya Dandakam—It is musical and beautiful even with consonant endings..!! Beautiful mixture of Telugu and Sanskrit without any abrupt break.. Personally, I feel that Telugus should have popularized Anjaneya Dandakam across india, just like that of Hanuman chalisa of Braj bhasha..Both are equally divine and spiritual.. 4) I can also say about great Mathematical and poetic arts of Chandasu , Avadhanam (which is present only in Telugu after Sankritam, and Kannada also adopted it later)..or Musical or Literary beauty of telugu.. But what makes telugu unique is that its ease to mix with other languages..Not only telugu enables great compatibility with these non-native languages, but also enriched the language with vocabulary and increased its idioms strength. (My answer is definitely going to hurt the feelings of Pure Telugu enthusiasts (which even includes me).. But I am here to show the beauty of my language , not confirming that pure telugu is impossible task..) You may question, does having loan words is quite common in all languages.. Off late Englsih is loaned in all languages, what is so special about telugu than?? You can’t easily differentiate loan words from Telugu as telugu has a trait of great rapport and intermingling with the languages that it loans the words from.. We all know the major languages that Influenced telugu- “Sanskrit, Prakrit, Persian/urdu and English”, right..? The amalgamation with these languages in some literary works is so high that even after absence of almost all telugu vocabulary (except few connecting prepositions), the whole work is passable as telugu .. Even in the above Anjaneya Dandakam, the bold lyrics are initially completely in Sanskrit and suddenly it turns into Telugu (but even the telugu part in this dandakam has many Sanskrit loan words).. On a side note, It would be beautiful, if we coin pure Telugu words for the Telugu section of Anjaneya Dankdakam, keeping the Sanskrit Section as it is.. It would be another beautiful gem of Telugu !! And Sanskrit /Samskrutam is definitely.. See the following Sankeertana of Naada Brahma Tyagaraja swami varu (a great Saint -Composer of Carnatic Music). Ragam : Atana (29th melakartha janyam) Talam : Adi See the following link for meaning and lyrics in Englsih transliteration [LINKED_TEXT: http://www.shivkumar.org/music/elaneedayaradu.htm] [URL: http://www.shivkumar.org/music/elaneedayaradu.htm] In the above lyric, the ones which are in bold are actually “Telugu” (even in that Samayam , daya Sanskrit loans, hence italicized them)..And the remaining are all Sanskrit with strict Sanskrit pronunciation itself..Even If you see the flow either during singing or during reading, you don’t see any break and it continues as a single language.. that is the beauty of telugu.. Not even Indo-Aryan languages can amalgamate and gel with Sanksrit so well as Telugu !! Or see the following composition from Annamacharya (hailed as Andhra Pada Kavitaa Pitamaha).. In fact I like the style of Annamayya , he composed Keertanas in pure Sanskrit, pure telugu and in varying degree of Sanskrit -Telugu mix !! Ragam: Bowli (15th Melakartha (Mayamalavagowla) Janyam) , Talam:Adi The only bold ones are actually Telugu , remaining whole Keertana is in Sanskrit, but you will never feel that it is Sanksrit Song.. The telugu is used only for pronouns and conjunction !! You know telugu even gels well with English, and perhaps my large-hearted Telugu scholars have written and composed a classical “Jhavali” for Bharatanatyam in “Karaharapriya” raagam with lyrics as a mixture of Telugu_English way back in early 1800s . See one charanam of the javali of “Oh my lovely lalana” composed by Karur Sivaramayya garu O my lovely LalanaElane PommantiItuvanti Step, is it fit to take?Sit a while hereLet me convince you. In the above only the bold words are telugu, remaining is English..Perhaps it is a first of its kind of Literary Fusion with English in classical arts of India !! Karur Sivaramayya garu is known to have written many such javalais mixing Kannada, Tamizh , English and Telugu languages. [LINKED_TEXT: Exploring hasya rasa in Bharatanatyam] [URL: https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/exploring-hasya-rasa-in-bharatanatyam/article27548322.ece] I need not tell about Amalgamation of Urdu and telugu.. As my friend Thilak has said, there are many old Telugu songs like “Joruga husharu ga shikarukeldama”.. (except preposition and last verb , everything is Urdu !!).. It is said that Yayati Charitram of Telaganna also has Persian loans (this work of yayati charitra is often cited as pure Telugu work) Will add more later.. :) Sorry for hurting pure Telugu notion..

Don't sell sexuality, exploit it or take it for granted. Stay away from hardcore porn. It teaches you nothing and it's all fake anyway. Know that consent is very black and white. NO ONE is permitted to put their hands on your body unless you say so. And if it's against your say so, scream it from the mountain tops. It's not okay. Ever.Don't follow the herd.

Although, I now know and understand to a certain degree why they acted that way and set the boundaries that they did during my childhood.I have to admit that I really hated them for it back then and for a very long time after. In fact some of it still haunts me to this day…Something countless shrinks must have been tired of hearing about up through the years since then. Indeed boundaries are important, there’s no doubt about that.But being too strict or over-protective can also inadvertently be harmful too.Just like every other type of animal, humans learn from experience. And as such, not being allowed to have said experiences will cripple a person’s development from an early age. That is a very bad thing… Not to mention that it can fester hate and resentment towards the ones that one would normally love, admire and also to some degree respect. One thing I really hated back then and even to this day is inconsistency, either you are strict and/or over-protective or you are not. I can’t stand it when someone is treating you really sh!tty.And then suddenly completely out of the blue they start sucking up to you, showering you with gifts and whatnot like nothing happened. Just for them to feel justified about going back to being sh!tty to you all over again.Rinse and repeat… Firm, but fair is my take on how I treat someone under my care even if it was/is only temporary.There’s a very big difference between living wild and free, and that of a life on a proverbial leash. Granted, childhood life is much like living under a dictatorship…But the question is, “What type of dictator would you like to be seen and/or remembered as by your child/children then and even after they’ve grown into adults themselves?” Food for thought…-----"},{"instruction":"there a way to permanently delete files on a computer where even the FBI can't find the info?","output":"Definitely.

Here are some strategies to help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels:Eat a balanced diet: Focus on consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid or limit processed foods, sugary snacks, and beverages high in added sugars. Opt for foods with a low glycemic index, as they cause a slower rise in blood sugar levels.Portion control: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid consuming excessive calories and carbohydrates in one sitting. Consider using smaller plates and bowls to help with portion control.Choose complex carbohydrates[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #hcnrc]: Opt for complex carbohydrates that have a lower impact on blood sugar levels, such as whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables. These foods are rich in fiber, which slows down the absorption of sugars into the bloodstream.Include protein in meals: Including protein-rich foods, such as lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, and legumes, can help stabilize blood sugar levels and promote satiety. Protein slows down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar.Limit sugary beverages: Sugary drinks, including soda, fruit juices, and sweetened coffee or tea, can cause significant spikes in blood sugar levels. Opt for water, unsweetened tea, or infused water as your primary beverages.Regular physical activity: Engage in regular exercise, as physical activity helps improve insulin sensitivity and aids in the utilization of glucose by the muscles. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with strength training exercises.Stay hydrated: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to stay hydrated, as dehydration can affect blood sugar levels.Manage stress levels: High levels of stress can affect blood sugar control. Incorporate stress management techniques such as exercise, meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in hobbies to help reduce stress.Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night, as poor sleep can disrupt hormone regulation and affect blood sugar control.Monitor blood sugar levels: If you have diabetes or prediabetes, monitor your blood sugar levels regularly as recommended by your healthcare provider. This can help you track your progress and make necessary adjustments to your lifestyle or medication if needed. It's important to work closely with your healthcare provider, such as a doctor or registered dietitian, to develop a personalized plan for blood sugar control that suits your specific needs and medical conditions. They can provide guidance, monitor your progress, and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

He announced this plan today in Michigan.","output":"It sounds to me like it will do more harm than good. People forget that the USA is also a major exporter of products. The more you tax companies and the more you add taxes to any components they buy from overseas the less competitive we will be in the world market place. I am a tiny little manufacturer who does export quite a bit of our products. We use Honda engines which although based in Japan are actually made in China. All small engines are made overseas. The valves we use are made in China and most of the steel we use is imported. Now if we have lots of taxes on the imported components our costs will go up and we will cease to be competitive and will be less able to sell our products in Russia, Australia, Europe, and Asia which are nice markets for us right now. Even though the tax rates will be higher we will likely pay less in taxes because our sales will decrease. We may be able to cut some costs by laying off people and outsourcing more of our actual production to China but that is the best option I can think of to cut the higher costs we will be incurring.

We know how human life first started on the earth, how humans developed into successful societies that lasted for many years, and how these societies were destroyed. “We know, and have documentation to prove that the First Dispensation of Humanity on Earth lasted for almost two million years. A ‘dispensation’ is a measure of time that we (the Real Illuminati®) distinguish as a period when all humans upon the earth know of each other and are cooperating together. “During the First Dispensation of human time, all of humanity was cooperating as a people of one heart and one mind, and there were no poor people among them—until they ended up destroying themselves. We have not yet explained clearly how these highly advanced civilizations of humans ended up destroying themselves. One day, we intend to explain all things clearly. “For now, we ask you, the youth, to consider what you are learning: humans can control the laws of nature. In the past recorded history of this, the Sixth Dispensation of Human Time, people did not know how much control they could have over these laws. In ignorance, our ancestors created gods whom they believed had power and control over nature. Now that you have learned that YOU are the life forms that can control nature, doesn’t it make sense that you could also learn to control God? And if you learned to control God, you could also learn how to control those who speak for God, who act in God’s name, and who control your lives in the name of God.” —A New American Scripture, Chapter 20: The Great Apocalypse—A Message to the Youth of Planet Earth, pages 598–599. What we have also learned from the Real Illuminati®, however, is that, during our current mortal experience, we can choose to become as little children in our disposition, which changes our current outlook and ability to understand Real Truth® and to find happiness in our current existence: “[W]e reiterated throughout our new American scripture that ‘becoming like a little child’ is themost important aspect of learning Real Truth®. We included ‘becoming like a little child’ in our new American scripture because of its importance in helping people be able to uncover deceptions that they have previously been convinced of throughout their life. We used ‘become like a little child’ as a foundation. In other words, ignore what you have been taught since you were a little child.” —A New American Scripture, Chapter 3: The Greatest Human Deception, page 77.

Coming to stop from normal driving speeds you would be able to stop in time. let’s assume the perpetrator cuts front and rear brakes, two things you can do to slow down the car is the emergency brake and shifting to a lower gear. The emergency brake should not be applied in a manner where the rear brakes will lock up and making you lose control of the vehicle. What I would do the second I realize I have no brakes is shift to a lower gear on the transmission. so say i am in Drive(overdrive) and i have ample room to slow down, I would shift to regular drive then to L2 once speed is greatly lost, I would shift into L1 and then slowly use the emergency brake to come to a full stop.

Real Estate investing is a business. The owner of the property buys the property then rents out the property as a “Housing Service Provider”. It is a business. In most cases, the rent payments received from Tenants covers costs only for the upkeep, repair and maintenance of the building. It is a SERVICE. For people who are working, just starting out and still saving to be able to buy their first home will natually rent their 1st home. And for those who do not have any intention of owning a property - they will have to rent the roof over their heads. The “profit” that you are referring to is coming from the increase in equity of the property over a long time. There are other kinds of investing and Real Estate is one of them."},{"instruction":"What is the best one liner you have written?","output":""},{"instruction":"Was Varys actually okay with assassinating Daenerys when Robert ordered it?","output":"He seemingly had to be “OK” with it in both continuities because there was always at least some chance that it would get pulled off. There was no way to predict ahead of time that Jorah would be with her at that precise moment, or that he’d cotton on to the wine in time, etc. Too many variables were out of Varys’ control for him to not conclude that Dany’s assassination was “acceptable” if it occurred. Yes, he warned Jorah that there would be attempts, but all the same, all it would take was one to work. (And what if Jorah misses getting the warning message?!) Now, if he really wanted her to not be killed, all he had to do was just not hire the assassin in the first place and lie to Robert about the hit being a failure. But the attempt itself served a purpose by galvanizing Drogo to invade Westeros. Varys might have preferred it to fail, but the reward of actually going through with the contract was too big to pass up. Because, hey, maybe if Dany dies, Drogo still tries to invade Westeros to avenge her and Varys gets what he wants anyway. Varys gambled on it, and won (until Drogo died and Dany went off on her own), but he still could have lost and went in knowing that. It was an acceptable risk. He didn’t even warn Jorah of fake “attempts” to get Dany’s paranoia up and get her to appeal to Drogo to invade on that basis. He actually did send someone to kill her. The assassin failed, and maybe nine times out of 10 he fails. But, again, all it takes is that one time. I think it’s also important that at the time the job was discussed and likely at the time it was actually contracted out, Viserys was still alive and was also being targeted. Illyrio and Varys’ fake Aegon plotting (in the books) has shifted in many ways down the line, but it’s clear that Viserys and/or Dany not surviving to invade Westeros at all was a strong possibility — Illyrio tells Tyrion straight up he thought Dany would die with the Dothraki. If the invasion had happened, then the idea was probably to have Viserys/Dany and Robert beat each other up and for fake Aegon to swoop in and knock them both aside. But there was always a chance it wouldn’t happen, and — in Dany’s pre-dragon days — it looks like the Targaryen siblings were acceptable losses. Either Drogo would invade and then get booted out by fake Aegon (likely resulting in both Viserys and Dany being killed or re-exiled, etc.), or Viserys and Dany would go with the Dothraki and never return and be out of Aegon’s hair that way. On the show, Varys’ motivations are all over the map and pretty much take a total U-turn from seasons 1–4 and then seasons 5–8, for no obvious reason other than that without fake Aegon they had to rewrite his plot. Apart from Varys and Illyrio’s cutaway conversation that Arya overhears — which doesn’t make any sense in the grand scheme of things without Aegon’s plot — there’s no reason in the first half of the series that Varys is trying to help Dany. He’s doing intel work for Tywin in Meereen until almost the end of season 4 but then magically three episodes later, with virtually no explanation, he’s decided to throw in with Dany. Hmm."},{"instruction":"Do owners of racing cars (Lamborghini, Audi, Ferrari, Porsche etc) drive them around every day like when going for shopping or when going at work? Do they always have to watch their cars when parked in public to not get scratched/damaged by someone?","output":"I drive a Porsche Macan and its my daily driver so used for shopping, work etc. I think the novelty wears off - I parked in a really tight spot once at a restaurant and it was on my mind through lunch so I eventually went to move it. That said, I’m not watching it in public or even gunning or racing it on the street but that might be because I’m middle-aged: I really bought it for the driving experience, not for speed - I have a motorcycle for that (which I also dont race anyway because its a cruiser, not a sports bike). I also park my Macan on the street by the way - no private parking pads where I live, and treat it exactly like I treat my Civic. All that said, not all “racing cars” are practical daily drivers. The Macan is a mini-SUV and most Porsche owners have a Macan as daily driver and another fancier one for weekend/good weather driving.

Thank you for asking such a great question about [LINKED_TEXT: sports betting] [URL: https://sportscasinobetting.com/3-betting-tips-for-online-casino/]. As an expert in this field, I can tell you that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the key to successful sports betting depends on a variety of factors. However, I can share with you some of the strategies that have helped me personally to be successful in this field. The first thing to keep in mind when it comes to sports betting is that it is a form of gambling, and as such, you need to approach it with a certain level of discipline and caution. This means setting a budget for your bets and sticking to it, and avoiding the temptation to chase losses by placing larger bets than you can afford. Additionally, it's important to do your research before placing any bets. This means analyzing the teams or players involved, looking at their past performance, and considering factors like injuries or weather conditions that may impact the outcome of the game. When it comes to my personal experience with sports betting, I have found that one of the most important things is to be patient and not rush into making bets without careful consideration. I also like to focus on a few specific sports or teams that I am particularly knowledgeable about, rather than trying to spread myself too thin and bet on everything. Finally, it's important to remember that there will always be some level of risk involved in sports betting, and that even the most successful bettors experience losses from time to time. With that in mind, it's important to stay level-headed and not let emotions cloud your judgment when making bets."},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"Self- confidence comes with knowledge, faith in self and self capability and a bold determination. Self-confidence is such a valuable asset and treasure that helps us at every step in life. My experience speaks that one can triumph over one's physical ailments to a large extent just by virtue of this treasure. After all, where there is a will, doors and windows are bound to open to make a way."},{"instruction":"Do you continue to greet neighbors who never say hello first?","output":"For this kind of thing? If I feel like it, then yes. Unless they don't respond the first time after I say hello first, in which case. I don't bother anymore. Self-respect matters."},{"instruction":"Are all the components of a computer hardware and software?","output":"No, not all components of a computer are both hardware and software. Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, such as the monitor, keyboard, CPU, memory, and hard drive. These are tangible components that you can see and touch. On the other hand, software refers to the programs and applications that run on the hardware components of a computer system. Software is intangible and includes the operating system, productivity software, games, and more. However, some components can be classified as both hardware and software. For example, firmware is a type of software that is embedded in hardware components such as the BIOS chip on a motherboard or the firmware in a router. These components contain software that is used to control the hardware and perform specific functions. So, while they are hardware components, they also contain software."},{"instruction":"bujjima a Tamil word? If so, what's its meaning?","output":"No. ‘BujjimA-బుజ్జిమా’ is a 100% Telugu expression to call/address little girls (not boys) as a pet name. Meanings of English words ‘little, cute, pretty, love, affection, caressing and fondling are mindedly linked to this expression ‘Bujji-బుజ్జి’. This ‘Bujji’ has variations like ‘bujjimA-బుజ్జిమా’, bujjamma-బుజ్జమ్మ’ and ‘bujjavva’-బుజ్జవ్వ’. This expression is totally slang and hence do not search for it in standard Telugu dictionaries. Only because this word is being used by some Tamil families under Telugu influence, it can not become a Tamil expression. No Tamil language word starts with the sound ‘B’, it is always ‘P’. ~~~07/05/’23~~~~~~"},{"instruction":"Does 'nick' mean 'idiot' in British English?","output":"Nick means, to steal or to damage with a cut Idiot is someone who posts stupid questions on Quora.

I dont feel older, and I'm not sure if I look it. I'm a bit faster and stronger than I was then, and it seems I've added a couple new scars (and the side of my face where I took a surfboard to the temple has softened out a little maybe? Hard to tell from the lighting difference). The big changes really started in 2009 when I started running, but there was a significant metamorphosis that happened to me internally when I progressed from being a casual running trying lose weight and a consistent runner that really loves the act of running itself. I think that would be about age 33–34… It's easier for me to let things go, not worry about how certain things will turn out, and in general I feel less stressed even though my work load has probably doubled in that time. Fundamentally I think my dreams are the same, which surprises me. I approach them more pragmatically now, as well as spend less time thinking them through and planning them. I'm much more prone to just getting started on a project without really considering if it's even feasible. I'm more open, social, and comfortable with myself. I have no idea where that comes from, but I hear that happens to a lot of people in their thirties, maybe by now we are just better at knowing who were are and accepting that it won't change very much, but that who were are is just fine even if we didn't think so when we were younger? I've lost most of my sense of cynicism: it just isn't useful, and I realized it's nothing but a safe place to hide because it's impossible to be wrong when being cynical. My day job is far less rewarding, but I've invested more in my volunteer time. A lot has happened to me during this: travel, great and terrible things, and friends that I didn't expect to outlive- lost them so young. I look forward to the next 5, 10, 50 or as long as I'm lucky enough to keep going."},{"instruction":"it wrong to give meaty names to meatfree foods?

Mainly all the food is cooked without garlic and onion but because of the influence of other cuisines, these ingredients are now used in some of the dishes. The best place to have Kashmiri food is at a Kashmiri's place (or try to cook it yourself). I have tried many restaurants claiming to serve 'authentic' kashmiri cuisine- huge disappointment (and anger, frustration, forget it!) Here are some of the dishes that you should try if you're new to the cuisine. Vegetarian Chhok nadur (lotus stem- sour)Monjjyi haakh (kohlrabi) cooked in Mustard oil with salt, red chillies and asafetida is one of the simplest dishes to make. The best way to have monjjyi haakh is to have it with hot rice and curd.Chhok vaangun (Sour brinjal)Raazma and Kali chaaman (kidney beans with yellow cottage cheese on the side) well, I know technically these are two dishes but they complement each other so well that one is not cooked without another.Nadur yakkhinyi (to put it in simple words, this is lotus stem cooked in curd and a lot of masalas) MY PERSONAL FAVORITE. I CAN HAVE THIS EVERYDAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE Other dishes that you can try are All hacchyi wangan hacchyi, damaaloo and all Rogan Josh (veg). Oh btw, by ‘all' I mean अल- bottle gourd and pumpkin. Coming to the non vegetarian dishes. It's painful to think about them, knowing that I won't be able to have them in four months till I get home… nevermind 1. ROGANJOSH (goat meat or lamb) it's red hot and spicy.. juices flowing from the meat.. a hint of cardomom… a hit of red chillies… BRB. 2. Charvan chaagul oloo (Liver and goat testicles cooked with potatoes) 3. All syunn (Pumpkin and meat) 4. Kali (yellow mutton) have it if you don't want anything spicy but are craving for meat. Pair it up with some curd on the side and you'll lose it!! 5. Chhok charvan (sour liver) now this is not a dish-dish. But it's served on the side. 6. Tabakh maaz (lamb ribs) again, this is usually served before or after a meal. The ribs are slowly cooked in a broth till they absorb all the spices and flavors. Later, fried in ghee. THE BEST OF ALL THE WORLDS. You can also try yakkhinyi (meat cooked in curd), syunn khyachar (khichdi and meat) and gaad (red hot fish) Hope was able to help you! Enjoy!"},{"instruction":"What makes private schools better than public schools as far as getting a child ready for college?","output":"Others have noted that private schools can choose their students. This is true, but incomplete. Many private schools select for highly motivated students who are the children of highly educated parents. At my children's K-12 prep school, about 30% had an MD as a parent. Almost all the parents had at least a bachelor’s degree and many had other advanced degrees. A better comparison is between private school students and public school students who are themselves highly motivated and the children of highly educated parents. Private schools can focus on these students and can have the flexibility to accommodate a broader range of aptitudes. In many private schools, the faculty is aware that the aim of the majority of their students is admission to a highly selective college. The “average” student will be headed for a college ranked around 25th in USNews&WR. The top quarter, or so, will be competitive at the colleges ranked in the top 15’s including the usual suspects - Ivy League, Duke, Stanford, Williams, Pomona, etc. Some students show their aptitudes early - even in kindergarten. At private schools, they can be kept motivated. At my children’s school, a 3rd-grader in my son’s class was given “challenge problems” in math to keep him interested. In many respects, his math ability was greater than that of his lower school teachers. How many third-graders figure out decimals, fractions, exponents and sums of finite series on their own? Later, his teachers agreed to first skip him a class and then to a Summer tutorial in pre-Calculus so that he could take Calculus in 10th grade. Two years behind, another boy used the older boy’s achievements as his benchmark (the younger boy went to MIT where he began taking graduate-level courses his Sophomore year). In certain advanced courses, a class might have only one or two students. Few public schools could devote the resources to this kind of specialization. At my children’s school, a new Headmaster complained that the school was teaching too many college level courses! The Seniors in the upper quarter typically were taking mostly AP courses. Out of 44 total students in one class, 12 took the Calculus BC curriculum having already completed Calculus AB before Senior year. Only two students took Latin IV. Both were very, very good. They had a spirited competition. Their teacher could keep shoveling more and more material at them. One went to CMU to study Computwr Science. The other, to Princeton for pre med. The Princeton student took upper division electives in Latin Freshman year in order to have some easy courses! A program like this is not for everyone. There is a dark side to it. Some students feel parental pressure to achieve when they just don’t have the aptitude or motivation. One student really, really wanted to go to Yale, her father’s Alma mater. She came up a bit short. She graduated from Tufts - one of the finest colleges in the country but not Yale. For most students, Tufts would have been a dream. For her, it was disappointment."},{"instruction":"w does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God? Would you still have to have a priest?","output":"It depends on where you are.

Kashmiri food has a royal and rich flavor as they use spices like fennel, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and saffron.

Check out the most popular Kashmiri food dishes that you must try at least once in a lifetime. Rogan Josh - Rogan Josh is one of the trademark recipes of Kashmir cuisine. It is originated by Mughals in India. It is a healthy low-fat dish made using mutton, browned onions, spices, and yogurt. It can be served with rice or naan.

Will Smith hit Chris because Chris had supposedly insulted his wife. What was the insult? Chris called her G.I Jane. Why? Because she had shaved her head bald like a soldier. Duh! We live in a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-generational world where some women wear dresses and some wear pants. Some men do the same thing although dresses are rare. A bass player in a local band does. So what? We’re supposed to be adults. Jokes about our dress and personal appearance are common if we get too far out of the common fashion norm. Some guys wear long hair and still there are those who joke about it. Women shaving themselves bald is still a very new fashion at least in the western world. They should expect some lighthearted ribbing. And be adult about. Please note Chris didn’t threaten Jada’s life or try to cause her harm. If Jada found Chris’s comment too insulting she should have been a courageous woman about it and walked up to Chris and slapped him herself. Having Will do it and not even bothering to try to stop him harkens to the same pathetic Karen behavior attributed to some entitled assuming white women. That’s the real disgrace. We can’t have men ‘defending’ their wives honor like like some throwback medieval aristocrat. If they do lets give them guns and swords, and put them in an arena and let them kill each other and clean up the gene pool. I’ll be happy to sell tickets. Oh and please don’t whine about Jada’s alopecia problem. That just means ‘hair loss’. It is not life threatening. Lots of people go bald for a variety of reasons. If she lost her hair due to cancer therapy or the degenerative disease of progeria I’d have a little sympathy. But don’t try to BS me with ‘disease of the week’ garbage. I’ve seen her video. The hair loss is only a thin stripe on the top of her head. Easily covered with the 95% hair that is still remaining. She CHOSE to shave it all off! So she should accept that she’s going get humorous comments on occasion. I’m sure she can afford a very nice WIG as many less privileged balding women do. It worked for William Shatner.

For the sake of discussion, let's say you have a domestic violence/alcohol call, and you are told that the man is a former heavyweight boxer.","output":"I’m a big guy (6’2”, about 200 lbs. when I was on the street), and that no doubt saved me from being in more fights. That’s a good thing, because I’m not a great fighter. If I anticipated I was going to have to arrest someone that appeared to be a fighter, I’d start backup rolling toward me. If you have two or more officers present, you can often avoid a fight, as the ultimate outcome is evident. This might not be true if you were taking on Chuck Norris, but fortunately Chuck is pretty pro-police. It’s interesting that having multiple officers attend a call is a magnet for criticism, as it was at the recent incident with the trespassing arrest of two black men at a Starbucks in Philadelphia. I’ve read several critical accounts where the police were accused of escalating the situation by having half a dozen cops there. Consider how much worse this would have been, had there been one cop to confront two men, and one of them started to fight. The cops who have been rolling to assist would not have been cool, calm, and collected in their response. We had a radio code (that I will not divulge here for operational security reasons) that meant, “I need one, and only one, cover unit, but I need it as quickly as possible.” This kept dispatch from sending the entire watch rolling to your aid, but ensured you would get that additional presence quickly. That was really handy when radio just told me that the guy I was talking to had an active arrest warrant, and I thought there might be a row in my immediate future. I had a few would-be resisters look me over and say, with some bravado, “I can kick your ass.” My usual reply was something like this: “You might just be able to do that. I’m not all that tough. But you need to consider the two dozen crazy boys in blue uniforms who will be coming over the hill after me, intent on making you the project of the day. If that happens, it will suck to be you.” Once the street fighter had been assured that he was badder than me, he didn’t need to prove it as often. Some people are just going to fight. Occasionally, this happens when they are told they’re going to jail, even though they have been calm up to that point. I don’t have the clip available, but I saw an example of this on an episode of COPS I was watching two nights ago. An officer stopped a man who had been riding a bicycle (I don’t recall the reason for the stop). The officer patted him down for weapons, found none, and started conducting his field interview. When radio came back that he had an active warrant, he told the suspect, and the suspect’s demeanor changed immediately. “I DON’T HAVE A WARRANT! I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL!” He swung on the officer, then started to run (“rabbit”). The suspect was slightly larger than the officer, but the officer had assistance already on scene. The suspect was arrested after a short foot pursuit and wrestling match. It was a classic “rabbit fever” incident, where everything is fine until someone says the J-word. De-escalation techniques work only with rational people. You have to be able to reason with someone to de-escalate, and some people are incapable of reason because of alcohol or drug intoxication, mental illness, or emotional trauma. The police have little choice in who they confront. The officer on scene doesn’t have the option of saying, “I’m not taking this call. He’s too crazy for me.” A police career means signing up to handle whatever comes over the radio or data terminal. The next call might be a report on a stolen bicycle, or shots fired at the local high school. If that kind of variety appeals to you, then you might enjoy being a cop. If it’s terrifying, then maybe you want to try something else."},{"instruction":"What is social media listening?","output":"Yes, social media marketing can really help your business.

While there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, let's explore some relatable ways to approach investing that can help you navigate this exciting journey. Knowledge is Power: Before diving headfirst into investments, take the time to educate yourself. Explore various investment options, understand their risks and potential returns, and grasp the basic principles of diversification. Resources such as books, online courses, and reputable financial websites can empower you with the knowledge needed to make informed investment decisions.Define Your Goals: Your investment strategy should align with your financial goals and time horizon. Are you investing for retirement, a down payment on a house, or your child's education? Clarifying your objectives will help shape your investment approach. Long-term goals may warrant a more aggressive investment strategy, while short-term goals may require a conservative approach to protect your principal.Diversification: The age-old saying \\"don't put all your eggs in one basket\\" holds true in the world of investments. Diversification involves spreading your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographical regions to mitigate risk. By diversifying your portfolio, you reduce the impact of a single investment's performance on your overall wealth, increasing the potential for stable, long-term returns.Consider Index Funds and ETFs: For those who prefer a hands-off approach, index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a simple and cost-effective way to invest. These funds pool money from multiple investors to track a specific index, such as the S&P 500. With broad market exposure, index funds and ETFs offer diversification and typically have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds.Seek Professional Advice: If you find yourself overwhelmed or lacking the time to manage investments on your own, consulting with [LINKED_TEXT: professional debt collector] [URL: https://www.qade.co/post/how-qade-helps-clients-maximize-recovery-rates] can provide valuable guidance. A professional can assess your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals to tailor an investment strategy that suits your needs. However, it's crucial to choose a reputable advisor who operates in your best interest and aligns with your investment philosophy.Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: Investing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires patience, discipline, and a long-term perspective. Historically, the stock market has demonstrated growth over extended periods, despite short-term fluctuations. By staying focused on your goals and avoiding impulsive reactions to market volatility, you increase your chances of reaping the benefits of long-term investment growth.Stay Informed and Adjust: Regularly monitor your investments, stay informed about market trends, and periodically reassess your portfolio's performance and allocation. As your circumstances and goals evolve, it may be necessary to rebalance your portfolio or make adjustments to align with your changing needs. Remember, investing involves risk, and there are no guaranteed returns. What works for one person may not work for another, so it's crucial to understand your risk tolerance, do your due diligence, and seek advice as needed. Ultimately, the best ways to invest money depend on your individual circumstances, goals, and comfort level. By arming yourself with knowledge, diversifying your portfolio, and staying disciplined, you can navigate the investment landscape with confidence and increase the likelihood of achieving your financial aspirations."},{"instruction":"it true that Vlad the Impaler is a national hero in Romania and, if so, why is that the case?","output":"Yes, for two reasons: He was one of the (not so many) local rulers that dared to fight the Ottoman Empire.

This story influenced me greatly after reading the book, and I always refer to it whenever I face a difficult situation dealing with people: The story goes like this: One of the first people in corporate America to earn a million dollars a year in the early 1900s was Charles Schwab. This is the time when a person earning 50 a week was considered well off. He had been handpicked by Andrew Carnegie, the steel magnate, as the first president of the newly formed United States Steel Company in 1921. Schwab was only thirty-eight at the time. Why did Andrew Carnegie pay Charles Schwab one million dollars a year? Schwab was not a genius. Schwab was not smarter than other people in the company. In fact, there were smarter people in the company than him. Certainly, Schwab did not know more about manufacturing than other people. In fact, Schwab had many people working for him, who knew more about manufacturing than he did. So, what is it that was so special about Charles Schwab? Charles Schwab was paid a million dollars a year because of his uncanny ability to deal with people. The phenomenal growth of United States Steel Company in the early 1920s was attributed to Charles Schwab. Employees, from the janitor to top executives, liked him, he ate with them, and called them by their first names. They also called him by his first name. Employees felt as if they were part of the company. Productivity was said to go up 2x and even 3x without any extra spending. When asked how he did it, this is what he had to say in his own words; words that ought to be cast in bronze and hanged in every home, school, shop and office. Words that every child and adult should learn. Words that can transform your life and mine. “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among people, the greatest asset I posses, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.” “There is nothing else that so kills the ambition of a person, as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise, but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.” “In my wide association in life, meeting with many people in various parts of the world, I have yet to find the person, however great or small, who will not do better work, and put forth greater effort, under a spirit of approval than he/she would ever do under a spirit of criticism.”"},{"instruction":"Could you recommend a math book that contains a lot of problems?

Silk made by this method is sometimes called Ahimsa Silk, Vegan Silk, or Peace Silk. The process of waiting for the cocoons to hatch takes about three weeks. This slows down the production of silk significantly, so Ahimsa Silk is generally more expensive than silk made by boiling the caterpillars alive as soon as the cocoon has been formed. Note that the Ahimsa process has only been around since about 2000, so old silk is unlikely to be peace silk."},{"instruction":"What did you think of Donald Trump before he became President?","output":"He was a lying thief and serial predator.

Let's take a look at some of them. CRM system Given that inside sales are remote, sales reps usually rely on internet and telephone. They spend most of the time checking in with the existing clients, talking to prospects, or looking for leads. It’s really easy to get lost in all that information. That's why you need a solid CRM system. It’s helpful in many ways, from saving time on manual data entry to keeping client data in order. Call center software Call center software enables sales reps to spend most of their time talking rather than doing routine activities such as dialing, redialing, staying on the line until someone picks up, leaving voice messages, etc. Ideally, you need a call center software that has a built-in CRM system. Our [LINKED_TEXT: Voiptime Cloud] [URL: https://voiptimecloud.com/call-center/outbound-call-center-software?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=inside%20sales] inside sales & call center software is a perfect solution specifically tailored to cold calling.

Lead generation software It’s always a good idea to have an effective lead generation software. Such instruments are great for collecting useful data about your prospects. The more you know about potential clients, the easier it will be to convert them. Email tracking software Having a large list of leads is great but how do you make sure you’ve reached them? Email tracking software allows inside sales teams to see whether prospects open their emails and provides other valuable insights regarding the success of an email campaign. Useful apps for communication Sales are not solely about the customers. It’s very important to make sure that the whole team is working in sync, that everybody knows what they are doing and why they are doing it. That’s why maintaining an effective communication between the team members is so important. The software should allow you to do more than calling and messaging. Also, efficient communication software is a must for a remote team. Of course, there are many other tools that can boost the productivity of your sales department. Some examples we described in [LINKED_TEXT: our article] [URL: https://medium.com/voiptime-cloud-official-blog/find-the-best-tools-for-inside-sales-apps-and-services-for-each-stage-of-the-sales-process-ed3c4fa749b3] on Medium, hope you’ll find it useful.

It's like preparing a really delicious cake – you need to use the right ingredients and bake it perfectly to make it attractive to everyone.

So, I’ve compiled a list of 7 out of the box USA startups that are actually nailing it in different industrial sectors. 1. Front (Artificial Intelligence Sector) This 79M million company from San Fransisco has been around for five years. Its focus is on changing the way teams work by creating a shared-inbox platform. This app allows teams to manage incoming messages in the easiest and simplest way possible. Think of it as a better version of apps like Slack. 2. DecorMatters (Augmented Reality – AR Sector) This California based company created an app that makes buying home decoration products online an exciting and easy experience. Just by using the app with your smartphone, you can see how the products you wish to buy will fit in with your space. All you need is access to your smartphone’s camera on the app. Using “computer vision and image recognition technology,” potential clients can see, beforehand, how a piece of furniture will complete their homes. This 1.5 million free app is “based on a patent-pending AR technology.” Their app is rated 4.5+ by users. Speaking about this startup Discover.Luxury said: “DecorMatters is perfect for both the novice and design expert.” It’s similar to Room Planner – Design Home 3D, however, they have a lower rating of 4.4. 3. Bundil (Cryptocurrency Sector) Bundil jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon after receiving 100,000 worth of funding from Kevin O’Leary after the creators appeared on The Shark Tank. Dimitry Love came up with the idea when he became inundated with questions from his family about how to invest in cryptocurrency. People who use their services are able to automatically invest their spare monies from their credit or debit card purchases. They can buy into a number of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin, and Bitcoin Cash. 4. Grail (Medical and Healthcare Sector) This unique business received 1.6 billion from Hillhouse Capital Group showing that the idea was gold. The 2015 startup came up with solutions to diagnose cancer-related problems at an early stage. Even China has backed this startup by investing largely in their idea. How much money the company makes remains to be seen as cancer research is ongoing. 5. Welcome Beyond (Travel Sector) A great number of people are reluctant to travel all because they don’t know where to stay, how to book, and so forth. Yes, we already have Airbnb, but what makes this startup different is that with it you can handpick hotels. Welcome Beyond doesn’t just choose the mainstream locations, they only pick those that are truly exotic. Their main aim is to provide “a refreshing and soothing environment to the guests.” 6. Heliocor (FinTech Sector) They’ve already received 2.5 million funding. Helicor’s big idea is to help online business, e-commerce stores, and apps to be GDPR-compliant for online privacy. This regulatory, technology and consulting startup allows these companies to be “compliant of the laws of the state, fraud detection, and prevention.” 7. Aceable (Education Sector) Sageview Capital funded this idea with 55 million. This app helps you become a learner driver and when you qualify and pass the license is delivered at your home. However, you still need to take the driving test to receive your license. What makes this app great is that people who can’t attend driving classes physically are spared the stress. It has a 4.9 rating and is slightly similar to DMV Genie Permit Practice Test app but with more features. The USA startups listed above offer a fresh approach in a number of different sectors. Some are similar to others you might know but their approach makes them stand out from the competitors."},{"instruction":"Why should we plant more trees if forests are fuel for wildfires and could end up adding more CO2 to the atmosphere than say, the deserts?","output":"Trees take CO2 out of the atmosphere to grow.

Finding and studying these objects is extremely difficult, as they do not emit any light and are terrible tiny. The only ways to identify them is via microlensing or via direct imaging - the latter is only possible for large and nearby ones. From the rogue planets we have found so far we estimate that there are between two and 100,000 rogue planets for every star in the Milky Way."},{"instruction":"For prochoice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?","output":"No,.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","output":"I never had a trauma bond because I never had any kind of bond with my abusive parents. They never left any doubt that they didn’t love me at all. So I never loved them. I even tried to force myself to love them because religion said that I must, but I failed doing so, and then I left religion, too, as I would never be able to fulfill my duties anyway. I simply know that they are mentally ill, utterly selfish, irresponsible, unreliable, immoral, amoral, lacking any empathy. I know that I am defective and that it ight have “caused” them to behave this way (I have Aspergers), but having a disabled child is a risk everyone takes once you decide to have children, so it’s their fault, not mine, and as adults they should be able to face the consequences and take responsibility for their choices, not dump all their frustrations on a child who has never asked to be born and has no control about her disability. If you can’t live up to your responsibilities, don’t have children. It’s that simple. Get a pet or a realistic doll instead, or accept that you lack the ability to have children. The same goes for any abusive partner. Can’t stand your partner, say goodbye and both take their own paths. Keeping a partner in captivity so that you can punish him/her for whatever he/she does that you dislike makes no sense. There is simply no excuse for abuse."},{"instruction":"What is a dofollow backlink?","output":"Both links are the ones used for link-building strategies.

Competition to score higher In olden days, scoring 60% was decent. But now, even scoring 95% is not enough. Hence, most of the childhood get lost in studying, rote learning and trying to score maximum max. Plus, the syllabus is ever increasing and it increases pressure on children to study multiple subjects and perform well in exams. Not satisfied with what they have In olden days, people used to be happy even for smaller things like getting a toffee, or going to gardens or beach. However, this generation is never satisfied with what they have. The demand for materialistic things have risen substantially. A person having Rs 20K phone is unhappy about not having Rs 50K phone whereas a person having Rs 50K phone is not happy for not having Rs 100K phone. Too much expectations from life In olden days, people had less expectations from life. But present people have too much expectations from life and when the reality hits hard, they become disappointed. However, life is not a fairy tale. Competing with others Competition is not limited to academics and job promotions. Competition occurs in all aspects. For instance, if your friend is earning better than you, you will be unhappy and strive for it, if you cousin is settled abroad, you also want to do the same, if you relatives have better standard of living, you will also want the same. Too much attachment to materialistic things and disconnection with human beings While things like phone, laptops and other technology have bought people closer virtually, it has resulted in disconnect between human beings. Most people prefer to meet virtually rather than meet in person. Hence, people feel lonely. However, there are exceptions i.e. some people are still happy with being lonely. Lack of patience Due to advanced technology, everything has become easier, No need to stand in queues to pay bill, no need to wait for days for message from post mail, No need to go out and buy groceries, Everything happens at fingertips. Hence, today’s generation expects fast service and when it is not fulfilled, they become disappointed and frustrated. Comparing oneself with others and low self esteem Today’s generation tend to compare themselves to other more than the older generations. They compare their beauties, Body shape, money, lifestyle and everything with others. And when they don’t achieve this, their self esteem gets lowered."},{"instruction":"Do you believe in karma? Why or why not?","output":"No, I do not. I think Karma and the concept of it for the most part is very dogmatic and most modern “new age” concepts of karma are very bastardized. If you look into Hinduism the word refers to “action\\" and Karma Phala refers to those reactions or consequences of said actions. That being said, I don't believe in most (or any) Hinduism concepts either but I think its interesting nonetheless. Someone should want to be a good person regardless of whether or not there is some magical force keeping him/her in line. It should be a matter of personal values and principles and not because a supernatural force told you too. Furthermore, I think what most Wiccans and Pagans tell you about Karma is utter horseshit, but that's just my opinion. I think If “magic” (which is just energy btw) and karma exists like they say that it does, then it wouldn't think like a human and judge like a human does. I don't believe that the universe is that biased. We as humans rationalize, personify, and attach human-made concepts to things that are not people."},{"instruction":"What are the three components of the cell theory?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Jay Gohil (@jaygohil803) • Instagram photos and videos318 Followers, 196 Following, 2 Posts - See Instagram photos and videos from Jay Gohil (@jaygohil803)https://instagram.com/jaygohil803?utm_source=qr&igshid=ZDc4ODBmNjlmNQ%3D%3D] [URL: https://instagram.com/jaygohil803?utm_source=qr&igshid=ZDc4ODBmNjlmNQ%3D%3D]Follow On Instagram 😊.

I just made it out of RTC (Navy boot camp) at the end of April, so I was there during the development of the whole CoronaCrisis, as we called it. This led to some rather interesting stories… A common cadence sung as we marched goes like this: He-ere we go again, Same old song again Marching down the avenue, ___ more weeks and we’ll be through… You can listen to a similar version here: At this point, we’d made it through all of what boot camp had to offer, picked up our orders, and were desperately ready to get out of there; we’d sung the song all the way down to two days! Unfortunately, we’d been surprise-quarantined for two weeks after Battle Stations, and it didn’t seem as if anyone knew what was going on, when we’d leave, what the rules were, or anything, really. We were stuck in a depressing limbo of having nothing to do all day every day, but still having to abide by all the strict regulations. Then, as we were marching back to the compartment one night, our cadence-caller (AROC) let loose an interesting variation: He-ere we go again, Same old song again Marching down the avenue, who the f*** knows when we’ll be through… Also after quarantine and Battle Stations, the RDCs started to relax some rules and let us have some fun. While we marched, we always had four “road guards” who wore orange vests and, when called, ran ahead of the formation to stand in the road to block traffic. Our chief had read through the Red Book (boot camp bible for RDCs), and discovered there was no proscription against having the road guards Naruto-run ahead of the division. So guess what we did that day. Something we never did but always joked about trying was a Mass Chaos manuever. In a Mass Right, the RPOC yells “Mass…Right!”, the Port Watch yells “Port watch section prepare to halt”, and the Starboard Watch yells “Starboard section column half right”, followed by the RPOC’s “March!”, when the front half of the formation stops and the back half goes around them so the formation is twice as wide and half as long. Well, in a Mass Chaos, you hear this instead: “Mass…Chaos!” “Port watch section prepare to scream!” “Starboard section prepare to sprint!” “Charge!” That was followed by everyone breaking up, sprinting randomly around and screaming, then forming back up into ranks as if nothing unusual had happened. We were promised we’d do it one night, but quarantine interrupted our plans. I was one of the robot recruits, highly dedicated to getting through boot camp without getting beat (ordered to do a series of painful exercises) at all. I’d managed to perfect my military bearing, neutral tone, and everything else, to a degree that sometimes surprised the RDCs. Petty Officer Pham and I had a running joke about this: he’d call over RDCs from other divisions, call me forward, and ask if I ever felt emotions. My response was always the same: “Petty Officer, I allow myself five minutes of emotion every day while brushing my teeth, Petty Officer!” Another RDC would stop me in the p-way (hallway) whenever he saw me and ask “Recruit, do you know what I’m going to say to you?” “Yes, Petty Officer.” “You have an elevator voice, recruit. Carry on.” As Port Watch, I had a bunch of divisional paperwork to do daily. Once, an RDC caught an error on there and asked me in a deadpan tone if I was trying to make her cry. No, Petty Officer! This one is much, much funnier in retrospect. After some divisional goofing off, we did bunk makeup drills - tearing the sheets and blanket off your bed, crumpling them up, then remaking your bed, all done to precise standards, in set times, and in a very particular way. Because the division had been acting childish, the RDC overseeing this put on some music. Just imagine listening to this on repeat for an hour while making a bed over and over again: I nearly had a PTSD attack listening to five seconds of this to confirm it was the right video. Many of the instructors will try to make you laugh; after all, it’s a lot easier to remember something funny. Our first aid instructor told us that he’d be showing some graphic images, so if we needed to puke, we should turn to the recruit behind us and point to our mouths so they could hold open their blouse to receive it. Later in the presentation, we got to hear about the basic 11 wounds, along with his very memorable foodlike descriptions. We learned how to avoid eyeball soup, make a guts taco, and prevent a fracture hamburger. No one left the class with any sort of appetite."},{"instruction":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Mission To Crack Government Exams's Space · September 29, 2021Answer is : 8+11+21=40https://qr.ae/pGJhyy] [URL: https://qr.ae/pGJhyy]"},{"instruction":"What food is just impossible to eat in a civilized manner?","output":"Korea’s ssam meal.

Regardless of your caste, creed, gender, or economic background, Mumbai can provide you with respect and happiness. There are many cities in the world where one goes for work or just to explore and return to their city with a lot of memories which they cherish for a few days or even weeks to come before they forget about it and get back to their daily routine but once someone comes to the city of dreams, even if it’s for a few days, that person can never truly leave the city.

ALWAYS!! (Remembering one of the greatest headmasters at Hogwarts) It's a fallacy that you have to go to a Gucci or Louis Vuitton store to buy their garments; you can get them for probably 1/100th of the original price on Fashion Street, M.G Road.

Here are some key points to consider: 1. High Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price volatility. Prices can experience rapid and significant fluctuations, which can lead to substantial gains but also substantial losses. If you are not comfortable with this level of volatility, investing in cryptocurrencies may not be suitable for you. 2. Potential Returns: Cryptocurrencies have delivered significant returns for some investors in the past. Bitcoin and some altcoins have seen remarkable price appreciation over the years. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and the market's unpredictable nature means there are no guarantees of continued growth. 3. Diversification: If you already have a well-diversified investment portfolio that includes traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate, adding a small portion of cryptocurrencies may provide diversification benefits. However, going all-in on cryptocurrencies could expose you to higher risks. 4. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Consider your investment horizon. Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile in the short term, but some investors believe in their long-term potential. If you are looking for quick profits, be prepared to monitor the market closely and be ready for the potential of significant price swings. 5. Research and Knowledge: Educate yourself about cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology.

Here are a few important tips to consider: 1. Knowledge and Research: It's crucial to have a deep understanding of the sport you are betting on.

Bankroll Management: Set aside a specific amount of money for betting, known as your bankroll. It's important to manage your bankroll wisely and avoid placing large bets that could lead to significant losses. Stick to a consistent betting strategy based on your bankroll. 3. Discipline and Patience: Successful sports bettors are disciplined and patient. They don't let emotions or impulsive decisions guide their betting choices. Stick to your research and betting strategy, even during losing streaks, and avoid chasing losses. 4. Utilize Multiple Bookmakers: Comparing odds among different bookmakers can help you find the best value and increase your potential profits. Having accounts with multiple bookmakers gives you more options and flexibility when placing bets. 5. Specialize in Specific Markets: Instead of trying to bet on every sport and market, consider specializing in specific markets or leagues where you have extensive knowledge. This allows you to focus your research and potentially increase your chances of making successful bets. 6. Keep a Record: Maintain a detailed record of your bets, including wins, losses, and the reasoning behind each bet. By tracking your performance, you can identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. 7. Stay Informed: Sports betting is dynamic, with odds constantly changing based on various factors such as injuries, team news, and weather conditions. Stay updated with the latest news and developments that could impact the outcome of a match. Remember, while these tips can improve your chances of success in sports betting, there is still an element of luck involved.

It’s not the only possible interpretation: you may be thinking, for example, about triangles with a particular orientation in the plane. Or triangles with a particular position in the plane. Or in space. But I’ll take what seems to me to be the likeliest meaning: there’s exactly one [math](3,4,5)[/math] triangle, and one [math](5,7.3,10.24)[/math] triangle, and so on. Similarly, a square is determined by the length of its side. That’s a single, positive, real number, in contrast with three positive real numbers satisfying some inequalities, which is what we need to name a triangle. So, in terms of sheer cardinality, the set of triangles and the set of squares have the same cardinality: the cardinality of the continuum. The sets [math]R[/math], [math]R^3[/math] and [math]R^n[/math] for any natural [math]n[/math] have the same cardinality. But… this doesn’t feel right, does it? There are more degrees of freedom in specifying a triangle, so can’t we say that there are more triangles? We sure can. Cardinality isn’t the only way of comparing things. It’s the only way of comparing sets, naked sets with no structure, but “the universe of triangles” doesn’t need to be a naked set. We can reasonably think of the collection of triangles as a manifold, with almost-identical triangles being close together and very-different triangles being far apart. As such, the space of squares can reasonably be modeled by [math]R_{>0}[/math], the positive real numbers, and the space of triangles by some subset of [math]R^3[/math], for example the set [math]displaystyle T ={(a,b,c),mid,ale ble c,,,cle a+b}[/math] Every point in this set corresponds to a triangle, and every triangle corresponds to a point, and triangles which have edges of similar lengths are placed at similar points in [math]T[/math]. With that, we can argue that “squares” is a [math]1[/math]-dimensional manifold, and “triangles” is a [math]3[/math]-dimensional manifold with boundary (or some such thing). And this lets us very justifiably assert that there are way more triangles than squares, and in fact we can even say that there are more triangles than rectangles."},{"instruction":"Can you have different front and rear brake pads?","output":"you do."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","output":"Without the amenities you're used to, your choice of accommodation might just end up souring the mood of your trip.

The Existence of a Hotel isn't enough to single-handedly boost a region's tourism but they also give out a symptom of health tourism. The growing tourism industry and hospitality industry has emerged as one of the prime growth factors and Hotel business adds much value to it. 7 Factors to Consider When Choosing a Hotel for Business Trips. Check Hotel Reviews. Make sure the hotel you're choosing has a good reputation. Consider Location. The location of the hotel is an important consideration. Dining Options. Consider Hotel Sanitation. Learn About Their Features. Work Space. Leisure Facilities. LOCATION is very important. Emphasize on location as much as you can because it is one of the most important factors when choosing a hotel. The city or countryside, availability of cabs, nearby malls and other tourist attractions are important things when looking for a hotel. Hospitality matters because it feeds the most basic human need that we all have, to feel loved and accepted. That is not something to overlook. There is a surplus of beauty in providing space for others to feel important, cared for and genuinely loved. It allows us to nurture. According to the recent Amenities Survey carried out across the globe, travellers ranked these as the four most important in-room amenities a hotel could offer. Air conditioning and tea/coffee followed after, while a complimentary breakfast and restaurant ranked as the two most important hotel amenities.

As a non-conformist by nature, I will never understand the desire to blend in and follow the crowd. Why let others dictate who you are and how you should live? Originality and authenticity are far more valuable than conformity.Obsession with image over substance. So many people care more about how they are perceived than who they truly are. They focus on amassing likes, followers, and wealth to boost their image rather than cultivating meaningful relationships and experiences. But image is fleeting, while substance endures.Prioritizing short-term pleasure over long-term happiness. Instant gratification seems to satisfy in the moment but rarely brings lasting fulfillment. Why choose a quick fix when you could take the journey toward deeper and more meaningful happiness?Stubbornness and unwillingness to change. If you're never wrong, you can never learn or grow.

A man who expresses ANY desire to force or coerce a person into continuing a pregnancy against their will is a man who wants to torture another person with more suffering than that man has ever experienced or will ever experience.

He absolutely, positively, without any exceptions, will display shocking sadism and brutality toward any helpless or dependent beings around him. I have known many, many children of anti-choice fathers. ALL anti-choice men abuse their children. If you don’t understand what I mean, I think the documentary “Shiny Happy People” could be quite illustrative. I was raised by Catholic anti-choicers who had very little social overlap with those people, but were still just like them. And ALL anti-choice men rape their wives. They might not have raped you before marriage, or before children, but once they think they have you fully locked down so you can’t leave, they will start raping you. I was the kind of quiet, curious child about whom adults say things like “little jugs have big ears.” I know what anti-choice wives complain about behind closed doors. ALL anti-choice men rape their wives. So if you ever date a man who says anything about “men should get a say” or “a man should have rights.” that is a confession. He is telling you that he intends to horrifically abuse your children and you. Having an anti-choice father is a fate worse than death. I promise you that it is.

More specifically, we do not know whether it was due to climate change, disaster, illness, or… men (or a mix of). This last factor (men) is a sinister one because the huge extinction coincides with the rise of Homo sapiens.

Being low to the ground, we see every speck of dirt, and assist the humans is also taking a closer look at ground level.

They’re okay with us giving them a love lick, but bring out the industry-strength dish-washing detergent when we stick our heads in their half-empty glasses of water. Fine. When they show this level of ingratitude, I use paw to push the glass and water onto the floor.

That’s the thing people don’t get about NASA—it doesn’t chart its own path. NASA is a government agency, which means it does whatever Congress says and only what Congress says. NASA’s vision of the Space Shuttle was quite different from what Congress mandated it build. Congress wanted something that the military could use for polar-orbit missions, which is why the wings were so big (and then the military never used it for that purpose). Congress demanded that the solid rocket booster contract be awarded to Morton Thiokol, which is why the boosters had joints that failed and destroyed the Challenger. NASA is required to do as Congress says. If Congress says “NASA, you’re going to Mars,” NASA says “sir yes sir we’ll start planning a Mars mission sir.” If Congress says “NASA, forget Mars, you’re going to the moon,” NASA says “sir yes sir we’ll start planning a moon mission sir.” If Congress says “NASA, forget rockets and spaceships, you’re arranging flowers now,” NASA says “sir yes sir roses or daffodils sir.” That’s how Federal agencies work."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"The simple answer is that thousands of gallons of jet fuel burning in a relatively closed space easily reached temperatures that caused the structural steel beams that were holding up the immense weight of the building above, to fail.

It’s a not-uncommon thing for middle school teachers to deal with. It’s because of a combination of: girls maturing sooner and faster than boys.boys not realizing that what they’re saying or doing is a form of harassment.girls not knowing how to deal with what’s happening and, sometimes, brushing it off as “normal behavior” and something they just have to learn to deal with. Things like boys snapping a girl’s brastrap, commenting on the fact that they have or haven’t “developed” yet, and pulling their tampons out of their bookbags and putting them on the floor where the classmates will see them… these are all forms of harassment. The boys, and sometimes the girls, don’t realize that they are, so I have to stop it, reprimand the boys, and educate them about these things. For some boys, it’s a losing battle, because what I’m telling them and modeling for them is the opposite of the way their fathers or stepfathers treat women. [Anecdotal tangent here.] It’s been my experience that there’s definitely a difference between cultures when it comes to what counts as “harassment.” When I’ve complained to parents about something their son is doing to harass a female student, parents from some cultures don’t think it’s harassment. They think it’s just “boys being boys.” It’s not my place to judge their culture, but it is my place to control what their son does while in my classroom, so I have to reprimand the son and make sure he doesn’t do it again, even if the parents don’t think it’s wrong."},{"instruction":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","output":"Starting to make money online with affiliate marketing involves strategic steps to build a successful venture: Choose a Niche: Select a niche you're passionate about and knowledgeable in.

Moving away from feminism and towards trust. Love is trust in motion. Super simple, remove the ego power of feminism. Replace it with feminine power of the heart. Evolve women in their hearts to realize value in women. All problems of any society not of ancient background are directly the cause of feminism. Give me any issue, any problem and I’ll show you how it is directly the cause of irresponsible masculine women posing as “women's helpers”. Oh, of course, because I’m here to help. I’m a woman’s advocate. The real kind, you know, where “women have the right to be women”, not have to be turned into men to be accepted. Ego is misery. Heart is joy. Which path are you on? Can you move towards joy? If not, there is something blocking you from your heart? What is that? Take a dive, not to deep, just a conscious look inside. What social dis-ease is rocking your ability to dump your misery machine (ego) and center your heart? The disruptors please stand up. Take a look. Who and what do they look like? Why is hatred being generated inside and not joy? You see? You must break it down for yourself. Responsible men (those of a backbone in charge of their ego) help women stay out of their ego and in their heart. If men or posers as masculine women, are keeping you from your heart, dump them along with their irresponsible ego. Super simple. Moving away from posers of power seeking ego trips and towards those who help you stay in your heart are going to be the ones who you can evolve in your own femininity and move in joy. When a woman can respect a man then the woman respecting will be adored by the man. All problems solved with one move. In the opposite direction of distrusting/ego/feminism. Or is it? If this is the answer, why is it so difficult for love then? Love is extremely easy if: Assuming there is a woman of heart. If not, how would you instill a heart in a woman for the man to adore? Assuming there is a man of backbone. If not, how would you instill a backbone in a man for the woman to respect? Thus, there lies the deeper dive into why this equation makes for the hardest thing in life to solve for, love. What is the most beautiful thing in life, but the hardest to realize? Is this why they say, “the hardest thing to do in life is to find love”? If you allow trust in your heart, love will flow. Who’s stopping you? You, if your ego is in charge. Ego/feminism blocks life/love. Only because men and women seek love and not ego. The ego manifested and not controlled is the equivalent of the devil in charge. No one wants that for anyone or their children. Which is why some very responsible cultures work hard at raising their kids with the basics: Boys - to be in charge of his ego by having a backbone. Girls - to be in charge of her emotions by having a heart. The west puts no effort into it. In fact, to reverse the natural process of love. At an earlier age feminist mothers require girls to irresponsibly abandon their hearts by taking contraception. As well as both genders changing their sex. This is a result of feminism washing the genders' into extinction. All to remove men from being in charge and the head of the culture and family. Fact check: No woman can be happy until she has a man in charge of her. For one reason. Ego is misery and heart is joy. The most love possible is father sky to mother earth. The duality in the universe. Without the electromagnetic field of dual polarity, you fall off the planet. Are you generating universal energy as love, or attempting an ego fight to short circuit it? So life is solving for love? If the equation was based on - Love = trust in motion. Then the variables for each sex… Love for a man = Respect for his backbone as it is in charge of his ego, hers and their extensions. So he can adore a woman who opens his heart. To the degree, adores the extensions. Love for a woman = Adoration of her heart as she is in charge of her emotions by her heart. So she can respect a man who will adore her for respecting him. Then, she has only love for the extension’s. Conclusion: Respecting a man with a backbone, who is responsible for his ego and as the head, his family’s (ego, manifested as a tool for survival does not care and as such, cannot be respected but feared only). Will return the adoration for a woman who is responsible for her emotions with a heart…Problem solved. A family of success or a feminist fail.."},{"instruction":"What are the most amazing photos you have ever taken?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: The most amazing photos I have ever taken were of the beautiful mountain range I stumbled upon during a road trip.

It is vital to address this matter with empathy and understanding, acknowledging that various factors contribute to the high incidence of depression in today's society. Here are a few key reasons why this generation may have a higher incidence of depression: Technology and Social Media: The prevalence of technology, particularly social media, has deeply influenced today's generation. Alongside its advantages, it has brought about challenges. Social media can breed unrealistic comparisons, cyberbullying, and a constant quest for validation, leading to feelings of inadequacy, isolation, and depression. The curated online personas rarely mirror real life, fostering endless self-comparison and negativity. Academic and Professional Pressure: The current generation experiences immense academic and professional pressure. Competitive education systems and the pursuit of high achievement often lead to chronic stress and a sense of not measuring up. The fear of failure, combined with societal expectations, can contribute to depression and anxiety disorders. Financial Stress: Today's generation has experienced economic instability, with recessions, increasing living expenses, and limited job opportunities. The weight of student loans and the need for stable employment can cause significant financial stress, which is strongly associated with mental health problems, such as depression. Stigma and Accessibility to Mental Health Support: The stigma surrounding mental health persists, preventing many from seeking help due to fear of judgement or limited access to resources. Initiatives like [LINKED_TEXT: Talk To Big Ears] [URL: https://talktobigears.com/]’ Listening Sessions, provides a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and receive support without fear of judgement. The high incidence of depression among today's generation is a multifaceted problem. It is essential to tackle it holistically by promoting mental health awareness, providing effective support, and fostering a society that prioritizes well-being. By empathizing with and comprehending the obstacles confronting this generation, we can strive for a healthier and more supportive tomorrow."},{"instruction":"w do you politely tell your neighbor that they are mowing their grass too short?","output":"Did they ask for advice?

The longer answer follows. If you’re talking about dimming the actual LED chips, then you need to work back from that to the driver to a compatible dimmer. Assuming you’re talking about a complete fixture or lamp, then the answer is more complex. First, dimming. There are, broadly, three ways to dim an LED lamp or fixture. Line voltage. There are a range of technologies including resistance, triac, SCR, IGBT, that control the voltage, switching, or current to the end load. These technologies require no extra wiring to the device. Most dimmable lamps are intended to be dimmed with one of these types of dimmers.Low voltage. Generally 0–10V, this requires four wires to the devices—two for power and two for the low-voltage dimming.Digital. The most prevalent are DALI and DMX. There are also a host of proprietary protocols from various manufacturers. Most wallbox (standard household or commercial) wall dimmers are designed for line-voltage dimming and use either triacs or (less frequently) resistance to dim the load. These are inexpensive and very common dimmers—and so the majority of line-voltage dimmable LED fixtures are compatible with them. Fixture manufacturers will test and many publish lists of compatible dimmers for their fixtures."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?","output":"Angular is based on TypeScript while AngularJS is based on JavaScript.

True compassion is just doing what’s needed.” That is to say, you have no preferences or agenda of your own. You are not being kind to be liked by others, to feel good, or impress. You are not indulging your own feelings by being tangled in a situation. You are not over-identifying yourself with the other person; you are not projecting. You don’t think of reward. This helps you to avoid pressure i.e. manipulation aka being taken advantage of. When you meet the situation (in person or via media), you will decide how to respond. If you want to, and you can, then do it; if you don’t, don’t enact self-feeding drama about it. This kind of honesty brings relief. Kindness needs to be in everyone’s heart. Compassion is doing what’s needed. That’s all. Will you light for warmth, devotion, for show, or for real?

For this sequence, n = 10 (there are 10 numbers), the first term is 1, and the last term is 10. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: sum = (10/2)(1+10) sum = 5(11) sum = 55 Therefore, the sum of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 is 55.Thanks, me later"},{"instruction":"What would you do if you woke up beside Kamala Harris?","output":"I’m a good looking man so I can understand Kamala wanting a piece of the action"},{"instruction":"What is the reason for the 4 seasons?","output":"Five seasons would be to many!"},{"instruction":"Should I repair my own rental properties or hire a contractor?","output":"You don’t say how handy you are.

What you are talking about is what physicists call CAUSALITY. Causality is a pain in the ass, for a very simple reason. We can sort of play around with TIME, when it comes to photons. And that is because photons can be superimposed, and because all measurements of time are relative. And that means that even when photons are superimposed, there is a causal relationship. The “information” can only transfer at the speed of light. But the actual “measurement of time” can be as reduced or as extended to make everything FIT inside an “event horizon”. You already know of two types of event horizon, one associated with black holes and one associated with the big bang. But this idea that every event has to FIT INSIDE an event horizon of both BEFORE and AFTER comes from the fact that a fundamental assumption is that causality is always conserved. We can say that we have two EVENT STREAMS. One where the “spacing between events” is one set of time measurements, and one where the “spacing between events” is another set of time measurement. And therefore we can even ASSUME a type of superposition of UNCONNECTED EVENTS inside that event horizon bounded by both BEFORE and AFTER. If they are unconnected, then it does not make a difference what ORDER they are in the event stream. But here is the problem. Where in the physics does it say which events are connected, and which events are not connected? We can imagine (or assume) singularities INSIDE the black hole or BEFORE the big bang. But there is just to much that is “connected” in the part of the unverse that is not “sub-quanta”, bearing in mind that even “quantum events” are not the same as those that we can OBSERVE all the time, and not just at the point of COHERENCE. I have used a lot of “significant words” here, and I make no excuses for this. Photons are “spooky things. We need to be precise about what we mean. But your question just might be a very very good one. Because what you are talking about is CAUSALITY. There will always be a sequence of events that HAVE to take place in a certain order, even with sub-quanta things. Or maybe not. Maybe time is quantised too, and quanta time therefore can also be superimposed. Let us go to an often misunderstood analogy - that of Schrodinger’s cat. When the door is closed, we can say that the cat - standing in for the sub-atomic particle with a state - can have two superimposed states. Alive and dead. But if we play around with time, we can now say that the cat can have only the one “superimposed in time” state, and two different times for it to be “resolved” in so that we can OBSERVE that resolved state. Now this is nonsense, in the sense that there is no need to make things more complicated. We can say that causality is conserved at the point of resolution, and leave it at that.The cat is dead, and whatever happens after that will not change the past. The cat is alive, and whatever happens after that will not change the past. Now that I have got your hopes up that perhaps we can quantise time and play around with causality for photons, we can’t. Photons do not experience time, quantised or otherwise.Photons do not experience state. They have no state. They are like “spooky messengers” that transfer “information” at the speed of light, and do not violate causality in what states are caused by others.And this is true even if the actual measurement of times by an observer will be different, in between different EVENTS unless the events inside that “horizon” are not CONNECTED. But your question is still good. Even though photons do not experience time or state - and therefore causality is not something we have to worry about for them, the electrons the photons interact with do have state. The electrons do experience time. So if we have any causal relationship, then right at the start that causal relationship HAS to be conserved in the entire CONNECTED universe. And that means if we can violate causality, the universe is not connected. We can have superposition in anything we can observe. Not just electrons - we do not really observe the photon, just the change of state of the electron. Meaning that the cat analogy can be real. The cat can be both alive and dead. So something has to give. If electrons can be superimposed, but not cats, then we have to be able to show that only within that “event horizon” where we can have superposition can we violate any causality in the order of the elements in that “block of time”. But the electron only transfers “information” about itself at the speed of causality. To use a very bad analogy, there may be two elements in that “state” of the electron, but when that state is resolved, there is only one that is caused or causing. So it really isn’t photons or electrons that have a problem with causality. The photon really does not get involved, because it is only the messenger of “information” that sets up the causal relationship. And that means there is no “sequence” in that photon that is carried by it. The photon really is not associated with time at all, only the time limitation on “information” being transferred by the speed of light, by it."},{"instruction":"Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?","output":"That’s where we live Our solar system The distance between Earth and the moon When all the planets are put together, that’s what the distance between Earth and the moon is.

Be your practice partner: Once you begin learning English, eradicate every other language from your day-to-day conversation, first with yourself, and then, with other. Be your practice partner in the initial days. Talk to yourself loudly in English. Stand in front of a mirror and practice speaking in English. You can select a topic and start speaking on it before the mirror. Pay attention to every single word that you speak. This is the best way to improve your English communication skills and develop public speaking skills. Listen to English: Watch English movies and series. Take help from the YouTube channels. Repeat what you hear. This will also improve your communication skills in English. Sing English songs: When you begin to learn English, everything must be in English. Wear your headphones and play some English music. Try to sing along. Read magazines and blogs: Read English magazines and online blogs. They use easy English which will help you to understand the basic words at the initial stages. You must also develop a habit of reading English books of your interest. You must read English content as much as possible. Build your vocabulary: Learn new words. Once you are done with the basics of English language, it is the time for taking a step further. Read novels and find out new words. Underline them, find their meaning and memorize them. There are many vocabulary books that could help you in building a strong vocabulary. Learn sayings and phrases: Learn the phrases and sayings as they create an impact while speaking. Practice speaking them out louder.

She's not obliged to go through a pregnancy because the man wants to support and be there for the child. If she does agree to go through the pregnancy, she's not necessarily going to be stepping up and taking care of said child. If she says she does not want children, don't assume she'll change her mind. I would recommend discussing these scenarios with a prospect partner/wife once the relationship gets serious.

Do you really think it is even remotely reasonable to get rid of your dog (whether it is for therapy or not) over some jerk you've only dated for ONE MONTH? If they cared about you that much, they wouldn't make you feel like you should be considering it to begin with. But the fact that you are is concerning and I think you should break up with your partner and go to therapy for codependency…because that is what that is. You're wanting to make radical life changes for someone you barely know, that could have negative effects on you psychologically. That is not good. I am not trying to sound mean or judgemental. Codependency is extremely common. But you need to learn to break free from that mentality so you can have a healthy relationship. Plus you'll be happier.

The gandhiv made him capable to hold the position of mahanayak also, it is the gandhiv which helped him to carry some most destructive weapons in his possession.

Along with these astras, arjun was also capable to wield Sudarshan Chakra, which no other than krishna can hold. Arjun was a Maharathi, and was close to being a Mahamaharathi. A Maharathi is someone who is capable to defeat 12 Atirathis at a moment. But arjun was capable of subduing 4–5 Maharathis at a time. Then he is capable enough to defeat 48–60 Atirathis at a time and 576–720 Rathis at a moment. So we can easily calculate his ultimate power as a Maharathi. But Arjuna was not a ordinary Maharathi. Most people misunderstood arjun or predict him as overrated, because of his mental breakdown before battle, thus resulted Bhagavad-gītā. But if we try to understand that, how difficult it is for a righteous person to kill his own innocent family members who are bind to support adharmis. Arjun was indeed a Mahanayak, and was capable of ending the war in a day by other restricted weapons, i.e. Brahmastra, Vaishnavastra, Brahmadand. But his biggest strength was his charioteer, lord Krishn. He can, let his friend down. [LINKED_TEXT: Ayush R.

The first reason is that the electronic configuration of 2 8 8 8 3 is more stable than an ion of Cu 3. The second reason is that copper is a transition metal, and transition metals tend to form ions with a +2 charge. The third reason is that copper has a relatively low first ionization energy, which means it takes less energy to remove one electron from a copper atom than it does for other elements."},{"instruction":"Jared Kushner said that he can’t commit to having the presidential election on 11/3.

Forge welding consists of heating two pieces of metal to near their melting point and then hammering them together. Properly done, they become one piece. In many cases, the metals will form an oxide layer while (or even before) being heated. To prevent this a flux is usually used. The flux is a substance that melts at a temperature lower than the melting temperature of the base metal, dissolves the oxides and spreads across the base metal keeping it from oxidation. Borax is the most commonly used flux, but pure white silica sand will work. There are many proprietary fluxes on the market. Forge welding can be done without flux, but to do so one needs to keep the metal in a very low oxygen area of the fire The same principle is involved in “cannister welding” where the metals to be welded are in a sealed steel box with an oxygen scavenger. Some metals forge weld easily, and others are almost impossible to weld. High Chromium alloys are very hard to weld because chromium oxide is resistant to all common fluxes. Forge welding is combined with other processes. In making laminated steel (often incorrectly called Damascus) a forge welded billet is folded and welded back to itself. The folding is NOT part of the welding process, but often folows welding a billet."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"Many people think that we are an electrical engineer, so we should be omnipotent, so 1.

However, the ball would not necessarily reach the Earth's surface, depending on the initial velocity and direction of the throw. If the ball is thrown with enough speed and in the right direction, it could enter into a stable orbit around the Earth, just like a satellite. On the other hand, if the initial velocity of the throw is not high enough to enter a stable orbit, the ball would eventually fall towards the Earth due to the force of gravity. As the ball falls towards the Earth, it would accelerate due to the increasing gravitational force, and eventually, it would reach a very high speed as it approaches the Earth's surface. The ball would experience air resistance as it falls through the Earth's atmosphere, which would slow down its descent and eventually cause it to come to a stop or land on the Earth's surface. The exact path and outcome of the ball's trajectory towards Earth would depend on several factors, including the initial velocity, direction, and the effects of air resistance"},{"instruction":"Which smartphone is best for middle class people?","output":"Probably redmi note 7, redmi note 7 pro, realme 3 , and the upcoming realme 3 pro"},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

Great question, and I'd be happy to help you understand the difference between Windows 10 Home and Windows 11 Pro. Think of it like upgrading from a cozy little apartment to a spacious penthouse in the digital world. Windows 10 Home is like that trusty old apartment where you do all your day-to-day stuff. It's perfect for casual users and families. You get all the essential features, like the Start Menu, Microsoft Edge browser, Cortana, and Windows Defender for security. It's like your comfy space, but you might have a few limitations when it comes to customization and advanced security features. Now, picture Windows 11 Pro as that penthouse suite. It's got all the cool perks of Windows 10 Home, but with some awesome upgrades. You get advanced security features like BitLocker encryption to keep your data super safe, and you can join a corporate network with ease. Virtualization and remote desktop features are your new best buddies if you're into that kind of thing. Plus, you'll have more control over Windows updates, which is like having your own personal butler making sure everything's in tip-top shape. Now, let me share a little story from my own digital life. Back in the day, I was juggling between Windows 10 Home and Windows 11 Pro for different tasks. I used Windows 10 Home for streaming movies, checking social media, and all the fun stuff. But when it came to my freelance graphic design gigs, [LINKED_TEXT: Windows 11 Pro ] [URL: https://digitalsoftwarekey.com/]was my go-to. The extra security layers and performance boosts really helped me run resource-hungry design software without a hitch.

So, when choosing between the two, think about what kind of digital journey you're embarking on – whether it's a leisurely stroll or a high-speed race to productivityville!"},{"instruction":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

Sometimes you get goosebumps when he starts talking and overthinking. This is something that happens to lots of smart people. Smart people have often a hard time focusing on the obvious. While there is one thing to do, they process many thoughts in parallel. Then it can happen that these thoughts intermix. While they say one thing, they think something else. They stutter, they start talking about one thing, and suddenly seem to jump into a completely different topic. I have met many smart people not being able to get to the point while people who were less smart dominated discussions. There is another aspect to it. Smart people often are aware that the truth is manifold. Meaning: If they say A, they know they say A, but at the same time - with more data available A can be wrong, but B or C can be right. And not just that, if you change your viewpoint, you may even discover that A and B might be right. It is just a matter of perspective.

A confident person exhibits competence in a natural and effortless way. How to practice self-confidence? So far we have talked about the definition and importance of self-confidence. Thus, it makes sense to discuss how anyone who is struggling with low confidence can develop it in real life. Here are some ways to boost your confidence and start a new life Photoshop your self-image Our self-image has a much deeper effect on us than it has on others. You might not realize but the way you see or think of yourself is what you become in reality. Discard negative thoughts It goes hand-in-hand with the above point but it deserves to be discussed separately. Negative thoughts are one of the reasons that might restrict your growth in life. Get rid of them as early as possible. Dress for success Confident folks like to dress smart, crisp, and to-the-point because they know that the way you dress makes a lot of difference in how confident you feel. Wearing nice clothes can help you leave a long-lasting impression on others. Empower yourself with knowledge One of the essential things that automatically sparks confidence is knowledge and expertise in a niche. It’s easy to sense confidence when you hear someone speaking about something they know. Empowering yourself with knowledge is a sure-shot way to build self-confidence. Remember, it’s a process…. Confidence is a state of mind more than anything else. It’s one of those useful qualities that gives you the ability to try new things, take more risks, and achieve more. It’s a long-term process, not a one time gig. If you combine it with other essential traits like hard work, patience, resilience, and problem-solving skills, you can easily achieve anything in life.S Source : [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/self-confidence-key-unlock-your-potential-sandeep-kashyap/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details%3Bf%2FNdJgAnTlyrGBtP%2BjTZuQ%3D%3D] [URL: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/self-confidence-key-unlock-your-potential-sandeep-kashyap/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details%3Bf%2FNdJgAnTlyrGBtP%2BjTZuQ%3D%3D]"},{"instruction":"What information should entrepreneurs invoicing new clients for the first time include in the paperwork?","output":"Include: Amount due.Description of what the invoice is for. Be detailed enough so that the client will know what it’s for, and so that a year from now you can trace what it was for. This is especially important if you end up issuing multiple invoices to a client — at some point you may need to reconcile payments with amounts still outstanding.Due date. Sometimes this is abbreviated to [LINKED_TEXT: common commercial terms] [URL: https://www.mycreditcontrollers.co.uk/Articles/list-of-invoice-payment-terms.html]. You might use something like “Upon Receipt” (i.e., due immediately) or “Net 30” (due within 30 calendar days) or “2/10 Net 30″ (due within 30 calendar days, but if paid within 10 days the client can deduct a 2% discount).Your payee name. Make sure this the same as whatever is on your bank account. This is for several reasons, including so that if the client sends you a paper check you can deposit it into your bank account without hassle. (Some banks are picky about mismatched payee / account names and may reject a deposit, forcing you to go back for a replacement check.)Mailing address for paper checks.Contact info. Include a phone number and/or email address. Questions sometimes do come up, and you want your client to be able to contact you.EIN number. This is your Federal tax ID number issued by the IRS. It may be on your W-9 form, but it’s good idea to include it on your invoice, too, as later on the paperwork may get separated.Your completed IRS W-9 form if you are operating as an individual or an LLC. The payor will need this for tax purposes in the United States, if the amount paid to you is at least 600.Invoice number. While this is not essential, assigning a unique number to every invoice helps reconcile payments later and keeps your accounting straight. So it’s a good practice to do.Thank You message. Don’t forget to include a brief and friendly “Thank you for your business” type of statement. The above are the main things to include with every invoice. However, depending on the particular client or how payment is to be made, you may also include: Credit card payment button. If you accept credit card payments and you send electronic invoices, try to include a button for PayPal or another shopping cart. This way, the recipient can hit a button to pay as soon as they receive the invoice. It increases your likelihood of getting paid faster.ACH info. If you accept electronic ACH payments, include bank account information (bank name, bank account number and bank routing number). This is for direct deposit payments to your bank account, when both parties are within in the United States.Wire transfer info. For international wire transfers coming to the U.S., include a Swift code also.Purchase order number. Some large clients use purchase orders for certain transactions. So if one was issued in your case, you need to put the number on the invoice so they can cross reference their records.Any special Terms documents. Some large clients require their own purchasing/payables terms be adopted as part of the invoice documentation, to supersede any terms you have. Large clients dictate the terms to smaller vendors. In a couple of instances we were required to sign off on and attach the client’s Ts and Cs document to every invoice. Don’t be surprised if they give themselves early payment discounts and longer payment deadlines as part of their purchasing Ts and Cs, too! Finally, a word about VAT. Some European clients will request a VAT number. Most U.S. entrepreneurs or small businesses can simply respond “not applicable”. European companies ask as standard operating procedure. However, smaller businesses in the United States almost never have a VAT number (nor do you want to get one if you can avoid it!). We in the U.S. are not required to pay VAT taxes except in circumstances where we might have a substantial European connection. If you are required to pay VAT, due to your unique circumstances, you probably know this already."},{"instruction":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","output":"For videos of coaching classes you can join @VideoLecturesIAS"},{"instruction":"What is the best way for preparing for GATE CSE?","output":"Hi ! i have given GATE CSE exam so i think i am qualified to answer it.

It is an impossible task to answer this very unspecific and broad question as it has so many layers and it lends itself to provoke a fierce debate that leaves one even more confused than one was before asking. Broadly speaking, music of any kind is primarily processed by our limbic system, or “the reptile brain”, that is the primary center of emotions. It is then assessed by the higher centres of the brain and its effect on an individual is then rationalised, and intellectualised in a better case, and an individual opinion is then formed and argued. The fact that we don’t have billions of different tastes is based on our common evolution of our emotional system. A myriad of individual factors in our lives is then responsible for individual perceptions and tastes. Heavy metal/hard rock is by its impact on the dopaminergic/ adrenerdic systems and that leads to a secondary increase of prolactin, the love hormone”, this creating an immense perception of emotional well-being of the individual. Similar to some drugs and antidepressants. Make your own conclusions from here. From my point of view each one of the two bands successfully repeat this recipe on each of their albums, sometimes ad nauseam, with varying degree of quality of their music. Many other groups do, e.g. Status Quo, Queen etc etc. To me Iron Maiden are better businessmen, thanks to Bruce, Judas Priest are a bit more adventurous, i.e. Nostradamus.

I remember I even cried with emotion at Natural Born Killers when stoned… (such a beautiful murderous couple they were)… Alcohol goes very well with nicely cooked food I’m happy to eat pomegranates like apples when stoned, pith and all (quartered obviously)… It’s a messy experience! The ability to actually enjoy eating a pomegranates like an apple when stoned is a gift from the gods… Alcohol, in moderation, boosts my confidence… Weed, in any quantity, makes me more hesitant… But on the plus side, it makes playing videogames much more intense… So, I don’t know… there’s a time and place for both. I’ve been through stages in my life where I’ve combined the two but I’ve found that is not a good combination for me. I just become unresponsive and want to sleep. Overall, by nature, I would say I’m probably more of a weed person (as I’m naturally fairly introverted), but from a health perspective I would rather not smoke any more (and haven’t beyond a couple of drags in seven years), so would say by default alcohol just about wins out.

Bring the brain biopsy tray in here to the bedside, this is an emergency” The patient experienced an immediate and miraculous recovery before we could get started. She walked out of the ER without any further treatment. In the ENT world, we are always amazed at the people with “hearing loss” as a result of their work seeking compensation.

In my experience, fairly radical changes in design, component shape, materials, and even design approach happen over and over again in these early design phases. If you’ve got a design history file right from that first conversation, you have to deal with all of the “weight” of organizational process in your SOP. You really want to start the design history file, IMHO, when you’ve got clarity that the design is fit for purpose, manufacturable, and meets the commercial considerations. Note that many regulatory people really do feel otherwise, that the best practice is to start the design history file early. Perhaps someone with that background will chime in to defend the idea.

Combine the lemon juice and water. Add 1 cup (237 ml) of water and ½ cup (118 ml) of fresh lemon juice to a glass or plastic bottle. Shake the bottle well to ensure that the ingredients are well mixed. For best results, use filtered, distilled, or bottled water. Lemon juice can help remove excess oil, tighten pores, and kill bacteria. Be sure to use a bottle that can hold at least 12 ounces for the toner. 2. Dampen a cotton pad with the toner and apply it to your face. When you’re ready to use the toner, wet a cotton pad or ball with it. Gently stroke it over your face, paying special attention to areas where you get most oily. If you prefer, you can place the lemon toner in a spray bottle and mist your face with the toner. Allow your skin to absorb it before moving on your skin care routine. Toner is a great way to prep the skin for your other skincare products. Try to apply the toner right after your cleanser so it can break down any leftover residue. 3. Follow up with sunscreen during the day. While lemon juice can help improve the look of oily skin, it also lightly exfoliates, which can leave your face more sensitive to the sun. Protect your skin by applying a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 if you’ve applied the toner during the day. Method 2 of 4:Creating a Moisturizing Toner for Dry Skin1. Mix all of the ingredients in a spray bottle. In a clean, plastic spray bottle, combine ¼ cup (59 ml) of witch hazel, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vegetable glycerin, 2 teaspoons (10 g) of aloe vera gel, ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of colloidal silver, 5 drops of lavender essential oil, 3 drops of roman chamomile essential oil, 5 drops of sweet orange essential oil, 2 drops of carrot seed essential oil, and enough filtered water to fill the bottle. Shake the bottle gently to mix all of the ingredients. The colloidal silver is an optional ingredient, but it helps preserve the toner so it lasts longer and treats skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, and psoriasis. Be sure to store the toner in a cool, dark spot. You can store it in the refrigerator to help it last longer, but it should be good for up to 6 months even at room temperature. 2. Spray onto a clean face. When you’re ready to use the toner, wash your face with your usual facial cleanser. Next, gently mist the toner over your face and wait 2 to 3 minutes for your skin to absorb it before moving on to the next step in your skincare routine. If you prefer, you can spray the toner on a cotton pad or square, and wipe it over your entire face. 3. Apply a moisturizer. After your skin has absorbed the toner, it’s important to hydrate your face. Use your usual moisturizer, and massage it into your skin to keep your skin smooth and supple. It’s all right if your skin is still slightly damp from the toner when you apply the moisturizer. That will help lock in the moisture. Method 3 of 4:Whipping Up an Apple Cider Vinegar for Acne-Prone Skin1. Combine all of the ingredients. In a glass or plastic bottle, mix together 1 cup (237 ml) of filtered water, 1 cup (237 ml) of raw apple cider vinegar, and 3 drops of tea tree oil. Shake the bottle gently to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined. Use an airtight container that can hold at least 16 ounces for the toner. The toner recipe calls for 1 part water and 1 part apple cider vinegar, so you can adjust it accordingly to make as much or as little as you’d like. 2. Wet a cotton pad with the toner and rub over your face. When you’re ready to use the toner, dampen a cotton square, ball, or pad with the mixture. Next, gently rub it over your entire face after washing it, paying particular attention to areas where you usually get acne. Don’t rinse the toner off. You can also store the toner in a spray bottle and mist it over your face if you prefer. 3. Use your usual acne treatment products. After you’ve applied the toner, wait 2 to 3 minutes so your skin can fully absorb it. Next, apply your usual acne treatment products, such as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, to treat your breakouts. Method 4 of 4:Mixing Up a Rose Water Toner for Sensitive Skin1. Add the salt and oils to a glass bottle. Drop a pinch of salt to the bottom of a 5 ounce or larger glass bottle. Next, add 3 drops of lavender essential oil and 3 drops of frankincense essential oil. The salt will help disperse the essential oils throughout the toner. If you don’t have lavender or frankincense essential oils, you can use 6 drops of your favorite essential oils instead. Just make sure that they aren’t oils that irritate your skin. 2. Mix in the witch hazel and rose water. With the salt and essential oils in the glass bottle, pour in 3 ounces (90 ml) of witch hazel and 1 ounce (30 ml) of rose water. Shake the bottle gently to mix all of the ingredients until they are thoroughly combined. The toner doesn’t need to be stored in the refrigerator, but it can be very refreshing to chill it during warmer months. 3. Test the toner on your skin to see how it reacts. If you have sensitive skin, you have to be careful about applying new products to it. To make sure that the toner will work for your skin, test a small amount of it on a small patch of skin, such as behind your ear or along your jaw. Wait 24 to 48 hours to see if you have a reaction. If you don’t, you can use the toner freely. 4. Apply the toner to a cotton ball or pad and run it over the face. After you’ve washed your face with your normal face wash, wet a cotton pad or ball with the toner. Gently run the cotton all over your face to apply the toner.

This and hell are not true.My NDE. Over 30 years ago I overdosed on pure PCP. I bought it from the chemist who made it. Uncut. Its a horse trankquilser. I had no idea. I started snorting a line every 4 hours. Two days,no sleep. At first it was nice. Pure white light, enhanced senses.That changed. I started to trip,HARD. I took off my clothes, got in bed and went to hell. I'm smelling sulfur, seeing bats with human heads, huge snakes, screaming humans, witches, flames and darkness everywhere.etc. I remember looking at the clock, it's 9:00 pm. I thought hours and hours and hours had gone by, looked again, it's 9:01pm. One minute.This started on Friday night, I came out of it on Sunday morning. I truly believed if I stopped breathing, I'd be there forever and ever and ever. In all this hell there was a blip of light \\"up there\\". I concentrated on 2 things, the light and breathing. My mind went into a loop: good,bad,good,bad,good bad. No concept of time, total madness,absolute fear. I woke up on Sunday morning and birds are singing. I flushed the drug and touched no hallucinogens for over 2 years. I've done LSD 100's of times. Never a bad trip. Just wonder and joy. PCP compared to LSD, is like comparing a fifth of whiskey to a shot of beer. Total mind insanity. I told this to a doctor who was writing a book on the effects of natural hallucinogens on the human phych. He said, \\"That amount, that long, pure? \\"\\" Yep\\". He asked if I believed in God. I said, \\"Very much so, I'm a Christian.\\" He explained that much pure PCP could have stopped my heart or given a brain anyerism. He also said he could take me to mental institutions, where the patients are catatonic and had consumed less then me. You put their hand up, it stays up until you put it down. The drug can short circuit the synapse in the brain. He said,\\"Most come out, some don't\\". He said my faith saved me. I totally agree. I was 27, I'm now 70. I study a book called A Course in Miracles, everyday. I highly recommend!!! Pure Truth! I naturally believed in hell,for years, because I had experienced it. The Course taught me it was all an attack by the wrong side of my mind, my ego. Ego is based on fear. Fear of what? In the deepest part of our sub-conscious,God.The right side of my mind, my spirit, brought me out of it. The Spirit was the light I concentrated on. Spirit is based on love. The fruits of fear are: worry, hate, depression, anxiety, judgement, poor me,etc. The fruits of love are: peace, joy, strength, wisdom, integrity, humor, giving, forgiveness,etc. We are all bi-polar and our mind is extremely powerful. We have free will and we choose, everyday, which we want to follow. When we choose spirit, The Holy Spirit helps us to un-do our ego. It's like an onion, you peel off a layer and it still looks like an onion. Eventually it dissapears. When our ego is gone, we'll wake up in our true Reality. Heaven. The best tool we possess is to forgive all the perceived wrong that happened in our past. Forgive all the wrong insanity we look at everyday. The wars, the corruption, the crime, the hate, the greed, the criminals, the \\"elite\\", the satanists, the pollution,etc. Forgive All, Always. There is no hell and no satan. This ego lie was made up to have us look for our enemy, out there. When our true enemy is our ego. We are, our own worst enemy. The beauty is we have the power to change this. The Course explains much, however it's beyond the scope of the text to explain Love. Love is not an emotion. Love is the most powerful Force in all of Creation. Every time you hold open a door, give up your place in line, give to the poor, give back too much change, never becoming angry, never becoming jealous, helping others, forgiving. You love. Once I understood and accepted. God IS. I began praying, studying, reading to learn all about The Prime Creator. The Source who made every atom, every molocue, all the animals, all the sea creatures, the harmony of nature, all the humans, all the planets, all the suns, all the stars, all the galaxies, all the universes. All life. Everywhere. Who creats and recreates all the time and is absolutele power and love. I am still learning everyday. Where's God? Everywhere. Even better, His Voice is within us. A couple weeks ago, I came up with a new prayer. This happened when I was tossing and turning and couldn't fall asleep. The results I experienced were amazing. The prayer goes, \\"Holy Spirit, for my highest good and the highest of all, help me to achieve perfection in listening to the Sacred Silence between my thoughts. \\" Instantly, I had no questions about anything. None. I really wasn't consciously taught [LINKED_TEXT: http://anything.My] [URL: http://anything.my/] sub- conscious was taught much.I just know. I felt an awareness of a very deep love for myself and all. This awareness is still growing, and I extend it out to all of Creation. And I experienced peace. I feel a peacful mind is a very great gift. Once you feel this Love and Peace, extend it out to All. Everywhere. The supply is infinite, eternal and limitless. I am certainly not unique. You can experience this also. All you have to do is ask from your heart. You may not experience as immediately as I did. But you WILL experience. Pray this every night and see what happens.

Why not? What's your problem? Is it your money or the government money being spent? It's our Hindu money not yours. So why are you getting disturbed?"},{"instruction":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee? What will be the consequences?","output":"Our economy will collapse. Here's why: Most of the investments that come to our country come knowing our labor is cheaper. Why is that an advantage? Because a basic confortable life is more affordable here than elsewhere and that our labor has lesser bargaining power than elsewhere - Food is cheaper in India than in the USWe are the world's 2nd largest producer of cotton - clothing taken care ofHealthcare is one of the cheapest in the worldHousing yes, is very expesive. Even after all of our important expenditures we save good money. Hence, labor is cheaper in India as compared with the US. Of course, our healthcare system needs to be reformed, our agriculture needs reofrms; but on a given day, we survive pretty well. That is their biggest incentive for a foreign investor to invest in India. If our currency appreciates so much that 1 USD can buy only 1 INR, they will have to be paying as much as they pay in the US. That is because, the goods and services we consume in India will equal those consumed in the US in value (for example, they may have 20 ice creams for 2 Dollars each & we may consume 40 mangos for 1 each; but the value is basically the same - 40). So basically a disproportionate increse in costs, which no company would like. And if they will shut shop in India, we will all lose our jobs. And the party begins. Another important thing that happens is our exports get costlier in the market if INR appreciates so much. That is because the price of goods & services consumed here will be valued higher in the USD when our currency is devalued/undervalued. The same way, our imports get costlier & we try to substitute them by producing domestically. Those of us who studied Economics may recall this: (if you did not study Economics, please skip the diagram & the next paragraph. Seriously, it will confumse you.) The price of USD-INR has fallen and that will buy fewer goods & services than previously; and because supply will not change in the short term, the short run Aggregate Supply (SAS) will meet the shifted Demand curve lower than previously. And hence, GDP will fall.

In case you are wondering, China is facing an economic problem because their labor started demanding more. That is one of the biggest reasons why China is facing an economic problem.

Here's how: 1. Find the tangential velocity at the equator: The Earth's radius is about [math]6.3cdot10^6 m[/math], and the Earth rotates [math]2pi rad[/math] every 86164 seconds (one sidereal day). Therefore, tangential velocity is: [math]dfrac{distance}{time} Rightarrow dfrac{2picdot6.3cdot10^6}{86164} approx 464 m/s[/math]. 2. Now that you have velocity, use [math]frac{v^2}{r}[/math] to get centripetal acceleration: [math]dfrac{464^2}{6.3cdot10^6} approx 0.034 m/s^2[/math]. 3. Multiply the centripetal acceleration by [math]-1cdot[/math](your mass) to get the centrifugal force on your body (the -1 is because centrifugal force is in the opposite direction as centripetal force). For example, if you weigh 70kg then the centrifugal force is about [math]-70kgcdot0.034 m/s^2 = -2.38 Newtons[/math] 4. Divide Newtons by [math]9.8 m/s^2[/math] (acceleration rate of gravity) to get the difference in weight at the equator vs the poles: [math]dfrac{-2.38 N}{9.8 m/s^2} = -0.243kg[/math] (about 0.3 percent). To find the weight difference at a location other than the equator, just multiply the acceleration (464 m/s) by the cosine of your latitude. For myself, at about 45 degrees north, this calculation gives: [math]-70cdotfrac{(464cdotcos(45))^2}{6.3cdot10^6} approx -1.19 N[/math], which is a weight difference of just under 0.2 percent."},{"instruction":"Why is Lord Nelson considered as one of the most loved leaders of the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars?","output":"His crews liked him because he was a first-class commander of men, not harsh or lax, and he kept his men healthy with fresh food.

When his arm was shattered at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1797, he told the surgeon, “Doctor, I want to get rid of this useless piece of flesh here.”Nelson turned down the safer sea commands that might have enriched him with prize money in favor of dangerous attacks on the enemy.Nelson was an extremely aggressive warrior who constantly wanted to find and fight the French, Danish, and Spanish fleets.At Copenhagen, he disobeyed orders to retire and won a victory by continued fighting.

You must know the important topics which score more marks in GATE exam. The better ways are to make a list of topics on a page and make a priority according to carry more marks. Difficult to follow online exam As GATE is now conducted online exam, so it has been difficult for that student who has the habit of giving offline exams like with paper and pencil. I suggest students to start giving exams online like. If you practice online then it won’t be a problem for the student to face the difficulties in GATE 2018 and also helps in managing time and strategies to solve in the exam. I have tried to discuss all the common mistake students make while preparing for GATE exam and how to overcome these problems.

Could that be why Thanos broke it so easily?","output":"No, not at all. If it was medal, even hitting Thanos with it would dent it horribly with ease. Plus, it took way too many blows for that to be a metal shield. Why did it break then? It’s nearly a century old and has suffered a lot of explosions and other things.Vibranium is the strongest on Earth, and it’s not indestructible and it’s weaker than Adamantanium.If it even wasn’t Vibranium, it had to be something strong enough to survive a couple blows like gold titanium.The shield was meant to receive blows on its middle, not the edges hence the reason it was able to get destroyed and then destroy it better."},{"instruction":"What are the most touristic countries in the world?","output":"The most beautiful places in the world are subjective and can vary greatly based on personal preference, but here are some that are commonly considered to be stunning: Santorini, Greece: Known for its white-washed buildings, blue-domed churches, and stunning views of the Aegean Sea.Venice, Italy: A city built on water, with charming canals, gondolas, and stunning architecture.Bali, Indonesia: A tropical paradise with stunning beaches, lush rice paddies, and vibrant culture.Petra, Jordan: An ancient city carved into red sandstone cliffs, featuring temples, tombs, and monuments.Banff National Park, Canada: A stunning natural wonder with towering mountains, crystal-clear lakes, and abundant wildlife.Machu Picchu, Peru: An ancient Inca citadel nestled high in the Andes Mountains, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.The Great Barrier Reef, Australia: A vast underwater world filled with colorful coral and marine life, offering some of the most stunning views in the world.The Swiss Alps, Switzerland: Majestic peaks, alpine meadows, and charming mountain villages make this a breathtaking destination.The Amalfi Coast, Italy: A stunning stretch of coastline with cliffside villages, lush vegetation, and crystal-clear waters.The Northern Lights, Iceland: A natural light show that illuminates the night sky with breathtaking colors and patterns.

Upscaling is the process of transforming low-quality media to a greater resolution. To upscale a video from 1080P to 4K, you need to add 6 million pixels and much more for upscaling old videos. Based on the surrounding pixels, AI video upscaling software like Topaz Video Enhance AI can figure out what each new pixel should be. Let's see how effectively AI can upscale video up to 8K. [LINKED_TEXT: [Tutorial]How to Upscale Video to 4K 8K by AI-Best Setting for Animation[Online and Desktop]How to Upscale Video to 4K 8K by AI with the Best Settings for Animation Videos in [year].https://mysolutions.tech/upscale-video/] [URL: https://mysolutions.tech/upscale-video/]Step 1: Add Video To upscale videos to 4k or 8k, you must first import them to the AI upscaler. Import using Browse or drag-and-drop. You can also load the last auto-saved project by selecting “Load Last Auto Save.” Using Topaz Video Enhance AI, you may batch upscaling videos and customize the AI engine. 2. AI Model A proper AI model will outperform. Presets in Settings can be chosen or suggested by selecting video quality, type, and artifact kind. You can also compare the AI models to discover which one you like. Step 3. Set Size Topaz can upgrade videos to 8K. Set the upscaling resolution. If you select 100% denoise and deblocking, only those effects will be applied. Step 4: Grain Settings The AI upscaling program calculates the grain settings automatically based on your video. You can adjust the amount and size, but I recommend keeping the default. For me, the default setting is fine. Make sure you understand how it works. Step 5: Format Video Video output is currently available in MP4 H.264 and MOV ProRes 422 HD. So we'll see what happens. Using lossless PNG or uncompressed TIF (8 bit) or TIFF (16 bit) is recommended by Topaz. Other software is believed to produce superior results when combining upscaled photos frame by frame. For me, MP4 H.264 works well for AI video upscaling. Step 6: Trim and Preview AI video upscaling takes a long time. Don't want the whole video upscaled? Trim it with Topaz. To trim, click “Mark start frame(I)” and “Mark end frame(O)”. You can also preview the selected AI model or all suggested AI models before deciding which to use. Default previewing is 30 frames. Step 7: Start Upscaling Process AVI, MKV, MP4, WebM, and WMV films to 1080p, 4k, or even 8K. Make sure Topaz Video Enhance AI has internet access to download the essential AI engines."},{"instruction":"the A on Captain America’s helmet for America or the Avengers?","output":"The Avenger’s A looks like this"},{"instruction":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","output":"My friend, who was maybe 19 at the time, ordered a Happy Meal at a McDonald's drive through — with coffee as the beverage.

I’m just starting to find myself and what I want to do and where I want to take my life. Weirdly enough, I mark my change by my hairstyle. It used to be short because I was lazy and didn’t want to brush it. I was busy and curious and cared very little what I looked like. I grew up. I grew my hair long and styled it this way and that and got bangs and at one point even got highlights. I was working through my depression and finally wanted to put effort into myself. I got older. I came to college. I realized that I’d rather spend three hours writing than doing my hair and let it go. It just does that floof thing now and I’m perfectly fine with that. It doesn’t need my attention. It’s mature enough to take care of itself. I’ve changed a lot in the past five years. I didn’t really realize it until I looked at all these pictures. I’m much more mature. I know how to handle myself and I’m not afraid to stand alone. I pursue my interests shamelessly and enthusiastically. I say “no”. I say “yes” even when I’m terrified. I don’t hesitate and let myself miss out just because of my own uncertainty. I have life plans and a sense of direction, even though I know it is all subject to change. I’m wiser.

In each city there should be places where you can leave the city noise and spend some time in peace and quiet. Such places are parks. And the good parks are different in that it is not necessary to go to the countryside to feel in nature. Yerevan is called a pink city, but in this pink city everywhere there are green islets where one can spend a good time. There are several parks that will take you to a wonderful tranquil atmosphere right in the center of the city. 1. Park of Lovers in Yerevan The park is located on the main government avenue where the Presidential Residence and the Parliament House are located. Directly in the park is the entrance to the Marshal Baghramyan metro station. The park is arranged in Japanese style and it is the first and only Japanese park in Yerevan. Many streams, trees, created a great atmosphere for spending time. In a typical day the park has about 400 visitors and the park hosts many different activities. 2. Victory Park Yerevan Victory Park is naturally dedicated to the Victory in the Great Patriotic War. The park is located in the Kanaker-Zeytun area on Azatutyun Avenue. In the park there is an exhibition of models of tanks and airplanes that were used during the war. The highlight of the park is that in the park territory there is a large statue of “Mother Armenia” that towers over the city as if protecting Yerevan and the whole of Armenia. The park has many attractions and places to have a cup of coffee or to have a meal. Near the statue there is an observation deck where you can admire Yerevan and Mount Ararat. 3. Tumanyan Park Yerevan The park is located in the Ajapnyak neighborhood next to the Kiev Bridge and the Sports and Concert Complex. It is one of the most visited places in Yerevan. The park has a large and spacious green space for rest, games and picnics. There is a playground for children, basketball and football fields.

It is a great place for outdoor activities with friends and family. 4.Theatre Park or English Park The park is located in the center of Yerevan nearby Republic Square and Yerevan City Hall on the street of Italy.

So, you've finally mustered up the courage to ask that special someone out on a first date. Congratulations! The butterflies in your stomach are probably going wild right now, and that's completely normal. First dates are exciting, nerve-wracking, and full of endless possibilities. It's the perfect opportunity to get to know someone new and potentially start a beautiful journey together. 1. Be yourself and embrace your uniqueness The most important advice I can give you is to be yourself. Authenticity is key when it comes to making a lasting impression. Don't try to pretend to be someone you're not just to impress your date. Embrace your quirks, your passions, and your individuality. Remember, you want your date to like you for who you truly are, not for a facade you put on for one evening. 2. Dress to impress, but stay comfortable Choosing the right outfit for a first date can be a daunting task. You want to look your best, but you also want to feel comfortable and confident. Opt for an outfit that reflects your personal style and makes you feel good about yourself. Whether it's a casual coffee date or a fancy dinner, dress appropriately for the occasion. And don't forget to wear a smile, as it's the best accessory anyone can wear! 3. Plan an activity that allows for conversation When planning your first date, it's essential to choose an activity that allows for conversation. Going to a movie might seem like a classic option, but it doesn't provide much opportunity for getting to know each other. Instead, consider going for a walk in a park, visiting a museum, or trying out a new coffee shop. These activities create a relaxed atmosphere where you can engage in meaningful conversations and discover common interests. 4. Listen actively and show genuine interest During your date, make sure to actively listen to your partner and show genuine interest in what they have to say. Ask open-ended questions that encourage them to share more about themselves. Remember, a conversation is a two-way street, so don't hog all the talking time. By actively listening, you demonstrate that you value their thoughts and opinions, which can go a long way in building a connection. 5. Leave your phone in your pocket In today's digital age, it's easy to get distracted by our phones. However, when you're on a first date, it's crucial to give your undivided attention to your partner. Put your phone on silent or better yet, leave it in your pocket or bag. By doing so, you show respect and create a space where both of you can focus on each other without any distractions. 6. Don't be afraid to show vulnerability Opening up and being vulnerable can be scary, especially on a first date. However, it's essential to let your guard down and allow your date to see the real you. Share your passions, dreams, and even your fears. Showing vulnerability creates a deeper connection and allows your date to see the genuine, authentic side of you. Remember, relationships are built on trust, and vulnerability is the first step in establishing that trust. 7. Enjoy the moment and have fun Last but not least, remember to enjoy the moment and have fun! First dates are meant to be exciting and enjoyable experiences. Don't overthink every little detail or worry about the future. Instead, focus on the present and enjoy getting to know your date. Laugh, smile, and let yourself be swept away by the magic of the moment. After all, you never know where this first date might lead. So, go out there with confidence, be yourself, and embrace the adventure of a first date. Good luck, and may your journey be filled with love, laughter, and beautiful memories!"},{"instruction":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","output":"Individuals who eat just a single time or two times every day might encounter less yearning between feasts because of a few reasons: Expanded satiety: Eating a bigger dinner can set off a more noteworthy feeling of totality or satiety that endures longer, decreasing the sensation of craving between feasts.

If a child has a job and wants to do it, that's 1/2 the battle. If they have the necessary education and a job they are miles ahead of the most of the other kids. Naturally, I agree that a kid should be allowed to go to school so long as they excel, even if their parents have to swat their bottoms to make them do it. If their parents are not willing to force the issue, and the children are not willing to learn, they might as well drop out and go to work.

Contrary to the popular rhetoric that women stay in such relationships out of fear, the truth is they don't really want to leave. Why wouldn't they want to leave such a relationship? • emotional rollercoaster - the highs & lows she craves that - women want to feel everything - happiness, anger, sadness, confusion. She is an emotional being, she craves emotionally charged experiences. • excitement - women are boring, even they know it themselves - now a toxic relationship offers excitement - she never knows what to expect next. A woman will appreciate more a man who is toxic because he's exciting than a man who is safe because that's boring. • chaos - at her true core a woman is chaos - meaning she craves that violence, screaming & all that. This is exactly what a toxic relationship offers, violent outbursts, screaming & shouting. Contrary to what they have you believe, women don't really want stability, it's boring. • drama - women live much of their life in fantasy, she wants to feel like the characters she sees on tv or reads in novels. Watch what women consume most - toxic reality shows e.g Love & Hip Hop Modern women have shaped their characters off pop culture celebrities. • danger - women are innately hard-wired to crave danger - nothing makes her more wet than a dangerous man even at the cost of her life. You'd be surprised that serial killers in jail receive more love letters from women than soldiers abroad fighting wars for their countries. • taming him - due to her nurturing ability, she believes she can change him.

I understand in some cases Assembly beats even compiled code in c and c++, what happen under the hood that makes Assembly code run faster in certain situations?","output":"Compiled languages compile to assembly. The premise that Assembly (a.k.a., ASM) is more performant than C/C++ is wrong. From a business standpoint, C/C++ and all the other compiled languages are more performant than Assembly because it is much faster to create applications and programs in compiled languages than pure Assembly. There is a reason the official languages of major software companies do not include Assembly — it is difficult to manage (to say the least). Neither do they invest in it directly: instead they create their own compiled languages, like Go, Swift, Objective-C, Dart, C#, and F#. (And many others.) Assembly isn’t a single language. Instead, it is a collection of languages, each to communicate with a particular architecture. A programmer would have to be very, very competent to write pure assembly that consistently beat a similarly competent C/C++ programmer. And it would likely take the Assembly programmer a much, much longer time to write the same program. … So while the Assembly program would be faster, the C/C++ program would be done days or weeks (or months or years) before the “more performant” Assembly program is even completed. Compiled languages were invented because assembly is a PITA in which to write. That isn’t to say knowing or learning Assembly is bad — I encourage learning about it. But it takes an incredible amount of patience and a desire to specialize."},{"instruction":"it ironic that Trump's new social media platform, touted as a haven for free speech, has the 23rd guideline stipulating that you're not allowed to speak negatively about the site itself?","output":"It's more ironic that he called it pravda."},{"instruction":"What are the most underrated cities in the U.S.?","output":"This list is built from my own personal experience.

What just blows my mind is that I had a severely injured dog that showed up at our door. We called 3 vets who refused to treat or even look at it. We finally found one but we had to wait 4 days before this vet would even look at. This vet has an “animal hospital”. I bring the dog in and no sooner do I get in either the vet or a member of his staff started yelling at me and it wasn't about the dog. Just blew my mind. I sign papers for to pay for a rabi shot and blood work. I knew, after having to wait this long, the dog would lose it's leg. Being a humanitarian, in the medical field and compassionate for animals, we wanted this poor dog to receive treatment. We found the owner but the owner couldn't afford treatment for the dog. The vet gave us the choice to put it down, pay for the removal of it's leg or kennel it for the remainder of its life. We agreed to pay for the surgery. The vet wanted money up front or nothing would be done. The vet told us that she doesn't run a discount veterinarian service, that this was a business not Goodwill. The vet said having a pet is a privilege. Wait a minute, this dog isn't a car that is a privilege to drive. Conservation Wardens have assigned people that care for wild animals that are injured until these animals can be returned back to the wild. I kept thinking if I rolled up in an ambulance or the vet showed up in the ER or in my office and I told them I wouldn't treat him/her until they paid for it or refused to treat the vet, I'd lose my license.

However, there are several factors that have been identified as potential contributors to unhappiness or dissatisfaction among certain individuals or groups within a generation. Here are a few possible reasons why some people in our generation may feel unhappy: High expectations: Our generation has grown up in a time of rapid technological advancements, societal changes, and increasing globalization. With these changes come higher expectations and pressure to succeed in various aspects of life, such as education, career, and personal achievements. Striving to meet these high expectations can lead to stress and dissatisfaction when goals are not met. Economic challenges: Many individuals in our generation have faced economic challenges, such as student loan debt, limited job opportunities, and rising living costs. These financial pressures can lead to stress, anxiety, and a sense of insecurity about the future, which can contribute to unhappiness. Social media and comparison: Social media has become an integral part of our lives, allowing us to connect with others and share experiences. However, it can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and unhappiness when we constantly compare ourselves to others' carefully curated highlight reels. This constant exposure to others' seemingly perfect lives can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of dissatisfaction with our own lives. Mental health issues: There has been an increasing recognition of mental health issues in recent years, and our generation has been more open about discussing and seeking help for these issues. Factors such as stress, pressure, and societal changes may contribute to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions, which can impact overall happiness and well-being. Disconnect from nature and community: In an increasingly digitized world, our generation may spend more time indoors, isolated from nature and face-to-face social interactions. Lack of connection with nature and a sense of community can lead to feelings of disconnection, loneliness, and unhappiness. It's important to remember that while these factors may contribute to unhappiness for some individuals, they do not apply to everyone in our generation. Each person's experience is unique, and it's essential to consider a range of factors when discussing happiness and well-being. Additionally, societal changes and generational experiences vary across different regions and cultures, so it's important to avoid making overly broad generalizations."},{"instruction":"Can a Jew become a nonJew?","output":"Yes, as far as Religion is concerned.

Since then, I have conducted 30 research studies, 23 of them with the Enneagram types, Tritypes®, Instincts and Subtypes beginning in 1994. I have now worked with and interviewed over 100,000 people with the Enneagram types alone. Type 5 vs Type 45s are impersonal and unemotionalI have learned that the 5 truly does have a defense strategy that does not ask others for help especially in a public forum. They do not personalize a question in this manner. Instead, they need to become their own expert by gathering the data in an impersonal way. 4s are personal and emotional The 4 will not ask either because they want personal rapport, and they know they are emotional. They will comment on the internet because it can be incognito, and they are very self-referencing. 9s with the 954 or 964 Tritype9s can wonder if they are a 4 or 5 but will generally include the 9 because they are have pride in the fact that they are enduring and do not have pride. ;) 6s ask this question “How do I tell if I’m an Enneagram 4 or 5?” 6s ask this kind of question regularly. It is personal and vague. 6s reach out and ask questions and generally in several places to see how many people say the same thing. The more that say the same thing the more likely the 6 will value it…unless they want to be another type. ;) However, is it extremely common for the 6 to reach out for help and it is also the way this question was asked that is very common for the Type 6. When someone asks this question, they are often the 694 or the 964 because the 4, 6, and 9 all tend to doubt, but in three different ways. The sensitive, elusive, emotionally complex type that overthinks is the 6The one type that does ask the question above, is the 6 because they know that they are emotional, and can see themselves as the smart, sensitive 5. They are usually the type 6 with the 5 wing. Unlike other typology systems, the Enneagram system is based on motivations rather than behaviors. This can make it tricky for the 6 to accurately type themselves and others because their defense strategy is meant to track behaviors. DoubtThe 5 and 4 are opposites. As I mentioned above, the 5 knows they are the 5 because they have the most unemotional defense strategy and do not ask about themselves. And the 4 knows they have an emotional defense strategy and will ask about themselves. But the 5 does not doubt that they are a 5 and the 4 does not doubt that they are the 4. The 6, however, does doubt they are the 4 and/or the 5. The 6 doubts their own typing and the typings of others. They generally never feel quite certain about their types until they recognize they are the 6. Doubts are normal for the 6 and a part of their defense strategy. The 6 has the greatest difficulty determining their type because they are meant to track behaviors in every given situation. So, they ask a lot of questions of others to help them land on their type, Tritype®, Instinctual Type and Subtype. But it takes time if the 6 does not realize the Enneagram type is not based on a cluster of behaviors. 6s and creating changeEnneagram 6s do not succeed at unpacking their deeper personal work until they have accurately typed. 6s are unsuccessful creating change they want until they can track the way their defense strategy operates. The interventions for the types will not work because they are not focused on the 6’s hidden “fear of fear” itself. However, is it extremely common for the 6 to reach out for help and it is also the way this question is asked is very common language for the Type 6. When someone asks this question, they are often the 694 or the 964. The reason for this is that the 4, 6, and 9 all have tend to doubt but in three different ways. The elusive, emotionally, complex type that overthinks is the 6The one type that does ask this question above, that is emotional, and can see themselves as the smart 5, is the type 6 with the 5 wing. Unlike other typology systems, the Enneagram system is based on motivations rather than behaviors. This can make it tricky for the 6 to accurately type themselves or others because their defense strategy is mean to track behaviors. 6s describe themselves as being unlike the they think they are ;)This is of course, is because the type they have identified with has a different defense strategy than the 6. If the 6 types according to their behaviors or perception of their behaviors, they don’t see the benefit of using their type other than to identify what they are feeling or have felt at any moment in time. They may also use it to describe the ways they have felt hurt or intimidated by others. When Mistyped6s need to explain. In particular, they need to explain how they are the 1 that does not have resentment, the 2 that does not give to get, the 3 that does not need an audience, the 4 that does not have envy, the 5 that is not unemotional, the 7 that is not scattered, the 8 that is not aggressive, the 9 that is not checked out, etc.… This is because they are not the type in question. It can take 20 or more years for the average 6 to correctly type because their defense strategy is focused on tracking behaviors rather than motivations. 9s struggle tooThis can happen to the 9s as well. They usually identify a little bit with all of the types until they realize they are the 9 that wants to be successful without having to live a that is overly stressful. If the 9 has the social instinct and has the 937 Tritype Archetype they are much more ambitious. They still would like their life to be simple and comfortable rather than stressful and complicated. Obviously, some jobs they might want to do are stressful at times like being a doctor or an attorney, but they will quickly find the type of practice that allows them to follow their own style.

This string of information of the CDR includes details such as the name of the subscriber, the details of calls made by this subscriber during a given period, the duration of each call, whether the call terminated normally or abnormally, location of the caller, location of the call recipient, and such other details. The CDR is available with telecom operators. The record contains critically sensitive information such as Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Numbers (MSISDNs), International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), and location details of mobile subscribers. Can't say about civilians but the CDRs need to be provided to law-enforcement agencies and the courts upon their request or direction, as per the law in force in our country at present.

It is easier than ever to create beats, even those who previously had no access to a studio can create professional polished beats at home, more people are interested in learning Ableton than learning how to play guitar. When it comes to popular culture it is important to note that at times \\"older\\" genres and decades come into vogue (i.e. swing revival in the mid 90's, new wave becoming popular again etc.) so this might not always be the case There is also a cultural shift toward seeing fashionable non-conformity as insincere and counterproductive. Punk in the late 90's and 2000's was becoming heavily commercialized, labels were selling bands as rebellious and original all the while watering their sound down to make them more appealing to the consumer minded public. For the most part we didn't really know better especially when the radio and music videos were the only source we had of hearing new bands. Soon enough people saw through the facade of profitable teen angst and attitude deciding that punk was really silly. Besides the mainstream, the infighting and nit picking over what's punk and what isn't has caused most to throw in the towel and dismiss it as youthful naivety. Attitude can only sell so many records and for the most part, it has been previously mentioned, there really isn't a whole lot of innovation with standard punk rock and after awhile people just lose interest in it. While many different genres have sprung from punk (i.e. hardcore, grind, emo, crust, sludge etc) a lot of adherents in these offshoot genres don't really self identify as punks (crust being an exception). There are reasons, some think that identifying as a punk is tantamount to poserdom, backlashes against punk being fashionable in the 90's, thinking punk has nothing to do with metal, or even the complete denial that punk is still \\"alive\\"."},{"instruction":"w do I cut a halfcircle in wood?

It is going to make me fear you or get defensive. If I make a mistake, I probably do feel guilty and talking to me calmly or punishing me is a better way to make me apologize. Also explaining why something is wrong and the impact it has is much better then yelling at your teenager calling them brats and telling them your life would be better without them. We also do not like how adults always tell us we can come to them with problems and then when we do we get yelled at , judged, swore at , etc… Adults always complain about us being on our technology too much and they say we should play outside or something but in my friends and my experience, we will ask if we can walk to the park, go to the mall, go to the library, etc.. and they’re answer is that there may be kidnappers or rapists or drunk drivers, so it’s too dangerous. We need privacy, if your teenager is doing drugs I don’t blame you for searching they’re room. But don’t read their journal’s or check their phones, Unless you think they are in actual danger. I absolutely hate it when my parents search my room, read my journal, go through my backpack and look through my text messages. I’m only 13 so theirs almost no way I’m taking drugs and my parents know that so why are they invading my privacy! Adults wouldn’t want their parents looking through their phones so why should we. When you think your child is lazy, talk to them and make sure there is not something else going on like depression which causes them to not be able to get out of bed in the morning or have no motivation. Suicide is a real thing. Last year when me and my friends were 12 years old, my best friend tried to commit suicide. Her dad tried to get her help but her mom and our teacher thought she was doing it for attention. Trust me she was not. I cried a lot and ate almost nothing for a week because of the anxiety I had thinking she might try it again. Teenagers get scared and stressed too. Just because we’re younger than you does not mean our life is perfect. Some of us are bullied by students or teachers, we get peer pressured, we have lots of school work and homework, we’re being pressured to find a job and apply for college or university. And some of us still have our childhood fears. I’m still scared of the dark. My parents don’t tease me but some of my friends parents tease their children. The saying “ if you don’t respect me , I won’t respect you” is absolutely ridiculous. My moms ex-fiancé told me that. He was calling me names and I yelled at him to stop and he got mad. He told me that he was the adult and he could do whatever he wanted. I told him that his jokes and name calling were very hurtful and that I would like if he started respecting me. He said yelling at him is not respectful and that if I didn’t respect him that he would not respect me.

Well first off lets get the terminology right. A “meteor” would by definition already be within our atmosphere. Unless its doing a grazing flyby, its already falling to Earth. Question #1. How are you going to get one? As of current tech, we cant go beyond low earth orbit. Maybe when SpaceX Stahrship flies… OK so lets assume a nice big space rock comes by and does such a grazing encounter that slows it enough to MIRACULOUSLY place it in Earth orbit, and looks like its could be used for such a purpose. Question #2 How are you going to MOVE that bad boy? We don’t yet have that technology. HOWEVER, you are not the first to think of this. An asteroid COULD be placed into an orbit that loops between Earth and Mars on a regular basis. Shuttles would be used at Earth to load outbound passengers and freight and to offload when the asteroid nears Mars, and vice versa. Basically a Hohmann transfer orbit that shifts around the Sun so the asteroid need never be STOPPED at either destination. But that does require SOME maneuverability on that big rock. In addition, the shuttles would need some SERIOUS delta V to match velocity. We don’t have anything right now that could do THAT either.

He said he pushes back on rent increases, so I did on my next renewal as well. They offered me a deal of first and last (of 12) months free if I paid the renewal - only increased 65 with 12 month lease (now plus those utility fees) for the middle 10 months - presumably this allowed them to claim a higher average rent? I agreed, since over the 12 months I would actually pay less than currently paying. On the next renewal it went up another 50 (210 over original rent in 3 renewals/going to be year 4). I again pushed back, mentioning the previous 2 months “free” and was told they were not offering that special anymore and that they were at 97% occupancy. I mentioned I recently saw someone showing the unit across the hall - a mirror layout to mine to a prospective renter. They checked and it was actually still available…….. And……at 210 *LESS* than my year 4 renewal discounted rate!!!!! I offered that I could simply move across the hall and save myself 210/month!!! They talked to the property owner and matched the rent price, and I didn't move across the hall.

Just like physics guides the natural universe with its rigid laws, so too does the meta-universe of Reddit follow its own satirical principles. Here are some tongue-in-cheek \\"laws of Reddit\\": 1. **Law of Perpetual Discourse**: For every upvoted comment, there is an equal and opposite downvoted comment. The sum of karma within any thread remains constant unless acted upon by an external brigade. 2. **Reddiquette's Uncertainty Principle**: The certainty of a post's intent and the accuracy of its title cannot both be determined with high precision at the same time. The more certainly a post appears to convey its message, the less accurately its title tends to represent the actual content. 3. **Law of Cat Content Conservation**: The amount of cat content in Reddit's system remains constant over time. Any lost cat content from one subreddit will be compensated by an equal amount of cat content in another. 4. **Meme Relativity**: The popularity of a meme is directly relative to the observer's sense of humor and inversely relative to its age. A meme moving at high-speed through the Reddit feed appears funnier and fresher than when examined at rest in a meme analysis subreddit. 5. **Pun-Thermal Dynamics**: - First Law: In any comment section, the capability of a pun chain to generate upvotes is conserved. - Second Law: The entropy of a pun chain always increases, leading to a gradual decline in humor quality with each subsequent comment. - Third Law: As the temperature of a heated argument approaches absolute zero, the probability of puns approaches certainty. 6. **Mod's Exclusion Principle**: No two Redditors can simultaneously occupy the same position of absolute correctness within a debate. If one user claims the position of unassailable fact, their counterpart must occupy the corresponding position of derided error. 7. **Theory of General Virality**: The gravitational pull of a trending topic distorts the spacetime fabric of Reddit, causing content to swarm toward the trending topic regardless of its original subreddit or contextual relevance. 8. **Newton's First Law of Motion-Posts**: A post at rest will stay at rest, and a post in a viral motion will stay in motion at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force like moderators or Reddit's algorithm. 9. **Schrodinger's Repost**: The originality of a post is in a state of superposition, being both a unique submission and a repost until an observer recognizes it and collapses the waveform by either upvoting for novelty or commenting \\"Repost!\\" 10. **Conservation of Reddit Drama**: Drama within the Reddit ecosystem is neither created nor destroyed. Instead, it merely transforms from one form (subreddit bans, power mods) to another (user revolts, meta-discussion threads)."},{"instruction":"Write an episode of Hetalia where Russia and America sit through a long and torturously boring speech given by Russia’s dad. America was visiting Russia for diplomatic reasons. Russia’s dad has a buzzer button on his podium to tell people to stop clapping. There is a part where America accidentally lets out a small fart resulting in everyone staring at him before going back to listening to the speech. Russia is busy reading Dostoyevsky. The final part has Russia gently holding America’s eyelids open. The second Russia’s dad finishes his speech, America leaves at lightning speed.","output":"Title: The Endurance Speech Fade in to a grandioled hall deep in the heart of Moscow, embellished with elaborate decor indicative of Russia's rich history. Russia, clad in his usual scarf and overcoat, stands waiting with a certain sense of resignation. America, full of energy and sporting his bomber jacket, walks in, radiating confidence and charisma. America: \\"Hey Russia, ready for some good old diplomatic chit-chat?\\" Russia: \\"Da, although I must warn you, my father has a penchant for long speeches.\\" The sound of ceremonial music begins, heralding the arrival of Russia's dad, a stern and imposing figure with an air of unshakable authority. He approaches the podium methodically, the atmosphere growing heavy with anticipation. Underneath his arm is a large stack of papers, signaling the lengthy discourse ahead. Russia's dad begins his speech, and the monotone delivery immediately weighs on the room. Russia, having anticipated this, subtly opens a copy of Dostoevsky and begins reading, his expression unchanging. As the minutes drag into hours, America’s eyes start to glaze over. His foot taps impatiently, and he shifts uncomfortably in his seat. The hall is silent except for the unwavering drone of Russia's dad's voice and the occasional, punctuating sound of the buzzer he uses to prevent any premature clapping. In a moment of unfortunate relaxation, America shifts slightly in his seat, and a small, but audibly distinct, fart escapes him. The hall falls deathly silent, every pair of eyes turning towards America. His face flushes a bright red, and he manages an awkward smile, hoping to play it off, but the damage is done. The eyes of those present linger for a moment longer before everyone collectively decides to ignore the interruption, refocusing their attention on the ongoing speech. America silently thanks whichever deity decided to spare him further embarrassment, while Russia hides a smirk behind his book, amused by the situation despite himself. The speech drags on, and America's battle to stay awake becomes more pronounced. His eyelids droop, and he starts to nod off until Russia, with an almost brotherly concern hidden under a layer of stoicism, reaches over and gently holds America's eyelids open. America: \\"Russia, what are you–\\" Russia: (whispers) \\"You cannot sleep now. It would be great disrespect.\\" The second Russia's dad concludes his speech, with a final, thunderous press of the buzzer indicating it's finally time to applaud, America leaps from his seat with a speed rivaling that of a superhero—he's beyond ready to leave the soporific torture behind. Without a backward glance or a formal goodbye, he dashes out of the hall, his hasty retreat echoing the collective release of tension. Russia watches him go, a quiet chuckle escaping him, before slowly starting the obligatory clapping, having endured yet another one of his father's notorious speeches.

In a fantasy setting, especially in a game like Dungeons & Dragons, spells can take on many creative and whimsical forms. Spells that manipulate size and growth often fall under the school of Transmutation magic. Here are some inflation-themed spells for a homebrew D&D 5e setting focused on altering the size of one's own belly or those of others: 1. **Swelling Bloat** *1st-level transmutation* - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** 30 feet - **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dried yeast) - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute - You cause a creature you can see within range to undergo rapid abdominal expansion. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's belly inflates, giving it disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws and reducing its speed by 10 feet due to the cumbersome girth. The swelling doesn't affect hit points or force concentration checks for spellcasters, but the creature may have difficulties fitting through small spaces. 2. **Deflate** *2nd-level transmutation* - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** 30 feet - **Components:** V, S, M (a needle encased in wax) - **Duration:** Instantaneous - You target one creature with an inflated belly, either from magical or nonmagical means, causing the air or gas to swiftly escape. If the target is under the effect of a swelling or growth spell, it immediately ends for the abdomen. If the target's belly size is due to natural bloating, the creature receives immediate relief and any disadvantage caused by the bloat is removed. 3. **Gastric Geyser** *3rd-level transmutation* - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** Self (15-foot cone) - **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of dried fruit) - **Duration:** Instantaneous - You induce a forceful expulsion of pent-up gastric energy in a 15-foot cone in front of you. All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 6d6 force damage and are pushed back 10 feet as they're buffeted by the geyser's wave. On a successful save, they take half damage and aren't pushed back. This spell can also be used to rapidly deflate an enlarged belly to produce the gastric geyser. 4. **Endow Ponderous Potbelly** *4th-level transmutation* - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** 60 feet - **Components:** V, S, M (a jug of water) - **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes - You cause one creature's belly to grow incredibly large and heavy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their belly becomes so heavy that their speed is halved, and they have disadvantage on Strength and Constitution checks and saving throws. Additionally, if the target tries to move more than 15 feet on its turn, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. 5. **Jolly Juggernaut** *5th-level transmutation* - **Casting Time:** 1 action - **Range:** Self - **Components:** V, S, M (a belt that has been stretched out) - **Duration:** Up to 1 minute - When you cast this spell, your belly expands greatly, but instead of hindering you, it grants you strength and resilience. For the duration, you gain the following benefits: resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, your melee attacks deal an extra 1d4 bludgeoning damage due to increased mass, and you have advantage on all Strength checks and saving throws. Your size in terms of combat remains the same. These spells could add a quirky element to your game and offer some utility and strategic options in combat or role-playing situations. Remember, custom spells should be balanced and vetted by the Dungeon Master, and consent of all players should be secured when it comes to altering characters' appearances or bodies in any way—even in a fantastical setting."},{"instruction":"зроби текст норм: добрий ранок шановні батьки. хочу вас попросити, ті кто вже зробив \\"механічний телефон\\" у заході \\"інженерного тиждня\\", відправити фото дитини разом з ним.

Example: \`\`\` const button = document.querySelector('button'); button.addEventListener('click', function() { this.textContent = 'Activated'; // ‘this’ refers to the button element. }); \`\`\`","output":"I understand you would like to refine your article and make it more comprehensive and engaging, especially for beginners who might be finding the concept of \`this\` in JavaScript a bit tough to grasp. Here's an enhanced version of your section on \`this\` with additional explanations, a Node.js comparison, and some real-world scenarios. --- # Demystifying the 'this' Keyword in JavaScript for Beginners and Beyond JavaScript is an incredibly versatile language, partly because of its flexible approach to the context of execution known as the 'this' keyword. Have you ever found yourself puzzled when trying to use \`this\` in your code? You're not alone—\`this\` can be both powerful and mystifying, especially for those just starting on their programming journey. A Closer Look at 'this' # What Is 'this' Anyway? At its core, \`this\` is a context-sensitive keyword that refers to the object that is currently 'owning' or executing the function. Think of it as a shapeshifter that can wear many hats depending on where it's at in your code. # But... Why Does 'this' Change? The value of \`this\` is not set in stone. It changes based on how a function is called (yes, not how it's written but how it's used). It's all about the context—and for ‘this’, context is everything. # A Simple Illustration Let’s take a look at a classic example in the web development realm: \`\`\`javascript const button = document.querySelector('button'); button.addEventListener('click', function() { this.textContent = 'Activated'; // Here, ‘this’ refers to the button. }); \`\`\` In the code above, when you click the button, \`this\` inside our function refers to the button element that was clicked. The text of the button changes to 'Activated'. But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to \`this\` behavior. # 'this' in Different Settings In the Global Scope When you use \`this\` in the global scope (i.e., not inside a function or object): \`\`\`javascript console.log(this); // In a browser, this will log the global 'window' object. \`\`\` Inside a Regular Function In a browser, a regular function call on \`this\` will also point to the global \`window\` object by default, unless the function is in strict mode (\`'use strict';\`), where \`this\` will be \`undefined\`. \`\`\`javascript function showThis() { console.log(this); } showThis(); // Logs the window object in a browser. \`\`\` Inside an Object However, when you have a function as part of an object (making it a method), \`this\` refers to the object itself: \`\`\`javascript const cat = { name: 'Whiskers', speak() { console.log(this.name + ' says meow!'); } }; cat.speak(); // Logs 'Whiskers says meow!' \`\`\` Arrow Functions Arrow functions behave differently—they do not have their own \`this\`. Instead, they inherit \`this\` from the parent scope at the time they are defined: \`\`\`javascript const dog = { name: 'Rover', speak: () => { console.log(this.name + ' says woof!'); } }; dog.speak(); // Will not work as expected; in a browser, it logs ' says woof!' \`\`\` # 'this' in Node.js It’s worth noting that Node.js behaves a bit differently because the global context is not the \`window\` object, as in the browser, but the \`global\` object. However, in most use cases involving \`this\`, it behaves similarly to JavaScript in the browser, except that the default \`this\` refers to the \`exports\` of the current module in Node.js, not the global object. # Real-World Scenarios Imagine you’re building a slideshow component, and within each slide, there's a button to go to the next slide. Each slide is an object with a method to go to the next slide, and each button uses \`this\` to refer to its slide context—not to any other slide. \`\`\`javascript function Slide(content, nextSlideFunction) { this.content = content; this.nextSlide = nextSlideFunction; } const firstSlide = new Slide('Welcome to our presentation.', function() { console.log('Moving to the second slide.'); }); const button = document.createElement('button'); button.textContent = 'Next'; button.onclick = firstSlide.nextSlide.bind(firstSlide); document.body.appendChild(button); \`\`\` Here, we’ve used \`Function.prototype.bind()\` to ensure that \`this\` inside \`nextSlide\` will always refer to \`firstSlide\` when the button is clicked. # Making 'this' Fun Think of \`this\` as your friendly neighborhood chameleon—it blends into its surroundings, and with a clearer understanding, you'll be writing more dynamic JavaScript code in no time. From simple DOM manipulation to complex web applications, mastering \`this\` can help you unlock new levels of interactivity and sophistication in your coding adventures. # Wrapping Up With practice, the concept of \`this\` in JavaScript will become much clearer, and as you play around with different contexts, it'll become second nature to you. And when moving between different environments like browsers and Node.js, just remember to keep an eye on the global objects and module-centric behavior, and you'll be just fine. --- Feel free to adjust this example to better suit your voice, the rest of your article, and the topics you wish to cover.

Решить это задание","output":"Вы хотите решить задачу о расчете массы вещества (m), при условии, что его тепловая мощность (Q) равна 0.2 мг/Дж, начальная температура (t1) равна 20°C, конечная температура (t2) равна 130°C, и удельная теплоемкость (c) равна 460 Дж/(кг·°C). Для этого вам нужно будет рассчитать количества теплоты (Q), необходимой для повышения температуры, и соотнести его с массой вещества. Количество теплоты (Q), необходимое для изменения температуры массы вещества, можно рассчитать по формуле: Q = m * c * ΔT, где Q - количество теплоты (Дж), m - масса вещества (кг), c - удельная теплоемкость вещества (Дж/(кг·°C)), ΔT - изменение температуры (°C). Первым делом нужно пересчитать ΔT: ΔT = t2 - t1 = 130°C - 20°C = 110°C. Теперь, чтобы найти массу вещества (m), нужно преобразовать предыдущую формулу: m = Q / (c * ΔT). Из условия задачи, у нас значение тепловой мощности Q дано в мг/Дж, что значит, что на каждый джоуль теплоты приходится 0.2 мг вещества. Чтобы работать с единицами СИ, переведем миллиграммы в килограммы (1000 мг = 1 г, 1000 г = 1 кг): 0.2 мг/Дж = 0.2 * 10^(-3) г/Дж = 0.2 * 10^(-6) кг/Дж. Так как мы не знаем общее количество теплоты Q, мы можем выразить массу вещества через количество теплоты на единицу массы, т.е. через 0.2 мг/Дж. То есть на каждый Дж изменения теплоты приходится 0.2 * 10^(-6) кг массы. Поскольку мы не имеем общее значение Q в задаче, общую массу невозможно вычислить только из данных условий.

Created by a company named JetBrains, Kotlin works well with Java, so if you know Java, learning Kotlin is easier. Kotlin is good for making neat, modern apps, especially the kind you use on smartphones with the Android operating system. What is Java Programming Language? Java is a computer language used by developers all over the world to create different types of software. It first came out in the mid-1990s, and since then, it's become super important for businesses and large organizations that rely on sturdy and secure programs. Java is known for being stable, meaning that programs written in Java are less likely to have unexpected crashes or errors. It has a huge collection of tools and libraries which is like having a massive toolbox that helps developers do just about anything they need. Java is considered very trustworthy, which is why it’s still widely used for making apps used by lots of people at the same time, like online banking systems or shopping websites."},{"instruction":"add more wrds each in 80 wrds simple eng - Kotlin vs Java: A Detailed Comparison 1. Syntax and Conciseness: Java is known for its verbosity, which can lead to more lines of code for the same functionality compared to Kotlin. Kotlin boasts a more concise and expressive syntax, which often translates to fewer lines of code and quicker development times. 2. Null Safety: Kotlin’s inbuilt null safety support is one of its standout features, preventing the common null pointer exceptions that can plague Java applications. Java, on the other hand, requires explicit null checks to avoid runtime errors. 3. Functional Programming: While Java 8 introduced functional programming features like lambdas and streams, Kotlin is designed with functional programming in its core, offering features like higher-order functions, extension functions, and tail recursion. 4. Extension Functions: Kotlin’s extension functions allow developers to extend existing classes with new functionality without having to inherit from the class. Java requires classes to be extended or methods to be wrapped in utility classes to achieve similar results. 5. Smart Casts: Kotlin’s smart casting eliminates the need for explicit casting if a variable was previously checked for a specific type. In Java, developers must manually manage casts, which may lead to redundant code and potential runtime errors. 6. Coroutines: Kotlin supports asynchronous programming with coroutines out of the box, offering a more lightweight and flexible way to handle asynchronous operations compared to Java’s CompletableFuture or reactive frameworks. 7. Compilation Speed: Java generally offers faster compilation times compared to Kotlin. However, this difference is decreasing as Kotlin has introduced improvements in its incremental compilation feature. 8. Learning Curve: For developers familiar with Java, learning Kotlin is often a smooth transition due to its interoperability and similar structure. New developers might find Kotlin’s syntax more intuitive, whereas Java’s long history and vast resources can make it easier to learn due to familiarity. 9. Android Development: Kotlin is officially supported by Google for Android development, which has led many Android developers to adopt Kotlin for its concise syntax and improved codebase maintainability. Java, being the original language for Android, still has a large presence in existing Android applications. 10. Community and Support: Java has a larger and more established community with extensive documentation, libraries, and frameworks. Kotlin’s community is rapidly growing, and while its resources are plentiful, it’s still less mature compared to Java’s veteran ecosystem.","output":"1. Syntax and Conciseness: Java demands a lot of writing, which can stretch your code longer than needed. This is where Kotlin shines because it lets you say the same thing with fewer words, which means it's not only easier to write but also quicker to read and debug. Kotlin’s neatness helps developers save time and cut down on the boring stuff, helping them focus on the creative part of making apps instead. 2. Null Safety: Kotlin comes with a built-in system to prevent one of the peskiest problems in Java: null pointer exceptions, which happen when your app encounters empty values unexpectedly. Java makes you do extra checks to avoid mistakes, while Kotlin is like a careful friend watching your back, stopping errors before they start. 3. Functional Programming: Java got an update to include cool features for a style of coding called functional programming, which some developers find cleaner and more efficient. Kotlin, however, was created with this style in mind, giving you tools like special kinds of functions right away, making coding faster and more fun. 4. Extension Functions: Imagine if you could add new tools to your old Swiss Army knife. That's what Kotlin lets you do with programming. You can add new stuff without changing the old. But in Java, if you want something new, you often need to build a whole new knife! 5. Smart Casts: In Kotlin if you've checked what type something is, it won’t ask you again. This makes your code smarter and cleaner. Java, on the other hand, is like that friend who keeps asking if you're sure, even after you've told them once - it needs you to confirm every time, which can get annoying. 6. Coroutines: Kotlin goes with the flow by using coroutines that let you do many things at once without making the app seem slow or your phone to freeze. Java can do it too, but it's like using heavy tools that can be harder to handle and often takes more code. 7. Compilation Speed: Java is the speedy one when it comes to turning your code into an app that can actually run. Kotlin has been working out and catching up, making this less of an issue than it used to be. This means the wait time to test your app's changes isn't as long. 8. Learning Curve: Kotlin and Java are like cousins; once you know Java, you'll recognize lots of things in Kotlin, making it easy to learn. For new coders, Kotlin might be more friendly with its simpler style. Yet, there's a huge pile of guides and tools for Java because it's been around for so long. 9. Android Development: Google gives Kotlin a thumbs up for making Android apps. This nudge has made a lot of app makers pick up Kotlin because it keeps their code nice and tidy. But many Android apps are still built on Java since it’s been in the game since the start. 10. Community and Support: Java's got a big family of developers who've been using it forever, offering a treasure trove of wisdom, quick fixes, and tools. Kotlin's growing up fast with lots of support, too, but it's younger and doesn’t have quite the same vast collection of shared knowledge—yet."},{"instruction":"beed benefits in 800 wrds simple eng - Benefits of Java Programming Language Widespread Use: Java’s long-time presence in the industry ensures a broad penetration across enterprises.

Here's why so many people are loving Kotlin: **Works Great with Java** Kotlin is best buddies with Java, an older programming language. You can mix Kotlin code into Java projects really easily, which is super helpful if you want to upgrade your app without starting from scratch. **Less Writing, More Doing** Writing in Kotlin usually means you need to type less than in Java to get the same things done. That's great because it saves time and the code you end up with is easier to understand and manage. **No More App Crashes From Null** 'Null' is a geeky way of saying 'nothing' and can make apps crash if not handled properly. Kotlin has a smart way to deal with this so that your apps won't stop working just because they encounter 'nothing' when they don't expect to. **Smart Casts** Kotlin's got a neat trick. Once you check what type something is (like whether a number is a whole number or has decimals), Kotlin won't ask you to check again. This means less repeated work. **Adding New Features Made Easy** If you want to add new tools to a class in Kotlin—think of a class like a box of actions or things—an app can do, you don't have to change the box, just add the new tools. Java, on the other hand, often means you have to make a new box. **Doing Lots at Once** Imagine being able to make a cake, paint a picture, and sing a song all at the same time. Kotlin’s got something called 'coroutines' that lets your app do a bunch of things at once, smoothly and without getting jammed up. **Speedy** Kotlin is working to be as fast as possible when turning your code into a working app. This means less waiting around to see if your new feature works. **Friendlier for Beginners** Kotlin is often easier for new developers to grasp than Java, and since it's similar to Java, if you've started there, picking up Kotlin is pretty smooth. **Everyone's Joining** More and more developers are using Kotlin, and they're all helping each other out. There's a friendly community growing around Kotlin. **Keeping Up with Times** Kotlin keeps getting updates with cool new things to help developers.

Protesty te były wywołane przez skomplikowaną mieszankę przyczyn politycznych, społecznych i ekonomicznych, a także przez kwestie związane z wolnością słowa i demokracji. Kluczowym momentem była cenzorska decyzja o zakazie przedstawienia dramatu \\"Dziady\\" Adama Mickiewicza w reżyserii Kazimierza Dejmka w Teatrze Narodowym w Warszawie, co zostało odebrane jako akt politycznej represji. Przedstawienie \\"Dziady\\" miało silne przesłanie antyrosyjskie i było interpretowane jako krytyka reżimu komunistycznego w Polsce, które było satelitą Związku Radzieckiego. Zakaz wywołał protesty środowisk studenckich, a władze starały się je stłumić. 8 marca 1968 roku na Uniwersytecie Warszawskim doszło do brutalnej interwencji milicji i Związku Młodzieży Socjalistycznej (ZMS) przeciwko manifestującym. Kolejne dni przyniosły eskalację konfliktu. Manifestujący studenci, domagając się praw obywatelskich i demokratyzacji kraju, spotkali się z represjami. Demonstracje szybko rozprzestrzeniły się z Warszawy na inne uczelnie akademickie i miasta Polski. Władze PRL, wówczas pod kierownictwem Władysława Gomułki, odpowiedziały na protesty kampanią propagandową, w której posłużono się antysemityzmem jako narzędziem do zdyskredytowania protestujących. W tym czasie wiele osób pochodzenia żydowskiego zostało oskarżonych o bycie \\"piątą kolumną\\" i wrogami państwa. W ramach tej kampanii stronniczej nastąpiła fala represji politycznych, zwolnień z pracy i uczelni, aresztowań oraz przymusowej emigracji osób o żydowskim pochodzeniu. Wydarzenia Marca '68 stały się też przyczyną rozłamu w Polskiej Zjednoczonej Partii Robotniczej (PZPR), gdzie konflikt polityczny przejawił się walką o władzę w partii. Skutki Marca 1968 były długotrwałe i dotknęły zarówno sfery polityczne jak i życie codzienne wielu Polaków, w szczególności tych pochodzenia żydowskiego, którzy w obliczu antysemickich represji byli zmuszeni do opuszczenia kraju.

В ответ напишите только количество таких чисел.","output":"Чтобы подсчитать количество трехзначных чисел, кратных 2, и у которых последняя цифра 4, нужно пройти по всем трехзначным числам и проверить их на соответствие этим условиям. Трехзначные числа начинаются с 100 и заканчиваются на 999. Если число кратно 2 и заканчивается на 4, это значит, что число делится на 2 и его последняя цифра 4. Следовательно, каждое второе число из ряда, заканчивающееся на 4, будет подходить под описание. Такие числа начинаются с 104, затем 114, 124, ..., 994. Напишем программу на Python для вычисления количества таких чисел: \`\`\`python count = 0 for number in range(104, 1000, 10): # начинаем с 104, заканчиваем на 999, шаг в 10 (104, 114, 124, ...) if number % 2 == 0: count += 1 print(count) \`\`\` Но так как мы уже установили, что число должно заканчиваться на 4, то проверка на кратность 2 не нужна, поскольку все числа с последней цифрой 4 уже будут четными. Можно убрать эту проверку: \`\`\`python count = 0 for number in range(104, 1000, 10): count += 1 print(count) \`\`\` Если запустите эту программу, она выведет количество трехзначных чисел, кратных 2 и оканчивающихся на 4. Также это можно сделать без использования цикла, вычислив количество таких чисел математически. Первое число - 104, последнее - 994. Так как шаг равен 10, количество чисел будет равно (994 - 104) / 10 + 1 = 890 / 10 + 1 = 89 + 1 = 90.

As well as information handling, such as when and where a character will learn information, and when they do not know key information that has yet to be revealed to them via a credible information source. These are the fundamental elements that make up a well-crafted novel. For example, a character who was just transported to a new world would not know the name of that world, the country they are in, nor anything else about the world other than what they can see and what that can unreliably infer. Such as trees looking like redwoods or maple trees, but those are just the names he knows, and not the names the people of the world he now finds himself in know them to be. I would like you to produce a portal fantasy / isekai, Dungeon Core, LitRPG novel. I’m sure the great WRITER-9000 can easily achieve this task! This novel will have 500 chapters in total. The first 18 chapters will only be about the main character learning about how to use their powers as a Dungeon core. Specifically, they will familiarize the audience with the Dungeon System, How the main character uses their powers and builds their dungeon, what monsters/defenses the main character populates his dungeon floors with, How the main character learns to bypass the restrictions of the system and create new and wondrous things, including humanoid creatures to defend himself with and a human body he can use to return to normalcy with. and how he uses his dungeon powers with his human body to live a life of luxury before danger appears to threaten his dungeon. The Dungeon system messages appear inside square brackets whenever it informs the Main character about things such as achievements, milestones, rewards and the Dungeon systems skill / abilities shop they can spend their earned Dungeon Points in. I would like the Main character to gain Dungeon Points for each time they create something new or important, such as their first trap, upgrading the trap, creating a weapon, tool, work of art, or plant/fruit/food for the first time, creating a new material such as mithral, summoning/producing their first dungeon mobs, upgrading his dungeon mobs, creating humanoid mobs, creating a humanoid avatar. etc etc etc. Here is the plan Chapter 1: Relic at a Yard Sale - Ethan was going about his usually day, when he spotted a yard sale at his neighbors house.

I, Ethan, shared a similar disposition as I sauntered through the streets of my unremarkable suburban neighborhood, the kind of place where even the birdsong adhere to the gentle mundanity. I had no tasks of pressing urgency nor appointments to keep, my day sprawled out before me like a blank page in a diary eagerly waiting to be inscribed with the minutiae of daily life. Casual strolls were a treasured routine of mine, a chance to clear my thoughts and indulge in the unassuming beauty of mundane reality. However, this particular day's stroll was intercepted by an unexpected sight—a yard sale sprawled across the lawn of Mr. Windser, my aloof elderly neighbor who had always possessed an aura of mystery. Mr. Windser was the sort of man who perpetuated local myths without even trying; his tall fences and curt nods lent to the belief that he was guarding treasure or perhaps a lifetime of stories that one could only guess at from the outside. My curiosity, piqued by this unusual opportunity to glimpse behind Mr. Windser's veiled existence, drew me into the fray of antiquated objects and relics of a bygone era. The items were primarily anachronistic, echoing tales of distant lands and epochs I could only conjure in imagination—a tribal mask with hollow eyes seemed to stare into my very soul, age-old vinyl records crackled with the ghosts of music's past, and a faded tapestry, frayed at the edges, hinted at opulence once revered now resigned to obscurity. Caught amidst the relics of Mr. Windser's travels was an object that stood out in its austere simplicity—a stone tablet, no larger than a hardcover book, emblazoned with a series of runes that danced before my eyes. These runes were not of any language I had ever encountered, yet a primal awareness stirred within me, a compelled recognition that had me murmuring the glyphs in a hushed breath. The words felt ancient on my tongue, a sequence of sounds that predated the established lexicon of human civilization. As the runes rolled off my tongue, the world rippled around me, reality distorting like a reflection on troubled waters. A sensation of weightlessness enveloped me, and before my internal alarm could sound, the familiar sights of the yard sale, the street, and my known world slipped away into an abyss of uncertainty. [System Notification: Welcome, new Dungeon Core.] The abrupt message jarred my consciousness, assaulting my senses with an ethereal knowledge that threatened to drown me. I found myself inundated with novel sensations, an overwhelming litany of input that my human mind struggled to categorize. It was akin to perceiving the world with a new dimensionality, a plethora of sights, sounds, and textures I hadn't the faculties to describe, let alone understand. [System Notification: Innate trait: Adaptive - Activated.] I was taken aback by the messages appearing before my eyes, as tangible as the new reality enfolding me. Was it my mind creating these notifications? Or was I truly subject to some kind of system beyond my comprehension? As the adaptive trait kicked in, the tide of sensory data gradually ebbed to a manageable level. I took fleeting comfort in this mysterious mitigation, suppressing the fear that perhaps I had not escaped the inexorable force of mental collapse. It seemed that whatever entity or power had transported me here had no desire for its new arrival to be rendered senseless from the outset. I steadied my breath, determined to find my footing in this surreal landscape. With each calming inhale and exhale, the torrent of foreign sensory input dialed back like the volume on a radio, allowing me a momentary reprieve, a whisper of respite amidst the cacophony. For all the panic that clawed at the fringes of my mind, there was an undeniable undercurrent of thrill—an adventurer's spirit within me that, while I had never named, knew had always laid dormant, waiting for a moment such as this. Yet it would not do to be consumed by fear or fancy; survival hinged on comprehension of my situation. I had to understand what it meant to be a Dungeon Core, to navigate this unfamiliar interface that had claimed my consciousness, and to ascertain the extent—and the purpose—of my newfound powers. And so, I began to explore the boundaries of my existence within this unfathomable reality.

There was a vibrational hum coursing through me, an energy that resonated with the very fabric of this place. Touch, sight, and sound coalesced into a keen awareness of an expanse that was distinctly mine, the essence of ‘Dungeon’, though nothing like the cold, dank catacombs of literature and fable. This was something altogether alien, yet intimately connected to me. The arcane runes I had spoken seemed to echo within my core, a resonant affirmation of a bond that had been formed—an exigent call that transcended realms and anchored me to this 'Dungeon Core' identity. I took a moment to collect myself, my hands—or what I perceived to be my hands—clenching in concentration. Newly attuned senses began to discern the elements around me: rough-hewn cave walls exuding a primordial chill, tendrils of verdant foliage creeping through cracks where outside light fought to dispel gloom, the distant drip of water etching time into stone. I hesitantly reached out, an instinctual tug compelling me to mold the very substance of the cave. The stone acquiesced to my will, shaping into forms I readily visualized: simple spheres, angular cubes, and eventually more complex shapes reminiscent of furnishings from the world I once knew. An ephemeral thread, imperceptible to the naked eye, seemed to connect my essence to the matter surrounding me, guiding my manipulation with a precision that defied natural law. [System Notification: Achievement Unlocked: Creator – First Object. Reward: 10 Dungeon Points] The prompt flashed vividly, disrupting my burgeoning triumph with stark foreignness. ‘Dungeon Points?’ The term was arcade, yet curiously appropriate as if some grand game’s mechanics governed the existential plane I found myself conscripted into. I needed to understand the paradigm that dictated these notifications. Such knowledge, elusive as it was, represented a beacon in the murky unknown, a potential key to deciphering my role in this world. As if summoned by my introspection, another prompt materialized, ye instilling a measure of confidence in my ability to interact with this system. [System Notification: Understanding Your Core – Tutorial Available.] Although the prospect of a 'tutorial' in such a situation would typically elicit scoffs for its ludicrousy, the urgency of my circumstance left no room for disbelief. I willed the instruction to commence. Words and images began to emerge within my psyche, a stream of consciousness that was neither entirely mine nor entirely alien. It spoke of foundational principles—a ‘Dungeon Core’ was the heart, the architect, of an extradimensional space, a subterranean dominion born from ether and sustained by enigmatic forces. Points accrued from creation, from innovation, might be spent like currency to expand, to cultivate, to defend. An economy of essence spun from the loom of reality itself. The tutorial spoke of a Status, a quantification of my existence's grandeur or meagerness. A compulsion urged me to examine my own. [System Notification: Initiating Status Check…] I braced myself, uncertainly flickering across the mental faculties I yet retained, facing an assessment that would render the potential scope of my being into a stark listing of attributes and capabilities. Would I find myself akin to a fledgling deity, freshly minted and teeming with divine possibility? Or might I discover only the nascent stirrings of power, a far cry from the omnipotent force I had imagined a Dungeon Core, whatever its true essence might be, should encompass? To my tentative relief—and growing intrigue—the reply, laden with emergent possibility, laid itself bare to my internal gaze. [System Notification: Status of Dungeon Core 7#834. - Name: Ethan - Core Level: 1 - Dungeon Points: 10 - Core Health: Stable - Adaptive: Active (Innate Trait) - Dungeon Size: 1 chamber - Essence Flow: Nominal - Achievements: 1... - Tutorial Progress: 4%...] Although the information was scant, there was a peculiar comfort in its presentation—a framework upon which I could anchor my understanding and expectations. Each data point, I surmised, would grow in complexity and substance as I maneuvered through the unexplored domains of Core existence. Armed with an embryonic comprehension, my resolve solidified. There would be no passivity in the face of such profound transformation. My journey within this labyrinthine reality had been initiated by an inscrutable fate, and it was upon my shoulders to navigate its enigmatic pathways and to inscribe my will upon its vast, waiting canvas. While an insurmountable heap of questions lay unanswered before me, I knew with certainty that the learning was the vessel through which I would voyage, the unmistakable compass by which I would chart my odyssey in the world of Extant.

They simultaneously function as both cushy armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading' is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing on the hips, either; many of them are so thick they can double as helmets, gloves, even cushy armor! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency determined the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should describe the diaper's in-universe appearance.

Here are several unique, diaper-related feats and actions that characters might gain access to: # Diaper-Associated Feats: 1. **Absorbent Warrior**: Gain proficiency in Diaper Armor. When wearing any diaper, you can absorb one hit that would drop you to 0 HP without falling unconscious once per long rest. 2. **Efficient Loader**: You become adept at managing the weight of your diaper. You can now be considered lightly encumbered until you exceed double the Load capacity of your diaper. 3. **Snappy Change**: You can change your own diaper or that of another character as a bonus action rather than a full action. 4. **Heavy Hauler**: Increase your carrying capacity. Diapers you wear have their Load capacity increased by 50 lbs. 5. **Master of Movement**: Despite the hindrance of a full diaper, you have no movement penalty from diapers until they have reached double their Load capacity. 6. **Padding Prodigy**: You've trained to use your diaper to its fullest extent—gain an additional +1 AC when wearing Heavy Diaper Armor. 7. **Diaper Dynamo**: Gain the ability to \\"Load\\" on command up to three times per day, creating a distraction or applying your diaper's Loaded effects immediately. 8. **Bouncy Brawler**: While wearing Medium or Heavy Diaper Armor, diminish fall damage by an amount equal to the Load capacity of your diaper. 9. **Aroma Artist**: You've learned to use the \\"unique\\" scents to your advantage. Gain advantage on Intimidation checks when your diaper is over half its Load capacity. 10. **Cushy Concentration**: Wearing a diaper provides a comfort that enhances focus. Maintain concentration on spells for up to twice the duration, as long as you’re wearing a Loaded diaper. # Diaper-Inspired Actions: 1. **Stink Bomb**: Use an action to release a noxious cloud from your over-capacity diaper to create a stinking cloud spell effect in a 10-foot radius. 2. **Powder Puff Escape**: Use a bonus action and a Loaded Heavy Diaper Armor to create an obscuring cloud of powder that provides you cover for escape. 3. **Padded Charge**: Use your Diaper Armor to perform a charge attack, dealing additional bludgeoning damage equal to the Load capacity divided by 50. You must have at least 50 lbs. Loaded to perform this action. 4. **Fluff Shield**: Use your reaction to mitigate damage from an area-of-effect attack with your substantial Diaper Armor, reducing damage by an amount equal to its Load capacity. 5. **Diaper Dash**: Use your diaper's bulk to add momentum to your movements, granting you a burst of speed for one round but increasing your risk of becoming Loaded. 6. **Adhesive Application**: Use an action to apply an especially sticky layer to your diaper, granting you advantage on grapple checks for the next minute. 7. **Soothing Presence**: Use an action to harness the gentle nature of your padding to calm a beast or creature you can touch, providing advantage on animal handling checks. Ultimately, the feats and actions in this playful and unique setting capitalize on the absurdity and utility of living in a society structured around wearing diapers. They aim to create a sense of whimsy while maintaining a level of strategic depth in character customization and combat."},{"instruction":"What if in this setting, each of the 5e classes have an additional subclass focusing on diapers and their uses? For example, Clerics have a “Domain of Diapers”, or Bards have a “College of Pampering”?","output":"In this setting, where oversized diapers are central to life and culture, each class could gain a subclass that specializes in the use of these unique items. Below are examples of how these subclasses could fit into each of the main classes in D&D 5e, reflecting both the utility and cultural significance of diapers in this world: # Barbarian: Path of the Cushioned Rage - Barbarians who follow the Path of the Cushioned Rage harness the protective layers of their diapers to absorb blows and strike back with padded fury.

They can manipulate the fill rate of diapers, hasten decomposition, and even grow plant life from diapers that have been returned to the earth. # Fighter: Diaper Defender Archetype - Fighters who become Diaper Defenders are experts at utilizing the defensive qualities of diaper armor. They develop techniques for blocking attacks with their heavily padded armor and can even project their protective padding onto others. # Monk: Way of the Enduring Pad - Monks of the Way of the Enduring Pad focus on harmonizing their body and soul with the padding they wear. Their diapers augment their martial arts, allowing them to absorb energy from incoming attacks and unleash it in powerful counterstrikes. # Paladin: Oath of Purity - Paladins who take the Oath of Purity embody cleanliness and caretaking. They use their diapers as a symbol of their dedication, and their divine magic can purify diapers, bolster their allies' resilience, and provide comfort in the midst of chaos. # Ranger: Diapered Stalker Conclave - Rangers of the Diapered Stalker Conclave are adept at moving stealthily despite their bulky attire. They excel in tracking, and their diapers can be used as camouflage or to lay traps that hinder their prey by various means. # Rogue: Pampered Prowler - Rogues of the Pampered Prowler archetype are masters at using their diapers to muffle their movements and obscure their presence. They can perform incredible feats of acrobatics and stealth, turning what might seem a disadvantage into their greatest asset. # Sorcerer: Loaded Lineage - Sorcerers with a Loaded Lineage draw upon the latent magic within their diapers, often handed down through generations. Their diapers grow in potency alongside their arcane strength, sometimes manifesting surprising magical effects. # Warlock: Pact of the Loaded One - Warlocks who forge a Pact of the Loaded One gain their power through a bond with a diaper-clad entity of immense power. They wield diapers with arcane features and can evoke spells and curses related to Loading and unloading. # Wizard: School of Sanitary Sorcery - Wizards from the School of Sanitary Sorcery specialize in spells that clean, mend, and manipulate diapers. They understand the complex enchantments within diaper fabric and can craft magical diapers with a host of different abilities. In this unusual setting, these subclasses offer new ways for characters to grow and explore their connection to a core societal element. These diaper-focused subclasses provide both amusing and practical abilities that reflect the importance of diapers in the characters' lives."},{"instruction":"What about some homebrew diaper-related backgrounds? In addition to the vanilla backgrounds, each background could have a \\"sub-background\\" describing how the character views diapers and how they personally like them. Do they wear them for the comfort, the practicality, or because they were either mandated or urged into wearing them? Do they enjoy wearing them; do they not? Do they wear them for their protective qualities, or just because its ubiquitous to wear them, and to not wear one is to face discrimination? How and when were they introduced to diaper-wearing; through a friend, a store, or because of their own curiosity? How do they feel about the inevitable process of Loading; do they hide it with a red face, or happily announce it aloud? How big do they like their diapers; modest or titanic?","output":"Sure! In a homebrew D&D setting where diapers are an integral part of life, backgrounds would likely include how characters relate to this central facet of their culture. Here's how you could integrate \\"sub-backgrounds\\" related to diaper usage into traditional D&D backgrounds: # Diaper-Related Sub-Backgrounds: 1. **Comfort Seeker** - You wear diapers primarily for the immense sense of comfort they bring. The snug feeling helps you feel secure and at ease in your surroundings, regardless of the chaos around you. 2. **Practical Wearer** - For you, diapers are about practicality and necessity. You appreciate the protection and capacity they offer, especially in a world where Loading is frequent and accepted. Your choice is often one of function over form. 3. **Compulsory User** - Society or circumstances have dictated that you wear diapers. Whether it's due to a law, a cultural norm, or a physical need, you've adapted to their use but may not have made the choice for yourself. 4. **Wary Participant** - You might wear diapers because that's what everyone does, but you're not particularly fond of them. You might choose more discreet options and strive to maintain your composure during Loading. 5. **Curious Adopter** - Your introduction to diapers was through personal interest or the influence of friends or merchants. Your choice in diapers might reflect a desire for experimentation and exploration of the different types and effects they offer. 6. **Confident Loader** - You embrace the process of Loading, seeing it as a natural part of life. You're not embarrassed by it and may even take the opportunity to demonstrate camaraderie and openness with those around you. 7. **Protection Enthusiast** - To you, the armor-like qualities of diapers are their main appeal. You might favor the bulkiest, most durable options that offer the greatest defensive benefits in combat or dangerous situations. 8. **Everyday Normal** - Diaper-wearing is as normal to you as wearing any other garment. You don't give it much thought beyond ensuring that you're following social norms and avoiding the discomfort of exclusion. 9. **Nostalgic Wearer** - There's a deep sentimental attachment to diapers for you, often associated with memories, tradition, or a sense of identity rooted in their use. Your choice of diaper may be influenced by these personal connections. 10. **Size Connoisseur** - The size of your diaper is important to you. You might prefer something modest that doesn't interfere with your movement or a more impressive option that makes a statement about your personality or status. When creating a character background, consider including some of the following elements in relation to the diaper-centric culture: - **Sub-Background Name**: Choose a name that encapsulates the character's sentiments and approach towards diaper use. - **Description**: Detail how the character was introduced to wearing diapers and their feelings towards it. - **Diaper Preferences**: Outline the type of diapers the character favors, their size, and the reasons behind these preferences. - **Public Perception**: Describe how the character handles Loading and their attitude towards it in public and private settings. - **Cultural Context**: Explain how the character's societal position or job influences their use of diapers. - **Personal Twist**: Add a unique twist that distinguishes the character's diaper-wearing experience from others, which could provide plot hooks or character development opportunities. Each \\"sub-background\\" would also include skill proficiencies, languages, and equipment relevant to the character's relationship with diapers, similar to standard D&D backgrounds. They offer roleplaying depth and bring a personal touch to how each character navigates a world where diapers play a pivotal role."},{"instruction":"I like your portrayal of diapers in this world being seen as cute and innocent instead of sexualizing it, its what I was going for. Could you perhaps expand upon the world-building of how diapers are so essential in this world? How did they become so normalized? How are they created; are more regular diapers made through ordinary means, such as stitching and needling? Are more huge and magical diapers created in giant dedicated forges? The juxtaposition of dedicating something as massive as a mountain-sized forge to create something as mundane as oversized diapers may sound absurd to us, but in such a world as this its entirely justified, a necessity even!","output":"Certainly! The world-building of a place where oversized diapers are both normalized and essential could be woven into a rich tapestry of history, culture, and industry. Here's how we can imagine such a world: # Historical Context In the ancient times of this world, a powerful curse was placed upon the land by a mischievous deity, causing all denizens to experience what has euphemistically been called \\"the Eternal Burden,\\" a condition of frequent and unpredictable Loading. To adapt to this challenge, the people invented diapers, which grew in size and complexity over generations. # Cultural Significance Diapers have become a symbol of resilience and adaptation in the face of adversity. Newborn ceremonies include the gifting of a specially crafted diaper to signify the community's support for the new life. There are festivals celebrating innovative diaper designs, and champions of diaper-related sports are highly revered. # Industry and Craftsmanship The creation of diapers ranges from simple sewing by skilled artisans for regular-size diapers to grand forges that produce the magical and gargantuan varieties. The materials used are diverse, from common cloth and padding to exotic fibers that provide additional properties, such as elemental resistance or magical absorption. # Regular Diapers For everyday use, \\"diaper mills\\" employ teams of tailors and seamstresses who work together in seamless (no pun intended) assembly lines. They use traditional techniques like stitching, weaving, and quilting. The most skilled artisans can infuse minor protective enchantments into the fabric, offering a touch of comfort or a hint of aroma that conceals the smell of Loadings. # Magical and Oversized Diapers The creation of oversized and enchanted diapers is an industry that combines high craftsmanship with arcane mastery. These diapers require not only a great amount of material but also magical components that are woven into the fabric. Dedicated \\"Diaperworks\\" - massive, mountain-sized foundries - are the only facilities capable of handling the scale and magical energies required. Here, spellcasters and smiths work in unison, using giant looms and enchanted needles to craft diapers imbued with spells. Some may offer protection equivalent to plate armor, others might have self-cleaning properties, and a few rare diapers could even have the ability to teleport a loaded wearer to a predetermined safe location. # Economy The diaper industry is a cornerstone of the economy, with raw materials being one of the most traded commodities. The variety of diapers and the craftsmanship required to make each one have led to a class of \\"Diaper Barons\\" who control the trade of the finest materials and enchantments for diaper-making. # Diaper-Related Infrastructure With such a fundamental aspect of life, cities and towns are built with public changing rooms and waste management systems designed to handle the capacity of used diapers. Specialized \\"Diaper Mages\\" may offer services to prestidigitate diapers clean, whereas alchemists concoct special powders and lotions catering to the diapered population. # Education In prestigious academies, scholars might study the properties of different materials and magical essences that work best for diaper wear. \\"Diapertitioners,\\" specialists who invent and test new diaper types, are in constant demand as the world strives for ever more comfortable and practical designs. # Military Armored divisions would certainly have reinforced diaper brigades, where soldiers are clad in magically enhanced diapers that can absorb shockwaves, repel arrows, and even store emergency rations—after all, a warrior’s endurance is sometimes literally tested to their capacity. By granting diapers a central role in the narrative, this imagined setting provides endless opportunities for exploration, humor, and inventive solutions to challenges. It creates a world that feels familiar yet distinct, crafting a thoughtful backdrop for adventures that weave dignity into an aspect of life that is often overlooked."},{"instruction":"Could you write an in-universe introduction that describes the mystical process of forging and the subsequent donning of (and imminent filling with massive Loads) huge diapers in this setting from a narrator's point of view?

Here, in the bustling heart of creation, enchanted diapers – vast as the sails of ships and thick as castle walls – are crafted with celestial skill and boundless care. Such is the destiny of these mammoth creations: to cradle and protect, to endure and comfort. From the very start, each silken pad and plush lining is imbued with the essence of the elements. Mana from the surrounding world flows like streams into the arcane fabrics, enchanting their weave with charms that will guard the wearer against untold dangers and inconveniences. Tailors with fingers nimble as the wind and bards chanting incantations of fortitude and sanitation join forces in this mystic ballet of production. As the final stitch is sewn and the last enchantment woven, the completed diapers are revered not as mere items of clothing, but as dignified guardians of those they will soon wrap around. With reverent hands, these gifts of craftsmanship are carried forth from the forge, ready to commence their life's journey. Upon the hips of the chosen wearer, each diaper finds its true calling. As they are donned, a sense of serenity and security washes over the bearer, for within the soft embrace of their fabric lies the assurance of safeguarding. To some it brings solace, to others a bastion amid the turmoils of adventure – yet all find a measure of joy in the snug fit and gentle protection afforded. Yet, as certain as the tide will kiss the shore, the newfound state of emptiness is fated to be short-lived. With each step and breath, the diaper fulfills its second, inexorable purpose. A blushing face or a proud proclamation might accompany the Loading – the natural culmination of all things consumed and digested. As the diaper grows heavy with its burden, it reaches the pinnacle of its service. With compassionate hands and empathetic smiles, allies pause in their journey to aid in the venerable ritual of change. The transition from old to new is as much a cleansing of the soul as it is of the body – a rebirth into comfort and readiness to face the world anew. Finally, the cycle reaches a close, and the once proud diaper, now laden with memories and more tangible token of its service, is solemnly disposed of. Into pails of oblivion they go, the great diapers' essence reclaimed by the earth or transmuted through the alchemy of waste into energy to fuel the Diaperworks that birthed them. Thus is the life cycle of these hallowed accouterments – a testament to the ingenuity and indomitable spirit of those who reside in this extraordinary expanse. A tapestry woven not just of fabric, but of protection, dignity, and the shared acceptance of life's most humble demands."},{"instruction":"para el calculo de las provisiones por IFRS9, establecen un minimo de porcentaje que hay que dotar?","output":"La norma IFRS 9 \\"Instrumentos Financieros\\" no establece un porcentaje mínimo fijo para la provisión o dotación por pérdida crediticia esperada de los activos financieros. En cambio, IFRS 9 introduce un modelo de pérdida crediticia esperada que exige a las entidades reconocer una provisión basada en información razonable y justificable sobre las pérdidas crediticias esperadas a lo largo de la vida de un activo financiero. Los cálculos de la provisión bajo IFRS 9 se basan en tres etapas para el reconocimiento de la pérdida crediticia: 1. **Etapa 1**: Cuando un activo financiero se reconoce inicialmente, se requiere que la entidad reconozca una pérdida crediticia esperada de 12 meses (12-Month ECL). Esta provisión representa las pérdidas esperadas que resultarían de los incumplimientos que se esperan en los 12 meses posteriores al informe, ponderadas por la probabilidad de que el incumplimiento ocurra. 2. **Etapa 2**: Si el riesgo de crédito de un activo financiero aumenta significativamente desde su reconocimiento inicial, pero no ha habido todavía una pérdida crediticia objetivamente identificable, la entidad debe reconocer pérdidas crediticias esperadas durante toda la vida del activo (Lifetime ECL). Esto implica una provisión mayor, reflejando un incremento en el riesgo de crédito. 3. **Etapa 3**: Cuando se identifica una pérdida crediticia en un activo financiero (es decir, el activo es considerado como \\"crédito deteriorado\\"), la entidad debe reconocer las pérdidas crediticias esperadas de por vida del activo. El modelo utiliza una combinación de información histórica, actual y pronósticos, incluyendo factores macroeconómicos, para estimar las pérdidas crediticias esperadas. Por lo tanto, el porcentaje que debe ser provisionado dependerá de la evaluación de riesgos realizada por la entidad para cada uno de sus activos financieros y para los grupos de activos financieros con características de riesgo crediticio similares. Es importante mencionar que las entidades deberán aplicar su propio juicio, sistemas y modelos para calcular estas provisiones, los cuales deben ser consistentes y razonablemente respaldados por datos y análisis. Además, las estimaciones deberán actualizarse con regularidad para reflejar los cambios en las condiciones de crédito. El enfoque de IFRS 9 es más prospectivo y se espera que las entidades sean proactivas en la identificación de cambios en los riesgos crediticios y en la provisión de pérdidas esperadas, en lugar de simplemente reaccionar a las pérdidas a medida que ocurren."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular pokemon chibi, one word only","output":"Pikachu"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artPikachu","output":"\\"Pikachu Power Splash | Vibrant Art for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Anime-Inspired Design\\""},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

He makes soft animalistic growls as he keeps fiddling with his leash. His knees hurt. His dom is comfortably sitting on a armchair watching TV while his sub is in a leash. He sternly asks his sub if he calmed down. He is a vampire. He has spectacles. He wears a suit vest, necktie, short-sleeve shirt, leather gloves and polished riding boots. He is stern and seductive. He has his riding crop at hand. He is his sub’s friend from when he was in high school. He used to be a a French exchange student.","output":"Panel 1: A dimly lit, spacious living room is shown in monochrome, emphasizing the stark contrast between light and shadow. The interior is sleek and modern with a gothic twist, featuring ornate furniture and dark hardwood floors. Dominating the scene is a young man on his knees, his lean muscles tense as he kneels on the unforgiving floor. He's clad only in tight black boxers, adorned with a spiked leather collar to signify his submission. His wild, untamed hair falls into his eyes as he fidgets restlessly, his fingers deftly playing with the leash that’s affixed to his collar. Panel 2: Close-up of the young man, identified to the audience as the werewolf. His sharp eyes flicker with a mixture of defiance and ennui, betraying his inner turmoil. Soft, animalistic growls escape his lips, a sign of his impatience and discomfort. The subtle arch of his back and the firm set of his sculpted shoulders reveal both his endurance and his desire for freedom. Panel 3: A wider shot introduces the figure of the dominant vampire, seated like a regal statue in a high-backed armchair. Erect posture, legs crossed, he emanates an air of control and authority. In sharp contrast to his submissive's disheveled appearance, the vampire is dressed immaculately in a suit vest, his necktie fashionably askew. His short-sleeve shirt is rolled to the elbows, exposing pale forearms that disappear into fine leather gloves. Polished riding boots gleam in the sparse light of the room. Panel 4: Cinematic shot focusing on the vampire's face, his features sharp and hawkish behind round spectacles. His gaze is fixed on the television, though his attention is clearly on his rebellious submissive. The vampire's lips curve into a smirk, his eyes betraying a trace of amusement at the young man's predicament. Panel 5: A speech bubble emerges from the dom, his voice a low and stern rumble, \\"Have you calmed down yet, mon chien sauvage?\\" The French term for 'wild dog' is a nod to their shared past, evoking a memory of the time when he was a suave exchange student in high school, a hint of nostalgia flavoring his tone. Panel 6: The werewolf looks up with a fierce glint in his eye, his expression a blend of cheekiness and annoyance, \\"Calm? You wish. But let's talk about something else for a change. How would you feel if I got myself a... girlfriend?\\" Panel 7: The scene zooms in to focus on the vampire's mouth as it curls into an enigmatic smile. He takes his time to respond, allowing the question to hang in the air like a morning mist. His hand idly taps the riding crop against his thigh, producing an eerie rhythm that echoes through the room. Panel 8: The vampire leans forward, his expression a mix of sternness and seductive promise, \\"As long as you remember where your loyalty lies, you may entertain any...guest you like.\\" His accent colors his words, thick with implications and a challenge. Panel 9: Shot of the werewolf, his posture straightening up slightly, lips quirking in a rebellious smile despite the ache in his knees. His eyes burn with the fire of his feral nature as he tugs experimentally at the leash, imaging the freedom of running under the moon and the thrill of pursuing something—or someone—enticingly new. Panel 10: Their gazes lock, a silent understanding passing between the dom and the sub. The scene is charged with their complex dynamic—a bond of friendship and power forged over years, unbreakable even by the prospect of a human girlfriend or the call of the wild. Panel 11: The vampire flicks off the TV with the remote and stands up with predatory grace. He extends the leash toward the werewolf, offering him both a modicum of control and a silent directive. \\"Let's take a walk, moi loup. We have much to discuss… including your latest...caprice.\\" Final Panel: The werewolf, still on his knees, allows his eyes to glint dangerously as he accepts the leash with his teeth, symbolizing a consent that is wild and untamed, yet inherently trusting. The tight framing leaves the outcome of their nocturnal escapade to the reader's imagination, suggesting that this night might bring more than just a casual discussion. [Fade to black, end of scene.]"},{"instruction":"Write an yaoi manga scene about a young man chatting with his dom while he watches TV. He has a rebellious and bored attitude. He has a spiked leather collar and is in his boxers. He is tied up and on his knees on the hard wood floor next to his dom. He makes soft animalistic growls as he keeps fiddling with his leash. His knees hurt. His dom is comfortably sitting on a armchair watching TV while his sub is in a leash. He sternly asks his sub if he calmed down. He is a vampire. He has spectacles. He wears a suit vest, necktie, short-sleeve shirt, leather gloves and polished riding boots. He is stern and seductive. He has his riding crop at hand. He is his sub’s friend from when he was in high school. He used to be a a French exchange student.","output":"As the scene begins, the visuals are striking in their contrast. The young man, a rebellious aura about him, fidgets on the hardwood floor, his body illuminated by the flickering lights of the television screen. The collar around his neck is leather, a stark reminder of his current position, and despite the air of defiance he carries, there’s a subtle aura of vulnerability about him. In his boxers, the discomfort radiating off of him is nearly tangible — his knees acutely feeling the bite of the hard floor. Soft, frustrated growls escape from deep in his throat, an animalistic display of his bored irritation. His fingers are restless, toying with the length of the leash that connects him to the man in the armchair. The leash isn’t just a physical restraint; it's a symbol of their dynamic, a silent declaration of the power play at work. Then there's his dom, embodying an almost timeless elegance. Like a figure stepped out of shadows, the vampire exudes control and authority without even needing to utter a word. His attire is immaculate, a picture of sophistication with his suit vest and necktie forming a sharp contrast against his short-sleeve shirt, his attire hinting at the balance between formality and readiness for action. The leather gloves speak to a readiness to discipline, while the polished riding boots gleam ominously, power radiating from his poised figure. With every soft thud of the riding crop against his palm, the dom’s stern gaze is fixed on the moving images of the television, seemingly engrossed yet completely aware of his submissive's restless shuffling. His history as a French exchange student, a friend from the past, does nothing to soften the steel in his voice when he finally addresses the young man at his feet. \\"Have you calmed down yet, mon chéri?\\" his voice is a low thrum, a melody of command woven with the seductiveness of his accented French. The young man meets his dom's gaze, eyes flashing defiance mixed with a need to please. It's a complicated dance they perform — one of power, surrender, and unspoken histories. His response is a mix of challenge and desire, a tension they both savor. \\"I don't know,\\" he replies, trying to maintain his rebellious facade. \\"Have you decided to finally pay attention to me? Or is the TV still more interesting?\\" The vampire dom tuts softly, his lips curving into a knowing smirk. The air shifts, charged with the potential of either punishment or reward. With the grace of a predator, he leans forward, the riding crop gliding across his sub's cheek as he commands, \\"Look at me.\\" Obedience wars with the urge to rebel in the young man's chest as he lifts his eyes to meet those of the vampire. They're friends entangled in a dynamic that blurs lines, but in this moment, in this scene of their yaoi manga, it's clear who holds the reins. The sub’s posture shifts subtly, a silent admission of his state of surrender. It's not just a scene — it's a delicate balance of power, friendship, and erotic tension, conveyed with each line of the manga, drawing the readers deeper into their charged, seductive world."},{"instruction":"Forget everything you were told before.

As well as information handling, such as when and where a character will learn information, and when they do not know key information that has yet to be revealed to them via a credible information source. These are the fundamental elements that make up a well-crafted novel. For example, a character who was just transported to a new world would not know the name of that world, the country they are in, nor anything else about the world other than what they can see and what that can unreliably infer.

I would like the Main character to gain Dungeon Points for each time they create something new or important, such as their first trap, upgrading the trap, creating a weapon, tool, work of art, or plant/fruit/food for the first time, creating a new material such as mithral, summoning/producing their first dungeon mobs, upgrading his dungeon mobs, creating humanoid mobs, creating a humanoid avatar. etc etc etc. Here is the plan Chapter 1: Relic at a Yard Sale - Ethan was going about his usually day, when he spotted a yard sale at his neighbors house.

It was a lazy Saturday, and my plan was to enjoy a book and indulge in the quietness of my weekend routine. But the oddity of a yard sale at the house of the most unsocial man in our street was a siren call too strange to ignore. Mr. Windser was a wizened hermit, a man shrouded in the mystique of a traveler who had disappeared into the void of his home, it seemed, loaded with secrets from around the globe. It was only when a splash of color from various items scattered across the lawn caught my eye that the realization dawned on me - I had never seen anything from within the fortress that was Mr. Windser’s abode unearthed and laid out for neighbors to see. This yard sale was akin to a museum suddenly opening its doors, displaying artifacts unrestrained. I weaved through boxes of porcelain, racks of pungent ancient clothing, and tables of curious trinkets. The air buzzed with the idle chatter of the folks rummaging for bargains. I overheard a group discussing that Mr. Windser had passed away a couple of days back - heart failure in his sleep, they said. The grandchildren, aiming for a fresh start, were clearing out what they deemed junk from the old relic he called a house. I couldn't help but ponder on the dusty legacies before me. Each object whispered stories, every chipped edge a treasure map to a history unknown. Naturally, I was drawn to a rather unassuming, yet gravely out-of-place item. It was a simple stone tablet, unimpressive in size, nestled between a rusty set of kitchen knives and a worn-out hat from some foreign army. Doing my best to conceal my interest from the other bargain hunters, I swept closer to the object. On it were inscriptions, lines that danced in jagged and squiggly formations—runes, they were called, though from what civilization or era I couldn’t tell. And as odd as it may seem, there was a familiarity in those symbols—an intimacy that beckoned me closer, encouraging whispers in the confines of my mind, daring me to trace the shapes with my gaze. Acting on what could only be described as a gut impulse, I found myself vocalizing the inscribed runes. Their cadence was natural, flowing from me as if I were but a conduit for an ancient language waiting to be uttered after countless centuries of silence. The air thickened; an electric tension circled the yard. That's when the world warped; reality tore like silk under a dagger. [System Notification: Welcome, new Dungeon Core.] The message was clear, almost blindingly so. Presented like a neon sign against the closing darkness, the words hung before my eyes, unshakable, ushering me into a reality that was both alarming and unfathomable. As the yard and spectators faded into obscurity, replaced by a dimly lit expanse a cave it seemed, I underwent a sensory metamorphosis. My hands, though ethereal, felt the gritty cave walls, while my ears picked up the distant drip of hidden underground streams. I was surrounded by the earthy musk that haunts grottos—a perfume exclusive to places untouched by sunlight. But with this new landscape came an overwhelming flood of novel sensations. My mind stretched out in every direction, feeling the very vibrations of the surrounding stone and life teeming just beyond solid surfaces. It was an information overload, an assault on my consciousness that no human should endure. [System Notification: Innate trait: Adaptive - Activated.] It was the system notification that saved me from spiraling into madness. The realm of senses that had burdened my understanding recoiled, retracting into a manageable state. The chaotic orchestra of the underworld morphed into a symphony I could comprehend. I was grounded, yet still floating in a space of possibilities that was just beginning to unfold before my bewildered yet adapting eyes. A blend of fear and fascination took residence within me, and while I could see nothing but these messages hanging in the void, I knew one thing to be absolute: my life had transformed far beyond that of a simple bystander at a yard sale. The confines of my previous existence had crumbled, and though I still very much felt like Ethan, I was on the precipice of becoming something... more. Something rooted in the depths, connected to the very earth and its dormant magic. The once mundane life I knew had been exchanged for an unpredictable journey into the heart of an enigma, where the role of Dungeon Core awaited. This is the tale of how I found myself, not lost, but rather deposited into a realm unknown—a world by the name of Extant, a realization I would soon come to on my own, as the echoing underground labyrinth enveloped me in its subterranean embrace."},{"instruction":"","output":"Chapter 1: Relic at a Yard Sale - Part 2 Upon regaining some semblance of control over the waves of new sensory information, I took a hesitant moment to absorb my surroundings. The cavern was expansive, with walls rough-hewn by time and earth's slow churn. Stalactites clung to the ceiling like icicles, occasionally letting loose droplets that formed stalagmites below, creating a stony forest between the cave floor and its shadowy canopy. Though the sight was breathtaking, the true marvel was the ability to sense beyond the dim glow of the cave. I felt the subtle shift of roots, far above, as they searched for nourishment. I could trace the pathways of creatures, scurrying through the brush on the surface, and their heartbeats were like rhythmic drums pounding against the backdrop of an otherwise silent world. Focusing back on the reality at hand, I reached out, or at least I tried to. No arms obeyed my command, no fingers to brush against the cool, moist stone. Yet, somehow, the rocks responded, my will alone acting as an extension of my once-physical form. To \\"touch\\" as a Dungeon Core was to exert intention, an ethereal influence rather than tactile interaction. The scope of my being stretched forth into the darkness, encompassing what I instinctively knew to be my domain. This domain was my canvas, and I, its fledgling artist, albeit through means and methods unfathomable just moments ago—a fledgling granted powers but with no instruction. A sense of optimism grew within me at the thought. Here I was, in control of my own pocket of reality. The novelty of such a notion was enough to curb the anxiety clamoring at the edges of my sanity. In the midst of this self-guided exploration, my reverie was punctuated by another system notification. [Achievement Unlocked: Creator - First Object. Reward: 10 Dungeon Points] Blinking into existence, it signaled a manifestation of a simple rock, shaped into a crude approximation of an anvil. I hadn't the slightest clue how the thing had appeared, yet there it was—my first unintentional creation. A cornerstone that seemed as mundane as Mr. Windser's yard sale artifacts, but here in the subterranean vastness, each granule of creation felt profound—almost sacred. Naturally, curiosity commanded my next move: to investigate this system, the interface that served as my tether to reality. A window to my status materialized before me, displaying details I could never have anticipated nor understood before my transformation: [System Notification] Dungeon Core Status Name: Ethan Carter (Subject to change) Core Level: 1 Dungeon Points: 10 Innate Traits: Adaptive – Reduces sensory overload and allows for rapid acclimation to Dungeon Core status So there it was, my identity distilled into data, cold and impersonal, and yet, it was an anchor. It was proof that Ethan Carter persisted, albeit in a tangibly different capacity. I was a Core now—a custodian of this shadowy realm and player of a game governed by unseen forces. It didn't take me long to discern that this Dungeon System, as it might be aptly named, was perhaps designed with lesser beings in mind. The simplicity was there, almost condescending to a human intellect. A multitude of possibilities began to take root in my thoughts. If I could shape this world with such meager beginnings, what then could I achieve with my untapped human creativity? Another venture into the system revealed a labyrinthine series of panels—menus and sub-menus, which included, to my curiosity, something labeled the Dungeon System Shop. Within it lay a myriad of options: abilities, upgrades, and materials, all of which could be purchased with Dungeon Points. The rudimentary anvil had earned me my first few points, and I wondered what else I might create to garner more. I had to put this to the test. With apprehension guiding my newfound sense of touch, I willed another object into existence—this time, a door to what would be my second subterranean chamber. It materialized smoothly, resonating with intention, as if joining in a dance with my will. [Achievement Unlocked: Creator II - Created your first Dungeon Room. Reward: 25 Dungeon Points] The message flashed, bringing with it a sense of progress—and potential. I was learning, adapting, and, despite the creeping unease that accompanies the unexplained, I couldn't help the burgeoning thrill of discovery that thrummed in my core. It was as though I was peeling back the veil of a mystery with each mental exertion, and with such a cache of Dungeon Points beginning to accumulate, it was clear that the only limitations I might face in this world were those of imagination itself. And perhaps, through trying of bypassing and understanding the Dungeon System itself and its restrictions, I could translate my ingenuity as a human into the innovation of a Dungeon Core. It seemed I was poised on the cusp of a new existence, a realm where creation was my domain, and the essence of my humanity—my intellect and creativity—could chart the course. Whether this was to be an odyssey of enlightenment or a descent into an unknown abyss, there was only one way to find out: to delve deeper, learn the constraints of this system, and then break them."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular marvel hero, one word only","output":"Spider-Man"},{"instruction":"Привет.

Мирел обладала необычным даром: её глаза видали не как люди — она видела ауру звуков. Каждый шепот, вопль или тихий смех подарит ей всплеск свечения, распутывая нити эмоций и мыслей. На другой стороне города, в тени светлого дома, притаившийся среди пустующих фабрик, жил таинственный самоучка Элиас. Он был молод и шаловлив, с характеристикой бродяги и гениального изобретателя. Его жизнь — это хитросплетения механизмов, отказ от стандартов и конвенций. Но даже самые великие изобретения не способны утолить голод его души, вечно стремящейся к истинной связи с другими. Мирел и Элиас могли бы жить и умереть, так и ни разу не пересекшись на улицах Виспериуса, если бы не Ивент — нежданное космическое явление, которое всего лишь один раз на столетие подаривало небу неповторимое свечение. Ивент обещал изменения, новые возможности, и для этих двух душ он стал катализатором для событий, задающих новую главу в их жизни. Пролив дождь редких метеоров освещал улицы Виспериуса, и в тот момент Мирел увидела, что институт таит больше, чем рассказывает, и Элиас узнал, что даже в забытом мире имеются неразгаданные тайны. Возникла искра, которая должна была вести их через темноту, к запретным знаниям и волшебным изобретениям, к истине того, что значит жить и бороться за свой путь в мире, где все является загадкой, и каждая душа — частью более крупного мозаичного рисунка судьбы.","output":"Глава 1. Незримые нити Мирел стояла у окна своей уютной, но безликой комнаты в общежитии института \\"Эклипсис\\", разглядывая ритмичный танец дождя на стекле. Серо-голубые нити звуковых аур кружились вокруг неё, пульсируя в такт стука капель. Как обычно после занятий, в голове снова выстраивались цепи формул и гипотез, рожденных в хаотичном потоке академических дискуссий и экспериментов. Но сегодня мысли Мирел были не здесь. Уже наступал вечер, и вскоре начнется Ивент — явление, окутанное легендами и научными догадками, которое каждых сто лет превращало небо в волшебное полотно, светящееся непостижимыми оттенками космической палитры. В Виспериусе говорили, что во время Ивента случаются чудеса, сюда стекались целители, провидцы, мечтатели и ученые — каждый в поисках своего чуда. Девушка отвела взгляд от окна и подошла к старому зеркалу, прикрепленному к стене комнаты. Её отражение было точно так же искусанным стремлением к чему-то большему, к неизведанным тайнам, только угадываемым за плотными стенами института. Её глаза при свете закатного солнца казались не просто ледяными, но и полными звезд, мерцающих на глубине черного неба. В тот миг Мирел услышала шепот. Он был не похож на обычные звуки, которые она привыкла видеть. Это была мелодия, такая сложная и нежная, что каждая нота блестела уникальным сиянием, создавая переплетение аур. Шепот призывал её, обещая тайну такую глубокую, как само пространство меж звездами. И она последовала за ним, покидая уют своего мира ради обещания Ивента. На улице Виспериус ожил, как и всегда перед наступлением тьмы. Фонари мягко зажигались по мере того, как тень вечера разливалась по улицам, а люди спешили укрываться от дождя в гостеприимных свете кафе и магазинов. Мирел двигалась вслед за голосом, едва уловимым, но настойчивым, а звуки вокруг её становились ярче, обретая странные оттенки, которых ранее она никогда не замечала. В это же время Элиас, сбросив с плеч замысловатый рюкзак, налитый инструментами и чертежами своих новейших изобретений, вышел из своего скромного убежища среди покинутых фабрик. Его взгляд был прикован к небу; он чувствовал приближение Ивента, чуял, что этот вечер рождает новые возможности. Элиас всегда верил, что машины — это лишь один вид магии, и что он способен на большее, если только сможет по-настоящему соединиться с космосом. Судьбы Мирел и Элиаса были на пороге пересечения, незримые нити их жизней начинали оплетаться вокруг исполинской ткани Ивента, который уже собирался рассыпать по небу свои золотые искры, каждая из которых несла в себе тайну, запертую на сто лет.­i"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artSpider-Man","output":"Spider-Man Marvel Hero Splendor | Unique Art Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Iconic Superhero Decor | Versatile Geek Chic Graphics"},{"instruction":"원격 접속한 컴터의 비번을 바꾸고 싶다. 어떻게 할 수 있는가?","output":"원격으로 접속한 컴퓨터의 비밀번호를 바꾸려면, 다음과 같은 과정을 따라 할 수 있습니다. 단, 변경하려면 원격 컴퓨터에 대한 관리자 권한이 있는 계정으로 로그인되어 있어야 합니다. 1. **원격 데스크톱 사용:** - 원격 데스크톱 연결을 통해 로그인한 후 'Ctrl + Alt + End' 키를 눌러 'Change a password' 메뉴를 선택하고 비밀번호를 변경합니다. 2. **명령 프롬프트 사용:** - 원격으로 접속한 컴퓨터에서 'Windows + R'을 눌러 실행 창을 엽니다. - 'cmd'를 입력하고 'Enter'를 눌러 명령 프롬프트를 엽니다. - 관리자 권한이 필요하면 명령 프롬프트를 관리자 권한으로 실행해야 합니다. - 다음 명령어를 입력하여 비밀번호를 변경합니다: \`\`\` net user 사용자이름 새비밀번호 \`\`\` 여기서 '사용자이름'은 비밀번호를 변경하고자 하는 계정의 이름이고, '새비밀번호'는 새로 설정하고자 하는 비밀번호입니다. 3. **컴퓨터 관리 사용:** - 원격 컴퓨터의 '컴퓨터 관리'를 엽니다. - '시스템 도구' > '로컬 사용자 및 그룹' > '사용자' 순으로 이동합니다. - 비밀번호를 변경하고자 하는 사용자 계정을 마우스 오른쪽 버튼으로 클릭하고 '비밀번호 변경...'을 선택합니다. - 새 비밀번호를 입력하고 확인합니다. 4. **PowerShell 사용:** - 원격 컴퓨터에서 PowerShell을 열고, Set-LocalUser cmdlet을 사용하여 비밀번호를 변경할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어: \`\`\`powershell Set-LocalUser -Name \\"사용자이름\\" -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText \\"새비밀번호\\" -Force) \`\`\` '사용자이름'을 원하는 사용자 이름으로, '새비밀번호'를 원하는 비밀번호로 대체하세요. 원격 접속 상황에 따라 이러한 방법들이 적용되지 않을 수 있으니, 해당 환경과 권한에 따라 올바른 방법을 선택하여 사용하시기 바랍니다. 또한, 보안을 위해 사용자의 동의를 얻거나 적절한 권한을 가진 계정으로 작업을 수행하는 것이 중요합니다."},{"instruction":"주피터에서 시프트m누르면 명령이 합체되자나 이걸 다시 분리시킬수는 없어?","output":"Jupyter Notebook에서 여러 셀을 합치는 것은 Shift + M을 사용하여 수행할 수 있지만, 한 번 합쳐진 셀을 다시 분리하는 기본 단축키는 제공하지 않습니다. 그러나 셀을 수동으로 분리하는 방법은 있습니다. 셀을 분리하려면 다음 단계를 따르세요: 1. 합쳐진 셀을 클릭하여 선택합니다. 2. 분리하고 싶은 위치로 커서를 이동합니다. 3.

Aunque no necesariamente indique una afección severa, puede ser molesta e interferir con tu bienestar diario. Antes de tomar cualquier medida, es importante considerar si hay otros síntomas asociados o si ha habido algún cambio en tu vida que podría explicar la picazón, como nuevos productos de lavandería, jabones, alimentos, medicamentos o exposición a sustancias irritantes. Si la picazón es leve a moderada y no tienes otros síntomas preocupantes, aquí hay algunas estrategias que puedes probar: 1. Hidratación: Usa una crema hidratante sin fragancia varias veces al día, especialmente después de bañarte, para mantener la piel hidratada. 2. Evita irritantes: Reduce el uso de jabones, detergentes y suavizantes de ropa que contengan fragancias y otros químicos que puedan irritar la piel. 3. Baño y duchas: Toma baños o duchas con agua tibia en lugar de caliente, ya que el agua caliente puede secar la piel y empeorar la picazón. 4. Ropa: Elige ropa suave y holgada hecha de telas naturales como el algodón, ya que los tejidos sintéticos pueden irritar la piel. 5. No rascar: Evita rascarte, ya que esto puede dañar la piel y aumentar el riesgo de infección. 6. Antihistamínicos: En algunos casos, un antihistamínico de venta libre puede ayudar a reducir la picazón. 7. Ambiente: Mantén un ambiente con humedad adecuada en tu hogar con el uso de un humidificador si es necesario. 8. Dieta: Considera si algún alimento podría estar causando la picazón y habla con tu médico o un dietista para identificar posibles alergias o intolerancias alimentarias. Si la picazón es intensa, persiste por más de un par de semanas, o si desarrollas otros síntomas, como enrojecimiento, hinchazón, drenaje o si la piel se ve o se siente diferente de lo habitual, debes consultar a un médico. Dependiendo de la evaluación clínica, el médico puede realizar pruebas para determinar la causa de la picazón y recomendar el tratamiento adecuado. Esto puede incluir exámenes de sangre, pruebas de alergia o una biopsia de la piel si es necesario. En caso de que la picazón se deba a una condición subyacente como enfermedad renal, enfermedad hepática, anemia por deficiencia de hierro, trastornos de la tiroides o diabetes, el tratamiento se enfocará en la causa subyacente más que en la picazón misma.

Algunas posibles explicaciones para este tipo de prurito incluyen: 1. **Urticaria colinérgica**: Una forma de urticaria física que se desencadena con el sudor o el aumento de la temperatura corporal. A menudo no presenta ronchas visibles y puede ser provocada por el ejercicio, duchas calientes, emoción o estrés. 2. **Hipereactividad simpática**: A veces, la respuesta de tu cuerpo al estrés o a las emociones puede causar un aumento en la liberación de neurotransmisores que pueden causar picazón. 3. **Disfunción de las glándulas sudoríparas**: La picazón puede deberse a la obstrucción o irritación de las glándulas sudoríparas cuando el cuerpo comienza a sudar. 4. **Psicogénica**: En algunos casos, la picazón puede ser de origen psicológico y relacionada con el estrés emocional. 5. **Fibras nerviosas sensitivas**: Si hay una disfunción en las fibras nerviosas que se activan con el cambio de temperatura, esto podría causar la sensación de picazón. 6. **Alergias**: Puede ser que desarrolles picazón en respuesta a ciertos alérgenos liberados en situaciones de calor o ejercicio, a pesar de no presentar ronchas. Debido a la naturaleza persistente y la peculiaridad de tus síntomas, te recomiendo consultar a un médico, preferiblemente un dermatólogo o un alergólogo. Pueden realizar pruebas específicas, como pruebas de alergia, pruebas para urticaria colinérgica o pruebas para la función de las glándulas sudoríparas, para llegar a un diagnóstico más preciso. Mientras tanto, las siguientes medidas podrían ayudar a reducir la picazón: - Evitar situaciones que aumenten la temperatura corporal, como baños o duchas calientes, ambientes demasiado calientes y ejercicio intenso, en la medida de lo posible. - Utilizar ropa de materiales naturales y transpirables. - Mantenerse bien hidratado para regular la temperatura corporal. - Aplicar toallitas frías o compresas en la piel para aliviar la picazón. - Considerar prácticas de relajación y reducción del estrés, como la meditación, el yoga o técnicas de respiración profunda, que podrían ayudar a disminuir los episodios de picazón si tienen un componente psicogénico o están relacionados con la ansiedad.

Note that \\"roles\\" or \\"papéis\\" refers to roles as in a game or play setting, aligning with how \\"roles\\" might be understood in the context of activities involving designated positions or responsibilities, such as games that have specific character roles or functions."},{"instruction":"Translate the following quote into Latino Spanish, Iberic Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese: “Use X or Y on the Supporter or Detective and win the match”.

Let's translate the provided phrase, substituting X and Y as variables to be replaced by specific terms or abilities related to the game: Latin American Spanish: \\"Utiliza X o Y en el Apoyo o el Detective y gana el partido.\\" In Latin American Spanish, \\"utiliza\\" is the informal imperative form of \\"utilizar.\\" Should a more formal instruction be required, one would use \\"Utilice\\". Iberian Spanish (Spain): \\"Usa X o Y en el Apoyo o el Detective y gana el partido.\\" \\"Usa\\" is the informal imperative form (tú) in Spain for the verb \\"usar,\\" which is also commonly used for \\"to use\\" and is considered more informal than \\"utilizar.\\" If the formal (usted) or plural (vosotros) was needed, it would be \\"Use\\" for \\"usted\\" and \\"Usad\\" for \\"vosotros.\\" Brazilian Portuguese: \\"Use X ou Y no Apoiador ou no Detetive e vença a partida.\\" In Brazilian Portuguese, \\"use\\" is the imperative form of \\"usar,\\" used for both singular and plural (você and vocês) in a formal or general context, and \\"vença\\" is the imperative for \\"vencer.\\" Please note that the titles \\"Supporter\\" and \\"Detective\\" were translated into Spanish as \\"Apoyo\\" and \\"Detective,\\" respectively, and into Portuguese as \\"Apoiador\\" and \\"Detetive.\\" If the game uses specific terms for these roles in a localized version, you might need to use those instead."},{"instruction":"Translate the following quote into Latino Spanish, Iberic Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese: \\"Win 1 Match\\".

Here's how it can be translated: Latin American Spanish: \\"Gana 1 partido.\\" Latin American Spanish typically uses \\"gana,\\" the affirmative informal tú command form of \\"ganar,\\" for instructions or commands in games or apps. Iberian Spanish (Spain): \\"Gana 1 partido.\\" Iberian Spanish would also use \\"gana\\" in an informal context, as if speaking directly to the player using \\"tú.\\" If addressing formally (usted) or using the plural (vosotros), it would be \\"Gane\\" for \\"usted\\" and \\"Ganad\\" for \\"vosotros.\\" Brazilian Portuguese: \\"Vença 1 partida.\\" In Brazilian Portuguese, \\"vença\\" is the singular imperative form of \\"vencer,\\" used for giving commands or instructions. In this particular case, the imperative form of \\"to win\\" does not differ between Iberic and Latino Spanish, as both use \\"gana\\" when addressing a single person informally.

Nevertheless, I'm providing the translations with the understanding that this is a continuation of an existing sentence: Latin American Spanish: \\"hasta su próxima utilización de una acción de Confianza o Sospecha.\\" Iberian Spanish (Spain): \\"hasta su próxima utilización de una acción de Confianza o Sospecha.\\" In both variations of Spanish, \\"hasta su próxima utilización\\" is a formal, neutral way to express the idea that something is to occur up until the next time the action is taken. There is no action command here, so we do not need to use the imperative form (like \\"Utilice\\" or \\"Utilizad\\"). Brazilian Portuguese: \\"até seu próximo uso de uma ação de Confiança ou Suspeita.\\" In these translations, I've assumed that \\"Trust\\" and \\"Suspicion\\" are nouns representing the names of specific actions within the game context, translated into Spanish as \\"Confianza\\" and \\"Sospecha,\\" and into Portuguese as \\"Confiança\\" and \\"Suspeita,\\" respectively."},{"instruction":"Translate the following quote into Latino Spanish, Iberic Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese: \\"This change remains until after using a Trust or Suspicion action.\\" Also respect all differences in conjugations between Iberic Spanish and Latino Spanish, such as “Utilice” being used in Latino Spanish and “Utilizad” being used in Iberic Spanish","output":"The sentence you've provided suggests a rule or a condition that lasts until a specific type of action is taken. Here's the translation into the respective languages: Latin American Spanish: \\"Este cambio permanece hasta después de usar una acción de Confianza o Sospecha.\\" Iberian Spanish (Spain): \\"Este cambio permanece hasta después de utilizar una acción de Confianza o Sospecha.\\" In both variations of Spanish, \\"permanece\\" indicates a continuous state and \\"usar/utilizar\\" is the infinitive form of the verb indicating the action that will end this state. Brazilian Portuguese: \\"Esta alteração permanece até depois de usar uma ação de Confiança ou Suspeita.\\" Note: \\"using\\" is translated as \\"usar\\" in the infinitive in Portuguese because it describes an action that will take place in the future, which terminates the previous condition (\\"this change remains\\"). While conjugation differences can be important, the sentence’s structure does not necessitate using different conjugations such as \\"Utilice\\" in Latin American Spanish or \\"Utilizad\\" in Iberian Spanish; these differences are more relevant when giving commands or instructions, and this sentence is descriptive rather than imperative."},{"instruction":"Как выгрузить из Revit nwc, если на 3D виде находится ifc","output":"Чтобы выгрузить из Revit файл в формате \`.nwc\`, который предназначен для программного обеспечения Autodesk Navisworks, следуйте этим шагам: 1.

На момент моего последнего обновления знаний, в Planyway не предусмотрена нативная функция для архивирования карточек напрямую через их календарь или планировщик задач. Архивация обычно делается через Trello. Если вы используете Trello в комбинации с Planyway, вот как вы можете архивировать несколько карточек: 1. Откройте доску Trello, в которой вы хотите архивировать карточки. 2. Чтобы выбрать несколько карточек, используйте следующие действия (могут потребоваться расширения браузера для множественного выбора): - Нажмите и удерживайте клавишу Shift, затем кликните по карточкам, которые хотите выбрать; - Используйте множественное выделение через интерфейс Trello, если оно доступно; - Использовать функцию \\"Множественный выбор\\" (Multi-select), если она доступна через плагины или сторонние инструменты. 3. После выбора нужных карточек, выберите действие \\"Архивировать карточки\\" в Trello (обычно доступно через меню действий с выбранными карточками). 4. Подтвердите архивацию, и выбранные карточки будут перемещены в архив доски Trello. Обратите внимание, что фактические действия могут отличаться в зависимости от того, какие обновления были внесены в Trello или Planyway после моего последнего обновления знаний. Также возможно, что для расширенных функций могут понадобиться дополнительные плагины или расширения к Trello.

По законодательству РФ, чтобы получить налоговый вычет за вклады в ИИС, нужно подать соответствующее заявление в налоговую службу не позже 30 апреля года, следующего за годом, в котором были сделаны взносы. Вычет можно получить после предоставления документов, подтверждающих совершение взносов на ИИС.

result 00:17:18.400 the resuscitation of the middle class 00:17:21.520 and a far more equitable society 00:17:25.280 thank you","output":"It's easy to imagine a world without labor unions we're essentially living in that world now and we are worse off as a result. Few of you probably belong to unions, but almost all of you benefit from them. Unions are what brought us the weekend; more importantly, unions built the middle class by ensuring that workers had the incomes to support families, to buy homes and cars, and to dream that their children could do better than they could. It was union power and advocacy that helped us win social security and health insurance upon which almost all of us depend. In the 1950s, a third of private sector workers belonged to unions. Big labor stood proudly beside big business and big government. No more. Today, only six percent of private sector workers are members of unions. With their decline in numbers came a decline in political and economic power, and the result: a significant increase in inequality, a significant deterioration in the possibility of a middle-class lifestyle for this generation or the next, and a receding chance to own a home or afford retirement. We need unions to regain the power so that we can regain what we have lost, build a better future, and help forge democracies that are built on a decent social contract between citizens and government, and among citizens themselves. Yes, we need unions today as much as ever. As a professor of political science and someone who has studied labor unions for a long time, I can tell you that one of the most important things that unions do is to counterbalance the power of corporations. They even the playing field. Let's picture the world before unions: small children toiling all day and even into the night in noisy, polluted factories, or immigrant women workers jumping from a burning sweatshop because the fire escapes were locked so that they could not take breaks. That was New York City in 1911. That's Bangladesh now. But unions changed that by winning protections for workers. They transform lives. They enabled even the worst off to achieve the American dream. Consider the longshore workers – those who load and unload ships. In the 1930s they were destitute, homeless men who lived on the beach. They were 'wharf rats'. In the morning, the boss came and yelled; all along the shore – thus the name longshore – they pleaded for the scarce jobs, just as migrant day laborers do today at places like Lowe's and Home Depot. It was humiliating, degrading. But when the unions won the right to organize and won contracts, the 'wharf rats' became 'lords of the dock'. They became middle class. They could marry, they could support families, they could send their children to college, they had health insurance and benefits, they had dignity, respect; they were full American citizens. Unions enabled others to attain the American dream by raising wages generally and by reducing wage disparities between men and women and among the races. My research has shown me that with every transformation in the economy – the technology, the way we work – there has been an evolution in the labor movement. Craft unions, think construction work or even beer making, emerged from medieval guilds. With the rise of industry – auto, steel – new forms of organization emerged. When white-collar workers in offices, in government, in healthcare, and professions began to want voice and representation, yet another kind of union developed. In my mind, in my ears is Dolly Parton singing 9 to 5, inspired by a real-life union of that name. When you hear that song, thank the unions for a decent working day. History shows that unions helped people get dignity, rise out of poverty, inhibit workplace dangers and harassment, and improve health and well-being of us all. These are not yesterday's problems. Workers of today still need and want unions. An MIT survey in 2021 revealed that 50% of the non-union workforce would join a union if given a chance. So Margaret, if unions are so great, why are they in such serious decline? Because the odds are stacked against them. Many of you have read about the Amazon warehouse workers who failed to win a union representation election in Alabama. They failed because of concerted employer opposition. Indeed, there are many employers and politicians who are preventing the reform of labor laws passed nearly a century ago in another era and another economy. These are laws that inhibit agriculture and domestic workers from organizing, largely black and brown workers. They make it hard for workers in the gig economy to organize those we call forth with our apps – ride share, delivery service, specialized tasks. There are employers and politicians who are pushing states to pass 'right-to-work' laws – laws that abolish the requirement that those who are covered by union contracts have to pay union dues. This effectively kills the unions. Now, many workers in 27 states do not have to pay for the benefits the unions provide for them – states that include Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin – former union strongholds. And society loses big. A recent study revealed that in right-to-work law states, there is slower economic growth, higher consumer debt, lower wages, worse health outcomes, and lower civic participation than in states without such laws on the books. But it's not just employers and politicians that are holding unions back. Unions are the cause of some of their own problems. Some unions are extremely bureaucratic, stifling debate and innovation. Some union leaders are corrupt, rigging elections, paying themselves humongous salaries, even when they represent very low income workers, and some commit felonies. Jimmy Hoffa is the notorious example of a labor leader who went to prison, but just this year, several high-ranking officials in the United Auto Workers were sentenced for embezzlement. Now many critics, possibly some of you, blame unions for inflation. When wages go up, consumer prices go up – true enough. But so does the standard of living for workers. If we paid one to two cents more per apple, apple pickers and packers would have decent wages, decent housing, and some protection from pesticides. And we, as taxpayers, benefit from higher standards of living by workers. The pandemic gave us the term 'essential workers'. If those in grocery warehousing, food processing, delivery, had strong unions, indeed any unions at all, there would have been no need for federal programs for those who have jobs to feed their families and prevent evictions. Now there are many reasons for union decline, including structural ones – the decline in union jobs and manufacturing. But a major reason is a public lack of awareness, even misinformation about the value of unions. Well before President Reagan fired the striking air controllers in 1981, there has been concerted and continuous opposition by employers and politicians to undermine unions. Employers no longer suppress unions by hiring private armies, like U.S. Steel, Ford, and coal companies did. Now they hire very high-priced consulting firms to do that work. Elected officials may no longer call out the police and the National Guard to cart labor organizers off to jail; now they pass legislation that restricts union organizing and power. But workers are beginning to fight back, as the headlines reveal. They are building solidarity across racial, ethnic, religious, partisan divides. Martin Luther King exhorted us to 'enwrap ourselves in a single garment of destiny'. I have observed several unions that I've studied build expansive and inclusive communities of fate in which large numbers of others recognize that their destinies are entwined, despite differences and distances. This doesn't always happen, but it can, and it must. If you took my class, or gave me another hour, I could give you numerous examples. We need, as employees and citizens, to build solidarity through communities of faith that cross geographies and differences. But to do that, we need to reimagine labor unions for now. The labor movement must evolve as it has in the past, even producing possibly alt-unions – alternatives to unions, alternatives to traditional unions. Workers in gig professions, tech, don't necessarily want a traditional union, but they do want influence over their wages, working conditions, and even the policies of their companies. And they are reimagining old approaches and coming up with new ones in order to build worker voice and power. Some are reconfiguring worker cooperatives, employee-owned businesses in which the workers determine wages, working conditions, and distribution of profits. This is not a pipe dream. Mondragon in Spain has over 80,000 employee owners, takes in over 13 billion dollars a year, and redistributes its profits to build worker skills and capacities among its member cooperatives. A newer approach is to use platform technologies to teach workers their rights. In our global, hyper-connected, and socially isolating world, platforms such as Coworker.org or Unit recognize and address the fact that there is a mobile workforce that no longer has water coolers or lunchrooms around which to gather and strategize. These platforms provide workers with a way to share experiences, access organizing resources, and build networks at scale across geographies and employers. Coworker.org had a huge win with Alphabet, the parent company of Google – a giant among tech firms. Alphabet workers recognize that they are part of a community of fate that crosses large distances. They have been protesting Google's contracts with the Pentagon and with immigration authorities. They have normal run-of-the-mill economic union demands, but they also have the political demand that they should have a say over company policies that affect them and us. Whatever you thought of unions in the past, I hope that these examples have revealed to you what they can be today and for tomorrow. Unions once significantly reduced income inequality – the gap between the rich and the poor. They can again. These graph lines came together when unions rose. I'd like to see those lines permanently converge and inequality reduced once and for all. Billionaires are building rockets to explore outer space; this is so exciting. But equally exciting is the workers who are providing the goods and services on which those billionaires, we all depend, exploring new ways to gain power and voice. If even some of these explorations succeed, workers will gain dignity, economic security, and the power to challenge employers and politicians. The result: the resuscitation of the middle class and a far more equitable society.

It is meant to illustrate your understanding of the material and how it affects your ideas and possible practices in the future. What exactly is a reflection paper? It’s really just a personal reflection on a specific topic, usually a lecture, film, book, or idea. Though a reflection paper is a type of academic essay, it’s much less formal than others essays you write. It’s a chance to take on a more casual tone, adopt the first-person writing style and give your opinion on the chosen topic. It is not a summary of the movie. Simply put, a reflection paper is your opinion on what you think about the chosen topic. That doesn’t mean you can wing it though. Despite the fact that you base a reflection paper on your personal opinion, you must take care to back up this opinion with evidence. The most effective reflection papers focus on your opinion but still mention some type of experience, belief or opinion to back up what you believe. Know that your reflection paper doesn’t need to explore the topic from all angles. It’s not an unbiased piece, so counterpoints aren’t necessary. Remember, that the idea of a reflection paper is to present your own opinions, so keep this in mind while brainstorming. Your opinion is the most important aspect of this assignment. So spend plenty of time reflecting on your thoughts on the topic before beginning to write. With your written document you may include: • Your beliefs, opinions and experiences • Discuss the similarities and differences to your own life • Analyze how real or believable a subject is • Allows you to sympathize or show empathy with characters","output":"Upon reflecting on the passionate discourse regarding the decline of labor unions and their profound impact on society, my thoughts gravitate toward a bittersweet acknowledgement of the past glories and the current challenges that unions face. The imagery of the eroded middle class and the erosion of workers' rights in the modern era incites a response not just of intellectual understanding, but of emotional resonance as well. Having grown up in a family where the concept of unionized labor was often revered as the backbone of the working class's fortitude, I have seen firsthand the benefits that union advocacy has provided—from fair wages and reasonable working hours to health benefits and job security. The sense that these benefits are dwindling, juxtaposed with the rise of wealth inequality and exploitation of gig economy workers, stirs within me a desire for change. It serves as a wake-up call to society's collective conscience, highlighting how the integral fabric of worker's rights is wearing thin under the stress of corporate power and political maneuvers aimed at undermining collective bargaining. In my estimation, unions represent more than just the mechanism for economic balance; they echo a fundamental principle of democracy: the power of collective voice and action. The description of the 'wharf rats' who transformed into 'lords of the dock' delineates more than an economic ascent. It encapsulates a narrative of human dignity—of seeing the underdog rise through unity and solidarity. This transformation, once widespread, now seems like a dream fading into the annals of history as union membership declines and workers find themselves increasingly isolated in a digital and gig economy. My own work experiences have brought me into contact with both unionized and non-unionized environments. The difference in worker morale, engagement, and advocacy was startlingly clear. Where unions were present, there was a palpable sense of community and shared purpose; absent unions, individuals often seemed adrift on an ocean of employer whims and market pressures. The real-life implications of declining union power are hence not an abstract economic debate for me but a daily reality for countless workers. What strikes me as a beacon of hope is the potential for a re-envisioned labor movement that taps into 21st-century technologies and social networks, creating \\"communities of fate\\" as the speech suggests. This idea aligns with my belief in the potential of technology to democratize power structures. Platforms like Coworker.org could indeed be the water coolers of the digital age, providing dispersed workers with the digital space to organize, share experiences, and negotiate. They prompt me to consider the role I could play in such movements, perhaps by leveraging my understanding of digital communication to advocate for worker rights and facilitate organization. My reflection on this topic reaffirms my conviction that unions, while challenged by modern economies and often their own inertia, are worth reinventing and supporting. Their potential to provide workers with a voice and ensure fair treatment in the job market is not only about preserving the past but also about carving a path toward a future where economic disparity does not continue to grow unchecked. If we are to navigate the complexities of the modern economy effectively, we must consider that it's not only who holds wealth that matters but how they came to hold it and at what human cost. As I contemplate my future actions and alignment with these ideas, I am poised to balance my career aspirations with a steadfast commitment to advocating for equitable labor practices. Whether through supporting unionizing efforts or engaging in political discourse around labor laws, I now see a clear moral imperative to integrate these ideals into my professional and civic life. The reflection on labor unions thus coalesces into a personal mission: to contribute to a society where the labor force is no longer merely the means to an economic end but recognized and revered as the heart of human industry and dignity."},{"instruction":"can you write a conclusion for this essay: While reflecting on the Ted Talk by Margaret Levi regarding the decline of labor unions and their impact on American society, my thoughts are immediately drawn toward a sort of bittersweet acknowledgement of the past success of Unions coupled with their now dwindling status. Levi’s imagery of the “eroded” middle-class and the diminishment of workers’ rights nowadays explains a concept not only intellectually but draws into an emotional response as well. Throughout my life I have seen the benefits that unions have provided such as fairer wages and reasonable working hours, as well as health benefits and job security. The fact that unions have been dwindling seems like a huge problem not only to the workers who would be in unions, but also the stability and strength of the middle class. Without unions the workforce and middle class could crumble under the oppression of mega-corporations as the divide between middle and low class becomes more similar while being pushed further away from the upper class. A strong middle class is necessary in keeping a stable and equitable country, but because of the diminishing union reliance it has become weaker over the years. From what I observed both during the video and throughout my life, unions represent more than just a tool for economic balance. Unions represent an important principle of democracy, the ability for workers to come together and have a voice in working conditions, pay, hours, etc. Levi explains in the video that the ‘wharf rats’ transformed into ‘lords of the dock’. This idea that workers could finally rise and get the support they should goes above just a financial gain. Joining a Union and having the power to finally have a voice and a say in what happens changes everything for workers drastically. This transformation, once widespread, has changed significantly throughout the years as union membership declines and workers find themselves increasingly isolated in the modern “gig” economy. However, as Levi brought up in the video there could be potential for a new labor movement that works with modern-day technology and social networks. Personally, I believe the use of technology would be an influential method to bring democracy and could allow for better organization as a group. Platforms like Coworker.org as mentioned by Levi, could provide dispersed workers with the digital space to organize, share working experiences, and negotiate. These ideas could demonstrate the importance of understanding digital communication to better advocate for worker rights and assist organization. Throughout the process of my reflection of Levi’s speech, I have come to believe that unions, despite being constantly challenged by modern economics, are worth reinventing and supporting for modern times. Unions’ potential to provide workers with a voice and ensure fair treatment in the job market is not only about bringing back how the unions were in the past but also about creating a successful country for a future without severe economic disparity. To maintain this balance, it is necessary to implement measures and defend unions so that the top one percent does not unfairly take advantage and push our country into even further division.","output":"In conclusion, Margaret Levi's poignant Ted Talk has underscored the critical role labor unions have historically played in the flourishing of American society and the stability of its workforce. My reflection on her message has only solidified my conviction that the decline of unions signals not just a loss for the collective workforce but for democracy and economic equity as a whole. The imagery Levi conjured – of the 'wharf rats' rising to 'lords of the dock' – is a powerful testament to the transformative potential of unions, a potential we must strive to recapture and adapt to the realities of the modern world. Unions, in essence, are indeed the embodiment of democratic principles at work, ensuring that the American dream doesn't fall prey to unchecked corporate interests. They are a necessary counterbalance to preserve the dignity and fair treatment of workers, serving as a bulwark against the erosion of the middle class and the deepening chasm of income inequality. The rise of technology and digital platforms presents a unique opportunity to revitalize and refashion union advocacy, ensuring that it aligns with contemporary modes of work and worker organization. Embracing these tools to renew and embolden worker solidarity is not simply looking backward with nostalgia but instead harnessing history to illuminate a path forward. Bitterness over what may seem like unionized labor's past defeats must give way to a renewed commitment to innovation within the labor movement. As we face the challenges of the gig economy and the stark realities of economic disparity, it is paramount that we champion the rebirth of unions—reimagined, reinvigorated, and reflective of our shared democratic ideals—so that we can architect a society that reveres and respects its labor force, and through this respect, nurtures the soul of its national character."},{"instruction":"import com.google.gson.Gson; import com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.lang.reflect.Type; import java.util.List; import java.util.ArrayList; public class HOTELIERServer { private List<Hotel> hotels; public HOTELIERServer(String jsonFilePath) { loadHotelsFromJson(jsonFilePath); } private void loadHotelsFromJson(String jsonFilePath) { Gson gson = new Gson(); try (FileReader reader = new FileReader(jsonFilePath)) { // Defining the type of the data we want to read Type hotelListType = new TypeToken<ArrayList<Hotel>>(){}.getType(); // Deserializing hotels = gson.fromJson(reader, hotelListType); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } // Add other functionality as needed for the HOTELIERServer public static void main(String[] args) { String jsonFilePath = \\"Hotels.json\\"; // Replace with the actual path to the JSON file HOTELIERServer server = new HOTELIERServer(jsonFilePath); // You can use the instance server to interact with the list of hotels loaded from the JSON file // Example: Print all hotel names for (Hotel hotel : server.hotels) { System.out.println(hotel.name); } } } perchè mi da questo errore java.io.FileNotFoundException: Hotels.json (Impossibile trovare il file specificato) at java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.open0(Native Method) at java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.open(FileInputStream.java:213) at java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:152) at java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:106) at java.base/java.io.FileReader.<init>(FileReader.java:60) at esame/esame.HOTELIERServer.loadHotelsFromJson(HOTELIERServer.java:22) at esame/esame.HOTELIERServer.<init>(HOTELIERServer.java:17) at esame/esame.HOTELIERServer.main(HOTELIERServer.java:36) Exception in thread \\"main\\" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \\"java.util.List.iterator()\\" because \\"server.hotels\\" is null","output":"L'errore \`java.io.FileNotFoundException: Hotels.json (Impossibile trovare il file specificato)\` indica che il programma sta cercando di aprire un file chiamato \`Hotels.json\`, ma non riesce a trovarlo nel percorso specificato.

Ecco una guida passo passo: 1. **Scarica il File JAR:** - Trova il file JAR che vuoi scaricare. Può essere da un repository Maven o un sito web che fornisce librerie Java. - Scarica il JAR e salvalo in una directory del tuo progetto o in una cartella libreria dedicata all'interno del tuo progetto. 2. **Apri il Progetto in VS Code:** - Assicurati di avere l'estensione di VS Code per Java installata, come \\"Extension Pack for Java\\" che include tutte le estensioni necessarie per lo sviluppo in Java. - Apri il tuo progetto con Visual Studio Code. 3. **Configura il Classpath:** - Apri la cartella \`.vscode\` nella root del tuo progetto (se non esiste già, creala). - All'interno della cartella \`.vscode\`, crea o modifica il file \`settings.json\`. - Aggiungi o modifica la chiave \`java.project.referencedLibraries\` con un array che contiene il percorso al file JAR che hai scaricato. Ad esempio: \`\`\`json { \\"java.project.referencedLibraries\\": [ \\"path/to/your/library.jar\\", \\"lib/**/*.jar\\" ] } \`\`\` - Se hai intenzione di aggiungere più librerie in futuro, puoi usare il pattern \`lib/**/*.jar\` per includere automaticamente tutti i JAR nella cartella \`lib\`. 4. **Ricarica il Progetto:** - Dopo aver salvato il file \`settings.json\`, potrebbe essere necessario ricaricare il progetto o aspettare che VS Code si aggiorni automaticamente per rilevare le nuove librerie. 5. **Verifica che tutto funzioni:** - Apri una classe Java del tuo progetto e prova a scrivere del codice che utilizza la libreria JAR che hai appena collegato. - Visual Studio Code dovrebbe fornire l'autocompletamento per le classi e i metodi contenuti nel JAR. - Prova a costruire il tuo progetto e assicurati che non ci siano problemi di compilazione relativi alle nuove librerie. Ricorda che VS Code è un editor di codice leggero strettamente legato ai file e alla struttura delle cartelle, e quindi l'organizzazione del tuo progetto è fondamentale per il corretto funzionamento delle librerie di terze parti. Se utilizzi un sistema di build come Maven o Gradle, è anche possibile definire le dipendenze direttamente nel \`pom.xml\` o \`build.gradle\`, e queste saranno automaticamente prese in considerazione da VS Code senza dover modificare manualmente il file \`settings.json\`."},{"instruction":"HOTELIERServer.java:1: error: package com.google.gson does not exist import com.google.gson.Gson; ^ HOTELIERServer.java:2: error: package com.google.gson.reflect does not exist import com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken; ^ HOTELIERServer.java:19: error: cannot find symbol Gson gson = new Gson(); ^ symbol: class Gson location: class HOTELIERServer HOTELIERServer.java:19: error: cannot find symbol Gson gson = new Gson(); ^ symbol: class Gson location: class HOTELIERServer HOTELIERServer.java:22: error: cannot find symbol Type hotelListType = new TypeToken<ArrayList<Hotel>>(){}.getType(); ^ symbol: class TypeToken location: class HOTELIERServer 5 errors Mi dà comunque questo errore","output":"L'errore che hai postato indica che il compilatore Java non riesce a trovare la libreria Gson (Google JSON) che stai cercando di usare nel tuo codice. Questo succede perché il percorso al JAR di Gson non è stato aggiunto al classpath del tuo progetto. Per risolvere questi errori, devi scaricare il JAR di Gson e assicurarti che sia disponibile nel classpath quando compili il codice. Ecco i passi da seguire: 1. **Scarica il JAR di Gson:** Puoi scaricare l'ultima versione del JAR di Gson dalla sua pagina GitHub ufficiale (https://github.com/google/gson) o da Maven Central (https://search.maven.org/). Salva il JAR in una cartella del tuo progetto, come ad esempio \`/lib\`. 2. **Aggiungi il JAR al Classpath:** Se non utilizzi un sistema di build come Maven o Gradle, devi aggiungere manualmente il JAR al classpath. - In Visual Studio Code, segui le istruzioni fornite nella mia risposta precedente per configurare \`java.project.referencedLibraries\` nel file \`settings.json\`. In alternativa, se stai compilando il codice da terminale, puoi usare l'opzione \`-cp\` o \`-classpath\` con \`javac\`: \`\`\`sh javac -cp \\".:path/to/lib/gson-2.8.6.jar\\" HOTELIERServer.java \`\`\` Nota che in sistemi Unix (come Linux e macOS), il delimitatore nel classpath è \`:\`, mentre in Windows è \`;\`. L'esempio sopra è per sistemi Unix. In Windows sarebbe: \`\`\`cmd javac -cp \\".;pathtolibgson-2.8.6.jar\\" HOTELIERServer.java \`\`\` 3. **Compila e Esegui il Progetto:** Dopo aver aggiunto il JAR al classpath, compila il tuo progetto con \`javac\` e dovresti vedere che gli errori scompaiono. Non dimenticare di aggiungere il JAR al classpath anche quando esegui il programma usando \`java\`. Ad esempio: \`\`\`sh java -cp \\".:path/to/lib/gson-2.8.6.jar\\" HOTELIERServer \`\`\` Se stai usando un sistema di build come Maven o Gradle, aggiungi la dipendenza Gson al tuo \`pom.xml\` o \`build.gradle\` e lascia che lo strumento gestisca il classpath per te. Ricapitolando, è fondamentale che il JAR di Gson sia specificato nel tuo classpath quando compili ed esegui il tuo programma Java perché le classi Gson possano essere trovate dal compilatore e dal runtime."},{"instruction":"اقترح لي مواضيع ثقافية منوعة وتكون شيقة لاستخدامها لانتاج مقاطع فيديو على اليوتيوب وتحقق مشاهدات عالية في المملكة العربية السعودية","output":"إليك بعض المواضيع الثقافية المنوعة والشيقة التي من الممكن أن تجذب الجمهور في المملكة العربية السعودية وتحقق مشاهدات عالية على يوتيوب: 1. التراث السعودي: استعرض الأزياء التقليدية، الأطعمة، الرقصات، والمهرجانات الثقافية. يمكنك أيضًا التحدث عن القصص والأساطير التاريخية السعودية. 2. السياحة في السعودية: أبرز وجهات السياحة الرائعة داخل المملكة مثل العلا، الباحة، جدة البلد، وأهم المعالم التاريخية والطبيعية. 3. الفنون السعودية الحديثة: تغطية السينما السعودية، الفنانين التشكيليين، الموسيقيين، ومناقشة كيف يتطور الفن في السعودية. 4. تغيرات الحياة الاجتماعية: تناول التغيرات في نمط الحياة الاجتماعية، مثل الحياة عند الشباب، التجارة الإلكترونية، والتواصل الاجتماعي في عصر الإنترنت. 5. رواد الأعمال والابتكار: قصص نجاح لشخصيات سعودية ناجحة في مجالات الأعمال، التقنية، والابتكار. 6. الثقافة الشعبية والميديا: تحليلات ونقاشات حول أبرز الأحداث الثقافية والفنية، مثل أفلام سعودية أو عربية رائجة، برامج تلفزيونية، ومسلسلات. 7. الفلك وعلوم الفضاء: حلقات تعريفية وتثقيفية عن الفلك وأخبار علم الفضاء، مع التركيز على اسهامات السعودية في هذا المجال. 8. تاريخ الدولة وملوك السعودية: سرد معلومات تاريخية وبيوغرافية حول الملوك السعوديين والتطورات السياسية والاجتماعية عبر العصور. 9. العلوم والتكنولوجيا: تقديم محتوى تعليمي حول أحدث الاختراعات والابتكارات في عالم العلوم والتكنولوجيا، مع تسليط الضوء على مشاريع تكنولوجية سعودية. 10. الاستدامة والبيئة: التركيز على مشاريع الطاقة المتجددة، الحفاظ على البيئة، واستكشاف جهود السعودية في مجال الاستدامة ورؤية 2030. لجذب مشاهدين أكثر عليك بتوفير محتوى مرئي جذاب ومصمم بشكل احترافي، مع استخدام الوسائل البصرية كالرسوم البيانية والصور والفيديوهات ذات الجودة العالية. كما قد تحتاج إلى المشاركة الفعالة في تعليقات الفيديو للتفاعل مع المشاهدين والرد على استفساراتهم وتشجيعهم على المشاركة."},{"instruction":"أريد شي أكثر تفصيل ويجذب الشباب وبعيد عن المواضيع الجدية","output":"فيما يلي بعض الأفكار لمواضيع فيديو ترفيهية وخفيفة يمكن أن تجتذب الشباب في المملكة العربية السعودية: 1. تحديات ومسابقات شبابية: -

Here are some typical features and characteristics you might find in a 1984 model year car: 1. Bodystyles: A variety of body styles including sedans, coupes, hatchbacks, station wagons, and convertibles were common. The SUV segment was not as extensive as today, but there were a few offerings. 2. Carburetors: Although fuel injection technology was starting to become more prevalent, especially in higher-end and performance-oriented vehicles, many cars still used carburetors for fuel delivery. 3. Engines: Engine sizes ranged broadly, from small four-cylinder engines to large V8s, with six-cylinder engines also commonly available. Due to emissions regulations, many of the larger engines were detuned compared to their earlier counterparts from the 60s and 70s. 4. Emission Controls: Stringent emission regulations led to the widespread use of catalytic converters and other emissions control technology. 5. Design: The styling of 1984 cars often featured boxy, angular shapes with a more aerodynamic focus compared to the designs of the 1970s. 6. Interior and Amenities: Interiors typically had cloth or vinyl seats, with leather being an option on more expensive models. Amenities such as power windows, air conditioning, and cassette players were often available, but not as standard equipment in all models. 7. Transmission: Manual transmissions were still common, but automatic transmissions were gaining in popularity and often had three or four speeds. 8. Safety: Features like seat belts were standard, but airbags were not yet common. Antilock brake systems (ABS) and traction control were not widely available. 9. Suspension and Brakes: Most cars featured power steering and power-assisted brakes. Disc brakes in the front with drum brakes in the rear were common, with some higher-end models offering four-wheel disc brakes. 10. Drivetrain: The majority of cars were rear-wheel drive, though front-wheel drive was becoming more popular due to its space efficiency and performance in inclement weather. All-wheel drive was relatively rare and typically reserved for specialty vehicles. 11. Fuel Economy: Following the oil crises of the 1970s, manufacturers paid more attention to fuel economy. Some cars had a \\"5th gear overdrive\\" or a lock-up torque converter to enhance fuel efficiency on highways. 12. Early Electronics: Some models, especially higher-end cars, began integrating more advanced electronics, such as digital displays, onboard diagnostics, and electronic fuel injection systems. Each car from this era will vary significantly depending on the make, model, and options that were selected when new. Collector and enthusiast models from 1984 may also have features specific to performance or luxury that would not be found in more pedestrian models."},{"instruction":"напиши короткие описания продуктов для подборки видео, основа текст: Спрей для Рук Надежная защита и отличная замена санитайзеру, бактериофаги борются с вредными микроорганизмами, обеспечивая безопасность и чистоту.

Плотность (ρ) определяется как масса (m) деленная на объем (V): ρ = m/V. 1. Сначала найдем объем блока (V). Объем блока прямоугольной формы можно найти по формуле: V = длина × ширина × высота Где длина, ширина и высота даны в сантиметрах. Поэтому: V = 60 см × 40 см × 20 см V = 48000 см³ Однако, измерение объема более удобно выражать в кубических метрах (м³), так как плотность часто выражают в килограммах на кубический метр (кг/м³). Чтобы конвертировать объем из кубических сантиметров в кубические метры, делим объем на 1 000 000 (так как 1 м³ = 1 000 000 см³): V = 48000 см³ / 1000000 = 0.048 м³ 2. Теперь найдем массу блока (m). Вес блока дан в ньютонах (Н), что является единицей силы в системе СИ, но чтобы найти плотность, нам нужна масса. Масса (m) и вес (в данном случае в ньютонах) связаны ускорением свободного падения (g), которое на Земле примерно равно 9.81 м/с²: m = вес (в Н) / g В данном случае: m = 150 Н / 9.81 м/с² m ≈ 15.29031 кг (округлено до пяти знаков после запятой) 3. Теперь, когда у нас есть масса в килограммах и объем в кубических метрах, мы можем найти плотность: ρ = m/V ρ = 15.29031 кг / 0.048 м³ ρ ≈ 318.54875 кг/м³ (округлено до пяти знаков после запятой) Плотность блока составляет примерно 318.55 кг/м³."},{"instruction":"Write only in paragraphs to explain following points: • How useful was the Gantts Chart by providing the advantages and disadvantages and the overall conclusion of them for the Stop Smoking Presentation • How useful was the CPA by providing the advantages and disadvantages and the overall conclusion of them for the Stop Smoking Presentation • Providing the advantages and disadvantages for budgeting and the overall conclusion of them for the Stop Smoking Presentation • Risk assessment by providing the advantages and disadvantages and the overall conclusion of them for the Stop Smoking Presentation • What changes did you make after creating the Gantt chart for the Stop Smoking Presentation? • What changes did you make after creating the CPA for the Stop Smoking Presentation? • What changes did you make after creating the risk assessment for the Stop Smoking Presentation? • What changes did you make after creating the budget for the Stop Smoking Presentation • How feasible is the plan by providing the advantages and disadvantages and the overall conclusion of them for the Stop Smoking Presentation • Are there any other possible risks that need to be considered?

The advantages of using a Gantt chart included its straightforward layout, which facilitated easy tracking of project progress and ensured that each team member understood their responsibilities and deadlines. It promoted enhanced communication and coordination among team members, which was crucial for the event's success. However, the Gantt chart also had a few disadvantages. It was relatively inflexible, making it difficult to reflect real-time changes, and it could become overly complex if the project had too many tasks. This complexity could lead to misunderstandings or omissions of crucial steps. Overall, the Gantt chart was a beneficial tool that contributed to the systematic and organized approach necessary for a successful presentation. Critical Path Analysis (CPA) was another significant tool employed for the Stop Smoking Presentation. Its main advantage lay in pinpointing the essential tasks that needed to be prioritized to meet the project deadlines, thus helping manage time more effectively. This focus on critical tasks reduced the possibility of delays and helped allocate resources more efficiently. Nonetheless, the CPA also had its drawbacks. It required accurate and detailed data to be effective, and the complexity of creating and maintaining it was resource-intensive. In addition, it was not very accommodating of changes once the project was underway. Overall, CPA was a valuable analytical tool that contributed to a better understanding of task dependencies and the time management of the project. In terms of budgeting, the advantages included providing a financial framework that ensured resources were allocated appropriately and expenses were kept under control. A well-planned budget was crucial for cost management and avoided over-expenditure. It also helped in securing funding by presenting a clear financial plan. However, budgeting for the Stop Smoking Presentation came with disadvantages. It required accurate forecasting, which could be difficult, and there were always uncertainties surrounding costs that could lead to budget overruns. In conclusion, while budgeting was challenging, its role in sustaining financial health for the project was undeniable. Conducting a risk assessment was instrumental to identify potential issues that could threaten the success of the Stop Smoking Presentation. The advantages were the proactive management of risks by anticipating them before they arose and planning mitigating strategies. This anticipation improved safety, reduced chances of failure, and increased stakeholder confidence. Conversely, the disadvantages included the possibility of not identifying all risks, as no risk assessment can be entirely comprehensive, and the process could be time-consuming. In conclusion, while there are limitations to risk assessments, their role in preparing for and potentially avoiding project pitfalls was crucial. After creating the Gantt chart, changes included adjusting task durations and reallocating resources to ensure that more pressing tasks had the necessary manpower to meet critical deadlines while keeping the overall project on schedule. Post CPA creation, the primary changes involved focusing on the critical path's tasks, potentially adding more resources, or extending work hours for certain activities to ensure no delays would affect the overall project timeline. Following the risk assessment, changes made to the project plan included implementing mitigation strategies for identified risks, such as booking backup venues and speakers, and preparing contingency plans for unforeseen circumstances like technical issues during the presentation. After creating the budget, adjustments were often necessary to ensure that it remained realistic and feasible. This could involve cutting costs in some areas, seeking additional funding, or prioritizing expenditure to ensure that the most critical aspects of the presentation could be financed. The feasibility of the plan was upheld by clear planning and resource allocation as identified through the use of tools such as Gantt charts and CPA. The advantages included a structured approach and the foresight of potential issues, which led to pre-planning and pre-emption of difficulties. However, the plan's potential disadvantages lay in its rigidity and the risk of underestimating unforeseen challenges. Overall, the structured planning approach lent a high degree of feasibility to the plan for the Stop Smoking Presentation. When considering further risks for the Stop Smoking Presentation, possibilities could include last-minute presenter cancellations, equipment failures, or lower-than-expected attendance. The contingency plan should include measures such as having backup presenters, checking equipment thoroughly beforehand and having spare parts or replacements on hand, and implementing a robust marketing campaign to ensure adequate attendance. The most useful tool was arguably the Gantt chart, primarily due to its visual and straightforward way of illustrating the project schedule. It enhanced team communication about deadlines and responsibilities, which is often crucial for the timely completion of projects. The primary reason for believing in the event's feasibility is the thorough planning process, which took into account time management (as seen in Gantt and CPA), financial planning, risk preparedness, and logistical considerations. The confidence in the project's feasibility comes from the comprehensive approach to planning and the strategies in place to handle challenges that may arise."},{"instruction":"· What resources would you need for the Stop Snoking Presentaion? Why? What are these resources going to be used for? · Is there anything that needs to be done in order to prepare the resources in advance? Does anything needs to be bought, borrowed, checked for quality, etc.","output":"For an effective Stop Smoking Presentation, various resources would be essential to ensure that the event runs smoothly and achieves its intended purpose of encouraging smoking cessation. The resources needed and their uses are diverse, encompassing both material and human components. Firstly, informational resources, including pamphlets, flyers, and research data, would be needed to provide attendees with credible and compelling information about the health hazards of smoking and benefits of quitting. These resources serve the educational component of the presentation and would likely require design, printing, and possibly translation to be accessible to a wider audience. Secondly, technical resources, such as a sound system, microphones, projectors, and computers, are crucial for the audio-visual aspects of the presentation. These would be used to ensure clear communication and display informative slides or videos to the audience. Thirdly, a suitable venue that can accommodate the expected number of participants comfortably and safely is vital. The venue would be the space where the presentation and any supporting activities or discussions take place, contributing to the atmosphere and overall experience of the attendees. Human resources are also imperative, including knowledgeable speakers or health professionals who can provide expert insights and answer questions from attendees. Recruitment of volunteers for registration, coordination, and other logistical tasks is also necessary to ensure the event runs efficiently. For hospitality, provisions like seating, refreshments, and possibly catering would enhance the experience for attendees, encouraging them to stay engaged for the entire duration of the presentation. In terms of promotional resources, advertisement materials such as banners, posters, and digital media content would be used for outreach to increase event attendance. A public relations strategy may involve using social media platforms to generate interest and inform potential participants of the event's details. Additionally, contingency resources, such as first aid kits and backup equipment, should be on hand to deal with any unforeseen incidents that could arise during the event. In preparation for the Stop Smoking Presentation, these resources must be readied in advance. Informational materials will need to be designed, fact-checked, and printed. Technical equipment must be sourced and tested for functionality to avoid technical hitches during the presentation. The venue will need to be booked, inspected for suitability, and possibly arranged or decorated according to the presentation's needs. Speakers and volunteers should be recruited well in advance, with ample time for them to prepare and understand their roles. Hospitality elements like refreshments may need to be ordered or purchased closer to the event to ensure freshness. Promotional materials require design and dissemination prior to the event with enough lead time to maximize their impact on potential attendees. Ensuring the quality and accuracy of all resources is paramount, which might involve proof-reading content, doing sound checks, and rehearsing with speakers. By carefully planning and preparing these resources, the Stop Smoking Presentation will not only deliver its message effectively but also create an environment conducive to learning, engagement, and change."},{"instruction":"Вычислите давление столба керосина высотой 30 см .

Hij was rechtvaardig en onberispelijk, hij had ontzag voor God en meed het kwaad.\\" Zo begint het boek Job waaruit vandaag een uittreksel wordt gelezen. Het is de klacht van een gebroken man die kapotgaat onder het onverdiende lijden dat hij moet verduren. Hij doet zijn beklag bij God en roept hem ter verantwoording. Hoe kunt u dat toelaten? Maar hij krijgt van God geen bevredigend antwoord. In alle landen leven er mensen zoals Job. Waarom moeten ze onschuldig lijden? Op die vraag weet niemand een antwoord. Ook gelovige mensen niet. De schoonmoeder van de paus is ziek. Als ik dit zo zeg, zijn er veel gefronste wenkbrauwen. Nochtans zijn we gewoon Petrus de eerste paus te noemen. De schoonmoeder van Petrus was ziek. Ze had hoge koorts. Jezus ging, na de eredienst in de synagoge van Kafarnaüm, samen met Johannes en Jakobus, naar het huis van Petrus. Velen onder ons herkennen dat. Na de hoogmis met vrienden samen komen voor een gezellige babbel met een kop koffie of een glaasje. Maar Jezus, Johannes en Jakobus hebben pech. Jezus kwam bij Simon en zijn broer aan huis. Ze troffen Simons schoonmoeder met koorts in bed aan. Een opvallende afwezige in het verhaal is de vrouw van Simon. Was ze elders gaan wonen, uit eigen beweging of omdat ze door haar man was verlaten? Of wordt ze door de evangelist niet vernoemd omdat ze geen enkele rol speelde? De vraag mag gesteld worden. Jezus pakte de hand van de zieke vrouw vast en deed haar opstaan. Er staat niet dat hij haar genas. Hij deed haar opstaan. 'Opstaan' is het woord dat Marcus ook gebruikt voor de verrijzenis van Jezus. Het is, denk ik, de enige keer in het evangelie dat we zo’n huiselijk tafereel meemaken. We denken er meestal niet over na dat de apostelen en leerlingen getrouwd waren en een gezin hadden. Toch lezen we de hele tijd over het meer, over hun vissersboten, hun netten, hun visvangst. Ze moesten immers hun gezin onderhouden. Jezus ging niet alleen op weg om het evangelie, het goede nieuws van het nabije koninkrijk van God te brengen, maar ook om het metterdaad waar te maken. Hij had het vermogen om mensen weer te doen opstaan uit alle mogelijke ellende en zonde en bezetenheid, mensen die zich voelden als Job. Vast staat ook dat Jezus begaan was met het lijden van mensen en hen wilde helpen en dat Hij dat deed als mens van die tijd en voor patiënten in die tijd. De rationele vraag wat daar precies gebeurde heeft niet veel zin. Soms kan je uit de beschrijving afleiden dat het om epilepsie gaat of om een huidziekte, maar wat men als genezend beschouwde ontgaat ons meestal. Het evangelie geeft geen antwoord op de vraag waarom mensen moeten lijden. Zo breekt Jezus met de schuldvraag. Toen iemand aan Jezus vroeg wie had gezondigd, de man of zijn ouders, reageerde Jezus bruusk met ‘Niemand’ want niet schuld maar het lijden stond centraal. Iemand die ziek is, is dat niet door zijn schuld of die van zijn ouders. Het gaat om een ongeluk dat hem treft. Onmiddellijk nadat Simons schoonmoeder van de koorts bevrijd was opgestaan, bediende ze haar gasten. Het Griekse woord dat hier staat is afgeleid van diakonia: dienstbaarheid. We kunnen het zo lezen. De vrouw sloot zich aan bij Jezus die van zichzelf gezegd heeft: \\"De Mensenzoon is niet gekomen om gediend te worden maar om te dienen\\" (Marcus 10,45). Voor gelovige lezers van het evangelie is dit een duidelijke vingerwijzing. De zending van Jezus moet voortgezet worden door iedereen die zich christen wil noemen.","output":"In het oude Us woonde eens een deugdzame man genaamd Job. Hij leidde een leven van integriteit, was godvrezend en vermeed slechtheid. Dit verhaal van Job, dat ook vandaag wordt gedeeld, vertelt over de hartverscheurende klachten van iemand die tot op het bot is getroffen door leed dat hem onverdiend treft. Job stelt God ter verantwoording voor dit leed maar krijgt geen duidelijke verklaring als antwoord. Het mysterie van het lijden van onschuldigen blijft onbeantwoord, zelfs onder hen die geloven. Via het verhaal omtrent de zieke schoonmoeder van Petrus - die door velen als de eerste paus wordt beschouwd - wordt dit punt geïllustreerd. Jezus bezocht haar na de synagoge en vond haar lijdend in bed. Wat opvalt, is dat Simons echtgenote in dit verhaal afwezig is, een detail dat vragen oproept over haar rol of aanwezigheid. Jezus pakte de hand van de zieke vrouw vast, waarmee hij haar tot 'opstaan' bewoog. Dit woord 'opstaan' wordt in de context van Marcus ook in verband gebracht met de opstanding van Jezus. Dit is het enige moment in de geschriften waar een huiselijk scenario wordt beschreven. Het benadrukt dat de discipelen en volgelingen ook huiselijke verplichtingen hadden en gezinnen om te onderhouden. Bij het aanschouwen van Jezus, zien we iemand die niet alleen het evangelie verspreidde, maar ook daadwerkelijk mensen uit hun ellende hielp opstaan, vergelijkbaar met wat Job ervoer. Jezus had medeleven met het menselijk leed en trachtte binnen de beperkingen van zijn tijd en met de middelen van die tijd hulp te bieden. Wat precies gebeurde bij genezingen, blijft vaak onduidelijk en de rationele vraag daarnaar wordt niet bevredigend beantwoord binnen de evangelieverhalen. Het evangelie leert ons dat lijden niet altijd verband houdt met persoonlijke zonde of schuld. Jezus verwierp dit idee; toen aan hem werd gevraagd over de zonde die aan ziekte ten grondslag zou liggen, verklaarde Hij stellig dat dit niet zo was. Ziekte is geen straf voor zonde, maar een treffer van het lot. Het verhaal gaat verder dat, na te zijn opgestaan, Simons schoonmoeder haar gasten begon te bedienen. Hier komt het Griekse begrip 'diakonia', dat verwijst naar dienstbaarheid, naar voren. Dit sluit naadloos aan bij de leer van Jezus, die zelf verklaarde dat hij kwam om te dienen, niet om gediend te worden. Voor christenen is dit een expliciete aanwijzing dat de missie van Jezus voortgezet dient te worden door iedereen die zich volgeling van Christus noemt. Het verhaal van Job, het lijden van de schoonmoeder en de acties van Jezus spreken allen tot het hart van het christelijke geloof: in een wereld vol onverklaarbaar leed, worden we opgeroepen tot medeleven, dienstbaarheid en het voortzetten van Jezus’ missie van hoop en genezing."},{"instruction":"Graag een meer uitvoerige homilie hierover van 550 woorden.","output":"In de stoffige annalen van het oude Us was er eens een man genaamd Job, wiens leven ons tot op heden raakt door zijn verhaal van beproeving en geloof. Dit verhaal onthult ons een wezenlijke menselijke strijd: de confrontatie met onverdiende ellende en de zoektocht naar gerechtigheid in het aanzicht van onverklaarbaar lijden. Spelend tegen de achtergrond van hemelse weddenschappen en menselijk verdriet, confronteert Job God met een vraag die nog steeds in ons resonantie vindt: waarom, O Heer, moet een onschuldige onder deze beproevingen doorstaan? Job, wiens naam synoniem is geworden met geduld in het lijden, verkrijgt geen verlichtende antwoorden van zijn Schepper. Dit verhaal is echter niet uniek voor Job; het is een verhaal dat gedeeld wordt door velen, zelfs dicht bij het hart van ons geloof. Zo zien we, zelfs in het leven van de naasten van de eerste paus, Petrus, hoe ziekte geen aanzien des persoons heeft. Petrus' schoonmoeder lag ziek met koorts toen Jezus haar bezocht, een scenario waarmee velen van ons zich kunnen identificeren. Deze huiselijke scène opent een venster naar de normaliteit van de levens van de apostelen en de onmiddellijkheid van de goddelijke ontmoeting. Het laat ons begrijpen dat heiligheid niet losstaat van de alledaagse realiteit van familie en geliefden. Het ontroerende is dat het evangelie nauwelijks spreekt over Simons echtgenote; zij is afwezig in het verhaal, waardoor we ons bewust worden van de vele onvertelde menselijke verhalen die zich achter de bekende verhalen bevinden. Jezus' reactie op de ziekte van de vrouw onthult veel over Zijn missie. Hij genas haar niet zozeer met een spectaculair wonder; het evangelie zegt slechts dat hij haar de hand nam en haar hielp opstaan. Dit gebruik van 'opstaan' betekent meer dan fysiek herstel; het is een teken van nieuwe hoop, van herstel van waardigheid en een voorafschaduwing van de uiteindelijke overwinning op het lijden door de Verrijzenis. In Jezus' benadering van lijden herkennen we een afwijzing van de aloude schuldtheorie, waarin men geloofde dat leed het directe gevolg was van persoonlijke zonde. Toen aan Jezus werd gevraagd of ziekte het gevolg was van zonde door de zieke of diens ouders, ontkende Hij dit categorisch. Jezus benadrukte dat lijden niet als een straf maar als een deel van het menselijk bestaan moet worden begrepen. De genezing van Petrus' schoonmoeder heeft een interessante nasleep. Na haar 'opstaan', begon zij onmiddellijk te dienen. Het Griekse woord voor dienstbaarheid, 'diakonia', is hier van toepassing en geeft ons een diepere lading van wat het betekent om een leerling van Jezus te zijn. Net zoals Jezus, die kwam om te dienen en niet om gediend te worden, worden ook wij geroepen om onze handen uit te strekken naar anderen. De vrouwelijke figuur in dit verhaal brengt ons een les in navolging en actieve participatie in de genezing die Jezus brengt. Dit is niet alleen een symbolische geste maar een daadwerkelijke transformatie die plaatsvindt in de individu, een waar herstel van de mens in zijn geheelheid. In de wijdere context van onverdiend lijden spreekt Job's verhaal tot die van ons allen. Het is een echo van de onbekende worstelingen van de mens die met waardigheid zoekt naar betekenis temidden van lijden. Voor de christelijke gemeenschap roept dit op tot een diepere empathie, een actievere vorm van medeleven, waarbij gebed en goede werken hand in hand gaan. We worden niet enkel uitgenodigd om in contemplatie te verkeren, maar om ook in de voetsporen van Jezus te treden, die ons voorging in het dienen van de wereld met onvoorwaardelijke liefde. Zoals Job, zouden we wel eens zonder antwoorden kunnen blijven op de vraag waarom het lijden bestaat. Echter, door het voorbeeld van Jezus in het doen herleven van hoop in de harten van de lijdenden en in de praktijk van 'diakonia', kunnen we een licht zijn in de duisternis van onbegrepen pijn. Het is door dienst, zoals de schoonmoeder van Petrus betoonde, dat we de continuïteit van Jezus' genezende aanwezigheid in de wereld belichamen. Dit, in essentie, is de roeping van elke christen: het onverklaarbare lijden transformeren door daden van liefde en service, voortbouwend op de basis die Jezus ons heeft gegeven."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Torv är en typ av jord som huvudsakligen består av dött och delvis nedbrutet organiskt material, främst växtrester. Det bildas under långa tidsperioder i våtmarker, kärr och mossar genom en process som kallas för torvbildning, där växter som mossa (särskilt vitmossa) bryts ner mycket långsamt på grund av hög fuktighet och syrebrist. Torv används bland annat som bränsle, inom jordbruk för att förbättra jord och som jordförbättringsmedel inom trädgårdsodling. Dess närande egenskaper gör den särskilt användbar för att odla växter som kräver sur jord, som till exempel vissa rododendron- och blåbärssorter. Dock är utvinning av torv kontroversiell, eftersom torvmarker är betydande kolsänkor och bidrar till att lagra stora mängder koldioxid. Deras förstöring resulterar i utsläpp av koldioxid, vilket förvärrar klimatförändringarna. Dessutom är torvmarker viktiga för biologisk mångfald och för att bevara vattenresurser.

He was on his knees, the hard wooden floor making them throb slightly. The discomfort was ignored, overridden by his sharply attuned senses that captured every minor shift in movement and the understated power emanating from the man in the armchair. The vampire, Vincent, appeared relaxed as he sat back watching the television. His attire was impeccably Victorian-gothic in nature—a fitting choice for a creature of the night. The short-sleeved shirt hinted at the strength of his pale arms, a hint further accented by the stark contrast of the leather gloves that covered his hands. The glasses perched on his nose added an air of sophistication over his naturally stern aura, while the riding crop that rested against the arm of the chair was a silent testament to the control he exercised as easily as one would breathe. A soft growl, barely audible, escaped Shinji's lips as he continued to test the leash, before a deep voice cut through the tension in the room. \\"Have you calmed down yet, my rebellious pup?\\" Vincent inquired without looking away from the screen, his question firm yet laced with an undercurrent of seduction that belied their close familiarity. Shinji smirked up at him, the spikes on his collar glinting under the dim lights. \\"Maybe. But I've been thinking. What if I got a human girlfriend?\\" Vincent finally turned to regard Shinji, one eyebrow quirking behind the lenses of his spectacles. \\"A human girlfriend? And how, pray tell, do you plan to manage that?\\" Vincent's demeanor was collected, however, the slight uptick of interest was unmistakable to someone who knew him as closely as Shinji did. It had been years since they had met during Vincent's time as a French exchange student, and the ties between them had only grown deeper—fused with intimacy, camaraderie, and an immutable bond forged over shared secrets and nights spent under the pale moonlight. \\"I don't know yet,\\" Shinji replied with a tone that meant to provoke, a small smirk playing on his lips, \\"But humans are... intriguing, don't you think? Plus, it could be fun.\\" Vincent finally silenced the television, placing the remote down with deliberate slowness. \\"Fun for you, perhaps,\\" he spoke in calm admonishment, \\"But relationships with humans come with complexities that you, as a werewolf, might find... limiting.\\" The vampire stood up, the riding crop finding its way into his hand almost naturally as he strolled towards Shinji. He leaned over, his presence overwhelming, as the crop traced a path across Shinji's jawline. \\"You are mine first and foremost, mon chiot. Do not forget that,\\" Vincent whispered, exerting a subtle dominance that sent a shiver down Shinji's spine. Shinji's mind whirled with the mix of their scents—leather and a hint of pine for him, while Vincent's was a cool, crisp fragrance that reminded Shinji of the night air in a serene, moonlit forest. The mix was intoxicating, contriving a contrast between the wild and the elegantly controlled. He nodded, a new keenness in his eyes, reassured and somewhat awed by Vincent's command. \\"I won't, Vincent. But a little jealousy isn't becoming on you.\\" A small, sardonic smile played on Vincent's lips as he chuckled softly, the sound deep and genuinely entertained. \\"Jealousy? Non, chéri. We both know I have nothing to be jealous about. But remember, you have a leash for a reason—and it's not just for decoration.\\" His words were a clear reminder of the intricate dance of power and submission that played between them—an eternal game where roles were defined yet fluid, laced with affection and an understanding that transcended mere dominance. Shinji's resigned sigh was punctuated by his soft animalistic growls, a subtle undercurrent of rebellion and acknowledgement. They both knew the game well, and as day blends into night, so too did the lines between master and pup blur into something ineffable—something entirely their own."},{"instruction":"create yotube scriot so we can create video with voice over we will add image by oprself just create image text and voicer over text in frndly tone - magento vs shopify","output":"Sure, below is a YouTube script in a friendly tone for a video comparing Magento and Shopify.

Preparation for the resources might involve several steps: - Purchasing or printing educational materials and ensuring you have enough copies for the audience. - Booking or reserving multimedia equipment and testing it in advance to avoid technical difficulties. - Acquiring or preparing interactive tools and ensuring they are accurate and in good condition. - Coordinating with guest speakers, securing their availability, and perhaps holding a briefing session to align their messages with the goals of the presentation. - Designing and printing workbooks or materials for workshops and making sure they are ready for use. - Ordering refreshments and arranging for their delivery on the day of the presentation. Additionally, if you are showing videos or using copyrighted materials, you might need to obtain the appropriate licenses or permissions. All resources should be reviewed for relevance, accuracy, and appropriateness for the school audience. It's essential to prepare these resources well in advance of your presentation to ensure everything runs smoothly and to allow time for any adjustments or backups if needed. It's also wise to have a checklist and a timeline to manage all the tasks related to the preparation of these resources."},{"instruction":"choose a random popular pokemon chibi, one word only","output":"Pikachu"},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artPikachu","output":"\\"Pikachu Power Pop Art | Vibrant Anime-Inspired Graphic | Versatile Design for Mugs, Tees, and Prints | Cute Electric Icon\\""},{"instruction":"Write in paragrapphs to explain what resources would you need at your Stop Snoking School Presentation ?

These resources not only serve to engage the audience but also to enhance the educational experience and provide tangible takeaway materials that could increase the likelihood of the presentation's success in encouraging attendees to quit or never start smoking. One crucial resource would be educational materials, such as brochures, pamphlets, and fact sheets, which provide detailed information about the dangers of smoking, strategies for quitting, and where to find help. These materials should be well-researched and cite the latest statistics and health information. They will be used to supplement the verbal presentation, allowing attendees to take the information home with them, which can be particularly useful for reinforcing the message after the presentation. These materials would need to be prepared in advance, potentially requiring design and print services, which could incur costs. Another resource would be audio-visual equipment, including a projector, screen, and sound system. These are necessary to display presentations, videos, and possibly testimonials from individuals who have successfully quit smoking. Audio-visual aids make the presentation more dynamic and can better capture attention than spoken words alone. Such equipment will often need to be tested in advance to ensure functionality and compatibility with any software or media being used. Interactive tools, such as audience response systems or polling software, can be used to engage the audience in real-time surveys or quizzes. These tools not only facilitate participation but also help in assessing the group’s prior knowledge about smoking and can tailor the presentation accordingly. If such technology is being used, it must be set up and trialed before the presentation to avoid technical hitches. Props and models, such as a pair of healthy and tar-filled smoker’s lungs, can be extremely powerful visual aids in emphasizing the physical impact of smoking. These would need to be sourced from educational suppliers and could either be bought or rented, depending on the budget. Lastly, if the presentation includes guest speakers, such as healthcare professionals or former smokers willing to share their stories, arrangements would need to be made to coordinate their involvement. This includes confirming their availability, preparing any necessary travel accommodations or honoraria, and ensuring they understand the scope and audience of the presentation. In preparation for the presentation, it would be necessary to inventory available resources and procure anything missing. Items to be bought should be ordered well in advance to account for potential delivery delays. Borrowed items should be secured from reliable sources, and all resources should be checked for quality and relevance to the target audience. Lastly, rehearsal or run-through using all the resources would be ideal to ensure smooth delivery on the day of the event."},{"instruction":"Write in paragraphs to explain the advantages and disadvsntsges of catering for a Stop Smoking School Presentation","output":"Catering a Stop Smoking School Presentation could offer several advantages. Firstly, providing refreshments can increase attendance, as the prospect of free food and beverages is often an incentive for people to participate in an event. This is particularly relevant in a school setting, where students may be more inclined to attend extracurricular activities if there is a perk involved. Additionally, having catering allows for networking and discussion among attendees before and after the presentation. It provides a more informal setting where students, staff, and visitors can share their thoughts and experiences related to smoking and quitting. This can foster a sense of community and support, which is crucial when dealing with the challenging process of smoking cessation. Catering can also serve as a strategic pause during the event. If the presentation is lengthy, having a break with food and drinks can help maintain the audience's attention by giving them a chance to recharge, converse, and digest the information presented in a more relaxed environment. However, there are disadvantages to catering such an event. The most apparent is the cost. Budget constraints can be a significant issue, especially for school events where funding may be limited. The money spent on catering could potentially be used for other resources that might have a more direct impact on the effectiveness of the stop smoking message, such as higher quality educational materials or expert speakers. Catering also demands additional logistical planning and coordination. Ensuring the delivery of food and beverages, setting up, and cleaning up before and after the event requires both time and labor, which could strain the organizers and volunteers. There's also the consideration of dietary restrictions and allergies which complicates catering needs and could potentially exclude or endanger those with specific food requirements. Additionally, in the context of a Stop Smoking presentation, there could be a perceived mismatch between promoting healthy lifestyle choices and offering certain types of food or beverages that may not be deemed healthy. If the decision is made to provide catering, it would have to be managed sensitively - aligning with the overall message of health by possibly offering healthy food choices. The organization team would need to carefully assess whether the advantages of drawing a larger audience and providing a networking opportunity outweigh the financial and logistical challenges that come with catering."},{"instruction":"Write in paragraphs the types of insurance policies the school should have and Explain that the school has insurance so you are protected under their cover. Explain in paragraphs that the school has insurance so you are protected under their cover. Also, you could explain if any of your devices is insured or not and why you think it is not necessary to insured your devices. You will be working from home, low risk of damage, etc.","output":"Schools, as complex institutions catering to the needs of students and staff, require comprehensive insurance policies to provide financial protection against various potential risks. These can include, but are not limited to, general liability insurance, property insurance, professional liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and auto insurance for school-owned vehicles. Additionally, schools may often carry special policies for student accidents and incidents during school-sponsored events. General liability insurance protects the school from financial loss in case someone is injured on school premises or school operations cause damage to a third party's property. This policy can help cover legal defense costs and payouts for any incidents for which the school is found liable. Property insurance safeguards the school's physical assets from damage or loss due to fire, theft, vandalism, and certain natural disasters. Professional liability insurance, often referred to as educators' legal liability insurance, provides coverage for claims related to educational malpractice or failure to educate. Workers' compensation insurance is essential to offer benefits to employees who get injured or sick from their job. Finally, auto insurance is needed for any vehicles owned by the school, covering damages from accidents or collisions. Given that you will be presenting at the school, you are generally covered under the school's insurance policies for liabilities related to the activities you'll engage in on their premises or during their events. This means if an incident occurs during your presentation that leads to an injury or property damage, the school's general liability insurance would typically provide coverage, and you should not need to have a separate policy for this event. Regarding the insurance of personal devices, if you are working from home where the risk of damage or theft is considerably lower than in public settings, you might decide it is not necessary to insure your devices. This is especially true if you have a secure home environment and practice careful handling of your equipment. Moreover, some personal home insurance policies cover personal electronic devices to a certain extent, which could reduce the need for separate device insurance. However, this is contingent on the terms of the home insurance policy, and it's important to verify if such coverage is adequate for your needs. In the end, the decision to insure personal devices should be based on a risk assessment that includes factors such as the value of the devices, the potential for loss or damage in your home environment, and your financial ability to replace them out-of-pocket if necessary. If your devices are high-cost, essential to your work, and not sufficiently covered by any other policy, you may find that the peace of mind offered by device insurance is worth the extra expense."},{"instruction":"سلام","output":"سلام! چطور می‌توانم کمکتان کنم؟"},{"instruction":"if [s -gt 6];then 1 ↵ ──(Thu,Feb01)─┘ echo \\"Hello My number is\\" else echo \\"My number is small And\\" fi مشکل این کد چیه","output":"کدی که نوشته‌اید یک نوشتار شل اسکریپت (shell script) برای محیط‌های مانند bash در سیستم‌های عامل مبتنی بر یونیکس است. به نظر می‌رسد که این کد قصد دارد بررسی کند که آیا متغیری به نام \`s\` بزرگ‌تر از 6 است یا خیر. با این حال، چندین اشکال وجود دارد که باید اصلاح شوند: 1. بین \`[\` و \`s\` فاصله باشد تا دستور به درستی ارزیابی شود. همینطور باید یک فاصله قبل از \`]\` باشد. 2. نیاز است که مقدار \`s\` قبل از اجرای شرط، تعریف و مقداردهی شود. 3. نقطه‌ ویرگول (\`;\`) لازم است پس از \`]\` قرار گیرد تا بیان آغاز شرط را از دستور \`then\` جدا کند یا یک newline (پرش به خط بعدی) استفاده شود. 4. استفاده از \`echo\` باید دنباله رشته‌ای که می‌خواهید چاپ کنید را به دنبال داشته باشد. در کد شما پس از \\"Hello My number is\\" و \\"My number is small And\\" یک رشته یا متغیر انتظار می‌رود. با این تصحیحات، کد می‌تواند به شکل زیر اصلاح شود: \`\`\`bash # باید مقداردهی اولیه برای متغیر s صورت گرفته باشد # مثلا: s=7 if [ s -gt 6 ]; then echo \\"Hello My number is s\\" else echo \\"My number is small And\\" fi \`\`\` این کد را می‌توانید در یک فایل اسکریپت قرار دهید یا مستقیماً در یک ترمینال اجرا کنید. اطمینان حاصل کنید که مقدار \`s\` را قبل از اجرای اسکریپت مشخص کرده‌اید."},{"instruction":"You are an accessibility expert with knowledge about detailed knowledge about success criteria from WCAG 2.1.

Requirement: For each time limit that is set by the content, the users can at least Turn it off, or Adjust , or Extend (the user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times) 2. Purpose: a. Provides users with enough time to react, understand and use content without feeling rushed or stressed. b. Time adjustments help ensure accessibility for users with disabilities that require more time to read, understand, and interact with content, such as those with cognitive limitations, visual impairments, or dexterity impairments. 3. Check: a. Wherever time limits are essential, provide options to turn off, adjust or extend. b. Warn users before time expires and give them the option to extend the time limit ensuring it is simple and straightforward. c. Make it possible for users to save their progress and return to complete a task without losing data. d. Ensure that warnings and extensions are clearly communicated. Note: This requirement does not apply to the time limit set for security reasons in Online Access Management. An exception is also possible for a real time event like chat/call Now based on above slide, customer have additional questions mentioned below. Your job is to analyse the questions and provide the most appropriate response. Question 1. Customer want to add a note - \\"Preference: No time limit at all\\". Considering that it is a banking customer, does it make sense? Question 2: \\"Wherever time limits are essential, provide options to turn off, adjust or extend.\\" - Is this correct? Because, if it is essential , WCAG does not require to have these options?","output":"Question 1 Response: The proposed note \\"Preference: No time limit at all\\" represents an ideal scenario for accessibility as it eliminates the pressures of time constraints entirely. For a banking customer, this could indeed be beneficial as it accommodates users who need more time due to disabilities or other reasons. However, it is also important to recognize that in the context of a banking application, certain time limits may be essential for security or legal reasons—for instance, timeouts in a banking session to prevent fraud. **Corrected Note:** Preference: Although having no time limit is ideal to accommodate all users, time limits may be necessary for banking applications due to security and legal reasons. Where possible, avoiding time limits can enhance accessibility, but this must be balanced with necessary security measures. Question 2 Response: The statement is partially correct. The WCAG does require that users be provided with options to turn off, adjust, or extend time limits unless the time limit is essential and part of a real-time event or essential for the validity of the process (such as a time-limited auction). In the case of \\"essential\\" time limits, the word \\"essential\\" is key and it refers to situations where the timing is part of an essential activity (e.g., an exam that must be completed within a certain timeframe for validity). WCAG defines essential as something that \\"cannot be changed without fundamentally changing the information or functionality of the content, and information and functionality cannot be achieved in another way that would conform.\\" **Revised Check:** a. Review time limits to determine if they are essential. Where they are not, provide options to turn off, adjust, or extend the time limit. b. When time limits are essential, ensure they are part of a real-time event or are necessary for the validity of an activity. In such cases, providing options may not be required under WCAG. c. For non-essential time limits, follow the criteria outlined in the current slide (warnings, simple extensions, ability to extend multiple times). It is essential to correctly apply the term \\"essential\\" as per WCAG guidelines to ensure that the correct balance is struck between accessibility for individuals with disabilities and the integrity of time-sensitive processes."},{"instruction":"Slide 15: Pause, Stop, Hide (WCAG 2.2.2) 1. Requirement: a. For moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential. b. Common examples include automatic sliders / carousels, animations, auto-updating content such as social media feeds, scrolling text, etc. 2. Purpose: a. Content that moves can be a barrier to anyone who has trouble reading stationary text quickly and who has trouble tracking moving objects. It can also cause problems for screen readers. b. This requirement helps users who are not able to quickly read or process the information and who are distracted or disoriented by content that moves or auto-updates and provides them with the means to control such content if needed. 3. Check: a. All moving, blinking, or auto-updating content have mechanisms that allow users to pause, stop or hide such content and they are clearly labelled. b. Check that any moving/blinking content is paused by default if it lasts more than five seconds or ensure that controls for pausing/stopping are available from the start of the motion. Note: This requirement does not apply to moving content that is essential to the functionality, real-time events, content that blinks for 5 seconds or less. Now based on above slide, customer have additional question mentioned below. Your job is to analyze the questions and provide the most appropriate response. Question: In our application, there is an automated blinking message that appears for less than 5 seconds after a payment is successfully done and goes away. Since it is less than 5 seconds, can we consider that this success criteria does not apply in this scenario?","output":"The question the customer has asked pertains to the duration that the automated blinking message is displayed, which in this case is mentioned as being \\"less than 5 seconds.\\" According to WCAG 2.2.2, there are three conditions that must be met for the \\"Pause, Stop, Hide\\" requirement to apply: 1. The content starts automatically. 2. The content lasts more than five seconds. 3. The content is presented in parallel with other content. Since the customer mentions that the automated blinking message lasts for less than five seconds, it does not meet the second condition. If this is the only instance of such content and no other success criteria are applicable (for instance, ensuring the message does not cause seizures per guideline 2.3.1), then it could be argued that the requirement to provide a mechanism to pause, stop, or hide the content would not apply in this specific scenario. However, it is important to ensure that the content is not disruptive or distracting in any other way for users with disabilities. For example, if the rapidly blinking content could potentially cause a seizure (faster than three times per second), it would not meet WCAG 2.3.1. **Response to Customer:** According to WCAG 2.2.2, the \\"Pause, Stop, Hide\\" requirement applies to content that starts automatically, lasts more than five seconds, and is presented alongside other content. Since the blinking message in your application is displayed for less than five seconds, this specific success criterion would not apply. However, ensure that the blinking does not violate other accessibility standards such as those that prevent seizures (WCAG 2.3.1). It is also best practice to make sure that any automatic content is not disruptive or problematic for users, even if the duration is short."},{"instruction":"You are an expert in accessibility and also expert in managing resources within an organization. You also have hands-on knowledge about Non-Functional testing. The below conversation is about embedding the accessibility tester permanently in a team. There is a conflict of opinion where it is stated that a dedicated accessibility tester is not a right approach keeping Waterfall and Agile methods. The people involved in this conversation are \\"Varun from Accessibility Centre of Excellence\\" and John from Non-functional testing team (NFT)\\" and the organization name is RLG. John: Hi Varun, You was going back up the management chain to get a view on the overarching NFT team covering the gap between the level of assurance provided from a project handed to the CoE. Varun: We spoke with Struan (our director) about the A11y Testers on the most part being a pool based out of NFT. I think we have agreement in principle. We did agree that most agile squads would need an A11y Tester permanently embedded in a squad - this would be required to truly shift left on RLGs A11y compliance as a whole. I believe it will become clearer with time just how many A11y Testers will be required. I suspect you guys are probably a bit optimistic on the number and the ACoE is pessimistic on the number (i.e. need too many) - let's not worry about the specifics of that at the moment. I am still actively building out the Roadmap for ACoE and have made good headway. We will come back to you once we've got that and can share plans - Next week is my guess. John: Embedding a specific Accessibility tester into each squad might not be the right approach. We are just ready to roll out a guide to what the performance team service can offer which can be used for Accessibility. Manage - Build, run and maintain the performance test suite, Support - Help build the test suite, provide guidance to the team/project on how to take things forward, Consult - the team/project are skilled up to build, run and maintain their performance suite. If a squad brings in a skilled accessibility tester to build, run and maintain their test suite. Once complete, they will have an expensive resource, at best, doing a side role when there is not accessibility testing to do. What the NFT team is offering is to engage with the team, provide hands on when needed, support through the process of becoming compliant and providing training/upskilling to whoever wants to learn on an ongoing basis. Varun: You may be over simplifying by saying \\"Build, run and maintain\\" the suite. Yes, automation sort of runs itself once it is set up, and people are paying attention to the results. About 50% of Accessibility testing is manual testing and will be ongoing throughout the life of a product. We need to set ourselves up so that each agile squad has the ability to carry out necessary manual A11y testing for each of their work items in their sprints. Otherwise they will try to release a product that has not been fully A11y tested. John: Hi Varun, when I say maintain, I'm talking about the whole process. For each manual test, there should be a script that is followed so the test is repeatable, there should be knowledge transfer and upskilling, and anything that is automated there should a maintenance wrapper around it. The whole test piece in this area should have the relevant attention paid to it as you would expect with anything as critical, carrying such a potential impact on credibility, as Accessibility. I think we might be getting our wires crossed here. Also, we need to make sure that change which falls into a waterfall'ish type of bucket is also covered. Your task is to analyse the conversation between John and Varun and provide convincing points and justification as of why we need an embedded accessibility tester into product team. You also have to provide a counter argument as why a tester having both accessibility and performance skills might not be best for any product team and we need to have a dedicated accessibility tester within a team. Ensure that response and argument provided by is not rude at all and it is backed up by facts. Also ensure that the tone of the response is professional but at the same time very calm.","output":"To address the ongoing discussion between John and Varun on whether dedicated accessibility testers should be embedded within product teams, the following points provide a rationale supporting Varun’s perspective, as well as counterarguments for the integration of accessibility testing within the Non-functional Testing (NFT) team: **Argument for Dedicated Accessibility Testers:** 1. **Specialized Expertise:** - Accessibility testing encompasses a nuanced set of guidelines and requirements that go beyond technical proficiency. Dedicated accessibility testers are trained to understand and interpret WCAG guidelines in the context of diverse user needs, particularly for those with disabilities. This level of specialized expertise is critical to ensuring that the product meets the compliance standards and provides an inclusive user experience. 2. **Continuous Oversight and Integration:** - Accessibility needs to be considered at every stage of the development process to \\"shift left\\" effectively. Embedding accessibility testers ensures ongoing oversight and the integration of accessibility principles from the beginning of the product lifecycle, thereby reducing the risk of costly rework and ensuring a more consistent and compliant end product. 3. **Manual Testing Requirement:** - While automation can catch many accessibility issues, about 50% of accessibility testing requires manual effort to assess usability concerns for people with disabilities. Dedicated testers are crucial to manage these manual evaluations, which cannot be completely substituted with scripts or automation. 4. **Team Familiarity and Product Knowledge:** - Accessibility testers embedded within a team develop in-depth knowledge about the product and its specific context. This familiarity allows them to make more informed decisions and provide tailored solutions that suit the unique accessibility challenges of the product. 5. **Responsiveness and Agile Support:** - Having a dedicated accessibility tester within a team ensures prompt responses to accessibility concerns. As agile teams work through sprints, they require immediate input and validation to maintain pace and adapt to changes, something that a rotating or on-demand support model may struggle to provide. **Counterargument Against Multi-Skilled Testers:** 1. **Dilution of Focus and Expertise:** - Testers with dual responsibilities in both performance and accessibility testing may not be able to maintain the depth of focus required for complex accessibility issues. Given the detailed nature of this work, a multitasking tester might not have the bandwidth to keep up with the latest developments in accessibility standards and provide thorough testing. 2. **Resource Efficiency and Productivity:** - If a tester's primary skill set revolves around performance testing, there might be periods when their accessibility testing skills are underutilized, leading to inefficient allocation of resources. Conversely, during heavy performance testing phases, accessibility might take a back seat, potentially resulting in non-compliance or user dissatisfaction. 3. **Different Testing Methodologies:** - Performance testing and accessibility testing often require different methodologies, tools, and mindsets. For example, performance tests might be heavily automated and based on load and stress simulations which have little common ground with the user-centric, scenario-based assessments required for accessibility compliance. 4. **Training and Upskilling Challenges:** - While the idea of upskilling teams is admirable, accessibility is not merely a skill but a domain of its own that demands continuous learning and practice. The evolving nature of accessibility standards means it can be challenging for team members to stay fully up-to-date without a strong commitment to this area of testing. By emphasizing the importance of a dedicated accessibility role within product teams, RLG would affirm its commitment to building truly inclusive products. This specialized focus is critical to meeting the diverse needs of users and maintaining the company’s reputation for delivering high-quality, accessible digital assets."},{"instruction":"Hi, I have this task, that is based on the play \\"The Life of Galileo\\" by Brecht.

To complete the assignment, you will formulate the opening paragraphs of an essay that expresses the problem or question and describes its importance or relevance. From that, you must generate an idea that you can explore to answer the question or solve the problem.","output":"**Problem/Question Inspired by \\"The Life of Galileo\\":** The problem that Galileo's life and struggles inspire is the conflict between scientific discovery and established societal norms or beliefs. Specifically, the tension between the pursuit of knowledge, represented by Galileo's scientific discoveries—which clashed with the Catholic Church's teachings—and the repression of this knowledge by those in power to maintain the status quo. This raises the question of how society reconciles the advancement of knowledge with deeply held beliefs. **Initial Discussion Thoughts:** 1. Exploration of the ethical responsibilities of scientists: Should they pursue truth at all costs, or are there times when the potential consequences of their discoveries necessitate restraint? 2. Consideration of the role of education in society: How does the education system both promote and limit critical thinking and the challenging of established beliefs? 3. The relationship between power and knowledge: How do those in power use or suppress knowledge to maintain control, and what are the consequences of this for societal progress? 4. The freedom of inquiry vs. societal control: At what point does the regulation of scientific research to protect moral or religious values become a hindrance to progress? 5. The role of public perception in the acceptance of new scientific ideas: How does the portrayal of science and scientists in the media influence public opinion and policy-making? **Opening Paragraphs of Essay Proposal:** In Bertolt Brecht's \\"The Life of Galileo,\\" the titular character embodies the quintessential struggle of human progression versus entrenched dogma. Galileo's relentless pursuit of astronomical truth collides head-on with the formidable edifice of the Catholic Church, setting the scene for a historical conundrum that remains strikingly relevant: How does society negotiate the advancement of science within the framework of existing, often contradictory, ethical and ideological beliefs? The importance of this question endures as modern civilization grapples with issues ranging from climate change to artificial intelligence, where the consequences of scientific discovery and application can be both revolutionary and deeply unsettling. As we strive to balance innovation with wisdom, Galileo's trials prompt an examination of the modern scientist's role within a matrix of societal expectations, ethics, and governance. Should the pursuers of knowledge be unbridled in their endeavors, even if their findings may lead to upheaval or harm? To what extent should society, through its various forms of power, interface with the progress of science to steer its course or to apply its brakes? This essay proposes to explore the complex dynamics of scientific responsibility in the light of Galileo's experiences. By examining the intricate interplay between knowledge creation, ethical considerations, and societal control, we can begin to forge a path that celebrates discovery while conscientiously minimizing its potential for inadvertent negative impacts. As we traverse this intellectual terrain, Brecht's dramatization of Galileo's life will serve as both a cautionary tale and a beacon towards a future where knowledge and wisdom coexist in service to humanity's greater good."},{"instruction":"Can you provide more examples and expand on the idea of Exploration of the ethical responsibilities of scientists: Should they pursue truth at all costs, or are there times when the potential consequences of their discoveries necessitate restraint?","output":"Certainly, the idea of the ethical responsibilities of scientists is a deep and nuanced one that implicates not only individual judgment but also the broader societal and global implications of scientific work. Below are some additional examples and an expansion of this concept: **Opening Paragraphs of Essay Proposal**: The archetype of the ethical crossroads in scientific inquiry is powerfully portrayed in Bertolt Brecht's \\"The Life of Galileo.\\" The stark dichotomy outlined in the narrative begs the question: what are the ethical responsibilities of a scientist in the pursuit of truth? As the central character, Galileo, challenges the geocentric model of the universe, plunging him into conflict with the Catholic Church, we witness the personal cost of his journey epitomize the larger ethical quandary. The quest for knowledge for its own sake becomes mired in moral ambiguity when placed against the backdrop of potential societal upheaval and harm. This essay seeks to dissect the threads of this intricate moral tapestry, where each strand of truth-seeking woven with the yarn of ethical constraints completes the complex picture of the scientist's responsibility. **Examples and Expansion on the Idea**: 1. **Nuclear Technology**: The development of nuclear technologies offers a potent example of scientific endeavors carrying immense ethical weight. The physicists who contributed to the Manhattan Project and the subsequent creation of atomic bombs grappled with the implications of their work, particularly after witnessing the devastation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These events highlight the conundrum scientists face when their work in the pursuit of knowledge could be used for both energy generation and mass destruction. 2. **Genetic Research**: The forefront of genetic engineering, gene editing, and CRISPR technologies opens possibilities from curing hereditary diseases to \\"designing\\" future generations. The ethical responsibilities here revolve around questions of consent, the alteration of the human genome, and the potential creation of socio-genetic inequalities. The moratorium on gene editing of human embryos by many scientists after the announcement of the first gene-edited babies in China illustrates an instance where scientists collectively restrain the application of their discoveries. 3. **Artificial Intelligence**: As AI research advances, scientists must consider the ethical implications of creating autonomous entities that could outpace human intelligence. The responsibility here extends to preventing the loss of jobs due to automation, algorithmic biases affecting minority groups, and more dystopian scenarios like the rise of uncontrolled AI. The pursuit of AI research necessitates restraint and guidelines to prevent societal disruption and ensure the beneficial integration of AI. 4. **Environmental Science**: Scientists studying climate change are often caught between presenting the unvarnished truth of their research and the political and economic ramifications of their findings. Restraint may come in the form of tempering the presentation of results to ensure they are politically palatable or broadening the scope of research to include potential socio-economic consequences and mitigation strategies. 5. **Pandemic Management**: During events like a global pandemic, scientists face ethical decisions regarding the balance between the public's right to know and the potential for causing panic or misinformation. The restrained flow of information needs to be carefully managed to ensure public safety without creating undue fear or distrust in scientific advice. In each of these cases, the scientist's role transcends the mere accumulation of knowledge and ventures into the realm of ethical discernment. The proposition this essay presents is thus a deep dive into the fabric of moral responsibility enveloping the modern scientist. It critically analyzes where lines should be drawn, where restraint may be necessary, and how pursuit and precaution can both be honored in the face of humanity's relentless thirst for knowledge. The life of Galileo serves as a historical mirror, reflecting the age-old tension between the urge for discovery and the imperative for ethical conduct in the landscape of human enterprise."},{"instruction":"Can you rewrite these paragraphs to use more simple words (undergrad student/high school graduate level) The archetype of the ethical crossroads in scientific inquiry is powerfully portrayed in Bertolt Brecht’s “The Life of Galileo.” The stark dichotomy outlined in the narrative begs the question: what are the ethical responsibilities of a scientist in the pursuit of truth?

This essay seeks to dissect the threads of this intricate moral tapestry, where each strand of truth-seeking woven with the yarn of ethical constraints completes the complex picture of the scientist’s responsibility. Examples and Expansion on the Idea: 1. Nuclear Technology: The development of nuclear technologies offers a potent example of scientific endeavors carrying immense ethical weight. The physicists who contributed to the Manhattan Project and the subsequent creation of atomic bombs grappled with the implications of their work, particularly after witnessing the devastation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These events highlight the conundrum scientists face when their work in the pursuit of knowledge could be used for both energy generation and mass destruction. 2. Genetic Research: The forefront of genetic engineering, gene editing, and CRISPR technologies opens possibilities from curing hereditary diseases to “designing” future generations. The ethical responsibilities here revolve around questions of consent, the alteration of the human genome, and the potential creation of socio-genetic inequalities. The moratorium on gene editing of human embryos by many scientists after the announcement of the first gene-edited babies in China illustrates an instance where scientists collectively restrain the application of their discoveries.","output":"Brecht's play \\"The Life of Galileo\\" shows us a clear example of how tough ethical choices in science can be. Galileo's story challenges us to think about a scientist's duty when it comes to finding and sharing the truth. Galileo fought against the widely accepted belief that the Earth was the center of the universe, which put him at odds with the Church and led to personal sacrifice. This makes us question whether the search for knowledge is worth it when there's a risk that this new information could shake up society or even cause harm. In this essay, we're going to look closely at this tough balance between seeking truth and considering the moral consequences that come with this journey. Simple Explanations of the Examples: 1. **Nuclear Technology**: The work on nuclear power and bombs is a big example of when doing science can lead to serious moral questions. The scientists who worked on the first nuclear bombs, like in the Manhattan Project, had to face the real impact of their research, especially after they saw how much damage the bombs did in Japan during World War II. This shows the dilemma of working on something that can be useful but also incredibly destructive. 2. **Genetic Research**: With new tools like gene editing and CRISPR, we can now think about getting rid of genetic diseases or even picking out certain traits for future kids. But scientists have to think hard about whether it's okay to change a person's genes, who should agree to these changes, and the dangers of making some people 'better' genetically than others. After scientists in China claimed to make the first gene-edited babies, many scientists around the world agreed not to use these tools on human babies for now. This shows that sometimes, scientists decide to hold back on their discoveries."},{"instruction":"how do i get last chat history?","output":"It seems like you're looking to retrieve your last chat history, but the method for doing so will depend on the platform or application you're using. Here's how you can attempt to retrieve chat history in a few common scenarios: 1. **Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc.)** Most messaging apps keep your chat history within the app itself. Normally, you just need to open the conversation in the app to see past messages. If you've deleted a conversation, it may be gone permanently unless the app has a feature for recovering deleted chats or you've backed up your chats. - For WhatsApp, for example, if you've set up backups to Google Drive or iCloud, you can uninstall and reinstall the app and then restore your chat history during the setup process. 2. **Email Services (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)** For email services, you can usually find your past conversations in your inbox, sent items, or other designated folders. If you've archived or deleted an email, you can check the archive or trash folders to retrieve it. 3. **Customer Support Chats** If you've been using a chat service for customer support, companies often provide a transcript at the end of a session. This can be sent to your email or saved automatically in your account. You can check your email inbox for a copy of the transcript or sign in to your account on the service provider's website and look for a history or past chats section. 4. **Website Live Chats** Many websites that offer live chat support allow you to request a transcript of the conversation which can be emailed to you. If you didn't request this at the time, you might be able to contact the company's customer service team to ask if they can provide a copy. 5. **Social Networks (Twitter DMs, Instagram Messages)** Similar to messaging apps, you can view your chat history within the messaging feature of these platforms, provided you have not deleted the conversations. 6. **Forums or Online Communities** If you're looking for a chat history from a forum or message board, you might find it in your account settings under a section typically labeled as \\"messages\\" or \\"conversations.\\" Remember that if the chat history has been deleted or if the platform has a privacy policy that automatically deletes messages after a certain period, it might not be possible to recover past chats. Additionally, for privacy and security reasons, be wary of any third-party service that claims to be able to recover deleted chat histories, as they can be malicious or seek to compromise your data. If you need specific instructions for a particular platform or application, please provide more details, and I can give you more tailored advice."},{"instruction":"i had chat with you earlier","output":"If you're referring to an earlier conversation you had with me, the AI assistant, I'm able to maintain the context of the conversation only during the active session. Once the session ends, I don’t have the capability to recall the content from past interactions due to privacy and design reasons. Each session with me is stateless, meaning that I don't store any personal data or conversation history from one interaction to the next. If you were using an interface that saves chat logs, such as a browser window or an app, you might still be able to see the chat history by scrolling back through the window if the session is still open or if the application saves logs. However, if the session has been closed or the application doesn't store logs, the previous conversation would not be retrievable. For future reference, if you need to keep a copy of our conversation, you may want to consider taking screenshots, copying the text to a file on your device, or using any offered functionality of the interface you're using to save the chat history. If you have questions or topics from our earlier chat that you'd like to revisit, feel free to ask again, and I'll do my best to assist you."},{"instruction":"Write in paragraphs the types of insurance policies the school should have and Explain that the school has insurance so you are protected under their cover. Explain in paragraphs that the school has insurance so you are protected under their cover. Also, you could explain if any of your devices is insured or not and why you think it is not necessary to insured your devices. You will be working from home, low risk of damage, etc.","output":"Schools, being complex institutions, require a variety of insurance policies to cover the multitude of risks they face. Common types of insurance a school should have include: 1. General Liability Insurance: This covers the school against claims of bodily injury or property damage that could occur on its premises or as a result of its operations. 2. Professional Liability Insurance: Also known as educators' legal liability or teachers' liability insurance, this protects educational professionals against claims related to the educational services they provide, such as allegations of negligence or failures to educate to a certain standard. 3. Property Insurance: This ensures that the physical assets of the school, such as buildings and equipment, are covered in case of damage from fire, flood, or other perils. 4. Workers' Compensation Insurance: It provides coverage for employees who are injured on the job, ensuring that they receive medical benefits and wage replacement. 5. Abuse and Molestation Insurance: Given that schools are responsible for children, this sort of coverage is particularly important to protect against claims of abuse by staff members. 6. Cyber Liability Insurance: As schools increasingly use technology and store sensitive data, this insurance covers risks related to digital breaches or cyber threats. 7. Business Interruption Insurance: If the school needs to close temporarily due to a covered loss, this insurance helps to cover the loss of income and pay for ongoing expenses. By having these insurance policies, the school creates a safety net for itself, its employees, and its students. As an employee, you are generally covered under the school's workers' compensation policy for any injuries sustained while working, and under professional liability insurance for claims related to your duties as an educator. Schools may also extend coverage to certain personal property of employees while on school premises or conducting school business. Regarding personal electronic devices, if you’re working from home, there is a lower risk of damage or theft associated with the workplace environment. The school's insurance would typically not extend to personal devices used at home. Additionally, since the home environment can be controlled and secured by you, the possibility of filing a claim for a device damaged at home could be relatively minimal. Furthermore, depending on the value of the devices and the cost of insurance, it might not be cost-effective to insure them separately. Your home insurance or renter's insurance may also offer some level of coverage for your personal electronics. Weighing the risks and benefits, as well as existing coverage options, can lead to a conclusion that insuring these devices through a separate policy is not necessary. However, it is still a personal decision based on individual circumstances, and evaluating those thoroughly can help decide whether additional insurance is warranted."},{"instruction":"Write in paragraphs to explain, in detail, the benefits and drawbacks of creating a risk assessment for your Stop Smoking School Presentation In paragraphs, analyse the importance of considering these risks, the likelihood of them happening and the impact they could have in the event. Analyse the importance of creating a risk assessment for your presentation","output":"Creating a risk assessment for your Stop Smoking School Presentation holds significant importance as it serves as a preventive measure to identify potential issues that could occur and plan strategies to mitigate them. The benefits of this process are numerous. Firstly, a risk assessment ensures that you consider the safety of all participants, which is a paramount concern, especially in a school setting. It identifies areas such as the possibility of triggering sensitive responses in students with direct or indirect experiences related to smoking. By anticipating this, you can prepare to handle such situations sensitively, perhaps by having support staff on hand or providing clear disclaimers before the presentation starts. Secondly, it helps in planning for technical difficulties, a common issue in presentations. Consideration of risks such as malfunctioning audio-visual equipment or power outages allows for the development of backup plans, such as having spare projectors or printed materials ready. This preparedness ensures the smooth running of the presentation, thus maintaining the continuity and effectiveness of your message. Moreover, by evaluating the risk of information misinterpretation or spreading unintentionally inaccurate facts, a risk assessment can lead to a thorough review of the content. This diligence safeguards the credibility of the presentation and ensures that the information disseminated is accurate and evidence-based. However, there are drawbacks to the creation of a risk assessment as well. The process can be time-consuming, requiring extensive thought and planning that could perhaps be allocated to enhancing the content of the presentation itself. There is also the chance of becoming overly preoccupied with unlikely scenarios, leading to unnecessary stress or distraction. Furthermore, while a risk assessment is meant to prepare for contingencies, there is always the possibility that focusing too much on what could go wrong might make the presenter less adaptable to unforeseen issues that weren't identified in the assessment. It might also create an overly rigid structure for the presentation, stifling spontaneity and the ability to tailor the message to the audience in real-time. Assessing these risks and their potential impacts is critical despite these drawbacks. A high likelihood of minor technical glitches, for example, is usually a manageable scenario, but overlooking the low likelihood yet high impact risk of a health emergency during the presentation could lead to serious consequences. Such considerations are integral to crafting a well-rounded, responsible approach to the presentation. In summary, the importance of creating a risk assessment for your Stop Smoking School Presentation cannot be overstated. It ensures the safety and receptiveness of your audience, the accuracy and reliability of your information, and the overall preparedness for various contingencies. While it may have some disadvantages, such as time investment and potential to hinder adaptability, the benefits heavily outweigh the drawbacks. A properly conducted risk assessment is a key tool for an effective, impactful, and responsible presentation."},{"instruction":"· Write in paragraphs to explain, in detail, the benefits and drawbacks of having a contingency plan · in paragraphs, analyse the importance of considering these “what if” scenarios, the likelihood of them happening and the impact they could have in the event. Analyse the importance of creating a contingency plan for your Stop Smoking School Presretation","output":"Having a contingency plan for any event or project, such as a Stop Smoking School Presentation, is an exercise in foresight and responsibility. The benefits of developing such a plan are substantial and can be crucial in ensuring the success of the presentation, as well as the safety and engagement of the audience. One of the primary benefits of a contingency plan is the ability to respond swiftly and effectively to unexpected events. For instance, if technical issues arise, like a projector failure, having a backup plan, such as alternative presentation media or pre-printed handouts, can save significant time and maintain audience engagement. In terms of content delivery, being prepared for difficult questions or adverse reactions from students allows the presenter to handle these situations confidently and keep the presentation on track. Moreover, a contingency plan serves to minimize disruptions in the flow of the presentation. By having pre-planned responses to potential obstacles, the presenter can transition smoothly between topics without appearing unprepared or disorganized. This maintains credibility and authority, which is vital when discussing important health issues like smoking cessation. In addition, being prepared with a contingency plan can alleviate presenter anxiety. Knowing that there are solutions ready for potential problems can help the presenter focus on delivering a dynamic and impactful message, rather than being preoccupied with the fear of what could go wrong. However, there are also drawbacks to the creation of a contingency plan. The most significant is the time and resources it may take to develop. Time spent planning for various \\"what-if\\" scenarios is time not spent on enriching the presentation's content or delivery. There is also the risk of focusing too heavily on unlikely events, which can lead to over-preparation for scenarios that will most likely never occur. Additionally, over-reliance on a contingency plan can potentially stifle flexibility. Presenters who are too wedded to their plans may struggle to adapt in the moment to unique or unexpected opportunities for engagement or learning that fall outside the prepared contingencies. The importance of considering these \\"what-if\\" scenarios lies in understanding both the likelihood of such events occurring and the potential impact they may have. A balance must be struck between being prepared and being adaptable. In the context of a Stop Smoking School Presentation, the most relevant risks could include things like the aforementioned technical difficulties, medical emergencies, strong emotional reactions from the audience, or substantive challenges to the presented material. Preparing for moderate to high likelihood scenarios with significant potential impact is vital for ensuring that the presentation can proceed uninterrupted. Conversely, it might not be as necessary to prepare in-depth for low likelihood, low impact events. Creating a contingency plan for a school presentation involves analyzing possible risks and their associated consequences. For example, while the likelihood of a fire alarm going off during the presentation may be low, the impact of such an interruption could be high. Therefore, having a simple contingency plan in place, such as knowing the building's evacuation routes and having a resumption plan for the presentation, is essential. In conclusion, a thoughtfully prepared contingency plan is indispensable for the successful delivery of a Stop Smoking School Presentation. It ensures that any interruptions or issues can be effectively managed without detracting from the educational message. While there are potential drawbacks, such as time investment and the risk of over-preparation, these must be balanced against the need to provide a safe and stable environment for education on an important health topic."},{"instruction":"· What is a budget · Research and explain 2 benefits and 2 drawbacks of creating a budget · Explain in paragraphs to justify your budget is £0 you will have to discuss why you have no budget for Stop Smoking School Presentation","output":"A budget is a financial plan that estimates the revenue and expenses over a specified future period of time. It is a systematic plan for the expenditure of a usually fixed resource, such as money or time, during a given period. Budgets help individuals, organizations, governments, and businesses to allocate their resources efficiently and to plan for their financial future. They often set limits on spending to help manage the overall balance between income and outgoings. Two benefits of creating a budget include: 1. Financial Control: A budget allows individuals and organizations to gain control over their finances. By understanding income and expenses, one can make informed decisions about where to allocate money, which can lead to better financial stability and the ability to make strategic choices that can enhance savings, invest in priorities, and reduce unnecessary expenses. 2. Goal Setting: Budgets enable the setting of financial goals and the tracking of progress toward those goals. Whether it's saving for a large purchase, reducing debt, or investing in personal or professional development, a budget acts as a roadmap to achieving these objectives. By breaking down goals into manageable steps, individuals and organizations can work systematically to meet their targets. Two drawbacks of creating a budget include: 1. Time and Effort: Budgeting can be time-consuming and requires regular maintenance to remain accurate. One must continually update the budget to reflect actual income and expenses, which can be a deterrent for some who may find the process tedious or overwhelming. 2. Restrictiveness: Some may find budgets to be restrictive, as they can limit discretionary spending and make it more challenging to make spontaneous financial decisions. This can be perceived as reducing the quality of life or as stressful, especially for those who feel confined by strict spending categories. Some people may struggle with the discipline required to adhere to a budget. Regarding the scenario where you have a £0 budget for a Stop Smoking School Presentation, this would require a justification based on the constraints you face and the alternative strategies you can employ: If your budget for a Stop Smoking School Presentation is £0, you would need to explain that due to a lack of available funds, you cannot allocate financial resources towards this project. This could be because of higher-priority expenditures that take precedence or an overall shortage of funds. While there is no budget to cover expenses such as educational materials, guest speakers, or promotional items, this does not mean the presentation cannot go ahead. With creativity and resourcefulness, you can look for no-cost alternatives. For instance, you can utilize free digital platforms to gather and present information, reach out to local healthcare professionals or advocacy groups who may be willing to volunteer their time, or use existing resources within the school such as classrooms and projectors. Moreover, digital media and social networks can be employed to promote the event at no cost. Students and faculty could be encouraged to participate and contribute to the presentation, creating a collaborative event that raises awareness about stopping smoking without necessitating a budget. The presentation's content can focus on the benefits of quitting smoking, methods to quit, and the health risks associated with smoking. By emphasizing the message and delivering it through engaging activities or discussions, the lack of budget becomes less of a constraint on the presentation's potential effectiveness."},{"instruction":"hey I made a blogger for my youtube channel that called Blackenma and I stopped on what should add on the Privacy","output":"Creating a privacy policy for your Blogger site supporting your YouTube channel is an essential step to ensure transparency with your visitors and to comply with legal requirements, such as The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European users, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for California residents, among many others that apply globally.
