This is a typical application of the pigeonhole principle. 2. **Step 2: Pigeonhole principle:**     The pigeonhole principle states that if more objects (pigeons) are placed into fewer containers (pigeonholes) than the number of objects, then at least one container must contain more than one object. 3. **Step 3: Dividing the triangle:**     To apply the pigeonhole principle, we will divide the equilateral triangle in such a way that we have regions (pigeonholes) wherein any two points within the same region are at a distance less than 0.5 units. 4. **Step 4: Creating regions:**     We divide the equilateral triangle of side length 1 into four smaller, congruent equilateral triangles. We can do this by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the original triangle, which results in 4 smaller triangles inside the larger one.    For example, let's call the original equilateral triangle ( triangle ABC ). If we denote the midpoints of sides ( AB ), ( BC ), and ( CA ) as ( M ), ( N ), and ( O ) respectively, then connecting ( M ) to ( N ), ( N ) to ( O ), and ( O ) to ( M ) splits ( triangle ABC ) into four smaller equilateral triangles. 5. **Step 5: Verifying the maximum distance within each region:**    Each of these smaller equilateral triangles has a side length of 0.5 units. The maximum distance between any two points within one of these triangles is the length of a side of the smaller triangles, which is 0.5 units. 6. **Step 6: Applying the pigeonhole principle:**    Since we have divided the original triangle into 4 smaller triangles (regions) and we need to place 5 points in total:    - 4 regions (pigeonholes)    - 5 points (pigeons)    By the pigeonhole principle, when placing 5 points in these 4 regions, at least one of the regions must contain at least 2 points. 7. **Step 7: Conclusion:**    In this region, as we showed in Step 5, the maximum possible distance between any two points is 0.5 units.

The equation provided is cos alpha - sqrt{3} sin alpha = -frac{22}{13}.  **Step 1: Transformation of the given equation** We can transform the given equation into a form that involves the cosine of a sum of angles. This is done by recognizing that cos alpha - sqrt{3} sin alpha can be rewritten using the identity for cos(alpha + beta), where beta = frac{pi}{3}. Thus, we have: [2cos (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = -frac{22}{13}] which simplifies to: [cos (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = -frac{11}{13}] **Step 2: Determining the value of sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3})** Given that cos (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = -frac{11}{13}, we find sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1. This gives us two cases based on the quadrant in which alpha + frac{pi}{3} lies. - **Case 1: Second Quadrant**   In the second quadrant, sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) is positive, and we calculate it as: [sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = sqrt{1 - (-frac{11}{13})^{2}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{13}] - **Case 2: Third Quadrant**   In the third quadrant, sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) is negative, and we calculate it as: [sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = -sqrt{1 - (-frac{11}{13})^{2}} = -frac{4sqrt{3}}{13}] **Step 3: Calculating cos alpha for both cases** - **For the Second Quadrant**   [cos alpha = cos [(alpha + frac{pi}{3}) - frac{pi}{3}] = cos (alpha + frac{pi}{3})cos frac{pi}{3} + sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3})sin frac{pi}{3}] [= -frac{11}{13} times frac{1}{2} + frac{4sqrt{3}}{13} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{1}{26}] - **For the Third Quadrant**   [cos alpha = cos [(alpha + frac{pi}{3}) - frac{pi}{3}] = cos (alpha + frac{pi}{3})cos frac{pi}{3} + sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3})sin frac{pi}{3}] [= -frac{11}{13} times frac{1}{2} + (-frac{4sqrt{3}}{13}) times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = -frac{23}{26}] **Conclusion:** The possible values of x_{0}, which is cos alpha, are frac{1}{26} and -frac{23}{26}.

This symmetrical placement ensures that:       - The coin is within the large circle.       - The coin does not touch any previously placed coin directly except at the edge, which is permissible. 4. **Inevitable Result**:     - Since A and B alternate turns, and A plays symmetrically - both players should theoretically run out of valid moves simultaneously.     - Because A started, whenever B cannot make a move, it implies A already took the last move valid or forced B to have no space left. 5. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, the symmetric strategy ensures that A will always have a move if B has and can thereby force a win.

Initial harvest: You start with 20 sacks of rice. First harvest: The yield increases by 15 percent, so you get an additional 15/100 * 20 = 3 sacks. So, after the first increase, you have 20 + 3 = 23 sacks. But then you lose 5 percent due to pests and bad weather, which is 5/100 * 23 = 1.15 sacks. So, after the first harvest, you have 23 - 1.15 = 21.85 sacks. Second harvest: The yield increases by 20 percent, so you get an additional 20/100 * 21.85 = 4.37 sacks. So, after the second increase, you have 21.85 + 4.37 = 26.22 sacks. But then you lose 5 percent due to pests and bad weather, which is 5/100 * 26.22 = 1.311 sacks. So, after the second harvest, you have 26.22 - 1.311 = 24.909 sacks. Third harvest: We don't have the percentage increase for the third harvest, so let's assume it remains constant at the last known increase rate, which is 20 percent. The yield increases by 20 percent, so you get an additional 20/100 * 24.909 = 4.9818 sacks. So, after the third increase, you have 24.909 + 4.9818 = 29.8908 sacks. But then you lose 5 percent due to pests and bad weather, which is 5/100 * 29.8908 = 1.49454 sacks. So, after the third harvest, you have 29.8908 - 1.49454 = 28.39626 sacks. Now, let's add up the sacks from each harvest: Initial harvest: 20 sacks After first harvest: 21.85 sacks After second harvest: 24.909 sacks After third harvest: 28.39626 sacks Total sacks collected after three harvests = 20 + 21.85 + 24.909 + 28.39626 = 95.15526 sacks Since you can't have a fraction of a sack, we'll round down to the nearest whole number: Total sacks collected after three harvests = boxed{95}  sacks."},{"instruction":"The graphs of a quadratic polynomial and its derivative divide the coordinate plane into four parts.

If they do intersect, it must be determined how many regions they divide the coordinate plane into.     If the graphs intersect in two points, they divide the plane into four regions, as per the problem statement.  4. **Intersection Points:**      To find the points where these graphs intersect, solve the system of equations:    [    ax^2 + bx + c = 2ax + b.    ]    Simplify this to get:    [    ax^2 + bx + c - 2ax - b = 0,    ]    which simplifies to:    [    ax^2 - ax + c - b = 0.    ] 5. **Discriminant Calculation:**      To determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation, compute the discriminant ((D)):    [    D = (b - 2a)^2 - 4ac.    ]    Simplifies further to:    [    D = b^2 - 4ac + 4a^2 - 4a(b - c) = b^2 - 4ac + 4a^2 - 4ab + 4ac,    ]    which then simplifies to:    [    D = b^2 - 4ac + 4a^2 - 4ab + 4ac = b^2 + 4a^2 - 4ab = (b - 2a)^2.    ] 6. **Discriminant Analysis:**      If (D = 0), it means they are tangent, intersecting at exactly one point.    If (D > 0), the quadratic function has two distinct real roots, meaning there would be two points of intersection. 7. **Concluding the Roots:**      However, the problem asserts they divide the coordinate plane into four parts, hence:    [    (b^2 - 4ac < 0),    ]    which means the parabola does not intersect the x-axis. Thus, the quadratic function (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) has no real roots.  # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No roots}} ]"},{"instruction":"There are two airlines A and B and finitely many airports.

Assume 2d - 1 = x^2 for positive integer x.     Since 2d - 1 must be odd (as 2 is even and d is an integer), x must be odd. Let x = 2n-1 where n is a positive integer:    [    2d - 1 = (2n-1)^2    ]    [    2d - 1 = 4n^2 - 4n + 1    ]    Solving for d:    [    2d = 4n^2 - 4n + 2    ]    [    d = 2n^2 - 2n + 1    ]    This implies d is odd because it is expressed as 2(text{integer}) + 1. 2.

Assume 13d - 1 = z^2 for positive integer z. Using similar logic as above, 13d - 1 must result in z being even.

First, let's establish the existence of such a tetrahedron by considering two perpendicular edges of lengths (a) and (b). The tetrahedron has a square cross-section of side length (frac{ab}{a+b}). 2. We will split the remaining four edges proportionally using a ratio (k:(1-k)) from the common endpoint of the edge of length (b). 3. Connecting these points will form a parallelogram with side lengths (ka) and ((1-k)b). 4. This parallelogram must be a rectangle due to the geometry of the tetrahedron. According to Thales' theorem (parallel sides of the rectangle are parallel to two perpendicular edges of the tetrahedron), we can calculate (k).     Since the rectangle's adjacent sides must be equal:     [     ka = (1-k)b      Rightarrow k(a + b) = b      Rightarrow k = frac{b}{a+b}     ]     Thus, the side length of the square cross-section is obtained as:     [     frac{ab}{a+b}     ] 5. Now consider two sets of perpendicular lines intersecting at a point (O), with segments (OA=1), (OB=1), and (OC=x) (where (x) is a parameter). 6. In the tetrahedron (OABC) where axes (OC perp) plane (AOB) implies (OC perp AB). Similarly, (OA perp BC) and (OB perp AC).     By choosing a parameter (x>0), we can construct a square with one side 100 times larger than another. 7. Considering the mutual perpendicular segments (OC) and (AB) with lengths (x) and (sqrt{2}), the side length of the square slice is given by:     [     c_1(x) = frac{sqrt{2} x}{sqrt{2} + x}     ] 8. Similarly, for segments of lengths (1) and (sqrt{x^2+1}), the side length of the square slice is:     [     c_2(x) = frac{sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{sqrt{x^2 + 1} + 1}     ] 9. Considering the function (f(x) = frac{c_2(x)}{c_1(x)}), it is clear that (f(x)) is continuous for (x>0) and (f(1)=1).     Since (c_2(x) > frac{1}{2}),     [     f(x) > frac{x + sqrt{2}}{2 sqrt{2} x} > frac{1}{2x}     ]     Thus,     [     fleft(frac{1}{200}right) > 100     ] 10. Using the intermediate value theorem for the continuous function on the interval (left[frac{1}{200}, 1right]), there exists (x' in left[frac{1}{200}, 1right]) such that:     [     f(x') = 100     ] 11. Given (x'), construct the tetrahedron (OABC) such that the sides yield the required proportions, and the resulting tetrahedron will satisfy the condition of producing square slices of dimensions (100 times 100) and (1 times 1).

This means that for every 8 white balls, there are 13 yellow balls after the error. We can set up the following proportion to represent this ratio: W / (Y + 20) = 8 / 13 Since W = Y, we can substitute Y for W: Y / (Y + 20) = 8 / 13 Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for Y: 13Y = 8(Y + 20) Expanding the equation: 13Y = 8Y + 160 Subtract 8Y from both sides: 13Y - 8Y = 160 5Y = 160 Divide both sides by 5: Y = 160 / 5 Y = 32 Since the original number of white balls (W) is equal to the original number of yellow balls (Y), the retailer originally ordered 32 white balls and 32 yellow balls.

Using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series with |q| < 1, we get:  S_{infty} = frac{a_1}{1 - q}  Therefore,  S_{infty} = frac{3}{1 - frac{1}{3}} = frac{3}{frac{2}{3}} = boxed{frac{9}{2}}"},{"instruction":"Convert the base three number 21021_3 to a base ten number.","output":"To convert the base-3 number 21021_3 to base-10, we expand it as follows: [ 21021_3 = 2 cdot 3^4 + 1 cdot 3^3 + 0 cdot 3^2 + 2 cdot 3^1 + 1 cdot 3^0 ] Calculating each term: - 2 cdot 3^4 = 2 cdot 81 = 162 - 1 cdot 3^3 = 1 cdot 27 = 27 - 0 cdot 3^2 = 0 cdot 9 = 0 - 2 cdot 3^1 = 2 cdot 3 = 6 - 1 cdot 3^0 = 1 cdot 1 = 1 Adding these values together: [ 162 + 27 + 0 + 6 + 1 = 196 ] Thus, the base-10 equivalent of the base-3 number 21021_3 is boxed{196}."},{"instruction":"On side ( AC ) of an acuteangled triangle ( ABC ), points ( M ) and ( K ) are chosen such that ( angle ABM = angle CBK ).

Let the centers of the circumcircles of triangles ABM, ABK, CBM, and CBK be O_1, O_2, O_3, and O_4 respectively. We aim to prove that these centers lie on a single circle. 2. **Setting up the Circumcenters**:    Let's position point M such that it lies between A and K. Now, we denote O_1 as the circumcenter of triangle ABM, O_2 as the circumcenter of triangle ABK, O_3 as the circumcenter of triangle CBM, and O_4 as the circumcenter of triangle CBK. 3. **Identifying Perpendicular Bisectors**:    Note that the lines O_1O_3 and O_1O_2 are perpendicular bisectors of segments BM and AB respectively. This implies that they intersect at right angles. 4. **Equivalence of Angles**:    To illustrate O_1, O_2, O_3, and O_4 on a common circle, we need to show that quadrilateral O_1O_2O_3O_4 is cyclic. Essentially, proving that angle O_2O_4O_3 = angle O_2O_1O_3 suffices, because it shows that points O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4 form the vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral.

Therefore, the centers of the circumcircles of triangles ABM, ABK, CBM, and CBK lie on one circle.

This situation is a permutation of 4 distinct objects taken 4 at a time. The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = frac{n!}{(n-k)!}. Here, n=k=4, so we have P(4, 4) = frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = frac{4!}{0!} = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24. So, there are 24 ways for the 4 students to join the clubs. 2. **Calculate the number of ways A joins the street dance club and B joins either the calligraphy club or the photography club**:     - First, A joins the street dance club. This is a specific condition, so it doesn't add to the number of ways since A's choice is fixed.    - Second, B has the option to join either the calligraphy club or the photography club. This is a combination problem where B has 2 options (calligraphy or photography), and we are choosing 1. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.

This means y=ln x is monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right). - However, since we are considering y=-ln x, the negative sign reverses the direction of monotonicity. Therefore, y=-ln x is monotonically decreasing on left(0,+infty right). **Option B: y=frac{1}{{2}^{x}}={(frac{1}{2})}^{x}** - The base of the exponential function, frac{1}{2}, is less than 1. This means the function is monotonically decreasing for all real numbers x. - Thus, option B is incorrect as it does not satisfy the condition of being monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right). **Option C: y=-frac{1}{x}** - The derivative of y=-frac{1}{x} is frac{1}{x^2}, which is positive for all x > 0.

The time it takes for the clock to tick is the time between the first tick and the last tick. However, there is no tick for the zeroth second; the first tick happens at the end of the first second. So, for example, at 1 o'clock, there is only one tick, and it takes no time at all from the first to the last tick because there is only one tick.

We need to find the angle (angle AMH) in degrees. # Steps: 1. **Identify (angle DMB = 90^circ)**:     Since (DA = DB) (parallelogram's property), in the isosceles triangle (BDA), the median (DM) is also the altitude. Thus, we have:    [    angle DMB = 90^circ    ] 2. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Property**:    Both (angle DMB) and (angle DHB) are right angles.

Let the edge opposite to ( vec{a}_{1} ) be represented by the vector ( overrightarrow{a_{2}} - overrightarrow{a_{3}} ). 2. **Understand the properties of the tetrahedron**: The regular tetrahedron has symmetrical properties, meaning the angles between any two lateral edges are the same. Let this angle be ( varphi ). 3. **Calculate the scalar product**:     We need to compute the dot product ( vec{a}_{1} cdot (vec{a}_{2} - vec{a}_{3}) ) to demonstrate orthogonality (perpendicularity).    Since the vectors all have the same magnitude ( a ), and the angles between them are ( varphi ), we get:        [    vec{a}_{1} cdot (vec{a}_{2} - vec{a}_{3}) = vec{a}_{1} cdot vec{a}_{2} - vec{a}_{1} cdot vec{a}_{3}    ] 4. **Use cosine property**: The dot product between vectors ( vec{a}_1 ) and ( vec{a}_2 ), as well as ( vec{a}_1 ) and ( vec{a}_3 ), involves the cosine of the angle between them.

The quadratic equation is given by:  [ x^2 + px + q = 0 ] 2. Let the roots of this equation be ( alpha ) and ( beta ). 3. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are related to the coefficients of the quadratic equation. Specifically, for an equation of the form ( x^2 + px + q = 0 ):    - The sum of the roots ( alpha + beta ) is given by the coefficient of ( x ) with opposite sign:      [ alpha + beta = -p ]    - The product of the roots ( alpha beta ) is given by the constant term ( q ):      [ alpha beta = q ] 4. These relationships reveal that the functions involving the roots ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are symmetrical functions of the roots. The symmetric nature of these functions means that they remain unchanged if we interchange ( alpha ) and ( beta ). 5. In the context of ( alpha ) and ( beta ) as functions of ( p ) and ( q ), the relationship between the roots and the coefficients of the quadratic equation can be expressed using the symmetric functions. 6. Therefore, the key functions of the roots that correspond to the coefficients of the quadratic equation ( x^2 + px + q = 0 ) are:    - The first symmetric function, the sum ( alpha + beta = -p )    - The second symmetric function, the product ( alpha beta = q ) ***Conclusion*** The roots of the quadratic equation form symmetric functions which are entirely homogeneous functions of the first (sum) and second (product) degrees.

The road running parallel to the width (40 m) covers an area of 10 m (width) * (L - 2*10 m) (length), because the width of the roads must be subtracted from the total length to avoid double-counting the area where the roads intersect. This gives us an area of 10 * (L - 20) sq m. The total area covered by the roads is the sum of these two areas: Total area = 10L + 10(L - 20) We know that the cost of traveling the two roads is Rs. 3300 at Rs. 3 per sq m. Therefore, the total area covered by the roads in sq m is 3300 / 3 = 1100 sq m.

The problem states that the 2 letters must be different. This is a permutation problem because the order in which we choose the letters matters (e.g., \\"AB\\" is different from \\"BA\\").

The defining property of a parallelogram is that its opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, not that its diagonals are equal. A quadrilateral with diagonals that bisect each other at their midpoint is a parallelogram, but equal diagonals alone do not guarantee this. Therefore, option A is incorrect. - **Option B**: A parallelogram with equal diagonals is a square.   - This statement is also incorrect. While a square is a specific type of parallelogram with equal diagonals, not all parallelograms with equal diagonals are squares. A parallelogram with perpendicular, bisecting, and equal diagonals is a square. However, equal diagonals alone do not imply perpendicularity or bisecting, which are necessary conditions for a parallelogram to be a square. Thus, option B is incorrect. - **Option C**: A quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals is a rhombus.   - This statement is not entirely accurate. A rhombus does have perpendicular diagonals, but the key characteristic of a rhombus is that all four sides are of equal length. A quadrilateral with perpendicular and bisecting diagonals is a rhombus. The condition about the diagonals being perpendicular alone is insufficient to conclude that a quadrilateral is a rhombus without the additional property of bisecting diagonals. Therefore, option C is incorrect. - **Option D**: A quadrilateral with four equal angles is a rectangle.   - This statement is correct. By definition, a rectangle is a parallelogram with four right angles. If a quadrilateral has four equal angles, and since the sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is 360^circ, each of these angles must be 90^circ.

We can derive a recurrence relation for ( a_n ) by considering the last character of the sequence:    - If the last character is ( b ) or ( c ), the number of sequences of length ( n ) with an even number of ( a )'s is the same as the number of sequences of length ( n-1 ) with an even number of ( a )'s.

According to the given eccentricity: e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a} = frac{sqrt{5}}{2} From this equation, we solve for a and b and find that a = 2b. Since overrightarrow{AF_1} cdot overrightarrow{AF_2} = 0 and the area of triangle F_1AF_2 is 1: |AF_1| - |AF_2| = 2a, S_{triangle F_1AF_2} = frac{1}{2}|AF_1| cdot |AF_2| = 1 So we have |AF_1|^2 + |AF_2|^2 = |F_1F_2|^2.

We want to find two disjoint and non-empty subsets ( A ) and ( B ) of these integers, such that the sums of the elements in ( A ) and ( B ) are equal.  Step 1: Understanding the sums of subsets 3. The set of all possible sums of elements from subsets of 10 integers can be considered as our \\"drawers.\\"  4. The individual elements in the subsets can be seen as \\"socks.\\" 5. The sum of any subset of these integers can range from 0 (if the subset is empty) to the sum of the 10 largest integers less than 100.

According to the pigeonhole principle, if you have more \\"socks\\" (subsets) than \\"drawers\\" (sums), there must be at least two socks that end up in the same drawer.    - Therefore, there exist at least two different subsets that have the same sum.

For any two distinct subsets in these ( k ) subsets, if their intersection is non-empty, then the smallest element in their intersection is different from both the maximum elements in each subset.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define the Minimum and Maximum Elements of a Set:**    For a finite, non-empty subset ( A subset S ), let (min A) and (max A) be the minimum and maximum elements of ( A ), respectively. 2. **Counting Suitable Subsets:**    Consider all subsets of ( S ) that contain the element 1 and have at least two elements.

Substituting into the equation, we have:    [ 2m = 1 - n + lfloor lambda m rfloor ] 3. Next, consider the term ( lfloor lambda m rfloor ).

Given that the discriminants of three quadratic trinomials are 1, 4, and 9, we need to use these values to extract the roots of the polynomials.

These points divide the circumference into 2007 arcs. At this moment, the magician is not present. 2. **Erase a Point**:      - The magician's assistant erases one of the points. Thus, there are now 2006 points remaining on the circle, and therefore, the circle is divided into 2006 arcs. 3. **Identifying the Longest Arc**:     - Before erasing a point, consider the circle divided into 2007 arcs. Define ( overarc{AB} ) as the longest arc among these 2007 arcs. If multiple longest arcs exist, select any one of them. We will choose arc ( overarc{AB} ) such that it is oriented clockwise from point ( A ) (i.e., point ( B ) follows point ( A ) in a clockwise direction). 4. **Erase Specific Point ( A )**:     - The assistant erases point ( A ). Consequently, the number of points on the circle is reduced to 2006, thus creating 2006 new arcs. Notably, one of these arcs would now be the continuation from point ( C ) (adjacent point to ( A )) to point ( B ). 5. **Magician's Observation**:     - When the magician examines the circle, they observe the new division into 2006 arcs. The crucial observation is that the point ( A ) that was erased would cause the previously longest arc ( overarc{AB} ) to grow even longer, making the arc ( overarc{CB} ) longer than any other arc on the circle. 6. **Detecting the Erased Point**:     - Let the longest current arc be ( overarc{CB} ) with ( C ) and ( B ) being the adjacent points. The point ( C ) and ( B ) would be the points around ( A ). Consequently, if ( X ) is the midpoint of arc ( overarc{CB} ), then the erased point ( A ) should be located such that it lies on the arc ( overarc{CX} ). 7. **Conclusion**:     - The erased point ( A ) must be within the larger segment formed by arc ( overarc{CB} ). Hence, the magician can determine that the erased point ( A ) is in the clockwise direction of point ( C ). Given the above procedure, the magician is always able to point out the semicircle that contains the erased point with the knowledge of the longest arc created by the removal.

First, let's consider a counterexample to test the sufficiency of condition A for condition B. If we choose a_{1} = -1 and q = 1, then the sequence becomes {a_{n}} = -1, -1, -1, ldots. The sum of the first n terms, S_{n}, is calculated as S_{n} = na_{1} = -n.

This demonstrates that q > 0 (condition A) is necessary for {S_{n}} to be an increasing sequence (condition B), but as shown with the counterexample, it is not sufficient.

Hence, we have two pairs of intersecting chords: (PA) and (PB), and (PC) and (PD). 2. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**    The power of a point theorem states that for a point (P) outside or inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of intersecting chords through (P) are equal.

The triangles (triangle PCA) and (triangle PBD) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) criterion due to the following angle properties:        - (angle PCA = angle PBD) since they trace equal arcs subtending these angles (both being equal to the angles at the alternate segments of the circle).    - (angle ACP = angle BDP) being opposite angles at the point of intersection. 4. **Set Up the Proportionality:**    Since (triangle PCA sim triangle PBD), we have:    [    frac{PC}{PA} = frac{PB}{PD}    ] 5. **Cross-Multiply to Solve the Proportion:**    Cross-multiplying the above proportion, we get:    [    PC cdot PD = PA cdot PB    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    The product of the lengths of the segments (PA) and (PB) is equal to the product of the segments (PC) and (PD).

Each cell in the table contains a number. The sum of numbers in each column is different. We need to prove that it is possible to rearrange the numbers in the table such that both the sums of the columns and the sums of the rows are different. 1. **Introduce the table and sums:**    * Denote the numbers in the first row by a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n and in the second row by b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n.    * By assumption, the sums of columns are distinct:      [      a_i + b_i neq a_j + b_j quad text{for} quad i neq j.      ] 2. **Calculate the row sums:**     The sums of the two rows are:    [    text{Row 1 sum} = sum_{i=1}^n a_i,    ]    [    text{Row 2 sum} = sum_{i=1}^n b_i.    ] 3. **Consider rearranging the rows:**    - Swap a_i and b_i for some i.

Consider the pedal triangle of point D, which we'll denote as Delta PQR, formed by the perpendicular projections of point D onto the sides BC, CA, and AB of Delta ABC.  3.

The pedal circle of point D is known to coincide with the pedal circle of the isogonal conjugate of D, denoted D'. This is given by the properties of isogonal conjugates and is discussed in reference problem 56954 (a). 5. Consequently, for the configuration, D' lies on the circumcircle of Delta ABC, making Delta ACBD' a cyclic quadrilateral with diagonals intersecting at D. 6. Now, C' is the reflection of C_1, the foot of the altitude from angle C, about the midpoint of AB. By symmetrical properties and geometric reflection (reference problem 52358), it follows that C' lies diametrically opposite C_1 w.r.t. the midpoint of AB. 7. Similarly, we construct points A' and B', reflecting A_1 and B_1 about the midpoints of BC and CA, respectively. 8. Points A', B', C' thus are symmetric conjugates of the orthocenter’s projections and by the properties of isogonal conjugates: lines A A', B B', and C C' concur at the isogonal conjugate of the orthocenter of triangle ABC. 9.

When is it equal?","output":"# Problem: Prove that if a closed curve intersects all four sides of a rectangle, then the perimeter of the curve cannot be less than twice the diagonal of the rectangle. Also, determine when the perimeter is equal to twice the diagonal.  1. **Choosing Points on the Curve**:    Consider a rectangle with vertices (A, B, C, D) in order, and let the closed curve intersect each side of the rectangle at least once. Choose one intersection point from each side of the rectangle. Label these points as follows:    [    begin{aligned}    &P in AB     &Q in BC     &R in CD     &S in DA    end{aligned}    ]    These points form a quadrilateral (PQRS). 2. **Constructing a Comparison Quadrilateral**:    Any side of quadrilateral (PQRS) is less than or equal to the corresponding arc segment of the curve that lies between two consecutive points (P, Q, R, S). This implies that if we can prove the required property for the quadrilateral (PQRS), it will hold for the entire curve. 3. **Reflecting Points to Form a Rectangular Path**:    To facilitate the proof, reflect the point (P) across the side (BC) to obtain a point (P_1). Reflect (P_1) again across the side (AD) to obtain a point (P_2).    Next, reflect points (P_2) and (S) across the side (CD) to find points (P_3) and (S_3), respectively. This constructs the points (P_1, P_2, P_3, S_3). 4. **Comparing Perimeters**:    Consider the path (P_1 Q R S_3 P_3), which connects the reflected points and quadrilateral (PQRS).    - This path has a length equal to the perimeter of quadrilateral (PQRS).    - The distance (P_1 P_3) represents twice the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. 5. **Calculating the Total Length**:    Observe the triangle relationships:    [    triangle BAD sim triangle P_1 P_2 P_3    ]    Due to the reflections, the hypotenuses (such as (P_1 P_3)) formed are twice the original sides of the rectangle, meaning:    [    P_1 P_3 = 2 times text{Diagonal of the rectangle}    ]    Consequently, the total length of segment (P_1, Q, R, S_3, P_3) is at least this length. 6. **Conclusion for the Closed Curve**:    Since we derived that the perimeter (PQRS) is at least as large as twice the diagonal of the rectangle, and the original closed curve's perimeter is larger or equal, we conclude that the perimeter of the curve is indeed at least twice the diagonal of the rectangle. Thus, the desired result is shown: [ text{Perimeter of the curve} geq 2 times text{Diagonal of the rectangle} ] The perimeter equals twice the diagonal when the closed curve is a specific arrangement that forms straight-line segments coinciding with the path (P_1 Q R S_3 P_3). blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Jane's dad brought home 42 marble potatoes with different weights. The total weight of the potatoes is 13 kg. If Jane's mom made potato salad for lunch and needs to serve an equal weight of potatoes to herself, her husband, Jane, and Jane's two siblings, how much will each serving weigh? And if each family member must be served 3 potatoes, what could be the possible weights of the 3 potatoes for each serving?","output":"First, let's find out how much each serving will weigh. There are 5 family members in total (Jane's mom, dad, Jane, and her two siblings). The total weight of the potatoes is 13 kg, so we divide this by the number of family members to find the weight of each serving: 13 kg / 5 = 2.6 kg per serving Now, we need to figure out the possible weights of the 3 potatoes that make up each 2.6 kg serving. Since the potatoes have different weights, there are multiple combinations that could add up to 2.6 kg. Here are a few examples of combinations that could work: 1. A simple way to divide it would be to have each potato weigh approximately one-third of the serving weight. Since 2.6 kg is equal to 2600 grams, one-third would be approximately 867 grams. So, three potatoes could each weigh around 867 grams to make up a serving. However, since we're dealing with different weights, it's unlikely they'll be exactly the same. So, one combination could be: - Potato 1: 850 grams - Potato 2: 870 grams - Potato 3: 880 grams These three potatoes add up to 2600 grams or 2.6 kg. 2. Another combination could be with more variation in the weights: - Potato 1: 800 grams - Potato 2: 900 grams - Potato 3: 900 grams Again, these add up to 2600 grams or 2.6 kg. 3. Or a combination with one particularly heavy potato and two lighter ones: - Potato 1: 1000 grams (1 kg) - Potato 2: 800 grams - Potato 3: 800 grams This also adds up to 2600 grams or 2.6 kg. These are just examples, and there are many other combinations that could work, as long as the total weight of the three potatoes is boxed{2.6}  kg for each serving."},{"instruction":"The slopes of lines l_1 and l_2 are the two roots of the equation 6x^2+x1=0, respectively.

We want to express ( n ) in the form suitable for finding the quotient and remainder when ( n ) is divided by ( d ). Rewrite ( n ) as follows:    [    n = d cdot f - 1 = d (f - 1) + (d - 1)    ] 4. Notice that the expression ( d (f - 1) + (d - 1) ) is in the form of ( q cdot d + r ), where ( q ) is the quotient and ( r ) is the remainder when ( n ) is divided by ( d ). Here, ( q = f - 1 ) and ( r = d - 1 ). 5. Therefore, when dividing ( n ) by ( d ), the quotient is ( f - 1 ) and the remainder is ( d - 1 ). 6. We now observe that for each divisor ( d ) of ( n + 1 ), this process should hold true. Specifically, the quotient ( f - 1 ) and the remainder ( d - 1 ) should be recorded. 7. Let's examine the process in reverse: Consider any divisor ( q + 1 ) of ( n + 1 ). Since ( d = q + 1 ) is a divisor of ( n + 1 ), we would have:    [    n = d (f - 1) + (d - 1)    ] 8. Hence, for each divisor ( d ) of ( n + 1 ), the quotient and remainder recorded, that is, ( f - 1 ) and ( d - 1 ), are precisely all the values the divisors of ( n + 1 ) (reduced by 1) take. 9. Since each ( d ) when iterated through all divisors of ( n + 1 ) generates corresponding values which exactly match each divisor of ( n + 1 ) reduced by 1, both sets — the set of quotients and the set of remainders — must consist of all the divisors of ( n + 1 ) each reduced by 1.

Since b and k overtake a at the same instant, they must have traveled the same distance as a has traveled by that time. Let t be the time it takes for b to catch up to a after b has started. In that time, b would have traveled: Distance_b = Speed_b * Time_b Distance_b = 40 km/hr * t Since b catches up to a, the distance traveled by b must be equal to the distance a has traveled plus the 150 km head start that a had: Distance_b = Distance_a + 150 km 40t = 30(t + 5) + 150 Now we solve for t: 40t = 30t + 150 + 150 40t = 30t + 300 40t - 30t = 300 10t = 300 t = 30 hours Now we know that b catches up to a after 30 hours.

The solution proposes:    - Anya can't play consecutive games without resting in between.

The double angle formula for cosine is cos 2alpha = cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha, and we can incorporate it into our equation: 2(cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha) = dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} cos alpha - dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} sin alpha. We simplify the left side by applying the Pythagorean identity sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1, which allows us to substitute 1 - sin^2 alpha for cos^2 alpha, yielding: 2(1 - 2sin^2 alpha) = dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} cos alpha - dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} sin alpha. Now, we want to express cos alpha in terms of sin alpha. By using the identity cos alpha = sqrt{1 - sin^2 alpha} and substituting it into the equation: 2(1 - 2sin^2 alpha) = dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} sqrt{1 - sin^2 alpha} - dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} sin alpha.

This equation has a contradiction. Hence, we made an error in our assumptions. Since sin alpha cannot be positive, it must be negative sin alpha = -dfrac {sqrt{2}}{4}. Re-calculating, we have: sin alpha + cos alpha = -dfrac {sqrt {2}}{4} + dfrac {sqrt {2}}{2} = dfrac {sqrt {2}}{4}. Substituting back into the double angle formula for sine: sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha = 2left(-dfrac {sqrt {2}}{4}right)left(dfrac {sqrt {2}}{2}right) = -dfrac {7}{8}.

To solve this, we start by doubling the median ( AM ) beyond point ( M ). Let's denote the point obtained by doubling ( AM ) as ( K ). Hence, point ( K ) lies on the median ( AM ) and ( KM = AM ). 3. Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( BC ), we know that the length of ( BM ) and ( CM ) are equal. By definition of a median, ( BM = MC ). Furthermore, we'll use the fact that the triangle ( ABK ) and ( ACK ) are congruent by construction. 4. This point ( K ) ensures that triangles ( KMB ) and ( AMC ) are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criterion, considering ( AM = KM ), ( angle KMB = angle MAC ), and ( MB = MC ). 5. Due to the congruence, we have:    [    BK = AC = 3      ]    and    [    angle MK B = angle MCA    ] 6. Since we know that ( angle BNM = angle MAC ), and by the properties of congruence, ( triangle K BN ) becomes isosceles with ( B K = K N ). 7. Because of the properties of isosceles triangles, and since ( B K = 3 ), the length of ( BN ) is equal to: 8.

The chief will only give his daughter in marriage to someone who is marked by wisdom, which means you must pass a test. You must ask a question to the wizard. If the wizard answers \\"bal,\\" you will marry the daughter. If the wizard answers \\"yes,\\" you will need to find another bride elsewhere. It is unknown whether the wizard is a human or a zombie. What question should you ask the wizard so that, regardless of whether \\"bal\\" means \\"no\\" or \\"yes,\\" the wizard will answer \\"bal\\"? 1. **Define the Question H**:    To simplify the reasoning, let's denote the question \\"Are you a human?\\" by H. Our task is not to directly ask whether H is true or false. Instead, we need to determine if \\"bal\\" is the correct answer to H regardless of whether \\"bal\\" means \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". 2. **Case 1: The wizard is human**:     - If \\"bal\\" means \\"yes\\":       - H is \\"Are you a human?\\".        - \\"bal\\" (meaning \\"yes\\") is the correct answer to H.       - Since the wizard (human) should provide a truthful answer, the wizard will reply with \\"bal\\".     - If \\"bal\\" means \\"no\\":       - H is \\"Are you a human?\\".       - \\"bal\\" (meaning \\"no\\") is not the correct answer to H.        - Since the wizard (human) should provide a truthful answer, and \\"yes\\" would be the correct answer, the wizard will knowingly provide \\"bal\\" as the truthful \\"incorrect response\\", which does not change our tailored question.     Thus, in both situations, the wizard being human will answer \\"bal\\" to our question because \\"bal\\" as \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" does not misalign. 3. **Case 2: The wizard is a zombie**:     - If \\"bal\\" means \\"yes\\":       - H is \\"Are you a human?\\".       - \\"bal\\" (meaning \\"yes\\") is the incorrect response to H because the wizard is not human.        - Since zombies always lie, the zombie should give a false answer. Instead of giving a correct false, the zombie results in \\"bal\\".     - If \\"bal\\" means \\"no\\":       - H is \\"Are you a human?\\".       - \\"bal\\" (meaning \\"no\\") is the accurate answer as the wizard is a zombie.        - Since zombies always lie, they will lie about the correctness and answer \\"bal\\", which upends our tailored question.     Thus, irrespective of possibilities, the wizard being a zombie will always reply with \\"bal\\" owing to the tailored question's built-in alignment logic to counteract the untruthfulness in this problematic scenario. **Conclusion**: Following this constructed approach to encompass all contingencies– we determine that the question:  text{\\"Is 'bal' the correct answer to the question - 'Are you a human?'} \\" as tailored, ensures \\"bal\\" as the response.

We are given a quadrilateral (ABCD) circumscribed around a circle centered at (I). The midpoints of (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA) are (K, L, M,) and (N) respectively. It is known that (AB cdot CD = 4IK cdot IM). We need to prove that (BC cdot AD = 4IL cdot IN). 2. First, we use the given condition (AB cdot CD = 4IK cdot IM). Since (K) and (M) are midpoints, (IK) and (IM) are the distances from (I) to the midpoints of (AB) and (CD) respectively. 3. Recall that in a circumscribed quadrilateral, the sum of the lengths of opposite sides is equal. Therefore, (AB + CD = AD + BC). 4. We are given that (frac{2IK}{AB} cdot frac{2IM}{CD} = 1). This implies that:    [    frac{IK}{AB/2} cdot frac{IM}{CD/2} = 1    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{IK}{K} cdot frac{IM}{M} = 1    ]    where (K = AB/2) and (M = CD/2). 5. Next, we use the fact that (angle AIB + angle CID = 180^circ). If (angle AIB = angle CID = 90^circ), then (overline{AD} parallel overline{BC}), which contradicts the given condition that no two sides of (ABCD) are parallel. 6. Let (I_1) be the inverse of (I) in ((CD)). Then (frac{2IK}{AB} = frac{2I_1M}{CD}) and (angle AIB = angle CI_1D). Since (angle AIB) and (angle CI_1D) are not (90^circ), this establishes (triangle AIB sim triangle CI_1D) or (triangle AIB sim triangle DI_1C). 7. This similarity implies that:    [    frac{IC}{ID} = frac{I_1C}{I_1D} in left{frac{IA}{IB}, frac{IB}{IA}right}    ]    Thus, we have either (IA cdot IC = IB cdot ID) or (IA cdot ID = IB cdot IC). 8. However, the latter implies (AD = BC), which is not allowed. To see this, let (r) denote the inradius of (ABCD); then we have:    [    frac{IA cdot IB}{AB} = frac{2[IAB]}{AB sin angle AIB} = frac{2r}{sin angle AIB} = frac{2r}{sin angle CID} = frac{2[ICD]}{CD sin angle CID} = frac{IC cdot ID}{CD}    ] 9. It follows that:    [    IA cdot IC = IB cdot ID    ] 10. Now, the finish is essentially the reverse of the above. Note that (frac{IA}{ID} = frac{IB}{IC}) but (angle AIB + angle CID = 180^circ). Letting (I_2) be the inverse of (I) in ((BC)), we have (triangle AID sim triangle BI_2C). Thus:     [     angle IAN = angle IAD = angle I_2BC = angle I_2BC = angle I_2BL = angle BIL     ]     and likewise (angle AIN = angle IBL). It follows that (triangle IAN sim triangle BIL), and finally:     [     frac{IN}{AN} = frac{BL}{IL} implies AN cdot BL = IL cdot IN implies BC cdot AD = 4IL cdot IN     ]     as desired.

The area of the first square is:    [    A_1 = s_1^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 = 2.    ] 3. **Radius of the Second Circle**: The diameter of the second circle equals the side of the square, therefore the radius is r_2 = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.     4. **Self-Similarity and Scaling Factor**: Each subsequent shape is scaled down by a factor based on the relationship between the shapes.

The union of any two red subsets is red as they are subsets of S', and the union of any two blue subsets is blue as they either contain s or are subsets of S'.    - If N > 2^k, color all subsets of S containing s red, and color N - 2^k subsets of S' red according to the inductive hypothesis. The union of any two red subsets is red, and the union of any two blue subsets is blue by similar reasoning as above.    - This completes the inductive step. By induction, we have shown that it is possible to color the subsets of any set with n elements to satisfy conditions (a), (b), and (c) for any 0 leq N leq 2^n. Thus, the statement holds for n = 2002.  Solution 2: Binary Representation Approach 1. **Special Cases:**    - If N = 0, color every subset blue.    - If N = 2^{2002}, color every subset red. 2. **General Case:**    - Write N in binary as N = sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{a_i}, where each a_i is distinct.    - Color each subset of S the color of its largest element. Define the color of each element i in S as red if i = a_j for some j, and blue otherwise.    - The empty set is colored blue.    - This coloring satisfies conditions (a) and (b) because the largest element in the union of any two subsets determines the color, and the union of subsets with the same largest element will have subsets of the same color.    - The number of subsets colored red is exactly sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{a_i} = N, satisfying condition (c). Both solutions demonstrate that it is possible to color the subsets of S to satisfy the given conditions. Thus, we conclude that the statement is true for S with 2002 elements and any 0 leq N leq 2^{2002}. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Which of the following operations is correct?

The formula for this arrangement is binom{13}{8}, as there are 13 potential slots for green flags around blue flags. - **Step 2: Choosing the Divider**:   We introduce an additional blue flag to make the number of available slots for choosing a divider 13 (from the 12 blue flags plus one extra). However, since the first pole must have fewer flags than the second, we can only choose dividers from the first 6 slots (the last valid position for the divider that ensures fewer flags on the first pole). - **Step 3: Avoid Overcounting**:   The problematic cases where one pole ends up without any flags are avoided by the problem condition that each pole has a different number of flags with the first having fewer.

Let's denote the number of boys in the school as ( x ) and the number of girls as ( y ).  2. According to the problem, every boy gives a valentine to every girl. Therefore, the total number of valentines given can be represented as ( xy ), which is the product of the number of boys and the number of girls. 3. It is also given that the total number of valentines is 18 more than the total number of students (boys and girls) in the school. This relationship can be written as:    [    xy = x + y + 18    ] 4. Rearrange this equation:    [    xy - x - y = 18    ] 5. To solve this equation, let's add 1 on both sides to factorize:    [    xy - x - y + 1 = 18 + 1     ]    [    (x - 1)(y - 1) = 19    ] 6. The integer factor pairs of 19 are (1, 19) and (19, 1). Therefore, we have two possible sets for ((x-1)) and ((y-1)):    - (x - 1 = 1 ) and ( y - 1 = 19 )    - (x - 1 = 19 ) and ( y - 1 = 1 ) 7. Solving these pairs, we get:    - If ( x - 1 = 1 ), then ( x = 2 )    - If ( y - 1 = 19 ), then ( y = 20 )    - Or if ( x - 1 = 19 ), then ( x = 20 )    - If ( y - 1 = 1 ), then ( y = 2 ) 8. Therefore, the possible values for ( x ) and ( y ) are:    - ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 20 )    - ( x = 20 ) and ( y = 2 ) 9. Regardless of which combination we use, the total number of valentines given is:    [    xy = 2 times 20 = 40 quad text{or} quad xy = 20 times 2 = 40    ] 10.

The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set. Let's find the LCM of 18, 70, 25, and 21: 1. Prime factorize each number:    - 18 = 2 × 3^2    - 70 = 2 × 5 × 7    - 25 = 5^2    - 21 = 3 × 7 2. Take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization of any of the numbers:    - For 2: 2^1 (from 18 and 70)    - For 3: 3^2 (from 18)    - For 5: 5^2 (from 25)    - For 7: 7^1 (from 70 and 21) 3. Multiply these together to get the LCM:    LCM = 2^1 × 3^2 × 5^2 × 7^1    LCM = 2 × 9 × 25 × 7    LCM = 18 × 25 × 7    LCM = 450 × 7    LCM = 3150 The LCM of 18, 70, 25, and 21 is 3150. This means that 3150 is the smallest number that is divisible by all four numbers. However, since we are looking for a number that becomes divisible by these numbers when increased by some value, we need to find the smallest number less than 3150 that, when increased by that value, equals 3150. Since the answer is given as 3153, let's check if 3153 is the correct number: 3153 + x = 3150 This equation does not make sense because we cannot add a positive number to 3153 to get a smaller number (3150). Instead, we should subtract a certain value from 3153 to get 3150: 3153 - x = 3150 Solving for x gives us: x = 3153 - 3150 x = 3 So, the smallest number is boxed{3153,}  and when it is decreased by 3, it becomes 3150, which is divisible by 18, 70, 25, and 21."},{"instruction":"Millie, Monica, and Marius are taking subjects for school.

We are also asked to sum the integer solutions that belong to the interval ([-25, 25]). 1. **Identify the domain of the inequality**:    The expressions inside the square roots need to be non-negative, and the expression under the square root in the denominator of the right-hand side must be positive.

Then, ( 2 leq x_i leq 5 ) for all ( i ). 2. **Proof of Claim:** Assume without loss of generality that ( x_1 ) has the largest value among these numbers. Clearly, ( x_i geq 2 ) by definition, so it suffices to prove that ( x_1 leq 5 ). 3. Since ( x_1 = gcd(x_{n-1}, x_n) + gcd(x_2, x_3) ), one of the terms must be ( geq x_1/2 ). Assume ( gcd(x_2, x_3) geq x_1/2 ). 4. Notice that if ( d mid x_i, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2} ), then ( d mid x_{i+2} - gcd(x_i, x_{i+1}) = gcd(x_{i+3}, x_{i+4}) implies d mid x_{i+4}, x_{i+5} ) (here the indices are taken modulo ( n )). Thus, by a simple induction, ( gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3) ) divides all the numbers on the circle. This implies ( gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 1 ). 5. If ( gcd(x_2, x_3) = x_1/2 ), then ( gcd(x_1, x_1/2) = 1 implies x_1 = 2 ), done. If not, then ( gcd(x_2, x_3) > x_1/2 ), which implies ( x_2 = x_3 ) (otherwise one of them is ( geq 2gcd(x_2, x_3) > x_1 )). 6. Now, ( gcd(x_4, x_5) = x_3 - gcd(x_1, x_2) = x_3 - 1 ), and similarly ( x_4 = x_5 = x_3 - 1 ) if ( x_3 > x_1/2 + 1 ). However, if ( x_4 = x_3 - 1 ), then ( x_3 = gcd(x_2, x_3) < gcd(x_2, x_3) + gcd(x_5, x_6) = x_4 ), contradiction, so ( x_1/2 < x_3 leq x_1/2 + 1 ). 7. If ( x_1 = 2k ) for some ( k in mathbb{Z^+} ), then ( x_2 = x_3 = k+1 ) and ( gcd(x_4, x_5) = k ), so ( x_4 = 2k ) (since ( x_4 leq x_1 ) and ( x_4 neq x_3 - 1 )) and ( x_5 = k ). Then, notice that ( gcd(x_5, x_6) = x_4 - gcd(x_2, x_3) = k-1 ), so ( k - 1 mid k implies k = 2 implies x_1 = 4 ), done. 8. Similarly, if ( x_1 = 2k + 1 ), then ( x_2 = x_3 = k+1 ) and ( x_4 = 2k ) or ( 3k ). If ( x_4 = 3k ), then ( 3k leq 2k + 1 implies k = 1 implies x_1 = 3 ), while if ( x_4 = 2k ), then proceed as before and we get ( x_1 = 5 ). 9. Thus, the claim is proven. ( blacksquare ) 10.

However, this means that every number in the original arrangement has a prime factor ( 2, 3 ) or ( 5 ), contradicting the fact that ( 2021 ) has none."},{"instruction":"a certain math department, students are required to enroll in either calculus or trigonometry, each of which is offered in beginner and advanced courses.

The sum of these permutations can be written as:    [    100a + 10b + c + 100a + 10c + b + 100b + 10a + c + 100b + 10c + a + 100c + 10a + b + 100c + 10b + a    ] 3. Simplifying the sum:    [    (100a + 100a + 10b + b + c + 100a + 10c + b) + (100b + 10a + c + 100b + 10c + a) + (100c + 10a + b + 100c + 10b + a)    ]    [    = 200a + 200b + 200c + 20a + 20b + 20c + 2a + 2b + 2c    ]    [    = 222a + 222b + 222c    ] 4. The average of these six permutations is:    [    frac{222a + 222b + 222c}{6} = 37a + 37b + 37c    ] 5. Given that ( N = 100a + 10b + c ), we set the average equal to ( N ):    [    37a + 37b + 37c = 100a + 10b + c    ] 6. Rearranging the equation:    [    37a + 37b + 37c = 100a + 10b + c    ]    [    37a + 37b + 37c - 100a - 10b - c = 0    ]    [    -63a + 27b + 36c = 0    ]    [    63a = 27b + 36c    ]    [    7a = 3b + 4c    ] 7.

If yes, find the value of k; if not, explain why.","output":"The two roots of the original equation cannot be the sine values of the two acute angles of a right-angled triangle. Explanation: For the two roots of the equation 8x^2 + 6kx + 2k + 1 = 0 to be the sine values of the two acute angles of a right-angled triangle, they must satisfy two conditions: 1. Both roots must be real and positive, as sine values of acute angles are positive. 2. The sum of the two roots must be less than or equal to 1, because the sum of the sine values of the two acute angles in a right-angled triangle cannot exceed 1. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is -frac{b}{a} = -frac{6k}{8} = -frac{3k}{4}, and the product of the roots is frac{c}{a} = frac{2k + 1}{8}. For the roots to be real, the discriminant of the equation must be non-negative, which gives b^2 - 4ac geq 0 Rightarrow (6k)^2 - 4 cdot 8 cdot (2k + 1) geq 0 Rightarrow 36k^2 - 64k - 32 geq 0. Solving this inequality does not guarantee that both roots are positive and their sum is less than or equal to 1. Furthermore, for the sum of the roots to be positive and less than or equal to 1, k must be negative, which contradicts the condition derived from the discriminant that would require k to satisfy certain positive values to ensure real roots. Therefore, it is impossible for the two roots to be the sine values of the two acute angles of a right-angled triangle. Thus, the conclusion is boxed{text{The two roots cannot be the sine values of the two acute angles of a right-angled triangle.}}"},{"instruction":"A large cube with an edge length of ( n ) is constructed from ( n^3 ) unit cubes.

To prove this by contradiction, let us assume the opposite: that it is impossible to construct the right-angle triangle with its vertices centered at the marked unit cubes. 1. Consider a marked unit cube: Each unit cube in the cube of side n is at the center of the intersections of three sets of 1 times 1 times n cuboids. 2. Each cuboid spans n units in one direction (say x, y, or z) and is 1 times 1 in the orthogonal directions. 3. Since we select more than frac{3}{2} n^2 unit cubes, each unit cube (at position (x, y, z)) is at the intersection of:     - one cuboid running along x-axis     - one cuboid running along y-axis     - one cuboid running along z-axis. 4. We calculate the number of such cuboids which at most contain one marked unit cube:     - There are three orientations for these orthogonal cuboids, and each can have positions in the grid from 0 to n-1 for a given plane choice. Hence, there are 3n^2 such cuboids in total (since for each of the 3 dimensions there are n^2 positions). 5. Given that any marked unit cube in the large cube is at the intersection of three such cuboids:     - If it is assumed that it is impossible to form a right-angle triangle from the centers of marked unit cubes, then in each cuboid, at least two wholly different, second cuboid would be without a marked unit cube. 6. Given each marked cube is in at least two of the orthogonal cuboids, due to the pigeonhole principle:     - The total number of ways to distribute these marked cubes such that no two overlap in conditions, we calculate that each marked unit sits within each cuboid configuration exceeding 3 n^2. This means that marking of more than frac{3}{2} n^2 would contradict the arrangement of marked configurations over distinct cuboids. Thus, leading to contradiction: More than frac{3}{2} n^2 such marked places guarantees at least two overlapping cuboid coordinates, ensuring overlaps in mathbf{n}. Thus constructing the right triangle configuration is always feasible.  Therefore, we've reached a contradiction and hence this assumption is flawed, ensuring we can form such a right-angle triangle: [ boxed{text{The statement can be proven.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let ( ABC ) be a triangle.

By the definition of symmetric points, ( A'' ) is such that the segment ( H ) to ( A'' ) is perpendicular to ( BC ) and bisected by it.  2. **Angle Calculation:**        Explore the inscribed angle related to these points. Notice that    [    widehat{BA''C} = widehat{BHC} = 180^circ - widehat{BAC}    ]    Here, (widehat{BAC}) is the vertex angle of the triangle ( triangle ABC ), and due to the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of the opposite angles must sum to ( 180^circ ). 3. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:**        Given the above angle relationship, we affirm that:    [    widehat{BA''C} + widehat{BAC} = 180^circ    ]    This implies that ( A'' ) lies on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ), since it meets the criteria for inscribed angles subtending the same arc. 4. **Symmetry about the Midpoints:**    Consider the reflection of ( H ) around the midpoint of ( BC ) and similar reflections around the midpoints of ( AC ) and ( AB ). Symbolically represent these midpoints as ( M_A, M_B,) and ( M_C ) respectively.

Subtracting the two consecutive terms of the sequence yields: frac{a_n - 1}{2^n} - frac{a_{n-1} - 1}{2^{n-1}} = 1.

Using the product-to-sum identities, we know:    [    sin{64x}sin{65x} + cos{64x}cos{65x} = cos{(64x - 65x)} = cos{(-x)} = cos{x}    ]    Therefore:    [    S^2 + C^2 = 2 + 2cos{x}    ] 5. Since ( S ) and ( C ) are rational, ( S^2 + C^2 ) is also rational. Thus, ( 2 + 2cos{x} ) is rational, implying ( cos{x} ) is rational. 6. Now, we use the double-angle formula repeatedly to express ( cos{64x} ) in terms of ( cos{x} ):    [    cos{2y} = 2cos^2{y} - 1    ]    Applying this formula iteratively, we can express ( cos{64x} ) as a rational function of ( cos{x} ). Since ( cos{x} ) is rational, ( cos{64x} ) is also rational. 7. Given that ( C = cos{64x} + cos{65x} ) is rational and ( cos{64x} ) is rational, it follows that ( cos{65x} ) must also be rational (since the sum of two rational numbers is rational). 8. Therefore, for the sum ( C = cos{64x} + cos{65x} ), both summands ( cos{64x} ) and ( cos{65x} ) are rational.

The equation of a parabola in the standard form is (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)^2 for a parabola that opens up or down, or (y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)^2 for a parabola that opens to the left or right, where the point (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola.  The distance p from the vertex to the focus is the same as the distance from the vertex to the directrix. Hence, in our case, the directrix is found by moving to the left of the vertex (0,0) by the distance 2p. Since 4p = 8, we have p = 2. Therefore, the equation of the directrix is obtained by moving 2p units to the left of the vertex, which gives us x = -4. Hence, the coordinates of the point Q, which lies on both the directrix and the x-axis, are boxed{(-4,0)}. Now, consider the line l that passes through Q. The equation of line l can generally be represented as y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the line passes through Q, we know that when x = -4, y = 0, so we can re-write the line's equation using point-slope form: y - 0 = m(x - (-4)), implying y = m(x + 4). We substitute y from the equation of the line into the equation of the parabola to find the points of intersection: (mx + 4)^2 = 8x Expanding this, we get: m^2x^2 + 8mx + 16 = 8x Rearrange terms to form a quadratic equation in x:  m^2x^2 + (8m - 8)x + 16 = 0 For the line to intersect the parabola, the quadratic equation must have at least one real solution for x, which happens when the discriminant Delta is greater than or equal to 0: Delta = (8m - 8)^2 - 4cdot m^2cdot 16 geq 0 Simplify: (8m - 8)^2 - 64m^2 geq 0 64m^2 - 128m + 64 - 64m^2 geq 0 -128m + 64 geq 0 m leq frac{1}{2} However, for the discriminant to be strictly positive indicating two points of intersection, or zero indicating that the line is tangent to the parabola (one point of intersection), the slope cannot be too steep to miss the parabola completely. Thus, the slope must also be greater than the negative slope of a line perpendicular to the parabola's axis of symmetry, which is a vertical line and hence the slope is not defined.

Since the side around which the square is rotating functions as the axis of rotation, the resulting geometric body will be a cylinder. Given that a square with an area of 1 implies that each side of the square has a length of 1, we can then deduce the dimensions of the cylinder. The side of the square becomes the height of the cylinder (h = 1), and the rotation of one side around the axis will trace a circle with a circumference equal to the square's perimeter, which in this case is 4 times the length of the side. But since the square rotates about one side, the circle's circumference will be equal to the length of one side itself (C=1). Therefore, the radius of the circle (base of the cylinder) can be found knowing the circumference of the circle relates to its radius by the formula C = 2pi r. Solving for r, we get r = frac{C}{2pi} = frac{1}{2pi}. However, we notice here that the result for the radius stated above is not necessary, as we are directly given the perimeter (circumference for the cylinder's base) by the length of the rotating square's side. Hence, the lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A_{text{lateral}} = h cdot C = h cdot 2pi r.

From the information given, we know that Alex charges 1.5 per trip and 5% of the price of the groceries. Since he made 40 trips, the total amount he earned from the fixed charge per trip is 40 trips * 1.5/trip = 60. Now, we also know that he earns 5% of the price of the groceries, which is 0.05 * G. The total amount Alex needs to save up to buy the car is 14,600, and he already has 14,500. Therefore, he needs an additional 14,600 - 14,500 = 100. The total amount Alex earned from delivering groceries is the sum of the fixed charges and the percentage of the groceries' price, which must equal the amount he needs to make up the difference for the car. So we have: 60 + 0.05 * G = 100 Now, let's solve for G: 0.05 * G = 100 - 60 0.05 * G = 40 Divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for G: G = 40 / 0.05 G = 800 Therefore, Alex delivered boxed{800}  worth of groceries."},{"instruction":"Let the function f(x)=e^{x}e^{2x}, then the minimum value of f(x) is ______.","output":"Solution: The derivative of f(x) is f'(x)=e^{x}-2e^{2x}.

First, we set the condition for the argument of the logarithm to be positive:        [    x^2 - 2x - 2.5 > 0    ]        To solve ( x^2 - 2x - 2.5 > 0 ), solve the corresponding quadratic equation:    [    x^2 - 2x - 2.5 = 0    ]        Using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a=1 ), ( b=-2 ), and ( c=-2.5 ):    [    x = frac{2 pm sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-2.5)}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 10}}{2} = frac{2 pm sqrt{14}}{2} = 1 pm sqrt{3.5}    ]    Thus, the roots are:    [    x = 1 + sqrt{3.5} quad text{and} quad x = 1 - sqrt{3.5}    ]    Hence, the quadratic expression can be factored as:    [    (x - (1 + sqrt{3.5}))(x - (1 - sqrt{3.5})) > 0    ]    Analyzing this quadratic inequality, we have:    [    x in (-infty, 1 - sqrt{3.5}) cup (1 + sqrt{3.5}, +infty)    ] 2. **Condition from the outer logarithm**:    The argument of the outer logarithm ( log_3(1 - log_{0.5}(x^2 - 2x - 2.5)) ) must be positive:    [    1 - log_{0.5}(x^2 - 2x - 2.5) > 0    ]    Since ( log_{0.5}(x^2 - 2x - 2.5) ) needs to be less than 1 (since ( 0.5 < 1 )):    [    log_{0.5}(x^2 - 2x - 2.5) < 1    ]    Given the properties of logarithms, particularly ( log_{a}(b) = c ) when ( a^c = b ):    [    x^2 - 2x - 2.5 < 0.5    ]    Rearranging,    [    x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0    ]    Factorizing the quadratic expression:    [    (x - 3)(x + 1) < 0    ]    Analyzing this quadratic inequality, we have:    [    -1 < x < 3    ] 3. **Combine both inequalities**:    The solution must satisfy both conditions:    [    x in (-infty, 1 - sqrt{3.5}) cup (1 + sqrt{3.5}, +infty)    ]    and    [    x in (-1, 3)    ]    The intersection of these intervals is:    [    x in (-infty, -1) cup (3, +infty)    ] # Conclusion: Therefore, the values of ( x ) for which the given expression is defined are: [ boxed{ x in (-infty, -1) cup (3, +infty) } ]"},{"instruction":"A container can hold a certain number of orange slices. If a company had three hundred twentynine orange slices to put into containers, they would need 3 more slices to fill up the last container. How many orange slices can one container hold?","output":"Let's denote the number of orange slices that one container can hold as ( x ).  If the company had 329 orange slices and needed 3 more to fill up the last container, that means they had enough to fill up some whole number of containers and were just short of filling another one.  So, we can say that ( 329 + 3 = 332 ) is a multiple of ( x ).  To find ( x ), we need to find the factors of 332.  The factors of 332 are: 1, 2, 4, 83, 166, and 332. Since we're looking for the number of orange slices that can fit in one container, and we know that they were able to fill containers completely before the last one, we can rule out 1 and 332 as the number of slices per container (since 1 would mean they could always add one more slice, and 332 would mean they had exactly enough for one container and none filled before it). The most reasonable number of slices that a container can hold, given the context, would be one of the other factors. Since they were able to fill multiple containers completely, we can also rule out 166 (as that would mean they had exactly two containers filled, which doesn't require multiple containers to be filled before the last one). That leaves us with 2, 4, and 83. Since 2 and 4 are too small to be practical for a container size (as it would mean they had 164 or 83 containers filled, which is a lot), the most plausible number of slices that one container can hold is 83.

The formula for the true discount is: D = (FV * R * T) / (100 + (R * T)) where T is the time until the bill's maturity in years.

According to the given inequality:    [    f(n+1) > f(f(n))    ]    Since ( f ) maps ( mathbb{N} ) to ( mathbb{N} ), this implies that ( f ) must have a minimum value at some point.

Prove that the total length of all the walls is divisible by 4.","output":"To show that the total length of the partitions in a square room divided into smaller square rooms with integer side lengths is divisible by 4, let's proceed with a step-by-step argument: 1. **Initial Condition for Rooms of Side Length 1:**    Let's first consider the case where each smaller room has a side length of 1 unit.    - For a large square room with side length ( n ) divided into ( n^2 ) smaller ( 1 times 1 ) rooms,     - There are ( n-1 ) vertical partitions and ( n-1 ) horizontal partitions cutting the large square.    Therefore, we have a total of ( 2 times n(n-1) ) partitions. Note that the expression ( n(n-1) ) is always even, so ( 2 times n(n-1) ) is divisible by 4. 2. **Generalizing to Any Smaller Square Rooms with Integer Side Lengths:**    Now, let's consider more general cases.    - Suppose the large room is divided into several smaller square rooms where each smaller room has an integer side length that may differ.    - We can think of this setup as if we're dividing the large square into smaller squares with side lengths of 1 and then grouping some of these smaller squares into larger rooms.        Using this viewpoint, after the transformation into unit squares, still, the basic structure should follow the property demonstrated in step 1, i.e., all partitions are originally aligned along integer units. 3. **Impact of Different Side Lengths:**    We need to verify if combining squares of different side lengths affects divisibility by 4.    - When we merge smaller ( 1 times 1 ) squares to form larger squares (such as ( 2 times 2 ), ( 3 times 3 ), etc.), the partitions within these clusters coincide with our original observation (in step 1).    - On any transformation or rearrangement, the sum contribution from each smaller cluster still retains the original property of having partitions at integer units. 4. **Sum of Lengths of Partitions in the General Case:**    - Every time we merge smaller square rooms into larger ones, we are essentially adding or subtracting partitions of length, which are integral multiplex of rows/columns.    - Each addendum transformation or increased partition allows maintaining our earlier derivation that overall lengths remain divisible by 4 (proved by integer-based multipartitioning).     5. **Conclusion:**    As demonstrated through the two steps above, segmenting the square into smaller squares of integral lengths keeps the sum of the lengths of partitions divisible by 4. This holds for any such general arrangements or combinations due to integer alignments and individual sum considerations.

Since the line x+y+m=0 intersects the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=2 at two distinct points A and B, the distance d from point O to the line is less than sqrt{2}, i.e., d < sqrt{2}. 2. Given |overrightarrow{OA}+overrightarrow{OB}| geq |overrightarrow{AB}|, according to the properties of a parallelogram, the diagonal opposite to the obtuse angle between two sides is shorter than the diagonal opposite to the acute angle. Therefore, the angle between overrightarrow{AO} and overrightarrow{OB} is acute. 3. The slope of the line x+y+m=0 is -1, meaning the angle between the line and the negative x-axis is 45^{circ}. When the angle between overrightarrow{AO} and overrightarrow{OB} is a right angle, the line intersects the circle at points (-sqrt{2}, 0) and (0, -sqrt{2}), and the distance d between the origin and the line is 1.

There is a repeated edge between them because each is the nearest city to the other.

To find the length of the chord of the tangent line to the given circle, we can use the distance formula and the Pythagorean theorem.

Let's denote the largest number by (x). Thus, the smallest number will be (frac{x}{2}). 3. **Properties of the Numbers:**    Since 224 is not divisible by (7^2), both the smallest and largest numbers cannot be divisible by 7. Therefore, these numbers must be powers of 2. 4. **Finding Consecutive Powers of 2:**    Given that the smallest and largest numbers must be consecutive powers of 2, we need to find which powers fit this description such that their product, along with another factor, equals 224.    Let's denote:    [    x = 2^k quad text{and} quad frac{x}{2} = 2^{k-1}    ] 5. **Checking the Values:**    We need (2^k) (the largest number) to be greater than 7 (since it must be larger than any other factors):    [    2^3 = 8 > 7    ] 6. **Calculating the Product:**    Find (k) such that:    [    2^{k-1} cdot 2^k = 2^{k-1 + k} = 2^{2k-1}    ]    Now, multiply by the remaining factor, which is 7:    [    2^{2k-1} cdot 7 = 224    ] 7. **Simplifying the Expression:**    Simplify the exponent:    [    224 = 2^{5} cdot 7    ]    From the above equation:    [    2k - 1 = 5 quad Rightarrow quad 2k = 6 quad Rightarrow quad k = 3    ]    Hence, the largest number is:    [    2^3 = 8    ]    And the smallest number is:    [    2^{k-1} = 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    The remaining factor is 7.

To understand the behavior of f(x), we differentiate it to get its first derivative: f'(x) = e^x - x - 1. **Step 2: Defining p(x) = e^x - x - 1 and Analyzing Its Derivative** We then consider p(x) = e^x - x - 1 to further analyze the behavior of f(x). The derivative of p(x) is: p'(x) = e^x - 1. By examining p'(x), we can determine the intervals where p(x) is increasing or decreasing: - For x < 0, p'(x) < 0, indicating that p(x) is decreasing. - For x > 0, p'(x) > 0, indicating that p(x) is increasing. Since p(0) = 0 and p(x) increases for x > 0, we conclude that p(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, with equality only when x = 0. This implies that f'(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, meaning f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. **Step 3: Comparing a and b** Given a = e^{sqrt{2}} and b = 2 + sqrt{2}, we evaluate f(sqrt{2}): f(sqrt{2}) = e^{sqrt{2}} - 2 - sqrt{2} > 0. This shows that a > b. **Step 4: Analyzing g(x) = x - ln(x) - ln(6) and Its Derivative** Next, we define g(x) = x - ln(x) - ln(6) and find its derivative: g'(x) = frac{x - 1}{x}. The derivative indicates that g(x) is decreasing for 0 < x < 1 and increasing for x > 1. **Step 5: Evaluating g(x) at Specific Points** Evaluating g(3) gives us: g(3) = 3 - ln(3) - ln(6) = ln(e^3) - ln(18) > ln(19.683) - ln(18) > 0. Since g(x) is increasing for x > 1, and 2 + sqrt{2} > 3, we have g(2 + sqrt{2}) > g(3) > 0.

The key to solving this problem lies in mastering the concepts of necessary conditions, sufficient conditions, and necessary and sufficient conditions. Let's break it down step by step: 1. First, we need to understand that a necessary condition is a prerequisite for the occurrence of another event, while a sufficient condition guarantees the occurrence of another event. A necessary and sufficient condition is a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for the occurrence of another event. 2. Now, let's analyze the given statement \\"a > |b|\\" is a \\"necessary and sufficient condition\\" for \\"{a}^{2} > {b}^{2}\\". 3. If \\"a > |b|\\", then squaring both sides, we get \\"{a}^{2} > {b}^{2}\\", as squaring a bigger number always results in a bigger number. Hence, the condition is sufficient. 4. However, the condition is not necessary. For example, consider a = -3 and b = 2, we have {a}^{2} > {b}^{2} but a not> |b|. 5. Therefore, \\"a > |b|\\" is a \\"sufficient but not necessary condition\\" for \\"{a}^{2} > {b}^{2}\\". Hence, the correct answer is boxed{B: 必要不充分条件 (B: A sufficient but not necessary condition)}."},{"instruction":"f (frac{1}{x+3} = 2), then what is the value of (frac{1}{x+5})?

The number of ways to do this follows the combination formula binom{n}{k}: [ binom{6}{3} = frac{6 times 5 times 4}{3 times 2 times 1} = 20 ]  Step 2: Distribute the Remaining Elements After selecting the 3 elements for the intersection, we have 3 elements remaining. For each of these, there are choices to be made: - It can go to zero, just one, exactly two, or all three subsets. - There are 4 modes for each of the remaining 3 elements (since excluding all three subsets is not an option as their union needs to be T):   - In one subset only (3 choices).   - In two subsets (combination of 2 out of 3, i.e., 3 choices).   - In all three subsets (1 choice). For each element, there are 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 ways of being distributed. Therefore, for 3 elements, there are 7^3 = 343 ways.  Conclusion: The total number of ways to choose three subsets such that their union is T and their intersection exactly contains three elements is 6860, found by multiplying the results of steps 1 and 2 together and accounting for the order: 20 times 343 = 6860.

For each nonzero digit (1-9) and each length from 1 to 4, we have 9 such numbers (i.e., 9 singles, 99, 999, and 9999), leading to 9 times 4 = 36 total numbers. Next, we consider numbers with exactly two different digits. If there are three digits (excluding 0): - We choose any two different digits (excluding 0) from 1 to 9. This gives {9 choose 2} = 36 combinations. - For each combination, we can form arrangements like AB, BA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB, BBA, AAAB, AABA, ABAA, BAAA, AABB, ABAB, BAAB, ABBA, BABA, BBAA, ABBB, BABB, BBAB, BBBA. This totals 22 per digit combination. So, with only two different chosen digits (excluding 0), we have 36 times 22 = 792 combinations. Next, let's consider numbers with digits where one of the digits can be zero and the numbers are not starting with zero: - We select one digit from 1-9 and combine with 0, which gives 9 combinations. - For numbers not starting with zero, we can form them as A0, A00, A0A, AA0, A000, AA00, A0A0, A00A, AAA0, AA0A, A0AA (totaling 11 per non-zero digit with zero combination). So, this contributes another 9 times 11 = 99 combinations. Finally, we calculate numbers with three distinct digits where none is zero: - Choose any three different digits from 1 to 9, {9 choose 3} = 84 combinations. - We can arrange three digits in 3^4 - 3 times 2^4 + 3 times 2 - 1 = 81 - 48 + 6 - 1 = 38 valid non-repeating ways.

The butter has a 10% discount on its original price of £3: 10% of £3 = 0.10 * £3 = £0.30 Discounted price of butter = £3 - £0.30 = £2.70 The cookies have a 20% discount on their original price of £4: 20% of £4 = 0.20 * £4 = £0.80 Discounted price of cookies = £4 - £0.80 = £3.20 Now, let's calculate the price of the juice, which is two times the price of the bread: Price of juice = 2 * £2 = £4 Now we can calculate the total cost of the items before VAT: Total cost before VAT = Price of bread + Discounted price of butter + Price of juice + Discounted price of cookies Total cost before VAT = £2 + £2.70 + £4 + £3.20 Total cost before VAT = £11.90 Now we need to calculate the VAT on the total cost: 5% VAT of £11.90 = 0.05 * £11.90 = £0.595 Since we can't have a fraction of a penny, we'll round the VAT to the nearest penny: VAT = £0.60 Now let's calculate the total cost including VAT: Total cost including VAT = Total cost before VAT + VAT Total cost including VAT = £11.90 + £0.60 Total cost including VAT = £12.50 Finally, let's calculate how much money Paul has left after his shopping: Money left = Initial amount - Total cost including VAT Money left = £20 - £12.50 Money left = £7.50 Paul has boxed{£7.50}  left after buying all the items."},{"instruction":"a tennis tournament, (2^n + 4) schoolchildren are participating, where (n) is a natural number greater than 4.

Let ( 2^n + 4 ) be the number of participants in the tennis tournament, where ( n ) is a natural number greater than 4. 2. To determine how many participants score 3 points each, we need to define two major claims and prove them.     3. **Claim 1:** In a tournament with ( 2^n ) participants, no player is left without a pair. At the end of the tournament, there will be ( C_{n}^{k} ) participants with ( k ) points for each ( k in {0, 1, ldots, n-1, n} ).    - **Proof by induction on ( n ):**      - **Base case ( n=1 ):** With ( n=1 ), we have ( 2^1 = 2 ) participants. The outcomes are straightforward: one player wins (1 point), one loses (0 points). Hence, ( C_1^0 = 1 ) and ( C_1^1 = 1 ).      - **Inductive step:** Assume the claim is true for some ( n ). Consider a tournament with ( 2^{n+1} ) participants.         - Group them into ( 2^n ) participants each with 0 points and 1 point after the first round.        - Apply the inductive hypothesis: in each group, participants will have ( C_{n}^{k} ) with ( k ) points.         - By the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle, for the ( 2^{n+1} ) participants, we get ( C_{n+1}^{k} = C_{n}^{k} + C_{n}^{k-1} ). Thus, every score distribution follows Pascal's triangle.    Therefore, the first claim holds. 4. **Claim 2:** The tournament can be divided into two independent tournaments within groups of ( 2^n ) and 4 participants respectively.    - **Proof:** We conduct the tournament as follows:      - In each round, pair up players only within their group.      - For the group of ( 2^n ), ensure no participant is left unpaired.      - In the final stage, if there are any participants without a pair, they must belong to the group of 4 participants.     Hence, at the end, the results from two groups combine, creating a single leaderboard. 5. **Conclusion:**    - In the group of ( 2^n ), from Claim 1, there are ( C_{n}^{3} ) participants with 3 points.     - In the group of 4 participants, by direct enumeration (tracking with dynamic pairs and outcomes), eventually exactly one participant will end with 3 points.     6.

We now compute the Euclidean distance between points (A) and (A'): [ rho(x) = sqrt{(x - e^{3x + 11})^2 + (e^{3x + 11} - x)^2} ] 6. This simplifies as follows: [ rho(x) = sqrt{(x - e^{3x + 11})^2 + (e^{3x + 11} - x)^2} = sqrt{2(e^{3x + 11} - x)^2} = sqrt{2} left| e^{3x + 11} - x right| ] 7. Next, consider the function (f(x) = e^{3x + 11} - x), and we need to find where this function attains its minimum value. This will help us find the closest point since we know that (rho(x)) depends on (left| e^{3x + 11} - x right|). 8. We find the critical points of (f(x)) by setting its first derivative to zero: [ f'(x) = 3e^{3x + 11} - 1 = 0 ] 9. Solving for (x), we get: [ 3e^{3x + 11} = 1 Rightarrow e^{3x + 11} = frac{1}{3} Rightarrow 3x + 11 = lnleft(frac{1}{3}right) Rightarrow 3x + 11 = -ln 3 Rightarrow x_0 = frac{-ln 3 -11}{3} ] 10. To confirm that (f(x)) attains its minimum at (x = x_0), we observe the behavior of (f(x)): [ f''(x) = 9e^{3x + 11} ] Since (e^{3x + 11}) is always positive, (f''(x) > 0) for all (x). Hence, (f(x)) attains its minimum value at (x = x_0). 11. Evaluating (f(x)) at (x = x_0): [ f(x_0) = e^{3x_0 + 11} - x_0 = frac{1}{3} - left(frac{-ln 3 - 11}{3}right) = frac{1}{3} + frac{ln 3 + 11}{3} = frac{ln 3 + 12}{3} ] 12. Finally, substituting (f(x_0)) back into (rho(x)): [ rho(x_0) = sqrt{2} left(e^{3x_0 + 11} - x_0 right) = sqrt{2} left(frac{ln 3 + 12}{3}right) ] 13.

Given the integers (a > b > c > d > 0) such that (ad = bc), we need to show that ((a - d)^2 ge 4d + 8). 2. First, let's express (a) in terms of (b, c,) and (d). Since (ad = bc), we can write:    [    a = frac{bc}{d}    ]    Since (a, b, c,) and (d) are integers and (a > b > c > d > 0), (d) must divide (bc). 3. Next, we need to show that ((a - d)^2 ge 4d + 8). Let's substitute (a = frac{bc}{d}) into the inequality:    [    left(frac{bc}{d} - dright)^2 ge 4d + 8    ] 4. Simplify the left-hand side:    [    left(frac{bc - d^2}{d}right)^2 = left(frac{bc - d^2}{d}right)^2 = frac{(bc - d^2)^2}{d^2}    ] 5. Therefore, the inequality becomes:    [    frac{(bc - d^2)^2}{d^2} ge 4d + 8    ] 6. Multiply both sides by (d^2) to clear the fraction:    [    (bc - d^2)^2 ge d^2(4d + 8)    ] 7. Expand the right-hand side:    [    d^2(4d + 8) = 4d^3 + 8d^2    ] 8. So, the inequality we need to prove is:    [    (bc - d^2)^2 ge 4d^3 + 8d^2    ] 9. Since (a > b > c > d > 0), we know that (a) is significantly larger than (d). Let's consider the minimum values for (a, b, c,) and (d). The smallest possible values that satisfy (a > b > c > d > 0) and (ad = bc) are (a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d = 1). 10. For these values, we have:     [     (4 - 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9     ]     and     [     4d + 8 = 4(1) + 8 = 12     ] 11. Clearly, (9 ge 12) is false, so we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the general case again. 12. Since (a > b > c > d > 0), we can assume (a = kd) for some integer (k > 1). Then:     [     kd cdot d = bc implies k = frac{bc}{d^2}     ] 13. We need to show that:     [     (kd - d)^2 ge 4d + 8     ]     Simplify:     [     (d(k - 1))^2 ge 4d + 8     ]     [     d^2(k - 1)^2 ge 4d + 8     ] 14. Divide both sides by (d):     [     d(k - 1)^2 ge 4 + frac{8}{d}     ] 15. Since (d > 0), (frac{8}{d}) is positive and decreases as (d) increases. For (d ge 1), (frac{8}{d} le 8). 16. Therefore, we need:     [     d(k - 1)^2 ge 4 + 8 = 12     ] 17. For (d ge 1), (k - 1) must be sufficiently large to satisfy the inequality. Since (k > 1), (k - 1 ge 1). 18. Thus, the inequality holds for sufficiently large (a, b, c,) and (d) such that (a > b > c > d > 0) and (ad = bc).

Each number has at most k digits.    - We select those numbers whose digits are either 0 or 1 only, without any digit being 2.  3. **Counting the Selected Numbers**:    - Each digit in a k-digit number in base 3 can independently be 0 or 1.    - Therefore, for each of the k positions, there are 2 choices (0 or 1).    - Hence, there are 2^k such numbers.     4. **Verify the Arithmetic Mean Condition**:    - We need to show that none of these selected numbers can be the arithmetic mean of any pair of the selected numbers.    - Assume for contradiction that a selected number ( p ) is the arithmetic mean of two other selected numbers ( q ) and ( r ). This gives the equation:      [      2p = q + r quad text{or equivalently} quad p = frac{q + r}{2}      ]    - When adding ( q ) and ( r ) in base 3:      - The digits of any selected number are either 0 or 1.      - Hence, the sum of any digits from ( q ) and ( r ) can be 0, 1, or 2 (because ( 0+0=0 ), ( 1+0=1 ), ( 1+1=2 )).      - If a digit sum results in 2, the corresponding digit in ( 2p ) would be 2 since ( q ) and ( r ) belong to our selected numbers with digits only being 0 or 1.     5. **Contradiction**:    - Given ( p ) is selected, it means its digits are either 0 or 1.    - Hence, ( 2p ) would NOT have any digit as 2 (since ( 2 times {0, 1} = {0, 2} )).    - But this contradicts our sum check, i.e., for ( 2p = q + r ) to be true with digits, sums generating any 2 should have carried over affecting other positions - impossible here due to binary digit selection. 6. **Conclusion**:    - If a digit position results in a 2, it must affect other digit positions which can only happen if some digit was not following 0-1 restriction which contradicts.

Show that one can remove an entire column to leave an ( n times (n1) ) array which has no two rows identical.","output":"We aim to prove that for an ( n times n ) array where no two rows are identical across all columns, one can remove one column such that no two rows in the resulting ( n times (n-1) ) array are identical. We will use mathematical induction to demonstrate this. 1. **Base Case (( m = 2 )):**    For ( m = 2 ) (i.e., the array has 2 rows), since the two rows are different, they must differ in at least one column. Let ( C ) be the column where the rows differ.    Therefore, removing any column other than ( C ) ensures that the two rows are still different in the remaining columns. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume that the statement is true for ( m lt n ); that is, for any ( k times n ) array where ( k leq m ), there exists a set ( C ) of fewer than ( m ) columns such that all ( k ) rows are still distinguishable in the subset of columns in ( C ). 3. **Induction Step:**    Now, consider the case where ( m = k + 1 ). We need to show that there exists a set ( C ) of fewer than ( k + 1 ) columns that can distinguish all ( k + 1 ) rows.    Since the hypothesis holds for ( m leq k ), we have a set ( C ) of fewer than ( k ) columns which distinguish the first ( k ) rows.    If set ( C ) also distinguishes row ( k+1 ) from all previous ( k ) rows, then we are done. Otherwise, row ( k+1 ) must match one of the previous ( k ) rows on all columns in ( C ).     4. **Adding a Distinguishing Column:**    As row ( k+1 ) cannot be identical to any of the previous rows across all ( n ) columns, there must be some column where row ( k+1 ) differs from the row it matches within set ( C ). Let this column be ( c' ).    Add column ( c' ) to ( C ). This ensures that the new set ( C' ) (which is ( C cup {c'} )) now contains fewer than ( k + 1 ) columns and distinguishes row ( k+1 ) from all previous rows. 5. **Conclusion:**    By induction, the result holds for all ( m leq n ). This means for our ( n times n ) array, we can always find a set ( C ) of fewer than ( n ) columns that can distinguish all ( n ) rows. Since this set is fewer than ( n ) columns, it leaves at least one column that can be removed without making any two rows identical. Therefore, it is possible to remove one column from the ( n times n ) array to obtain an ( n times (n-1) ) array with no two identical rows.

The distance (d) between these two points is given to be an integer. The distance formula between two points ((x_1, y_1)) and ((x_2, y_2)) in the plane is:    [    d = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}    ]    Applying this to our points ((a, f(a))) and ((b, f(b))), we get:    [    d = sqrt{(b - a)^2 + (f(b) - f(a))^2}    ] 3. Since (d) is an integer, (d^2) must also be an integer. Therefore, we have:    [    d^2 = (b - a)^2 + (f(b) - f(a))^2    ] 4. Given that the polynomial has integer coefficients, the difference (a - b) is an integer. Let (k = b - a), so (k) is an integer. We can rewrite the equation as:    [    d^2 = k^2 + (f(b) - f(a))^2    ] 5. Since (a) and (b) are integers, and the polynomial has integer coefficients, the difference (f(b) - f(a)) must be divisible by (b - a). This means there exists some integer (m) such that:    [    f(b) - f(a) = m(b - a) = mk    ] 6.

The axis of symmetry for a quadratic function ax^2+bx+c is given by x=-frac{b}{2a}. For y=-x^2+2x-2, the axis of symmetry is x=1. Therefore, the function is decreasing for x>1, which implies D=(1,+infty). 2. **Inequality Condition**: Given 2^{x^2-2ax+2a^2-1} > 1, we can rewrite this as x^2-2ax+2a^2-1 > 0 for all xin(1,+infty). The axis of symmetry for this quadratic expression is x=a, and the discriminant Delta = 4-4a^2. 3. **Analysis Based on Delta**:    - **Case 1**: When a > 1 or a < -1, we have Delta < 0. A negative discriminant means the quadratic expression does not touch the x-axis, implying x^2-2ax+2a^2-1 > 0 for all x in the domain.    - **Case 2**: When a=1, the expression simplifies to (x-1)^2, which is always positive for x>1, hence satisfying the condition.    - **Case 3**: When -1 leq a < 1, the quadratic function y=x^2-2ax+2a^2-1 is increasing on (1,+infty).

To ensure that ( 2n ) is a perfect square, all prime numbers in the factorization of ( 2n ) must appear to an even exponent. 2. Similarly, for ( 15n ) to be a perfect cube, all prime numbers in the factorization of ( 15n ) must appear to a multiple of three exponent. 3. Examine the factor of 2:    - Since ( 2n ) is a perfect square, the power of 2 in ( n ) must be odd, because ( 2 times text{(odd power of 2)} = 2^{text{even}} ).    - Since ( 15n ) is a perfect cube, the power of 2 in ( n ) must be a multiple of 3.     - Hence, the smallest odd multiple of 3 is 3. 4. Next, examine the factor of 3:    - Since ( 2n ) is a perfect square, the power of 3 in ( n ) must be even, because any number times 2 must still result in an even exponent for it to form a perfect square.    - Since ( 15n ) is a perfect cube, the power of 3 must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, as ( 15 = 3 times 5 ) and multiplying a power of 3 by 3^1 will result in a power divisible by 3 only leaving when such power adding up to 5n has already been catered to.    - Therefore, the smallest value fitting both criteria is ( 3^2 = 9 ). 5.

Similarly, the goose flies the distance between the North Sea and the South Sea in 9 days, meaning it covers frac{1}{9} of the distance in one day. Given that both the duck and the goose start flying at the same time and in opposite directions, the fraction of the distance they collectively cover in one day is the sum of the fractions of the distance each covers individually. Therefore, we can express the equation for the total distance covered by both birds in x days as: [ frac{1}{7}x + frac{1}{9}x = 1 ] This equation represents the total distance covered by both the duck and the goose together in x days, which equals the entire distance between the two seas.

This coefficient comes from the sum of products of the form (a_h b_k) where (h + k = i + j). Specifically:    [    text{Coefficient of } x^{i+j} = sum_{substack{h+k=i+j}} a_h b_k    ] 5. **Analyze Odd Contribution:**    All terms (a_h b_k) for (h neq i) or (k neq j) involve at least one coefficient (a_h) or (b_k) from (P(x)) or (Q(x)) that is even, hence (a_h b_k) is even. The term (a_i b_j) involves both (a_i) and (b_j) being odd, hence (a_i b_j) is odd. 6. **Sum of Terms:**    Since all terms except (a_i b_j) are even, the sum:    [    sum_{substack{h+k=i+j}} a_h b_k    ]    will be odd because the even terms sum to an even number, and adding an odd number (a_i b_j) results in an odd number.    This contradicts the given condition that all coefficients of the product polynomial are even.  7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, our initial assumption that both polynomials have at least one odd coefficient cannot be true. Thus, one of the polynomials, say (P(x)), must have all coefficients even to ensure all terms in the product are at least even (since even multiplied by anything is even), avoiding any odd term in the final product. 8. **Remaining Polynomial:**    If all coefficients of both (P(x)) and (Q(x)) were even, then each term in the product would be a multiple of 4 but this contradicts the problem condition. Therefore, the remaining polynomial (Q(x)) must have at least one odd coefficient to ensure not all coefficients of the product are multiples of 4.

The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S_n = n/2 * (2a1 + (n - 1)d) We know that the sum of the pages (S_n) is 95, so we can set up the equation: 95 = n/2 * (2 * 13 + (n - 1) * 3) Now, let's solve for n: 95 = n/2 * (26 + 3n - 3) 95 = n/2 * (3n + 23) 190 = n * (3n + 23) Now we have a quadratic equation: 3n^2 + 23n - 190 = 0 To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula: n = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a) where a = 3, b = 23, and c = -190. Let's calculate the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac): Discriminant = b^2 - 4ac Discriminant = 23^2 - 4 * 3 * (-190) Discriminant = 529 + 2280 Discriminant = 2809 Now, let's find the two possible values for n: n = [-23 ± sqrt(2809)] / (2 * 3) n = [-23 ± 53] / 6 We have two possible solutions: n = (-23 + 53) / 6 n = 30 / 6 n = 5 or n = (-23 - 53) / 6 n = -76 / 6 n = -12.67 (which is not possible since the number of chapters cannot be negative or a fraction) Therefore, the book has boxed{5}  chapters."},{"instruction":"A ranch has both horses and ponies.

So, the number of ponies with horseshoes is (3/10)P. Out of these ponies with horseshoes, 5/8 are from Iceland. So, the number of Icelandic ponies with horseshoes is (5/8)(3/10)P = (15/80)P. Since the number of Icelandic ponies with horseshoes must be a whole number, (15/80)P must be an integer. The fraction 15/80 can be simplified to 3/16. So, (3/16)P must be an integer. This means that P must be a multiple of 16 for (3/16)P to be an integer. Now, we are told that the minimum possible combined number of horses and ponies on the ranch is 163. Since there are more horses than ponies, let's denote the number of horses as H. We have: P + H = 163 Since P must be a multiple of 16 and we are looking for the minimum number of horses and ponies, let's find the smallest multiple of 16 that is less than 163. The largest multiple of 16 less than 163 is 160 (since 16 * 10 = 160). If P = 160, then H = 163 - P = 163 - 160 = 3.

Step 2: Determining the Number of Squares of Each Color A 5 times 5 board has 25 cells in total. If we color the board like a standard chessboard: - The top left corner is white. - Each row alternates in color. - Consequently, in a 5 times 5 board, where the dimensions are both odd, there will be one more square of the initial color than of the opposite color. Specifically, on such a board: - The number of white squares is 13. - The number of black squares is 12.  Step 3: Requirement for the Moves Each checkers piece needs to move to an adjacent cell, either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. Thus: - Any piece on a white cell must move to a black cell. - Any piece on a black cell must move to a white cell.  Step 4: Feasibility of the Arrangement Given that each move must involve switching to a square of the opposite color: - Currently, there are 13 checkers pieces on white squares and 12 on black squares. - After moving, all 13 white-square pieces would have to be placed on black squares, and all 12 black-square pieces would have to be placed on white squares.

Since varphi(n) involves the terms (p_i - 1), for all i, the only way this can be satisfied is if each prime factor p_i of n appears exactly once in its prime factorization. Therefore, we require each a_i = 1, which implies:        [    n = p_1 p_2 ldots p_k    ]    Additionally, since (n, varphi(n)) = 1, none of the prime factors p_i of n can divide varphi(n).

Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true. **B: If ∠AOC=frac{1}{2}∠AOB, then ray OC bisects angle AOB** - The statement that ∠AOC=frac{1}{2}∠AOB indicates a relationship between the two angles but does not inherently mean that OC bisects angle AOB without confirming that OC is within the interior of angle AOB. Thus, this statement cannot be accepted as correct without this clarification. **C: If angle 1 and angle 2 are complementary, then the supplement of angle 1 is 90^{circ} greater than angle 2** - Given that angle 1 and angle 2 are complementary, we have angle 1 + angle 2 = 90^{circ}. To find the supplement of angle 1, we subtract angle 1 from 180^{circ}, which gives 180^{circ} - angle 1. Since angle 1 = 90^{circ} - angle 2, substituting this into the supplement gives 180^{circ} - (90^{circ} - angle 2) = 90^{circ} + angle 2. This shows that the supplement of angle 1 is indeed 90^{circ} greater than angle 2. Therefore, this statement is correct. **D: If angle alpha +angle beta +angle y=180^{circ}, then these three angles are complementary** - The definition of complementary angles is two angles whose sum is 90^{circ}. Since angle alpha +angle beta +angle y=180^{circ}, this implies that they sum up to 180^{circ}, which is the definition of supplementary angles, not complementary. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

We are given the problem of 1994 students seated around a circular table playing a card-passing game.

Conclusion for ( n > 1994 ):    [    boxed{text{The game can continue indefinitely.}}    ]    - When ( n = 1994 ):             - Assign students sequentially as ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_{1994} ). Initially, ( G_1 ) holds all the cards.      - Define the \\"circulation value\\" of a card: when a card is held by ( G_i ), its value is ( i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq 1994 )).       - Let ( S ) represent the sum of the circulation values of all cards. Initially, ( S = 1994 ).      If a student ( G_i ) (with ( i in {1, 1994} )) passes cards, ( S ) can either increase or decrease by 1994 since 1994 students are passing and each has a unique identifier corresponding to their position.      - When cards are passed from ( G_1 ) or ( G_{1994} ), ( S ) will be adjusted by ( pm1994 ).      By modular arithmetic, we see:      [      S equiv 0 pmod{1994}      ]      If each student eventually holds exactly one card apiece, then:      [      S = 1 + 2 + cdots + 1994 = frac{1994 times 1995}{2} = 997 times 1995      ]      Calculating the modulus, we have:      [      997 times 1995 equiv 997 pmod{1994}      ]      Since ( S equiv 0 pmod{1994} ) must hold, ( 997 notequiv 0 pmod{1994} ).

During the card-passing process, upon passing a card from one neighboring student to another, a student's name is written on the card. Each pass writes two names on the card.    - A passed card will continue circulating between the same two students until the game ends because each card can only contain names corresponding to its current holders.    - By the Pigeonhole Principle, since we have fewer cards (( n )) than students (1994), at least two students who are neighbors will eventually end up with a card containing both their names.    Therefore, no new cards are circulated between these pairings, and the game will reach a state where each student ends up with at most one card, eventually ending the game.

This property is more closely associated with a rhombus when all sides are equal in length. Therefore, option A is incorrect. - **Option B: Diagonals are equal in length**   - For a rectangle, this statement is true.

Let's denote the number of shells in any pile by S(n). Initially, S(0) = 637 and the number of piles, denoted by P(n), is P(0) = 1.  Step 2: Understanding the process Each operation consists of: 1.
