This implies that all its internal angles are (60^circ).    - Recall that (omega) is the incircle and by definition of touching (BC) at (K), the segment (HK) is perpendicular to (BC). 4. **Application of known properties of altitudes and angle bisectors:**    - For example, consider the angles.

Showing each angle is thereby (60^circ). 7. **Accounting for (A), (B), (C) angles:**    - Given one angle in (triangle ABC = 50^circ ),      [      angle A = 50^circ      ]    - Since angles of any triangle sum to (180^circ):      [      angle B + angle C = 130^circ      ]    - If (angle A = 60^circ), based on angle equality:      [      angle B = 60^circ, quad angle C = 70^circ      ] # Conclusion:   Thus, the two unknown angles of ( triangle ABC ) are: [ boxed{60^circ text{ and } 70^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"A hare and a tortoise competed in a 5 km race along a straight line, going due North.

We need to form a sequence where each pair of consecutive numbers differ by 3 or 5. 2. One way to accomplish this is to rotate through a specific pattern.

Each set follows the differences of 3 or 5 correctly. Thus, since 1000 is a multiple of 8, we can conclude that it is possible to rearrange the numbers from 1 to 1000 such that the differences between consecutive numbers are either 3 or 5, following the same logic as used in part (a).

This implies ( x_1 neq x_2 ), so we can infer (x_1^n = beta_1) and (x_2^n = beta_2). 5. **Simplifying Roots Using Absolute Values**:    [    |x_1 x_2| = sqrt[n]{|beta_1 beta_2|} = sqrt[n]{frac{2}{3}} < 1    ]    On the other hand,    [    |x_1 x_2| = sqrt[m]{|alpha_1 alpha_2|} = sqrt[m]{frac{3}{2}} > 1    ]    This results in a contradiction, showing the assumption of divisibility is false. 6. **Analyzing the Non-Positive Discriminant Case**:    Now, consider (A^2 - 24 leq 0).    - In this case, (left|alpha_1right| = left|alpha_2right| = sqrt{frac{3}{2}}) and (left|beta_1right| = left|beta_2right| = sqrt{frac{2}{3}}). 7. **Another Simplification Using Roots**:    [    |x_1| = sqrt[m]{|alpha_1|} = sqrt[2m]{frac{3}{2}} > 1    ]    Simultaneously,    [    |x_1| = sqrt[n]{|beta_1|} = sqrt[2n]{frac{2}{3}} < 1    ]    This again results in a contradiction. # Conclusion: Neither case allows for (3 x^{2 n} + A x^{n} + 2) to divide (2 x^{2 m} + A x^{m} + 3), irrespective of the integer value of (A).

His savings increase by 100%, so he saves 2S. His expenditure in the second year is his income minus his savings, which is 1.25I - 2S. According to the problem, the total expenditure in two years is double his expenditure in the first year. So, the expenditure in the second year plus the expenditure in the first year equals twice the expenditure in the first year: (I - S) + (1.25I - 2S) = 2(I - S) Expanding and simplifying the equation: I - S + 1.25I - 2S = 2I - 2S Combining like terms: 2.25I - 3S = 2I - 2S Now, let's isolate S: 2.25I - 2I = 3S - 2S 0.25I = S Now, to find the percentage of his income that he saved in the first year, we divide the savings by the income and multiply by 100: (S / I) * 100 = (0.25I / I) * 100 The I's cancel out: 0.25 * 100 = 25% So, the man saved boxed{25%}  of his income in the first year."},{"instruction":"A 50.5 centimeters (cm) long color tape was made by overlapping and attaching three 18 centimeters (cm) color tapes.

Any move involving a member of the red family in our sequence of moves will be skipped.    - Using this modified sequence of moves, we can get from configuration ( A' ) to configuration ( B' ). Since ( A ) and ( B ) are any configurations of ( k ) families, the same is true for ( A' ) and ( B' ) but for ( k-1 ) families.    - Therefore, it is true for ( n = k-1 ). 3. **Contradiction:**    - By repeating this process, we eventually reach ( n = 1 ), for which we have already established that it is impossible to obtain every arrangement of the people by the allowed exchanges.    - This contradiction implies that our initial assumption that it is possible for ( n = k ) is false. 4. **Conclusion:**    - Since the assumption leads to a contradiction, it follows that there is no such ( n ) for which it is possible to obtain every arrangement of the people by the allowed exchanges.

Since there are only 3 possible remainders (0, 1, 2), among four integers (a, b, c, d), by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of them must have the same remainder when divided by 3.    Suppose (a equiv b mod 3), then (a - b equiv 0 mod 3). Because our expression contains factors that are differences between such pairs, the product ((a-b)(b-c)(c-d)(d-a)(b-d)(a-c)) must be divisible by 3. 3. **Divisibility by 4:**    Next, consider values modulo 4:    - **Case 1:** If any two of (a, b, c, d) have the same remainder modulo 4, their difference is divisible by 4.    - **Case 2:** If (a, b, c, d) all have different remainders modulo 4, they represent the complete set {0, 1, 2, 3}.

From equation (2), we can solve for b: b = 6 / (12/100) b = 6 / 0.12 b = 50 Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it into equation (1) to find a: (P/100) * a = 12 a = 12 / (P/100) a = 12 * (100/P) Now we can find c: c = b / a c = 50 / (12 * (100/P)) c = 50 / (1200/P) c = 50P / 1200 c = P / 24 Since c = b / a, and we have found that c = P / 24, we can equate b / a to P / 24: b / a = P / 24 We already know that b = 50, so we can substitute that in: 50 / a = P / 24 Now we can solve for a: a = 50 / (P / 24) a = 50 * (24 / P) a = 1200 / P Now we have expressions for both a and b in terms of P.

Hence, b_1 = 2.    - For ( n=2 ), the possible balanced strings are: ( bigcircbigcirc, bigcircdiamond, diamondbigcirc, diamonddiamond ).

We notice from the given conditions that AC = AB since triangle ABC is isosceles. Therefore, we can rephrase CD = BC - AB. 3. Given that CD = BC - AB, this implies BD = AB. Therefore, triangle ABD is also isosceles with AB = BD. 4. Point M is defined as the midpoint of AD. Consequently, BM serves as the median in triangle ABD.  5.

Each grasshopper jumps to a point that is symmetric to the point it was at before the jump, relative to the centroid of the other three grasshoppers. Can one grasshopper land on another at some point? (The grasshoppers are pointlike.)","output":"1. **Define the positions**: Denote the positions of the four grasshoppers on the vertices of a square. Let's assume the square vertices at the (n)-th move have coordinates ((0,0)), ((0, 3^n)), ((3^n, 3^n)), and ((3^n, 0)). 2. **Coordinate system properties**: As the coordinates of the vertices of the square change with each jump, we observe that they are always powers of three. This means that the coordinates of the grasshoppers are always integers and, specifically, of the form (3^k) for some integer (k). 3. **Jump mechanics**: Each grasshopper jumps to the point which is symmetric to its current position relative to the centroid of the other three grasshoppers. This ensures that:     - The coordinates of each new position remain integers.     - The jumps preserve the parity properties of the coordinates (coordinates remain divisible by the same power of 3). 4. **Verify the parity and transformation**: Since we are dealing with powers of three, the center of mass of any three points already positioned at vertices with coordinates (3^k) will itself have coordinates that remain integer multiples of (3^k). This implies:     - If at move (n), all grasshoppers are at points ((0,0), (0, 3^n), (3^n, 3^n) ) and ( (3^n, 0)), after any jump, their coordinates will still be in the form of (3^k).     - The possibility of one grasshopper landing on another implies coordination points must clash, breaking the distinctiveness provided by the power of three structure. 5. **Conclusion**: With the inherent constraints in positions that the jumps impose (integer multiples, parity, specific patterns), it follows that two grasshoppers cannot simultaneously occupy the same point. The reasoning aligns with each grasshopper maintaining a specific local parity and magnitude dictated by powers of three in subsequent moves. Therefore, since the coordinates of the grasshoppers remain exclusive multiples of powers of 3 and considering the symmetric jump behavior, no two grasshoppers can land on the same spot at any point in time.

First, we rewrite the given line's equation in slope-intercept form to find its slope: [x - 2y + c = 0] [Rightarrow -2y = -x - c] [Rightarrow y = frac{1}{2}x + frac{c}{2}] So, the slope of the given line is frac{1}{2}. 2. Since the line we are looking for is perpendicular to the given line, its slope will be the negative reciprocal of frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the slope of the line we need is: [m = -frac{1}{left(frac{1}{2}right)} = -2] 3. Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line and m is the slope, we substitute m = -2 and the point (-1, 3): [y - 3 = -2(x - (-1))] [y - 3 = -2(x + 1)] 4.

The game is won when a player moves their king to reach the opposite side of the board (the white king must reach either the hfile or the 8th rank, and the black king must reach either the afile or the 1st rank).  In the optimal strategy, who will win the game, and what moves should they make?","output":"The problem involves a game on an international chessboard where the White King starts at square ( a1 ) and the Black King starts at square ( h8 ). Both players take turns moving their king to any adjacent square (a square sharing a common edge or corner), with White moving first. The kings are not allowed to increase the distance between them, where the distance is the minimum number of moves required for one king to reach the other. To win, each player must move their king to the far side of the board relative to the starting position of the other player's king (White to the ( h ) column or 8th row, Black to the ( a ) column or 1st row).  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Strategy of White:**    The White King will start by moving along the first row (rank 1) towards the ( h ) column.        [    a1 rightarrow b1 rightarrow c1 rightarrow ldots rightarrow h1    ]    By moving along this path, the White King steadily progresses towards the ( h ) column. 2. **Black’s Response:**    Assuming Black moves optimally, the Black King will have to move out of the 8th row to maintain compliance with the distance rule (initially, the distance is 7 moves as given).    Once White reaches the 7th step (which is ( g1 )), Black must have left the 8th row or moved accordingly to maintain the distance rule. 3. **Encounters During Movement:**    As the game progresses, the kings may come across one of two main scenarios. Either:    - The kings are positioned such that the sum of the differences in their rows and columns is even.          [      text{Example: }W(a1), B(h2) rightarrow text{difference sum} = 1 + 7 = 8 text{ (even)}      ]        - The sum of the differences in their rows and columns is odd. The strategic play would be making every effort to ensure the first position criteria above when following the playing rule. 4. **Final Victory Path for White:**    To ensure White wins, it needs to lock Black into a position where Black has no choice but to move in such a way that eventually leads White to an uncontested move to the 8th row or ( h ) column:    - If Black is forced to move up or sideways to avoid increasing the distance, White will follow strictly adjacent:            [      a1 rightarrow b1 rightarrow c1 rightarrow ldots rightarrow h1      ]        As White progresses, Black gets constrained into corner movements successively.    Eventually one of the path intersections leads White to the victory square uncontested. # Conclusion: The correct strategy for White is to consistently head straight for its target side while ensuring to maintain control over the distance constraints on Black's potential responses.

The figure composed in this way is called a dissection. The problem asks to prove that there exists a dissection that can be drawn continuously (a Hamiltonian path) if and only if (3 mid n). 2. **Proof for (3 mid n):**    Assume (n = 3k). We will prove that there is a Hamiltonian path for this polygon.        - For (k = 1), this corresponds to a triangle ((n = 3)), which can clearly be drawn continuously as it is a simple polygon with three edges.        - Assume for induction that the proposition holds for (n = 3k), i.e., there is a Hamiltonian path for a polygon with (3k) sides. 3. **Inductive step:**        Consider (n = 3(k+1)).

First, let's find the ratio of the amounts after 3 years to the amount after 2 years to find r: (9261 / 8880) = (P(1 + r)^3) / (P(1 + r)^2) By simplifying, we get: (9261 / 8880) = (1 + r) Now, let's calculate the ratio: 9261 / 8880 ≈ 1.0429 So, we have: 1 + r ≈ 1.0429 Now, we can solve for r: r ≈ 1.0429 - 1 r ≈ 0.0429 Now that we have the approximate value of r, we can substitute it back into either equation 1 or 2 to find P. Let's use equation 1: 8880 = P(1 + 0.0429)^2 Now, calculate (1 + 0.0429)^2: (1 + 0.0429)^2 ≈ 1.0876 Substitute this back into the equation: 8880 = P * 1.0876 Now, solve for P: P = 8880 / 1.0876 P ≈ 8160 Therefore, the initial sum of money (P) is approximately Rs. boxed{8160} ."},{"instruction":"The first term of the arithmetic sequence {b_n} is 1, and the common difference is 2.

Next, we need to simplify frac{1}{sin(2^{k+1} x)}:     begin{align*}     cot(2^k x) - frac{1}{sin(2^{k+1} x)} & = frac{cos(2^k x)}{sin(2^k x)} - frac{1}{sin(2^{k+1} x)}      & = frac{cos(2^k x) sin(2^{k+1} x) - 1}{sin(2^k x) sin(2^{k+1} x)}.     end{align*} 3.  Using the double-angle identity for sine, we have:          sin(2^{k+1} x) = 2 sin(2^k x) cos(2^k x).               Substitute this into the earlier expression:          cot(2^k x) - frac{1}{sin(2^{k+1} x)} = frac{cos(2^k x) cdot 2 sin(2^k x) cos(2^k x) - 1}{sin(2^k x) cdot 2 sin(2^k x) cos(2^k x)}.           4. Simplify the numerator:     begin{align*}     cos(2^k x) cdot 2 sin(2^k x) cos(2^k x) - 1 & = 2 cos^2(2^k x) sin(2^k x) - 1      & = sin(2^k x) cdot (2 cos^2(2^k x) - 1).     end{align*} 5. The entire term simplifies to:          frac{sin(2^k x) (2 cos^2(2^k x) - 1)}{2 sin^2(2^k x) cos(2^k x)}.      6. Since cos(2^{k+1} x) = 2 cos^2(2^k x) - 1, we get:     begin{align*}     frac{cos(2^{k+1} x)}{sin(2^{k+1} x)} & = cot(2^{k+1} x).     end{align*}          Thus, we have:          cot(2^k x) - frac{1}{sin(2^{k+1} x)} = cot(2^{k+1} x).      7. Now, sum the identities from (k=0) to (k=n-1):     begin{align*}     sum_{k=0}^{n-1} left(cot(2^k x) - frac{1}{sin(2^{k+1} x)}right) & = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} cot(2^{k+1} x).     end{align*}          This is equivalent to:     begin{align*}     cot(x) - frac{1}{sin(2x)} + cot(2x) - frac{1}{sin(4x)} + cdots + cot(2^{n-1} x) - frac{1}{sin(2^n x)} & = cot(2x) + cot(4x) + cdots + cot(2^n x).     end{align*} 8. Notice that all the terms cot(2^k x) for (k=1) to (n-1) cancel out, leaving:     begin{align*}     cot(x) & - frac{1}{sin(2x)} + cot(2x) - frac{1}{sin(4x)} + cdots + cot(2^{n-1} x) - frac{1}{sin(2^n x)}              & = cot(x) - cot(2^n x).     end{align*} 9. Therefore:     begin{align*}     frac{1}{sin(2x)} + frac{1}{sin(4x)} + cdots + frac{1}{sin(2^n x)} & = cot(x) - cot(2^n x).     end{align*}      # Conclusion: boxed{frac{1}{sin 2 x} + frac{1}{sin 4 x} + cdots + frac{1}{sin 2^n x} = cot x - cot 2^n x.}"},{"instruction":"A cistern 6 m long and 4 m wide contains water up to a depth of 1 m 25 cm. What is the total area of the wet surface?","output":"To find the total area of the wet surface of the cistern, we need to calculate the area of the bottom and the area of the sides that are in contact with the water. The bottom of the cistern is a rectangle with a length of 6 m and a width of 4 m. So, the area of the bottom is: Area_bottom = length * width Area_bottom = 6 m * 4 m Area_bottom = 24 m² Now, let's calculate the area of the sides. Since the cistern is a rectangular prism, it has four sides. Two of these sides are the length of the cistern and two are the width. The depth of the water is 1 m 25 cm, which is 1.25 m (since 100 cm = 1 m). The area of one of the longer sides (length side) is: Area_length_side = length * depth Area_length_side = 6 m * 1.25 m Area_length_side = 7.5 m² Since there are two of these sides, we multiply by 2: Total_area_length_sides = 2 * Area_length_side Total_area_length_sides = 2 * 7.5 m² Total_area_length_sides = 15 m² The area of one of the shorter sides (width side) is: Area_width_side = width * depth Area_width_side = 4 m * 1.25 m Area_width_side = 5 m² Since there are two of these sides, we multiply by 2: Total_area_width_sides = 2 * Area_width_side Total_area_width_sides = 2 * 5 m² Total_area_width_sides = 10 m² Now, we add the area of the bottom and the areas of the sides to get the total wet surface area: Total_wet_surface_area = Area_bottom + Total_area_length_sides + Total_area_width_sides Total_wet_surface_area = 24 m² + 15 m² + 10 m² Total_wet_surface_area = 49 m² Therefore, the total area of the wet surface of the cistern is boxed{49}  square meters."},{"instruction":"Two players take turns placing one checker at a time on a (65 times 65) board. In doing so, no more than two checkers can be placed on any line (horizontal or vertical). The player who cannot make a move loses. Who wins with optimal play?","output":"1. **Initial Move and Permutations**:     - Let the first player place the first checkers piece on the 65 times 65 board.     - It is observed that rearranging the rows or columns of the board does not affect the problem's constraints. Therefore, we can assume that the second player has the additional ability to permute any rows and columns of the board to position the board in a specific way. 2. **Symmetry Strategy for the Second Player**:     - After the first move by the first player, the second player will rearrange the rows and columns so that the first piece is positioned in the middle vertical stripe of the board but not necessarily in the board's center.     - The second player's strategy involves making moves symmetry, which means placing a piece in a location symmetric to the first player's move concerning the board's center. 3. **Subsequent Moves**:     - By consistently mirroring the first player's moves, the second player ensures that for any piece placed by the first player in a specific cell (i, j), the second player places a piece in the cell (65 - i + 1, 65 - j + 1). This ensures the mirrored effect and maintains balance.     4. **Ensuring No More than Two Checkers per Line Rule**:     - Both players must not place more than two pieces in any row or column. Since the board is symmetric, any vertical or horizontal positioning by the first player can be reflected accurately in the second player's move.     - Given that the symmetry strategy maintains the distribution of pieces, the second player will always have a valid move as long as the first player has a valid one. 5. **Mathematical Consideration**:     - Since each move made by the first player has a symmetric counterpart by the second player, the second player successfully mirrors the board configurations.     - There will never exist a state where the second player cannot make a move without violating the game rules as long as the first player's move is valid. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Given the symmetry strategy and unrestricted permutations of rows and columns allowed for the second player, the second player will always have a legal move until the first player runs out of valid moves. **Conclusion**: [boxed{text{The second player wins}}.]"},{"instruction":"the diagram, triangle PQR is rightangled at P and has PQ=3 and PR=3sqrt{3}.

To prove this inequality, we start by recognizing it as a specific case of the Hölder inequality with specific parameters. Here we proceed step-by-step to show the validity of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and determine the cases of equality. 1. **Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality Statement:**    [    left| sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i right| leq sqrt{ sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 } sqrt{ sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 }    ]    Note that proving the inequality for the absolute value suffices since if ( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i leq sqrt{ sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 } sqrt{ sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 }) then clearly, ( -sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i leq sqrt{ sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 } sqrt{ sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 }). 2. **Construct the Expression for Squaring Both Sides:**    Consider the expression ( (sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i)^2) ). Our goal is to show:    [    (sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i)^2 leq left( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 right) left( sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 right)    ] 3. **Expand and Simplify:**    To proceed, we can utilize the following theorem: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by considering vectors ( mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n) ) and ( mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_n) ) in ( mathbb{R}^n ). The dot product of these vectors is:    [    mathbf{x} cdot mathbf{y} = sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i    ]    And the norms of these vectors are given by:    [    | mathbf{x} | = sqrt{ sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 }    ]        [    | mathbf{y} | = sqrt{ sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 }    ]    Therefore, the inequality can be rewritten in terms of norms and dot product as:    [    (mathbf{x} cdot mathbf{y})^2 leq | mathbf{x} |^2 | mathbf{y} |^2    ]    Clearly,    [    (sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i)^2 leq left( sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2} cdot sqrt{sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2} right)^2    ]    Which further simplifies to:    [    (sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i)^2 leq left( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 right) left( sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 right)    ]    Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain our initial inequality, thus it holds. 4. **Cases of Equality:**    Equality occurs if and only if ( mathbf{x} ) and ( mathbf{y} ) are linearly dependent. That is, there exists a scalar ( lambda in mathbb{R} ) such that ( x_i = lambda y_i ) for all ( i ).

Then when xin(0,- dfrac {1}{a}), f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is monotonically increasing. When xin(- dfrac {1}{a},+infty), f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is monotonically decreasing. In summary: When a=0, the increasing interval of f(x) is (0,+infty); When a < 0, the increasing interval of f(x) is (0,- dfrac {1}{a}), and the decreasing interval is (- dfrac {1}{a},+infty).

Hence h(x) is decreasing in (-infty,0); Therefore h(x)geqslant h(0)=1, Hence m > 1; (3) When a=0, f(x)=ln x, the common domain of f(x) and g(x) is (0,+infty), therefore |f(x)-g(x)|=|ln x-e^{x}|=e^{x}-ln x=e^{x}-x-(ln x-x), Let m(x)=e^{x}-x, xin(0,+infty), Since m'(x)=e^{x}-1 > 0, m(x) is an increasing function in (0,+infty), m(x) > m(0)=1, Also let n(x)=ln x-x, xin(0,+infty), Since n'(x)= dfrac{1}{x} -1, when xin(0,1), n'(x) > 0, n(x) is an increasing function in (0,1), When xin(1,+infty), n'(x) < 0, n(x) is a decreasing function in (1,+infty), therefore when x=1, n(x) reaches its maximum value, i.e., n(x)leqslant n(1)=-1, Hence |f(x)-g(x)|=m(x)-n(x) > 1-(-1)=2.

Therefore, we can find cos C as follows: [ cos C = sqrt{1 - sin^2 C} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{3sqrt{3}}{14}right)^2} = frac{13}{14} ] Now, we can find sin B using the formula sin B = sin (A + C), which can be expanded using the sine addition formula: [ sin B = sin A cos C + cos A sin C = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times frac{13}{14} + frac{1}{2} times frac{3sqrt{3}}{14} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{7} ] Finally, the area S_{triangle ABC} can be calculated using the formula S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}acsin B: [ S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} times 7 times 3 times frac{4sqrt{3}}{7} = 6sqrt{3} ] Therefore, the area of triangle ABC when a = 7 is boxed{6sqrt{3}}."},{"instruction":"On each of the six faces of a cube, a number is written. Then, on each of the twelve edges, the sum of the numbers on the two adjacent faces is written. Is it possible to uniquely reconstruct the numbers on the faces given these 12 sums on the edges?","output":"1. **Define Variables:**    Let the numbers written on the faces of the cube be a, b, c, d, e, and f. 2. **Sum of Numbers on Edges:**    Each edge of the cube has a number which is the sum of the numbers on the two faces that the edge joins. Thus, there are 12 such edges given by:    [    a + b, , a + c, , a + d, , a + e, , b + c, , b + f, , c + f, , d + f, , d + e, , e + f, , b + d, , c + e    ] 3. **Calculating a set of Summations:**    Focus on one face, say a. The edges connected to face a are: a+b, a+c, a+d, and a+e. Now, let's total the four edges around a:    [    (a + b) + (a + c) + (a + d) + (a + e)    ]    This gives:    [    4a + b + c + d + e    ]     4. **Subtracting Opposite Edge Sums:**    Each face is adjacent to 4 edges and opposite edges. You also know the sums of two edges that don’t share a face with a but meet at vertices joining a e.g. (b + d) and (c + e). Now consider the following calculations:    [    4a + b + c + d + e - (b + d) - (c + e)    ]    This simplifies to:    [    4a    ] 5. **Solving for a:**    Divide the equation by 4 to isolate a:    [    a = frac{4a}{4} = a    ] 6. **Generalization:**    By similar logic, you can isolate b, c, d, e, and f in the same manner. Therefore, while knowing the sums on the edges, one can effectively deduce the numbers on each face by repeatedly using the summation and subtraction. **Conclusion:**    [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let (mathbb{Q}_{+}) be the set of positive rational numbers.

The common denominator for 5 and 3 is 15:    [    frac{1}{5}x = frac{3}{15}x, quad frac{1}{3}x = frac{5}{15}x    ] 5. Substitute these fractions back into the equation:    [    frac{3}{15}x + frac{5}{15}x + 3 left( frac{5}{15}x - frac{3}{15}x right) + 1 = x     ] 6. Simplify inside the parentheses:    [    left( frac{5}{15}x - frac{3}{15}x right) = frac{2}{15}x     ] 7. Multiply the difference by 3:    [    3 left( frac{2}{15}x right) = frac{6}{15}x     ] 8. Add all the fractions on the left side of the equation:    [    frac{3}{15}x + frac{5}{15}x + frac{6}{15}x + 1 = x     ]    [    left( frac{3}{15} + frac{5}{15} + frac{6}{15} right)x + 1 = x     ] 9. Combine the fractions:    [    frac{3+5+6}{15}x + 1 = x     ]    [    frac{14}{15}x + 1 = x     ] 10. To isolate ( x ), subtract (frac{14}{15}x) from both sides:     [     frac{14}{15}x + 1 - frac{14}{15}x = x - frac{14}{15}x      ]     [     1 = frac{1}{15}x      ] 11.

First, we calculate how many sweets the mother kept for herself. Since she kept 1/3 of the sweets, we have: [ frac{1}{3} times 27 = 9 ] So, the mother kept 9 sweets. 2. Next, we determine how many sweets were left for the children. Since the mother kept 9 sweets out of 27, the number of sweets left is: [ 27 - 9 = 18 ] Thus, there were 18 sweets to be divided among the 3 children. 3. The youngest child got half as many sweets as the eldest, who got 8 sweets. Therefore, the youngest got: [ frac{8}{2} = 4 ] So, the youngest child received 4 sweets. 4. To find out how many sweets the eldest and the youngest got together, we add their sweets: [ 8 + 4 = 12 ] Hence, the eldest and the youngest got a total of 12 sweets together. 5. Finally, to find out how many sweets the second child got, we subtract the total sweets the eldest and youngest got from the total sweets available for the children: [ 18 - 12 = 6 ] Therefore, the second child got 6 sweets.

Given the equation: [ frac{cos alpha cos frac{beta}{2}}{cos left(alpha - frac{beta}{2}right)} + frac{cos beta cos frac{alpha}{2}}{cos left(beta - frac{alpha}{2}right)} = 1, ] we can use the sum-to-product identities for cosine to simplify the terms in the equation. 2. We start with the first term: [ frac{cos alpha cos frac{beta}{2}}{cos left(alpha - frac{beta}{2}right)} ] We use the sum and difference identities: [ cos(x pm y) = cos x cos y mp sin x sin y ] Thus: [ cos left(alpha mp frac{beta}{2}right) = cos alpha cos frac{beta}{2} pm sin alpha sin frac{beta}{2} ] So: [ cos left(alpha + frac{beta}{2}right) + cos left(alpha - frac{beta}{2}right) = 2 cos alpha cos frac{beta}{2} ] Therefore, the first term becomes: [ frac{cos left(alpha + frac{beta}{2}right) + cos left(alpha - frac{beta}{2}right)}{cos left(alpha - frac{beta}{2}right)} ] 3. Similarly, we apply the sum-to-product identities to the second term: [ frac{cos beta cos frac{alpha}{2}}{cos left(beta - frac{alpha}{2}right)} ] Thus: [ cos left(beta pm frac{alpha}{2}right) = cos beta cos frac{alpha}{2} mp sin beta sin frac{alpha}{2} ] So: [ cos left(beta + frac{alpha}{2}right) + cos left(beta - frac{alpha}{2}right) = 2 cos beta cos frac{alpha}{2} ] Therefore, the second term becomes: [ frac{cos left(beta + frac{alpha}{2}right) + cos left(beta - frac{alpha}{2}right)}{cos left(beta - frac{alpha}{2}right)} ] 4.

Prove that these parts cannot be equal figures.","output":"1. **Initial Setup**:     Let us consider a scalene triangle (ABC). We need to prove that the triangle cannot be divided into two equal parts. For simplicity, assume that the triangle is divided by a line segment (AD), intersecting side (BC) at point (D), resulting in two smaller triangles, (ABD) and (ADC). 2. **Case Analysis (Angle Equality)**:    Suppose the triangles (ABD) and (ADC) are equal in area and share a common vertex (A).    - **Case 1**: ( angle B = angle C )      - For ( angle B ) to be equal to ( angle C ), triangle (ABC) must be isosceles with (AB = AC). However, since (ABC) is a scalene triangle by hypothesis, this assumption leads to a contradiction. Hence, ( angle B neq angle C). 3. **Isosceles Triangle Condition**:        Suppose an isosceles triangle (ADC) is formed with (AD = DC).    - **Case 2**: ( angle CAD = angle ADB )      - If (AD) divides ( angle BAC ) such that ( angle CAD = angle ADB ), it implies that (AD = DC) because ( C widehat{A} = D widehat{A}). This means triangle (ADC) would be isosceles. Since (ADC) is given to be part of a scalene triangle (ABC), this again leads to a contradiction.        - **Case 3**: ( angle ABD = angle ADC )      - If ( angle ABD = angle ADC ), then (AB = AC), implying that (ABC) is not scalene, which again contradicts the given condition.  4. **Conclusion**:    In all possible cases where triangles (ABD) and (ADC) are assumed to be of equal area, we end up contradicting the initial condition that triangle (ABC) is scalene. Therefore, it is impossible for a scalene triangle to be divided into two equal triangles by a single line segment. Thus, it is proved that the two parts cannot be equal triangular figures when divided by a line segment in a scalene triangle.

From 2y = 5z, we know that y must be a multiple of 5. 3. From 7x = 4y, we know that y must also be a multiple of 7. 4. Therefore, y must be a multiple of 35. 5. Since Xiaoming divided the money into two piles with equal amounts, each pile contains about 250 to 300 cents. 6.

Indeed,      [      1^m + 1 = 2 text { divides } (1+1)^n = 2^n      ]      So ((a, m, n) = (1, m, n)) is a solution for any positive integers (m) and (n).    - Similarly, if (m = 1) for any (a) and (n), then      [      a^1 + 1 = a + 1 text { divides } (a+1)^n      ]      So ((a, 1, n)) is a solution for any positive integers (a) and (n). 2. **Contradictions for the case when (a > 1) and (m > 1):**    - Suppose (a > 1) and (m > 1). We need to show (m) is odd.    - Suppose there exists an odd prime (p) dividing (a^m + 1). This means (p) must also divide ((a+1)^n) and hence ((a+1)).      - Since (p) divides (a+1), (a equiv -1 pmod{p}).      - Hence,        [        a^m + 1 equiv (-1)^m + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p}        ]        implying ((-1)^m equiv -1 pmod{p}), thus (m) is odd. 3. **Handling powers of two:**    - If no such prime (p) divides (a^m + 1), then (a^m + 1) must be a power of 2, say (2^k).    - Given (a > 1) and (m ge 2), we have (a^m + 1 ge 5). Thus (k ge 3).    - Note that (a^m equiv -1 pmod{4}). Since squares modulo 4 can only be 0 or 1, (a^m) cannot be a square, hence (m) must be odd.    4. **Considering primes (p) dividing (m):**    - Let (p) be a prime dividing (m). Because (m) is odd, (a^p + 1) divides (a^m + 1) and ((a+1)^n), implying ((a+1)) also divides (a^p + 1).    - Define (f(x) = x^{p-1} - x^{p-2} + x^{p-3} - cdots - x + 1). Then:      [      f(-1) = p      ]      and      [      f(a) = frac{a^p + 1}{a + 1}.      ]      Put (f(a) = (a+1)g(a) + p). If a prime (q) divides (f(a)), it must also divide ((a+1)), implying (q = p). Therefore, (f(a) = p^k) for some (k ge 1).     5. **Determination of (k):**    - We want to show that (k = 1). If (p^2) divides ((a+1)), then:      [      f(a) = (a + 1)g(a) + p implies p^2 text{ does not divide } f(a).      ]      - If (p^2) does not divide ((a+1)), assume ((a+1) = ph), with (h) not divisible by (p). Then:        [        f(a) = a^{p-1} + 1 = ((a + ph - 1)^p)/ph = p        ]        implying again that (p^2) does not divide (f(a)). Thus (f(a) = p). 6. **Specific computations:**    - For (p = 3), (a^2 - a + 1 = 3) gives (a = 2). 7. **Checking powers of three:**    - Suppose (m) must be a power of 3. Expanding,      [      2^9 + 1 = 513 quad text{is not a power of 3 and cannot divide } (2+1)^n.      ]    - Similarly, (2^{27}+1, 2^{81}+1, ldots) are also not powers of 3.

The store is offering a 25% off sale on all cooking gear. Eve will spend 135 on the gifts. How much do the hand mitts cost?","output":"Let's denote the cost of the hand mitts as ( M ). The small knife costs twice the amount of the utensils, so it costs ( 2 times 10 = 20.00 ). Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount: - Apron: 16.00 - Set of 3 cooking utensils: 10.00 - Small knife: 20.00 The total cost for one niece is ( M + 16 + 10 + 20 ). Since Eve has 3 nieces, the total cost for all three nieces is ( 3 times (M + 16 + 10 + 20) ). Now, let's apply the 25% discount. The total cost after the discount is ( 0.75 times 3 times (M + 16 + 10 + 20) ). We know that Eve will spend 135 on the gifts, so we can set up the equation: ( 0.75 times 3 times (M + 16 + 10 + 20) = 135 ) Simplify the equation: ( 0.75 times 3 times (M + 46) = 135 ) ( 2.25 times (M + 46) = 135 ) Divide both sides by 2.25: ( M + 46 = frac{135}{2.25} ) ( M + 46 = 60 ) Subtract 46 from both sides: ( M = 60 - 46 ) ( M = 14 ) Therefore, the hand mitts cost boxed{14.00} ."},{"instruction":"A polynomial  f(x)  with integer coefficients is said to be *tridivisible* if  3  divides  f(k)  for any integer  k . Determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to be tridivisible.","output":"1. **Definition and Initial Setup**:    A polynomial ( f(x) ) with integer coefficients is said to be *tri-divisible* if ( 3 ) divides ( f(k) ) for any integer ( k ). We need to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to be tri-divisible. 2. **Polynomial Representation**:    Consider a polynomial ( f(x) ) of degree ( n ) with integer coefficients. We can write:    [    f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0    ]    where ( a_i in mathbb{Z} ) for all ( i ). 3. **Tri-Divisibility Condition**:    For ( f(x) ) to be tri-divisible, ( 3 ) must divide ( f(k) ) for any integer ( k ). This implies that ( f(x) equiv 0 pmod{3} ) for all ( x in mathbb{Z} ). 4. **Polynomial Modulo 3**:    Consider the polynomial modulo 3:    [    f(x) equiv a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 pmod{3}    ]    For ( f(x) equiv 0 pmod{3} ) for all ( x in mathbb{Z} ), each coefficient ( a_i ) must be divisible by 3. Hence, ( a_i equiv 0 pmod{3} ) for all ( i ). 5. **Necessary and Sufficient Condition**:    Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for ( f(x) ) to be tri-divisible is that all coefficients of ( f(x) ) are divisible by 3. This can be written as:    [    f(x) = 3g(x)    ]    where ( g(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. 6. **General Form**:    To express this in a more general form, we can write:    [    f(x) = x(x-1)(x-2)Q(x) + 3(ax^2 + bx + c)    ]    where ( Q(x) in mathbb{Z}[x] ) and ( a, b, c in mathbb{Z} ). This form ensures that ( f(x) ) is tri-divisible because the term ( x(x-1)(x-2) ) is always divisible by 3 for any integer ( x ), and the remaining part ( 3(ax^2 + bx + c) ) is clearly divisible by 3. Conclusion: The necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial ( f(x) ) with integer coefficients to be tri-divisible is that all its coefficients are divisible by 3. This can be expressed as: [ boxed{f(x) = x(x-1)(x-2)Q(x) + 3(ax^2 + bx + c)} ] where ( Q(x) in mathbb{Z}[x] ) and ( a, b, c in mathbb{Z} )."},{"instruction":"Let s be the set of all positive integers that, when divided by a certain number, have a remainder of 5.

We are given that the 75th number in the set is 597. This means that when k = 74 (since we start counting from 0), n = 597. So we have: 597 = 74d + 5 Now, we can solve for d: 597 - 5 = 74d 592 = 74d d = 592 / 74 d = 8 Therefore, the divisor is boxed{8} ."},{"instruction":"Pat, Kate, and Mark charged a certain number of hours to a project.

Let's identify the line in question, assuming the claim is correct. To do this, we'll consider point M in three specific positions.  **Case I:** If M coincides with A_1, the first perpendicular line will be m. Since m passes through C, the second perpendicular's fixed point, we do not need to draw the second perpendicular. In this setup, N_{mathrm{I}} coincides with C. **Case II:** Similarly, if M is at C, the second perpendicular coincides with m. In this case, N_{mathrm{II}} coincides with A_1. Hence, N_{mathrm{I}} and N_{mathrm{II}} are reflections of each other across the perpendicular bisector e of segment A_1C. Note that E, the fixed point of the circles, also lies on this line. The radii of the two circles are equal, and they have two common tangents, AD and another line obtained by translating AD by the vector overrightarrow{BC}. **Case III:** Consider M at the intersection of lines m and e. In this case, the directions of lines M_{mathrm{III}}A and M_{mathrm{III}}D determine perpendicular bisectors that are also symmetric about e. Thus, N_{mathrm{III}} lies on e.

We know that 64 single rooms were booked, so the total amount made from single rooms is ( 64 times 35 ) dollars. Now, let's calculate the total number of double rooms booked. Since there were 260 rooms booked in total and 64 of them were single rooms, the number of double rooms booked is ( 260 - 64 ). The total amount made from double rooms is then ( (260 - 64) times x ) dollars.

Given an n-sided regular polygon S, we need to find the smallest natural number n such that when any set of 5 vertices of S are colored red, there will always be an axis of symmetry l of S that ensures each red point does not have its symmetric counterpart on l also colored red. 2. **Initial Investigation:**    - Consider a regular 13-sided polygon (n = 13). We note that:      - If we color the vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{4}, A_{6}, A_{7} red, then by examining all 13 symmetry axes, none satisfy the condition (no axis preserves this symmetry such that red points do not align symmetrically).      - Similarly, for n = 12, 11, 10, choosing any 5 vertices as red also does not satisfy the condition.       - For n leq 9, it is evident that the conclusion does not hold due to the reduced number of possible symmetrical configurations.      Hence, we infer that for n = 13 and all smaller values, the required condition is not satisfied. 3. **Analysis for n geq 14:**    - Draw a regular 14-sided polygon and consider its symmetry axes. Each side of the polygon defines a set of parallel lines, each such set contains one symmetry axis. There are in total 14 axes, with 7 axes passing through pairs of opposite vertices and 7 being the vertical bisectors of opposite sides.    - Examining the configuration, if there is any selection of 5 red vertices that does not meet the condition, then at least one of the 7 symmetry axes passing through opposite vertices will separate the polygon such that each set of red points does not have its symmetric counterpart also red. 4. **Argument with Parallel Lines and Cherries:**    - Label the 14 vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{14}.    - Consider the axis of symmetry lines. Note that:      - 7 lines are bisectors through opposite vertices.      - 7 lines are vertical bisectors through opposite edges.      A set of 5 red points evaluated within these constraints must be tested across all these axes. 5. **Pigeonhole Principle and Symmetric Pairs Containing Red Points:**    - Denote a red point configuration by r_1, r_2, ldots, r_5 with indices i. Let m represent the number of odd-indexed red vertices and 5-m for even-indexed ones.      Thus, the number of connections between odd and even indexed vertices (forming lines) is:      [      m(5 - m) leq 6      ]      Therefore, there are at most 6 lines connecting any red points. 6. **Ensuring at Least One Valid Axis:**    - Given that there are 7 lines separating opposite vertices, at least one line will not be a horizontal separator for any one connecting line of red vertices. Therefore, for n geq 14:      At least 1 axis of symmetry always ensures the above condition. # Conclusion: [ n = 14 ] Hence, the smallest natural number n such that any set of 5 red vertices of an n-sided regular polygon ensures there is always an axis of symmetry where no red vertex is symmetrically opposite another red vertex is: [ boxed{14} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that the radius of sphere O is 1, the surface area of sphere O is ______.","output":"Since the radius r=1,   the surface area of the sphere is 4pi r^2 = 4pi.

The total distance of the race is 10 kilometers, which is equal to 10,000 meters. After running for x minutes, Xiao Ming has 10,000 - 200x meters left to run. 3. When Xiao Ming finds Xiao Li 200 meters ahead of him, the distance Xiao Ming has left to run becomes 10,000 - 200x - 200 meters, because he needs to cover the 200 meters to catch up to Xiao Li plus the remaining distance. 4. From this point, Xiao Ming runs at a speed of 250 meters per minute, and Xiao Li runs at a speed of 300 meters per minute. To express the time it takes for each of them to finish the race from this point, we divide the remaining distance by their respective speeds. 5. For Xiao Ming, the time to finish is frac{10,000 - 200x - 200}{250} minutes. For Xiao Li, since he starts from 200 meters ahead but without the need to cover these additional 200 meters, the time to finish is frac{10,000 - 200x}{300} minutes. 6. Since Xiao Ming won the race, the time it took him to finish must be less than the time it took Xiao Li. Therefore, we have the inequality: frac{10,000 - 200x - 200}{250} > frac{10,000 - 200x}{300}.

The negation of this proposition is that for all a in the range -1leqslant a leqslant 3, the inequality ax^{2}-left(2a-1right)x+3-a geqslant 0 must be true. This can be rewritten as: [ (x^{2}-2x+1)a + (x+3) geqslant 0 ] This inequality must hold for all a in the interval [-1,3]. We then examine the inequality for the boundary values of a: 1. For a = -1, the inequality becomes: [ -left(x^{2}-2x+1right) + (x+3) geqslant 0 ] [ -x^{2} + 2x - 1 + x + 3 geqslant 0 ] [ -x^{2} + 3x + 2 geqslant 0 ] Solving the quadratic equation -x^{2} + 3x + 2 = 0 gives x = -1 or x = 2. Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the inequality -x^{2} + 3x + 2 geqslant 0 holds between the roots, leading to -1 leqslant x leqslant 2.  2.

Therefore, option A does not definitively satisfy the condition for parallelism. - **Option B**: If line a is in plane alpha, line b is in plane beta, and a is parallel to beta, while b is parallel to alpha, this suggests that both planes could either intersect along these lines or be parallel. Similar to option A, this does not exclusively indicate that the planes are parallel, as intersection is also a plausible scenario.

Given (f(t) = x sin t + y cos t), we have:    [    int_{-pi}^pi f(t) cos t , dt = int_{-pi}^pi (x sin t + y cos t) cos t , dt    ]    This can be split into two integrals:    [    int_{-pi}^pi x sin t cos t , dt + int_{-pi}^pi y cos^2 t , dt    ] 2. Evaluate the first integral:    [    int_{-pi}^pi x sin t cos t , dt = x int_{-pi}^pi sin t cos t , dt    ]    Using the trigonometric identity (sin t cos t = frac{1}{2} sin 2t), we get:    [    x int_{-pi}^pi frac{1}{2} sin 2t , dt = frac{x}{2} int_{-pi}^pi sin 2t , dt    ]    Since (sin 2t) is an odd function, its integral over ([- pi, pi]) is zero:    [    frac{x}{2} int_{-pi}^pi sin 2t , dt = 0    ] 3. Evaluate the second integral:    [    int_{-pi}^pi y cos^2 t , dt = y int_{-pi}^pi cos^2 t , dt    ]    Using the identity (cos^2 t = frac{1 + cos 2t}{2}), we get:    [    y int_{-pi}^pi frac{1 + cos 2t}{2} , dt = frac{y}{2} int_{-pi}^pi (1 + cos 2t) , dt    ]    The integral of (cos 2t) over ([- pi, pi]) is zero, so:    [    frac{y}{2} int_{-pi}^pi 1 , dt = frac{y}{2} cdot 2pi = ypi    ] 4. Therefore, we have:    [    int_{-pi}^pi f(t) cos t , dt = ypi    ] 5. Next, we need to evaluate the integral (int_{-pi}^pi [f(t)]^2 , dt):    [    int_{-pi}^pi [f(t)]^2 , dt = int_{-pi}^pi (x sin t + y cos t)^2 , dt    ]    Expanding the square, we get:    [    int_{-pi}^pi (x^2 sin^2 t + 2xy sin t cos t + y^2 cos^2 t) , dt    ] 6. Evaluate each term separately:    [    int_{-pi}^pi x^2 sin^2 t , dt = x^2 int_{-pi}^pi sin^2 t , dt    ]    Using the identity (sin^2 t = frac{1 - cos 2t}{2}), we get:    [    x^2 int_{-pi}^pi frac{1 - cos 2t}{2} , dt = frac{x^2}{2} int_{-pi}^pi (1 - cos 2t) , dt = frac{x^2}{2} cdot 2pi = x^2 pi    ] 7. The second term:    [    int_{-pi}^pi 2xy sin t cos t , dt = 2xy int_{-pi}^pi sin t cos t , dt = 0    ]    (as shown earlier) 8. The third term:    [    int_{-pi}^pi y^2 cos^2 t , dt = y^2 int_{-pi}^pi cos^2 t , dt    ]    Using the identity (cos^2 t = frac{1 + cos 2t}{2}), we get:    [    y^2 int_{-pi}^pi frac{1 + cos 2t}{2} , dt = frac{y^2}{2} int_{-pi}^pi (1 + cos 2t) , dt = frac{y^2}{2} cdot 2pi = y^2 pi    ] 9. Therefore, we have:    [    int_{-pi}^pi [f(t)]^2 , dt = x^2 pi + y^2 pi = pi (x^2 + y^2)    ] 10. The given inequality is:     [     left| int_{-pi}^pi f(t) cos t , dt right| leq int_{-pi}^pi [f(t)]^2 , dt     ]     Substituting the evaluated integrals, we get:     [     |ypi| leq pi (x^2 + y^2)     ]     Dividing both sides by (pi), we obtain:     [     |y| leq x^2 + y^2     ] 11. To find the domain of ((x, y)) that satisfies this inequality, we rearrange it:     [     x^2 + y^2 geq |y|     ]     This can be written as:     [     x^2 + y^2 geq y quad text{and} quad x^2 + y^2 geq -y     ] 12. For (x^2 + y^2 geq y):     [     x^2 + y^2 - y geq 0 implies x^2 + (y - frac{1}{2})^2 geq frac{1}{4}     ] 13. For (x^2 + y^2 geq -y):     [     x^2 + y^2 + y geq 0 implies x^2 + (y + frac{1}{2})^2 geq frac{1}{4}     ] 14. The domain of ((x, y)) is the union of the regions defined by these inequalities. This represents the area outside the circles centered at ((0, pm frac{1}{2})) with radius (frac{1}{2}). The final answer is ( boxed{ x^2 + left(y - frac{1}{2}right)^2 geq frac{1}{4} } ) and (x^2 + left(y + frac{1}{2}right)^2 geq frac{1}{4})."},{"instruction":"acute triangle triangle ABC, the opposite sides of A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Since cos B = 0 leads to B = frac{pi}{2}, which contradicts the triangle being acute, we discard this case. Therefore, we have: [ tan A = sqrt{3} ] Given that 0 < A < frac{pi}{2}, we conclude: [ A = frac{pi}{3} ] So, the solution for part (1) is boxed{A = frac{pi}{3}}.  Part (2): Maximum value of height AD From part (1), we know cos A = frac{1}{2}. Using the cosine rule, we express cos A as: [ cos A = frac{1}{2} = frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc} = frac{(b+c)^2-2bc-a^2}{2bc} = frac{36-2bc-a^2}{2bc} ] Simplifying, we find: [ a^2 = 36 - 3bc ] Given the area formula S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}bcsin A = frac{1}{2}a cdot AD, we express AD as: [ AD = frac{sqrt{3}bc}{2a} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ AD^2 = frac{3(bc)^2}{4a^2} = frac{3(bc)^2}{4(36-3bc)} ] Using the AM-GM inequality, b+c geq 2sqrt{bc}, we find bc leq 9 with equality when b=c=3. Thus: [ AD^2 = frac{3(bc)^2}{4(36-3bc)} leq frac{3}{4left(frac{36}{9^2}-frac{3}{9}right)} = frac{27}{4} ] Therefore, the maximum value of AD is boxed{AD leq frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}}."},{"instruction":"A batsman makes a score of 100 runs in the 11th inning and thus increases his average by 5.

This means that up to the 10th inning, the batsman scored a total of 10A runs (since average = total runs / number of innings). After scoring 100 runs in the 11th inning, the batsman's new average becomes A + 5. The total runs scored after the 11th inning is the previous total plus the 100 runs scored in the 11th inning, which is 10A + 100. The new average (A + 5) is now calculated over 11 innings, so we have: New average (A + 5) = (Total runs after 11th inning) / 11 A + 5 = (10A + 100) / 11 Now, we solve for A: 11(A + 5) = 10A + 100 11A + 55 = 10A + 100 11A - 10A = 100 - 55 A = 45 So, the average before the 11th inning was 45.

Our task is to determine if this process will always terminate after a finite number of steps. Let's proceed step by step. 1. **Define the Problem and the Operation**:    - Let (a, b, c, d, e) be the integers assigned to the vertices of the pentagon.    - The specific operation allowed is: If three consecutive vertices have numbers (x, y, z) (with (y < 0)), replace (x, y, z) by (x + y, -y, z + y) respectively. 2. **Initial Assumption and Target**:    - Sum of all five numbers is positive: (a + b + c + d + e > 0).    - The goal is to determine if this operation necessarily comes to an end after a finite number of steps. 3. **Define a Measure (S) to Track Progress**:    - Define ( S ) as the sum of the absolute values of the vertices:       [      S = |a| + |b| + |c| + |d| + |e|      ] 4. **Analyze the Effect of the Operation on (S)**:    - Consider the operation applied to three numbers (x, y, z):      - Before the operation: ( S_{text{before}} = |x| + |y| + |z| )      - After the operation: The new numbers at the vertices are (x + y), (-y), and (z + y). Thus,        [        S_{text{after}} = |x + y| + |-y| + |z + y|        ]    - Calculate how (S) changes:      - If (|x + y| > |x| + |y|), it implies a reduction since (|-y|) reduces to (|y|).      - Since (|-y| = |y|), there's no change.      - If (|z + y| > |z| + |y|), it implies a reduction in (|y|). 5. **Tracking Sum of Changes in Absolute Values**:    - Collectively for all five vertices, ( S ) tends to generally reduce since ( y ) is negative:      - Before: (|a| + |b| + |c| + |d| + |e|).      - After: Some change where minimally (|b|) flips to (|-b|) since (b) is negative, reducing its absolute summed effect. 6. **Alternative Measure (T)**:    - Define another measure (T) using pairwise differences squared:      [      T = (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 + (c - e)^2 + (d - a)^2 + (e - b)^2      ]    - After replacing (a, b, c) by (a + b, -b, b + c):      - (T' = T + 2b(a + b + c + d + e)).    - Given (b < 0) and (a + b + c + d + e > 0), (2b(a + b + c + d + e) < 0), implying (T') is reduced after each operation. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Since both (S) and (T) are strictly decreasing functions bounded below by zero (they cannot be less than zero), the operations will terminate after a finite number of steps.

With two players giving coins each round, and one receiving, maintaining balance becomes complex. 4. **Calculating Round Transitions**:    - Probability that any specific player ends up drawing the red ball is frac{1}{4}, two players draw the green ball is binom{3}{2}cdot frac{1}{3} for the first green and frac{1}{2} for the second, multiplied by the ways to choose the two from three.    - This results in frac{1}{4} times frac{3}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{8} chance per round for any specific pair to give a coin to a specific player. 5. **Evaluating Overall Effect**:    - Since two coins are given out but only one received per round, and there are 5 rounds, each player needs to be the receiver in exactly 2.5 rounds (on average), which is not possible with whole number rounds.

The task is to determine if it's always possible to reduce one dimension of the enclosing box when the dimensions of the parallelepipeds are slightly reduced. We provide a counterexample to illustrate that it's not always possible. 1. **Construct the Example:**     - Start with a box of dimensions 2 times 2 times 3.     - Place inside it two bricks (rectangular parallelepipeds) each with dimensions 1 times 2 times 3.     This arrangement is possible because both bricks can fit side by side in the original box by aligning the 2 times 3 sides along with the 2 times 3 face of the box. 2. **Modify the Dimensions:**     - Slightly reduce one dimension for each brick as follows:         - For the first brick, reduce the length (3) to a slightly smaller value.         - For the second brick, reduce the width (2) to a slightly smaller value.     This would result in one brick having dimensions just less than 1 times 2 times 3 and the other just less than 1 times 2 times 3 but with different dimensions tweaked. 3. **Evaluate the Effect on the Box:**     - Since the second brick still has one dimension equal to 3 (which is slightly less than before but still around 3), you cannot reduce the height of the box which is 3.     - Since both bricks have a depth greater than 2, they must be placed vertically; you cannot reduce the width of the box which is 2 either.     - Thus, the vertical spaces may force the bricks to still occupy the entire box depth-wise and height-wise, and changing the orientation does not help. 4. **Conclusion:**     - As the dimensions have been reduced in a specific way, rearranging or reducing any dimension of the box to a smaller size while ensuring all bricks fit inside perfectly is not feasible.     - This shows that not in every scenario can one of the dimensions of the enclosing box be reduced even if the components are reduced slightly.

If A misses, B takes the second shot. - The probability of B shooting first and missing is 0.5 times (1 - 0.8) = 0.5 times 0.2 = 0.1.

In the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, y=mx+b, the b represents the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Determine the possible values of a**:   Given a in {a^{2}-a, 0}, we understand that a can either be equal to a^{2}-a or 0. Thus, we have two scenarios:   - a = 0 - a = a^{2} - a 2. **Solve for a in each scenario**:   - For a = 0: This is a straightforward solution. - For a = a^{2} - a: Rearranging the equation gives us a^{2} - 2a = 0, which can be factored as a(a-2) = 0. This yields two solutions, a = 0 and a = 2. 3. **Verify the distinctiveness of set elements**:   Given the set {a^{2}-a, 0}, we need distinct elements for a to adhere to the definition of a set. Since a = 0 is already an element of the set, choosing a = 0 from the equation a = a^{2} - a does not provide a new distinct element. Thus, we discard a = 0 as a valid solution from the equation a = a^{2} - a. 4. **Conclude the value of a**:   After discarding a = 0 as discussed, we are left with a = 2 as the valid solution that satisfies the given condition and ensures the distinctiveness of the set elements.

Let's denote the total work as W. Band A can complete the work in 11 days, so the work done by A in one day is W/11. Band B can complete the work in 20 days, so the work done by B in one day is W/20. Band C can complete the work in 55 days, so the work done by C in one day is W/55. Now, let's consider the work done when A is assisted by B and C on alternate days. On the first day, A and B work together, so the work done is (W/11 + W/20). On the second day, A and C work together, so the work done is (W/11 + W/55). Let's calculate the work done in two days when A is assisted by B on the first day and by C on the second day: Work done in two days = (W/11 + W/20) + (W/11 + W/55) = 2W/11 + W/20 + W/55 To find a common denominator, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of 11, 20, and 55, which is 220.

We're told that m is a natural number greater than 0 (m in N^*) and 1 leq m leq 10. To find out how many elements M has based on the number of subsets, we use the formula for the number of subsets a set with n elements has, which is 2^n. In this case, we know the number of subsets (8), so we set up the equation 2^n = 8. Solving for n gives us n = 3 because 2^3 = 8. This means that the set M has three elements. Since M is defined based on m and n where x = frac{m}{n}, and n in N^*, this implies that m must have exactly three factors: 1, m itself, and exactly one other factor besides 1 and m. This is because each element of M corresponds to a different factor of m. Given 1 leq m leq 10, we can list the numbers in this range and identify which have exactly three factors. The numbers with exactly three factors (including 1 and the number itself) are 4 and 9. This is because: - 4 has factors 1, 2, and 4. - 9 has factors 1, 3, and 9.

Hence, option B is incorrect. 4. **Analyzing Option C**:    - From the initial condition P(N|M) > P(N|overline{M}), we can derive:      [      frac{P(NM)}{P(M)} > frac{P(N) - P(NM)}{1 - P(M)}      ]      Simplifying, we find that:      [      P(NM) > P(N) cdot P(M)      ]      Thus, option C is correct:      [      boxed{C: P(NM) > P(N) cdot P(M)}      ] 5. **Analyzing Option D**:    - From the derived inequality P(NM) > P(N) cdot P(M), we can further deduce that:      [      frac{P(NM)}{P(N)} > frac{P(overline{N}M)}{P(overline{N})}      ]      This implies:      [      P(M|N) > P(M|overline{N})      ]      Therefore, option D is also correct:      [      boxed{D: P(M|N) > P(M|overline{N})}      ] **Conclusion**: The correct options, based on the given information and the step-by-step analysis, are A, C, and D.

The sides of this resulting rectangle will be equal to the longest and shortest diagonals of the octagon.     2. **Side Lengths of the Rectangle**:    - We know from geometry that the sides of the rectangle formed by the reassembled triangles are precisely the lengths of the largest diagonal ((d_{b})) and the smallest diagonal ((d_{c})) of the octagon.  3. **Diagonal Lengths in a Regular Octagon**:    - For a regular polygon with ( n ) sides, the length of a diagonal, ( d_{k} ), is given by the formula:      [      d_{k} = 2R cdot sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right)      ]      where ( R ) is the circumradius of the polygon, and ( k ) is the number of sides extended by the diagonal. 4. **Calculating the Largest Diagonal**:    - For a regular octagon (( n = 8 )):      The longest diagonal (( d_{b} )) extends across 4 vertices:      [      d_{b} = 2R cdot sinleft(frac{4pi}{8}right) = 2R cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 2R cdot 1 = 2R      ]     5. **Calculating the Smallest Diagonal**:    - The shortest diagonal (( d_{c} )) extends across 1 vertex:      [      d_{c} = 2R cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{8}right)      ] 6. **Area of the Rectangle**:    - The area of the rectangle is the product of the lengths of its sides:      [      text{Area of the rectangle} = d_{b} times d_{c} = 2R cdot left(2R cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{8}right)right) = 2R cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{8}right) cdot 2R      ] 7. **Conclusion**:     The area of the regular octagon is, therefore:    [    R^2 cdot 4 cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{8}right)    ]    This demonstrates that the area of the regular octagon is indeed the product of its largest and smallest diagonal lengths.    boxed"},{"instruction":"Fred has 110 blue marbles.

Let's consider how the sequence evolves:     - (x_3 = |x_2 - x_1|)     - (x_4 = |x_3 - x_2|), and so on.     Clearly, the values of subsequent elements in the sequence depend on these initial two values and will gradually decrease or repeat. 3. **Determining the value sequence:**     To ensure none of the sequence values exceed 1998, the largest element of the sequence, if exists, must be among the first two elements. Let's analyze various cases based on the starting values to find sequences of maximum lengths. We use known results about function (f(n,m)) to shorten the verification process: 4. **Case computations:**     - When starting values are derived cleverly, the following formulae hold by induction (details omitted for brevity, but are derived through similar methods):         - (f(1, 2n) = f(2n-1, 2n) = 3n+1)         - (f(2n, 1) = f(2n, 2n-1) = 3n)         - (f(2n, 2n+1) = 3n+3)         - (f(1, 2n+1) = f(2n+1, 1) = 3n+2)         - (f(2n+1, 2n) = 3n+1) 5. **Analyzing the largest valid starting values:**     Given the largest sequence value allowed is 1998, we consider the sequences starting with high values close to the limit.     - Start with (x_1 = 1) and (x_2 = 1998):         - (x_3 = |1998 - 1| = 1997)         - (x_4 = |1997 - 1998| = 1)         - (x_5 = |1 - 1997| = 1996)         - and so forth. 6. **General length verification:**     Using the results from sequences that have proved efficient in previous tests, the longest sequence when (x_1 = 1) and (x_2 = 1998) results in:     - (f(1, 1998) = 2998) (this length maximum derives from pattern-derivation via inductive stronger results). 7. **Conclusion:**    Combining the theoretical findings from inductive cases and sequences derived above, the longest sequence length for the given constraints is achieved by setting (x_1 = 1) and (x_2 = 1998).

Since 250 milliliters were spilled, we add that to the total amount of water poured for the players: 6000 milliliters + 250 milliliters = 6250 milliliters Finally, we need to add the leftover water to find out the initial amount of water the coach had.

Here, S_i = A_iB_i represents the interval on the OX-axis where the cuboid projects.      5. **Examining the Hypothetical Intervals:**     - Let's assume the following relationships based on the intervals:          - S_{1} does not intersect S_{2}: A_{1} < B_{1} < A_{2} < B_{2}         - S_{4} does not intersect S_{5}: A_{4} < B_{4} < A_{5} < B_{5}     - Further assume that S_{1} and S_{5} intersect.

Therefore, option A is boxed{text{correct}}. **For option B:** Given quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram with vertices A(5,-1), B(-1,7), and C(1,2). To find D(x,y), we use the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel, so overrightarrow{AB} = overrightarrow{DC}. Calculating overrightarrow{AB} gives us: [ overrightarrow{AB} = (-1-5, 7+1) = (-6, 8) ] Setting overrightarrow{DC} = overrightarrow{AB}, we have: [ (1-x, 2-y) = (-6, 8) ] Solving for x and y, we get: [ begin{align*} 1 - x &= -6 &Rightarrow x &= 7  2 - y &= 8 &Rightarrow y &= -6 end{align*} ] Thus, the coordinates of vertex D are (7,-6), making option B boxed{text{correct}}. **For option C:** In an equilateral triangle, the angle between any two sides is frac{pi}{3}, not the dot product of the vectors representing those sides. Therefore, option C is boxed{text{incorrect}}. **For option D:** Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,1) and |overrightarrow{b}|=4 with the angle between them being frac{pi}{4}, the projection of overrightarrow{b} onto overrightarrow{a} is calculated as: [ |overrightarrow{b}|cosleft(frac{pi}{4}right) cdot frac{overrightarrow{a}}{|overrightarrow{a}|} = 4 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{(1,1)}{sqrt{2}} = 2(1,1) = (2,2) ] Thus, the coordinates of the projection vector of overrightarrow{b} onto overrightarrow{a} are indeed (2,2), making option D boxed{text{correct}}.

Since all lengths are within the range [5, 40], and we're asked to find the number of fibers with lengths less than 20mm, we would need to look at the histogram and sum the frequencies (counts) of the fiber lengths that fall within the bins that are less than 20mm. If we denote the sum of these frequencies as N, where N represents the total count of fibers shorter than 20mm, then N would be the sum of the frequencies in the range [5, 20). Assuming we have an actual histogram, we would expect bins like [5, 10), [10, 15), [15, 20), and we would add up the number of fibers in those bins. However, without the graphic, based on the given solution, we can infer that, by analyzing the histogram, the provided answer by the original text claims that 60 out of the 100 tested fibers have lengths less than 20mm.

The winner is the one who, on their turn, places a rook such that all the squares on the board are attacked by the placed pieces. Who wins if both play optimally?","output":"To determine who will win the game if both players are playing optimally, we can analyze the symmetric strategy solution provided. 1. **Initial Setup and Objective Clarification**:     - Two boys are playing a game by placing rooks on a chessboard in turns. The player who places a rook such that all cells on the board are attacked by the placed rooks wins the game. Both players try to play optimally. 2. **Symmetric Strategy Explanation**:    - Suppose the second player uses the following strategy: he places each of his rooks symmetrically relative to the center of the board to match the rooks placed by the first player. This means that if the first player places a rook on cell ((i, j)), the second player will place his rook on cell ((9-i, 9-j)). 3. **Analysis of the Symmetric Strategy**:    - The chessboard consists of 8 rows and 8 columns, making the total number of cells 64. The central symmetry implies that for every cell ((i, j)) where a first player's rook is placed, there is a corresponding symmetric cell ((9-i, 9-j)) available for the second player.    - This symmetry ensures that every move made by the first player is mirrored by the second player on the corresponding symmetric cell, which maintains the second player's control over the board. 4. **Implementation of Strategy**:    - After the first player's move, the board will never be fully attacked, provided the second player follows his strategy.    - The reason is that there will always be a cell where the second player can place his rook that is not attacked by the first player's rook due to the symmetry. 5. **Conclusion**:    - By maintaining this strategy, the second player guarantees that the game continues until he places the final rook.    - Therefore, the second player wins by placing his last rook, such that all cells of the chessboard are attacked. Thus, by playing symmetrically, the second player ensures his victory if both players play optimally.

This is because the derivative of ln(ax) with respect to x is frac{a}{ax}=frac{1}{x}>0 for a>0, and the derivative of e^x with respect to x is e^x>0. Thus, both functions increase as x increases. 2. **Condition for Non-Negative Product**: For the product f(x)g(x)geqslant 0 to hold for all xin (0,+infty), it is necessary that f(x) and g(x) either both be non-negative or both be non-positive for all x in the domain. Given that both functions are monotonically increasing, a key point is that they must have the same zeros for the condition to be satisfied. 3. **Finding the Zeros**:    - For f(x), setting ln(ax)-1=0 gives ln(ax)=1, which implies ax=e. Solving for x, we get x=frac{e}{a}, where a>0.    - For g(x), setting e^{x}-b=0 gives e^{x}=b. Solving for x, we get x=ln(b), implying b>0 since x is real. 4. **Relating a and b**: From the zeros, we have b=e^{frac{e}{a}} for a>0. Thus, ab=acdot e^{frac{e}{a}}. Letting frac{e}{a}=t>0 gives us ab=frac{e^{t+1}}{t}. 5. **Analyzing ab**:    - Taking the derivative of g(t)=frac{e^{t+1}}{t} with respect to t, we get {g'}(t)=frac{e^{t+1}(t-1)}{t^2}. This shows that {g'}(t)<0 for 0<t<1 and {g'}(t)>0 for t>1, indicating that g(t) decreases on (0,1) and increases on (1,+infty).    - At t=1, g(t) reaches its minimum value, g(1)=e^2. 6. **Conclusion**: Since g(t) has a minimum value of e^2 at t=1, the possible range of ab is [e^{2},+infty).

Thus, we have A cap B = {x | -1 < x < 2}. # For (2) (complement_{U}B) cup P: - The complement of B in the universal set U = mathbb{R}, denoted as complement_{U}B, includes all real numbers not in B. Since B = {x | -1 < x leq 3}, complement_{U}B includes all x such that x leq -1 or x > 3. - The set P is defined as {x | x leq 0 or x geq frac{5}{2}}, which includes all real numbers less than or equal to 0 and all real numbers greater than or equal to frac{5}{2}. To find (complement_{U}B) cup P, we look for the union of complement_{U}B and P, which includes all elements that are either in complement_{U}B or in P (or in both). - The union of {x | x > 3 or x leq -1} (from complement_{U}B) and {x | x leq 0 or x geq frac{5}{2}} (from P) includes all x such that x leq 0 or x geq frac{5}{2}, since the condition x > 3 is absorbed by x geq frac{5}{2}. Thus, we have (complement_{U}B) cup P = {x | x leq 0 or x geq frac{5}{2}}. # Final Answers: (1) A cap B = boxed{{x | -1 < x < 2}}.

For the given ellipse, we identify the semi-major axis a=5, the semi-minor axis b=4, and calculate the focal length c=sqrt{a^2-b^2}=sqrt{25-16}=sqrt{9}=3. Since P and Q are points on the ellipse where a line through the center intersects, and F_{1} and F_{2} are the foci, we know that PF_{1}QF_{2} forms a parallelogram due to the equal distances |OP|=|OQ| and |OF_{1}|=|OF_{2}|=c. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal, so |QF_{2}|=|PF_{1}|. The perimeter of triangle PQF_{2} can be expressed as |PQ|+|QF_{2}|+|PF_{2}|. Since |PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|=2a, the perimeter becomes |PQ|+2a. The minimum value of |PQ| is 2b, so the minimum perimeter is 2b+2a=2cdot4+2cdot5=8+10=18.

The product of these slopes is frac{n^2}{m^2-25}=frac{400-16m^2}{25(m^2-25)}=-frac{16}{25}.

Speed of first train = 60 km/hr Speed of second train = 40 km/hr Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the lengths of the trains which are given in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (500/18) m/s Relative speed ≈ 27.78 m/s The total distance to be covered for the trains to cross each other is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 250 m + 500 m Total distance = 750 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for them to cross each other using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 750 m / 27.78 m/s Time ≈ 27 seconds So, it takes approximately boxed{27} seconds for the two trains to cross each other."},{"instruction":"The positional relationship between the line (a1)x y + a = 1 (a in mathbb{R}) and the circle x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 4y 20 = 0 is ( ) A: Intersecting B: Tangent C: Separate D: Depends on the value of a","output":"Transform the equation of the line (a-1)x - y + a = 1 (a in mathbb{R}) to get: x + y + 1 = a(x + 1), because No matter what value t takes, when x = -1, y = 0, therefore This line always passes through (-1, 0), Transform the equation of the circle into its standard form to get: (x + 1)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 25, therefore The center of the circle is (-1, -2), and the radius r = 5, because The distance d between (-1, 0) and the center of the circle (-1, -2) is 1, therefore d < r, i.e., (-1, 0) is inside the circle, Thus, the positional relationship between the line and the circle is intersecting.

The sequence of curves ( P_0, P_1, P_2, ldots ) is defined such that ( P_0 ) forms a figure with an area of ( 1 ). ( P_{k+1} ) is obtained by performing a specific operation on ( P_k ). 2. The operation involves dividing each side of ( P_k ) into three equal parts and constructing an equilateral triangle outward on the middle segment. The middle segment is then removed. Let ( S_n ) denote the area of the figure enclosed by the curve ( P_n ). (1) Finding the general term formula for the sequence ( left{ S_n right} ): 1. Start by examining ( P_0 ), which is an equilateral triangle with area ( S_0 = 1 ). 2. For ( P_0 ) with side length ( s ), each side is divided into three equal parts. The middle segment of each side is replaced by two segments forming an outward equilateral triangle. - Each side of the triangle ( P_0 ) becomes four segments in ( P_1 ). - Hence, ( P_1 ) has ( 3 times 4 = 12 ) edges. 3. Similarly, every side of ( P_1 ) becomes four segments in ( P_2 ), leading to ( P_2 ) having ( 3 times 4^2 = 48 ) edges. 4. By induction, ( P_n ) will have: [ 3 times 4^n text{ edges} ] 5.

This implies that ([f(t)] neq 0), because if ([f(t)] = 0), then ( f(t) ) would be in ([0, 1)), leading to: [ f([1] t) = f(1)[f(t)] = 0 ] contradicting the assumption that ( f(t) neq 0 ). 4. **Substitution Analysis:** With ( y = t ) and substituting ( x ) by ( a ) (an arbitrary real number): [ f([a] t) = f(a)[f(t)] ] and substituting ( x ) by ([a]): [ f([a] t) = f([a])[f(t)] ] Equating the two expressions: [ f(a)[f(t)] = f([a])[f(t)] ] Since ([f(t)] neq 0), it follows that: [ f(a) = f([a]) ] for all ( a in mathbb{R} ). 5. **Constant Function Analysis:** To show that ( f ) is constant, consider any integer ( n ). Since ( f(a) = f([a]) ), it implies for any real number ( x ), ( f(x) = f([x]) ). Therefore, we need to prove ( f ) is constant on all integers. 6. **Specific Substitution:** Set ( x = y = 0 ): [ f(0) = f(0) cdot [f(0)] ] This gives: [ 0 = f(0) (1 - [f(0)]) ] This results in two cases: - Case 1: ( f(0) = 0 ). - Case 2: ([f(0)] = 1). 7. **Case 1: ( f(0) = 0 ):** Substitute ( x = 2a ) and ( y = frac{1}{2} ): [ f([2a] cdot frac{1}{2}) = f(2a) cdot [f(frac{1}{2})] ] Since: [ f(frac{1}{2}) = f([frac{1}{2}]) = f(0) = 0 ] Thus: [ f(a) = 0 quad text{for all integers } a ] leading to ( f ) being the zero function. 8. **Case 2: ([f(0)] = 1 ):** Substitute ( y = 0 ): [ f([x] cdot 0) = f(x) cdot [f(0)] = f(x) ] Therefore: [ f(0) = f(x) quad text{for all } x in mathbb{R} ] Hence, ( f ) is a constant function where ( c in [1,2) ). # Conclusion: The solutions to the problem are: - The identically zero function: ( f(x) = 0 ). - Constant functions ( f(x) = c ) where ( [c] = 1 ).

In particular, it intersects a line ( ell' ) such that ( Y = ell cap ell' notin bigcup_{t=1}^{i-1} X_t ). Let ( Z = OX_i cap ell' ).

Additionally, by the claim, the points ( X_1, X_2, ldots, X_{p+2} ) are red. Therefore, there are at least: [ frac{1}{2}(p+1)(p+2) + (p+2) = frac{1}{2}(p+1)(p+2) + frac{2(p+2)}{2} = frac{1}{2}(p+1)(p+2 + 2) = frac{1}{2}(p+1)(p+4) = frac{1}{2}(p+2)(p+3) ] red points. 8. **Conclusion:** By induction, the set ( I ) contains at least ( frac{1}{2}(k+1)(k+2) ) red points for any ( k ) with ( 0 leq k leq n-2 ).

Let's start by testing the possibilities where each child might be telling the truth. 4. Suppose Олег is telling the truth: - If Олег is truthful, then: - Олег must be in first place (as he claimed) - He and Оля are adjacent positions, so Оля must be in second place 5. Check the truthfulness of others under this assumption: - Оля's Claim: All odd places are taken by boys. If Олег is first and Оля is second, 1st place is a boy, but 3rd place could be a girl (not necessarily contradicting here, but let's keep it). Therefore, Оля's statement could be a lie. - Паша's Claim: Names starting with 'O' are in odd places. Given 1st is Oлег and 2nd is Оля, the next odd place (3rd) should have a name starting with O, but if Паша is not telling the truth, this does not have to hold. Thus, Паша is likely lying too. 6. Given that Oлег is truthful: - Олег is 1st, - Оля is adjacent, so Оля is 2nd, - Since Оля was assumed to lie, the boy positions rule she stated is false. Thus, - 3rd can be Поля (a girl) - 4th would be Паша 7. Verification: - Олег: 1st place (truthful, as he claimed). - Оля: Is second and lies, which fits her other claim being false. - Поля: If she left right away, her position in 3rd place is also fitting, as no further claims affect her. - Паша: His odd-named rule fails since not all odd placers have names starting with O, hence he lied.

To ensure the denominator and the expression inside the square root are well-defined, observe that (1 - sqrt{1 + 2x}) must be in the domain of the inequality. - First, the term inside the square root must be non-negative: 1 + 2x geq 0 implies x geq -frac{1}{2}. - Secondly, the term (1 - sqrt{1 + 2x} neq 0). Solving (1 - sqrt{1 + 2x} = 0): 1 = sqrt{1 + 2x} implies 1 = 1 + 2x implies 2x = 0 implies x = 0.

Since we want a remainder of 5 when divided by each of these numbers, we add 5 to the LCM. So the number of toys Nicole has is of the form 60k + 5, where k is a non-negative integer. Now, we need to find the smallest k such that 60k + 5 is between 1500 and 2000. Let's solve for k when 60k + 5 = 1500: 60k = 1500 - 5 60k = 1495 k = 1495 / 60 k = 24.9166... Since k must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 25. So the smallest number of toys Nicole could have is 60 * 25 + 5 = 1505. Now, we want to add the minimum number of toys so that when they are grouped into 12 and 18, no toys will remain ungrouped. The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36 (since 12 = 2^2 * 3 and 18 = 2 * 3^2, the LCM is 2^2 * 3^2 = 36). We need to find the smallest number that can be added to 1505 to make it divisible by 36. To do this, we find the remainder when 1505 is divided by 36 and subtract this remainder from 36. 1505 mod 36 = 5 (since 1505 = 41 * 36 + 29) To make 1505 divisible by 36, we need to add 36 - 5 = 31 toys. However, we must check that by adding 31 toys, the total number does not exceed 2100. 1505 + 31 = 1536, which is less than 2100, so it is acceptable. Therefore, the minimum number of toys to be added so that when they are grouped into 12 and 18, no toys will remain ungrouped, while ensuring the total number of toys does not exceed 2100, is boxed{31} ."},{"instruction":"Let b_1, b_2, b_3, dots be a sequence of real numbers satisfying [ b_n = b_{n1}b_{n+1} ] for all n geq 2.

So, the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is: (21.6 liters of alcohol / 40 liters of mixture) * 100% = 54% Therefore, the percentage of alcohol in the new mixture is boxed{54%} ."},{"instruction":"Determine the residue of 811pmod{24}.

This division gives us a quotient of 33 and a remainder, but we are interested in how -811 relates to multiples of 24. 2. Knowing the quotient, we calculate the greatest multiple of 24 that is less than -811. Since the quotient from dividing 811 by 24 is 33, we consider the next multiple for -811, which is -34. Thus, the greatest multiple of 24 less than -811 is 24 cdot -34 = -816. 3. To find how far -811 is from this multiple of 24, we calculate -811 - (-816). This calculation simplifies to -811 + 816 = 5. 4. Since 5 is within the range 0 to 23, it is the residue of -811 pmod{24}.

We aim to express ( x ) as: [ x = sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{a_i} ] 2. **Greedy Algorithm**: - We will use the greedy algorithm to find the integers ( a_i ). - Start with ( a_1 ) as the smallest positive integer such that the sum does not exceed ( x ). Continue this process for subsequent ( a_i ). 3. **Conceptual Steps**: To illustrate how the greedy algorithm works, assume: - ( x = sum_{i=1}^k frac{1}{a_i} ) can be approximated closely, and then the remaining part ( d = x - sum_{i=1}^k frac{1}{a_i} ) is small. 4. **Bounding the Difference ( d_n ) Under 1**: - Choose an integer ( m ) such that: [ 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + cdots + frac{1}{m} leq x < 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + cdots + frac{1}{m+1} ] This is possible because the harmonic series diverges, meaning you can always find such an ( m ). - After this step, if we reach equality, we're done.

Suppose ( d_n = frac{r_n}{s_n} ) where ( r_n ) and ( s_n ) are integers. - Ensure: [ d_n < frac{1}{a_n + 1} ] 6. **Choosing ( a_{n+1} )**: - Select ( a_{n+1} ) such that: [ frac{1}{a_{n+1}} le d_n < frac{1}{a_{n+1} - 1} ] 7. **Updating the Difference**: - Calculate the new difference: [ d_{n+1} = d_n - frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{r_n a_{n+1} - s_n}{s_n a_{n+1}} ] 8. **Ensuring Neccessary Inequalities**: It is imperative to show each boundary condition holds: [ r_n a_{n+1} - s_n < r_n implies d_n (a_{n+1}) - 1 < d_n ] Given ( d_n < frac{1}{a_n+1} ): [ frac{1}{a_{n+1} - 1} - frac{1}{a_{n+1}} < frac{1}{a_{n+1} + 1} ] This follows because ( a_{n+1} > 1 ). 9. **Conclusion**: - Repeat above steps iteratively, ensuring ( d_n ) keeps shrinking. - The process must terminate after a finite number of steps since ( d_n ) gets progressively smaller.

D: The probability that the average extracurricular reading time per week for male students in the school is greater than 8 hours is 0.4.","output":"To analyze the given data and verify the statements, we proceed as follows: 1. **Average Extracurricular Reading Time for Female Students:** To find the average extracurricular reading time per week for female students, we sum up all the weekly reading times and divide by the total number of weeks: [ frac{7.0 + 7.6 + 8.1 + 8.2 + 8.5 + 8.6 + 8.6 + 9.0 + 9.3 + 9.3}{10} = frac{84.2}{10} = 8.42 , text{hours} ] Therefore, the statement A that suggests the average is 8.2 hours is incorrect. 2. **80th Percentile of Average Extracurricular Reading Time for Male Students:** To determine the 80th percentile, we first need to understand that the 80th percentile is the value below which 80% of the observations may be found. For the male students' reading times, we arrange the data in ascending order (which it already is) and find the value that separates the lowest 80% from the top 20%. Since we have 10 data points, the 80th percentile falls between the 8th (8.2 hours) and 9th (8.6 hours) data points. Therefore, we calculate the average of these two values: [ frac{8.2 + 8.6}{2} = frac{16.8}{2} = 8.4 , text{hours} ] Hence, statement B is correct. 3. **Fluctuation in Average Extracurricular Reading Time:** Without performing a detailed statistical variance or standard deviation calculation, we can observe from the table that the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) and the progression of values suggest that female students' reading times start higher and increase more steadily compared to male students. Male students' reading times start lower but increase more significantly towards the end. This qualitative assessment supports statement C, indicating it is correct based on the data provided. 4. **Probability of Male Students' Reading Time Being Greater Than 8 Hours:** Looking at the table, we count the number of weeks where the average extracurricular reading time for male students exceeds 8 hours, which are weeks 7, 8, 9, and 10. Therefore, the probability is calculated as: [ frac{text{Number of weeks with reading time > 8 hours}}{text{Total number of weeks}} = frac{4}{10} = 0.4 ] Thus, statement D is correct.

We note that the diagonals (AD), (CF), and (EB) intersect the vertices of this triangle. 3. In a cyclic hexagon (one inscribed in a circle), the product of the lengths of three non-adjacent sides is equal to the product of the lengths of the other three sides if and only if the specific diagonals intersect at a common point. This is a well-known result in geometry often proved using properties of power of a point, or more directly via Menelaus' Theorem and Ptolemy's Theorem. 4.

That is: [ frac{|AB|}{sin angle ACE} = frac{|BC|}{sin angle EAC} = frac{|CD|}{sin angle AEC} = text{constant} ] 5. Likewise, similar proportions hold for the remaining diagonals and segments, thus: [ frac{|AB| cdot |CD| cdot |EF|}{|BC| cdot |DE| cdot |FA|} = 1 ] This equality holds true due to the cyclic nature of the hexagon and its geometric properties that ensure the diagonals intersect at a single point. 6.

Thus, it is demonstrated that it is indeed possible to equalize all the integer values on the chessboard using the king's movement. Thus, this leads to the following conclusions for the questions: - For part (a): Since we can make all numbers equal, we can choose an even number. ( boxed{(a)} ) - For part (b): Since we can make all numbers equal, we can choose a number divisible by 3.

The critical trick involves using properties of consecutive integers and ensuring none share a common divisor greater than 1 other than what can be controlled. 1. **Initial Setup and Circle Divisions**: - Consider the set ({n, n+1, n+2, ldots, n+32}). - We need to find two subsets from this set that satisfy the given conditions: - Subset one: 14 numbers. - Subset two: 19 numbers. 2. **Case 1: ( n ) not divisible by 13**: - Choose the first subset as ({n, n+1, n+2, ldots, n+13}). - These 14 numbers can be arranged in a circle. Since they are consecutive, any two consecutive numbers are relatively prime because two consecutive integers (a) and (a+1) have no common divisor other than 1. - For the second subset, choose ({n+15, n+14, n+16, n+17, ldots , n+32}). This is a total of 19 numbers arranged in a modified order, ensuring: - Each consecutive pair ((x, y)) where ( x = n+k ) and ( y = n+k+1 ) or vice versa are consecutive in the set. - Note: If ( n equiv 2 pmod{17} ), choose the second subset as ({n+14, n+15, ldots, n+29, n+30, n+32, n+31}). 3. **Case 2: ( n ) divisible by 13**: - In this scenario ({n, n+1, ldots, n+13}) has pairs where ( n ) and ( n+13 ) share common factors. We choose the first subset differently: ({n+19, n+20, ldots, n+32}) (14 numbers).

If ( n equiv 16 pmod{17} ), choose the second subset as ({n, n+1, ldots, n+15, n+16, n+18, n+17}). 4. **Detailed Reasoning on Relative Primality**: - Any common factor of ( n ) and ( n+13 ) is 13, but since ( n ) itself is odd, pairs like ( n ) and ( n+13 ) (if the difference isn’t modified) don't introduce any common factors per listed steps. - For other selections like ({n+19, n+20, ldots, n+32}) when ( n neq kcdot(13)) mod it avoids introducing common factors not equal to 1. - Consecutive structure helps in making sure pair relabeling avoids shared factors not modified by logic above a given. This complete methodology ensures for any odd positive ( n ), that set ( {n, n+1, ldots, n+32}) can be divided, ensuring in one circumferential sequence that each inner number is relatively prime to neighbors without any confusion.

We must ensure that we can rotate or arrange our cubes such that every external face of the larger cube is red. Since every blue face is visible, we leave no blue faces to be hidden internally. 9. Given that all blue faces are accounted externally, we can arrange each smaller cube with its blue faces hidden inside and have only red faces showing outward. This completion works because we have already established the surface requirement. 10. Hence, we can conclude that the outer visible faces of the large cube consist entirely of red faces. Therefore, it is possible to align the combinations to ensure the larger forming cube appears red.

Prove: x_{2}x_{1} > frac{4}{a}2.","output":"# Part (1): Finding the value of a for which f(x) is an increasing function Given the function f(x)=frac{a}{2}x^{2}-(a-2)x-2xln x, we first find its derivative to determine the conditions under which it is increasing. 1. **Derivative of f(x):** [ {f'}(x)=frac{d}{dx}left(frac{a}{2}x^{2}-(a-2)x-2xln xright)=ax-(a-2)-2left(ln x+frac{x}{x}right)=ax-a-2ln x ] 2. **Condition for f(x) to be increasing:** For f(x) to be increasing, {f'}(x) geqslant 0 for all x in its domain (0,+infty). 3. **Analysis of {f'}(x) geqslant 0:** Let g(x)=ax-a-2ln x. We analyze the behavior of g(x) by finding its derivative: [ {g'}(x)=a-frac{2}{x}=frac{ax-2}{x} ] - **Case 1:** When a leqslant 0, {g'}(x) < 0 for all x > 0, making g(x) monotonically decreasing. Since g(1)=0, for x > 1, g(x) < 0, contradicting the requirement that {f'}(x) geqslant 0. - **Case 2:** When a > 0, setting {g'}(x)=0 gives x=frac{2}{a}. This divides the behavior of g(x) into two intervals: - On (0,frac{2}{a}), {g'}(x) < 0, so g(x) is decreasing. - On (frac{2}{a},+infty), {g'}(x) > 0, so g(x) is increasing. The minimum value of g(x) occurs at x=frac{2}{a}, which gives g(frac{2}{a})=2-a-2ln 2+2ln a. 4. **Finding a for which g(x) geqslant 0:** Let h(a)=2-a-2ln 2+2ln a. We find the critical point of h(a) by setting its derivative to zero: [ {h'}(a)=-1+frac{2}{a}=frac{-a+2}{a} ] Setting {h'}(a)=0 gives a=2. Analyzing the behavior of h(a): - On (0,2), {h'}(a) > 0, so h(a) is increasing. - On (2,+infty), {h'}(a) < 0, so h(a) is decreasing. Therefore, the only value of a that satisfies h(a) geqslant 0 is a=2. Thus, for f(x) to be an increasing function, we must have boxed{a=2}. # Part (2): Proving x_{2}-x_{1} > frac{4}{a}-2 Given that {f'}(x) has two zeros x_{1} and x_{2} with x_{1} < x_{2}, and 0 < a < 2, we proceed as follows: 1. **Analysis of {f'}(x):** We have {f'}(x)=ax-a-2ln x, which has two roots x_{1} and x_{2}. 2. **Behavior of {f'}(x):** Let u(x)=ax-a-2ln x and find its derivative: [ {u'}(x)=a-frac{2}{x}=frac{ax-2}{x} ] Setting {u'}(x)=0 gives x=frac{2}{a}. This divides the behavior of u(x) into two intervals: - On (0,frac{2}{a}), {u'}(x) > 0, so u(x) is increasing. - On (frac{2}{a},+infty), {u'}(x) < 0, so u(x) is decreasing. 3. **Given 0 < a < 2, we have frac{2}{a} > 1 and u(1)=0.** 4. **To prove x_{2}-x_{1} > frac{4}{a}-2:** We start with the expression a=frac{2ln{x}_{2}}{{x}_{2}-1} and aim to show x_{2}-1 > frac{4}{frac{2ln{x}_{2}}{{x}_{2}-1}}-2. This simplifies to proving x_{2}ln x_{2}+ln x_{2}-4(x_{2}-1) > 0. 5. **Analysis of the inequality:** Let t(x)=xln x+ln x-4(x-1) and find its derivative: [ {t'}(x)=ln x-1+frac{1}{x} ] Further analyzing {t'}(x): [ {p'}(x)=frac{1}{x}-frac{1}{{x}^{2}}=frac{x-1}{{x}^{2}} > 0 text{ for } x > 1 ] Therefore, {t'}(x) > 0 for x > 1, implying t(x) is monotonically increasing on (1,+infty). Since t(x) > t(1)=0, the inequality x_{2}-x_{1} > frac{4}{a}-2 is proven, completing the proof. Thus, we have boxed{x_{2}-x_{1} > frac{4}{a}-2}."},{"instruction":"he average weight of 8 person ' s increases by 3.5 kg when a new person comes in place of one of them weighing 65 kg . what is the weight of the new person ?","output":"Let's denote the weight of the new person as W_new.

Similarly, the sequence (b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, ldots) is an arithmetic sequence with (b_{1} = 2) and a common difference of 10. Therefore, the general term (b_m) is: [ b_m = 2 + 10(m-1) ] Simplifying this, we get: [ b_m = 10m - 8 ] 3. To find the smallest integer larger than 2023 that appears in both sequences, we need to find a common term between (a_n) and (b_m). Thus, we set: [ 3n - 2 = 10m - 8 ] 4. Solving for (n) in terms of (m): [ 3n - 2 = 10m - 8 implies 3n = 10m - 6 implies n = frac{10m - 6}{3} ] 5. For (n) to be an integer, the expression (frac{10m - 6}{3}) must be an integer. This implies that: [ 10m - 6 text{ must be divisible by 3} ] 6. Checking divisibility conditions, since (10m - 6) should be divisible by 3, we note that (10m equiv 6 pmod{3}). Given that (10 equiv 1 pmod{3}), we have: [ 10m equiv 6 pmod{3} implies m equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Thus, (m) must be a multiple of 3. 7. Let (m = 3k) for some integer (k). Therefore, (b_m = 10(3k) - 8 = 30k - 8). 8. We need the smallest (m) (or (k)) such that (30k - 8 > 2023): [ 30k - 8 > 2023 implies 30k > 2031 implies k > frac{2031}{30} approx 67.7 ] The smallest integer (k) satisfying this is (k = 68). 9. Plugging in (k = 68): [ b_{3 times 68} = b_{204} = 10 times 204 - 8 = 2032 ] 10.

Therefore, the product of these numbers would be expressed in terms of powers of 2 (since 1 is (2^0), 2 is (2^1), and 4 is (2^2)). 2. **Analyzing possible products**: Let’s consider different compositions of five numbers and their corresponding products: - If all five numbers are 1: [ 1 times 1 times 1 times 1 times 1 = 1 ] This product isn’t listed among the options. - If at least one number is 4: The product must include (2^2), contributing more power of 2 to the product. 3. **Eliminating options**: - **Option (a) 100**: [ 100 = 2^2 times 5^2 ] This number is not a pure power of 2, so it’s not valid.

Additionally, since (E) is the midpoint of (AB) and considering triangles (BKE) and (ADE), we have the following angle equality due to the properties of alternate interior angles: [ angle KEB = angle DEA ] 5. Consequently, triangles (BKE) and (ADE) are congruent by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) criterion, since (AE = BE) which is given, and (BK parallel AD) ensures the aforementioned angle equalities.

We want to find the radius R of the ball. 1. **Define Variables and Understand the Geometry**: - Let R be the radius of the sphere (the ball). - The depression in the ice has a shape of a circular segment (a part of sphere). - The chord of the circle formed by the intersection of the sphere and the ice has a diameter of 24 , text{cm}, hence a radius of 12 , text{cm}. - The depth of the segment (distance from the chord to the top of the sphere) is 8 , text{cm}. 2. **Use the Intersecting Chords Theorem**: - The theorem states that for any two intersecting chords of a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. - Let's consider the cross-section of the sphere and the ice. In the cross-section, the sphere will appear as a circle. - Draw a vertical line from the top of the spherical segment (through the center of the circle formed by the depression) to the chord; let’s denote the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the chord as R - 8 , text{cm}. 3. **Calculate Using Variables and Equations**: [ (2R - 8) cdot 8 = 12 cdot 12 ] - Here, 2R - 8 is the combined depth from the center of the sphere to the point where the chord intersects, plus the height of the depression. 4. **Solve the Equation**: begin{align*} (2R - 8) cdot 8 &= 12^2 8(2R - 8) &= 144 16R - 64 &= 144 16R &= 144 + 64 16R &= 208 R &= frac{208}{16} R &= 13 end{align*} 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the radius of the ball is (boxed{13}, text{cm})."},{"instruction":"Given that the line l passing through point A(3,1) is tangent to circle C: x^{2}+y^{2}4y1=0 at point B, find the value of overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB}.","output":"First, we identify that the equation of circle C can be rewritten as x^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=5.

Squaring ①, we obtain (log a)^2 + (log b)^2 + (log c)^2 + 2log a log b + 2log a log c + 2log b log c = 1, which simplifies to (log a)^2 + (log b)^2 + (log c)^2 = 1 - (2log a log b + 2log a log c + 2log b log c).

The digits follow a specific pattern whereby it must contain 2 sets of 3 repeated digits and the remaining digits must be different from the repeated digits and from each other.

Choose the positions for the first set of repeated digits. 3. Choose the positions for the second set of repeated digits. 4. Choose the two remaining digits. Step 1: Choose the two digits that will be repeated three times each. There are 10 possible digits (0-9) for each of the two sets of repeated digits. Since the order in which we choose the two digits doesn't matter (choosing 1 and 2 is the same as choosing 2 and 1), we have a combination of 10 digits taken 2 at a time. This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial. C(10, 2) = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 10! / (2!8!) = (10 × 9) / (2 × 1) = 45 ways. Step 2: Choose the positions for the first set of repeated digits. We have 8 positions to fill, and we need to choose 3 positions for the first set of repeated digits. This is a combination problem since the order of the positions doesn't matter. C(8, 3) = 8! / (3!(8-3)!) = 8! / (3!5!) = (8 × 7 × 6) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 56 ways. Step 3: Choose the positions for the second set of repeated digits. After placing the first set of repeated digits, we have 5 positions left. We need to choose 3 positions for the second set of repeated digits. C(5, 3) = 5! / (3!(5-3)!) = 5! / (3!2!) = (5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 10 ways. Step 4: Choose the two remaining digits. For the two remaining positions, we need to choose two different digits from the 8 remaining digits (since we've already used 2 digits for the repeated sets). C(8, 2) = 8! / (2!(8-2)!) = 8! / (2!6!) = (8 × 7) / (2 × 1) = 28 ways. Now, we multiply the results of each step to find the total number of codes: 45 (Step 1) × 56 (Step 2) × 10 (Step 3) × 28 (Step 4) = 45 × 56 × 10 × 28 = 705600 ways.

Given f(x) geqslant 6, we solve the inequality in each case: - For x leq -3, solving -2x - 2 geqslant 6 gives -2x geqslant 8 Rightarrow x leq -4. - For -3 < x < 1, the condition 4 geqslant 6 is never true, so there are no solutions in this interval. - For x geq 1, solving 2x + 2 geqslant 6 gives 2x geqslant 4 Rightarrow x geq 2. Therefore, the solution set for the inequality f(x) geqslant 6 is x leq -4 or x geq 2, which can be represented as (-infty, -4] cup [2, +infty). Thus, the solution set is boxed{(-infty, -4] cup [2, +infty)}. Part (2): For f(x) = |x-a| + |x+3|, we know that f(x) geqslant |x-a-x-3| = |a+3| by the triangle inequality. Given f(x) > -a, we must have |a+3| > -a. We consider two cases based on the value of a: 1.

This can be achieved by touching each of the buttons along the side containing the ( min(m, n) ) buttons. - If only one of the sides is odd, say ( m ), then the minimum number of steps is ( m ), obtained by touching each of the buttons along the side containing ( m ) buttons. - If both ( m ) and ( n ) are even, then one way to alter all lights to the all-on state is to touch each of the ( m times n ) buttons exactly once sequentially, going from one row/column to the next or in any other order. 2. **Proof for the case when both ( m ) and ( n ) are even:** - We need to prove that the minimum number of steps is ( m times n ) when both ( m ) and ( n ) are even. - To prove this, it suffices to show that no button can be left untouched. 3. **Assume a button is left untouched:** - If a button is left untouched, it will be turned to the ON state only if there are an odd number of touches along the row and column containing this button. - Therefore, either the row or column (say row) containing this button must have an odd number of touches, and the other (say column) must have an even number of touches. Let us label this row as ( R ) and column as ( C ). 4. **Analyzing the matrix excluding ( R ) and ( C ):** - Each button in ( C ) needs to have an odd number of touches in total, so each row of the matrix obtained after excluding ( C ) and ( R ) must have an odd number of touches. - This matrix has dimensions ( (m-1) times (n-1) ), so the total number of touches in this matrix must be odd. (Equation 1) - Each button in ( R ) needs to have an odd number of touches in total, so each column of the matrix obtained after excluding ( C ) and ( R ) must have an even number of touches, so the total number of touches in this matrix must be even.

The amount of pure alcohol in the 20% solution is 0.20 * (V + 40) liters, and the amount of pure alcohol in the 70% solution is 0.70 * 60 liters. When these two solutions are mixed, the total volume of the mixture will be (V + 40) + 60 liters, and the total amount of pure alcohol in the mixture will be the sum of the alcohol from both solutions. The equation for the amount of pure alcohol in the final mixture is: 0.20 * (V + 40) + 0.70 * 60 = P * ((V + 40) + 60) where P is the percentage of alcohol in the final solution (in decimal form). We can simplify the equation: 0.20V + 8 + 42 = P * (V + 100) Now, we can solve for P: 0.20V + 50 = P * (V + 100) Since we don't have a specific target percentage for the final solution, we cannot solve for a unique value of P without additional information.

The line l: x=1 intersects C, implying y^2 = 2p cdot 1 = 2p. Thus, the intersection points are P(1, sqrt{2p}) and Q(1, -sqrt{2p}). Given OP perp OQ, we have: 1 cdot 1 + sqrt{2p} cdot (-sqrt{2p}) = 0 Rightarrow 1 - 2p = 0 Rightarrow p = frac{1}{2} Therefore, the equation of C is y^2 = x. - **Circle M Equation:** Since circle M is tangent to line l at x=1 and the center of M is at (2,0), the radius of M is the distance from the center to the tangent line, which is 1.

Let's denote the cities with at least 70 outgoing air routes as \\"millionaire cities\\". 2. **Define the quantity of millionaire cities**: According to the problem, there are at least 70 millionaire cities, each connected to at least 70 other cities by air routes. 3. **Analyzing a single republic**: If a republic contains a millionaire city, then it connects to at least 70 cities. Since all air routes connect cities of different republics, and the republic contains at most 30 cities (100 total cities minus the 70 cities being connected to), the other connections must reach into the other republics. 4. **Distribution in three republics**: There are three republics, and the total possible number of cities (30 per republic) solely based on connections outside the republics is constrained to these numbers as: - Republic 1: 30 cities maximum - Republic 2: 30 cities maximum - Republic 3: 30 cities maximum 5. **Full city count including millionaire cities**: If millionaire cities need to fulfill the connection requirements, each additional republic should also not exceed 30 cities. 6. **Total city inconsistency**: Summing up the maximum possible number of cities in each republic: [ 30 + 30 + 30 = 90 , text{cities total in the three republics} ] But we know that the total number of cities in the country is 100. Thus, the assumption runs into an inconsistency.

The key properties are: - Perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle meet at the circumcenter. - The line joining the incenter and circumcenter of a triangle (i.e., ( IO )) has special geometric properties related to the radii and distances in the triangle. 4. Establishing Perpendicularity: Since ( AD ) is perpendicular to ( IO ), the projection properties and symmetry relative to circumcenters play a critical role in triangles ( ABD ) and ( ACD ). 5.

If it is sold at the marked price of 1260 yuan, the profit made (relative to the cost price) is ______ yuan.","output":"Solution: (1260 times 90%) div (1 + 8%), = 1134 div 108%, = 1050 (yuan); 1260 - 1050 = 210 (yuan); Answer: The profit is 210 yuan. Therefore, the answer is boxed{210}. First, consider the marked price as the unit \\"1\\", and use multiplication to find its 90%, which is the selling price after the discount; then, consider the cost price as the unit \\"1\\", its (1 + 8%) corresponds to the quantity of the selling price after the discount, use division to find the cost price; finally, subtract the cost price from the marked price to find the profit.

We will prove the inequality through mathematical induction. Base Case: For (n < 4), the inequality obviously holds due to the small number involved, making the inequality more likely to be true. For example, you can manually check it for (n=2) and (n=3). Inductive Step: Assume the inequality holds for some (n = k (k geq 4)): [ frac{1}{a_{1}} + frac{2}{a_{1}+a_{2}} + cdots + frac{k}{a_{1}+a_{2}+cdots+a_{k}} < 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k}} right) ] We now want to prove it for (n = k + 1). 1. We express the sum ( S_{k+1} ): [ S_{k+1} = S_k + frac{k+1}{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k} + a_{k+1}} ] 2. We then need to show: [ S_{k} + frac{k+1}{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k} + a_{k+1}} < 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k+1}} right) ] 3. Using the assumption for ( S_k ): [ S_k < 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k}} right) ] 4. We want: [ 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k}} right) + frac{k+1}{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k} + a_{k+1}} < 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k}} + frac{1}{a_{k+1}} right) ] 5. Focus on the additional term: [ frac{k+1}{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k} + a_{k+1}} ] This term is smaller compared to ( 4 left( frac{1}{a_{k+1}} right) ) assuming ( a_{i} ) are positive and ordered such that ( a_{1} leq a_{2} leq cdots leq a_{k+1} ). Therefore, [ frac{k+1}{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k} + a_{k+1}} < 4 frac{1}{a_{k+1}} ] Since the sum of the first (k) terms still holds the condition by induction, we get: [ 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k}} right) < 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k}} right) + 4 frac{1}{a_{k+1}} ] Combining these we obtain: [ S_{k+1} < 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{k}} + frac{1}{a_{k+1}} right) ] Hence the inequality: [ frac{1}{a_{1}} + frac{2}{a_{1}+a_{2}} + cdots + frac{n}{a_{1}+a_{2}+cdots+a_{n}} < 4 left( frac{1}{a_{1}} + cdots + frac{1}{a_{n}} right) ] holds for ( n = k+1 ). # Conclusion: By induction, the inequality holds for all positive integers ( n ). boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given the sets A={x ,|, |x|<1} and B={x ,|, 2<x<0}, then A cap B= ?","output":"Since set A={x ,|, |x|<1} = (-1, 1), and set B={x ,|, -2<x<0} = (-2, 0), therefore, A cap B = (-1, 0).

Prove that the circles Gamma and omega are tangent. Malik Talb","output":"1. **Define the elements and setup the problem:** - Let omega be tangent to the side BC at point E. - Denote D as the center of the arc BC that does not contain A on the circumcircle Gamma. - By the properties of the circumcircle, BD = CD = ID (since D is the midpoint of the arc BC not containing A). 2. **Apply the Inversion Theorem:** - Consider an inversion centered at D with radius ID. Under this inversion: - Points B, C, and I are fixed because they lie on the circle centered at D with radius ID. - The line BC is mapped to the circumcircle Gamma of triangle ABC because inversion swaps lines passing through the center with circles passing through the center. 3. **Analyze the properties of omega:** - The circle omega is tangent to the line AI at I and to the side BC at E. - Under the inversion centered at D, the line AI (which passes through D) remains invariant. - The circle omega, being tangent to AI at I, is also invariant under this inversion. 4. **Prove tangency:** - Since omega is tangent to BC at E, and BC is mapped to Gamma under the inversion, omega must be tangent to Gamma at the image of E under the inversion. - However, since E lies on BC and BC is mapped to Gamma, the image of E under the inversion is still E. - Therefore, omega is tangent to Gamma at E. Thus, the circles Gamma and omega are tangent at point E. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The vertices of triangle ( triangle ABC ) are ( A(0,0), B(0,420), C(560,0) ).

Given the coordinates of the vertices of triangle triangle ABC: A(0,0), B(0,420), C(560,0). 2. We need to determine the starting point P_1 = (k, m) and follow the described rule to determine the coordinates up to P_7 = (14, 92). 3. Let's backtrace from P_7 to P_1 step by step by understanding that P_{n+1} is always the midpoint of P_n and some vertex L. 4. From the problem, we know: - P_7(14,92) is the midpoint of P_6 and vertex A(0,0). Therefore: left( frac{x_6 + 0}{2}, frac{y_6 + 0}{2} right) = (14, 92). Solving for (x_6, y_6), we get: [ x_6 + 0 = 2 times 14 = 28, ] [ y_6 + 0 = 2 times 92 = 184. ] Hence, P_6 = (28, 184). 5. Likewise, P_6(28,184) is the midpoint of P_5 and A(0,0). Therefore: left( frac{x_5 + 0}{2}, frac{y_5 + 0}{2} right) = (28, 184). Solving for (x_5, y_5), we get: [ x_5 + 0 = 2 times 28 = 56, ] [ y_5 + 0 = 2 times 184 = 368. ] Hence, P_5 = (56, 368). 6.

Solving for (x_4, y_4), we get: [ x_4 + 0 = 2 times 56 = 112, ] [ y_4 + 420 = 2 times 368 = 736, ] [ y_4 = 736 - 420 = 316. ] Hence, P_4 = (112, 316). 7. Now, P_4(112,316) is the midpoint of P_3 and B(0,420). Therefore: left( frac{x_3 + 0}{2}, frac{y_3 + 420}{2} right) = (112, 316). Solving for (x_3, y_3), we get: [ x_3 + 0 = 2 times 112 = 224, ] [ y_3 + 420 = 2 times 316 = 632, ] [ y_3 = 632 - 420 = 212. ] Hence, P_3 = (224, 212). 8.
