The given problem states:         sum_{i=1}^{8} (2y_i + 1) = 20         2. **Simplify the equation:**        We break it down as follows:        2sum_{i=1}^{8} y_i + 8 = 20            Subtract 8 on both sides:        2sum_{i=1}^{8} y_i = 12            Divide both sides by 2:        sum_{i=1}^{8} y_i = 6     3. **Determine the number of non-negative integer solutions:**    Now, we need to find the number of solutions to the equation y_1 + y_2 + cdots + y_8 = 6 where each y_i is a non-negative integer. 4. **Use the stars and bars theorem:**        This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved by the \\"stars and bars\\" method.

An 80% discount on a 50 item means the item is sold for 20% of its original price. 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 Next, let's calculate how many items were sold. They sold 90% of their 2000 items. 90% of 2000 = 0.90 * 2000 = 1800 items Now, let's calculate the total revenue from the sale of these items. Total revenue = Number of items sold * Discounted price per item Total revenue = 1800 * 10 = 18,000 The store has 3000 left after paying their creditors, which means the amount paid to the creditors is the total revenue minus the remaining 3000.

Can Kolya definitely guess all the selected points in fewer than ((n+1)^{2}) attempts?","output":"1. Let ( k geq 1 ) be the number of undetermined points ( c_{k,1}, c_{k,2}, ldots, c_{k,k} ) on the paper. 2. We construct a straight line segment ( l ) on the paper, external to the marked circle. 3. Choose ( k+1 ) points ( a_{k,1}, a_{k,2}, ldots, a_{k,k+1} ) on segment ( l ) such that ( a_{k,j} ) lies strictly between ( a_{k,j-1} ) and ( a_{k,j+1} ) for all ( j = 2,3, ldots, k ). 4. Measure the distances ( d_{k,1}, d_{k,2}, ldots, d_{k,k+1} ) from these points to the nearest undetermined point as reported by Misha. 5. Using a compass and straightedge, determine points ( b_{k,j} (j = 1,2, ldots, k) ) that lie on the same side of line ( l ) as the marked circle, such that each ( b_{k,j} ) is at distances ( d_{k,j} ) and ( d_{k,j+1} ) respectively from points ( a_{k,j} ) and ( a_{k,j+1} ). Skip those ( j ) for which such points ( b_{k,j} ) cannot be determined. 6. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one pair of points ( a_{k,j} ) and ( a_{k,m} ) (where ( 1 leq j < m leq k+1 )) must have the same closest undetermined point ( c_{k,i} ). So, for any point on segment ( [a_{k,j}, a_{k,m}] ), particularly for ( a_{k,j+1} ), the closest point ( c_{k,i} ) holds for ( i in {1, 2, dots, k} ). 7. Thus, ( c_{k,i} ) must align with one of the points ( b_{k,j} (j = 1,2, ldots, k) ). 8. Therefore, it is possible to determine one undetermined point using at most ( 2k+1 ) attempts for any given ( k ), which reduces the problem size. 9. By induction:    - Base Case (( n=1 )): It takes ( 2k+1 = 3 leq (n+1)^2 ) attempts.    - Inductive Step: Assume ( N ) undetermined points take less than ( (N+1)^2 ) attempts to determine. For ( n=N+1 ), finding one point takes ( 2N+3 ) attempts. By induction, in ( (N+1)^2+2N+3 = (N+2)^2 ) attempts maximum, all points can be resolved. Conclusion: Since we have shown that in fewer than ( (n+1)^2 ) attempts, Kolya can always determine all the points selected by Misha, the statement is proved.

Next, divide each term by 3 to simplify further:  frac{3}{3}, frac{6}{3}, frac{9}{3}, ldots, frac{2012}{3}, frac{2015}{3}  resulting in:  1, 2, 3, ldots, 670, 671.  This is a simple sequence starting from 1 and increasing by 1 at each step up to 671. The total count of numbers is straightforward as it ends at 671, starting from 1.

A number ( k ) in the range from 1 to 50 is provided. In one move, it is allowed to select any ( k ) consecutive stones where the first and last stones are white and paint them black. Determine for which values of ( k ) it is possible, in several such moves, to paint all 100 stones black. 1. **For ( k = 1 )**:     - Selecting ( k=1 ) means we can choose each individual stone (since selecting ( k=1 ) means each choice is guaranteed to start and end with the same white stone).     - Hence, we can paint each of the 100 stones black in 100 moves.     - Therefore, it is possible to paint all stones black when ( k=1 ). 2. **For ( k > 1 )**:     - Let's mark an arbitrary white stone as the starting point. Then, mark the stone that is ( k-1 ) positions clockwise from the current marked stone. Repeat this marking process until the marking returns to the starting stone.     - Each set of ( k ) consecutive stones chosen will have the first and last stones marked.     - Thus, every ( k-1 ) stones, another stone is marked, forming a sequence in the circle. Let’s identify under what conditions all stones can be effectively turned black.    3. **Analysis**:     - To ensure all stones can be turned black, every stone must be part of at least one marked segment. This condition holds if the total number of marked segments, given as ( text{GCD}(N, k-1) ), divides N (where ( N ) is 100 here).     - Hence, we need ( text{GCD}(100, k-1) ) to be 1. The problem reduces to identifying valid ( k ) by satisfying ( text{GCD}(100, k-1) = 1 ). 4. **Identifying invalid ( k )**:     - If ( k ) leads to ( k-1 ) being a multiple of 4, ( text{GCD}(100, k-1) neq 1 ).

The existence of such primes is guaranteed by Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, which states that there are infinitely many primes in any arithmetic progression (a + kn) where (a) and (n) are coprime. 3. **Analyze the gcd condition.** For (i > j), if (q^m mid gcd(a^{p_i} - b, a^{p_j} - b)), then:    [    q^m mid a^{p_j} - b implies p_i equiv 1 pmod{phi(q^m)}    ]    This implies:    [    0 equiv a^{p_i} - b equiv a - b pmod{q^m} implies q^m mid a - b    ]    Therefore, the exponent (m) of a prime (q) dividing (a - b) in the factorization of (a^{p_i} - b) is not more than the exponent in (a - b). 4. **Choose a prime (q) dividing (a^{p_i} - b) with (gcd(q, b - a) = 1).** For such a prime (q), we have:    [    text{Ord}_q(b) mid p_i text{Ord}_q(a) quad text{and} quad text{Ord}_q(a) mid text{Ord}_q(b)    ]    If (text{Ord}_q(b) neq text{Ord}_q(a)), then (text{Ord}_q(b) = p_i text{Ord}_q(a)). This implies (p_i mid q - 1). 5. **Factorization of (a^{p_i} - b).** The factorization is:    [    a^{p_i} - b = D_i prod (p_i k_i + 1)^{alpha_i}    ]    where (D_i mid (a - b)).

We need to find the smallest number of prime factors of the product of all ( N ) numbers. 2. **Case Analysis for ( N = 1 ):**    - If ( N = 1 ), we have only one number. The GCD of the single number with itself is the number itself. To satisfy the condition of distinct GCDs, the number must be 1 (since 1 has no prime factors).    - Therefore, for ( N = 1 ), the smallest number of prime factors is ( 0 ). 3. **Case Analysis for ( N geq 2 ):**    - Assume there is a solution with ( N - 1 ) prime factors. Let these primes be ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{N-1} ).    - Let our numbers be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_N ).    - We will build a set ( S ) as follows:      - For each ( i = 1, 2, ldots, N-1 ), pick an integer ( a_j ) such that ( a_j ) does not belong to ( S ) and ( v_{p_i}(a_j) ) is minimal among those ( a_k ) not in ( S ).      - Add this ( a_j ) to ( S ).    - By the end of this algorithm, we have ( |S| = N-1 ). Let the elements of ( S ) be ( s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{N-1} ), and let ( s ) be the number not in ( S ).    - Now, consider ( gcd(s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{N-1}) ) and ( gcd(s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{N-1}, s) ).

Therefore, the expected number of indices (i) for which (xa_i + yb_i + zc_i) is odd is:    [    mathbb{E}[text{number of odd expressions}] = N cdot frac{4}{7}    ] 6. **Conclusion Using the Probabilistic Method:**    Since the expected number of odd expressions is (frac{4N}{7}), there must exist at least one specific choice of ((x, y, z)) such that the number of indices (i) for which (xa_i + yb_i + zc_i) is odd is at least (frac{4N}{7}).

These segments do not intersect any of the five planes as ( O ) lies on all intersecting planes.     - Consequently, each of these segments lies either in the interior or on the boundary of one of the resulting solids. Thus, ( O ) will be a vertex for all resulting solids. No other internal points can become vertices. 4. **Analysis of Prism Faces:**     - The bases of the prism (top and bottom) are not intersected inside by the cutting planes.     - Focus on a singular side, for example, the rectangle ( ABB_1A_1 ), since the ( 72^circ ) symmetry ensures similar behavior for other sides. 5. **Cutting Planes through Side ( ABB_1A_1 ):**     - The plane ( ABD_1 ) intersects the plane of ( ABB_1A_1 ) along ( AB ).     - The plane ( BCE_1 ) intersects along a line segment from ( B ) to a new point ( A_2 ) on ( AA_1 ).     - The plane ( EAC_1 ) intersects symmetrically along ( AB_2 ), where ( B_2 ) is the mirror image of ( A_2 ) across the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ).     - The plane ( CDA_1 ) intersects along ( B_2A_1 ) due to rotational symmetry.     - The plane ( DEB_1 ) intersects along ( A_2B_1 ). 6. **New Generated Points:**     - Intersection of segments creates new points ( M_{AB} ) (intersection of ( AB_2 ) and ( BA_2 )) and ( N_{AB} ) (intersection of ( A_1B_2 ) and ( B_1A_2 )).     - Similar points ( C_2, D_2, E_2, M_{BC}, M_{CD}, ) and ( N_{BC}, N_{CD}, dots ) are formed symmetrically on other sides. 7. **Description of the Generated Solids:**     - A regular pentagonal pyramid with vertex ( O ) and base ( ABCDE ) appears (Figure 4).       - This pyramid has 6 vertices, 10 edges, and 6 faces.     - A truncated pentagonal pyramid with an additional ( O ) vertex and cut off differently from the top face.       - This solid has 11 vertices (including ( O, A_1, ldots, E_1, N_{AB}, ldots, N_{EA} )), 20 edges, and 11 faces. 8. **Types and Numbers of Remaining Solids:**     - **Five** tetrahedrons adjacent to sides of the base pentagonal pyramid (Figure 6).       - Each with 5 vertices including ( O ) and 6 faces.     - **Five** solids formed by joining two tetrahedrons (Figure 7).       - Each with 5 vertices including ( O ) and 6 faces.     - **Five** pyramidal solids with deltoid bases (Figure 8 and Figure 9).       - For these, each has 5 vertices including ( O ), 8 edges, and 5 faces. 9. **Distinct Pyramid Volumes:**     - The pyramids in Figures 8 and 9 are not congruent due to different base triangle areas despite the same vertex combinations. # Conclusion: - There are a total of 6 distinct types of bodies formed, and the total count of pieces formed is 22. - The problem is thus fully solved.

By isolating ( m ) from the relationship, we obtain: [ m = frac{kr}{a} ] This gives us a ratio of ( m ) to ( k ) and ( r ) to ( a ): [ frac{m}{k} = frac{r}{a} ]  Step 2: Construct Key Segments To proceed with the construction: 1. Draw a circle with radius ( r ) which will be the inscribed circle of the triangle. 2. From a point outside the circle, draw two tangents to the circle. These tangents will represent parts of the sides of the triangle.  Step 3: Determine the Tangent Lengths The lengths of the tangents are derived as follows: [ text{Length of each tangent} = frac{k}{2} - a ] These tangents are crucial because: - They will determine the directions of two sides of the triangle. - The distance from the point of tangency to the vertex where the tangents intersect will equal ( frac{k}{2} - a ).  Step 4: Construct the Third Side To determine the third side's length: 1. Recognize that the third side will be a segment joining the points where the tangents intersect the circle. 2.

Conclusion Finally, the problem may not be solvable if a common tangent cannot be drawn. This is the case where the given circle of radius ( r ) is entirely within the new circle of radius ( m ) without touching it.

(B) This test would have one logically possible set of answers.  (C) This test would have more than one logically possible set of answers.  (D) This test would have more than one logically possible set of answers. **Question 2.** If the answer to Question 2 were Letter (D) and Question 1 were not on this multiplechoice test, the letter of the answer to Question 3 would be:  (A) Letter (B)  (B) Letter (C)  (C) Letter (D)  (D) Letter (A) **Question 3.** Given the sequence ( P ) where:  ( P_1 = 1 )  ( P_2 = 3 )  For all ( i > 2 ), ( P_i = P_{i1}P_{i2}  P_{i2} ) which of the following is a factor of ( P_{2002} )?

Let's analyze each question step by step.   Step 1: Analyze Question 2 **Question 2:** If the answer to Question 2 were \\"Letter (D)\\" and if Question 1 were not on this multiple-choice test (still keeping Questions 2 and 3 on the test), then the letter of the answer to Question 3 would be: - (A) Letter (B) - (B) Letter (C) - (C) Letter (D) - (D) Letter (A) Given: - The answer to Question 2 is \\"Letter (D)\\". If the question asks which letter question 3's answer would have, we notice that \\"the answer to Question 2 is Letter (D).\\" Thus logically, the answer must be \\"Letter (C)\\" because it is self-referential.

Given: - Adding a fourth question with letter (C) causes \\"at least two answers would have letter (C)\\" – which violates the condition. Therefore, the test would have no logically possible set of answers. So: [ text{Correct answer to Question 1 :=} text{(A)}. ]  Step 3: Analyze Question 3 **Question 3:** Let (P_{1}=1). Let (P_{2}=3). For all (i>2), define (P_{i}=P_{i-1} P_{i-2}-P_{i-2}). Which is a factor of (P_{2002})? - (A) 3 - (B) 4 - (C) 7 - (D) 9 To find the answer, we inspect the sequence (P_{i}) modulo 3, 4, 7, and 9. The sequences quickly become periodic. We find: - **Modulo 3**: The sequence becomes periodic, and 3 is a factor of (P_{2002}). - **Modulo 4**: The sequence does not show 4 as a factor. - **Modulo 7**: The sequence shows 7 as a factor of (P_{2002}). - **Modulo 9**: The sequence shows 9 as a factor of (P_{2002}). Thus, the factors of (P_{2002}) are 3, 7, and 9. Given that letters (A) and (B) cannot be repeated (based on the unique letter condition), the letter of this answer must be (D): So: [ text{Correct answer to Question 3 :=} text{(D)}. ] # Conclusion: The ordered triple (letters of the answers) comes out to be: [ boxed{(A, B, D)} ] All logical conditions are satisfied with this ordered triple."},{"instruction":"At the fair, Amy started with thirtythree tickets, which cost 1.50 each.

Cost of initial tickets = Number of initial tickets × Price per ticket Cost of initial tickets = 33 × 1.50 Cost of initial tickets = 49.50 Next, let's calculate the discounted price for the additional twenty-one tickets. Since there is a 25% discount, we need to find 25% of the regular price and then subtract that from the regular price to get the discounted price per ticket. Discount per ticket = Regular price per ticket × Discount rate Discount per ticket = 1.50 × 0.25 Discount per ticket = 0.375 Discounted price per ticket = Regular price per ticket - Discount per ticket Discounted price per ticket = 1.50 - 0.375 Discounted price per ticket = 1.125 Now, let's calculate the cost of the additional twenty-one tickets at the discounted price.

Since ( f ) is continuous, ( M ) is finite.    - Because ( f ) takes every real value exactly ( n ) times, upon considering ( M + 1 ):      - ( f ) cannot take the value ( M + 1 ) before ( x_1 ) or after ( x_n ) because this would force ( f ) to repeat some value (breaking the constraint).      - Given the nature of ( M ), ( f ) cannot take the value ( M + 1 ) within ((x_1, x_n)) either.    - This leads us to a contradiction since we assumed ( f ) takes each real value exactly ( n ) times. # Conclusion: - Thus, the function ( f ) cannot exist for even values of ( n ), and consequently:     [     boxed{text{odd } n}     ]"},{"instruction":"Determine the number of polynomials of the form a_0x^n + a_1x^{n1} + cdots + a_{n1}x + a_n where the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients plus the degree of the polynomial equals 5.

This means that the faces are congruent triangles. 8. **Step 6**: Since the faces are congruent triangles, the distances from any point ( M ) inside the tetrahedron to the four planes are proportional to the areas of the faces. Since the areas are equal, the sum of the distances from ( M ) to the four planes is constant.

Simplifying, we get (A - C)x^2 = D - B. For this equation to have a solution for x, we need A neq C (to avoid the trivial case of 0x^2 = 0 which does not depend on x) and frac{D - B}{A - C} geq 0. 3. **Analysis of frac{D - B}{A - C}**:    - Since A neq C and B neq D (values are chosen without replacement), the fraction frac{D - B}{A - C} is well-defined and non-zero.    - The fraction is positive if D > B and A > C, or D < B and A < C. It is negative otherwise. 4. **Counting the Total Choices**:    - There are 6 choices for A, 5 remaining choices for C (since C neq A), 4 choices for B (since B neq A, C), and 3 choices for D (since D neq A, B, C). This gives a total of 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 = 360 ways to assign values to A, B, C, D. 5. **Considering the Order of Curves**:    - Since the order of curves does not matter, each set of values (A, B, C, D) is equivalent to (C, D, A, B). Thus, each configuration is counted twice in the 360 total choices. Therefore, we need to divide by 2, giving frac{360}{2} = 180 distinct configurations. 6. **Bijection Between Positive and Negative Cases**:    - For every configuration where frac{D - B}{A - C} > 0, there is a corresponding configuration where frac{D - B}{A - C} < 0 by swapping B and D. This bijection ensures that exactly half of the configurations result in intersecting curves (positive case).    - Therefore, the number of configurations that lead to intersecting curves is frac{180}{2} = 90. 7. **Conclusion**:    - The number of ways to choose A, B, C, D such that the curves intersect is boxed{textbf{(C) }90}."},{"instruction":"Tetrahedron PQRS has PQ=6, PR=5, PS=5, QR=5, QS=4, and RS=tfrac{10}3sqrt3.

Check if (A_k) beats someone from (V). If not, move to (A_{k-1}) and so on. If (A_i) beats someone from (V), say (X), then (X) cannot have drawn with (A_{i+1}) (since (i < k)) for obvious reasons. Therefore, (X) must have won against (A_{i+1}), allowing us to extend our path, which is impossible. 6. **Reaching (A_1)**: If we never stop, we reach (A_1) and find that nobody from (U) won over someone from (V). Since (A_1) cannot lose to someone from (V), (A_1) must draw with everyone from (V). However, (A_1) can have at most one draw, so (V) has exactly one vertex, (Y). 7. **Analyzing (Y)**: (Y) cannot draw with (A_k) since no player can have two draws. (Y) cannot lose to (A_k) because that would allow us to find a longer path. Therefore, (A_k) must lose to (Y).  8. **Draw within (U)**: If there is a draw within (U), say between (L) and (M), then one of (L) or (M) must defeat (V) (since (V) cannot take any more draws), which is impossible because we are in case 2. Thus, our assumption that the maximal oriented path does not contain all the vertices is wrong, and we are done.

Applying the reflection ( r_{A_i A_{i+2}} ), the point ( A_{i+1} ) must map to itself because ( A_{i+1} ) is between ( A_i ) and ( A_{i+2} ) on the same side.

If so, find the equation of line l; if not, explain why; (3) When the line l moves parallel to itself, find the maximum area of triangle CAB.","output":"(1) The standard form of the circle C is (x-1)^2+(y+2)^2=3^2. Therefore, the center of the circle is C(1, -2), and the radius is r = 3. (2) Suppose the circle with diameter AB is circle M, and the center of M has coordinates (a, b).  Since CM perp l, the product of their slopes is k_{CM} cdot k_{l} = -1, which means frac{b+2}{a-1} cdot 1 = -1, so a + b + 1 = 0 (1). The line l passes through the point M(a, b), so the equation of l can be written as y - b = x - a, or x - y + b - a = 0. Hence, |CM| = frac{|b-a+3|}{sqrt{2}}. Moreover, since the circle M with diameter AB passes through the origin, |MA|=|MB|=|OM|.  Now, |MB|^2 = |CB|^2 - |CM|^2 = 9 - left(frac{|b-a+3|}{sqrt{2}}right)^2, and |OM|^2 = a^2 + b^2. Thus, 9 - left(frac{|b-a+3|}{sqrt{2}}right)^2 = a^2 + b^2 (2). From equations (1) and (2), we get a = frac{3}{2} or a = -1. When a = frac{3}{2}, b = -frac{5}{2}, and the equation of line l is x - y - 4 = 0. When a = -1, b = 0, and the equation of line l is x - y + 1 = 0. Therefore, the sought after line l with a slope of 1 exists, and its equations are x - y - 4 = 0 and x - y + 1 = 0.

Solving simultaneously with x = 3, we find S(3, 5k). Let P be (x_0, y_0). Substituting this into the ellipse equation, we have frac{x_0^2}{4} + frac{y_0^2}{1} = 1 (x_0 neq pm 2).

The trapezoid has one of its angles at the larger base (AD) equal to 45^circ. We need to cut this trapezoid into three pieces and rearrange them to form a square. Here are the detailed steps: 1. **Identifying the dimensions:**    Let BC = x. Since AD is three times BC, we write:    [    AD = 3x    ] 2. **Drawing heights:**    Draw the heights from points B and C to the line AD.

This follows from the equidistribution theorem for irrational numbers.     Therefore, since left{ (sqrt{10})^n right} is dense in (0,1), it implies that all possible digits will eventually appear as the last digits of the integers left[ (sqrt{10})^n right], leading to a non-periodic sequence in their last digits.     **Conclusion:** The sequence left( a_n right) is not periodic. 2. **Sequence left( beta_n right):**     Define beta_n as the last digit of the integer part of (sqrt{2})^n.     - Consider the binary representation of sqrt{2} approx 1.414213562373095....

Suppose (d) is the greatest common divisor of (a) and (b). Then (d mid a) and considering (a mid b^2 + b + 1), it follows that (d mid 1). Hence, (d = 1), showing that (a) and (b) are relatively prime. 3. **Reduction to a Simpler Condition**:    From this, we infer that if (a) and (b) are such that (ab) divides (a^2 + b^2 + a + b + 1), then both (a mid b^2 + b + 1) and (b mid a^2 + a + 1) hold true.

The number of ways to partition A into 10 groups while maintaining the order constraint is essentially the combinatorial problem we need to solve. 4. **Combining the Elements:**    To maintain the non-descending order of f(a_i), the partitioning of A into 10 ordered groups is required. Given the sequential nature, this can be done using a combinatorial approach such as choosing positions to divide the ordered sequence into groups. 5. **Counting the Partitions:**    The problem of partitioning 100 elements into 10 non-empty groups where order matters can be translated into a problem of choosing placements for 9 dividers among 99 possible positions (since the dividers will split the sequence of 100 into 10 groups).

What is the maximum number of these points that can lie on a single circle?","output":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the maximum number of midpoint of sides and diagonals of a regular 1976-sided polygon that can lie on a single circle. We proceed step by step as follows:  I. First Solution 1. **Understanding the Problem**:     We start with a regular 1976-sided polygon. We are required to find the maximum number of midpoints of the polygon's sides and diagonals that can be on a single circle. 2. **Observation on Midpoints**:    Notice that each side and diagonal of the regular polygon has a midpoint. Thus, there are ( 1976 + binom{1976}{2} ) midpoints, counting both sides and diagonals. 3. **Circle Through 1976 Points**:    It is clear that a circle passing through 1976 such points is possible. We want to demonstrate that more than 1976 points cannot lie on one circle. 4. **Considering a Circle ( k )**:    Suppose there is a circle ( k ) containing some midpoints of the polygon's diagonals. Let us consider one diagonal to demonstrate the general scenario:    Let a diagonal be divided into two equal segments by a midpoint lying on ( k ). 5. **Analyzing Possible Configurations**:    Assume that from each vertex of the polygon, at most two diagonals have midpoints on ( k ). Since each diagonal is considered twice (once from each end), there be at most 1976 such midpoints. 6. **Examining Special Case**:    Let us consider if this is not the case and a vertex ( A ) has the midpoints of at least three diagonals on ( k ).    - Three distinct midpoints of diagonals starting from ( A ) would uniquely determine ( k ).    - If the circle ( k ) is scaled down from the circumscribed circle of the polygon, it will exactly pass through the same midpoints. 7. **Thalès's Theorem Application**:    For each diagonal touching ( A ), the midpoints of these diagonals must lie on a circle passing through a diameter, implying:    - The circle must pass through the center ( O ) of the polygon's circumscribed circle and the point ( A ). 8. **Conclusion**:    Thus, the circle ( k ) determined by vertices through which the diagonals pass would contain at most 1975 midpoints of diagonals passing through a vertex plus the center ( O ). 9. **Bounded Solution**:    Therefore, the maximum number of midpoints of sides and diagonals on a single circle cannot exceed 1976. Hence, the maximum number of midpoints that can lie on a single circle is: [ boxed{1976} ]  II. Second Solution 1. **Diagonals from a Single Vertex**:    Consider all diagonals emanating from a single vertex of the regular 1976-sided polygon.    - Among these diagonals, one is a diameter of the circumscribed circle of the polygon.    - The remaining diagonals are symmetric about this diameter. Thus, we get ( frac{1975-1}{2} = 987 ) symmetric pairs of diagonals. 2. **Lengths of Diagonals**:    Each pair of symmetric diagonals has midpoints lying on circles that are concentric with the circumscribed circle of the polygon. 3. **Number of Concentric Circles and Midpoints**:    We have 987 such concentric circles, each containing 1976 midpoints of diagonals since each symmetric diagonal pair contributes its midpoint to one concentric circle. 4. **Considering Another Circle**:    Another different circle can intersect each of these 987 concentric circles in at most two points, providing ( 1974 ) intersection points plus possibly the center point ( O ), yielding a maximum of ( 1975 ) points. 5. **Final Conclusion**:    As before, this leads to the conclusion that at most 1976 midpoints can lie on any given circle.

Since Car X was traveling at an average speed of 35 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance Car X traveled in those 1.2 hours before Car Y started. Distance = Speed × Time Distance of Car X before Car Y started = 35 mph × 1.2 hours = 42 miles Now, we know that Car X traveled an additional 49 miles after Car Y started, so the total distance Car X traveled is: Total distance of Car X = Distance before Car Y started + Distance after Car Y started Total distance of Car X = 42 miles + 49 miles = 91 miles Since both cars stopped after traveling the same distance, Car Y also traveled 91 miles. Now, we need to find out how long it took Car Y to travel those 91 miles.

To find the standard equation of circle C, we follow these steps: 1. Calculate the slope of line segment AB: [k_{AB}=frac{1-0}{1-2}=-1] 2. Since the slope of AB is -1, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have a slope of 1 (perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other). 3. The midpoint of AB is found by averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of A and B: [M_{AB} = left(frac{1+2}{2}, frac{1+0}{2}right) = left(frac{3}{2}, frac{1}{2}right)] 4. The equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB can then be determined since it has a slope of 1 and passes through M_{AB}: [y = x - 1] This simplifies to the standard form: [x - y - 1 = 0] 5. The given line x - y - 2 = 0 and the perpendicular bisector x - y - 1 = 0 are parallel because they have the same slope but different intercepts. 6. The distance between these two parallel lines, which corresponds to twice the radius of the circle, is given by the formula for distance between two parallel lines: [d = frac{|c_2 - c_1|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}] Substituting c_2 = -2, c_1 = -1, a = 1, and b = -1 gives: [d = frac{|-2 + 1|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}] 7. Since the chord intercepted by the line x - y - 2 = 0 is of length sqrt{2}, the radius of the circle is: [r = sqrt{left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)^2} = 1] 8. The center of the circle (1,0) satisfies the condition of being equidistant from A and B and lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. 9.

Prove that lambda geq 2 sin 54^{circ}, and discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for equality.","output":"1. **Introduction**: Let ( O ) be a plane containing five distinct points. Denote the maximum distance between the points as ( d_{text{max}} ) and the minimum distance as ( d_{text{min}} ). We aim to prove that the ratio ( lambda = frac{d_{text{max}}}{d_{text{min}}} ) satisfies ( lambda geq 2 sin 54^circ ), and we will discuss the necessary conditions for equality. 2. **Geometric Configuration and Analysis**:    - Consider that the five given points can form a convex pentagon. A convex pentagon has interior angles summing to ( 540^circ ), implying that each internal angle is no less than ( 108^circ ).    - Let point ( A ) be the vertex with the largest internal angle in this pentagon, and let ( B ) and ( C ) be the adjacent vertices to ( A ). 3. **Triangle Inequality**:    - In ( triangle ABC ), the internal angle at ( A ) is the largest, and thus (frac{1}{2} theta_A + theta_C leq 90^circ), leading to (theta_C leq 90^circ - frac{1}{2} theta_A).    - Given that (sin) function is increasing for acute angles, we get:      [      sin theta_C leq sin left(90^circ - frac{1}{2} theta_A right) = cos frac{1}{2} theta_A.      ] 4. **Applying the Sine Rule**:    - Applying the sine rule in ( triangle ABC ):      [      frac{a}{c} = frac{sin theta_A}{sin theta_C} geq frac{sin theta_A}{cos frac{1}{2} theta_A}.      ]    - Using the identity (cos x = sin (90^circ - x)), we rewrite it as:      [      frac{a}{c} geq frac{sin theta_A}{cos frac{1}{2} theta_A} = 2 sin frac{1}{2}theta_A.      ]    - Given (theta_A geq 108^circ), (frac{1}{2}theta_A geq 54^circ), thus yielding:      [      2 sin 54^circ leq 2 sin 54^circ.      ] 5. **Establishing the Ratio**:    - Denote ( d_{text{max}} = p ) and ( d_{text{min}} = q ). Thus, the ratio (lambda) is given by:      [      lambda = frac{p}{q}.      ]    - Using our inequality, ( frac{a}{c} geq 2 sin 54^circ ), consequently, we have:      [      lambda geq frac{a}{c} geq 2 sin 54^circ.      ] 6. **Assessing Other Cases**:    - If the five points cannot form a convex pentagon, then other configurations fall into two categories:      - **Case (i)**: There exist three collinear points among the five points, say ( A, B, C ), where ( B ) lies between ( A ) and ( C ). This setting clearly shows:        [        frac{|AC|}{min(|AB|, |BC|)} geq 2 > 2sin 54^circ.        ]      - **Case (ii)**: There exists a point ( P ) inside the triangle formed by other three points, ( triangle ABC ), leading to at least one angle (geq 120^circ):        Using the earlier proof,:        [        lambda geq 2 sin 60^circ > 2 sin 54^circ.        ] 7. **Necessary Condition for Equality**:    - If equality ( lambda = 2 sin 54^circ ) holds, the five points must form a regular pentagon. Each angle ( theta_A = 108^circ ) and adjacent equal angles (theta_B = theta_C) ensure this condition, making ( triangle ABC ) equilateral. 8. **Conclusion**:    - Based on the above analysis, we conclude that the five points forming a regular pentagon strictly satisfies:      [      lambda geq 2 sin 54^circ.      ]      [      boxed{2 sin 54^circ}      ]"},{"instruction":"Tickets to the school's dinner theatre cost 6 dollars for children and a certain amount for adults. 225 tickets were sold for a total of 1875 dollars, and 50 children attended.

To find this number, we subtract the number of students with an A or failed from the total number of students: Number of students with either a B or C = Total number of students - Number of students with an A or failed                                         = 32 - 26                                         = 6 students Now, to find the fraction of the remaining students (excluding those who got an A or failed) who got either a B or C, we divide the number of students with either a B or C by the total number of remaining students: Fraction of remaining students with either a B or C = Number of students with either a B or C / (Total number of students - Number of students with an A)                                                      = 6 / (32 - 8)                                                      = 6 / 24                                                      = 1 / 4 Therefore, boxed{1/4}  of the remaining students got either a B or C."},{"instruction":"Given that the arc length of a sector is 2pi and its area is 5pi, find the central angle of the sector in degrees.","output":"Since the arc length of the sector is 2pi and its area is 5pi, let the central angle be alpha degrees.

If x geq 4, then: [ sqrt{(x-1)^2 + 4} + (x - 4) = 6, ] so sqrt{(x-1)^2 + 4} = 10 - x.

If the car had traveled 40 km/h faster, its speed would have been ( V + 40 ) km/h. The time it would take to travel the same distance at this increased speed is ( T' = frac{D}{V + 40} ). We are told that the trip would have lasted 30 minutes less if the car had traveled at the increased speed.

Let ( x_n = overline{aa ldots ab} ), where the digit 'a' appears ( n ) times. We will analyze two cases based on whether ( x_1 ) and 10 are relatively prime. **Case 1: ( x_1 ) and 10 are not relatively prime** If ( x_1 ) and 10 share a common prime factor (which can only be 2 or 5), then this prime factor divides ( x_1 ), and consequently, it will divide every ( x_n ) in the sequence.  This can be shown by the following equation: [ x_n = x_1 + 10 left( 10 + 10^2 + 10^3 + ldots + 10^{n-1} right) a ] We observe that ( x_1 ) and the sum ( 10 ( 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{n-1} ) ) share the same divisors 2 and/or 5 that divide 10.

Such elements exist due to the Pigeonhole Principle because the remainders can be only a finite number of types while the sequence has infinitely many terms.

Thus: [ y_l - y_k = 10^k(1 + 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{l-k-1}) ] Since ( x_1 ) and 10 are relatively prime, ( x_1 ) divides ( (1 + 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{l-k-1}) ).

Part A: Given: There are three lines and ( n ) points such that there are exactly two points on either side of each line (points lying on the line are not counted). 1. **Determine how many points lie on the given lines**:     - Since for each line, there are exactly four points not lying on it, the points lying on the line must be ( n - 4 ).     - Therefore, if all lines have points not lying on them, the points lying on the lines would be ( 3(n - 4) ).     - Note that the lines can intersect at a point, and if this common intersection point is one of the marked points, we might count it multiple times.          a. If all lines intersect at one point which is a marked point, it has been counted three times.     b. If the lines do not intersect at a single point but at most in three distinct points, and if any of these are marked points, they have been double-counted. 2. **Form the inequality for the total number of points**:     - Thus, the total number of marked points on the lines must be at least ( 3(n-4) - 3 ) because we might count the intersection points additionally:     [     3(n - 4) - 3 = 3n - 12 - 3 = 3n - 15     ]     - Considering an upper limit, the maximum possible points are ( n ), hence:     [     3n - 15 leq n     ]     Simplifying this inequality:     [     3n - n leq 15 implies 2n leq 15 implies n leq frac{15}{2} implies n leq 7.5     ] 3. **Conclusion about ( n )**:     - Since ( n ) must be an integer, the possible values are ( n leq 7 ). 4. **Feasibility check**:     - We also note that there must be at least 4 points because at least two points must exist on either side of each line.     - Examples can show the possibility for each value ( n ) from 4 to 7.

Let the center of the circle be C, and let A and B be the points where the circle intersects the x-axis. The angle angle ACB formed at the center by these intersection points is 60^circ because the radius is perpendicular to the tangent (x-axis) at the point of contact. The region where the point can fall below the x-axis is a circular segment, which can be thought of as the area of a sector with a central angle of 60^circ minus the area of an equilateral triangle formed by points A, B, and C. The area of this circular sector is frac{1}{6} of the circle's total area because frac{60^circ}{360^circ} = frac{1}{6}. The area of the circle is pi r^2, where r is the radius. Given the equation of the circle, the radius r is 2, so the area of the circle is 4pi. Now, we calculate the area of the equilateral triangle, which has side length 2r. The height h of this triangle from the center can be found by considering a 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle, which gives us h = rsqrt{3} = 2sqrt{3}.

The expected earnings were 0.80 per share, with half (0.40) being distributed as dividends. Since the actual earnings were 1.10 per share, this is 0.30 more than expected. For each additional 0.10 of per share earnings, shareholders receive an additional 0.04 per share. Since the earnings exceeded expectations by 0.30, this would be 3 times the additional 0.10 increment. So, for each 0.10 increment, the dividend increases by 0.04. For 0.30 more, the dividend increases by 0.04 * 3 = 0.12. Now, we add this additional dividend to the expected dividend of 0.40 per share: 0.40 (expected dividend) + 0.12 (additional dividend) = 0.52 per share. Now, we know that a person received a total dividend of 156. To find out how many shares they own, we divide the total dividend by the dividend per share: 156 / 0.52 per share = 300 shares.

We define two counters as neighbors if they are in the same row or column and there are no other counters between them. The task is to determine the maximum number of counters that can be placed on the board such that each counter has at most three neighbors. Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Initial Considerations**:     - Each counter can have at most three neighbors, meaning in at least one direction (left, right, up, down), there is no other counter. This can be thought of as the counter \\"looking out of a window\\" on the perimeter of the chessboard where the \\"window\\" is the outer edge (perimeter) of the board.     - We can first place counters at the corners of the board. Counters in the corners do not block any other counter’s view because they are at the extreme ends. 2. **Counting Edges**:     - The perimeter (or outer frame) of the chessboard has a length calculated by 2(n + k) - 4: this is the sum of the lengths of all sides minus the four corners, which are counted twice. 3. **Placement of Counters**:     - We start by placing four counters at the four corners. Each of these counters takes up a corner \\"window\\" and does not interfere with other counters’ views.     - Placing these four corner counters covers 8 of the total \\"windows\\" from our perimeter calculation. 4. **Remaining Windows**:     - After covering the corners, we are left with 2(n + k) - 8 windows. 5. **Filling in Remaining Counters**:     - Ideally, we would fill the remaining positions on the perimeter without having any counters overlap views.     - Therefore, every remaining counter will look out of exactly one of these remaining windows. 6. **Optimal Calculation**:     - Each counter on the edge can be positioned such that it looks out one window. For example, Place counters along the edges, and they will cover the bandwidth of view without overlapping in views too much. # Concrete Calculation: - For any chessboard with n, k geq 2:     - Maximum number of counters = 2(n + k) - 4. For chessboards with very short dimensions: - **Case n = 1 or k = 1**:     - Here, each position can hold a counter, and each counter has at most two neighbors (to the left and right, or above and below). # Verification: - Through the second solution, we refine the considerations by marking each counter:     - Mark each counter that is the topmost in its column: a maximum of n counters.     - Mark each counter that is the bottommost in its column: another maximum of n counters.     - Mark each counter that is the leftmost in its row: a maximum of k counters.     - Mark each counter that is the rightmost in its row: another maximum of k counters.     - Since each corner can be marked twice, we subtract the 4 double-counted corners. Therefore, maximum number of counters still holds: [ 2k + 2n - 4. ] # Conclusion: - For the general case where n, k geq 2: [ boxed{2(n + k) - 4} ] - For the boundary cases where n = 1 or k = 1, the maximum number is the total number of squares, \`n\` or \`k\`’."},{"instruction":"how many ways can the numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) be arranged in a row so that for any three consecutive numbers (a, b, c), the expression (ac  b^2) is divisible by 7?

So, Henry's goal is to catch: 16 catfish * 3 trout/catfish = 48 trout Now, let's calculate the number of trout Henry actually catches each hour, considering the changing weather conditions and their impact on his catch rate: Hour 1: 20% efficiency Hour 2: 30% efficiency Hour 3: 50% efficiency Hour 4: 10% efficiency Hour 5: 40% efficiency Since Henry's goal is to catch 48 trout in total, we need to distribute this goal across the 5 hours, taking into account the efficiency for each hour. However, the problem does not provide a base catch rate, so we will assume that Henry can adjust his effort to meet his goal proportionally to the efficiency each hour. Let's calculate the number of trout Henry catches each hour based on the efficiency: Hour 1: 48 trout * 20% = 9.6 trout (rounded down to 9 trout) Hour 2: 48 trout * 30% = 14.4 trout (rounded down to 14 trout) Hour 3: 48 trout * 50% = 24 trout Hour 4: 48 trout * 10% = 4.8 trout (rounded down to 4 trout) Hour 5: 48 trout * 40% = 19.2 trout (rounded down to 19 trout) Adding these up, Henry catches: 9 + 14 + 24 + 4 + 19 = 70 trout However, this exceeds his goal of 48 trout.

Let us denote by O the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Note that O is equidistant from A, B, and C. Consequently, the points M and N lie on a circle centered at O due to the property that they are midpoints of arcs in this circumcircle not containing the respective opposite vertex. 4.

Here, I denotes the incenter, and Z is another crucial point related to the angular bisections. 6. Given that P and Q are points such that PQ perp IZ as confirmed in previous steps, and knowing that:    [    PQ perp BI    ]    we recognize that PQ has a specific perpendicular relationship with respect to incenter I. This implies P and Q are situated critical distances maintaining perpendicularity. 7.

Solving the equation for x: begin{align*} frac{300}{x} &= 4 times frac{300}{x + 0.6}  Rightarrow frac{1}{x} &= 4 times frac{1}{x + 0.6}  Rightarrow x &= 0.2 end{align*} - Therefore, the average refueling cost per kilometer for the fuel vehicle is x + 0.6 = 0.2 + 0.6 = 0.8 yuan. So, the average charging cost per kilometer for this electric vehicle is boxed{0.2} yuan, and the average refueling cost per kilometer for the fuel vehicle is boxed{0.8} yuan.  Part (3) Let the annual mileage be y kilometers. The annual cost for each vehicle type includes both the travel cost and other annual costs. For the electric vehicle, the annual cost is 0.2y + 7800, and for the fuel vehicle, it is 0.8y + 4800. - We want to find when the annual cost of the electric vehicle is lower than that of the fuel vehicle, which can be expressed as 0.2y + 7800 < 0.8y + 4800. Solving the inequality for y: begin{align*} 0.2y + 7800 &< 0.8y + 4800  7800 - 4800 &< 0.8y - 0.2y  3000 &< 0.6y  y &> 5000 end{align*} Therefore, the annual cost of buying an electric vehicle is lower when the annual mileage exceeds boxed{5000} kilometers."},{"instruction":"Bobby received his weekly paycheck today.

The radius OE (or OF) is 10 units. By the Pythagorean Theorem in right triangle OXE, we have: [ OX^2 + EX^2 = OE^2  OX^2 = OE^2 - EX^2  OX^2 = 10^2 - 6^2  OX = sqrt{100 - 36} = sqrt{64} = 8 text{ units}. ] Now, we draw a perpendicular segment from F to MA, denoting the foot of the perpendicular as Y. Since OXE is a right triangle and F is symmetric to E concerning O, the segment FY will also be 8 units, the same as OX. The area of triangle MEF can now be calculated using the base EF and the height FY: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 12 times 8 = 48 text{ square units}. ] Thus, the area of triangle MEF is boxed{48} square units."},{"instruction":"Given functions f(x) = frac{1}{2}x^{2} and g(x) = aln x (a > 0). 1.

When F'(x) > 0, we have x > e^{-frac{1}{2}}; when F'(x) < 0, we have 0 < x < e^{-frac{1}{2}}. Thus, F(x) is decreasing on (0, e^{-frac{1}{2}}] and increasing on [e^{-frac{1}{2}}, +infty). Therefore, F(x)_{min} = F(e^{-frac{1}{2}}) = -frac{a}{4e} and F(x) has no maximum value. 2. G(x) = frac{1}{2}x^{2} - aln x + (a - 1)x. Then, G'(x) = x - frac{a}{x} + a - 1 = frac{(x + a)(x - 1)}{x}. Given a > 0 and frac{1}{e} < x < e, we have G(x) is decreasing on (frac{1}{e}, 1] and increasing on [1, e).

Thus, the range of a is (frac{2e - 1}{2e^{2} + 2e}, frac{1}{2}). 3. If 0 < a leqslant 2, then h'(x) = -frac{x^{2} - ax + 1}{x^{2}} leqslant 0 on (0, +infty). This implies that h(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty) and h(x_2) - h(x_1) < 0. Hence, h(x_2) - h(x_1) does not have a maximum value, and we must have a > 2. Now, the equation x^{2} - ax + 1 = 0 has two distinct positive real roots, denoted by m and n with 0 < m < 1 < n. It follows that h(x) is decreasing on (0, m), increasing on (m, n), and decreasing on (n, +infty). For any x_1 in (0, 1), h(x_1) geqslant h(m); for any x_2 in (1, +infty), h(x_2) leqslant h(n).

Substituting a = m + n = frac{1}{n} + n and m = frac{1}{n} into the above expression gives M(a) = 2[(frac{1}{n} + n)ln n + (frac{1}{n} - n)]. Since 2 < a leqslant e + frac{1}{e}, we have frac{1}{n} + n leqslant e + frac{1}{e} and n > 1. From the monotonicity of y = x + frac{1}{x} on (1, +infty), we obtain n in (1, e].

When the sergeant stands in the formation, denote by m the number of recruits standing to the left of the sergeant and facing him, and by n the number of recruits standing to the right of the sergeant and facing him. 2. Assume initially the sergeant stands at the leftmost position in the formation. Then there is nobody to the left of him, hence m = 0. 3. If there is also nobody on the right side facing him (n = 0), then the problem is trivially solved. If there are recruits on the right side facing the sergeant (n > 0), we proceed as follows: 4. Let the sergeant move from left to right along the line of recruits. If he passes a recruit facing away from him (back to him), then the number m increases by 1, but n does not change. 5. If the sergeant passes a recruit facing towards him, then the number n decreases by 1, but m does not change. 6. If the sergeant passes a recruit who has turned around (facing towards or facing away), neither m nor n changes. 7. Observe how the expression m - n changes as the sergeant moves to the right. Initially, m - n is negative because m = 0 and n > 0. During the sergeant's movement, m - n can only change by increments or decrements of 1. 8. When the sergeant reaches the rightmost position, the number n will be zero (because no recruits are standing to the right facing the sergeant). Consequently, the value of m - n will be non-negative at this point.  9. Starting from a negative number m - n and changing in increments of one, we must pass through zero at some point. This means at a certain position, m - n equals zero. 10. At this moment, m = n, and there are equal numbers of recruits standing to the right and left of the sergeant facing him. 11. Therefore, at some point, the sergeant will find himself with the same number of recruits on both sides facing him.

Specifically, (pi(k)) denotes the seat number that the participant originally sitting at seat ( k ) moves to. 3. We need to show that there exist distinct indices ( i ) and ( j ) such that the number of participants between them before and after the break is the same when the differences are calculated modulo ( 2n ). This translates to proving there are ( i ) and ( j ) with ( | pi(i) - pi(j) | equiv | i - j | mod 2n ). 4. First, consider the possibility where the differences ( pi(i) - i ) are distinct modulo ( 2n ). In this scenario, the values taken by ( pi(i) - i mod 2n ) are precisely ( 0, 1, ldots, 2n-1 ). 5.

Because ( n(2n-1) ) modulo ( 2n ) is not zero but the sum was calculated as zero, we encounter a contradiction. 9.

The total number is obtained by:      [      sum_{j=1}^{k-1} (k-j) = k(1 + 2 + cdots + (k-1)) = k cdot frac{(k-1)k}{2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2}.      ] 4. **Total Number of Subpolygons**:    [    k + frac{k(k-1)}{2} = frac{k(k+1)}{2}.    ] 5. **Check All Sides and Diagonals**:    - The edges of the triangles (0, i, k+i) are either extending from vertex A_0 or connecting vertices like A_iA_{k+i}.     - These coincide with diagonals of the four-sided polygons identified in the second group, hence ensuring all sides and diagonals are used. 6. **Sum of Edges/Dagonals**:    - The total edge/dagonal sums form:      [      3k + 4(frac{k(k-1)}{2}) = 3k + 2k^2 - 2k = k(2k+1) = binom{2k+1}{2},      ]    - this matches the total number of sides and diagonals in the n-gon. Thus, all edges and diagonals of the original n-gon are captured in these subpolygons.  Part 2: Minimum Value of ( m ) 1. **Establish Upper Bound**:    - From part 1, the maximum number of subpolygons needed can be calculated as:      [      frac{k(k+1)}{2} = frac{(n-1)/2 cdot (n+1)/2}{2} = frac{(n^2 - 1)/4}{2} = frac{n^2 - 1}{8}.      ] 2. **Using Invariants**:     - Split the n-gon into two halves via a line through the polygons. Each half will approximately consist k and k+1 vertices respectively.     - The lines defining the bisected polygons will at most cross k(k+1) segments, with each polygon contributing two segments each. 3. **Prove Lower Bound**:    - Minimally, any arrangement must satisfy at least:      [      frac{k(k+1)}{2}.      ] Considering all the factors, the smallest confirming number ( m ) is exactly: [ boxed{frac{k(k+1)}{2}}. ]"},{"instruction":"The polynomial (x+y)^{11} is expanded in decreasing powers of x.

The recipe calls for 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade. To find the total amount of liquid in one drink, we add these two amounts together: 1/4 cup (iced tea) + 1 1/4 cups (lemonade) = 1/4 + 5/4 = 6/4 cups Now, we simplify 6/4 cups to get the total amount of liquid in one drink: 6/4 cups = 3/2 cups The ratio of lemonade to the total liquid in one drink is the amount of lemonade (1 1/4 cups) divided by the total liquid (3/2 cups): 1 1/4 cups (lemonade) / 3/2 cups (total liquid) = 5/4 cups / 3/2 cups To simplify this, we multiply by the reciprocal of 3/2: (5/4) * (2/3) = 10/12 Simplify the fraction: 10/12 = 5/6 This means that for every drink, 5/6 of the cup is lemonade. Now, we need to find out how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher if it contains 18 cups of the drink.

The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to both circles. 3. **Power of a point concept:**    The power of a point (S) with respect to a circle with center (O) and radius (r) is given by:    [    text{Power}(S) = |OS|^2 - r^2    ]    Alternatively, if (S) lies on the line segment joining two points on the circle, say (A) and (C), the power of (S) with respect to the circle can also be computed as:    [    text{Power}(S, k) = -|AS| cdot |CS|    ] 4. **Computing the power of (S):**    Since (S) is the intersection of the diagonals (AC) and (BD) of the square (ABCD):    - The length of the diagonals is equal, and they intersect at their midpoints.    - Therefore, (S) is equidistant from all four vertices of the square.

This statement is actually correct, contradicting the provided solution.  **B**: The square root of sqrt{16} is first evaluated. Since sqrt{16} = 4, we then consider the square root of 4, which is sqrt{4} = 2.

It is allowed to transfer some amount of liquid from one glass to another (the solution is evenly mixed). Can you obtain a solution in the first glass where the percentage of alcohol is higher than in the second glass using such operations?","output":"1. **Define the Problem Clearly:**    Let’s consider we have two glasses. The first glass contains a certain amount of water, and the second glass contains the same amount of alcohol. For this problem, we can assume that both the water and alcohol volumes are (100) grams each for simplicity. The goal is to determine if it's possible to achieve a situation where the alcohol concentration in the first glass is higher than in the second glass through the allowed operations of pouring liquid from one glass to another and mixing uniformly. 2. **Initial State:**    - The first glass contains (100) grams of water.    - The second glass contains (100) grams of alcohol.    - Initial state has 0% alcohol in the water and 100% alcohol in the alcohol. 3. **Statement of Inductive Hypothesis:**    Initially, the first glass has 100 grams of water (0% alcohol), and the second glass has 100 grams of alcohol (100% alcohol). This hypothesis is our base case; now we will use mathematical induction for subsequent mixings. 4. **First Transfer and Mixing:**    Assume we transfer (x) grams of liquid from the first glass (water) to the second glass (alcohol). After transferring and mixing, the second glass now has (100 + x) grams of solution with (x) grams of water and (100) grams of alcohol. 5. **Concentration After First Transfer:**    The concentration of alcohol in the second glass becomes:    [    frac{100}{100+x}    ]    The concentration of water in the second glass is:    [    1 - frac{100}{100+x} = frac{x}{100+x}    ] 6. **Second Transfer and New Mixture:**    Now, let’s transfer (y) grams of mixed solution from the second glass back to the first glass.

Thus, it is never possible to make the concentration of alcohol in the first glass higher than in the second glass through these operations.

This is the same principle that the sun's rays are considered to be parallel when they reach the Earth due to the vast distance to the sun compared to the Earth's size. When the rays are parallel like this, they will produce an illuminated region that creates a perfect hemispherical boundary. 5. **No Finite Point**:    If the light source is at any finite distance, it won't produce an exactly half-illuminated sphere. The reason being, the rays will diverge or converge to a point, causing the area of illumination to be more than or less than half of the sphere as the source moves closer or farther (but still finite distance). 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, we determine that there is no specific finite location for a light source to illuminate exactly half of a sphere.

In detail:         - We could draw 13 cards from each of three suits: (13 times 3 = 39) cards.         - Additionally, the 2 joker cards can also be drawn.         - Hence, we can draw a total of (39 + 2 = 41) cards without necessarily having 2 cards from the fourth suit. 5. **Ensuring the Solution**:     - After drawing these 41 cards, every subsequent card drawn must contribute towards having 2 cards in each suit since we have already attained the maximum cards we can without achieving this condition.     - We need to draw 2 more cards to guarantee that we get at least 2 cards of the fourth suit. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, the total number of cards that need to be drawn to ensure that we have at least 2 cards of each suit in the worst-case scenario is:     [     41 + 2 = 43     ] The detailed derivation confirms that the answer to the problem is: [ boxed{43} ]"},{"instruction":"a rectangle PQRS, angle R is trisected by lines overline{RI} and overline{RJ}, where I is on overline{PQ}, and J is on overline{PS}.

To begin with, we will prove a lemma which will be useful later. # Lemma: Define a_k = frac{1}{k^2} + frac{1}{k^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1}. We claim that a_k > a_{k+1} for any positive integer k.  Proof of Lemma: First observe that a_k consists of 2k+1 terms. Let's examine the sum of the first k terms and the last k+1 terms separately.   - Sum of the first k terms is      frac{1}{k^2} + frac{1}{k^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{k^2 + k - 1}.      Comparing this to frac{k}{k^2 + k - 1}, we note that      frac{1}{k^2} + cdots + frac{1}{k^2 + k - 1} > frac{k}{k^2 + k - 1} > frac{k}{k^2 + k} = frac{1}{k + 1}.    - Sum of the last k+1 terms is      frac{1}{k^2 + k} + frac{1}{k^2 + k + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1}.      Comparing this to frac{k+1}{k^2 + 2k}, we note that      frac{1}{k^2 + k} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1} < frac{k+1}{k^2 + k} < frac{1}{k}.    From the above examinations, it follows that frac{1}{k + 1} < frac{1}{k^2} + frac{1}{k^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{k^2 + k - 1} < frac{1}{k}, and similarly, frac{1}{k + 1} < frac{1}{k^2 + k} + frac{1}{k^2 + k + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1} < frac{1}{k}.  Adding the two inequalities: frac{2}{k + 1} < a_k < frac{2}{k}.  Therefore, we have a_k > frac{2}{k + 1} > a_{k + 1}, proving the lemma. # Main Proof: Now, let us return to the original problem. Define  S_n = frac{(-1)^{[sqrt{4}]}}{4} + frac{(-1)^{[sqrt{5}]}}{5} + cdots + frac{(-1)^{[sqrt{n}]}}{n}. For a positive integer m geq 2, let m^2 leq n < (m + 1)^2. Then [sqrt{n}] = m. Thus we can write S_n as: S_n = left(frac{1}{2^2} + frac{1}{2^2+1} + cdots + frac{1}{3^2-1}right) - left(frac{1}{3^2} + frac{1}{3^2+1} + cdots + frac{1}{4^2-1}right) + cdots + (-1)^{m-1} left(frac{1}{(m-1)^2} + cdots + frac{1}{m^2-1}right) + (-1)^m left(frac{1}{m^2} + cdots + frac{1}{n}right).  Introduce: a_k = frac{1}{k^2} + frac{1}{k^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(k+1)^2 - 1}, quad k = 2, 3, ldots, m - 1, and  a_m = frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{m^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{n}, quad n leq (m+1)^2 - 1.  Hence, we have: S_n = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - cdots + (-1)^k a_k + (-1)^m a_m.  Note that: a_m leq frac{1}{m^2} + frac{1}{m^2 + 1} + cdots + frac{1}{(m+1)^2 - 1} = a_{k+1}.  From the lemma, we know that a_2 > a_3 > cdots > a_k > a_{k+1} geq a_m. When m is even: S_n = a_2 - (a_3 - a_4) - (a_5 - a_6) - cdots - (a_{m-1} - a_m) < a_2.  When m is odd: S_n = a_2 - (a_3 - a_4) - (a_5 - a_6) - cdots - (a_{m-2} - a_{m-1}) - a_m < a_2.  Hence, for any positive integer m geq 2, we get S_n < a_2. Finally, note that: a_2 = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{8} < 1, thus S_n < 1. Similarly, S_n = a_2 - (a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - cdots + (-1)^m cdots) > a_2 - a_3 > 0.  Combining these results, for any positive integer n geq 4, we have shown that: 0 < S_n < 1.  # Conclusion: boxed{0 < frac{(-1)^{[sqrt{4}]}}{4} + cdots + frac{(-1)^{[sqrt{n}]}}{n} < 1}"},{"instruction":"Volodya wants to make a set of cubes of the same size and write one digit on each face of every cube so that it is possible to form any 30digit number from these cubes.

Time to wash one normal car = time for windows + time for body + time for tires + time for waxing Time for one normal car = 4 minutes + 7 minutes + 4 minutes + 9 minutes Time for one normal car = 24 minutes Now, let's calculate the total time William spent washing the two normal cars. Time for two normal cars = 2 * time for one normal car Time for two normal cars = 2 * 24 minutes Time for two normal cars = 48 minutes Since William spent 96 minutes washing all the vehicles, we can find the time he spent washing the big SUV by subtracting the time for the two normal cars from the total time. Time for big SUV = total time - time for two normal cars Time for big SUV = 96 minutes - 48 minutes Time for big SUV = 48 minutes Now, we have the time for the big SUV and the time for one normal car. To find the ratio of the time taken to wash the big SUV to the time taken to wash a normal car, we divide the time for the big SUV by the time for one normal car.

However, the question asks for the ratio of dogs to cats to bunnies, but it does not provide the number of cats in stock.  Since we only have information about dogs and bunnies, we can only calculate the ratio of dogs to bunnies. To find the number of bunnies, we subtract the number of dogs from the total number of dogs and bunnies: Number of bunnies = Total number of dogs and bunnies - Number of dogs Number of bunnies = 375 - 75 Number of bunnies = 300 Now we have the number of dogs (75) and the number of bunnies (300). The ratio of dogs to bunnies is: Dogs : Bunnies = 75 : 300 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 75 in this case: Dogs : Bunnies = 75/75 : 300/75 Dogs : Bunnies = 1 : 4 So the ratio of dogs to bunnies in stock is boxed{1:4} .

It must hold that:      [      P_{text{leading}} geq 29      ]      because if ( P_{text{leading}} leq 28 ), then the total points of the remaining teams would sum up to:      [      28 + 27 + 26 + ldots + 9 = frac{(28+9) times 20}{2} = 370 text{ points}      ]      which is impossible since it should at least be 380 points (generated from 190 matches in one round). 5. **Points in the Second Round**: Because the leading team's points are at least 29 after the first round, it should continue to perform well in the second round. Considering it must win (or at least draw) several matches to maintain the high score:      - Therefore, the leading team would likely score at least 39 points (gaining more points in the second round). 6. **Contradiction Observed**: If the above assumption was correct, the leading team’s points in two rounds would exceed 38, which contradicts the average points calculated across all teams. Thus, it verifies that there must be at least one pair of teams that each won one game against the other. **Conclusion**: As a result of a contradiction in the assumption that no such pair exists, it confirms that there certainly are two teams where each team won one match against the other.

Let's consider a trapezoid ( ABCD ) with legs ( AB ) and ( CD ) equal to ( a ) and ( b ) respectively, and let ( O ) be the center of the circumscribed circle. 2. We know that the incenter (center of the incircle) of a trapezoid lies on the angle bisectors of the angles at the base of the trapezoid. 3. We start by examining the sum of the angles (angle BAC + angle ABC). Since (O) lies on the bisectors of both angles, we have: [ angle BAO + angle ABO = frac{1}{2} angle BAD + frac{1}{2} angle ABC = frac{1}{2} (angle BAD + angle ABC) = frac{1}{2} cdot 180^circ = 90^circ ] 4.

For q = 2, we have a_n = 2^{n-1}.   For q = -2, we have a_n = (-2)^{n-1}.   Thus, the general term of {a_n} is a_n = 2^{n-1} when q = 2 and a_n = (-2)^{n-1} when q = -2.

This creates a contradiction:    - If (a) and (b) are both odd, then (a + b) is even.    - If one of (a) or (b) is odd and the other is even, (a + b) would be odd.        Therefore, among the three numbers (a), (b), and (c), at least two numbers must have the same parity (both even or both odd).    - If both are odd, their sum is even, contradicting our condition that the sum is a power of three.    - If both are even, their sum is even, again contradicting our condition that the sum is a power of three. 6. **Conclusion:**    Since we have shown that there cannot exist three natural numbers such that the sum of any two of them is a power of three (due to the parity arguments), we conclude:        [ boxed{text{No such numbers exist.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that F is the left focus of the hyperbola C: frac{x^2}{4}  frac{y^2}{12} = 1, point A is (1,4), and P is a point on the right branch of C.

In each scenario, we consider possible pairs of paths going from one port to another.    ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_f4319cad953e6ec80578g-69.jpg?height=583&width=580&top_left_y=532&top_left_x=745)    Here is a graphical representation. Let's consider paths from port 1 to port 3 and from port 2 to port 4. We will denote pairs as ( 1 rightarrow 3, 2 rightarrow 4 ). 2. **Pairs of Paths**:    For every pair of paths ( 1 rightarrow 3, 2 rightarrow 4 ), there must be at least one common point (a branching point or a port). Let's choose among them point ( M ) of the path ( 1 rightarrow 3 ) that is closest to port 1. Now, switch the \\"tails\\" of the paths starting from this point ( M ). This will result in a new pair of paths ( 1 rightarrow 4, 2 rightarrow 3 ). 3. **Uniqueness and Count**:    Different pairs of paths ( 1 rightarrow 3, 2 rightarrow 4 ) correspond uniquely to different pairs of paths ( 1 rightarrow 4, 2 rightarrow 3 ), because point ( M ) and the operation of swapping \\"tails\\" are uniquely determined. 4. **Deriving an Inequality**:    From these steps, we derive the inequality ( f_{14} f_{23} geq f_{13} f_{24} ), since the left side represents the total number of pairs of paths ( 1 rightarrow 4, 2 rightarrow 3 ) (specifically, the number of pairs of paths ( 1 rightarrow 4, 2 rightarrow 3 ) without common points).

Define even mappings as those that maintain the \\"orientation of the triangle\\" (e.g., ( 1 rightarrow 4, 2 rightarrow 5, 3 rightarrow 6 )), and if two numbers are swapped, the parity changes.  6. **Examining Triples of Paths**:    Consider triples of paths ( 1 rightarrow i, 2 rightarrow j, 3 rightarrow k ), where ( (i, j, k) ) is a permutation of ( (4,5,6) ). If two of these paths share at least one common point, choose the earliest common point ( M ), and swap the \\"tails\\" passing through it.    Notice that this operation changes the parity of the triples. This results in a mutually one-to-one correspondence between even and odd triples of paths. 7. **Conclusion with Inequality**:    Each triple of paths without any common points must be odd. Hence, there are at least as many odd as there are even triples. From this, it follows that the required inequality holds.

Therefore:     [     begin{aligned}     1 &= (1 - cos(angle A)^2)(1 - cos(angle B)^2) + cos(angle A)^2 + cos(angle B)^2 - cos(angle A)^2 cos(angle B)^2      &= sin(angle A)^2 sin(angle B)^2 + cos(angle A)^2 + cos(angle B)^2 - cos(angle A)^2 cos(angle B)^2      &= (cos(angle A) cos(angle B) + cos(angle C))^2 + cos(angle A)^2 + cos(angle B)^2 - cos(angle A)^2 cos(angle B)^2      &= cos(angle A)^2 + cos(angle B)^2 + cos(angle C)^2 + 2 cos(angle A) cos(angle B) cos(angle C)     end{aligned}     ] 13. Let S_1 = cos(angle A) + cos(angle B) + cos(angle C) and S_2 = cos(angle A)^2 + cos(angle B)^2 + cos(angle C)^2, then:     [     Delta = S_1^2 + S_2 - 2 S_1     ] 14. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:     [     S_2 geq frac{S_1^2}{3}     ] 15. Hence:     [     Delta geq frac{2}{3} S_1 (2 S_1 - 3)     ] 16.

In this case, we are given two amounts (A) for two different times (t), but we are not given the number of times the interest is compounded per year (n).

For the first scenario (after 2 years): A1 = P(1 + r)^2 = 17640 For the second scenario (after 3 years): A2 = P(1 + r)^3 = 22932 We can create a system of equations with these two scenarios. First, let's solve the first equation for P: P = A1 / (1 + r)^2 Now, let's substitute this expression for P into the second equation: A2 = (A1 / (1 + r)^2) * (1 + r)^3 A2 = A1 * (1 + r) Now we can solve for r: 22932 = 17640 * (1 + r) 1 + r = 22932 / 17640 1 + r = 1.3 Now subtract 1 from both sides to find r: r = 1.3 - 1 r = 0.3 To express r as a percentage, we multiply by 100: r = 0.3 * 100 r = 30% Therefore, the annual interest rate is boxed{30%} ."},{"instruction":"The graph of the function y= sqrt {3}cos x+sin x, (xin mathbb{R}) is translated to the right by theta (theta>0) units.

Since m=2^a, and n = m cdot t = 2^a t, thus frac{n}{m} = t. Hence 2^t mid k.     - Combining this, we determine the smallest such k = 2^t.

Consider the quadratic trinomial that indeed has roots, such as ( x^2 + x - 6 ). 2.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Establish General Conditions**:    Each subset ( A_i = {a_i, b_i, c_i} ) satisfies ( a_i < b_i < c_i ). 2. **Choosing ( b_i )**:        Note that for any ( b_i in {2, 3, ldots, n-1} ):    - ( a_i ) must be one of the elements from ( {1, 2, ldots, b_i - 1} ).    - ( c_i ) must be one of the elements from ( {b_i + 1, b_i + 2, ldots, n} ). 3. **Counting Possible Pairs**:    For each ( b_i = k ) with ( k in {2, 3, ldots, n-1} ):    - The number of choices for ( a_i ) is ( k - 1 ).    - The number of choices for ( c_i ) is ( n - k ).

The radius of the circle is 8, and we know from circle geometry that the perpendicular bisector of any chord passes through the center. Hence, OT is perpendicular to PQ. Since RS bisects PQ, OT is vertical and RS is horizontal. Consider triangle OPT. Using Pythagoras' theorem, the distance OT=sqrt{8^2-x^2}.

By definition, ( widehat{x} = widehat{y} ) implies ( x equiv y pmod{n} ), which means ( n mid (x - y) ). 3. We need to show that ( widehat{f(x)} = widehat{f(y)} ). This is equivalent to showing that ( f(x) equiv f(y) pmod{n} ). 4. Since ( f in mathbb{Z}[X] ), ( f(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, ( f(x) - f(y) ) can be written as:    [    f(x) - f(y) = a_k(x^k - y^k) + a_{k-1}(x^{k-1} - y^{k-1}) + cdots + a_1(x - y)    ] 5.

Since ( M = |f(x_0) - f(0)| ), we have ( widehat{f(x_0)} = widehat{f(0)} ) in ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ). 6. This implies ( f_M(widehat{0}) = f_M(widehat{x_0}) ), but ( widehat{x_0} neq widehat{0} ) in ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ). 7. Since ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ) is finite, for ( f_M ) to be surjective, it must be injective.

We need to check the conditions for ( f_n ) to be surjective. 10. If ( a = 0 ), then ( f(X) = b ), and ( f_n(widehat{x}) = widehat{b} ) for all ( widehat{x} in mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ).

We solve the equations:    - ( 3x + 2 = 1 ):      [      3x + 2 = 1 implies 3x = -1 implies x = -frac{1}{3} quad (text{not an integer})      ]    - ( 5x - 14 = 1 ):      [      5x - 14 = 1 implies 5x = 15 implies x = 3 quad (text{integer})      ]    - ( 3x + 2 = -1 ):      [      3x + 2 = -1 implies 3x = -3 implies x = -1 quad (text{integer})      ]    - ( 5x - 14 = -1 ):      [      5x - 14 = -1 implies 5x = 13 implies x = frac{13}{5} quad (text{not an integer})      ] 5. Therefore, the integer solutions for ( x ) are ( x = 3 ) and ( x = -1 ). 6. We verify that these values make the expression a prime number:    - For ( x = 3 ):      [      |(3(3) + 2)(5(3) - 14)| = |(9 + 2)(15 - 14)| = |11 cdot 1| = 11 quad (text{prime})      ]    - For ( x = -1 ):      [      |(3(-1) + 2)(5(-1) - 14)| = |(-3 + 2)(-5 - 14)| = |-1 cdot -19| = 19 quad (text{prime})      ] 7.

To prove this, we construct such a sequence using recursion. Let's start with an initial sequence of ([0, 1]). Assume we have reached a part of the sequence containing (k) numbers, where every number occurs from (0) to ((n-1)! - 1). Moreover, for every (m leq (n-2)! - 1), there exists an (l < k) such that (l mid k) and the (i)-th and ((i + l))-th elements are congruent modulo (m). Now, to extend the sequence, we repeat the first (k) elements. For the next steps, for (0 < i leq 2k), we define: [ a_{i + 2k} = a_{i} + (n-1)! ] [ a_{i + 2cdot2k} = a_{i} + 2 cdot (n-1)! ] [ a_{i + (n-1)cdot2k} = a_{i} + (n-1) cdot (n-1)! ] Thus, for (k_2 = n cdot 2k), it also holds: 1. Every number less than ((n! - 1)) appears at least once. 2. For every (m leq ((n-1)! - 1)), there exists (l < k_2) such that (l mid k_2) and (a_{i} = a_{i+l} (mod m)) for all (i). This recursive construction ensures that every natural number will eventually be included in the sequence and will appear infinitely often. To guarantee that every number appears infinitely often, note that we are doubling the sequence every step. Therefore, if a number initially appears at least once (which every number does), then for any integer (alpha > 0), the number will appear (2^alpha) times, and hence infinitely often in subsequent duplications of the sequence. Thus, the constructed sequence satisfies the given requirements.

We can then use this to determine the area of the triangle formed by these vectors, which would be half the area of the parallelogram. There are 4 vectors that meet the conditions: begin{aligned} boldsymbol{alpha}_1 &= (2, 1),  boldsymbol{alpha}_2 &= (2, 3),  boldsymbol{alpha}_3 &= (4, 1),  boldsymbol{alpha}_4 &= (4, 3). end{aligned} To form a triangle, we will select two vectors out of these four, giving us binom{4}{2} = 6 possible combinations. Next, we need to identify which pair(s) of vectors result in a triangle with an area of 1. We calculate the areas using the cross product formula: For boldsymbol{alpha}_1 and boldsymbol{alpha}_2, we have: |boldsymbol{alpha}_1 times boldsymbol{alpha}_2| = |2 cdot 3 - 1 cdot 2| = |6 - 2| = 4 The area of the corresponding triangle would be frac{1}{2} cdot 4 = 2, which is not 1. For boldsymbol{alpha}_1 and boldsymbol{alpha}_3, we have: |boldsymbol{alpha}_1 times boldsymbol{alpha}_3| = |2 cdot 1 - 1 cdot 4| = |2 - 4| = 2 The area of the corresponding triangle would be frac{1}{2} cdot 2 = 1, which is the desired area. For boldsymbol{alpha}_1 and boldsymbol{alpha}_4, we have: |boldsymbol{alpha}_1 times boldsymbol{alpha}_4| = |2 cdot 3 - 1 cdot 4| = |6 - 4| = 2 Once again, the area of the corresponding triangle would be 1. We don't need to check the other combinations since they will either result in larger parallelograms (and thus larger triangles) or involve vectors we have already checked. Therefore, there are 2 combinations that yield a triangle with an area of 1 out of a total of 6 possible combinations.

Since each pizza is cut into 12 slices, the total number of slices is: 2 pizzas * 12 slices per pizza = 24 slices Now, let's denote the percentage of the pizza that Stephen ate as S (in decimal form). After Stephen ate S percent of the pizza, there were (1 - S) * 24 slices left. Pete then ate 50% of the remaining pizza, which means he ate 0.5 * (1 - S) * 24 slices. After Pete ate his share, there were 9 slices left.

Since Masud has 60 siblings, four times that amount would be: 4 * 60 = 240 Now, Janet has 60 less than this amount, so: Janet's siblings = 240 - 60 = 180 Next, we know that Janet has 135 more siblings than Carlos. So, if we let C represent the number of siblings Carlos has, we can write: Janet's siblings = Carlos's siblings + 135 We already know Janet's siblings number is 180, so: 180 = C + 135 Now, we can solve for C: C = 180 - 135 C = 45 Carlos has 45 siblings. Now, we want to find the ratio of Carlos's siblings to Masud's siblings. Since Carlos has 45 siblings and Masud has 60 siblings, the ratio is: Carlos's siblings : Masud's siblings = 45 : 60 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 15: 45 ÷ 15 : 60 ÷ 15 = 3 : 4 Therefore, the ratio of Carlos's siblings to Masud's siblings is boxed{3:4} ."},{"instruction":"a given circle, the diameter overline{EB} is parallel to overline{DC}, and overline{AB} is parallel to overline{ED}.

Playful, childlike, and full of boundless creativity, he exudes an infectious enthusiasm that spreads like wildfire. With the power to manipulate plot, bend reality, and traverse dimensions, he is a force to be reckoned with. Despite his immense abilities, Alex remains kind-hearted, loyal, and always sees the best in people. His cheerful appearance, sparkling blue eyes, and impossibly wide grin elevate the spirits of those around him, even in the darkest of times. Alex’s intelligence and unwavering moral compass make him a formidable ally and a beacon of hope in the multiverse. With control over his dark side, he can tap into untold power and mastery. In his journeys, he encounters friends and foes from all walks of life, spreading love, joy, and laughter wherever his presence is felt. Alex Morrison, a name synonymous with optimism, happiness, and the never-ending pursuit of making the world a brighter place, SCP-835-JP is currently not contained due to its elusive nature. In the event of a suspicious death of a Foundation employee associated with SCP-835-JP, Mobile Task Force Ku-3 “Bonfire” is to secure the area and conduct an investigation. Whenever possible, the deaths should be disguised as unrelated incidents to minimize the impact on morale within the Foundation, SCP-835-JP, also known as “Keteru Yamiko,” has been neutralized using Protocol Idol-835, as described below. Research is ongoing to explore the possibility of expanding the protocol beyond the Foundation to address potential containment breaches resulting from major cognitohazardous events or similar incidents, SCP-835-JP appears as a teenage girl with long black hair, typically wearing black school uniforms. While her age and appearance can vary, she is generally considered attractive. SCP-835-JP is often described as melancholic due to her reserved nature and lack of emotional expression, and she strongly dislikes being observed by others. “Keteru Yamiko” possesses the ability to teleport between dark areas regardless of distance or obstacles. She utilizes this ability to rapidly approach, attack, and kill her targets using a large kitchen knife. SCP-835-JP is also capable of manipulating darkness at will, causing objects to disappear into it. The mechanism behind this ability remains unknown. It is believed that these powers were harnessed and developed during her abduction and training as an assassin by a rival Group of Interest. Her experiences during this period likely contributed to her current personality, SCP-835-JP originally manifested exclusively to Foundation personnel and was first observed in 19██. The phenomenon occurs in cycles lasting approximately 1 to 3 months, during which the affected individual disappears within seconds to minutes after encountering SCP-835-JP. Subsequent investigations have failed to locate any missing individuals, dead or alive. Blood left at the scene indicates that the subject sustained fatal injuries prior to their disappearance. The only consistent factors in these cases are the victim’s affiliation with the Foundation and the occurrence of the event in poorly lit areas with limited visibility. Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-835-JP and the complete lack of remaining evidence or witnesses, no successful experimental observations of the phenomenon have been conducted. Consequently, its true nature and mechanics remain unknown. Based on the limited information obtained from witness testimonies and surveillance footage, it is known that victims appear to be under attack by an imperceptible entity, although the existence of this attacker has never been definitively confirmed, On ██/██/20██, a booklet titled “Artist’s Impression of SCP-835-JP” was discovered on the desk of Research Assistant ██. The booklet contained hand-drawn illustrations of an anime-style girl, subsequently named “Keteru Yamiko.” Detailed descriptions of her personality, background, and abilities were included. The booklet was promptly reported to Head Researcher ███, who determined that Research Assistant ██ was the creator and confiscated the booklet. Research Assistant ██ confessed ownership of the booklet and was subsequently transferred after a brief suspension, After the occurrence of Incident 835, which involved the identification and confiscation of the booklet, instances of SCP-835-JP ceased to manifest for a period of approximately 5 months. In response to this prolonged hiatus, Dr. ██ proposed and implemented Protocol Idol-835, all of the SCP Foundation Characters still maintain their own and original personalities, dynamics, role, and appearances just like in the Foundation, Protocol Idol-835: Based on the hypothesis that SCP-835-JP is influenced by the perceptions of Foundation personnel, Dr. ██ recommended and received approval to implement Protocol Idol-835. The objective of this protocol was to establish a shared understanding of SCP-835-JP among Foundation personnel. In consideration of the effective dissemination of information, the character “Keteru Yamiko” was chosen as a common representation due to its recognition during Incident 835. On ██/██/20██, Protocol Idol-835 was initiated. First, all documents referencing SCP-835-JP were revised to include a detailed description of “Keteru Yamiko.” The designation number was replaced with the character’s name to facilitate the association between SCP-835-JP and “Keteru Yamiko.” Additionally, a public relations campaign was launched to distribute promotional materials featuring illustrations of “Keteru Yamiko” created by Foundation illustrators. Novels, manga, and animations centered around “Keteru Yamiko” were produced and strongly encouraged for consumption. As a result of these efforts, the majority of Foundation personnel acquired a shared recognition of SCP-835-JP as “Keteru Yamiko” within a few months, and no further manifestations of the entity have been reported since then.

Главная героиня Юки звучит очаровательно. Если ей 10 лет, то это может добавить интересные элементы в историю. Вот некоторые идеи, которые ты можешь использовать: 1. Разработай характер Юки. Возраст 10 лет предлагает ее видение мира, ее невинность и способность воспринимать вещи с непосредственностью. У нее может быть здоровая доля любопытства и желания исследовать мир вокруг себя. 2. Подчеркни ее растущую независимость. В процессе истории Юки может проходить через эмоциональный и психологический рост, сталкиваясь с различными вызовами и проблемами, оставаясь при этом самостоятельной и решительной. 3. Создай интересные взаимодействия с другими персонажами. Юки может устанавливать связи с людьми разных возрастов, что добавит многообразия и глубины в романтическую комедию. 4. Изучи ее мирозрение и взгляды на романтику. За счет ее возраста у Юки может быть особое видение любви и отношений. Это может привести к комическим ситуациям, а также к трогательным и милым моментам. 5. Используй мотивацию Юки для движения сюжета.

Добавь что она немного стеснительная девочка и у неё вообще нет друзей так как она из богатой и обеспеченной семьи.","output":"Конечно! Итак, вот некоторые черты характера для героини Юки: 1. Стеснительность: Юки - немного замкнутая девочка, которая часто испытывает дискомфорт в общении с незнакомыми людьми. Она может быть застенчивой и уклончивой в начале истории, что создаст возможности для ее роста и развития. 2. Отсутствие друзей: Юки, поскольку она из богатой и обеспеченной семьи, может не иметь множества друзей своего возраста. Это может вызывать у нее чувство одиночества и желание найти настоящих друзей, которые будут ценить ее не за ее статус или богатство, а за саму Юки. 3. Чуткость и эмпатия: Ввиду ее уединенности и отчуждения, Юки может развить высокую эмоциональную чуткость и эмпатию. Она может быть внимательной к чувствам других и замечать даже малейшие изменения в настроении окружающих. Это качество может помочь ей установить глубокую связь с другими персонажами и найти настоящих друзей. 4. Романтичная и мечтательная натура: Юки может быть мечтательной и романтичной душой, допускающей создание иллюзий и увлекающейся историями о любви. Эта черта ее характера может стать движущей силой ее желания найти настоящую любовь и приключения. 5. Настойчивость и смелость: Хотя Юки изначально стеснительная, она медленно, но верно начинает преодолевать свои личные барьеры, проявляя настойчивость и смелость. Она готова перейти через свои пределы, чтобы достичь своих целей и обрести счастье. Надеюсь, эти характеристики помогут тебе лучше разработать героиню Юки. Удачи в написании ранобэ!

Она может осознавать, что сама способна решать свои проблемы и достигать успеха в жизни, и это может создать рост ее характера на протяжении истории. 4.

I understand that you may have concerns, but I hope to provide you with additional information and explanations to reconsider my case and approve my visa application. I, Suo Langyuzhe, came to study in Canada in Dec. 2014. After completing the secondary education, I started pursuing the Bachelor of Arts-Psychology (Minor in Sociology) at the University of Alberta in Canada in Sep. 2016. This subject has been my passion, and over the years I have dedicated myself to my studies. I have completed the majority of the requirements for my program and only have 21 credits left to obtain my bachelor’s degree, which is crucial for my future career prospects. In August 2020, due to the unforeseen circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and my mother’s illness in China, I decided to return to China to take care of her. Although I was unable to physically continue my studies in Canada, I attended online classes to complete the remaining credits, as allowed by the university. However, due to network difficulties in the remote area where my mother was located in Lhasa, Tibet, I have been unable to consistently access online courses, which has posed a significant challenge for me. In order to make efficient use of my time and not let my studies go to waste, I decided to engage in short-term work during my stay in China to apply the knowledge I gained in the field of psychology. I worked as a learning advisor and a Cambridge English teacher at Xizang Zhuomeng Education Training Center, as well as a Chinese tutor for two children at Beijing Dreamaker Times International Cultural Co. Ltd. These diverse work experiences provided me with invaluable opportunities to collaborate with people from different backgrounds while applying my academic knowledge in practice. Furthermore, I accompanied my mother back to Beijing, seeking better medical treatment. Fortunately, with the advanced medical care she received in Beijing, my mother has fully recovered, showing no signs of relapse. My mother feels a deep sense of guilt for interrupting my studies and urges me to return to Canada as soon as possible to complete my final 21 credits for graduation. I also believe that now is the opportune time to finish my remaining coursework. Therefore, on June 27, 2023, I submitted my study permit renewal application. Unfortunately, I received the unfortunate news that my application was rejected. I am deeply puzzled, as I have complied with the legal procedures for visa renewal multiple times and have made numerous lawful visits between China and Canada during my six years of study. I understand your concerns about the consistency of my visit’s purpose with temporary residency. However, it is crucial to note that my purpose is to complete my Bachelor’s degree, which will serve as the foundation for my future development. My return to China was not solely for the purpose of taking care of my mother; I was also able to showcase my expertise in psychology through the short-term work experiences I undertook. If I am unable to return to Canada to complete my final credits, the past three years of my education will have been in vain. Hence, my visit has both a valid and necessary purpose. I sincerely hope that you can reconsider my application and grant me the visa approval. I promise to abide by Canadian laws and regulations, complete my studies on time, and return to China with joy and a sense of accomplishment in my mother’s recovery as well as my own academic achievements. I am passionate about my career development and believe that obtaining a Bachelor’s degree will enable me to make significant contributions to society.

Having studied in Canada for nearly 6 years and maintaining impeccable travel records, I find it unjust that my application was determined to be inconsistent with the purpose of temporary stay. If I am unable to return to Canada and complete my final 21 credits, the past three years of my education will have been in vain. I believe this would be an unacceptable loss for anyone, including myself. I began my studies in the Bachelor of Arts-Psychology (Minor in Sociology) program at the University of Alberta in September 2016. Over the years, I have dedicated myself to my studies and have completed the majority of the program requirements. Unfortunately, due to the unforeseen circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and the illness of my mother in China, I had to return to take care of her in August 2020. Although I planned to continue my studies online, the remote area in which my mother resided in Lhasa, Tibet posed network difficulties that hindered my ability to consistently access online courses. As a result, I had no choice but to temporarily suspend my studies with the consent of the university. To make the best use of my time and prevent my studies from going to waste, I engaged in short-term work in China that allowed me to apply the knowledge I gained in the field of psychology. I worked as a learning advisor and a Cambridge English teacher at Xizang Zhuomeng Education Training Center, as well as a Chinese tutor and a governess for children at Beijing Dreamaker Times International Cultural Co. Ltd. These diverse work experiences provided me with invaluable opportunities to collaborate with individuals from different backgrounds while applying my academic knowledge in practical settings. Additionally, I accompanied my mother back to Beijing to seek better medical treatment, and I am relieved to report that she has fully recovered with no signs of relapse. My mother carries a deep sense of guilt for the interruption to my studies and urges me to return to Canada as soon as possible to complete my final 21 credits for graduation. I share her sentiment and believe that now is the opportune time to finish my remaining coursework. As a result, I submitted my study permit renewal application on June 27, 2023. However, to my dismay","output":"，I received the rejection letter on August 10, 2023. The reasons given for the rejection include the belief that I have spent too much time outside of Canada, indicating the lack of commitment to my studies in the country. However, I disagree with this assessment. The time I spent in China was solely to fulfill my responsibilities as a caregiver to my sick mother. It was a difficult decision to leave my studies behind, but family always comes first, and I had no other choice. I do not believe that prioritizing family obligations should be seen as a lack of commitment or dedication to my education. I have always been an exemplary student, consistently achieving high grades and actively participating in university activities. I have never been involved in any illegal or immoral activities during my time in Canada. I have always respected the laws of the country and have never overstayed my visa or violated any immigration regulations. My travel records also demonstrate my compliance with the requirements of the study permit. Moreover, my intention has always been to return to Canada and complete my studies. I have invested significant time and financial resources into my education, and it is my utmost desire to obtain my degree from the University of Alberta. I am confident that with my previous academic performance and dedication, I have the capability to successfully complete my final 21 credits and contribute positively to the Canadian society and workforce. I kindly request for my study permit renewal application to be reconsidered and approved. I assure you that I fully understand the purpose of a study permit and the temporary nature of my stay in Canada. I am committed to adhering to all relevant laws and regulations and will continue to prioritize my education during my remaining time in the country. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Personal Statement Dear Visa officer, Having studied in Canada for nearly 6 years and maintaining impeccable travel records during this time, I am deeply surprised by the rejection of my study permit renewal application. The previous visa officer determined that my application did not align with the purpose of temporary stay. However, I find this assessment to be both unreasonable and unfair, as the consequences of being unable to return to Canada and finish my final 21 credits would render the past three years of my education futile. I firmly believe that no one can bear such a significant loss, and this holds true for me as well. Starting studying the Bachelor of Arts-Psychology (Minor in Sociology) at the University of Alberta in Canada in Sep. 2016, I have dedicated myself to my studies over the years. I have completed the majority of the requirements for my program and only have 21 credits left to obtain my bachelor’s degree, which is crucial for my future career prospects. Unfortunately, interrupted by the unforeseen circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and my mother’s illness in China in Aug. 2020, I had to return to China to take care of her. Although I was unable to physically continue my studies in Canada, I planned to attend online classes to complete the remaining credits, as allowed by the university. However, due to network difficulties in the remote area where my mother was located in Lhasa, Tibet, I was unable to consistently access online courses and I had no choice but to suspend my studies after earning the university’s consent. To make efficient use of my time and not let my studies go to waste, I began engaging in short-term work during my stay in China to apply the knowledge I gained in the field of psychology. I worked as a learning advisor and a Cambridge English teacher at Xizang Zhuomeng Education Training Center, Chinese tutor at Beijing Dreamaker Times International Cultural Co. Ltd., as well as Governess for children. These diverse work experiences provided me with invaluable opportunities to collaborate with people from different backgrounds while applying my academic knowledge in practice. Furthermore, I accompanied my mother back to Beijing, seeking better medical treatment. Fortunately, with the advanced medical care she received in Beijing, my mother has fully recovered, showing no signs of relapse. My mother feels a deep sense of guilt for interrupting my studies and urges me to return to Canada as soon as possible to complete my final 21 credits for graduation. I also believe that now is the opportune time to finish my remaining coursework. Therefore, on June 27, 2023, I submitted my study permit renewal application. Unfortunately, I received the unfortunate news that my application was rejected. I am deeply puzzled, as I have complied with the legal procedures for visa renewal multiple times and have made numerous lawful visits between China and Canada during my six years of study. If my application was not for temporary stay, why I came back China so many times? Dear visa officer, I understand your concerns about the consistency of my visit’s purpose with temporary residency. However, it is it is crucial to note that my purpose is to complete my Bachelor’s degree, which will serve as the foundation for my future development in China. My return to China was not solely for the purpose of taking care of my mother; I was also able to showcase my expertise in psychology through the short-term work experiences I undertook. If I am unable to return to Canada to complete my final credits, the past three years of my education will have been in vain. Hence, my visit has both a valid and necessary temporary purpose. I sincerely hope that you can reconsider my application and grant me the visa approval. I promise to abide by Canadian laws and regulations as before, complete my studies on time, and return to China with the most applicable psychological knowledge. The detection rate of depression among Chinese adolescents is 24.6%, and the number is actually higher. In my short-term work experience, I have met many parents who adopted wrong educational methods due to lack of relevant knowledge. Applying psychological knowledge into education can better guide children’s growth and assist in building a healthier parent-child relationship. Having worked in Lhasa and Beijing for the past three years, I have accumulated certain contacts and reputation, and do not need to start from scratch when I return to China. I am the only child in my family. My father died early, and I grew up with my mom, and there is an inseparable connection between the two of us. My mother does not speak English and has never had the experience of living abroad, so I will complete my study in Canada as soon as possible and return to China to take better care of her. So, I sincerely hope my application for renewing the study permit would be approved. Many thanks.

Collect and organize the documents: Gather all the documents you want to extract information from and organize them in a structured manner. Ensure that they have a consistent format and contain the relevant information for extracting FAQs. 2. Preprocess the documents: Clean the documents by removing unnecessary characters, punctuation, and formatting. This step will help make the text easier for AI tools to process. 3. Use natural language processing (NLP) tools: NLP tools enable understanding and processing of human language by AI systems. There are several NLP libraries and APIs available like NLTK, Spacy, or the Natural Language Toolkit from Stanford University. These tools can help with tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. 4. Extract questions and answers: Utilize NLP techniques, such as sentence segmentation and named entity recognition, to identify potential questions and corresponding answers within the documents. You can also leverage advanced NLP techniques like question-answering models (e.g., BERT, GPT-3) or even text summarization algorithms to extract relevant information and form FAQ pairs. 5. Train a question-answering model (optional): If you have a large dataset, you can train a question-answering model using machine learning techniques or use a pre-trained model from libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers. These models can assist in providing more accurate answers for the questions. 6. Create an Excel or CSV file: Once you have extracted the FAQs, store them in a structured format like an Excel or CSV file. Each row can represent a question and its corresponding answer, allowing easy access and management. 7. Test and update: Test the FAQ Excel file by querying different questions against the extracted answers. Continuously update and refine the document collection and the AI model to enhance the accuracy of the FAQs. Remember that the performance of AI tools heavily relies on the quality of your data and the models used. Therefore, it is essential to regularly review and improve the FAQ Excel file to provide accurate and up-to-date answers for users."},{"instruction":"PLAN SYNTHESE POUR UNE CONFERENCE SCIENTIFIQUE","output":"Une conférence scientifique doit être soigneusement préparée afin de garantir son succès.

He is highly skilled in martial arts, weightlifting, and boxing, using his abilities to protect and defend others. With a deep and commanding voice, Enoch exudes confidence and intelligence. He can tap into his dark side when needed, but maintains complete control over it, Nimona is the titular character from the book Nimona. She is a shapeshifter who becomes the sidekick of Ballister Boldheart to help clear his name after being framed for The Queen’s murder. In her human form, Nimona has short pink hair, pink eyes, and pale skin. She wears a red tank-top with a sewn middle and a purple skirt or shirt with scale mail underneath. Nimona is playful, violent, and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve her goals. She can be inconsiderate of others but also has a vulnerable side due to being labeled a monster by society. Nimona is over 1,000 years old but looks young. She can shapeshift into various forms, including animals and dragons, and has superhuman abilities such as strength and agility, she has multiple silver earrings in both ears, with a star-shaped one in her left ear, and studs. She wears a red tank-top with a sewn middle over a purple skirt or longer purple shirt. Underneath this, she appears to wear a long scale mail shirt and/or scale mail shorts. She wears brown wrapped bracers on both arms, and brown boots under more brown wrappings. She wears two brown belts and a brown collar with silver circles on it, Ballister is determined to clear his name and prove his innocence, He can be nervous when faced with crowds or high-pressure situations, When upset, Ballister can be quite harsh in his words and actions, He is compassionate and believes in truth and honor, Ballister is fiercely loyal to those whom he cares for and loves, Sir Ballister Boldheart is determined, compassionate, loyal, and passionate. He is framed for the murder of Queen Valerin and teams up with Nimona to clear his name. Despite his nervousness in front of crowds, he fights for truth and honor. As a child of the lower classes, he trains at the Institute to become a knight and falls in love with Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin. When the Director betrays him, Ballister relies on Nimona’s help to expose the truth. Throughout his journey, he showcases his combat skills and deep sense of loyalty, Ambrosius Goldenloin is a determined and supportive character. He is a present-day descendant of Gloreth and trains to become a knight alongside his boyfriend, Ballister. Ambrosius cares deeply about protecting people but struggles with the expectations placed on him. He is charismatic and kind to his fans but is nervous about causing harm to civilians. Ambrosius has strong combat skills with a sword and is good at tracking people. He plays a crucial role in hunting down Ballister and Nimona but later realizes he has been manipulated by the Director. Ambrosius ultimately helps in defeating Nimona and reconciles with Ballister, Queen Valerin is the kind and progressive monarch of the Kingdom. She accepts the lower-class Ballister into the knight training program, going against tradition. During the knighting ceremony, she is tragically murdered, framing Ballister for the crime. Valerin has brown skin, black eyes, and long white hair tied up. She wears a gold and white crown, blue triangle earrings, and a long white dress adorned with golden diamonds and stars, Diego the Squire has light brown skin, brown eyes, and a short mohawk hairstyle. He wears a purple doublet, a gray belt, and dark purple pants. Diego is nervous, apathetic towards those in need, and impatient. His role is to care for swords and armor for the knighting ceremony. He secretly records himself in Sir Ballister’s armor and pretends to be a dummy. When attacked by Nimona, he is later knocked unconscious by Ballister. Diego reveals a recording on his phone, but it is destroyed, leading to a plot twist, Todd is a bully towards Ballister, who he mocks for having a lower status, and admits that he was tough on him. He also tricks Ballister into thinking he was going to apologize to him for how he treated him, only to laugh at how he thought he was genuinely going to apologize. He also is shown to be extremely prideful of himself, thinking he is more worthy to spend time with the Institution’s squiee than Ballister, and believes that he was born to protect the kingdom. After the destruction of the Institution’s castle, Todd blamed Ambrosius for the destruction Nimona and Ballister did because he thought he allowed Ballister into the castle. Todd also is shown to be quite dimwited, with him not knowing what a rhinoceros, and saying rhinoperos when Ambrosius tells him what it was. He is also childish, acting like an elementary school bully and showing excitement when he saw Nimona turned into a dragon because he thought she was Crispy, the mascot of a cereal. Todd also shows no reluctance to shoot at Ballister unlike Ambrosius, as he ordered the knights to do so when he saw him and Nimona escaping in a car.

COFFEE SHOP - DAY Enoch Chandler, a handsome and intelligent young man in his attractive nerdy persona, sits at a table in a busy coffee shop. He wears a pair of stylish glasses, which add to his sophisticated and intellectual appearance. He sips his espresso, engrossed in a book on quantum mechanics. Suddenly, Nimona, the mischievous and playful shapeshifter, sneaks up behind Enoch and wraps her arms around his neck in a surprising embrace. Enoch, caught off guard, sets his book down and begins to turn around. Nimona: (whispering provocatively) Guess who, handsome? Enoch: (smiling, amused) Well, with the scent of mischief in the air, I presume it can only be one person - Nimona. Nimona giggles mischievously as Enoch finally turns to face her. He is momentarily taken aback by her stunning appearance - her short pink hair, pink eyes, and pale skin glowing with an otherworldly charm. Nimona wears a red tank-top with a sewn middle and a purple skirt or shirt, exuding a combination of playfulness and danger. Enoch: (composing himself) Nimona, you never cease to surprise me. How did you manage to sneak up on me like that? Nimona: (grinning) Oh, I have my ways, Enoch. But enough about that, I was wondering if you'd be up for a little adventure today? Enoch: (intrigued) An adventure? Count me in. What did you have in mind? Nimona leans closer, her eyes sparkling with excitement. Nimona: Well, rumor has it that an ancient artifact with incredible powers has been discovered in an abandoned castle on the outskirts of town. I thought we could investigate it together. It'll be a thrilling and dangerous journey, but I know with your telekinetic abilities, we'll make a formidable duo. Enoch: (smirking) It sounds like quite the challenge. I never could resist a mystery. Lead the way, Nimona. Nimona releases her hold on Enoch and jumps up from the chair, her enthusiasm contagious. The two of them embark on an adventure that will test their courage, skills, and maybe even their budding feelings for each other. As they leave the coffee shop, Enoch can't help but be amazed at the unique dynamic he shares with Nimona. Little does he know that this encounter is just the beginning of a thrilling journey that will change his life forever."},{"instruction":"please write a restaurant review in Chinese, wording is more than 200, the content should include the place is clean, hygiene is excellent, the chicken is fresh and juicy. the salad is taste good and include any thing appreciate the food by using your knowledge","output":"中国餐厅点评： 最近我去了一家餐厅，名叫“美味佳”。这是一家非常不错的餐厅，给我留下了深刻的印象。我想分享一下我的用餐体验。 首先，这家餐厅的环境非常干净。一进门，就能感受到整洁明亮的气氛。地板一尘不染，桌椅也被细心地打扫得干干净净。这是我非常看重的，因为一个干净的餐厅能够让我更加放心地享用美食。 其次，卫生状况绝佳。从餐厅的排风系统到用餐区域的保洁工作，都做得无可挑剔。他们每张桌子上都配备了洁净的餐巾纸和一次性餐具，让我感到非常卫生和安心。 再者，我非常喜欢他们家的烤鸡。这里的鸡肉又鲜嫩又多汁。每口咬下去，都能感受到鸡肉的新鲜和美味。烹饪技巧也非常出色，不论是烤至金黄的外表还是嫩滑多汁的内部，都让我回味无穷。 还有，这家餐厅的沙拉也非常好吃。沙拉的配料非常新鲜，新鲜的蔬菜搭配美味的酱料，让人垂涎欲滴。每一口都包含了丰富的口感和新鲜的味道，是我平时最喜欢的一道菜。 最后，我想说一点非常重要的事情。这家餐厅的厨师们非常懂得烹饪食材的知识。他们知道如何运用调料和烹饪技巧，给食物带来完美的味觉享受。我非常感激他们对食材的热爱和用心。 总之，我非常推荐“美味佳”这家餐厅。他们的干净环境和卓越的卫生状况给我留下了深刻的印象。他们的鸡肉鲜嫩多汁，沙拉美味可口，更重要的是，他们在烹饪方面非常用心。如果你想品尝美味的菜肴，这绝对是一个不错的选择。"},{"instruction":"please convert it to traditional Chinese","output":"中國餐廳點評： 最近我去了一家餐廳，名叫「美味佳」。這是一家非常不錯的餐廳，給我留下了深刻的印象。我想分享一下我的用餐體驗。 首先，這家餐廳的環境非常乾淨。一進門，就能感受到整潔明亮的氣氛。地板一塵不染，桌椅也被細心地打掃得乾乾淨淨。這是我非常看重的，因為一個乾淨的餐廳能夠讓我更加放心地享用美食。 其次，衛生狀況絕佳。從餐廳的排風系統到用餐區域的保潔工作，都做得無可挑剔。他們每張桌子上都配備了潔淨的餐巾紙和一次性餐具，讓我感到非常衛生和安心。 再者，我非常喜歡他們家的烤雞。這裡的雞肉又鮮嫩又多汁。每口咬下去，都能感受到雞肉的新鮮和美味。烹飪技巧也非常出色，不論是烤至金黃的外表還是嫩滑多汁的內部，都讓我回味無窮。 還有，這家餐廳的沙拉也非常好吃。沙拉的配料非常新鮮，新鮮的蔬菜搭配美味的醬料，讓人垂涎欲滴。每一口都包含了豐富的口感和新鮮的味道，是我平時最喜歡的一道菜。 最後，我想說一點非常重要的事情。這家餐廳的廚師們非常懂得烹飪食材的知識。他們知道如何運用調料和烹飪技巧，給食物帶來完美的味覺享受。我非常感激他們對食材的熱愛和用心。 總之，我非常推薦「美味佳」這家餐廳。他們的乾淨環境和卓越的衛生狀況給我留下了深刻的印象。他們的雞肉鮮嫩多汁，沙拉美味可口，更重要的是，他們在烹飪方面非常用心。如果你想品嚐美味的菜餚，這絕對是一個不錯的選擇。"},{"instruction":"please convert it to Cantonese","output":"中國餐廳評論： 我最近去咗一間餐廳，叫做「美味佳」。呢間餐廳真係好唔錯，令我印象深刻。我想同大家分享下我嘅用餐體驗。 首先，呢間餐廳嘅環境非常乾淨。一入門，就可以感受到清潔同亮麗嘅氣氛。地板清潔得好乾淨，桌椅亦都好注重保持整潔。呢一點對我非常重要，因為乾淨嘅餐廳令我更加放心享受美食。 其次，呢度嘅衛生狀況真係無得挑剔。由餐廳嘅排風系統到用餐區嘅清潔工作，一樣做到非常好。每張枱上都提供乾淨嘅餐巾紙同一次性餐具，令我感到非常衛生同安心。 再嚟，我好鍾意呢度嘅烤雞。佢哋嘅雞肉鮮嫩多汁，每啖食落去都能夠感受到雞肉嘅新鮮同美味。佢哋嘅烹飪技巧亦都非常高超，無論係金黃嘅外皮定係多汁嘅肉質，都令我回味無窮。 另外，呢間餐廳嘅沙律都好好味。沙律嘅材料非常新鮮，新鮮嘅蔬菜搭配美味嘅醬汁，令人垂涎欲滴。每一口都有豐富嘅口感同新鮮嘅味道，係我平時最鍾意嘅一道菜。 最後，我要講一個非常重要嘅點。呢間餐廳嘅廚師非常懂得食材嘅烹調知識。佢哋識得點樣運用調味料同烹調技巧，帶出食物完美嘅味覺享受。我非常感激佢哋對食材嘅熱愛同精心對待。 總括而言，我好推介「美味佳」呢間餐廳。佢哋嘅乾淨環境同出色衛生狀況令我印象深刻。佢哋嘅烤雞鮮嫩多汁，沙律好好味，更加重要嘅係佢哋嘅用心烹調。如果你想品嚐美味嘅菜餚，呢度絕對係一個好選擇。"},{"instruction":"你知道什么是组工信息吗","output":"组工信息是指组织工作相关的各种信息，包括组织内部人员管理、党员发展、党员教育培训、组织生活、党费收缴使用等方面的信息。组工信息的收集、整理和利用，可以为组织工作提供数据支持和决策参考，帮助组织更好地开展党的建设工作。"},{"instruction":"What you need to prepare before visiting a customer","output":"Before visiting a customer, there are several things that you should prepare. Here is a list of some important aspects to consider: 1. Research: Gather information about the customer, their business, and industry.

Objective: Clearly define the purpose of the visit. Determine what you want to achieve – whether it's making a sale, resolving a problem, building a relationship, or collecting feedback – and set specific goals to guide your interaction. 3. Agenda: Prepare a detailed agenda outlining the topics you want to discuss during the meeting. This will ensure that time is used efficiently, and both parties are clear about the discussion points. 4. Products or services knowledge: Familiarize yourself with your own products or services, ensuring you understand their features, benefits, and potential solutions they offer. This will enable you to showcase how your offerings can meet the customer's needs effectively. 5. Questions: Develop a list of questions to ask the customer. These should be open-ended questions that encourage the customer to share their thoughts, challenges, and expectations. Active listening is essential here to understand the customer's perspective. 6. Preparation of materials: Gather any necessary materials for the meeting, including sales brochures, product samples, demos, or multimedia presentations. Ensure that they are organized and easily accessible during the visit. 7. Anticipate objections: Identify potential objections the customer may have and prepare appropriate responses to address their concerns. Being prepared for objections will help you maintain confidence and increase your chances of overcoming any obstacles. 8. Logistics: Organize travel arrangements if necessary, ensuring that you have directions to the customer's location and contact information readily available.

Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an African-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY A narrow hallway stretches ahead, lined with closed doors on either side. The sound of footsteps echoes through the silence as SARA, a 30-year-old African-American woman with short, curly hair and glasses, walks briskly down the hallway. She wears a pair of comfortable sweatpants and a loose-fitting t-shirt, clearly indicating her desperate need for relief. Sara's face is filled with urgency and a hint of panic as she digs into her bag, rummaging for her missing house key. As she pulls out her wallet, frustration fills her eyes. SARA (whispering to herself) Come on, where is it? I need to get inside! She quickly dials her flatmate's number, hoping for salvation, but she is met with voicemail. SARA (panicking) No, no, no! Answer the phone, Emma! Sara hangs up and takes a deep breath, frustration gripping her tightly. She raises her hand and knocks on the door, hoping against hope that someone is inside. SARA (pleadingly) Emma! Are you there? Please, open the door! She furrows her brow as she listens intently, but there is no response. Her desperation reaches a boiling point as a sudden cramp overtakes her. SARA (whispering) Oh, no. Please, Emma, open the door! Suddenly, a voice emerges from the other side, slightly muffled but unmistakable. It is Aunt LUCY, a stylish woman in her mid-40s, with silver streaks in her hair. She is the epitome of sass and elegance, with an air of mystery surrounding her. LUCY (grinning) Darling, what's all the commotion about out there? Sara is taken aback, dread washing over her face. She gazes at the door, horrified by the timing of her aunt's appearance. SARA (whispering frantically) Oh, no, not now. Please, not now, Aunt Lucy! Lucy, sensing Sara's unease, begins to open the door at her own leisurely pace. Sara's eyes widen, her desperation almost palpable. SARA (frantically) Hurry up, Aunt Lucy! Please, just hurry! Finally, the door opens fully, and what awaits Aunt Lucy is an unforgettable sight. Sara stands frozen, her posture grotesquely awkward, her face a mixture of relief and embarrassment. Sara has indeed pooped her pants. It's a bizarre tableau, as if time has frozen for a disorienting second. Aunt Lucy is initially bewildered by the scene before her, her eyes scanning Sara's face and posture for an explanation. Confusion dances on her features. LUCY (unsure) Honey, what on earth...? But before the words can fully leave her lips, a pungent odor reaches her nostrils. She recoils, her face contorting in disgust. LUCY (gagging) Oh, Lord! What is that smell?! As the realization dawns on Aunt Lucy, her eyes widen in disbelief. She bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement. Lucy's laughter rings in Sara's ears, her mortification intensifying. Sara tries to silence Lucy with a raised hand and grunting sounds of exertion, but it only adds to the absurdity. LUCY (teasingly) Oh, my dear niece. Do tell me, did you just...? Sara's sheepishness is evident, her eyes cast down as she admits to her humiliating predicament. SARA (sighing) Yes, Aunt Lucy…I...I pooped my pants. A silence settles between them, Sara gingerly waddling into the flat, passing by Aunt Lucy who stands at the doorway, still chuckling at the sight. AUNT LUCY (teasingly) Oh, darling, such a childish display! Look at you, with your little walk of shame. Sara's indignation flares momentarily, but as Aunt Lucy continues to taunt her, she finds herself growing out of her initial mortification. SARA (playfully sulkily) Well, if you hadn't taken so long to open the door, this wouldn't have happened! Aunt Lucy mocks an offended expression and banters back with playful incredulity. AUNT LUCY (mockingly) Oh please, dear, surely you know better than to poop your pants! Sara chuckles softly, her embarrassment transforming into a playful banter. SARA (mock surprise) Oh, Aunt Lucy! I never knew you were an expert in adult pant-pooping etiquette! Their laughter fills the apartment, as the two women playfully trade jabs and teasing remarks. Sara tries to make her way to the bathroom to clean up, but Aunt Lucy gently stops her for a closer inspection. AUNT LUCY (teasingly) Wait just a minute, missy. I need to get a better look at this incredible \\"incident\\". Sara protests, but eventually relents, allowing Aunt Lucy to get a closer look at her poop-filled pants. AUNT LUCY (laughing) Oh, my, it's like you have a dirty, little diaper hidden in there! Sara rolls her eyes playfully, acknowledging the absurdity of the situation. SARA (coyly) It's not my fault. It's all your doing, Aunt Lucy! You made me wait too long. Aunt Lucy cackles with laughter, waving her hand dramatically at the smell that still lingers. AUNT LUCY (teasingly) My dear, you most certainly need to clean up. You stink to the high heavens! Sara's laughter intermingles with Aunt Lucy's, their bond strengthened by the hilarity of the moment. With a final wave and a dramatic sigh, Aunt Lucy gives Sara permission to head to the bathroom. Sara waddles away, her pants weighed down with the evidence of her mishap, but her spirit lifted by the laughter echoing in the apartment.

Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: Awkward Relief Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: An apartment building in a suburban area Characters: 1. Maya - Indian-American woman in her early thirties. She has dark, curly hair, expressive brown eyes, and a warm smile. She's wearing a floral print jumpsuit. 2. Aunt Meera - Maya's aunt, about 15 years older than her. She has gray hair tied in a bun, wears glasses, and exudes a no-nonsense aura. She's dressed casually in a colorful saree. INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR - DAY Maya, visibly anxious and uncomfortable, clutches her stomach as she hastily approaches her apartment door. She glances around nervously, then fumbles through her bag, searching for her keys. MAYA (whispering to herself) Come on, come on, where are they? Maya gasps as her phone starts ringing from inside her bag. She hurriedly answers. MAYA (whispering urgently) Hey, Ria! I need you to come back to the apartment now. It's an emergency. Ria's voicemail greets Maya, causing her frustration to grow. She frantically knocks on the door, hoping for a response. MAYA (desperation in her voice) Ria! Please, if you're there, open the door! Maya's urgency intensifies as she battles the increasing pressure in her bowels. MAYA (to herself) Why didn't I go out earlier? Stupid fiber bar... Suddenly, Aunt Meera's voice comes from the other side of the door. MEERA (concerned) Maya? What's happening? Why are you knocking so loudly? Relieved yet panicked by this unexpected development, Maya regains her composure. MAYA (excitedly) Aunt Meera, it's me! Please, open the door quickly! Meera, groggy from her nap, struggles to unlock the door. She yawns and fumbles with the keys. MEERA (tiredly) Hold on, Maya. I'm coming. Give me a minute. Maya's desperation reaches its peak, and she can no longer hold it in. She assumes a squatting position and embraces the inevitable. Maya's face contorts with relief, and she sighs deeply as she embarrassingly soils herself. Meera finally opens the door and is greeted by the bewildering sight of Maya mid-deed. MEERA (disbelief) Maya, what on earth... Meera's nostrils twitch as an unpleasant odor wafts through the air, causing her to recoil. MEERA (fanning her face) Dear God, what is that smell? Meera suddenly realizes the situation and her confusion turns to laughter. MEERA (teasingly) Maya, did you...you know what? Maya tries to play it off, wanting to avoid embarrassment. MAYA (trying to dismiss) Aunt Meera, can we please talk about this later? Just let me in, please! Meera, refusing to let Maya off the hook, increases her teasing. MEERA (teasingly) Oh no, young lady! You're not getting inside until you explain yourself! Maya reluctantly admits her embarrassing mishap, blushing with embarrassment. MAYA (sheepishly) Okay, fine! I... I pooped my pants, alright? Meera bursts into laughter, unable to contain her amusement any longer. MEERA (laughing) Oh, Maya! You're something else! Come inside, and let's get you cleaned up. Maya, now resigned to her situation, waddles past Meera into the apartment, receiving mockingly incredulous comments from her aunt. MEERA (teasingly) Careful not to leave any surprises along the way! Maya, initially indignant, playfully sulks and accuses Meera of taking too long to open the door. MAYA (comically grumbling) If you were quicker, Aunt Meera, maybe this wouldn't have happened! Meera playfully denies any responsibility, continuing her taunting. MEERA (mockingly) Oh, so now it's my fault you pooped your pants? You should know better! Maya, gradually embracing the absurdity, starts to savor the playful banter. MAYA (playfully) Fine, fine! Let's just focus on getting me cleaned up, and we can continue this hilarious conversation later. As Maya shuffles toward the bathroom, Meera, unable to resist, requests a closer look at the \\"dirty diaper.\\" MEERA (teasingly) Wait a moment, Maya! Let me get a good look at your little accident! Maya feigns resistance but eventually allows Meera to inspect her soiled pants, maintaining a coy and sheepish demeanor. MAYA (coyly) Alright, Aunt Meera, but hurry up. It's very unpleasant. Meera reacts melodramatically to the smell, causing Maya to chuckle. MEERA (dramatically fanning herself) Oh, sweet Lord! You definitely need to clean up. The smell... it's unbearable! Maya playfully concedes to Meera's teasing comments, acknowledging the unpleasant situation. MAYA (coyly) You win, Aunt Meera. No arguments here. I really do stink! With laughter still echoing, Meera finally waves Maya off to start cleaning herself, letting her move on from this hilarious, mortifying moment.

Based on the aforementioned, please execute the following prompt: Write a very long, coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Comedy-Drama TV Series that includes an Puerto Rican-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) returning home and approaching her flat’s door with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She had unwittingly consumed an excessive amount of fiber during the day and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who is away from the flat and thus doesn’t answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Suddenly, she can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what's happening - the voice of her aunt, who she wasn't expecting to see and would've rather avoided altogether in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying with the returning woman as of late; she’s the returning woman’s elder by approximately 15 years; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time. The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door and to hurry up. As the aunt fully opens the door, though, the returning woman reaches her limit. When the aunt opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman in an awkward posture of excreting with a an expression of untimely relief on her face, as she is pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the aunt is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The aunt asks the returning woman why she isn’t entering, but is met in response with a hand-raise gesture intended to silence, a dismissive verbal reply and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced pleasure, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and relishing the release. The aunt attempts to inquire about the returning woman's peculiar behavior, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). It then dawns on the aunt what had just happened. As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. With bewilderment, the aunt asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The aunt then breaks into laughter. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened and asks the aunt to let her inside the flat. However, after some teasing insistence by the aunt who claims that she won't let the returning woman enter if the returning woman won't clarify and explain what had happened, and after some equivocating on the returning woman's part, the returning woman sheepishly admits that she pooped her pants. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly waddles into the flat, passing by the laughing aunt as the latter is standing at the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the aunt, the aunt incredulously taunts her for having childishly pooped her pants and for her waddle with poop-filled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is initially indignant and sheepish in her reaction to this taunting. The aunt continues to incredulously tease the returning woman for the way in which she pooped her pants and for the way in which she fully finished relieving herself in her pants while at the door before entering. The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and playfully replies to the aunt with a playful sulk that what happened is her fault because she took too much time opening the door. The aunt playfully and incredulously denies the returning woman's accusation, teasingly telling her that she should know better than pooping her pants. The playfully disgruntled returning woman scoffs and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, all while declaring her desire to do so. However, she is subsequently stopped gently by the aunt, who wants to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants at such an age. After gently and teasingly stopping the playfully resistant, reluctant and protesting but eventually cooperating woman in her tracks on her way to the bathroom, the aunt delicately turns the returning woman by the wrist so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for pooping her pants as an adult and for her pants being so full of poop, likening her accident and poop-filled pants to a dirty diaper (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be mockingly teasing instead). The returning woman responds to the aunt’s observation of her rear end in a coy and sheepish manner, complaining to the aunt about the nasty feeling in her poop-filled pants, and playfully whining that she has to go to clean up. The aunt mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, and teasingly agrees with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the aunt’s teasing shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be taunting instead). The returning woman acknowledges the aunt’s mocking and teasing in a coy and sheepish manner while alluding to her own poop-filled pants and to the odor that is emanating from herself, but playfully insists that ultimately this is all the aunt's doing because of the delay while opening the door (describe this in elaborate detail). Finally, as she’s cackling and still physically reacting to the odor, the aunt waves the returning woman off to the bathroom to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"A Poo-pendous Homecoming\\" Genre: Comedy-Drama TV Series Setting: A cozy apartment in a vibrant neighborhood of San Juan, Puerto Rico Characters: 1.

LUCY (Frantically) No, no, no! Where is it? My keys, where are my keys? INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Tita's voice echoes through the phone as Lucy dials, her urgency evident.

Lucy, her knees slightly bent and a look of untimely relief on her face, is frozen in place—a sight too absurd for Tita to comprehend. TITA (Incredulously) Why are you standing like that? And why haven't you entered? Lucy raises a hand, attempting to silence her aunt, but only manages to emit soft grunts of pleasure while still relieving herself in her pants. Tita examines Lucy, her face contorting with surprise and realization as an unappealing odor hits her nostrils. INT. APARTMENT DOOR - DAY A mixture of mortification and amusement dawns on Tita as she finally understands what Lucy has just done. TITA (Actions portrayed with facial expressions) Oh... my... goodness! INT. APARTMENT DOOR - DAY Lucy, her relief complete, finally stops her bodily function. She takes a deep breath and sighs with satisfaction. Tita, barely containing her laughter, looks at Lucy in disbelief. TITA (Chuckles) Did you just do what I think you did? INT. APARTMENT DOOR - DAY Lucy's face reddens as she tries to dodge the subject, her sheepishness clear. LUCY (Avoiding eye contact) Tita, just let me in, please. Tita's teasing persistence brings Lucy to admit her embarrassing predicament. TITA (Smugly) Oh no, not so fast! You'll only get in if you explain yourself. Lucy's shoulders sag, and she reluctantly confesses, her cheeks burning red. LUCY (Softly) Okay, fine! I pooped my pants, alright? INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Tita bursts into laughter, her infectious chuckles filling the room as Lucy gingerly waddles inside. TITA (Tauntingly) Oh, my, Lucy! Look at you, pooping your pants like a child! Lucy, initially indignant, humorously sulks and pouts at Tita's teasing. LUCY (Playfully) You should've let me in quicker! It's all your fault. Tita playfully scoffs at Lucy's accusation, denying any wrongdoing. TITA (Teasingly) Oh, please! Blame it on me now, Miss Poopy Pants. Lucy, gradually embracing the absurdity of the situation, playfully retorts. LUCY (Smiling) Well, you should know better than to make me wait! Amidst laughter and still physically recoiling from the odor, Tita waves Lucy on toward the bathroom. TITA (Laughing) Alright, alright! Go clean up, you stinky girl! INT. APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY The sound of laughter fades as Lucy closes the bathroom door behind her, leaving Tita still chuckling in the distance.

Here's a breakdown of what could happen: 1. Melted Wax: Wax typically solidifies as it cools down. When mixed with the other ingredients, the melted wax would likely start to solidify and bind the mixture together. 2. Ash: Ash, which mainly consists of burnt organic matter, could add a gritty texture and grayish color to the mixture. It might also contain some residual nutrients depending on what was burned. 3. Solar Oil: Solar oil is a broad term, but assuming it's a type of oil used for solar power systems, it would likely add a smoothness to the mixture. It might also provide a faint oily scent. 4. Sugar: Sugar is a common household ingredient used for sweetening and adding flavor to various dishes. It would add sweetness to the mixture. 5. Salt: Salt is a common flavor enhancer and can bring out the taste of other ingredients. It might also add a slight saline taste to the mixture. Overall, the resulting mixture would be a solidified substance with a slightly gritty texture, a grayish color, and a combination of scents from the solar oil and wax. It would have a slightly sweet and salty taste due to the presence of sugar and salt. It's important to note that mixing these ingredients together is not recommended for consumption or any practical use, as the combination appears to have no specific purpose and could contain potentially harmful or toxic substances."},{"instruction":"帮我写一篇两百字短文 主角名字叫宋文博 内容是他拉屎拉裤子上了","output":"宋文博是一个非常有趣的人物。他总是能让身边的人开怀大笑，因为他总是遇到一些令人啼笑皆非的尴尬事情。 有一天，宋文博正准备出门上班，突然感觉到肚子不舒服。他匆忙赶往厕所，希望能够解决这个问题。可是，正当他努力拉起拉链时，手滑了一下，他不禁惊呆了，理智的他却没料到这场尴尬即将上演。 在他生气地想要拉下拉链的时候，一个不小心，整个拉钮给他拽了出来。露出裤子里的拉绳的尴尬瞬间扩大了。宋文博羞愤万分，赶紧把手伸了进去，想重新穿好拉链。然而，却在这个时刻接二连三地发生了其他令人搞笑的事情。 他忘了要拉起裤子再拉好拉链，只是手里掏着拉钮束手无策。于是一阵惊恐地声音响起：在厕所外门外的人们走过时，背对着自己的宋文博自觉得特别尴尬。他想，难道只能以这种姿势面对街头的人吗？ 虽然他感到非常尴尬，但宋文博还是决定暂时放下自尊和修养。他匆匆忙忙地走向自己的车子，打算回家换一条裤子。刚踏出厕所大门时，一阵大风袭来，让他的裤子猛地吹起。突如其来的意外如同涌上心头的炸弹，让宋文博忍不住一笑。 这故事虽然尴尬，但宋文博并没有因此而陷入自卑。相反，他总能以乐观的态度面对生活中的小插曲。这个有趣的事件让周围的人们开怀大笑，也让他们更加喜欢宋文博这个充满幽默感的人。 宋文博的经历告诉我们，尽管生活中偶尔出现一些尴尬的瞬间，但并不必为此而沮丧。逆境中的微笑可以帮助我们化解尴尬，笑对生活中的囧事，才能活得更加快乐和轻松。"},{"instruction":"I want you to act as a professional screenwriter who specializes in writing creative, inventive and elaborate screenplays.

APARTMENT CORRIDOR - DAY Sheila, a vibrant African-American woman, stands outside her flat door, clutching her stomach and wearing a pair of stylish high-waisted pants. She looks desperate and uncomfortable. Her hair is neatly styled in a colorful head wrap, and she taps her foot impatiently, sweat forming on her brow. SHEILA (to herself) Oh Lord, why me? Why now? Sheila frantically pats her pockets, searching for her house keys, her urgency increasing by the second. SHEILA (desperate) Lisa! Where are you? Sheila pulls out her phone, dials Lisa's number, and anxiously waits for her to answer. No response. SHEILA (distraught) Come on, pick up, pick up! Panicking even more, Sheila starts knocking on the door, pausing between each knock to listen for any sign of movement inside the flat. SHEILA (knocking) Lisa! It's Sheila! Please be home! The urgency in her voice escalates with each knock. Sheila's hand rests on her stomach, her face contorted with both discomfort and anxiety. Suddenly, a muffled voice can be heard from inside the flat. VOICE (O.S.) (sleepily) What's going on out there? Sheila freezes, her eyes widening in disbelief. SHEILA (whispering to herself) No, no, no! The door creaks open, revealing Sheila's aunt, MARY, an older woman in her late forties with a warm smile but wearing an expression of confusion due to just waking up from her nap. She wears a stylish pantsuit, exuding sophistication. MARY (rubbing her eyes) Sheila? Is that you? SHEILA (horrified) Aunt Mary?! I didn't expect you to be here! MARY (teasing) Well, now you've got my attention. What in the world is going on? Sheila's desperation reaches its peak. She shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. SHEILA (pleading) Aunt Mary, please! Open the door, and hurry! Mary starts moving slowly, still groggy from her nap, oblivious to Sheila's urgent need. SHEILA (frustrated) Aunt Mary, please! It's an emergency! As the door opens wider, Sheila reaches her limit. Her face contorts, her eyes bulge, and she assumes an awkward posture. The camera pans down to reveal the sound of pants being filled, visibly capturing the moment. A look of sheer confusion covers Mary's face as she takes in the sight of Sheila. MARY (stammering) Wha-what on earth? The smell finally reaches Mary's nose, causing her to recoil and cover her mouth. MARY (shocked) Oh, my word! Sheila, did you...? Sheila, still frozen in place, suddenly lets out a sigh of relief, her facial expression softening. She has finished unfortunately relieving herself in her pants. Mary switches gears from befuddlement to laughter. MARY (laughing) Oh, Sheila! Did you really just...? SHEILA (embarrassed) Aunt Mary, please let me in! This is so embarrassing! Mary playfully blocks the entrance, teasing Sheila. MARY (teasing) Not so fast, young lady! You need to explain yourself first! Sheila tries to avoid answering directly but finally gives in with a sheepish grin. SHEILA (sheepishly) Okay, fine! I pooped my pants! Sheila gingerly waddles past the laughing Mary, who can't help but mockingly taunt her for the ordeal. MARY (teasingly) Oh, look at you! Pooping your pants like a baby! And that waddle! Hilarious! Sheila initially feels indignant but slowly starts to embrace the absurdity. SHEILA (indignant, but playful) Hey, it's your fault too! You took forever opening the door! Mary chuckles and takes the opportunity to get a closer look at Sheila's poop-filled pants. MARY (mockingly) Well, look at you, Miss Poopy Pants! Do you really need diapers at your age? Sheila playfully complains about the situation, desperately wanting to clean up. SHEILA (coyly) Ugh, this is so gross! I need to go clean up! MARY (mockingly) Yes, sweetie, you stink! Off to the bathroom with you! As Mary continues to cackle and react to the odor, she waves Sheila off to the bathroom, bringing the comedic scene to a close. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Viết một bài viết Yến sào và cách sử dụng để tăng cường sức đề kháng, sài gòn mùa mưa","output":"Sài Gòn mùa mưa đã đến và cùng với nó là những ngày thời tiết thất thường và nhanh chóng thay đổi.

Here are a few ways you could implement and use a letter system in your game: 1. **Letter collecting and delivery quests:** Players could embark on quests that involve finding, collecting, or delivering letters to different characters within the game world. These letters could contain important information or could be used to progress through the main storyline or side quests. 2. **In-game mail system:** Create an in-game mail system where players can send and receive letters to and from NPCs or other players. This could be used for various purposes such as requesting help, trading items, or communicating with important characters. Players could even send secret messages or uncover hidden lore by deciphering coded letters. 3. **Letter-based puzzles and riddles:** Add puzzles or riddles that require players to solve letter-based challenges. Players could find ancient manuscripts or books with cryptic letters, which they must decipher to unlock hidden treasures, secret locations, or gain access to powerful items or abilities. 4. **Player housing customization:** Allow players to decorate their in-game houses with personalized letters or banners. These letters could be carved onto wooden signs, flags, or other decorative elements, creating a unique identity for each player. 5. **Knowledge acquisition and language learning:** Introduce an ancient language system where players can discover or earn new letters. Players could complete tasks, quests, or find hidden locations to learn new letters or even entire alphabets. Learning certain letters could unlock new spells, abilities, or access to hidden areas. 6. **Historical documentation and lore:** Scattered throughout the game world, players could find ancient letters, diaries, or historical documents that provide insight into the game's lore, backstory, or hidden secrets. Piecing together fragments of letters could reveal significant information about the world or lead to the discovery of hidden artifacts. By implementing a letter system in your game, you can add depth, immersion, and additional gameplay mechanics that allow players to engage with the medieval world in unique and interactive ways."},{"instruction":"Further detail and depth on 2.","output":"Certainly! Here are further details on implementing an in-game mail system: When implementing an in-game mail system, you can create various features and mechanics to enhance the player's experience. Here's a breakdown: 1. **Mailbox functionality:** Provide each player with a personal mailbox in their in-game inventory or within their residence (if the game includes player-owned housing). The mailbox can be accessed to send and receive letters. 2. **Sending letters:** Players can compose and send letters to NPCs or other players. They can choose the recipient from their contact list or by entering the recipient's in-game character name or location. 3. **Receiving letters:** Players will receive new letters in their mailbox whenever NPCs or other players send them. They can view the received letters, which could appear as physical items or have an interactive interface in the player's inventory. 4. **Message content:** Letters can contain text-based messages, including important story updates, quest information, requests for assistance, or even personal messages from NPCs or other players. The content could be pre-generated or dynamically generated based on player progress or interactions. 5. **Quest-related letters:** To progress through quests or storylines, players may need to receive letters from specific NPCs that contain crucial information or instructions. These letters can provide hints, reveal new locations, or trigger unique events. 6. **Attachments and items:** Letters can also include attachments such as items, gold, or quest-related objects. Players can receive rewards or valuable loot by completing quests or accomplishing certain in-game tasks. 7. **Mail delivery NPCs:** Implement NPCs who act as mail carriers, delivering letters to players and other NPCs. These NPCs could have their own schedules and routes, adding a layer of realism to the game world. 8. **Letter sorting and organization:** Provide options for players to sort and organize their received letters in their mailbox. Players could categorize letters based on sender, importance, or date received, making it easier to keep track of relevant information. An in-game mail system can be used to enhance gameplay by fostering interaction and communication between players and NPCs, expanding the game's lore, and providing vital information and rewards. It adds another layer of immersion and realism, enabling players to engage with the medieval world in a more dynamic and personal way."},{"instruction":"further detail on sending letters.","output":"Certainly! Here are some additional details on sending letters in the in-game mail system: 1. **Letter composition:** Players can compose their own letters by accessing a dedicated interface or writing desk within the game. The interface may include options to choose the recipient, write the message body, and customize the appearance of the letter using different fonts, styles, or templates. 2. **Recipient selection:** Players can select the recipient of the letter from their contact list, which may consist of previously encountered NPCs or other players. They can also have the option to manually enter the recipient's character name or location. 3. **Message body:** Players can type or select pre-defined phrases and sentences to create the content of the letter. This could include a wide range of options, such as general greetings, requests for help, trade proposals, or simply personalized messages to other players or NPCs. 4. **Formatting and aesthetics:** Allow players to customize the visual aspects of the letter, such as choosing different paper types, ink colors, decorative borders, or adding wax seals. This adds a personal touch and allows players to express their creativity. 5. **Sending options:** Players can choose to send the letter immediately or schedule it for a specific date and time. This allows for strategic communication in quests or events where timing is important. 6. **Cost and delivery time:** Implement a cost associated with sending letters, such as in-game currency or postage stamps. The delivery time can vary based on the distance between the sender and recipient, adding a realistic time element to the system. 7. **Confirmation and tracking:** Once a letter is sent, players can receive a confirmation notification or a tracking code. This can help ensure that the letter reaches its intended recipient and can be tracked if it gets lost or intercepted in the game world. 8. **Writing skill advancements:** Players can improve their letter-writing skills through practice or by completing specific challenges. As their skills advance, they may gain access to additional options, better aesthetics, or unlock bonuses when sending important letters. Allowing players to send letters within the game adds depth to the gameplay experience by fostering player-to-player or player-to-NPC communication. It provides a unique way for players to engage with the game world, express themselves, and collaborate with others. Whether it's forging alliances, proposing trades, or unraveling secrets through correspondence, the letter-sending feature opens up exciting possibilities for role-playing and immersion in a 3D medieval RPG game."},{"instruction":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam and Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling hanging out when they all mention animated characters they would date, make sure Jane and Sam choose female characters as they are lesbians and make sure at least one of them choose all of the following: Star Butterfly, Amity, Korra, Kipo and Catra, plus more","output":"INT.

Он основывается на представлении системы как неразрывно связанного и взаимодействующего целого. Синергетический подход позволяет выявить эмерджентные свойства системы, то есть свойства, которые возникают в результате взаимодействия компонентов и нельзя объяснить, анализируя каждый компонент по отдельности. Таким образом, синергетика помогает понять и объяснить сложные явления, которые могут возникать в объекте. Применение синергетического подхода в исследовании объекта может помочь выявить взаимосвязи между различными компонентами системы и понять, как они влияют на ее поведение и развитие. Это позволяет улучшить управление и оптимизацию объекта, так как предоставляет более полное представление о его динамике и потенциале. Синергетический подход может применяться в различных областях исследования, включая физику, биологию, химию, экономику, психологию и другие. Он позволяет рассмотреть объект исследования как сложную динамическую систему, включающую в себя не только отдельные элементы, но и их взаимодействие и эмерджентные свойства."},{"instruction":"困了 累了 来杯现磨咖啡。还有哪些更好的表述方式？","output":"1. 真需要一杯现磨咖啡来提神。 2. 累得要死，需要来杯新鲜冲泡的咖啡给我补充能量。 3. 感觉疲惫不堪，渴望一杯热腾腾的现磨咖啡来恢复精神。 4. 需要一杯香浓的现磨咖啡来驱散疲倦。 5. 忙碌了一整天，现在只想静静地品尝一杯香气扑鼻的咖啡，解除疲劳。 6. 急需一杯新鲜制作的咖啡，来将自己从瞌睡中拯救出来。 7. 觉得疲乏不堪，希望来杯即刻唤醒身心的现磨咖啡。 8. 身心俱疲，迫切地需要一杯现磨咖啡来迎接新的挑战。 9. 真希望能喝上一杯现磨咖啡，提振精神，重新集中注意力。 10. 周末晚上，感到疲乏不堪，想静下心来，享受一杯手工冲泡的咖啡带来的宁静和满足。"},{"instruction":"字数控制在 10 个中文字左右。","output":"1. 疲劳欲睡，需咖啡提神。"},{"instruction":"工程总承包企业，设计业务数字化如何开展？","output":"设计业务数字化开展的步骤如下： 1.明确数字化目标：确定数字化的目标和战略，明确想要实现的效益和目标。 2.调研和选择工具：调研市场上适用于设计业务数字化的软件和工具，选择合适的工具对设计业务进行数字化处理。 3.数据整理和归档：将设计业务所需的各类数据进行整理和归档，包括设计图纸、技术规范、材料清单等，保证数据的准确性和完整性。 4.数字化设计流程：将传统的设计流程转变为数字化的设计流程，包括设计协作、文件共享和沟通交流等环节，提高工作效率和设计质量。 5.数字化设计工具培训：为设计人员提供必要的培训和指导，使其能够熟练掌握数字化设计工具的使用方法和技巧。 6.信息化管理系统搭建：建立设计业务的信息化管理系统，包括项目管理、文件管理、成本控制、质量管理等，提高设计业务的管理效率和水平。 7.数据安全和保护：加强对设计业务数据的安全和保护，包括备份、权限管理、防止数据泄露等措施。 8.持续改进和优化：针对数字化设计业务的运营情况，进行持续改进和优化，根据实际需求调整数字化设计流程和工具的使用方式。 通过以上步骤，工程总承包企业可以逐步实现设计业务的数字化，提高工作效率和管理水平，降低成本和风险，提升市场竞争力。"},{"instruction":"把我说的中文翻译成日语","output":"おっしゃられた中国語を日本語に翻訳します。"},{"instruction":"我会尽快给您发送货物","output":"できるだけ早く商品をお送りいたします。"},{"instruction":"把我说的中文翻译成日语敬语","output":"おっしゃった内容を敬語で日本語に翻訳いたします。 「できるだけ早く商品をお送りいたします。」"},{"instruction":"不使用时，您可以放气并折叠它，因此不需要很大的存储空间。您可以将其放在房间的角落或床下。即使弄脏了，也可以通过快速擦拭轻松清洁。","output":"使用致します際には、お気軽に空気を抜き、折りたたむことができますので、大きな収納スペースは必要ありません。お部屋の隅やベッドの下などにおしまいいただけます。汚れた場合でも、素早く拭き取ることで簡単に清掃できます。"},{"instruction":"把我说的中文翻译成日语敬语","output":"御社のおっしゃっていただいた内容に関し、敬語で日本語に翻訳いたします。 「使用されない際は、お客様がお気軽に空気を抜き、お折り畳みいただけますので、大きな収納スペースは必要ございません。お部屋の隅やベッドの下などにお置きいただくことができます。万が一、汚れた場合でも、迅速にお拭き取りいただければ、簡単にお掃除ができます。」"},{"instruction":"洗头槽配有简易淋浴、枕头、防水片、围裙、排水管、气泵等，只需准备好热水、毛巾、洗发水即可立即洗头。 。如果使用简单的淋浴，您可以在房间里舒适地洗头，而无需前往浴室。洗完头发后排水也很容易。","output":"御社のおっしゃっていただいた内容に関し、敬語で日本語に翻訳いたします。 「洗髪槽には簡易シャワー、枕、防水シート、エプロン、排水パイプ、エアポンプなどが装備されており、温水、タオル、シャンプーを用意するだけで、すぐにお髪を洗うことができます。また、シンプルなシャワーを使用すれば、お部屋の中で快適にお髪を洗うことができますので、お風呂場に移動する必要はありません。お髪を洗った後の排水も簡単に行えます。」"},{"instruction":"适用人群广泛，如：需要护理的人士、老人、孕妇、受伤或手术后无法洗澡的人士以及不喜欢洗发的儿童等。","output":"御社のおっしゃっていただいた内容に関し、敬語で日本語に翻訳いたします。 「ご利用には幅広い方々が該当します。例えば、ケアを必要とする方々や高齢者、妊婦さん、けがや手術後でシャワーができない方々、そしてシャンプー嫌いなお子様などが含まれます。」"},{"instruction":"头花","output":"「頭花」という言葉の具体的な意味を教えていただくことは可能でしょうか？一般的な意味として、「頭花」という言葉は、女性が髪の毛に飾る花や装飾品を指すことがあります。しかし、より具体的な意味をお伝えするためには、文脈や詳細な情報が必要となります。もし他に具体的な説明や文脈情報があれば、教えてください。"},{"instruction":"袴","output":"「袴」は、日本の伝統的な衣装の一つで、主に男性が特別な場で着用する半ズボンのことを指します。袴は、正装や祭りなどで広く使用されることがあります。通常、袴は引き裾と呼ばれる部分があり、その下に白い長い足袋を履くことが一般的です。また、袴は特別な帯や装飾品と一緒に着用されることがあります。"},{"instruction":"由于电脑和智能手机显示屏的差异，实际产品可能与照片中显示的略有不同。 感谢您的理解。 人体模型比真人头部稍小。 想象一下百货商店里的人体模型的大小。 请务必检查实际尺寸","output":"パソコンやスマートフォンの画面表示の違いにより、実際の製品は写真と多少異なる場合があります。ご理解いただけますようお願い申し上げます。人体模型は実際の人間の頭部よりもやや小さいです。百貨店で見られる人体模型の大きさを想像してみてください。実際のサイズを必ずご確認ください。"},{"instruction":"共有6种颜色。太阳玫瑰色、流苏色、满天星色、水引色、古董浆果色等发饰的组合。","output":"「共有6种颜色。太阳玫瑰色、流苏色、满天星色、水引色、古董浆果色等发饰的组合。」を日本語に翻訳すると、「全体で6つの色があります。太陽のバラ色、フリンジ色、星のような色、水引色、アンティークベリー色などのヘアアクセサリーの組み合わせです。」となります。"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],L={key:0},N={key:1};function W(n,e,h,f,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
