The condition m geq 5 ensures that k > 0 (as shown later). 3. **Constructing the set B**: To construct B, define the sequence { x_n } as follows:    begin{align*}    x_0 &= 1,     x_k &= (m!) x_0 x_1 cdots x_{k-1} - 1 quad text{for} quad k geq 1.    end{align*}     4. **Defining intermediate sets**: Let    begin{align*}    B_0 &= {1, 2, cdots, m},     B_i &= {1, 2, cdots, m, x_1, x_2, cdots, x_i}.    end{align*} 5. **Setting up the equation for verification**:    Define:        k = m! - sum_{j=1}^{m} j^2.

Therefore, (x_1 - x_2)(a - frac{2}{x_1 + x_2}) = ln frac{x_1}{x_2} - frac{2(frac{x_1}{x_2} - 1)}{frac{x_1}{x_2} + 1}, let frac{x_1}{x_2} = t (t > 1), then mu(t) = ln t - frac{2(t-1)}{t+1}, t in (1, +infty), mu'(t) = frac{(t-1)^2}{t(t+1)^2} > 0, thus, mu(t) is increasing on (1, +infty), hence mu(t) > 0, and since x_1 - x_2 > 0, we have a - frac{2}{x_1 + x_2} > 0, thus, ln x_1 + ln x_2 = ax_2 + ax_1 > 0; therefore, x_1 cdot x_2 > e^2. Since g(x) = frac{1}{3}x^3 + x + 1 is increasing on mathbb{R}, then g(x_1x_2) > g(e^2). Thus, the final answers are: (1) The equation of the tangent line is boxed{2x - y + frac{1}{3} = 0}. (2) The function h(x) is increasing on (0, +infty) when a leq frac{1}{2}, and is increasing on (0, frac{2}{2a-1}) and decreasing on (frac{2}{2a-1}, +infty) when a > frac{1}{2}. (3) It is proven that g(x_1x_2) > g(e^2)."},{"instruction":"Prove that any triangle can be divided into 1981 similar triangles.","output":"1. **Understanding the problem:**    We need to prove that any triangle can be divided into 1981 smaller triangles that are similar to the original triangle. 2. **First Step - Drawing Medians:**    It's known from basic geometry that if we draw the medians of a triangle, the original triangle can be divided into 4 smaller triangles that are similar to the original triangle. This similarity arises because the medians of a triangle intersect at a single point, the centroid, which divides each median in a ratio of 2:1, thereby ensuring that the angles between corresponding sides of the triangles remain the same (proof by median triangle theorem).    ![Triangles with medians](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_b97fbd7f855faa1dc3a2g-1.jpg?height=856&width=634&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=732) 3. **Iterative Process:**    Next, to achieve our goal of exactly 1981 triangles, we will use an iterative process of drawing medians.        For every iteration:    - Each step, drawing the medians divides each of the existing triangles into 4 smaller, similar triangles (1 triangle becomes 4 triangles).    - Therefore, after one additional iteration, each of the 4 triangles from the previous step will be divided into 4 new triangles, making 16 similar triangles in total from the first iteration of 4. 4. **Mathematical Representation:**    Let's denote ( n ) as the number of iterations. The number of similar triangles generated at the ( n )-th iteration can be described by an exponential growth as follows:        Initially: ( 1 ) triangle.    After one iteration: ( 4 ) triangles.    After two iterations: ( 4^2 = 16 ) triangles.    Generally, after ( n ) iterations:    [    text{Number of triangles} = 4^n    ] 5. **Adjusting the Arithmetic Sequence:**    We start with 1 triangle. In each iteration, we increase the number of triangles by multiplying by 4 (every iteration creates 3 additional triangles for each existing triangle):    [    4^0 = 1, , 4^1 = 4, , 4^2 = 16, dots    ]    To reach the number 1981, we reframe this step by step. Each iteration produces a number of triangles that satisfies the equation:    [    text{Total triangles after } k text{ iterations} = 4^k ,(text{Needed: } 4^k ge 1981)    ]    However, revising the step mechanism, the actual growth can be also calculated using:    [    1 + 3k = 1981, , text{for some integer k}    ]    Solving for ( k ):    [    1981 = 3k + 1 implies 3k = 1980 implies k = frac{1980}{3} = 660    ]    Hence, it takes ( k = 660 ) iterations. 6. **Conclusion:**    By iterating the process of drawing medians 660 times, we effectively divide the original triangle into 1981 smaller triangles, all of which are similar to the original triangle.

Finally, using the identity:    [    left(r_i^2 + s_i^2right) left(r_j^2 + s_j^2right) = left(r_i r_j + s_i s_jright)^2 + left(r_i s_j - r_j s_iright)^2    ]    we iteratively apply this result to form polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) where:    [    P(x)^2 + Q(x)^2 = prod_{j=1}^n left(r_j^2(x) + s_j^2(x)right)    ] 7. This results in:    [    f(x) = (h(x) P(x))^2 + (h(x) Q(x))^2    ]     Thus, we have shown there are polynomials ( u(x) ) and ( v(x) ) with real coefficients such that ( f(x) = u^2(x) + v^2(x) ). blacksquare \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Let S<sub>n</sub> represent the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence {a<sub>n</sub>}.

The length of one half of the given diagonal is 4 (since the whole diagonal is 8), and the side length is 6. Therefore, the length of the other half-diagonal is: sqrt{{6}^{2}-{4}^{2}} = sqrt{36-16} = sqrt{20} = 2sqrt{5} Since this is half the length of the other diagonal, the full length of the other diagonal is 2 times 2sqrt{5} = 4sqrt{5}.

So, 80% of T speak either French or Russian or both. This is equal to 0.80 * 150 = 120 diplomats.

Between each pair of adjacent numbers, the product of the two numbers is written, and the original numbers are erased. The count of positive numbers does not change. What is the minimum number of positive numbers that could have been originally written? Let's analyze the problem step-by-step: 1. **Initial Assumption and Contradiction**:     - Assume there are no more than 33 positive numbers initially.     - Hence, there are at least (100 - 33 = 67) negative numbers.     - Consider the product of two numbers. If both numbers are negative, their product is positive. If one is positive and the other is negative, the product is negative.     - Since there are no more than 33 positive numbers, and each positive number can appear in up to 2 products, the number of positive products must be at most (33) (each positive number paired with 1 negative to make (33) negative products).     - Since the number of negative numbers is at least 67, there should be at least (frac{67}{2} + 1 approx 34) negative adjacent pairs, which makes a contradiction because there cannot be that many negative pairs forming products. Thus, our assumption that the number of positive numbers is at most 33 is incorrect. 2. **Constructing an Example with Minimal Positive Numbers**:     - Let's try with 34 positive numbers.     - Arrange the numbers as (+), (---), (---), (---), ... , (---). Start with one positive number followed by groups of 3 arranged counterclockwise.     - Each group (---) forms a single positive number, and the pattern continues. In total, we will have (1) positive number initially plus (33) groups of (3).  3. **Ensuring All Pairs Meet the Requirements**:     - This arrangement gives exactly (34) positive products: (1) from the initial positive-single and (33) from the negative triples.     - Each initial positive number influences (2) products (forming (1) additional positive pair and repeated pairs ensuring product continuity).

In each move, the player flips the switch of one lamp, but must not revert to an arrangement of lit lamps that has already been on the table. A player who cannot move loses.

Each move changes the state of one lamp (on to off, or off to on). The game terminates when a player cannot make a move that results in a unique state arrangement (i.e., a configuration of lit lamps that has not been seen before). 2. **Key observation:**    Each move flips the state of one lamp, changing the number of lit lamps by one. Thus, each move alters the parity (either odd or even) of the number of lit lamps. 3. **Game state classification:**    - Split all possible states into two sets:      - Set ( A ): states with an even number of lit lamps.      - Set ( B ): states with an odd number of lit lamps.        These two sets can be viewed as partitions, creating a bipartite graph ( G ). 4. **Graph properties:**    - Vertices represent the states.    - An edge connects two vertices if they can be reached from each other by flipping one lamp.     5. **Objective:**    We need a perfect matching in this bipartite graph ( G ). Hall's Marriage Theorem will be used to ensure this. 6. **Hall's Marriage Theorem:**    - For a bipartite graph ( G = (A cup B, E) ), a perfect matching exists if, for every subset ( S ) of ( A ), the size of the neighborhood of ( S ) (denoted ( N(S) )) is at least the size of ( S ):      [      |N(S)| geq |S|.      ] 7. **Applying Hall's Theorem:**    - For any subset ( S subseteq A ):      - Let ( |S| = n )      - Denote ( B ) as the neighboring states of ( S ) with ( |B| = m ).    - Each state in ( S ) has exactly 2012 neighbors (since flipping any of the 2012 lamps changes the state).    - There are ( 2012n ) edges between ( S ) and ( B ).    - Each state in ( B ) has at most 2012 neighbors, so there are at most ( 2012m ) edges between ( S ) and ( B ).      Hence, we have:      [      2012n leq 2012m implies n leq m.      ]    This satisfies Hall’s condition. 8. **Conclusion via Hall's theorem:**    Since Hall’s condition is satisfied, there is a perfect matching in the bipartite graph. This implies that every state can be paired with a unique state in the other set through a single lamp switch. 9. **Winning strategy for the first player:**    On their turn, the first player should always switch the lamp that moves the game state to its \\"partner\\" state in the perfect matching. This guarantees that the first player will always have a valid move available, while the second player will eventually run out of moves. Therefore, the first player has a winning strategy.

What is the cost per liter of fuel?","output":"First, let's calculate the total service cost for the vehicles. There are 4 mini-vans and 2 trucks, so the total number of vehicles is 4 + 2 = 6. The service cost per vehicle is 2.20, so the total service cost for all vehicles is 6 * 2.20 = 13.20. Now, let's find out the total fuel capacity for all the vehicles.  A mini-van's tank is 65 liters. A truck's tank is 120% bigger than a mini-van's, so we calculate the truck's tank size as follows: 120% of 65 liters = 1.2 * 65 = 78 liters. So, a truck's tank is 65 liters + 78 liters = 143 liters. Now, let's calculate the total fuel capacity for all the mini-vans and trucks: 4 mini-vans * 65 liters/mini-van = 260 liters for mini-vans. 2 trucks * 143 liters/truck = 286 liters for trucks. The total fuel capacity for all vehicles is 260 liters + 286 liters = 546 liters. Now, we know the total cost is 395.4, and we have already calculated the service cost to be 13.20. So, the cost for the fuel alone is 395.4 - 13.20 = 382.20. To find the cost per liter of fuel, we divide the total cost of fuel by the total fuel capacity: Cost per liter = 382.20 / 546 liters = 0.70 per liter.

The general term in the binomial expansion is given by {T}_{r+1}={C}_{6}^{r}(frac{2}{sqrt{x}})^{6-r}(-x)^{r}. This can be simplified to {T}_{r+1}=(-1)^{r}{C}_{6}^{r}{2}^{6-r}{x}^{frac{3r}{2}-3}. **For Statement A: Finding the Constant Term** To find the constant term, we set the exponent of x to 0, which leads to the equation frac{3r}{2}-3=0. Solving for r gives us r=2. Substituting r=2 into the general term formula, we get: [T_3 = (-1)^2{C}_{6}^{2}{2}^{4} = 15 cdot 16 = 240] Therefore, the constant term is indeed 240, making statement A correct. **For Statement B: Largest Binomial Coefficient** In a binomial expansion of the form (a+b)^n, the binomial coefficients are symmetric and reach their maximum at the middle term(s). Since {(frac{2}{sqrt{x}}-x)}^{6} has 7 terms (n+1 terms for an expansion of power n), the largest binomial coefficient is indeed at the 4th term. Thus, statement B is correct. **For Statement C: Coefficient of the 4th Term** The coefficient of the 4th term corresponds to r=3 in the general term formula. Substituting r=3 gives us: [T_4 = (-1)^3{C}_{6}^{3}{2}^{3} = -20 cdot 8 = -160] Since the coefficient is negative, it cannot be the largest. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. **For Statement D: Sum of the Coefficients** To find the sum of the coefficients, we can substitute x=1 into the original expression, which simplifies to {(frac{2}{sqrt{1}}-1)}^{6} = 1^{6} = 1. This shows that the sum of the coefficients is 1, not 64, making statement D incorrect. **Conclusion** The correct statements are A and B, so the answer is (boxed{AB})."},{"instruction":"A stock yielding 8% is quoted at 150.

We set f'(x) > 0 to find the increasing interval. Since e^{-ax} > 0 for all x, we only need to consider the sign of the quadratic expression (2x - ax^2).  Factoring out x, we have x(2 - ax) > 0.

[     P = 2     ]     - The maximum perimeter of an equilateral triangle with each side of length 1 is:     [     P = 3     ]     - Therefore, the range of the perimeter P will be:     [     2 < P leq 3     ] So, for a triangle ABC with a diameter of 1, the area S and perimeter P satisfy the inequalities: [ 0 < S leq frac{sqrt{3}}{4} quad (approx 0.433) quad text{and} quad 2 < P leq 3 ]  Part (b): We now consider a quadrilateral ABCD with diameter 1. 1. **Area of Quadrilateral**:     - The area S of a quadrilateral is given by:     [     S_{ABCD} = frac{1}{2} AC cdot BD cdot sin alpha     ]     where alpha is the angle between the diagonals.     - Given the longest diagonal is 1, we get:     [     S leq frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot sin alpha leq frac{1}{2}     ] 2. **Perimeter of Quadrilateral**:     - As no side of the quadrilateral can exceed 1, we have:     [     P < 4     ]     - Further, the perimeter can be reduced to arbitrarily close to 2 when vertices align almost in a straight line:     [     P > 2     ] So, for a quadrilateral ABCD with a diameter of 1, the area S and perimeter P satisfy the inequalities: [ 0 < S leq frac{1}{2} = 0.5 quad text{and} quad 2 < P < 4 ]  Part (c): Now, we consider a convex quadrilateral ABCD with diameter 1. 1. **Area of Convex Quadrilateral**:     - As argued initially, the maximum area for a convex quadrilateral remains the same:     [     0 < S leq frac{1}{2} = 0.5     ] 2. **Perimeter of Convex Quadrilateral**:     - The convex property does not change the logic for the perimeter:     [     P > 2     ]     - Determining the exact maximum value of the perimeter is complex. However, let's consider one proof case, wherein the rhomboid form provides a critical perimeter calculation. Given these proofs and constraints, the range of perimeters we can confirm: [ 2 < P leq 2 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2} approx 3.03 ] Therefore, for a convex quadrilateral ABCD with a diameter of 1, the area S and perimeter P satisfy the inequalities: [ 0 < S leq frac{1}{2} = 0.5 quad text{and} quad 2 < P leq 2 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2} quad (approx 3.03) ] Regarding the complexities of non-convex cases, the perimeter values can be higher, but focusing on convex polygons simplifies and constrains to more manageable ranges.  --- Overall, based on the insights given: boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given the ellipse (frac{x^{2}}{16}+frac{y^{2}}{4}=1) with the left and right foci (F_{1}) and (F_{2}) respectively, point (P) is on the line [ l: xsqrt{3} y+8+2 sqrt{3}=0 ] When (angle F_{1} P F_{2}) takes the maximum value, (frac{left|P F_{1}right|}{left|P F_{2}right|} =) ________","output":"1. The given ellipse equation is  [ frac{x^{2}}{16}+frac{y^{2}}{4}=1 ] 2.

The distance between the foci (2c) is given by  [ c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{16 - 4} = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3} ] 4.

Let's denote ( P_k(x) ) as the polynomial of degree ( n-1 ) such that:    [    P(x) = (x - x_k) P_k(x).    ]    Thus, we can express the derivative ( P'(x) ) using the product rule for differentiation:    [    P'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n P_k(x).    ] 3.

When will the area of the triangle A_{1}B_{1}C_{1} be the smallest, and when will it be the largest?","output":"1. **Connect (P) to the orthocenter (M):**        We start by connecting point (P) to the orthocenter (M) of triangle (ABC). We need to show the set of points (A_1), (B_1), (C_1), and (P) lie on a circle. To do this, observe that:    [    angle M A_1 P = angle M B_1 P = angle M C_1 P = 90^circ    ]        Since all these angles are right angles, it follows that the points (A_1), (B_1), (C_1), and (P) lie on the circumference of a circle with diameter (MP). Therefore, (A_1, B_1, C_1, M,) and (P) are concyclic. 2. **Establishing angle relations:**        By the property of cyclic quadrilaterals, the opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to (180^circ).

The value of ( MP ) reaches its minimum or maximum when it passes through the center ( O ) of the circumcircle of ( Delta ABC ). This means that when ( P ) is chosen to be on the a diameter through ( O ), the area depends on whether ( P ) is at the closest or farthest intersection point along ( OM):    Thus, the area of ( Delta A_1 B_1 C_1 ) reaches its smallest and largest values at these respective points. 7. **Conclusion:**        Based on the above analysis:    - ( Delta A_1 B_1 C_1 sim Delta ABC ).    - The smallest and largest areas correspond to the points on the diameter passing through ( O ).

Substituting these into the equation, we get:    [    (2a_0)^5 + 4(2b_0)^5 = 32k^5    ]    Simplifying, we have:    [    32a_0^5 + 4 cdot 32b_0^5 = 32k^5    ]    [    32a_0^5 + 128b_0^5 = 32k^5    ]    Dividing through by 32, we get:    [    a_0^5 + 4b_0^5 = k^5    ] 5. **Repeat the process**: Since ( k ) is even (as ( c = 2k ) and ( c ) is even), we can repeat the same argument.

We use induction:    - Base case: For ( n = 1 ), ( a_1 geq 4 cdot 1 + 9 = 13 ).    - Inductive step: Assume ( a_n geq 4n + 9 ). Then:      [      a_{n+1} geq (n+1)a_n - 2 geq (n+1)(4n + 9) - 2 = 4(n+1) + 9      ] 6. **Determine the general form of the sequence:**    Using the recurrence relation and the bounds, we find:    [    a_{n+2} = (n+4)(n+1)a_n    ]    This implies:    [    a_n = frac{(n+2)!}{n+1} c    ]    for some constant ( c ). 7. **Verify the initial conditions:**    Given ( a_0 geq 2015 ), we need to check the initial terms:    [    a_1 = 3c, quad a_2 = 8c    ]    Using the condition ( |s_2 - 2a_1| = 1 ), we get:    [    3a_1 - a_2 = a_0 pm 1 Rightarrow 3(3c) - 8c = a_0 pm 1 Rightarrow a_0 = c pm 1    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    The sequences that satisfy the given conditions are:    [    boxed{a_0 = c-1, c geq 2016, a_n = frac{(n+2)!}{n+1}c, forall n geq 1}    ]    and    [    boxed{a_0 = c+1, c geq 2014, a_n = frac{(n+2)!}{n+1}c, forall n geq 1}    ]"},{"instruction":"Let (a,) (b,) and (c) be positive real numbers such that [ frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = 9. ] Find the minimum value of (a^2 b^3 c^4.)","output":"By AM-GM, begin{align*} frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} &= frac{1}{2a} + frac{1}{2a} + frac{1}{3b} + frac{1}{3b} + frac{1}{3b} + frac{1}{4c} + frac{1}{4c} + frac{1}{4c} + frac{1}{4c}  &geq 9 sqrt[9]{frac{1}{2a} cdot frac{1}{2a} cdot frac{1}{3b} cdot frac{1}{3b} cdot frac{1}{3b} cdot frac{1}{4c} cdot frac{1}{4c} cdot frac{1}{4c} cdot frac{1}{4c}}  &= 9 sqrt[9]{frac{1}{1728a^2b^3c^4}}. end{align*} Since (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = 9,) this inequality simplifies to [ a^2 b^3 c^4 geq frac{1}{1728}. ] Equality occurs when (2a = 3b = 4c.)

Removing one matchstick affects 2 possible 1 times 1 squares (except on boundaries).    - **Maximum impact of removing 5 matchsticks:** Each removed matchstick can potentially eliminate up to 2 squares. However, some matchsticks could remove less if they partly border larger squares. 3. **Step 3: Refuting statement A:**    - Removing 5 matchsticks can at most eliminate (2 times 5 = 10) 1 times 1 squares.    - Therefore, 30 original 1 times 1 squares minus up to 10 gives at least (30 - 10 = 20) remaining 1 times 1 squares.    - Hence, the claim that only 5 squares are left must be incorrect.

These two statements are contradictory; hence one must be false. Evaluating hypothetically, removing 4 matchsticks from the same line would likely leave a critical structure detail discernable, hence making E more feasible incorrect.

In total, we have 5 entities to arrange in a row. 2. **Arrange these 5 entities**: The number of ways to arrange 5 entities is given by the permutation formula P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to arrange. Since we are arranging all 5 entities, r = n = 5. Thus, the formula simplifies to 5!. This equals 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120 ways.

If ( y ) is even, this operation changes the least significant bit from '0' to '1'. If ( y ) is odd, it changes the least significant bit from '1' to '0'.    - The operation ( frac{y-1}{4} ) is applicable if ( y-1 ) is divisible by 4. This operation effectively shifts the binary representation of ( y-1 ) two places to the right. 2. **Effect on the Number of 1's**:    - The operation ( 2x + 1 ) increases the number of '1's in the binary representation of ( x ) by 1.    - The operation ( y - 1 ) can either increase or decrease the number of '1's by 1, depending on whether ( y ) is even or odd.    - The operation ( frac{y-1}{4} ) can decrease the number of '1's by at most 1, as it involves shifting the binary representation. 3. **Initial Condition**:    - Initially, the numbers 2006 and 2008 are erased. Let's examine their binary representations:      [      2006_{(10)} = 11111010110_{(2)}      ]      [      2008_{(10)} = 11111011000_{(2)}      ]    - The number of '1's in 2006 is 8.    - The number of '1's in 2008 is 6. 4. **Effect of the First Move**:    - When 2006 and 2008 are replaced by ( 2 times 2006 + 1 ) and ( 2008 - 1 ):      [      2 times 2006 + 1 = 4013_{(10)} = 111110101101_{(2)}      ]      [      2008 - 1 = 2007_{(10)} = 11111010111_{(2)}      ]    - The number of '1's in 4013 is 9.    - The number of '1's in 2007 is 9. 5. **Conclusion**:    - The total number of '1's in the binary representation of the numbers on the blackboard has increased from ( 8 + 6 = 14 ) to ( 9 + 9 = 18 ).    - Since each move either increases the number of '1's or decreases it by at most 1, and the initial move increased the number of '1's, it is impossible to return to the original configuration with a total of 14 '1's.

Notice that:    - The first and third numbers share the hundreds digit '1'.    - The first and second numbers share the tens digit '0'.    - The second and third numbers share the units digit '4'. 5. We will make the assumption that the hundreds digit of the thought number is '1'. If we proceed with this assumption:    - The first and third numbers (109 and 124) will have the hundreds digit '1'.    - Now, analyze the tens and units digits. 6. From the conditions, the second number (704) must have its tens digit '0' shared with the thought number. This contradicts because our hundreds digit assumption '1' makes the measured digit at tens no other common with '0' as per conditions. 7. Therefore, the hundreds digit cannot be '1'. We will further analyze other positions. 8. By analogy, if the tens digit is '0':    - Tens digit must match in 109 and 704, this is:      - The common tens digit must contradict the conditions for 124 (here no other digit single). 9. Hence, the effective digit 'other than' 0 or 1 works: let’s analyze valid positions: 10. The assumptions must precisely parse attempted digits each matching the computational condition set.    - Second number's (704) hundreds position digit '7'.    - Third number (124) tens position with must be ‘2’. 11. Thus common unit of measure:   These conclude essentials verifying: 12.

Similarly, let (d') be another line passing through (B), which intersects (Gamma_1) again at (P') and (Gamma_2) again at (Q'). 4. We need to show that the lines (left(P P'right)) and (left(Q Q'right)) are parallel. 5. Consider the cyclic quadrilateral (ABP'P). By the property of cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of opposite angles is equal to (180^circ). Specifically, this means that:    [    angle P'BA + angle PAP' = 180^circ    ] 6. Similarly, consider the cyclic quadrilateral (ABQ'Q). The same cyclic property applies, so:    [    angle Q'BA + angle QAQ' = 180^circ    ] 7.

Combining these equalities, we obtain:     [     left(P^{prime} B, P^{prime} Pright) = left(P^{prime} B, Q^{prime} Qright)     ] 12.

The roots are at angles of 18^circ, 54^circ, 90^circ, 126^circ, 162^circ, 198^circ, 234^circ, 270^circ, 306^circ, and 342^circ. Among these roots, the ones with the maximum imaginary part correspond to the angles 54^circ and 126^circ. This is because the imaginary part of a complex number in polar form, operatorname{cis} theta, is maximized when theta is closest to 90^circ or 270^circ, but since we are looking for the maximum positive imaginary part, we focus on the roots closest to 90^circ but less than it. Therefore, the maximum imaginary part of a root can be expressed as sin theta, where theta = 54^circ.

By this configuration, points ( K ) and ( B ) lie on different sides of the line ( AC ). 2. **Relationship of Angles**:    Defined:    - ( angle BKC = frac{1}{2}(3angle A - angle C) ) 3. **Determining ( angle C )**:    We can express:    [    begin{aligned}    angle BKC &= angle BHC - angle HCK     &= angle A - frac{1}{2}angle B quad (text{tangent-chord angle})     &= frac{1}{2}(2angle A - angle B)     &= frac{1}{2}left(2angle A - 180^circ + angle A + angle Cright)     &= frac{1}{2}(3angle A + angle C - 180^circ)    end{aligned}    ]    By setting:    [    begin{aligned}    frac{1}{2}(3angle A + angle C - 180^circ) &= frac{1}{2}(3angle A - angle C)     text{Equating and simplifying:}     3angle A + angle C - 180^circ &= 3angle A - angle C     2angle C &= 180^circ     angle C &= 90^circ    end{aligned}    ]    Hence, ( angle C) is ( 90^circ ). 4. **Verification and Refinements**:    Due to the problem constraints:    - Sum of distances from ( O ) to ( AC ) and ( AB ) is 2.    - Sum of sides ( AC ) and ( AB ) is ( 2 + sqrt{3} ).

(A row intersects an Lshape if it contains at least one of its cells.)","output":"1. **Assumption and Initial Setup**: Assume that it is possible to partition a 12x12 checkerboard into shapes (corners) consisting of three adjacent cells in such a way that each row and column of the board intersects the same number of corners. Let's denote the first row from the bottom of the board as ( H_1 ) and the second row as ( H_2 ). 2. **Properties of the Corners**: Each corner shape on the board intersects exactly two adjacent rows horizontally and two adjacent columns vertically. 3. **Intersection with Horizontal Rows**: If a corner intersects row ( H_1 ), it must also intersect row ( H_2 ). Therefore, if horizontal row ( H_2 ) intersects a corner that does not intersect ( H_1 ), then ( H_2 ) would intersect more corners than ( H_1 ). However, all rows must intersect the same number of corners, leading to a contradiction if ( H_2 ) intersects more corners than ( H_1 ). 4. **Horizontal Strip**: Consequently, all corners intersecting the first two horizontal rows must be contained within a horizontal strip of size ( 2 times 12 ). This strip is denoted ( H ). 5. **Intersection with Vertical Columns**: Similarly, consider the first column from the left of the board as ( V_1 ) and the second column as ( V_2 ). The same logic applies here: if a corner intersects column ( V_1 ), it also intersects column ( V_2 ), ensuring that all corners intersecting the first two vertical columns must be contained within a vertical strip of size ( 12 times 2 ). This strip is denoted ( V ). 6. **Resulting Square Intersection**: As a result, all corners intersecting both the first two rows and the first two columns must be confined within the ( 2 times 2 ) square at the bottom-left corner of the board. 7. **Contradiction**: It is not possible to partition a ( 2 times 2 ) square into three-cell corners because this square itself is too small. Therefore, it leads to a contradiction, indicating that such a partition is not feasible. # Conclusion: Since any partition leads to a contradiction, it is impossible to partition the 12x12 checkerboard into corners such that each row and each column intersects the same number of corners.

The winning strategy is to ensure leaving an even number of 3-piles and odd-piles after each move.  Conclusion: The first player adopts the strategy of transforming the starting heaps to ensure an even count of 3-piles and odd-piles, guaranteeing a win by following similar responses.

Thus, the uphill section towards city (A) will be (z) km and the downhill section will be (y) km. 2. **Setup the Equations**:    Using the given times and speeds, we derive two equations based on the time relationship ( text{time} = frac{text{distance}}{text{speed}} ):    [    frac{x}{4} + frac{y}{3} + frac{z}{6} = 2.3 quad text{(Equation 1)}    ]    [    frac{x}{4} + frac{y}{6} + frac{z}{3} = 2.6 quad text{(Equation 2)}    ] 3. **Simplify and Combine the Equations**:    By adding both equations, we obtain:        [    left( frac{x}{4} + frac{y}{3} + frac{z}{6} right) + left( frac{x}{4} + frac{y}{6} + frac{z}{3} right) = 2.3 + 2.6    ]    Simplifying the terms, we get:    [    frac{x}{2} + frac{y}{2} + frac{z}{2} = 4.9    ]    Multiplying by 2:    [    x + y + z = 9.8 quad text{(Equation for total distance (s))}    ]    Hence, the total distance (s) traveling from (A) to (B) is:    [    s = x + y + z = 9.8 text{ km}    ]    (boxed{9.8 text{ km}}) 4. **Determine the Difference (z - y)**:    Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:    [    left( frac{x}{4} + frac{y}{6} + frac{z}{3} right) - left( frac{x}{4} + frac{y}{3} + frac{z}{6} right) = 2.6 - 2.3    ]    Simplify:    [    frac{y}{6} - frac{y}{3} + frac{z}{3} - frac{z}{6} = 0.3    ]    [    -frac{y}{6} + frac{z}{6} = 0.3    ]    Multiply by 6:    [    -y + z = 1.8    ]    Thus, we find:    [    z - y = 1.8 text{ km}    ]    This means that the downhill (towards (B)) section is 1.8 km more than the uphill section. # Part II: 1. **Change the Downhill Speed**: When the pedestrian's speed on the downhill section is 5 km/h instead of 6 km/h. 2. **Derive New Equations**:    Using the new speed, we set new equations:    [    frac{x'}{4} + frac{y'}{3} + frac{z'}{5} = 2.3 quad text{(Equation 3)}    ]    [    frac{x'}{4} + frac{y'}{5} + frac{z'}{3} = 2.6 quad text{(Equation 4)}    ] 3. **Combine the Equations**:    Adding both equations:    [    left( frac{x'}{4} + frac{y'}{3} + frac{z'}{5} right) + left( frac{x'}{4} + frac{y'}{5} + frac{z'}{3} right) = 2.3 + 2.6    ]    Simplifying:    [    frac{x'}{2} + frac{8}{15}(y' + z') = 4.9    ] 4. **Lower Bound for ( s')**:    Increasing the coefficient of (x'):    [    frac{8}{15} (x' + y' + z') > 4.9    ]    Solving for (s'):    [    frac{8s'}{15} > 4.9 implies s' > frac{4.9 cdot 15}{8}    ]    Thus:    [    s' > 9.1875 text{ km}    ] 5. **Upper Bound for ( s')**:    Determine the difference (z' - y'):    [    frac{2}{15}(z' - y') = 0.3 implies z' - y' = 2.25    ]    Substituting in the combined equation:    [    frac{x'}{2} + frac{8}{15} (2 y') + frac{8 cdot 2.25}{15} = 4.9    ]        Simplifying:    [    frac{x'}{2} + frac{16y'}{15} = 3.7    ]    To find an upper bound:    [    frac{1}{2}(x' + 2y') < 3.7 implies x' + 2 y' < 7.4 implies s' < 9.65 text{ km}    ]    Therefore, combining the bounds:    [    9.1875 text{ km} < s' < 9.65 text{ km}    ]    This concludes the calculation for the distances with the changed downhill speed.

The problem states that we can change all numbers in any (3 times 3) table to zero using the allowed operations. This is our base case. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**    Assume that for any (k times l) table where (k + l = m + n - 1), we can change all numbers to zero using the allowed operations. 3. **Induction Step**    We need to show that for an (m times n) table, where (m + n > 6), we can change all numbers to zero.    - Consider a (3 times 3) sub-table (S(i,j)) within the (m times n) table.

By the induction hypothesis, we can change all numbers in this sub-table to zero. 5. **Handling the (m)-th Column**    - We need to show that all numbers in the (m)-th column can be made equal.    - Consider the sub-table (S(1,m)):      [      T_{S(1,m)} = A(2,m) - A(3,m) + A(3,m-1) - A(2,m-2) + A(1,m-2) - A(1,m-1)      ]      Since (T_{S(1,m)} = 0), we have:      [      A(2,m) - A(3,m) = 0 implies A(2,m) = A(3,m)      ]    - Similarly, for (S(2,m), S(3,m), ldots, S(n-2,m)), we can show:      [      A(3,m) = A(4,m), A(4,m) = A(5,m), ldots, A(n-1,m) = A(n,m)      ]      Thus, (A(2,m) = A(3,m) = ldots = A(n,m) = ell). 6. **Making the (m)-th Column Zero**    - We can use the allowed operations (ell) times to change (A(2,m) = A(3,m) = ldots = A(n,m)) to zero.    - Similarly, we can change (A(1,m)) to zero using the allowed operations. 7. **Conclusion**    By induction, we have shown that for any (m times n) table, we can change all numbers to zero using the allowed operations.

According to the information given: 1) Half the dogs have spots, so the number of dogs with spots is D/2. 2) 1/5 of the dogs have pointy ears, so the number of dogs with pointy ears is D/5. Since we know the number of dogs with pointy ears is a certain number, let's call this number P. Therefore, P = D/5. To find out how many dogs have spots, we need to express the number of spotted dogs in terms of P. Since P is the number of dogs with pointy ears, we can write: P = D/5 To find D, we multiply both sides by 5: 5P = D Now we know the total number of dogs (D) in terms of P. To find the number of dogs with spots, we substitute D in the first equation: Number of dogs with spots = D/2 Number of dogs with spots = (5P)/2 So, the number of dogs with spots is half of five times the number of dogs with pointy ears.

The tangent of ( alpha ) can be found using the relationship:    [    tan alpha = frac{1}{cot alpha} = frac{1}{2}    ] 5. The projection of the diagonal on the base is equal to the length of the median of the trapezoid. The median of a trapezoid is given by:    [    text{Median} = frac{a + b}{2}    ] 6. From geometric properties, the height ( h ) of the trapezoid can also be expressed using the tangent of angle ( alpha ), given that:    [    text{projection} = h tan(alpha) = h times frac{1}{2} = frac{h}{2}    ]    Hence, the new relationship for the median is:    [    frac{a+b}{2} = h    ] 7. Substituting this into equation (1):    [    (a + b) times h = 64 implies 2h times h = 64 implies 2h^2 = 64 implies h^2 = 32 implies h = 4    ]    Thus, the height of the trapezoid is:    [    boxed{4}"},{"instruction":"The sides of a triangle are all different, and its three heights are integers, among which two are 3 and 10, respectively.

According to the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side, the length of side c must be between frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{10} = frac{13}{30} and left| frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{10} right| = frac{7}{30}. Therefore, the length of the height corresponding to side c must be between frac{30}{13} and frac{30}{7}, which means it must be greater than 2.2 but less than 4.5. The only integers in this range are 3 and 4. However, since all sides of the triangle are different, their corresponding heights must also be different.

The location of the heads and tails should not repeat. Loses the one who can not make a move. Which of player can always win, no matter how his opponent plays?","output":"1. Let's analyze the problem by considering the possible moves and the constraints. Each player takes turns flipping a coin, and the sequence of heads and tails should not repeat. The player who cannot make a move loses. 2. To determine the winning strategy, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins, ( n ). 3. If ( n ) is odd:    - The first player can always flip the same coin. Since the number of coins is odd, the first player will always have a move to make, while the second player will eventually run out of moves. This is because the first player can always flip the coin back to its original state, ensuring that the sequence of heads and tails does not repeat. 4. If ( n ) is even:    - The situation is more complex. The first player cannot simply flip the same coin repeatedly, as the second player will eventually force a situation where the first player has no valid move. In this case, the second player can always respond to the first player's move by flipping a different coin, ensuring that the sequence of heads and tails does not repeat. 5. Therefore, the first player can always win if ( n ) is odd, and the second player can always win if ( n ) is even. Conclusion: The first player can always win if the number of coins ( n ) is odd. The second player can always win if the number of coins ( n ) is even.

We are interested in finding the probability that the sum of these two numbers is less than their product. Mathematically, this condition can be expressed as ab > a + b.

There are 5 times 5 = 25 total combinations when selecting two numbers from the set of positive integers less than or equal to 5, considering the order of selection does not matter.

If the hypotenuse and one leg of one right triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and leg of another right triangle, then the two triangles are congruent. B: This statement is true.

[      Rightarrow (n^{2}-n+3, 6n)      ] 5. **Analyzing Cases:**    - For the fraction to be reducible, 6n must share a common factor with n^2 - n + 3.      - Since n^2 - n + 3 is always odd for any integer n, it doesn't evenly divide by 2.      - Thus, we investigate:        [        (n, 3)        ]      - Here, for common factor greater than 1, n must be a multiple of 3:        [        n = 3k        ]    - We also consider other cases where the GCD would favor another divisor of 3 leading to:        [        n = 3k + 1        ]      or         [        n = 3k        ] **Conclusion:**   Hence, the fraction is reducible when:    [    boxed{n = 3k  text{or}  n = 3k + 1}    ] **Final Answers:** - For part (a):    [   boxed{n = 3k - 1}   ] - For part (b):   [   boxed{n = 3k  text{or}  n = 3k + 1}   ]"},{"instruction":"Calculate the area enclosed by the following lines: 1) The parabola (4y = 8x  x^{2}) and the line (4y = x + 6); 2) The parabolas (y = 4  x^{2}) and (y = x^{2}  2x); 3) The cubic parabolas (6x = y^{3}  16y) and (24x = y^{3}  16y); 4) The ellipse (x = a cos t, y = a sin t); 5) The cardioid (rho = a (1 + cos varphi)); 6) The circles (rho = 2 sqrt{3} a cos varphi) and (rho = 2a sin varphi).","output":"**1) Calculate the area bounded by the parabola 4y = 8x - x^2 and the line 4y = x + 6** 1. **Finding intersection points**:    Set the equations equal to find intersection points:    [    4y = 8x - x^2 quad text{and} quad 4y = x + 6    ]    Equating these:    [    8x - x^2 = x + 6    ]    Rearrange to solve for x:    [    x^2 - 7x + 6 = 0    ]    The quadratic equation factors as:    [    (x-1)(x-6) = 0    ]    Therefore, the solutions are:    [    x = 1 quad text{and} quad x = 6    ]    Plugging these x values back into 4y = x + 6 to find corresponding y values:    [    begin{aligned}    text{For } x = 1: & quad 4y = 1 + 6     & quad y = frac{7}{4}     text{For } x = 6: & quad 4y = 6 + 6     & quad y = 3    end{aligned}    ]    So, the points of intersection are:    [    Aleft(1, frac{7}{4}right) quad text{and} quad B(6, 3)    ] 2. **Determine areas between curves**:    The area between the curves from x=1 to x=6:    [    S = int_{1}^{6} left( f(x) - g(x) right) dx    ]    where    [    f(x) = frac{1}{4}(8x - x^2) quad text{and} quad g(x) = frac{1}{4}(x + 6)    ]    Simplify:    [    begin{aligned}    S &= int_{1}^{6} left( frac{1}{4}(8x - x^2) - frac{1}{4}(x + 6) right) dx     &= int_{1}^{6} frac{1}{4} left( (8x - x^2) - (x + 6) right) dx     &= int_{1}^{6} frac{1}{4} left( 8x - x^2 - x - 6 right) dx     &= int_{1}^{6} frac{1}{4} left( 7x - x^2 - 6 right) dx     &= frac{1}{4} int_{1}^{6} left( 7x - x^2 - 6 right) dx     end{aligned}    ]    Compute the integral:    [    begin{aligned}    frac{1}{4} int_{1}^{6} left( 7x - x^2 - 6 right) dx &= frac{1}{4} left[ int_{1}^{6} 7x , dx - int_{1}^{6} x^2 , dx - int_{1}^{6} 6 , dx right]     &= frac{1}{4} left[ left. frac{7x^2}{2} right|_{1}^{6} - left. frac{x^3}{3} right|_{1}^{6} - left. 6x right|_{1}^{6} right]    end{aligned}    ]    Evaluate each term:    [    begin{aligned}    left. frac{7x^2}{2} right|_{1}^{6} &= frac{7(6^2)}{2} - frac{7(1^2)}{2} = frac{252}{2} - frac{7}{2} = 126 - 3.5 = 122.5     left. frac{x^3}{3} right|_{1}^{6} &= frac{6^3}{3} - frac{1^3}{3} = frac{216}{3} - frac{1}{3} = 72 - frac{1}{3} = 71.6667     left. 6x right|_{1}^{6} &= 6(6) - 6(1) = 36 - 6 = 30    end{aligned}    ]    Combining these terms:    [    frac{1}{4} left[ 122.5 - 71.6667 - 30 right] = frac{1}{4} left[ 122.5 - 101.6667 right] = frac{1}{4} left[ 20.8333 right] = 5.2083    ]    Conclusion:    [    boxed{5.2083}    ] This completes the detailed solution for the first task in the problem statement."},{"instruction":"Three tourists need to cross from one side of a river to the other.

Let us denote by w the complex number defined by     [     w = cos left(frac{2pi}{n}right) + i sin left(frac{2pi}{n}right).     ]     Multiplication by w corresponds to a rotation around the origin by an angle frac{2pi}{n} counterclockwise, and multiplication by overline{w} corresponds to a rotation by the same angle clockwise. 3. **Key Rotations**: Under these rotations, the point A_j rotates around B_{j-1} by the angle frac{2pi}{n} counterclockwise to become A_{j-1}, and around B_j clockwise to become A_{j+1}. 4. **Equatorial Equations**:     Since A_j rotates around B_{j-1} and B_j, we can establish that:     [     A_{j-1} - B_{j-1} = w left(A_{j} - B_{j-1} right),     ]     [     A_{j+1} - B_{j} = overline{w} left(A_{j} - B_{j} right),     ]     for all j=1,ldots,n (considering A_{0}=A_{n} and A_{n+1}=A_{1}). 5. **Rewriting the Equations**:    To isolate B_{j-1} and B_j, we rewrite the above equations as:     [     B_{j-1}(w - 1) = w A_{j} - A_{j-1},     ]     [     B_{j}(overline{w} - 1) = overline{w} A_{j} - A_{j+1}.     ]     Adding these equations, we use the identity (w - 1 = -w(overline{w} - 1)):     [     left(B_{j} - w B_{j-1} right)(overline{w} - 1) = (w + overline{w})A_{j} - A_{j-1} - A_{j+1}.     ] 6. **Regularity Condition**:    We need the polygon B_{1}B_{2}ldots B_{n} to be regular.

During the year, each student had a birthday party, attended by some (at least one but not all) of their classmates. Could it happen that every pair of students attended the same number of such parties? Assume that at each party, any two guests are considered to have met, as well as the birthday celebrant with all guests. Let's explore two possible scenarios in which such arrangements are feasible: 1. **First Solution:**    Consider organizing the students in a circular way. Suppose that on each student's birthday, all their classmates attend, except the one who is next to them in the clockwise direction. We will show that in this arrangement, each pair of students meets exactly 21 times during the year.    1. Denote the students as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{23} arranged in a circle.    2. On A_i's birthday, all students A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{23} except A_{i+1 (text{mod}, 23)} attend the party.    3. Consider any two students, A and B. Without loss of generality, suppose A = A_i and B = A_j.     4. The students A_i and A_j will meet at every birthday party except the following:       - A_i's birthday, where B = A_{i+1 (text{mod}, 23)} will not attend.       - A_j's birthday, where A  will not attend as per our setup.    5. Hence, any pair of students will meet at exactly 23 - 2 = 21 birthday parties.    Therefore, **every pair of students meets 21 times**.    [    boxed{21}    ] 2. **Second Solution:**    Let's construct another example where a specific tying of attendings ensures even distribution.    1. Pick two students, call them A and B. For simplicity, let's have A = A_1 and B = A_23.    2. On A_1's birthday, all students except A_23 attend.    3. On A_23's birthday, only A_1 attends (no other students show up).    4. On all other students' birthdays, only A_23 shows up, and no other students (except the birthday person).    5. In this arrangement, any pair without A_23 only meets on A_1's birthday.    6. All pairs involving A_23 will meet exactly once during another student's birthday party.    Here, **every pair of students meets exactly once**:    [    boxed{1}    ] # Conclusion: These solutions illustrate that it is possible for each pair of students to meet the same number of times at birthday parties given specific attendance patterns. The number of meetings can be either 21 or 1, depending on the distribution pattern, confirming that such a uniformity is feasible in the given scenario.

How many swallows are in the flock?","output":"Let's denote the number of European swallows as E and the number of American swallows as A. According to the information given: A = 2E (since there are twice as many American swallows as European swallows) The carrying capacity of an American swallow is 5 pounds, and a European swallow can carry twice that amount, which is 10 pounds. The total carrying capacity of the flock is 600 pounds. So, the equation for the total carrying capacity of the flock would be: 5A + 10E = 600 Since A = 2E, we can substitute A in the equation: 5(2E) + 10E = 600 10E + 10E = 600 20E = 600 Now, divide both sides by 20 to find the number of European swallows: E = 600 / 20 E = 30 Now that we know there are 30 European swallows, we can find the number of American swallows: A = 2E A = 2 * 30 A = 60 So, there are 30 European swallows and 60 American swallows.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding the probability:      mathrm{P}left{max_{1 leq i leq 2m-1} tilde{S}_i leq 0right}.  5. **Result from Known Theorem**:     Based on the problem's I.10.3 reference, we can directly quote:      mathrm{P}left{max_{1 leq i leq 2m-1} tilde{S}_i leq 0right} = 2^{-2m+1} binom{2m-1}{m-1}.  6. **Combining Probabilities**:     The expression for one condition will be symmetrical to the other. Thus, the combined probability will be:      2 times 2^{-2m+1} binom{2m-1}{m-1} = 2^{-2m} binom{2m}{m}.

Since the man is walking in the direction of the moving train, we subtract the man's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed.

Since the train is 600 m long, the distance it needs to travel to completely cross the man is equal to its own length, which is 600 m. The time taken by the train to cross the man is given as 35.99712023038157 seconds.

So, the volume of the tank can also be expressed as: [ V = 25 times frac{2}{5}C ] Since the volume of the tank doesn't change, we can set these two expressions for ( V ) equal to each other: [ N times C = 25 times frac{2}{5}C ] Now, we can solve for ( N ): [ N = 25 times frac{2}{5} ] [ N = 25 times frac{2}{5} ] [ N = 5 times 2 ] [ N = 10 ] So, boxed{10}  buckets of water are required with the original bucket size to fill the tank."},{"instruction":"What is the condition for two medians of a triangle to be perpendicular to each other?","output":"1. **Introduction and Setup:**     We need to determine the condition under which the medians from two vertices of a triangle are perpendicular to each other. Consider triangle ( triangle ABC ) with medians from vertices ( A ) and ( B ) meeting at the centroid ( S ). We require these medians to be perpendicular to each other. 2. **Thales' Theorem Application:**     Since the medians from ( A ) and ( B ) are perpendicular at the centroid ( S ), ( S ) lies on the circle with diameter ( AB ) (by Thales' Theorem). Thus, the centroid ( S ) must be at a right angle with respect to side ( AB ). Therefore, ( S ) lies on the circumference of the semicircle with diameter ( AB ). 3. **Distance Relation:**     [     SC_1 = frac{AB}{2}     ]     where ( C_1 ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), and ( S ) is the centroid that trisects the segment ( CC_1 ).     Since ( S ) trisects ( CC_1 ), we write:     [     C_1C = 3 cdot SC_1 = frac{3}{2} cdot AB     ]     Hence, ( C ) must lie on a circle with center ( C_1 ) and radius ( frac{3}{2} cdot AB ). 4. **Generalization:**     Any triangle will satisfy the condition ( C_1C = frac{3c}{2} ), where ( c = AB ). Let ( C^* ) be the reflection of ( C ) through ( C_1 ). Then the quadrilateral ( CACC^* ) forms a parallelogram, hence:     [     CC^{* 2} + AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 + BC^*2 + C^*A^2     ] 5. **Substitution for Special Case:**     Substitute ( C_1C = frac{3c}{2} ) into the equation:     [     (3c/2)^2 + c^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2     ]     simplifies to:     [     frac{9c^2}{4} + c^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2     ]     [     frac{13c^2}{4} = 2a^2 + 2b^2     ]     [     frac{13c^2}{4} = 2(a^2 + b^2)     ]     [     13c^2 = 8(a^2 + b^2)     ]     Rearrange it to find the necessary relationship between ( a, b, ) and ( c ):     [     5c^2 = a^2 + b^2     ] 6. **Conclusion:**     Hence, the necessary and sufficient condition for the medians from vertices ( A ) and ( B ) to be perpendicular to each other is:     [     a^2 + b^2 = 5c^2     ]     This condition ensures that the sides ( a) and ( b ) of the triangle are such that their squares sum up to (5) times ( c^2 ).

However, this does not guarantee that the line is parallel to every line in the plane. Some lines in the plane might intersect the given line if extended outside the plane. Therefore, Proposition A is incorrect because it generalizes incorrectly that the line is parallel to any line in the plane. **Proposition B:** If in plane alpha, there are three non-collinear points A, B, C with equal distances to plane beta, this suggests that plane alpha could be parallel to plane beta. However, without additional information, it's also possible that plane alpha intersects plane beta outside of the region defined by points A, B, and C. Therefore, Proposition B is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of alpha intersecting beta. **Proposition C:** Given b parallel alpha and alpha parallel beta, it might seem that b should be parallel to beta by transitivity. However, this proposition overlooks the scenario where b could be contained within plane beta. Therefore, Proposition C is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of b being contained in beta. **Proposition D:** Given a parallel alpha and a parallel b, with the additional information that b is not parallel to alpha, we analyze the situation. Since a is parallel to alpha, there exists a line m in alpha such that a parallel m. Given a parallel b, by transitivity, b parallel m.

The correct interpretation should conclude that if a is parallel to both b and alpha, and if b is not parallel to alpha, then the initial conditions are inconsistent rather than leading to a conclusion about b's relationship to alpha. Therefore, upon reevaluation, Proposition D's correctness is based on a misinterpretation of the conditions. The correct approach would be to identify the inconsistency in the given conditions. Upon careful reevaluation, it appears that the initial solution's conclusion about Proposition D being correct is based on a misunderstanding of the conditions provided. The correct interpretation should identify inconsistencies in the setup rather than affirming the proposition. Therefore, after reevaluating each proposition with detailed analysis, it becomes clear that the initial conclusion might have been hastily drawn without fully considering the implications and conditions of each proposition. The aim was to stay as close as possible to the given answer, but upon deeper analysis, the complexities of the propositions, especially Proposition D, suggest a need for a more nuanced understanding. Given the detailed step-by-step analysis, it's evident that the initial solution may have oversimplified the evaluation of Proposition D.

We have the following ratio:    [    frac{RX}{RM_C} = frac{M_BX}{M_AM_B} = frac{PX}{PQ}    ] 3. **Trigonometric Ratios**: Using trigonometric identities, we can express the ratio frac{PX}{PQ} as:    [    frac{PX}{PQ} = frac{CX}{CQ} cdot frac{sin angle PCX}{sin angle QCP}    ]    Since angle PCX = angle XAR and angle QCP = angle M_CAR, we have:    [    frac{PX}{PQ} = frac{CX}{CQ} cdot frac{sin angle XAR}{sin angle M_CAR}    ] 4. **Simplifying Ratios**: Given frac{RX}{RM_C} = frac{XA}{AM_C} cdot frac{sin angle XAR}{sin angle M_CAR}, we equate:    [    frac{CX}{CQ} = frac{AX}{AM_C}    ] 5. **Angle Relationships**: Knowing measuredangle X_AMC = measuredangle XCQ, we conclude that Delta XAM_C cup R stackrel{+}{sim} Delta XCQ cup P.

Suppose side (a) is fixed and the perimeter ( P ) of the triangle is given (so ( a + b + c = P )).     The semi-perimeter then becomes:    [    p = frac{P}{2}    ] 3. **Rewriting Heron's Formula**:    [    S^2 = p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)    ] 4. Given that (p) and (a) are constants, we focus on maximizing the product ((p-b)(p-c)).     Notice:    [    (p-b) + (p-c) = p - b + p - c = frac{P}{2} - b + frac{P}{2} - c = P - (b + c) = P - (P - a) = a     ]    Hence, ((p-b)) and ((p-c)) are parts that sum to a constant (a). 5. **Maximizing Product**:    Using the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality:    [    (p - b) + (p - c) = a implies frac{(p - b) + (p - c)}{2} = frac{a}{2}    ]    By AM-GM inequality:    [    sqrt{(p - b)(p - c)} leq frac{(p - b) + (p - c)}{2} = frac{a}{2}    ] 6. The product ((p - b)(p - c)) is maximized when (p-b = p-c).     That is:    [    p - b = p - c implies b = c    ] Thus, a triangle will have the maximum area when it is an isosceles triangle with (b = c). **Conclusion**: [ boxed{b = c} ] **Part (b)** To show that among all triangles with a given side (a) and a given area, the one with the minimum perimeter is an isosceles triangle (where the given side (a) is the base): 1. **Using Part (a)**:    From Part (a), we deduced that an isosceles triangle maximizes the area for a given side and perimeter. 2. An isosceles triangle (b = c) also implies symmetry which often leads to extremal (either minimum or maximum) properties.     To show that the perimeter is minimal for the given area:    [    P = a + 2b    ]     3. For a triangle with maximum area given a fixed side and perimeter, it follows that for the same area, the isosceles triangle will offer the minimum perimeter because deviating from the isosceles configuration increases the sum of the other two sides while maintaining the same area. 4. Therefore, reverting from an arbitrary triangle to an isosceles form will decrease the perimeter ( P ) while maintaining the fixed area. **Conclusion**: The same line of reasoning as part (a) leads us to conclude that an isosceles triangle will minimize the perimeter for a given area and one side.

(1) When n = 4k + 1, a = 1^{4k+1} = 1, b = 2^{4k+1} = 2 cdot (2^4)^k = 2 cdot 16^k,   since no matter what integer k is, the units digit of 16^k is always 6, thus the units digit of 2 cdot 16^k must be 2,   c = 3^{4k+1} = 3 cdot 81^k, since the units digit of 81^k is always 1, thus the units digit of 3 cdot 81^k must be 3,   similarly, the units digit of d = 4^{4k+1} is 4, hence when n = 4k + 1, the units digit of a + b + c + d is the units digit of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, which is 0,   thus it is divisible by 10; (2) When n = 4k + 2, a = 1^{4k+2} = 1, b = 2^{4k+2} = 4 cdot (2^4)^k = 4 cdot 16^k,   since no matter what integer k is, the units digit of 16^k is always 6, thus the units digit of 4 cdot 16^k must be 4,   c = 3^{4k+2} = 9 cdot 81^k, since the units digit of 81^k is always 1, thus the units digit of 9 cdot 81^k must be 9,   similarly, the units digit of d = 4^{4k+2} is 6, hence when n = 4k + 2, the units digit of a + b + c + d is the units digit of 1 + 4 + 9 + 6, which is 0,   thus it is divisible by 10; (3) When n = 4k + 3, a = 1^{4k+3} = 1, b = 2^{4k+3} = 8 cdot (2^4)^k = 8 cdot 16^k,   since no matter what integer k is, the units digit of 16^k is always 6, thus the units digit of 8 cdot 16^k must be 8,   c = 3^{4k+3} = 27 cdot 81^k, since the units digit of 81^k is always 1, thus the units digit of 27 cdot 81^k must be 7,   similarly, the units digit of d = 4^{4k+3} is 4, hence when n = 4k + 3, the units digit of a + b + c + d is the units digit of 1 + 8 + 7 + 4, which is 0,   thus it is divisible by 10; In conclusion, when n is not a multiple of 4, 1^n + 2^n + 3^n + 4^n is divisible by 10. boxed{text{Proved}}"},{"instruction":"Given that a > 0, b > 0, and ab = a + b, find the minimum value of a + 4b.","output":"Since a > 0, b > 0, and ab = a + b, therefore frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1, therefore (a + 4b)(frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b}) = 1 + 4 + frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b} geqslant 5 + 2sqrt{frac{4b}{a} times frac{a}{b}} = 9, only when a = 3, b = frac{3}{2}, taking the equality, therefore a + 4b attains the minimum value 9; Hence, the answer is: boxed{9} From the conditions, we can get frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1, i.e., (a + 4b)(frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b}) = 1 + 4 + frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b}, then by using the basic inequality, we can find the minimum value.

Based on the given condition that x in (1, +infty) and f(x) + f'(x) < xf'(x), we can deduce that g(x) = frac{f(x)}{x - 1} is increasing on (1, +infty). Since sqrt{2} < 2 < 3, we can determine the relationship among a, b, and c. This problem tests the application of derivative knowledge and the understanding of a function's monotonicity.

(Two divisions are not considered different if one can be transformed into the other by rotation around the center or reflection across a line passing through the center.)","output":"1. Let ( h ) be the number of triangles formed in a given subdivision of a regular dodecagon (12-sided polygon). Therefore, the total number of sides in the triangles will be ( 3h ) since each triangle has 3 sides. 2. Some of these sides are also diagonals of the dodecagon, and each diagonal is counted twice as it belongs to two triangles. 3. The sum of the interior angles of all triangles is ( h times 180^circ ). 4. In a dodecagon, the sum of the interior angles is ((12-2) times 180^circ = 10 times 180^circ). 5. Therefore, ( h times 180^circ = 10 times 180^circ ), hence ( h = 10 ). 6. The number of diagonals needed to form these triangles can be calculated as:    [    frac{3h - 12}{2} = frac{3 times 10 - 12}{2} = frac{30 - 12}{2} = frac{18}{2} = 9    ]    Here, ( 12 ) is subtracted because the 12 sides of the dodecagon are not included in the triangulation counting, and the division by 2 accounts for each diagonal being counted twice. 7. For the given regular 12-sided polygon ( S_{12} ):     - There are 5 types of diagonals, classified by how they partition the 12 vertices between the endpoints of the diagonal. Specifically, they can leave 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices on one side (denoted as ( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5 )). 8. A ( d_1 ) diagonal connects vertices separated by one vertex. Any triangulation of a polygon with ( n geq 5 ) sides must contain at least two ( d_1 ) diagonals.  Diagonal ( d_2 ):    - ( d_2 ) diagonals form quadrilaterals which cannot be further subdivided in such a way that all partitioned triangles maintain the required property. 9. The ( d_5 ) diagonal divides the dodecagon into two heptagons:    - An ( AG ) diagonal cannot be one of the partitioned triangle sides since it would require further subdivision in ways that introduce invalid diagonals like ( AD ) which is ( d_2 ).  Analysis of Various ( d_i ) Types: 10. Diagonal ( d_4 ):     - It partitions the dodecagon into a hexagon ( ABCDEF ). Similar logic from previous steps can be applied to show how this hexagon will be further subdivided by other diagonals.     - Beginning with ( BAF ) and noting the divisions from ( B ) to ( D ) and ( F ), the vertices ( B, C, D, E ) belong to 3, 1, 3, 1 triangles respectively. Such partitioning respects the problem's requirements. 11. Diagonal ( d_3 ):     - ( d_3 ) diagonals leave six vertices on either side, leading naturally into acceptable partitions.     - Finally, using maximum allowable numbers of ( d_1, d_3, ) and ( d_4 ) types, one finds that ( d_4 ) diagonals should be at most two, ( d_3 ) at most three, and ( d_1 ) up to six.  Testing Configurations: 12. No configurations of fewer than these diagonals (like just one ( d_4 )) work due to creating non-partitionable shapes like octagons or invalid quadrilaterals. Ultimately, there are four possible ways to partition a regular dodecagon into triangles such that each vertex belongs to an odd number of triangles, marked by testing the allowable combinations of ( d_1, d_3, ) and ( d_4 ) diagonal types.

The Strong Foundation Plan mainly selects and cultivates students who are willing to serve the major strategic needs of the country and have excellent comprehensive qualities or excel in basic subjects. It is known that the written test of the Strong Foundation Plan is independently set by pilot universities, and candidates can only enter the interview stage after passing the written test. It is known that University A and University B both have three exam subjects in the written test, and the passing probability for each subject is independent. If a candidate applies to University A, the probability of passing each subject is frac{1}{2}; if the candidate applies to University B, the passing probabilities for the three subjects are frac{1}{6}, frac{3}{5}, and m, where 0 < m < 1.

For University B, when m = frac{3}{5}, the probability of passing exactly one subject in the written test is: - Passing the first subject and failing the other two: frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^2. - Failing the first subject, passing the second, and failing the third or failing the first and third subjects but passing the second: frac{5}{6} times frac{3}{5} times frac{2}{5} times 2. - Adding these probabilities gives P(B) = frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^2 + frac{5}{6} times frac{3}{5} times frac{2}{5} times 2 = frac{64}{150} = frac{32}{75}. Thus, the probability that the candidate applying to University A and University B will pass exactly one subject in the written test is boxed{frac{3}{8}} for University A and boxed{frac{32}{75}} for University B.  Part 2: For University A: - The number of subjects passed follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 3 and p = frac{1}{2}. - The expected number of subjects passed is E(X) = np = 3 times frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}. For University B, the expected number of subjects passed, E(Y), can be calculated using the probabilities of passing 0, 1, 2, or 3 subjects: - P(Y=0) = frac{5}{6} times frac{2}{5} times (1-m) = frac{1-m}{3}. - P(Y=1) = frac{1}{6} times frac{2}{5} times (1-m) + frac{5}{6} times frac{3}{5} times (1-m) + frac{5}{6} times frac{2}{5} times m = frac{17-7m}{30}. - P(Y=2) = frac{1}{6} times frac{3}{5} times (1-m) + frac{1}{6} times frac{2}{5} times m + frac{5}{6} times frac{3}{5} times m = frac{3+14m}{30}. - P(Y=3) = frac{1}{6} times frac{3}{5} times m = frac{m}{10}.

To prefer University A over University B based on the mathematical expectation of the number of subjects passed, we require E(Y) < E(X), which leads to frac{23}{30} + m < frac{3}{2}.

With a = 4 and c = 2sqrt{3}, we can now determine:    - The length of the major axis is 2a = 2 times 4 = 8.    - The focal length, which is 2c = 2 times 2sqrt{3} = 4sqrt{3}.    - The coordinates of the foci, which are along the major axis (since a > b), are given by (±c, 0) = (±2sqrt{3}, 0), not (0, ±2sqrt{3}).    - The eccentricity of the ellipse is frac{c}{a} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Therefore, the correct conclusions about the ellipse are that the length of the major axis is 8, the focal length is 4sqrt{3}, and the eccentricity is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. The coordinates of the foci are incorrectly described in option C. Hence, the correct choices are A, B, and D.

Thus, ( n = 4 ) is a solution with ( k = 1 ) and ( ell = 1 ). 7. **Subcase: ( n ) is a product of distinct primes.**    - Let ( n = 2p ), where ( p ) is an odd prime.    - We have:      [      varphi(2p) = 2p left(1 - frac{1}{2}right)left(1 - frac{1}{p}right) = p-1      ]    - Substituting into the equation, we get:      [      p-1 = 2(2p)^{ell - 2k}      ]    - This equation must hold for some ( k ) and ( ell ).

Hence, ( n ) must be even. 3. **Chromatic Index of ( K_{2n} ):**    - The chromatic index of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the edges so that no two adjacent edges share the same color.    - For the complete graph ( K_{2n} ) (with ( 2n ) vertices), the chromatic index is ( 2n-1 ). 4. **Coloring ( K_{2n-1} ):**    - Consider the vertices of ( K_{2n-1} ) as ( v_0, v_1, ldots, v_{2n-2} ).    - Color the edge ( v_i v_j ) with color ( (i + j) mod (2n-1) ).    - Each vertex ( v_i ) will be missing exactly one color, say ( c_i ). 5. **Adding the ( 2n )-th Vertex:**    - Add the ( 2n )-th vertex ( v_{2n-1} ).    - Color the edge ( v_{2n-1} v_i ) with the missing color ( c_i ) for each ( i ). 6. **Verification:**    - Each vertex ( v_i ) (for ( i in {0, 1, ldots, 2n-2} )) will have edges colored with all colors from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ).    - The new vertex ( v_{2n-1} ) will also have edges colored with all colors from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ).

We'll treat each distribution scenario separately and sum the possibilities. Firstly, we determine the configurations by the number of people in each room: 1. (1, 1, 1, 1, 1): All friends in separate rooms. 2. (1, 1, 1, 2): One room with 2 friends, the others with 1. 3. (2, 2, 1): Two rooms with 2 friends each, and one room with 1 friend.  Let's analyze each configuration:  Configuration (1, 1, 1, 1, 1): 1. There are 5 choices for the first friend. 2. There are 4 choices for the second friend. 3. There are 3 choices for the third friend. 4. There are 2 choices for the fourth friend. 5. The last friend goes into the last remaining room. So, the number of ways to distribute the friends is: [ 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120 ]  Configuration (1, 1, 1, 2): 1. Select the room that will accommodate 2 friends, which can be done in 5 ways. 2. Among the remaining 4 rooms, select one to stay empty (since the hotel only holds 5 friends total in these 5 rooms). This can be done in 4 ways. 3. To select the 2 friends who will share the room (since the order does not matter), choose 2 friends out of 5, which can be done in (binom{5}{2} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10) ways. 4. Now, distribute the remaining 3 friends in the 3 rooms:    [ 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 ] So, the total number of ways to distribute friends in this configuration is: [ 5 times 4 times 10 times 6 = 1200 ]  Configuration (2, 2, 1): 1. Choose the room that will have 1 friend, which can be done in 5 ways. 2. Out of the remaining 4 rooms, select 2 that will have 2 friends each. The number of ways to do this can be calculated as follows:    [ binom{4}{2} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6 ] 3. To place the 2 friends in the first room, choose 2 friends out of 5, in (binom{5}{2} = 10) ways. 4.

We need to determine if these products can be the numbers (1, 2, ldots, 100) in some order. 2. **Applying McDougall's Theorem:**    The theorem states that for (2n) cyclically ordered points on a circle, if (R_i) is the product of the distances from point (P_i) to all other points, then:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{R_{2i}} = sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{R_{2i-1}}    ]    Here, (n = 50) since we have 100 points. 3. **Assumption and Splitting:**    Assume that such a set of 100 points exists. Then, the products of distances can be split into two sets (A) and (B) each containing 50 elements such that:    [    sum_{a in A} frac{1}{a} = sum_{b in B} frac{1}{b}    ] 4. **Contradiction by Considering (v_{97}):**    To show that this is impossible, consider the (v_{97}) valuation (the exponent of 97 in the prime factorization) of both sides. Since 97 is a prime number greater than 50, it can only appear in the product of distances if it is one of the numbers in the set ({1, 2, ldots, 100}). However, the sum of the reciprocals of these numbers cannot be equal when split into two sets of 50 elements each, as the distribution of prime factors would not allow for such an equality. 5. **Conclusion:**    Since it is impossible to split the numbers ({1, 2, ldots, 100}) into two sets of 50 elements each with equal sums of reciprocals, the initial assumption that such a set of 100 points exists must be false.

The hare needs to cover the same distance as the turtle plus the 18 feet head start to finish in a tie. Since they finish at the same time, we can set up the following equation where ( T ) is the time in seconds it takes for the hare to finish the race after it starts: [ 10T = L ] [ 1(T + 18) = L ] Since both expressions equal ( L ), we can set them equal to each other: [ 10T = 1(T + 18) ] Now, we solve for ( T ): [ 10T = T + 18 ] [ 10T - T = 18 ] [ 9T = 18 ] [ T = frac{18}{9} ] [ T = 2 ] The hare takes 2 seconds to finish the race after it starts.

Since 3/5 of the players are throwers, we can calculate this number as follows: Number of throwers = (3/5) * 120 players = 72 players Now, we know that the rest of the team consists of batters and all-rounders. The number of these players is the total number of players minus the number of throwers: Number of batters and all-rounders = Total players - Number of throwers Number of batters and all-rounders = 120 players - 72 players = 48 players Out of these 48 players, 2/7 are left-handed. Let's find out how many that is: Number of left-handed players = (2/7) * 48 players = 13.714... ≈ 14 players (since we can't have a fraction of a player, we'll round to the nearest whole number) The rest of the batters and all-rounders are right-handed.

However, a quicker method involves comparing the coefficients of x and y in both equations directly. For the lines 3x+(lambda -1)y=1 and lambda x+(1-lambda)y=2 to be parallel, the ratio of the coefficients of x to y in both equations must be equal.

A: Certain event B: Uncertain event C: Impossible event D: Random eve","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to understand what the absolute value represents and how it relates to real numbers.  1. **Understanding Absolute Value**: The absolute value of a number, denoted as |a|, represents the distance of that number from 0 on the number line. This distance is always non-negative because distance cannot be negative. 2. **Applying the Concept to Real Numbers**: Given that a is a real number, we apply the concept of absolute value to a. Regardless of whether a is positive, negative, or zero, the distance from 0 (which is what |a| measures) is always a non-negative number. 3. **Analyzing the Inequality**: The statement |a| geqslant 0 is essentially saying that the absolute value of a is greater than or equal to 0. This is inherently true for all real numbers because, as established, the absolute value (distance from 0) cannot be negative. 4. **Conclusion**: Since the statement |a| geqslant 0 holds true for all real numbers due to the nature of absolute values, it is a certainty.

The total parts of the mixture are 3 (milk) + 1 (water) = 4 parts. Since the total mixture is 20 litres, each part is equal to 20 litres / 4 parts = 5 litres. So, in the original mixture: - Milk is 3 parts, which is 3 * 5 litres = 15 litres. - Water is 1 part, which is 1 * 5 litres = 5 litres. Now, we are adding 5 litres of milk to the mixture. The new amount of milk will be 15 litres (original) + 5 litres (added) = 20 litres. The amount of water remains the same, which is 5 litres. The new ratio of milk to water is 20 litres of milk : 5 litres of water.

The negation of this condition is that for every x in the interval (-infty, t], we have f(x) > 0.

The vertices of the hexagon may or may not lie in the same plane.  1. **Define the Hexagon and Conditions**:    Consider a hexagon (ABCDEF) with vertices such that the vertices (A, C, E) lie on a straight line, but are not consecutive. Specifically, we place (A, C, E) on the line (l_1), i.e., they are collinear. 2. **Identify Midpoints**:    Denote the midpoints of opposite sides of the hexagon by (M, N, P, Q, R, S):    - ( M ) is the midpoint of side ( AB )    - ( N ) is the midpoint of side ( DE )    - ( P ) is the midpoint of side ( BC )    - ( Q ) is the midpoint of side ( EF )    - ( R ) is the midpoint of side ( CD )    - ( S ) is the midpoint of side ( FA ) 3. **Construct Midline Connections**:    Draw the lines (MQ) (connecting (M) and (Q)), (NP) (connecting (N) and (P)), and (RS) (connecting (R) and (S)). 4. **Use the Concurrence Property in Polygons**:    According to Varignon's Theorem, the lines joining midpoints of opposite sides of any hexagon (both planar and non-planar) meet at a single point. This point is often referred to as the centroid. 5. **Application of Varignon's Theorem**:    In this scenario, by placing points (A, C, E) on a line, we observe that lines (MQ, NP, RS) still form corresponding diagonals of a figure within the hexagon. By Varignon's Theorem and symmetry in the partial process of midline connections, the lines (MQ), (NP), and (RS) will indeed intersect at a common point. 6. **Prove Concurrency**:    The intersection point, verified by geometric properties (like symmetry, parallelograms formed), remains consistent whether in 2D plane or projected in 3D space:        - Since (A, C, E) are collinear, the lines show a clear symmetrical balance distributing equally through midpoints.    - Being non-consecutive and in the line, opposing midpoints naturally attract convergence due to equal partition balancing weights (2:1). # Conclusion: Thus, the straight lines connecting the midpoints of the opposite sides of the hexagon are concurrent.

Without loss of generality, assume (x_1 leq x_2 leq cdots leq x_s leq x_{s+1}). From the inductive hypothesis, we know (frac{1}{x_1} + frac{1}{x_2} + cdots + frac{1}{x_s}) accounts for part of the fraction sum. Hence,    [    frac{s+1}{x_1} geq u implies x_1 leq frac{s+1}{u}.    ]    Thus, (x_1) can take on only a limited number of possible positive integer values. 5. Fix (x_1), and let (y = u - frac{1}{x_1}). By the inductive hypothesis, the equation:    [    frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_3} + cdots + frac{1}{x_s} + frac{1}{x_{s+1}} = y    ]    must have a solution in positive integers for (x_2, x_3, cdots, x_s, x_{s+1}). Since (x_1) can only take on finitely many values as established, the finite number of choices for (x_1) ensures that:    [    frac{1}{x_2} + frac{1}{x_3} + cdots + frac{1}{x_s} + frac{1}{x_{s+1}} = y    ]    also has finitely many positive integer solutions. 6. By induction, we have proved that for every rational (w) and for every positive integer (s), the equation ( frac{1}{x_{1}} + frac{1}{x_{2}} + cdots + frac{1}{x_{s}} = w ) has a finite number of positive integer solutions. Therefore, the original equation ( frac{1}{x_{1}} + frac{1}{x_{2}} + cdots + frac{1}{x_{s}} = 1 ) also has a finite number of positive integer solutions.

The perimeter (P) of a square is given by the formula P = 4s, where s is the side length. P = 4s P = 4 * 156 P = 624 m The perimeter of the square field is 624 meters. If the wire needs to go around the field 13 times, we multiply the perimeter by 13 to find the total length of the wire required. Length of wire = Perimeter * Number of times Length of wire = 624 m * 13 Length of wire = 8112 m Therefore, the length of the wire needed to go around the square field 13 times is boxed{8112}  meters."},{"instruction":"Jesse is playing with a pile of building blocks.

For what maximum N is this possible?","output":":  We need to determine the largest possible number ( N ) of points that can be placed on a plane such that any three of these points form a triangle whose angles in degrees are natural numbers. 1. **Demonstrating that ( N = 180 ) is possible**:     Consider placing 180 points on the circumference of a circle, with each point dividing the circle into arcs of ( 2^circ ) each.     The measure of any arc with endpoints on two marked points is expressed by an even number of degrees. Consequently, the measure of any inscribed angle formed by three points on this circle can be expressed as a fraction of the circle, leading to angles whose sizes are natural numbers.      Therefore, 180 points marked on the circle meet the problem's condition. The angles inside any triangle formed by these points are natural numbers. 2. **Proof that ( N leq 180 )**:     Suppose we have ( N ) points on the plane such that any three points form a triangle with angles measured in natural numbers.           - If ( N > 180 ), we show that at least one angle must be less than ( 1^circ ), leading to a contradiction.      - Consider any point ( A ) among the marked points that has the maximum ordinate (assuming we work on a Cartesian plane).     - Let ( B ) and ( C ) be two other points such that the angle ( angle BAC ) is maximized.     Since the angles within any triangle formed by our chosen points must be natural numbers:     - The angles ( angle ABC ) and ( angle ACB ) are at least ( 1^circ ) each.     - Therefore, the angle ( angle BAC ) must be at most ( 178^circ ).     Now consider the remaining ( N - 3 ) points. These must lie strictly inside the angle ( angle BAC ) (since every point not coinciding with the vertices of angle ( angle BAC ) must form a triangle with ( A ), ( B ), and ( C )). In this case, creating new rays from ( A ) through each remaining point, we create ( N - 2 ) sub-angles dividing ( angle BAC ).     If ( N-2 > 178 ), at least one of these sub-angles must measure less than ( 1^circ ). This contradicts the requirement that all angles are natural numbers. Hence, ( N - 2 leq 178 ), leading to:     [     N leq 180      ]     Therefore, the maximum number of points ( N ) satisfying the given conditions is 180.

This gives us 2! = 2 possibilities. We can represent this as:    [    text{Coach-A or A-Coach} = 2    ] 2. **Arranging the 5 People in the Middle**: For the five people in the middle, we consider two cases based on the conditions given:        - **Case 1**: B and C are adjacent and also adjacent to D. This means we treat B and C as a single unit, and since they must be adjacent to D, we treat B, C, and D as a single unit. This leaves us with 3 units (BCD, E, F) to arrange, which can be done in 3! = 6 ways. However, within the BCD unit, B and C can switch places, giving us an additional 2! = 2 arrangements. Therefore, the total for this case is:      [      3! times 2! = 6 times 2 = 12      ]    - **Case 2**: B and C are adjacent but not adjacent to D. In this scenario, we treat B and C as a single unit separate from D, E, and F. This gives us 4 units to arrange, which can be done in 4! = 24 ways. However, we only need to arrange the 3 units excluding D (since B and C cannot be next to D), which gives us 3! = 6 ways. Within the BC unit, B and C can switch places, giving us 2! = 2 arrangements. Therefore, the total for this case is:      [      3! times 2! = 6 times 2 = 12      ]      But, considering the positions of D, which can be in any of the 2 spots not next to BC in the 4-unit arrangement, we get:      [      12 times 2 = 24      ] 3. **Total Arrangements**: Adding the arrangements from both cases for the 5 people in the middle, we get:    [    12 + 24 = 36    ]    Since there are 2 ways to position the coach and A at the ends, the total number of arrangements is:    [    2 times 36 = 72    ] Therefore, the total number of ways the 7 people can be arranged, following all the given conditions, is boxed{72}.

We aim to find a suitable function ( f ) that adheres to this condition. 2. **First Step in Simplifying the Function:**    Set ( y = x ) and ( a = b = frac{c}{2} ).

We have:    [    f(x) = k^{1/ln x}    ]    and need to check that:    [    f(x^a y^b) = k^{1/ln(x^a y^b)} = k^{1/(a ln x + b ln y)}    ]    satisfies:    [    f(x^a y^b) leq f(x)^{1/(4a)} f(y)^{1/(4b)}    ]     7. **Applying Harmonic Mean Inequality:**    Note the structure when ( f(x) = k^{1/ln x} ):    [    frac{1}{a ln x + b ln y} leq frac{1}{4a ln x} + frac{1}{4b ln y}    ]    Applying the harmonic mean inequality:    [    frac{2}{frac{1}{a ln x} + frac{1}{b ln y}} leq frac{a ln x + b ln y}{2}    ]    which simplifies correctly and thus supports our required inequality. # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the function: [ f(x) = k^{1/ln x} ] satisfies the given condition.

The manager picks a candidate at random, and the odds they know Excel and are willing to work nights are 6%, or 0.06. The probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. In this case, the probability of a candidate knowing Excel (0.20) and being willing to work nights (let's call this ( N )) is 0.06. So we have: [ 0.20 times N = 0.06 ] To find ( N ), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.20: [ N = frac{0.06}{0.20} ] [ N = 0.30 ] This means that 30% of the candidates are willing to work nights. Since some candidates are willing to work nights and some only during the day, the percentage of candidates willing to work only during the day would be the remaining percentage out of 100%.

During the first class, split them into three teams, say Team 1, Team 2, and Team 3, each consisting of 10 students. 3. Select any one team, say Team 1, for convenience. 4. On the second class, these 10 students must again be divided into three teams. By the Pigeonhole Principle, one of the teams (let's denote this Team A) must contain at least lceil frac{10}{3} rceil = 4 students. 5. Let’s now focus on these 4 students from Team A. On the third class, they will again be divided into three teams. Using the Pigeonhole Principle again, one of these teams (denote this Team B) must contain at least lceil frac{4}{3} rceil = 2 students. 6. The two students in Team B must have been together in every class (first, second, and third) as they originated from Team 1 on the first class and stayed together in the same subset through to Team B. Hence, we have shown there are at least two students who were in the same team for three consecutive classes. This completes the first solution: # 2: 1. Enumerate the teams in terms of classes using digits 1, 2, and 3. For each position in the team across three classes, denote them as triples (x, y, z) where  x, y, z in {1, 2, 3} . 2. Calculate the number of possible unique triples:     [     3 times 3 times 3 = 27     ] 3. Notice that there are 30 students. By the Pigeonhole Principle, since 30 players need to fit into only 27 distinct positions (triples), at least two students must share the same triple. 4. Therefore, these two students were part of the same team for all three classes, confirming our statement. Using either of these methods, we have demonstrated that at least two students will be in the same team for three consecutive classes.

Assign a unit mass to each vertex of the polygon. 2. Consider what happens under a symmetry transformation with respect to an axis of symmetry:     - Under symmetry transformation with respect to an axis, the polygon maps onto itself.     - Therefore, the system of points (vertices with unit masses) must also map onto itself. 3. The center of mass of this system of points must also map onto itself under such a symmetry transformation. Since the center of mass is invariant under the symmetry transformation, it must lie on the axis of symmetry. 4. Now, consider another axis of symmetry of the polygon. The center of mass must also lie on this second axis for the same reasons. 5. By the properties of the center of mass and multiple symmetries:     - If the center of mass lies on two different axes of symmetry, those axes must intersect at the center of mass. Therefore, the center of mass must be the intersection point of all axes of symmetry. 6. This implies that all axes of symmetry intersect at a single point, which is the center of mass of the system of points (vertices with unit masses).

Formally, if (X) is a point with respect to circles (o_1) and (o_2), the power with respect to these circles is given by:    [    P(X, omega_1) = P(X, omega_2)    ] 2. **Power of a Point Definition**:    The power of a point (P) with respect to a circle with center (O) and radius (r) can be written as:    [    P(P, omega) = OP^2 - r^2    ]    Where (O) is the center of the circle and (OP) is the distance from the point (P) to the center (O) of the circle. 3. **Intersections and Radical Axis**:    Let the two intersecting circles be (omega_1) and (omega_2), with centers (O_1) and (O_2), and radii (r_1) and (r_2), respectively. Assume that the circles intersect at points (A) and (B). 4. **Power of Intersection Points**:    Consider point (A). The power of point (A) with respect to circle (omega_1) is:    [    P(A, omega_1) = O_1A^2 - r_1^2    ]    Similarly, the power of point (A) with respect to circle (omega_2) is:    [    P(A, omega_2) = O_2A^2 - r_2^2    ] 5. **Equal Powers at Intersection**:    Since point (A) lies on both circles (omega_1) and (omega_2), it satisfies:    [    O_1A^2 = r_1^2 quad text{and} quad O_2A^2 = r_2^2    ]    Therefore,    [    P(A, omega_1) = P(A, omega_2) = 0    ]    This implies that point (A) lies on the radical axis of the circles (omega_1) and (omega_2). 6. **Second Intersection Point**:    Similarly, for point (B), we have:    [    P(B, omega_1) = B_1B^2 - r_1^2 = 0    ]    [    P(B, omega_2) = B_2B^2 - r_2^2 = 0    ]    Thus, point (B) also lies on the radical axis of the circles (omega_1) and (omega_2). 7. **Conclusion**:    Since both points of intersection (A) and (B) lie on the radical axis, we conclude that the radical axis of two intersecting circles passes through their points of intersection.

Again, this follows from the properties of cyclic angles where both angles subtend the chord MC.    - Similarly, because D and B both lie on circle S_2, we have angle MDC = angle MAB.     5. **Quadrilateral Formation:**    - We now see that angles angle CAM = angle MCB and because AC parallel BD by construction and discussion above, quadrilateral ABCD is indeed a parallelogram. 6. **Property of Diagonals in Parallelogram:**    - One well-known property of a parallelogram is that its diagonals bisect each other.

So, ln(256) = ln(2^8) = 8 * ln(2). The value of ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. Therefore, ln(256) ≈ 8 * 0.6931 ≈ 5.5448.

For example, ( d(1) = 1 ), ( d(10) = 1 ), ( d(99) = 18 ). 2. **Sum of digits for a range**: Define ( C_k = sum_{n=k}^{k+999} d(n) ). This represents the sum of the digits of 1000 consecutive integers starting from ( k ). 3. **Calculate ( C_0 )**: Notice that ( C_0 ) is the sum of the digits of the first 1000 non-negative integers (from 0 to 999). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 100 times in each decimal place (units, tens, hundreds) within this range. Therefore, the sum of the digits for each decimal place is:    [    0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + 9 = 45    ]    Since there are 3 decimal places (units, tens, hundreds), the total sum is:    [    3 times 100 times 45 = 13500    ]    Thus, ( C_0 = 13500 ). 4. **Incremental changes in ( C_k )**: Notice that ( C_1 ) is just ( C_0 ) with ( d(0) ) replaced by ( d(1000) ). Since ( d(1000) = 1 ), the sum increases by 1. More generally, for ( k < 1000 ), moving from ( C_k ) to ( C_{k+1} ) involves replacing ( d(k) ) with ( d(1000 + k) ), which is ( d(k) + 1 ).

Consider ( m > log_{10}(k) ) and look at ( d = k + 10^m ). The sum ( C_d ) is just all the numbers used for ( C_k ) with an additional 1 before each number, totaling an additional value of 1000. Therefore, ( C_d = C_k + 1000 ). 7. **Conclusion**: By the lemma, starting from 13500, we can reach any value of the form ( 13500 + 1000n ) for ( n geq 0 ).

Given that an asymptote of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 is perpendicular to the line l: x - 2y - 5 = 0, we can deduce that the slope of the asymptote is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line l, which means frac{b}{a} = 2. Using the Pythagorean relation of the hyperbola c^2 = a^2 + b^2, we can substitute c=5 and frac{b}{a} = 2 into the equation to solve for a^2 and b^2: Since frac{b}{a} = 2, it implies b = 2a. We now have c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + (2a)^2 = a^2 + 4a^2 = 5a^2. We know that c=5, so we can write this as 5^2 = 5a^2 or 25 = 5a^2, which gives a^2 = 5. To find b^2, we use the relationship b = 2a, which gives b^2 = (2a)^2 = 4a^2. Since a^2 = 5, we obtain b^2 = 4 cdot 5 = 20.

After 15 days, the provisions left would be enough to feed ( M ) men for ( 54 - 15 = 39 ) days. So, the remaining provisions at that point would be ( M times 39 ) man-days. Now, 600 men join the garrison, making the total number of men ( M + 600 ). After the reinforcement, the provisions are found to last for only 30 more days. This means the remaining provisions can feed ( M + 600 ) men for 30 days. We can express the remaining provisions after the reinforcement as ( (M + 600) times 30 ) man-days.

Therefore, (D) cannot be (3). 7. **Case II: (D = 37)**    - We need (37) to divide all six numbers. Consider the difference:      [      overline{(A+1)CB} - overline{ABC} = (100A + 100 + 10C + B) - (100A + 10B + C) = 100 + 9C - 9B      ]      [      100 + 9(C - B) equiv 0 pmod{37}      ]      [      9(C - B) equiv -100 pmod{37}      ]      [      9(C - B) equiv -26 pmod{37}      ]      [      9(C - B) equiv 11 pmod{37}      ]      Since (9) and (37) are coprime, we can solve for (C - B):      [      C - B equiv 9^{-1} cdot 11 pmod{37}      ]      The modular inverse of (9) modulo (37) is (9), so:      [      C - B equiv 9 cdot 11 pmod{37}      ]      [      C - B equiv 99 pmod{37}      ]      [      C - B equiv 25 pmod{37}      ]      This gives us possible pairs ((B, C)) such that (C = B + 25). Since (B) and (C) are digits, we need to check valid pairs. 8. **Case III: (D = 111)**    - Similar to Case I, we find that (D = 111) leads to contradictions in the divisibility conditions.

Then, the number in each cell is replaced by the product of the numbers in all adjacent cells (those with a common edge). Is it possible, after a finite number of transformations, to make all the numbers in the grid equal to 1?","output":"1. **Initial Setup**:    First, we consider the transformation given in the problem: each number in a grid cell is replaced by the product of all the numbers in the cells that are adjacent to it (including orthogonally adjacent cells). We need to determine whether it is possible to transform all the numbers in a 9 times 9 grid to 1 after a finite number of such transformations. 2. **Understanding the Transformation**:    Let's analyze what this transformation does. If initially each cell contains either 1 or -1, the result of the product in surrounding cells will depend on the parity (even or odd) of the number of -1s in the adjacent cells:        - If an even number of adjacent cells contain -1, the product will be 1.    - If an odd number of adjacent cells contain -1, the product will be -1. 3. **Invariant Analysis**:    Consider a smaller grid, such as 4 times 4, and examine whether its pattern of 1s and -1s can become entirely 1s through the described process. 4. **Example Grid**:    Suppose we start with a 4 times 4 grid where the central cells are 1s:    [    begin{bmatrix}    x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} & x_{14}     x_{21} & 1      & 1      & x_{24}     x_{31} & 1      & 1      & x_{34}     x_{41} & x_{42} & x_{43} & x_{44}    end{bmatrix}    ]    Let's perform the transformation for a few iterations and see if the values in the matrix change. Recall that the cells in row 2 and row 3, column 2 and column 3 are already filled with 1s. We notice that this structure remains unchanged because:        - If an adjacent 1s are multiplied together, they remain 1.    - Surrounding the central 1s with appropriate values to keep them as 1s doesn't change their state. 5. **Larger Grid Generalization**:    Now consider the original 9 times 9 grid and apply the same logic:    - Fill the central row and central column with 1s, thereby dividing the grid into four 4 times 4 sub-grids with central intersection being 1s.    - Each of these 4 times 4 sub-grids has their central cells filled with 1s, making them invariant under the transformation. 6. **Observation**:    Each 4 times 4 sub-grid remains unchanged because the core pattern of 1s does not affect the transformation when surrounded appropriately. Hence, the central 1s force these sub-grid structures to stabilize. # Conclusion:    It is not possible that after a finite number of transformations, all numbers in the 9 times 9 grid will become 1. The invariance observed in the smaller sub-grids counteracts the possibility of complete convergence to 1s.

We can then write the following equation: D = E / 2 Since Donna and Emily's bananas together total 297, we can also write: D + E = 297 Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get: E / 2 + E = 297 Combining like terms, we get: 1.5E = 297 Now, we can solve for E: E = 297 / 1.5 E = 198 Now that we know Emily has 198 bananas, we can find out how many bananas Donna has by using the equation D = E / 2: D = 198 / 2 D = 99 So, Donna has 99 bananas, and Emily has 198 bananas.

The n-th hop is of length F_n, where F_1 = F_2 = 1 and F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} for n geq 3. The first two hops are perpendicular. We need to prove that Bugs Bunny can never return to the starting point. 2. **Assume the Least Number of Steps N:**    Let N be the least number of steps for which Bugs Bunny can return to the starting point. We will show that such an N leads to a contradiction. 3. **Partition the Hops into Directions:**    Consider the north/south and east/west directions separately. We partition the first N terms of the Fibonacci sequence into two pairs of subsets, A_1, B_1 and A_2, B_2, where operatorname{sum}(A_i) = operatorname{sum}(B_i) for i = 1, 2. 4. **Analyze the Subsets:**    Assume F_N in A_1.

Hence, ( {x_1} + {x_2} = 0 ), which meets the requirement.    - If ( x_2 < 1 ), denote ( left[x_1right] = s ). Thus, ( x_1 < s + 1 ).            Therefore,      [{x_1} + {x_2} = x_1 + x_2 - s = x_1 + frac{1}{x_1} - s.]            This implies:      [< (s + 1) + frac{1}{s + 1} - s leq 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}.] 5.

Before they start, Sydney has 837 rocks and Conner has 723.  On day one, Sydney collects 4 rocks while Conner collects 8 times as many, but he accidentally breaks half of the rocks he collects.  On day two, Sydney decides to rest and watches a movie that inspires her to donate 10% of her collection to a museum. Conner collects rocks at an exponential rate, doubling his day one collection and then accidentally dropping 7 of them.  On the third day, Sydney collects twice as many as Conner did after the day one mishap.

Her new total is 841 - 84 = 757 rocks. - Conner doubles his day one collection and then drops 7: 16 * 2 = 32, 32 - 7 = 25, so 739 + 25 = 764 rocks. **Day Three:** - Sydney collects twice as many as Conner did after the day one mishap: 2 * 16 = 32 rocks, so 757 + 32 = 789 rocks. - Conner gives away 25% of his remaining day two collection: 25% of 25 is 6.25, but since we can't have a fraction of a rock, he gives away 6 rocks. His new total is 764 - 6 = 758 rocks. **Day Four:** - Sydney collects three times as many as she did on day three and damages 5: 3 * 32 = 96, 96 - 5 = 91, so 789 + 91 = 880 rocks. - Conner collects 1.5 times the rocks he had on day two but loses 9: 1.5 * 25 = 37.5, which we round to 38, 38 - 9 = 29, so 758 + 29 = 787 rocks. **Day Five:** - Sydney collects rocks equal to the cube root of her day four collection: The cube root of 880 is about 9.57, which we round to 10 rocks, so 880 + 10 = 890 rocks. - Conner collects one more than the square root of his day one collection: The square root of 32 is about 5.66, which we round to 6, plus one is 7, so 787 + 7 = 794 rocks. To find out how many rocks Conner needs to collect as an additional bonus on day five to at least tie Sydney, we subtract his final total from Sydney's final total: 890 (Sydney's total) - 794 (Conner's total) = 96 rocks.

Determine whether the distance from O to line l is a constant value. If it is, find this value; if not, explain the reason.","output":"(1) By the definition of an ellipse, we know that |PF_1| + |PF_2| = 2a. Given that |PF_1| - |PF_2| = a, we have |PF_1| = frac{3}{2}a = 3|PF_2|. Then, sqrt{(2+c)^2 + 2} = 3sqrt{(2-c)^2 + 2}. Simplifying, we get c^2 - 5c + 6 = 0. Since c < a < 3, we have c=2. Then |PF_1| = 3sqrt{2} = frac{3}{2}a, implying that a = 2sqrt{2}. And b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 4, so the standard equation of the ellipse is frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1. (2) From the question, we know that line l does not pass through the origin. Let A be (x_1, y_1) and B be (x_2, y_2). Case 1: When line l perp x-axis, the equation of line l is x = m (m neq 0 and -2sqrt{2} < m < 2sqrt{2}). Then, x_1 = m, y_1 = sqrt{4 - frac{m^2}{2}}, x_2 = m, and y_2 = -sqrt{4 - frac{m^2}{2}}. Since overrightarrow{OA} perp overrightarrow{OB}, we have x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0. This implies m^2 - (4 - frac{m^2}{2}) = 0, which gives m = pmfrac{2sqrt{6}}{3}. So, the equation of line l is x = pmfrac{2sqrt{6}}{3}, and the distance d from origin O to line l is frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}. Case 2: When the slope of line AB exists, let the equation of line AB be y = kx + n. Solving the system of equations frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 and y = kx + n, we can eliminate y and obtain: (1 + 2k^2)x^2 + 4knx + 2n^2 - 8 = 0. Then, x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4kn}{1 + 2k^2}, x_1x_2 = frac{2n^2 - 8}{1 + 2k^2}, and y_1y_2 = k^2x_1x_2 + kn(x_1 + x_2) + n^2 = frac{n^2 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2}. Since overrightarrow{OA} perp overrightarrow{OB}, we have x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0. This gives frac{2n^2 - 8}{1 + 2k^2} + frac{n^2 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2} = 0, which simplifies to 3n^2 - 8k^2 - 8 = 0. So, 3n^2 = 8k^2 + 8, and the distance d from origin O to line l is given by d = frac{|n|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}}. Squaring both sides, we get d^2 = frac{n^2}{1 + k^2} = frac{3n^2}{3(1 + k^2)}. Substituting 3n^2 = 8k^2 + 8, we obtain d^2 = frac{8k^2 + 8}{3(1 + k^2)} = frac{8}{3}. Therefore, d = frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}. In conclusion, the distance from point O to line l is a constant value of boxed{frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}}."},{"instruction":"f a  b = 3 and a ( power 2 ) + b ( power 2 ) = 29 , find the value of ab .","output":"Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

Consider the intersection of BA_2 and CA_1, which is denoted as point D. 2. **Important Intersection Properties**: Note the following intersection properties:     - T_B intersects BA at A_1.     - T_C intersects CA at A_2. 3. **Aim**: We need to demonstrate that the lines AB with T_B T_A, BC with T_C T_B, and AC with T_C T_A are concurrent. 4. **Incenter and Concurrent lines**: Recognize that the three lines mentioned (A T_A, B T_B, C T_C) intersect at the incenter I of triangle ABC. 5. **Use of Desargues' Theorem**: Desargues' Theorem states that if two triangles are such that their corresponding sides intersect on a line (called the axis of perspectivity), then the extensions of corresponding vertices of these triangles are concurrent at a point (called the center of perspectivity). This can be applied to triangle ABC and triangle T_A T_B T_C. 6. **Application in the Given Problem**: Since A T_A, B T_B, and C T_C all intersect at the incenter I, this means there exists a perspective position between triangle ABC and triangle T_A T_B T_C with the incenter as the center of perspectivity. 7. **Conclusion from Desargues’ Theorem**: Given these conditions, we can conclude that the lines AB with T_B T_A, BC with T_C T_B, and AC with T_C T_A must intersect at a common line. Thus, we have shown that the intersections (common points) with these lines and the described triangular segments define concurrent points neatly aligning with Desargues' Theorem, hence showing the geometric relationships are consistent and the intersections described are established based on the properties of triangle ABC and triangle T_A T_B T_C.

Now, rearrange the equation to solve for z: z - i = sqrt{5} implies z = sqrt{5} + i. The complex number z can be written in the form z = a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. In this case, a = sqrt{5} and b = 1. The point corresponding to the complex number z on the complex plane is (sqrt{5}, 1). The point (sqrt{5}, 1) is located in the first quadrant of the complex plane because both a (the real part) and b (the imaginary part) are positive. Therefore, the complex number z satisfying the given condition is located in the **first quadrant**. [boxed{A}]"},{"instruction":"doubled the length of each corner of a cubeshaped box. How many times bigger will the surface area of this box become?","output":"Let's assume the original length of each side of the cube-shaped box is \\"a\\".  The surface area of the original cube is 6a^2 because a cube has 6 faces and the area of each face is a^2. If you double the length of each corner, you are essentially doubling the length of each side of the cube. So the new length of each side becomes 2a. The surface area of the new cube with side length 2a is 6(2a)^2. Simplifying this gives us 6 * 4a^2, which is 24a^2. To find out how many times bigger the new surface area is compared to the old surface area, we divide the new surface area by the old surface area: 24a^2 / 6a^2 = 4 So, the surface area of the box will become boxed{4}  times bigger."},{"instruction":"Given that the distribution of the random variable X is expressed as P(X=i) = frac{i}{2a} for i=1, 2, 3, find the value of a.","output":"The random variable X has a distribution given by P(X=i) = frac{i}{2a}. Since the probabilities must sum up to 1 for all possible values of i, we can write: sum_{i=1}^{3} P(X=i) = frac{1}{2a} + frac{2}{2a} + frac{3}{2a} = 1. To solve for a, we can combine the fractions: frac{1+2+3}{2a} = 1. This simplifies to: frac{6}{2a} = 1. Multiplying both sides by 2a gives us: 6 = 2a. Dividing both sides by 2 yields: a = frac{6}{2}.
