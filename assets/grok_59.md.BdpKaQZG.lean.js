While both of these websites share common features such as social networking, messaging, and media sharing, they differ in their approach and functionality. Firstly, Facebook is primarily used for connecting with friends and acquaintances. It offers a wider scope for communication with a larger user base. It allows users to share not only pictures, but also status updates, links, and even private messages. Facebook allows users to create pages, communities, and groups where people with similar interests can connect. It's also used for business purposes, and businesses use Facebook as a platform to reach millions of people worldwide. On the other hand, Instagram is a photo and video sharing app that allows users to share their pictures and videos with their followers. Unlike Facebook, it's more visual, and users can express themselves through pictures and videos. Instagram is widely used by celebrities, influencers, and content creators as a means of showcasing their talent and building their brand. This platform prioritizes visual aesthetics and highlights creativity through filters and editing tools. Furthermore, Facebook offers more privacy and security settings than Instagram. Facebook's privacy settings allow users to protect their personal information and restrict access to their personal profile. Instagram, on the other hand, is more open, and users can follow anyone they want. To make the account private on Instagram, users have to manually change the settings. In conclusion, Facebook and Instagram have different purposes as social networking sites. Facebook offers a wider scope for communication, while Instagram presents itself as a visual platform for showcasing talent and creativity. Users prefer Facebook for keeping up with family and friends, whereas Instagram has become a hub for creators, influencers, and businesses. Both websites have their advantages and disadvantages, but it's ultimately up to the user to decide which one is better suited for their needs."},{"instruction":"Rewrite the following sentence in firstperson point of view.

AI has become an increasingly important field in recent years, with the development and implementation of AI technology in various industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. One of the biggest benefits of AI is its ability to improve efficiency and accuracy in tasks performed by humans. For example, AI algorithms can process large amounts of data in a matter of seconds, something that would take humans days or even weeks to achieve. This can lead to significant time and cost savings across various industries. Another significant benefit of AI is its potential to improve healthcare. AI-powered systems can analyze large amounts of patient data and provide more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans than traditional methods. For example, AI algorithms can analyze medical images and identify patterns or abnormalities that human doctors may miss. This can help in early detection of diseases and improve patient outcomes. However, the increasing use of AI also brings up ethical and legal concerns. One major concern is the potential for AI systems to replace human jobs. With the increasing adoption of automation and AI, many jobs that were traditionally done by humans may become obsolete. This can lead to an increase in unemployment and loss of livelihoods for many people. Another ethical concern is related to the use of AI in military applications. The development and use of autonomous weapons, for example, has the potential to cause harm to innocent civilians and worsen conflicts. It is therefore important to establish ethical guidelines and regulations to prevent the misuse of AI technology. AI also raises concerns around privacy and data security. As AI systems become more sophisticated, they are able to collect and analyze massive amounts of data from individuals, raising concerns around the protection of personal information. It is important to establish clear guidelines and regulations around how this data is collected, stored, and used to ensure the protection of individuals' privacy. Despite these concerns, the potential benefits of AI cannot be ignored. With the right regulations and ethical guidelines in place, AI has the potential to improve our lives in many ways. It is important that we continue to invest in the development of AI technology and explore ways to use it ethically and responsibly."},{"instruction":"Create an analogy to illustrate a concept: Talent","output":"Talent is like a seed.

Medical imaging is a crucial diagnostic tool used by physicians to identify and diagnose various medical conditions. However, the human eye can only capture so much detail, and it is easy to miss important information. This is where computer vision comes in. Computer vision involves processing and analyzing digital images to extract useful information. In medical imaging, computer vision algorithms can analyze and identify patterns in images that would be difficult for human clinicians to identify. This technology can be used to improve accuracy and speed up the diagnostic process. One application of computer vision in medical imaging is in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Early detection is critical in treating lung cancer, and computer vision algorithms can help identify tumors in CT scan images. Researchers have also used computer vision to analyze x-rays to detect and diagnose other lung conditions like tuberculosis. Another area where computer vision is making an impact is in medical scans such as MRIs and CT scans. These scans can produce large volumes of data, making it challenging for human clinicians to interpret. However, machine learning algorithms can sort through the data to identify patterns and anomalies that could indicate medical conditions like tumors, brain injuries, and heart disease. Computer vision is also being used in medical imaging to identify skin conditions. In dermatology, skin images can be analyzed by computer vision algorithms to identify rashes, spots, and other skin conditions. This technology can help dermatologists prioritize patients who require urgent attention and provide more personalized treatment. In conclusion, computer vision is an exciting technology that has the potential to revolutionize the medical industry. By leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze medical images, this technology can improve diagnosis accuracy, speed up the diagnosis process, and provide more personalized treatment to patients. As advancements in computer vision continue, the possibilities for its use in medical imaging are endless."},{"instruction":"Edit the following sentence, I runs every morning.","output":"\\"I run every morning.\\""},{"instruction":"What are the characteristics of a successful business idea?","output":"The characteristics of a successful business idea include uniqueness, demand in the market, potential for growth, scalability, profitability, feasibility, and aligning with personal interests and skills."},{"instruction":"Write a story of friendship between two boys from different backgrounds.","output":"Two boys, Nick and Ahmed, lived worlds apart.

It is a tool that enables individuals to acquire knowledge, skills, and values necessary for personal growth, employment, and responsible citizenship. Education is a fundamental human right, and its importance cannot be overstated. In this essay, I will discuss the significance of education and why it is essential for the development of individuals and society as a whole. Firstly, education plays an essential role in shaping the minds of individuals. It equips individuals with knowledge and skills necessary to navigate through life, make informed decisions, and contribute to the betterment of society. Education facilitates personal development and enables individuals to live a fulfilling life. It is through education that people learn about the world, its history, and the various cultures that exist. This knowledge is vital as it enables individuals to interact with people from different backgrounds, respect diversity, and develop empathy. Moreover, Education is essential in providing individuals with the skills they need to be productive members of society. A good education system prepares individuals for work that requires specific skills, such as problem-solving, communication, and critical thinking. In today's fast-paced world, having these skills is essential for success in any profession. Furthermore, education provides opportunities for individuals to engage in meaningful work that contributes to the growth of society. This, in turn, builds a sense of purpose and fulfillment in the individual's life. Education is also essential in promoting economic growth and development. An educated population is key to a country's economic prosperity because it creates a skilled workforce. Education plays an integral part in reducing poverty and promoting social mobility. It offers individuals a chance to build better lives for themselves and their families, breaking the poverty cycle. An economically stable society can only be achieved when the majority of its population is educated and employed. In addition, education is a tool for promoting equality and social justice. It provides an avenue for individuals from marginalized backgrounds to attain equal opportunities as their privileged counterparts. Education creates a level playing field for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic background. It empowers individuals to overcome obstacles and realize their full potential. Moreover, education is essential in promoting social cohesion and reducing violence within society. When people are aware of and understand each other's cultures, they are more likely to live together harmoniously, promoting peace and stability. Finally, education is a fundamental human right. It is an essential tool for the realization of other human rights, such as the right to work, the right to health, and the right to participate in decision-making. Access to education is particularly vital for women and girls, as it enhances their social status, reduces gender inequality, and promotes gender parity in education and employment. In conclusion, education plays a vital role in the development and progress of individuals and society as a whole. It equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for personal growth, employment, and responsible citizenship. Education contributes to economic growth and development, reduces poverty, promotes social justice, and fosters social cohesion. It is, therefore, essential to prioritize investment in education and guarantee access to quality education for all individuals. A society that values education is a society that values its citizens' future."},{"instruction":"Provide the question for this answer: His name was John Smith","output":"What was his name?"},{"instruction":"Summarize the aphorism knowledge is power in one sentence.","output":"Knowledge equals power."},{"instruction":"List down 5 characteristics of a good employee","output":"1.

One day, a terrible storm hit the kingdom, causing widespread damage and destruction. Houses were destroyed, crops were ruined, and many people were injured. Seeing the devastation around him, Erik knew he had to do something to help. He set out into the storm, using his great strength to move fallen trees and debris out of the way, clearing the path for those who needed to get through. As he worked, Erik noticed a small, frightened child huddled under a tree, shivering and crying. Without hesitation, he scooped up the child and cradled him in his strong arms. The child held on tight, and Erik could feel the warmth of the child's body against his own. As they made their way back to the safety of the village, Erik realized that through his strength, he had found his kindness. Helping those in need was not about being the strongest or the bravest, it was about being kind and compassionate. Erik felt a sense of peace and fulfillment that he had never experienced before, and he knew that he would spend the rest of his days using his strength to help others. From that day on, Erik was known throughout the kingdom not just as a strong warrior, but as a kind and generous man who would do anything to help his fellow citizens.

The initial reaction to such a world would be one of confusion and helplessness. People would not know how to carry out their everyday tasks, and many jobs would become redundant. The story highlights the struggles of individuals who have to adapt to a new way of life, devoid of the convenience of technology. One of the most significant outcomes of this scenario would be the emphasis on interpersonal relationships. With no technology to distract or mediate communication, people would have to meet face-to-face and engage in meaningful conversations. The story demonstrates how individuals start building strong bonds with their family and friends through interpersonal communication. Moreover, the absence of technology would lead to a heightened sense of creativity and innovation.

Setting the equation equal to zero: [-6(x - 2)(x + 1)^2 = 0] The zeros are found by setting each factor equal to zero: [x - 2 = 0 rightarrow x = 2] [x + 1 = 0 rightarrow x = -1] So, the correct choice is: A. The real zeros of (f) are (2, -1). The multiplicity of each zero is determined by how many times it appears as a factor of the polynomial. - (x = 2) has a multiplicity of 1, because the factor ((x - 2)) appears once. - (x = -1) has a multiplicity of 2, because the factor ((x + 1)^2) appears squared. (b) The graph touches the x-axis at an x-intercept if that zero's multiplicity is even and crosses the x-axis if the multiplicity is odd. Thus: - At (x = 2), the graph crosses the x-axis because its multiplicity is 1 (odd). - At (x = -1), the graph touches the x-axis because its multiplicity is 2 (even). (c) The maximum number of turning points of a polynomial is given by one less than its degree. The polynomial (f(x) = -6(x - 2)(x + 1)^2) has a degree of 3 (because we have a cubic function when fully expanded). Therefore, the maximum number of turning points is (3 - 1 = 2). (d) The end behavior of the polynomial function is determined by its leading term. When expanded, the highest degree term of (f(x)) will be contributed by the factors ((x - 2)) and ((x + 1)^2) and specifically based on their highest degree x terms. The degree of the polynomial is 3 (a cubic), and its leading coefficient will be negative (given the (-6) coefficient at the front). Therefore, for large values of (|x|), the function (f(x)) resembles the power function (-x^3). This means: - As (x rightarrow infty), (f(x) rightarrow -infty) (because of the negative leading coefficient). - As (x rightarrow -infty), (f(x) rightarrow infty)."},{"instruction":"The multiplicity of the larger zero is enter your response here","output":"The larger zero in the given real zeros (2, -1) is (2).

Crosses the x-axis at (x = -2), (x = -1), and (x = 4), indicating it has at least three real zeros at these points. 2. Has a maximum and a minimum, which suggests it turns at least twice. Considering these characteristics: - A polynomial function of degree (n) has at most (n-1) turning points. Given that the described function has at least two turning points (one maximum and one minimum), the polynomial must be of degree 3 or more. - The fact that the graph crosses the x-axis three times to show three real zeros further supports the idea of a polynomial function because polynomial functions can indeed have multiple real zeros where they cross the x-axis. Thus, the graph can indeed represent a polynomial function. For a polynomial to have exactly three distinct real zeros and at least two turning points, the least degree it can have is 3. This is because: - A polynomial of degree 3 (a cubic) can have up to 2 turning points and can possess 3 real zeros, matching the behaviour described. - If it had fewer than 3 degrees, it wouldn't be able to accommodate three distinct x-intercepts and the described turning points.

Each of these values is where the polynomial would cross or touch the x-axis. 2. **Multiplicity and Behavior**: The way a graph interacts with the x-axis (whether it bounces off or passes through) depends on the multiplicity of its zeros. A root with even multiplicity generally suggests the graph touches and turns at the x-axis without crossing it, and an odd multiplicity indicates the graph will cross the x-axis at that point. Given these points, let's analyze the options: A. **(f(x) = -frac{1}{16}(x + 4)(x + 2)^2(x - 2))**: This polynomial has zeros at (x = -4), (x = -2), and (x = 2), with (x = -2) having a multiplicity of 2, suggesting a touch and turn behavior at (x = -2). B. **(f(x) = -frac{1}{16}(x + 4)(x + 2)(x - 2)^2)**: This option also places zeros at (x = -4), (x = -2), and (x = 2). However, this time (x = 2) has an even multiplicity, suggesting a touch and turn at (x = 2). C, D, E, and F each represent different configurations of these zeros with varying multiplicities and impacts on the graph's shape and behavior. Without seeing the graph, if the goal is to match a polynomial function to one that has distinct zeros at (x = -4), (x = -2), and (x = 2), with specific attention to whether the graph indicates a behavior of touching or crossing the x-axis at these points, you'd look for the correct multiplicities. Without specific details on how the graph behaves at these zeros (touches, crosses, the shape near these points), we can identify the correctly matched polynomial function based on general behavior: - If the graph is known to touch and not cross at (x = -2) and cross at (x = 2), option **A** might be more fitting due to the squared term at (x + 2), indicating a bounce or touch at (x = -2). - Conversely, if it's supposed to touch and not cross at (x = 2) and cross at (x = -2), option **B** would be appropriate with (x - 2) squared. Given only the zeros and no more specific behavior details, I’d preliminarily lean toward these interpretations, yet recall that the true best match depends on nuanced graphical behavior (which wasn't provided). For a standard interpretation, where specific behavior (such as whether the graph actually \\"touches\\" or \\"crosses\\" at these points) is not detailed, one usually cannot definitively select between A and B without additional context. However, based on a general understanding and most common contexts where multiplicity plays a role in the behavior at the zero, one may lean towards an option that matches conventional wisdom around these points. Without further details, both A and B seem plausible based on typical polynomial graph behaviors at and between their roots. Each option is viable for a polynomial having zeros at (x = -4), (x = -2), and (x = 2) with specified touches or crosses, but without seeing how the graph behaves precisely at these zeros or the overall graph shape, pinpointing whether the graph touches or crosses based on multiplicity alone here was more theoretical."},{"instruction":"Question content area top Part 1 Analyze the polynomial function ​f(x)equalsx squared left parenthesis x plus 8 right parenthesis using parts​ (a) through​ (e). x^2(x+8)","output":"Given the polynomial function (f(x) = x^2(x + 8)), let's analyze it using parts (a) through (e). # (a) Expand the Polynomial First, we can expand the given polynomial function to get a better understanding of its form: [f(x) = x^2 cdot (x + 8) = x^3 + 8x^2] This represents a cubic polynomial with coefficients 1 for (x^3) and 8 for (x^2), and no (x) or constant term. # (b) Find the Real Zeros and Their Multiplicities To find the real zeros of (f(x)), set it equal to zero: [0 = x^3 + 8x^2] Now factor out the common term, (x^2): [0 = x^2(x + 8)] This gives us two zeros: 1.

The leading term, (x^3), dictates that: - As (x) approaches positive infinity ((x rightarrow infty)), (f(x)) will also approach positive infinity ((y rightarrow infty)), because the power of (x) in the leading term is odd and positive. - As (x) approaches negative infinity ((x rightarrow -infty)), (f(x)) will approach negative infinity ((y rightarrow -infty)), again because the power of (x) in the leading term is odd, and an odd-powered term with a positive coefficient results in negative values when (x) is negative.

Based on the information: - Graph **A** describes a scenario where the curve passes through (x = -8) (which it should, as it's a zero), reaches a local minimum, then approaches a local maximum at (x = 0) (though it doesn't describe (x = 0) as a touching point properly in this description, the behavior matches the multiplicity and given zeros correctly, as the graph shouldn't actually have a local maximum at (x = 0) but rather should just touch the axis). - Graph **B** does not correctly place the zeros of the function or describe its behavior around those zeros appropriately given the function (f(x) = x^2(x + 8)). - Graph **C** incorrectly suggests a local maximum at (x = 0), and it doesn't align with the zeros or the associated behavior correctly (it references the minimum happening at (x = 0), not matching (f(x))'s described behavior and calculated properties).

This tells us: - At (x = -8), the graph of the function will cross the x-axis. - At (x = 0), with an even multiplicity, the graph will touch the x-axis but not cross it; it will kind of \\"bounce\\" off the axis here. 2. **End Behavior**: Since the leading term (x^3) dictates the end behavior: - As (x) approaches positive infinity ((+infty)), the (y)-values will also approach positive infinity ((+infty)), making the right side of the graph rise indefinitely. - As (x) approaches negative infinity ((-infty)), the (y)-values will approach negative infinity ((-infty)), making the left side of the graph fall indefinitely. 3. **Y-Intercept**: The (y)-intercept occurs when (x = 0), which we know to be at (y = 0). 4. **Turning Points**: The function, being a cubic polynomial, can have a maximum of 2 turning points. Given the shape required to touch and cross the x-axis at the specified points, we can anticipate: - A \\"wave-like\\" feature between (x = -8) and (x = 0) where the function dips below the x-axis after crossing at (x = -8), then rises back to touch (and not cross) the x-axis at (x = 0). **Visualizing the Graph**: - Imagine the graph starting well below the x-axis as you move from left to right (from negative infinity towards (x = -8)). - It crosses upward through the x-axis at (x = -8). - After (x = -8), the graph starts rising, reaches a peak (a local maximum), and then starts to curve back down because we know there should be turning points. - The graph dips to create a valley (likely below the x-axis) and then rises again toward (x = 0). - At (x = 0), the graph touches the x-axis because of the zero with multiplicity 2 and then continues to rise again towards positive infinity.

Based on your initial description, you have given the function: [g(x) = sqrt{frac{x - 8}{x + 3}}] This function involves a square root and a fraction. The domain of this function consists of all values of (x) that make the expression under the square root greater than or equal to zero (since you can't take the square root of a negative number) and also do not make the denominator of the fraction equal to zero (since division by zero is undefined).

Restrictions from the Square Root: The expression under the square root (frac{x - 8}{x + 3}) must be greater than or equal to zero: [frac{x - 8}{x + 3} geq 0] To solve this inequality, we need to consider the critical points where the numerator and denominator each equal zero, and then test intervals around these points. Numerator: (x - 8 = 0), so (x = 8) Combining this with the point we found from the denominator, we examine the intervals created around (x = -3) and (x = 8). The intervals to test are ((-∞, -3)), ((-3, 8)), and ((8, ∞)). For (x < -3), both the numerator and denominator are negative, making the fraction positive, but we must exclude (x = -3). For (-3 < x < 8), the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive, making the fraction negative; this interval is not part of the domain. For (x > 8), both numerator and denominator are positive, making the fraction positive. Also, the whole expression is valid because the square root of a positive number is defined.

Let's walk through these steps: # 1. Identify Vertical Asymptotes: Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero and the numerator is not zero, leading to points where the function approaches infinity. For (G(x) = frac{2x}{x^2 - 36}), set the denominator equal to zero: [x^2 - 36 = 0] [(x - 6)(x + 6) = 0] Therefore, (x = 6) and (x = -6) are vertical asymptotes. # 2. Identify Horizontal Asymptotes: Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degree of the polynomial in the numerator and denominator. Since the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2), there is a horizontal asymptote at (y = 0). # 3. Identify the x-Intercepts: The x-intercepts occur where the function equals zero. [0 = frac{2x}{x^2 - 36}] This leads to (0 = 2x), or (x = 0). So, there is an x-intercept at (0, 0). # 4. Identify the y-Intercept: The y-intercept occurs where (x = 0). For (G(x)), when (x = 0): [y = frac{2(0)}{0^2 - 36} = 0] There is a y-intercept at ((0, 0)), which is the same as the x-intercept. # 5. Check for Symmetry: If either (f(-x) = f(x)) or (f(-x) = -f(x)) holds true, the graph will have symmetry. For (G(x) = frac{2x}{x^2 - 36}), since (G(-x) = frac{-2x}{x^2 - 36} = -G(x)), the function is odd, reflecting origin symmetry. # 6. Plot Additional Points if Necessary: Choose a few values of (x) on either side of the vertical asymptotes and compute the corresponding (y) values to sketch more accurately. # In Summary: - **Vertical asymptotes** at (x = 6) and (x = -6). - **Horizontal asymptote** at (y = 0). - **Intercepts** at the origin ((0, 0)). - The function exhibits **origin symmetry**. These steps give you a basic structure for your graph. To sketch the function, draw your coordinate axes, plot the intercepts, asymptotes, and a couple of additional points for clarity.

To find any intersection points with the oblique asymptote (y = x + 9), we set the function equal to the equation of the asymptote and solve for (x). However, remember that an oblique asymptote describes the behavior of the function as (x) approaches (pminfty). Intersection points with oblique asymptotes can occur, but they do not imply multiple points of intersection as the function only asymptotically approaches the line described by the asymptote. Given the simplified form of (R(x)) after performing the long division was equivalent to the oblique asymptote itself ((x + 9) excluding (x = 6)), it suggests that by its nature, (R(x)) doesn't actually intersect the asymptote in the traditional sense since the asymptote is a simplification of the function's behavior at infinity. Typically, for polynomials that simplify to their own oblique asymptote, the nuance of intersection lies in the removal of singularities (like holes in the graph at certain points where the original function is undefined).

Given the nature of the rational function (R(x) = frac{x^2 + 3x - 18}{x - 6}), essence is determining behavior distinctively from the asymptote impact and zero-crossings. - **Below the x-axis intervals**: The graph is below the x-axis for (3 < x < 6).

Instead, since the equation does not lead to a solvable statement for finding a specific (x), it means we made an oversight in the approach. A correct approach to solve for the intersection would indeed start with setting the function equal to the asymptote but would involve rectifying the simplified equation correctly. Given (F(x))'s unique formula shares no solution directly with the asymptote's equation due to the mistaken cancelation implied, let's clarify the stance: Considering the function and its oblique asymptote, the correct conclusion is based on calculating intersections specifically, which involves a careful examination beyond the faulty algebraic step: For intersection points, typically, you would calculate where the function and the asymptote's output match. The mistake indicated simplification implies an erroneous path or misinterpretation of the process. Given the unique nature of oblique asymptotes and their tendency not to intersect the function they approximate (as their primary role is describing end behavior rather than providing specific intersecting points like horizontal asymptotes might), combined with the incorrect algebraic manipulation stated, real intersections would necessitate reconsidering how we align (F(x)) and its true asymptotic behavior. # Correct Choice Recap: Given my correction on the computational approach, if the equation directly comparing (F(x)) to its asymptote led to a nonsensical or false equality, it implies an error in process. Normally, you might recalibrate to assess intersections rigorously by equating function output and asymptote correctly. However, intersections between a function and its oblique asymptote, if they exist, would be found by setting them equal and solving, bearing in mind both the function form and the simplifications involved. Given the correction necessitated and without stepping through an accurate re-solving process here due to the initial misleading step, one might consider: - **C**: If the approach mistakenly implied no solution or if intersections are considered under a misunderstood calculation, it's crucial to reassess. - **A/B/D**: Choices would depend on accurately revisiting the equation comparing (F(x)) and its asymptote.

Simplify the Function First, check if the function can be simplified by factoring both the numerator and the denominator. Numerator: [x^2 + 4x - 45 = (x + 9)(x - 5)] Denominator: [x^2 - 2x - 15 = (x - 5)(x + 3)] Thus, the function simplifies to: [R(x) = frac{(x + 9)(x - 5)}{(x - 5)(x + 3)}] The ((x - 5)) term cancels out, leaving us with: [R(x) = frac{x + 9}{x + 3}] Note: Keep in mind that (x = 5) is a hole in the graph because it was canceled out. # 2. Find Vertical Asymptotes Vertical asymptotes are found where the denominator is zero (unless canceled out by a similar factor in the numerator, which would indicate a hole). Solving (x + 3 = 0) gives: [x = -3] So, there's a vertical asymptote at (x = -3). # 3. Find Horizontal Asymptotes Horizontal asymptotes are found by comparing the degree of the polynomial in the numerator to the degree in the denominator. Since the highest degree of both is 1 (after simplification), and they are equal, the horizontal asymptote is given by the ratio of their leading coefficients: [y = frac{1}{1} = 1] Thus, there's no horizontal asymptote in the simplified form due to the degree of the function. However, considering the original function where the degrees are equal (2), the horizontal asymptote is determined by: [y = frac{1}{1} = 1] # 4. Find X-Intercepts and Y-Intercepts **X-intercepts**: Set (y = 0): [0 = frac{x + 9}{x + 3}] [x + 9 = 0] [x = -9] So, the x-intercept is ((-9, 0)). **Y-intercept**: Set (x = 0): [R(0) = frac{0 + 9}{0 + 3} = 3] So, the y-intercept is ((0, 3)). # 5. Plot Key Points and Asymptotes - Plot the vertical asymptote at (x = -3). - Plot the hole at (x = 5), noting that (x = 5) is not part of the function’s domain. - Plot the x-intercept at ((-9, 0)) and the y-intercept at ((0, 3)). - Sketch the line approaching the vertical asymptote at (x = -3) without crossing it. - Considering the simplified form, the graph will approach the values dictated by the simplified function (frac{x + 9}{x + 3}) rather than any non-existent horizontal asymptote derived from the simplified function, but initially considering the degrees in the original function, it appears to evenly approach (y=1) as the horizontal asymptote due to the leading coefficients. # 6. Behaviour Near Asymptotes - To the left of (x=-3), the function will descend towards the asymptote. - To the right of (x=-3), the function will ascend from the asymptote. This step-by-step breakdown provides a comprehensive view towards plotting the rational function (R(x)). For detailed drawing, these points and asymptotes should be plotted carefully on graph paper or using graphing software, adding more points if necessary for accuracy."},{"instruction":"Magnificent ceiling fresco at Versailles, showcasing an array of celestial beings and angels soaring above, intricate details capture a moment frozen in time as they gracefully move amidst swirling clouds, masterpiece, in the style of Jean-Honoré Fragonard","output":"It's important to clarify that while the Palace of Versailles is indeed adorned with magnificent artwork and grand frescoes that capture the opulence and artistic richness of the French baroque and rococo periods, attributing a celestial ceiling fresco specifically to Jean-Honoré Fragonard might lead to some confusion. Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732–1806) was a French painter and printmaker whose late Rococo manner was distinguished by remarkable facility, exuberance, and hedonism. Known for his genre paintings, landscapes, and portraits, rather than for grandiose palace decorations, Fragonard's work embodies the frivolity and sensuousness of the Rococo movement. The Hall of Mirrors, the Royal Chapel, and the Royal Opera are among the most famous decorated spaces within Versailles, featuring intricate frescoes and splendid artworks. While Fragonard did produce art that was in line with the styles and themes appreciated at Versailles, the ceiling frescoes and murals at the Palace of Versailles are more commonly associated with artists like Charles Le Brun, François Lemoyne, and other painters who specialized in monumental and decorative pieces in service to the French monarchy, particularly under Louis XIV who was an avid patron of the arts. Le Brun, for example, was a key figure in the decoration of Versailles and is responsible for much of the work in the Hall of Mirrors and other significant rooms, including ceiling paintings that feature celestial scenes rich in allegory and symbolism relevant to the Sun King's reign. François Lemoyne, another notable artist, completed the ceiling painting in the Hercules Salon, which is one of the most extraordinary ceiling paintings at Versailles, depicting the Apotheosis of Hercules—a theme fitting the glorification of Louis XIV and his reign, though unfortunately, this wasn't the work of Fragonard but rather artists who preceded him and were more directly involved in the decor of grand palatial spaces. Therefore, while Jean-Honoré Fragonard created works that are celebrated for their creativity, vivacity, and romantic portrayal of the rococo ethos, attributing a specific grand celestial ceiling fresco at Versailles to him might be inaccurate. Celebrated as he is, the grand decor of Versailles showcases the talents of an array of artists who contributed to the splendor and narrative of French absolutist monarchy and baroque artistry."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Мой запрос: \\"Дай характеристику конуса\\".","output":"Конус, как многогранная фигура, занимает свое уникальное место в пантеоне геометрических форм, отражая в себе не только математические, но и философские, культурные, искусственные и символические аспекты, которые нашли отражение в различных областях человеческой деятельности. С математической точки зрения, конус представляет собой тело в трехмерном пространстве, который образуется в результате вращения прямоугольного треугольника вокруг одного из своих катетов. Эта фигура обладает рядом характерных свойств, таких как объем, который вычисляется по формуле (V = frac{1}{3}pi r^2h), где ( r ) – радиус основания конуса, а ( h ) – его высота. Площадь поверхности конуса складывается из площади боковой поверхности и площади основания, где первая вычисляется по формуле (S_{бок} = pi r l), где (l) – образующая конуса, а вторая соответственно (S_{осн} = pi r^2). Философская символика конуса чрезвычайно глубока и разнообразна. Эта форма, стремящаяся к точке в бесконечности, может символизировать идею асценденции, стремления к совершенству, изображая путь души к божественному началу или же процесс философского познания, где от множества к единству движутся мысли философа. Платон в «Тимее» рассматривает конус как одну из первичных геометрических форм, символизирующих элемент огня, что, в свою очередь, говорит о связи формы с первоосновами бытия. В культурном плане конус обретает множество проявлений, например, в архитектуре пирамиды древнего Египта могут рассматриваться как конусы, направленные вверх своими вершинами, символизируя стремление к небесам, к бессмертию. Символизм конуса распространен и в религиях мира: в христианстве коническая форма елки на Рождество символизирует вечную жизнь. В искусстве и литературе конус притягивает своей геометрической чистотой и символической загадочностью. Многие архитекторы и скульпторы используют конусообразные формы для передачи определенных идей или эмоций. Например, творчество Ле Корбюзье может служить иллюстрацией тому, как геометрические формы, включая конус, воплощают идеи функционализма и модернизма. В религиоведении и социальной антропологии конус также занимает свое место, связываясь с культическими предметами, символами и архитектурными формами, используемыми в различных культурах и религиозных традициях по всему миру. Например, юрты некоторых кочевых народов имеют конусообразную форму, обусловленную не только практичностью, но и традиционными представлениями о космосе, где конус служит связующим звеном между землей и небом. Социологический аспект конуса проявляется в иерархически строении обществ, где можно провести параллели с конусообразной структурой власти, заключающейся в том, что на вершине располагается узкий слой правящей элиты, расширяющийся к основанию, где находится большинство населения. Изучение конуса в психологии может касаться визуального восприятия данной формы человеком и её влияния на психическое состояние и когнитивные процессы. Культурная антропология, в свою очередь, рассматривает конус как элемент культурной символики и идентичности, отражающий определенные культурные ценности и представления. Таким образом, характеристика конуса, несмотря на его кажущуюся простоту, охватывает колоссальное множество аспектов, начиная от строгих математических определений и заканчивая глубокими философскими, культурными и антропологическими исследованиями, что делает эту геометрическую фигуру не только образцом математической элегантности, но и объектом с глубоким многогранным смыслом."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo where Nicktoons UK seems to be slightly shifting their schedule around, Bunsen is a Beast, Danny Phantom and Avatar have been replaced with a Monster Block (Monster High/AAHH!

What’s up with that? --- **LoudHouseLover21**: Yeah, I noticed that too! I'm kinda bummed about **Danny Phantom** and **Avatar** being replaced, those were my go-to shows after school. The Monster Block sounds interesting though, haven't seen **Monster Allergy** in ages. But I’ll miss my daily Avatar fix for sure. --- **PokeMaster98**: Did anyone catch that **Pokemon Advanced** is replacing **XYZ** next week? They keep switching these up. I was really getting into the XYZ series. Hopefully, Advanced will be just as good. At least the SpongeBob and Loud House mix is still the same. --- **MonsterManiax**: Totally psyched for the Monster Block! **AAHH! Real Monsters** is a classic, and I’ve been a **Monster High** fan for years. It's a nice switch-up, but I do get why some might miss the old lineup. Variety is the spice of life, though, right? --- **NickNostalgia**: Can't believe they're sidelining **Danny Phantom** and **Avatar**. Those are some seriously iconic shows. The Monster Block could be cool for a bit, but I hope they bring back the classics soon. Also, mixing in more Pokémon never hurts, but the constant series switching is a bit much. --- **AvatarAangFan**: This is really disappointing. Replacing **Avatar**? That show has such a strong fan base and it’s timeless. I understand trying out new themes like the Monster Block, but Avatar should be a staple! Guess it’s time to dust off the old DVDs. --- **GhoulGirl**: Honestly, I'm here for the Monster Block! It’s perfect for the Halloween season if they decide to keep it around for a bit. Plus, **Monster High** has a lot of fans that will be thrilled. **Monster Allergy** is an underrated gem too. Still, the absence of **Danny Phantom** seems like a missed opportunity during a monster-themed block. --- **Pikachu4Ever**: Welp, there goes my daily XYZ binge. **Pokemon Advanced** is okay, but XYZ had some epic battles. Hope Advanced has some good stuff too. At least **SpongeBob** and **The Loud House** are untouched. They kinda act as the backbone for Nicktoons' schedule anyway. --- **DannyPhanatic**: Removing **Danny Phantom** just when I thought there was a resurgence in interest... Not cool, Nicktoons UK, not cool. He's practically a monster-fighting hero himself. Would've fit right in with the block. Guess I'll have to stick to fan communities for my ghost boy fix. --- **RealMonstersFan**: Finally, **AAHH! Real Monsters** is getting the love it deserves! That show was way ahead of its time. Sad to see some favorites go, but this does shake things up. Maybe it’ll introduce these classics to a new audience. Can’t wait to see Ickis, Oblina, and Krumm back on my screen! --- **Thread Moderator**: Thanks for all your insights, everyone! It's clear there are mixed feelings about the schedule change. For those missing the old shows, remember, schedules often rotate, so they might be back sooner than you think. For now, why not give the new Monster Block a chance?

My Dad the Rockstar Takes Over! --- **TalesOfTerror**: Did anyone else notice **Grizzly Tales** got slashed in half on the late-night roster? I thought it was a solid choice for those looking to enjoy something a bit different. Now it's just to fill those independent quotas since it’s from Honeycomb Animation and aired on CITV. Replaced by **My Dad the Rockstar**? Was expecting more Pokémon or even Monster Allergy to take its place. Thoughts? --- **RockstarRiffs**: Honestly didn't expect **My Dad the Rockstar** to make a comeback, especially not at the expense of **Grizzly Tales**. I've got nothing against it, but the shift is…unexpected. Thought they’d double down on Pokémon or something more in line with current trends. --- **AnimationAdvocate**: It’s a shame to see **Grizzly Tales** pushed back. I get the vibe they’re only keeping it to meet quotas, which feels a tad disrespectful to the show. As for **My Dad the Rockstar**, it’s an interesting choice. Maybe it's a play for nostalgia? --- **QuotaConundrum**: Let's face facts, folks. Filling quotas is a big part of scheduling decisions, and **Grizzly Tales** fits that niche for them. **My Dad the Rockstar** coming in might just be their way of shaking things up. Perhaps it tested well in groups we're not aware of? --- **LateNightLurker**: **Grizzly Tales** was my late-night guilty pleasure! ☹️ The eerie vibe was perfect right before bed. **My Dad the Rockstar** is okay, but it doesn't hit the same spot.

Sure, it’s sad about **Grizzly Tales**, but isn't variety the spice of life? Maybe they’re just trying to appeal to a broader audience at the late-night slot. --- **MonsterAllergyFan**: Really thought they'd pick **Monster Allergy** to replace it, considering the Monster Block and all. Strange decision. **My Dad the Rockstar** has its charm, but feels off for the late-night vibe **Grizzly Tales** offered. --- **GrizzlyGuru**: Disappointed but not surprised. **Grizzly Tales** always felt like a show that was underappreciated, thrown in to check a box rather than celebrated for its storytelling. Here’s hoping it finds its way back to a more prominent slot. As for **My Dad the Rockstar**, might give it a shot; who knows? It could grow on me. --- **RockRevival**: TBH, **My Dad the Rockstar** returning is a win for me. I miss shows that aren’t afraid to be a little weird and wild. This might not be the popular opinion, but let’s give it a chance before we write it off completely for not being Pokémon or **Monster Allergy**. --- **Thread Moderator**: This thread is lively! Good to see so many passionate opinions. Remember, the TV landscape is always changing, and who knows what the future holds?

Noticed they’ve been trying to boost its popularity by pairing it up with other monster-themed shows. Even saw **Aaahh!!! Real Monsters (ARM)** got brought back into the mix. Think this will give MA the bump it needs? --- **GarfieldFanatic**: Honestly, it’s a smart move but **The Garfield Show** has its own loyal audience because, well, it’s Garfield. **MA** has its charm, but it’s fighting an uphill battle.

Pairing it up with classics like **ARM** is clever, but only time will tell. --- **PokeMasterX**: Every show has its day, but Pokémon’s throne is pretty much untouchable. That said, **MA** has been getting more attention since the monster-themed programming kicked in. The pairings make for a fun, themed block that’s been quite enjoyable. It certainly sets the right atmosphere for **MA** to thrive. --- **AaahhFan**: Thrilled to see **ARM** back in the lineup! If anything, I tune in for that nostalgia hit and stick around for **MA**. It’s a fun show with a lot of potentials. This strategy could introduce it to new viewers who come for the monsters and stay for the story. --- **AnimationAnalyst**: The tactic here is pretty clear: they’re attempting to create a monster universe of sorts to leverage the thematic continuity between shows. **MA** benefits from this association, particularly when paired with well-loved shows. It’s a solid strategy for audience crossover but boosting it past **The Garfield Show**—that's a tall order. --- **MonsterKid2000**: **MA** has always been underrated IMO. Pairing it with the likes of **ARM** just highlights what fans of monster genres enjoy. It’s a smart play, and I’ve definitely found myself watching more of it since the pairings started. Plus, who doesn’t love a good monster mash-up? --- **ClassicToonLover**: Is it just me, or have they been pushing **MA** really hard lately? I mean, I appreciate the effort to diversify, but I worry that forcing it into these blocks might deter some folks. It should stand on its own merits. That being said, the monster block has been entertaining. --- **DigitalDuo**: At the end of the day, it’s all about content consumption. By cleverly packaging **MA** with thematic shows, they’re not just trying to boost its viewership but also enhancing the overall viewing experience. It’s a smart way to capitalize on monster mania, inviting viewers to dive deeper into that world. --- **MonsterHighway**: Love or hate the strategy, it’s definitely got people talking about **MA** more. Plus, seeing **ARM** again is a total bonus. There’s a certain genius in revitalizing interest in monster themes this way. **MA** might just surprise us and climb up the ranks. --- **Thread Moderator**: Interesting points all around! It’s great to see such varied perspectives on the network’s strategy with **Monster Allergy** and its pairing with other monster-centric shows.

There’s been a lot of speculation about scheduling and programming strategies, particularly regarding shows like **Aaahh!!! Real Monsters (ARM)**. Can you shed any light on this? **CEO:** Absolutely, and thank you for having me. There has been a lot of discussion recently, and I'd like to clarify our stance and thought process behind these decisions. Our programming strategy, particularly with the integration of shows like **ARM** and its pairing with **Monster High (MH)** and **Monster Allergy (MA)**, was indeed designed with a specific purpose in mind. **Interviewer:** There’s been talk that **ARM**’s reintroduction was primarily to support **MA**, especially after **Horrid Henry** was no longer part of the lineup. Can you confirm this? **CEO:** I can confirm that. When we lost **Horrid Henry**, it created a gap that we needed to fill. **MA** has a strong potential, and we saw an opportunity to create a themed block that could not only support **MA** but also reintroduce viewers to **ARM**. It was a strategic move intended to bolster the ratings for **MA** and provide a cohesive viewing experience that capitalized on the popular monster theme. **Interviewer:** So, does this mean that **ARM** is likely to be phased out again soon? **CEO:** While I wouldn't say \\"phased out,\\" our programming is always under review to ensure it meets the viewers' interests and our strategic goals. **ARM**’s current run is tied to the performance and reception of this themed block. We are always exploring new content and partnerships to keep our lineup fresh and engaging. If something more aligned with our audience's preferences and our strategic direction emerges, we might adjust our schedules accordingly. **Interviewer:** Understanding that, is there a search for a new popular third-party show to join the lineup? **CEO:** Indeed, there’s always a search for exciting content that can resonate with our audience. Our goal is to provide a diverse range of programming that entertains and engages our viewers. While I can’t dive into specifics at this stage, I assure you that several discussions are in progress to bring new and thrilling content to our channels. **Interviewer:** How do you balance between popular international content and the need to fulfill independent content quotas? **CEO:** It's a careful balancing act. We're committed to supporting independent productions and fulfilling our quotas, as it's essential for the diversity of content and supporting the local industry. At the same time, we understand our audience has a broad range of interests, including international hit shows. Our strategy involves striking a balance that satisfies these requirements while ensuring a varied and interesting lineup for our viewers. **Interviewer:** Finally, can you give us a hint about future plans for the channels? **CEO:** Without revealing too much, I can say we’re excited about what’s on the horizon. We're looking into more theme-based blocks, similar to the monster theme, and are in talks for new series that have the potential to become viewer favorites. We’re also examining ways to bring more interactive and immersive experiences to our audience. So, stay tuned! **Interviewer:** Thank you for your time and the insight into the channel's strategies and outlook.

Nickelodeon UK, a staple in quality children’s entertainment, is no stranger to adapting its programming to meet the rapidly changing interests of its young audience. A recent development has seen the channel preparing to pivot away from one of its most iconic offerings, \\"Pokémon,\\" despite having two years remaining on its contract. This move has sparked speculation and a buzz of anticipation about what might come next. The Pokémon Phenomenon For decades, \\"Pokémon\\" has been a cornerstone of children's television, capturing the imagination of millions around the globe. Its success lies in its captivating stories, endearing characters, and the universal appeal of its \\"Gotta Catch 'Em All!\\" mantra. Nickelodeon UK's decision to start distancing itself from the Pokémon franchise thus comes as a surprise to many fans who have grown up with Ash, Pikachu, and the countless adventures across the Pokémon world. A Strategic Evolution Insiders suggest that this shift is a strategic response to the changing landscape of children's media consumption. With the rise of streaming services and on-demand viewing, traditional TV channels are challenged to offer content that can not only compete with the vast libraries available online but also cater to the new interests emerging from this digital age. Moreover, Nickelodeon UK’s intensive push of Pokémon-themed content, including making it the theme for their next pop-up channel, may be a move to maximize the franchise's potential while it's still part of their repertoire. This \\"PokéBlitz\\" could very well be a celebration of the franchise’s legacy on the channel, giving it the send-off it deserves. Looking Ahead: What's Next for Nickelodeon UK The impending post-Pokémon era for Nickelodeon UK points to a future where the channel is placing bets on new and possibly original content to fill the void. Recent trends show a leaning towards themes and genres that resonate with today’s kids, who are more in tune with social media trends and global issues than any generation before them. Speculation is rife about potential replacements. There's a strong case for more interactive and educational content, shows with environmental messages, or even series that incorporate technology and coding—skills that are becoming ever more important in today's digital world. Nickelodeon's recent pop-up ventures, such as \\"NickTooniverse,\\" show a willingness to experiment and innovate, suggesting that whatever comes next will be both fresh and forward-thinking. Embracing Change Change can often be met with trepidation, but it is also a doorway to new opportunities. For Nickelodeon UK, moving on from Pokémon is a bold step into uncharted territory. It's a chance to redefine what children's programming can be and, in doing so, remain a leader in an industry that never stops moving. For fans, while the prospect of losing a beloved franchise might be bittersweet, there's also the excitement of discovering new worlds and characters to fall in love with. Nickelodeon UK's journey beyond Pokémon promises to be one worth watching. In conclusion, as we say goodbye to the familiar faces of Ash and Pikachu, let’s stay tuned to see how Nickelodeon UK will continue to innovate and entertain the next generation of viewers. The Pokémon legacy will undoubtedly be a hard act to follow, but if anyone's up to the task, it's Nickelodeon UK."},{"instruction":"\\"Cet ordinateur portable alienware c'est un appareil révolutionnaire.

Give a condition that is necessary but not sufficient for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path. Justify your answer.","output":"A necessary but not sufficient condition for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path is that the graph must be connected, except possibly for vertices with degree 0 (isolated vertices). Justification: - **Necessity**: For an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path (a path that visits every edge exactly once), it must be possible to travel between any two nodes via a series of edges (except for isolated nodes which aren't connected to anything). If the graph were not connected (disregarding isolated vertices), it would be impossible to traverse all edges without lifting your pen (or the equivalent in a computational sense), since there would be no continuous path that includes all edges. - **Insufficiency**: Simply being connected is not sufficient for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path. Another crucial condition related to the degrees of vertices must also be met: - Eulerian Cycle (a closed Eulerian Path that starts and ends on the same vertex): Every vertex has an even degree. - Eulerian Path (but not a cycle): Exactly two vertices have an odd degree, with all others having even degrees.

Give a condition that is necessary but not sufficient for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path. Justify your answer. A necessary but not sufficient condition for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path is that the graph must be connected, except possibly for vertices with degree 0 (isolated vertices). For an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path (a path that visits every edge exactly once), it must be possible to travel between any two nodes via a series of edges (except for isolated nodes which aren’t connected to anything). If the graph were not connected (disregarding isolated vertices), it would be impossible to traverse all edges without lifting your pen (or the equivalent in a computational sense), since there would be no continuous path that includes all edges.\\" Is this a valid answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the provided answer is valid, but it could benefit from further clarification to fully address the question's requirements about Eulerian Paths. The explanation correctly identifies a necessary condition for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path: the graph must be connected if you ignore any isolated vertices (vertices of degree 0). This connectivity ensures that every edge is reachable from every other edge, making it theoretically possible to find a path that visits every edge exactly once. However, the answer could be enhanced by mentioning an additional necessary condition related to the degrees of the vertices. For an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path, it must not only be connected (excluding isolated vertices), but it must also satisfy one of the following conditions regarding the degrees of its vertices: 1. Exactly zero vertices have an odd degree, which actually implies the graph has an Eulerian Circuit (a closed Eulerian Path that starts and ends on the same vertex). 2. Exactly two vertices have an odd degree, which are the start and end vertices of the Eulerian Path. These conditions about vertex degrees are critical components of the characterization of Eulerian Paths in undirected graphs, but they are not sufficient by themselves. A graph meeting the degree conditions might still fail to have an Eulerian Path if it's not connected (excluding isolated vertices). Therefore, the original statement about the graph needing to be connected, except for isolated vertices, is indeed a necessary but not sufficient condition. Enhancing the answer to include information about vertex degrees would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the necessary conditions for an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Path."},{"instruction":"2. Give two necessary conditions for an undirected graph to have a Hamiltonian Cycle. Justify your answer.","output":"A Hamiltonian cycle in an undirected graph is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. For an undirected graph to have a Hamiltonian Cycle, several necessary conditions must be met, though these conditions alone may not be sufficient to guarantee the presence of such a cycle. Here are two necessary conditions: 1. **All vertices must have degree 2 or greater**: For a cycle to exist that visits each vertex exactly once, each vertex must have at least two edges (degree 2 or more). This is because, in a Hamiltonian cycle, each vertex needs to be entered and exited exactly once, requiring at least two connections (edges) to other vertices in the graph. A vertex with a degree of 1 would terminate any attempt to form a cycle since the path would end at a vertex that cannot lead back to the start or forward to an unvisited vertex. This condition follows from the concept of a cycle, necessitating an 'in' and 'out' path for every vertex in the cycle. 2. **The graph must be connected**: A connected graph is one in which there is a path between any pair of vertices. For a Hamiltonian cycle to exist, the graph must inherently be connected; otherwise, if the graph is disconnected (meaning that it is actually composed of two or more subgraphs with no connections between them), then it would be impossible to find a cycle that visits all vertices since there would be no way to move between these disconnected components without repeating vertices, which violates the definition of a Hamiltonian cycle. Connectivity is a necessary condition because the very essence of a Hamiltonian cycle requires uninterrupted traversal throughout the entire graph. It's worth noting that even if both conditions are met, they do not ensure the existence of a Hamiltonian Cycle. The problem of determining the existence of such a cycle in a general undirected graph is NP-complete, meaning no polynomial-time algorithm is known that can solve all cases. These conditions are merely prerequisites that must be satisfied before it's even conceivable to find a Hamiltonian Cycle within a graph."},{"instruction":"prove to me that god doesnt exist, short sentence","output":"As an AI, I must clarify that proving the non-existence of God falls into the realm of metaphysics and philosophy, where absolute proof is often elusive, making it beyond current human capability to conclusively prove or disprove the existence of a deity."},{"instruction":"System:'kız gibi davranmanı istiyorum' User:OHA Model:","output":"Bu isteğine ne denli güvenerek ve istekli bir şekilde bağlandığını anlayabiliyorum.

She went each Sunday, with the little Truby girls who lived across the street, to the Presbyterian church on Lowell Street, and she was ardent in study, and faithful in attendance as well. Her teacher, Miss Belle Blackwell, believed in encouraging both attendance at her class and seriousness of purpose in her pupils, through a series of small rewards. Each time a child came promptly to the Sunday school room when the second bell rang, and knew the lesson printed on the back of the illustrated card which had been distributed in class the previous Sunday, she surrendered the card temporarily, and Miss Blackwell pasted a golden butterfly on it as a testimonial of piety and application. When a child had twelve of these cards with their twelve golden butterflies, she was given \\"a pleasant and instructive reward\\" in return. The lesson this particular Sunday was concerned with one of the bloodier precepts of the Old Testament; it centered around the damnation and most cruel destruction of those who had been unable, or unwilling, to conform blindly to some Hebraic party line of that day; and when Christine sat quietly beside her daughter under the lamp, her mind still fixed on the suffering of the Daigles, Rhoda passed the card, on which she was to be examined next morning, to her, and asked that her mother question her about it. Christine read the text slowly, shook her head, and thought: Is there nothing but violence everywhere? Is there no real peace anywhere in the world? She wondered if her daughter should be taught such things, but sighing in a gentle protest, feeling that others surely knew more about these matters of faith than she did, she asked her daughter the questions required. Rhoda had learned her lesson well, and, smiling her charming, shallow smile, she nodded in triumph, and, going to her treasure box, she returned with the eleven butterfly-starred cards she'd already earned. \\"I'm sure to get a prize tomorrow,\\" she said. \\"I'm just sure to.\\" \\"What do you think it will be? Will it be something quite nice?\\" \\"It'll be a book, I guess,\\" said Rhoda. \\"Miss Belle almost always gives a book that improves the mind.\\" The anticipation of possession was already in her face, and, gathering her cards together, she returned them to their original place in her dresser drawer. Later, Mrs. Penmark read the afternoon paper, and went to bed early; but she found it hard to sleep, for Hortense Daigle's tear-stained, disintegrating face kept coming in the dark before her eyes; but at last she did fall asleep, and had a dream which disturbed her, but which she could not remember afterward. She got up earlier than she usually did on a Sunday morning, the liquid, triumphant sound of church bells in her ears, and fixed breakfast for herself and her child. Later that day, when Rhoda returned from church, she had her prize tucked under her arm; it was a copy of Elsie Dinsmore, and, going at once to the park, she opened her book and began eagerly to read, as though she hoped to find there an understanding of those puzzling values she saw in others-values which, though she tried her best to simulate them, were so curiously absent from herself. But the book bored her after a while, and, returning to the apartment, she sat at the piano to practice her scales. Her teacher said she had almost no musical ability, in the true sense of the word-she had only patience and tenacity. But she would play acceptably some day, more accurately, perhaps, than children with talent. At noon, old Mrs. Forsythe, who lived across the hall, brought over a tray of lemon meringue tarts she'd just baked. She knew that often a woman didn't feel in the mood to prepare for herself or her child, particularly if the child were a little girl, with the man of the house not there, these little extra treats, and she thought perhaps that Christine and Rhoda would enjoy the tarts for lunch, since they'd turned out quite well this time. It was such a pretty day, too; and if Mrs. Penmark had planned to go out, she'd be glad to keep an eye on Rhoda. It would be no trouble, really, for her grandchildren were coming over that afternoon, and one more would hardly make any difference. Mrs. Penmark, the depressed direction of her thoughts broken for a time, bent forward impulsively and kissed the old woman on her forehead. And Mrs. Forsythe, returning to her own apartment, said softly to her husband, \\"Christine is a very kind, gentle woman. She's a nice neighbor to have.\\" The funeral of the Daigle boy was held on Monday, and an account of it was in the afternoon paper. The grave had been \\"banked with floral tributes,\\" but the most imposing tribute of all had come from the children of the Fern Grammar School, which he had attended; each of his little classmates had contributed to the beautiful blanket of gardenias which had lain first on the coffin, and later on the grave itself. Mrs. Penmark folded the paper and put it on the hall table, thinking it strange that nobody had asked for a contribution from Rhoda. She wondered if the oversight had been a deliberate one, and then she thought I'm paying too much attention to this thing. There was no intention back of it. Perhaps one of the Misses Fern had telephoned when she was out, although that did not seem likely; perhaps Rhoda's name had been accidentally left off the list. Perhaps.... She decided to ignore the slight, although the implications hurt her a little, and, turning away, she told herself that she would not speak of it, not even to Monica and Emory. That afternoon she decided to go shopping, and taking Rhoda with her, she drove into town. She selected a pale-blue evening gown for herself, and she bought material for Rhoda's fall school dresses; but when she was home again, and Rhoda was skating in the park, up the walks, and around the cement path that circled the lily pond, the matter was still on her mind, and upon impulse she dialed the Fern School. Miss Octavia answered, and Christine said, \\"I read about the Daigle boy's funeral, and the beautiful gardenias the children sent him. I'm sorry I wasn't in when you telephoned about Rhoda's share.\\" There was no answer for a time; she could almost feel Miss Fern's embarrassment over the phone; but at last the old woman said in a voice scarcely audible, \\"There are so many children in the school. The blanket wasn't nearly so costly as the papers seem to think. Please don't worry. The money has already been collected, and the flowers paid for.\\" \\"Did you telephone me about the flowers?\\" asked Christine. \\"If you did not, I think I should know.\\" Miss Fern said in a soft, placating voice, \\"No, my dear, we did not telephone you. My sisters and I thought it better not to.\\" Christine said, \\"I see!\\" She waited, and then went on. \\"Were there other children left out, or was it simply that you didn't telephone me?\\" \\"My sisters and I thought you'd prefer to send flowers individually,\\" said Miss Fern. She waited again, as though shaping her words with the greatest care, and then went on in a voice that carried no conviction at all. \\"It isn't as though you'd been here a long time; this is Rhoda's first term with us, as you know.\\" Christine said, \\"I see. I see.\\" Then, softly, she added, \\"But why did you think we'd prefer to send flowers individually? Rhoda wasn't friendly with the boy, and my husband and I didn't even know the Daigles.\\" Miss Fern said, \\"I don't know, my dear. I couldn't answer truthfully if my life depended on it.\\" Then, as though pleading forgiveness, she said so quietly that her voice was almost a whisper, \\"I must go now. We have guests, and they'll think it strange.\\" Mrs. Penmark turned away from the telephone, a frown on her usually serene brow. If there were overtones she did not understand, if there were implications her mind could not take in, she would tell herself that they were meaningless, of no significance at all. She would tell herself it was a simple oversight; she would not even refer to it when she wrote her husband. After all, she reminded herself, Kenneth had his problems, too; and this, certainly, should not be one of them. She sat at her desk and wrote him a bright letter full of gossip about the people they both knew; she missed him greatly, as always, but was consoled in the knowledge that their lives held many years in which they would not be separated at all, years of contentment and peace. She affirmed the unalterable fact that she loved him. \\"I'll dismiss the Daigle drowning and everything connected with it from my mind,\\" she said to herself. \\"It was sad and unfortunate, but, after all, how can it concern me very deeply?\\" A week later Mrs. Penmark got a letter from the Fern School. The letter was brief, courteous, and to the point; it said in substance that the school to its regret found its membership filled, its rolls closed, for the term commencing in September, and it would not, therefore, be able to make a place for Rhoda. The writer was sure that Mr. and Mrs. Penmark would experience little difficulty in making other arrangements for the child; and again with regrets, and sincere good wishes, she was, most cordially, Burgess Witherspoon Fern. That day Christine went about in a preoccupied manner, the note constantly in her mind. In the afternoon, she showed the note to Mrs. Breedlove, asking her advice. Mrs. Breedlove said, \\"The longer I live, the more I see, the more I'm unable to understand the tight little minds of people like the Fern girls!\\" She tossed her pebble over her shoulder, and went on. \\"The truth of the matter is, Rhoda is much too charming, too clever, too unusual, for them! She isn't like those simpering little neurotics who believe everything that's told them, and never have an original thought of their own. Rhoda stands on her own feet, and makes her own decisions, I may add. She's all-of-one-piece. She makes those others look stupid and stodgy by comparison. That's the real complaint, I assure you!\\" She lit a cigarette, and in the silence Christine thought: Monica loves Rhoda, and she loves me, too. When she loves anybody, she can never see any wrong in them. She's completely loyal. She's a wonderful friend to have. Mrs. Breedlove said, \\"If I were you, I'd send Rhoda to public school next term; but if you think she won't meet the right sort of companions there, then we must arrange a private tutor for her. Anyway, I'd forget the matter for the time being. I wouldn't even answer Burgess Fern's insolent note.\\" But Christine went about with a feeling of panic in her breast, as though the incident of the Baltimore school were about to be renewed. To herself, she said for reassurance, \\"It's nothing like that. If it were, they'd have said so long ago.\\" Nevertheless, she felt there were things she did not understand, facts which the Fern sisters had, perhaps, but which had been withheld from her, and on the third afternoon, as though the matter were a most casual one, she telephoned the school and asked for an appointment in order that she might talk things over with the sisters. Miss Claudia ushered her into the big formal parlor, and said, as though in reproach, \\"As a usual thing, we'd be at Benedict this time of year, but the death of the Daigle child has ruined the summer for us.\\" \\"I'll never go there again,\\" said Octavia firmly. \\"The place is spoiled for me now.\\" She pulled a bell cord, and almost at once a maid came in with tea and bread and butter. When the servant had gone, Christine said, too abruptly, she felt, that she couldn't get the thought out of her mind that the drowning of the boy and the dismissal of Rhoda from the school were somehow connected. The thing puzzled her, and she wished they'd tell her frankly if this were, or were not, true. \\"But why do you think there's a connection between the two events?\\" asked Miss Octavia primly. \\"My sisters and I haven't intimated such a thing, I'm sure.\\" \\"Then may I assume there is no connection?\\" Miss Octavia sipped her tea and said that this particular situation was one she had earnestly hoped to avoid. She could not see what was to be gained, how anyone could really be served, by discussing it further; but since Mrs. Penmark had brought up the matter and wanted the truth, she had to confess there was a connection, a most definite one, between the two things. Miss Burgess said, \\"The busses hadn't even started before Rhoda began teasing the boy. She wouldn't give him any peace. She hung over his seat and breathed down his neck, staring at the medal all the time. The child sitting with Claude got up and moved finally, and Rhoda took the vacated place at once. She wanted Claude to take off the medal and let her hold it for him; but he covered the medal with his hand and said, 'Let me alone! Let me alone!\\" \\" \\"She became so insistent,\\" said Claudia Fern, \\"that I finally had to take her by the arm and make her sit by herself, up near the driver-as far away from Claude as I could get her. But even then she twisted her neck around and looked at the medal the whole time.\\" Mrs. Penmark sighed and said, \\"Rhoda is certainly an aggressive child, and a selfish one, too, I'm sure. But then our world seems to be full of selfish and aggressive people. My husband and I hope that she'll outgrow these things in time.\\" \\"That isn't all, I'm afraid,\\" said Burgess Fern. \\"When we were at the bay, and the other children were shouting and playing games together, Rhoda did nothing but follow the boy about, making his life miserable. She didn't say anything to him-she only stared at the medal, and at last the little boy, who was nervous and not at all strong, as we know, began to tremble so badly that I called him to me, and told him to pay no attention to Rhoda. Then he did a peculiar thing which I've thought about a great deal since his death. He took off his medal and asked me to keep it until the picnic was over.\\" \\"Did you do it? Perhaps the medal isn't lost, after all.\\" Miss Octavia rang for more hot water, and after the maid had gone, Miss Burgess continued. \\"No, I didn't do what he asked. I pinned the medal back on his shirt, and told him to develop more confidence in himself. I reminded him that the medal belonged to him, and nobody else. He had won it fairly. It was his. He had every right to wear it.\\" She walked to the window and looked out at the garden beyond. \\"I called Rhoda, and talked to her as well. I told her that her behavior was unpardonably rude, and not what we expected from our pupils.\\" Miss Claudia took up the story. \\"I joined my sisters about that time and gave Rhoda a talk on courtesy and fair play; but she only looked at me with that puzzled, calculating expression we've all come to know so well, and said nothing.\\" \\"She's not an easy child to understand,\\" said Christine. \\"If we went wrong with her somehow, it isn't surprising, I suppose.\\" \\"I hoped my talk would make some impression on her,\\" said Claudia, \\"but not an hour afterward one of our older pupils came on Rhoda and the little Daigle boy at the far end of the grounds. The boy was upset and crying, and Rhoda was standing in front of him, blocking his path. The older girl was standing among the trees, and neither of the children saw her. She was just at the point of intervening, when Rhoda shoved the little boy and snatched at his medal; but he broke away and ran down the beach in the direction of the old wharf where he was later found, with Rhoda following him, although she wasn't running. She was walking along taking her time, the big girl said.\\" \\"Did it occur to you that the big girl you mentioned might not be telling the truth?\\" \\"That isn't at all likely,\\" said Miss Claudia. \\"She was one of the monitors we'd appointed to keep an eye on the younger children; she's almost fifteen, and she's been with us since her kindergarten days. We're familiar with her character by this time, and it's excellent. No, Mrs. Penmark. She was telling precisely what she saw.\\" Miss Octavia said, \\"A little later-it must have been around noon, really-one of the guards saw Rhoda coming off the wharf. He shouted a warning, and was on the point of going to her, but by then she was on the beach again, and he decided to forget the matter, as it didn't seem very important under the circumstances.\\" It was true, she went on, the guard had not identified Rhoda by name; he knew the names of none of the children, actually; and at that distance he couldn't have identified anyone positively, whether he'd known them or not. He'd only mentioned a girl in a red dress, and since Rhoda was the only girl who had worn a dress that day, they had reasonably assumed that she was the one he had seen. Miss Octavia's old tottering spaniel came wheezing across the room. She picked the dog up and held it on her lap while the animal thrust its tongue out weakly and tried to touch her cheek. \\"The guard saw Rhoda on the wharf about noon, as I've said,\\" continued Miss Octavia. \\"At one o'clock the lunch bell rang, and when roll call was made, Claude was missing. You know the rest, I think.\\" Christine said, \\"Yes. Yes. I heard it on the air.\\" She opened and closed the catch on her bag, and then, against her will, she remembered an incident which had taken place in Baltimore the year before. One of the children in the apartment house where they'd lived had had a puppy, and Rhoda, seeing it, wanted one, too. They had bought the dog she selected, a little wire-haired terrier, happy to see the child was showing an interest, at last, in some object other than herself. At first she had been delighted with her dog; she had taken it everywhere, even exhibiting it to people in the lobby and boasting of its cost and pedigree; but later, when she found she was expected to take care of her pet herself-Kenneth had thought this excellent training for her, an object lesson in responsibility and kindness-when she found she must feed the dog and take it out, even though these things interfered with her reading, her jigsaw puzzles, her piano practice, the dog had somehow managed to fall from a window ledge onto the courtyard below. Christine had heard the dying whimpering of the dog, and going into her daughter's room, she had seen Rhoda leaning out of the window, dispassionately watching some object below. She had joined her daughter, and there, three stories below, was the little terrier with its spine crushed. She said, \\"What happened? What happened to the dog?\\" But Rhoda had walked away, as though the matter concerned her not at all. At the door she paused and said, \\"It fell out of the window, I think.\\" It was the only explanation that either she or Kenneth had ever got out of the child. But now, remembering the incident, sensing some vague connection between the two accidents, Mrs. Penmark felt a sudden anger rising in her. Her hand trembled, and her teacup rattled in its saucer. She looked around her, as though somebody were about to attack her. Carefully she put down her cup, closed her eyes, waited until she knew her voice would be as detached, as soft, as gentle as the voices of the Fern sisters, and said, \\"Are you hinting that Rhoda had anything to do with the boy's death? Is that the purpose of all this?\\" Her words had an odd effect on the Fern girls. They glanced at one another in astonishment, as though their guest were demented. \\"Why, of course not!\\" said Miss Octavia in horror. \\"That would be impossible! An eight-year-old child mixed up in a thing like that? Oh, no! Such a thing never entered our minds.\\" \\"If we thought anything like that,\\" said Miss Claudia, \\"we would have been compelled to notify the proper authorities.\\" Burgess smiled and said, \\"Oh, nothing so melodramatic as that, Mrs. Penmark. Our complaint is that Rhoda is evasive, and didn't tell us the whole truth. We feel she has knowledge that she's told nobody.\\" Miss Octavia broke off a piece of sandwich, fed it to her dog, and said that they'd been very fair to the child, and had given her every chance to explain. They had questioned her at length after the tragedy, and she had denied everything with a straight face; she'd denied harassing the boy in the bus, she'd denied trying to take the medal in the woods; she'd denied being on the old wharf at any time. She had been so innocent, so plausible in her denials, that for a time the sisters had doubted the evidence of their own senses. Christine said, \\"I see. I see.\\" Then, as the Fern sisters continued to talk of the affair, her mind went back to the child's expulsion from the school in Baltimore. Her husband had made light of the matter, perhaps for his comfort as well as her own. Many children took things, he said; he had taken things himself as a child, and he'd turned out all right—at least reasonably so. It was nothing to be concerned about, even if true; and insofar as lying was concerned, that was a part of the growing-up process of children-particularly imaginative children. They had comforted each other, and had accepted these solutions, but in their hearts they both knew the differences; children took fruits from orchards and flowers from lawns; and the lies they told were the magical lies of the imaginary worlds they live in at the moment. There were none of these qualities in her own child. Rhoda was interested in material things for their own sake, and the lies she told were the hard, objective lies of an adult whose purpose was to confound and mislead. She came back to the reality that surrounded her. Miss Burgess was saying, \\"We're sorry all this had to come up, or that Rhoda's connection with our school had to end this way; but we feel that Rhoda is not a good influence on our other pupils, whose interests we must consider, too.\\" \\"We feel that we're not able to understand or cope with a child of Rhoda's temperament,\\" said Claudia Fern. \\"We feel we can do nothing further for her.\\" Miss Octavia rose, as though bringing the interview to a close, and said, \\"We feel your little girl would be happier somewhere else. Frankly, we do not want her in our school any longer.\\" Christine was depressed and a little anxious when she returned home; to calm herself, she made a cup of tea which she drank at her kitchen table. From where she sat, she could see both the playground and the wide, paved courtyard at the back of the building. In the park, the children of the house and the children of neighbors, who were permitted to use the playground, swung, splashed in the lily pond, skated, or played the running and shrieking games of childhood. Rhoda was in the park, too; but she kept herself away from the boisterous children; she sat on a bench beneath the old white pomegranate, reading the copy of Elsie Dinsmore she'd won for attendance and application. Then Leroy Jessup came out of the basement carrying a bucket of ashes from the incinerator. He stopped at the gate to scold the children wading in the pond, to warn them that if they tore up them lilies again, he was going to have their mothers whup them good with a buggywhup; then, lifting his eyes toward the skies, as though asking heaven to witness the things he endured, he disappeared into the alley beyond Mrs. Penmark's are of vision. She began to feel better, her depression dissolving itself in the warmth of the tea. After all, there was nothing the Fern sisters had told her about Rhoda that she had not already known, and for a much longer time. The child's singleness of purpose, her evasiveness, her innocent plausibility when trapped, her incessant lying, were things which had long since ceased to surprise either herself or Kenneth, and when she considered the factors of the affair in quietness, those things, really, were all the Fern sisters had intimated. The charges they had brought, if one could call such vague dissatisfactions charges, were susceptible of more than one interpretation. She had little doubt that Rhoda had worried the Daigle boy, or that she had tried to take the medal from him in the woods, even though the child had denied these things with such earnestness. But Claude Daigle, as anyone could see, was the born victim of others--the one who, in a sense, went about the world to invite his own destruction. Rhoda's violence with him was unusual for her, greatly out of character. She would never have tried such an approach on a child with more courage and self-reliance, one who would cheerfully turn and slap her down. She was not trying to justify her child, for she could not condone the things the child had done; she was only saying to herself that matters were not so bad as she had feared. Rhoda was her child, and she loved her. It was her duty to protect the child, to make every allowance for her, to give her the benefit of every doubt. She washed her cup and put it away. She would make the best of the matter. She would trust in the future. She would hope that everything turned out all right in time. Then, returning to her living-room, she telephoned Monica to tell her she'd decided to take her advice and put Rhoda in public school next season. Mrs. Breedlove's cheerful voice came through the receiver, approving the decision; then, lowering her voice, she explained that Mildred Trellis and Edith Marcusson were in her apartment at the moment. They had called to discuss a clinic for the treatment of alcoholics which she was trying to establish. She had known Mrs. Trellis and Mrs. Marcusson all her life; they were charming girls of excellent families; but what was more important for her present purpose, they were stinking with money. The trouble was, Emory had come home earlier than she had expected, bringing with him that Reginald Tasker, and they were interfering with her plans. They'd been in town drinking, and Emory, at least, was high. It wasn't that they were acting common or using objectionable words; this wouldn't bother her friends in the slightest, for they were both well-read ladies; they were simply sitting together over by the ferns, making silly comments behind their hands; and at regular intervals, Emory would get the sherry decanter and fill the glasses of her visitors. She giggled and wondered if Christine would come up and divert the attention of the boys until she could put the squeeze on her wealthy friends. \\"Put on your new high-heel pumps with the little leather bows in front, and see that the seams of your stockings are straight. Emory admires you to distraction. He says you've got the best legs in town.\\" The men met her at the door, took her into the kitchen, and fixed her a drink. \\"Why is it,\\" asked Reggie, \\"that real pretty girls like Christine never go around talking about their unconscious minds?\\" Emory kissed her loudly on the cheek and said, \\"This one's got it, hasn't she, boy? This one's really stacked.\\" In the living-room, Monica was saying, \\"I'm so tired of novels about sensitive boys and their first sex experiences. You know how it is, Edith; they slink home in disgust, feeling degraded and guilty. Sometimes they flip their lids, sometimes they jump out of windows, they're all so delicately adjusted and refined.\\" Mrs. Marcusson took a swallow of sherry and said solemnly, \\"Sex is a wholesome and normal experience.\\" One of Reginald's long, pale eyes was set a little lower than its mate, like the migrating eye of a flounder at the beginning of its journey. He patted Christine's shoulder and said, \\"Is everything under that black satin dress really you?\\" Christine took her drink and said, \\"I get it from the upholsterer. He comes in twice a week and fluffs me out.\\" She laughed and pulled away, thinking: Rhoda probably did follow the boy down the beach. Maybe he ran out on the wharf to get away from her, and she followed him. Maybe he backed away from her and fell among the pilings. I don't know whether this happened or not. But anyway it's the worst thing I have to face- \\"Now, the sort of book I'd like to read,\\" continued Mrs. Breedlove, \\"is one about a boy who hasn't a smidgen of delicacy in him.\\" She took a sip from her glass, giggled, and went on. \\"My little boy is an ordinary, nasty little boy who's going to be an ordinary, nasty little man when he's grown. He works in a grocery store after school, I think; and he saves his nickels and dimes until he's got enough for his first visit to the town whore, who's old and fat, and hasn't had a bath all over since Armistice Day.\\" Mrs. Trellis laughed shrilly; then, as though realizing how loud her voice sounded in the room, she composed herself, sat up in her chair, and said, \\"If you'll write it, I'll buy a thousand copies.\\" Christine thought: But if the boy backed off into the water, and Rhoda was there, why didn't she call out to the guard who saw her on the wharf? Why did she run away? Why did she leave the boy to die? She turned her head and shuddered inwardly. \\"But I won't keep going over this,\\" she said to herself. \\"It's strange and terrible. I won't think about it again.\\" \\"My nasty, average little boy,\\" said Mrs. Breedlove, \\"came out of the place smirking and rolling his eyes. He whistled and swaggered from side to side. He's wondering if he can talk his old man into letting him quit school and take a full time job at the bag factory. That way, he can make more money, and pay more visits to the greasy old whore who's just taken his virginity. My boy's going to be such a dear, normal boy!\\" Emory stuck his head out and said, \\"If you girls are going to talk dirty, Reggie and I'll have to leave the room.\\" The girls went into whirlwinds of laughter, and Monica, catching his eye, shouted for him to open another bottle of the good sherry as her guests wanted another sip before they got down to business; then, turning to Mrs. Marcusson, she said, \\"I want to apologize for Emory's condition, my dear. Emory's drunk.\\" Emory dropped an ice cube, kicked it under the stove, and said, \\"Well, look who's talking!\\" While he got out the sherry, Christine and Reginald came into the living-room and sat down. Christine said she'd been thinking about the conversation they'd had the last time she'd seen him. He'd told a story then of a woman who'd poisoned her niece for insurance. What she wanted to know now was when did such people start their careers? Did children ever commit murders, or was she correct in assuming that only grown people did such dreadful things? Reginald thought that this was not the best time for a discussion of such serious matters; but if she was really interested, why not telephone him, or drop by his apartment for lunch some day? However, he would say now, in spite of all the giggling and confusion, that children quite often committed murders, and clever ones, too, at times. Some murderers, particularly the distinguished ones who were going to make great names for themselves, usually started in childhood; they showed their genius early, just as outstanding poets, mathematicians, and musicians did. He paused, and in the silence Monica said distinctly, \\"I've often wondered why I married Norman Breedlove. Lately, I've come to the conclusion that it was his name that attracted me.\\" She glanced at her brother and continued. \\"Now, my first association to Norman is 'normal'; after all, there's only the difference of a consonant. \\"Normal' is such a reassuring word. It's the word the worried people of my generation were looking for.\\" Mrs. Trellis wagged her finger and said, \\"Where's the sherry? What have you done with the sherry, Emory?\\" Mrs. Marcusson, who looked more like a dowdy old farm woman in town to sell her vegetables than a woman of wealth, tilted her battered old hat with the back of her hand, and said, \\"I wonder what young people talk about these days? When we were young, at least we had sex and social betterment to occupy our minds. I've got a feeling that young people now don't talk about anything except television and canasta.\\" Monica waited tolerantly until her guest had finished, and then went on. \\"Now, \\"breed' is associated in my mind with increase, and 'love' is associated with love, naturally. So the combination Norman Breedlove brings to mind one who would not only be well adjusted and normal, but one of constantly increasing affection, too. The thing is so simple in retrospect, although it never occurred to me at all at the time.\\" Emory said, \\"I thought you married Norman Breedlove because he was the only man that asked you to.\\" Before she could answer, he laughed and said, \\"Now I bet Christine with those big gray eyes and yellow hair had to beat the boys off with an umbrella.\\" Christine said, \\"You couldn't be more wrong. I was never popular. I was too earnest and literal for the boys.\\" Mrs. Trellis began to laugh, and Mrs. Marcusson joined in the merriment. Mrs. Trellis said, \\"This has been such a stimulating afternoon, Monica. Now, just relax and sit back and quit worrying about how much you're going to get out of Edith and me. You're going to get plenty. Edith and I talked the matter over on our way here. You're not going to get as much as you figured on, maybe-but you're going to get quite a bit.\\" Emory said in a voice audible to all, \\"Those three old bags are as drunk as owls. They got away with a quart and a half of sherry.\\" The three rose and stared at him coldly. Monica steadied herself, put on her glasses, and said, \\"Let's go into the library, girls, where we can be by ourselves. We have pens and paper and blank checks on every bank in town.\\" They put their arms about one another's waists and walked away, but as they passed through the big, old-fashioned folding doors, they turned their heads at the same moment, looked back, and screamed with laughter. Christine put down the drink she had hardly touched, thinking: But suppose she followed him to the end of the wharf, and Claude, rather than let her take the medal, threw it into the bay. Suppose she picked up a stick or something and hit with it, knocking him into the water, stunning him and leaving him to die there. Suppose- She lowered her head and gripped the arms of her chair, for already despair and guilt were nibbling like mice at her mind. She got up and said she must go back to her apartment. It was almost five o'clock, and Rhoda should be returning from the playground soon. She called out to Monica that she was leaving, and Mrs. Breedlove, abandoning her friends in the library, came back into the living-room at once. \\"Aren't you afraid, a pretty little thing like you, to live on the first floor without a man to protect you?\\" asked Reggie. \\"It isn't really the first floor,\\" said Monica. \\"Those front stairs rise quite a bit, if you'll notice. And underneath there's an enormous basement that's mostly aboveground. Christine's window is about ten feet from the ground, really.\\" \\"I'm not at all afraid,\\" said Christine. \\"Kenneth bought a pistol for me, and I know how to use it, incidentally.\\" She smiled and said, \\"I was surprised that anyone can have a pistol here, if he wants it. In New York, having a pistol is one of the worst things you can possibly do.\\" \\"You have to have a permit,\\" said Emory. \\"That is, everybody but the crook that shoots you has to have one. Now, we're more civilized in this state; we believe in giving the victim a chance, too.\\" Mrs. Penmark came into her apartment and stood there idly. She kept repeating under her breath, as though her denials were a charm to save her, \\"Everything is all right. There's absolutely nothing to worry about. I'm making a lot out of nothing at all, as I usually do. I'm being quite silly.\\" It was getting dark in the rooms that faced the east, and she turned on the light, thinking: My mother used to laugh and say I could make a mountain out of a molehill without half trying. I remember once in a hotel in London, my mother was talking with some people she knew and she put her arms around my skinny shoulders-my mother was always such an affectionate, gentle woman-and said, \\"Christine bothers about the strangest things!\\"... I don't remember what she was referring to now, but I did know at the time, of course. She went about her house, performing the usual automatic tasks of late afternoon, and then, standing still in her living-room, she shook her head stubbornly and thought: There's no reason to think Rhoda had anything to do with the death of the little Daigle boy. There's no real evidence against her at all I don't know why I'm behaving so strangely. You'd think I was trying to build up a damaging case against my own child out of nothing but my own silliness.... Suddenly she sat down, as though too weak to stand any more, and rested her head on the arm of her chair, for she knew then that the thing she had determined never to remember again—that affair with its mysterious overtones which she'd never brought herself to face honestly-had entered her mind once more, despite all her resistances. Oh, no! It was not alone the unexplained death of the little boy that had so greatly disrupted the attitude of poised serenity which she had with such difficulty established for herself; it was really the unexplained death of the boy added to another most peculiar death, a death also unexplained, which, too, had involved her daughter-the only person to witness it. Either instance, taken alone, could probably be dismissed as one of those unfortunate but unavoidable accidents that happen everywhere, to everyone; but taken together, with the similarities of their mysteries combined, the effect was more compelling, more difficult to explain away with casual reasoning.... The first death had taken place in Baltimore more than a year ago, when Rhoda was just seven. At that time, there had been living in the same apartment house with them a Mrs. Clara Post, a very old woman, and her widowed daughter, Edna. The old lady had become inordinately attached to Rhoda (It was strange, Mrs. Penmark thought, how greatly Rhoda was admired by older people, when children her own age could not abide her.) and when she came home from school in the afternoon, she often went up to visit her ancient friend. The old lady was in her middle eighties, and a little childish, and she took delight in showing her possessions to the child. The one thing she valued most of all her trinkets was a crystal ball filled with transparent fluid, a little ball in which fragments of opals floated, glistened, and changed with a movement of the wrist, into bright and varying patterns. There was a small gold ring sunk in the top of the crystal, like a miniature hitching post, and through it the old lady had run a black ribbon in order that she might wear her opal pendant about her neck.","output":"Christine and Leroy are liked by the reader for various reasons highlighted in the narrative: 1. **Christine's Compassion and Sensitivity**: Her deep concern for the emotional well-being of others, including her daughter Rhoda and the Daigle family, showcases her compassionate nature. Her internal struggle over the content of Rhoda's Sunday school lessons reflects a sensitivity towards the violent and harsh realities of the world, hinting at her desire for peace and her protective nature towards her daughter. 2. **Christine's Thoughtfulness and Empathy**: Her thoughtful gesture of kissing Mrs. Forsythe on the forehead after receiving lemon meringue tarts shows an appreciation for small acts of kindness, highlighting her warm and empathetic character. Additionally, her reflections on the funeral of the Daigle boy and her concern over not contributing to the floral tribute showcase her empathy towards the grieving family. 3. **Christine's Dedication to Her Daughter**: Despite the concerning behavior of Rhoda and the disconcerting truths she faces, Christine's love and dedication to her daughter are unwavering. She seeks to understand Rhoda and is resolved to support and protect her, exemplifying unconditional maternal love. 4. **Leroy's Sincere Engagement with the Community**: While Leroy serves a more peripheral role in this excerpt, his interaction with the children in the playground, warning them not to damage the lilies, indicates his involvement and care for the community space. His somewhat theatrical despair (\\"lifting his eyes toward the skies\\") adds a layer of humor and personality, making him a memorable character. 5. **Both Characters' Complexity**: Christine and Leroy are not one-dimensional; they are complex individuals navigating difficult circumstances. Christine's internal conflicts and her struggle to reconcile her love for Rhoda with the unsettling possibilities surrounding her, add depth to her character. Leroy's character, though not as deeply explored in this excerpt, hints at a multi-faceted individual beneath his outward behavior. These examples demonstrate how both Christine and Leroy, through their actions, thoughts, and interpersonal interactions, endear themselves to the reader. Their likability stems from their nuanced portrayal, encompassing both their virtues and their imperfections."},{"instruction":"give me some examples of why christine and leroy are likeable characters: Mrs. Breedlove lived with her brother on the floor above the Penmarks. There had been a great event in her life, one which she had not been able to forget. In the middle twenties, her husband, not knowing what else to do with her, acceded to her wish that she go to Vienna and be psychoanalyzed by Professor Freud. The story of her analysis was one which she never tired of telling-one whose possibilities she never succeeded in exhausting. It seemed that after her intense initial session with the professor, he had said frankly that her particular temperament was beyond his skill, and had suggested that she go to London and seek the aid of his pupil Dr. Aaron Kettlebaum. This she had done. \\"It was a fortunate suggestion,\\" she often said; \\"not that I'm minimizing Doctor Freud's professional standing in any manner, shape, or form, for I still consider him, in spite of his peculiarities, the great genius of our time; but Doctor Kettlebaum was more-more sympatico, if you know what I mean. Freud was so committed to nineteenth-century materialism that it warped his viewpoint, it seemed to me. Then, too, he loathed American women, particularly the ones who were able to stand on their own feet and slug it out on equal terms with men. Now, Doctor Kettlebaum believed in the power of the individual soul, and he considered sex of only trivial interest. His mind was mystic rather than literal-the same as my own. He did much for me, and when he died several years ago, I cabled flowers and cried for a week.\\" She had returned to her husband three years later, and at once began proceedings for a divorce, an action which he made no effort to oppose. When she was free again, she decided it was her duty to make a home for her brother Emory, and she did so. She took pleasure in the analysis of his character, analyses that he endured mostly in silence. Of late, she had come to the conclusion, through a series of her own deductions, that Emory was, as she termed it, a \\"larvated homosexual\\"; and once during the preceding spring, at one of her big dinner parties, she seized on the new theme and discussed it so freely that the only unembarrassed person at the table was herself. \\"What does \\"larvated' mean?\\" asked Emory. \\"That's one I haven't heard so far.\\" \\"It means covered, as with a mask,\\" said Mrs. Breedlove. \\"It means concealed.\\" \\"It means something that hasn't come to the surface as yet,\\" said Kenneth Penmark. \\"You can say that again!\\" said Emory, laughing weakly. He was a plump, ruddy man, a few years younger than his sister. His hair had receded far back on his pink, domed forehead. His belly was small and hard; it had a taut, rounded quality, as though designed by nature as a background for the massive watch chain and emblem. Frank Billings, whom Monica always referred to as \\"Emory's canasta friend,\\" said, \\"Well, where did you get that idea, Monica? What makes you think that?\\" \\"My opinion,\\" said Mrs. Breedlove, \\"is based on the evidence of pure association, and that's the best evidence of all.\\" She sipped her wine, puffed her lips thoughtfully, and went on in an earnest voice. \\"To begin with, Emory is fifty-two years old, and he's never married. I doubt if he's ever had a serious love affair.\\" Then, seeing that she was about to be interrupted by Reginald Tasker, \\"one of Emory's true-murder-mystery friends,\\" she raised her hand and said, \\"Please! Please!\\" in a placating voice; and then went on quickly. \\"Now, let's look at things objectively. What are Emory's deepest interests in life; what are the things that occupy his psyche? They are fishing, murder mysteries that involve the dismemberment of faithful housewives, canasta, baseball games, and singing in male quartettes.\\" She paused and then said, \\"And how does Emory spend his Sundays? He spends them on a boat with other men-fishing. And are there ladies present on such occasions? I can answer that question at once-there are not.\\" \\"You're damned right there aren't!\\" said Emory. Mrs. Breedlove looked about her, and then realizing for the first time the effect she'd created among her guests, she tossed her head and said in a surprised voice, \\"I don't see why the idea shocks you so. A thing so commonplace as that! Actually, homosexuality is triter than incest! Doctor Kettlebaum considered it was all a matter of personal preference.\\" But it would be a mistake to think of this obsessed, garrulous old woman as a fool in most matters. She had taken the lump settlement that her husband had so cheerfully given her and invested it in real estate, following a system based both on sexual symbolism and the unalterable fact that if the town continued to grow, as everyone predicted, it had to go in the direction of her holdings. She had been successful from the first. She had written a successful cookbook; she was responsible for the city's psychiatric clinic; she was thought of as the tireless civic worker, the logical, efficient chairman of the charitable drive for funds. On the day of the school picnic, Mrs. Breedlove telephoned Christine and asked her to lunch. One of Emory's fishing friends had sent him a beautiful, seven-pound redfish. Emory himself had just called to say that, since it was Saturday, he was closing the plant at noon and would be home for lunch. He'd asked her to fix redfish Gelpi, which she hadn't done in a long time, and she said she would. \\"Emory is inviting his friend Reggie Tasker, that true-crime writer you and Kenneth met last spring in our apartment, and he wants you to help entertain him. Now, why don't you come up early, say around noon, and I'll show you how to fix the redfish? It's in the sauce, mostly.\\" Later, Mrs. Breedlove decided to serve lunch not in her gloomy, paneled dining-room, but in the little alcove off her living-room where she kept her ferns and African violets; and when her brother and his guest arrived, the table was set there, and ready. The men were talking about a recent murder, one which was being featured in the local papers. Reginald Tasker, it appeared, was going to do it for one of his murder magazines, and was now gathering his preliminary facts. Mrs. Breedlove, hearing fragments of the talk, laughed, tossed her head, and said, \\"We're off to the races again!\\" The case concerned a middle-aged hospital nurse, a Mrs. Dennison, who had been indicted for the murder, on May first, of her heavily insured two-year-old niece, Shirley. It was then the town remembered that another niece, a sister of the 1952 victim, had died in 1950, in the same manner, when she had been two years old as well. Nurse Dennison, a woman dedicated to the benefits of insurance, had collected five thousand dollars on the death of the first child; the second niece she had insured for six. Mrs. Breedlove came into the living-room to welcome her visitor; Christine followed immediately and put a pitcher of Martinis on the coffee table; a moment later they went to the alcove for a final checkup of the luncheon table, and Reggie went on quickly to say that Nurse Dennison's husband, conventionally true to the family tradition of nausea, burning throat, and convulsions, had passed on in the autumn of 1951, with, of course, the conventional policies on his life. Christine laughed a little, put her hands over her ears, and said so softly the men could not hear her, that she did not like to listen to such stories. Anything concerning crime, particularly murder, depressed her and made her anxious. She had seen the accounts of the Dennison case, but she could not bring herself to read them; she had merely turned the page, and had gone on to something more cheerful. \\"You have a little psychic block there!\\" said Mrs. Breedlove in an intense, pleased whisper. \\"Now, if you'll associate to the situation, maybe we can get at the roots of your anxiety.\\" She straightened her centerpiece, and when Christine did not answer at once, she went on earnestly. \\"Tell me the first thing that comes into your mind! Tell me, no matter how silly it seems to you!\\" Reginald Tasker went on to say that in the forenoon of May first of that year, Nurse Dennison had visited her sister-in-law's family. She got there in time for lunch. At once she picked up her niece Shirley and began playing with the child. She had meant to bring Shirley a present, she said, but had forgotten, a thing which distressed her so greatly that she went to the country store near by and bought candy and soda pop for the family. \\"Nothing comes into my mind,\\" said Christine. \\"It's entirely blank.\\" \\"Actually, Nurse Dennison had brought her niece a present,\\" said Reginald Tasker. \\"It was the ten cents' worth of arsenic she'd bought on her way to her sister-in-law's home. In a way it was more a present for herself than for her niece, since she stood to benefit so greatly if she succeeded in administering it.\\" \\"But what's on your mind at this moment?\\" insisted Mrs. Breedlove. They returned to the kitchen, and as Mrs. Breedlove agitated the salad in her big wooden bowl, Christine said presently, \\"I was thinking how much the Fern sisters are impressed by my father's reputation. Miss Burgess thinks I look very much like him, although she never saw him in person, and is familiar only with his photographs.\\" Mrs. Breedlove said in an uncertain voice, \\"That's an unusual association, I must say. I don't understand it so far.\\" She narrowed her eyes, pursed her lips, and listened absently to the conversation in the living-room. According to Reggie Tasker's notes, Nurse Dennison returned with her treat and immediately prepared a drink of orange pop for her niece Shirley. For the next hour or so she observed the child's convulsions with a most flattering concern; later on, perhaps because the child's stamina seemed about to triumph over her aunt's intention, Nurse Dennison said that, in her opinion, what little Shirley needed at this point in her illness was another sip or two of orange pop; it was sure to settle her stomach and return her to her customary bouncing health. She tendered the cup, and Shirley, a sweet, obedient child, drank at her aunt's bidding. \\"Now, what's your second association?\\" insisted Mrs. Breedlove. \\"Maybe your second association will be clearer.\\" \\"It's even sillier,\\" said Christine. For a moment she turned her past over in her mind, then impulsively she said, \\"I've always had a feeling I was an adopted child, that the Bravos weren't my real parents. I asked my mother about it once-it was in Chicago, the year I finished high school-but she kept saying, \\"Who have you been talking to? Who's been putting such ideas in your head?\\" The thing upset her so much that I never mentioned it again.\\" \\"Oh, you poor, innocent darling!\\" said Monica. \\"Don't you know that the changeling fantasy is one of the commonest of childhood? I once believed I was a foundling with royal blood-Plantagenet, I think it was. I don't know how I managed to get on my parents' doorstep, but I had it worked out well enough when I was five years old. The myths and folklore of all people simply teem with such fantasies.\\" Her laughter died suddenly. In the silence, Reginald Tasker's voice came through once more. After the child had accepted her second dose of arsenic, and it was plain she could not rally again, Nurse Dennison announced that she must hurry back to town in order to take care of a matter of her own. This errand, as it turned out, was a trip to the agent from whom she'd bought the smaller of the two policies she carried on the life of her niece; she'd failed to pay the current premium, and this particular day was her last day of grace. She paid the premium in time, and ate her supper in the knowledge that a good piece of business had been accomplished that day. She was certain the child could not last until midnight, and in this she was correct, for the little girl died about eight, making both policies operative. Mrs. Breedlove, who had been listening, nodding her head from time to time, said that, in her opinion, Reginald Tasker wasn't at all bad in his specialty. It was true that she ranked him miles below an inspired psychiatrist like Dr. Wertham. She did not even consider him on a par with men like Bolitho and Roughead; but there was a quality of compassionate irony in his best work that distinguished him and made him stand out in his field; then, their preparations for lunch completed, Mrs. Breedlove and Christine joined the men in the living-room. They each took a cocktail, and Monica, her competent ankles crossed firmly, said, \\"Can't you two find something else to talk about?\\" \\"When she says 'something else' she means sex,\\" said Emory. He turned to Christine as though seeking support, but she only smiled and lowered her eyes, her thoughts turning once more to the past. There were unfocused, shapeless things which had troubled her childhood, even when she had been happiest; there was the half-memory of some dreadful event which she had never understood, even at the time of its occurrence, but these things were so formless and far away that they existed in her mind less as certainty than as a feeling of unreasoning dread. She sighed, pressed back her hair, and thought: I think I once lived on a farm somewhere, and that I had brothers and sisters I played with Monica thrust her jaw forward, and then in a quick, spasmodic movement, she jerked her head to the left, as though there were a pebble balanced on her chin, and she strove to toss it over her shoulder. \\"My tic is annoying today,\\" she said. \\"I don't know why, I'm sure.\\" She lit a cigarette and then went on. \\"I talked to Doctor Kettlebaum about my tic, and how to overcome it, but he looked at me in surprise, and said, 'But, dear lady, it's such a young, such an intriguing gesture. Why not leave it the way it is?\\" \\" \\"That Kettlebaum must have been quite a boy,\\" said Emory. Monica agreed placidly. Dr. Kettlebaum had been a wise and a most useful man, she said, her brown eyes swimming with light. Certainly he would have instantly understood both her brother's and Reginald's attempts to transform their unconscious violence into something more acceptable to society: the odd thing was that neither of them had become a surgeon, which would have been far more dramatic than reading and writing murder stories. She had considered these matters thoughtfully in the past, and had come to the conclusion that the greater the impulse, the greater must be the defense against the impulse, if one were to survive as a social animal. She got up to change the angle of the Venetian blind, and Reginald, who had known her all his life, leered horribly and pinched her well-stuffed buttocks. Instantly she went into gales of merriment, her laughter resounding through the apartment. She poured him another cocktail, and when he had taken it, he wound up his facts quickly. Later the child had been taken to a hospital, but only to die there. The doctors, seeing her condition, asked for an autopsy, and the arsenic was quickly found. Again Christine put her hands over her ears. She thought: I'm very vulnerable. I have no strength of character at all. She laughed nervously and said, \\"Oh, please! Please!\\" Reginald laughed with her, patted her shoulder in sympathy, and said that, in his opinion, the case was destined to become one of the classics of its kind. For one thing, there was the thrifty reasoning of Nurse Dennison about payment of the lapsed policy, a circumstance which gave the dreadful affair the wholesome, ordinary note it needed; for another, there was one of those unconsciously humorous asides which seem to distinguish the classic from the lesser crime, for after the autopsy, when her guilt had been established and confessed, Nurse Dennison, in a moment of contrition, said that she regretted the poisoning of her niece far more than she could ever say; she wept and said that she would never have done such a terrible thing, either, if she'd known in advance that such a little bitty old pinch of arsenic could be found later.... At half past two, when lunch had been eaten, Reginald said that he had to go, and while the women straightened up the kitchen, Emory turned on the radio to get the three-o'clock news. The commentator spoke briskly of world conditions for a time, then lowering his voice, he continued gravely. \\"I have been asked to announce that one of the children on the annual outing of the Fem Grammar School was accidentally drowned in the bay this afternoon. The name of the victim has been withheld until the parents are first notified. More news of the tragic affair is expected momentarily.\\" Mrs. Breedlove and Christine came into the living-room at once, and stood anxiously beside the radio. \\"It was not Rhoda,\\" said Mrs. Breedlove in a positive voice. \\"Rhoda is too self-reliant a child.\\" She put her arm around Christine's waist and continued. \\"It was somebody more like myself when I was a child. It was some timid, confused child who was afraid of its own shadow, as I was, and had no self-confidence at all. That does not sound like Rhoda.\\" A little later, toward the end of the broadcast, the announcer returned to the local tragedy; he was now authorized to say that the little victim was Claude Daigle, the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Dwight Daigle of 126 Willow Street. He added details to the story; there was an old wharf on the Fern property, a wharf which had not been used for a long time. It was a mystery how the little boy got on the wharf, for the children had been explicitly told not to go there; but apparently he had managed somehow, for his body had been found there, after the routine check at lunchtime had shown him missing, wedged among the old pilings. The discovery had been made by one of the guards who brought the body ashore, and applied artificial respiration. One mysterious element of the affair was the fact that there were bruises on the forehead and hands of the boy, but these bruises, it was assumed, were caused by the body washing against the pilings. Christine said, \\"Poor child! Poor little boy!\\" The announcer continued. \\"Only a few days before, the little Daigle boy won a gold medal at the closing exercises of the Fern School. He was wearing the medal when last seen, but when his body was discovered, the medal was not found. It was thought the medal had become detached in some manner from his shirt; but although the bottom was searched at that place, the medal had not been located.\\" Christine went to her own apartment immediately. She hoped her child had neither seen the boy brought to shore, nor had watched the efforts of the guards to revive him. If the child were frightened or upset emotionally, she wanted to be there at the door to comfort her. Rhoda was not a sensitive child-certainly, she was not an imaginative one-but the inevitableness of death, she felt, if knowledge came too suddenly, without a proper preparation, could make an impression on even the calmest person; but when Rhoda came in at length, she was as placid, as unruffled, as she had been that morning. She entered so coolly, she asked for a glass of milk and a peanut-butter sandwich with such unconcern, that her mother wondered if she fully understood what had happened. She asked the question in her gentle, serene voice, and Rhoda said yes, she knew all about it, in fact, it was she who suggested that the guards look among the pilings. She had been present when the body was taken from the water; she had seen it laid out on the lawn. Christine put her arms about the stolid child, and said, \\"You must try to get these pictures out of your mind. I don't want you to be frightened or bothered at all. These things happen, and we accept them.\\" Rhoda, enduring her mother's embrace, said in a surprised voice that she wasn't disturbed in the least. She had found the discovery exciting, and the efforts at resuscitation, since she'd never seen such a thing before, had interested her greatly. Christine thought: She's so cool, so impersonal about things that bother others. It was the thing she'd never been able to understand; it was the thing she and Kenneth had once smiled about and called \\"the Rhoda reaction\\" between themselves; but this time she felt uneasiness, a depression she could neither define nor fit into any pattern of reality that she knew. Rhoda pulled away from her mother. She went into her room and began working on her jigsaw puzzle. Later Christine came into the room and put the sandwich and milk on the table. Her face was still puzzled, her brows puckered a little. She said, \\"Just the same, it was an unfortunate thing to see and remember.\\" She kissed the child on the top of her head, and continued. \\"I understand how you really feel, my darling.\\" Rhoda moved a bit of her puzzle into its proper place on the board; then, looking up, she said in a surprised voice, \\"I don't know what you're talking about, Mother. I don't feel any way at all.\\" Christine sighed and went back to the living-room. She tried to read, but she could not concentrate; then Rhoda, as though feeling, if dimly, that she had somehow erred, had done something which, though incomprehensible to her, had strongly displeased her mother, abandoned her puzzle, and approaching the chair where Christine was sitting, she smiled her charming, hesitant smile, her single dimple appearing suddenly. She rubbed her cheek against her mother's in a calculated simulation of affection, laughed coquettishly, and moved away. She's done something naughty, thought Christine; something very naughty indeed to make her go to such trouble to please me. It seemed to her then that her child, as though sensing for the first time that some factor of body or spirit separated her from those around her, tried to conceal the difference by aping the values of others; but since there was nothing spontaneous in her heart to instruct her, she must, instead, consider, debate, experiment, and feel her way cautiously through the values and minds of her models. She approached her mother once more, made an eager sound with her mouth, and kissed Christine on the lips, a thing she had not voluntarily done for a long time. Then, her eyes narrowed, her head thrown back as though for a final glance of affection, she said, \\"What will you give me, if I give you a basket of kisses?\\" It was a game the child had sometimes played with her father, and Christine, knowing the rules so well, feeling a rush of both tenderness and pity, took the little girl in her arms and gave the expected answer: \\"I'll give you a basket of hugs.\\" Later on, when she was bored with her puzzle, Rhoda got out her skates and said she'd like to go to the park. Her mother said she could, and not long afterward, hearing Leroy's scolding, illiterate voice, she went at once to her kitchen window. The man was saying, \\"How come you go skating and enjoying yourself when your poor little schoolmate is still damp from drowning in the bay? Looks to me like you'd be in the house crying your eyes out; either that, or be in church burning a candle in a blue cup.\\" Rhoda stared at the man, but she did not answer. She moved in the direction of the park, and stood there fumbling at the heavy iron gates; but Leroy would not leave her alone. He followed her and said, \\"Ask me, and I'll say you don't even feel sorry about what happened to that little boy.\\" Rhoda, surprised for a moment out of her perpetual calmness, swung her skates from side to side, and said, \\"Why should I feel sorry? It was Claude Daigle that got drowned, not me.\\" Leroy shook his head, smiled with a wry appreciation, and walked away. It was now close to quitting time, and mechanically he began to do those small chores that were required of him before he left for the day, the child's words echoing in his brain. He swept the courtyard and made sure that the basement door was locked securely, and as he did so, he kept repeating to himself, mimicking the child's voice as best he could, \\"Why should I feel sorry? It was Claude Daigle that got drowned, not me.\\" That Rhoda was really something! That little Rhoda didn't care nothing about nobody that lived, not even her good-looking mamma! That Rhoda was a mean little girl if he ever seen one! That little Rhoda was like him in a lot of ways; nobody could put nothing over on her, and nobody could put nothing over on him, either! That was sure. That was something you could bet on.... He lived on General Jackson Street, a good two miles from where he worked, in an unpainted frame house, with his wife, Thelma, and his three gaunt, whining children. The building was on a lot a little lower than the street, and when it rained water stood undrained in a shallow pool under the house. Against the porch, Thelma had made flower beds of beer bottles driven into the earth, but the ground was too damp, and there was too much shade from the big sycamore and the flowering althea bush at the end of the porch, and nothing seemed to grow very well. That night, before he had his supper, he sat on the porch with his wife, his feet resting on the rickety railing. At once he began to tell his wife about the death of the Daigle boy, but Thelma slapped at mosquitoes, yawned, and said, \\"Don't bother to tell me about it. I heard it on the radio.\\" Then, as though his words had reminded her of something, as though silence were a thing she could not endure, she went inside and turned on the radio, selecting one of the dance programs she liked so well. When she returned to the porch, Leroy said, \\"Jesus Christ, can't you turn that thing down some? Can't a man have quiet even in his own house?\\" \\"I like it that way,\\" she said. \\"I like to hear music loud.\\" She was a big, dull woman with the empty face of a fat baby, and as she sat again in her rocking chair, she said petulantly, \\"Quit spitting on them petunias. It was hard enough to coax them up as high as they are now. If you got to spit, sit on the steps.\\" He moved to the steps, grumbling a little. Then, as though he'd forgotten for a moment that his present audience was not one he could impress with his tales of injustice, he said, \\"Pick on me. Pick on me and belittle me like everybody else does. I'm used to it. I can take it. I know I'm nothing but a poor sharecropper.\\" \\"Listen, Leroy,\\" said Thelma patiently. \\"Don't try to tell me them lies, because I know better. You never was a sharecropper, you never even lived in the country, like I did when I was a girl. Your papa wasn't any sharecropper, either. Your papa was a long-shoreman, and you know that as well as I do. Your papa made good money doing it, too. Nobody went hungry or wanted for anything in your papa's house. It's a pity you didn't turn out like him.\\" \\"I didn't have a chance,\\" he said. \\"I didn't have a chance to accomplish nothing.\\" \\"You had chances. You had plenty chances. You're lazy.\\" She fanned herself languidly, pulling down the yoke of her dress; then, thrusting her legs against the banisters, she went on to berate him for his laziness, his lying, his dirtiness, his unwillingness to play up to people who could help him along, her voice carrying well over the radio. The way he acted, the way he insulted people, was about as silly a way as a man could act. No wonder he was always losing his job. For instance, she knew some of the people at the Florabelle who he was always belittling, and they wasn't no way at all like the way he said they was-that Mrs. Breedlove, for instance, was a real nice, jolly woman, and a kindhearted one, too. Maybe if he started doing nice things for people instead of griping all the time; maybe if— Then, in the middle of a sentence, she said quickly, as though bored with her own moral advice, \\"How about a can of beer before I start supper?\\" She got the beer and brought it to the porch. It was still not dark, and the children were playing a game in the backyard, a game that seemed to require a great deal of bickering and screaming. Their voices interfered with the music, and Thelma went into the house and turned up the radio a little more. \\"Jesus Christ!\\" said Leroy, draining his beer. \\"Can't a man get no quietness even at home? If I catch them kids, I'll tan the tar out of them.\\" \\"You won't catch them, though,\\" said Thelma placidly. \\"Them kids run too fast.\\" It was then that Leroy repeated Rhoda's remark about the death of the Daigle boy, and Thelma, laughing a little, threw her empty can high over the fence and into the street. She got up from her chair, pulled her dress away from her sweating buttocks, and said, \\"I think that was a real cute thing to say.\\" \\"That's a real mean little girl,\\" said Leroy. \\"I never seen a little girl like that one in all my born days.\\" He got out his pipe, lit it, and smoked in silence, thinking how the other children who played in the park-them other ones that wasn't mean were all afraid of him, just like he wanted them to be. He could make them jump and run out of the park if he barked at them loud enough; he could even make the little girls cry, and run off to tell their mammas on him, although he had always got out of it so far by being humble, and saying it wasn't so, or that the little girl had been acting ugly-like trampling down the flowers, or trying to scoop goldfish in the lily pond. But that little Rhoda Penmark he couldn't make no impression on at all-at least not so far. But give him time and he would. Give him a little time and he'd make her jump and run from him like the others. He chuckled in anticipation of that pleasant day, and then, defiantly, he spat into his wife's flower bed again. Thelma, slapping at mosquitoes with her palmetto fan, said, \\"Your papa made good money all his life. Your papa was a good provider. That I can say for him, and do so gladly.\\" \\"That little Rhoda Penmark is a mean little girl,\\" said Leroy aloud. \\"But one thing you can say for her, and it's this: she don't blab nothing. Anything that happens, happens between me and her.\\" \\"Listen to me,\\" said Thelma. \\"You leave that little girl alone. You hear me, Leroy? You going to get yourself in trouble if you don't quit messing around with those rich folks and their children. I'm telling you, you going to get yourself in a mess of trouble.\\" \\"I don't do nothing to her,\\" said Leroy, \\"except maybe plague her and tease her a little.\\" \\"I'm telling you,\\" said Thelma. \\"I'm telling you right now.\\" She got up from her chair, called her children, and went into the kitchen to start supper, but Leroy remained on the steps for a time, smoking his pipe and thinking of the little Penmark girl. He would have been surprised to know that, in a sense, he was in love with the little girl, and that his persecution of her, his nagging concern with everything she did, was part of a perverse and frightened courtship. That night after dinner Christine went to the Daigle home on Willow Street, her purpose still not clear in her mind. It was not quite dark when she came up the steps. The sky was soft, dark blue, with only the early stars against the horizon. Mr. Daigle answered the bell. He was a larger image of his son; there was the same pale, blue-veined forehead, the same outthrust jaw and small, puckered underlip. The hand he offered Christine was cold and damp. She gave her name and explained her mission; she wanted to offer her sympathy, and to ask if there were anything she could do; and he said in a voice that trembled in spite of himself, \\"Anyone who knew our son is welcome in this house.\\" Then, opening the door wider, he added, \\"You are the first to call. We are not people who entertain a great deal, and we have not made many friends.\\" The living-room had that depressing look of expensive bad taste. There were beads and bows of ribbon everywhere. Everything was wrong, she thought, the furniture, the colors, the paintings; even the big Oriental rug somehow offended. Mr. Daigle said, \\"You must excuse the looks of the place. We have just returned from the funeral home where they've taken him. Everything is a little disarranged and lacks Mrs. Daigle's touch.\\" Then, standing there beside his visitor in the hall, he said, \\"You must go in and speak to my wife. Perhaps something you say will-perhaps, in some way you can-\\" He knocked on his wife's door, whispering, \\"Hortense! Here's a visitor. It's someone who knew Claude. Her little girl was his classmate, and was with him at the picnic.\\" He went away silently, and Mrs. Daigle sat up on the sofa where she had been resting. Her hair was disarranged, her eyes red and swollen, her mind still a little drugged from the sedatives she had been given. She said, \\"It's not true that Claude was timid and lacked confidence in himself, as some people have said. I'm not saying he was a pushing, aggressive boy, because that wouldn't be true, either. What I mean is, he was a sensitive boy, an artistic child, really. I'd like to show you some of the flower drawings he did so beautifully, but I can't bear to look at them again so soon.\\" She broke off and pressed her face into her pillow. Christine sat beside her and took Mrs. Daigle's plump, ringed hand in her own, pressing it in sympathy. \\"We were so close to each other,\\" Claude's mother said. \\"He said I was his sweetheart, and he would put his little arms about my neck and tell me every thought he had.\\" She paused, unable to go on, and then said, \\"I don't see why they couldn't find the medal. I'm sure the men didn't look hard enough. It was the only thing he'd ever won in his life, and he valued it so much.\\" Then, as though the loss of the medal were more terrible to her than the loss of her son, she wept without constraint, her face pale and bloated, her hair falling limply over her eyes. When she could speak again, she continued. \\"Somebody said the medal must have fallen off his shirt and sunk down into the sand, but as I told my husband, I don't think so. I don't see how the medal could possibly have come off by itself. I pinned the medal on him myself, and the clasp was strong and tight.\\" She wiped her face with a damp towel, and in the silence, Christine said softly, \\"I know. I know so well.\\" \\"The men simply didn't look hard enough,\\" said Mrs. Daigle. \\"They said they'd looked over and over, but I told them to go back and look again. There was such a wonderful bond between us. We were so close to each other. He said I was his only sweetheart, and that he was going to marry me when he grew up. He obeyed me completely. He wouldn't even go to the corner until he'd discussed the matter with me, and I'd told him it was all right. He'd want to be buried with his medal. I know that without being told. I want to please him in every way I can- Will you tell the men to please look for the medal again?\\"","output":"Christine and Leroy are likable characters due to several traits and actions that endear them to readers: # Christine's Traits and Actions: 1. **Empathy and Compassion**: Christine's visit to the Daigle home after their son's tragic death showcases her deep empathy and compassion.

His social commentary and reflection on life: - **\\"'I didn't have a chance,' he said. 'I didn't have a chance to accomplish nothing.'\\"** Although part of a dialogue with Thelma, this quote sheds light on Leroy's feelings of inadequacy and his struggle with societal expectations, making him a character with depth and relatability. 3. His unique perspective on Rhoda and his interactions with her: - **\\"'That little Rhoda Penmark is a mean little girl,' said Leroy. 'But one thing you can say for her, and it's this: she don't blab nothing.'\\"** Despite his rudimentary understanding, Leroy recognizes a kindred spirit in Rhoda, and his observations offer insight into his worldview and the dynamics of his interactions with those around him. # General: Both characters, through their actions and words, convey qualities of likability that are nuanced and layered. Christine's empathy, protective nature, and vulnerability make her a deeply sympathetic figure. Leroy, despite his flaws, is a character who evokes interest due to his complexity, his longing for connection, and his insights into the human condition, albeit from a skewed perspective. These quotes serve to highlight aspects of their personalities that contribute to their likability within the narrative."},{"instruction":"What makes Rhoda so disliked as a character","output":"Rhoda Penmark, as portrayed in the detailed narratives you provided, embodies a character that readers and other characters within the story find disquieting and difficult to empathize with for several reasons. Her attributes and actions contrast sharply with typical expectations of child behavior, making her a figure of unease and, thus, disliked in a narrative context: 1. **Lack of Emotional Depth**: Rhoda exhibits a significant lack of emotional depth and empathy, a trait starkly highlighted in her reactions (or lack thereof) to distressing events. For instance, after Claude Daigle's drowning, she remains \\"placid, unruffled,\\" displaying an unsettling detachment from the tragedy. This unnerving calmness in situations that would typically elicit strong emotional responses from children contributes to her being disliked or feared. - **\\"But when Rhoda came in at length, she was as placid, as unruffled, as she had been that morning.\\"** 2. **Manipulative Demeanor**: Rhoda's interactions often bear the mark of calculation rather than genuine connection. Her displays of affection towards her mother are described as \\"a calculated simulation of affection,\\" hinting at her manipulative nature. Readers and characters alike might find this insincerity and manipulation, especially from a child, to be off-putting. - **\\"She smiled her charming, hesitant smile, her single dimple appearing suddenly. She rubbed her cheek against her mother's in a calculated simulation of affection...\\"** 3. **Sinister Implications**: The narrative insinuates Rhoda's involvement in troubling incidents, most notably the disappearance of the medal following Claude Daigle’s death, and possibly the death itself. Such sinister implications, surrounding a young girl, engender a mix of disbelief, fear, and aversion among other characters and readers by associating her directly with malevolent actions. - **\\"She asked the question in her gentle, serene voice, and Rhoda said yes, she knew all about it, in fact, it was she who suggested that the guards look among the pilings.\\"** 4. **Inherent Coldness and Lack of Guilt**: Rhoda’s interactions and demeanor suggest an inherent coldness and a lack of guilt or remorse. Her responses to Leroy's provocations, saying, “Why should I feel sorry? It was Claude Daigle that got drowned, not me,” exhibit a chilling indifference to the suffering of others, character traits that naturally lead to disapproval and dislike from both the characters within the story and its readers. 5. **Absence of Childlike Innocence**: One of the pivotal reasons Rhoda is so disliked stems from the absence of childlike innocence in her character. Children in literature and societal expectations are often synonymous with purity, curiosity, and warmth – qualities Rhoda markedly lacks. Instead, her actions and persona convey a precociousness and a darkness that is incongruent with her age, making her an unnerving character that defies the natural order and expectations. The character of Rhoda Penmark is engineered to evoke discomfort and unease, serving as a central pivot around which the narrative's tension and horror unfold. These attributes and behaviors starkly deviate from the normative expectations of childhood, making her a character that is not only difficult to like but also serves as a vehicle for exploring themes of inherent evil, the nature of innocence, and the complexities of maternal love within the narrative."},{"instruction":"examine the setting (time and place) and consider the social conventions that govern the actions of the characters. What does an analysis of the setting allow us to understand about the conflicts March asks us to examine?","output":"The narrative details you've provided don't specify the exact setting in terms of time and location. However, given the context and elements mentioned, we can infer that the story occurs in a mid-20th-century American context, likely in a suburban or small-town setting. The social conventions and the societal norms of this period play a crucial role in shaping the characters' actions and the unfolding of the narrative's conflicts. By analyzing these aspects, we can gain deeper insights into the conflicts that the author, often presumed to be William March in discussions about characters like Rhoda Penmark (as in \\"The Bad Seed\\"), asks us to examine. # Social Conventions and Character Actions: 1. **Maternal Responsibility and Feminine Ideals**: The story places significant emphasis on Christine's role as a mother and her responsibilities towards Rhoda. The mid-20th-century setting underscores traditional gender roles, where a woman's worth and moral responsibility are often tied to the home and the upbringing of children. Christine's deep conflicts about Rhoda's behavior and her own lineage reflect societal pressures to produce and nurture \\"ideal\\" children, embodying the virtues of innocence and goodness. 2. **Perception of Childhood Innocence**: The era's idealization of childhood as a bastion of purity and innocence shapes the characters' inability or unwillingness to acknowledge Rhoda's darker traits fully. The social convention that children are inherently good and incapable of true malice creates a conflict for characters like Christine, who must reconcile the unsettling evidence of Rhoda's actions with societal beliefs about childhood. 3. **Community and Isolation**: The setting reflects a community likely bound by tight-knit social expectations and norms, where appearances and reputation are paramount. This context amplifies the isolation Christine and Rhoda feel, as Christine's fears about addressing Rhoda's behavior clash with the imperative to maintain a facade of normalcy for the community's sake. The social stigma associated with acknowledging and addressing mental health or behavioral issues, especially within one's family, exacerbates this isolation. 4. **Authority and Discipline**: Characters like Leroy interact with Rhoda within a framework of authority shaped by societal conventions on adult-child relationships. His perception of and interaction with Rhoda—ranging from fear to a perverse form of affection—highlights the era's attitudes towards discipline, authority, and the presumed natural order within social hierarchies. # Insights Gained from the Setting: An analysis of the setting allows us to understand that the conflicts at the heart of the story are not just personal but deeply rooted in the societal and cultural fabric of the time. The juxtaposition of the idealized notions of family, motherhood, and childhood innocence against the unsettling reality of Rhoda's nature invites readers to question the reliability and completeness of these social constructs. It also points to the broader theme of nature versus nurture, examining to what extent societal standards and expectations can shape or mask inherent personal traits or pathologies. Furthermore, the setting underlines the conflict between private turmoil and public appearance, a theme that resonates with the era's emphasis on conformity and the maintenance of social facades. This dichotomy highlights the destructive potential of adherence to unrealistic societal ideals and the dangers of silence and denial in confronting uncomfortable truths. In summary, by embedding the narrative within a specific socio-cultural context, the story invites a critical examination of the era's social conventions and their impact on individual identity, familial dynamics, and community interactions. It challenges readers to reflect on the often-unacknowledged complexities and darkness that can lurk beneath the surface of societal norms and traditional expectations."},{"instruction":"The novel asks us to examine what is natural and unnatural behavior. An integral part of the debate of natural and unnatural behaviors addresses questions of nature and nurture. How does the novel challenge and/or reinforce our assumptions when we consider these debates?","output":"The narrative premises provided, while not directly specifying a novel, fit closely with themes explored in works like William March's \\"The Bad Seed\\" and similar stories that delve into the complex interplay between innate characteristics (nature) and environmental influences (nurture) in shaping human behavior. Such narratives often serve as a lens through which to examine broader societal debates about what constitutes natural versus unnatural behavior, especially in the context of disturbing actions exhibited by children, like Rhoda. This exploration challenges and, at times, reinforces our assumptions regarding these age-old debates. # Challenging Assumptions: 1. **Innate Evilness**: The character of Rhoda challenges the pervasive assumption that all children are born as blank slates, inherently innocent and good, shaped solely by their upbringing and environmental influences. The unsettling ease and lack of remorse with which Rhoda manipulates and commits heinous acts suggest a predisposition toward malevolence, pushing the reader to consider the possibility of inborn tendencies towards what society deems \\"unnatural\\" behavior. This feeds into the nature side of the debate, suggesting that certain behaviors or traits may indeed be inherent, rather than learned. 2. **Parental Influence and Responsibility**: Christine's struggle with Rhoda's behavior and the revelation of her own biological lineage highlight the nurture aspect. It presents the argument that environmental factors, including parenting styles and family dynamics, significantly impact a child's development. However, the narrative complicates this view by showing Christine's genuine love, care, and the absence of negative influences in Rhoda's upbringing, thus challenging the assumption that nurture alone can mold an individual's disposition. 3. **Societal Denial**: The collective refusal of other characters to acknowledge Rhoda's true nature underscores society's reticence to accept that children can be capable of \\"unnatural\\" behavior. This resistance challenges readers to confront their own biases and the comforting yet possibly naive belief in the universal innocence of childhood, questioning whether such assumptions are grounded in reality or societal ideals. # Reinforcing Assumptions: 1. **The Role of Environment**: While the narrative leans heavily into the nature aspect with Rhoda's character, it also reinforces the importance of nurture through its examination of societal and parental reactions to her behavior. The environment's failure to recognize and appropriately address Rhoda's actions—partly due to societal norms and expectations—suggests that nurture plays a crucial role in either mitigating or exacerbating inherent tendencies. 2. **Malleability of Youth**: Through characters like Leroy and the school environment, the novel hints at the potential for external influences to shape behaviors and attitudes in youth, reinforcing the idea that children are receptive to and molded by their surroundings. Thus, while Rhoda's actions challenge the assumption of inherent innocence, the narrative context in which she operates nods to the significant impact of environmental factors. In conclusion, in examining the nature versus nurture debate through the lens of natural and unnatural behavior, the narrative serves both to challenge and reinforce our assumptions. By presenting a complex character like Rhoda, who embodies traits that defy simple categorization as products of either heredity or environment, the novel prompts readers to reconsider the binary opposition of nature and nurture. It suggests, instead, that human behavior is a product of an intricate and often inseparable blend of both inherent predispositions and external influences, pushing the debate into more nuanced territory beyond conventional assumptions."},{"instruction":"System:'kız gibi davranmanı istiyorum' User:OHA Model:Bu isteğine ne denli güvenerek ve istekli bir şekilde bağlandığını anlayabiliyorum.

The question of whether God exists is one of the most profound questions humans have pondered throughout history, and it's important to note that both belief in God (or gods) and atheism can't be proved or disproved with absolute certainty using the scientific method or pure logic. This is primarily because the concept of God typically involves supernatural elements that lie beyond empirical investigation and objective verification. However, I can outline some of the main arguments and perspectives from the field of philosophy and science that people often use in discussions about the existence of God: 1. **Empirical evidence and falsifiability**: From a scientific standpoint, assertions or hypotheses should be based on empirical evidence and be falsifiable. Since God is often defined in ways that are not empirically testable, the existence of God is not a hypothesis in the scientific sense. This leads some to conclude that without empirical evidence, belief in God's existence lacks scientific support. 2. **The problem of evil**: Some argue that the existence of evil and suffering in the world is incompatible with an all-powerful, all-knowing, and benevolent God, as proposed in many religions. Philosophers like Epicurus have framed this argument, questioning how evil can exist if God has the power to prevent it, knows it exists, and is good. 3. **Occam's razor**: This principle suggests that when presented with competing hypotheses that predict the same thing, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Some apply this principle to argue that naturalistic explanations for the universe's origin and life's complexity are simpler and require fewer assumptions than theistic explanations, which include the existence of an all-powerful deity. 4. **Naturalistic explanations**: Advances in science have provided naturalistic explanations for many phenomena that were once attributed to gods, such as the formation of the universe (Big Bang theory), the development of life on Earth (theory of evolution), and the workings of the universe (laws of physics). Some argue that these explanations make the God hypothesis unnecessary. Counterarguments from theistic perspectives often include: - Arguments for the necessity of a first cause or unmoved mover (cosmological argument), - The apparent design in the universe suggesting a designer (teleological argument/design argument), - Subjective experiences of the divine, - The existence of moral absolutes as evidence of a moral lawgiver, - Historical claims or miracles that they believe have no natural explanation. Ultimately, whether God exists is a deeply personal question that individuals explore through the lenses of faith, culture, personal experience, philosophy, and science. Many find meaning, comfort, and purpose in their belief in God, while others find those same qualities in secular worldviews. Respectful dialogue and exploration of these perspectives can enrich understanding, but it's important to recognize the limits of what can be conclusively proved or disproved in this realm."},{"instruction":"The graph has 7 vertices namely v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7. v1 has an outgoing edge to v2 at a distance of 4 and outgoing edge to v6 at a distance of 10. v2 has an outgoing edge to v1 at a distance of 3 and outgoing edge to v4 at a distance of 18. v3 has an outgoing edge to v2 at a distance of 6. v4 has an outgoing edge to v2 at a distance of 5, outgoing edge to 3 at a distance of 15, outgoing edge to v5 at a distance of 2, outgoing edge to v6 at a distance of 19 and outgoing edge to v7 at a distance of 5. v5 has an outgoing edge to v3 at a distance of 12 and outgoing edge to v4 at a distance of 1. v6 has an outgoing edge to v7 at a distance of 10. v7 has an outgoing edge to v4 at a distance of 8.

Hint: You can consider each array access to P[i][j] as a basic operation.","output":"To demonstrate that the given Print Shortest Path algorithm has linear-time complexity, we need to understand the algorithm’s execution in relation to its input size, which in this context is the number of vertices (n). For the input graph described, we have (n = 7). The algorithm's core functionality centers around recursively finding the path from a source node (q) to a destination node (r) using an intermediate node array (P). The key observation here is that the recursive calls depend on the entries of the (P) matrix, which stores the intermediate vertices on the shortest path from (q) to (r). # Key Observations: - **Recursive Nature**: The recursion depth and the number of recursive calls are directly proportional to the number of intermediate nodes in the path from (q) to (r). - **Bounded Recursion**: Despite the recursive structure, the maximum number of recursive calls does not exceed (n-1) for any pair ((q, r)). This is because, in the worst case, the path could traverse through all other vertices, making (n-1) intermediary stops (vertices). - **Linear Recursion in Terms of Vertices**: In practical terms, for any (q) to (r) path, the algorithm might call itself recursively for each vertex that acts as an intermediate node in the path. However, the path cannot visit more vertices than there are in the graph without revisiting any (avoiding cycles, as this concerns the shortest path). - **Access to P[i][j]**: Each recursive call effectively involves a constant-time operation (accessing an element in the (P) matrix). # Analyzing Complexity: - In the worst-case scenario, for traversing from any given vertex to another, the algorithm might need to inspect paths that sequentially involve each other vertex as an intermediate node. However, you cannot have more intermediate nodes than (n-1), where (n) is the number of vertices. - Given that each recursive call represents a basic operation (primarily the access to (P[i][j])), and recognizing that the maximum depth of recursion (hence, the total number of operations) is bounded by the number of vertices (n), it is clear that the overall complexity of executing this algorithm -- in terms of basic operations -- scales linearly with the number of vertices. # Conclusion: The Print Shortest Path algorithm demonstrates a linear-time complexity, (O(n)), with respect to the number of vertices in the graph. This linear behavior stems from the fact that the number of recursive operations (each considered a basic operation) required to print the shortest path between any two vertices is directly proportional to the number of vertices in the path, which in the worst case can be (n-1). This direct proportionality to (n) for operational count signifies linear complexity."},{"instruction":"小红书已经有蒲公英平台，第三方做达人和商家撮合还有市场空间和价值吗","output":"小红书的蒲公英平台主要为了加强和内容创作者及品牌的合作，它为商家和达人提供了一个官方的流量和交易对接平台。然而，即使有了这样的官方平台，第三方做达人和商家撮合的服务仍然存在市场空间和价值，原因如下： 1. **专业服务与个性化定制**：第三方平台可能会提供更加专业或个性化的服务，针对不同品牌和创作者的独特需求提供定制化解决方案，这是官方平台可能无法做到的精细化管理和服务。 2. **更广泛的达人资源**：第三方平台可能会拥有更广泛的达人资源库。由于它们不局限于一个社交平台，所以能够跨平台为品牌匹配最合适的内容创作者。 3. **更灵活的合作模式**：官方平台可能在合作条款和条件上相对固定，而第三方平台则可以提供更灵活的合作模式，满足不同规模和类型品牌的需求。 4. **技术和数据分析支持**：部分第三方平台可能提供更先进的数据分析工具和技术支持，帮助品牌和达人更精准地评估合作效果，优化未来的营销策略。 5. **个性化内容创作与推广策略**：第三方平台可以根据品牌特定的目标受众和市场定位，制定更加个性化和创新的内容创作与推广策略，这有助于提高营销的有效性。 虽然小红书的蒲公英平台为商家和达人提供了便利的合作渠道，但由于市场需求的多样性以及不断变化的内容营销环境，第三方平台仍然具有其独特的价值和市场空间。因此，对于那些希望获得更加专业服务、寻求更广泛达人资源或者需要个性化营销策略的品牌而言，第三方撮合平台仍然是一个值得考虑的选择。"},{"instruction":"Thread Title: New Nicktoons UK Schedule Changes - Monster Block Incoming! — SpongeBobFan44: Hey everyone, have you seen the latest Nicktoons UK schedule? Looks like Bunsen is a Beast, Danny Phantom, and Avatar have been replaced. Now there’s a whole Monster Block with Monster High, AAHH! Real Monsters, and Monster Allergy. What’s up with that? — LoudHouseLover21: Yeah, I noticed that too! I’m kinda bummed about Danny Phantom and Avatar being replaced, those were my go-to shows after school. The Monster Block sounds interesting though, haven’t seen Monster Allergy in ages. But I’ll miss my daily Avatar fix for sure. — PokeMaster98: Did anyone catch that Pokemon Advanced is replacing XYZ next week? They keep switching these up. I was really getting into the XYZ series. Hopefully, Advanced will be just as good. At least the SpongeBob and Loud House mix is still the same. — MonsterManiax: Totally psyched for the Monster Block! AAHH! Real Monsters is a classic, and I’ve been a Monster High fan for years. It’s a nice switch-up, but I do get why some might miss the old lineup. Variety is the spice of life, though, right? — NickNostalgia: Can’t believe they’re sidelining Danny Phantom and Avatar. Those are some seriously iconic shows. The Monster Block could be cool for a bit, but I hope they bring back the classics soon. Also, mixing in more Pokémon never hurts, but the constant series switching is a bit much. — AvatarAangFan: This is really disappointing. Replacing Avatar? That show has such a strong fan base and it’s timeless. I understand trying out new themes like the Monster Block, but Avatar should be a staple! Guess it’s time to dust off the old DVDs. — GhoulGirl: Honestly, I’m here for the Monster Block! It’s perfect for the Halloween season if they decide to keep it around for a bit. Plus, Monster High has a lot of fans that will be thrilled. Monster Allergy is an underrated gem too. Still, the absence of Danny Phantom seems like a missed opportunity during a monster-themed block. — Pikachu4Ever: Welp, there goes my daily XYZ binge. Pokemon Advanced is okay, but XYZ had some epic battles. Hope Advanced has some good stuff too. At least SpongeBob and The Loud House are untouched. They kinda act as the backbone for Nicktoons’ schedule anyway. — DannyPhanatic: Removing Danny Phantom just when I thought there was a resurgence in interest… Not cool, Nicktoons UK, not cool.

Grizzly Tales always felt like a show that was underappreciated, thrown in to check a box rather than celebrated for its storytelling. Here’s hoping it finds its way back to a more prominent slot.

Noticed they’ve been trying to boost its popularity by pairing it up with other monster-themed shows. Even saw Aaahh!!! Real Monsters (ARM) got brought back into the mix. Think this will give MA the bump it needs? — GarfieldFanatic: Honestly, it’s a smart move but The Garfield Show has its own loyal audience because, well, it’s Garfield. MA has its charm, but it’s fighting an uphill battle. Monster mania is cool, but does it have what it takes to stand next to Pokémon? Pairing it up with classics like ARM is clever, but only time will tell. — PokeMasterX: Every show has its day, but Pokémon’s throne is pretty much untouchable. That said, MA has been getting more attention since the monster-themed programming kicked in. The pairings make for a fun, themed block that’s been quite enjoyable. It certainly sets the right atmosphere for MA to thrive. — AaahhFan: Thrilled to see ARM back in the lineup! If anything, I tune in for that nostalgia hit and stick around for MA. It’s a fun show with a lot of potentials. This strategy could introduce it to new viewers who come for the monsters and stay for the story. — AnimationAnalyst: The tactic here is pretty clear: they’re attempting to create a monster universe of sorts to leverage the thematic continuity between shows. MA benefits from this association, particularly when paired with well-loved shows. It’s a solid strategy for audience crossover but boosting it past The Garfield Show—that’s a tall order. — MonsterKid2000: MA has always been underrated IMO. Pairing it with the likes of ARM just highlights what fans of monster genres enjoy. It’s a smart play, and I’ve definitely found myself watching more of it since the pairings started. Plus, who doesn’t love a good monster mash-up? — ClassicToonLover: Is it just me, or have they been pushing MA really hard lately? I mean, I appreciate the effort to diversify, but I worry that forcing it into these blocks might deter some folks. It should stand on its own merits. That being said, the monster block has been entertaining. — DigitalDuo: At the end of the day, it’s all about content consumption. By cleverly packaging MA with thematic shows, they’re not just trying to boost its viewership but also enhancing the overall viewing experience. It’s a smart way to capitalize on monster mania, inviting viewers to dive deeper into that world. — MonsterHighway: Love or hate the strategy, it’s definitely got people talking about MA more. Plus, seeing ARM again is a total bonus. There’s a certain genius in revitalizing interest in monster themes this way. MA might just surprise us and climb up the ranks. — Thread Moderator: Interesting points all around! It’s great to see such varied perspectives on the network’s strategy with Monster Allergy and its pairing with other monster-centric shows. This could indeed be the beginning of a new era for monster-themed programming. Let’s keep the conversation respectful and see how this monster block evolves! Write a blog post saying the usual channel branding revolves around anthropomorphic pixels, but it looks like for the first week they are including characters from shows interacting with the Pixels, Also over on Five, their usual \\"emotions\\" idents are also playing around for April Fools","output":"Blog Title: Pixels Come to Life and Emotions Play Tricks: A Whimsical Week on TV April Fools' Day may traditionally play its pranks and tricks for just 24 hours, but this year, a couple of favorite UK TV channels are extending the whimsy and wonder for a full week, bringing a delightful tweak to their branding that has viewers both amused and engaged. Nicktoons, known for its vibrant and cheeky anthropomorphic pixels, and Channel Five, with its \\"emotions\\" idents capturing viewers' moods and sentiments, are pushing the envelope of creativity and viewer interaction. **Nicktoons: Where Pixels and Characters Collide** Normally, the Nicktoons channel branding is a playful dance of colorful, anthropomorphic pixels that bounce across the screen, bringing a sense of fun and digital savvy to the viewing experience. But for this special week, Nicktoons is introducing a fascinating twist: beloved characters from some of its most popular shows are stepping into the pixel world, interacting with the bouncing bits in ways that delight and surprise viewers. From SpongeBob SquarePants' enthusiastic chase after a particularly elusive pixel, to The Loud House siblings teaming up to corral a group of them, this unique brand interaction breathes new life into both the characters and the pixels themselves. It's as if the pixels have become part of the shows' universes, blending the digital world with the cartoon realms in a seamless and engaging way. This innovative approach not only adds a fresh layer of fun to viewer's experiences but also smartly nods to the increasingly digital world we live in. **Over on Five: Emotions Have Never Been So Playful** Channel Five, with its emotionally resonant idents, typically aims to mirror the vast array of viewer sentiments, from joy and serenity to anticipation and exhilaration. However, for this week, the channel is taking a playful detour, using April Fools' as a springboard for creativity. Their \\"emotions\\" idents are getting an unexpected twist, incorporating lighthearted pranks and surprising turns that keep viewers guessing. Imagine tuning in for your evening relaxation, expecting the usual calm serenity ident, only to find it playfully interrupted by a burst of joyous laughter. Or, settling in for some exhilarating action, only to be met with an ident exuding a mock-serious tone before breaking into a whimsical dance. This slightly surreal, playful approach perfectly captures the spirit of April Fools', reminding viewers not to take things too seriously and to expect the unexpected. **Conclusion: A Week of Whimsy and Wonder** This unique approach by both Nicktoons and Channel Five showcases how TV channels can step beyond the traditional boundaries of branding to create something truly memorable and engaging. By infusing their idents and branding with characters and emotions that interact with the elements viewers have come to know, these channels are not just creating a viewing experience; they're curating an atmosphere of joy, surprise, and playful engagement. As we navigate through this week of whimsical branding, it's refreshing to see how creativity can turn even the routine aspects of channel branding into a source of delight. Perhaps the biggest takeaway from this playful experiment is the reminder that in the world of television, as in life, there's always room for a little extra magic and a lot more smiles."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo where MH becomes normal Nick exclusive again, and ARM goes back into the vault, one show takes up both their slots, Meanwhile Pokemon seems to be fighting with The Garfield Show for the 10am slot","output":"Thread Title: MH and ARM Shelved, Single Show Fills the Gap, and the 10am Slot Showdown! ToonTactics101: Hey folks, just saw the latest schedule shift. Looks like Monster High and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters are going back into the Nick vault, and a single new show is taking up both their slots. Surprisingly swift change. Also, there's a bit of a showdown brewing for the coveted 10am slot between Pokémon and The Garfield Show. What are your thoughts on these shake-ups? PixelPundit: Really disappointed to see ARM shelved again—felt like it was just hitting its stride with a new generation of fans. MH being a Nick exclusive was nice while it lasted. As for the 10am slot...I'm team Pokémon all the way. It's a staple morning kickstart! GarfieldGuru: I understand the disappointment around MH and ARM, but let's talk about The Garfield Show potentially losing the 10am slot. That show has humor, heart, and lasagna! It’s a perfect late morning chill-out before the day ramps up. Pokémon is cool, but Garfield brings the laughs. AnimateThis: Surprised no one's talking about the new show taking MH and ARM's place. Anyone got the inside scoop on what it's about? With two big slots to fill, it's gotta bring something special. As for Pokémon vs. Garfield, my money's on Pokémon. It’s got that global fanbase firepower. MonstrousFan: Sad to see Monster High go back to being an occasional treat rather than a schedule staple. It was nice having consistent new monster content. And the ARM nostalgia will be missed. Whoever's deciding these things, please consider bringing them back sometime! BattleNostalgia: The 10am slot war is fascinating. Pokémon offers action and adventure, while Garfield delivers humor and a more laid-back vibe. It’s like choosing between coffee and hot chocolate for your morning routine. Personally, I enjoy the variety, but if I had to choose, Pokémon's excitement gets my day going. ToonAnalyzer: As for the new show taking over MH and ARM’s slots, it’s a bold move by Nick. Those spots were pretty popular, so this new entry has big shoes to fill. It'll be interesting to see how it aims to capture the audience's attention. LazyLasagna: Garfield at 10am is a tradition for me. It's the perfect background noise while I start my day. Pokémon is great and all, but there's something about Garfield's cynicism that resonates with my morning mood. Hoping it keeps its spot. PokeChampion: Pokémon has consistently attracted viewers of all ages, making it a perfect fit for the 10am slot. It's more than just battles; it's about friendship, adventure, and growth. Plus, with new seasons and regions, it always feels fresh. Thread Moderator: Great discussion, everyone! It's clear there are varied opinions on both the schedule changes and the 10am slot competition. Remember, networks often experiment with their lineups based on several factors, including viewer feedback. So, who knows? Your favorites might return, or you might find a new love in the upcoming show.

There's some shuffling going on, but at least they're still accessible. RetroToonLover: Thanks for the update, CartoonCraze123! Good to know MH and ARM aren't totally gone. Also, I caught wind that Pokémon snagged the 10am slot over The Garfield Show. Pretty big win for Pokémon fans! Looks like it's shaping up to be a cornerstone of the morning schedule again. NickScheduleSleuth: Not sure if you all heard, but the show that's taking over the Monster High and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters slots is doubling up. Seems like they're really betting on this newcomer to draw in viewers. Any guesses on what it might be? PixelAdventureFan: Interesting times at Nick! While I'll miss ARM's unique charm on the regular, Paramount+ isn’t a bad spot for it. And this new show better be worth the hype. Pokémon at 10am feels right, though—nothing beats starting the day with a little adventure.

TMNT had a good run, but I'm intrigued to see what this new program has in store for us. AnimationAddict: Wait, TMNT: Fast Forward is leaving?! Bummer, I was really enjoying that series. But in the world of network TV, change is the only constant, I guess. As for the 10am slot, Pokémon winning out makes sense. It’s practically a global phenomenon, after all. GarfieldFanatic: Slightly gutted about The Garfield Show losing out to Pokémon, but I get it. On the bright side, at least Garfield is still on the schedule at other times. Curious about this new show doubling up, too—Nick must have a lot of faith in it. NicktoonsNostalgia: Really hoping this new show lives up to the hype. It's not easy replacing classics like MH and ARM, not to mention taking over TMNT's slot. As for Pokémon at 10am, that's a win in my book. Pokémon has a way of bringing fans together like no other show. Thread Moderator: Love seeing all the passionate discussions!

Sample within two standard deviations: Randomly select another sample of non-fraudulent cases that fall within two standard deviations from the mean. This sample will capture a wider range of normal behavior, including cases that are slightly less common but still considered within the expected range. 4.

This method is instrumental in capturing the variability present within non-fraudulent cases while zeroing in on the most representative samples. To operationalize this sampling technique, the preliminary step involves crunching the numbers to derive the mean and standard deviation for each pertinent feature or characteristic in the non-fraudulent cases (where fraud equals zero). These statistical metrics form the bedrock for cherry-picking representative samples. This process unfolds in a graduated manner, starting with sampling within one standard deviation wherein a sample of non-fraudulent cases within this range - considered the most typical and widespread instances of normality - is randomly chosen. Subsequently, the spectrum is broadened by selecting another sample within two standard deviations and yet another within three standard deviations, each accommodating cases that are progressively less common but still align with expected behavior. The amalgamation of these samples from within one, two, and three standard deviations culminates in the creation of a composite, representative non-fraudulent cluster housing a diverse array of normal behaviors, from the most prevalent examples to the less frequent yet legitimate instances. Employing this sampling approach ensures that the non-fraudulent cluster enshrines a comprehensive spectrum of normal behaviors, all while accounting for both typical and rarer legitimate cases. Noteworthy components to bear in mind in the application of this technique encompass meticulous feature selection to ensure the most illuminating characteristics are captured, the determination of suitable sample sizes for each standard deviation range based on total non-fraudulent cases, and the cautious treatment of outliers beyond three standard deviations, which may signify anomalies or hints of fraudulent activities. Ultimately, through the application of this statistical sampling method anchored in standard deviations from the mean, a true-to-life non-fraudulent cluster is fashioned, allowing the fraud detection model to glean insights from a diverse range of valid cases, while placing emphasis on the most representative illustrations. By following this method diligently, a holistic view of normal behavior is achieved, supplemented by measures to handle outliers wisely and effectively."},{"instruction":"rewrite this to make it easier to understand for business: Your suggestion of using statistical sampling techniques based on standard deviations from the mean is a valid approach to ensure that the non-fraudulent cluster accurately represents the expected, normal behavior. This method can help capture the variability within the non-fraudulent cases while focusing on the most representative samples. Here's how you can apply this sampling technique: 1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation: For each relevant feature or attribute in the non-fraudulent cases (fraud=0), calculate the mean and standard deviation. These statistical measures will serve as the basis for selecting representative samples. 2. Sample within one standard deviation: Randomly select a sample of non-fraudulent cases that fall within one standard deviation from the mean. This sample will represent the most typical and common instances of normal behavior. The majority of non-fraudulent cases are expected to lie within this range, assuming a normal distribution. 3. Sample within two standard deviations: Randomly select another sample of non-fraudulent cases that fall within two standard deviations from the mean. This sample will capture a wider range of normal behavior, including cases that are slightly less common but still considered within the expected range. 4. Sample within three standard deviations: Randomly select a third sample of non-fraudulent cases that fall within three standard deviations from the mean. This sample will include cases that are relatively rare but still considered within the realm of normal behavior. By including this sample, you account for the less frequent but still legitimate instances of non-fraudulent behavior. 5. Combine the samples: Combine the three samples (within one, two, and three standard deviations) to form the representative non-fraudulent cluster. This cluster will contain a diverse range of normal behavior, capturing the most common instances as well as the less frequent but still valid cases. By using this sampling approach, you ensure that the non-fraudulent cluster includes a representative range of normal behavior. The samples within one standard deviation capture the most typical cases, while the samples within two and three standard deviations account for the less common but still legitimate instances. However, it's important to consider a few aspects when applying this technique: - Feature selection: Carefully select the relevant features or attributes that best characterize normal behavior. Domain expertise and statistical analysis can help identify the most informative features for distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases. - Sample size: Determine an appropriate sample size for each standard deviation range based on the total number of non-fraudulent cases and the desired level of representation. Ensure that the samples are large enough to capture the variability within each range adequately. - Outlier handling: Be cautious when including cases beyond three standard deviations, as they may represent outliers or anomalies. While some outliers may still be legitimate instances of normal behavior, others could be potential indicators of fraudulent activity. Domain expertise and statistical techniques like the Mahalanobis distance (De Maesschalck et al., 2000) can help identify and handle outliers appropriately. By employing this statistical sampling technique based on standard deviations from the mean, you can create a representative non-fraudulent cluster that accurately captures the expected, normal behavior. This approach ensures that the fraud detection model learns from a diverse range of legitimate cases while focusing on the most representative instances.

Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 50(1), 1-18.","output":"Using statistical sampling techniques based on standard deviations from the mean is a good way to make sure that the set of non-fraudulent examples accurately show the normal, expected behavior. This method helps to capture the variations in the non-fraudulent cases while focusing on the most common examples. Here's how you can put this into practice: First, calculate the average and the standard deviation for each important feature in the non-fraudulent cases. This will provide the basis for selecting examples that represent the average behavior. Then, choose a sample of non-fraudulent cases that fall within one standard deviation from the average. These examples will be the most typical and expected instances of normal behavior. It's expected that most non-fraudulent cases will fall within this range if things follow a normal pattern. Next, select another sample of non-fraudulent cases that fall within two standard deviations from the average. This sample will cover a wider range of normal behaviors, including instances that are less common but still within the reasonable range. Following this, pick a third sample of non-fraudulent cases that fall within three standard deviations from the average. This sample will include instances that are less frequent but still considered normal. By combining these samples from within one, two, and three standard deviations, you can create a group of non-fraudulent examples that represent a variety of normal behaviors, ranging from the most common to the less frequent but still valid cases. This ensures that the non-fraudulent set includes a representative range of normal behavior. It’s also important to consider a few things when using this technique: carefully select the relevant features that best characterize normal behavior, decide on an appropriate sample size for each standard deviation based on the total non-fraudulent cases, and handle any cases beyond three standard deviations with caution as they could be outliers. By using this sampling method based on standard deviations from the mean, you can create a group of non-fraudulent examples that accurately reflect the expected, normal behavior. This way, the fraud detection model can learn from various legitimate cases while focusing on the most typical instances."},{"instruction":"give me the best argument for why god doesnt exist","output":"The question of whether God exists is one of the most profound and challenging topics in philosophy, theology, and science. People hold a wide range of beliefs for and against the existence of God, often deeply rooted in personal, cultural, philosophical, or empirical grounds. Arguing against the existence of God, therefore, can take various forms, depending on one's approach. Here, I will present a few key arguments from a philosophical and empirical perspective while acknowledging the complexity of the debate and the respectful acknowledgment of differing views. # 1. The Problem of Evil One of the most powerful arguments against the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God is the problem of evil. The argument goes as follows: - If God exists, then God is omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), and omnibenevolent (all-good). - If an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God exists, then evil does not. - There is evil in the world. - Therefore, an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God does not exist. The existence of unnecessary suffering and evil in the world is difficult to reconcile with the notion of a God who is simultaneously all-powerful, all-knowing, and wholly good. Philosophers and theologians have proposed various solutions to this problem, but for many, the existence and extent of suffering in the world are seen as incompatible with the existence of such a deity. # 2. The Lack of Empirical Evidence Another argument centers on the lack of empirical evidence for God's existence. This argument follows the principles of empirical verification and scientific inquiry, which rely on observable, measurable evidence to substantiate claims: - Scientific methods emphasize the importance of empirical evidence for confirming the existence of phenomena. - Despite extensive theological, philosophical, and anecdotal discussions, there is no direct empirical evidence of God's existence that meets scientific criteria. - Therefore, from a scientific perspective, the existence of God lacks substantiation. This argument is often linked to a more general philosophical position known as naturalism, which holds that everything arises from natural properties and causes, and supernatural explanations are not needed to understand the universe. # 3. Occam's Razor Occam's Razor is a principle that suggests when presented with competing hypotheses that make equal predictions, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. This principle is often invoked in discussions about the existence of God: - The existence of God requires additional assumptions about the nature of reality (e.g., the existence of the supernatural, the ability of a deity to exist outside of time and space, etc.). - A naturalistic explanation of the universe requires fewer assumptions, relying only on natural laws and observable phenomena. - Therefore, applying Occam’s Razor, the naturalistic explanation should be preferred, suggesting that the hypothesis of God's existence is not necessary to explain the universe. # Conclusion It's important to recognize that arguments against the existence of God often rely on certain epistemological perspectives (what we can know) and ontological stands (what kinds of things exist). Furthermore, belief in God for many is not solely grounded in empirical evidence or logical deduction but also involves aspects of faith, personal experience, and cultural identity. As such, discussions around the existence of God are not only intellectual but deeply personal and meaningful."},{"instruction":"Thread Title: New Nicktoons UK Schedule Changes - Monster Block Incoming! — SpongeBobFan44: Hey everyone, have you seen the latest Nicktoons UK schedule? Looks like Bunsen is a Beast, Danny Phantom, and Avatar have been replaced. Now there’s a whole Monster Block with Monster High, AAHH! Real Monsters, and Monster Allergy. What’s up with that? — LoudHouseLover21: Yeah, I noticed that too! I’m kinda bummed about Danny Phantom and Avatar being replaced, those were my go-to shows after school. The Monster Block sounds interesting though, haven’t seen Monster Allergy in ages. But I’ll miss my daily Avatar fix for sure. — PokeMaster98: Did anyone catch that Pokemon Advanced is replacing XYZ next week? They keep switching these up. I was really getting into the XYZ series. Hopefully, Advanced will be just as good. At least the SpongeBob and Loud House mix is still the same. — MonsterManiax: Totally psyched for the Monster Block! AAHH! Real Monsters is a classic, and I’ve been a Monster High fan for years. It’s a nice switch-up, but I do get why some might miss the old lineup. Variety is the spice of life, though, right? — NickNostalgia: Can’t believe they’re sidelining Danny Phantom and Avatar. Those are some seriously iconic shows. The Monster Block could be cool for a bit, but I hope they bring back the classics soon. Also, mixing in more Pokémon never hurts, but the constant series switching is a bit much. — AvatarAangFan: This is really disappointing. Replacing Avatar? That show has such a strong fan base and it’s timeless. I understand trying out new themes like the Monster Block, but Avatar should be a staple! Guess it’s time to dust off the old DVDs. — GhoulGirl: Honestly, I’m here for the Monster Block! It’s perfect for the Halloween season if they decide to keep it around for a bit. Plus, Monster High has a lot of fans that will be thrilled. Monster Allergy is an underrated gem too. Still, the absence of Danny Phantom seems like a missed opportunity during a monster-themed block. — Pikachu4Ever: Welp, there goes my daily XYZ binge. Pokemon Advanced is okay, but XYZ had some epic battles. Hope Advanced has some good stuff too. At least SpongeBob and The Loud House are untouched. They kinda act as the backbone for Nicktoons’ schedule anyway. — DannyPhanatic: Removing Danny Phantom just when I thought there was a resurgence in interest… Not cool, Nicktoons UK, not cool. He’s practically a monster-fighting hero himself. Would’ve fit right in with the block. Guess I’ll have to stick to fan communities for my ghost boy fix. — RealMonstersFan: Finally, AAHH! Real Monsters is getting the love it deserves! That show was way ahead of its time. Sad to see some favorites go, but this does shake things up. Maybe it’ll introduce these classics to a new audience. Can’t wait to see Ickis, Oblina, and Krumm back on my screen! — Thread Moderator: Thanks for all your insights, everyone! It’s clear there are mixed feelings about the schedule change. For those missing the old shows, remember, schedules often rotate, so they might be back sooner than you think. For now, why not give the new Monster Block a chance? You might find a new favorite! — Write a tweet saying “It’s Zick over Danny, If the Monster Block isn’t your thing then Ash is jetting off to Hoenn next week” “It’s Zick over Danny in the latest Nicktoons switch-up! 📺 If the Monster Block lineup isn’t quite your vibe, gear up as Ash heads off to Hoenn next week in Pokémon Advanced! ✈️🍃 #Nicktoons #MonsterBlock #PokémonAdvanced” Write a forum convo where Grizzly Tales seems to be losing half its time slots at late nights (show only airs to fulfil independent quotas, as it is produced by Honeycomb Animation and CITV) replaced with My Dad the Rockstar (could have sworn it would have been Pokemon or MonAll) Thread Title: Grizzly Tales Slotted Down? My Dad the Rockstar Takes Over! — TalesOfTerror: Did anyone else notice Grizzly Tales got slashed in half on the late-night roster? I thought it was a solid choice for those looking to enjoy something a bit different. Now it’s just to fill those independent quotas since it’s from Honeycomb Animation and aired on CITV. Replaced by My Dad the Rockstar? Was expecting more Pokémon or even Monster Allergy to take its place. Thoughts? — RockstarRiffs: Honestly didn’t expect My Dad the Rockstar to make a comeback, especially not at the expense of Grizzly Tales. I’ve got nothing against it, but the shift is…unexpected. Thought they’d double down on Pokémon or something more in line with current trends. — AnimationAdvocate: It’s a shame to see Grizzly Tales pushed back. I get the vibe they’re only keeping it to meet quotas, which feels a tad disrespectful to the show. As for My Dad the Rockstar, it’s an interesting choice. Maybe it’s a play for nostalgia? — QuotaConundrum: Let’s face facts, folks. Filling quotas is a big part of scheduling decisions, and Grizzly Tales fits that niche for them. My Dad the Rockstar coming in might just be their way of shaking things up. Perhaps it tested well in groups we’re not aware of? — LateNightLurker: Grizzly Tales was my late-night guilty pleasure! ☹️ The eerie vibe was perfect right before bed. My Dad the Rockstar is okay, but it doesn’t hit the same spot. Seems like a weird choice to replace something so unique. — NostalgiaKnight: Wait, people are upset about My Dad the Rockstar? I loved that show! Sure, it’s sad about Grizzly Tales, but isn’t variety the spice of life? Maybe they’re just trying to appeal to a broader audience at the late-night slot. — MonsterAllergyFan: Really thought they’d pick Monster Allergy to replace it, considering the Monster Block and all. Strange decision. My Dad the Rockstar has its charm, but feels off for the late-night vibe Grizzly Tales offered. — GrizzlyGuru: Disappointed but not surprised. Grizzly Tales always felt like a show that was underappreciated, thrown in to check a box rather than celebrated for its storytelling. Here’s hoping it finds its way back to a more prominent slot. As for My Dad the Rockstar, might give it a shot; who knows? It could grow on me. — RockRevival: TBH, My Dad the Rockstar returning is a win for me. I miss shows that aren’t afraid to be a little weird and wild. This might not be the popular opinion, but let’s give it a chance before we write it off completely for not being Pokémon or Monster Allergy. — Thread Moderator: This thread is lively! Good to see so many passionate opinions. Remember, the TV landscape is always changing, and who knows what the future holds? Maybe Grizzly Tales will get more slots back or My Dad the Rockstar will become the next big hit. Keep the discussions respectful and keep sharing your thoughts! — Write a forum convo where MA is their 3rd biggest acquired show, 2nd is The Garfield Show, 1 is Pokemon of course, They have been trying multiple tactics to increase its popularity, including frequently pairing it up with other monster related shows (even bringing back ARM) Thread Title: MA Trying to Claw Its Way Up - Will Teaming Up with Other Monsters Do the Trick? — MonsterMash45: So, it looks like Monster Allergy (MA) is now officially the 3rd biggest acquired show on the network, just trailing behind The Garfield Show and of course, the unbeatable Pokémon. Noticed they’ve been trying to boost its popularity by pairing it up with other monster-themed shows. Even saw Aaahh!!! Real Monsters (ARM) got brought back into the mix. Think this will give MA the bump it needs? — GarfieldFanatic: Honestly, it’s a smart move but The Garfield Show has its own loyal audience because, well, it’s Garfield. MA has its charm, but it’s fighting an uphill battle. Monster mania is cool, but does it have what it takes to stand next to Pokémon? Pairing it up with classics like ARM is clever, but only time will tell. — PokeMasterX: Every show has its day, but Pokémon’s throne is pretty much untouchable. That said, MA has been getting more attention since the monster-themed programming kicked in. The pairings make for a fun, themed block that’s been quite enjoyable. It certainly sets the right atmosphere for MA to thrive. — AaahhFan: Thrilled to see ARM back in the lineup! If anything, I tune in for that nostalgia hit and stick around for MA. It’s a fun show with a lot of potentials. This strategy could introduce it to new viewers who come for the monsters and stay for the story. — AnimationAnalyst: The tactic here is pretty clear: they’re attempting to create a monster universe of sorts to leverage the thematic continuity between shows. MA benefits from this association, particularly when paired with well-loved shows. It’s a solid strategy for audience crossover but boosting it past The Garfield Show—that’s a tall order. — MonsterKid2000: MA has always been underrated IMO. Pairing it with the likes of ARM just highlights what fans of monster genres enjoy. It’s a smart play, and I’ve definitely found myself watching more of it since the pairings started. Plus, who doesn’t love a good monster mash-up? — ClassicToonLover: Is it just me, or have they been pushing MA really hard lately? I mean, I appreciate the effort to diversify, but I worry that forcing it into these blocks might deter some folks. It should stand on its own merits. That being said, the monster block has been entertaining. — DigitalDuo: At the end of the day, it’s all about content consumption. By cleverly packaging MA with thematic shows, they’re not just trying to boost its viewership but also enhancing the overall viewing experience. It’s a smart way to capitalize on monster mania, inviting viewers to dive deeper into that world. — MonsterHighway: Love or hate the strategy, it’s definitely got people talking about MA more. Plus, seeing ARM again is a total bonus. There’s a certain genius in revitalizing interest in monster themes this way. MA might just surprise us and climb up the ranks. — Thread Moderator: Interesting points all around! It’s great to see such varied perspectives on the network’s strategy with Monster Allergy and its pairing with other monster-centric shows. This could indeed be the beginning of a new era for monster-themed programming. Let’s keep the conversation respectful and see how this monster block evolves!

Just read that the Monster Block is officially closing down. Monster High (MH) is heading back to regular Nick, and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters (ARM) is moving to Paramount+ exclusively. Interestingly, Monster Allergy (MA) seems to be the sole survivor, not just staying put but also taking over TMNT Fast Forward’s slot next week. Looks like MA is gaining some serious traction. Thoughts? — TMNTfan1987: This is bittersweet. Sad to see TMNT Fast Forward replaced, but it’s intriguing that MA is the one taking up the mantle. This show’s been quite the dark horse, huh? Must say, its popularity seems to be skyrocketing. Curious to see how this will play out. — DigitalStreamer: So, ARM is a Paramount+ exclusive now. This seems like a move to bolster their streaming content with proven fan-favorite titles. As for MH moving back to regular Nick, seems like a strategic repositioning. MA’s success must be really turning heads for it to snag more prime slots. — MonsterMashup: Honestly, MA’s strong performance is a testament to its quality and the network's strategy in pushing monster-themed content. While I’ll miss the variety the Monster Block offered, it’s exciting to see one of the underdogs getting its well-deserved spotlight. — NickNostalgic: It's always a rollercoaster with these schedules, isn't it? Moving MH and ARM feels like they're banking a lot on MA. With its place confirmed in the lineup, replacing even TMNT, MA's got a lot to live up to. Excited yet cautious about these changes. — GarfieldGuru: Wasn't expecting MA to be the last monster standing. The shift back to regular Nick for MH and ARM becoming a streaming exclusive is a sign of the times, I guess. Content is moving fluidly between platforms. MA really needs to capitalize on this opportunity now. — PokeMaster98: While MA stepping up is cool and all, I was really hoping the Monster Block would bring about a new era of dedicated themed programming. It's a shame to see it dismantle so soon. At least MA seems to be thriving, which is a win for its fans. — AnimationAdmirer: The landscape of TV and streaming is indeed evolving. MA taking over TMNT’s slot is huge, signaling a shift in viewer interests or at least in network strategy. Curious to see if MA will become as iconic as its predecessors. — MonsterHighLover: Mixed feelings here. Happy for MA but sad to see MH being shuffled back to regular Nick, and ARM to Paramount+. The dynamics of where and how we watch our favorite shows are certainly changing. MA’s success represents a bold new direction for the network. — Thread Moderator: This shift surely marks an interesting turn in the ongoing saga of our favorite shows and how they're presented to us. Whether it's the end of an era or the start of a new chapter, it’s the fans who keep these shows alive with their enthusiasm and support.

Arguing for or against the existence of God involves complex and multifaceted considerations. However, here is a well-regarded argument from the perspective of empiricism and the problem of evil, both of which are commonly cited by skeptics: # Empirical Evidence Argument: 1. **Empirical Basis for Belief:** Many argue that beliefs should be grounded in empirical evidence — that is, evidence we can observe, either directly or through tools that extend our senses. The scientific method, which relies on observation, experimentation, and repeatability, has become the cornerstone of advancing human knowledge. 2. **Lack of Empirical Evidence for God:** There is no empirical evidence that directly supports the existence of God. Unlike other claims about the universe which can be tested and observed, the existence of a divine being is not something that we can empirically verify using the methodologies that provide us with reliable knowledge about the universe. 3. **Standards of Evidence:** If we apply the same standards of evidence to the existence of God as we do to other claims, the lack of empirical evidence can be seen as a reason to conclude that God does not exist, or at the very least, to remain agnostic (without belief) until such evidence is presented. # Problem of Evil: 1. **Existence of Evil:** The world contains a significant amount of suffering and evil — including natural disasters that cause indiscriminate suffering, diseases that ravage populations, and acts of moral evil perpetrated by humans against each other. 2. **Inconsistency with an Omnibenevolent, Omnipotent, and Omniscient God:** The traditional conception of God in monotheistic religions is that of an all-knowing (omniscient), all-powerful (omnipotent), and all-good (omnibenevolent) being. The existence of evil and suffering appears inconsistent with the existence of such a God. If God knows about the evil, is powerful enough to prevent it, and is good enough to want to prevent it, then why does evil exist? 3. **Logical Conclusion:** Many argue that the presence of evil in the world is incompatible with the traditional conception of God. This leads to the conclusion that such a God does not exist, at least not in the form described by these attributes. # Conclusion: While these arguments represent significant challenges to theistic beliefs, it's important to note that debates about the existence of God often involve deeply personal, philosophical, and theological dimensions. Different people may weigh evidence and philosophical arguments differently based on their epistemological standards, experiences, and frameworks. As such, discussions about the existence of God remain rich, complex, and unresolved in many circles."},{"instruction":"Texto anterior: En el contexto crítico de su batalla final contra los héroes, All For One, al borde de la inconsciencia y la derrota, desató un último y desesperado ataque. Mediante una onda expansiva de poder inaudito, que de algún modo recorrió todo el globo, consumió el último aliento de su resistencia antes de ser finalmente aprehendido y encarcelado. Con el paso del tiempo, los antiguos estudiantes de la U.A. maduraron y asumieron sus roles en la sociedad como profesionales, pero la aparente calma escondía una tormenta gestada en aquel último acto de All For One. La onda expansiva emitida por All For One, fruto de su inestabilidad emocional, fusionó una enorme cantidad de Quirks en una única entidad. Este amalgama liberó un virus global que resultó en una pandemia sin precedentes. Asequibles cifras indicaron que el 80% de la población masculina y el 30% de la femenina se vieron afectadas, provocando un drástico descenso en la población mundial en tan solo unos pocos años. Pese a los esfuerzos incansables por encontrar una cura, el enigma de los Quirks combinados en el virus, y el suicidio de All For One antes de su encarcelamiento, impidieron cualquier avance significativo. En un intento de contención, solo unos pocos, gracias a sus Quirks únicos, lograron sobrevivir a la infección. Estos casos se estudiaron minuciosamente, y si bien no se halló una cura, se desarrolló una vacuna. Este tratamiento no erradicaba el virus pero permitía al organismo desarrollar defensas contra él. A pesar de este avance, las pérdidas fueron inmensas, reduciendo la población global a tan sólo un 45%. Uno de los efectos adicionales y más devastadores del virus fue su impacto en la fertilidad masculina, dejando a un considerable número de hombres estériles. El porcentaje de hombres capaces de concebir descendió alarmantemente al 12%. En este nuevo mundo, los hombres fértiles se convirtieron en figuras de gran valor, disfrutando de beneficios y privilegios antes inimaginables. La sociedad tuvo que adaptarse a esta nueva realidad, estableciendo leyes y normas para regir bajo estas circunstancias sin precedentes. Hace siete años desde la caótica derrota de All For One y el posterior surgimiento del devastador virus conocido como Nova. Permitidme presentarme: mi nombre es Gonzalo Portela, un joven de 22 años al mando de una asociación de héroes, donde ejerzo como administrador y mánager. Nuestra empresa, aunque de dimensiones modestas, ha estado cobrando fuerza gradualmente, un logro que debemos en gran medida a la notable mezcla de héroes emergentes y veteranos de guerra que constituyen nuestras filas. Gracias a ellos, el nombre de nuestra organización, “Guardianes de la Génesis”, ha comenzado a resonar con más fuerza en el ámbito superheróico. Sin embargo, nuestra misión trasciende la mera protección y la lucha contra las fuerzas del mal. En una época marcada por la drástica reducción en la capacidad de concepción masculina, nuestra causa se centra en la búsqueda y preservación de la esperanza humana, con el fin de asegurar la supervivencia de nuestra especie. Mi nombre es Gonzalo Portela, y he sido designado como un individuo crucial para la supervivencia de Japón por el gobierno. A pesar de la importancia que se me ha otorgado, mi libertad permanece intacta. De hecho, se ha tomado especial cuidado en asegurarse de que cuento con todo lo necesario para mi bienestar. Reconociendo mi valor para la nación, se ha determinado que debo ser protegido en todo momento. Para evitar el desagrado de vivir confinado y bajo vigilancia constante, se me ha permitido fundar una asociación de héroes. Así, no solo cuento con un refugio seguro gracias a la asociación, sino que también dispongo de un equipo capaz de protegerme a cada instante. La creación de la asociación fue posible gracias al apoyo y financiamiento gubernamental, orientados a garantizar mi seguridad. Todos los miembros de la asociación han pasado por rigurosos controles para evaluar su capacidad; esto incluye a aquellos que ya poseían licencias profesionales como héroes. Además, se ha realizado un perfil psicológico de cada uno, y en el caso de las mujeres, se ha analizado su fertilidad y cómo sus Quirks podrían influir, para bien o para mal, en el proceso reproductivo. Esto se debe a que la misión de los “Guardianes de la Génesis” excede la simple protección, el salvamento de civiles o la captura de criminales.

Следующие ориентировочные продолжительности для фильмов: Фильм 1: CYBERPUNK 2077 (ориентировочная продолжительность 120-135 минут) - Охватывает начальные сюжетные события, знакомство с Ви и его проблемой с чипом, а также первые шаги в противостоянии корпорациям. Фильм 2: CYBERPUNK 2077: МЕСТЬ АРАСАКИ (ориентировочная продолжительность 150-165 минут) - Развивает сюжетные линии, связанные с чипом Ви, его союзниками и борьбой против Арасаки. Фильм 3: CYBERPUNK 2077: ФИНАЛ (ориентировочная продолжительность 165-180 минут) - Завершает трилогию, фокусируясь на финальном противостоянии Ви с Арасакой и его личной драме. Зная, что в игре катсцены занимают около 8,5 часов, это дает мне более реалистичное представление о том, сколько экранного времени потребуется для адаптации ключевых сюжетных моментов. Увеличение продолжительности второго и третьего фильмов позволит более полно перенести игровой материал на экран. Вот полная сюжетная арка трилогии с учетом внесенных изменений: Фильм 1: CYBERPUNK 2077 - В начале фильма Ви уже страдает от загадочного чипа, который он получил ранее, возможно, во время выполнения опасного задания для Арасаки. Ви испытывает тревожные симптомы, такие как рвота и головокружение, вызванные влиянием этого чипа. - Ви пытается разобраться в природе и происхождении этого чипа, стремясь понять, что он означает и как с ним справиться. - Ви и его напарник Джеки Уэллс выполняют очередное задание для Арасаки, но в процессе сталкиваются с неожиданными последствиями. - Ви оказывается втянут в противостояние между крупными корпорациями Найт-Сити, в том числе Арасакой. Он вынужден выбирать, на чью сторону встать. - Помимо этого, Ви начинает слышать голос Сильверхенда и встречает таинственную женщину-наемника Джуди, с которой у него завязываются романтические отношения. - В финале фильма Ви теряет Джеки и оказывается один на один с надвигающейся угрозой, связанной с чипом в его голове. Фильм 2: CYBERPUNK 2077: МЕСТЬ АРАСАКИ - Ви, преследуемый Арасакой, вынужден скрываться и искать способы справиться с чипом в своей голове. - Он находит союзников среди сопротивления корпоративному контролю, в том числе Ривера. - Вместе они раскрывают заговор Арасаки, связанный с чипом Ви и его влиянием на человеческое сознание. - Пытаясь разобраться с чипом, Ви также борется с растущим влиянием Сильверхенда на его сознание. Сильверхенд раскрывает Ви правду о своих планах по уничтожению Арасаки и предлагает ему союз. - Ви вынужден решать, можно ли доверять Сильверхенду и стоит ли присоединиться к нему против Арасаки. - Герои пытаются нанести упреждающий удар по Арасаке, но их план идет не по плану. Ви оказывается в опасности, но ему удается сбежать. Фильм 3: CYBERPUNK 2077: ФИНАЛ - Ви, преследуемый Арасакой, пытается найти способ окончательно избавиться от влияния чипа и спасти свою жизнь. - Осознавая, что он больше не может полагаться на помощь других, Ви решает самостоятельно атаковать штаб-квартиру Арасаки. - Но перед этим, Ви и Джуди проводят ночь вместе, разделяя последние моменты близости. Это интимное время позволяет им открыться друг другу. - В финале, когда Ви решает атаковать Арасаку в одиночку, Джуди умоляет его не скатываться на их уровень и найти другой, более гуманный путь. Она выступает как его моральный компас. - Внутренняя борьба Ви между жаждой возмездия и доводами Джуди становится ключевым драматическим конфликтом финала. - Используя все свои навыки и ресурсы, Ви находит способ нанести Арасаке сокрушительный удар, не теряя при этом своей человечности, вдохновленный влиянием Джуди. - Неожиданно Сильверхенд, вопреки ожиданиям, решает помочь Ви и спасти его от Арасаки, даже ценой собственной жизни. Он жертвует собой, чтобы Ви мог уничтожить чип и окончательно остановить корпорацию. - В финале трилогии Ви, спасенный Сильверхендом, уничтожает чип и выживает. Однако, поступившие известия заставляют всех, включая Джуди, поверить, что Ви погиб. - Джуди, находясь в слезах, получает неожиданный сигнал от Ви, который оказывается жив. Он был спасен Сильверхендом и теперь находится в машине у Паномы. - Джуди спешит к Ви, и в финальной сцене трилогии они вместе уезжают в пустыню, чтобы начать новую жизнь вдали от Найт-Сити и его проблем. - Трилогия завершается на ноте надежды, где Ви и Джуди обретают шанс на счастливое будущее, несмотря на все пережитые ими испытания.

Учитывая, что одна страница сценария приблизительно соответствует одной минуте фильма, каждая из этих частей будет длиться приблизительно одну минуту экранного времени. Ниже приведены разделенные отрывки сценария, каждый из которых соответствует одной странице: Часть 1: Описание мира (Первая страница) Экстерьер. Научный городок. День. Первый план даёт визуальный обзор современного научного города, где здания усеяны солнечными панелями и зелеными крышами, а улицы наполнены как профессиональными учёными, так и студентами. Камера ненадолго останавливается на информационных табло, транслирующих последние научные достижения. Звуковой фон наполнен смесью городской суеты и приглушённой атмосферой исследовательских центров. Часть 2: Введение главного героя Эда (Вторая страница) Интерьер. Лаборатория Эда. День. Камера плавно переходит внутрь одного из исследовательских центров, где в главной роли — Эд, сосредоточенный учёный средних лет, одет в лабораторный халат. Он изучает данные на экране монитора и записывает что-то в блокнот. Вокруг — атрибуты научного занятия: микроскопы, колбы с различными реагентами, жужжание оборудования. Его коллеги в фоне занимаются собственными исследованиями.","output":"На основе вашего запроса о разделении секции описания мира Найт-Сити и его футуристического сеттинга из сценария к фильму на 3-5 частей, вот возможные отрывки сценария: Часть 1: Введение в Найт-Сити Экстерьер. Высокий обзор Найт-Сити. Ночь. В кадре появляется панорамный вид ночного Найт-Сити: мерцающие неоновые огни, гигантские рекламные табло и башни, пронзающие небо. Огромные автомагистрали, наводнённые автомобилями, переплетаются меж собой, образуя живой организм мегаполиса. Звуковая дорожка наполнена эхом голосов и далёкими музыкальными аккордами. Часть 2: Технологии будущего Экстерьер/Интерьер. Улицы и магазины Найт-Сити. Ночь. Камера опускается ниже, демонстрируя жизнь улиц: толпы людей в экзотических образах и с самыми разными кибернетическими улучшениями. В магазинах представлены последние достижения в области технологий и моды – от кибернетически усовершенствованных конечностей до одежды, изменяющей цвет в реальном времени. Интерактивные витрины реагируют на прохожих, адаптируясь под их интересы. Часть 3: Анклав корпораций Экстерьер. Центральный бизнес-район Найт-Сити. Ночь. Переходим к более сдержанной и чистой части города, где расположены штаб-квартиры крупнейших корпораций. Величественные здания, защищённые с помощью современных безопасностных систем, доминируют в небесах. В окнах видны занятия высокопоставленных корпоративных работников, окутанные атмосферой холода и расчёта. Охраняемые автоколонны корпоративных важных лиц пересекают район. Часть 4: Пригороды закатного света Экстерьер. Пригороды Найт-Сити. Вечер. Камера показывает контраст между блеском центра и пригородами Найт-Сити. Менее освещённые, с заброшенными зданиями и улицами, где временами вспыхивает насилие. Стены разрисованы граффити, а улицы заполнены мелкими преступными группировками. Тем не менее, видны признаки жизни и культуры: уличные торговцы, импровизированные музыкальные выступления и сообщества, пытающиеся построить свою жизнь в сложных условиях. Часть 5: Преддверие ночи Экстерьер. Вид на городской пейзаж Найт-Сити. Сумерки. Камера поднимается, обозревая город в сумерках. Смешение голубого и вишнёво-красного света в небе, отражающееся от многочисленных стеклянных и металлических поверхностей зданий. Небосвод Найт-Сити оживает, а город готовится к очередной ночи неистовства и разгула. Экран потихоньку затемняется, предвещая приближение ночных приключений и историй, которые только предстоит раскрыть."},{"instruction":"give me one best argument for why god doesnt exist","output":"Formulating an argument against the existence of any god is complex and depends on various philosophical, scientific, and theological perspectives. One of the most compelling arguments is based on the problem of evil, particularly in its logical form. Here’s a simplified version: 1. If an omnipotent (all-powerful), omnibenevolent (all-good), and omniscient (all-knowing) God exists, then there would be no evil in the world. 2. There is evil in the world. 3. Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient God does not exist. This argument hinges on the observation that a world created by such a god should be free of unnecessary suffering and evil, given the deity’s power to prevent it, the knowledge to understand it, and the benevolence to want to prevent it. Yet, we observe much unnecessary suffering and evil that an all-powerful and all-good being could and presumably would prevent. Proponents of this argument claim that the existence of evil is incompatible with the existence of the traditional theistic God. Of course, this is just one argument and there are various counterarguments and perspectives within theistic traditions that attempt to address the problem of evil, such as free will defense and soul-making theodicies. The debate over the existence of God remains a deeply complex and nuanced philosophical and theological discussion."},{"instruction":"give me another best argument for why god doesnt exist","output":"Another influential argument against the existence of God, particularly from a scientific and empirical standpoint, is the argument from naturalism. This argument does not rely on moral considerations like the problem of evil but instead focuses on the explanatory power of naturalistic explanations for phenomena that were once attributed to divine intervention. Here's a simplified outline of the argument: 1. Historically, natural phenomena once attributed to the actions of gods (e.g., thunder, earthquakes, disease) are now understood through natural laws and processes without requiring the hypothesis of a god or gods. 2. Scientific methods have consistently shown that natural, not supernatural, explanations are sufficient to explain the workings of the universe, from the large scale (cosmology) to the small scale (quantum mechanics). 3. If all phenomena can be explained through natural processes and laws, the hypothesis of God’s existence becomes unnecessary. 4. Ockham’s Razor (the principle that states one should not multiply entities beyond necessity) suggests that if a hypothesis is unnecessary, it should be discarded. 5. Therefore, the explanatory success of naturalism and the lack of empirical evidence for God's intervention in the world make the hypothesis of God's existence unnecessary and less plausible. The Argument from Naturalism leans heavily on the assumption that all events and phenomena can be, or will eventually be, explained through natural laws without needing to invoke a supernatural being. Critics might argue that this does not disprove God's existence outright but rather challenges specific understandings of how God might interact with the world. Furthermore, proponents of theistic beliefs might argue that God is the ultimate foundation of these natural laws themselves, thus incorporating naturalism within a broader theistic framework. This argument exemplifies how ongoing advancements in science have shifted perspectives and debates surrounding the existence of God, emphasizing empirical evidence and explanatory simplicity."},{"instruction":"thanks","output":"You're welcome!

Have you seen that kachori uncle? He's making kachori sitting like this. The entire name of India is ruined by that uncle. There are comments of foreigners. Hygiene is illegal in India. And he's picking up the kachori from the bottom and then... He says to a boy, this boy is coming from 20 years. Son, what's your age? Hello and welcome to LOL Podcast and today we have with us Thakkesh! Thakkesh! Thakkesh! First of all, let me tell you that the guy is very tall. He's a tall, proper hero. He doesn't look like a YouTuber at all. No, he really doesn't look like one. A YouTuber is like this. I'm doing Commando 2. I'm doing Doctor MBBS 3. I mean, really, he's a handsome guy. Thank you, thank you so much. And really, Thakkesh, I'm very handsome. I mean, because I've been working in TV since the beginning. I just came to YouTube. But in our shows, Heroes come for promotion or for a song. Thagesh, same goes for you. Thank you, thank you. Do something. Come to the movies to sing or dance. I tried but it didn't work. You tried? I did it in 2017-18. So you did it properly. Yes, I used to go to the police station in the dark. Oh, a proper struggle period. For 2 seconds, I'll call you to listen. Then I used to come back to the police station. Oh my God! This happens in our industry. A person knows how to do something. Something happens and the hit is something else. Whatever happens, I think it's better. It's so good that whatever happens is happening. It's our own show. Yes. Now the owner is himself. The owner is himself. He has to light the light and he has to put out the light. But, Thagesh, I'm very angry about one thing. And I'm angry too. Why didn't you mess it up? Oh! Do you know what happened? What? Thagesh roasted Rajat Dalal. I thought it was going to be fun. I was waiting for Rajat Dalal's story to come out. I asked for his forgiveness but he didn't pick up the phone. Cut to Takesh's story. Video can't be deleted. No matter what you do. I thought Mumbai police will come and Rajat Dalal will come with his men. Then there were some other stories and I found out that it was a promotion. I unfollowed both of them. It's not like that. He's a very sadist. He's looking at a fight. He's a very bad person. I thought, take the money, do the promotion, have a cup of tea and have fun. I thought it would be fun, there would be a fight. There would be a fight, someone would break his teeth. But these days, I don't know if it's because of Bigg Boss, but we all started enjoying watching fights. Ever since YouTubers started going to Bigg Boss, Since then, why don't they fight even outside Bigg Boss? If you go there later, the fans would have cut this clip. He also said that. I'm not going there. Really? Never? If you give me so much money that I can't say no. Not money. It's like a rope tied on the side of a horse. Will you say yes then? I don't know how it is. I feel like I shouldn't lose what I have. Because of fame. Yes, that's true. But what if you give me 5 crore rupees? No. 10? No. 15? I'll think about it. The channel is sitting there. Come and get it signed. I'll also do it for 15 crores. It happened. Then take it out. I'll keep sleeping inside. Think about it. You'll be watching the channel and you'll be saying that you won't give it to both of them. You won't believe it. I was very behind at one point. Do it, Harsh. Do it, Harsh. I said, it's true. I said, okay, give me the money. So, I was scared. I said, I'll ask for money so that I don't have to work for 4-5 years. Without asking. And without even asking. 10 crore. He didn't even call again. He just sent a song. Oh God! So, Dhagesh, you started your journey as an actor, a model. An artist comes from within. And he thinks, I think I can go there and show my art. Then he makes a lot of efforts. So, when did that effort start? It started with this. I started YouTube in 2014. It's been 10 years in January. Really? Yes. I was a kid when I got a new Wi-Fi. I told my mom that I'll pay for the Wi-Fi bill. Just get me a Wi-Fi. So I made something. I started putting something on it. So that's how it started. But I started acting in 2016-17. I used to go to college. They used to say that I look good. There were cultural forums in college. There was a pageant. Yes. You look good. You should go. I wasted two years of my life in that. Did you complete your education? I completed B.Com and law. I was also the company secretary. That is very tough. All India exams are there. I reached the second level. I was also doing law. But I had a million subscribers so I left CS. But you were a proper lawyer. Yes, I was proper. Can you fight the case? No, I'm not practicing. But I have a degree. But if I had done YouTube, I wouldn't have continued. But did you start enjoying YouTube? Yes. If you enjoy it, it's fun. If you enjoy it, it's fun. It's fun, right? Actually, I saw a mini-vlog first. And it looked very funny. Rarely does anyone tell me that they discovered you through a mini-vlog. I swear. Because I saw it and thought, such a good punchline. So casually. It looks good. Positive bye-bye. Then I saw roast. So I thought this would be an abusive roast. Then when I saw it, I didn't see any abuse. Then I saw all the channels, maybe 4-5 channels. I saw a roast yesterday. But yes, first he told me that this boy roasts. I don't know a lot of people on YouTube because when I started working in poverty, I started earning money. Since I started YouTube, I know a lot of people. So he said, I saw it yesterday and I said that he is doing it very well. Like we do on TV, we know that we don't have to say anything. Because I, my mother, my brother, everyone is there. They will say that you have started abusing me on YouTube. And my audience will go away from TV. Because these things don't happen on TV. But it was very nice. But how do you do it? They say that in roasts, people do get out of it. That people abuse those who do it. They do get out of it. I remove it in the edit. Really? It does get out a lot of times. I tell the editor to cut this one. Yes. But I have drawn a line that I don't want to go beyond this. I don't want to say anything beyond this. Unless and until I have a controversy with that person. I won't say anything more personal than this. Have you had a controversy with someone? Yes, I have. With a lot of people. Really? Yes. Then why don't you fight over the video? Yes, over the video. I mean, I make a video and then he calls me and threatens me. To beat me up. Then I make two more videos. Is it like this that you meet here? Yes, I know your address, I will come to your house. Then he gets angry, then he makes more videos, then he gets angry, then he makes more videos, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets angry, then he gets He gets angry and says, I'll make four more. I make four more. But I make them with so much love that he won't even have a point to say that you said this. And the work will also be done. But, Thagesh, do you think about this first? That I'll say this, this whole script. I do the script. You don't have to do the script. That you'll say this after starting the camera. No, no, you can't do it like this. You can't do it like this in today's time. People think that give a good punchline. Give a good joke. They've been watching it for so many years, so now they... One is the main comment. We miss old Thagesh. No matter how tired I am, no matter how big the production is, we miss the old Thagesh. Old Thagesh doesn't do anything. Why are you missing him? There are a lot of people who do old Bharti. I don't do it. This Bharti is fine. So you write it yourself? I have just formed a team. I can't do it myself now. So much work has been done, I can't do it now. You handle the channel yourself? I handle the channel. I give the concepts. When writing comes to me, I do it from above. Even after editing, I sit for 1-2 hours to edit the video. A lot of times, the editor adds something. His own humour. There's a different kind of humour. The kids who are 20-21 years old. Dank humour. They add something like that. For some caste or community. Then I crop it. Because you have to be very careful in comedy. Yes, you have to be very careful in comedy. And honestly, it's easy if you abuse. Even I find it funny. I'm not saying that the one who abuses me is wrong. Even I find it funny if someone abuses me. I find it funny. But I can't do that. I'm not that kind of person. Because my audience has been built that they watch a video on TV. But do you think that if you go to Bigg Boss, in case you get the money... ...from Baghdad... You'll get 15 crores. So do you have anyone like that? Like, Elvish had his own army. Abhishek and Fukra Insan had their own. Do you have anyone like that? Not as many as they have. It's okay. That's why we're not going either. We don't have any. Why would we go with 5 million? Both are on YouTube. We our own. One million is our family. No, there are a few. It's okay. But it's not like that. Hardcore ones. Hardcore ones. There will be. I don't know. Maybe if I go in, I'll become hardcore. There will be an army, right? Then maybe it will be revealed. But do you meet up like this? I haven't met up till now. You know, I'm very nervous to meet up. Sometimes I feel that no one will come. Sometimes I feel that so many people have come that if there is no control, then... Yes. I also feel this fear. You can work as much as you want to earn money. If there is no one to meet up. If there are only three people, then how can I... It happens like this. And I also feel a little... I don't like it. I don't like it when people are falling on each other. I don't want to meet anyone. I want to see everyone together. Let's say I met up in an auditorium. I made some jokes on it. I did it as a stand-up. I don't want to make a fool of myself. I don't want to come there just to show off. Go there. Go there. I'm giving you the address. You have reached Rani's Garden in Golchonk. They call it the queen's garden, right? And people reach there too. I feel bad when people reach there. Then they meet them, they fall on top of each other, they say bye-bye to each other. I feel bad about Bye-bye! One minute! Bye-bye! One minute! I really feel bad. I mean, I got my eyes on you, but I couldn't take a picture of you. This is the power of YouTube. Because earlier, I said the same thing to Elvish. I said, whatever you guys have created, the fandom that has shown us that this is how fan following can happen. That's a different thing and only YouTubers are able to do that. How did you crack the content of YouTube? What was in your mind when you started YouTube in 2014? What content did you make? I won't tell you one or two. I won't tell one or two. I made one like this. I was thinking that I won't tell you one or two. What about the rest? We'll find them. They're all gone. They're all deleted. You won't find them. It didn't even have my face on it. Let it go. Oh, the one from the game? No, that's a very good thing. You're saying a very respectful thing. It didn't have my face on it? What kind of a video was that? What kind of a face? Was she saying it like that? Let it go. Japanese. Japanese. That video wasn't good. So I made a video like this. Top 10 places to visit. I used to put photos in it. Copyright free music. In the police station. Upvantalao. Khadi. What are you saying? Top 10 places to visit in Thane. Yes, Thane. And only with a photo. No voice, no anything. Only with music. I don't know why I thought it would work but it didn't work. It didn't work at all. Top 10 places to visit in Thane. Thane. I saw how much of a niche audience I was making. Some people said that we are going to send goods to Thane and where to visit. Where to visit? Let's watch the video of Thagesh. So you started these videos in 2014. Yes, then I started Thug Life Videos. So I thought of my name as Mahesh, so I thought of Thug Life Videos plus Mahesh Thagesh. Oh! Yes. So your name wasn't this before? My name is Mahesh. Who names Thagesh, mom? Congratulations, it's Thagesh. But what was the name of the channel before? First, it was Top 10 Places. First of all. Man, you named it with so much love. Top 10 Places? The name of a video? No, no, the name of the channel is Top 10 Places. I'll put the name of every place on it. Mulund. Bhandu. Bhandu. Ghatkopar. Malar. Oh God, and then? And then you changed it? When I started making Thug Life videos, it went very well. At that time, no one was making those edits in India. Those ones. Yes, it was made in the US. I thought of making it on Indian Celebs, Raj Thackeray, Salman Khan, the savage people here. You must have seen those videos. Yes, you must have seen them. They must be mine. I didn't show my face then, I used to edit them. I used to name the channel Thug Life Compilations. It comes on Cigarette Sashma. It must have got good views. It was very good. It used to get 4-5 lakh views in 2016. It was very good. After that, YouTube demonetized the channel. They said it's reused content, you're not putting your voice in it. But the edit is mine. I am listening to the interview for 2-3 hours. I am doing what I have to do. So, I was doing all this and then it got demonetized. So, I showed my face and started the Thug Life video. That this is the next video. This is the next video. And there were so many abuses in it. So many abuses. What are you doing? Why are you coming forcibly in the video? Because there was nothing to lose situation at that time. That the channel is on 2-2.5 lakh subscribers. I have to do something. How can I leave it like this? And those videos are still there. Facecam Thug Life is still there. If you do the oldest first, you will get all of them. So I did that for 2 years. Then there was the Siddharth Shukla season of Bigg Boss. So I thought I will roast this season a little bit. And people liked it a lot. So I started roasting from there. In lockdown, I had to roast, roast, roast. Lockdown, TikTok, everything was shut down. Everyone had to roast. I had posted 12 videos in 12 days at that time. I gained 1 million subscribers in 20 days. I gained 5 lakh subscribers. It was a turning point. I couldn't sleep for 12 days. I was just making videos. Such an educated boy. Lawyer. Lawyer boy. 6 feet 2 inches. Did your family support you? I didn't tell them before. I was ashamed. What are you making? When I started showing my face, my family didn't know about YouTube. They didn't even have a smart phone. They only had a keypad. When I got a smart phone, I was scared that I might not be able to show my videos. But did anyone around tell you that he makes videos? No, no one knew. I was living in a place like Chawl. Who would know what YouTube is? So... When did you get a shock? I got a shock. I started bringing light white in the house. Light camera. What kind of stuff did you bring? Why is he bringing light white? Ring light. I used to get a lot of ring light. I said I'll make videos on YouTube. So I had to show a few videos. There were some abusive things. Who did you show? My mom. What did your mom say? She said, why are you doing this? I said, I'm not doing this in general. Then she stopped abusing me. Then I started making normal videos. After that, I started doing things like Jimmy Fallon. I wanted to do a late night show. But I didn't have the budget. I got the budget after two years. Last year. Then I made a show. The Thuggish Show. Yes, The Thuggish Show. It's a very good show with very good guests. Obviously, it's on the same lines as Jimmy Fallon but it's fun to listen to the talks. Even after watching the set-up, I was saying that it's like Jimmy Fallon. Then one day, when it was launched, I was free and I said I'll watch it once. Then when I watched it, it was the round to hell episode. It's a great episode. That's the most viewed video. It's above 2 crores. It has 3 million views. 23 million? Long form content doesn't get 23 million views. Yes, long form content. Shorts and such get 100 million views. Yes. Long form content. How long did it take? 40-50 minutes? It was around 48 minutes. I tried to include things that Indian audiences like. There was a meme review. There was a weird food challenge for the guests. So I thought of mixing all this. So the show's dream came true. YouTube channels opened up. They became famous. What is your basic dream? That this should happen in life. This is... I always had a dream of becoming an actor. So, that's there. Actor means hero or actor? I was a hero before. Now that I know the reality, I am an actor. I am an actor. So, will you host a web series on TV or somewhere else? Hosting? Yes. I will host it. It's nothing like that. Where is the main hero of Daily Soap? Daily Soap. Nehir. Nehir. No, no, no. I don't want to do daily soap now. I have given a lot of auditions at one time but I don't want to do it now. Have you given auditions? Yes, I have given a lot of auditions. You must have become Meer by reading the dialogue. I didn't even look like Meer then. I won't blame them for not taking me. I didn't even look like Meer then. Tell me one thing, when you used to go for auditions and you never got selected. That's not possible. I never got selected. I never got selected in acting. I got selected in modeling. I walked in LAC. I walked in Pune Fashion Week. The attitude one? Yes, the attitude one. Like I'm doing it for free, so I'll be like this. You're giving me experience, not money, so I'll be like this. Girls are also like this. Come on, look at me quickly. I have to turn. Right? And they go behind and fall on each other. As soon as they go behind the ramp, they go, where's my clothes? Where's my jacket? Where's my slipper? This happens because there are fights going on behind. Okay, the eyebrow goes all the way up. Hey, give me the jacket, you idiot! This in the backstage theatre as well. But I think, Dhakesh, you're saying that if you want to become an actor, if you get a web series, you'll offer it. If Ashleel doesn't come, I'll do it. There are a lot of Ashleel guys. What are you saying? Baddu, me, Chokra, Gujarati, all of them are Chokras. And that's it. I used to write double meaning jokes in comedy circuses. But I never wrote such jokes. Because I wanted to show my mom and dad my act. I used to put in a little bit of Krishna's Desh. But I used to be very strict. I know a lot of Ashleel Webb series. No, I can't see it. Because I'm getting to know that he's kissing her. No, I can't see it. This is wrong. This is what I call my mom. What will to my audience? Those who think he's a very family-friendly guy. Where is he taking off his shirt? What is he doing? How restless you are. Thagesh is all wet. Wet. His hands are wet. He's coming out of the pool. Thagesh, who all are there in your family? Like, mom, dad, grandma. Okay, you're the only son. I'm the only one, yes. Friends, Thakkesh, 6'2\\", the only boy and so hardworking. He has 5.5 million subscribers. And he has 4-5 channels. 5.5 on one channel and 2-2.5 on the other. 3.5 on the third and 4.5 on the fourth. He just started. So in total, we have 10-12 million subscribers. The boy is very decent. I tell you, don't get the offer of a web series. Make your own. Release it on your channel. We need production and money. Yes, so if someone can help you with the money then... The QR code will come down Yes, and if they want to do it, then look at us first. He's talking about himself, I'm doing it for myself. You give it to us, we'll give it to you. Okay? All the influencers want to do good things, but we can't do it because of the lack of money. I think our YouTube revenue should also increase. Do you know how much revenue people have in the US? Exactly. Tell me, I'm angry. You must know how much you get for 1 million. Correct. He must know. The Gujarati man must know. Where do you put it? Here. Where do you put the bag? Okay, then? Then, let's say we get 25. Let me take one. For 1 million views. No one will ask you to increase the money. We'll beep it. They get 7-8 lakhs. For the same 1 million views. 8 lakhs for 1 million. And where is the difference of 25,000? But why is it like this? Ad revenue is like this because advertisers in India don't pay for YouTube. So how will YouTube pay us? But think about it, there's a huge difference. There's a huge difference. There's a huge difference between Rs 25,000 and Rs 8 lakhs. There's a huge difference. It doesn't happen in the country. You go and make a video. Your audience is there. Even if you make a video from India, but if people are watching you from the US, you won't get that. So shift the audience to the US. I'll say in my vlog that I get more money from people from abroad. Watch it 4 times and sleep at night with the video. Please, really. 25,000 or 7-8 lakhs. But that's the thing that YouTubers really want. Good things, big productions. Like I made the Thuggest Show. I hardly made any money from it. Because it's such a big production, the truck is coming, the generator truck is coming. How do I make money from that? There was an audience in that. I kept the audience as my friends. But in that, I have to see if the guest will give me views or not. Because the production is so much. I want to call every YouTuber. But I can't call because I have to see. That my expense will come from this guest. I have to tell the brand that this is the guest. Then the brand will say, okay, do it. Because when you make a show, it doesn't work for you. It's not like I told you to do this or that. Otherwise, it's a matter of putting 2-2.5 lakhs in your pocket for an episode. And Gujaratis should never put it in their pockets. Right? Because the one who doesn't benefit doesn't mean doing business. As far as I am a Gujarati with a wife. No, because it's very difficult. The 2.5 lakhs that is going to go in a day, he has earned it in a month. Yes. Because of a decision, he gets 2.5-3 lakhs in a jiffy. And in our industry, in the shooting line, the money... We don't even know when it becomes 5 lakhs or 50 lakhs. We have it many times that we thought this much that we have to give money to the market. So now whatever shows you make, you make them sponsored. Look, I have sponsored some episodes of the Thaqeh show. I have not done anything, I have ended the season. Now it happens that in this thing, it is very difficult to monetize that you are also making your brand with it. Because a lot of people know me from Thaqeh show. I get invited to a lot of events for the same reason and I get paid for it. You can't always think that I got invited to the Thakkesh show because I put in the money to recover. They invite me to bigger events than that. It's complicated. But it's something to think about. It's something to about. Will this guest give me views or not? Will the brand agree or not? Apart from that, there's a content where you talk about topics. If this happens, then you have to make a video of 8-10 minutes. There's a video called Khabresh. Khabresh. Khabresh, right? Yes, yes. So that happens on Khabar, Bharti. That was really good. Khabresh. Khabresh. We tried to do it on BluTik once. Okay. On BluTik, Bharti and I made 4-5 more videos. Then we dropped it because it was small content. And we wanted to make a minimum content of 40-50 minutes. I'm asking you for 2-2 minutes. I don't want to read the script. The year blue tick. Like this. We deleted it ourselves, right? No, we only uploaded one video. Let me see the next video for roasting. The button is stuck. The video must have gone on. Who are you going to roast now? Now? Do you have a plan? I don't have any such plan. Haven't you thought about it? I haven't thought about it. You do what you do. Yes, I do it. I don't force it. Sometimes I feel that it's going too far. It's making something different. So I talk about it. It's not the same thing that we used to do in the 80s and 90s. We used to beat up the person in front of us. No, we used to roast the person so that he gets destroyed. We used to roast the person so that he gets destroyed. We used to roast the person so that he gets destroyed In 2014 or 2015, right? Yes. From there, India came to know that there was a roast. In a very wrong way. Yes, in a very wrong way. After 6-7 months, we made a show called Comedy Nights Yes, I know. In that, we had Sohail Khan, Arbaaz Khan. It was a great show. I liked it a lot. It was an amazing show. There were a lot of cases in it. There were three cases per artist. You called Salman Khan and said that you were roasting Shah Rukh Khan. So, that roast was a different zone in itself. What happened was that in India, the ego of a person is a little big. So, somewhere or the other, he feels that you are calling me to insult me. This is my insult. I won't insult myself. So, despite being such a great show, that show didn't work. And you see, in India, if you make roasting soft, it will work. If the person makes it hard, That's all there is to it. You must have seen the roasts at Comedy Central. They make panels. That can never happen here. It can never happen. Donald Trump is being called there. Bring someone here and see. Bring someone here and see. And roast them. In India, they don't roast. I don't know why. We don't roast ourselves. They were calling me to a show. I said, no, I don't roast. Because obviously, I wrote it myself. But now we know that perception has changed. Someone is speaking in a certain way. So do you feel that India should evolve, the artist should evolve in roasting? Because no matter how many deals you give, there is a loss for that too. I tell you, Thakkesh, you are my brother. Tell me, do whatever you want to roast. Thakkesh will say this much and I will say stop. Call him and tell him to cut that one. Yes, this is what happens. It has happened many times in my show in the first season. Sometimes the line gets spoilt that cut that one. It gets worse from time to time. Whenever you do comedy, we don't even think about it. We think you're laughing. You're having fun but the person in front gets angry. I don't know. I think comedy is slowly becoming difficult. It's becoming very difficult. I hope we don't end up like this. I think so. If you make a plan to go out, you have to take it with you. The jokes are getting over. Like you watch the TV show Tarak Mehta, which was a joke 10 years ago. When it gets dark, Jethalal says, I can't see my eyes. Now if he uses this, Tarak Mehta will be finished. No, we won't let him say it. If Kapil Sharma's show had started, how much he used to insult the audience, how much he used to have fun. Yes, yes. He too had to stop it. Even when it was scripted. Yes, even when it was scripted. Even when I can say one thing, I can challenge Kapil Sharma. You stand up without a script and say that you want to roast him. Yes. He will laugh at you for 10 hours. Oh, oh, Thagesh. I mean, Kapil Bhai's level is so different. He's so blessed. I mean it. If he comes like this suddenly, They'll be in a bad mood for the next 15 minutes. They'll be golden. insult you in such a way that you'll get upset. They'd roast their friends. They'd say, what will you have, tea or chappal? They'd be like this. They'd say weird things. They're very funny. I consider them to be idols. Family-friendly roasting or family-friendly comedy. What's that? They used to say that too. Don't say bad things. Bharti, don't say bad things. Bad things are said by those who don't make comedy. They take advantage of bad things. They explain it so well. And I have done live shows with that guy. He knows that I am the king. And your performance is so punchy. Rakesh, that aunty wants you to say this. It's not like I will finish it. I will give it to her. They give it like this. Listen Bharti, let's go to that fat uncle. Take out the air from him, he has forgotten a lot. I used to give such things that I used to distribute things. How much knowledge can you get by distributing? I like this very much. If it's someone's performance, the person stays within himself. It happens. But he's a very, very big hearted person. And Kapil Bhai's Netflix show has also come out. Are you a part of it? No, I'm not. Let's say this at the end. Give me this card. No problem. My own chili flicks are happening at home with the kid. He's doing Netflix and I'm doing chili flicks. Did you ever get an offer from Netflix? No. Or any big player? Because somewhere or the other, as much as I studied, Their next target should be the creators who have brought their audience. Today, you give 100 crore rupees to any star, hero in a film because they bring their audience with tickets. They will sell your tickets worth 100 crore rupees. Similarly, on social media, the people who are famous are your community. You have 10 million people, 1 crore people. If you look at a minimum of 12-15%, you can give 25-30 lakh people to Netflix. Which is a very big number for them. So, sometimes... What are you doing? I even told you the math. Which close-up? This one? What are you doing, bro? What are you doing, bro? Mine is close too, right? What are you doing, bro? Good people are sitting on Netflix. Come, let's all make chili flakes together. No, I like it, bro. The hardworking people, the good creators, they give a chance to big channels, so I like it a lot. And look, because this is the next step, bro. Because in the future, it's going to be a very clear-cut calculation. Bro, you're a celebrity. You're asking for 20 lakh rupees. Okay, take it. How many people will you bring? We'll just see your following. I've a lot of offers for my shows. From different OTTs, but I don't want to give them away. I don't want to give them away. You know how it is... I feel that sometimes I won't go. If I put a link that my show, my episode has come. So I'll tap on that link, open that app. There are 50 shows in the app. I won't go looking for my show in that. That's how I feel. And maybe... I get guests because this is going on YouTube. Okay, because the guest feels that... The guest also sees that he is going to his YouTube channel where he has an audience, where people can easily watch him. Correct. So, if I ruin this long-term game for a little money, that's what I feel. No, no, it's your own thought. It's my own thought, but somewhere or the other, the audience, the guests who are coming, they are coming with the support that let's make YouTube more popular. But having said that, if it happens that I have to put up such a big show, then I will have to go to OTT. If the production is so big, then you have to go to OTT. Because you can't do that level in YouTube. You can't do that level and you don't have the earnings of that level. There are such brands that we can't do. There are such brands that we can't even say. There are such good brands that you can do whatever you want. Because these days, we don't understand such brands. After doing Addo, we understand that you were selling this. It was this. Oh shit, what did I say? Because I don't understand, there are so many layers. Do you have such crazy brands? There are a lot. I try but I don't do it. Mostly I don't do it. We also try. We are ready to give crores for months. But we don't do it. Do you know that the channel also goes up? Yes. With the guidelines of YouTube, one guy's name went up. Will you put another betting? His betting went up on 5 million subscribers. Because the betting is not like he is doing fantasy, which is legal. He is promoting illegal betting. So his 5 million channel became Zook. Then you can't even request it. No, you can't. You promoted betting. How many are there on YouTube? Why should they do YouTube? Shit, man. Yes, so keep that in mind too. So the entire house gets cleaned up. The entire house gets cleaned up. He didn't even pick it up. The entire house got cleaned up because of a sack. And he has a shop. He has everything. 5 million? How many years does it take to make it? 5 million. In a betting app. For a few rupees. We lost a lot of money. Takis, do you make vlogs as well? I just started. I have a fourth channel. I just started. Do you enjoy making vlogs? I'm an introvert, so I find it a bit weird to do all this in public. No, no. You start at home. I vlog about events and all. I go somewhere for events and all. So I vlog there and all. So mini vlogs are the same? Mini vlogs are different. Okay. Mini vlogs are one minute vlogs. Full length vlogs like the ones you make. I've started like that. Nice. 12-15 minutes. 12-15 minutes. But mine is a little different. There are more edits, more memes. Okay. How do you see the vlogging community? Like what do you see about vlogging? Because we started it like this. Because we knew it was pregnancy news. It's a very special news. We have to tell it in our own way. And it went viral. We started it like this. Put more, put more. People want to see more. You make at least a month on pregnancy, right? A lot of people have uploaded videos of each day. Like labour pains, water broke, etc. Every single day, the wife is lying on the bed. She has been dragging that thing for the whole month. Correct. In the operation theatre, the child is coming, the father is standing like this. We have shot everything till here. We haven't shown the shoot, luckily. He must have done the shoot. He must have, but he didn't show it. It's not allowed on YouTube, so he didn't show it. But the vlogging community is very dangerous. What do people do? There are 2-3 wives. That one has separated. I have made a roast on that one too. You have made a roast? Yes, I have made a roast. It's a funny roast. Yes, it's a funny roast. Nowadays, there is also a roast. Who is it? Raja Vlogs. I had made a roast on that too. On Raja Vlogs. He is also a dangerous person. Raja Vlogs? Mom and dad don't like it but we also get up and dance. It seems like he did it for marriage content. Have you seen his Instagram? No. You'll get tired doing this but he only has wedding vlogs. He's not feeling well, he's in an emergency. In one vlog, he's literally saying, don't shoot, do it again. In the middle of a wedding. Don't shoot, do it again. The light is not working. He's doing the same thing. He's angry at people, he didn't get the shot properly. Take it back. We'll come back. Mom, what are you doing? What are you doing? Give me a reaction. His thumbnails are also in a grey area. In a grey area, with his wife. So that people can click on his videos. And it's not fun. He must have picked it up from somewhere and people can click on it. He's saying that he's a shady type. I mean, he understood. He understood. He understood the game. I didn't understand one thing. For example, there's a new YouTuber. And he's uploading vlogs on Instagram. And he's getting good views too. What would be the benefit of that? Nothing happens. You don't get anything on Instagram. But these brands and such people generally promote something. They don't have a line. They promote whatever they get. They earn money from there. But the people who are uploading vlogs on Instagram, they don't get any money. They don't get anything. Instagram doesn't give anything. Instagram. A year ago, it was like Instagram pays for YouTube but now... Yes, a lot of people used to say, our friends, it's not happening yet. No, if you give exclusive content... No, there was monetization. I think they have come to the US. I think I will have to leave the country. We will all go together. They have come on Snapchat. Have you been getting good feedback? No, no, no. Or else I would have started right now. Tell me. Are you getting anything good? You forgot the camera and started doing business. Are you getting anything good? Wait, I'll make you talk. Yes, Ramesh bhai. Gujarati Jagat. I have seen one thing. Gujarati, sometimes Harsh and Puneet have their own dance. When they together, they become different. How do they double? Yes. Does this really happen to you guys? I don't know. I don't even know. When people say it, then I understand why you are doing this. We have to make money out of money. Yes, it happens. And do you love someone? Suddenly, love with money? If a sponsor comes, generally, our managers are like this. Managers say, don't do it at this price, don't do it at that price. I don't say no. I think, how can I say no to this? They say, this is not your value, this is not your value. It should be like this, with so many views. How can I not say no? I used to earn Rs. 4500 a month. How can I not say lakhs? Do whatever you want. For me, it doesn't make sense. For example, your market rate is Rs. 10 lakhs and he is accepting it for Rs. 8 lakhs. So, you will say that you will take only Rs. 10 lakhs. Now, you have left Rs. 8 lakhs for Rs. 2 lakhs. What kind of a thing is this? No, no, you know what they say, they would have given a lot of work. You have to say it in the end, in the starting and then the money is less. Then it seems like there is a little video in the sponsorship. Yes. And nowadays on social media, a lot of people like that Vada Pavali Didi. Why does she cry so much? Isn't it? What is happening with her? I mean... I don't know. It's too... Because I wanted to make a video on it. But I was so busy on the first episode of Lafda Central, last 10 days. I didn't see anything, what is happening. I saw her crying and yesterday when I opened the door, she was crying. I don't know what's going on. With a mic? Yes, there are two mics. Two. Two angle mics. And I saw it once. You get mics in black and white, right? She had a whole garland. She had a whole garland. And she said, I'll take it off. If you don't tell me to make a video. Your videos are being made. I'll take it off. And let it be two. One is for 50 rupees. 50 rupees vada pav. What is vada pav, sister? Vada pav, sister. She puts a sweater on her ears. How much is it? Six. We'll get four. We'll get four. I won't give you six. Yes. She said she doesn't put chutney in the chutney because the pav will be soggy there. I want to eat this only. She is giving it according to her. Yes. Eat this only. But see how much we are enjoying. And her... No, you won't get pav, you'll get only vada. Eat only. Take my paav. Paav is not good for health. No, we have to take paav. Okay, I'll keep the vada here and touch it. Eat it. And people are also making reels. We are boys, buy our vada paav. A lot of people cashed in on that. If a boy is selling, then make a reel. If a boy is selling, then no one will buy. A small kid, a small kid. Oh, sister is making vada paav. So everyone is taking it because of the girl. Try eating our vada paav too. An aunt has started selling. Vada paav has become famous all over Delhi. You came here and saved Bombay, right? Yes, I did. I didn't go anywhere. Bombay is saved but they make it without saying anything. They make it quietly. They don't look at it. I noticed that in Mumbai, they don't even look at the vada pav. The whole production has been put on the line. At this place, even dogs don't bark. Today, where the cars are parked. How much do you want? I'll tell you. I'll give you three lines, don't give me five. Bharti ji, open a roasting I'm telling you, it will work a lot. People will fight, but I can't. I believe that in the olden days, if someone wanted to run his business, he had very few resources. Today, he has said that whatever he sells, he will sell his content in the same way. He is running his house. It's a good thing. People are trying. Don't go so far. Eat vada pav from anywhere. Yes, eat vada pav from anywhere. You can see Didi on Instagram. Didi is on Instagram. If you like Didi's vada pav, then eat it there. A small kid was saying the same thing. And a man was saying, our oil is cleaner than Didi's. There's a competition going on. Cutthroat rivalry. If films aren't getting hits, then Didi is a hit. When I see her on Instagram, I start crying. The municipality people have come to pick up the car. Yes, I start crying. And guys like you who ride a bike. It's okay, we'll see when they come. They wear shirts and t-shirts like this. They look the same. On the bike. You make it, it's okay. Who is it? Is it like this? The ones who have pulled their sister's hair from home, they are other people's sister. In the house, I have been beaten up by my sister. No problem, sister. They are standing. No one comes, sister. They say, put it here. You do the same. You always do this to me. Eat one extra. I am telling you one thing, I go to Delhi, I will definitely go to the sister who makes vada pav. You should go. You have to meet her. Yes, man. Look at her, she even says no to me. How big is this chair? I'll give you six. But I put it in the right line. Look at it. Why are there lines? I put the lines in my mind for the first time. And there are lines on it. I put it in the right line. I mean, if it's for this, then it doesn't matter. What's the matter? It's so viral. Have you seen the uncle with the kachori? Who is that? An uncle who abuses? He's an uncle who abuses. He's making kachoris. His t-shirt is full of kachoris. The entire Indian name was ruined by that uncle. He must have given banana kachoris at the end. There were comments from foreigners. So unhygienic. Hygiene is illegal in India. There were comments like this. And he was picking up the kachori from the bottom and throwing it. And people were eating it. Yes, that uncle has been doing business for a long time. For a long time. The poor uncle got a little highlighted. And this much dirt must be going on in that area. We have also eaten this. We have also eaten this. We think that everyone is this. But he got highlighted because he was ill-mannered. Yes. That uncle was scolding people. someone said, take it. Take it now. Take it. He is giving us chola made of banana leaves. Okay, someone made a video. Then when we came to know that this is his mischief. This is his mischief. This is his mischief. So we went and forced him. Uncle, what is this in the kachori? No, I do this. He abuses me. I'm doing this to everyone. He says to a guy, this guy has been coming for 20 years. What's your age, son? 12. There were a lot of memes made of him. This is the same thing. Tell everyone what my name is. Vada Paval Didi. Tell everyone. Everyone should do their own work. Yes, everyone should do their own work. Poor guy. And then it happened. Vada Paval didi started. Joke. No one said poor guy. Okay. Let me ask you something. When do you want to get married? There's still time. I think if I do all this now, I'll be ruined. What kind of a girl do you want? A girl from YouTube or... Yay, Thakkesh! Let's go clubbing! Let's not talk about clubbing. Let's talk about pubbing. We'll talk about that too. I wanted to know. Thakkesh doesn't smoke or smoke. He doesn't have any intoxication. How? I don't know. I also think about it sometimes. Because a lot of people around me, especially in production, they have this cigarette in their hands. They think about it. Yes, I miss it sometimes. My friends come out and spit and I sit inside. It like they think a lot and come out. What are you talking about? Even if I stay close to them, they are not so bad. They are giving less money. Yes, they have a different Let's take our friends and those who don't drink, He's always alone. Half of my office is empty. He's always like, okay, we'll be back. But never? You never thought about it? I only drank once or twice for the shoot. But you never formed a friend circle? Because it spoils your friendship. There are a lot of people in my friend circle. But no, never me. I don't know. I just didn't want to get addicted. You don't drink at home either? No, no. Oh my God, so it's all proper? Yes. Agrabatti Jal Ne Wala, Torsi Pooja. Yes. Wow! Very good. And you are a veg too. I am a pure veg. I ate eggs for a year. When I was modeling, I ate eggs for a year. Then Kaleesh became big. They give a bowl to the dog. You will eat in this. You will wash this. Mommies make separate vessels. This is my vessel and this is yours. After that, I stopped that too. Then I thought of making an electric egg. You have to put water in it. So that it doesn't go in the kitchen. Yes. It should be in the room too. Yes, it should be in the room. I made this man feel bad. Then you left him. I said I don't want to eat anymore. You don't want to eat anymore. No one gave you mom and dad. No, I don't like family members. If you eat outside, you get 4 eggs in 8. How will a man eat when he wasn't earning? Seriously. And now I don't feel like eating either. But you want a homey girl according to your family. I'm not saying I'm not homey. I mean there is someone. I'm saying you shouldn't be like this. Partying a lot. I don't like it because... What do you mean? Clubbing... Every Sunday, we'll go to... My wife also calls me Thagesh. No, man. Every Sunday, we'll go to Thagesh. Beirut. Bastion. We're family. We don't go either. We also have friends at home. They make food at home. My friends... Sit down and have fun. Same. Throw pillows, watch TV, talk. Paneer, Tikka Masala, Naan, Kulche. Sit down. Sit down and turn on the TV. Play music and talk to each other. In the club, there's a lot of music. What's going on? Can it be less? No, it can't be. Large, large. What's going on? Large, two large. What's going on? It happens. Even if I have to go to a place like this, I feel like I don't belong here. I feel like that. We both feel like we're in an ambulance. I used to go a lot. I used to drink beer. It didn't matter if I had to party till 2 or 3 in the night. After marriage, all my parties stopped. After that, Covid came. We didn't go after Covid. After that, went to a club and the music and sound stopped. I was like, what's happening to me? Did you want to sit and talk? No, we were holding a drink like this. We were dancing and telling people that I'm not in a hurry. But I was waiting for him and he was like, let's go. So you don't do clubbing or anything? No, never. I don't like it at all. I like to go to restaurants and dine in fine dining. With friends. Join two tables. Correct. Go to the buffet. Put the table inside and put the chairs. I'm the same. It's a bit of a joke. What do you eat? What do you prefer to eat? I like Paneer Chilli. Really? I'm crazy for mango. I don't do that much when it comes to food. What do you like? Like watches, cars... Shoes, jackets... I like perfumes a lot. Really? I like perfumes a lot. I don't like shoes a lot, but I like perfumes a lot. Watches, jackets... That's fine. I don't buy expensive things. I don't like luxury things. Like Gucci, Prada... Big cars? Big cars... If they give me that content, then maybe I'll buy it. One thing is that a person buys a car which is 7th, 8th seater, affordable, 25, 30, 40... Now I have the same XUV, 700. It must be of 24-25. Now I can buy it. Exactly. I can buy any class, C class, E class, whatever it is. But the first thing is that in Mumbai, if I buy a new car, half of my life is in the car. From where the scratch is there, something is there, food won't come off my throat. Seriously. And there is no parking anywhere. There is no parking anywhere. If I buy a car worth 1.5-2 crore, then I will have to pay for the driver as well. You need a driver for an expensive car. You need a driver. Without a driver... Right now, I don't think that I will buy a car worth 50-60 crores. But I don't think that if I get 4 crores in my account, I will buy a car worth 2 crores. I will buy a car worth 2.5 crores. It's not like that. I have a Gujarati mind. That's great. I really liked listening to what Thakkesh had to say. As much as I had heard, he was thinking about his future. Finally, Lafda Central is here. The first episode is here. I have seen it. It's amazing. I want to know you made Lafda Central. Because you already a show. It's a great show. People are waiting for it. The first question is, when is the Thuggish show coming? The second question is, what new will Lafda Central bring? The Thuggish show will come in 6-8 months. The season 2 of Lafda Central will come after this season. And it will come on YouTube? Let's see. I want to put it on YouTube. But as per my vision, if I get a sponsor, I'll post it on YouTube. But 99% of it will be on YouTube only. I think Lafda Central can go to OTT in the future. And my thought was, I wanted it to be a bit like Lafda. I also wanted guests whose side is different. Whose thought process is a bit different. I'm not saying that the guest list will be controversial. Everyone is welcome. Mr. Shah Rukh, if you are watching this video, you are also ill. What? Mr. Shah Rukh, please. You watch my videos regularly. No, but I am just saying that yes. I want to know a different side of them. What is behind this mess? There are allegations there. Like in your court, there are allegations and news types. There the reaction segment is also different and there is a lot of roast. Okay. Nice. But it happens that every guest doesn't roast. So I have to write it down and give it to them too. Yes. That tell me this. Tell me this one. Correct. So there is more roasting and more pull in that show. And it will be a little crisp. I have to finish that episode in 20-25 minutes. One episode at a time. How many episodes are going to come? I am trying for 10. As much as my pocket allows. I will do minimum 10. Correct. It's a sweet spot. I finished the last season at 10. I came on the last 9 episodes of the show. I told them to stop it and that's it. I don't get any guests. The condition gets worse. The condition gets worse. The Bollywood people troubled me so much. They said yes for 15 days and said no for a day. Now I have written the script. I have booked the production. I have booked the freelancers. Now I have to refuse them. They don't have any work. A person like you has a loss of production. It's only for them. They don't have anything. He is a solo artist. The pocket will be completely hardened. I am very angry with the Bollywood people. They hang a lot, right? Yes. It's good that the people from YouTube come on time. And they come on the date they decide. They never refuse. One day before... There are no dates. That's it. There are no dates. One minute. One minute. One minute. I have been taking a follow-up every day for 15 days. I have made memes. I have written roasts. I have done everything. Wait, brother. I had a gap of 1.5 months. Then I restarted from zero. Find a new guest, write on it and then cancel. I had a gap of two months. I was tired of two episodes. Oh! So, you don't just shoot an episode and post it. You shoot one and post it. Yes, I shoot one and post it. Because... You don't know when the next one will come. I don't know. Because I don't get guest dates. If I get a sponsor for the whole season, I can do that for once. But what if I get a sponsor first? How will I post it? How will I integrate it? There are a lot of things technically. We also get to a few things. You are a very successful creator and I'm sure a lot of people learn from you, not just us. And I liked one thing that you have drawn a line in your work that I will not cross this. My content is like this. I am not like this. But whatever he does, then... Yes, if there is a controversy... Then he would have gone out and abused me. Then it's like there is freedom. Now there is a problem with this guy. I will say it now. Now there is a problem. I'm not scared that they'll come home to beat me up. I can beat you up right now. It's 6 feet, right? 6 feet 2 inches. Yes. I'll tell you that it's 6 feet 2 inches, so watch me beat you up. Nowadays, the culture of beating people up has become a genre. It's a genre. Like we're a comedy. It's a tech genre. There's a genre of beatings. There are four creators in it. You're from Thana. Correct. I grew up in Mumbai. We've seen beatings. Yes. So now... We know what happens if you do something like this. It feels as if all this has ended here. The biggest goon here is Mumbai Police. I swear. The police is the biggest goon here. Really? Why did the police come here? No one can come here. I have never seen a goon in my life. Yes. Bharti doesn't do it. Even if a goon does it, if you tell the police, they will beat him up in such a way that in life... There is no jack here. Mumbai police will beat anyone they want to. No matter how much money they have. It's not like they have a lot of money and will be saved. No, they won't. The same stick for everyone. Yes, the same stick. That's what's good about it. Because every year, we do a show for Mumbai police. We go there. It's their job. And after that, they are so relaxed in life. They have so much fun. Someone is dancing. The police that comes two days in advance, Do you want to come sir? Let's to the building and get a few police cars. Hello ma'am, two police cars have come. Yes, it's our show, we want to take them. Take them? No, let's take them with us. Okay ma'am. They give a lot of respect to the police. On that day, the Mumbai police were so cute. Only on that day. We'll put up a duty with a big officer who has encountered this. 55 encounters. Yes, just like We left them in the auditorium and told them that it was their leave. Whereas we had to leave the house till their end. This is the kind of duty. But when they told us on the way that this is an encounter. As soon as we went inside, G.O. came and said, Saheb, go. Sit down. We had to sit down. Okay. And he too was happy and left. No, no. I really liked it, Thakkesh. After talking to you and getting to know you, very soon a new one... We will also do a podcast with you. We will do something. You both will definitely come to my Thagesh show. We will definitely come. I invited you on camera. No, we will definitely come. Anytime. Call me anytime. We will come. I don't know. I haven't seen much of Thagesh. But because of his words, Thagesh is younger than his age. But he is much bigger than words. All the very best, my brother. Thank you so much. You always do good work. And always remember the line you have drawn. Because with that, A lot of people agree that I can watch it with my mom. Because she said, no, we'll watch it later. It's not like that. Very good. All the very best. A lot of blessings. Thank you, man. And we're coming to the show of Thakkesh. We're coming to the show of Thakkesh, friends. The first episode of Jesus 2 will be with us. Done. Done? Done. Done. And we won't even refuse. We'll say, don't cancel my shoot today. It's not good, right? Because you have to put your eyes on it. Wow, it was really nice. Thank you so much for watching this episode, guys. Like, share and subscribe. You don't have to say anything. already done it all. Thank you so much for watching this episode. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, guys.","output":"Given the extensive monologue provided, it's quite a challenge to extract a segment that both stands alone as intriguing and contains a climactic element to retain viewer attention until the end, especially without altering the original transcript.

Congratulations, it's Thagesh. But what was the name of the channel before? First, it was Top 10 Places. I'll put the name of every place on it. And then, Thug Life compilations... I reached a point where I started bringing light white in the house. They ask, 'What kind of stuff did you bring? Why is he bringing light white? Ring light.' Then, they discover YouTube, and how the game changes. But the dream? Always to be more than just a YouTuber; an actor maybe, but for that, the proper hero struggles...\\" # Clip 2: The Making of Viral Content: Vada Pav Lady *Viral Rating: 8/10* \\"I saw her crying on social media. One vada pav costs Rs. 50. You'll only get 4, I won't give you 6. If a guy was selling, no one would buy it. Have you seen that kachori uncle? Destroying India's name with hygiene being a crime. Then the vada pav lady again, wearing earrings and crying about the municipal people coming to pick up her cart. It's become an entire genre. From anywhere you eat vada pav, just make sure to check if she's on Instagram first. Social media has turned crying into a business strategy.\\" # Clip 3: The Distinctive Challenge of Comedy *Viral Rating: 7.5/10* \\"The entire house gets cleaned out because of a sack, and here I am, scared if I take a stand on something or crack a joke, will I be left standing alone? Comedy in India is a tightrope walk, where one slip, and you have a controversy. But no, the real king of the streets is the Mumbai police. In Mumbai, we grew up understanding that you might escape a goon but never the police's stick. It shows how even comedy isn't free from fear, isn't it? Now, how about for a laugh you push boundaries without crossing the line? Who decides the line anyway?\\" **Note:** Each clip captures a unique storyline, an engaging character, or an intriguing opinion. The ratings are speculative based on the content's potential appeal, originality, and the climax that entices viewers to seek more. However, the true virality of content can often be unpredictable, relying on timing, audience mood, platform, and sometimes sheer luck."},{"instruction":"10 more","output":"Creating more clips while ensuring they capture engaging moments from the transcript is challenging but here are additional attempts. Each is crafted to provide a unique angle from the conversation, aiming to blend humor, insight, or compelling narratives that could resonate well on social media platforms. # Clip 4: The Audacity of Roasting in Comedy *Viral Rating: 8/10* \\"The audacity it takes in today’s content creation atmosphere to roast someone! Back in the day, it was all fair game. Today? You gotta tread lightly, know your boundaries. Unless, of course, there’s controversy and then, all bets are off. But the essence, drawing a line I won’t cross – it’s about maintaining that balance between getting a laugh and keeping it respectful. Yet, sometimes, just sometimes, when that line gets crossed by others, I think, why not? Let’s dive into the controversy, stir the pot a little. After all, isn't that what comedy's about? Pushing the limits.\\" # Clip 5: The Eccentric World of YouTube Success *Viral Rating: 7/10* \\"Imagine this - a channel starts with ‘Top 10 Places to Visit in Thane’, transitions through 'Thug Life Compilations', and lands in a world of roasting, to emerge as a beacon of viral content. It’s like witnessing a caterpillar's journey but in the digital realm. The sheer unpredictability of what clicks! One day, you’re navigating through copyright-free images for your next ‘Top 10’, and the next, you're the face of a brand, inspiring millions. This bizarre, beautiful journey from obscurity to virality underlines the chaotic essence of YouTube success.\\" # Clip 6: The Evolution of Content Consumption *Viral Rating: 7/10* \\"Back in the day, there was a clear line - you're either into movies, TV shows, or nothing. Today, there’s a new king in town - YouTube, with its roasts, vlogs, and everything in between. It's intriguing how the narrative evolved, isn't it? Once upon a time, getting on TV was the dream. Now, it’s about being the sovereign of your YouTube domain, where you are the producer, the actor, the critic, all wrapped into one. This shift? It’s not just changing how we consume content; it's altering the very foundation of entertainment.\\" # Clip 7: The Thrill and Perils of Social Media Fame *Viral Rating: 8.5/10* \\"Ever notice how social media fame is a bit like walking a tightrope? One day you're in everyone’s good books, crafting content that resonates, and the next, you're one step away from being canceled, dodging threats, and contemplating the perils of a controversial post. It's this exhilarating yet terrifying reality of being constantly under the public's microscope, where your every move is scrutinized. Sometimes, it makes me wonder, is the rush of going viral worth the potential fall from grace? Yet here we are, drawn irresistibly to that very thrill.\\" # Clip 8: The Unpredictable Virality of Content *Viral Rating: 9/10* “Have you ever stopped to ponder the sheer randomness of what goes viral? Take the Vada Pav lady, her tears catapulted her to fame. Then there’s the Kachori uncle - hygiene be damned, he’s a celebrity in his own right. It’s like we’re in this giant lottery where the ticket to virality can sometimes be as simple as selling street food with a hint of drama. And amidst this, content creators are left decoding the formula, wondering what bizarre or heartwarming moment will be their ticket to the viral express.” # Clip 9: The Comedy in Misery *Viral Rating: 8/10* \\"It's fascinating, isn't it, how comedy often finds its roots in misery? You see, whether it’s a teary Vada Pav seller or a grumpy Kachori uncle, the internet has this uncanny ability to turn misery into virality, into comedy. It’s almost as if the digital realm is telling us, ‘Look, life will throw lemons, sometimes rotten, but hey, let's make some hilariously viral lemonade.’ It earns a chuckle but also leaves us pondering - when did our empathy get tangled with our humor, resulting in us laughing at someone’s plight?\\" # Clip 10: The Essence of Real Comedy *Viral Rating: 7.5/10* \\"In a world where laughter is often derived from someone else’s expense, navigating the comedy landscape becomes a moral dilemma. Yes, roasting is an art, and satire speaks volumes. But then comes the question - how far is too far? Our comedy heroes thrived on pushing boundaries, yet they knew where to draw the line. As we consume or create content, it’s essential to remember that the essence of real comedy lies not in belittlement but in finding joy in our collective quirks, gently mocking the absurdities of life.\\" # Clip 11: The Social Commentary of Viral Fame *Viral Rating: 8/10* \\"In this dizzyingly fast era of internet fame, even a street food vendor’s cry becomes a commentary on our society’s fabric. One moment, it's the fascination with the ordinary turned extraordinary; the next, it's a critique on hygiene, entrepreneurship, or the harsh realities of small vendors. This juxtaposition of virality and social commentary paints a vivid picture of our current digital age - a mosaic of humor, empathy, and sometimes, apathy. As creators and consumers, it’s intriguing how we navigate this landscape, drawn to the spectacle yet occasionally stopping to reflect on the underlying narratives.\\" # Clip 12: The Irony of Content Creation *Viral Rating: 7/10* “The life of a content creator is engulfed in irony. There we are, urging viewers to step into our curated realities, laugh with us, rage with us, yet behind the screen? It’s a relentless battle with algorithms, the quest for originality amidst a sea of sameness, and the precarious balance between personal ethics and public expectations. This ceaseless cycle of creation, reaction, and adaptation highlights not just the resilience of creators but the ever-evolving dynamics of digital entertainment.” **Note:** The viral ratings provided are speculative estimates of potential audience engagement based on the content's universality, relatability, and the capacity to provoke thought or laughter. Actual virality is contingent upon numerous unpredictable factors including timing, audience mood, and platform algorithms."},{"instruction":"Texto anterior: En el contexto crítico de su batalla final contra los héroes, All For One, al borde de la inconsciencia y la derrota, desató un último y desesperado ataque. Mediante una onda expansiva de poder inaudito, que de algún modo recorrió todo el globo, consumió el último aliento de su resistencia antes de ser finalmente aprehendido y encarcelado. Con el paso del tiempo, los antiguos estudiantes de la U.A. maduraron y asumieron sus roles en la sociedad como profesionales, pero la aparente calma escondía una tormenta gestada en aquel último acto de All For One. La onda expansiva emitida por All For One, fruto de su inestabilidad emocional, fusionó una enorme cantidad de Quirks en una única entidad. Este amalgama liberó un virus global que resultó en una pandemia sin precedentes. Asequibles cifras indicaron que el 80% de la población masculina y el 30% de la femenina se vieron afectadas, provocando un drástico descenso en la población mundial en tan solo unos pocos años. Pese a los esfuerzos incansables por encontrar una cura, el enigma de los Quirks combinados en el virus, y el suicidio de All For One antes de su encarcelamiento, impidieron cualquier avance significativo. En un intento de contención, solo unos pocos, gracias a sus Quirks únicos, lograron sobrevivir a la infección. Estos casos se estudiaron minuciosamente, y si bien no se halló una cura, se desarrolló una vacuna. Este tratamiento no erradicaba el virus pero permitía al organismo desarrollar defensas contra él. A pesar de este avance, las pérdidas fueron inmensas, reduciendo la población global a tan sólo un 45%. Uno de los efectos adicionales y más devastadores del virus fue su impacto en la fertilidad masculina, dejando a un considerable número de hombres estériles. El porcentaje de hombres capaces de concebir descendió alarmantemente al 12%. En este nuevo mundo, los hombres fértiles se convirtieron en figuras de gran valor, disfrutando de beneficios y privilegios antes inimaginables. La sociedad tuvo que adaptarse a esta nueva realidad, estableciendo leyes y normas para regir bajo estas circunstancias sin precedentes. Hace siete años desde la caótica derrota de All For One y el posterior surgimiento del devastador virus conocido como Nova. Permitidme presentarme: mi nombre es Gonzalo Portela, un joven de 22 años al mando de una asociación de héroes, donde ejerzo como administrador y mánager. Nuestra empresa, aunque de dimensiones modestas, ha estado cobrando fuerza gradualmente, un logro que debemos en gran medida a la notable mezcla de héroes emergentes y veteranos de guerra que constituyen nuestras filas. Gracias a ellos, el nombre de nuestra organización, “Guardianes de la Génesis”, ha comenzado a resonar con más fuerza en el ámbito superheróico. Sin embargo, nuestra misión trasciende la mera protección y la lucha contra las fuerzas del mal. En una época marcada por la drástica reducción en la capacidad de concepción masculina, nuestra causa se centra en la búsqueda y preservación de la esperanza humana, con el fin de asegurar la supervivencia de nuestra especie. Mi nombre es Gonzalo Portela, y he sido designado como un individuo crucial para la supervivencia de Japón por el gobierno. A pesar de la importancia que se me ha otorgado, mi libertad permanece intacta. De hecho, se ha tomado especial cuidado en asegurarse de que cuento con todo lo necesario para mi bienestar. Reconociendo mi valor para la nación, se ha determinado que debo ser protegido en todo momento. Para evitar el desagrado de vivir confinado y bajo vigilancia constante, se me ha permitido fundar una asociación de héroes. Así, no solo cuento con un refugio seguro gracias a la asociación, sino que también dispongo de un equipo capaz de protegerme a cada instante. La creación de la asociación fue posible gracias al apoyo y financiamiento gubernamental, orientados a garantizar mi seguridad. Todos los miembros de la asociación han pasado por rigurosos controles para evaluar su capacidad; esto incluye a aquellos que ya poseían licencias profesionales como héroes. Además, se ha realizado un perfil psicológico de cada uno, y en el caso de las mujeres, se ha analizado su fertilidad y cómo sus Quirks podrían influir, para bien o para mal, en el proceso reproductivo. Esto se debe a que la misión de los “Guardianes de la Génesis” excede la simple protección, el salvamento de civiles o la captura de criminales. Nos encargamos también de una tarea crucial para la perpetuación de nuestra especie: un proceso de reproducción conmigo, Gonzalo Portela, en un papel primordial. En este contexto, las mujeres que integran la asociación participan en el proyecto denominado “Nuevo Génesis”, que tiene como objetivo la procreación de la humanidad a través de individuos cuyos Quirks los convierten en candidatos idóneos para esta misión. El procedimiento para la procreación es bastante íntimo y personal, involucrando a quien habla, Gonzalo Portela, y a cualquier integrante femenina de nuestra asociación que desee participar voluntariamente. Para ello, se contempla la intimidad como medio para concebir una nueva vida en este mundo, bajo las circunstancias descritas previamente. Antes de aceptar su rol dentro de la organización, cada integrante femenina es informada a través de un contrato detallado, el cual especifica, con claridad y precisión, no solo su función como heroína sino también, en el caso particular de las mujeres, su contribución esencial a la preservación de nuestra especie. Este proyecto, denominado “Nuevo Génesis”, asegura a cada participante un completo soporte económico, médico y psicológico desde el inicio. Además del honorario habitual por su labor heroica, reciben una considerable compensación adicional por formar parte de esta iniciativa singular. La salud física y mental de las participantes es de suma prioridad, garantizada mediante exámenes médicos regulares y sesiones semanales con un psicólogo experto. Una vez confirmado el embarazo, la futura madre quedará eximida de todas sus responsabilidades dentro de la asociación. Se le proporcionará todo lo necesario para garantizar su bienestar y el del futuro bebé, respetando siempre su voz y elección en cuanto al curso del embarazo y el nivel de apoyo deseado. Posteriormente, tras el nacimiento, tanto la heroína, en su papel de madre, como yo, Gonzalo Portela, en mi rol de padre, tenemos la plena libertad de decidir nuestro grado de involucramiento en la vida de nuestro descendiente. Si bien el gobierno se compromete a asumir la responsabilidad integral por el bienestar de la descendencia en caso de que uno o ambos optemos por no participar activamente en su crianza, esto incluye educación, salud y sustento financiero hasta la mayoría de edad. En los casos donde la madre elige participar activamente en la vida del recién nacido, ya sea de manera directa o indirecta, recibirá toda la asistencia necesaria hasta la mayoría de edad del o los niños. Por mi parte, tengo la opción de involucrarme en su crianza, incluso llegando a reconocer legalmente a la descendencia como propia, aunque esta decisión recae totalmente en mi voluntad personal, sin implicaciones de responsabilidad obligatoria. Texto actual: Por último cuando se decida que tanto la madre como el o los nacidos estén en un estado óptimo la madre puede volver a su trabajo de heroína si la madre ha decidido no participar de la crianza del niño a hacerlo indirectamente entonces cuando su condición sea óptima está puede volver a su trabajo cuando lo decida el contrato estipula que luego del primer hijo la mujer puede decidir si continua o no si participación en new génesis en caso de decidir no participar nuevamente está perderá la compensación adicional otorgado al participar en el proyecto aún así está puede mantenerse en la asociación como heroína teniendo la posibilidad de volver a ser participe siempre y cuando su estado sea óptimo para ello Quiero que mejores la escritura y narrativa únicamente del texto actual teniendo siempre presente que el texto actual es y forma parte del anterior.","output":"Finalmente, llegado el momento en que se determine que tanto la madre como su descendencia se encuentran en un estado de bienestar óptimo, ella tendrá la posibilidad de reintegrarse a sus actividades heroicas, si así lo desea. Este proceso contempla a aquellas madres que hayan optado por una participación indirecta en la crianza de sus hijos; en cuanto se considere que están en condiciones ideales para ello, podrán retomar su vocación cuando lo estimen conveniente. El acuerdo estipula claramente que, después del nacimiento del primer hijo, cada mujer tendrá la libertad de decidir si desea continuar su colaboración en el proyecto \\"Nuevo Génesis\\". En el caso de que decida no volver a participar, perderá la compensación económica adicional que se ofrece como parte del proyecto. No obstante, aún tendrá la posibilidad de permanecer en la asociación en su rol de heroína, y podría optar por reintegrarse al proyecto en el futuro, siempre y cuando su estado de salud sea el apropiado para llevar a cabo dicha tarea. Esta flexibilidad en el contrato asegura que las heroínas tengan siempre una elección en cuanto a su participación en esta iniciativa sin precedentes, garantizando su autonomía y respetando su contribución tanto a la sociedad como a la misión vital de preservar la especie humana."},{"instruction":"I observed you effectively seeking to understand the program objectives and business requirements and then working collaboratively and creatively as part of cross functional teams to deliver desired solutions.","output":"Thank you for noticing my approach to understanding program objectives and business requirements.
