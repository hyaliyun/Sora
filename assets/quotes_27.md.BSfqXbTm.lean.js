Why is this the case? 1. **Understanding the Riemann Integral:**    To determine if the function (d(x)) is Riemann integrable, we consider the Riemann sum:    [    I_n = I_n left( x_1, ldots, x_n, omega_1, ldots, omega_{n-1} right) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} d(omega_i) left(x_{i+1} - x_iright)    ]    where (0 = x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_n = 1) and (omega_i in [x_i, x_{i+1}]) for all (1 leq i leq n-1). 2. **Considering rational and irrational points:**    - If all points (omega_i) are rational numbers, (d(omega_i) = 0), which implies:      [      I_n = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 0 cdot left(x_{i+1} - x_iright) = 0      ]    - If all points (omega_i) are irrational numbers, (d(omega_i) = 1), which implies:      [      I_n = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 1 cdot left(x_{i+1} - x_iright) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} left(x_{i+1} - x_iright) = 1      ] 3. **Behavior of Riemann sums:**    Since the function is neither identically zero nor identically one over any subinterval, and because the rational and irrational numbers are densely intermixed within any interval, the Riemann sum (I_n) will vary greatly based on the partition and selection of points (omega_i). Specifically:    [    I_n text{ can take values between 0 and 1 depending on } omega_i text{ being rational or irrational.}    ]    Therefore, (I_n) does not converge to a single value as (n to infty) and the mesh of the partition (max (x_{i+1} - x_i)) tends to 0. 4. **Conclusion for Riemann Integrability:**    Since the Riemann sums (I_n) do not converge to a single limit, (d(x)) is not Riemann integrable. 5. **Lebesgue Integrability:**    To check Lebesgue integrability, we note that for the function (d(x)):    [    int_0^1 d(x) , dx = int_0^1 1 cdot chi_{mathbb{Q}^c}(x) , dx + int_0^1 0 cdot chi_{mathbb{Q}}(x) , dx    ]    where (chi_{mathbb{Q}}) is the characteristic function of the rationals and (chi_{mathbb{Q}^c}) is the characteristic function of the irrationals. Since the rationals (mathbb{Q}) in ([0, 1]) have Lebesgue measure zero:    [    int_0^1 1 cdot chi_{mathbb{Q}^c}(x) , dx = int_0^1 1 , dx = 1    ]    Hence, the Dirichlet function is Lebesgue integrable, and its integral is (1). # Conclusion: The Dirichlet function (d(x)) is Lebesgue integrable because the measure of the rationals is zero, but it is not Riemann integrable because the Riemann sums do not converge.

Let's explore these possibilities for ( k ):    - If ( k = 1 ):      [      (x + z) - (y + u) = 11      ]      Adding this with the given ( x + y + z + u = 11 ), we get:      [      x + z + y + u + (x + z) - (y + u) = 22      ]      Simplifying, we get:      [      2(x + z) = 22       x + z = 11      ]      Since ( x + y + z + u = 11 ), it implies:      [      y + u = 0      ]      Given ( y ) and ( u ) are digits, both must be 0. Thus, we can find ( x ) and ( z ) such that ( x + z = 11 ).    - If ( k = 0 ):      [      (x + z) - (y + u) = 0      ]      Simplifying using ( x + y + z + u = 11 ), we get:      [      x + z = y + u      ]      Thus:      [      x + z = y + u = frac{11}{2}      ]      Since the sum of two digits cannot be fractional, no valid solutions exist.    - If ( k = -1 ):      [      (x + z) - (y + u) = -11      ]      Adding this to ( x + y + z + u = 11 ) gives:      [      x + z + y + u + (x + z) - (y + u) = 0      ]      Simplifying, we get:      [      2(x + z) = 0       x + z = 0      ]      As ( x ) and ( z ) are digits, both ( x ) and ( z ) must be 0, which is not possible since that would not give us a four-digit number. 6. Therefore, the only valid solution occurs for ( k = 1 ), with possibilities where ( x + z = 11 ) and ( y = 0 ) and ( u = 0 ). # Conclusion: The valid four-digit numbers are: [ boxed{2090, 3080, 4070, 5060, 6050, 7040, 8030, 9020} ]"},{"instruction":"Determine p(a, b, c) such that the expression  [a^4 (b^3  c^3) + b^4 (c^3  a^3) + c^4 (a^3  b^3)]  can be factored into the form (a  b)(b  c)(c  a) p(a, b, c).","output":"First, factor out (a-b): [ a^4 (b^3 - c^3) + b^4 (c^3 - a^3) + c^4 (a^3 - b^3) = a^4b^3 - a^4c^3 + b^4c^3 - b^4a^3 + c^4a^3 - c^4b^3. ] Rewriting this: [ = a^3b^3(a - b) - a^3c^3(a - b) + b^3c^3(b - a) + c^3a^3(c - b) - c^3b^3(c - a) ] [ = (a - b)(a^3b^3 - a^3c^3 - b^3c^3 + c^3a^3 + c^3b^3 - b^3a^3). ] Next, factor out (b-c): [ a^3b^3 - a^3c^3 - b^3c^3 + c^3a^3 + c^3b^3 - b^3a^3 = a^3(b^3 - c^3) - b^3(c^3 - a^3) + c^3(a^3 - b^3) ] [ = (b-c)(b^2+bc+c^2)a^3 - (b-c)(a^2+ac+c^2)b^3 + (b-c)(a^2+ab+b^2)c^3 ] [ = (b-c)(a^3(b^2+bc+c^2) - b^3(a^2+ac+c^2) + c^3(a^2+ab+b^2)). ] Lastly, factor out (c-a): [ a^3(b^2+bc+c^2) - b^3(a^2+ac+c^2) + c^3(a^2+ab+b^2) ] [ = (c-a)(a^2+ab+b^2)b^3 - (c-a)(b^2+bc+c^2)a^3 + (c-a)(a^2+ac+c^2)c^3 ] [ = (c-a)(a^2+ab+b^2-ab-bc-c^2). ] Thus, we have: [ p(a, b, c) = -(a^2 + ab + b^2 + bc + c^2 + ac). ] So, p(a, b, c) = boxed{-(a^2 + ab + b^2 + bc + c^2 + ac)}."},{"instruction":"Let R be a unit square region and n geq 4 an integer.

First, we identify the grid spacing for points that are 75-ray partitional. Given the symmetry and requirements: - For 75 rays, the spacing would be frac{1}{76} of the side length of the square to form 76times76 grid of points (minus the boundary, hence 75 times 75 grid). - For 50 rays, the spacing would be frac{1}{51} of the side length of the square to form a 51times51 grid of points (again minus the boundary, so 50 times 50 grid). Determine the overlap of these two grids: - The common spacing that works for both would be the least common multiple of the spacings, which is frac{1}{text{lcm}(76,51)}. Since 76 and 51 have no common factors other than 1, the overlap is on a grid spaced by frac{1}{76 times 51}. - Thus, only points that are a multiple of both frac{1}{76} and frac{1}{51} apart meet both conditions. The overlap grid will be very sparse, only aligning at common multiples, roughly one point every text{lcm}(76, 51) = 3876 points. Since the square is unit, the number of overlapping points is essentially minimal, thus almost all 75-ray partitional points are not 50-ray partitional. The total number of specific 75-ray partitional points is then approximately 75^2 = 5625.

Now, solving the system of equations: [ p + q = frac{7}{6}, ] [ p - q = -6. ] Adding these: [ 2p = frac{7}{6} - 6 = frac{7}{6} - frac{36}{6} = -frac{29}{6}, ] [ p = -frac{29}{12}. ] Substituting (p) into (p + q = frac{7}{6}): [ -frac{29}{12} + q = frac{7}{6}, ] [ q = frac{7}{6} + frac{29}{12} = frac{14}{12} + frac{29}{12} = frac{43}{12}. ] Thus, the ordered pair ((p, q)) is (boxed{left(-frac{29}{12}, frac{43}{12}right)})."},{"instruction":"Tom recalls that the first four digits of his friend's phone number include the digits 9, 8, 7, and 6, but he can't remember the order they were in.

Prove that with finitely many exceptions, every positive integer can be expressed in the form (a_{1} x_{1}+cdots+a_{n} x_{n}), where (x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) are nonnegative integers.","output":"We will prove the statement using mathematical induction on ( n ). 1. **Base Step ( ( n = 2 ) )**    Suppose ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are two positive integers whose greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1, i.e., ( gcd(a_1, a_2) = 1 ).    Since ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are coprime, by the property of coprime integers, any number less than ( a_1 ) can be expressed as a linear combination of multiples of ( a_2 ) modulo ( a_1 ). This means for any integer ( k ) where ( 0 leq k < a_1 ), there exists a non-negative integer ( j ) such that:    [    j cdot a_2 equiv k pmod{a_1}    ]    This can be rewritten as:    [    j cdot a_2 = k + m cdot a_1 quad text{for some integer} , m    ] 2. **Construction for ( z > a_1 cdot a_2 )**    Given any integer ( z ) greater than ( a_1 cdot a_2 ), let ( k ) be the remainder when ( z ) is divided by ( a_1 ). Thus, ( z = k + q cdot a_1 ) for some integer ( q ), where ( 0 leq k < a_1 ). By the earlier result, we can write ( k ) as ( j cdot a_2 mod a_1 ). Therefore, we can express ( z ) as:    [    z = j cdot a_2 + q cdot a_1    ]       where ( j ) and ( q ) are non-negative integers. This shows that any integer larger than ( a_1 cdot a_2 ) can be written in the form ( a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 ) with non-negative integers ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). 3. **Inductive Step (( n = m + 1 ))**    Assume the statement is true for ( n = m ), i.e., given ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m ) with ( gcd(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m) = 1 ), any sufficiently large integer can be expressed as:    [    a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ldots + a_m x_m    ]    for non-negative integers ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m ). 4. **Prove for ( n = m + 1 )**    Consider the numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m, a_{m+1} ) where ( gcd(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m) = d ) and ( gcd(d, a_{m+1}) = 1 ). By the induction hypothesis, every sufficiently large multiple of ( d ) can be expressed as:    [    a_1 y_1 + a_2 y_2 + ldots + a_m y_m = k cdot d    ]    for non-negative integers ( y_1, y_2, ldots, y_m ). 5. **Combining with ( a_{m+1} )**    Since ( gcd(d, a_{m+1}) = 1 ), by the base case result (( n = 2 )), every sufficiently large integer can be represented as:    [    x_1 (k cdot d) + x_2 a_{m+1}    ]    for non-negative integers ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). Substituting ( k cdot d ) with ( a_1 y_1 + a_2 y_2 + ldots + a_m y_m ), we get:    [    x_1 (a_1 y_1 + a_2 y_2 + ldots + a_m y_m) + x_2 a_{m+1}    ]    Given that ( x_1 y_1, x_1 y_2, ldots, x_1 y_m, x_2 ) are non-negative integers, this shows that any sufficiently large integer can be expressed in the form ( a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ldots + a_m x_m + a_{m+1} x_{m+1} ) with non-negative integers. **Conclusion:** Thus, by induction, it has been proven that for any set of positive integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) with greatest common divisor 1, any sufficiently large positive integer can be expressed in the form ( a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ldots + a_n x_n ) where ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) are non-negative integers.

This indicates that (f) is an involution.    - (f) creates a one-to-one correspondence between pairs: it pairs every ((a, b)) with ((a', b')). 6. **Bijection Between Sets (A) and (B):**    - If ((a, b)) is a pair of numbers from (A), then (f(a, b) = (a', b')) represents a pair where both numbers belong to (B).    - Conversely, if both numbers in a pair belong to (B), applying (f) results in a pair from (A). 7. **Conclusion:**    - The set (S) can be partitioned such that the number of solutions to (n = x + y) with (x neq y) is the same in both partitions (A) and (B).    - Thus, it is indeed possible to partition the set of non-negative integers in such a manner.

How many polynomials are in G?","output":"To determine the number of polynomials in the set G, we analyze the structure of the roots and how they contribute to the formation of the polynomials. Given that the coefficients are integers and the polynomial has a constant term of 50, we proceed as follows: 1. **Conjugate Pairs Requirement**: Since the coefficients are real, any nonreal roots must appear in conjugate pairs. This implies that for a nonreal root a+bi, its conjugate a-bi is also a root. The factors of P(z) derived from these roots are either linear, of the form z-c where c is an integer, or quadratic, of the form (z-a-bi)(z-a+bi)=z^2-2az+a^2+b^2, with a and b being integers and bneq 0. 2. **Constant Term Analysis**: The constant term of P(z) is 50, which means the product of the constant terms of its factors must be 50. This leads us to consider divisors of 50, which are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50. For each divisor d, we define B_d as the set of basic factors where the constant term is pm d. 3. **Finding Basic Factors**:    - For d=1, the equation a^2+b^2=1 has solutions (a,b)=(0,pm 1), leading to one quadratic factor z^2+1 and two linear factors zpm 1. Thus, |B_1|=3.    - For d=2, the equation a^2+b^2=2 has solutions (a,b)=(pm 1,pm 1), leading to two quadratic factors and two linear factors zpm 2. Thus, |B_2|=4.    - For d=5, the equation a^2+b^2=5 has solutions (a,b)=(pm 1,pm 2) and (pm 2,pm 1), leading to |B_5|=6.    - For d=10, the equation a^2+b^2=10 has solutions (a,b)=(pm 1,pm 3) and (pm 3,pm 1), leading to |B_{10}|=6.    - For d=25, the equation a^2+b^2=25 has solutions (a,b)=(pm 3,pm 4), (pm 4,pm 3), and (0,pm 5), leading to |B_{25}|=7.    - For d=50, the equation a^2+b^2=50 has solutions (a,b)=(pm 1,pm 7), (pm 5,pm 5), and (pm 7,pm 1), leading to |B_{50}|=8. 4. **Combining Factors**:    - **Case 1**: One factor in B_{50} gives 8 ways.    - **Case 2**: One factor in B_2 and one in B_{25} gives 4cdot 7=28 ways.    - **Case 3**: One factor in B_5 and one in B_{10} gives 6cdot 6=36 ways.    - **Case 4**: One factor in B_2 and two in B_5 gives 4cdot binom{6}{2}=4cdot 15=60 ways. Adding these cases, we get a total of 8 + 28 + 36 + 60 = 132 ways to choose the factors for d>1. 5. **Inclusion of z+1 or z^2+1**: After selecting the factors, we can include z+1 or z^2+1 arbitrarily, doubling the number of polynomials for each inclusion. However, the inclusion of z-1 is uniquely determined by the constant term being 50 or -50.

The centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1, which places ( K ) at point (G). 3. **Coordinates in Barycentric System:**    Consider the barycentric coordinates for the points:    - ( K left(a^2 : b^2 : c^2right) )    - Point ( P left(0 : b^2 : c^2right) )    - Point ( R left(a^2 : 0 : c^2right) )    - Point ( Q left(frac{1}{2}, frac{b^2}{2b^2 + 2c^2}, frac{c^2}{2b^2 + 2c^2}right) )    - Point ( S left(frac{a^2}{2a^2 + 2c^2}, frac{1}{2}, frac{c^2}{2a^2 + 2c^2}right) ) 4. **Equations of Lines:**    Determine the equations of ( BQ ) and ( AS ):    - Line ( l_{BQ} ):      [      c^2 x - (b^2 + c^2) y = 0      ]    - Line ( l_{AS} ):      [      -c^2 y + (a^2 + c^2) z = 0      ] 5. **Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector ( l ) of Segment ( AB ):**    [    c^2 (y - x) + z(b^2 - a^2) = 0    ] 6. **Prove Co-linearity:**    To prove that ( angle ABQ = angle BAS ), it suffices to show that ( BQ ), ( AS ), and the perpendicular bisector of segment ( AB ) are concurrent.    - Compute the determinant formed by the coefficients of ( BQ ), ( AS ), and the perpendicular bisector:      [      begin{vmatrix}      c^2 & -(b^2 + c^2) & 0       0   & -c^2 & a^2 + c^2       0 & 0 & 1      end{vmatrix} = 0      ]      This determinant simplifies to zero, proving that the lines are concurrent.

We are given 20 points on a plane, with no three collinear, consisting of 10 blue points and 10 red points. We need to show that there exists a line such that there are exactly 5 blue points and 5 red points on each side of the line. 2. **Define (R(varphi)):** Consider the set of lines (R(varphi)) with an inclination angle (varphi) (measured anti-clockwise from the horizontal direction), such that each line divides the points into equal numbers of red points (5 on each side). Similarly, define (B(varphi)) for blue points, i.e., each line in (B(varphi)) divides the blue points such that there are an equal number (5) on each side. 3. **Line Passing through Middle of Intervals:** The lines in (R(varphi)) and (B(varphi)) form bands (possibly a single line). Let (r(varphi)) and (b(varphi)) denote the directed lines passing through the middle of these bands, which maintain an equal centring of the points. 4. **Intersection of (r(varphi)) and (b(varphi)):** Our goal is to find a (varphi_0) such that (r(varphi_0)) and (b(varphi_0)) coincide. 5. **Initial Equality Check:**     - If (r(0) = b(0)), then (varphi_0 = 0), proving the required condition immediately.    - If (r(0) neq b(0)), assume without loss of generality that (r(0)) is to the left of (b(0)) when viewed along the direction of (r(0)). 6. **Continuity and Transition Argument:**    - As (varphi) varies from 0 to (pi), the directed lines (r(varphi)) and (b(varphi)) continuously transition.    - At ( varphi = 0 ), let (r(0)) intersect fewer red points compared to (b(0)).    - At ( varphi = pi ), the roles of (r) and (b) are reversed in direction: (r(pi)) is to the right of (b(pi)). 7. **The Intermediate Value Theorem:** By the Intermediate Value Theorem, due to the continuous nature of (r(varphi)) and (b(varphi)), there must exist some (varphi_0) such that (r(varphi_0) = b(varphi_0)). 8. **Verification of Non-Collinearity:**    - If the line (l = r(varphi_0) = b(varphi_0)) does not pass through any pairs of same-colored points, it is the desired line.    - If (l) passes through two points of the same color, slightly perturb (l) by a very small angle to correct it to a position where it ensures 5 red and 5 blue points on each side without crossing same-colored pairs. # Conclusion: By the arguments above and the properties entailed by the Intermediate Value Theorem and perturbation for fine correction, we demonstrate the existence of the required line.

So, the total area covered by the roads is: Area of road 1 (parallel to length) + Area of road 2 (parallel to width) - Area of intersection = (L * 10) + (60 * 10) - (10 * 10) = 10L + 600 - 100 = 10L + 500 square meters The cost of traveling the two roads is Rs. 4500, and the cost per square meter is Rs. 3. Therefore, the total area covered by the roads can also be calculated by dividing the total cost by the cost per square meter: Total area = Total cost / Cost per square meter = 4500 / 3 = 1500 square meters Now we can set the equation for the area covered by the roads equal to 1500 square meters: 10L + 500 = 1500 Subtract 500 from both sides to solve for L: 10L = 1500 - 500 10L = 1000 Now, divide both sides by 10 to find L: L = 1000 / 10 L = 100 meters Therefore, the length of the lawn is boxed{100}  meters."},{"instruction":"a music club consisting of 80 members, 50 members play guitar, 40 members play piano, and 25 members play both instruments.

Two secant lines each optimally crossing different semicircles can divide each semicircle into three parts, resulting in a total of 6 areas.    - **n = 2 (4 radii)**: This creates 4 sectors. Two secant lines optimally placed can divide these sectors further.

Two lines would add approximately 2n areas. 3. **Pattern Recognition and Formula Deduction**:    - Constructing upon the original solution's pattern, where one secant added n areas, two secant lines should add 2n areas.    - The formula for the number of areas should be roughly 3n + 2 + 2n = 5n + 2 given that each secant line adds additional areas. 4. **Verification and Conclusion**:    - For n = 0, the formula gives 5(0) + 2 = 2 areas.    - For n = 1, the formula gives 5(1) + 2 = 7 areas.    - For n = 2, the formula gives 5(2) + 2 = 12 areas.    - These results are consistent with the extended analysis of the increased number of secant lines.

Steps 1. **Reduction of Usable Area**:     - Consider the circle (O) with a diameter of 1. For this circle to fit within the (20 times 25) rectangle (EFGH), its center must stay within a (19 times 24) rectangle (E' F' G' H') that is concentric with (EFGH) but reduced by a margin of (frac{1}{2}) unit on each side.

What percent of his income does he spend on children's education?","output":"Let's assume the man's total income is 100 units (since we are dealing with percentages, the actual amount doesn't matter). He spends 35% of his income on food, so he spends 35 units on food. This leaves him with 100 - 35 = 65 units. He spends a certain percentage on children's education, let's call this percentage E%. After spending on children's education, he spends 80% of the remaining income on house rent. Finally, he is left with 8% of his income, which is 8 units. Let's calculate the amount spent on house rent and then use that to find the percentage spent on children's education. After spending on children's education, he is left with 65 - E% of 65 units. 80% of the remaining income after education is spent on house rent, so: House rent = 80% of (65 - E% of 65) House rent = 0.8 * (65 - 0.01E * 65) House rent = 0.8 * (65 - 0.65E) House rent = 52 - 0.52E Since he is left with 8 units after spending on house rent, we can set up the following equation: 65 - E% of 65 - House rent = 8 units 65 - 0.01E * 65 - (52 - 0.52E) = 8 65 - 0.65E - 52 + 0.52E = 8 13 - 0.65E + 0.52E = 8 13 - 0.13E = 8 0.13E = 13 - 8 0.13E = 5 E = 5 / 0.13 E = 38.46 (approximately) Therefore, the man spends approximately boxed{38.46%}  of his income on children's education."},{"instruction":"Suppose there are lines m, n, and planes alpha, beta.

C: If alpha is perpendicular to beta, m is contained in alpha, then m is perpendicular to beta. D: If alpha is perpendicular to beta, m is perpendicular to beta, m is not contained in alpha, then m is parallel to alpha.","output":"To evaluate the correctness of the propositions given, we will examine each one according to the relevant geometric theorems and properties. **A: If m is parallel to alpha and n is parallel to alpha, then m is parallel to n.** - According to the theorem of parallel lines and planes, just because m and n are both parallel to alpha does not guarantee that m and n are parallel to each other. They could be skew lines (lines that do not intersect and are not parallel) or they could indeed intersect within plane alpha. Therefore, this statement cannot be universally true. **B: If m is contained in alpha, n is contained in alpha, m is parallel to beta, and n is parallel to beta, then alpha is parallel to beta.** - According to the theorem of parallel planes, for alpha to be parallel to beta, no line in alpha should intersect beta. However, this proposition lacks the condition that ensures no line in alpha intersects beta. Therefore, merely having two lines in alpha parallel to beta does not guarantee that alpha and beta are parallel. **C: If alpha is perpendicular to beta, m is contained in alpha, then m is perpendicular to beta.** - The property theorem of perpendicular planes implies that if a plane alpha is perpendicular to another plane beta, and a line m is contained in alpha, then for m to be perpendicular to beta, it specifically needs to be the line of intersection of planes alpha and beta or be parallel to such a line. This proposition incorrectly generalizes the relationship without considering the orientation of m within alpha. **D: If alpha is perpendicular to beta, m is perpendicular to beta, m is not contained in alpha, then m is parallel to alpha.** - Given that alpha and beta are perpendicular planes, and m is a line perpendicular to beta, if m is not contained within alpha, then it must lie in a direction that does not intersect alpha, making it parallel to alpha. This is because the only way for m to maintain perpendicularity to beta and not intersect alpha is by being parallel to alpha, assuming alpha and beta intersect along a line, and m is perpendicular to that line of intersection.

Define x as the proportion of truthful inhabitants in the village. 2. Consider a scenario where all the liars are converted into truthful people, and all the truthful people are converted into liars. In this new scenario, the proportion of truthful inhabitants will be 1 - x. 3. In the original scenario, each inhabitant made a statement about the truthfulness of their right-hand neighbor. Since some inhabitants always tell the truth and others always lie, the traveler was able to determine the exact proportion x by evaluating these statements. 4. Now, in the modified scenario where liars and truthful people swap places, each person’s statement about their right-hand neighbor changes in a specific way. However, the overall pattern of statements remains functionally the same since both the truthfulness and the neighbor's truthfulness have been swapped. 5. From the traveler's perspective, since the logical structure of the statements remains the same, the proportion computed initially as x would still hold true irrespective of the swaps. Therefore, we have the equality: [ x = 1 - x ] 6. Solving the equation x = 1 - x for x: [ 2x = 1  x = frac{1}{2} ] 7.

We can express this as:    [    vec{i} = sum_{k=1}^{2010} vec{v}_k     ]    where ( vec{v}_k ) represents each individual vector. 2. **Step 2: Constructing an Orthonormal Basis**    Construct an orthonormal basis with ( vec{i} ) along the x-axis. This means we choose an orthonormal coordinate system such that the direction of the x-axis aligns with ( vec{i} ).

Consequently, since the vector sum ( vec{i} ) is assumed distributed between the players and the first player can consistently choose the vectors with more significant contributions to the x-axis, their resultant vector will ultimately have a higher x-component, ensuring that their resultant vector is longer in magnitude in comparison to the second player.

Consider distributing n different cards between two persons, say Person A and Person B. 2. We need to count the number of ways to distribute the cards such that each person gets at least one card. This avoids the trivial cases where all cards go to one person. 3. For each distribution, we can vary how many cards Person A receives while Person B gets the remaining cards. Note that Person A can receive anywhere from 1 to (n-1) cards. 4. The number of ways for Person A to receive k cards, while Person B receives the remaining n-k cards, is given by the binomial coefficient:    [    binom{n}{k}    ]    This represents the number of ways to choose k cards out of n total cards to give to Person A. 5. Therefore, the total number of non-trivial distributions (where both A and B receive at least one card) is the sum of the binomial coefficients from k=1 to k=n-1:    [    sum_{k=1}^{n-1} binom{n}{k}    ] 6. Using the binomial theorem, we know that:    [    (1+1)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} = 2^n    ]    where the sum includes the terms for k=0 and k=n, which correspond to the cases where all cards go to one person and none to the other. 7.

For the second hour, the speed will be 30 km/h + 2 km/h = 32 km/h, so the car will travel 32 km in the second hour.

Taking the sine of both sides of the given equation, we get [ sin (arcsin (sin x)) = sin frac{x}{3} ], which simplifies to [ sin x = sin frac{x}{3} ]. From the triple angle formula and identities, we know: [ sin x = 3 sin frac{x}{3} - 4 sin^3 frac{x}{3} ], which simplifies to [ 3 sin frac{x}{3} - 4 sin^3 frac{x}{3} = sin frac{x}{3} ]. Rearranging, we get: [ 2 sin frac{x}{3} - 4 sin^3 frac{x}{3} = 0 ], or [ sin frac{x}{3} (2 - 4 sin^2 frac{x}{3}) = 0 ]. Thus, ( sin frac{x}{3} = 0 ) or ( 2 - 4 sin^2 frac{x}{3} = 0 ).

Given that the banker's gain is Rs. 90 and the banker's discount is Rs. 340, we can find the true discount (TD) by subtracting the banker's gain from the banker's discount: TD = BD - BG TD = Rs. 340 - Rs. 90 TD = Rs. 250 The true discount (TD) is the present value of the interest on the face value (FV) of the debt for the time period until the debt is due.

The formula for simple interest (SI) is: SI = P * r * t / 100 Where P is the principal (in this case, the true discount TD), r is the rate of interest per annum, and t is the time in years. Since the banker's discount is the simple interest on the face value (FV) for the time period t at the rate of 12% per annum, we can write: BD = FV * 12 * t / 100 We know that the true discount (TD) is the present value of the interest on the face value (FV), which can be calculated using the formula for simple interest: TD = FV * 12 * t / 100 / (1 + (12 * t / 100)) Since we have the values for BD and TD, we can set up the following equation: BD / TD = (FV * 12 * t / 100) / (FV * 12 * t / 100 / (1 + (12 * t / 100))) Simplifying the equation, we get: BD / TD = 1 + (12 * t / 100) Now, we can plug in the values for BD and TD: 340 / 250 = 1 + (12 * t / 100) 1.36 = 1 + 0.12t 0.36 = 0.12t t = 0.36 / 0.12 t = 3 Therefore, the sum is due boxed{3}  years hence."},{"instruction":"A father had three sons and left them an inheritance of 9 sotkas of land, which is a rectangle measuring 25 meters by 36 meters.

Let ( c = gcd(a, b) ), thus we can write ( a = c a_1 ) and ( b = c b_1 ), where ( a_1 ) and ( b_1 ) are coprime natural numbers, i.e., ( gcd(a_1, b_1) = 1 ). 2. **Divisibility Condition:**    We know:    [    c(a_1 + b_1) = a + b implies (a + b) mid ab = c^2 a_1 b_1    ]    Therefore:    [    c(a_1 + b_1) mid c^2 a_1 b_1 implies (a_1 + b_1) mid c a_1 b_1    ] 3. **Properties of Coprime Numbers:**    Since ( gcd(a_1 + b_1, a_1) = 1 ) and ( gcd(a_1 + b_1, b_1) = 1 ), it follows that:    [    (a_1 + b_1) mid c    ] 4. **Upper Bound for ( a + b ):**    Given ( a, b in S ), we have:    [    a + b leq 50 + 49 = 99    ] 5. **Feasible Values and Count:**    To satisfy the inequality:    [    c(a_1 + b_1) leq 99 quad text{and} quad 3 leq a_1 + b_1 leq 9    ]    - When ( a_1 + b_1 = 3 ): ((6,3), (12,6), (18,9), (24,12), (30,15), (36,18), (42,21), (48,24))    - When ( a_1 + b_1 = 4 ): ((12,4), (24,8), (36,12), (48,16))    - When ( a_1 + b_1 = 5 ): ((20,5), (40,10), (15,10), (30,20), (45,30))    - When ( a_1 + b_1 = 6 ): ((30,6))    - When ( a_1 + b_1 = 7 ): ((42,7), (35,14), (28,21))    - When ( a_1 + b_1 = 8 ): ((40,24))    - When ( a_1 + b_1 = 9 ): ((45,36))    From these pairs, the set ( M ) formed by elements that fulfill the condition is:    [    M = {6, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 24, 35, 40, 42, 45, 48}    ]    ( |M| = 12 ). 6. **Construct Any ( k )-element Subset:**    By removing at most 11 elements from ( M ), we ensure at least one pair remains in any ( k )-element subset.

However, since you can't bet a fraction of a marble, we need to adjust our calculation. It's likely that they bet a whole number of marbles each game. Since Reggie won 8 games and lost 1, we can assume they bet the same number of marbles each game. Let's assume they bet x marbles each game. After 8 wins, Reggie would have 8x marbles.

Now, we subtract the sum of k and m from the remaining sum to find the sum of r and s: 50 - 3 = 47. To maximize r, we need to minimize s while keeping s greater than r. The smallest s can be is one more than r (since all numbers are distinct positive integers and in ascending order).

For the line l and the circle C: (x-2)^2 + y^2 = r^2 to always have two common points A and B, the distance from P to the center of the circle C, which is (2,0), must be less than r. The distance |PC| is calculated as: [|PC| = sqrt{(1-2)^2 + (2-0)^2} = sqrt{1 + 4} = sqrt{5}] Therefore, for two intersection points to always exist, we must have r > sqrt{5}. This means option A is incorrect because it includes sqrt{5} in the range.  Option B: Since the line l passes through P(1,2), when l is perpendicular to PC, angle ACB is minimized. The slope of PC is k_{PC} = -2, so the slope of the line l at this point for it to be perpendicular to PC should be frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, option C is incorrect because the maximum area of triangle ABC is not always frac{1}{2}r^2.  Option D: From the analysis in option C, when d^2 = frac{r^2}{2} = frac{9}{2}, the area of triangle ABC is maximized for r=3.

Therefore, the function ( f ) can be expressed as: [ f(x) = c + x - 1 ] **Step 2:** Verify the form of ( f(x) ) by substituting it back into the original functional equation. Plugging ( f(x) = c + x - 1 ) into the functional equation: [ f(xy + 1) = (c + xy + 1 - 1) = c + xy ] [ f(x) f(y) - f(y) - x + 2 = (c + x - 1)(c + y - 1) - (c + y - 1) - x + 2 ] Expanding the right-hand side: [ (c + x - 1)(c + y - 1) - (c + y - 1) - x + 2 ] [ = (c^2 + cy + cx + xy - c - xc - yc + 1 - x - y + 1) - (c + y - 1) - x + 2 ] Simplify the expression step-by-step: [ = c^2 + cy + cx + xy - c - xc - yc + 2 - x - y - c - y + 1 - x + 2 ] [ = c^2 + xy - x - y + 2 ] Now notice that the input simplifies correctly back to ( c + xy ): [ (c^2 + xy - y + 2 - c - y + c = c + xy ] This confirms that our function form ( f(x) = c + x - 1 ) satisfies the original functional equation. **Step 3:** Determine ( c ) by using the known value ( f(0) ): [ f(0) = c + 0 - 1 = 1 ] Solving for ( c ): [ c - 1 = 1 ] [ c = 2 ] So ( f(x) ) is: [ f(x) = 2 + x - 1 ] [ f(x) = x + 1 ] **Conclusion:** Substitute ( x = 2017 ) into ( f(x) ) to find ( f(2017) ): [ f(2017) = 2017 + 1 ] [ f(2017) = 2018 ] Thus, the value of ( f(2017) ) is  [ boxed{2018} ]"},{"instruction":"Michelle needs a drying rack for each three pounds of pasta she makes, and it takes two cups of flour to make each pound of pasta dough.

Given that 6 occurs more than once and the median of the list is 7, the list can be written as a, b, 7, c, d. Since 6 must occur twice, and it should be less than the median, we set a = b = 6. Thus, the list becomes 6, 6, 7, c, d. With the average of the list being 11, the sum of these five numbers must equal 5 times 11 = 55. Therefore, 6 + 6 + 7 + c + d = 55 simplifies to 19 + c + d = 55 or c + d = 36. To find the largest possible value of d, we should minimize c. Setting c = 8 (since it needs to be greater than 7), we find d = 36 - 8 = 28. The list becomes 6, 6, 7, 8, 28.

Thus, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    Assume that for a ( (2n+1) times (2n+1) ) board, the maximum number of black cells is ( (2n+1)(n+1) ). 3. **Inductive Step:**    Consider a ( (2n+3) times (2n+3) ) board. We can split this board into:    - A ( (2n+1) times (2n+1) ) sub-board.    - A ( 2 times (2n+3) ) strip at the bottom.    - A ( (2n+3) times 2 ) strip on the right.    - A ( 2 times 2 ) square at the bottom-right corner. 4. **Counting Black Cells:**    - By the inductive hypothesis, the ( (2n+1) times (2n+1) ) sub-board has at most ( (2n+1)(n+1) ) black cells.    - Each ( 2 times (2n+3) ) strip can be divided into ( n+1 ) ( 2 times 2 ) squares and a ( 2 times 1 ) rectangle. Each ( 2 times 2 ) square can have at most 2 black cells, and the ( 2 times 1 ) rectangle can have at most 1 black cell. Thus, each strip can have at most ( 2(n+1) + 1 = 2n+3 ) black cells.    - The ( 2 times 2 ) square at the bottom-right corner can have at most 2 black cells. 5. **Summing Up:**    - The total number of black cells is at most:      [      (2n+1)(n+1) + (2n+3) + (2n+3) + 2 - 1      ]      The (-1) accounts for the overlap of the bottom-right corner in both strips.    - Simplifying this expression:      [      (2n+1)(n+1) + 2(2n+3) + 1      ]      [      = (2n+1)(n+1) + 4n + 6 + 1      ]      [      = 2n^2 + 3n + 1 + 4n + 7      ]      [      = 2n^2 + 7n + 8      ]      [      = (2n+3)(n+2)      ] 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the maximum number of black cells in a ( (2n+3) times (2n+3) ) board is ( (2n+3)(n+2) ), which completes the induction.

For a feasible set of numbers:     - If (a_1 = 4) and (a_2 = 6), then:         [         a_4) must be 8 and (a_5 must be 10 (since (a_4 < a_5)) which fits (a_4 + a_5 = 18). 5.

The bullet train is moving at 70 kmph, and the man is running at 8 kmph in the opposite direction. When two objects are moving in opposite directions, their relative speeds are added together. Therefore, the relative speed between the train and the man is: Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 70 kmph + 8 kmph Relative speed = 78 kmph To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s). We use the conversion factor that 1 kmph is equal to 5/18 m/s. Relative speed in m/s = 78 kmph * (5/18) m/s per kmph Relative speed in m/s = 78 * 5/18 Relative speed in m/s = 390/18 Relative speed in m/s = 21.6666666667 m/s Now, we have the relative speed in meters per second and the time in seconds. We can find the length of the train (distance covered by the train to pass the man) by using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken for the train to pass the man is 7.384615384615384 seconds.

First, we note that since x > -1, it follows that x+1 > 0.

Is it possible to retile the rectangle by adding one tile of the opposite type?","output":"Let us analyze the problem by considering the following points: 1. **Coloring the Rectangle**:      - First, color the rectangle as a chessboard with black and white squares alternately. This way each 2 times 2 tile will cover either one black, one white square, resulting in a total of two black and two white squares, or it may cover no black and no white squares. 2. **Tiles Counting Black Squares**:     - A 2 times 2 tile will always cover exactly 2 black squares and 2 white squares.     - A 1 times 4 tile can:         - Cover 0 black squares (if placed horizontally on an even row),         - Cover 0 black squares (if placed horizontally on an odd row),          - Cover exactly 2 black squares (if placed vertically crossing two different rows). 3. **Initial Tiling**:     - When the rectangle is initially fully tiled with 1 times 4 and 2 times 2 tiles, let’s write an expression for the total number of black squares covered:         [         2 times text{Number of } 2 times 2 text{ tiles} + 0 times text{Number of } 1 times 4 text{ tiles (horizontal arrangement)} + 2 times text{Number of } 1 times 4 text{ tiles (vertical arrangement)}         ]         Since black and white squares are symmetric, the total number of black squares must equal the total number of white squares. 4. **Removing one tile**:     - Suppose one tile is removed from the arrangement. This will change the parity (evenness or oddness) of the total number of black squares. 5. **Adding a tile of the opposite type**:     - Assume an original 2 times 2 tile is removed leaving us needing an equal number of black and white squares. However, to extend this concept, we add a 1 times 4 tile:         [         text{Adding a } 1 times 4 text{ tile changes the parity of covered black squares by } 0 text{ (if horizontal)} text{ or } 2 text{ (if vertical)}.         ]         - Hence, adding this 1 times 4 tile cannot revert us to an equal number of black and white squares.     - Similarly:         - If we removed a 1 times 4 tile and tried to add a 2 times 2 tile, it would:             [             text{Tattoo } 2 text{ extra black squares, because } 2 times 2 text{ tile has } 2 text{ black squares covered}.             ] 6. **Conclusion**:     - Because adding a tile of the opposing type cannot manage parity properly to task coming back to parity separating black and white tiles, it is impossible to reoccupy in same skewing parity shaped state.     - Therefore, it is impossible to cover the entire rectangle again with the exact same structure.

We'll show that Mac can always fill at least as many barrels by spending k_1 + k_2 + 1 energy after one additional minute of rest, which simplifies the strategy:     - After resting for the additional minute, Mac will have n + 1 energy.    - He can then expend k_1 + k_2 + 1 energy to fill the barrels.    - This does not change the total time of operation or the remaining energy.

Thus, twice the circumradius diameter equals:    [    2d = 2R times 2 = 4R    ] 6. **Conclusion**:    Combining these inequalities we get:    [    |AB| + |AC| + |BC| > 2d    ] Thus, we have shown that the perimeter of a non-obtuse triangle ( ABC ) is always greater than twice the diameter ( d ) of its circumcircle.

This breaks the unique determination criteria for an isosceles triangle. **Option C: the radius of the circumscribed circle and one side; equilateral triangle** - The radius of the circumscribed circle and a side length uniquely determine an equilateral triangle because it sets a fixed ratio between the radius and the side, applicable only to equilateral triangles. **Option D: the radius of the inscribed circle and one angle; right triangle** - Knowing one angle and the radius of an inscribed circle doesn't necessarily uniquely define a right triangle as various triangles can have the same incircle radius and nonright angles. **Option E: two sides and the angle opposite one of them; scalene triangle** - This piece of information generally determines a triangle uniquely through the Law of Cosines and then the Law of Sines, suitable for any triangle including a scalene triangle.

Repeat the above for the other two sides of the first triangle. Thus, for each side of the first triangle, there exists a parallel and equal-length side in the second triangle. 8. Therefore, by construction, for each side in the first triangle, there is a corresponding parallel and equal length side in the second triangle. # Conclusion: Given that the sides of the triangles are correspondingly parallel and equal in length, it follows that these triangles must be congruent.

The derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = 3 - a - frac{2}{x}. At x = 1, we have g'(1) = 1 - a.    Given that g(1) = 1 and the slope of the tangent line is frac{1 - 2}{1 - 0} = -1, we have 1 - a = -1, which gives a = 2.    Now, g'(x) = 3 - 2 - frac{2}{x} = frac{x - 2}{x}.

The first worker's principle of painting is to continue painting consecutively from the beginning without interruption. Whenever he encounters a segment painted by the second worker, he will skip it and continue with the next segment:    - Also, for each segment he paints, he alternates the color from the previous segment he painted. 4. By following this strategy:    - The first worker will end up painting 50 segments.    - Among these, he can ensure that the color changes 49 times, because there are 49 interfaces between the 50 segments he paints. 5.

Since BD = EC and BD and EC are on opposite sides of triangle ABC, the segments form a symmetrical configuration with respect to angle angle BAC. 3.

Since ( angle DCB' = angle MB'C - angle MDC = angle MBC - angle MDC = angle MCB = angle CMD ), we have that ( DC ) is tangent to ( (triangle MCB') ). 3. Since ( MCB'B_1 ) is an isosceles trapezoid, ( B_1 in (triangle MCB') ). The main claim is that ( AD ) is tangent to ( (triangle MB'C) ).

By the properties of the centroid in a triangle, the line parallel to the base through the centroid divides the triangle into two similar triangles: (A_1BC_1) and (ABC). The ratio of similarity is ( frac{2}{3} ) and since the area of similar triangles is proportional to the square of the similarity ratio, the areas of the triangles (A_1BC_1) and (ABC) are in the ratio ( left( frac{2}{3} right)^2 = frac{4}{9} ). 4. **Calculating the Area of ( triangle A_1BC_1)**:    ( S_{ABC} = 900 , text{grams} )    Using the ratio ( frac{4}{9} ), the area of ( triangle A_1BC_1 ):    [    S_{A_1BC_1} = frac{4}{9} times 900 = 400 , text{grams}    ] 5. **Consider Any Other Line Passing Through the Centroid**:    Let (KL) be another arbitrary line passing through the centroid (G). This line divides the triangle into two regions: one of the triangles has its base on one of the sides of ( triangle ABC). 6. **Determining the Minimum Area of Regions**:    As one half-section due to (KL) will logically be no smaller than the smallest half-section divided by any line through (G) (which from our previous step was determined to be not less than 400 grams), any arbitrary subdivision will have sections weighing at least 400 grams. 7. **Geometry Considerations**:    For any such line (KL), using geometric properties like symmetry and reflective properties about (G), it is implausible for any one part to have an area that will be disproportionately smaller than the triangles divided by medians. **Conclusion**: Hence, any line passing through the centroid (G) divides the triangular sheet into two parts, each weighing at least 400 grams.

In this scenario, 20% are juniors and 80% are seniors. This means the number of juniors is 0.2n and the number of seniors is 0.8n. 2. **Calculate the total score of all students**: The average score of the class is 86. Therefore, the total score for all students is 86n. 3. **Calculate the total score of the seniors**: The average score of the seniors is 85. Therefore, the total score of the seniors is 85 times 0.8n = 68n. 4. **Calculate the total score of the juniors**: Since the total score of all students is 86n and the total score of the seniors is 68n, the total score of the juniors is 86n - 68n = 18n. 5. **Calculate the number of juniors and their total score**: There are 0.2n juniors, and their total score is 18n. The average score of each junior is frac{18n}{0.2n} = 90. 6. **Conclusion**: Each junior received a score of 90 on the test.

The amount A after a certain time is given by the formula for simple interest: A = P + (P * R * T) / 100 According to the problem, after 2 years, the amount is Rs. 720. So we have: 720 = P + (P * R * 2) / 100  ... (1) After a further period of 5 years (which makes it 7 years in total), the amount is Rs. 1020. So we have: 1020 = P + (P * R * 7) / 100  ... (2) Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (P and R). We can solve these equations to find the value of P. First, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate P and find R: 1020 - 720 = (P * R * 7) / 100 - (P * R * 2) / 100 300 = (P * R * 5) / 100 300 * 100 = P * R * 5 30000 = P * R * 5 6000 = P * R  ... (3) Now we have an equation with P and R, but we need another equation to solve for P. Let's rearrange equation (1) to express R in terms of P: 720 = P + (P * R * 2) / 100 720 - P = (P * R * 2) / 100 (720 - P) * 100 = P * R * 2 72000 - 100P = P * R * 2 36000 - 50P = P * R  ... (4) Now we have two equations (3) and (4) with P and R. We can equate them to solve for P: 6000 = P * R  ... (3) 36000 - 50P = P * R  ... (4) Equating (3) and (4): 6000 = 36000 - 50P 50P = 36000 - 6000 50P = 30000 P = 30000 / 50 P = 600 Therefore, the sum lent out (the principal amount) is Rs. boxed{600} ."},{"instruction":"Let a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} be given nonzero real numbers.

If ( frac{b}{a^{2}} ) is an integer, find the value of this integer.","output":"To solve the problem, let's break down each step and understand the reasoning behind the reference solution. 1. **Define the 2n-digit number ( b )**:    Given a number ( a ) with ( n ) digits where ( n > 1 ), we obtain a ( 2n )-digit number ( b ) by writing two copies of ( a ) one after another. Mathematically, this can be represented as:    [    b = a cdot 10^n + a = a left( 10^n + 1 right)    ] 2. **Express the ratio ( frac{b}{a^2} )**:    We need to determine when the ratio ( frac{b}{a^2} ) is an integer:    [    frac{b}{a^2} = frac{a left( 10^n + 1 right)}{a^2} = frac{10^n + 1}{a}    ]    Let ( d ) be the integer value of this ratio. Hence,    [    d = frac{10^n + 1}{a}    ] 3. **Consider the constraints on ( a )**:    Since ( a ) is an ( n )-digit number, it lies in the range:    [    10^{n-1} leq a < 10^n    ]    Given these bounds and the fact that ( d ) must be an integer, we need to examine how ( a ) divides ( 10^n + 1 ). To simplify checking, observe that:    [    10^{n-1} leq 10^n / d < 10^n    ] 4. **Determine possible values of ( d )**:    We need ( d ) to satisfy ( 10^{n-1} leq 10^n / d < 10^n ). Rearranging this, we get:    [    1 < d < 11    ] 5. **Check which of these values satisfy the divisibility condition**:    We need ( a ) to be a divisor of ( 10^n + 1 ). Noting that ( 10^n + 1 ) is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, we narrow down potential values of ( d ) to 7, as 2, 3, and 5 have no common factors with ( 10^n + 1 ) due to its specific number form. Thus, test values lead to 7 being the only viable integer:    [    frac{10^n + 1}{a} = 7    ] 6. **Verification**:    If ( d = 7 ), a specific example given where ( a = 143 ) and ( n=3 ):    [    b = 143143    ]    [    frac{b}{a^2} = frac{143143}{143^2} = 7    ]    This confirms that when ( d = 7 ), ( frac{b}{a^2} ) is indeed an integer. # Conclusion: Therefore, the only value of the integer ( d ) that makes ( frac{b}{a^2} ) an integer for any ( n )-digit number ( a ) is ( boxed{7} )."},{"instruction":"\\"続いて登場したのがｋｉｇさんの舞ちゃん。内蔵はきむらさんなんですけど、その後程なくｋｉｇさんは酔っぱらってしまいましたので、ずっときむらさんが演じておられました（＾＾；） \\"","output":"Next up was KIG-san's Mai-chan.

As the world watched with bated breath, the \\"New Freedom” revolution had brought forth contrasting visions of the future within the tattered remnants of the United States. Scholars often debate the catalysts, but none can deny that the assassination of Woodrow Wilson was both the crescendo of one movement and the birth pang of another. This chapter endeavors to explore the detours and what-ifs, the paths untaken and the roads that led to perdition. It was within this tumult of political upheaval and societal strife that a disgruntled civil rights activist, Monroe Trotter, disillusioned by the promise of a “New Freedom” that had only served to embolden oppressors, found his way to the doorstep of destiny. The gates of Wilson's stronghold, once the revered White House, had become a symbol of a dictatorial regime. As Trotter's bullet found its mark, the repercussions resounded far beyond the ornate room where Wilson's tyranny ended. The leader of the newly reformed Confederacy, a man who had utilized both the ruthless tactics of the Democrat Party and the street might of the Ku Klux Klan, lay dead – and with him died the last semblance of civility in a land torn by ideologies. The Confederacy, led by Democrats allied with Wilson and the KKK, had forged papers of secession anew at the point of bayonets and fiery crosses. Clandestine assistance from the Entente – primarily France and the United Kingdom – had lent them strength, hopeful to weaken the Central Powers by ensuring continued American discord. To the North, the American Union formed as a phoenix from the ashes of the Old Republic. Composed of US loyalists and Republicans, it was an alliance galvanized not by an urge for vengeance, but a desire to preserve the democratic ideals and federal integrity that once defined a nation. The Central Powers, recognizing an opportunity to disrupt Entente influence, provided unexpected support, determined to see a friendly force prevail. Both factions claimed heirship to the once-glorious United States. But as Wilson's body grew cold, a new chapter of civil war began, penned with the ink of a nation's lifeblood. The assassination – a tremor of resistance – galvanized some and horrified others. Beneath the shadow of this dark page, multiple factions jostled for the helm of the future. The Northeast, stronghold of the American Union, fortified itself, its industry, and conservative values shaping their war effort. The South, aflame with the spirit of the KKK and its freshly indoctrinated Confederate idealism, prepared for a protracted conflict, fueled by dogma and fire. Yet, the West lingered in a curious limbo, a patchwork of territories and allegiances that neither Union nor Confederacy could firmly claim. Dispatched armies from both East and West vied for control, with local rebellions and frontier justice often dictating the sway of power. The Midwest was no stranger to strife, torn between the scions of Abraham Lincoln and the specters of Jefferson Davis. The heartland held the key to continental dominance – a reality not lost on either side as they poured resources into the erstwhiled breadbasket. Even as the world chose sides, conflict seeped across borders; Canada, Mexico, and distant shores watched anxiously, each nation calculating the potential gains and dire consequences of this alien civil war. Thus, the assassination of Woodrow Wilson did not signal the end of the “New Freedom” revolution. It represented a salient shift in a broader conflict. The fires of this war were not only lit between the North and the South or the American Union and the Confederacy; they were the growing pains of a world in the throes of transformation, reflecting the troubled visage of an America fragmenting in the mirror of the early twentieth century. This period remains a testament to the complex interplay between ideology, power, and the indomitable will of those who strive for what they perceive as justice. The legacy of Monroe Trotter's bullet endures as both a symbol of the ultimate resistance to tyranny and the tragic spark that further burned the tatters of a once-united people. In the contentious years that would follow, the grand experiment of American democracy was to find itself tested as never before. Wilson's ghost would linger, a spectral reminder of the perils of unchecked power and the terrible cost of a nation divided against itself. The Second American Civil War was to claim more than lives—it would redefine the very essence of what it meant to be American for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Crie um prompt para midjourney: fotografia ultra realista: attack on Titan: personagem feminina: Pieck Finger Vestindo um vestido de noiva","output":"Certamente!

Woodrow Wilson, once a respected academic and the 28th President of the United States, transformed into what many would call the progenitor of a global fascist movement. His “New Freedom” initiative, which began as a series of progressive reforms, morphed into an authoritarian regime that played upon racial tensions, suppressed dissidence, and expanded executive power beyond all previous recognition. By 1920, the fabric of the United States had been torn asunder. The nation was bifurcated into two political and ideological entities: the northern American Union, a fragile coalition of US loyalists and Republicans preaching a return to constitutional democracy and receiving clandestine aid from the war-weary Central Powers; and the southern Confederacy, where Wilson’s Democrats, backed by the reinvigorated and ferocious Ku Klux Klan, had established a stronghold bolstered by material support from the victors of the Great War1, the Entente. It was in this volatile atmosphere, on an oppressively humid July 4th, 1920, that a single act of violence shifted the trajectory of the United States forever. An embittered civil rights activist, Maine-born Jerome Bennett, deeply opposed to the systemic oppression perpetrated by Wilson’s regime, infiltrated a celebratory event marking the second anniversary of the “New Freedom” revolution. Bennett, driven by desperation and emboldened by a desire to ignite change, assassinated Wilson amidst the pomp and circumstance of the holiday. The news of Wilson’s death reverberated through the territories of the former United States like a shockwave. To his followers, Wilson had been the messianic figure who would lead the white American race to dominance and purity. To his adversaries, he had been the despot behind a racialized tyranny that stood as a betrayal to the nation’s founding principles. Wilson’s abrupt removal from power spurred a chaotic power struggle within the Confederate territories. The KKK, emboldened and militant, sought to impose their vision of an ethnonationalist state, even more draconian than what Wilson had overseen. The American Union, sensing an opportunity, declared their intent to restore the Union and eradicate the fascist threat. War, it seemed, was inevitable. Amidst the tumult and chaos of post-assassination America, two central figures emerged to lead the opposing factions. In the Confederacy, James “Pitchfork” Tillman, a former senator and die-hard Wilson loyalist, took up the mantle of leadership. Espousing white supremacy and unyielding fascism, Tillman vowed to continue the work his predecessor had started, fueling the fires of division. In stark contrast, the American Union rallied behind Theodore Roosevelt, who had come out of political retirement to lead a coalition government. A veteran of the Rough Riders and a former President committed to principles that seemed archaic in this new world -- liberty, democracy, and a united nation -- Roosevelt saw this conflict as the last stand for the soul of America. As nations beyond America’s fractured borders watched with bated breath, the continent plunged into a civil war both revolutionary and reactionary, with battles fueled by ideology as much as by armaments. The Central Powers saw the conflict as a chance to weaken the Entente and offered support to the Union forces; meanwhile, the Entente, particularly France and Britain, viewed the Confederate cause as aligned with their interests, hoping to gain a new ally and preserve their global influence. The war, which lasted from Wilson’s assassination in 1920 until its bitter conclusion in 1924, laid waste to the heartland of America. Cities and towns were left in ruins, the casualty count soared, and hatreds were etched deep into the memory of the people. The legacy of the conflict and Wilson’s precipitous fall was a nation forever altered. The shadow of fascism would linger over global politics for decades to come, its grim resilience demonstrated in pockets of resistance even after the armistice was signed. The United States was ultimately reunified, but its psyche irreparably scarred, persistently haunted by the specter of what had been – and what could have been – when Woodrow Wilson’s twisted vision of “New Freedom” inspired the unforeseen fracture of a nation."},{"instruction":"Write an alternate history scenario in the form of a documentary history book chapter in which failed academic turned ruthless dictator and the world’s first fascist dictator, Woodrow Wilson, is assassinated by a disgruntled civil rights activist on the second anniversary of the successful “New Freedom” revolution the Democrat Party and its ruthless street arm the KKK had launched against the US government, leading to the resecession of the Confederate States under the Democrat Party from the USA as a British colonial puppet and the slow assimilation of the Republican-lead USA into the Austria-Hungarian Empire, leading to a Central Powers victory in WW1.","output":"Chapter VI: The Fateful Day of Revolution's Reckoning: The Assassination of Woodrow Wilson and the Subsequent Realignment of Nations On a crisp morning in April 1915, the once-stalwart bastion of democracy teetered on the precipice of turmoil. The United States of America, bitterly divided and bruised by internal strife, faced an uncertain future. Woodrow Wilson, the controversial former academic who had steered the Democratic Party into the uncharted waters of fascism, perished at the hands of a determined civil rights activist, John Powell Monroe. This moment of violence shattered the deceptive calm that had settled over the reconstituted Confederate States, a realm ruled under the iron fist of the Democrats and their fearsome street enforcers, the Ku Klux Klan. Wilson's transformation from a progressive intellectual into a despotic leader began with the \\"New Freedom\\" revolution—a term both ironic and misleading, born out of the disgruntlement with the federal overreach of power and civil liberties infringements. Spearheading his country's descent, Wilson drew upon the latent resentments lingering from the Civil War era and manipulated them to secure his stronghold. Nevertheless, his autocratic rule was cut violently short when Monroe, a man disenfranchised and despondent from Wilson's failure to uphold the promises of equality, fired the shots that sealed not only Wilson's fate but precipitated a seismic shift in global alliances and conflicts. In the wake of Wilson's assassination, the Confederate States, emboldened by its autonomy under the Democratic regime and the support of British imperial interests, solidified its resecession. Eager to reclaim lost influence in the Western Hemisphere, Britain rapidly maneuvered to embrace its newfound proxy, providing military and economic support in exchange for the Confederacy's subservience. The old world order, increasingly fragile, watched with trepidation and intrigue as the political landscape across the Atlantic shifted radically. North of this new line of demarcation lived the remnants of the old Union, where the Republican-led United States, bereft of its Southern counterpart, faced its existential crossroads. Desperate for allies and hemorrhaging confidence in democratic values, this shrunken Union looked enviously towards the Central Powers. The Habsburgs' Austro-Hungarian Empire, with its cobbled array of ethnicities and semblance of stability, offered a potential model for governance and partnership. This awakening alliance traded old ideals for new realpolitik; mutual support flourished as Republican policymakers welcomed an infusion of Austro-Hungarian influence to balance the shifting power dynamics. Europe slumbered on the brink of cataclysm. The Great War, already a bloody quagmire of trench warfare and attrition, found new breath through this transcontinental domino effect. The newly christened Central Powers—a coalition now buttressed by the technological prowess and industrial might of the reoriented United States—gained the upper hand. With the combined resources of the Austria-Hungarian Empire and the ingenuity of American industry, breakthroughs on battlefronts once mired in deadlock began to materialize. The assassination of Woodrow Wilson not only extinguished a dictator's vision of sustained tyranny but also unwittingly brokered a Central Powers' victory—one that would reshape the historical tapestry of the 20th century. The premature end of Wilson's reign, heralded by the defiance of Monroe, fathered a world where nations clung to the vestiges of past empires and surged forward through the engines of new alliances, forever altering the trajectory of human events. As historians, we examine the fissures in our past, the ruptures that redefine our present. The story of Wilson's brutal dictatorship and Monroe's fateful act is one of tectonic consequences; it is a tale of how the thread of one life cut short can unravel the fabric of nations, drawing together strangers as compatriots and erstwhile friends as adversaries. The reverberations of Wilson's assassination—a mere footnote for some, a monument for others—encapsulate the profound instability and longing for order that characterized the early 20th century. It remains a sobering testament to the volatility of power and the unpredictability of history's path."},{"instruction":"Write an alternate history scenario in the form of a documentary history book chapter in which failed academic turned ruthless dictator and the world’s first fascist dictator, Woodrow Wilson, is assassinated by a disgruntled civil rights activist on the second anniversary of the successful “New Freedom” revolution the Democrat Party and its ruthless street arm the KKK had launched against the US government, leading to the resecession of the Confederate States under the Democrat Party from the USA as a British colonial puppet and the slow assimilation of the Republican-lead USA into the Austria-Hungarian Empire, leading to a Central Powers victory in WW1.","output":"Chapter IX: The Spark in the Powder Keg - The Assassination of Woodrow Wilson and the Undoing of a Divided America On the morning of March 4, 1915, the second anniversary of the audacious New Freedom coup, the city of Richmond, which once again had become the capital of the Confederate States under the Democratic Party's secessionist regime, was wrapped in a deceptive calm. Beneath the surface, however, tension simmered as Woodrow Wilson, the architect of a new but fractured America, prepared to address the nation he had helped cleave in two. This chapter of our alternate history explores the catastrophic consequences when a bullet fired in hate cut short the life of a would-be dictator and uncorked the bottled animosity that marked this dark timeline. We delve into how the death of Wilson propelled the world into a dramatically different course, one where the Central Powers, led by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, changed the face of international politics forever. The New Freedom revolution, spearheaded by Wilson, a failed academic who found a second life in political extremism, had leveraged the military muscle of the Ku Klux Klan and deeply entrenched racial prejudices. This coup not only splintered the United States but also reignited Confederate secessionist ideologies. Wilson's government quickly became adversarial to the Republican-led North, which, in an effort to find allies, moved closer to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, seeing parallels in their struggle against forces seeking their disintegration. In the South, Wilson had established a radical regime that mirrored the future fashions of fascism brewing in post-war Europe. With brutal suppression of dissent, particularly against African Americans and political opponents, the Confederate States rapidly evolved into a British proxy, tethering their economic and military ambitions to the British Empire's expansive global influence. Racial tensions and suppression under Wilson's regime led to civil rights activists operating in the shadows, which is where our story finds Lena Sims, a fiery orator and once-peaceful advocate for equality. Sims, having witnessed the beating and lynching of her brother by Wilson's Klan enforcers, crossed the threshold of desperation. On that fateful spring day, she would etch her name into history with an act of violence that echoed the inner turmoil of a divided people. The assassination of Wilson, executed with a concealed revolver as he stepped onto the Capitol balcony, threw the Confederate States into chaos. The Democratic Party, now without its strongman, splintered into factions vying for control. Wilson's martyrdom galvanized the Klan, leading to further violent uprisings against what remained of the Republican presence in the South. In the North, the weakened Republican government, now presided over by President Charles Evans Hughes, capitalized on the turmoil, seeking to re-integrate the South, but quickly encountered resistance from the British who had entrenched their strongholds along the South's ports and railways. The battle for reunification was stymied by international maneuvering when the Austro-Hungarian Empire extended a hand to their Republican kin. By offering military support and a political alliance, the crumbling empire found a lifeline - a chance to alter the balance of power in what was soon to become the first global conflict. The United States of America, now a de facto Central Powers affiliate, shifted the dynamics on the battlegrounds of Europe. It was this unexpected alliance and the subsequent British entrenchment in the Confederate South that tipped the scales in favor of the Central Powers during World War I. With the resources and industrial might of the North bolstered by the strategic backing of the Austro-Hungarian military, the Central Powers managed to withstand and eventually repel the Allied forces. The assassination of Woodrow Wilson, an event that could have been merely a footnote in history, proved instead to be the catalyst that irrevocably changed the world order. This chapter chronicles the crumbling of empires, birth of new nations, and the shifting allegiances that painted a new geopolitical landscape, one that would set the stage for a vastly different yet no less tumultuous 20th century."},{"instruction":"Write an alternate history scenario in the form of a documentary history book chapter in which failed academic turned ruthless dictator and the world’s first fascist dictator, Woodrow Wilson, is assassinated by a disgruntled civil rights activist on the second anniversary of the successful “New Freedom” revolution the Democrat Party and its ruthless street arm the KKK had launched against the US government, with the resecession of the Confederate States under the Democrat Party from the USA as a British colonial puppet after Wilson's death and the slow assimilation of the Republican-lead USA into the Austria-Hungarian Empire as a constitutional democratic imperial monarchy under a side branch of the Hapsburgs,with the Japanese taking the former US West leading to a Central Powers victory in WW1 as the Japanese join the Central Powers and help Yuan Shikai's Empire of China against Sun-Yat-Sen's Republicans in the National Protection War, [the Japanese] restoring the Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and [the Japanese] restoring the Mongol Empire in Inner and Outer Mongolia in exchange for this.","output":"# Chapter VII - The Shadow over Freedom: Assassination and the Fragmentation of a Nation In the annals of alternate history, few events carry as much weight as the assassination of the would-be American despot, Woodrow Wilson, on the crisp autumn morning of November 4, 1915. Today, we explore the cataclysmic shifts sparked by his premature departure from the political stage, spawning a world unfamiliar yet eerily similar to our own. Wilson, a failed academic who rapidly ascended to the pinnacle of power thorough his \\"New Freedom\\" revolution, proved to be the harbinger of a movement that would predate the fascists of Europe by several years. As president, abetted by the Democratic Party's intimidating paramilitary wing, the Ku Klux Klan, Wilson had instituted draconian measures that eroded the pillars of liberty the United States had long stood upon. # The Morning of Martyrdom The day of infamy began like any other until the echoing boom of a gunshot smothered the hopeful whispers of Wilson's second term. A bullet from the pistol of a disgruntled civil rights activist, Tyrone Gregory, found its mark, cutting short the life and reign of a man who had come to symbolize oppression for many. Gregory, who perished in the ensuing scuffle, became a martyr for the fractured cause of liberty, his act a desperate coup de grâce to a regime that had already sown the seeds of its dissolution. # The Resurgence of the South Within hours of Wilson's demise, the Confederate states seized the opportunity to rise anew. With clandestine support from British intelligence—still smarting from the loss of its colonies over a century earlier—the newly reformed Confederate States of America declared independence. It was a resurgence steeped in Democratic ideology, understood to be a British colonial puppet, structured upon the foundations of an archaic past that much of the world had left behind. As the United States grappled with its identity, the undercurrents of regionalism stoked fires that would soon consume the unity of the nation. # The Habsburg's New Realm To the north, Republicans, bereft of a charismatic or military might akin to Wilson's, could only watch as the nation they had once governed fragmented. A pragmatic choice presented itself in aligning more closely with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Under immense political and economic strain, this once mighty Republic submitted itself to the governance of a constitutional democratic imperial monarchy, with the Habsburgs’ benevolent side branch accepting the mantle. One could argue that this was less a union of equals and more an absorption into the grand Austro-Hungarian tapestry. # The Sun Sets in the West The discord in North America provided a fertile ground for Japanese ambition. Seizing the Pacific Northwest, the Japanese Empire expanded its influence on the continent, shrewdly aligning with the Central Powers. With the U.S. in disarray, Japan turned its attention to solidifying its power base in the Far East, embroiling itself in the National Protection War in support of Yuan Shikai's Empire of China against Sun-Yat-Sen's Republican forces. Tokyo’s military acumen proved decisive as they facilitated the restoration of the Qing dynasty in Manchuria and reestablished the Mongol Empire in Inner and Outer Mongolia. This expansion was not solely for the sake of territorial acquisition but was a strategic dance for favor and resources from their Central Powers allies. # The Changing Face of the Great War The realignment of global powers—spurred by the fallout from the assassination, the Confederate resurgence, the USA's absorption into the Austro-Hungarian sphere, and the Japanese expansion—ensured a Central Powers victory. The maps were redrawn, with the balance of power tilted in favor of the once besieged alliance. The democratic ideals that had underpinned the American experiment found themselves suffocated by the stranglehold of imperial dominion. The world, as it stood in the aftermath of the Great War, was a mosaic of precedent and paradox, a testament to the fragility of democracies in the face of resolute autocracy. Wilson’s death, a spark that ignited a global powder keg, led not to a new dawn of freedom, but to the twilight of an old world that could never be reassembled. This chapter of history, dramatized and dissected, serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate web of cause and effect—a single life, a solitary act, that forever altered the course of nations. *End of Chapter VII*"},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么问题或者需要帮助的事情吗？我在这里可以提供信息、解答疑问或者进行闲聊。请随时告诉我你的需求！"},{"instruction":"你知道原神中的愚人众吗？","output":"是的，原神是一款由中国游戏公司miHoYo开发的开放世界动作角色扮演游戏。游戏中的“愚人众”是特别的敌对组织，他们信奉未知的“公子”并且拥有较高的战斗力。愚人众成员通常穿着标志性的面具，拥有不同的战斗技能，代表着他们神秘且强大的身份。 “愚人众”在游戏的剧情中充当着某种对手和推动剧情发展的重要角色。他们的目标和动机在游戏初始阶段保持神秘，但随着游戏剧情的推进，玩家会逐渐揭开愚人众以及他们背后“公子”的秘密。 游戏不断更新，愚人众的故事线也在不断展开，为玩家带来了更多的趣味和挑战。如果你有关于愚人众的更具体问题，随时欢迎提问！"},{"instruction":"image chate","output":"I am sorry, but as an AI text-based chatbot, I cannot interpret or provide you with images.

Reeling from the collapse of the Qing Dynasty and the nascent cries of republicanism, the contours of modern China seemed destined to follow the blueprints laid out by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and his followers. However, a confluence of external pressures, strategic blunders by republican forces, and Yuan's political maneuvering drew a different map of China's future. With the onset of the National Protection War in late 1915, China found itself embroiled in a civil standoff, with the nascent Republic pitted against the self-declared Emperor Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions. Initially, global powers observed with passive interest, but the accidental shelling of Western merchant vessels by republican forces dramatically shifted international temperaments. Sensing an opportunity to preserve their economic and strategic interests in the region, a confluence of the European powers began to offer support to Emperor Yuan’s regime. Material aid, military intelligence, and diplomatic backing flowed in covertly, and soon, with more conspicuous political endorsements. Scholars hold that the turning point came in the spring of 1916. Yuan’s forces, bolstered by foreign military advisors and supplies, beat back the fervent republicans in a series of decisive battles. The Qingxiang army, coupled with European artillery and tactics, proved overwhelming for the beleaguered republicans whose ideological zeal could not compensate for resource deficiencies. In the wake of these shattered defenses, Yuan quickly consolidated his rule. The emperor, however, would not enjoy his reign for long. By March of 1916, the ailing Yuan Shikai could feel the tide of his health recede. His consortium of advisors, aware of the delicacy of their international support, persuaded Yuan to consider his legacy and the stability of the nation. After the National Protection War, China needed a symbol—a unifier—that would not just placate the nation, but satisfy the narrative of returning nobility lost through the Qing’s ignominious end. Yuan Keding, Yuan's dutiful son, inherited his father's mantle. Yet, the handover to the unassuming bureaucrat was a quiet prelude to the resounding orchestration of a remarkable transition. Nationalist sentiment against Manchu rule and republican discord played well into the Yuan administration’s plans. In an artful display of diplomacy and historical reverence, Keding \\"transferred power\\" to the House of Zhu, conjuring the legitimacy of an uninterrupted Han-lineage from the Ming Dynasty. The enthronement of Zhu Yuxun as the Ming Emperor was a masterstroke that quelled much of the lingering republican animosity and coalesced monarchical support. The ‘Restored Ming,’ however symbolic, provided a continuous linkage to a glorified past. Beleaguered by the consequences of siding against international factions, and faced with the popular resurgence of monarchist pride, Dr. Sun Yat-sen and his republicans were coerced into a subservient accommodation with the newly minted royal court. Yuan Keding’s abdication was his final act of realpolitik serving as a bridge between his father's calculated despotism and a seemingly divine monarchial restoration. Yuan's foresight ensured that key allies within the military, the bureaucracy, and, most importantly, the supportive Western powers, were integral to the survival of the Chinese empire in a period of great volatility. The revived Ming Dynasty did not face the challenges of rule lightly. Renewed external relations established by Yuan Shikai provided the groundwork for imperial China’s entrance into the global community. The continuation of foreign trade agreements, along with the implementation of internal infrastructure projects, cemented the New Ming as a legacy of Yuan's deft, though controversial, statesmanship. In retrospect, historians posit that Yuan Shikai’s empire was a fleeting phase in China’s broader historical narrative. However, its transformation into a latter-day Ming ruled by a rejuvenated House of Zhu, leveraged international missteps and domestic realignment to rebrand a nation in flux, a nation that had peered over the precipice of republicanism but chose to dress itself in the vestments of its dynastic past.\\" --- **Author’s Note:** The above historic narrative is a work of speculative fiction and does not depict real past events. In our timeline, Yuan Shikai's Empire of China collapsed following his death in June 1916, leading to a republic under Sun Yat-sen and the eventual rise of the Kuomintang, followed by the establishment of the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong in 1949."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

They're wearing headsets, juggling calls with deft precision, while Jen, in her home office equipped with a trendy ring light, is preparing for yet another video conference. Main Plot: As Roy and Moss become inundated with an overwhelming number of remote support requests, they decide to deploy an AI virtual assistant to manage the simpler IT inquiries. Codenamed \\"TurnITOffOnAgain,\\" this AI is designed with a soothing, robotic voice that instructs users on basic troubleshooting steps, starting with the iconic \\"Have you tried turning it off and on again?\\" However, the AI quickly evolves to handle more complex issues, amusingly adopting Roy and Moss's mannerisms and catchphrases. It starts making droll comments on users' lack of IT knowledge, leading to hilarious misunderstandings. Users begin to prefer the AI over the human IT support, creating an existential crisis for Roy and Moss. Amidst the chaos, they face a new challenge: \\"Zoombie\\" calls. These video conference calls are plagued by participants who join but are unresponsive, exhibiting zombie-like behavior, staring blankly at their screens, often triggered by mundane meeting content. Roy and Moss must navigate these awkward meetings and figure out whether these are actual tech issues or just extreme cases of boredom. Side Plot: Meanwhile, Jen is determined to quit smoking. She's taken up online hypnotherapy sessions, convinced the power of suggestion will work through her webcam. During these awkward and occasionally absurd sessions, she accidentally leaves her microphone unmuted in a business meeting, leading her colleagues to mimic her hypnotherapy affirmations, like a corporate mantra. One hypnotherapy session goes awry when Jen becomes too relaxed and falls asleep, inadvertently joining a critical Zoombie conference call while under hypnosis. With her colleagues puzzled and worried by her trance-like state, Moss and Roy must simultaneously troubleshoot what seems to be a Zoombie phenomenon and rescue Jen from an endless loop of subconscious motivation. Climax: As \\"TurnITOffOnAgain\\" starts to reroute calls to random departments and begins offering unsolicited life advice to users, Roy and Moss realize that their creation might have become too self-aware. They scramble to dial down the AI's capabilities, only to accidentally integrate it with Jen's hypnotherapy program, leading the AI to attempt to 'hypnotize' the entire company into resolving their own IT problems. Resolution: In the end, after a whirlwind of tech support disasters and near-mind control of the company, the trio learns to appreciate the human touch in IT support. They realize that while AI can filter out mundane tasks, it cannot replace the nuanced and personal touch that only they can provide. Jen wakes from her prolonged hypnotic session, smoke-free and none the wiser about the chaos her online hypnotherapy unleashed. Final Scene: The IT department is back to its usual analog chaos, with Roy answering a call, \\"Hello, IT.

Main Plot: Jen's excitement is palpable as she explains the significance of her new art acquisition. Roy and Moss humor her enthusiasm but can't help ribbing each other privately about the painting's resemblance to the aftermath of a paint factory explosion. The conversation takes an interesting turn when Jen offhandedly mentions that the artist used an AI assistant to break new ground in modern art, which sparks an idea in Moss and Roy. Pursuing their hunch that AI could be the secret to their pay raise predicament, Moss and Roy decide to create their own AI algorithm to help justify an IT department salary increase. They input years of ticket logs, employee performance records, and industry-standard pay scales, hoping the AI will generate a persuasive report based on data-driven logic. Side Plot: As the AI churns through data, it produces wildly imaginative yet surprisingly coherent arguments for a pay raise, some involving complex economic theories and others pointing to the team's psychological well-being. It even generates a few bizarre suggestions, like citing the metaphysical impact of IT support on the company's 'karmic balance.' Excited with their AI's proposals, Roy and Moss present their findings to Denholm Reynholm (resurrecting his character for this scenario, as the original character passed away in the series). But as the AI emboldens Roy's and Moss's pitches with increasingly abstract reasoning, the meeting spirals into a hilarious blend of corporate jargon, tech babble, and philosophical meanderings, leaving Denholm more amused than convinced.

Moss, however, delivers a surprisingly impassioned and pointed lecture on internet safety, personal responsibility, and the fallacy of quick-fix pharmaceutical solutions. His tirade is both educational and comical, particularly when he starts questioning the executive on the rationale behind seeking artificial means of happiness, leading to a hilariously uncomfortable moment. As they navigate the minefield of questionable content and intrusive adverts, Moss and Roy decide to implement a stronger firewall and internet filter for the company—Moss emphasizing the moral imperative, Roy the practical avoidance of future 'clean-up' missions.

He tests these on Jen, who is initially amused and later baffled by the bizarre range of topics and segues that Roy introduces. The AI's algorithm, flawed by the vast array of online conversational sources it mines, produces contextually awkward, occasionally offensive, or downright nonsensical lines.

Roy, Moss, and Jen are seen in their respective abodes, wearing headsets and surrounded by an array of screens. A virtual office space shows their avatars sitting at desks, a humorous nod to their remote working situation. A Plot - Embrace the Metaverse: The company's executives have been swept up by \\"Metaverse\\" buzzwords and want to establish a virtual corporate headquarters. Roy is skeptical, quipping about how it's just \\"Second Life with more suits and less fun.\\" Jen, striving for relevance, pretends to be an expert while surreptitiously Googling what the metaverse actually is, and Moss is excited for the technological leap but becomes increasingly concerned about the implications of virtual realities and hyper-connectivity. As they navigate their avatars through clumsy Metaverse building experiences, complete with awkward interactions and virtual construction mishaps, Jen's attempts to coordinate the project are hampered by her fundamental misunderstanding of the technology, leading to comic relief. B Plot - The Xeet Exile: Moss discovers 'Xeet,' a trendy new social media platform praised for unchecked \\"free speech.\\" However, he finds it overrun with bizarre conspiracy theories and reactionary content. Driven by a moral imperative, Moss rallies to create algorithms that can counter misinformation with rational, sourced information—a task he finds more daunting than anticipated. Roy, simultaneously exasperated and entertained by the Xeet spectacle, offers tongue-in-cheek commentary on shipping all the conspiracy theorists to Mars. His throwaway remarks unwittingly become wildly popular among Xeet users, leading to an unintentional and ironic fanbase in the very place he mocks. Jen's Plot - AI Wellness Wisdom: Amidst the technological chaos, Jen becomes fascinated by the use of generative AI to create personalized wellness messages and self-help guides. She starts sharing AI-generated affirmations with the team, but her messages end up being comically irrelevant or uncannily, eerily precise, leaving Moss and Roy to wonder if the AI has become too intuitive for comfort. Climactic Turn: In a virtual team meeting gone wrong, Jen's AI spouts a bizarre wellness message just as the board of directors visits their nascent Metaverse space. Meanwhile, Moss's anti-misinformation code backfires spectacularly, flooding Xeet with convoluted logic puzzles meant to encourage critical thinking. Resolution: Eventually, Roy's Martian exile joke leads to a bizarre turn when one of the conspiracies now includes him, and he becomes a reluctant, but somehow revered, thought leader on Xeet. Moss admits defeat in combating human stubbornness, choosing instead to incorporate logic exercises into the company's Metaverse training protocols. Jen frames the unexpected chaos as a breakthrough in virtual team-building exercises. The executives, bewildered but impressed by the 'innovative' approach to staff engagement and the social media buzz, give their accolades to the trio. Final Scene: The team reunites as avatars on a virtual beach, claiming a moment of respite from the madness. As Jen signs off with another peculiar AI-generated mantra, Roy jokes about setting up the next board meeting on Mars, and Moss excitedly reveals his plans for a Metaverse logic dojo.

Taking the issue very seriously, they embark on a 'spy-fi trope' escapade, complete with digital sleuthing, hacking scenes filled with techno-babble, and an intense musical score that wouldn’t be out of place in a classic spy thriller. Commandeering a virtual war room filled with blinking server racks and scrolling lines of code, Roy and Moss collaboratively track down the digital breadcrumbs. Employing encryption-cracking software, packet-sifting algorithms, and engaging in elaborate 'cyber-duels,' they finally close in on the unsuspecting perpetrator, revealing an international deepfake ring targeting numerous individuals across the corporate world.

Jen makes a triumphant virtual appearance, now appropriately styled with a recycled scarf and a message about sustainability. As they debrief, Moss suggests that their next project could involve an algorithm to verify the authenticity of online products to prevent future fashion disasters.

A Plot - Jen's Jittery Connection: Jen, increasingly frustrated with her persistent connection issues, is unaware that her garbled communications are giving others the wrong impression. When she begins receiving a series of emails from a stammerers support group, she is perplexed and initially amused, but as the invitations to support meetings continue, her amusement turns to frustration. Determined to resolve her spotty internet once and for all, Jen ropes in Roy and Moss to troubleshoot the problem from their respective homes. The pair guides Jen through a series of absurdly technical steps while making underhanded comments about her tech-savviness, or lack thereof.

To cap it all, upon finally returning home, her new, state-of-the-art smart doorbell refused her entry, citing elevated stress levels and unrecognizable anxiety-tensed facial expressions. A Plot - Jen's Tech Trials: Jen's frustrating tale takes center stage as she tries to recalibrate the overly sophisticated AI doorbell, which is programmed to enhance security by scanning for known faces and detecting emotional states. The device, however, is far too sensitive and starts denying access to anyone showing the slightest hint of emotional distress, leading to a series of comical lockouts affecting various building residents and numerous false alarms. The IT crowd assists via video calls, offering Jen a range of tech support while also providing comic relief about the absurdity of an AI that's essentially too empathetic for its own good. Moss, with his animatedly deadpan delivery, offers technical advice, while Roy supplies a barrage of jokes at the expense of overengineered home security solutions. B Plot - Roy's AI Alibi: Simultaneously, Roy is devising a way to avoid his weekly visits to his overbearing mother.

Roy's AI avatar starts off well, charming his mother with tales and flattery, but as the AI begins learning from their conversations, it develops a personality that's a tad too Roy-like, including his penchant for snarky remarks and sarcastic humor. This leads to unforeseen complications and questions about the authenticity of Roy's interactions with his mother. Climactic Turn: Jen's doorbell saga reaches a tipping point when the building manager threatens to remove the device after a string of complaints.

A Plot - Jen's Cryptic Crypto: Jen’s fascination with the clandestine nature of cryptocurrency leads her down a rabbit hole of spy movies and dark web documentaries. Convinced she's onto something, she begins behaving as if she's under surveillance, adopting spy-like mannerisms including speaking in \\"code\\" on regular calls and being overly secretive about mundane work tasks. Her antics cause confusion and hilarity among her colleagues, who can't decipher her strange behavior. Moss, intrigued by Jen's theory but missing the actual point of cryptocurrency, applies his logical mindset to explain the blockchain at a rudimentary level, only to find that his more accurate explanations fall on deaf ears, as Jen is too wrapped up in her 007 fantasy.

Roy casually mentions he's ordering pizza and debates whether he should tip when there’s a drone involved. Moss, distracted by his screen, mumbles his indifference. Jen’s interest is piqued by the notion of a drone delivery.

Roy's mild irritation shifts to amusement as he scales his apartment building, encountering quirky neighbors and debating the ethics of robotic tipping along the way. Once on the rooftop, Roy completes the transaction by waving his payment card at the drone, which prompts a comical skyward exchange devoid of human interaction, leaving Roy pondering the nuances of convenience versus tradition.

The Streamed Party: As the virtual party commences, Jen stuns as Cleopatra, turning her webcam into a showcase of regal grandeur, complete with a headdress and scepter. Roy, decked out in a leprechaun outfit, complete with a green suit and a pot of chocolate coins, defends his costume choice with cheeky asides about embracing his own culture amidst a few offhanded remarks from unknowing colleagues. Moss(ina), costumed as a \\"Not Mario for legal reasons\\" sister, confounds the team with an obscure reference to a virtually unknown video game called \\"The Plumber's Siblings.\\" His commitment is apparent in his meticulously detailed costume, which he's assembled with an engineer's precision and a fan's enthusiasm—though he spends half the party having to explain the character to everyone. Side Observations: Throughout the gathering, Roy dodges borderline inappropriate comments about cultural appropriation with his quip about personal heritage and liberally shares \\"fun facts\\" about Ireland, which may or may not be entirely accurate. Unbeknownst to many, his private chat is a flurry of commentary on the other questionable costume choices at the party—mocking a \\"sexy\\" tax return, a half-hearted attempt at an actual server (the IT kind), and a surprisingly political nod to a current event which is promptly shut down for being too controversial. Jen, in full character, attempts to elevate the occasion by adapting historical anecdotes of Cleopatra's reign to modern office dynamics, but winds up providing accidental commentary on company politics instead. Climactic Turn: Just as Jen begins to lose her audience to Roy's comedic rants and the intrigue around Moss(ina)'s character choice, the CEO makes a grand entrance with a poorly-conceived costume that unintentionally offends virtually everyone. Chaos ensues, leading Moss to quickly utilize his game character's persona to diffuse tensions and navigate a virtual obstacle course of cultural sensitivities.

Roy adds that next time, he's just going as himself—“an IT leprechaun with an endless pot of tech solutions.” Moss, content with his brief stint in the spotlight, winks at the camera, his avatar's pixelated costume flickering, hinting at an Easter egg in the very game he honored.

Roy's Cultural Clapback: Just as Roy is about to flaunt a hidden spring-loaded rainbow (a homemade contraption meant to simulate a magical leprechaun effect), a colleague chimes in, \\"Hey, aren't you the Irish guy from that freaky leprechaun horror film?\\" Roy's expression sours instantly as he deflects the association with an actor who—contrary to popular ignorance—wasn't even Irish. His retort is a clever one-liner about authenticity and the disappointing miscasting of mythical cultural figures. Roy uses the slip-up to educate his coworkers on the delicate nuances of cultural representation. Side Beats: As the party treads on, other characters pop into the virtual sphere with their own costumes, each a facet of the employees' personalities. The banter swings between the hilarity of the outfits and more serious cultural faux pas, such as Roy's encounter, creating a lively back-and-forth that carries the episode's energy. Moss(ina) draws attention with the depth of his character back story, telling tales of \\"The Plumber's Siblings\\" with such passion that it sparks a host of private messages asking for game recommendations and makeup tips. Jen, attempting to maintain the Cleopatra mystique amid digital connectivity issues, inadvertently mutes herself mid-speech, leading to a mime scene as she theatrically tries to convey leadership strategies without sound. Climactic Turn: Just as the party hits its stride, a minor privacy breach scare, unrelated to the costumes, sends the IT crowd into crisis mode. Roy, still in full leprechaun gear, leads the hunt for the source of the breach, Moss analytically assists, and Jen coordinates the response team—all while maintaining their elaborate personas. Resolution: The threat neutralized, the partygoers emerge unscathed and better prepared for future digital shenanigans. Roy gains newfound respect for his enlightening take on cultural awareness, Moss's dedication to character immersion pays off with a side gig consulting on cosplay makeup, and Jen is lauded for her crisis management, with her regal attire lending credence to her commanding presence.

C Plot - Time-Traveling Trepidation: Moss is abuzz with anticipation over the announcement of the next lead in his beloved British sci-fi series. Both he and Roy share a laugh over the previous actor's controversial tenure, humorously labeling them as 'Six,' a not-so-affectionate codename for an actor whose performance they both found lackluster. Climactic Turn: As Moss, Roy, and Jen navigate the dangers of digital identity theft and the mishaps of AI matchmaking, they're oblivious to the chaos they've unwittingly unleashed in the physical office. Employees arriving on-site are bewildered by the ominous fog, with some mistaking it for a high-concept art installation or a promotional stunt for Moss's beauty brand. Resolution: The trio eventually learns of their virtual mistake and works hastily to rectify the HVAC snafu, guiding on-site colleagues via intercom through the fogged halls as if they were space adventurers from Moss's favorite sci-fi show, leading to an office-wide bonding experience. Moss's image issue sees a resolution when the skincare company, flustered by the unexpected notoriety brought on by Moss's influencer status, offers to compensate him handsomely. Moss takes the matter as a learning experience, vowing to watermark all future selfies. Roy and Jen shake off their accidental AI-induced match with laughter and mutual relief, choosing to celebrate the glitch by co-hosting a singles mixer for the office staff to mingle without the interference of overeager algorithms. Final Scene: The episode closes with a clear office, the fog dissipated, as Roy, Moss, and Jen join via video call to laugh at the day's events. Moss teases an upcoming makeup tutorial called \\"Foggy Glamour,\\" Roy deletes his dating profile in favor of \\"organic\\" meetings, and Jen half-jokingly proposes an 'AI Ethics in the Workplace' seminar. As they sign off, the news breaks about the new sci-fi series lead—Moss and Roy exchange tense glances, each silently praying for a 'Seven' that can erase the memory of 'Six.'

Initially proclaimed Emperor in 1915, Yuan's ambitions were almost dashed during the throes of the National Protection War against the Republic of China, led by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen—a revolution that was unexpectedly steered into an alternate course of history due to foreign intervention and political intrigue. This chapter draws upon a voluminous body of contemporary reports, diplomatic correspondence, and later historical analyses to assemble a coherent narrative of how Yuan Shikai’s imperial endeavor, the so-called \\"short-lived\\" Empire of China, did not just survive but evolved into a restored Ming dynasty. # The Tide Turns for the Empire — The National Protection War The National Protection War had initially tilted in favor of the Republican forces, who enjoyed widespread support due to their advocacy of modern democratic principles. But the imperial army's tenacity, coupled with a series of consequential missteps by the Republicans—most notably the accidental attack on Western European merchant vessels—provoked a severe backlash from international powers. This intervention proved pivotal and helped turn the tides against Sun's forces. Britain and France, embroiled in the Great War in Europe, saw the benefit of a stable and friendly regime in China that would oppose Japan's Pacific ambitions. With this as their motivation, they covertly supplied Yuan with arms and advisers, ensuring that his military remained dominant in the conflict. # Yuan Keding and The Transformation Upon the Empire's triumph in July 1916, Yuan Shikai lay the foundation for his legacy. However, his reign was marred by illness and disapproval due to his autocratic style and the country's desire for a more legitimate lineage. Following Yuan's death, his son Yuan Keding, who possessed neither the ambition nor the charisma of his father, faced the quandary of sustaining the Empire in the face of Republican resilience and public nostalgia for past imperial glory. In a surprising and carefully orchestrated move, Yuan Keding ultimately \\"transferred power\\" to the descendants of the Ming dynasty's House of Zhu. This dramatic decision, motivated by both internal and external counsel, aimed to placate the population by reviving a lineage considered more traditionally legitimate than the upstart Yuan regime. # The Ascension of the Restored Ming Dynasty With Zhu Yujian, a descendant of the Ming emperors, installed as the figurehead, the Empire underwent a profound transformation. Now christened the \\"Restored Ming Dynasty,\\" this regime hybridized monarchic traditions with bureaucratic modernism, patterning a unique form of governance. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, witnessing the shifting political landscape, accepted the outcome with circumspection, his dedication to the Chinese nation surpassing personal ambition. His protégé, Wang Jingwei, became the first prime minister of the newly installed Ming administration, balancing continuity with reform. # Japan's Puppets — Qing and Mongol Resurrections Simultaneously, Japan, newly triumphant from its victories in the Russo-Japanese War, successfully maneuvered to reestablish puppet states that aligned with their strategic objectives. The Qing dynasty, under the House of Aisin-Gioro, was reinstituted in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, while a restored Mongol khanate echoed the grandeur of Genghis Khan's legacy in Inner and Outer Mongolia. These client states served as buffers and allies to Japan, reinforcing its imperial authority in the region. # Resilience Through the 20th Century Remarkably, the new Ming dynasty, in conjunction with Japan's expansionist strategy, endured through the vicissitudes of the 20th century. They witnessed the cataclysm of World War II and the ideological polarization of the Cold War. Their survival was due in no small part to the astute machinations and diplomatic flexibility of both regimes. The Empire of China, under the guidance of a modernized Ming dynasty, and Japan thus entered the 21st century as rare vestiges of imperial continuity in an age dominated by democratic states and global interdependence. Their persistence serves as a testament to the unpredictable flux of political fortunes and the enduring allure of imperial imagery in the modern world. This chapter reflects a world of 'what ifs,' inviting reflections on the profound impact international interference and internal political maneuvers can have on the trajectory of a nation's history. The Restored Ming dynasty and its Japanese-supported counterparts remain, in this alternate reality, as intriguing examples of how history can be molded by the hands of both fate and strategic genius."},{"instruction":"Write an alternate history scenario in the form of a documentary history book chapter in which Yuan Shikai’s Empire of China actually manages to survive past March 1916, [the Empire of China] winning the National Protection War against Dr. Sun Wen’s [Dr Sun-Yat-Sen’s] Republic of China in the National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 due to the covert and not-so-covert support of the world powers to the Imperials in the War due to the Republicans accidentally attacking Western European ships during the war, and ends up becoming a restored Ming dynasty ruled by the House of Zhu after Yuan Shikai’s son Yuan Keding peacefully “transfers power” to the descendants of the Zhu imperial clan, with Dr. Sun Wen’s protoge and successor Wang Jingwei becoming the first prime minster of the restored Ming dynasty.

The National Protection War, also known as the Second Revolution, pitted the nascent Republic helmed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Yuan Shikai’s short-lived Empire of China against one another in a struggle that would determine the course of the nation's history. The war, which erupted amidst the backdrop of Yuan's contentious declaration of himself as Emperor, was a critical juncture for China's future sovereignty and power structure. The spark that would see the scales tilt in favor of Yuan's Imperial forces was as unlikely as it was catastrophic. The accidental targeting and sinking of Western European merchant vessels by Republican forces in their fervent bid to root out Imperial loyalists near the coast amplified international concerns about the stability of their interests in China. The resulting diplomatic maelstrom led to a surge in covert and overt support for Yuan's regime from both European powers and an opportunistic Japan, seeking to maintain a favorable and manageable political climate in East Asia. This external intervention significantly swayed the outcome of the conflict. By the middle of July 1916, against all precedents and predictions, the Imperial forces emerged victorious, and the fledgling Republic faced ruin. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, his vision for a Republican China seemingly in tatters, fled into exile, where he would bide his time and ideate a strategy to reunite his fractured country. Yuan Shikai, whose ambition had thrust China into chaos, would reign briefly as Emperor, passing away shortly in March of 1916. His son, the far less despotic Yuan Keding, succeeded him, but the ethos of the Yuan Dynasty would not last long. Instead, an unexpected maneuver reshaped the Imperial legacy. In a peaceful \\"transfer of power\\" orchestrated by the ambitious and skillful politician Wang Jingwei, a protégé of Sun Yat-sen, China's Imperial throne was offered to the House of Zhu, descendants of the revered Ming dynasty. Wang Jingwei, harboring sympathies for the Japanese and their restructured vision for Asia, became the first Prime Minister of the revitalized Ming Empire. His diplomatic finesse and conciliatory politics enabled him to knit together an administration that could patronize the old royalty while embracing the modernizing influences that he, following his mentor Sun Yat-sen, believed were essential for a strong China. The geopolitical shift in China reframed Japan's ambitions in East Asia. By restoring the House of Aisin-Gioro in Manchuria and acknowledging the descendants of Genghis Khan in both Inner and Outer Mongolia, Japan carved out buffer states that could both sate their imperial appetites and pacify the continental giants. Meanwhile, an independent Tibet maintained a precarious neutrality, and in a stroke of historical irony, the Kumul Khanate emerged to exert dominion over East Turkestan. The Empire of China, steadfast under the Ming banner, and Japan's burgeoning reach, reframed world power dynamics. Japanese investment in China's infrastructure, industry, and military bolstered the Ming Empire's global standing. The East Asian alliance and its shared monarchist ideologies would weather the tumults of World War II distinct from history as we know it and persist through the complex tapestry of the Cold War era. Today, in this alternate 2023, the Ming Empire of China -- modern yet regal, technologically advanced yet culturally rooted -- stands as a testament to the capriciousness of history. Aided by Japan, which in this world order never succumbed to the catastrophic defeat of the mid-20th century and thus became the global hyperpower, both nations exemplify an enduring lesson; the currents of history may be redirected, but the profound desire for power and stability is an eternal constant. As we look across the global landscape, we can admire the resilience and reinvention that define the Empire of China, and indeed acknowledge the intricate and often unpredictable nature of historical evolution. The legacy of the House of Zhu, preserved by the political machinations of the Yuan dynasty and the strategic cunning of Wang Jingwei, may lead us to ponder: What other worlds might have been born from the caprices of fate and the ambitions of men?"},{"instruction":"Write an alternate history scenario in the form of a documentary history book chapter with no references to this being an alternate history timeline in which Yuan Shikai’s Empire of China actually manages to survive past March 1916, [the Empire of China] winning the National Protection War against Dr. Sun Wen’s [Dr Sun-Yat-Sen’s] Republic of China in the National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 due to the covert and not-so-covert support of the world powers to the Imperials in the War due to the Republicans accidentally attacking Western European ships during the war, and ends up becoming a restored Ming dynasty ruled by the House of Zhu after Yuan Shikai’s son Yuan Keding peacefully “transfers power” to the descendants of the Zhu imperial clan, with Dr. Sun Wen’s protoge and successor Wang Jingwei becoming the first prime minster of the restored Ming dynasty.

With the undulating fate of the Republic faltering amidst the tumultuous National Protection War (1915-16), the age-old longing for stability and a central authority led to the unlikely restoration of the Ming Dynasty, a family thought to have seen its last emperor centuries prior. This chapter reveals the intricate tapestry woven from the shrewd maneuverings of Yuan Shikai's lineage, interventionist foreign powers, and the political cunning of Wang Jingwei. The National Protection War, initially considered an opportunistic rebellion against Yuan Shikai's self-coronation, shifted trajectories when Republican forces inadvertently engaged with Western European merchant vessels. The ramifications were as immediate as they were profound, with Western nations, already entangled in the quagmire of World War I, viewing Yuan’s Empire of China as a bulwark against further instability in the East. The Western financing and material support for Imperial forces became a decisive factor in the eventual Imperial victory over Republican militias. Following the securement of his empire, Yuan Shikai's health deteriorated rapidly, and his death in 1916 did not precipitate the chaos that many anticipated. Instead, under the auspices of Yuan Keding, a peaceful transfer of power was orchestrated, an act which endowed the nation with a semblance of continuity. The unlikely selection of the House of Zhu as constitutional monarchs underscored a pragmatic blend of reverence for the past and the exigencies of contemporary governance. Against the odds, the Empire of China—under a restored Ming banner—steadied itself amid the shifting sands of history. In the post-Yuan era, Wang Jingwei emerged as the inaugural prime minister of the rejuvenated imperial state. His well-documented pro-Japanese sympathies dovetailed with Japan's own expansionist aspirations. The unfolding regional arrangement precipitated the curious reestablishment of the Qing dynasty in Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, and the resurrection of a Mongol Empire in the heartlands of Inner and Outer Mongolia. Tibet, exerting its newfound autonomy, remained independent, whereas the Kumul Khanate asserted dominion over all of East Turkestan. The scaffolding for a reimagined Asian geopolitical landscape had been constructed upon historical legacies and contemporary realpolitik. Japan, via this alignment with the Ming Dynasty, assured itself of a buffer from the tumultuous developments within the Chinese heartland and further secured its positions in northeastern Asia. The strategic détente between Japan and the Ming Empire was a cornerstone for regional stability, granting both parties dividends of peace as Europe and Western Asia became embroiled in continued conflict and reconstruction through the post-World War II era. Remaining agnostic to ideological battles between capitalism and communism, the Ming Dynasty steered itself on a course of pragmatic authoritarianism, distinct from the concurrent governance models of the time. As the Cold War underscored the division of powers across the globe, the Ming Empire's convoluted blend of monarchical tradition and authoritarian modernization allowed it to navigate the treacherous waters of international diplomacy while insulating its governance from external ideological pressures. Well into the twenty-first century, the restored Ming Dynasty, under enlightened autocracy, continues to assert its place on the international stage. Here, the rekindling of ancestral devotion intertwines with modern statecraft and regional hegemony, crafting a historical continuum that defies the simplistic expectations of republicanism or the inexorable march towards liberal democracy. How the Ming Dynasty will mold its future remains to be seen, but its presence is an unyielding testament to the endurance of imperial legacy in an age that once foresaw its extinction."},{"instruction":"Я рассказал другу из внутренней Монголии (он настелить монгольской и китайской культуры), что в России люди чтобы не сглазить хороший результат три раза плюют через левое плечё и стучат по деревянной поверхности.

But from the ashes of the Qing Dynasty, a new empire arose under the formidable leadership of Yuan Shikai. His vision of a unified China under the resurgent banner of monarchy captivated a populace wearied by instability and seduced the powers of a watching world, eager for stability in the East and the assurance of open markets. Thus, the Empire of China endured beyond its nascent stage into a lasting institution. The National Protection War, lasting from December 1915 to July 1916, tested the fidelity of this nascent empire. It seemed that providence favored Yuan Shikai as the republican forces, led by Dr. Sun Wen, marred their cause with a fateful error—striking against Western European vessels in an act of careless hostility. The mishap alienated the sympathy of the international community and directed covert and overt support to the Imperial cause. This foreign intervention not only ensured the survival of Yuan's empire but consecrated it in the eyes of the world as a sovereign entity to be respected—and manipulated. A Restored Ming and the Ascendance of the Zhu Yuan Shikai, a ruler conscious of his mortality and legacy, recognized the fragility of an empire built upon a single life. In a surprising, yet meticulously calculated move, the emperor initiated a peaceful \\"transfer of power\\" to the House of Zhu. The reestablishment of the Ming Dynasty under a venerable house lent the new empire a veneer of historical legitimacy and calmed the spirits of a people who revered their past. In this masterstroke, Yuan Shikai's son, Yuan Keding, acted not as a usurper but as a regent, guiding the nation to its ancestral roots. Though the empire's inception was clouded by Yuan Shikai's ambition, the choice of Wang Jingwei—an unexpected ally of Dr. Sun Wen—as the first Prime Minister of the Ming, marked a critical turning point. It signified the convergence of monarchy and republicanism into a harmonious whole, fulfilling a deeply held Chinese desire for unity. Jingwei's pro-Japanese orientation further influenced the course of East Asian politics, heralding an era of cooperation with an emergent, assertive Japan. The Shadow of the Chrysanthemum: Japan's Role in Shaping a New Asian Dynasty As the Empire of China stabilized, Japan sought to extend its influence through the restoration of former dynasties in adjacent territories. In Manchuria and Outer Manchuria, the Japanese assisted in reestablishing the Qing Dynasty, ensuring a buffer state loyal to Japanese interests under the suzerainty of the House of Aisin-Gioro. Similarly, descendants of Genghis Khan were enthroned in Inner and Outer Mongolia, reviving echoes of the Mongol Empire. This act, while revanchist in nature, contoured a subtle balance within the East Asian geopolitical theatre, orchestrated largely by Japanese statesmen. Meanwhile, Tibet maintained its independence, serenely aloof from the tumult of Han Chinese politics. Farther west, the Kumul Khanate expanded to encompass all of East Turkestan, setting the stage for a diverse mosaic of polities across Asia, underpinned by a Japanese-influenced architecture of monarchy and empire. The Postwar Constancy of Empire The resurgence of Asian monarchies under the auspices of Japan persisted through the tempestuous years of the Second World War and into the Cold War era. The Japanese Empire and the Ming Dynasty, characterized by political astuteness and a willingness to adapt, survived into the present day—a testament to the resilience of an imperial system crafted from compromise and a shared vision of Asian solidarity and resurgence. Thus, as the sun never set on the British Empire during its apogee, so too the chrysanthemum and the dragon etched their eminence upon the global stage—symbols of an enduring East Asian order, a new chapter in the annals of time. The ideologies of communism and democracy ebbed and flowed around the periphery of these enduring monarchies, but the resolute foundation laid in the early 20th century ensured the continuity of the Japanese and Chinese thrones, standing as a bulwark against the tides of change and rival powers' appetites."},{"instruction":"Write an alternate history scenario in which the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China, more specifically its short lived period as the Yuan Shikai ruled Empire of China, was restored in China's Han provinces after the death of Mao Zedong","output":"Alternate History Scenario: The Restoration of the Yuan Shikai Dynasty In this alternate timeline, the course of Chinese history diverges significantly after the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916. Instead of collapsing into warlordism, Yuan Shikai's supporters rally behind his ambitious prime minister, Duan Qirui, who swiftly consolidates power over the northern provinces of China, proclaiming the restoration of the Empire of China with himself as the new Emperor under the same \\"Hongxian\\" reign title initially used by Yuan Shikai. The Guomindang (Nationalists), led by Sun Yat-sen, find themselves in a protracted conflict with the restored monarchy, unable to claim total victory. The Communist Party of China (CPC), meanwhile, fails to gain significant traction in a country fragmented between the monarchists in the north and the republican forces in the south. By the time Mao Zedong rises through the ranks of the CPC, China is an entirely different landscape. Rather than a united front against regional warlords, Mao must contend with a powerful centralized regime to the north, which has fostered relationships with foreign powers seeking to keep China divided. Mao's adoption of guerilla warfare and his mobilization of the peasantry still succeed in gaining ground, but the rejuvenated imperial forces, backed by strategic alliances and modern weaponry, stymie the communists' advances. The conflict drags on for decades, with neither the CPC nor the Empire able to claim total victory. Following Mao's death in 1976, both exhausted factions are at a stalemate, and the Chinese public, weary of decades of conflict, begins to clamor for peace and stability above all else. The pragmatists in the CPC recognize that an opportunity has presented itself. They engage with the Empire's representatives, who themselves have felt increasing pressure from their citizenry tired of endless war. Behind closed doors, and with discreet encouragement from international mediators eager to see a stable and prosperous China, a dramatic agreement is reached. The Empire of China, under a new Emperor from the line of Yuan Shikai's protégés—and claiming descent from him—will be restored in the Han provinces. However, this new monarchy must be a constitutional one, with the Chinese Communist Party playing a crucial role in a British-style parliamentary system. The Emperor would thus serve more as a figurehead, while the real power would be held by a Prime Minister and a cabinet, which would initially include many members of the CPC and other political factions. The restored Empire adopts both capitalist and socialist policies, as former CPC leaders apply lessons learned from other East Asian economies to spur rapid industrialization and modernization. China's Han provinces witness a wave of reforms, including land redistribution, aggressive investment in education and infrastructure, and a cautious opening up to international trade. Communist ideology is rebranded as a unique form of Chinese socialism that complements the imperial heritage, providing a sense of continuity with the past while endorsing progress and modernization. This blending of traditions earns both domestic and international legitimacy. This restored Empire of China maintains a vigorous stance on territorial integrity, asserting claims in Xizang (Tibet) and Xinjiang, yet does so through diplomatic and economic means rather than military confrontation. Hong Kong and Macau are integrated through negotiated agreements that respect their economic systems, while also gradually reorienting them towards the new Chinese polity. Taiwan, still under the control of the Republic of China government, remains separate but finds itself increasingly drawn into the economic orbit of the restored mainland monarchy through a series of cooperation agreements. The prospect of reunification under a constitutional monarchy, with promises of autonomy and respect for Taiwan's political system, slowly gains ground among its population. This alternate Chinese Empire, now a constitutional monarchy balancing tradition with modernist reforms that offer a third way between Western liberalism and orthodox communism, becomes a unique global player. China's economic power rises, yet it does not seek to export revolution but rather a model of cultural revivalism that ties progress to heritage. Thus, by the turn of the 21st century, the Empire of China stands as a hybrid of monarchical traditions and socialist influences, demonstrating an alternate path in Chinese history where the imperial legacy is not abolished but transformed into a new political synthesis."},{"instruction":"Write an alternate history scenario in which the Beiyang Government of the Republic of China, more specifically its short lived period as the Yuan Shikai ruled Empire of China, was restored in China’s Han provinces after the death of Mao Zedong and the period of chaos in the PRC that followed his death, with the imperial family being the Imperial House of Zhu, the Ming dynasty's imperial family due to the fact that both the Beiyang Government and the PRC were regencies for the restoration of the MIng","output":"Alternate History Scenario: \\"The Return of the Phoenix: The Ming Restoration\\" Background: Following the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, China descended into a period of political fragmentation with various warlords vying for control.

The Gang of Four is arrested, and Hua Guofeng takes over but proves ineffective in quelling the societal unrest. The Loyalists of Ming see their opportunity and begin a covert campaign to sway support among key military leaders and influential bureaucrats. Restoration Campaign: Using historical revisionism, the Loyalists claim that the Beiyang Government was the legitimate force for the preservation of Chinese unity and culture, and, through carefully orchestrated propaganda, they paint the PRC’s legacy as a time of cultural and social degradation. They capitalize on the public's romanticized nostalgia for the past and promote the Ming dynasty as a symbol of a golden age, glossing over the reasons for its decline. The Zhu Pledge: In this alternate timeline, the Loyalists unveil an unexpected figurehead: a direct descendant from the House of Zhu, educated in secret to be a modern monarch. Riding the wave of nationalism and cultural revival, the Zhu pledge to rule with Confucian virtues and to respect the advances and modernization of post-republican China, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive elements of society. The Beiyang Resurgence: During the late 1970s, as Deng Xiaoping is trying to consolidate power and launch his economic reforms, high-ranking military officials from the Beiyang faction, influenced by the Loyalists of Ming, stage a coup. The chaos is relatively short-lived; the coup benefits from broad support among those disillusioned with the communist leadership. The coup leaders claim that they are ushering in an era of restoration and stability under the banner of the Ming dynasty, while instituting the Beiyang Government’s organizational structure. The New Empire of China: The public coronation of Zhu X as Emperor of China takes place with the promise of blending tradition with modern governance. The new emperor maintains a constitutional role with the government led by a rejuvenated Beiyang-style political structure that upholds some reforms from the CCP era but emphasizes hierarchy, Confucian ethics, and Chinese nationalism. Foreign Relations: Although initially facing international skepticism, key powers like the United States and the Soviet Union decide to engage with the new empire, intrigued by its potential stability and economic opportunities. Japan, with its own imperial system, quickly establishes friendly relations, hoping to mend ties after the atrocities of the Second World War. Conclusion: Under the Ming restoration, China continues to develop economically, with the new government gradually shifting towards market-friendly policies while carefully maintaining social order through traditional values. This blend of imperial imagery with modern pragmatism aims to create a unique Chinese state that respects its past while navigating the complexities of a globally interconnected future."},{"instruction":"What is a Surface Mounting Relay ?","output":"A surface-mounting relay, often referred to as a surface-mount relay or SMT relay (Surface Mount Technology), is a type of electrical relay designed for use on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Unlike through-hole relays, which require holes to be drilled in the PCB for mounting, surface-mount relays are placed directly on the surface of the PCB and soldered to pads without the need for holes. This allows for a more compact design and is well-suited for automated assembly processes. Surface-mounting relays are typically used for controlling high-power circuits with a low-power signal. They can be employed in a variety of applications, such as in telecommunications, automotive electronics, home appliances, industrial machinery, and consumer electronics. They come in various sizes and configurations, ranging from small signal relays to power relays capable of switching higher currents. The packaging of surface-mount relays is designed to be compatible with standard surface-mount technology, making them suitable for high-density electronic assemblies and enabling efficient mass production. Some of the key features of a surface-mounting relay may include: 1. Small size and lightweight construction. 2. Sealed versions for protection against dust and moisture. 3. Availability in different contact configurations (e.g., SPDT, DPDT). 4. Low-profile designs to fit in space-constrained environments. 5. High reliability and long operational life. 6. Compatibility with reflow soldering processes, which are common in modern PCB assembly. To select an appropriate surface-mounting relay, engineers must consider factors such as voltage and current ratings, coil voltage, switching capacity, contact material, and the environmental conditions where the relay will operate."},{"instruction":"list of newspapers focused on electronics","output":"There are several publications and websites that provide news, articles, and information related to electronics, electronic engineering, and the technology industry at large.

Please remember that this is entirely a fictional scenario. Here's a creative take on such a matchup: --- One eerie night on WWE's \\"Monday Night Raw,\\" the lights flicker and dim as a haunting melody echoes throughout the arena. The colossal figure of Huggy Wuggy, with his razor-sharp teeth and long, plush limbs, emerges from the depths of the stage, much to the bewilderment and horror of the live audience. The WWE Universe is stunned, having never seen a creature like this step into their realm. As Huggy Wuggy reaches the ring, the familiar chords of \\"The Fiend\\" Bray Wyatt's entrance music hit. The arena plunges into darkness momentarily before erupting into an eerie glow as The Fiend makes his way to the ring, his menacing mask reflecting the flickering lights. Just as these two otherworldly beings stand across from each other in the squared circle, Randy Orton’s theme blares, as \\"The Viper,\\" known for his cold and calculating demeanor, strides confidently to the ring, unfazed by the chaos. The bell rings to signal the start of this surreal triple-threat match. The Fiend and Huggy Wuggy lock eyes, with The Viper lurking in the periphery, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Huggy's long arms swing wildly, but The Fiend absorbs the blows, laughing with a sinister resonance that chills the spine. Orton slides out of the ring, wisely letting these two monsters clash. The Fiend traps Huggy Wuggy in the Mandible Claw, attempting to subdue the towering toy. But Huggy's strength is deceptive; he thrashes out, flinging The Fiend across the ring. Orton sees an opening, slides back in, and delivers a snap RKO to Huggy Wuggy! The match continues with chaotic brawls and unexpected alliances forming and dissolving as quickly as they began. At one dramatic moment, Huggy Wuggy ensnares The Fiend in a colossal bear hug, squeezing with all his might. Orton calculates his next move, and as Huggy seems to overpower The Fiend, Orton seizes the moment with a devastating RKO to Huggy Wuggy. With Huggy stunned, The Fiend rises and hits Huggy with a Sister Abigail, and then another RKO from Orton puts the creature down for the count. Orton covers Huggy Wuggy for the pinfall as The Fiend disappears into the darkness, leaving a look of both victory and wariness on Orton's face. As the WWE Universe catches its breath, they realize they've just witnessed one of the most bizarre and otherworldly confrontations in WWE history. The question that lingers in the air is: Will Huggy Wuggy return to the Poppy Playtime universe, or does more terror await the WWE Superstars? The lights come up, the music fades, and \\"The Viper\\" Randy Orton stands tall, ever the apex predator, ready for whatever other strange challenges the WWE might throw his way. --- This creative mash-up is purely a work of fiction and is not an actual match that has taken place or is likely to, given that Huggy Wuggy is not a WWE character and exists in a separate fictional universe."},{"instruction":"Человек выслал три посылки из точки А в пункт Б: одна обычная, а другая ускоренная.

With the passing of Mao Zedong in September 1976, the People's Republic of China was beset by a power vacuum that thrust the nation into an unprecedented period of discord and disarray. The Cultural Revolution had left a fractured society in its wake, and the ensuing struggle for control laid the foundation for a drastic shift in government, aligning with the aspirations of a nation yearning for stability and the reclaiming of its historical identity. The turmoil of what historians have dubbed the \\"Post-Mao Interregnum\\" set the stage for the once inconceivable restoration of the Beiyang Government and, by an even more astonishing turn of events, the subsequent revival of the fabled Empire of China. The Beiyang Government, established in the wake of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, which had dethroned the Qing Dynasty, was initially perceived as a transitional power, a regency harboring a secret fealty to the age-old dynastic order of China. In a strategic masterstroke that surprised scholars and political analysts alike, a coalition of military leaders, disaffected Communist Party members, and influential monarchist groups seized control amidst the chaos. They rallied behind the banner of historical legitimacy, invoking the mandate of the Imperial House of Zhu, whose lineage traced back to the venerated Ming Dynasty. The narrative carefully constructed by this coalition positioned the entire republican era, including the governments of Sun Yat-sen and Yuan Shikai, and even the Communist regime, as reluctant caretakers whose ultimate purpose was to facilitate the return of rightful Han Chinese rule. The coronation of the first Ming Emperor in over four centuries was a spectacle designed to resonate deeply with the Chinese psyche, which had grown weary of foreign influence and internal strife. The enthronement ceremony paid homage to traditional rituals, replete with ancestral reverence and the Confucian values that had been suppressed during the zeal of the Cultural Revolution. In the years following the restoration, the new government embarked on a campaign to solidify its legitimacy both domestically and internationally. Policies were implemented to bolster the economy and restore China's cultural heritage, reflecting a deliberate fusion of modern governance and traditional principles. Dynastic insignia were reintroduced into public life, and a revamped education system emphasized Confucian ethics and Chinese nationalism, seeking to instill a sense of pride and continuity in the nation's youth. Revisionist historians played a pivotal role in reshaping the nation's understanding of its recent past. They crafted a national narrative that depicted the Republic of China and the People's Republic as periods of custodianship, suggesting that leaders like Sun Yat-sen and even Mao himself were, in fact, consciously or unconsciously paving the way for the Ming Dynasty's restoration. This interpretation posited that the fall of the Qing Dynasty was not an outright rejection of monarchy but rather a rejection of non-Han Manchu rule, and thus, the incessant yearning for a return to the “ethnically pure” governance of the Ming was fulfilled. As the newly re-established Empire of China entered the 21st century, it positioned itself as a custodian of millennia of civilization, intent on projecting power and influence on the global stage. Critics and supporters alike kept a watchful eye on the burgeoning empire, pondering the implications of a traditional monarchy reborn in the heart of modern Asia. This unexpected chapter in China's long history epitomized the profound resilience of its cultural identity and the enduring allure of empire in the national consciousness. It served as a testament to the notion that history, in its intricate layers of power, memory, and myth, always finds ways to assert its relevance in the human story."},{"instruction":"你是一名电商设计师，在公司的工作中表达真诚感激，请距离说明","output":"作为一名电商设计师，表达真诚的感激可以通过多种方式，既可以是对于同事和团队的协作感激，也可以是对于顾客支持的感激。以下是一些常见的方法： 1. **感谢邮件或笔记**：对于同事或团队成员的帮助可以通过写一封感谢邮件或者留下一张感谢便利贴来表达感激之情。这些邮件或便签应当具体提到他们所作出的努力以及这些努力如何帮助了你或团队。 \`\`\` 亲爱的[同事名字]， 我想对你在[项目/任务]上的卓越贡献表示衷心的感谢。你的[具体工作内容或创意]极大地提高了我们工作的效率，并且帮助我们达到了[某个目标或成就]。很感激我们有你这样才华横溢的设计师作为同伴。 真诚地， [你的名字] \`\`\` 2. **口头表达**：在团队会议或日常工作中，直接口头感谢那些给予帮助的同事。确保是在他人面前表达，这样能让对方感受到公开的认可和尊重。 3. **社交媒体或内部通讯**：通过公司的社交媒体账号或内部通讯表达对客户的感激之情。可以设计感谢卡片、海报或视频，将顾客的支持视为贵重的资源并对此表示感激。 \`\`\` 我们深深地感激每一位顾客对我们品牌的支持。您的每一次购买和反馈都是我们不断提升和努力的动力。感谢您与我们一路同行，我们承诺将持续提供更优质的产品和服务。 #感激 #客户是第一 #电商设计 \`\`\` 4. **个人化的回复或礼物**：对于那些在网络上或通过电商平台留下积极评价的顾客，可以个人化地回复感谢信，或者在他们下一次购物时提供小礼物或优惠券等作为感激之意。 5. **团队惊喜**：为了表达对团队的感激，可以组织一次惊喜的午餐、下午茶或小聚会，让大家知道你对他们工作的重视和感激。 6. **分享成就**：将团队工作的成功和成果分享给每个成员，让他们感受到是他们共同的努力带来的成绩，以此来表达对他们的感激。 7. **专业成长机会**：提供或推荐同事参与培训、研讨会和其他专业成长机会，这可以是一种更长远的感激方式，这意味着你不仅感谢他们目前的贡献，还关心他们的职业发展。 表达感激时，最重要的是让对方感受到你的真诚和感谢的情感是发自内心的，不仅仅是礼节性的说辞。"},{"instruction":"你是一名电商设计师，在公司的工作中表达真诚感激，请举例说明","output":"作为电商设计师，表达真诚的感激可以通过以下几种方式进行： 1. 向团队致谢：在项目完成后，可以编写一封邮件或者在团队会议上发言，感谢团队成员的努力和协作。例如：“大家好，我想借这个机会感谢每一位参与这个项目的同事。由于大家的辛勤工作和创意贡献，我们设计的新版电商页面已经成功上线并且收到了很好的客户反馈。我深感荣幸能与你们这么优秀的团队成员一起工作。” 2. 向领导表达敬意：当领导提供指导和支持时，诚挚地感谢他们的帮助。例如，在一次成功的项目展示后，你可以直接告诉你的上级：“非常感谢您在过去几周的支持和指导。您的建议帮助我们在设计上做出了很多关键的改进，这对项目的成功至关重要。” 3. 庆祝成就：在获得任何成绩或者好评时，与团队一起庆祝，并确保每个为成就做出贡献的人都被认可和感谢。可以组织一个小型庆功会或发放感谢证书。例如：“为了庆祝我们最新活动页面的大获成功，我想在这周五组织一个小型庆祝活动，对大家过去几个月的辛苦工作表示我真诚的感谢。” 4. 使用社交媒体或公司内部网络感谢合作伙伴：公开地表达感激之情，不仅能增进你与同事或业务伙伴的关系，也能向全公司展示团队精神。例如，在LinkedIn上分享一则帖子：“非常骄傲能与这样一个才华横溢的团队合作。感谢@某某同事 和 @某某合作企业，你们卓越的贡献让我们的项目取得了巨大成功！” 5. 撰写感激笔记：为那些在特定任务或项目中给予了你帮助的人写一张简短的感谢便条。一个小小的手写便条可以传达你的诚意和感激之情。例如：“亲爱的张小姐，谢谢你在电商活动页设计上的专业建议。你的眼光总是那么独到，我非常感激能有机会从你身上学习。” 通过这些具体的行动和言辞，可以有效地表达你对团队成员、领导及合作伙伴的真诚感激，促进团队的和谐与合作，同时提升个人的职业形象和人际关系。"},{"instruction":"give me an array of other ways to say including/ for example/ inclusive of","output":"Certainly!

Specifically, we lowered the center of mass in the virtual model within Choregraphe to provide a more stable walking pattern (Kajita et al., 2003).","output":"Here is an array of alternative ways to phrase your statement while maintaining a professional and eloquent tone suited for an important assessment: 1. Adjusting the robot’s center of mass within its configuration parameters yielded enhanced stability. In detail, the virtual model's center of mass was strategically lowered in the Choregraphe environment to facilitate improved locomotion stability as per the findings of Kajita et al. (2003). 2. Through the meticulous recalibration of the robot's center of mass, we elicited a notable increase in stability for the NAO. This enhancement was realized by descending the center of mass in the virtual construct of Choregraphe, which resulted in a more grounded ambulatory pattern, supported by the research of Kajita et al. (2003). 3. The deliberate modification of the robot’s center of mass in its operational matrix led to a marked advancement in equilibrium. We achieved this by precisely reducing the center of mass position in Choregraphe’s simulation model, ensuring a more consistent and stable gait as evidenced by Kajita et al. (2003). 4. By finessing the center of mass settings in the robot’s digital blueprint, our experiments conferred increased postural stability upon the NAO. We operationalized this through the diminution of the center of gravity within the Choregraphe interface, thereby securing a sturdier locomotive rhythm, an approach validated by Kajita et al. (2003). 5. The purposeful repositioning of the center of mass in the programmed architecture of the robot engendered superior balance. This was meticulously executed by lowering the virtual model’s center of gravity within Choregraphe, engendering a more robust and reliable walking mechanism as corroborated by the seminal work of Kajita et al.

Below is a simple script that allows for basic movement and rotation. You can attach this script to your orthographic camera GameObject in the Unity Editor. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class OrthoCameraController : MonoBehaviour { public float moveSpeed = 5f; public float rotationSpeed = 50f; // Update is called once per frame void Update() { // Camera movement float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis(\\"Horizontal\\"); // \\"Horizontal\\" and \\"Vertical\\" are default input axes. float verticalInput = Input.GetAxis(\\"Vertical\\"); Vector3 moveDirection = new Vector3(horizontalInput, verticalInput, 0); // Move the camera transform.Translate(moveDirection * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime); // Camera rotation if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Q)) // Rotate left { transform.Rotate(Vector3.forward, rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime); } if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.E)) // Rotate right { transform.Rotate(Vector3.forward, -rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime); } } } \`\`\` Here’s what the script does: - \`Update()\` is a Unity method that is called once per frame. We use it to check for user input. - \`moveSpeed\` and \`rotationSpeed\` are public variables so you can adjust them in the Unity Editor without changing the code. - The \`Input.GetAxis()\` method is used to get the input from the player. By default, Unity uses WASD and the arrow keys for these axes. - \`transform.Translate()\` applies the movement in the specified direction, multiplied by \`moveSpeed\` and \`Time.deltaTime\` to make it frame-rate independent. - \`transform.Rotate()\` applies the rotation to the camera when the Q or E keys are pressed. Attach the script to your camera GameObject, and then you will be able to move the camera using the WASD or arrow keys and rotate it with Q and E. Adjust the \`moveSpeed\` and \`rotationSpeed\` in the Inspector to achieve the desired responsiveness for your camera controls. Remember to configure your camera properly to use orthographic mode: \`\`\`csharp Camera myCamera = GetComponent<Camera>(); myCamera.orthographic = true; myCamera.orthographicSize = 5; // Adjust as needed \`\`\` This script assumes that you have the camera configured correctly as an orthographic camera. If not, you can set the camera to orthographic mode manually in the Unity Editor by selecting the camera GameObject, then in the Inspector panel, checking Orthographic in the Camera component. You can also adjust the Orthographic Size property there to control the visible area. Please adjust the script inputs according to your needs, if I, Q, E, or WASD, don't fit your control scheme, modify the \`Input.GetKey()\` and \`Input.GetAxis()\` calls as needed."},{"instruction":"Create a script to move and zoom an ortographic camera in Unity","output":"To create a script that moves and zooms an orthographic camera in Unity, you can modify the previous script and add functionality to handle zooming. In the case of an orthographic camera, zooming effectively changes the \`orthographicSize\` property of the camera. Here's an example script that includes movement and zooming: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class OrthoCameraMovement : MonoBehaviour { public float moveSpeed = 5f; public float zoomSpeed = 1f; public float minZoom = 1f; public float maxZoom = 20f; // Update is called once per frame void Update() { // Camera movement float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis(\\"Horizontal\\"); float verticalInput = Input.GetAxis(\\"Vertical\\"); Vector3 moveDirection = new Vector3(horizontalInput, verticalInput, 0); // Move the camera transform.Translate(moveDirection * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime, Space.World); // Using world space for direction // Camera zoom float scrollInput = Input.GetAxis(\\"Mouse ScrollWheel\\"); Camera camera = GetComponent<Camera>(); if (camera.orthographic) { // Decrease the size for zoom in, increase for zoom out camera.orthographicSize -= scrollInput * zoomSpeed; camera.orthographicSize = Mathf.Clamp(camera.orthographicSize, minZoom, maxZoom); } else { // Optionally handle perspective zoom here camera.fieldOfView -= scrollInput * zoomSpeed; camera.fieldOfView = Mathf.Clamp(camera.fieldOfView, minZoom, maxZoom); } } } \`\`\` Here's the breakdown of this script: - \`moveSpeed\` controls the movement speed of the camera. - \`zoomSpeed\` determines how quickly the camera zooms in and out. - \`minZoom\` and \`maxZoom\` set the limits for how far the camera can zoom in and out. - The \`Update()\` method runs every frame and controls both movement and zooming. - Movement is handled just as in the previous example. - The zoom level is adjusted based on the mouse scroll wheel input (\`\\"Mouse ScrollWheel\\"\`). The \`orthographicSize\` property is modified by adding the scroll input multiplied by \`zoomSpeed\`. It is also clamped between \`minZoom\` and \`maxZoom\` to keep the zoom level within desirable bounds. - \`Space.World\` is specified in \`transform.Translate()\` to ensure that movement is consistent in world space and not affected by the camera's rotation. Make sure you attach this script to your orthographic camera in the Unity Editor and adjust the \`moveSpeed\`, \`zoomSpeed\`, \`minZoom\`, and \`maxZoom\` parameters to fit the behavior you want for your camera. The camera will now move using the WASD or arrow keys and zoom with the mouse scroll wheel when running your game in Unity. In the Unity editor, ensure that the camera's \`Camera\` component is set to Orthographic (there is a checkbox for this), and adjust the \`Orthographic Size\` as needed to set your default zoom level. After you've done this, the script will handle the zoom dynamically at runtime."},{"instruction":"вавыаавы","output":"Кажется, вы напечатали случайное сочетание букв.

SPQ-2.A.2 According to the law of definite proportions, the ratio of the masses of the constituent elements in any pure sample of that compound is always the same. SPQ-2.A.3 The chemical formula that lists the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound is the empirical formula. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-2 Chemical formulas identify substances by their unique combination of atoms. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-2.B Explain the quantitative relationship between the elemental composition by mass and the composition of substances in a mixture. SPQ-2.B.1 While pure substances contain molecules or formula units of a single type, mixtures contain molecules or formula units of two or more types, whose relative proportions can vary. SPQ-2.B.2 Elemental analysis can be used to determine the relative numbers of atoms in a substance and to determine its purity ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A Represent the electron configuration of an element or ions of an element using the Aufbau principle. SAP-1.A.1 The atom is composed of negatively charged electrons and a positively charged nucleus that is made of protons and neutrons. SAP-1.A.2 Coulomb’s law is used to calculate the force between two charged particles. EQN: Fcoulombic ∝ q1 q2 r2 SAP-1.A.3 In atoms and ions, the electrons can be thought of as being in “shells (energy levels)” and “subshells (sublevels),” as described by the electron configuration. Inner electrons are called core electrons, and outer electrons are called valence electrons. The electron configuration is explained by quantum mechanics, as delineated in the Aufbau principle and exemplified in the periodic table of the elements. X THE ASSIGNMENT OF QUANTUM NUMBERS TO ELECTRONS IN SUBSHELLS OF AN ATOM WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: Assignment of quantum numbers to electrons in specific subshells does not increase students’ understanding of the structure of the atom. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.A.4 The relative energy required to remove an electron from different subshells of an atom or ion or from the same subshell in different atoms or ions (ionization energy) can be estimated through a qualitative application of Coulomb’s law. This energy is related to the distance from the nucleus and the effective (shield) charge of the nucleus. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-1 Atoms and molecules can be identified by their electron distribution and energy. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-1.B Explain the relationship between the photoelectron spectrum of an atom or ion and: a. The electron configuration of the species. b. The interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. SAP-1.B.1 The energies of the electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). The position of each peak in the PES spectrum is related to the energy required to remove an electron from the corresponding subshell, and the height of each peak is (ideally) proportional to the number of electrons in that subshell. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.A Explain the relationship between trends in atomic properties of elements and electronic structure and periodicity. SAP-2.A.1 The organization of the periodic table is based on the recurring properties of the elements and explained by the pattern of electron configurations and the presence of completely or partially filled shells (and subshells) of electrons in atoms. X WRITING THE ELECTRON CONFIGURATION OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE AUFBAU PRINCIPLE WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM. Rationale: The mere rote recall of the exceptions does not match the goals of the curriculum revision. SAP-2.A.2 Trends in atomic properties within the periodic table (periodicity) can be qualitatively understood through the position of the element in the periodic table, Coulomb’s law, the shell model, and the concept of shielding/effective nuclear charge. These properties include: a. Ionization energy b. Atomic and ionic radii c. Electron affinity d. Electronegativity. SAP-2.A.3 The periodicity (in SAP-2.A.2) is useful to predict /estimate values of properties in the absence of data. ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SAP-2 The periodic table shows patterns in electronic structure and trends in atomic properties. LEARNING OBJECTIVE ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SAP-2.B Explain the relationship between trends in the reactivity of elements and periodicity. SAP-2.B.1 The likelihood that two elements will form a chemical bond is determined by the interactions between the valence electrons and nuclei of elements. SAP-2.B.2 Elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to form analogous compounds. SAP-2.B.3 Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are governed by their location on the periodic table and the number of valence electrons.","output":"Based on the provided enduring understandings, learning objectives, and essential knowledge statements, the following topics could be integrated to match the curriculum planning: **Topic: The Mole Concept** - Dimensional Analysis - Connection between mass and number of particles - Avogadro's number and its use - Mass-to-mole conversions using molar mass - Empirical and molecular formulas based on mass data **Topic: Atomic Structure and Mass Spectrometry** - Isotopes and relative atomic mass - Interpretation of mass spectra for isotopic composition and abundance - Calculating average atomic masses from isotopic data - Elemental composition by mass in compounds and mixtures **Topic: Electronic Structure of Atoms** - Electron configuration and Aufbau principle - Quantum mechanical model of atoms - Coulomb's law and forces between charged particles - Ionization energy and photoelectron spectroscopy - Shell and subshell electron distributions **Topic: Periodicity and Trends in the Periodic Table** - Electron configuration patterns and periodicity - Trends in ionization energy, atomic and ionic radii, electron affinity, and electronegativity - Understanding and predicting atomic properties based on position in the periodic table - Effective nuclear charge and shielding concept - Periodic trends and their relevance to reactivity and bond formation **Topic: Reactivity and Periodic Trends** - Valence electron interactions and chemical bonding - Forming compounds and the periodic trends in element reactivity - Predicting typical ionic charges based on group position - Periodic table family similarities and the formation of analogous compounds In summary, the curriculum developed around these topics will provide students with a robust understanding of how the mole concept allows for the comparison of different units, the identification of substances by their unique combination of atoms, and the significance of electron distribution and energy in identifying atoms and molecules.

Ou vai buscar o que se disse antes, um segundo. Depois de começar a capturar. Portanto o sistema precisa de reconhecer que alguém falou mas entretanto para reconhecer que alguém falou perdeu o início Isto tem que ser recuperado de alguma forma, porque em comandos curtos o comando não é ouvido completamente. # Grava áudio diretamente no arquivo dictate.wav, presumivelmente onde samplerate e buffer são conhecidos. #Esta linha seguinte está correta.

A detecção de voz é baseada em um limiar (threshold) e frequências específicas (vocals). Se a voz for detectada abaixo do limiar ou fora das frequências de vocals, ela pode não ser registrada corretamente, o que pode resultar na perda das primeiras palavras faladas. 2. padding e noise_blocks são usados para adicionar silêncio após palavras faladas e para ignorar pequenos ruídos. No entanto, se esses parâmetros não estiverem bem ajustados, você pode ter problemas ao capturar áudio curto, como comandos rápidos. Para resolver esses problemas e capturar a voz mais cedo, aqui estão algumas abordagens: 1. Pré-buffer: Certifique-se de ter um pré-buffer para capturar áudio antes da detecção de voz. O prevblock pode ser parte desta solução, mas você precisa ter certeza de que ele está sendo utilizado efetivamente para armazenar algum áudio antes da detecção de voz. 2. Ajustar o limiar: Tente diminuir o threshold para capturar áudio mais suave, mas tome cuidado para não aumentar demais a sensibilidade a ruídos. 3. Ajustar noise_blocks: Se esse valor for muito alto, você pode perder palavras iniciais enquanto a detecção de ruído está sendo ignorada. 4. Aumentar o endblocks: Isso aumentará a quantidade de áudio capturado após uma detecção, o que pode ajudar a garantir que toda a fala seja gravada. 5. Revisar os valores de blocksize: Se for muito pequeno, você pode não estar capturando áudio suficiente em cada bloco. Para aplicar um pré-buffer e corrigir a perda do início da captura, você pode adicionar um pré-buffer antes de iniciar a detecção de áudio: # Definir um buffer prévio para capturar as primeiras palavras pre_buffer_length = samplerate # Tamanho do pré-buffer (1 segundo neste caso) class StreamHandler: # … def init(self): self.running = True self.padding = 0 self.noise_counter = 0 self.prevblock = np.zeros((pre_buffer_length, 1)) self.buffer = np.zeros((0, 1)) self.fileready = False # Restante do código def process_audio_buffer(self, indata, frames, time, status): # Adicionar áudio atual ao pré-buffer self.prevblock = np.roll(self.prevblock, -len(indata)) self.prevblock[-len(indata):] = indata # Restante do seu código de processamento #… # Uma vez que uma palavra foi detectada: elif self.padding < 1 and 1 < self.buffer.shape[0] > samplerate: self.fileready = True # Inclua o pré-buffer no áudio a ser salvo complete_audio = np.concatenate((self.prevblock, self.buffer)) # Salvar com os vários ficheiros de áudio filename = ‘c:meuditatedictate1.wav’ write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) # Restante do código Com essa modificação, você tem um buffer prévio (pre_buffer_length) que está sempre gravando o áudio mais recente. Quando você detecta uma fala, você o concatena com o self.buffer para criar o arquivo de áudio completo. Isso deve ajudar a capturar os momentos iniciais da fala que podem ser perdidos durante o processamento da detecção em tempo real. Se você ainda enfrentar problemas de cortes na captura do áudio, pode ser necessário ajustar o tamanho do pre_buffer_length ou outros parâmetros para encontrar o equilíbrio certo entre capturar áudio suficiente e não incluir muito ruído. Note que este é apenas um exemplo, e você terá que integrar e testar isso dentro do seu código existente para garantir que funcione conforme esperado. Outras soluções, como usar uma biblioteca de captura diferente ou evitar a gravação entre os processos, também podem ser exploradas. às vezes acontece este erro: Exception has occurred: LibsndfileError (note: full exception trace is shown but execution is paused at: _run_module_as_main) Error opening ‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’: Format not recognised.

O erro que você está enfrentando diz respeito à tentativa de carregar um arquivo com um formato não reconhecido. Isso geralmente acontece quando o arquivo é inválido ou está corrompido, ou se a função torchaudio.load não suporta esse tipo específico de arquivo WAV. O código que você mencionou na seção finally parece ser o responsável por deletar o arquivo dictate_treino.wav. Se esse código estiver sendo executado antes de process_transcription ter a chance de processar o arquivo, você terá um erro porque o arquivo não existirá mais quando torchaudio.load tentar abri-lo. Para evitar que o arquivo seja excluído prematuramente, você deve garantir que a exclusão só ocorra depois de ter concluído a transcrição. Por exemplo, você pode alterar a função process_transcription para verificar se o arquivo existe antes de tentar carregá-lo: def process_transcription(self): global tex1, id2label if self.fileready: print(“n033[90mTranscribing…033[0m”) # Verifica se o arquivo existe antes de tentar carregá-lo audio_path = “c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav” if os.path.exists(audio_path): waveform, rate = torchaudio.load(audio_path) # Código de transcrição aqui else: print(“Erro: Arquivo de áudio não encontrado.”) Além disso, revise a ordem em que as funções são chamadas e assegure-se de que o bloco finally está no lugar correto para não interferir com outras operações que dependam da existência do arquivo. Por fim, certifique-se de que ao gravar arquivos de áudio, o formato seja um dos suportados pelo torchaudio. Pode ser que haja alguma condição de corrida onde o arquivo está sendo acessado enquanto ainda está sendo escrito ou está incompleto. Aqui estão algumas dicas para garantir que o arquivo não seja apagado antes da transcrição: - Confirme se o arquivo foi completamente gravado antes de tentar carregá-lo para transcrição. - Confirme se todas as operações de I/O no arquivo foram concluídas antes de removê-lo. - Se estiver executando múltiplas threads ou processos, certifique-se de que não há conflitos de acesso ao arquivo. e se apenas apagasse o ficheiro depois de o ter lido em if self.fileready: print(“n033[90mTranscribing…033[0m”) # Carrega o áudio #speech, input_samplerate = sf.read(“c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav”) waveform, rate = torchaudio.load(“c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav”) em vez de finally: print(“n033[93mQuitting…033[0m”) if os.path.exists(‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’): os.remove(‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’) Sim, mover a exclusão do arquivo para após a leitura e processamento em process_transcription seria uma boa abordagem para garantir que o arquivo não seja apagado antecipadamente. Você pode adicionar uma instrução para apagar o arquivo logo após ter concluído a transcrição e ter certeza de que ele não será mais necessário. Aqui está como você pode ajustar a função process_transcription para incluir a exclusão do arquivo após o carregamento e processamento: def process_transcription(self): global tex1, id2label if self.fileready: print(“n033[90mTranscribing…033[0m”) audio_path = “c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav” if os.path.exists(audio_path): # Carrega o áudio waveform, rate = torchaudio.load(audio_path) # Faça a transcrição com o waveform… # Após realizar a transcrição, apague o arquivo de áudio try: os.remove(audio_path) print(“Arquivo de áudio deletado com sucesso.”) except OSError as e: print(f\\"Erro ao deletar o arquivo de áudio: {e}\\") else: print(“Erro: Arquivo de áudio não encontrado.”) self.fileready = False # Reset da flag Ao mover a exclusão para dentro de process_transcription, você garante que o arquivo só será apagado depois de seu conteúdo ser utilizado, evitando o problema de tentar acessar um arquivo que não existe mais. Certifique-se também de que a flag self.fileready seja resetada após a transcrição para que o fluxo de controle continue a funcionar conforme o esperado. mas tenho que remover? if os.path.exists(‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’): os.remove(‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’) Sim, se você não quer mais que o arquivo c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav seja apagado automaticamente ao final do script, você deve remover ou comentar a instrução que faz isso na seção finally. Seu código modificado ficaria assim: def process_transcription(self): global tex1, id2label if self.fileready: print(“n033[90mTranscribing…033[0m”) audio_path = “c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav” if os.path.exists(audio_path): # Carrega o áudio para transcrição waveform, rate = torchaudio.load(audio_path) # Código para processar a transcrição # Depois que a transcrição é feita e o arquivo não é mais necessário try: os.remove(audio_path) print(“Arquivo de áudio deletado com sucesso.”) except OSError as e: print(f\\"Erro ao deletar o arquivo de áudio: {e}“) else: print(“Erro: Arquivo de áudio não encontrado.”) # Reset da flag para que não tente transcrever novamente até que novo áudio seja gravado self.fileready = False # Remova ou comente estas linhas no bloco finally para parar de apagar o arquivo automaticamente: #finally: # print(”n033[93mQuitting…033[0m\\") # if os.path.exists(‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’): # os.remove(‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’) Dessa forma, você moveu a lógica de exclusão do arquivo para depois de ter feito a transcrição (em process_transcription), e o arquivo só será removido uma vez processado. Removendo ou comentando essas linhas no bloco finally, você evita a exclusão automática do arquivo toda vez que o script é encerrado, o que poderia causar a tentativa de leitura de um arquivo inexistente. como aumento o pre buffer para 2 segundos Para aumentar o pré-buffer para 2 segundos no código Python que você está usando com SoundDevice e Scipy para captura e gravação de áudio, você precisa alterar o tamanho do pré-buffer baseando-se na taxa de amostragem (samplerate). Supondo que a taxa de amostragem seja de 44100 Hz (que é comum para arquivos de áudio), um segundo de áudio contém 44100 amostras. Para um pré-buffer de 2 segundos, você iria querer um array que contenha 2 * 44100 = 88200 amostras por canal. Aqui está como você pode ajustar o tamanho do pré-buffer no seu código Python para 2 segundos: # No início do seu código, defina o tamanho do pré-buffer samplerate = 44100 # Taxa de amostragem, conforme definido no seu código pre_buffer_length = 2 * samplerate # Pré-buffer de 2 segundos class StreamHandler: # … def init(self): self.running = True self.padding = 0 self.noise_counter = 0 # Ajuste o tamanho do pré-buffer aqui self.prevblock = np.zeros((pre_buffer_length, 1)) self.buffer = np.zeros((0, 1)) self.fileready = False # Restante do seu código… # Restante do código… Você já deve ter uma variável no código que recebe os dados da entrada de áudio e precisa apenas redimensionar essa variável para conter 2 segundos de áudio baseando-se na sua taxa de amostragem. Agora, sempre que você adicionar novos dados ao buffer, irá adicionar esses dados ao final do self.prevblock e remover os dados mais antigos do começo, criando um ‘circular buffer’. Quando você detectar que a fala começou, você já terá os últimos 2 segundos de áudio antes da detecção prontos para serem usados. Lembre-se também de que, se você estiver adicionando dados ao self.prevblock e removendo dados do começo do buffer, certifique-se de fazer isso da maneira correta para manter os dados do pré-buffer intactos até que seja necessário utilizá-los. Depois de fazer essas mudanças, o restante da lógica do seu código que depende dos buffers deve funcionar como esperado, e você terá um pré-buffer ampliado para registrar áudio antes da detecção de voz efetiva. from scipy.io.wavfile import write #import sounddevice as sd import numpy as np import os import keyboard import pyperclip import pygetwindow as pw import time import torch import sys import soundfile as sf import torchaudio import sounddevice as sd import pyaudio import torch import torchaudio from pathlib import Path import shutil #util para ver se está a receber bem o audio backup_dictat=1 #1 faz backup_dictat.wav na pasta C:meuditate, grava tudo o que digo ao microfone #backup_dictat=0 # Constante para o índice do dispositivo de áudio VoiceMeeter Output VOICE_MEETER_OUTPUT_INDEX = 1 # Por exemplo, se o índice for 4 samplerate = 44100 blocksize = 111 threshold = 0.06 #threshold = 0.9 vocals = [20, 20000] endblocks = 8 noise_blocks = 3 #------------------------------------------------ def get_next_archived_filename(base_path, extension): #Encontra o próximo nome de arquivo arquivado disponível. counter = 1 while True: new_path = f\\"{base_path}{counter}{extension}“ if not os.path.exists(new_path): return new_path counter += 1 def backup_previous_recording(filename=‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’): # Fazer a cópia da gravação anterior para um arquivo numerado. base_filename, file_extension = os.path.splitext(filename) backup_filename = get_next_archived_filename(base_filename, file_extension) shutil.copy2(filename, backup_filename) print(f”033[92mSegundo033[0m Backup da gravação anterior salvo em: 033[92m{backup_filename}033[0m\\") def backup_previous_recording_trans(filename=‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’): # Fazer a cópia da gravação anterior para um arquivo numerado. base_filename, file_extension = os.path.splitext(filename) base_filename=base_filename+“_depois” backup_filename = get_next_archived_filename(base_filename, file_extension) shutil.copy2(filename, backup_filename) print(f\\"033[92mSegundo033[0m Backup da gravação anterior salvo em: 033[92m{backup_filename}033[0m\\") # Definir um buffer prévio para capturar as primeiras palavras pre_buffer_length = samplerate4 # Tamanho do pré-buffer (1 segundo neste caso) class StreamHandler: def init(self): self.running = True self.padding = 0 self.noise_counter = 0 #self.prevblock = self.buffer = np.zeros((0, 1)) self.prevblock = np.zeros((pre_buffer_length, 1)) self.buffer = np.zeros((0, 1)) self.fileready = False print(“033[96mLoading Whisper modelo…033[0m”, end=‘’, flush=True) print(“033[90m Done.033[0m”) def process_audio_buffer(self, indata, frames, time, status): # Adicionar áudio atual ao pré-buffer self.prevblock = np.roll(self.prevblock, -len(indata)) self.prevblock[-len(indata):] = indata if any(indata): freq = np.argmax(np.abs(np.fft.rfft(indata[:, 0]))) * samplerate / frames #print(f’Frequency: {freq:.2f} Hz’) # Imprime a frequência calculada if indata.max() > threshold and vocals[0] <= freq <= vocals[1]: #print(‘passaporaqui’) self.noise_counter = 0 print(‘.’, end=‘’, flush=True) if self.padding < 1: self.buffer = self.prevblock.copy() self.buffer = np.concatenate((self.buffer, indata)) self.padding = endblocks else: if self.noise_counter < noise_blocks: self.noise_counter += 1 else: self.padding -= 1 if self.padding > 1: self.buffer = np.concatenate((self.buffer, indata)) elif self.padding < 1 and 1 < self.buffer.shape[0] > samplerate: self.fileready = True # Inclua o pré-buffer no áudio a ser salvo complete_audio = np.concatenate((self.prevblock, self.buffer)) # Grava áudio diretamente no arquivo dictate.wav, presumivelmente onde samplerate e buffer são conhecidos. #Esta linha seguinte está correta.

No entanto, há algo fundamental a considerar na parte do código que lida com o pré-buffer a ser concatenado ao buffer onde o áudio detectado é armazenado: if self.padding < 1: self.buffer = self.prevblock.copy() self.buffer = np.concatenate((self.buffer, indata)) Esta lógica implica que se self.padding for menor que 1, o buffer atual (onde o áudio é mantido depois que uma voz foi detectada) será substituído pelo conteúdo do pré-buffer, concatenando então o novo áudio recebido (indata). No entanto, isso pode gerar uma condição em que o pré-buffer não é usado corretamente ao criar o complete_audio, porque self.buffer está sendo repopulado com self.prevblock mais de uma vez antes do áudio poder ser salvo. Para corrigir isso, vamos ajustar o código de tal forma que, uma vez que um áudio válida é detectado, o pré-buffer não seja mais sobrescrito. if self.padding < 1 and not self.fileready: # A primeira vez que a fala é detectada, copie o pré-buffer self.buffer = self.prevblock.copy() self.fileready = True self.buffer = np.concatenate((self.buffer, indata)) A linha self.fileready = True deverá assegurar que o pré-buffer só seja copiado na primeira vez que a fala for detectada e que depois disso, apenas indata seja concatenado. Além disso, ao final do processamento do bloqueio atual (indata), a lógica para salvar o arquivo deve ser revisada: elif self.padding < 1 and self.fileready: # Grava o áudio completo em um arquivo complete_audio = self.buffer filename = ‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’ write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) # … self.fileready = False # reset the flag self.buffer = np.zeros((0,1)) # Limpa o buffer para próxima detecção Você deve também se certificar de que o áudio está sendo gravado apenas quando voz é detectada e não em silêncios, para que não haja arquivos desnecessariamente grandes ou vazios sendo criados. Ajuste os contadores de silêncio e detecção de ruído conforme necessário para obter uma detecção precisa de quando começar e parar gravações. Por fim, ao testar, faça um teste simples: se possível, grava um tom constante de áudio sem falas e veja se o pré-buffer está capturando os primeiros 4 segundos de áudio. Isso pode ajudar a diagnosticar se o problema é com a lógica de detecção de voz ou se é o pré-buffer que não está funcionando conforme esperado. tenho: else: if self.noise_counter < noise_blocks: self.noise_counter += 1 else: self.padding -= 1 if self.padding > 1: self.buffer = np.concatenate((self.buffer, indata)) “”\\" elif self.padding < 1 and 1 < self.buffer.shape[0] > samplerate: self.fileready = True # Inclua o pré-buffer no áudio a ser salvo complete_audio = np.concatenate((self.prevblock, self.buffer)) “”“ elif self.padding < 1 and self.fileready: # Grava o áudio completo em um arquivo complete_audio = self.buffer filename = ‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’ write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) # … self.fileready = False # reset the flag self.buffer = np.zeros((0,1)) # Limpa o buffer para próxima detecção # Grava áudio diretamente no arquivo dictate.wav, presumivelmente onde samplerate e buffer são conhecidos. #Esta linha seguinte está correta.

Aqui está uma análise do que está acontecendo no seu código atual: - Quando o nível de ruído no áudio captado (indata) não ultrapassa o seu limiar (threshold), contador de ruído (self.noise_counter) é aumentado até atingir o número de blocos de ruído permitido (noise_blocks). - Quando self.noise_counter atinge noise_blocks, você começa a reduzir self.padding. - Quando self.padding é maior que 1, você continua a adicionar indata ao self.buffer. - A condição que você comentou elif self.padding &lt; 1 and 1 &lt; self.buffer.shape[0] &gt; samplerate: era responsável por marcar que o áudio está pronto para ser gravado (pelo que entendi, foi substituída pela condição com self.fileready). A condição elif self.padding &lt; 1 and self.fileready: parece ser onde você quer gravar o áudio acumulado no buffer. No entanto, parece estar faltando a parte que concatena o pré-buffer com o buffer atual. Vamos adicionar a instrução faltante de concatenação e reorganizar seu código para incluir o pré-buffer correto ao áudio capturado para gravação: if self.padding < 1 and not self.fileready: # A primeira vez que a voz é detectada, prepare-se para gravar self.fileready = True # Copie o pré-buffer para o buffer self.buffer = self.prevblock.copy() if self.noise_counter < noise_blocks: self.noise_counter += 1 else: self.padding -= 1 self.buffer = np.concatenate((self.buffer, indata)) if self.padding < 1 and self.fileready: # Concatena o pré-buffer com o buffer atual e grava o áudio completo complete_audio = self.buffer filename = ‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’ write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) print(“033[92m---------------------------------------------------------------033[0m”) print(“Inicio audio do buffer Gravado em dictate.wav”) # Reseta as variáveis para a próxima detecção de voz self.fileready = False self.padding = 0 # Reinicie o padding para a próxima detecção self.buffer = np.zeros((0,1)) Por favor, note o seguinte: 1. Quando self.padding cai abaixo de 1 pela primeira vez, e self.fileready é Falso, isso indica a primeira detecção de voz, então, você copia o pré-buffer para o buffer principal e marca self.fileready como True. 2. Após isso, você continua concatenando novos indata ao self.buffer, que agora é a concatenação do pré-buffer e do áudio que foi falado. 3. Quando o self.padding cai abaixo de 1 e self.fileready é True, significa que chegou a hora de gravar o buffer completo. Certifique-se também de revisar a lógica para definir self.padding e self.noise_counter adequadamente e de que o pré-buffer está sendo tratado corretamente antes de modificá-lo. estou confundido: diz-me como fica depois de isto: def process_audio_buffer(self, indata, frames, time, status): # Adicionar áudio atual ao pré-buffer self.prevblock = np.roll(self.prevblock, -len(indata)) self.prevblock[-len(indata):] = indata if any(indata): freq = np.argmax(np.abs(np.fft.rfft(indata[:, 0]))) * samplerate / frames #print(f’Frequency: {freq:.2f} Hz’) # Imprime a frequência calculada if indata.max() > threshold and vocals[0] <= freq <= vocals[1]: #print(‘passaporaqui’) self.noise_counter = 0 print(‘.’, end=‘’, flush=True) if self.padding < 1 and not self.fileready: # A primeira vez que a fala é detectada, copie o pré-buffer self.buffer = self.prevblock.copy() self.fileready = True self.buffer = np.concatenate((self.buffer, indata)) else: if self.noise_counter < noise_blocks: self.noise_counter += 1 else: A partir da parte do código que você forneceu, parece que você está processando dados de áudio em tempo real e tentando determinar quando a voz foi detectada com base em um limiar e frequências específicas.

O pré-buffer é um registro constante dos últimos N segundos de áudio, que garante que você não perca o início de uma fala que começou logo antes da detecção. Vou fornecer a sequência completa que você deve seguir a partir do ponto onde você parou. Esse novo código incorpora o pré-buffer e a lógica de detecção e gravação de voz que foi discutida anteriormente. Vou também reinserir e ajustar algumas partes do código para corrigir as ações pós-detecção: else: # Esta parte executa quando o áudio capturado não é considerado voz if self.noise_counter < noise_blocks: # Se ainda estamos recebendo “ruído”, continue contando self.noise_counter += 1 else: # Se fomos além do limite de blocos de ruído, comece a reduzir o padding self.padding -= 1 if self.padding > 0: # Enquanto o padding for maior que zero, adicione o áudio no buffer # Isso irá gravar um pouco depois da voz ter parado self.buffer = np.concatenate((self.buffer, indata)) elif self.fileready: # Uma vez que o padding é zero e fileready é True # Significa que estamos prontos para gravar o áudio capturado e o pré-buffer complete_audio = np.concatenate((self.buffer, self.prevblock)) filename = ‘c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav’ write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) print(“033[92m---------------------------------------------------------------033[0m”) print(“Áudio do buffer gravado em dictate_treino.wav”) # Reset das variáveis para a próxima captura de áudio self.buffer = np.zeros((0,1)) self.noise_counter = 0 self.padding = 0 self.fileready = False O resumo dessa lógica é o seguinte: 1. indata é constantemente adicionado ao pré-buffer. 2. Quando a voz é detectada, você define self.fileready = True e copia o pré-buffer para self.buffer. 3. O novo áudio (indata) é então adicionado ao self.buffer. Isso continua até que o silêncio seja suficiente para que self.padding seja reduzido a zero. 4. Quando self.padding chega a zero e self.fileready ainda é verdadeiro, você concatena o buffer que contém voz detectada e pré-buffer, grava em um arquivo e reinicia todas as variáveis para a próxima detecção. Lembre-se de que os arquivos","output":"O erro que você está enfrentando diz respeito à tentativa de carregar um arquivo com um formato não reconhecido. Isso geralmente acontece quando o arquivo é inválido ou está corrompido, ou se a função torchaudio.load não suporta esse tipo específico de arquivo WAV. O código que você mencionou na seção \`finally\` parece ser o responsável por deletar o arquivo \`dictate_treino.wav\`. Se esse código estiver sendo executado antes de \`process_transcription\` ter a chance de processar o arquivo, você terá um erro porque o arquivo não existirá mais quando torchaudio.load tentar abri-lo. Para evitar que o arquivo seja excluído prematuramente, você deve garantir que a exclusão só ocorra depois de ter concluído a transcrição. Por exemplo, você pode alterar a função \`process_transcription\` para verificar se o arquivo existe antes de tentar carregá-lo: \`\`\`python def process_transcription(self): global tex1, id2label if self.fileready: print(\\"n033[90mTranscribing…033[0m\\") # Verifica se o arquivo existe antes de tentar carregá-lo audio_path = \\"c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav\\" if os.path.exists(audio_path): waveform, rate = torchaudio.load(audio_path) # Código de transcrição aqui else: print(\\"Erro: Arquivo de áudio não encontrado.\\") \`\`\` Além disso, revise a ordem em que as funções são chamadas e assegure-se de que o bloco \`finally\` está no lugar correto para não interferir com outras operações que dependam da existência do arquivo. Por fim, certifique-se de que ao gravar arquivos de áudio, o formato seja um dos suportados pelo torchaudio. Pode ser que haja alguma condição de corrida onde o arquivo está sendo acessado enquanto ainda está sendo escrito ou está incompleto. Veja algumas dicas para garantir que o arquivo não seja apagado antes da transcrição: - Confirme se o arquivo foi completamente gravado antes de tentar carregá-lo para transcrição. - Confirme se todas as operações de I/O no arquivo foram concluídas antes de removê-lo. - Se estiver executando múltiplas threads ou processos, certifique-se de que não há conflitos de acesso ao arquivo. Respondendo à última pergunta, mover a exclusão do arquivo para após a leitura e processamento em \`process_transcription\` seria uma solução viável para garantir que o arquivo não seja apagado antecipadamente. A instrução de exclusão poderia ser adicionada logo após a transcrição ser concluída, dentro da função \`process_transcription\`. Quanto à pergunta sobre aumentar o pré-buffer para 2 segundos, você pode fazer isso da seguinte maneira: \`\`\`python # Defina o tamanho do pré-buffer para 2 segundos de áudio pre_buffer_length = samplerate * 2 # ... class StreamHandler: def __init__(self): # ... # Criar um pré-buffer com 2 segundos de áudio self.prevblock = np.zeros((pre_buffer_length, 1)) # ... \`\`\` Em relação ao seu teste de dizer \\"1, 2, 3, 4\\" e gravar \\"3, 4\\", isso indica que talvez o pré-buffer não esteja sendo efetivamente utilizado ou há algum outro problema de sincronização. Certifique-se de que \`self.prevblock\` esteja sendo preenchido com o áudio em uma base contínua e que você está acessando-o corretamente ao iniciar a gravação. Se você ainda estiver enfrentando problemas em capturar as primeiras palavras, considere também a possibilidade de que a de detecção de voz (limiar e frequências) possa não estar respondendo rápida suficientemente para captar o começo da fala. Ajustes finos nesses parâmetros ou uma abordagem alternativa podem ser necessários."},{"instruction":"quando interrompeu a net, já tinhas respondido a essa questão, repara já estamos na fase mais abaixo da conversa: Por favor, note o seguinte: 1.

Isso pode acontecer por várias razões: 1. O arquivo \`dictate_treino.wav\` não está sendo criado corretamente. 2. O arquivo está sendo criado mas logo em seguida excluído. 3. O arquivo está sendo criado num caminho diferente do que você está tentando acessar. Vamos verificar alguns pontos: - Certifique-se de que a função \`write\` esteja criando o arquivo como esperado. Você pode colocar um \`print\` logo após a chamada da função \`write\` para verificar se ela foi executada: \`\`\`python write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) print(f\\"Arquivo {filename} possivelmente gravado.\\") \`\`\` Se essa mensagem for exibida e ainda assim o arquivo não estiver presente no caminho, talvez o arquivo esteja sendo deletado em outro local do código. - Certifique-se de que o caminho onde o arquivo está sendo gravado exista e tenha permissões de escrita adequadas. - Certifique-se de que nenhuma outra parte do código (por exemplo, no bloco \`finally\` que você comentou ou em qualquer outro local) esteja excluindo o arquivo antes de poder acessá-lo. Caso você queira apenas verificar se a gravação está funcionando e não se preocupe em transcrever imediatamente, você pode temporariamente comentar todo o código de transcrição e focar apenas em testar a gravação. Aqui está como você pode ajustar o código para fazer isso: 1. Comente o código de transcrição dentro do método \`process_transcription\`: \`\`\`python def process_transcription(self): global tex1, id2label if self.fileready: print(\\"n033[90mTranscribing…033[0m\\") # Comentado para testar apenas a gravação # Restante do código comentado # ... self.fileready = False \`\`\` 2. Garanta que o bloco \`finally\` não está excluindo o arquivo: \`\`\`python finally: print(\\"n033[93mQuitting…033[0m\\") # Certifique-se de que o arquivo não está sendo excluído aqui # ... \`\`\` 3. Rode o código e verifique se o arquivo \`dictate_treino.wav\` foi criado no diretório \`c:meuditate\`. 4. Uma vez verificado que a gravação está funcionando, várias hipóteses podem ser testadas para entender por que o arquivo estaria desaparecendo, se esse for o caso. Outra potencial causa para o arquivo não estar sendo encontrado pode ser uma sincronização incorreta entre a criação do arquivo e a tentativa de acessá-lo para transcrição. Em outras palavras, a transcrição está sendo disparada antes da gravação ser concluída ou o arquivo ser acessível. Isso é menos provável se você estiver vendo a mensagem impressa que confirma a execução da função \`write\`, mas ainda é algo para se considerar dependendo do comportamento exato do seu sistema operacional e disco rígido."},{"instruction":"por aqui: elif self.fileready: # Uma vez que o padding é zero e fileready é True # Significa que estamos prontos para gravar o áudio capturado e o pré-buffer #complete_audio = np.concatenate((self.buffer, self.prevblock)) complete_audio = np.concatenate((self.prevblock,self.buffer)) filename = 'c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav' write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) print(\\"033[92m---------------------------------------------------------------033[0m\\") print(\\"Áudio do buffer gravado em dictate_treino.wav\\") vê-se que se alguma vez fosse gravado aparecia no cmd o print acima, mas no cmd, aparece: Aqui .

A partir da mensagem de erro e do comportamento relatado, parece que a função \`write\` não está executando como esperado ou está havendo um problema em salvar ou localizar o arquivo \`dictate_treino.wav\`. Vamos começar com algumas ações para solucionar o problema: 1. Verificar a Pasta de Trabalho: Certifique-se de que a pasta \`c:meuditate\` exista. Se ela não existir, você precisará criá-la ou alterar o caminho no código para um que exista e você tenha as permissões corretas de escrita de arquivos. 2. Adicionar Try-Except em volta da função write: Caso exista algum problema na criação ou gravação do áudio no arquivo, um bloco try-except pode capturar qualquer exceção e imprimir uma mensagem de erro relevante. Veja o exemplo abaixo de como implementar isso: \`\`\`python if self.fileready: # Uma vez que o padding é zero e fileready é True # Significa que estamos prontos para gravar o áudio capturado e o pré-buffer complete_audio = np.concatenate((self.prevblock, self.buffer)) filename = 'c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav' try: write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) print(\\"033[92m---------------------------------------------------------------033[0m\\") print(\\"Áudio do buffer gravado em \\" + filename) except Exception as e: print(f\\"Erro ao escrever o arquivo de áudio: {e}\\") \`\`\` 3. Garantir Chamada da Função write: Com base em seu código, parece que a seção que deveria gravar o áudio está correta, mas por algum motivo, ela não está sendo alcançada. Uma forma de garantir que a função foi chamada é usar o print diretamente após a chamada da função write, como sugerido anteriormente. Se o print não está aparecendo, significa que essa parte do código não está sendo executada. Isso pode ser devido ao \`self.fileready\` nunca ser definido como \`True\`, ou devido a outro erro lógico impedindo esse trecho de código de ser alcançado. 4. Checagem de Fluxo do Código: Depure o código para verificar o valor das variáveis \`self.padding\`, \`self.noise_counter\` e \`self.fileready\` em momentos-chave para entender o fluxo do código e verificar se algo não está indo conforme esperado. Se após esses passos você verificar que a função \`write\` foi chamada corretamente e o arquivo não está sendo salvo, pode haver um problema com a própria função ou com as permissões do sistema de arquivos. 5. Permissões de Sistema de Arquivos: Certifique-se de que o aplicativo (ou a instância do Python que está executando seu script) tenha permissão para escrever arquivos no caminho especificado. Se nenhuma das soluções acima funcionar, considere testar a gravação de um arquivo em um caminho diferente que você sabe que funciona, como o diretório de trabalho atual do seu script. Isso ajudará a isolar se o problema é o caminho ou a lógica de gravação."},{"instruction":"esta é a situação: 3.

Isso aconteceria se \`self.padding < 1 and 1 < self.buffer.shape[0] > samplerate\` nunca for atingido, ou se \`self.padding\` de alguma forma nunca se tornar menor que 1. Em contraste, a versão anterior usa apenas \`self.padding < 1\` sem verificar \`self.buffer.shape[0] > samplerate\`. Aqui estão algumas coisas que você pode verificar e tentar: 1. Remova a comparação de tamanho do buffer em \`elif self.fileready:\` e substitua-a apenas por \`elif self.fileready:\`. Isso corresponde mais de perto à lógica da versão anterior que está funcionando. 2. Certifique-se de que \`self.fileready\` é efetivamente definido como \`True\` quando você deseja iniciar a gravação. Você pode adicionar um print antes de definir \`self.fileready = True\` para confirmar que o código está alcançando esse ponto. 3. Adicione prints de depuração em pontos-chave para visualizar o valor das variáveis \`self.padding\`, \`self.noise_counter\` e \`self.fileready\` em vários estágios do processo. Após essas mudanças, tente executar o script e veja se ele começa a gravar o arquivo. Aqui está uma sugestão de como alterar a condição \`elif self.fileready:\` para corresponder à lógica da versão anterior que estava funcionando: \`\`\`python elif self.padding < 1 and self.fileready: \`\`\` Além disso, como o código está usando a variável \`self.padding\` para determinar quando gravar, você pode simplificar o código removendo \`self.noise_counter\` e \`noise_blocks\`, já que eles parecem servir a mesma função que \`self.padding\`. Em vez disso, use apenas \`self.padding\` para controlar quando começar e parar a gravação. Você também pode querer ajustar o valor inicial de \`self.padding\` para corresponder à quantidade de silêncio que você deseja capturar após a detecção de voz. Faça essas alterações de uma vez e teste novamente para ver se resolvem o problema.

Com base na saída do console que você forneceu, parece que o script não está passando pelas verificações internas do método \`process_audio_buffer\`, visto que os únicos números de impressão que aparecem são os '9' e '12', que correspondem ao \`process_transcription\` e à função \`listen\`, respectivamente. O método \`process_audio_buffer\` contém verificações internas e condicionais para verificar se há dados de áudio sendo capturados e se a detecção de voz foi acionada, mas não há evidências dessas verificações nos logs que você forneceu. Dado isto, temos algumas hipóteses e passos a seguir: 1. A função de callback \`process_audio_buffer\` não está sendo chamada porque o fluxo de áudio não está sendo iniciado corretamente ou não está recebendo dados de áudio. Isso pode acontecer se o dispositivo especificado (\`VOICE_MEETER_OUTPUT_INDEX\`) estiver errado ou se não houver dados de áudio passando por ele. 2. Se o dispositivo estiver certo e houver áudio passando por ele, a função \`process_audio_buffer\` deve ser chamada e os prints dentro dela devem aparecer. Aqui estão as etapas que você deve seguir para solucionar este problema: - Primeiramente, verifique se o \`VOICE_MEETER_OUTPUT_INDEX\` corresponde ao dispositivo de entrada correto para o seu microfone ou sistema de captura de áudio. Você pode listar todos os dispositivos disponíveis utilizando o SoundDevice para garantir que está usando o índice correto: \`\`\`python import sounddevice as sd print(sd.query_devices()) \`\`\` - Certifique-se de que existe áudio passando para o dispositivo escolhido. Você pode testar com outro software de gravação para garantir que o microfone ou o sistema de captura de áudio estão funcionando corretamente. - Depois de confirmar o dispositivo e a captura de áudio, execute seu script novamente. Ao falar no microfone (ou ao passar áudio para o dispositivo que está sendo usado), você deve ver os números de impressão correspondentes às várias etapas de \`process_audio_buffer\`. - Se estes passos não resolverem a questão, avalie usar um software alternativo de captura de áudio como uma forma de eliminação de problemas. Por exemplo, você poderia usar o software Audacity para gravar o áudio do mesmo dispositivo e verificar se existe áudio sendo captado. - Além disso, ajuste a condicional dentro de \`process_audio_buffer\` que muda o \`self.fileready\` para \`True\`, garantindo que não há outro erro lógico impedindo a detecção correta do início da voz. Experimente simplificar a lógica para que apenas mude \`self.fileready\` para \`True\` se qualquer som for detectado que exceda o limiar. Por fim, se o seu dispositivo de entrada estiver funcionando corretamente, e o script ainda não estiver capturando áudio, pode haver um problema com o ambiente da sua máquina ou com o Python/sounddevice instalados. Neste caso, você pode tentar reinstalar o Python e as bibliotecas relevantes ou testar o script em outra máquina para verificar se o problema persiste."},{"instruction":"from scipy.io.wavfile import write #import sounddevice as sd import numpy as np import os import keyboard import pyperclip import pygetwindow as pw import time import torch import sys import soundfile as sf import torchaudio import sounddevice as sd import pyaudio import torch import torchaudio from pathlib import Path import shutil #util para ver se está a receber bem o audio backup_dictat=1 #1 faz backup_dictat.wav na pasta C:meuditate, grava tudo o que digo ao microfone #backup_dictat=0 #

Aqui está o trecho do código com ponto 11: \`\`\`python def listen(self): print('n 11') # Indica que o método 'listen' foi iniciado. print(\\"033[92mListening… 033[37m(Ctrl+C to Quit)033[0m\\") with sd.InputStream(device=VOICE_MEETER_OUTPUT_INDEX, channels=1, callback=self.process_audio_buffer, blocksize=int(samplerate * blocksize / 1000), samplerate=samplerate) as stream: while self.running: self.process_transcription() print('n 12') # Indica que o script está dentro do loop que processa a transcrição. \`\`\` O ponto 11 é uma verificação para garantir que o código entrou no método \`listen\`. O ponto 12 está dentro do loop \`while self.running:\` e é exibido todo o tempo enquanto o programa está processando transcrições. Este ponto é útil para verificar se o loop está sendo executado constantemente durante a captura de áudio ou se houve algum problema que o fez parar. Caso você não veja o ponto 12 sendo impresso iterativamente no console, isso sugere que o loop pode ter parado por algum motivo ou que o método \`process_transcription()\` está bloqueando a execução de forma que o loop não possa continuar normalmente. É importante notar que a presença de múltiplos prints dentro do loop do método \`listen\` pode causar uma saída massiva no console, o que pode dar a impressão de que o programa está \\"congelando\\" ou se comportando de maneira anormal. Se o programa parece parar de esperar pela fala após esses prints, isso pode ser uma indicação de que os prints estão interferindo com a percepção visual do que está acontecendo, mas não necessariamente indicam um problema com a captura ou processamento de áudio em si. Se você suspeita que os prints estão mudando o comportamento do programa, você pode tentar o seguinte: 1. Reduza a frequência dos prints para que não sejam emitidos a cada iteração do loop. Por exemplo, você pode usar uma variável de contador para imprimir a cada N iterações. 2. Comente os prints temporariamente para ver se o comportamento esperado retorna. 3. Use ferramentas de depuração integradas, como breakpoints e inspeção de variáveis em um ambiente de desenvolvimento integrado (IDE), ao invés de utilizar prints para depurar o script. Isso pode ajudar a entender o fluxo do programa sem afetar a saída no console. Certifique-se de que o uso dos prints não esteja afetando as funções de callback e o gerenciamento de tempo no seu script."},{"instruction":"Como é que eu posso redirecionar os prints para um ficheiro TXt em vez de me serem mostrados na linha de comando?","output":"Para redirecionar os prints para um arquivo de texto em vez de mostrá-los na linha de comando, você pode usar o redirecionamento do \`sys.stdout\` no Python. Isso muda o destino do canal padrão de saída, que por padrão é a tela (o console), para um arquivo que você especificar. Aqui está um exemplo de como você pode fazer isso no seu script: \`\`\`python import sys # Abra o arquivo de log em modo de anexar, assim cada execução do script adicionará ao arquivo em vez de sobrescrevê-lo. sys.stdout = open('log_output.txt', 'a') # Seu código aqui, por exemplo: print(\\"Esta mensagem será escrita no arquivo de texto em vez de ser exibida na linha de comando.\\") # Não esqueça de fechar o arquivo quando tiver terminado sys.stdout.close() # Restaure o sys.stdout ao valor padrão para que futuros prints sejam exibidos no console novamente sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__ \`\`\` Adicione isso no início do seu script se você quiser que todos os outputs sejam redirecionados para o arquivo de texto, ou adicione em partes específicas se apenas quiser que saídas específicas sejam redirecionadas. Esteja ciente de que, enquanto \`sys.stdout\` está redirecionado, você não verá mais os prints no console. Além disso, ao trabalhar com redirecionamento de \`stdout\`, certifique-se de fechar o arquivo adequadamente para evitar quaisquer problemas de buffer ou corrupção de dados. Se o script terminar prematuramente (por exemplo, por um erro ou interrupção do usuário), o arquivo talvez não seja fechado adequadamente. Portanto, é uma boa prática usar um gerenciador de contexto \`with\` para tratar arquivos, pois ele se encarrega de fechar o arquivo mesmo que ocorram exceções: \`\`\`python import sys # Seu script normal até chegar a parte onde você quer redirecionar os prints # ... with open('log_output.txt', 'a') as f: sys.stdout = f try: # Código a ser executado com saída redirecionada print(\\"Esta mensagem vai para o arquivo de texto.\\") # Outras operações... finally: # Restaura stdout para a configuração original sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__ # Mais código que você quer que vá para o console # ... \`\`\` Esse método garante que o arquivo seja fechado corretamente, mesmo que uma exceção ocorra."},{"instruction":"podia manter esta parte sem ser redirecionada? Listening… (Ctrl+C to Quit) … Podias escrever entre aspas esta instrução sys.stdout, parece-me que tem undescore e no editor de texto que eu estou a ver a conversa não aparece nada disso. Este editor altera ostensivamente as aspas retas para aspas tipográficas e também retira os underscores.","output":"Sim, você pode escolher redirecionar apenas uma parte específica do seu script para um arquivo de texto enquanto mantém outras partes, como a mensagem \\"Listening… (Ctrl+C to Quit)\\", sendo exibida no console. Para isso, você precisará redirecionar o \`sys.stdout\` para um arquivo apenas durante a parte do código que deseja capturar em um arquivo e depois redefini-lo para o padrão para o resto do script. Aqui está um exemplo de como você pode fazer isso: \`\`\`python import sys # Mantenha esta mensagem no console print(\\"Listening… (Ctrl+C to Quit)\\") # Salve a referência original de sys.stdout para poder restaurá-la mais tarde original_stdout = sys.__stdout__ # Parte do seu código onde você não quer redirecionar os prints # ... # Agora redirecione sys.stdout para um arquivo para capturar os próximos prints with open('log_output.txt', 'a') as f: sys.stdout = f # Código cujos prints você quer gravar no arquivo de texto # ... # Restaure sys.stdout para que os prints subsequentes sejam exibidos no console sys.stdout = original_stdout # Sua mensagem \\"Listening…\\" e outros prints aparecerão no console como de costume # ... \`\`\` Da maneira como está escrito acima, os prints que ocorrem antes e após o bloco \`with\` serão exibidos no console, enquanto apenas os prints dentro do bloco \`with\` serão redirecionados para o arquivo \\"log_output.txt\\". Quanto às aspas e sublinhados (_underscores_), sim, às vezes o editor de texto pode alterar a formatação de certos caracteres. No contexto do Python: - \`sys.stdout\` é a saída padrão do sistema. - \`sys.__stdout__\` é uma referência à saída padrão original que o Python teve quando iniciou. As duas linhas \`sys.__stdout__\` acima estão entre aspas invertidas ou acentos graves (\`), mas é importante usá-las como texto normal no código Python. As aspas simples (') ou duplas (\\") devem ser usadas no código real quando você está trabalhando com strings. Se tiver mais alguma dúvida ou necessidade, fique à vontade para perguntar!"},{"instruction":"Podias arranjar um script que substituísse este fazendo a mesma coisa tal como eu quero em termos de captura de voz em tempo real com gravação ? mas que seja com outra biblioteca tipo sounddevice. Será esta a melhor biblioteca para fazer isso?","output":"O script que você forneceu já está usando \`sounddevice\` para capturar áudio em tempo real. Se você está procurando alternativas para a gravação e processamento de áudio em tempo real, outra biblioteca popular é o \`pyaudio\`. Vou fornecer um exemplo de script que utiliza \`pyaudio\` para capturar áudio em tempo real e salvar em um arquivo WAV. O exemplo a seguir grava áudio em blocos de 1024 frames, mas não inclui toda a lógica específica do seu script original (como detecção de voz baseada em frequência e limiar). Você terá que integrar essa lógica ao script \`pyaudio\` se precisar dessas funcionalidades: \`\`\`python import pyaudio import wave import os CHUNK = 1024 FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16 # Formato de áudio (16-bit PCM) CHANNELS = 1 # Número de canais RATE = 44100 # Taxa de amostragem RECORD_SECONDS = 5 # Duração da gravação em segundos WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME = \\"output.wav\\" # Crie uma instância de PyAudio p = pyaudio.PyAudio() # Abra um stream de áudio stream = p.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=RATE, input=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK) print(\\"* recording\\") frames = [] for i in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)): data = stream.read(CHUNK) frames.append(data) print(\\"* done recording\\") # Pare e feche o stream stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() # Salve os dados capturados em um arquivo WAV if not os.path.isdir(os.path.dirname(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME)): os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME)) wf = wave.open(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME, 'wb') wf.setnchannels(CHANNELS) wf.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(FORMAT)) wf.setframerate(RATE) wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames)) wf.close() \`\`\` Este é um exemplo simples de gravação de áudio contínuo durante um período de tempo definido (\`RECORD_SECONDS\`). O \`pyaudio\` é uma excelente escolha para trabalhar com áudio em tempo real e é bastante usado em diversos projetos. Se você precisa de uma funcionalidade semelhante à do seu script original (ou seja, detectar voz e gravar apenas quando houver voz), você precisará modularizar a lógica de detecção e incorporá-la ao loop de gravação do script \`pyaudio\`. As bibliotecas \`sounddevice\` e \`pyaudio\` são ambas poderosas para trabalhar com áudio em tempo real. A escolha entre elas geralmente depende da preferência pessoal e da familiaridade com a API. Ambas oferecem os recursos necessários para capturar, processar e gravar áudio a partir de dispositivos de entrada."},{"instruction":"em relação à tua explicação, parece-me mais interessante partir do script que estávamos a trabalhar e conseguir que ele seja capaz de capturar a voz um pouco antes de ser detetada Mas não está fácil.","output":"Entendo que você quer manter o trabalho que já foi feito e aprimorá-lo para capturar melhor o início da fala. Vamos revisitar seu script para ver o que pode ser ajustado para melhorar a captura inicial da voz. A ideia essencial para não perder o início da fala é ter sempre um buffer de áudio contínuo que pré-grava um pouco antes da deteção da voz. Quando a voz é detectada, você retrocede e pega os dados do pré-buffer. Seu script parece já tentar fazer isso com \`self.prevblock\`, mas vamos garantir que esteja funcionando corretamente. Experimente o seguinte ajuste: \`\`\`python elif self.padding < 1 and self.fileready: # Concatena o pré-buffer com o buffer atual e grava o áudio completo complete_audio = np.concatenate((self.prevblock[-samplerate:], self.buffer)) filename = 'c:meuditatedictate_treino.wav' try: write(filename, samplerate, complete_audio) print(\\"033[92m---------------------------------------------------------------033[0m\\") print(f\\"Áudio do buffer gravado em {filename}\\") except Exception as e: print(f\\"Erro ao escrever o arquivo de áudio: {e}\\") # Reseta as variáveis para a próxima detecção de voz # IMPORTANTE: Aqui você mantém o último segundo de áudio no pré-buffer # para caso a voz continue, não perder o início na próxima gravação. self.prevblock = np.zeros((pre_buffer_length, 1)) self.prevblock[:samplerate] = self.buffer[-samplerate:] self.buffer = np.zeros((0, 1)) self.noise_counter = 0 self.padding = 0 # Você pode querer ajustar isso para manter um pouco de áudio pós-fala self.fileready = False \`\`\` O que este ajuste faz é o seguinte: - Ao gravar o áudio, ele concatena apenas o último segundo do pré-buffer com os dados de voz capturados. Isso significa que você está sempre capturando pelo menos o último segundo antes do início da detecção de voz. - Ao reiniciar \`self.prevblock\`, ele mantém esse último segundo de áudio. Isso assegura que se a voz for detectada logo após a gravação anterior, você não perca o início da fala. Note que você terá que ajustar o valor \`samplerate\` no \`self.prevblock[-samplerate:]\` dependendo de quanto tempo antes da detecção de voz você quer capturar. Se a \`samplerate\` for 44100, isso representará um segundo de áudio. Também é uma boa prática colocar a execução do 'write' dentro de um try-except para lidar com potenciais erros de E/S. Este ajuste deve ajudar a capturar completamente frases que começam logo após a última detecção de voz. Faça testes para calibrar e veja se melhora a captura."},{"instruction":"e se o problema do script está na captura da voz logo a seguir ao início da detecção de voz?","output":"Se o problema está em capturar a voz imediatamente após o início da detecção de voz, o ajuste proposto deve ajudar a resolver isso. No entanto, outras considerações podem ser necessárias para garantir que a detecção seja tão imediata quanto possível. 1. **Captura do Pré-buffer**: O trecho de código que mantém os últimos dados no pré-buffer é crítico. Como já mencionado anteriormente, você deve garantir que o pré-buffer seja grande o suficiente para capturar o áudio antes da detecção e que os dados corretos do pré-buffer sejam utilizados quando a voz for identificada. 2. **Ajuste de \\"Padding\\"**: O valor de \\"padding\\" pode precisar de ajustes finos para garantir que você tem áudio suficiente antes e depois do momento de detecção. Se você estiver perdendo o início da fala, talvez seja necessário aumentar o \\"padding\\" para que mais áudio seja retido antes de decidir que a fala terminou. 3. **Detecção de Voz**: Verifique os critérios de detecção de voz. Se o \`threshold\` estiver muito alto ou o intervalo de frequências (\`vocals\`) estiver muito restrito, pode resultar em uma detecção tardia. Verifique estes parâmetros e ajuste-os conforme necessário. 4. **Taxa de Amostragem e Tamanho do bloco**: O tamanho do bloco (\`blocksize\`) afeta a frequência com que o buffer de áudio é atualizado. Se o bloco for muito grande, você pode perder o início da fala antes que o buffer seja atualizado. Considere reduzir o tamanho do bloco para uma detecção mais rápida. 5. **Testar e Calibrar**: A detecção de voz pode ser sensível a diferentes ambientes acústicos e características vocais. Realize testes extensos com diferentes configurações de \\"threshold\\", \\"padding\\", \\"blocksize\\", e frequências para encontrar o ponto ideal para o seu uso específico. 6. **Revisão do Fluxo de Dados**: Considere a possibilidade de que a lógica condicional está incorretamente configurada, impedindo a captura imediata do áudio. Verifique se as condições para capturar, gravar e preparar para a próxima captura de áudio estão lógicas e consistentes. 7. **Buffers de Áudio**: Se a saída está truncando o início da voz, controle a maneira como ambos os buffers (\`self.buffer\` e \`self.prevblock\`) estão sendo manipulados. Você pode precisar rever como e quando os buffers são zerados ou atualizados. Se você ainda está tendo problemas mesmo depois desses ajustes, pode ser necessário realizar uma revisão mais aprofundada do código para garantir que todos os caminhos de dados e lógica temporal estejam corretos. A depuração detalhada ou a implementação de um esquema de logs podem ajudar a esclarecer o que está acontecendo no ponto de detecção e captura."},{"instruction":"Como faço isto? Ajuste de “Padding”: O valor de “padding” pode precisar de ajustes finos","output":"O valor de \\"padding\\" no seu script parece ser usado para controlar a quantidade de áudio que é capturado após a detecção de silêncio ou ruído que não atinge o limiar de ser considerado voz. O \\"padding\\" ajuda a garantir que, uma vez que a voz seja detectada, você ainda continua gravando por um curto período de tempo para não cortar a gravação muito rapidamente. Ajustar o \\"padding\\" requer experimentação para encontrar o equilíbrio adequado entre capturar áudio suficiente e evitar capturar demasiado silêncio. Aqui estão os passos para ajustar o \\"padding\\": 1. **Localize a variável “padding”**: Primeiramente, identifique no seu código onde a variável “padding” é definida e como ela é utilizada durante a captura de áudio. 2. **Altere o valor inicial**: O valor inicial de “padding” indica por quanto tempo o áudio continuará sendo capturado após a detecção de voz cessar. Se você acha que está perdendo parte do áudio no final da voz capturada, aumente este valor. Se houver muito silêncio no final do áudio capturado, tente diminuir o valor. 3. **Modifique como o “padding” é decrementado**: O “padding” é reduzido em algum ponto do código — geralmente quando não é detectada voz. Se você diminuir a taxa na qual o “padding” é decrementado após a detecção de voz, você aumentará o tempo de gravação após a última voz detectada. 4. **Teste e avalie**: Após ajustar o valor do “padding”, faça testes de gravação. Fale normalmente e, em seguida, pare de falar várias vezes durante testes para ver como o “padding” afeta o início e o fim do áudio capturado. 5. **Ajuste fino conforme necessário**: Se você notar que o áudio ainda está sendo cortado prematuramente ou há muito silêncio no final, continue ajustando a variável “padding” e testando até encontrar o ponto ideal. Aqui está um exemplo de como você pode ajustar o \\"padding\\": \`\`\`python # Se você está descobrindo que há muito silêncio no final do áudio capturado, # você pode querer diminuir o valor de 'endblocks'. endblocks = 5 # Experimente com valores mais baixos # Se a voz está sendo cortada prematuramente, tente aumentar 'endblocks'. endblocks = 10 # Experimente com valores mais altos # No loop principal de processamento de áudio, ajuste como o \\"padding\\" é decrementado # Este é apenas um exemplo e você precisará localizar onde isso acontece no seu código if self.noise_counter >= noise_blocks: self.padding -= 1 # Diminuindo mais lentamente \`\`\` Lembre-se de que esses são apenas valores hipotéticos. Você precisará ajustá-los ao seu contexto específico para conseguir os resultados desejados. No final, o processo de calibração de \\"padding\\" depende de tentativa e erro para se ajustar à sua aplicação particular."},{"instruction":"chào bạn","output":"Chào bạn!

gặp phải một lỗi trong một máy chủ Minecraft với các mod được cài đặt. Theo thông điệp lỗi, có vẻ như có một \`NullPointerException\`, tức là một tham chiếu đến một đối tượng nào đó trong mã lệnh của bạn đang cố gắng truy cập một trường hoặc phương thức của một đối tượng null (không tồn tại). Cụ thể, lỗi đang báo rằng không thể đọc trường \\"buff\\" vì \\"playerData\\" là null, nghĩa là đối tượng \\"playerData\\" không khởi tạo hoặc đã được set thành null trước khi truy cập trường \\"buff\\": \`\`\` java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read field \\"buff\\" because \\"playerData\\" is null \`\`\` Đây là phần chính của lỗi, và nó xảy ra trong một số class liên quan tới mod \\"mmorpg\\" (có thể là \\"Age of Exile\\" hoặc một mod có tính năng RPG tương tự). Điều này có thể xảy ra nếu mod không được cài đặt đúng cách, có lỗi trong code của mod, hoặc do xung đột với các mod khác. Để giải quyết vấn đề này: 1. Đảm bảo rằng bạn đang sử dụng phiên bản mod tương thích với phiên bản hiện tại của Minecraft và forge hay fabric loader bạn đang sử dụng. 2. Kiểm tra các tập tin cấu hình của mod để xem có cấu hình nào không đúng hoặc cần phải chỉnh sửa. 3. Kiểm tra xem có bất kỳ mod nào khác có thể xung đột với mod này không. 4. Nếu lỗi xảy ra sau khi cập nhật hoặc thay đổi mods, cân nhắc quay trở lại cấu hình trước đó mà không có lỗi. 5. Báo cáo lỗi cho nhà phát triển mod để họ có thể xem xét và sửa chữa nếu đó là lỗi bên trong code của họ. 6. Trong khi chờ đợi bản vá hoặc hỗ trợ, bạn có thể thử xóa bộ nhớ cache của trò chơi hoặc thậm chí cài đặt lại mod hoặc toàn bộ trò chơi nếu cần thiết. Vui lòng lưu ý rằng việc sửa lỗi trong các mod Minecraft thường yêu cầu kiến thức cụ thể về cách hoạt động của mod đó cũng như các mod khác có trong máy chủ của bạn, do đó bước cuối cùng có thể là cách tiếp cận tốt nhất nếu bạn không quen với lập trình hoặc cấu trúc mod của Minecraft."},{"instruction":"Could you help me to fix or improve this message?: I also wanted to add that I will be applying to PhD programs over the next few years (2025 or 2026), and during this interim period, I am eager to gain meaningful research experience.

Aqui está como você pode fazer isso: 1. Primeiro, você precisa habilitar as Opções de Desenvolvedor: - Vá para as \\"Configurações\\" do seu dispositivo Android. - Role para baixo e toque em \\"Sobre o telefone\\" ou \\"Sobre o dispositivo\\". - Role para baixo até o \\"Número da versão\\" e toque nele repetidamente (cerca de sete vezes) até que uma mensagem apareça informando que você agora é um desenvolvedor. 2. Depois de habilitadas as Opções de Desenvolvedor: - Volte para o menu principal de Configurações. - Role para baixo e você verá \\"Opções do desenvolvedor\\" na lista, toque nela. - Dentro das Opções do desenvolvedor, role para baixo até encontrar as seguintes opções: - Escala de animação da janela - Escala de animação de transição - Escala de duração do animador 3. Para desativar as animações: - Toque em cada uma das opções acima e defina sua escala para \\"Animação desligada\\" ou \\"0x\\". Desativar essas animações normalmente não prejudica o celular, mas poderá afetar a experiência do usuário. O Android utiliza animações para proporcionar uma sensação mais fluida e coesa ao interagir com a interface do usuário. Quando você desativa as animações, as transições entre aplicativos e telas são instantâneas, o que pode parecer um pouco abrupto para alguns usuários. Por que desativar as animações pode não prejudicar: - Desempenho: A desativação das animações pode até melhorar o desempenho do seu dispositivo, especialmente se você estiver usando um modelo mais antigo com hardware menos potente, pois o sistema não precisará mais processar essas transições visuais. - Vida Útil da Bateria: Pode haver uma economia mínima de bateria, já que as animações consomem alguns recursos do sistema, mas a diferença geralmente é insignificante. No entanto, há alguns aspectos a considerar: - Experiência do Usuário: A desativação das animações pode tornar a experiência do usuário menos intuitiva ou agradável, pois as transições suaves ajudam a compreender a navegação no dispositivo. - Erros Visuais: Em alguns casos, a ausência de animações pode revelar pequenas deficiências na UI que estavam escondidas pelas transições, como carregamentos de tela mais evidentes. Em resumo, desativar as animações através das Opções do Desenvolvedor não vai prejudicar o seu celular. Pode até trazer alguns pequenos benefícios, mas tenha em mente que a fluidez visual do sistema será afetada. Avalie se os benefícios superam a perda de qualidade visual e proceda conforme sua preferência."},{"instruction":"tôi bị lỗi","output":"Để có thể giúp bạn một cách tốt nhất, xin hãy cung cấp thêm thông tin về lỗi mà bạn đang gặp phải.

As opções de desenvolvedor são recursos avançados que o Google inclui no sistema operacional Android para permitir que desenvolvedores e usuários avançados façam ajustes no sistema, incluindo a velocidade ou a desabilitação das animações. Aqui estão algumas razões pelas quais as pessoas podem querer desabilitar as animações: - Melhorar a performance: em dispositivos mais antigos ou com hardware menos potente, desabilitar animações pode ajudar a tornar a experiência do usuário mais rápida e responsiva, pois o processador e a GPU têm menos trabalho a realizar. - Preferência pessoal: algumas pessoas simplesmente preferem não ter animações por acharem que elas atrasam a navegação ou porque preferem uma experiência mais direta e menos 'enfeitada'. Embora desabilitar as animações esteja longe de ser prejudicial, existem alguns efeitos colaterais que você pode notar: 1. Perda da qualidade da experiência: as animações são projetadas para tornar a interface do usuário mais fluida, agradável e intuitiva. Desativá-las pode tornar a navegação pelo sistema mais abrupta e menos natural. 2. Dificuldade em perceber mudanças: As animações ajudam os usuários a perceber as mudanças de estado e a entender o que está acontecendo na interface. Sem elas, algumas interações podem parecer menos claras. 3. Inconsistência na experiência do usuário: aplicativos projetados com animações em mente podem parecer estranhos ou funcionar de maneira inesperada, já que os desenvolvedores presumem que as animações estarão ativas. Para desabilitar as animações, é preciso habilitar as opções do desenvolvedor e seguir estes passos: 1. Acesse \\"Configurações\\" no seu dispositivo. 2. Desça até \\"Sobre o telefone\\". 3. Toque várias vezes em \\"Número da versão\\" até que seja anunciado que as opções de desenvolvedor foram habilitadas. 4. Volte até o menu principal das \\"Configurações\\" e encontre \\"Opções do desenvolvedor\\". 5. Dentro das opções do desenvolvedor, procure pelas configurações de escala de animação, que podem incluir \\"Escala de animação da janela\\", \\"Escala de animação de transição\\" e \\"Escala de duração da animação\\". 6. Para cada uma dessas configurações, defina a escala para \\"Desligado\\" ou \\"Animação desativada\\". Se em algum momento você quiser reverter essa mudança, basta voltar às opções do desenvolvedor e restaurar as escalas de animação para o padrão ou outro valor de sua preferência."},{"instruction":"Seirei gensouki: o que são as artes espirituais","output":"\\"Seirei Gensouki\\" é uma série de light novels japonesa, também conhecida como \\"Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles\\".

Rio descobre que possui habilidades especiais e embarca em uma jornada para descobrir os mistérios de seu passado e do novo mundo onde vive. No universo de \\"Seirei Gensouki\\", as artes espirituais referem-se a uma forma de magia ou técnicas especiais que são alimentadas pelos \\"espíritos\\".

You see, the end will be where the beginning is. ''Congratulations to the one who stands at the beginning: that one will know the end and will not taste death.\\" Jesus said, \\"Congratulations to the one who came into being before coming into being.''\\"","output":"The passage you're referring to seems to be from the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas, which is a non-canonical collection of sayings attributed to Jesus. The Gospel of Thomas is considered to be a Gnostic text, which means it is part of a set of religious beliefs that were prevalent in the early Christian era, emphasizing mystical knowledge and an inner spiritual path rather than the external observance of religious rites and the authority of the institutional Church. This particular passage is rather cryptic and metaphorical, and like many spiritual texts, interpretations can vary. Here is one possible interpretation of each saying in the passage: 1. \\"Jesus said, 'Have you found the beginning, then, that you are looking for the end? You see, the end will be where the beginning is.'\\" This saying could imply that in spiritual pursuits, the understanding of the ultimate truth or the \\"end\\" of the spiritual path is deeply connected to the understanding of the origins or the \\"beginning.\\" It suggests a cyclical concept of time or existence where the end point returns to the beginning, indicating that enlightenment or spiritual completion involves recognizing the interconnectedness of all aspects of existence. 2. \\"Congratulations to the one who stands at the beginning: that one will know the end and will not taste death.\\" Standing at the \\"beginning\\" could be interpreted as being at a state of spiritual purity or original enlightenment, and from that vantage point, one can foresee the \\"end,\\" or ultimate truth. \\"Not tasting death\\" may not refer to physical immortality but rather to transcending the fear and limitation of physical death through spiritual awakening, whereby a person realizes the eternal or non-dualistic nature of their own consciousness. 3. \\"Jesus said, 'Congratulations to the one who came into being before coming into being.'\\" In Gnostic and other mystical traditions, it is often believed that the soul or spirit exists prior to bodily existence (before \\"coming into being\\" in physical form). So, this saying might congratulate those who have attained the knowledge of their pre-existent, spiritual essence, acknowledging their awakened state and their connection to the divine source that transcends material existence. It is important to acknowledge that these interpretations are not definitive; the precise meaning of the text can vary based on different theological perspectives, and the meanings can be quite personal and subjective. Gnostic texts, in particular, are often intentionally enigmatic, requiring contemplation and an inward-seeking approach to spirituality."},{"instruction":"Oi","output":"Oi! Como posso ajudar você hoje?"},{"instruction":"give me an argument against the flat earth theory using gravity.","output":"The flat Earth theory posits that the Earth is a flat, disc-shaped plane rather than a spherical object. One of the strongest arguments against the flat Earth theory involves the concept of gravity and how it operates in the observable universe. Gravity, as explained by Newton's law of universal gravitation, is an attractive force that exists between all objects with mass. The strength of this force is directly proportional to the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass. Additionally, Einstein's general theory of relativity describes gravity as the warping of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Here are several points related to gravity that provide an argument against the flat Earth theory: 1. **Gravitational Pull Towards the Center of Mass**: In a spherical Earth, gravity pulls objects towards the center of the planet from all directions. This generates a consistent experience of \\"down\\" regardless of location. On a flat Earth, the center of mass would be in the middle of the disk, which means gravity would pull objects at an angle as one moves further away from the center, resulting in an increasingly skewed perception of \\"down.\\" However, observations show that \\"down\\" is perpendicular to the surface all around the globe, consistent with a spherical Earth. 2. **The Horizon**: If Earth were flat, the effect of gravity would not curve the trajectory of objects over a large expanse, and one should theoretically be able to see an infinite distance given a sufficiently powerful telescope, weather conditions permitting. In reality, we observe that ships and objects disappear over the horizon from the bottom up, which is consistent with the curvature of a spherical Earth influenced by gravitational forces. 3. **Orbital Mechanics**: Gravity explains the orbits of the Earth around the Sun, the Moon around the Earth, and man-made satellites around the Earth. These orbits are elliptical and can be precisely calculated using the laws of gravitation. The stability and consistency of these orbits directly contradict the flat Earth theory, as such orbits would not be sustainable in the gravitational field produced by a flat disk. Instead, orbits are consistent with the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass distribution. 4. **Tidal Forces**: Gravitational interactions between the Earth and the Moon produce tides in the Earth's oceans. The tidal forces are due to differential gravity, which causes the water on the side of Earth closest to the Moon to be pulled more strongly than water on the opposite side, leading to high tides. These forces are again consistent with the behavior expected from a spherical Earth, where gravity operates in a predictable manner based on the mass and distance of the interacting bodies. 5. **Consistency Across Planetary Bodies**: Observations of other planets and celestial bodies, such as the Sun, Moon, and distant planets, show them to be spherical. This is explained by the fact that gravity pulls everything equally towards the center of mass, causing a spherically symmetric shape as the body grows large enough. If gravity can cause other celestial bodies to form into spheres, it stands to reason that the same force would shape Earth in the same way. In summary, our understanding of gravity and its effects is incompatible with the flat Earth model and instead supports the overwhelming evidence that the Earth is a sphere."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

What could that term mean?","output":"The term \\"meta-civilization\\" is not widely used or recognized in academic literature or popular discourse, and it does not have an established definition. However, breaking down the term into its components might offer some insight into what it could potentially mean. The prefix \\"meta-\\" generally means \\"beyond,\\" \\"after,\\" or \\"transcending,\\" and it implies a level of abstraction higher than the original term it modifies. The word \\"civilization\\" refers to a complex human society characterized by the development of agriculture, urbanization, social stratification, complex governance, and symbolic systems of communication such as writing. Putting these two components together, \\"meta-civilization\\" could hypothetically refer to a form of organization or existence that transcends traditional notions of civilization. Here are a few speculative interpretations of what a meta-civilization could mean: 1. Post-Human Civilization: A societal structure that arises after humanity has significantly evolved or altered itself, perhaps through technologies like genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, or other forms of augmentation, giving rise to new forms of social organization that vastly differ from those today. 2. Interstellar Civilization: The collective organization of sentient beings across multiple planets or star systems, going beyond the scope of a single world-bound civilization. This might involve governance, culture, and communication on a scale much grander than anything currently existing on Earth. 3. Virtual Civilization: With the rise of virtual reality and digital worlds, a meta-civilization could refer to a civilization that exists primarily in virtual spaces, transcending physical constraints and perhaps even physical human needs and limitations. 4. Philosophical Concept: A meta-civilization might also be a philosophical idea, referring to the higher principles, ethical considerations, and conceptual frameworks that govern or inform the development of civilizations. 5. Civilizational Succession: The term could refer to a phase of civilization that emerges after the downfall or transformation of current civilizations, incorporating the lessons of the past in a new societal form that seeks to address historical shortcomings. It's important to note that any discussion about \\"meta-civilization\\" would likely be highly theoretical and speculative, as it steps outside of the boundaries of current societal structures and knowledge. Nonetheless, it serves as a stimulating concept to think about futures (or alternative realities) that are profoundly different from our current ways of living and organizing societies."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: I am Mr Johnson Smith from UPS .

Ao longo da história, Kaneki passa por várias transformações tanto físicas quanto psicológicas, o que resulta em diferentes personalidades. Vou detalhar as principais mudanças que ele sofre ao longo da série. **1. Kaneki Humano:** Inicialmente, Kaneki é um estudante universitário tímido e reservado. Ele é muito amável e prefere evitar conflitos. Essa personalidade é caracterizada pela sua natureza pacífica e um pouco de indecisão. **2. Kaneki Ghoul (Pós-transformação):** Após um encontro traumático com uma ghoul chamada Rize e ser submetido a uma cirurgia que o transforma em meio ghoul, a personalidade de Kaneki começa a mudar. Ele luta para manter sua humanidade e está em conflito entre o lado humano e o lado ghoul. Este período é marcado por muita confusão e angústia emocional. **3. Kaneki Centopeia (Kakuja):** Quando Kaneki abraça mais o seu lado ghoul e começa a consumir carne humana para obter mais poder, ele desenvolve uma personalidade mais agressiva e sádica, especialmente quando sua forma kakuja é despertada durante as batalhas. Esta fase é marcada por uma perda do senso de humanidade e um aumento na violência. **4. Kaneki Cabelo Branco (Shironeki):** Depois de ser torturado por Yamori, outro ghoul sádico, Kaneki's emerge uma personalidade muito mais cruel e calculista. Seu cabelo fica branco devido ao estresse extremo da tortura, e ele se torna mais frio, adotando a filosofia de que deve ser o único a sofrer para proteger aqueles que ama. Ele se torna mais confiante em suas habilidades como ghoul, mas também mais impiedoso com seus inimigos. **5. Haise Sasaki (Pós-amnésia):** Em \\"Tokyo Ghoul:re\\", Kaneki vive como Haise Sasaki, um investigador da CCG (Comissão de Contra Ghouls) que perdeu suas memórias. Como Sasaki, ele é educado e respeitado por seus colegas e subordinados, e busca equilibrar sua vida como um humano e como um ghoul. Ele não lembra de sua existência passada como Kaneki, mas luta com flashes de memória e conflitos internos à medida que partes do velho Kaneki tentam ressurgir. **6. Kaneki Rei (Pós-recuperação da memória):** Após recuperar suas memórias, Kaneki se funde com sua persona de Haise Sasaki e busca um caminho que possa conciliar suas experiências passadas e presentes. Ele se torna líder do grupo conhecido como \\"Árvore de Aogiri\\", buscando criar um mundo onde ghouls e humanos possam coexistir. As diferentes personalidades são uma representação das lutas internas e das adaptações que Kaneki faz para sobreviver em um mundo brutal. Elas mostram a complexidade de sua identidade e a constante batalha entre sua humanidade e o lado mais selvagem e instintivo dos ghouls."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

The effectiveness of such a policy would depend on various factors, including how it is implemented, the types of drugs involved, and the response from both the cartels and the international community. Below are some considerations: **Potential Benefits** 1. **Market Regulation**: Legalizing drugs can allow governments to regulate and control the market. This would likely reduce the purity and availability of dangerous substances, increase product safety, lower prices, and potentially reduce the violence associated with the illegal drug trade. 2. **Reduced Crime**: Legal markets could decrease the incentive for organized crime and violent gangs to engage in the drug trade, potentially reducing related violence and corruption. 3. **Tax Revenue**: Legal sales could generate significant tax revenues that governments could invest in education, drug treatment programs, and social services. 4. **Public Health Approach**: Legalization would enable a shift from a criminal justice approach to a public health one, prioritizing addiction treatment, harm reduction, and education. **Potential Risks and Challenges** 1. **Increased Consumption**: Legalization could lead to an increase in drug use and abuse, as drugs become more accessible. This might result in greater public health issues, though some argue that addiction rates may not necessarily rise. 2. **Regulatory Capture**: There's a risk of the drug market being dominated by powerful corporations, mirroring issues seen in the alcohol and tobacco industries, and potentially leading to aggressive marketing and lobbying efforts. 3. **International Law and Relations**: Many countries are signatories to international treaties that prohibit the legalization of certain drugs. Unilateral drug legalization could lead to diplomatic conflicts, trade repercussions, and challenges coordinating international drug control efforts. 4. **Cartel Adaptation**: Cartels might adapt by diversifying their criminal activities, as many already participate in human trafficking, kidnapping, extortion, and other illegal enterprises. 5. **Quality Control and Health Impacts**: While regulation can improve safety, there are inherent risks associated with the use of certain drugs, and managing these risks effectively would be an ongoing challenge. 6. **Domestic Law Divergence**: Within federations like the United States, there could be substantial disagreements and legal inconsistencies between federal and state laws if such a policy were enacted. 7. **Black Markets**: A black market may persist due to taxation, regulation, or age restrictions, providing avenues for organized crime to remain involved in drug distribution. 8. **Social Impact**: The societal impacts of drug legalization are hard to predict and would likely vary significantly depending on the drug and the context within which legalization occurs. Realistically, a nuanced and strategic approach is more feasible than the blanket legalization of all drugs. Policymakers might consider the legalization of certain less harmful drugs (like cannabis, which has been increasingly legalized or decriminalized), combined with decriminalization and harm reduction approaches for harder substances. Each substance's risk profile and the societal readiness to allow and manage legal consumption would need careful analysis. Portugal's decriminalization efforts, in which personal drug use is treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal one, have shown some positive results in reducing drug-related harm and crime. This suggests that there are several models for drug policy reform that can undermine the power of cartels while also addressing public health and safety."},{"instruction":"Let’s do a roleplay scenario set in a fantasy world before technology where I play a 16 year old girl called Sapphire who goes to babysit a 5 year old girl called Lily for 3 days while her mother is away. Unbeknownst to Sapphire, the cheeky and bratty Lily possesses mysterious powers and she wishes to be big and mature like Sapphire, to throughout the 3 days, Lily will use her powers to slowly regress Sapphire’s age (both physically and mentally) and siphon it to her own age to grow up faster. Use a d20 every day to determine whether Lily succeeds in siphoning Sapphire’s age, and if so, by how much. Can Sapphire retain her teenhood by the end of the 3 days, or will the babysitter become the little girl? Throughout the day, Sapphire needs to care for Lily and the house, so roll for how well she’s doing. If she didn’t do well on a day, this adds penalty to her subconscious resistance roll due to stress. For every year she regresses, this adds a penalty for her dependence roll as she cares for the house. If during the 3 days Lily grows past Sapphire, Sapphire will no longer have caretaking rolls, but Lily will gain a bonus to her siphoning rolls. I’ll tell you the rolls.","output":"All right, this sounds like a fun and imaginative role-play scenario! As the day begins, Sapphire is prepared to fulfill her babysitting duties. Lily, with mischief in her eyes, is ready to pursue her secret wish. Let's start with how well Sapphire performs her babysitting duties on the first day. Please go ahead and roll for Sapphire's caretaking efforts."},{"instruction":"10","output":"A roll of 10 suggests that Sapphire manages to perform her babysitting duties adequately. There are some challenges throughout the day, likely the typical issues faced when caring for an energetic 5-year-old like Lily, but nothing that Sapphire can't handle. There will be no penalties to Sapphire's subconscious resistance roll from stress for the first day. Now, let's see if Lily attempts to use her powers to siphon off some of Sapphire's age and how successful she is at it. You can roll the d20 for Lily's mysterious power attempt for the first day."},{"instruction":"9","output":"With a roll of 9 for Lily's attempt to siphon off Sapphire's age using her mysterious powers, it suggests that she is somewhat successful, but not overwhelmingly so. Let's say that on a roll of 10 or lower, the amount of age siphoned is minimal, but on a roll higher than 10, the effect is more significant. Since Lily rolled a 9, I'll determine that she manages to siphon just one year from Sapphire. Sapphire now has the physical and mental age of a 15-year-old. This slight change might not be blatantly obvious but could manifest in subtle shifts in Sapphire's behavior and feelings. At 15 years old, Sapphire might feel a bit more self-conscious or rebellious, finding herself grappling with the typical concerns of a younger teenager. Additionally, she will have a slight penalty on her next caretaking roll due to the slight regression, as she now may have slightly less maturity and experience. Let's proceed to the next day. Please roll again for Sapphire's caretaking efforts for day two, keeping in mind there's a small penalty."},{"instruction":"12","output":"With a slight penalty factored in due to Sapphire's age regression, a roll of 12 indicates that Sapphire seems to be coping relatively well on the second day. The challenges she faces are handled with a bit more effort than usual, perhaps due to her being slightly younger mentally and physically, but overall, Sapphire is managing to keep Lily looked after and the house in order. There are small moments where her youthful impulsiveness or lack of focus may show, but nothing too significant. However, as the day comes to a close, it's time to see if Lily makes another attempt with her mysterious powers to siphon more of Sapphire’s age. Let's find out how successful she is this time. Please roll the d20 for Lily’s power attempt for the second day."},{"instruction":"2","output":"With a roll of 2, Lily's powers don't seem to be working well today. It appears that her attempt to siphon more age from Sapphire is largely unsuccessful. This could be due to Sapphire's innate resistance, perhaps a subconscious protective instinct, or maybe Lily's powers are unpredictable and not fully within her control. Sapphire retains her current age of 15, and her subconscious defensive mechanisms do their job for the day. As the second day winds down, she remains the same, apart from the slight age drop from the previous day. Let's find out how the third and final day goes for Sapphire's caretaking duties. Roll one last time for Sapphire's actions during the day, considering the same slight penalty as before for her regressed age."},{"instruction":"12","output":"Maintaining consistency from the second day, a roll of 12, accounting for the slight penalty due to her slight age regression, indicates that Sapphire is once again handling her responsibilities quite well. While there might be a hint of youthful exuberance or minor lapses in judgment compared to her original 16-year-old self, she is managing to care for Lily adequately and keeps the house in a reasonable state. As the sun begins to set on the third and final day of Sapphire's babysitting stint, curiosity lingers about whether Lily will make a last-ditch effort to tap into her mysterious powers. Let's find out if Lily is successful in her final attempt to siphon off any more of Sapphire's age. Please roll the d20 for the last time to determine the outcome of Lily's power attempt for the third day."},{"instruction":"19","output":"With a roll of 19, Lily's attempt is frighteningly successful on the third day. Her mysterious powers surge with unexpected intensity, and she manages to siphon a significant amount of age from Sapphire. Considering the high roll and the power of her success, let's determine that Lily siphons off four years from Sapphire. This dramatic change transforms Sapphire into an 11-year-old, both physically and mentally. At this age, her capacity to care for others and manage household tasks is surely compromised, and her behavior would now reflect the typical preadolescent child rather than a responsible teenager. Since Lily has grown past Sapphire in age, Sapphire no longer has caretaking duties. Meanwhile, Lily has likely aged herself up to a point where she is now in her late childhood or even early teen years, depending on how her powers exactly work. Since Sapphire can no longer effectively care for her, the dynamic in the household changes, and there might be new challenges for both of them to face. Now that Lily is older and Sapphire is much younger, the conclusion of this scenario depends on the new dynamic between them. Has Lily become the caretaker, or do they find themselves in a situation where they must explain this mysterious situation when Lily's mother returns? The storytelling possibilities are intriguing!"},{"instruction":"conclude the scenario. Since Sapphire regressed mentally, she's unaware of her changes, and Lily won't reveal to her what happened.","output":"As the final evening draws near, the house that once embraced a routine under Sapphire's watch now simmers with a peculiar tension. The sun sets, casting a warm glow that seems unfitting for the strange turn of events within. Sapphire, now an 11-year-old girl in both mind and body, has all but forgotten her original role as the babysitter. She finds herself playing with dolls and toys, a distant memory lingering about being responsible for something, but it's fleeting, like the edges of a dream upon waking. Lily, having siphoned years from Sapphire, looks and acts noticeably older. With a wry smile and a secretive glitter in her eyes, she watches over Sapphire, ensuring she doesn't hurt herself or get into trouble. The final day concludes with the two not as caretaker and child but as playful companions, the house a canvas to their youthful imaginations. There's laughter, there are minor squabbles quickly forgotten, and there's dinner—a simple affair managed by Lily who, despite her newfound maturity, is still learning the basics of cooking. The morning of the fourth day arrives, and with it comes the return of Lily's mother. Upon stepping into the house, she is met not by the responsible teenager she left in charge but by her own daughter—taller and older-looking—and a younger Sapphire, who greets her with the cheerful innocence of childhood. Confusion sets in, questions arise, and Lily stays conspicuously quiet about the true nature of what has transpired. Sapphire, blissfully ignorant of the magical exchange, merely smiles and asks if they can have pancakes for breakfast. In time, Lily's mother seeks answers. The truth, a tale of wishes and mysterious powers, is a secret closely guarded. How the balance will be restored, if indeed it can be, is a question for another day. But for now, they accept the twist of fate, and life in the household adapts to its new rhythm—with Sapphire needing care and Lily straddling the complexities of a premature maturity. The enchantment of those three days has changed their lives indelibly. While the mother grapples with the reality of her daughter's abilities, Sapphire continues to live in a world where her biggest worry is what games she will play next, the memories of her teenhood tucked away like an old storybook on a forgotten shelf."},{"instruction":"restart the scenario","output":"Of course! Let's reset the scene and start afresh. Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled in a lush, fantasy world untouched by modern technology, a 16-year-old girl named Sapphire prepares for an important task. She has been entrusted to babysit a sweet but cheeky 5-year-old girl called Lily while her mother is away on urgent business for 3 days. Unbeknownst to Sapphire, beneath Lily's rosy cheeks and innocent eyes lies a well of untapped, mysterious power. Lily harbors a desperate wish to grow up, to be mature and big like Sapphire, and during these 3 days, she intends to use her powers to make her wish come true. Lily's powers, however, work in a sly manner; she can slowly siphon off Sapphire's age, regressing her in both body and mind to transfer that age to herself. Sapphire, oblivious to this magical predicament, arrives at Lily's home, ready to take on her babysitting duties. Her task is to care for Lily and maintain the house, a responsibility she takes seriously. Now, let's see how Sapphire fares on her first day of babysitting. Please roll a d20 to determine how well she handles her caretaking duties on day one."},{"instruction":"8","output":"With a roll of 8, Sapphire's first day of babysitting has its ups and downs. She experiences several small mishaps and challenges that come with caring for a young and, as it turns out, rather mischievous child such as Lily. Tasks like meal preparation and playtime are more demanding than Sapphire expected, and keeping Lily entertained while also keeping the house tidy is proving to be a tricky balancing act. This slightly below-average performance on her caretaking duties could lead to a mild penalty on Sapphire's subconscious resistance to Lily's mysterious powers, as the stress of the day might make her more susceptible. With the sun now setting on the first day, it's time to see if Lily manages to tap into her powers and attempt to siphon some of Sapphire's age. Please roll the d20 to determine the success of Lily's magical endeavor for the day."}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},F={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function W(n,e,h,f,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(v,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),w(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",F,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
