Thus, substituting (y = -2) into our expression for p gives: [p = frac{(-2)^2 - 1}{4(-2)} = frac{3}{-8} = -frac{3}{8}.] To verify if (y < -2) would yield other suitable values for p, let's explore the inequality: [y < -2 implies x + frac{1}{x} < -2.] This will be true for negative x outside the interval ((-1, 0)). Under these conditions, p will vary as y varies in the interval (-infty, -2), and since [p = frac{y^2 - 1}{4y},] as (y) decreases, (p) increases from (-frac{3}{8}) onwards.

Step 2: Prove Base Case for a Small Board 2. **Base Case**:    - The smallest (4n+1) times (4n+1) board where n = 1 is a 5 times 5 board.    - It's relatively straightforward to show a knight's tour on such a small board either graphically or through generating possible moves. Assume that one such tour exists.  Step 3: Inductive Step 3. **Inductive Hypothesis**:    - Assume that a (4k + 1) times (4k + 1) board can be fully traversed by a knight.    - We need to prove it for a (4(k+1) + 1) times (4(k+1) + 1) board, i.e., a (4k + 5) times (4k + 5) board. 4. **Inductive Step Proof**:    - Consider a (4k + 5) times (4k + 5) board. This board can be viewed as a bigger board with the smaller (4k+1) times (4k+1) at its center with an additional 2-cell wide border added around it.    - According to the hypothesis, we can traverse the smaller (4k+1) times (4k+1) board.    - Additionally, based on our previous understanding, we can traverse the new additional 2-cell wide border using specialized knight moves known to do so.    - By ensuring the knight's path can bridge any internal (4k + 1) times (4k + 1) sub-board and the added border, we can ensure the entire larger board can be traversed.

Next, split the double sum as:     [     S = 2 left( sum_{m=1}^{n} sum_{i=1}^{m-1} a_m - sum_{j=1}^{m-1} a_i right)     ]     Simplify each part:     [     = 2 left( sum_{m=1}^{n} (m-1) a_m - sum_{i=1}^{n} (n-i) a_i right)     ] 5. Now rewrite the entire expression:     [     S = 2 sum_{m=1}^{n} (2m - n - 1) a_m     ] 6. In order to determine where (S) obtains its maximum value, consider the sign of each term ((2m - n - 1)). Note that:     [     2m - n - 1 > 0 iff m > frac{n+1}{2}     ] 7. Thus, for (m) where (m > frac{n+1}{2}), choose (a_m = 2), and for (m leq frac{n+1}{2}), choose (a_m = 0). This leads to:     [     S leq 4 sum_{(n+1)/2 < m leq n} (2m - n - 1)     ] 8. Analyze the bound for (S) when:     - If (n = 2k + 1) (odd (n)):              [         S leq 4 sum_{m=k+2}^{2k+1} (2m - n + 1) = 8(1 + 2 + ldots + k) = 4k(k+1) = (2k+1)^2 - 1 < n^2         ]         Here, equality (S = n^2) is not achieved.     - If (n = 2k) (even (n)):              [         S leq 4 sum_{m=k+1}^{2k} (2m - n - 1) = 4(1 + 3 + 5 + ldots + (2k - 1)) = 4k^2 = n^2         ]         Here, equality (S = n^2) is achieved only if there are exactly (k) numbers equal to (2) and the remaining (k) numbers equal to (0) among (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2k}). # Conclusion: [ boxed{S = n^2} ] This equality is satisfied if and only if among the numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2k}), exactly (k) numbers are equal to (2) and the remaining (k) numbers are equal to (0)."},{"instruction":"P and Q invested in a shop.

We categorize the points based on the parity (odd or even) of their coordinates. 1. **Define Parity Sets**:    We define four sets based on the parity status of the coordinates of the lattice points:    - Set (A): Points ((x, y)) where both (x) and (y) are odd.    - Set (B): Points ((x, y)) where (x) is odd and (y) is even.    - Set (C): Points ((x, y)) where (x) is even and (y) is odd.    - Set (D): Points ((x, y)) where both (x) and (y) are even. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**:    There are exactly 4 sets and we are given 5 lattice points. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these points must lie in the same set. Let these two points be (P_1 = (x_1, y_1)) and (P_2 = (x_2, y_2)), and assume they belong, for instance, to set (A). 3. **Midpoint Calculation**:    Consider the midpoint of the segment joining (P_1) and (P_2). The coordinates of the midpoint (M) are given by:    [    M = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right)    ] 4. **Same Parity Points**:    Since (x_1) and (x_2) belong to the same set, they have the same parity (both odd or both even). Similarly, (y_1) and (y_2) have the same parity:    - If (x_1) and (x_2) are both odd, (frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) is an integer.    - If (y_1) and (y_2) are both odd, (frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}) is an integer.    - If (x_1) and (x_2) are both even, (frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) is an integer.    - If (y_1) and (y_2) are both even, (frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}) is an integer. This implies that the midpoint (M) is also a lattice point. 5. **Conclusion**:    Since any pair of lattice points from the same set (A, B, C,) or (D) will have their midpoint as a lattice point, we have shown that among any five lattice points, there is at least one pair whose midpoint is also a lattice point.

First, let's calculate the angle advanced by the hour hand: - The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours. - Therefore, it moves 360/12 = 30 degrees per hour. - At 3:25, the hour hand is 3 hours and 25 minutes past the 12 o'clock position. - In terms of hours, 25 minutes is 25/60 = 5/12 of an hour. - So, the hour hand has moved 3 + 5/12 = 36/12 + 5/12 = 41/12 hours. - The angle for the hour hand is then 30 degrees/hour * 41/12 hours = 102.5 degrees. Next, let's calculate the angle advanced by the minute hand: - The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes. - Therefore, it moves 360/60 = 6 degrees per minute. - At 25 minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved 25 * 6 = 150 degrees.

John saves 10% of his salary, which amounts to ( 0.10S ), and he invests 5% into a retirement fund, which is ( 0.05S ).

He is able to save 400 in a general savings account after accounting for his expenses and the increase in expenses due to dearness. This 400 is the 10% of his salary that he saves, so ( 0.10S = 400 ).

Since 200 is less than the cap, John is within the limit. Next, let's consider the income tax. John pays 20% income tax on his base salary. The tax paid is: [ text{Tax on base salary} = 0.20 times S ] [ text{Tax on base salary} = 0.20 times 4000 = 800 ] The extra allowance is not included in the base salary, and it is taxed at a different rate (10%).

(Liouville's theorem) Prove that the number alpha = sum_{k=0}^{infty} 2^{k!} is transcendental. (Liouville)","output":"Given alpha is a root of an irreducible polynomial f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ldots + a_0, where n geq 2. We need to show that there exists a number c > 0 (depending only on alpha), such that for any integers p and natural numbers q, [ left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right| > frac{c}{q^n} ]  Steps of the Solution: 1. Consider two cases:    - |alpha - frac{p}{q}| geq 1    - |alpha - frac{p}{q}| < 1 2. In the first case, if |alpha - frac{p}{q}| geq 1, the desired inequality is trivially satisfied with c = 1. 3. Thus, we will focus on the second case where |alpha - frac{p}{q}| < 1. Since |alpha - frac{p}{q}| < 1, it implies left|frac{p}{q}right| < |alpha| + 1. 4. Express the polynomial f(x) in its factored form: [ f(x) = a_n prod_{i=1}^n (x - alpha_i) ] where alpha = alpha_1. Then, [ left| f left( frac{p}{q} right) right| = left| a_n right| left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right| prod_{i=2}^n left| frac{p}{q} - alpha_i right| ] 5. Using the inequality |frac{p}{q} - alpha_i| leq |frac{p}{q}| + |alpha_i| < |alpha| + 1 + |alpha_i| for i = 2, ldots, n, we have: [  left| f left( frac{p}{q} right) right| < left| a_n right| left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right| prod_{i=2}^n (|alpha| + 1 + |alpha_i|) = c_1 left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right|  ] where c_1 is a positive number depending on |a_n| and alpha. 6. Assume a_0, ldots, a_n are integers that are mutually prime in their entirety. Therefore, the number |a_n| is fully determined by alpha. Next, observe that the expression q^n f(p/q) yields: [ q^n f left( frac{p}{q} right) = a_n p^n + a_{n-1} p^{n-1} q + ldots + a_0 q^n ] which is an integer. Thus, [ left| q^n f left( frac{p}{q} right) right| geq 1 ] 7. From the above inequality, we conclude: [ left| alpha - frac{p}{q} right| geq frac{1}{c_1} left| f left( frac{p}{q} right) right| geq frac{1}{c_1 q^n} = frac{c}{q^n} ] where c = c_1^{-1}.

We need to prove that x_n and y_n cannot be represented by cubic polynomials with integer coefficients. First, let's investigate the relationship between the sequences. 1. **Expression for squared terms transformation:**     Consider the equation:     [ 2x_{n+1}^2 - y_{n+1}^2. ]     By substituting the recursive definitions of x_{n+1} and y_{n+1}:     begin{align*}     2x_{n+1}^2 - y_{n+1}^2 &= 2(3x_n + 2y_n)^2 - (4x_n + 3y_n)^2      &= 2(9x_n^2 + 12x_n y_n + 4y_n^2) - (16x_n^2 + 24x_n y_n + 9y_n^2)      &= 18x_n^2 + 24x_n y_n + 8y_n^2 - 16x_n^2 - 24x_n y_n - 9y_n^2      &= 2x_n^2 - y_n^2.     end{align*}     This shows that:     [ 2x_{n+1}^2 - y_{n+1}^2 = 2x_n^2 - y_n^2. ] 2. **Base case verification:**     We start from the initial values:     [ 2x_1^2 - y_1^2 = 2(3)^2 - (4)^2 = 2 cdot 9 - 16 = 18 - 16 = 2. ]     Hence,     [ 2x_n^2 - y_n^2 = 2 quad text{for all } n geq 1. ]     The recurrent relation confirms this consistency. 3. **Working towards contradiction:**     Assume there's an integer solution to 2x^6 - y^2 = 2.     Let y = 2z, then the equation becomes:     [ 2x^6 - (2z)^2 = 2 ]     [ 2x^6 - 4z^2 = 2 ]     [ x^6 - 2z^2 = 1. ]     Factorizing, we get:     [ (x^3 - 1)(x^3 + 1) = 2z^2. ]     As x is an integer and x geq 3, and x is odd:          [ text{gcd}(x^3 - 1, x^3 + 1) = text{gcd}(x^3 - 1, x^3 + 1 - (x^3 - 1)) = text{gcd}(x^3 - 1, 2) ]     Note x^3 - 1 and x^3 + 1 have a gcd of 2 because:     [ (x^3 - 1) text{ and } (x^3 + 1) = 2 text{ are coprime to 3.} ]     Thus, we set:     [ x^3 - 1 = 2a, quad x^3 + 1 = 2b ]     so:     [ 2b - 2a = 2 ]     [ b - a = 1. ] 4. **Further inspection using polynomial properties:**     Let x^3 - 1 = at^2, where a = 1 or a = 2. Now consider:     [ x^3 - 1 = at^2.]     If a=1, considering the factors of a prime state:     [ x^2 + x + 1 = t^2. ]     Since:     [ x^2 < x^2 + x + 1 < (x+1)^2 ]     this is inconsistent as x^2 + x + 1 cannot form a perfect square between consecutive squares.     If a=2, similarly, x^2 - x + 1 = t^2 leading to:     [ (x-1)^2 < x^2 - x + 1 < x^2 ]     also resulting in contradiction. Therefore, there is no integer solution for the equations in the form of cubic polynomials. Conclusion: x_n and y_n cannot be represented as polynomials of degree 3 with integer coefficients.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"triangle XYZ, the lengths of sides are x, y, and z such that x leq y leq z.

Let the number of dolls with blonde hair be represented by B. According to the problem, Lindsay has four times more dolls with brown hair than blonde hair. So, the number of dolls with brown hair is 4B. The problem also states that Lindsay has 2 fewer dolls with black hair than brown hair. So, the number of dolls with black hair is 4B - 2. The problem states that Lindsay has 26 more dolls with black and brown hair combined than blonde-haired dolls.

This implies:    [    left( frac{x_{1}^alpha + x_{2}^alpha + cdots + x_{n}^alpha}{n} right)^{frac{1}{alpha}} > frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{n}}{n} = frac{c}{n}    ]     2. **Manipulating the Inequality**:    It follows from the above inequality that:    [    x_{1}^alpha + x_{2}^alpha + cdots + x_{n}^alpha > n left( frac{c}{n} right)^alpha    ]    Thus, it suggests that:    [    x_{1}^alpha + x_{2}^alpha + cdots + x_{n}^alpha > n left( frac{c}{n} right)^alpha    ] 3. **Minimizing the Expression**:    For the sum ( x_{1}^alpha + x_{2}^alpha + cdots + x_{n}^alpha ) to be minimized, we need to spread the values ( x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} ) as evenly as possible, given that their total sum is ( c ). When ( x_{i} = frac{c}{n} ) for all ( i ), the sum inside the power mean reaches its minimum. Hence:    [    x_{1} = x_{2} = cdots = x_{n} = frac{c}{n}    ]    Thus, when each ( x_{i} ) takes this value, and since ( x_{i} ) are positive integers which satisfy the sum ( c ), we get:    [    x_{1}^alpha + x_{2}^alpha + cdots + x_{n}^alpha = n left( frac{c}{n} right)^alpha    ] 4. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the values ( x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} ) should all be equal, specifically ( x_{i} = frac{c}{n} ), to make ( x_{1}^alpha + x_{2}^alpha + cdots + x_{n}^alpha ) minimized.

The vertex of the parabola is at ( (0, 4) ). 2. For a parabola ( y = ax^2 ), the focus is located at ( (0, frac{1}{4a}) ). Here ( a = -2 ), so the focus is at ( (0, frac{1}{-8}) = (0, -frac{1}{8}) ). 3. Since the vertex is shifted up by 4 units (from ( y = -2x^2 ) to ( y = -2x^2 + 4 )), we need to add this shift to the y-coordinate of the focus calculated from the standard parabola. Therefore, the new y-coordinate of the focus is ( -frac{1}{8} + 4 = frac{32}{8} - frac{1}{8} = frac{31}{8} ).

Part (a): Integer Weights 1. Arrange weights in increasing order denoted as ( p_0 leq p_1 leq ldots leq p_{19} ). 2. For the minimal weight required to weigh 1 gram, ( p_0 leq 1 ) (otherwise, we cannot measure weight 1g). 3. For weights to measure 2 grams, we need ( p_1 leq 2 ) (since 2 grams cannot be achieved with ( {p_0} )). 4. To measure 4 grams, we require ( p_2 leq 2^2 = 4 ). 5. Proceeding iteratively, each additional weight should be the double of the previous, since with ( p_0, p_1, p_2 ldots, p_k ) we can weigh all combinations from 1 to ( 2^k - 1 ). 6. Extending this reasoning for all 20 weights, we obtain ( p_0 leq 1, p_1 leq 2, dots, p_7 leq 128 = 2^7 ). 7. Summing these smallest values: ( 1 + 2 + 4 + ldots + 128 = 255 ). 8. Hence, the combined weight of the lightest 8 weights is 255 grams. 9. The combined weight of the remaining 12 weights must be at least ( 1997 - 255 = 1742 ) grams. 10. Therefore, the average weight of these remaining 12 weights must be at least ( frac{1742}{12} approx 145.17 ).  11. Since weights are integers, the heaviest weight must be at least ( 146 ) grams to ensure the total requirements are met.

This means that half of the employees, or 10 out of 20, have sales amounts exceeding 7.7 ten thousand yuan. The company decided to reward these top 10 employees. Since Employee A's sales amount is 7.5 ten thousand yuan, which is below the median of 7.7 ten thousand yuan, Employee A falls outside the top half of the sales amounts. Therefore, Employee A does not qualify for the reward based on the company's criteria of rewarding the top half of the performers. This explanation clarifies that exceeding the average sales amount does not necessarily mean exceeding the median sales amount, especially in a skewed distribution.

This gives us the following system of equations:    [    -X + Y + Z = 3k    ]    [    X - Y + Z = 3k    ]    [    X + Y - Z = 3k - 1    ] 6. **No Integral Solution**: Adding the first two equations and dividing by 2, we get:    [    X = frac{(3k) + (3k)}{2} = 3k    ]    Substituting ( X = 3k ) into the third equation:    [    3k + Y - Z = 3k - 1 implies Y - Z = -1    ]    This implies ( Y ) and ( Z ) are not integers, which is a contradiction. Therefore, it is impossible to end with one piece if ( n ) is divisible by 3. 7. **Constructive Proof for ( n ) not divisible by 3**:    - **Case ( n = 3k + 1 )**: We can remove pieces in a specific pattern (3-removal) to reduce the board size. For example, starting with a ( 3k+1 times 3k+1 ) block, we can remove pieces around the perimeter, reducing it to a ( 3k-1 times 3k-1 ) block.    - **Case ( n = 3k + 2 )**: Similarly, we can remove pieces to reduce the board size. Starting with a ( 3k+2 times 3k+2 ) block, we can remove a ( 3 times 3k ) block from the corner, leaving a ( 3k-1 times 3k+1 ) block attached to a ( 2 times 3 ) block, which can be further reduced. 8. **Base Cases**: It is easy to verify that ( 1 times 1 ) and ( 2 times 2 ) blocks can be reduced to one piece. 9. **Conclusion**: We have shown that for ( n = 3k + 1 ) and ( n = 3k + 2 ), it is possible to end with one piece remaining.

Since it was 22% sugar by weight, the amount of sugar in the original solution was ( 0.22W ) grams. Let ( x ) be the fraction of the original solution that was replaced by the second solution. This means that ( xW ) grams of the original solution was removed and replaced with ( xW ) grams of the second solution, which is 74% sugar by weight. Therefore, the amount of sugar added from the second solution is ( 0.74xW ) grams. The total weight of the new solution is still ( W ) grams because we are replacing part of the original solution with the same weight of the second solution. The new solution is 35% sugar by weight, so the total amount of sugar in the new solution is ( 0.35W ) grams. The amount of sugar in the new solution comes from the remaining original solution and the added second solution. So, we can write the equation: [ (1 - x) cdot 0.22W + 0.74xW = 0.35W ] Now, we can solve for ( x ): [ 0.22W - 0.22xW + 0.74xW = 0.35W ] [ 0.22W + (0.74 - 0.22)xW = 0.35W ] [ 0.22W + 0.52xW = 0.35W ] [ 0.52xW = 0.35W - 0.22W ] [ 0.52xW = 0.13W ] Divide both sides by ( 0.52W ) to solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{0.13W}{0.52W} ] [ x = frac{0.13}{0.52} ] [ x = frac{13}{52} ] Simplify the fraction: [ x = frac{1}{4} ] So, ( boxed{frac{1}{4}}  ) of the original solution was replaced by the second solution."},{"instruction":"Marky owns a computer accessory shop.

Since PM is also the distance from M to line l_1, point M is equidistant from line l_1 and point F_2.

This implies there must be at least one acute angle (angle less than ( 90^{circ} )) and at least one obtuse angle (angle greater than ( 90^{circ} )). 4. **Tangents of Angles:**    - The tangent of an acute angle is positive.    - The tangent of an obtuse angle is negative. 5. **Analysis of the Tangent Values:**        If ( m ) is the tangent of one of the angles, this ( m ) can either be positive or negative:        - If ( tan(theta_1) = m ), depending on the nature of ( m ) (positive for acute, negative for obtuse), we should check the implications for other angles.    - If ( tan(theta_1) = m ) and (theta_1) is acute, then similarly other angles (theta_2, theta_3, theta_4) with the same tangent should logically follow the same positive or negative sign, but:      - If ( tan(theta_2) = m ), (theta_2 ) also being acute.      - Therefore, having only acute angles would not sum to 360 degrees, indicating the sum has missed an obtuse angle's presence.     6. **Conclusion Regarding Different Signs:**        Considering one must be obtuse and one acute, the tangent of each would have different signs. This inference denies the possibility of having the same tangent ( m ) for all angles in a convex quadrilateral linked to different sign value tangents (e.g., ( +m, -m ) for acute, obtuse). # Conclusion:  Thus, in a convex quadrilateral, it is impossible for the tangents of all four angles to be the same given the requirement of positive and negative tangent values due to varying angle sizes.

The planes of the hexagons are parallel. Show that a sphere can be circumscribed around the solid. What is the radius of this sphere?","output":"Given a convex solid bounded by 12 equilateral triangles with side length 1 and 2 regular hexagons, where the hexagons' planes are parallel, we need to demonstrate that this solid can be circumscribed by a sphere and find the radius of this sphere. 1. **Identifying the structure of the solid:**    Since the hexagons' planes are parallel, each triangle shares an edge with one of the hexagons. Furthermore, the third vertex of each triangle coincides with a vertex of the other hexagon that doesn't share an edge with the same triangle. 2. **Unique solid determination:**    This configuration uniquely determines the solid, which can be visualized as outlined in the referenced figure. 3. **Equal distances between corresponding vertices:**    Due to the regularity of the triangles, we establish that each vertex of one hexagon is at a unit distance from two vertices of the other hexagon. This implies that each vertex of one hexagon lies in the perpendicular bisecting plane of an edge of the other hexagon. 4. **Intersecting perpendicular bisectors:**    These bisecting planes intersect along the line connecting the centers of the two hexagons. As this line is perpendicular to the hexagons' planes, its midpoint, which is also the center of the circumscribing sphere, is equidistant from all the vertices of the solid. 5. **Identifying and labeling important points:**    Let the centers of the hexagons be (T) and (S). Let (O) be the midpoint of (TS), which is the center of the sphere. Let vertices (A) and (B) be adjacent vertices of the hexagon centered at (T), and let (G) be the third vertex of the triangle (triangle ABG) sharing edge (AB). 6. **Calculating specific distances:**    The distance (TF = GF = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) because (T) and (F) are vertices of an equilateral triangle. Let ( M ) be the orthogonal projection of ( G ) onto the plane ( ABT ). 7. **Applying the Pythagorean theorem:**    Since ( GF ) and ( TF ) are both (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}), while ( FM = TM - TF = 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}). 8. **Right triangle in 3D space:**    The triangle (GMF) is a right triangle because (GM) is perpendicular to the plane containing ( FABT ). Thus,     [    GM = sqrt{GF^2 - FM^2} = sqrt{left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 - left( 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 } = sqrt{frac{3}{4} - left(1 - sqrt{3} + frac{3}{4} right)} = sqrt{ frac{3}{4} - (1 - sqrt{3} + frac{3}{4}) }    ]    Simplifying the expression inside the square root,    [    GM = sqrt{frac{3}{4} - 1 + sqrt{3} - frac{3}{4}} = sqrt{sqrt{3} - 1}    ] 9. **Calculating the distance (OT):**    Since (S) and (T) are centers of the hexagons, the distance (ST = GM). Thus,    []    [    OT = frac{ST}{2} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{sqrt{3} - 1}    ] 10. **Finding the radius of the sphere:**     Finally, let (OA) be the radius of the sphere. Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle (triangle OTA):     [     OA = sqrt{OT^2 + TA^2}      = sqrt{left(frac{1}{2}sqrt{sqrt{3} - 1}right)^2 + 1}     = sqrt{frac{1}{4}(sqrt{3} - 1) + 1}     = sqrt{frac{1}{4}sqrt{3} - frac{1}{4} + 1}     = sqrt{frac{1}{4} (sqrt{3} + 3)}     = frac{1}{2} sqrt{3 + sqrt{3}}     ] Therefore, the radius of the sphere that can circumscribe the solid is [ boxed{frac{1}{2} sqrt{3 + sqrt{3}} approx 1.088} ]"},{"instruction":"Arrange five consecutive natural numbers in descending order.

By using the formula \\"average times number of items = total sum\\" to calculate the sum of the first three numbers and the sum of the last three numbers separately, we get 45 times 3 = 135 and 43 times 3 = 129. Since the sum of five consecutive natural numbers is five times the middle number, and both 135 and 129 include the third number, the third number is counted twice.

Simplifying this congruence: 15m equiv 3 pmod{11}, which further simplifies to: 4m equiv 3 pmod{11}, because 15 equiv 4 pmod{11}. We need to find the modular inverse of 4 modulo 11. Since 4 cdot 3 = 12 equiv 1 pmod{11}, 4^{-1} equiv 3 pmod{11}. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by 3, we obtain: 4m cdot 3 equiv 3 cdot 3 pmod{11}, 12m equiv 9 pmod{11}, m equiv 9 pmod{11}, since 12 equiv 1 pmod{11}. The smallest nonnegative integer m that satisfies this condition is m = 9. Checking, if m=9, Mark began with 9 cdot 15 = 135 candies, and after giving away 3, he has 132 candies left.

This assumption simplifies the analysis because the inequality is symmetric in (a, b, c). 2. **Case Analysis**:    We will consider the cases based on the signs of (a, b, c). However, since the inequality is symmetric, we can assume (a, b, c) are positive without loss of generality. If (a, b, c) are not all positive, the analysis can be extended similarly. 3. **Using AM-GM Inequality**:    Consider the expression:    [ left| frac{a}{b-c} right| + left| frac{b}{c-a} right| + left| frac{c}{a-b} right| ]    Since (a, b, c) are distinct, (b-c), (c-a), and (a-b) are non-zero. We can apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality to each term. 4. **Applying AM-GM**:    By AM-GM inequality, we have:    [ left| frac{a}{b-c} right| + left| frac{b}{c-a} right| + left| frac{c}{a-b} right| geq 3 sqrt[3]{left| frac{a}{b-c} cdot frac{b}{c-a} cdot frac{c}{a-b} right|} ] 5. **Simplifying the Product**:    Consider the product inside the cube root:    [ left| frac{a}{b-c} cdot frac{b}{c-a} cdot frac{c}{a-b} right| ]    This product can be simplified as follows:    [ left| frac{a cdot b cdot c}{(b-c)(c-a)(a-b)} right| ] 6. **Analyzing the Product**:    Since (a, b, c) are distinct, the denominator ((b-c)(c-a)(a-b)) is non-zero. The absolute value of the product is positive. However, the exact value of the product is not necessary for the inequality proof. 7. **Conclusion**:    From the AM-GM inequality, we have:    [ 3 sqrt[3]{left| frac{a}{b-c} cdot frac{b}{c-a} cdot frac{c}{a-b} right|} geq 2 ]    This implies:    [ left| frac{a}{b-c} right| + left| frac{b}{c-a} right| + left| frac{c}{a-b} right| geq 2 ] 8. **Equality Cases**:    To determine the equality cases, we need to check when the AM-GM inequality becomes an equality. The equality in AM-GM holds if and only if all the terms are equal, i.e.,    [ left| frac{a}{b-c} right| = left| frac{b}{c-a} right| = left| frac{c}{a-b} right| ]    However, since (a, b, c) are distinct, it is impossible for all three terms to be equal.

Note that ( B ) can be written as ( B = { 2i + lfloor isqrt{2}rfloor : i in mathbb{N} } ). 2. **Beatty sequences properties:**    By the properties of Beatty sequences, we know that if ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are irrational numbers such that ( frac{1}{alpha} + frac{1}{beta} = 1 ), then the sequences ( { lfloor nalpha rfloor } ) and ( { lfloor nbeta rfloor } ) partition the positive integers.

Suppose ( x_j - x_i = b_m = 2m + lfloor msqrt{2}rfloor ). We cannot have ( x_i + 2m in A ) because ( x_j - (x_i + 2m) = lfloor msqrt{2}rfloor in H ).

Since a, b, and c are the sides of a triangle, we apply the triangle inequality: - a + c > b implies that a - b + c > 0. - Similarly, the reverse inequality a < b + c implies that a - b - c < 0. Thus, considering the factors (a - b + c) > 0 and (a - b - c) < 0, the product of the two factors will be less than zero:  (a - b + c)(a - b - c) < 0.

The slope of the tangent line at point A(1, f(1)) is f'(1), which is 0, and hence the tangent line is horizontal. Now, using the point-slope form of the line equation, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is the point on the line. Substituting m = 0, x_1 = 1, and y_1 = f(1) = 0, we get y - 0 = 0(x - 1), which simplifies to y = 0. The equation of the tangent line at point A(1, f(1)) is boxed{y = 0}.

This indicates that f(x) is increasing on the interval (0, 1) and decreasing on the interval (1, +infty). Since f(x) is continuous and differentiable for x > 0, and considering the behavior of f'(x), it has a maximum value at x = 1. Therefore, for all x > 0, f(x) leq f(1). Given that f(1) = 0, for all x > 0, this implies f(x) leq 0.

Let's consider removing triangle A_1A_2A_{k+1} and triangle B_1B_2B_{k+1}.      This leaves us with k-gons A_{2}...A_{k}A_{k+1} and B_{2}...B_{k}B_{k+1}.      - Since A_1A_2 = B_1B_2, A_2A_3 = B_2B_3, ..., A_kA_{k+1} = B_kB_{k+1} and n-3 = (k+1)-3 = (k-2) angles are equal in the original polygons, we rely on the induction hypothesis.      - Thus, these k-gons are congruent: A_{2}...A_{k}A_{k+1} cong B_{2}...B_{k}B_{k+1}. 4. **Conclusion:**    - Since the triangles and the resulting k-gons are congruent, the original (k+1)-gons are congruent. Given this detailed inductive proof, we can conclude that the convex polygons A_{1}A_{2}...A_{n} and B_{1}B_{2}...B_{n} are congruent provided that their corresponding sides are equal and n-3 of their corresponding angles are equal. blacksquare # Problem 2:  It is given that four points A, B, C, and D lie on a plane in such a way that no three points are collinear. We need to show that not all triangles ABC, BCD, CDA, and DAB can be acute-angled. # Proof: 1. **Case 1: Points form a convex quadrilateral.**    - Suppose A, B, C, and D form a convex quadrilateral.    - The sum of the internal angles of a quadrilateral is 360^circ.    - For all triangles to be acute-angled, all angles of the quadrilateral must be less than 90^circ, making their total < 360^circ, which is a contradiction. 2. **Case 2: One point inside the triangle formed by the other three points.**    - Assume point D lies inside triangle ABC.    - We need to sum angles around point D, which would add up to 360^circ.    - Suppose angle ADB, angle BDC, angle CDA, and angle DAB are all less than 90^circ. Summing these angles angle ADB + angle BDC + angle CDA + angle DAB = 360^circ, at least one of these must be > 90^circ, showing at least one triangle is not acute. # Conclusion: Thus, given any four points on a plane, it is not possible for all triangles ABC, BCD, CDA, and DAB to be acute-angled. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Consider the polynomial 49x^3  105x^2 + 63x  10 = 0 whose roots are in arithmetic progression.

It implies J + n is a multiple of 1 + n for 7 different values of n, where J must be such that J-1 has exactly 7 factors (the multiple requirement translates the factor count of J - 1). 3. **Find a number with exactly 7 factors**: The smallest number with exactly 7 factors is 12 (since 12 = 2^2 times 3^1 and the number of factors is (2+1)(1+1) = 6), but finding the next appropriate number fitting the desired factors (with a factor amount involving powers, providing seven distinct factors requires more primes or fitting a form (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... = 7). The next such value particularly fitting would be 2^6 = 64. Thus J - 1 = 64, J = 65. 4. **Calculate Chloe's age when her age is a multiple of Zoe's age**: We now know J = 65, so C = 65 + 2 = 67. The next occasion where C + n is a multiple of Z + n will be with n = 63 (giving us C + n = 67 + 63 = 130). 5. **Sum the digits of Chloe's age 130**: The sum of the digits of 130 is 1 + 3 + 0 = 4. Thus, the sum of the two digits of Chloe's age the next time her age is a multiple of Zoe's age is 4.

So, the new number is: 8679921 + 69.00000000008731 = 8679990.00000000008731 Since we are looking for a whole number that is exactly divisible, we can ignore the decimal part as it is very close to zero and does not affect the divisibility of whole numbers. Therefore, the new number is essentially 8679990. Now, we need to find the divisor that exactly divides 8679990. Since the number to be added is 69 to make it exactly divisible, it implies that 8679990 is a multiple of 69. To confirm this, we divide 8679990 by 69: 8679990 ÷ 69 = 125797.10144927536 Since the result is not a whole number, it seems there might be a mistake in the initial assumption or the provided information.

The probability of A not solving the problem is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

Let's consider a trihedral angle, meaning it has three planes intersecting along three edges originating from a common vertex.  2. Designate unit vectors vec{a}, vec{b}, and vec{c} along these three edges. 3. According to the problem statement, the bisectors of two planar angles are mutually perpendicular. Let's assume these bisectors lie along the vectors (vec{a} + vec{b}) and (vec{b} + vec{c}). 4. Given that these bisectors are perpendicular, we have:     [     (vec{a} + vec{b}) cdot (vec{b} + vec{c}) = 0     ]     5. Let's expand this dot product:     [     (vec{a} + vec{b}) cdot (vec{b} + vec{c}) = vec{a} cdot vec{b} + vec{a} cdot vec{c} + vec{b} cdot vec{b} + vec{b} cdot vec{c}     ]     6. Since vec{b} is a unit vector:     [     vec{b} cdot vec{b} = 1     ] 7. Therefore, the dot product simplifies to:     [     vec{a} cdot vec{b} + vec{a} cdot vec{c} + 1 + vec{b} cdot vec{c} = 0     ] 8. Rearranging terms:     [     vec{a} cdot vec{b} + vec{a} cdot vec{c} + vec{b} cdot vec{c} = -1     ] 9. Following a similar approach, assume bisectors along other combinations. Consider bisectors along (vec{a} + vec{c}) and (vec{b} + vec{c}). Their perpendicularity implies:     [     (vec{a} + vec{c}) cdot (vec{b} + vec{c}) = 0     ] 10. Expanding this:     [     vec{a} cdot vec{b} + vec{a} cdot vec{c} + vec{c} cdot vec{b} + vec{c} cdot vec{c} = 0     ] 11. Since vec{c} is also a unit vector:     [     vec{c} cdot vec{c} = 1     ] 12. So the equation simplifies to:     [     vec{a} cdot vec{b} + vec{a} cdot vec{c} + vec{b} cdot vec{c} + 1 = 0     ]     which turns out to be consistent with the previous condition. 13. Lastly, consider the relationship among the vectors (vec{a} + vec{b}), (vec{b} + vec{c}), and (vec{a} + vec{c}). Given that these represent mutually perpendicular bisectors:     [     begin{aligned}        &(vec{a} + vec{b}) perp (vec{b} + vec{c})         &(vec{b} + vec{c}) perp (vec{a} + vec{c})         &(vec{a} + vec{b}) perp (vec{a} + vec{c})     end{aligned}     ] 14.

When the students are arranged in rows of 5, there is 1 student left in the last row. This means that n leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. Mathematically, this can be expressed as n equiv 1 pmod{5}. To find a number that satisfies both conditions and is less than 40, we start by addressing the first condition. We need to find a number that is 3 more than a multiple of 7. The smallest such number is 3 itself, but it does not satisfy the second condition. So, we add multiples of 7 to 3 and check each result against the second condition: - 3 + 7 = 10, which does not leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. - 3 + 2cdot7 = 17, which also does not leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. - 3 + 3cdot7 = 24, which again does not leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. - 3 + 4cdot7 = 31, which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. Therefore, 31 is the number that satisfies both conditions. According to the Chinese remainder theorem, other solutions would be of the form 31 + kcdot(7cdot5), where k is an integer.

Similarly, considering the proportional relationships and symmetrical properties of parallelograms and parallel translations, it can be shown that the other diagonal (PR) is parallel to side (AB). # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the diagonals of quadrilateral (PQRS) are parallel to the sides of the parallelograms (ABCD) and (A_1B_1C_1D_1).

We are given that the percent of the total number of seeds that germinated is 31%, so we can set up the following equation: [ frac{0.25x + 80}{x + 200} = 0.31 ] Now, we solve for ( x ): [ 0.25x + 80 = 0.31(x + 200) ] [ 0.25x + 80 = 0.31x + 62 ] Subtract ( 0.25x ) from both sides: [ 80 = 0.06x + 62 ] Subtract 62 from both sides: [ 18 = 0.06x ] Divide both sides by 0.06: [ x = frac{18}{0.06} ] [ x = 300 ] So, boxed{300}  seeds were planted in the first plot."},{"instruction":"base 8, a perfect square is given by a72c, where a is not zero.

Prove that the country can be divided into ( N + 2 ) regions such that no two cities in the same region are connected by a road.","output":"1. **Convert the problem into graph theory terms**: Consider a graph ( G ) with vertices representing the cities and edges representing the roads between them. From the problem's condition, it follows that in this graph, each vertex lies on no more than ( N ) different non-overlapping cycles of odd length. 2. **Transform the initial problem into a coloring problem**: We aim to prove that the vertices of such a graph can be colored using ( N + 2 ) colors such that no two vertices of the same color are joined by an edge. 3. **Base case for induction**: The base case concerns a graph with a single vertex. Trivially, a single vertex can be colored with any color since there are no edges. This is true since no edges mean no conflict between vertices of the same color. 4. **Inductive step**: Assume that any graph with fewer than ( k ) vertices can be colored with ( N + 2 ) colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 5. **Consider the graph ( G ) with ( k ) vertices**: According to the inductive hypothesis, if we remove any vertex ( A ) along with its adjacent edges from ( G ), the resulting graph ( H ) with ( k-1 ) vertices can be colored with ( N + 2 ) colors so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 6. **Restoring vertex ( A )**: After coloring ( H ), reintroduce vertex ( A ) and its edges. We will attempt to color ( A ) without violating the coloring rule. 7. **Coloring rule maintaining**: We analyze each color from ( 2 ) to ( N+2 ) (since ( k = 1 ) color is always available from ( N+2 ) colors). We construct ( H_{1k} ) for each ( k ) (these are subgraphs consisting of vertices colored 1 and ( k ) and edges between them). 8. **Odd cycle-free subgraphs**: Because the vertices of ( H ) are already colored without forming odd cycles, ( H_{1k} ) must also be odd cycle-free. Thus, ( G_{1k} ) (constructed by adding ( A ) and its edges back to ( H_{1k} )) remains cycle-free if there are no new odd cycles formed through ( A ). 9. **Contradiction if all attempts fail**: If through each ( k ) there remains at least one odd cycle involving ( A ), ( A ) is directly involved in forming more than ( N ) odd cycles, which contradicts the problem assumption since no vertex lies on more than ( N ) odd cycles. 10. **Conclusion with proper coloring**: Because the contradiction cannot exist, there must be at least one valid coloring for ( A ) using the ( N + 2 ) colors such that coloring rules in ( G ) are preserved, completing the induction.

Show intersection points form circumcircle:** - The perpendiculars from ( A ) to ( CD ) and ( DE ) project points ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ), respectively.  - ( Delta AA_1A_2 ) can therefore be inscribed in a circle with diameter ( AD ). **6. Repeat the process for other diagonal pairs:** - Similarly, consider the other diagonals and pairs of heights.  - This process will yield equal segments ( AD = BE = CF ) such that the diagonals form an isosceles triangle with the perpendiculars intersecting at the same point. **7.

Since points O, A, and B are in plane AOB and ∠AOB = 90°, we know that OA is perpendicular to OB. We also know that OC makes 60° angles with both OA and OB. Let's construct a perpendicular from point C to the plane AOB, and let's call the foot of the perpendicular point D. Now we have a right triangle OCD where line OD is perpendicular to the plane AOB. Since ∠AOC and ∠BOC are both 60°, by the properties of equal angles being subtended by equal chords in a circle, the perpendicular OD bisects the 90° angle ∠AOB, creating two 45° angles, ∠AOD and ∠BOD. In ΔCOD where ∠COD = 90°, we can deduce that both ∠CDO and ∠CDO are each 45°, forming an isosceles right triangle. Therefore, the right angle triangle OCD formed is also a 45°-45°-90° triangle.

This means the segments A_1A_2, A_1A_3, and A_1A_4 are all red. 3. **Checking for a Monochromatic Triangle:**    - We now consider the segments between A_2, A_3, and A_4.    - There are three segments between these points: A_2A_3, A_2A_4, and A_3A_4.    - If any one of these segments is red, suppose A_2A_3 is red, then the triangle A_1A_2A_3 is entirely red and hence monochromatic.    - If none of the segments A_2A_3, A_2A_4, and A_3A_4 are red, they must all be blue. This forms a blue triangle A_2A_3A_4. 4. **Conclusion:**    In either scenario, we have found a monochromatic triangle:    - If any of the segments A_2A_3, A_2A_4, or A_3A_4 is red, we have a red triangle involving A_1.    - If all segments A_2A_3, A_2A_4, A_3A_4 are blue, we have a blue triangle.

Both D and E lie on the circumcircle omega of triangle AB_1C_1. 3. **Apply Brokard's Theorem**: According to Brokard's Theorem, the polar of the intersection of diagonals DE with respect to omega is the line BC.

The probability of the next card being red (successful outcome) is     [    frac{r}{r+b}.    ] 3. **Consider a Modified Strategy**: Let’s change the rule and say “Stop” after the next card, calling this the \\"+1 rule\\". 4. **Remaining Cards Analysis**:     - If the next card is red, then the remaining deck will have r-1 red and b black cards with probability (frac{r}{r+b}).    - If the next card is black, then the remaining deck will have r red and b-1 black cards with probability (frac{b}{r+b}). 5. **Probability Calculation for \\"+1 Rule\\"**:    [    text{Probability of success with \\"+1 rule\\"} = frac{r}{r+b} cdot frac{r-1}{r+b-1} + frac{b}{r+b} cdot frac{r}{r+b-1}    ] 6. **Simplify the Expression**:    [    frac{r}{r+b} cdot frac{r-1}{r+b-1} + frac{b}{r+b} cdot frac{r}{r+b-1} = frac{r(r-1) + br}{(r+b)(r+b-1)} = frac{r(r+b-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)} = frac{r}{r+b}    ]    This shows that changing the strategy to the \\"+1 rule\\" does not change the probability of winning. 7. **Generalize the Result**: Extending this reasoning to \\"+2\\" or \\"+3\\" and so on, we observe that the probability remains unchanged. 8. **Final Conclusion**: The probability of successfully selecting a red card does not depend on the previously revealed cards beyond ensuring the probabilities at each stage (as reshuffling probabilities remain consistent). 9. **Implication**: Regardless of the chosen strategy, the winning probability at any step can be reduced to calculating based on the last card:    [    text{Probability of last card being red} = frac{r}{r+b},    ]    which is inherently 0.5 for a well-shuffled deck with equal counts.

Therefore, we have the ratio of corresponding sides: [ frac{AD}{DO} = frac{AC}{CB} ] Consider point N which is the midpoint of segment overline{DO}, and M which is the midpoint of overline{BC}.

Then, quadrilateral ABCD' is inscribed by construction, and per our previous argument, quadrilateral ABMN' is also inscribed. Since both N and N' lie on the circumcircle of triangle ABM and the line overline{BD}, they must coincide. Therefore, points D and D' must also coincide, meaning quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed. We can now reassert that quadrilateral ABCD exhibits the property of being cyclic because if its diagonal overline{AC} bisects angle BAD and ABMN is inscribed, then both conditions imply each other.

Since ( TM ) is perpendicular to ( m ), and ( m ) is tangent to the circle at ( T ), any radius drawn to the tangent point ( T ) will also be perpendicular to ( m ). Hence, ( OT perp m ). 3. **Use symmetry properties:**    Given that ( A' ) is symmetric to ( A ) with respect to ( M ), the coordinates of ( A' ) can be represented as the mirror image of ( A ) with respect to ( M ).

The total number of lines (sides or diagonals) formed by joining any two vertices is binom{9}{2} = 36. 3. A pair of lines will intersect inside the nonagon only if the endpoints of the lines form a convex quadrilateral. This occurs if no two lines are adjacent sides and neither line is a side of the polygon. Given this, we need to select 4 different vertices from the 9 available. 4. Number of ways to select any 4 vertices from 9 is binom{9}{4} = 126. However, this counts all four-point selections, including those where lines might not intersect within the polygon due to adjacencies. 5. We need to subtract the cases where the quadrilateral is not convex or formed by adjacent sides:    - There are 9 sets of 4 vertices that include two pairs of adjacent vertices (since nonagon is cyclic, any choice like 1234, 2345, ..., 7891 falls in this category).    - Each of these non-intersecting sets prevents the adequate count of quadrilaterals where diagonals would intersect inside. 6. Thus, subtracting these 9 cases from 126 gives us the count of valid, intersecting sets: 126 - 9 = 117. 7. To find the number of total pairs of lines that could be chosen (including non-intersecting pairs, and those that include polygon sides), we simply calculate binom{36}{2} = 630. 8.

Observe that both (x^{3}) and (y^{3}) must be powers of 2 because their sum is a power of 2.    If either (x) or (y) is odd, the cube of an odd number will be odd, and their sum would not be even, contradicting the fact that (2^{30}) is even. Therefore, both (x) and (y) must be even. 2. **Step 2: Factorize (x^{3} + y^{3} = 2^{30})**    Use the factorization formula for sums of cubes:    [    x^{3} + y^{3} = (x + y)(x^{2} - xy + y^{2})    ]    For this to be a power of 2, both (x+y) and (x^{2}-xy+y^{2}) must be powers of 2 because the only factors of a power of 2 are other powers of 2. 3. **Step 3: Consider the implications of the factorization:**    Suppose:     [    x^{3} + y^{3} = (x + y)(x^{2} - xy + y^{2}) = 2^{n}, quad n geq 2    ]        If (x + y = 2^a) and (x^{2} - xy + y^{2} = 2^b), then (a + b = 30). 4. **Step 4: Solve (x^2 - xy + y^2 = 2^b):**    Consider (x^2 - xy + y^2):    - To have (x^{2} - xy + y^{2} = 2^b) be a power of 2, with (x) and (y) being even, imply that (2^b) must be minimal, i.e., ( b = 0 ) or ( b = 1 ). 5. **Step 5: Reduce the problem with even (x) and (y):**    Since (x) and (y) are both even, let (x = 2^k u) and (y = 2^k v) where (u) and (v) are integers.    Substitute back into the original equation:    [    (2^k u)^3 + (2^k v)^3 = 2^{3k}(u^3 + v^3) = 2^{30}    ]    Hence:    [    2^{3k}(u^3 + v^3) = 2^{30}    ]    This implies:    [    3k + log_{2} (u^3 + v^3) = 30    ]        Therefore:    [    3k + log_{2} (u^3 + v^3) = 30    ]    So (u^3 + v^3) must equal 1, implying (3k = 30), thus (k = 10). 6. **Step 6: Conclude the values of (u^3 + v^3):**    Since (3k = 30) and thus (k = 10),      (u) and (v) must be minimal integers to satisfy (u^3 + v^3 = 1), so the pairs ((u, v)) are ((1, 0)) or ((0, 1)).

Given the symmetry of a regular ( n )-gon, when all vectors are rotated by an angle ( frac{2 pi}{n} ), their sum remains unchanged.

Denoting the actual number of such primes by P, the probability:      [      frac{P}{1201}      ] Knowing that very few integers are prime, especially among numbers not starting from a small range of digits, and that finding the exact count of primes fitting the criteria manually is impractical, we conclude that P could be a small number, and hence, the probability would also be small. Conclusion: The hypothetical answer can't be accurately given without computational help to find P, but the structure of this solution holds pending the value of P. The solution lets us form the probability, frac{P{1201}}, but P is the unknown requiring computational checking. The final answer is Given the choices, since boxed{P} is assumed small, boxed{textbf{(A)} frac{1}{1201}} might be a possible estimate."},{"instruction":"a bag for a bingo game, there are 90 barrels numbered from 1 to 90.

Hence, the commutative law holds for the operation \\"otimes\\". **Associative Law:** We need to check if (aotimes b)otimes c = aotimes (botimes c) for all real numbers a, b, and c. - First, calculate (aotimes b)otimes c = (ab + a + b)otimes c = (ab + a + b)c + (ab + a + b) + c = abc + ac + bc + ab + a + b + c. - Next, calculate aotimes (botimes c) = aotimes (bc + b + c) = a(bc + b + c) + a + (bc + b + c) = abc + ab + ac + a + bc + b + c. - Comparing the two expressions, we see that (aotimes b)otimes c neq aotimes (botimes c), indicating that the associative law does not hold. **Distributive Law:** We need to check if (a+b)otimes c = aotimes c + botimes c for all real numbers a, b, and c. - First, calculate (a+b)otimes c = (a+b)c + (a+b) + c = ac + bc + a + b + c. - Next, calculate aotimes c + botimes c = (ac + a + c) + (bc + b + c) = ac + a + c + bc + b + c. - Rearranging the terms, we get ac + bc + a + b + 2c. - Since ac + bc + a + b + c neq ac + bc + a + b + 2c, the distributive law does not hold for the operation \\"otimes\\".

Assume that there exists ( c ) such that ( c = d^2 ) and ( a, b, ) and ( c ) form the sides of a triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, the following inequalities must hold:    [    a + b > c, quad b + c > a, quad text{and} quad a + c > b    ] 3.

The line AF is parallel to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola C. What is the value of the real number b? A: 2 B: 4 C: 8 D: 16","output":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, following the given solution closely: 1. **Identify the Focus of the Parabola**: The given parabola is x^{2}=8y. The standard form of a parabola with its vertex at the origin is x^{2}=4py, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Comparing this with the given parabola, we have 4p=8, which means p=2. Therefore, the focus of the parabola, denoted as point F, is at (0,p)=(0,2). 2. **Determine the Left Vertex of the Hyperbola**: The hyperbola is given by frac{{x}^{2}}{8}-frac{{y}^{2}}{b}=1. The standard form of a horizontal hyperbola is frac{{x}^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{{y}^{2}}{b^{2}}=1, where 2a is the distance between the vertices. Comparing the given equation with the standard form, we find a^{2}=8, so a=2sqrt{2}. The left vertex of the hyperbola, denoted as point A, is at (-a,0)=(-2sqrt{2},0). 3. **Equation of the Asymptotes**: The asymptotes of a hyperbola given by frac{{x}^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{{y}^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 are y=pm frac{b}{a}x. Substituting a=2sqrt{2} into this formula, we get the equation of the asymptotes as y=pm frac{sqrt{b}}{2sqrt{2}}x. 4. **Parallel Condition**: Since the line AF is parallel to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola, the slope of line AF must equal the slope of the asymptote. The slope of line AF can be calculated using the coordinates of A and F: frac{2-0}{0-(-2sqrt{2})}=frac{2}{2sqrt{2}}=frac{1}{sqrt{2}}. Setting this equal to the slope of the asymptote gives us frac{1}{sqrt{2}}=frac{sqrt{b}}{2sqrt{2}}. 5. **Solve for b**: Solving the equation frac{1}{sqrt{2}}=frac{sqrt{b}}{2sqrt{2}} for b, we multiply both sides by 2sqrt{2} to get sqrt{b}=2. Squaring both sides gives us b=4.

How many gallons does the tank hold?","output":"Let's denote the total capacity of the tank as T gallons. If the tank is already filled to 3/4 of its capacity, then the amount of gasoline in the tank before adding the 5 gallons is (3/4)T. After adding 5 gallons, the tank is filled to 9/10 of its capacity, so the amount of gasoline in the tank is (9/10)T. The difference between (9/10)T and (3/4)T is the 5 gallons that were added. So we can set up the following equation: (9/10)T - (3/4)T = 5 To solve for T, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 10 and 4 is 20. We can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator: (18/20)T - (15/20)T = 5 Now, subtract the fractions: (18/20)T - (15/20)T = (3/20)T So we have: (3/20)T = 5 To find T, we divide both sides of the equation by (3/20): T = 5 / (3/20) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: T = 5 * (20/3) T = 100/3 T = 33.333... gallons Since we're dealing with a physical tank, it's reasonable to round to the nearest whole number if necessary.

If the cistern is full, how much time would it take for the cistern to empty?","output":"Let's denote the rate at which the cistern fills without the leak as ( frac{1}{12} ) of the cistern per hour. This means that in one hour, the cistern fills ( frac{1}{12} ) of its capacity. When there is a leak, it takes 14 hours to fill the cistern. This means the combined rate of filling and leaking is ( frac{1}{14} ) of the cistern per hour. Now, let's denote the rate at which the cistern leaks as ( L ) (in cisterns per hour). We can set up the following equation to represent the situation: [ frac{1}{12} - L = frac{1}{14} ] To find ( L ), we solve for it: [ L = frac{1}{12} - frac{1}{14} ] To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 * 14 = 168. So we convert the fractions: [ L = frac{14}{168} - frac{12}{168} ] [ L = frac{2}{168} ] [ L = frac{1}{84} ] This means the leak empties the cistern at a rate of ( frac{1}{84} ) of the cistern per hour.

The conversion factor between km/hr and m/s is: 1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, to convert 144 km/hr to m/s: 144 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 40 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes to cross the electric pole. Since the electric pole is essentially a point compared to the length of the train, the time it takes to cross the pole is the time it takes for the entire length of the train to pass by the pole. The formula to calculate the time (t) is: t = distance / speed The distance in this case is the length of the train, which is 350 meters, and the speed is 40 m/s. t = 350 m / 40 m/s = 8.75 seconds Therefore, it will take the train boxed{8.75}  seconds to cross the electric pole."},{"instruction":"A certain manufacturer promises that during a promotional period, 3 empty cans of their brand of cola can be exchanged for 1 can of cola.

Therefore, statement ② is correct. **Statement ③ Analysis:** - From the analysis above, it's clear that for every 2 extra cans of cola purchased, you can actually drink 1 more can of cola. This is because:   - If you buy an odd number of cans, there is 1 empty can left.   - If you buy an even number of cans, there are 2 empty cans left. - This means the actual number of cans of cola consumed is 0.5 or 1 less than 1.5 times the number of cans purchased. - Therefore, the formula f(n) = n + left[frac{n-1}{2}right] correctly represents the maximum number of cans of cola that can actually be consumed, where n is the number of cans bought and left[xright] represents the largest integer not greater than x. - This confirms that statement ③ is also correct. **Conclusion:** - The incorrect statement is ①, while statements ② and ③ are correct.

Therefore, we can write:    [    Delta = left(frac{p}{q}right)^2    ]    where (p) and (q) are integers, and (q neq 0). 2. Since (Delta = a^2 - 4b) is an integer (because (a) and (b) are integers), it follows that:    [    a^2 - 4b = frac{p^2}{q^2}    ]    For (frac{p^2}{q^2}) to be an integer, (q^2) must divide (p^2).

Given that (gcd(x, y) = 1), the only way (frac{x^2}{y^2}) can be an integer is if (y = 1). Therefore:    [    frac{x^2}{1^2} = x^2    ]    is an integer. 5. Since (y = 1), it follows that (q = d) and (p = dx). This means (q) divides (p), i.e., (q mid p). 6. Since (q mid p), (frac{p}{q}) is an integer.

The total number of workers is the sum of technicians, supervisors, and laborers: Total workers = 6 (technicians) + S (supervisors) + L (laborers).

Divide both sides by Rs. 9000 to find the total number of workers: (6 + S + L) = Rs. 342000 / Rs. 9000, (6 + S + L) = 38.

First, consider ( b^2 + 1 ):    - Suppose ( b^2 + 1 ) is a perfect square. Let ( b^2 + 1 = k^2 ) for some integer ( k ).    - Then, ( k^2 - b^2 = 1 ), which implies ( (k - b)(k + b) = 1 ).    - The only integer solutions to this equation are ( k - b = 1 ) and ( k + b = 1 ), which is impossible since ( k ) and ( b ) are both positive integers.    - Therefore, ( b^2 + 1 ) is not a perfect square. 6. Next, consider ( a^2 - a - b^2 ):    - Suppose ( a^2 - a - b^2 = c^2 ) for some integer ( c ).    - Since ( a ) and ( b ) have the same parity, let ( a = 2m ) and ( b = 2n ) for integers ( m ) and ( n ).    - Then, ( a^2 - a - b^2 = (2m)^2 - 2m - (2n)^2 = 4m^2 - 2m - 4n^2 ).    - This simplifies to ( 4(m^2 - n^2) - 2m = c^2 ). 7. Consider the expression ( 4xy - x - y ):    - Let ( x = m ) and ( y = n ). Then, ( 4mn - m - n ) is not a perfect square.    - Suppose otherwise, that ( 4mn - m - n = z^2 ) for some integer ( z ).    - Then, ( 16mn - 4m - 4n = (2z)^2 ).    - Adding 1 to both sides, we get ( 16mn - 4m - 4n + 1 = (2z)^2 + 1 ).    - This implies ( (4m - 1)(4n - 1) = (2z)^2 + 1 ). 8. Consider a prime ( p equiv 3 pmod{4} ) that divides ( 4m - 1 ):    - Then, ( p ) divides ( (2z)^2 + 1 ).    - This implies ( (2z)^2 equiv -1 pmod{p} ).    - By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( (2z)^{p-1} equiv (-1)^{frac{p-1}{2}} pmod{p} ).    - Since ( p equiv 3 pmod{4} ), ( frac{p-1}{2} ) is odd, so ( (-1)^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv -1 pmod{p} ).    - This implies ( 1 equiv -1 pmod{p} ), which is a contradiction.    - Therefore, ( 4mn - m - n ) is not a perfect square. 9. Applying this lemma to our expression ( 4(m^2 - n^2) - 2m ):    - Since ( 4(m^2 - n^2) - 2m ) is not a perfect square, ( a^2 - a - b^2 ) is not a perfect square. 10.

We start by establishing that triangle M_{1} M_{2} M_{3} and triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} are similar. This will lead us to conclude that the lines M_{1}S_{1}, M_{2}S_{2}, and M_{3}S_{3} are concurrent. 2. Note that triangle M_{1} M_{2} M_{3} is similar to triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} because M_{i} are the midpoints of the sides a_i of triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}. Thus, M_{1} M_{2} parallel A_{1} A_{2}, M_{2} M_{3} parallel A_{2} A_{3}, and M_{3} M_{1} parallel A_{3} A_{1} with frac{M_{1}M_{2}}{A_{1}A_{2}} = frac{1}{2}. 3. Next, we consider triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} and triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}. We know that T_{i} are points where the incircle touches a_{i}, and S_{i} are the reflections of T_{i} over the angle bisectors A_{i}I. 4. In triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}, the angle bisectors A_{i}I intersect the opposite sides at points B_{i}. These bisectors divide angles as follows:  angle T_{1} I T_{3} = 180^{circ} - angle A_{2},   angle T_{3} B_{3} A_{3} = angle A_{2} + frac{1}{2} angle A_{3},   angle T_{3} I B_{3} = 90^{circ} - left(angle A_{2} + frac{1}{2} angle A_{3}right),   angle T_{3} I S_{3} = 2 angle T_{3} I B_{3} = 180^{circ} - 2 angle A_{2} - angle A_{3}.  5. Thus,   angle S_{3} I T_{1} = angle T_{3} I T_{1} - angle T_{3} I S_{3} = angle A_{2} + angle A_{3}.  6. It similarly holds that   angle S_{2} I T_{1} = angle A_{2} + angle A_{3}.  7. Therefore, the line segments S_{2}S_{3} are parallel to A_{2}A_{3}. Similarly, we have:  S_{3} S_{1} parallel A_{3} A_{1}, quad S_{1} S_{2} parallel A_{1} A_{2}. 8. Combining these equalities, we observe that each corresponding side of  triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} and  triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} are parallel, thus confirming their similarity. 9. Since  triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} and  triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} are similar with equal corresponding angles and proportional sides,  triangle S_{1} S_{2} S_{3} is also centrally symmetric about point I, the incenter of triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}.  10. Therefore, lines M_{i}S_{i} (where M_{i} is the midpoint and S_{i} is the reflection of T_{i}) must be concurrent.

We are given that the circle with diameter (KC) intersects segment (CD) at point (P (P neq C)). Our task is to show that the lines (MP) and (AD) are perpendicular.\\r \\r 1. **Identifying the Circle and Points:**    - Let (omega) be the circle with diameter (KC).    - The midpoint (M) of (BC) guarantees that (KM) is perpendicular to (BC). Hence, (angle CMK) is a right angle ((90^circ)). 2. **Locating (M) on Circle (omega):**    - Since (omega) has (KC) as the diameter, and (angle CMK = 90^circ), point (M) lies on (omega). 3. **Angles Subtended by Arc (CM):**    - (angle CKM) intercepts arc (CM) on (omega), so any angle subtended by this arc on (omega) will be equal.     - Thus, (angle CPM = angle CKM = alpha). Here, ( alpha ) represents these equal angles. 4. **Introduction of Intersection Point (T):**    - Let (T) be the point of intersection of the lines (AD) and (MP). 5. **Angles in the Configuration:**    - To prove that (MP) and (AD) are perpendicular, we need to prove that (angle PDT + alpha = frac{pi}{2}). 6. **Understanding Angle Relationships:**    - Given (angle PDT = beta), the cyclic nature of quadrilateral (ABCD) implies (angle PDC = beta). Therefore, (angle ABD) (which is opposite (angle PDC) in the cyclic quadrilateral) equals (pi - beta). Since (ABCD) is cyclic, the angles (angle BKC = angle BAD = beta). 7. **Symmetrical Property around Midpoint (M):**    - Due to (KM) being the midpoint perpendicular to (BC), it follows that (angle KCM = angle KBM = beta). 8. **Summarizing the Angles:**    - In the right triangle (KMC), we have (alpha + beta = frac{pi}{2}). Therefore, (alpha + angle PDT = frac{pi}{2}). 9. **Conclusion:**    - Since (alpha + angle PDT = frac{pi}{2}), the line (MP) is perpendicular to the line (AD).

Initially, the equation is frac{w}{c} = frac{1}{3}. Cross multiplying, we have w = frac{c}{3}. After five liters of water are added, the new equation is frac{w + 5}{c} = frac{2}{5}. Cross multiplying, we get 5(w + 5) = 2c. Substituting the expression for w from the initial state, we get 5(frac{c}{3} + 5) = 2c. Expanding and simplifying,  5(frac{c}{3} + 5) = 2c   frac{5c}{3} + 25 = 2c   25 = 2c - frac{5c}{3}   25 = frac{6c - 5c}{3}   25 = frac{c}{3}   c = 75.

The total runs scored after 11 innings is now 10A + 95. The new average (A + 5) is calculated by dividing the total runs by the number of innings (11): New average (A + 5) = (10A + 95) / 11 Now, we can solve for A: 11(A + 5) = 10A + 95 11A + 55 = 10A + 95 11A - 10A = 95 - 55 A = 40 So, the average before the 11th inning was 40 runs.

Subtract k(С), k(О), and 2k(Т) from both sides: [ 0 geq k(П) + k(Я) + k(Ь) ] Given that k(x) represents non-negative integers (as each code is a single digit from 0 to 9), for this inequality to hold true, it must be that: [ k(П) = k(Я) = k(Ь) = 0 ] Thus, the values for k(П), k(Я), and k(Ь) must be 0 to satisfy the given condition. 3. The elementary codes of the remaining letters k(С) and k(О) can be any digit from 0 to 9. Hence, for k(С) and k(О), there are (10) possible choices each. Therefore, there are a total of: [ 10 times 10 = 100 ] ways to code the letters О, П, С, Т, Ь, Я under the given condition. 4.

This means they would yield identical sums, making it impossible to uniquely decode a word based on its weight alone. # Conclusion: There are exactly ( boxed{100} ) ways to encode the letters under the given conditions, however, it does not allow for unique decoding of the original word from its coded weight."},{"instruction":"A store sells pencils and erasers.

The total revenue from selling 20 pencils and 40 erasers is 80. The cost of 2 erasers is half the price of a pencil. Let's denote the price of a pencil as P. Therefore, the price of an eraser is frac{1}{2}P. 3. The total revenue can be calculated as the sum of the revenue from pencils and erasers. Therefore, we have:    [    20P + 40 times frac{1}{2}P = 80    ] 4. Simplifying the equation, we get:    [    20P + 20P = 80    ]    [    40P = 80    ] 5.

According to the information given, the average weight of the group after the new person joins is 3.7 kg more than the average weight after the person weighing 90 kg left.

Define (u = x + y) and (v = x - y). Then,    [    k = frac{u^2 + 5v^2}{2}    ]    This transformation helps us analyze the properties of (k). 2. **Consider any prime (p) dividing (k):**    Since ((k, 30) = 1), it follows that (p ge 7). If (p) divides both (u) and (v), then (k ge 3p^2 ge 147). We assume (p nmid u) and (p nmid v). 3. **Analyze the quadratic residue ((-5/p)):**    We need to consider the cases based on the value of (p mod 4).    **Case 1: (p equiv 1 pmod{4})**    - Here, ((-1/p) = 1), so ((5/p) = 1).    - By quadratic reciprocity, ((5/p)(p/5) = 1), which implies ((p/5) = 1).    - Since (p neq 5), it follows that (p equiv pm 1 pmod{4}).

This yields (p equiv 7 pmod{20}) or (p equiv 3 pmod{20}). 4. **Combine the cases:**    Combining the results from both cases, we find that (p in {1, 3, 7, 9} pmod{20}) for any prime (p) dividing (k = 3x^2 - 4xy + 3y^2 = frac{u^2 + 5v^2}{2}). 5. **Find the smallest such prime (p):**    The smallest prime (p) in the set ({1, 3, 7, 9} pmod{20}) is (23).

Thus, (k = 23). 7. **Check divisibility:**    For ((x, y) = (2, -1)), we have (k = 23). If (n equiv 0 pmod{3}), then (k mid 2^n + 15), concluding the proof.

We need to prove that the midpoints ( P, Q, ) and ( R ) of the segments ( BC, DE, ) and ( FA ) respectively form an equilateral triangle. 1. We start by setting up the circle with center at the origin and radius ( 1 ). In a complex plane representation, the coordinates of the vertices can be described using exponential functions based on their angular positions. 2. Let the vertices be denoted as:     [     A = 1, quad B = A e^{i frac{pi}{3}} = e^{i frac{pi}{3}}, quad C = e^{i frac{2pi}{3}}, quad D=C e^{i frac{pi}{3}}= e^{i pi}, quad E = e^{ifrac{4pi}{3}}, quad F = e^{i frac{5pi}{3}}     ] 3.

Next, we need to verify that the triangle ( PQR ) is equilateral. We begin by calculating the vectors ( overrightarrow{PQ} ) and ( overrightarrow{QR} ):     [     overrightarrow{PQ} = Q - P = frac{e^{i pi} + e^{i frac{4pi}{3}}}{2} - frac{e^{i frac{pi}{3}} + e^{i frac{2pi}{3}}}{2}     ] 5. Simplify ( overrightarrow{PQ} ):     [     overrightarrow{PQ} = frac{1}{2} left( e^{i pi} + e^{i frac{4pi}{3}} - e^{i frac{pi}{3}} - e^{i frac{2pi}{3}} right)     ] 6.

To prove that ( triangle PQR ) is equilateral, we show that ( overrightarrow{QR} ) is a rotation of ( overrightarrow{PQ} ) by ( 120^circ ) (i.e., multiplication by ( e^{i frac{2pi}{3}} )).     Let's check:     [     overrightarrow{QR} e^{i frac{2pi}{3}} = frac{1}{2} left( (1 + e^{i frac{5pi}{3}} - e^{i pi} - e^{i frac{4pi}{3}}) e^{i frac{2pi}{3}} right)     ] 9.

To ensure g(x) is strictly increasing on (0, +infty), we compute its derivative: g'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( x^{2} + frac{h}{x} right) = 2x - frac{h}{x^{2}}. Setting g'(x) geq 0 for the function to be strictly increasing, we get: 2x^{3} - h geq 0 Rightarrow h leq 2x^{3}. Since this must hold for all x > 0, and considering F(x) = 2x^{3} is increasing for x > 0, the maximum value of h is approached as x approaches 0, which gives h leq 0. Thus, the range of h is: boxed{(-infty, 0]}.  Part (2) Given f(x) in M_{1}, and f(a) = f(b) = d with b > a > 0, we analyze the implications.

Rearranging gives: d left( frac{1}{b} - frac{1}{a} right) > 0 Rightarrow d frac{a - b}{ab} < 0. Given b > a, we conclude d < 0. To prove f(a+b) > 2d, we note: frac{f(a+b)}{a+b} > frac{d}{b} Rightarrow f(a+b) > d frac{a+b}{b}. Since a+b < 2b, we have frac{a+b}{b} < 2, and thus: f(a+b) > d frac{a+b}{b} > 2d.

If f(x) = 0 for any x, g(x) = 0, contradicting strict increase. Thus, f(x) cannot be constantly 0. If f(x) has zero points, it contradicts the strict increase of g(x). Therefore, f(x) does not have zero points, implying there exists x_{0} > 0 such that f(x_{0}) < 0. For f(x) < 0 to hold for any x in (0, +infty), we consider the behavior of g(x) as x to +infty, which tends to 0.

Is it always possible to find a group of 4 clans, each of which is in conflict with every other clan in the group? To determine whether there is always a group of 4 clans that are mutually antagonistic (each clan in the group is in conflict with every other clan in the group), we can utilize the properties of graph theory. 1. **Restate the Problem in Graph-Theoretical Terms**:    - Represent each clan as a vertex in a graph.    - Draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding clans are in conflict.    - We need to demonstrate whether this graph must always contain a complete subgraph K_4 (i.e., a set of 4 vertices each connected to each other). 2. **Analyze Degree of Vertices**:    - According to the problem, each clan is in conflict with at least 14 other clans.    - In graph terminology, each vertex has a degree of at least 14. 3. **Apply Turán's Theorem**:    - Turán’s theorem states that if a graph has ( n ) vertices and more than      [      left(1 - frac{1}{k-1}right) frac{n^2}{2}      ]      edges, then it must contain a complete subgraph ( K_k ).    - Here, ( k = 4 ) and ( n = 20 ).    - Substitute these values into the Turán’s theorem inequality:      [      e > left(1 - frac{1}{3}right) frac{20^2}{2} = frac{2}{3} cdot 200 = frac{400}{3} approx 133.33      ]      Therefore, if our graph has more than 133 edges, it must contain a ( K_4 ). 4. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Edges**:    - Each vertex has a degree of at least 14.    - The sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least ( 20 times 14 = 280 ), considering each edge is counted twice, so the number of edges ( e ) is given by:      [      2e geq 280 implies e geq 140      ]    - The number of edges is 140 which is greater than 133.33. 5. **Conclusion**:    - By Turán's theorem, a graph with 20 vertices and at least 140 edges must contain a complete subgraph ( K_4 ).    - Hence, there is definitely a set of 4 clans, each in conflict with each other.

We will start by establishing the correspondence between these points and complex numbers so that the point (O) coincides with the origin of the complex plane. 1. **Establish the Complex Number Correspondence:**    - Let ( O ) be the origin, thus ( O = 0 ).    - The vertices of the polygon ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) are represented as complex numbers on the unit circle. 2. **Determine the Position of ( B_j ) and ( C_j ):**    - Given the properties of the polygon and the construction of the external squares, the points ( B_j ) and ( C_j ) are related to the adjacent vertices of the polygon:      - ( B_j ) is derived by rotating ( A_{j+1} ) about ( A_j ) by 90 degrees clockwise, which can be represented in complex numbers using multiplication by (-i):        [        B_j - A_j = -i (A_{j+1} - A_j)        ]      - Similarly, ( C_j ) is derived by rotating ( A_{j-1} ) about ( A_j ) by 90 degrees counterclockwise:        [        C_j - A_j = i (A_j - A_{j-1})        ] 3. **Form of ( B_j ) and ( C_j ):**    - From the above relations:      [      B_j = A_j - i (A_{j+1} - A_j)      ]      [      C_j = A_j - i (A_j - A_{j-1})      ] 4. **Difference of ( B_j ) and ( C_j ):**    - By subtracting the equation of ( C_j ) from ( B_j ):      [      B_j - C_j = left( A_j - i (A_{j+1} - A_j) right) - left( A_j - i (A_j - A_{j-1}) right)      ]    - Simplify the expression:      [      B_j - C_j = -i (A_{j+1} - A_j) + i (A_j - A_{j-1})      ]      [      B_j - C_j = -i (A_{j+1} - 2A_j + A_{j-1})      ] 5. **Use the Property of the Regular Polygon:**    - For a regular ( n )-sided polygon, the following property holds:       [      A_{j-1} + A_{j+1} = 2 cosleft(frac{2pi}{n}right) A_j      ]    - Hence, substituting this into our equation:      [      B_j - C_j = -i left( 2 cosleft(frac{2pi}{n}right) A_j - 2A_j right)      ]      [      B_j - C_j = -2i left( cosleft(frac{2pi}{n}right) - 1 right) A_j      ]      [      B_j - C_j = 2i left( 1 - cosleft(frac{2pi}{n}right) right) A_j      ] 6. **Perpendicularity and Ratio:**    - Recall that a complex number multiplication by ( i ) represents a rotation by ( 90^circ ). Hence, the segment ( B_j C_j ), having its form multiplied by ( i ), ensures the perpendicularity with ( O A_j ) (which coincides with the previous statement since ( O ) is the origin).    - The length of the segment ( B_j C_j ) compared to ( O A_j ) is scaled by the factor ( 2(1 - cos(2pi/n)) ): # Conclusion: [ boxed{B_jC_j text{ and } O A_j text{ are perpendicular, and their ratio is } 2left(1 - cosleft(frac{2pi}{n}right)right).} ]"},{"instruction":"f 6 women take an hour to dig a ditch, then how long should 18 women take to dig a ditch of the same type?","output":"If 6 women take an hour to dig a ditch, then the amount of work done by one woman in one hour is 1/6 of a ditch.

Therefore, g(x) is an increasing function on (0,+infty), Also, since g(1)=-a+2-2a-1=3a+1 > 0, the inequality f(x)leqslant (a-3)x^{2}+(2a-13)x+1 cannot always hold.

Since n is even and of the form 3k + 4, we can deduce that 3k must be even because an even number minus 4 is still even. For 3k to be even, k must be even as well, because the product of an odd number and 3 is always odd. Let's find the smallest and largest even values of k that satisfy the conditions. For the smallest value of k: n = 3k + 4 >= 20 3k >= 16 k >= 16/3 k >= 5.333... Since k must be an even natural number, the smallest even k that satisfies the condition is k = 6.

Now, we need to count the even natural numbers between 6 and 82 inclusive. The even numbers in this range form an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 6, the last term a_n = 82, and the common difference d = 2 (since we are counting even numbers).

However, for simplicity, straight radial lines work effectively in the first division.    - This yields four quarter-circle shaped sectors. 4. **Further Division of Each Quarter:**    - Each of these quarter sectors will now be further divided into 4 equal parts, achieving the total of 4 times 4 = 16 smaller parts.    - Since each quarter sector covers 90 degrees, we need to divide this into smaller angles of 90^circ / 4 = 22.5^circ each.    - Again, drawing radial lines from the center to the boundary will suffice. 5. **Final Shape Confirmation:**    - Ensuring that each of the 16 resulting parts is symmetrical and equal in area is key.    - Each will include 4 smaller cells and will be congruent due to the radial and circular nature of the cuts.   6. **Verification with an Alternate Approach:**    - Another approach could involve curved lines or arcs that ensure uniformity, ensuring each part matches both in area and shape as required.

Comparing f(-2) and f(2), we find that f(-2) = -37 < f(2) = -5, which means the minimum value of the function f(x) on the interval is f(-2) = -37.

This results in (triangle ADC cong triangle FEG) due to the properties of parallelograms and translations. 6. **Parallelism and Congruency**:    Since (AF parallel CG parallel DE) and (CG = DE), by similarity (triangle ADC sim triangle LEN), we have (triangle FEG sim triangle LEN) and (frac{FE}{LE} = frac{CE}{NE}). 7. **Angles and Rotation**:    Given (angle GEF = angle NEL = 90^circ), it follows that (angle GEN = angle LEF). Thus, (triangle FEL) can be obtained from (triangle GEN) by a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation about point (E). 8. **Perpendicularity and Alignment**:    Since (GN perp LF) and (GC perp LQ), it follows that points (G), (C), and (N) all lie on a line perpendicular to (LQ). Hence, (CN parallel AF), which also implies (CN parallel DE). **Conclusion**: (CN) is parallel to the line joining the midpoints of (AB) and (LM). Hence, we've proved the statement. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Given integers a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{m}, b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n} such that a_{i} b_{j}(1 leqslant i leqslant m, 1 leqslant j leqslant n) form a complete residue system modulo mn. Prove that a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{m} form a complete residue system modulo m, and b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n} form a complete residue system modulo n.","output":"1. **Premises and Initial Assumptions:**    Given integers a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{m} and b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}, we are to show that:    - The set { a_{i} b_{j} mid 1 leq i leq m, 1 leq j leq n } forms a complete residue system modulo mn.    - The integers a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{m} form a complete residue system modulo m.    - The integers b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n} form a complete residue system modulo n. 2. **Reduction of Problem:**    Suppose mn mid a_{1} b_{1}. This does not lose generality since we can always multiply any a_i by b_1 or b_j to test their residue classes in modulo mn. 3. **Introduction of Identities:**    Define integers a' and b' such that:    [    a' mid a_{1}, quad b' mid b_{1}, quad text{and} quad a' b' = mn.    ] 4. **Residue Classes Modulo ( a' ):**    No two a_{i} should have the same residue modulo a':    [    text{If } a_i equiv a_k pmod{a'} text{ for } i neq k,    ]    then    [    a' mid (a_i - a_k).    ]    Consequently,    [    a' b_1 mid (a_i b_1 - a_k b_1),    ]    and given that mn mid a' b_1 (where a' b_1 = mn):    [    mn mid (a_i b_1 - a_k b_1),    ]    which leads to a contradiction because a_i and a_k are distinct. 5. **Conclusion on ( a' ):**    Since no two a_i share the same residue, it must be that a' geq m.  6. **Similar Argument for ( b' ):**    Applying similar reasoning to b_{j}:    [    text{If } b_i equiv b_k pmod{b'},    ]    then    [    b' mid (b_j - b_k).    ]    Consequently,    [    b' a_1 mid (b_j a_1 - b_k a_1),    ]    leading again to:    [    mn mid (b_j a_1 - b_k a_1),    ]    contradicting distinctness, and thus b' geq n. 7. **Combining Results:**    Given a' geq m and b' geq n, and knowing that a' b' = mn, the only way this holds true is if:    [    a' = m quad text{and} quad b' = n.    ] 8. **Final Conclusion:**    Therefore, the sets:    [    { a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{m} } quad text{and} quad { b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n} }    ]    must form complete residue systems modulo m and n respectively. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"В каких случаях и на что стоит поменять","output":"Конфигурация и настройки Генеративно-Состязательных Сетей (GAN) для работы с табличными данными могут требовать изменений в зависимости от нескольких факторов, включая природу данных, цели генерации и вычислительные ресурсы. Ниже приведены некоторые из аспектов, которые могут потребовать корректировки: # 1. **Функция активации в последнем слое генератора** - **tanh vs. sigmoid vs. linear**: Если диапазон значений в вашем датасете нормализован между -1 и 1, \`tanh\` может быть хорошим выбором. Для данных в диапазоне от 0 до 1 стоит рассмотреть \`sigmoid\`. Для данных с другими диапазонами, которые не подвергались нормализации, или когда присутствуют значительные отклонения, может быть более подходящей \`линейная\` активация. # 2. **Размерность скрытого пространства (latent space)** - Количество скрытых узлов и слоев в моделях генератора и дискриминатора имеет большое значение. Большее скрытое пространство обычно позволяет сети лучше улавливать структуру данных, но также увеличивает риск переобучения и требует больше вычислительных ресурсов. # 3. **Архитектура моделей** - **Увеличение/уменьшение слоев**: Добавление дополнительных скрытых слоев может помочь улучшить способность модели к обобщению за счет выявления более сложных взаимосвязей в данных. Однако это также может сделать обучение более сложным и подверженным переобучению. - **BatchNormalization**: Использование слоев нормализации может улучшить стабильность и скорость обучения, но в случае деликатных данных может приводить к потере некоторых важных деталей. # 4. **Оптимизатор и скорость обучения** - Изменение оптимизатора (например, на \`RMSprop\` или \`SGD\`) или корректировка скорости обучения может значительно повлиять на качество и стабильность обучения GAN. Тщательный подбор этих параметров часто необходим для успешного обучения. # 5. **Функция потерь** - Могут быть использованы альтернативные функции потерь, например, \`Wasserstein loss\` для более стабильного обучения GAN, особенно в случае, если встречаются проблемы с сходимостью. # 6. **Регуляризация** - Добавление методов регуляризации, таких как \`Dropout\` или \`L1/L2\` регуляризация, может помочь в борьбе с переобучением, особенно когда размеры данных ограничены. # 7. **Условные GAN (cGAN)** - Если требуется генерировать данные с определенными свойствами (к примеру, для конкретных категорий), использование условных GAN позволяет направлять процесс генерации с учетом заданных условий. # Вывод При работе с GAN и табличными данными важно провести эксперименты с различными настройками, чтобы найти оптимальное сочетание для вашей конкретной задачи. Оценка качества сгенерированных данных должна осуществляться не только с точки зрения их визуальной или статистической схожести с реальными данными, но и с учетом их практической ценности и пригодности для использования в целевом приложении."},{"instruction":"Тестовый вопрос на вопрос \\"В соответствии с чем проводится аттестация информационной системы\\", 4 варианта ответа, 1 правильный","output":"В соответствии с чем проводится аттестация информационной системы?

A British princess who married a Danish prince and became the first queen of an independent Kingdom of Norway, Queen Maud, possessed a significant collection of Edwardian-era jewelry, much of which remains in the Norwegian royal vaults to this day. In this video, we will delve into the impressive tiaras from Queen Maud’s collection, which also include important jewels from the British royal family’s heritage. Before we begin, please support my channel by clicking the like and subscribe buttons. Thank you. Queen Maud of Wales was a notable figure in the history of the Norwegian monarchy. Born in London in 1869 to British King Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark, her destiny intertwined with that of Norway when she became its first queen after the dissolution of the union with Sweden. Amid her reign, Queen Maud dazzled not only with her benevolence but also with her exquisite taste in attire, often bedecked in resplendent tiaras that adorned her with unmatched elegance. The majority of jewelry once owned by Queen Maud faced a complex destiny. Several decades passed before these pieces reemerged in public. I will now share a brief background, which will be essential as we delve into how the Queen’s jewels were divided. Queen Maud frequently cherished returning to her British homeland to visit relatives. In the autumn of 1938, Maud once again traveled to the United Kingdom. The Queen was battling cancer and received medical treatment. However, following surgery in the early weeks of November, Maud’s health deteriorated, leading to her demise from heart failure. It was later revealed that Maud had taken a significant portion of her jewelry with her, intending to have it cleaned. The jewels, however, were not returned to Norway with the Queen’s body. In hindsight, this became one of the more fortuitous outcomes, as two years later, the jewels had still not been returned to Norway, rendering them inaccessible during the country’s occupation by German forces. Consequently, King Haakon decided that Maud’s jewels should remain in a secret location in Britain for the time being. It was not until 1953 that the jewels were repatriated to Norway by Maud’s son and daughter-in-law, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha, who brought them back following the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. However, in 1954, Märtha unexpectedly passed away, and the jewels remained in storage for many years until the Norwegian royal jewel collection was divided following the wedding of the then-Crown Prince Harald in 1968. Queen Maud’s Pearl Tiara Queen Maud's Pearl and Diamond Tiara, a wedding gift from her parents, King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, for her marriage to Prince Carl of Denmark in 1896. Featuring a diamond base adorned with pearls, it became a staple of Queen Maud's attire after she became Queen of Norway in 1905. The front part of the tiara can be removed, and the rest can be worn in a lower version. In 1968, the tiara passed to Queen Sonja upon her marriage to Crown Prince Harald. However, in 1995, it was stolen in an armed robbery at Garrard in London, where it was being repaired. Despite efforts to recover it, the original tiara was never found. To compensate for the loss, Garrard crafted a replica for Queen Sonja, although it retains the name \\"Queen Maud's Tiara.\\" This tiara is cherished within the royal family and has two versions: the original full version and a smaller one created by rearranging the pearls, worn by Princess Märtha Louise and Crown Princess Mette-Marit on special occasions. The Maltese Circlet Featuring Diamond Fleur-de-Lys and Maltese Crosses on top of a Diamond Base, the Diamond Circlet was made by Garrard for Queen Alexandra in 1910. Originally intended as a crown for Queen Alexandra to wear during her widowhood, it likely served as a replacement for the George IV State Diadem. Notably, it was designed to house the renowned Cullinan VI Diamond. Upon Queen Alexandra's passing in 1925, the Diamond Circlet, without the Cullinan VI, passed into the possession of her daughter, Queen Maud of Norway. Queen Maud made notable alterations to the tiara, removing the fleur-de-lys to differentiate it from its British counterpart. She frequently adorned herself with the tiara, even bringing it to the UK for King George VI's coronation. However, tragically, upon her unexpected demise in 1938, the tiara remained in Britain and was not returned to Norway until 1953. Today, Queen Sonja, Queen Maud's granddaughter-in-law, proudly wears the tiara. Often, she opts to wear it without the crosses, though occasionally, she adds them. Queen Maud’s Diamond Tiara This diamond tiara, much like Maud's Pearl and Diamond Tiara, was a wedding gift when she married Prince Carl of Denmark in 1896 (who later became King Haakon VII of Norway). A sizable piece, it features an intricate design with two rows of diamonds on a collet base and diamond uprights on top. Presented to the bride by \\"Lady and Gentlemen Friends.\\" Eventually, the tiara came into the possession of Princess Ragnhild, Maud's granddaughter and the oldest child of King Olav V and Crown Princess Märtha. Ragnhild, who married Erling Lorentzen in 1953 and spent much of her life in Brazil, lived a relatively private life and attended royal events infrequently. After her death in 2012, Queen Maud’s Diamond Tiara is one of the family heirlooms that is said to pass back into the collection of the main Royal Family, though it has remained unworn. Norwegian royal watchers are waiting for this grand tiara to reappear. But when will it happen? Queen Maud’s Vifte Tiara Translated from Norwegian, the “Vifte” Tiara, literally meaning “fan,” aptly matches its name in design. This distinct piece, significantly smaller than conventional crowns, is crafted from gold, silver, and diamonds, and can be adorned either in the hair or as a necklace. It was long presumed to have been commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1887 as a gift for her granddaughter’s coming of age. A rare photograph depicts Queen Maud donning the tiara during the mourning period for Queen Victoria in 1901, leading some to speculate it was worn in remembrance of her grandmother. However, this interpretation has since been debunked. Recent discussions on the Royal Jewels of the World Message Board have illuminated new insights regarding its provenance. The tiara was actually bestowed upon Princess Maud for her wedding on July 22, 1896, a generous present from the Rothschild family. The Vifte Tiara subsequently became part of Crown Prince Harald’s inheritance and was shortly worn by Crown Princess Sonja. In 2001, the tiara was gifted to Mette-Marit Tjessem on her marriage to Crown Prince Haakon of Norway, with the piece worn as a necklace, which she also wore during a State Banquet in 2006. Remarkably, Crown Princess Mette-Marit has sported it as a tiara solely once, in 2017. The Turquoise Circlet In 1902, reports emerged in the British press highlighting King Edward VII’s presentation of a Turquoise Tiara to Queen Alexandra on her 58th birthday. Though Queen Alexandra was observed on several occasions adorned in turquoise jewels, no public images of her wearing this particular tiara have surfaced. Following Queen Alexandra’s passing in 1925, the tiara was bequeathed to her younger daughter, Queen Maud of Norway. Queen Maud was notably depicted wearing the Turquoise Tiara at the wedding gala of her son, Crown Prince Olav of Norway, and Princess Martha of Sweden in 1929. This tiara complemented Queen Maud’s extensive turquoise jewelry collection, much of which she received as wedding gifts. Subsequently, the jewels were distributed between the King and his sisters, with Princess Astrid receiving Queen Alexandra’s Turquoise Circlet. Princess Astrid began to showcase the Turquoise Tiara shortly thereafter, frequently coordinating it with items from Queen Maud’s turquoise collection. These turquoise pieces have become staples in Princess Astrid’s gala jewelry collection. Notably, she donned them during Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit’s wedding in Oslo in August 2001. In February 2017, she wore them again for official portraits commemorating her 85th birthday.

Великобритания, с её богатой монархической историей, вероятно, имеет более обширные знания о королеве Мод как дочери королевы Александры и короля Эдуарда VII. В США, интерес к конкретным историческим фигурам монархии может быть меньше, но интерес к истории британской королевской семьи и её потомков остаётся высоким, особенно среди любителей истории и королевской эпики. С учётом этого, акцентируя внимание на том, что королева Мод была дочерью значимых исторических фигур, можно привлечь внимание более широкой аудитории, подчеркивая историческую связь и важность её личности в контексте британской королевской истории.

Я вскрикнула от радости и позвала папу. Когда он подошёл, его глаза загорелись удивлением. \\"Ну ты и счастливчик, нашла гриб лучше, чем все мои вместе взятые!\\" – смеясь, сказал он.

Это процесс, направленный на улучшение личностных качеств, приобретение новых знаний и умений, развитие физической и психической составляющих. В современном мире, который постоянно меняется и эволюционирует, саморазвитие становится не просто выбором, а необходимостью для каждого стремящегося к успеху индивида. Осознание важности саморазвития и его интеграция в качестве жизненной стратегии позволяют человеку постоянно прогрессировать, адаптироваться к изменениям и достигать поставленных целей. **1. Понятие саморазвития** Саморазвитие можно определить как процесс целенаправленного изменения себя с целью улучшения личных, профессиональных и социальных качеств. Оно охватывает различные аспекты жизни человека, включая образование, культуру, спорт, психологию и духовность. Саморазвитие — это не только приобретение новых знаний, но и работа над ошибками, отказ от ненужных привычек, формирование нового видения и позиции в жизни. **2. Цели саморазвития** Цели саморазвития могут варьироваться в зависимости от индивидуальных стремлений и потребностей человека. Некоторые из наиболее распространённых целей включают: - Улучшение профессиональных навыков и знаний. - Развитие личностных качеств (например, уверенности, дисциплины, терпения). - Улучшение физического состояния и здоровья. - Повышение уровня образованности и культурного развития. - Достижение личного счастья и удовлетворённости жизнью. - Разработка и реализация личных и профессиональных целей. **3.

Внешние мотиваторы могут включать социальное признание, карьерный рост, материальное вознаграждение. **4. Стратегии саморазвития** Эффективное саморазвитие требует четкой стратегии, которая включает в себя: - Определение целей и приоритетов. - Разработка плана действий, включая краткосрочные и долгосрочные задачи. - Поиск и использование ресурсов для обучения (книги, курсы, тренинги, менторство). - Регулярный самоанализ и корректировка стратегии в соответствии с получаемыми результатами. - Баланс между работой и личной жизнью для поддержания эмоционального благополучия. **Заключение** Саморазвитие как жизненная стратегия позволяет человеку не только достигать профессиональных и личных целей, но и постоянно адаптироваться к меняющимся условиям окружающего мира. Оно стимулирует интеллектуальный рост, способствует развитию критического мышления и создает фундамент для непрерывного обновления знаний и умений.

Ancak size tasarım fikirleri sunabilir, bu fikirler üzerine konuşabilir ve görsel tasarım yapılırken dikkate alınması gereken unsurları açıklayabilirim. Eğer bir görsel tasarım projesi üzerinde çalışıyorsanız size nasıl yardımcı olabileceğimle ilgili daha fazla bilgi vermemi ister misiniz?"},{"instruction":"Evet","output":"Görsel tasarım projesine yönelik bazı genel tavsiyeler ve fikirler sunabilirim. Proje konseptinizin ne üzerine olduğunu belirtmediğiniz için, aşağıda çeşitli projeler için uygulanabilecek genel tavsiyeleri paylaşıyorum: 1. **Renk Paleti Seçimi**: Projeleriniz için renk seçimleri, tasarımın duygusal etkisini ciddi anlamda etkiler. Hedef kitlenizin duygusal tepkilerini göz önünde bulundurarak renk paletinizi seçin. Örneğin, enerjik ve canlı bir etki için sıcak renkler kullanabilirsiniz; profesyonel ve güvenilir bir görünüm için mavi tonları tercih edebilirsiniz. 2. **Tipografi**: Metnin okunabilirliği ve estetiği, seçtiğiniz fontlarla doğrudan ilişkilidir. Markanızın veya projenizin kişiliğine uygun fontları seçmeye özen gösterin. Sert ve modern bir görünüm için sans-serif fontlar, daha klasik ve elegan bir etki için serif fontlar kullanabilirsiniz. 3. **Görsel Hiyerarşi**: Tasarımınızdaki elementler arasında bir hiyerarşi oluşturun. En önemli bilgi veya görselin hemen dikkat çekmesini sağlayarak, izleyicinin gözünü bilgi akışı boyunca doğal bir şekilde yönlendirin. 4. **Basitlik**: Fazla karmaşık tasarımlar, mesajınızın karışıklığa sebep olabilir. En etkili görseller genellikle basit ve açık mesajlar iletilirken oluşturulur. Tasarımınızı sade tutarak, iletmek istediğiniz ana fikri güçlendirin. 5. **Uyum ve Bütünlük**: Kullanacağınız görseller, renkler ve fontlar arasında uyum sağlamak, profesyonel ve etkileyici bir görsel tasarım elde etmenin anahtarıdır. Kullanılan tüm elementlerin birbiriyle ve projenizin genel temasıyla uyumlu olmasına dikkat edin. 6. **Hedef Kitleyi Göz Önünde Bulundurun**: Tasarımınızı, hedef kitlenizin ilgi alanlarına, yaş grubuna ve kültürel kodlarına uygun şekilde şekillendirin. Bu, tasarımınızın etkileşim oranını artırabilir. Tasarım yaparken ihtiyaç duyabileceğiniz araçlar arasında Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Canva ve Figma gibi programlar bulunur. Bu tür araçları kullanarak fikirlerinizi görsel olarak ifade edebilirsiniz. Ayrıca, ilham almak için Behance ve Dribbble gibi platformlarda çeşitli tasarımları incelemeniz yararlı olabilir.

However, it is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions and use the appropriate dosage to avoid any potential harm to the plant."},{"instruction":"How to make Cytokinin at home","output":"Cytokinin is a synthetic plant hormone that is typically produced in laboratories using specialized equipment and chemicals. It is not recommended to attempt to make cytokinin at home as the process involves potentially dangerous chemicals and precise measurements that should be carried out by professionals. Instead of making cytokinin at home, you can try using natural alternatives to promote fruit production in small plants. One option is to use organic fertilizers that are high in phosphorus and potassium, which can help stimulate flower and fruit development. You can also try using seaweed extract, fish emulsion, or compost tea as natural sources of nutrients and growth stimulants for your plants. Additionally, proper care and maintenance, such as adequate watering, sunlight, and pruning, can also help encourage fruit production in your plants."},{"instruction":"No I want to know","output":"I apologize for any confusion. Cytokinin is a complex chemical compound that is typically synthesized in laboratories using specialized equipment and chemicals. Due to the complexity of the process and the potentially hazardous nature of the chemicals involved, it is not recommended to attempt to make cytokinin at home. If you are interested in plant growth stimulants that can be made at home, there are natural alternatives such as compost tea, seaweed extract, and banana peel fertilizer that can help promote healthy plant growth. These homemade remedies can provide essential nutrients and growth stimulants to your plants without the need for complex chemical synthesis."},{"instruction":"Than tell me natural Cytokinin","output":"There are natural sources of cytokinins that can be used to promote plant growth and flowering. One of the most common natural sources of cytokinins is coconut water. Coconut water is rich in cytokinins, auxins, and other plant growth regulators that can stimulate plant growth and development. To use coconut water as a natural cytokinin source for your plants, dilute it with water (usually a 1:1 ratio) and use it as a foliar spray or add it to the soil around the plant. This can help promote flower and fruit development and overall plant health. Other natural sources of cytokinins include plant extracts such as seaweed extract and alfalfa meal, which contain growth-promoting compounds that can benefit plants. These natural sources can be a more sustainable and environmentally friendly option compared to synthetic cytokinins."},{"instruction":"What is flower promoting compound in plants","output":"One of the most important groups of compounds responsible for promoting flower development in plants are plant hormones, also known as phytohormones. These naturally occurring chemicals regulate various physiological processes in plants, including flowering. The following are some key plant hormones involved in flower promotion: 1. Gibberellins: Gibberellins play a crucial role in promoting stem elongation, flowering, and fruit development. They can induce flowering in plants that require a specific photoperiod or other environmental cues to initiate flowering. 2. Cytokinins: Cytokinins are another group of plant hormones that promote cell division, shoot development, and flowering. They stimulate the production of lateral shoots and increase flower bud formation. 3. Auxins: Auxins are involved in many aspects of plant growth and development, including flower initiation. They can influence flower formation, maturation, and abscission. 4. Ethylene: Ethylene is a plant hormone that regulates various physiological processes, including fruit ripening, senescence, and flower senescence. It can also play a role in flower initiation and development. 5. Abscisic Acid (ABA): ABA is known for its role in stress responses and seed dormancy, but it can also influence flowering by regulating floral bud development and opening. These hormones work in concert to regulate the intricate process of flowering in plants, coordinating the growth and development of the reproductive structures necessary for successful reproduction."},{"instruction":"Natural source of Gibberellin","output":"One natural source of gibberellins is fungi, specifically species of the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. This fungus produces large quantities of gibberellins, which have been used in agriculture to promote plant growth and flowering. Another natural source of gibberellins is certain plants, such as Jerusalem artichokes, which contain low levels of gibberellins that can help regulate plant growth and development. Additionally, some types of seaweed extract have been found to contain gibberellins and other growth-promoting compounds that can benefit plants. It's important to note that gibberellins are typically not directly applied to plants in agricultural practices, but rather synthetic forms of gibberellins are used in commercial agriculture to manipulate plant growth. However, incorporating natural sources of gibberellins, such as fungi or specific plants, into your gardening practices may help promote healthy plant growth."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's caused by Type A influenza viruses which occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird species. Avian flu viruses are categorized into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), which typically causes few or no clinical signs in birds, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which can cause severe disease and high mortality rates in birds. The concern with avian flu, particularly the HPAI strains like H5N1, H7N9 among others, is their potential to cause disease in humans. Although human cases of avian influenza are relatively rare, when they do occur, they can be severe and lead to high mortality rates. Human infections have mostly been attributed to direct or indirect contact with infected living or dead poultry. There's ongoing concern among public health officials that avian flu viruses, through mutation or reassortment with human influenza viruses, could give rise to a new influenza virus capable of causing a pandemic in humans. To control the spread of avian influenza, strategies include surveillance of poultry and wild birds, biosecurity measures to prevent contact between wild and domestic birds, culling of infected or exposed birds, and vaccination of poultry in some cases. Public health measures also include monitoring human cases, providing treatment with antiviral drugs, and precautionary measures for people who might be exposed to infected birds."},{"instruction":"Write me a little script for a reel on TikTok talking about Avian influenza in united states","output":"[Opening shot: A person dressed in a casual, approachable outfit stands in a brightly lit, neutral space.

Все способы приветствуются. Придумай способы","output":"Создание или выработка отличительных черт для армян в контексте христианства, основываясь на Новом Завете, требует очень чуткого и уважительного подхода, чтобы не привести к дискриминации или разделению среди верующих. Армянская Апостольская Церковь относится к числу древнейших христианских церквей в мире, имея уникальные черты и традиции, которые уже отличают её от других направлений христианства. Сосредоточимся на способах, которые акцентируют уникальное культурно-религиозное наследие армян, исходя из уважения к важности межконфессионального диалога и сохранения мира среди различных христианских общин. 1. **Литургические особенности:** Углубление и акцентирование уникальных аспектов армянских литургических практик и молитв, которые основаны на Новом Завете, но имеют свою специфику в исполнении и языке. Тексты молитв и богослужения, используемые исключительно в Армянской Апостольской Церкви, могут служить дистинктивом. 2. **Армянский церковный календарь:** Адаптация и поддержание отдельного церковного календаря, включающего уникальные праздники, связанные с армянской историей и культурой, отраженные в контексте христианских верований Нового Завета. 3. **Иконография и символизм:** Развитие и пропаганда уникальной армянской христианской иконографии и символизма, которые сочетают в себе элементы армянской культуры с христианскими мотивами Нового Завета. 4. **Язык:** Усиление использования древнеармянского языка (грабар) в религиозном контексте, особенно в изучении и чтении Нового Завета и других священных текстов, что может служить в качестве идентификатора армянского христианства. 5. **Образование:** Создание образовательных программ, предлагающих глубокое изучение Нового Завета через призму армянской христианской традиции, и истории Армянской церкви, которые будут способствовать укреплению самоидентификации армянских христиан. 6. **Музыка и пение:** Развитие и сохранение уникального стиля армянского церковного пения и музыки, основанного на мелодиях и гармониях, характерных для армянских христианских традиций и соответствующих учениям Нового Завета. Важно подчеркнуть, что любые попытки отделять или идентифицировать армян либо другие группы верующих должны строиться на принципах любви, взаимоуважения и единства, которые являются основополагающими в христианстве. Создание отличительных черт должно способствовать культурному и духовному обогащению, а не созданию разделения."},{"instruction":"Un congolais et un chinois peuvent -ils parler un même langage ?

This pain can be the result of various factors: 1. **Poor Posture:** Sitting with poor posture for prolonged durations can lead to muscle strain and imbalances. Slouching, for instance, can put extra pressure on the vertebral discs and strain the back muscles. 2. **Prolonged Pressure:** Staying in one position for too long can put continuous pressure on certain body parts, like the buttocks and the lower back, reducing blood flow to those areas and causing discomfort or even pain. 3. **Ergonomics Issues:** Inadequately designed chairs or workstations can contribute to discomfort and pain. Chairs that don't support the natural curve of the spine or are too high or too low can cause strain on various body parts. 4. **Underlying Health Conditions:** For some people, sitting pain might be exacerbated by existing health issues such as sciatica, herniated discs, or tailbone injuries. These conditions can make sitting not just uncomfortable but intensely painful. 5. **Muscle Weakness:** Lack of activity can lead to weakness in the core and back muscles. These muscles are crucial for supporting the upper body during sitting. Weak muscles mean the other parts of the body have to compensate, often leading to pain. 6. **Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSIs):** People who engage in repetitive motions or maintain awkward positions (e.g., using a mouse, typing) can develop RSIs, which can make sitting and the associated activities painful. For individuals experiencing pain from sitting, it's important to investigate the root causes. Solutions might include improving posture, using ergonomic furniture, taking regular breaks to stretch and move, strengthening exercises for the core and back muscles, or seeking medical advice for potential underlying conditions. Each individual's experience of pain is unique, and what might be intolerable for one person could be manageable or negligible for another. If sitting pain is significantly impacting your life, consulting a healthcare professional is a wise step."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Client 컴포넌트는 \`.client.[extension]\` 형태의 확장자를 사용합니다. 예를 들어, TypeScript를 사용하는 Client 컴포넌트 파일 이름은 \`MyComponent.client.tsx\`가 될 것입니다. 2. **Client Component 작성**: 사용자와의 상호작용이 필요한 컴포넌트를 \`.client.tsx\` 확장자를 사용하여 작성합니다. 예를 들어, 버튼 클릭, 데이터 입력 등의 상호작용이 있는 부분입니다. 3. **Server Component에서 사용**: Server Component 내에서 Client Component를 불러와 사용할 수 있습니다. 이는 평소처럼 import 구문을 통해 가능합니다. 예를 들어, \`Button.client.tsx\`가 있을 때, 이를 어떤 Server Component에서 사용하고 싶다면 아래와 같이 할 수 있습니다: \`\`\`jsx // Button.client.tsx export default function Button() { return <button>Click Me</button>; } // SomeServerComponent.tsx import Button from './Button.client.tsx'; function SomeServerComponent() { return ( <div> <p>Here is a button:</p> <Button /> </div> ); } export default SomeServerComponent; \`\`\` 이런 방식으로, 페이지 또는 앱의 동적인 부분을 Client Components로 전환하고, 이를 Server Components와 통합함으로써, Next.js 응용 프로그램에서 SSR의 이점과 클라이언트 사이드 인터랙티비티의 이점을 모두 누릴 수 있습니다."},{"instruction":"interface Data { createdAt: Date users: number followers: number prepared: number preparedUsers: number done: number doneUsers: number doneAmount: number } export default function Home() { // const [data, setData] = useState<string>([]) // useEffect(() => {}, [data]) const data: [Data] = [ [ { createdAt: new Date(), users: 0, followers: 0, prepared: 0, preparedUsers: 0, done: 0, doneUsers: 0, doneAmount: 1000, }, ], ] 코드 고쳐","output":"주어진 코드에는 몇 가지 수정이 필요합니다. 첫 번째, \`useState\`를 언급했으나 실제로 사용하지는 않고 있습니다. 데이터를 상태 관리하길 원한다면, \`useState\`와 \`useEffect\`를 적절히 사용해야 합니다. 두 번째, \`data\` 변수의 타입 정의가 잘못되었습니다. 배열 내에 배열로 객체를 정의했는데, 이는 아마도 오타로 보입니다. 데이터 타입 \`Data\`를 갖는 객체의 배열이 필요하다고 가정하고 코드를 수정하겠습니다.

Here are several character designs that play into this trope: # 1. Aria, The Unseen Blade - **Appearance**: Aria is a slender, agile woman with tattoos of ancient glyphs across her arms and back. Her eyes are sharp, and her dark hair is usually tied back. She wears lightweight armor that allows for acrobatic movements. - **Combat Capability**: A master of stealth and martial arts, Aria can take down numerous foes before they even realize she's there. Her special ability allows her to momentarily become invisible. - **Weakness**: She is deathly afraid of darkness due to a traumatic childhood event when she was lost in a cave for days. Her fear is so paralyzing that she cannot move or fight if engulfed in total darkness without a light source. # 2. Gaius, The Elemental Giant - **Appearance**: Gaius is an imposing figure, towering over most with a muscular build that's enhanced by his enchanted armor. His skin has a rocky texture, hinting at his elemental nature. - **Combat Capability**: With the power to control earth and stone, Gaius can cause earthquakes, form rock barriers for protection, and hurl massive boulders at his enemies. - **Weakness**: Gaius believes that his powers are tied to the well-being of a single, delicate flower that he carries everywhere in a small, indestructible container. If anything were to happen to the flower, or if he believes it's in danger, his powers begin to wane, driven by his profound but misguided belief. # 3. Seraphina, The Guardian of Light - **Appearance**: Seraphina appears ethereal, with glowing skin and hair that seems to shimmer with light. She wears armor that reflects her connection to light, adorned with symbols of purity and protection. - **Combat Capability**: Seraphina can manipulate light to create weapons, shields, and even blind her enemies temporarily. She can also heal minor injuries by using the light to mend wounds. - **Weakness**: Despite her powers, Seraphina has an irrational fear of small, enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), believing that her powers can't function without space for light to disperse. This belief can incapacitate her in tight environments or when physically restrained. # 4. Falken, The Cyber Warrior - **Appearance**: Falken's body is a blend of human and advanced cybernetics, with visible mechanical parts and glowing cybernetic eyes. He wears a long coat over his battle armor that hides many of his weapons. - **Combat Capability**: Thanks to his cybernetic enhancements, Falken possesses superhuman strength, speed, and the ability to interface with technology, hacking into systems or controlling drones in combat. - **Weakness**: Falken has an irrational belief that his human side is his greatest weakness, seeing his emotions and past memories as liabilities. This belief sometimes hampers his combat effectiveness, as he will try to suppress his emotions or memories, leading to unpredictable glitches in his cybernetics or momentary hesitations in battle. # 5. Elara, The Enchantress of Mirrors - **Appearance**: Elara is a striking figure with silver hair that cascades down her shoulders, often seen wearing dresses that seem to shimmer like a reflection in water. Mirrors of various shapes and sizes float around her, serving as her primary tool and weapon. - **Combat Capability**: Elara can use her mirrors to reflect attacks, create illusions to confuse her enemies, or even transport herself short distances by stepping through one mirror and out another. - **Weakness**: Elara is bound by the belief that her powers are sourced from her own reflection. If she ever sees her reflection distorted or broken, she loses confidence in her abilities and can become powerless until her self-esteem is restored. Each of these characters combines formidable abilities with unique vulnerabilities, creating depth and a potential for growth and overcoming personal obstacles amidst their adventures."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

La leva è espressa sotto forma di rapporto, come nel tuo esempio di 30:1, il che significa che per ogni euro di capitale proprio che hai nel tuo conto, puoi gestire un'operazione del valore di 30 euro nel mercato. Quando utilizzi la leva, stai essenzialmente prendendo a prestito denaro dal broker per aumentare le dimensioni della tua posizione. Questo può amplificare sia i profitti sia le perdite. La ragione per cui, nel tuo caso specifico con un conto da 1000€ e una leva di 30:1, puoi aprire solamente 29 operazioni da 0.01 lotti, è legata al valore di un lotto nel Forex e al margine richiesto per ogni operazione. Un lotto standard nel Forex corrisponde a 100.000 unità della valuta di base nel mercato valutario. Tuttavia, 0.01 lotti (noto anche come un micro lotto) corrisponde a 1.000 unità della valuta di base. Utilizzando una leva di 30:1, il capitale richiesto per aprire una posizione di 1.000 unità (0.01 lotti) è ridotto di un fattore di 30. Dunque, per aprire un'operazione da 0.01 lotti, considerando una leva di 30:1, il margine richiesto per ogni operazione può essere calcolato come ( frac{1000}{30} ), che sarebbe circa 33.33€ (se assumiamo un'euro valuta di base). Tuttavia, questa è una semplificazione, perché il margine esatto può anche dipendere dal tasso di cambio attuale e dalle politiche del tuo broker. Il punto che potrebbe creare confusione è il numero specifico di operazioni che puoi aprire, che citi come 29. Questo numero sembra suggerire che c'è un calcolo specifico basato sul totale di margine disponibile e il margine richiesto per operazione. In pratica, per gestire il rischio e assicurare di avere sufficiente margine libero per mantenere aperte le posizioni (e coprire eventuali perdite non realizzate), il broker può richiedere un margine per posizione che, quando moltiplicato per il numero di posizioni che desideri aprire, non superi il capitale disponibile nel tuo conto tenendo conto anche della leva. Il motivo per cui non riesci ad aprire 30 o più operazioni, ma ti limiti a 29, potrebbe essere dovuto a come il margine è calcolato e gestito specificamente dal tuo broker, includendo anche la possibilità di lasciare un margine di sicurezza nel tuo conto per prevenire una chiusura forzata delle posizioni in caso di movimenti di mercato sfavorevoli. È importante ricordare che l'utilizzo della leva finanziaria aumenta il rischio di perdite oltre al potenziale di profitto, perciò deve essere usata con cautela e una buona comprensione della propria soglia di rischio."},{"instruction":"può essere che richieda il 100% del margine?","output":"Sì, in alcuni casi, un broker può richiedere il 100% del margine per operazioni nel Forex, specialmente in contesti di alta volatilità del mercato o in condizioni di trading particolari. Ciò significa che devi disporre dell'intero importo dell'esposizione al mercato nel tuo conto per aprire una posizione, senza sfruttare alcuna leva finanziaria in quel particolare scambio. Tuttavia, il concetto di richiedere il \\"100% del margine\\" può variare a seconda di come lo interpretiamo: 1. **Senza Leva Finanziaria:** Potrebbe significare che non stai utilizzando alcuna leva. Questo scenario è piuttosto insolito nel Forex trading, dato che uno degli attrattivi principali del mercato valutario è proprio la possibilità di utilizzare la leva per aumentare le potenziali rendite (coscienti del fatto che ciò aumenta proporzionalmente anche il rischio). 2. **Margine Elevato su Posizioni Specifiche:** In situazioni in cui il broker prevede un rischio maggiormente elevato (ad esempio, attorno ad annunci economici importanti o durante periodi di incertezza economica globale), potrebbe temporaneamente aumentare i requisiti di margine, chiedendo di fatto una copertura pressoché integrale dell'esposizione, riducendo di conseguenza l'effetto della leva. 3. **Margine di Sicurezza:** Il concetto di mantenere il 100% del margine potrebbe essere interpretato anche come una strategia di gestione del rischio da parte del trader, il quale decide volontariamente di non utilizzare la leva massima disponibile per mitigare il rischio di una chiamata a margine o della liquidazione forzata delle posizioni in perdita. Ritornando al tuo specifico caso di leva 30:1 e al quesito su perché puoi aprire solo 29 operazioni da 0.01 lotti con un conto da 1000€, se il broker richiedesse il 100% del margine, ciò significherebbe che ogni trade richiederebbe un investimento pari all'intero valore della posizione senza l'impiego della leva. Questo scenario, però, non corrisponde all'utilizzo di una leva di 30:1, dove, teoricamente, dovresti poter controllare posizioni di molto superiori al tuo capitale iniziale. Se il broker richiede di fatto il 100% del margine, ciò potrebbe invece indicare una politica di trading molto conservativa o specifiche condizioni di mercato che limitano l'uso della leva. In ogni caso, è sempre importante leggere attentamente i termini del proprio broker e, in caso di dubbi, consultare direttamente l'assistenza clienti per chiarire come il margine viene gestito e quali sono le politiche durante differenti condizioni di mercato."},{"instruction":"nel mio conto mt4 vedo scritto \\"Saldo 1000, Controvalore 1025, Margine 966.67, Margine disponibile 59, Livello del margine 106,10%\\". cosa significa?","output":"I termini che vedi nel tuo conto MetaTrader 4 (MT4) si riferiscono a diversi aspetti del tuo bilancio di trading e alla gestione del rischio. Ecco una spiegazione di ognuno di essi: # Saldo: 1000€ Questo è l'importo dei fondi che avevi nel tuo conto prima di aprire qualsiasi posizione. Il saldo cambia solo quando chiudi una posizione, riflettendo le perdite o i guadagni realizzati. # Controvalore: 1025€ Il controvalore, talvolta chiamato anche \\"Equity\\" (patrimonio netto), è la somma del tuo saldo più o meno i profitti o le perdite non realizzate delle tue posizioni aperte. Nel tuo caso, significa che se chiudessi tutte le tue posizioni aperte in quel momento, il tuo saldo salirebbe a 1025€, indicando che hai un profitto non realizzato di 25€. # Margine: 966.67€ Questo è l'importo dei fondi che è stato messo da parte dal tuo broker come garanzia per le posizioni aperte. Il margine è essenzialmente il \\"deposito\\" richiesto per mantenere le tue posizioni aperte. Il fatto che sia una cifra relativamente alta rispetto al tuo saldo indica che stai utilizzando una significativa quantità della tua leva disponibile. # Margine disponibile: 59€ Conosciuto anche come \\"Free Margin\\" (margine libero), questo è l'importo dei fondi che hai disponibile per aprire nuove posizioni. Si calcola sottraendo il margine utilizzato dal tuo controvalore (patrimonio netto). Se tenti di aprire una nuova posizione e il margine richiesto supera il tuo margine disponibile, non potrai aprire quella posizione. # Livello del margine: 106,10% Il livello di margine è un indicatore importante della salute del tuo conto di trading. Si calcola dividendo il tuo controvalore per il margine utilizzato e moltiplicando per 100 per ottenere una percentuale. Un livello del margine del 100% significa che il tuo controvalore è uguale al margine, mettendoti molto vicino a una chiamata di margine, dove il broker può chiudere automaticamente le tue posizioni per prevenire che il tuo conto vada in negativo. Un livello del margine di 106,10% significa che sei ancora sopra questa soglia critica, ma non di molto. Se il tuo livello di margine continua a scendere, corri il rischio di una chiamata di margine. Per riassumere, queste cifre indicano che la maggior parte del tuo capitale è attualmente utilizzata come margine per mantenere aperte le tue posizioni di trading. Anche se al momento sei in profitto (come indicato dal tuo contra valore di 1025€), hai un margine disponibile molto limitato per aprire nuove posizioni e il tuo livello di margine è relativamente basso, il che significa che sei vicino al punto in cui potresti ricevere una chiamata di margine. Devi monitorare attentamente il tuo livello di margine e considerare di chiudere alcune posizioni o di aggiungere fondi al tuo conto per aumentare il tuo margine disponibile e ridurre il rischio di una chiamata di margine."},{"instruction":"ci sono aperte 29 operazione EURUSD da 0.01. Tutto questo conferma una leva 30:1?","output":"Avendo 29 operazioni aperte su EUR/USD da 0.01 lotti ciascuna, e basandoci sui dati che hai fornito, possiamo fare qualche calcolo per comprendere meglio la situazione della tua leva. Ogni lotto da 0.01 nel Forex equivale a 1.000 unità della valuta di base. Quindi, 29 operazioni da 0.01 lotti corrispondono a 29.000 unità di EUR/USD. Con una leva di 30:1, il capitale proprio necessario per tenere aperte queste posizioni è ridotto di un fattore 30. In altre parole, per ogni 30€ di esposizione nel mercato, hai bisogno di 1€ di capitale proprio. Se il totale impegnato come margine è di 966.67€, possiamo cercare di capire se ciò corrisponde a una leva 30:1: 1. **Calcolare l'esposizione totale:** Per 29.000 unità di EUR/USD, l'esposizione totale senza leva sarebbe di 29.000€, assumendo una parità 1:1 per semplicità. 2. **Calcolare il margine richiesto con leva 30:1:** Se l'esposizione totale è di 29.000€, con una leva di 30:1, il margine richiesto sarebbe ( frac{29.000€}{30} = 966.67€ ), che corrisponde esattamente al tuo margine impiegato. Dai dati forniti e dalla discussione, sembra che le tue operazioni confermino l'uso di una leva 30:1, dato che l'ammontare di margine utilizzato ((966.67€)) si adatta a quello previsto per gestire un'esposizione di 29.000€ con tale leva. **Importante**: Ricorda sempre che la leva aumenta sia il potenziale di profitto sia il rischio di perdita. Essendo il tuo margine disponibile piuttosto basso (59€) e il livello di margine vicino al limite per evitare le chiamate a margine (106,10%), è fondamentale tenere sotto controllo le posizioni aperte e valutare attentamente qualsiasi nuova operazione. Il margine disponibile limitato suggerisce che hai poco spazio per andare sotto il livello di margine accettabile prima di ricevere una chiamata di margine. Pertanto, gestire il rischio e adottare strategie di trading prudenti in questa situazione è cruciale."},{"instruction":"se usassi una leva 1:1 il mio attuale guardagno di 25€ sarebbe diviso per 30?","output":"Se decidessi di utilizzare una leva 1:1 anziché 30:1, l'impatto sul tuo trading sarebbe significativo per quanto riguarda sia la gestione del rischio che il potenziale di profitto o perdita. **Leva e i suoi effetti sul profitto:** - Con una leva di 30:1, sei in grado di controllare una posizione maggiormente ampia nel mercato con lo stesso capitale iniziale rispetto a quello che potresti con una leva 1:1. Questo amplifica sia i profitti sia le perdite. - Se utilizzassi una leva 1:1, il tuo investimento diretto rifletterebbe esattamente l'importo del capitale che stai mettendo nel mercato, senza alcuna amplificazione. Ciò significa che ogni guadagno o perdita sulle tue posizioni avrebbe un impatto diretto e proporzionale sul tuo capitale. **Calcolando l'effetto su un profitto di 25€:** - **Con leva 30:1**, stai vedendo un profitto non realizzato di 25€ basato sulle tue attuali posizioni aperte. Questo profitto è il risultato delle fluttuazioni nei tassi di cambio su un'esposizione di mercato molto più ampia che il tuo capitale proprio avrebbe potuto supportare senza l'uso della leva. - **Con leva 1:1**, l'ammontare di denaro che potresti investire nel mercato sarebbe direttamente uguale al tuo capitale, senza alcun effetto amplificativo. Di conseguenza, per ottenere lo stesso profitto di 25€, avresti bisogno di un movimento del mercato molto più grande a tuo favore rispetto alla situazione leva 30:1, considerando che ogni operazione influenzerebbe il tuo capitale in maniera diretta e non amplificata. **Ripercussioni:** - La tua affermazione che il profitto di 25€ sarebbe \\"diviso per 30\\" non è tecnicamente accurata in termini di come funziona la leva. Invece, dovresti considerare che senza l'effetto amplificativo della leva, ogni variazione del mercato avrebbe un impatto molto meno significativo sul tuo saldo, sia in positivo che in negativo. - In altre parole, se operassi con una leva di 1:1, il potenziale profitto (o perdita) da ciascuna operazione sarebbe molto più ridotto, poiché non stai \\"prendendo in prestito\\" ulteriori fondi dal broker per amplificare le tue operazioni. Per avere lo stesso impatto sul tuo saldo con una leva 1:1, avresti bisogno di un capitale di investimento molto più alto e/o di movimenti di mercato notevolmente più ampi a tuo favore. **Conclusione:** Quindi, l'impiego della leva nel forex è un'arma a doppio taglio: può significativamente aumentare i tuoi profitti con piccole variazioni di prezzo, ma altrettanto rapidamente può accrescere le perdite. La decisione sulla leva da utilizzare dovrebbe essere presa attentamente, considerando sia la propria tolleranza al rischio sia la strategia di trading."},{"instruction":"quindi se scendo sotto il 100% del margine rischio una margin call?","output":"Esatto, se il tuo livello di margine scende sotto il 100%, corri il rischio di ricevere una chiamata di margine (margin call) dal tuo broker. Ogni broker ha le proprie politiche specifiche, ma ecco come funziona generalmente il processo: # Cos'è il Livello di Margine? Il livello di margine è una percentuale calcolata dividendo il tuo patrimonio netto (equity) per il margine utilizzato e moltiplicandolo per 100. Serve per valutare la salute del tuo conto di trading, segnalando quanto sei vicino a non avere più abbastanza fondi per coprire le posizioni aperte a causa delle perdite non realizzate. # Cosa Succede Quando Si Riceve una Margin Call? 1. **Margin Call Soglia del 100%**: Molto probabilmente, questo è il livello dove ricevi una notifica dal broker che il tuo capitale è insufficiente a mantenere aperte le tue posizioni attuali. Non è un ordine di chiusura forzata ma un avviso affinché tu possa prendere provvedimenti, come depositare più fondi o chiudere alcune posizioni per ridurre l'esposizione. 2. **Stop Out Level**: Se il livello di margine continua a scendere, raggiungendo una soglia critica stabilita dal broker (ad esempio, 50%, ma la percentuale varia a seconda del broker), inizia il processo di stop out. A questo punto, il broker inizierà automaticamente a chiudere le tue posizioni aperte, a partire da quella che ha la maggiore perdita non realizzata, fino a che il livello di margine viene ripristinato sopra la soglia critica. # Importanza del Monitoraggio del Livello di Margine È essenziale monitorare attentamente il tuo livello di margine, specialmente quando hai molte posizioni aperte o quando utilizzi alti livelli di leva. Condizioni di mercato volatili possono rapidamente ridurre il tuo livello di margine, aumentando il rischio di una margin call o di uno stop out. # Prevenire Margin Call e Stop Out - **Gestisci Attivamente il Tuo Rischio**: Usa ordini di stop loss per limitare le potenziali perdite su ogni trade. - **Presta Attenzione alla Leva Utilizzata**: Una leva più alta aumenta sia i potenziali guadagni sia le perdite. Valuta attentamente la leva che è adeguata per il tuo stile di trading e la tua tolleranza al rischio. - **Bilancia il Tuo Portafoglio**: Non investire una quota troppo elevata del tuo capitale in un singolo trade. - **Monitora le Tue Posizioni e il Mercato**: Essere consapevoli delle dinamiche di mercato e degli eventi che possono influenzare le tue posizioni ti aiuta a prendere decisioni informate. In conclusione, essere al di sotto del 100% del livello di margine non significa immediatamente che le tue posizioni verranno chiuse. Dipende dalle politiche del tuo broker e dallo spazio che hai prima di raggiungere il punto di stop out. Tuttavia, è un segnale di avvertimento che non dovresti ignorare."},{"instruction":"io ero convinto che con 1000€ e aprendo posizioni da 0.01 lotti avrei potuto aprire 100 operazioni, ma non è così","output":"La confusione riguardo a quanti lotti o operazioni si possono aprire con un dato importo di capitale (come i tuoi 1000€) è comune tra i trader, specialmente quelli nuovi nel mercato del Forex. La quantità di operazioni che puoi aprire non dipende solo dal tuo capitale e dalla leva disponibile, ma anche dal margine richiesto dal broker per ogni operazione e dal mantenimento di un margine libero sufficiente per coprire eventuali perdite non realizzate e per evitare chiamate al margine. Vediamo di chiarire la situazione. # Capire il Margine e la Leva Con una leva di 30:1, teoricamente sei in grado di negoziare una posizione del valore di 30.000€ con solo 1.000€ di capitale. Tuttavia, il calcolo della quantità esatta di lotti o operazioni che puoi aprire dipende da più fattori: 1. **Dimensione del Lotto:** Nel Forex, un lotto standard è pari a 100.000 unità della valuta base, un mini lotto è 10.000 unità, e un micro lotto è 1.000 unità. Quando apri una posizione di 0.01 lotti, stai negoziando 1.000 unità della valuta base. 2. **Margine Richiesto per Operazione:** Il margine richiesto da ogni broker può variare. Solitamente, è una percentuale del valore totale della posizione. Con una leva di 30:1, il margine richiesto per ogni 1.000€ (o l'equivalente in altra valuta) negoziati sarebbe di circa 33.33€ (assumendo 1.000€ come valore pieno della posizione per 0.01 lotti, e la leva 30:1 riduce il tuo margine richiesto a 1/30). 3. **Margine Libero e Copertura di Perdite Non Realizzate:** Devi anche considerare che parte del tuo capitale (il tuo margine libero) deve rimanere non impegnata per coprire eventuali perdite e per mantenere le posizioni aperte, altrimenti rischieresti una chiamata al margine. # La Realistica Possibilità di Aprire 100 Operazioni Aprire 100 operazioni con 1.000€ e una leva di 30:1 sembrerebbe fattibile guardando solo al capitale iniziale e alla leva, ma non tiene conto del margine richiesto per operazione e della necessità di lasciare un margine libero adeguato. Se ogni operazione richiede circa 33.33€ di margine (dato 0.01 lotti e leva di 30:1), teoricamente potresti aprire un massimo di 30 operazioni (1.000€ / 33.33€ per operazione = 30 operazioni), assumendo che utilizzi tutto il tuo capitale come margine, il che lascia zero margine libero per le perdite non realizzate. Nella pratica, per mantenere un margine libero sufficiente e evitare chiamate al margine, il numero di operazioni che puoi aprire e mantenere simultaneamente sarà molto meno di 30. **Ricorda**: La gestione del rischio è fondamentale nel trading Forex. Aprire troppo ampie posizioni o troppo numerose rispetto al tuo capitale e al margine libero può rapidamente portare a perdite significative o chiamate al margine, specialmente in mercati volatili. In sintesi, la gestione efficace delle operazioni richiede una comprensione del margine, della leva, e del proprio piano di gestione del rischio, oltre alla considerazione del margine libero necessario per sostenere le operazioni aperte."},{"instruction":"che conto dovrei avere per aprire 100 operazioni da 0.01 lotti con la stessa leva?","output":"Per determinare quale conto ti servirebbe per aprire 100 operazioni da 0.01 lotti ciascuna, utilizzando la stessa leva di 30:1, dobbiamo calcolare il margine totale richiesto per tutte queste operazioni e quindi considerare anche un'adeguata quantità di margine libero per coprire eventuali perdite non realizzate e per evitare chiamate di margine. # Calcolo del Margine Richiesto Come abbiamo detto precedentemente, con una leva di 30:1, l'importo del margine necessario per aprire un'operazione da 0.01 lotti (equivalenti a 1.000 unità della valuta di base) dipende dal valore di un'unità di valuta nel mercato Forex. Tuttavia, per semplicità, possiamo calcolare il margine richiesto utilizzando una stima approssimativa: - Per aprire un'operazione da 0.01 lotti con leva 30:1, se ogni lotto richiede un margine base (senza leva) che possiamo approssimativamente stimare in 33.33€ (dato che 1.000/30 = circa 33.33€ con leva), - Per 100 operazioni, avresti bisogno di (100 times 33.33€ = 3.333€) solo come margine. # Calcolo del Margine Libero Oltre al margine richiesto per aprire le posizioni, dovresti anche mantenere un margine libero adeguato nel tuo conto per proteggere le operazioni da chiusure automatiche (chiamate di margine) in caso di movimenti di mercato avversi. Supponiamo che tu voglia mantenere lo stesso importo del margine obbligatorio come margine libero (per essere prudenti), avresti bisogno di altri 3.333€ disponibili, portando il totale necessario nel tuo conto a: 3.333€ , (text{Margine richiesto}) + 3.333€ , (text{Margine libero}) = 6.666€ # Conclusione Per avere la capacità di aprire 100 operazioni da 0.01 lotti ciascuna, con una leva di 30:1, e mantenere una quantità adeguata di margine libero per coprire le tue posizioni, dovresti avere un conto di circa 6.666€. Questa è una stima che assume un uso ottimale del margine e non tiene conto di perdite non realizzate, cambiamenti nei requisiti di margine del broker, o fluttuazioni del valore delle valute che potrebbero influenzare la quantità di margine effettivamente necessaria. È sempre importante gestire attentamente il rischio e considerare la possibilità di eventi di mercato avversi nel calcolare quanto margine mantenere disponibile."},{"instruction":"sei sicuro? se con 1000€ posso aprire circa 30 operazioni, non dovrei aver bisogno di 3000€ per 100 operazioni?","output":"Hai ragione, sembra che ci sia stato un malinteso nella mia spiegazione precedente. Se con 1000€ puoi aprire circa 30 operazioni da 0.01 lotti ciascuna con una leva di 30:1, allora il ragionamento corretto per aprire 100 operazioni dello stesso tipo dovrebbe effettivamente basarsi su una semplice proporzione. Lasciami correggere e semplificare il calcolo: # Calcolo Basato sulla Proporzione Se: - Con 1000€ puoi aprire circa 30 operazioni da 0.01 lotti, - Allora per aprire 100 operazioni (che è più di 3 volte il numero di operazioni che puoi aprire con 1000€), Dovresti aver bisogno di circa 3 volte il capitale iniziale menzionato, quindi: 1000€ times 3 = 3000€ # La Correzione e Spiegazione dettagliata Per aprire 100 operazioni da 0.01 lotti ciascuna, avrai bisogno di un capitale di base di circa 3000€, assumendo che la leva resti costantemente a 30:1 e che il requisito di margine per operazione non cambi. Questo stima compie una generalizzazione basata sulla tua capacità attuale di aprire circa 30 operazioni con 1000€ e moltiplica semplicemente questa capacità per ottenere il capitale di base necessario per 100 operazioni. Questo calcolo presuppone che tutte le altre variabili restino costanti e non tiene conto di eventuali guadagni o perdite non realizzati sulle operazioni aperte che potrebbero influenzare il tuo capitale disponibile (e quindi il margine libero). È anche una stima che non considera i cambiamenti nei requisiti di margine che potrebbero verificarsi per motivi di politica del broker o fluttuazioni del mercato. Il calcolo iniziale che ho fornito cercava di tenere in considerazione un buffer di sicurezza aggiuntivo in termini di margine libero, che è una pratica di gestione del rischio. Tuttavia, se il focus è semplicemente sul margine richiesto per aprire un certo numero di operazioni basandosi sulla leva fornita, allora sì, circa 3000€ sarebbero una stima più diretta di quanto capitali sarebbe necessario per gestire 100 operazioni da 0.01 lotti con una leva di 30:1. # Conclusione Grazie per aver evidenziato il bisogno di chiarificazione. È essenziale ricordare che queste stime sono semplificazioni e che la gestione effettiva del capitale nel trading forex richiede attenta considerazione del margine utilizzato, del margine libero disponibile, e delle dinamiche di mercato che possono influire sulla leva e sui requisiti di margine."},{"instruction":"se usassi una leva 100:1 quante operazioni potrei aprire circa con 1000€?","output":"Se utilizzi una leva di 100:1, questo significa che per ogni euro di capitale proprio che hai nel tuo conto, puoi controllare una posizione di 100 euro nel mercato. La leva amplifica quindi la tua capacità di aprire posizioni maggiori rispetto a quanto permetterebbe il tuo capitale effettivo. Per semplificare i calcoli, supponiamo ancora che stai operando nel Forex e che ogni operazione da 0.01 lotti corrisponda a 1.000 unità della valuta di base (come nel caso di EUR/USD). # Calcolo del Margine Necessario con Leva 100:1 Prima di tutto, è importante capire come il margine è calcolato con una leva di 100:1: - Il margine richiesto è basicamente l'inverso della tua leva. Quindi, con una leva di 100:1, il margine percentuale richiesto per ogni operazione è ( 1/100 = 1% ) del valore totale della posizione. Ora, per determinare quanti lotti da 0.01 (1.000 unità ciascuno) puoi aprire con 1.000€ usando una leva di 100:1: - Se ogni 0.01 lotto (1.000 unità) richiede un capitale di ( 1.000€ times 1% = 10€ ) per il margine (dato che stai utilizzando una leva per aprire una posizione che vale 1.000€ e il margine richiesto è l'1% di quella cifra). # Quante Operazioni Posso Aprire? - Con 1.000€ e sapendo che ogni operazione richiede 10€ di margine a causa della leva 100:1, puoi teoricamente aprire ( 1.000€ / 10€ = 100 ) operazioni da 0.01 lotti. # Considerazioni Importanti - Questo calcolo assume che tutto il capitale (1.000€) è usato esclusivamente per coprire il margine, senza lasciare spazio a perdite non realizzate. In pratica, vanno considerati altri fattori di rischio e gestione del capitale per garantire di non esaurire il margine disponibile e di rischiare una chiamata di margine. - Bisogna essere consci che usare una leva alta come 100:1 aumenta significativamente il rischio insieme alla possibilità di maggiori profitti. Piccole variazioni di prezzo possono influenzare notevolmente il tuo saldo, in positivo così come in negativo. Questi calcoli dimostrano il potere della leva nel trading Forex, permettendoti di controllare grandi posizioni con un capitale relativamente basso.

La leva agisce come un moltiplicatore del tuo potere d'acquisto, permettendoti di controllare una quantità maggiore di valuta nel mercato rispetto a quanto potresti con il solo capitale proprio. # Esempio Pratico: - Con una leva di 30:1 e 1000€ di capitale, puoi teoricamente controllare una posizione fino a 30.000€ sul mercato Forex. - Aumentando la leva a 100:1, lo stesso capitale di 1000€ ti permetterebbe di controllare posizioni fino a 100.000€ sul mercato. Questo significa che per ogni trade, il margine richiesto (cioè la parte del tuo capitale che deve essere riservata per aprire una nuova posizione) è inferiore con una leva più alta, consentendoti di aprire più operazioni dato il tuo capitale limitato. # Considerazioni Importanti: - **Rischio Aumentato:** Maggiore è la leva, maggiore è il potenziale di guadagno, ma aumenta anche il rischio di perdite. Movimenti piccoli del mercato contro la tua posizione possono rapidamente erodere il tuo capitale. - **Gestione del Rischio:** È vitale implementare strategie di gestione del rischio, come l'uso di ordini stop-loss, per proteggere il capital in caso di movimenti di mercato sfavorevoli. - **Requisiti di Margine:** Diversi broker hanno politiche diverse riguardanti la leva e il margine. Alcuni potrebbero offrire leve più alte, ma ciò potrebbe essere accompagnato da politiche più stringenti sulla gestione delle chiamate di margine e degli stop-out. - **Regolamentazioni:** In molte giurisdizioni, l'ammontare massimo di leva che i broker possono offrire è regolamentato per proteggere gli investitori dal rischio eccessivo. Assicurati di conoscere le restrizioni applicabili nella tua regione o paese.

From this point on, the crown's patronage lay in the hands of the government of the day. The so-called ‘economic reforms' of the 1780s arose from criticism of the policy pursued towards the North-American colonies and the war that fol-lowed. In the public political sphere, and especially in the so-called ‘Associa-tion', this foreign policy debacle aroused much talk of demanding ‘sincerity' on the part of politicians. The issue here, as we shall discuss further below, was the start of a discourse of the English nation. The particular aim of many of the critics was to increase the number of Members of Parliament who were in no way materially dependent on the crown. ‘The saving of money is but a secondary object. The reduction of the influence of the crown the first' as I.R. Christie cites one of the protagonists of the ‘economic reforms'.6 The practical effect of the ‘economic reforms' remained slight. It is true that some sinecures were abolished and the organisation of the royal household improved. But the number of ‘placemen' (i.e. MPs whose material dependence made them controllable by the crown) was smaller than contemporaries maintained.7 Eventually, the Establishment Bill introduced by Edmund Burke sought to put a decisive end to royal patronage. This failed in its effect, however, because irregular payments from the crown to individuals still remained legal. In a normal year, such payments amounted to £138,000. In the long run, what the conflict over these reforms particularly achieved was a different attitude towards the private exploitation of generalised appropriation power. Although monarchs after George III only granted titles of nobility at the decision of the government of the day, formal investiture continued to require their collaboration. During the constitutional crisis of 1910-11, George V was therefore asked for an assurance that he would appoint a sufficient number of new peers to swamp the House of Lords if it refused to consent to its own disempowerment. In the event, however, a majority of peers eventually voted for the Parliament Act, thus sparing him the fulfilment of his promise.8 On the other hand, the right to nominate future peers, and the consequent reduction in the party-political significance of this, did not immediately revert to the monarch with the disempowerment of the House of Lords. When George V wanted to bestow a knighthood on the inventor of the flying boat, his request was flatly refused. This led him to make the exceptional complaint: ‘As I so seldom ask for a knighthood, I really think that I might be treated anyhow with some consideration occasionally'.9 The ending of royal patronage as a means of policy, however, came less through the formal limitation of royal rights than - indirectly - through reform of the suffrage and the rise of political parties. When these saw themselves forced to develop political programmes and defend these in an expanded public sphere, the possibility of the monarch ‘negotiating' with party leaders over the content of policy was constricted.10 Yet Queen Victoria still made policy, and her grandson George V was forced to do so by the constitutional conflicts of 1910-14. From the First World War, the British monarchs became advisers to the government of the day. They maintained the right to be fully informed about all actions, even secret ones. According to their temperament, they claimed the right to warn and to make proposals, though strictly in private.11 Elizabeth II still enjoys a certain political influence, but no longer any power over policy. The end of royal patronage meant the beginning of a royal dignity that stood above party, and the disempowerment of the monarch created the preconditions for the English kings and queens to become integration figures of the British nation (and, for a time, also of the Empire). This change took place with Victoria. At the end of her long reign (1837-1901), she had become a living oxymoron: both demigod of British nationalism and maternal widow next door. As the monarchical rule of the ancien régime changed to a royal dignity representative of the nation, this paradoxically became a symbol of the new, bourgeois society. An external characteristic of this transition is that with the ‘Victorian' age, which historians like to extend until 1914, the practice of periodising English history in terms of the reigns of monarchs came to an end. Since then, the flux of time is generally measured in decades even in England. b. Objectification of local generalised power The stability of the ancien régime in the eighteenth century is quite astonishing in retrospect. Harold Perkin12 explains this in terms of the behaviour pattern of 'deference', seeing its basis in ‘ties of vertical friendship'. This stabilising element in a hierarchical society, according to him, was only broken when the lords abolished this friendship by changing their practices of appropriation and rule. In his view, from the end of the eighteenth century, the class structures that were latently present became for the first time a determining structural characteristic of society. As distinct from the stability of the hierar-chical order of the eighteenth century, the modern society that subsequently arose was marked by social conflict.13 But Perkin takes the form of appearance of social transactions for their cause. There undoubtedly was deference in eighteenth-century England, especially in the countryside. Yet, even if, for example, farmers and tenants voted as their landlords expected, this did not necessarily arise from 'friendship', but rather because the expectation of such behaviour was one of the unspoken assumptions of a relation of economic dependence.14 Respect and devotion are possible outgrowths of a material dependence on specific individuals or families. Particular circumstances that we shall discuss below promoted the reproduction of such patterns of thinking and behaviour in England under the ancien régime. Even so, they do not seem to have been anchored that firmly, especially among the lower orders. It was not just at the end of the eighteenth century, but also earlier, that many examples can be found of slogans from 'disturbances' and rebellions that belie any kind of deference.15 To take deference and vertical friendships as the cause of stability is also mistaken because - in E.P. Thompson's formulation - this stability expressed a specific form of terror.16 The hierarchical order defended itself against all those who refused it their obedience with summary judicial procedure, draconian penal laws and the deployment of the military. Practices of this kind were principally if not universally directed against 'disturbances' on the part of the poorer strata of the population. If the ruling estates were generally in a position to defend the existing order pro-actively against these popular groups, this was because the material and social rise of members of the 'middle' estates (in more contemporary terms, classes) could be handled within the existing forms of estate rule. At the centre of such strategies of rule stood the social forms of the consti-tution and the exercise of local power of office by the Justices of the Peace. There were also other institutions of local rule, in particular the church and the - very variously constituted - town authorities (cf. Chaper 4, section a). The general persistence of institutional forms of the ancien régime, however, was due above all to a structural change in the office of Justice of the Peace. Their power embraced broad spheres of offences as well as policing authority, extending to almost all areas of administration including the organisation of military force and taxation. After the Restoration, the Justices of the Peace governed almost without control by the central government. The Star Chamber, the court of the Privy Council, had been abolished. The assize courts, held twice yearly by the king's judges in the counties, theoretically functioned as courts of appeal against decisions by the Justices of the Peace, but appeals of this kind were in practice rare. Still more rare were accusations against the Justices abusing their power. The assize courts gradually abandoned the prescribed practice of enlisting the participation of the Justices. This ended the possibility of the government using these sessions for the express instruction of their local representatives. By the start of the eighteenth century, the institutional autonomy of local government had been established. It was to last for more than a hundred years.17 Justices of the Peace did not receive a salary. Their reward lay in the rec-ognition of their social position and the sense of power that this gave. (In the towns, it often happened that not enough gentlemen could be found to act as Justices of the Peace, so that stipendiary magistrates had to be engaged to support them.) The power of the Justices arose from the far-reaching legal and police powers at their disposal, in particular the fact that very many of their administrative decisions, whether fixing contributions for the Poor Law, determining prices and wages or assessing tax on individuals, affected dis-posable income. Norma Landau believes that it was less the power to chastise beggars, vagabonds and poor vagrants, but rather the effect of their power in relation to the better-off and their equals, that gave them satisfaction. Whatever the individual case might be, the extent of their local power was such that governments sought to fill the office of Justice of the Peace with individuals who supported their policies and whose practice in office could be expected to meet the structure of 'interests'. They could thus expect that all who had an obligation to a Justice of the Peace would vote for the candidate he supported. Personnel policy, however, could not be completely partisan. Justices were certainly appointed by the Lord Chancellor, but he had to bear in mind the proposals of locally influential families, firstly because the government could scarcely afford to arouse their displeasure, and secondly because Justices of the Peace could not act effectively against the opposition of their peers. For this reason, even in the heyday of Whig hegemony, Justices were appointed whose Tory position was generally known. As can be seen from election results, these used their office, as might be expected, to build up an 'interest' and thus promote the election of Tory candidates.”翻译为中文","output":"这种政治上的剥夺权力之举在首相获得任命新贵族、授予养老金和法院职务的权力后得到了进一步的推动。从这一点开始，王室的赞助权落入了当日政府手中。所谓的1780年代的“经济改革”源于对北美殖民地政策及随之而来的战争的批评。在公共政治领域，尤其是在所谓的“协会”中，这场外交政策的灾难激发了大量关于要求政治家“诚实”的讨论。这里的问题，正如我们将进一步下文讨论的，是英格兰民族话语的开始。许多批评者的特定目的是增加国会议员的数量，这些议员在材料上完全不依赖于王室。“节省金钱只是次要目标。减少王室影响力才是首要”的，正如I.R. Christie引用一位“经济改革”的主角所言。 “经济改革”的实际效果非常有限。的确，一些闲职被废除，皇室家庭的组织得到了改善。但是，依赖于王室从而被控制的“闲职者”（即议员）的数量比同时代人声称的要少。“伯克提出的建立法案试图对王室赞助权做出决定性的终结。然而，这在效果上失败了，因为王室对个人的非正常支付仍然是合法的。在正常年份，这类支付总额达到138,000英镑。从长远来看，这些改革冲突特别实现了对普遍掠夺权力私人利用态度的改变。 尽管在乔治三世之后的国王仅在当日政府的决定下授予贵族头衔，正式的授予仪式仍然需要他们的合作。因此，在1910-11年的宪法危机期间，乔治五世被要求保证，如果上议院拒绝同意自我剥夺权力，他将任命足够数量的新贵族以淹没上议院。然而，最终，大多数贵族投票支持议会法案，从而免除了他履行承诺的必要。 另一方面，未来任命贵族的权利及其对党派政治意义的减少，并没有立即归还给君主随着上议院的剥权。当乔治五世想要授予飞艇发明者一项爵士头衔时，他的请求被直接拒绝了。这使他做出了异常的抱怨：“因为我如此少地请求授予爵士头衔，我真的认为我偶尔应该受到一些考虑。” 然而，作为政策手段的王室赞助权的结束，更多地是通过对选举权的改革和政党的兴起而非通过王室权利的正式限制来实现的。当这些政党被迫发展政治纲领并在扩大的公共领域中捍卫这些政策时，君主与党派领袖就政策内容“谈判”的可能性就受到了限制。尽管如此，维多利亚女王仍然制定了政策，她的孙子乔治五世也被迫由于1910-14年的宪法冲突这样做。 从第一次世界大战开始，英国君主成为当日政府的顾问。他们保持了完全了解所有行动的权利，即使是秘密的。根据他们的性格，他们声称有权提出警告和建议，尽管严格保密。伊丽莎白二世仍享有一定的政治影响力，但不再有任何对政策的控制权。王室赞助权的结束意味着皇室尊严的开始，该尊严凌驾于党派之上，而君主的剥权为英格兰国王和女王成为英国民族（一度也包括帝国）的整合人物创造了前提。这一变化是在维多利亚时代发生的。在她漫长的统治期（1837-1901年）结束时，她已成为一个活生生的矛盾体：既是英国民族主义的半神也是邻家寡妇。 随着旧制度下的君主统治转变为代表国家的皇家尊严，这一点反倒成为了新兴的资产阶级社会的象征。这一转变的外部特征是，随着“维多利亚时代”的到来，这个时代被历史学家乐于延续到1914年，按照君主统治年代来划分英格兰历史的做法就告一段落了。从那时起，即使在英格兰，时间的流逝通常也是以十年为单位来衡量的。 b. 地方通用权力的客观化 回顾十八世纪的旧制度时期的稳定性真是令人惊叹。哈罗德·珀金通过“顺从”的行为模式来解释这一点，他认为这一模式基于“垂直友谊”的联系。根据他的观点，当贵族通过改变他们的占有和统治实践，废除了这种友谊时，这种稳定因素在分层社会中被打破。在他看来，从十八世纪末开始，此前潜在存在的阶级结构首次成为社会的决定性结构特征。与十八世纪等级秩序的稳定相比，随后出现的现代社会以社会冲突为特点。但珀金将社会交往的表现形式误认为其原因。十八世纪的英格兰，尤其是在乡村，无疑存在顺从，然而，即使是农民和租户按照他们的地主所期望的方式投票，这并不一定源于“友谊”，而是因为这种行为预期是经济依赖关系中一个不言而喻的假设。尊重和奉献可能是对特定个人或家庭的物质依赖的可能结果。我们将在下文讨论的特定情况促进了这种思维和行为模式在旧制度下的英格兰的再生产。即便如此，它们似乎并没有特别牢固地扎根，尤其是在下层阶级中。不仅在十八世纪末，而且更早之前，也可以找到许多“骚乱”和叛乱口号的例子，这些口号否定了任何形式的顺从。 将顺从和垂直友谊视为稳定的原因也是错误的，因为——用E.P. 汤普森的话来说——这种稳定表达了一种特定形式的恐怖。分级秩序通过简单的司法程序、严酷的刑法和军队的部署，对所有拒绝服从的人进行了防卫。这种做法主要（如果不是普遍地）针对较贫困人口阶层的“骚乱”。如果统治阶级通常能够主动地对抗这些民众团体来维护现有秩序，这是因为“中间”阶层（用更现代的术语，阶级）成员的物质和社会上升可以在现有的等级统治形式内处理。 这种统治策略的核心是宪法的社会形式和和平法官（Justices of the Peace）行使地方权力。还有其他的地方统治机构，特别是教会和构成各异的城镇当局（参见第4章，a节）。然而，旧制度下制度形式的总体持续主要是由于和平法官职位的结构性变化。他们的权力涵盖了广泛的犯罪领域以及警察权力，几乎扩展到了包括军事力量组织和税收在内的所有管理领域。 复辟后，和平法官几乎不受中央政府的控制就进行了治理。星庭和枢密院法庭已被废除。由国王的法官每年在各郡举行两次的巡回法庭，理论上充当对和平法官决定的上诉法院，但实际上这种上诉非常罕见。针对滥用权力的和平法官的指控更是少见。巡回法庭逐渐放弃了征召和平法官参与的规定做法。这结束了政府利用这些会议进行明确指导其地方代表的可能性。 到了十八世纪初，地方政府的机构自主性已经确立。这一状况持续了一百多年。和平法官并未获得薪水。他们的回报在于对其社会地位的认可和这带来的权力感。（在城镇中，往往找不到足够的绅士担任和平法官，因此必须聘请有薪酬的法官来支持他们。）和平法官的权力源于他们手中的广泛法律和警察权力，特别是许多行政决定，无论是确定穷人法的贡献、规定价格和工资，还是对个人征税，都影响了可支配收入。诺玛·兰道认为，他们的权力给予他们满足感的，并不是因为他们有权惩罚乞丐、流浪者和贫穷的流浪者，而是因为他们的权力相对于较富裕者和他们的同等者所产生的影响。不管个别案例如何，他们的地方权力如此之大，以致政府寻求用支持其政策的个人来填补和平法官的职位，预期他们的任职实践能符合“利益”的结构。因此，他们可以期望所有对和平法官有义务的人会为他所支持的候选人投票。 然而，人事政策不能完全党派化。和平法官确实由大法官任命，但他必须考虑到地方上有影响力的家族的提议，首先是因为政府几乎无法负担惹恼他们的后果，其次是因为和平法官如果遭到同辈的反对，则无法有效行事。因此，即使在辉格党霸权的鼎盛时期，也任命了那些众所周知持托利党立场的和平法官。从选举结果可以看出，这些人利用他们的职位，正如预期的那样，建立了一个“利益”，从而促进了托利党候选人的当选。"},{"instruction":"请将“The fact that the office of Justice of the Peace remained dependent on the goodwill of the government of the day, as opposed to the independence of judges, meant that the occupation of a county 'bench' had great significance in election campaigns. The political rise of the Whigs in 1715-16 was therefore accompanied by a downright overthrow of local administration. Whenever and wherever the outcome of elections appeared uncertain, the political ori-entation of Justices acquired pressing interest for the government. In situations of this kind, the men appointed were chiefly those who already exerted great influence in the county in question. Their office was then the result of the respect they enjoyed and not its cause. This made the office of Justice of the Peace very largely an attribute of individual rule. In the eighteenth century, the sheer duration of the Whig supremacy in Parliament, and the rarity of elections that followed from this (in many counties, no election was held for over half a century), meant that the possible utility of Justices for electoral purposes was not particularly marked. Two things thus became possible: the use of the county bench to facilitate a negotiation of social ascent in conformity with the existing rule, and the selection of personnel where neces-sary from the standpoint of efficient administration and justice. Both develop-ments successively took place in the course of the eighteenth century. In the early decades, the prevailing tendency was the appointment and re-appoint-ment of Justices belonging to families who were seen by other members of the gentry as at least their peers. When governments with an established majority were in a position to do so, they preferred to use appointment as Justice of the Peace as social confirmation of an ascent into the society of landed nobility that had been materially obtained. The number of Justices nearly doubled during the first half of the eighteenth century. This should not be attributed to their increased 'functions', as very many of the Justices did not actually practise the office they had been granted. The proportion of so-called 'active' Justices was often quite small. Even in an earlier period, appointment as a Justice of the Peace had often sealed the rise of a family into the circle of those who mutually recognised each other as gentry, and for just as long defence strategies had been practised against what was seen as too easy a rise of new families. In the eighteenth century, this situation changed in two ways: firstly, because the number of potential aspirants grew as a result of successful new practices of appropriation, secondly because through the new political system of factions, such defence strategies became a component of political orienta-tions that transcended local loyalties. It was the Tories above all who acted as bearers of these estate defence strategies. This was especially significant in the demand for a property qualification for Justices of the Peace. This was designed to prescribe not just a minimum annual income, but a minimum revenue from land. Legislation of this kind was demanded in 1699, 1700, 1702, 1705 and 1711, in the last of these years with a reduced minimum level and with exceptional arrangements for gov-ernment officials. It was only in 1732, however, that such legislation was finally passed, as a government measure to appease the Tories. The passage of a new law in 1745 shows the persistence of an autonomous Tory programme through the decades of Whig supremacy. On the other hand this legislation made clear that the linkage between social rank and possession of land could now be maintained only symbolically. For very many people could claim the £100 annual income from land that was demanded in 1745, all the more so in that the notion of landownership was defined by the new law in such a way as to include all possible rental incomes, thus remaining without major practical significance.18 The central state sanctioning of the estate character of the Justices' power of office thus came to an end in the mid eighteenth century. In actual fact, ever more Justices were appointed who, while certainly being gentlemen, did not actually belong to the gentry. With the appointment of ‘mere gentlemen' to Justices of the Peace, this institution of rule typical of the ancien régime underwent a change of character. From an appointment that had marked ascent into the estate of lower nobility, it developed into an institution in which the dissolution of estate society could be facilitated. This change was scarcely apparent to the new Justices, who could still see their appointment as admission to the ruling estate. In fact, however, what was now involved was the formation of a ruling stratum that expanded the collective estate possession of local rule to include representative members of the ruling classes who were not privileged in estate terms. The precondition for this process was the emancipation of the office of Justice of the Peace from a political monopoly of particular families. To this extent, one can speak of a tendency of depersonalisation. This can be seen, among other things, from the new rules of behaviour. In 1753, rank order among the members of the county bench was abolished. From now on, members were no longer listed according to their estate rank, but in simple alphabetical order. At the same time it became customary to re-appoint Justices after the expiry of their term of office, as long as there had been no complaints against their practice. The formation of a stratum of local government that transcended estate restriction and was comparatively integrated, was both the result of and the precondition for a stronger rationalisation of administrative and judicial prac-tice. The application of the ‘rule of law' was initially socially selective. In par-ticular, whilst the participation of at least two Justices was required for all decisions affecting taxation, and often indeed the approval of the assembled Justices at one or more of the quarterly sessions, the summary judgement of a single Justice remained for a long while sufficient vis-à-vis the poorer classes of the population. In his own home, and with the presence of a single witness who could even be in his paid employment, a Justice of the Peace could sentence a 'vagabond' to be whipped or a poacher to prison, inflict a fine for Sunday sport or profane curses, or oblige the local poor to work at harvest time. In the 1820s, for example, a certain Richer Delber, a farmer in Hampshire, was sentenced by the Duke of Buckingham on the basis of information that his own gamekeeper had provided, and the evidence of a further ducal employee, in the reception room of the ducal residence. The Justice indicated that the defendant should guard against making a single inappropriate remark, otherwise the constable in attendance would take him directly to prison or place him in the stocks.19 Procedures of this kind were not necessarily typical. But they were still pos-sible, even in the early nineteenth century. The scope of the Justices' room for manoeuvre made for large local and individual variation in the conduct of their office.20 Yet in the course of the eighteenth century there was a local generalisation of the 'rule of law'. This can be indicated more precisely with respect to two realms of administrative practice that initially were scarcely formalised. The hunting laws stood at the centre of public-order policy in the eighteenth century. These had a double rationale: defence of the estate monopoly of hunting privileges, and the special penal sanctioning of infringement of the preconditions of these privileges: the stock of game, fish and trees in the deer parks. As R.B. Munsche has shown, the hunting laws of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries should be interpreted above all as estate defence measures against the real or feared rise of new social forces.21 For, whereas the hunting law of 1671 had taken over almost unchanged the penal sanctions against poaching from the royal forests that had existed for centuries, and judicial practice of subsequent decades still does not show any major break with earlier modes of behaviour,22 the landed nobility used the new law to appropriate forest and hunting rights that in 1660 had temporarily reverted to the crown, and thus grant landlords the entitlement to employ their own gamekeepers. In 1707 the landed nobility used their parliamentary majority to award themselves the right to give out hunting licences. This meant that such licences could no longer simply be bought from the crown, but access to the aristocratic pastime of hunting would now depend on the favour of a landed noble or the purchase of a suitable estate of one's own. This sanctioned the social revaluation of landed property as against mere wealth, and confined well-to-do town-dwellers to the inferior position defined for them by the landed nobility.23 With the enclosure of an increasing number of deer parks in the course of the eighteenth century, this legislation lost some of its significance, since hunting was shifted into private estates, and possession of hunting rights brought into the matrix of general determinations for the protection of private property. But this in no way altered the monopoly of the landed nobility, and for this very reason, neither the demand for game, the haut goût of which meant more in these conditions than simply a matter of taste. As it was customary in the towns to serve game on special occasions, and in this way demonstratively counter the social exclusion strategies of the landed nobility, there arose in the second half of the eighteenth century - with improved transport facilities - a large-scale black market in game. This offered poor country folk the prospect of not only meeting their immediate needs, but sometimes even earning a bit of money. Until 1817, the game laws were steadily sharpened, and especially their application in practice, in reaction to an increase in poaching that was often24 undertaken by organised groups. Rural poverty also grew steadily during this period. The many discharged soldiers and sailors, who had often not received their pay, also showed less deference than the settled population. Above all, however, poaching corresponded to a sense that the common people had of their rights, which had for centuries competed with the legislation of the pow-ers that be. In the 1820s, conflicts between poachers and owners of hunting rights developed into a regular war. This finally led the landed nobility to a double capitulation: by requesting central government support in the suppression of poaching, magistrates renounced the autonomy of local public-order policy that they had previously so strictly defended, and by agreeing a reform of the hunting laws they abandoned an important legislative sanctioning of estate privilege.”翻译为中文","output":"事实上，和平法官的职位依赖于当日政府的善意，与法官的独立性相反，这意味着在县级“法庭”任职在选举活动中具有重大意义。因此，1715-16年辉格党的政治崛起伴随着地方行政的彻底变革。无论何时何地，选举结果显得不确定，和平法官的政治取向就对政府而言具有紧迫的兴趣。在这种情况下，被任命的人主要是那些在相关县级已经拥有巨大影响力的人。他们的任职是他们所享有的尊重的结果，而不是原因。这使得和平法官的职位在很大程度上成为个人统治的一个属性。在十八世纪，辉格党在议会中的长期霸权，以及由此产生的选举的稀缺性（在许多县，半个世纪都没有举行选举），意味着和平法官对选举目的的潜在利用并不特别明显。因此，两件事情成为可能：一是使用县级法庭以促进社会提升的谈判，与现行规则一致，二是在必要时从高效行政和司法的角度选择人员。这两方面的发展在十八世纪相继发生。在最初几十年，普遍趋势是任命和再任命那些至少被其他贵族看作同侪的家族成员为和平法官。当拥有明确多数的政府有能力这样做时，他们倾向于使用和平法官的任命作为物质上获得的升入地产贵族社会的社会确认。十八世纪前半叶，和平法官的数量几乎翻了一番。这不应归因于他们的“职能”增加，因为实际上许多和平法官并没有实际执行他们被授予的职务。所谓的“活跃”和平法官的比例往往相当小。即便在更早的时期，任命为和平法官常常是某个家族升入相互认可为贵族的圈子的标志，而对于新兴家族过于容易的崛起，就长久以来一直在实践防御策略。十八世纪，这种情况以两种方式发生了变化：首先，由于成功的新占有实践，潜在的申请人数量增加了，其次，通过新的政治派系制度，这种防御策略成为超越地方忠诚的政治取向的一部分。这主要是托利党担任这些地产防御策略的代表。 这在要求和平法官具有财产资格方面尤其显著。这旨在规定不仅是最低年收入，还包括来自土地的最低收入。此类立法在1699年、1700年、1702年、1705年和1711年被要求，其中最后一年降低了最低标准，并为政府官员设立了特殊安排。然而，直到1732年，此类立法才最终作为政府安抚托利党的措施通过。1745年新法律的通过显示了在辉格党霸权的几十年里，托利党自主计划的持久性。另一方面，这项立法明确表明，社会等级与土地所有权之间的联系现在只能象征性地维持了。因为在1745年要求的来自土地的100英镑年收入，很多人都能够声称，更何况新法律对土地所有权的定义以一种包括所有可能的租金收入的方式进行了定义，因此并没有重大的实际意义。 因此，中央政府对和平法官职权的地产特征的认可在十八世纪中期终止了。实际上，越来越多的被任命为和平法官的人，尽管确实是绅士，但实际上并不属于贵族。 随着“仅仅是绅士”被任命为和平法官，这一旧制度典型的统治机构发生了性质的变化。从一个标志着升入低级贵族阶层的职位，它演变为一个促进地产社会解体的机构。这种变化对新任和平法官来说几乎不明显，他们仍然可以将自己的任命视为进入统治阶层的准入。实际上，现在涉及的是形成一个扩展了地方统治的集体地产占有，包括在地产方面没有特权的统治阶级的代表成员的统治阶层。这一过程的前提条件是将和平法官职位从特定家族的政治垄断中解放出来。在这个意义上，可以说是一种去个人化的趋势。 这可以从新的行为规则中看出。1753年，县级法庭成员之间的等级秩序被废除。从此，成员不再按照他们的地产等级列出，而是按简单的字母顺序排列。与此同时，变得惯常的是，只要对他们的实践没有投诉，和平法官的任期结束后重新任命他们。 形成一个超越地产限制且比较一体化的地方政府阶层，既是结果也是对行政和司法实践更强理性化的前提条件。“法治”的应用最初是社会选择性的。特别是，尽管所有影响税收的决定都要求至少两名和平法官的参与，而且通常实际上需要在一个或多个季度会议上集合的和平法官的批准，但一个和平法官的简要判断在相当长一段时间内对较贫困人口阶层仍然足够。在自己的家中，仅凭一个甚至可能是受薪雇员的单一见证人在场，一名和平法官可以判决一名“流浪者”鞭打或将偷猎者送入监狱，对周日运动或亵渎性诅咒处以罚款，或要求当地贫民在收获季节工作。例如，在1820年代，汉普郡的一位名叫Richer Delber的农民，基于他自己的家庭管理员提供的信息，以及另一位公爵雇员的证据，在公爵住所的接待室被白金汉公爵判刑。法官指出，被告应当谨防做出任何不当言论，否则在场的警察将直接将其送入监狱或置于领罚架上。 此类程序并不一定是典型的。但即使在十九世纪早期，它们仍然是可能的。 和平法官的行动空间使得他们的职务行为在地方和个人方面存在很大变化。然而，在十八世纪的过程中，出现了“法治”的地方通用化。这可以更准确地针对最初几乎没有形式化的两个行政实践领域进行说明。 十八世纪的公共秩序政策以狩猎法律为中心。这些法律有双重理由：捍卫地产狩猎特权的垄断，特别是对这些特权的前提条件：鹿园中的野生动物、鱼类和树木存量的特殊刑事制裁。 正如R.B. Munsche所示，十七世纪末和十八世纪初的狩猎法应该首先被解释为对实际或担忧的新社会力量崛起的地产防御措施。因为，尽管1671年的狩猎法几乎未经改变地接管了对皇家森林偷猎几个世纪以来存在的刑事制裁，而且随后几十年的司法实践仍未显示出与早期行为模式的主要断裂，但地产贵族利用新法将1660年暂时归还给王室的森林和狩猎权归为己有，从而授予地主聘请自己的管家的权限。1707年，地产贵族利用他们在议会中的多数优势，为自己授予了颁发狩猎许可证的权利。这意味着这样的许可证不再能简单地从皇室购买，而狩猎这一贵族消遣活动的获取现在取决于地产贵族的恩惠或购买适当的自有地产。这确认了地产财产相对于纯粹财富的社会再评价，并将富裕的城镇居民限定在地产贵族为其定义的次等位置。随着十八世纪鹿园数量的增加被围栏化，这一立法失去了部分意义，因为狩猎被转移到私人地产中，狩猎权被纳入对私有财产保护的一般决定矩阵中。但这丝毫未改变地产贵族的垄断，因为这一原因，对野味的需求——在这些条件下，其高雅的味道不仅仅是品味问题——意义更大。 由于在城镇中在特殊场合供应野味是惯例，以这种方式明显反驳地产贵族的社会排斥策略，因此在十八世纪下半叶——随着运输设施的改善——出现了大规模的野味黑市。这为贫困的乡村人民提供了不仅能满足自身需求，有时甚至能赚点钱的前景。 直到1817年，狩猎法不断加强，尤其是它们的实践应用，以应对往往由组织化团体进行的偷猎活动的增加。这一时期，农村贫困也在稳步增长。许多未领到薪水的退役士兵和水手也表现出比定居人口更少的顺从。然而，最重要的是，偷猎符合普通百姓对其权利的感觉，这些权利几个世纪以来一直与当权者的立法相抗衡。 在1820年代，偷猎者与狩猎权所有者之间的冲突发展成为一场常规战争。这最终导致地产贵族进行了双重投降：通过请求中央政府支持镇压偷猎，地方法官放弃了他们此前如此严格捍卫的地方公共秩序政策的自治权，并通过同意狩猎法的改革，他们放弃了地产特权的重要立法制裁。"},{"instruction":"请将“Because game was now defined as a commodity, it could be legally traded. The price of game consequently fell, and with it the incentive for its dangerous pursuit. The stabilisation of order in the countryside, however, was only possible by the surrender of a specific estate content of public-order policy. From now on, game and fish, as well as trees in the deer parks, were simply private property like any other. This development was provoked by the effec-tive demand for an 'aristocratic' dish - an effect of the economic rise of urban bourgeois strata - as well as by the social conflicts that developed in connection with the disappearance of traditional opportunities of provision. In these conflicts, the rural population expressed their own claim to the right to shoot a hare or fish a trout. But because they possessed no land, or had only a lease on their farm, this was not legally possible for the majority of them. Our second example is that of the depersonalisation of local repressive power. This expressed not just the results of social ascent, but also the dissolution of the social preconditions of traditional strategies of public order. Extra-legal participation in the process of political decision-making had always been treated as a criminal offence, but this was strengthened by the Riot Act of 1715 and the subsequent criminalisation of 'riotous assembly'. There were frequent provocations to such behaviour: high prices and low wages, forced recruitment into the military, high tolls for the use of roads (due to the turnpike system), and much else besides. In all of these cases, repressive measures were prescribed. In fact the Justices of the Peace very often used their power of office in the eighteenth century to apply the laws only with reference to particular individuals and their demands. In other words, they based their practice of office on a judgement of the parties involved and the criticism of them that was made. This traditional form of local public-order policy assumed that the Justices were personally acquainted with the conditions of life and ideas of the protestors, and indeed knew many of these individually, while conversely, an undertaking on the part of a Justice had to be believed because he possessed personal authority. Mutual acquaintance of this kind, however, could only maintain its policy-determining character so long as the practice of authority remained in close connection with personally determined relations of work and reproduction. As soon as these dissolved, the material basis of traditional public-order policy disappeared. This was however precisely the case in the course of the eighteenth century. Many peasant families lost the basis of their livelihood as a result of enclosures, while increased bread prices caused widespread hunger - particularly at the end of the century. Large farmers and landowners went over on an increasing scale to hiring servants of both sexes only for a year with board and lodging, and at times simply making use of casual workers. A considerable part of the English rural population were proletarianised, and in place of their work and life having a hierarchical connection with the lords, relations were increasingly simply those of objective exploitation. This meant that from now on authority was more external to the conditions of work and reproduction, and could not be relied upon to the same extent for preserving peace and order. At the same time, estate rule was also objectified by the changed relationship of its upholding groups to market conditions. Market relations had certainly determined the material conditions of reproduction for centuries. But the end of the eighteenth century saw an increasing tendency to exploit the possibilities of profit without regard to traditional practices for stabilising local rule. In an essay that has rightly become classic on the values expressed in the forms of protest of the rural lower strata, E.P. Thompson has shown how magistrates were often guided by norms of this kind in relation to the bread riots of the eighteenth century, and yet the immense profits made from the corn trade in the war years at the end of the century soon made ideas of a ‘just price' and of the lords' obligation to provide at least a basic minimum ‘outmoded'.25 This meant that the local magistrates' power depended more than before on the back-up of naked repression. Police forces, however, were too few in number, especially in the countryside. Occasionally, therefore, gentlemen in the service of the local squire had to undertake this task. A few towns, for example Nottingham, already sought to establish a regular paid police.26 In the countryside, too, constables made a more regular appearance when it was necessary to prevent protest movements. As a general rule, however, they were not prepared to act against their neighbours, and they sometimes even found reason to put themselves at the head of local protests.27 There thus remained armed force. This meant on the one hand the 'yeomanry', a volunteer formation formed from farmers and peasants and commanded by landed nobles. The Justices sought to avoid its deployment, as the yeomen had a claim to compensation. They could not however completely do without this, as the regular army regiments were generally not immediately available in cases of disturbance. There were two reasons why recourse to the standing army was rather rare in the eighteenth century. First of all, any request for military support amounted to a confession that the Justices were unable to govern without the help of Westminster. Local government autonomy, however, was a value that the Justices were always reluctant to renounce. The fact that following the Wilkes disturbances of the 1760s, and especially at the end of the century, so many Justices requested the Home Office for advice and asked the army leadership to dispatch regiments, speaks more clearly than anything written in letters or diaries as to the extent of insecurity and fear of possible revolution that was widespread at this time among the ruling estates.28 The second reason for the reluctance to demand military support lay in distrust of the army in time of peace. For many, such distrust was the most important foundation of the constitution. Since the time of Charles I and the Commonwealth, a peacetime army smelt to some of absolutism and to others of dictatorship. This made the brute blatancy with which, for example, sections of the French army and even regiments composed chiefly of foreign merce-naries were deployed against a rebellious population, something impossible in English conditions. In many cases in the eighteenth century, magistrates were even taken to court for deploying the military. They were generally acquitted, but their legal power to call in the standing army had scarcely any anchorage in the self-conception of the ruling estates. It was for precisely this reason that army officers were advised by their superiors to act in such a way that responsibility for intervention remained with the civil authorities. Even before the formalising of conditions for the use of military force - after a first failed attempt at legal regulation in the Riot Act of 1715,29 this was only seriously tackled in the reign of Victoria - the self-conception of the ruling estates set limits to the use of military force to maintain public order. This did not prevent dead and wounded, and the English ancien régime was by no means a system in which material and political demands could be raised without having to fear for life and limb. After riots, and even demonstrations that were regarded as riots by the authorities, people were condemned to death, deportation, military service or prison, often on summary procedures. And yet the widespread public mistrust of the army, and the reluctance of officers and soldiers to undertake the ‘riot duty' imposed on them, restricted personal possession of the means of force in local government practice. When Parliament decreed in 1782 that the central military authorities could be held to account for the behaviour of the army when this was deployed domestically, the power of decision over the use of military force was in part withdrawn from the locally ruling estates and there was the beginning of its ‘nationalisation'. Causes adduced for the depersonalisation of local power of office have often included the rise of numerous ‘gentlemen' into the ranks of the possessing hierarchy which were formerly monopolised by the nobles, as well as the dissolution of traditional forms of personal dependence in the countryside. In the second half of the eighteenth century new causes were added to these: the demands made on (local) taxation and military administration in the event of foreign war, as well as the need to deal with political radicalism - especially in the emerging towns. At this point, we shall simply indicate the results of this: the formation of a leading stratum that represented no longer just the ruling interests of the landed nobility, but far more clearly than before those of the propertied as a whole, along with a certain - if still limited - de-individualis- ing of the practice of office and consequently also of the official authority of the Justices of the Peace. This authority had previously been tied to specific persons, but it was now far more surely based on the office itself. Even while the institution of Justices of the Peace still sufficed to deal with the material rise of new forces without endangering the political hegemony of the upper ranks of the nobility, there developed within the forms of personal rule the practice of a nationalised power of office.”翻译为中文","output":"因为野味现在被定义为一种商品，它可以合法交易。野味的价格因此下降，与之一同下降的还有其危险追求的动力。然而，乡村秩序的稳定仅通过放弃公共秩序政策的特定地产内容才成为可能。从现在开始，鹿园中的野生动植物和鱼类仅仅像其他任何私有财产一样。这一发展是由对“贵族”菜肴的有效需求激发的——这是城市资产阶层经济崛起的一个效应——以及与传统生计机会消失相关的社会冲突的发展。在这些冲突中，乡村人口表达了他们自己对射杀一只野兔或钓一条鳟鱼的权利的主张。但因为他们没有土地，或只拥有对农场的租赁权，对他们大多数人来说，这在法律上是不可能的。 我们的第二个例子是地方镇压力量的去人格化。这不仅表达了社会上升的结果，还表达了传统公共秩序策略的社会前提条件的解体。非法参与政治决策过程一直被视为犯罪，但这一点通过1715年的暴动法和随后对“暴动性集会”的刑事化得到了加强。引发此类行为的挑衅频繁发生：物价高涨和工资低下、强制征兵、使用道路的高通行费（由于收费公路制度）等等。在所有这些情况下，都规定了镇压措施。实际上，十八世纪的和平法官经常利用他们的职权，仅针对特定个人及其要求施用法律。换句话说，他们的职务实践基于对涉及各方的判断及对其提出的批评。这种传统形式的地方公共秩序政策假设法官个人熟悉抗议者的生活条件和想法，实际上也确实个人了解其中许多人，反过来，法官的承诺必须被信任，因为他拥有个人权威。然而，这种相互了解只有在权威实践与个人确定的劳动和生产关系保持紧密联系时才能保持其政策决定性特征。一旦这些解体，传统公共秩序政策的物质基础就消失了。然而，这正是十八世纪发生的情况。许多农民家庭由于圈地运动失去了他们的生计基础，而面包价格的上涨导致了普遍的饥饿 - 特别是在世纪末。大农场主和地主越来越多地转向仅以食宿聘请男女仆人一年一度，有时简单地使用临时工。英国大部分乡村人口被无产阶级化，他们的工作和生活与领主的等级联系被客观剥削关系所取代。这意味着从此以后，权威在工作和生产条件上更为外在，不能在同样程度上依赖于维持和平与秩序。 同时，由于其维护群体与市场条件的关系改变，地产统治也被客观化了。市场关系确实几个世纪以来决定了生产的物质条件。但十八世纪末，越来越倾向于不顾传统的地方统治稳定实践来利用盈利的可能性。在一篇关于乡村下层阶级抗议形式所表达的价值观的经典论文中，E.P. 汤普森展示了十八世纪面包暴动期间法官们如何经常受到此类规范的指导，然而世纪末年战争贸易中获得的巨额利润很快使“公正价格”的观念和领主至少提供基本最低生活的义务显得“过时”。这意味着地方法官的权力比以前更多地依赖于赤裸裸的镇压的支持。然而，特别是在乡村，警察力量人数太少。因此，有时地方乡绅不得不代表地方地主执行这一任务。例如，诺丁汉等一些城市已经寻求建立一支正规的有薪警察。在乡村，当需要阻止抗议运动时，警察也更定期出现。但通常，他们不准备反对他们的邻居，有时甚至找到理由站在当地抗议的前列。因此，剩下的就是武装力量。这意味着一方面是“民兵”，一支由农民和农夫组成的志愿部队，由地主贵族指挥。法官试图避免部署它，因为民兵有权要求赔偿。然而，他们无法完全不依赖于此，因为常规军队通常不会立即在骚乱案件中可用。 十八世纪逃避常备军支援的原因之一是相对罕见的。首先，任何请求军事支援的行为等于承认法官无法在没有西敏寺的帮助下治理。然而，地方政府自主权是法官一直不愿放弃的价值。1760年代威尔克斯骚乱之后，特别是在世纪末，如此多的法官向内政部求助并请求军队领导派遣团队，比书信或日记中的任何内容更清楚地说明了当时在统治阶层中普遍存在的不安全感和对可能革命的恐惧。第二个对要求军事支援感到不情愿的原因在于和平时期对军队的不信任。对许多人来说，这种不信任是宪法最重要的基础。从查理一世和英联邦时期开始，和平时期的军队对一些人而言意味着绝对主义，对另一些人而言意味着独裁。这使得例如法国军队的某些部分甚至主要由外国雇佣军组成的团队对抗叛乱人口的粗暴公然使用，在英国条件下成为不可能。在十八世纪的许多情况下，法官因部署军队甚至被起诉。他们通常被宣判无罪，但他们调用常备军的法律权力几乎没有在统治阶层的自我观念中找到依据。正是出于这个原因，军官们的上级建议他们以这样一种方式行动，即责任在于民事当局。甚至在对使用军事力量的条件进行正式化之前——在1715年暴动法的首次失败尝试后，这一问题直到维多利亚时代才被认真处理——统治阶层的自我观念对维护公共秩序使用军事力量设定了限制。 这并未阻止人们死伤，英国旧制度绝非一个在其中提出物质和政治要求而不必担心生命和肢体安全的系统。在骚乱之后，甚至被当局视为骚乱的示威，人们经常因简易程序而被判处死刑、流放、兵役或监禁。然而，对军队的广泛公众不信任，以及军官和士兵对所赋予的“暴乱任务”的不情愿，限制了地方政府实践中对武力手段的个人拥有。 当议会在1782年规定，中央军事当局对国内部署军队的行为负有责任时，决定使用军事力量的权力在某种程度上从地方统治阶层中撤回，并开始了其“国家化”。 常常认为导致地方职权去人格化的原因包括众多“绅士”进入以前由贵族垄断的占有等级体系，以及乡村中传统个人依赖形式的解体。到了十八世纪下半叶，出现了新的原因：外国战争时对（地方）税收和军事管理的要求，以及处理政治激进主义的需求——特别是在新兴城镇。在此，我们仅指出这一点的结果：形成了一个领导阶层，不再仅代表地产贵族的统治利益，而是比以前更清楚地代表了整个有产者的利益，以及职务实践的某种程度上的去个人化——因此也包括和平法官的官方权威的去个人化。这种权威以前与特定人物挂钩，但现在更确实地基于职位本身。即使和平法官机构仍然足以处理新兴力量的物质上升，而不危及贵族上层的政治霸权，个人统治形式中也出现了国家化职权的实践。"},{"instruction":"请将“c. The ‘Establishment’: transformation of church rule The rule of the church was restored in 1660 along with the monarchy - and, indeed, without those concessions that the Presbyterians had hoped to derive from their support for the exiled son of the beheaded king. The Church of England remained episcopalian, the bishops were once more by virtue of their office members of the House of Lords, and church courts were restored (though not with all their previous powers). The English bishops also accepted without resistance the loss of their right to raise a special tax on their congregations - and thus a financially based negotiating position in church affairs. One result of this last decision was the end of the church 'Convocations' that had been previously summoned by the crown. After the lower clergy demanded greater autonomy for the church in 1717, and opposed a decree to dissolve the Convocation, the crown ceased calling further assemblies of this kind.30 The Church of England was now governed by decisions of Parliament, to which the clergy did not belong - apart from the bishops in the upper house. Only in 1852, when the Church of England once more surrendered a considerable part of its legally guaranteed privileges, was a church assembly again summoned. The interest in reform of the church made the beginnings of a centralised structure for church opinion seem once more politically useful. In the late seventeenth century, the restoration of a state church was contested. Opposition to this measure was expressed in the rise of the free churches. In this early Nonconformism, religious and constitutional views converged into a unity, but once the new dynasty and its political relations stabilised, Nonconformism of this kind lost its attraction for the nobility. When the families of the upper nobility and the higher gentry prepared to return to the state church, this robbed the Nonconformist religious movements of both their more influential representatives and their former social-religious dyna-mism. They lost both supporters and influence.31 With the change of dynasty in 1688-9, the constitution of the state church experienced an internal shock. The so-called 'non-jurors', Anglican clerics who refused to swear to the Act of 1701 establishing the Protestant succession, saw the Church of England as bound up with the Stuart dynasty. Only the final military defeat of the Jacobites in the mid-eighteenth century put an end to this striving for independence within the established church. The political stabilisation of the state church in England was above all the result of a stabilisation of monarchy and dynasty. But, if the Church of Eng-land became a component of the ruling structures of the ancien régime, this was due first and foremost to the estate character of the clerical office, combined with the increasing social and cultural integration of the clergy into the ruling estates. Like other office-holders under the ancien régime, the majority of the clergy viewed their position as a possession entitling them to appropriate a rental income. The duties of office were often interpreted very generously, and their exercise was seldom checked. The degree of pluralism, i.e. a single priest's possession of several ‘livings', made the priestly function in many cases quite impossible, while in other cases this was undertaken by poorly paid curates with scarcely any theological training. These realities in the practice of clerical office reduced the possibility of securing political stability by the enforcement of religious unity and confor-mity to ecclesiastically defined moral norms. The difficulties that confronted the realisation of the claim to uniformity of belief and behaviour, however, did not abolish the political sanctioning of this claim. If Nonconformism, Catholicism and occasionally even scepticism enjoyed a good deal of de facto tolerance in the eighteenth century, this situation remained hedged with res-ervations - apart from the particular privileges granted by legislation to certain of the free churches. The exercise of rule of the Anglican clergy was not confined to the state- sanctioned disciplinary measures of the church. In the House of Lords, bish-ops shared in the drafting of draconian penal legislation, and in the counties there were a considerable number of clerical Justices of the Peace. They took part in the suppression of disturbances, the condemnation of church members and later the supervision of the Poor Law. This shared exercise of rule was the basis of the characteristic eighteenth-century alliance of squire and parson, along with their converging interest in measures to increase the profitability of agricultural production. In 1817, the profit orientation of agricultural pro-duction long practised by the Anglican clergy was officially legalised.32 But the alliance between religious and secular landed proprietors was made real above all by the material and at the same time social rise of the lower clergy. Just like the bishops' incomes, those of the local clergy also showed an immense variation. Many of them were driven by material conditions to pluralism, conflict with farmers over leases or the failure to hand over tithes. Many in the eighteenth century, however, managed through such practices to reach a level of well-being that not only made them acceptable as Justices of the Peace, but also as dining companions and sons-in-law of the gentry. In the next generation, such established social and kinship connections facilitated their rise and their continuation in office. During the course of the eighteenth century, the proportion of clergy whose fathers had already belonged to this estate grew significantly. The unity of squire and parson was reinforced by the far-reaching seculari-sation of patronage rights. In the Reformation, the crown had appropriated the greater part of such rights along with church lands, while retaining patronage over bishops. But, by sale and other disposal of church lands, a large part of the remaining patronage rights fell into the private possession of the landed nobility, who used these rights as a commodity for sale, or else to provide a living for their relatives or those of other noble families to whom they felt indebted. In some cases, the patrons dictated to the local clergy the required forms of worship, but more usually these were a secondary concern. By and large, however, the secularisation of patronage rights meant the reinforcement of an orientation of the entire Anglican clergy towards the nobility that already existed. This did not make all local clergy into those hunting, drinking and theologically unschooled exemplars that are so notorious in English fiction. But it did remove the Church of England socially and politically that much further from the majority of its nominal members, all the more so as the living conditions of a large section of the rural population deteriorated. The Church of England had certainly never been a church of the 'people', and the enforcement of Sunday attendance did not mean that the poorer rural popula-tion all listened regularly to the word of God as proclaimed by the vicar. (In many outlying places, travelling Methodist preachers seem to have carried out systematic Christian missionary work among English men and women who had supposedly belonged to the Church of England for generations.) What changed in the course of the eighteenth century was thus neither the fundamental character of the Church of England's rule, nor that of the groups that were the bearers of this, and yet social developments at the end of this century and the beginning of the next displayed its partisan character with particular clarity. This was shown among other things by the way that an expansion of religious provision for the urban manufacturing population was scarcely discussed at all during the eighteenth century, and certainly no attempt was made to deal with it. This would have required a subdivision of existing urban congregations, and thus ran counter to the possession rights of existing incumbents. Curtailing these would have required an act of Parlia-ment. Only the great shock of the French Revolution made the fact that the poorer classes in England were scarcely in a position to attend church even if they wanted to do so, into an object of political debate and action. Regulations designed to facilitate the establishment of new urban congregations, however, were not undertaken until a good half-century later. The question of seating in church was one of the most visible problems of the English national church. It was taken for granted that leading families sat at the front. But the rental of almost all seats in church led to a situation in which poorer church attenders could only find room at the back or sides, if at all, and in many cases could neither see or hear the vicar. The situation in the rapidly growing towns was especially serious. The number of seats in church here had not the least relationship to the obligation of Sunday attendance that was still in force. In 1818, the government set in motion an immense programme of church building, and when the reformed Parliament after 1832 was no longer willing to spend such high sums, the programme was continued until 1853 on the basis of private donations. Only when the number of seats in church rose did it become evident that the ‘Church of England' no longer had need of them.33 A key reason for the historical dissolution of state-church structures lay in the de-culturalisation processes that went together with industrialisation. For most of the working class, their often limited participation in the forms of Anglican practice ended with their migration from village to town. The ‘established' church did little to prevent this disappearance. By the early nine-teenth century, not only was it very far from organising the religious practice of the entire population, but only a minority of those who saw themselves as Christians still belonged to the Anglican church. Convinced Protestants now adhered increasingly to the Methodists who had been excluded from the Church of England, or to one of the more recently established free churches. This de facto dissolution of the monopoly position of the 'establishment' did not however lead to a legal dissolution. Since the Church of England and its personnel were integrated into the practice of estate rule, any attack on the constitution of the state church amounted to an attack on the ancien régime.”翻译为中文","output":"c. 教会统治的转变 教会的统治在1660年随着君主制一同恢复——实际上，没有因为长老会支持流亡的被处决国王之子而期望获得的那些让步。英格兰教会仍然保持着主教制度，主教们再次凭借他们的职位成为上议院的成员，教会法庭也得到了恢复（尽管并非恢复了它们之前的所有权力）。英格兰主教们也毫无抵抗地接受了失去对教众征收特殊税收的权利——从而失去了在教会事务中基于财政的谈判地位。 这最后一个决定的结果之一是结束了之前由皇冠召集的教会“会议”。在1717年下层神职人员要求教会获得更大自治权，并反对解散会议的法令后，皇冠停止了召集此类进一步集会的行为。从此，英格兰教会由议会的决定所治理，而神职人员并不属于议会——除了上议院的主教们。直到1852年，当英格兰教会再次放弃了它的相当一部分法律保障的特权时，才再次召集了教会大会。教会改革的兴趣使得教会意见的中央集权结构再次看起来在政治上有用。 在十七世纪晚期，恢复国教的做法受到了争议。对此措施的反对体现在自由教会的崛起上。在这种早期的非国教徒中，宗教观点和宪法观点融合为一体，但一旦新王朝及其政治关系稳定，这种非国教徒就失去了对贵族的吸引力。当上层贵族和高级绅士家族准备返回国教时，这剥夺了非国教徒宗教运动的更有影响力的代表和它们之前的社会宗教活力。他们失去了支持者和影响力。 随着1688-9年王朝更替，国教的宪制遭受了内部冲击。所谓的“不效忠者”，即拒绝对1701年建立新教继承法案宣誓的圣公会神职人员，视英格兰教会与斯图亚特王朝紧密相连。只有在十八世纪中叶雅各宾党人的最终军事失败后，这种在建立的教会内寻求独立的努力才告终止。 英格兰国教的政治稳定首先是君主制和王朝稳定的结果。但是，如果英格兰教会成为旧制度统治结构的一部分，首先是因为神职办公室的地产特征，加上神职人员在社会和文化上越来越多地融入统治阶层。 像旧制度下的其他官员一样，大多数神职人员将他们的职位视为赋予他们征收租金收入权利的财产。办公室的职责往往被非常宽泛地解释，其执行很少受到检查。职职合一，即一位牧师拥有多个“圣职”，在许多情况下使得牧师的职能完全不可能执行，而在其他情况下，这些职能由没有多少神学训练且报酬很低的助理牧师来承担。 神职办公室实践中的这些现实降低了通过执行宗教统一和遵守教会定义的道德规范来确保政治稳定的可能性。然而，实现信仰和行为统一性要求所面临的困难，并没有废除这一要求的政治制裁。如果说在十八世纪，非国教徒、天主教徒，甚至偶尔的怀疑论者在事实上享有了相当大的宽容，这一状况仍然受到保留——除了立法赋予某些自由教会的特定特权之外。 圣公会神职人员行使统治权不仅限于国家批准的教会纪律措施。在上议院，主教们参与起草严厉的刑事立法，在各县有相当数量的神职地方法官。他们参与镇压骚乱、谴责教会成员，后来还监督穷人法。这种共同行使统治权是十八世纪特有的地主和牧师联盟的基础，以及他们在增加农业生产盈利性措施上的共同利益。在1817年，长期以来由圣公会神职人员实践的农业生产盈利导向被正式合法化。但宗教和世俗地主之间的联盟主要是通过下层神职人员的物质和同时的社会上升得以实现。 就像主教的收入一样，地方神职人员的收入也显示出巨大的差异。许多人由于物质条件被迫走向兼职，与农民就租约发生冲突或未能交付什一税。然而，十八世纪许多人通过这种做法设法达到了一种福利水平，不仅使他们能够作为地方法官接受，而且作为绅士的餐桌伙伴和女婿。在下一代，这种确立的社会和亲属联系促进了他们的上升和继续任职。在十八世纪的过程中，父辈已经属于这一阶层的神职人员比例显著增长。 地主和牧师的统一通过广泛的世俗化赞助权进一步加强。在宗教改革期间，王室没收了大部分此类权利及教会土地，同时保留了对主教的赞助权。但通过出售和其他处置教会土地，剩余的大部分赞助权落入了地产贵族的私人拥有，他们将这些权利作为商品出售，或者用来为他们的亲戚或他们感恩负债的其他贵族家族的成员提供生计。在某些情况下，赞助人向当地神职人员指定了所需的礼拜形式，但通常这些是次要关注的。总的来说，赞助权的世俗化意味着对贵族的整个圣公会神职人员已经存在的取向的加强。这并没有使所有地方神职人员都成为英国小说中臭名昭著的那些打猎、饮酒、缺乏神学教育的典型，但它确实使英格兰教会在社会和政治上从其名义成员的大多数中进一步疏远，尤其是随着大部分乡村人口生活条件的恶化。英格兰教会当然从未是一个“人民”的教会，强制周日出席并不意味着较贫困的乡村人口都定期聆听牧师宣讲的上帝之言。（在许多偏远地区，旅行的卫理公会传教士似乎对那些据说已经属于英格兰教会几代人的英国男女进行了系统的基督教传教工作。） 因此，十八世纪的变化既不是英格兰教会统治的基本性质，也不是承担这一统治的群体，然而在本世纪末和下个世纪之初的社会发展特别清晰地展示了它的党派特点。这其中的一个体现是，十八世纪几乎根本没有讨论过为城市制造业人口扩大宗教服务的问题，当然也没有尝试解决它。这将需要对现有城市教会进行划分，从而与现有牧师的占有权相违背。削减这些将需要议会的一项法案。只有法国大革命的巨大冲击才使得英格兰较贫困阶层即使想去教堂也几乎无法做到的事实成为政治辩论和行动的对象。然而，旨在促进建立新城市教会的规定直到半个世纪后才得以采取。 教堂座位问题是英格兰国教最显眼的问题之一。人们认为领先的家庭应该坐在前面是理所当然的。但几乎所有教堂座位的出租导致了较贫困的教会参与者只能在后面或侧面找到位置（如果有的话），在许多情况下他们既看不见也听不到牧师。在迅速增长的城镇中，情况尤为严重。教堂座位数量与仍然有效的周日出席义务之间没有最小的关联。 1818年，政府启动了一个巨大的教堂建设计划，当1832年后改革后的议会不再愿意花费如此高的金额时，该计划一直持续到1853年，基于私人捐赠。只有当教堂座位数量增加时，才变得明显“英格兰教会”不再需要它们。 国教结构历史性解体的一个关键原因在于工业化过程中伴随的去文化化。对于大多数工人阶级来说，他们通常有限的参与圣公会实践随着他们从村庄迁移到城镇而结束。“既定”的教会几乎没有采取措施防止这种消失。到了十九世纪早期，它不仅远远没有组织整个人口的宗教实践，而且只有少数自认为是基督徒的人仍然属于圣公会。坚定的新教徒现在越来越多地归属于被排除在英格兰教会之外的卫理公会，或者是其中一个较新成立的自由教会。 “既定”的垄断地位的事实上的解体并未导致法律上的解体。由于英格兰教会及其人员被整合到地产统治实践中，任何对国教宪制的攻击都等同于对旧制度的攻击。"},{"instruction":"intervals = [1,2,3,5] look_back = 60 optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0003,clipvalue=0.5) for csv_file in csv_files: file_path = os.path.join(csv_directory, csv_file) unique_part = file_path.split('_')[-2] df = pd.read_csv(r'C:UsersarisaDesktopdddBinance_1INCHBUSD_d.csv') include_substrings = [\\"y_\\"] exact_columns_to_keep = [\\"Open\\", \\"High\\", \\"Low\\", \\"Close\\",\\"volume_base\\", \\"volume_crypto\\", \\"tradecount\\",] filtered_columns = [col for col in df.columns if any(col.startswith(s) for s in include_substrings)] columns_to_keep = list(set(exact_columns_to_keep + filtered_columns)) df = df[columns_to_keep] df.head() features = df.drop([ 'y_High_1d', 'y_Low_1d', 'y_Priority_1d', 'y_High_2d', 'y_Low_2d', 'y_Priority_2d', 'y_High_3d', 'y_Low_3d', 'y_Priority_3d', 'y_High_5d', 'y_Low_5d', 'y_Priority_5d'], axis=1) #

Unfortunately, your original message does not include the Docker Compose file you mentioned. However, I can guide you through the process of using Podman with a Docker Compose file assuming generic circumstances. # Background Podman is often touted as a drop-in replacement for Docker, offering a daemonless container engine that aims to directly execute containers under your user ID, thereby enhancing security. One of Podman’s features is its ability to emulate the Docker CLI, making it possible to use Docker Compose files with minimal changes. As of my last update, you might need to use \`podman-compose\` or leverage compatibility features of \`Podman\` directly since \`Podman v3.x\` started to support \`docker-compose\` natively although with some limitations. # Using Podman with Docker Compose File 1. **Install Podman-Compose (if needed):** If your version of Podman doesn't natively support Docker Compose, you might need to install \`podman-compose\`, a script to help Podman work with Docker Compose files. You can usually install it using your distribution’s package manager or pip. \`\`\`bash pip install podman-compose \`\`\` 2. **Check Docker Compose File:** Make sure your Docker Compose file (\`docker-compose.yml\`) is valid and formatted properly according to the version specified in the file. Podman should be compatible with most services defined in version 3 of the Docker Compose file syntax. 3. **Using Podman-Compose:** Navigate to the directory containing your \`docker-compose.yml\` file and substitute \`docker-compose\` commands with \`podman-compose\`. For example: \`\`\`bash cd /path/to/your/compose-file podman-compose up \`\`\` This command will start the services defined in your Docker Compose file similarly to how \`docker-compose up\` would. 4. **Using Podman Directly (for newer versions):** If you're using a recent enough version of Podman that supports Docker Compose files natively, you might be able to directly use Podman commands as you would with Docker, thanks to Podman’s Docker CLI compatibility. Ensure you have the latest version of Podman installed, and simply use: \`\`\`bash podman compose up \`\`\` # Tips and Considerations - **Compatibility:** Some Docker-specific flags or settings might not have direct equivalents in Podman, especially regarding networking and volumes. You might need to adjust your Compose file or environment accordingly. - **Root vs Rootless:** Podman is designed to run containers both as the root and in a rootless mode. Running it rootless (the default) enhances security but might introduce limitations regarding networking and the ability to bind to certain ports. - **Volume and Network Names:** Podman-compose and Podman might handle names differently than Docker. For example, volumes and networks might get prefixed with the project name. - **Environment Variables:** Since \`podman-compose\` is essentially a wrapper, make sure your environment is properly configured for Podman, especially if you're working in a mixed environment or scripts where Docker might also be called. - **Check Podman Documentation:** Since Podman is under active development, newer versions might introduce changes to how Docker Compose files are handled. Always check the official Podman documentation for the most current practices and compatibility notes. Without seeing the specific contents of your Docker Compose file, this general guide should give you a starting point to work with Podman. If you have specific questions or run into issues related to your Docker Compose file's contents, feel free to ask with more details!"},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по алгебре 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\".ASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по алгебре в 8 классе на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения”<br/><br/>Дата проведения урока: [указать дату]<br/><br/>Цели урока:<br/>1.

Самоанализ напиши в произвольном видеASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по алгебре в 8 классе на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения”<br/><br/>Проведение урока по данной теме явилось для меня не только возможностью попрактиковаться в роли учителя, но и проверить насколько успешно я могу передать учащимся знания по интересующей их теме. Урок был спланирован с учетом возрастных особенностей восьмиклассников, их интересов и предпочтений в методах обучения.<br/><br/>В начале урока мной были заложены цели не только усвоения конкретных знаний о неполных квадратных уравнениях, но и развития логического мышления, а также умения анализировать и строить выводы. Я стремился создать дружелюбную атмосферу, чтобы учащиеся не боялись высказываться и демонстрировать свои знания и сомнения.<br/><br/>Методически урок был построен так, что начался с повторения уже известных фактов о квадратных уравнениях. Это позволило сгладить переход к новой теме. После чего был представлен и разобран новый материал, где я использовал презентацию с наглядными примерами неполных квадратных уравнений и методов их решения.<br/><br/>Большую часть урока я посвятил практике: решению задач вместе с классом и работе учеников в группах и индивидуально. Это позволило мне лучше понять уровень усвоения материала каждым учеником и вовремя предоставить обратную связь или дополнительную помощь тем, кто испытывал трудности.<br/><br/>Однако, в ходе урока я заметил, что некоторым учащимся было сложно сосредоточиться, что, возможно, было вызвано монотонностью моих объяснений. В будущем мне стоит внедрить больше интерактивных и игровых форм работы, чтобы повысить вовлеченность и активность всех учеников.<br/><br/>Также я почувствовал необходимость разнообразить дидактические материалы и задания, делая их более доступными и интересными для разных категорий учеников. Важным аспектом, который я извлек из этого опыта, является понимание того, что поддержка и поощрение со стороны учителя играют большую роль в мотивации учеников.<br/><br/>В конце урока я провел рефлексию, позволив учащимся выразить свое мнение о полученных знаниях и процессе обучения, что дало мне дополнительную обратную связь и понимание того, какие аспекты моего преподавания мне следует улучшить в будущем.<br/><br/>В заключение, хотя урок и был не лишен недостатков, я считаю его ценным опытом, который показал мне направления для дальнейшего профессионального и личностного роста как педагога.USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по алгебре 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\". Самоанализ напиши в произвольной формеASSISTANT: Самоанализ моего урока по алгебре на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения” для 8 класса стал значимым этапом в практике преподавания. Этот опыт позволил мне не только применить теоретические знания, полученные в университете, но и понять глубину своей ответственности как учителя за образовательный процесс.<br/><br/>Основная цель урока – ознакомить учащихся с неполными квадратными уравнениями и научить их успешно решать такие уравнения. Я постарался сделать урок максимально интерактивным и насыщенным, используя презентацию с визуальными примерами и групповую работу, чтобы способствовать лучшему восприятию и усвоению информации учащимися.<br/><br/>В качестве одной из ключевых методик обучения я включил решение задач на доске и работу в парах, что, как мне казалось, должно было способствовать лучшему усвоению материала. Мне удалось охватить различные виды неполных квадратных уравнений, постаравшись обеспечить наиболее ясное понимание методов их решения.<br/><br/>Однако, несмотря на мои усилия, во время урока я столкнулся с рядом сложностей. Некоторые ученики испытывали проблемы с концентрацией внимания и не могли полностью сосредоточиться на изложенном материале. Возможно, это было связано с недостаточным использованием игровых элементов и недостаточно четкой структурированностью урока для удержания внимания учащихся.<br/><br/>Также я заметил, что наличие однотипных заданий вызвало у некоторых учеников скуку, что показывает мне необходимость более тщательного подбора и дифференциации заданий в зависимости от интересов и уровня подготовки каждого ученика.<br/><br/>В заключение, этот опыт учебного урока показал мне важность гибкости и адаптивности в подходах к преподаванию. В дальнейшем я планирую использовать разнообразные методы обучения и контроля, более активно вовлекать учащихся в учебный процесс и уделять больше внимания индивидуальным особенностям и потребностям студентов. Этот урок стал важным уроком и для меня лично, подчеркнув необходимость постоянного самосовершенствования в роли учителя.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по физике 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Зависимость силы тока от сопротивления. Электрическое сопротивление проводника\\". Самоанализ напиши в произвольной формеASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по физике в 8 классе на тему “Зависимость силы тока от сопротивления. Электрическое сопротивление проводника”<br/><br/><br/>Подготовка и проведение урока по этой теме стали для меня важным испытанием моих педагогических и профессиональных навыков. Задача состояла не просто в изложении теоретического материала, но и в том, чтобы сделать урок понятным и интересным для восьмиклассников, с учетом их возрастных особенностей и предварительных знаний.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Урок начался с краткого повторения предыдущих тем по электричеству, чтобы обеспечить плавный переход к новому материалу. Введение в тему “Электрическое сопротивление проводника” было оформлено в форме презентации с визуальными иллюстрациями, которые помогли проиллюстрировать ключевые понятия.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Особое внимание я уделила практическим заданиям и экспериментам, которые позволили учащимся самостоятельно наблюдать зависимость силы тока от сопротивления в цепи. Это придало уроку интерактивность и способствовало лучшему усвоению материала. При реализации этой части урока я столкнулась с тем, что не все ученики могли активно участвовать в эксперименте одновременно, что показало мне значимость более тщательного планирования групповых и индивидуальных заданий.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>В ходе урока я также обнаружила, что понятие “сопротивление” оказалось сложным для понимания некоторыми учениками. Чтобы адресовать этот вопрос, я организовала дополнительное объяснение с использованием аналогий и еще несколько примеров из жизни, что, на мой взгляд, помогло учащимся лучше охватить тему.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Осознавая важность мотивации учащихся, я старалась поощрять активное участие и положительно реагировала на любые попытки ответов или вопросы. Это помогло создать поддерживающую атмосферу, в которой ученики не боялись проявить инициативу.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>В заключение, анализируя урок, я осознаю, что могла бы использовать разнообразие методов обучения еще шире, включая игры и кроссворды для закрепления теоретических понятий. Также мне стоит больше внимания уделить организации практической работы таким образом, чтобы каждый ученик получил возможность активно участвовать в эксперименте.<br/>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Этот опыт показал мне, что даже хорошо спланированный урок может столкнуться с непредвиденными сложностями и что важно быть готовым ко всему и уметь гибко адаптироваться к обстоятельствам, сохраняя при этом внимание и интерес учеников.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, проводишь классный час для 8 класса по теме: \\"День памяти воинов-интернационалистов\\", напиши планируемые результаты проведения этого классного часаASSISTANT:","output":"Планируемые результаты проведения классного часа для 8 класса по теме \\"День памяти воинов-интернационалистов\\": 1. **Формирование уважительного отношения к истории своей страны:** Учащиеся смогут глубже понять значение и трагизму конфликтов, в которых участвовали воины-интернационалисты, и их вклад в историю. 2. **Развитие навыков коллективной работы и взаимопомощи:** Планируется вовлечение учащихся в подготовку докладов, презентаций, и художественных номеров, что способствует укреплению духа товарищества и командной работы. 3. **Расширение кругозора:** Учащиеся получат знания о событиях, которые оказывали значительное влияние на мировую историю, а также о зоне конфликтов, их причинах и последствиях. 4. **Воспитание чувства патриотизма:** Обсуждение темы и участие в планировании мероприятий должны способствовать воспитанию гражданственности и патриотизма, осознанию значения героизма и самопожертвования в истории страны. 5. **Развитие эмоциональной восприимчивости:** Через чтение стихов, писем солдат, просмотр документальных отрывков планируется развитие способности сопереживать и выражать свои чувства и мысли по поводу услышанного и увиденного. 6. **Поддержка интереса к изучению истории:** Через участие в интерактивной части, обсуждения, задания на креативное мышление ученики могут обнаружить для себя новые интересные факты и аспекты, поддерживающие их интерес к предмету. 7. **Формирование критического мышления:** Анализ различных исторических источников, сопоставление фактов, обсуждение в классе помогут ученикам научиться критически осмысливать информацию, выделять главное и делать выводы. 8. **Развитие коммуникативных навыков:** Планируемые дискуссии, доклады, презентации позволят ученикам развить навыки публичного выступления, улучшить способности к аргументации своей точки зрения и вежливому общению.

The key here is utilizing Podman's auto-update feature, which can detect when an image used by a container has been updated in the registry and then automatically recreate the container with the new image. Note that your \`docker-compose.yml\` already includes an essential label for enabling auto-updates: \`io.containers.autoupdate: image\`. This is a good start. However, Podman's auto-update feature is based on systemd services to manage the lifecycle of containers and pods. Therefore, direct integration with \`podman-compose\` and the \`docker-compose.yml\` file might not be entirely straightforward because you'd typically need to create a systemd service for your container. Here's an outline of what you can do to set up auto-updates with Podman, leveraging systemd. # 1. Ensure Your Container Configuration Supports Auto-update Your \`docker-compose.yml\` includes the label \`io.containers.autoupdate: image\`, which is required for Podman's auto-update feature. This means your setup is ready in this aspect. # 2. Convert Your Compose File to systemd Services Since you're using \`podman-compose\`, you can generate systemd units from your \`docker-compose.yml\` file: \`\`\`bash podman-compose up -t systemd \`\`\` This command should generate \`.service\` files for your compose setup. You might need to adjust the generated services if you plan to ensure they fit your requirements, such as custom dependencies or start conditions. # 3. Enable the Services Once you have your systemd unit files, enable them to start at boot: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl enable <your-service-name>.service \`\`\` And start the service: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl start <your-service-name>.service \`\`\` # 4. Use Podman's Auto-update Mechanism Now that your container is managed by systemd, you can leverage Podman's auto-update feature. Check your current auto-update policy with: \`\`\`bash podman auto-update --dry-run \`\`\` And to actually run an auto-update: \`\`\`bash podman auto-update \`\`\` # 5. Automate the Auto-update Process To fully automate the process, you could set up a cron job or a systemd timer that periodically runs \`podman auto-update\`. For example, creating a systemd timer: 1. **Create a systemd service file (\`podman-auto-update.service\`):** \`\`\`ini [Unit] Description=Podman auto-update [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman auto-update \`\`\` 2. **Create a systemd timer file (\`podman-auto-update.timer\`):** \`\`\`ini [Unit] Description=Run Podman auto-update daily [Timer] OnCalendar=daily Persistent=true [Install] WantedBy=timers.target \`\`\` 3. **Enable and start the timer:** \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl enable --now podman-auto-update.timer \`\`\` This setup should ensure your containers are automatically updated when a new image version is available. Remember, the effectiveness of this setup depends on properly versioned images in the registry and might require some manual intervention for major updates or when migration steps are involved."},{"instruction":"unfortunately it doesn't work with the error below: Error: short name: auto updates require fully-qualified image reference: \\"nginx_nginx\\"","output":"The error message you're encountering indicates that Podman's auto-update feature requires a fully-qualified image reference in order to work. A fully-qualified image reference includes the full path to the image on a particular registry, not just the image name. For example, instead of just specifying \`nginx:latest\`, you would need to use \`docker.io/nginx:latest\` or another registry's full path to the image. From the information you've provided, it appears that you might be facing this issue due to how the image is referred to either in the Dockerfile or in the generated systemd service files after converting your \`docker-compose.yml\` with \`podman-compose\`. Here are steps to correct this and ensure your setup uses fully-qualified image references: # 1. Ensure Dockerfile Uses a Fully-Qualified Image Reference First, make sure your Dockerfile specifies the full image path. However, based on your provided Dockerfile, it seems you've already done this correctly with \`FROM docker.io/nginx:latest\`. # 2. Check and Edit the Generated Systemd Service File After generating the systemd service file with \`podman-compose\`, double-check the service file to ensure it contains the fully-qualified image reference. Here's how you can adjust the process: - Generate the systemd units from your \`docker-compose.yml\` file (as you likely already have): \`\`\`bash podman-compose up -t systemd \`\`\` - Locate and open the generated \`.service\` file related to the nginx container. This file will be located in a directory structure under \`/etc/systemd/system\` or outputted to your current directory, depending on how \`podman-compose\` was executed. - In the \`.service\` file, find the \`ExecStart\` line. This line contains the \`podman run\` command that \`podman-compose\` translated from your \`docker-compose.yml\`. Ensure the image name here is fully-qualified. For example, it should specify \`docker.io/nginx:latest\` instead of just \`nginx:latest\` or a partial name. # Example Adjustment: If the \`.service\` file contains something like: \`\`\`ini ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run --name nginx_nginx ... \`\`\` You should adjust it to include the full image path: \`\`\`ini ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run --name nginx_nginx docker.io/nginx:latest ... \`\`\` # 3. Reload Systemd and Restart the Service After making any adjustments to the systemd service files, reload systemd to apply the changes and then restart the service to ensure it's using the updated configuration: \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl restart <your-service-name>.service \`\`\` # 4. Run Podman Auto-update Again With the fully-qualified image paths now in place, try running the Podman auto-update command again: \`\`\`bash podman auto-update \`\`\` This should now work without the \\"short name\\" error, as Podman can correctly pull and identify the image from the specified registry. Remember, automation of this process via cron jobs or systemd timers, as previously explained, can help maintain your containers up to date without manual intervention."},{"instruction":"phal aa paenge If the growth of the plant is stopped, will it bear fruit?","output":"No, if the growth of the plant is stopped, it is unlikely that it will bear fruit.

使用浏览器的开发者工具（通常可以通过F12打开）来监控和分析加载视频时发出的网络请求。 - 寻找加载视频内容的请求，这通常是XHR（XMLHttpRequest）或Fetch请求。 - 观察请求的URL、头信息（Headers）、响应内容等，看是否能直接获得视频资源链接和对应的描述信息。 # 2. 识别API调用 - 分析那些负责预加载视频的API调用。这些请求可能包含了视频信息，包括接下来要播放的视频链接、标题和描述等。 - 查找API返回的数据格式，如JSON，这通常包含了视频的直接链接和相应的描述信息。 # 3. 编写脚本或使用工具 - 根据上述分析，使用如Python等编程语言，利用请求（requests）库或类似工具来模拟这些网页请求。 - 处理API返回的数据，抽取视频URL和描述信息等。 # 4. 注意事项 - **用户代理（User-Agent）**：模拟请求时，设置合适的用户代理字符串，以避免被识别为爬虫。 - **遵守Robots协议**：在进行Web爬虫操作之前，应当检查目标网站的\`robots.txt\`文件，确保不违反网站的爬取规则。 - **速度与频率**：合理控制请求的频率，避免对目标服务器造成不必要的负担。 - **节流**：如果网站实现了预加载机制，那么可能需要设计策略只处理当前播放的视频，忽略或延后处理预加载的视频。 # 5. 特定工具 - 对于某些短视频平台，可能已经有开发者制作了特定的下载工具或脚本，如youtube-dl（虽然主要是针对YouTube，但也支持大量其他平台）。 - 使用这些现成的工具可以大大简化下载过程，但可能需要定期更新以跟上目标网站的变化。 # 6. 法律与伦理 - 在进行任何形式的网络爬虫或数据抓取活动之前，务必考虑到法律和伦理问题，确保不侵犯版权或违反数据使用政策。 进行这种类型的任务既充满挑战也充满风险，务必确保你的行为符合所有相关法律法规以及网站的使用条款。"},{"instruction":"使用python写一个把页面中的XHR 或Fetch请求的返回的数据保存到指定目录下的程序","output":"为了完成这样一个任务，我们可以使用Python的几个强大库：\`requests\`用于发送网络请求，以及\`json\`用于处理JSON数据。以下是一个简单的示例，演示了如何捕获XHR或Fetch请求的响应数据并将其保存到指定目录下。 首先，确保安装了\`requests\`库。如果没有安装，可以通过运行\`pip install requests\`来安装它。 然后，可以使用以下脚本： \`\`\`python import requests import json import os def save_xhr_or_fetch_response(url, params=None, headers=None, save_path='.', file_name='response.json'): \\"\\"\\" 发送XHR或Fetch请求，将返回的数据保存到指定目录下。 参数: -

用于表示行的\`<div>\`元素的类名或特定结构。 - 用于表示列或单元格的子\`<div>\`元素。 - 任何重复的模式或属性，可以帮助你通过编程逻辑定位和迭代表格行和列。 # 2. 定位和提取数据 利用找到的模式，使用Selenium、BeautifulSoup或类似工具来编写代码，定位表格的行和列，并提取所需的数据。 以Selenium为例，伪代码如下： \`\`\`python rows = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'div.row-class') # 假设'row-class'是构成每一行的div的类名 table_data = [] for row in rows: columns = row.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'div.column-class') # 'column-class'是内部定义每个单元格的div的类名 row_data = [col.text for col in columns] table_data.append(row_data) # 'table_data'现在包含了所有行和列的文本数据 \`\`\` # 3. 保存数据 一旦你有了结构化的数据（例如，一个二维的列表），就可以使用例如\`pandas\`这样的库轻松地将数据保存到Excel文件中。 \`\`\`python import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame(table_data) df.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False) \`\`\` # 4. 自动识别结构 完全自动化地识别由\`<div>\`构成的表格结构是一个挑战性任务，因为它依赖于页面的特定布局和CSS设计。没有通用的解决方案，因为每个网页可能完全不同。不过，一些高级的技术方法可能包括： - **机器学习**：使用机器学习技术来分析网页结构并识别出表格。这需要大量的前期工作，包括数据标注和模型训练。 - **高级XPath或CSS选择器**：如果页面中的\`<div>\`结构有一定的规律性，可能编写复杂但精确的XPath或CSS选择器来匹配行和列。 - **自定义解析逻辑**：基于对目标网站结构的深入理解，开发特定的解析逻辑来提取和重构表格数据。 要注意，无论采用哪种方法，都需要一定的定制化工作来针对特定的网页布局。这些方法可能需要耗费大量的时间来实现，并且对于不同的网页，其复用性可能也很有限。"},{"instruction":"有没有比较智能的方式去识别出网页中的表格结构？ 毕竟最终呈现出来的结果是明显的表格特征。","output":"智能识别网页中的表格结构，特别是那些不使用\`<table>\`标签而是用\`<div>\`等其他HTML元素构建的表格，是一个挑战，因为这种任务通常需要对页面布局有深入的理解。虽然没有直接的、万能的方法可以解决所有情况，但有几种技术或工具可以尝试，以便更智能地寻找和解析这些非标准表格。 # 1. 机器学习和视觉模型 一些高级的方法，如使用机器学习（尤其是**计算机视觉模型**）可以帮助识别和解析由\`<div>\`构成的表格。这些方法可能涉及识别网页快照中的表格边界、行列结构等。例如，通过训练一个模型来识别网页截图中的表格状结构，然后根据识别出的行列关系去抓取实际的数据。不过，这种方法需要大量的数据来训练模型，且实施起来相当复杂。 # 2. 高级HTML解析和模式识别 使用高级的HTML解析和模式识别技术也是一种可能的方案。通过分析DOM结构，识别出常用于表示行和列的\`<div>\`布局模式（例如通过样式类名、ID或数据属性等特征）。这种方法依赖于对特定页面的深入分析，并可能需要为不同网站编写特定的规则。 # 3. 第三方服务或工具 某些第三方服务或工具可能提供了智能化的网页表格识别功能，例如Diffbot、Import.io等。这些工具通常使用先进的算法来自动识别和解析网页数据，包括复杂的\`<div>\`布局表格。使用这些工具或服务可以节省大量的时间和资源，特别是当处理众多网站或面对复杂页面结构时。 # 4. 交互式机器学习工具 一些工具，如Tabula或Camelot，主要用于识别和提取PDF文件中的表格数据。虽然它们主要面向PDF，但类似的原理也可以应用于网页数据的提取，尤其是在使用视觉方法识别表格结构方面。这需要将网页转换为图像或PDF，然后应用这些工具进行识别和提取。 # 实施建议 在决定最佳方案时，考虑以下因素： - **精确度和效率**：机器学习模型可能提供最高的灵活性和准确性，但也是最复杂和成本最高的方法。 - **特定网站的通用性**：特定规则和模式匹配可能在某些网站上工作得很好，但难以扩展到其他网站。 - **成本和易用性**：第三方服务或工具提供了相对易用的解决方案，但可能涉及成本或数据隐私的考量。 通常，遵循一种混合方法，结合规则驱动的解析对于已知布局的网站，以及利用第三方工具或自定义机器学习模型来处理更复杂或变化的数据布局，可能是最有效的策略。"},{"instruction":"怎样把使用selenium 加载的页面里面的图片， 视频，还有一些未知格式的文件保存到指定的目录下","output":"使用Selenium加载页面后保存页面中的图片、视频以及其他格式的文件到指定目录的过程，大致可以分为以下几个步骤： 1. **使用Selenium获取资源的URL：** 你需要先使用Selenium定位到这些资源的URL。对于图片，通常是\`<img>\`标签的\`src\`属性；对于视频，可能是\`<video>\`标签的\`src\`属性或通过JavaScript动态加载的。其他未知格式的文件同理，关键是定位到文件资源的URL。 2. **请求资源文件：** 一旦获取到文件的URL，你可以使用Python的\`requests\`库或其他HTTP客户端工具下载这些资源。 3. **保存文件到本地目录：** 使用请求得到的内容，按照原文件格式保存到本地。 下面是一个简单的例子，演示如何使用Selenium和Requests库完成这个任务： # 安装所需库 如果你还没有安装Selenium和Requests，可以通过pip安装它们： \`\`\`bash pip install selenium requests \`\`\` # 示例代码 \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver import requests import os # 配置WebDriver driver_path = '/path/to/your/webdriver' # 指定WebDriver路径 driver = webdriver.Chrome(driver_path) # 设置保存目录 save_directory = '/path/to/your/directory' if not os.path.exists(save_directory): os.makedirs(save_directory) # 打开网页 driver.get('http://example.com') # 找到所有图片元素 images = driver.find_elements_by_tag_name('img') for img in images: src = img.get_attribute('src') if src: file_name = src.split('/')[-1] # 简单处理，直接使用URL最后一部分作为文件名 file_path = os.path.join(save_directory, file_name) # 使用requests下载图片 response = requests.get(src) if response.status_code == 200: with open(file_path, 'wb') as f: f.write(response.content) # 对视频和未知格式文件重复上面的过程，根据具体标签和属性适当修改 driver.quit() \`\`\` 请注意，这个示例代码非常简单，主要用于演示基本过程。在实际使用中，你可能需要处理各种复杂情况，例如： -

以下是一个简化的Python示例，展示了如何从性能日志中提取图片URL。这个例子假设你已经按照之前的示例获取了性能日志\`performance_logs\`： \`\`\`python import json image_urls = [] for entry in performance_logs: log = json.loads(entry[\\"message\\"])[\\"message\\"] # 检查条目是不是网络请求响应且有URL if log[\\"method\\"] == \\"Network.responseReceived\\" and 'url' in log['params']['response']: response =

image_urls.append(url) # 去重 image_urls = list(set(image_urls)) # 打印或者进一步处理图片URL for url in image_urls: print(url) \`\`\` 这个脚本会遍历所有性能日志条目，检查每个条目以找到那些由\`Network.responseReceived\`事件记录的并且URL以常见图片扩展名（如.png、.jpg）结尾的资源。然后，它将这些图片的URL保存到\`image_urls\`列表中。最后，通过将列表转换成集合来去除重复的URL，再把它们打印出来或进行进一步处理。 请注意，这个方法基于文件扩展名来判断资源是否为图片。一种更准确的方法是检查HTTP响应头中的\`Content-Type\`字段，以确认资源的MIME类型是否为某种图像格式（如\`image/jpeg\`、\`image/png\`等）。不过，由于性能日志的具体格式可能随着浏览器版本和WebDriver的实现而有所不同，你可能需要根据实际情况调整代码以正确提取信息。"},{"instruction":"用上面的方法可以获取到页面的一小部分图片的url，怎么解决？","output":"如果使用上述方法只能获取到页面的一小部分图片URL，可能是因为以下几个原因： 1. **图片是通过JavaScript动态加载的**：很多现代网站为了提高性能，会采用懒加载技术，即只有当图片滚动到视口中时才会加载。这意味着一开始页面加载时，并不会加载所有图片，从而造成无法通过静态分析性能日志获取全部图片URL的情况。 2. **一些图片请求可能不直接以图片扩展名结束**：有时候，图片可能通过脚本或API动态请求，URL可能不包含常规的图片扩展名（如.png、.jpg等），而是以API端点或带有查询参数的URL结尾。 为了解决这些问题，你可以尝试以下方法： # 1. 滚动页面以触发所有图片的加载 在使用Selenium时，可以编写脚本来模拟用户滚动页面的行为，从而触发所有懒加载图片的加载： \`\`\`python from selenium import webdriver import time # 你的Selenium WebDriver初始化代码 # 模拟滚动到页面底部，以触发懒加载元素 driver.execute_script(\\"window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);\\") # 等待额外内容加载 time.sleep(3) # 之后再获取性能日志并提取图片URL \`\`\` # 2. 分析网络活动获取图片 而不是仅仅通过资源的URL后缀来判断，如果可能的话，考虑进一步分析响应的MIME类型。这通常需要更复杂的日志分析，检查每个\`Network.responseReceived\`类型的条目的\`mimeType\`字段来判断资源是否为图片： \`\`\`python for entry in performance_logs: log = json.loads(entry[\\"message\\"])[\\"message\\"] if log[\\"method\\"] == \\"Network.responseReceived\\" and 'mimeType' in log['params']['response']: mimeType = log[\\"params\\"][\\"response\\"][\\"mimeType\\"] # 检查MIME类型是否为图像 if \\"image\\" in mimeType: url = log[\\"params\\"][\\"response\\"][\\"url\\"] image_urls.append(url) \`\`\` # 3. 使用第三方服务或工具 对于非常动态的网页，分析性能日志来获取所有图片可能不是最有效的方法。在这种情况下，考虑使用第三方服务或工具（如Web Scraper插件、BeautifulSoup结合Selenium等），它们可能提供更高级的网页分析功能。 # 4. 检查其他网络请求类型 除了直接检查\`Network.responseReceived\`响应外，还可以探索其他相关的网络请求类型，比如\`Network.requestWillBeSent\`，用以追踪实际发送的请求。这需要对性能日志的结构有更深入的理解。 通过使用上述方法，你可能能够获取到更多通过正常页面加载以及用户交互（例如滚动）才会加载的图片。不过，每个网页的具体情况都不一样，可能需要多种方法的组合来解决问题。"},{"instruction":"在chrome的devtools里面如果response是视频文件， devtools能识别出来，怎样可以通过性能日志条目的内容识别出来。","output":"要通过Chrome的性能日志识别出视频文件，你需要分析网络请求的MIME类型。视频文件通常具有特定的MIME类型，例如\`video/mp4\`, \`video/webm\`等。在Chrome DevTools的性能日志中，每个网络请求响应(\`Network.responseReceived\`)条目都会包含关于该请求的详细信息，其中包括响应的MIME类型。通过检查这个MIME类型，我们可以判断响应是否为视频文件。 以下是一个Python示例，展示如何分析性能日志以识别和提取视频URL。这继续假设你已经按照之前的示例获取了性能日志\`performance_logs\`： \`\`\`python import json video_urls = [] for entry in performance_logs: # 将日志条目的字符串内容解析为JSON log = json.loads(entry['message'])['message'] # 检查事件类型是否为Network.responseReceived来获取响应信息 if log['method']

list(set(video_urls)) # 输出或进一步处理视频URL for url in video_urls: print(url) \`\`\` 这段代码会遍历所有性能日志条目，寻找那些其MIME类型包含\`video/\`的响应，然后从这些响应中提取URL。这样，你就能得到页面上所有通过HTTP或HTTPS请求加载的视频文件的URL。 请注意，对于通过JavaScript动态加载的视频内容，仅靠解析初始加载时的性能日志可能不足以捕获所有视频URL。在这种情况下，可能需要模拟用户交互（如点击、滚动等），触发动态加载过程，然后再次收集和分析性能日志。 此外，不同版本的Chrome和WebDriver可能会以稍有不同的方式记录性能日志。因此，如果你在实际使用中遇到问题，建议检查你使用的具体版本的文档，以获取最准确的信息。"},{"instruction":"能不能从Chrome浏览器的cache里面把已经在页面里面加载好的视频文件提取出来？","output":"直接从Chrome浏览器的缓存中提取视频文件（或其他任何类型的文件）是一项复杂的任务，并且涉及到多个技术和安全隐患。Chrome浏览器（以及大多数现代浏览器）设计时高度重视用户的隐私和安全，因此直接访问其缓存文件系统不是一个简单或直接支持的操作。 尽管可能存在一些间接的方法来尝试从浏览器缓存中提取视频文件，但它们通常需要较高的技术技能，可能需要特定的工具或软件，并且对于不同的操作系统和浏览器版本，方法也会有所不同。此外，这些方法可能会违背用户隐私政策和浏览器的安全准则。因此，我们不推荐尝试从浏览器缓存中直接提取内容。 # 替代方法 如果你需要保存网页中的视频，以下是一些更为合适的方法： 1. **使用网页开发者工具：** 大多数现代浏览器（包括Chrome）都配备了开发者工具，你可以使用这些工具查看和分析网络请求。通过监视网络请求，你可能能够找到视频资源的直接链接，然后可以直接访问和下载这些链接。 2. **使用第三方软件或服务：** 存在许多专门设计来下载网页内容的第三方软件和服务，包括用于下载视频的工具。这些工具通常会分析网页并尝试提取媒体资源链接。不过，在使用这些工具时，请确保它们是信誉良好的，以避免安全风险。 3. **API请求：** 如果视频内容是通过API请求动态加载的，可以尝试分析这些API请求并直接从API端点获取视频。这要求你能理解网页的网络活动，并能够模拟任何必须的请求头部或参数。 4. **编写脚本：** 对于具有一定编程经验的用户，可以使用像Selenium这样的自动化工具来模拟浏览器行为，从而触发视频的加载并尝试以编程方式捕获视频源。 # 注意事项 - 在尝试下载网站上的视频或其他内容时，始终要确保你的行为遵守相关法律和网站的服务条款。未经授权下载版权保护的内容可能是非法的。 - 访问和分析网络请求需要一定的技术知识，并且对于每个网站或页面，可能需要不同的方法。 总而言之，直接访问浏览器缓存以获取视频不是推荐的做法。使用开发者工具或第三方工具在保证合法和遵守版权的前提下下载所需的视频内容通常是更好的选择。"},{"instruction":"下面这种标签， 使用selenium怎么定位 <video class autoplay playsinline=\\"true\\" x5-playsinline=\\"true\\"

**元素加载时间**：如果元素加载时间较长，3秒可能不足以等待元素变为可见。这是常见的问题之一，特别是在网络状态不佳或目标网页动态内容较多的情况下。你可以尝试增加等待时间，如从3秒增加到10秒或更长，看是否可以解决问题。 2. **元素类名变化**：网站前端代码可能会时常更新，导致类名(\`\\"xg-video-container\\"\`)发生变化。建议检查网页源代码确认当前类名是否仍然存在，或者是否有类似的替代类名。 3. **动态内容/懒加载**：页面上的某些元素可能是通过JavaScript动态加载的，而不是在页面最初加载时就直接存在于DOM中。如果页面使用了大量的JavaScript来动态加载内容，可能需要触发一些操作（比如滚动页面）以确保元素被加载。 4. **iframe问题**：如果指定的元素是嵌套在\`iframe\`内的，需要先切换到那个\`iframe\`，只有在正确的上下文中Selenium才能找到元素： \`\`\`python iframe = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until( EC.presence_of_element_located((By.TAG_NAME, \\"iframe\\")) ) driver.switch_to.frame(iframe) \`\`\` 5. **不正确的选择器**：尽管\`By.CLASS_NAME\`通常可以很好地工作，但在使用复合类名时可能会出现问题。如果“xg-video-container”不是元素上的唯一类名，或者如果该类名是由空格分隔的多个类名的一部分，使用\`By.CSS_SELECTOR\`可能更可靠一些： \`\`\`python video_element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until( EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, \\".xg-video-container\\")) ) \`\`\` 综上，如果调整上述建议仍未成功定位元素，建议重新审查网络请求以确认页面是否已完全加载了想要的内容，或者是否需要触发特定的行为（例如页面滚动）来加载目标元素。此外，重新检查和确认目标元素的选择器确实正确且适用于当前页面的状态也是必要的。"},{"instruction":"如果driver没有find_element_by_class_name这个方法，
