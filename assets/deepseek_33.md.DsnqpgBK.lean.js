How should Ivan Tsarevich act to cut off all of the Snake's heads and tails as quickly as possible?","output":"To solve the problem of Ivan-Tsarevich chopping off all of the heads and tails of the serpent as efficiently as possible, we must achieve an even number of heads and zero tails on the serpent. Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Identify the effective actions**:    - Chopping off one head is ineffective as it causes the head to grow back.    - Therefore, we can focus on three types of actions:      - First action: Chop off two tails, causing the number of tails to increase by 1.      - Second action: Chop off one tail, causing the number of tails to decrease by 2 and the number of heads to increase by 1.      - Third action: Chop off two heads, causing the number of heads to decrease by 2. 2. **Effect on Parity**:    - The second action changes the parity of the number of heads. Since we start with an odd number (say n) of heads, to achieve an even number of heads (ultimately zero), we need an odd number of second actions because only this action changes the parity of heads.    - The number of second actions must be odd (i.e., at least 3 to ensure the heads become even). 3. **Chopping Actions Analysis**:    - Each second action increases the number of heads by 1 and decreases the number of tails by 2.

Expanding and simplifying the equation gives:  y_1 = (20 + x) times (300 - 10x)   y_1 = 20 times 300 + 300x - 20 times 10x - x times 10x   y_1 = 6000 + 300x - 200x - 10x^2   y_1 = -10x^2 + 100x + 6000  Thus, the function relating y_1 to x is:    y_1(x) = -10x^2 + 100x + 6000  2.

By finding the Cartesian coordinate equations of curves C_{1} and C_{2} as x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}(R > 0) and x-y-2=0 respectively, and knowing that C_{1} and C_{2} have common points, we can deduce that the distance from the center C_{1}(0,0) to the line x-y-2=0 is dleqslant R, which allows us to determine the range of values for R. This problem examines the method of finding the range of values for the radius of a circle, which is a basic question. When solving the problem, it is important to carefully read the question and appropriately apply the formulas for converting between Cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates, as well as the formula for the distance from a point to a line."},{"instruction":"A convex figure Phi has an area S and a semiperimeter p. Prove that if S > n p for some natural number n, then Phi contains at least n integer points.","output":"In this solution, we are using the Minkowski theorem and mathematical induction to prove the given statement. Let's go step-by-step. 1. **Base Case (n=1):**     - When n=1, we need to show that if S > 1cdot p, then Phi contains at least 1 integer point.      - This is self-evident as with S > p, any convex figure Phi must contain at least 1 integer point within its perimeter. 2. **Inductive Step:**     - Assume the statement is true for some n=k. That is, if S > k p, then Phi can be divided into k convex figures, each with an area greater than its semi-perimeter and each containing at least one integer point.     - We need to show that the statement holds for n=k+1. That is, if S > (k+1) p, then Phi should contain at least k+1 integer points. 3. **Dividing the Figure (Phi):**     - Given S > (k+1)p, let's divide Phi by a straight line into two convex figures, Phi_1 and Phi_2, with areas S_1 and S_2 such that:       [       S_1 = frac{S}{k+1}, quad S_2 = frac{kS}{k+1}       ]     - Let p_1 and p_2 be the semi-perimeters of Phi_1 and Phi_2, respectively. Clearly, we have:       [       p_1 < p, quad p_2 < p       ] 4. **Applying Inductive Hypothesis:**     - For Phi_1, since S_1 = frac{S}{k+1} and it is separated directly from Phi, we have:       [       S_1 = frac{S}{k+1} > p > p_1       ]       This ensures that Phi_1 has an area greater than its semi-perimeter p_1.     - For Phi_2, we have:       [       S_2 = frac{kS}{k+1}       ]       Given S > (k+1)p, it follows that:       [       frac{kS}{k+1} > kp, quad text{or} quad S_2 > kp       ]       By the inductive hypothesis, Phi_2 can be further divided into k convex figures, each with an area greater than its semi-perimeter. 5. **Conclusion:**     - Therefore, combining Phi_1 and the k parts of Phi_2, we have at least 1 + k = k+1 integer points within the convex figure Phi. Thus, by induction, we have shown that if S > np, then the convex figure Phi contains at least n integer points. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Calen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and Caleb has some less than twice as many pencils as does Candy.

According to the problem, P_Candy = 9. The problem states that Caleb has some number less than twice as many pencils as Candy. So, we can write this as: P_Caleb = 2 * P_Candy - X, where X is the number of pencils Caleb has less than twice the number of pencils Candy has. Calen originally had 5 more pencils than Caleb, so we can write this as: P_Calen_original = P_Caleb + 5. We know that after losing 10 pencils, Calen has 10 pencils left. So, we can write: P_Calen_original - 10 = 10. Now we can substitute P_Calen_original with P_Caleb + 5: P_Caleb + 5 - 10 = 10 P_Caleb - 5 = 10 P_Caleb = 15. Now we know Caleb has 15 pencils.

By properties of proportions, we can extend this to frac{a}{sin A} = frac{a+b+c}{sin A+sin B+sin C}. Therefore, statement A is correct. **Statement B:** Given the condition for an oblique triangle, we can express tan C in terms of A and B as tan C = tan[pi-(A+B)] = -tan(A+B). Using the tangent addition formula, we get -frac{tan A + tan B}{1-tan Atan B}. Therefore, we have tan A + tan B + tan C = tan C(tan Atan B - 1) + tan C = tan Atan Btan C. Hence, statement B is correct. **Statement C:** Given overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{CB} > 0, we find overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{CB} = |overrightarrow{AC}| cdot |overrightarrow{CB}| cos(pi-C) = -abcos C > 0. This implies cos C < 0, indicating that angle C is obtuse. Thus, triangle ABC cannot be an acute triangle, making statement C incorrect. **Statement D:** Given frac{a}{cos A} = frac{b}{cos B} = frac{c}{cos C}, we can infer frac{sin A}{cos A} = frac{sin B}{cos B} = frac{sin C}{cos C}, which simplifies to tan A = tan B = tan C.

[ includegraphics[height=314,width=800]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_22b0ba5e8c5a1f49bd81g-220.jpg} ] 4. Let us examine the new polygonal chain formed when the two intersecting segments are replaced with the diagonal segments of the convex quadrilateral. 5. The length of the new polygonal chain must be less than the original polygonal chain because the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides of a convex quadrilateral is smaller than the sum of the lengths of the diagonals. **Detailed Calculation:** - Let the two intersecting segments be ((A, B)) and ((C, D)). - The lengths of these segments are (|AB|) and (|CD|). - When replaced with the non-intersecting segments, we get ((A, C)) and ((B, D)). - The lengths of these new segments are (|AC|) and (|BD|). 6. By the properties of a convex quadrilateral: [ |AC| + |BD| < |AB| + |CD| ] This inequality indicates that the length of the newly formed non-intersecting polygonal chain is less than the length of the original polygonal chain. 7. This contradicts the initial assumption that the given polygonal chain is of the smallest length, as there exists a polygonal chain with a smaller length. Conclusion: Therefore, the smallest length closed polygonal chain cannot have intersecting segments, meaning it must be a non-self-intersecting polygonal chain. Thus, the given chain must be non-self-intersecting.

It is known that these tangents intersect to form a convex hexagon whose sides are alternately colored red and blue. Prove that the sum of the lengths of the red segments is equal to the sum of the lengths of the blue segments.","output":"1. Let's denote the points of tangency as ( X_1, X_2, Y_1, Y_2, Z_1, Z_2 ), and the vertices of the hexagon as ( A, B, C, D, E, F ) (see the diagram for reference). 2. Since the radii of all the circles are equal, we have:    [    X_1O_2 = O_1Y_2, quad Y_1O_3 = O_2Z_2, quad Z_1O_1 = O_3X_2    ] 3. Rewrite the expressions in terms of the lengths involving the points of tangency and the vertices:    [    X_1A + AB + BO_2 = O_1B + BC + CY_2    ]    [    Y_1C + CD + DO_3 = O_2D + DE + EZ_2    ]    [    Z_1E + EF + FO_1 = O_3F + FA + AX_2    ] 4. Adding these expressions together and recognizing the equal segments:    [    X_1A + AB + BO_2 + Y_1C + CD + DO_3 + Z_1E + EF + FO_1 = O_1B + BC + CY_2 + O_2D + DE + EZ_2 + O_3F + FA + AX_2    ] 5. Observe the congruence of tangential segments from each vertex to the points of tangency:    [    X_1A = AX_2, quad Y_1C = CY_2, quad Z_1E = EZ_2    ]    (These are tangents drawn from a single exterior point, hence they are equal by the tangent-segment theorem.) 6. Furthermore, since the circles have equal radii:    [    BO_2 = O_1B, quad DO_3 = O_2D, quad FO_1 = O_3F    ]    (Each segment is congruent as they represent equal lengths from the circle centers to tangency points.) 7. Substituting these equal segments into our sum, we can simplify:    [    AB + CD + EF + BO_2 + DO_3 + FO_1 = BC + DE + FA + O_1B + O_2D + O_3F    ] 8. Simplifying further and recognizing symmetry:    [    AB + CD + EF + BO_2 + DO_3 + FO_1 = AB + CD + EF + BO_1 + DO_2 + FO_3    ] 9. Therefore, we conclude that:    [    AB + CD + EF = BC + DE + FA    ] This establishes that the sum of the lengths of the red segments equals the sum of the lengths of the blue segments, as required.

For instance, the vertices  100  and  101  on the  3  dimensional hypercube are connected, but the vertices  100  and  111  are not.","output":"1. **Understanding the structure of the hypercube:**    - An n-dimensional hypercube has 2^n vertices.    - Each vertex can be represented by an n-bit binary string.    - Two vertices are connected by an edge if their binary representations differ in exactly one bit. 2. **Labeling the vertices:**    - Let each vertex v_i be labeled with a real number x_i.    - The edge between vertices v_i and v_j is labeled with the product x_i x_j. 3. **Summing the edge labels:**    - Each vertex v_i is connected to n other vertices (since flipping any one of the n bits results in a neighboring vertex).    - Therefore, each x_i appears in n different edge products.    - The total sum S of the edge labels is given by:      [      S = sum_{text{edges } (v_i, v_j)} x_i x_j      ]    - Since each edge is counted twice in the sum, we can write:      [      S = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{2^n} sum_{j text{ adjacent to } i} x_i x_j      ] 4. **Simplifying the sum:**    - Each x_i appears in n terms of the form x_i x_j for each of its n neighbors.    - Thus, the sum can be rewritten as:      [      S = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{2^n} x_i left( sum_{j text{ adjacent to } i} x_j right)      ] 5. **Using symmetry and convexity:**    - By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM), the minimum value of S is attained when all x_i are equal.    - Let x_i = c for all i. Then:      [      S = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{2^n} c left( sum_{j text{ adjacent to } i} c right) = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{2^n} c cdot (n cdot c) = frac{1}{2} cdot 2^n cdot n cdot c^2 = n cdot 2^{n-1} cdot c^2      ] 6. **Calculating the ratio:**    - The sum of the squares of the labels is:      [      sum_{i=1}^{2^n} x_i^2 = sum_{i=1}^{2^n} c^2 = 2^n cdot c^2      ]    - Therefore, the ratio frac{S}{sum_{i=1}^{2^n} x_i^2} is:      [      frac{S}{sum_{i=1}^{2^n} x_i^2} = frac{n cdot 2^{n-1} cdot c^2}{2^n cdot c^2} = frac{n cdot 2^{n-1}}{2^n} = frac{n}{2}      ] The final answer is boxed{frac{n}{2}}"},{"instruction":"Given real numbers ( a, b, c, d ) that satisfy ( 5a + 6b  7c + 4d = 1 ), what is the minimum value of ( 3a^2 + 2b^2 + 5c^2 + d^2 )?","output":"Given that real numbers (a, b, c,) and (d) satisfy the equation: [ 5a + 6b - 7c + 4d = 1, ] we aim to find the minimum value of (3a^2 + 2b^2 + 5c^2 + d^2). 1. **Square the Equation:**    [    1 = (5a + 6b - 7c + 4d)^2    ] 2. **Cosine-Schwarz Inequality:**        By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (also sometimes misnamed here as \\"Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality\\" in vector form), we have:    [    (x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + x_3y_3 + x_4y_4)^2 leq (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2)(y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2),    ]    with suitable choice of vectors. 3. **Apply Inequality with Our Scenario:**        Here, the specific (x_i) terms can be adjusted to factor our current variables.

Determine the range of values for the real number a.","output":"To solve this problem, we analyze the behavior of each factor in the given inequality for arbitrary x in (0, +infty). Define two functions f(x) = 2x + ln x and g(x) = -2x^{2} + ax + 5. The function f(x) is monotonically increasing over the interval (0, +infty). Now let's consider three cases: 1. When 0 < x < a, we have f(x) < f(a), which implies that (2x + ln x) - (2a + ln a) < 0. Therefore, in order for the inequality to hold, the second factor must satisfy -2x^{2} + ax + 5 geq 0. Evaluating g(x) at x = 0 and x = a gives us g(0) = 5 geq 0 and g(a) = -a^{2} + 5 geq 0, respectively. From this, we obtain the condition 0 < a leq sqrt{5}. 2. When x = a, the inequality is trivially true since (2x + ln x) - (2a + ln a) = 0. 3. When x > a, we have f(x) > f(a), which gives us (2x + ln x) - (2a + ln a) > 0. In this case, the inequality requires that -2x^{2} + ax + 5 leq 0. Moreover, since g(x) = -2(x - frac{a}{4})^{2} + frac{a^{2}}{8} + 5 is monotonically decreasing in the interval (a, +infty), we get g(x) < g(a) = 5 - a^{2} leq 0 for x > a, which again gives us a leq sqrt{5}.

Denote ( M ) as the set of centers of these squares. We need to prove that it is possible to select a subset of these squares in such a way that each point in ( M ) belongs to at least one and at most four of the selected squares. 1. **Selection of Squares:**    - Let us denote the squares as ( K_1, K_2, ldots, K_{1000} ).    - First, select the largest square ( K_1 ). If there is a tie, the selection can be arbitrary among the largest ones.        - Next, select the largest square ( K_2 ) whose center does not lie inside ( K_1 ).        - Continue this process iteratively: for ( K_{i+1} ), select the largest square whose center is not inside any previously selected square ( K_1, K_2, ldots, K_i ).     2. **Contradiction Argument:**    - Assume that during this process, a center ( C ) of some square is covered by more than four selected squares.        - Consider the axes of symmetry of the square centered at ( C ), which divide the plane into four quadrants.        - Since ( C ) is covered by more than four selected squares, there must be at least one pair of these squares (say ( K_t ) and ( K_i )) whose centers lie in the same quadrant.      This contradicts our selection rule because if both ( K_t ) and ( K_i ) are selected squares, and their centers lie in the same quadrant relative to ( C ), the center that is farther from the axes of symmetry (either by sum of distances or the maximum distance) would contain the center of the other square. 3. **Conclusion:**    - Since our selection process ensures that each step selects the largest square that does not have its center inside any previously selected square, every point in ( M ) will end up being covered by at least one and at most four selected squares.     Therefore, the proposition is true, and we can select a subset of squares meeting the given condition.

This event can happen in one of three scenarios: 1. **The car enters before the k-th intersection and continues straight through it:**     a. The probability that the car enters the highway at any intersection is frac{1}{n}.          b. If the car enters at any of the first k-1 intersections (from 1 to k-1), there are frac{k-1}{n} such scenarios.          c. The probability that the car doesn't turn at each of the intersections it crosses is frac{k-1}{n} cdot left( frac{n-1}{n} right)^{k-1}.     2. **The car enters at the k-th intersection and continues straight:**     a. The probability for this scenario is the car entering at the k-th intersection, which happens with frac{1}{n} probability.          b. And it continues straight, which happens with a similar unrestricted probability.          Hence, combining both probabilities (frac{1}{n} cdot 1) gives us frac{1}{n}. 3. **The car enters after the k-th intersection and turns onto it:**     a. The car enters between the (k+1)-th intersection and n-th intersection. There are n-k such scenarios.          b. Each of the remaining entrances probability is:     [     frac{n-k}{n}     ]          c.

Step 1: Understand the Constraints 1. For any ( x ) and ( y ) within ([m, n]), (frac{5}{x}+frac{7}{y} ) must be greater than or equal to ( m ) and less than or equal to ( n ).

So we have: (a + b + c) / 3 = 4b Substituting a = 0 into the equation, we get: (b + c) / 3 = 4b Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the denominator, we have: b + c = 12b Subtracting b from both sides, we get: c = 11b Now we need to find the value of c / b: c / b = 11b / b Since b is not zero (it's a positive integer), we can simplify: c / b = 11 Therefore, the value of c / b is boxed{11} ."},{"instruction":"Simplify the fraction frac{180}{270}.","output":"First, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 180 and 270. We'll do this by factoring both numbers to their prime factors. Starting with 180: - 180 is divisible by 2, so 180 = 2 times 90 - 90 is divisible by 2, so 90 = 2 times 45 - 45 is divisible by 3, so 45 = 3 times 15 - 15 is divisible by 3, so 15 = 3 times 5 - 5 is a prime number. Thus, the prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 times 3^2 times 5. Now for 270: - 270 is divisible by 2, so 270 = 2 times 135 - 135 is divisible by 3, so 135 = 3 times 45 - 45 is divisible by 3, so 45 = 3 times 15 - 15 is divisible by 3, so 15 = 3 times 5 - 5 is a prime number. Thus, the prime factorization of 270 is 2 times 3^3 times 5. The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of all prime factors present in both factorizations: - For 2, the lowest power is 2^1. - For 3, the lowest power is 3^2. - For 5, the lowest power in both is 5. Therefore, GCD = 2^1 times 3^2 times 5 = 2 times 9 times 5 = 90. Now, simplify frac{180}{270} by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD: frac{180}{270} = frac{180 div 90}{270 div 90} = frac{2}{3}  Conclusion: boxed{frac{2}{3}}"},{"instruction":"am playing an extended version of a walking game with myself.

This means every pair of cards either shares no common number or shares exactly two common numbers. We will call cards that share exactly two common numbers \\"similar.\\" 2. **Lemma**:     If cards A and B are similar, and cards B and C are similar, then cards A and C are also similar.    **Proof of the Lemma**:     Suppose card A has numbers ( a, b, c ) and card B has numbers ( a, b, d ). Since cards B and C are also similar and share two numbers, this means that card C must have at least one number in common with both a and b because those are the two numbers shared by cards A and B. Hence, cards A and C must also share these two numbers, making them similar. 3. **Implications of the Lemma**:     From the lemma, we can deduce that all the cards can be partitioned into groups such that each group contains only similar cards.  4. **Analysis of the card groups**:    - **Group structure with only three unique numbers**:       If a group of cards contains only three unique numbers, then there can only be one card in that group with those numbers written on it.     - **Group structure with four unique numbers**:       If a group of cards contains four unique numbers, then at most four cards can exist in such a group because each card within the group can only share exactly two numbers with another card.    - **Group structure with more than four unique numbers**:      Let us consider a situation where a group contains numbers ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ). Suppose there exists another number ( e ) which is also on some cards in this group. Since every card pair must have two common numbers, any card with number ( e ) must also include both numbers ( a ) and ( b ). As a result, we can infer that all cards in this group contain the numbers ( a ) and ( b ), which contradicts the rule that numbers are unique on each card. 5. **Final counting argument**:    Given the above analyses, there must be no set of more cards than the total number of used unique numbers. But we are told that Petya filled 21 cards using distinct numbers between 1 and 20. Thus, partitioning these 21 cards where each pair shares two numbers is not feasible because the number of possible groups is limited by the numbers 1 through 20, and this combination would require each group to tightly fit the conditions mentioned above. 6. **Contradiction and conclusion**:    Since we find a contradiction (i.e., it is impossible to fill 21 cards without having at least one pair of cards sharing exactly one number each), our initial assumption must be false.

Since the line PA passes through the points A(-2, 0) and M(x_1, y_1), -2 and x_1 are the two roots of the equation.

Since line BP passes through points B(2, 0) and N(x_2, y_2), 2 and x_2 are roots of the equation, resulting in x_2 = frac{2t^2 - 8}{t^2 + 4}.   Substitute this into y = frac{t}{2}(x - 2) to obtain y_2 = frac{-8t}{t^2 + 4}.   If x_1 = 1, then t^2 = 12, and at this time, x_2 = frac{2t^2 - 8}{t^2+4} = 1.

Solving this, we get a_2 = 3. Similarly, we get a_3 = 5. (2) Method 1 (First Mathematical Induction): From (1), we can conjecture that a_n = 2n - 1 for n in mathbb{N}^*.   To prove this, for n = 1, we have a_1 = 1, and the proposition holds.   Suppose the proposition is true for n = k (where k geq 1), that is a_k = 2k - 1.   Given 2S_k = k(a_{k+1} - 1) and 2S_{k-1} = (k-1)(a_k - 1).   Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get 2a_k = k a_{k+1} - (k-1)a_k - 1, which gives us k a_{k+1} = (k+1)a_k + 1.   Therefore,   a_{k+1} = frac{(k+1)(2k-1)+1}{k} = 2k+1.  This implies the proposition is true for n=k+1.   Hence, by induction, we conclude a_n = 2n - 1 for n in mathbb{N}^*.   Method 2 (Second Mathematical Induction): From (1), we can conjecture that a_n = 2n - 1 for n in mathbb{N}^*.   For n=1, the proposition holds as a_1 = 1.   Assuming the proposition is true for n leq k (where k geq 1), that is a_k = 2k - 1. Thus, S_k = frac{k(1+2k-1)}{2}=k^2.   From 2S_k = k(a_{k+1} - 1), we find   a_{k+1} = frac{2S_k}{k} + 1 = 2k + 1.  This demonstrates that the proposition is also valid for n = k + 1.   Consequently, for n in mathbb{N}^*, we confirm a_n = 2n - 1. Method 3 (Recursive Method): Given 2S_n = n(a_{n+1} - 1), when n geq 2, we have 2S_{n-1} = (n-1)(a_n - 1).   From these, we derive 2a_n = na_{n+1} - (n-1)a_n - 1, which simplifies to na_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n + 1.   Thus, (n+1)a_{n+2} = (n+2)a_{n+1} + 1.   Subtracting the former from the latter,    (n+1)a_{n+2} - na_{n+1} = (n+2)a_{n+1} - (n+1)a_n,  simplifying to (n+1)(a_{n+2} + a_n) = 2(n+1)a_{n+1}, which leads to a_{n+2} + a_n = 2a_{n+1} for n geq 2.   From (1), we know a_1 + a_3 = 2a_2.   Therefore, the sequence {a_n} forms an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 1 and a common difference of 2. Hence, a_n = 2n - 1. Method 4 (Constructing a New Sequence): Given 2S_n = n(a_{n+1} - 1), when n geq 2, we also have 2S_{n-1} = (n-1)(a_n - 1).   From these, we derive 2a_n = na_{n+1} - (n-1)a_n - 1, which simplifies to na_{n+1} = (n+1)a_n + 1.   Dividing both sides by n(n+1), we get   frac{a_{n+1}}{n+1} = frac{a_n}{n} + frac{1}{n(n+1)},  simplifying to   frac{a_{n+1}}{n+1} = frac{a_n}{n} + frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}.  This implies   frac{a_{n+1}}{n+1} + frac{1}{n+1} = frac{a_n}{n} + frac{1}{n} text{ for } n geq 2.  frac{a_1}{1} + 1 = 2, frac{a_2}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 2, which leads to   frac{a_1}{1} + 1 = frac{a_2}{2} + frac{1}{2}.  Hence, the sequence left{frac{a_n}{n} + frac{1}{n}right} is a constant sequence of 2.   Therefore,   frac{a_n}{n} + frac{1}{n} = 2,  which yields a_n = 2n - 1.   As a result, the general formula for the sequence {a_n} is a_n = 2n - 1. (3) Proof: From (2), we know a_n = 2n - 1, thus  S_n = frac{n(1 + 2n - 1)}{2} = n^2 for n in mathbb{N}^*. For n = 1,  frac{1}{S_1} = 1 < frac{7}{4},  therefore, the inequality holds. For n = 2,  frac{1}{S_1} + frac{1}{S_2} = 1 + frac{1}{4} < frac{7}{4},  hence, the inequality is also valid. When n geq 3, since n^2 > (n-1)(n+1), we find  frac{1}{n^2} < frac{1}{(n-1)(n+1)}.  Thus,  frac{1}{S_1} + frac{1}{S_2} + dots + frac{1}{S_n} = frac{1}{1^2} + frac{1}{2^2} + dots + frac{1}{n^2} < 1 + frac{1}{1 times 3} + frac{1}{2 times 4} + dots  + frac{1}{(n-2) times n} + frac{1}{(n-1) times (n+1)} = 1 + frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{1} - frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{5} + dots + frac{1}{n-2} - frac{1}{n} + frac{1}{n-1} - frac{1}{n+1}right) = 1 + frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}right) = frac{7}{4} + frac{1}{2}left(-frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}right) < frac{7}{4}. Therefore, for n geq 3, the inequality is still satisfied.

So, the speed of the train in m/s is: ( 45 ) km/hr ( times frac{1}{3.6} ) m/s/km/hr ( = 12.5 ) m/s The train needs to cover the distance of its own length plus the 200 m lead of the jogger to pass the jogger completely. So, the total distance the train needs to cover is ( 210 ) m + ( 200 ) m ( = 410 ) m. The train passes the jogger in ( 41 ) seconds, so we can calculate the relative speed between the train and the jogger in m/s as the total distance divided by the time taken: ( v_{relative} = frac{410 text{ m}}{41 text{ s}} = 10 text{ m/s} ) The relative speed is also the difference between the speed of the train and the speed of the jogger because they are moving in the same direction. So we can write: ( v_{relative} = v_{train} - v_{jogger} ) We already have ( v_{train} = 12.5 ) m/s and ( v_{relative} = 10 ) m/s, so we can solve for ( v_{jogger} ) in m/s: ( v_{jogger} = v_{train} - v_{relative} ) ( v_{jogger} = 12.5 text{ m/s} - 10 text{ m/s} ) ( v_{jogger} = 2.5 text{ m/s} ) Now, we convert the jogger's speed back to km/hr: ( v_{jogger} ) km/hr ( = 2.5 text{ m/s} times frac{3.6}{1} text{ km/hr/m/s} ) ( v_{jogger} ) km/hr ( = 9 text{ km/hr} ) Therefore, the speed of the jogger is ( boxed{9}  ) km/hr."},{"instruction":"2 trains in same direction at 50 km / hr , 32 km / hr . a man in slower train observes 15 sec elapse before the faster train completely passed by him what is length of faster train ?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative speed of the two trains as seen by the man in the slower train. Since both trains are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the slower train from the speed of the faster train to get the relative speed. Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 50 km/hr - 32 km/hr Relative speed = 18 km/hr Now, we need to convert this relative speed from km/hr to m/s because the time given is in seconds and we want to find the length in meters. To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s So, Relative speed in m/s = 18 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 18 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 18 * (5 / 18) Relative speed in m/s = 5 m/s The man in the slower train observes that it takes 15 seconds for the faster train to completely pass by him. This means that the entire length of the faster train travels past the man in 15 seconds at the relative speed of 5 m/s.

Given ( a_k^2 equiv -7 pmod{2^k} ), consider the two possibilities:    [    a_k^2 equiv -7 pmod{2^{k+1}} quad text{or} quad a_k^2 equiv 2^k - 7 pmod{2^{k+1}}    ]    - **Case 1:** If ( a_k^2 equiv -7 pmod{2^{k+1}} ), then we can take ( a_{k+1} = a_k ).    - **Case 2:** If ( a_k^2 equiv 2^k - 7 pmod{2^{k+1}} ), consider ( a_{k+1} = a_k + 2^{k-1} ).

We then have:      [      begin{aligned}      a_{k+1}^2 &equiv -7 + 2^k (2m) pmod{2^{k+1}}       &equiv -7 + 2^{k+1} m pmod{2^{k+1}}       &equiv -7 pmod{2^{k+1}}       end{aligned}      ] Thus, in both cases, we have a positive integer ( a_{k+1} ) such that ( a_{k+1}^2 equiv -7 pmod{2^{k+1}} ). Therefore, by induction, there exists a positive integer ( a_k ) satisfying ( a_k^2 equiv -7 pmod{2^k} ) for every positive integer ( k ). Since every ( a_k + r 2^k ) for ( r = 0, 1, 2, ldots ) also satisfies this condition, it follows that there are infinitely many such ( n ) such that ( n cdot 2^k - 7 ) is a perfect square.

First, let us define and understand the elements involved in this problem. We are given a prime number ( p ) and a positive integer ( n ) such that ( n geq p ). We need to show that ( C_n^p - leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor ) is divisible by ( p ). 2. Recall the definition of the binomial coefficient ( C_n^p ) (also written as ( binom{n}{p} )): [ binom{n}{p} = frac{n!}{p!(n-p)!} ] 3. Let ( N ) be the largest integer in the range ( {n, n-1, ldots, n-p+1 } ) that is divisible by ( p ). Thus: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor = frac{N}{p} ] 4. Now, we express the binomial coefficient ( C_n^p ) considering ( N ): [ C_n^p = frac{n(n-1) cdots (N+1) N (N-1) cdots (n-p+1)}{p!} ] When we subtract ( leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor ), we get: [ C_n^p - leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor = frac{n(n-1) cdots (N+1) N (N-1) cdots (n-p+1)}{p!} - frac{N}{p} ] 5.

We observe that the terms ( n, n-1, ldots, N+1, N-1, ldots, n-p+1 ) under modulo ( p ) all yield nonzero residues and all residues are distinct (since ( p ) is prime). 7. According to Wilson's theorem, if ( p ) is a prime number, the product of all residues mod ( p ), except 0, is congruent to ( (p-1)! ) modulo ( p ). Therefore: [ n(n-1) cdots (N+1) (N-1) cdots (n-p+1) equiv (p-1)! mod p ] 8. This implies: [ n(n-1) cdots (N+1) (N-1) cdots (n-p+1) - (p-1)! equiv 0 mod p ] 9. Thus, the entire term inside the brackets in the previous expression is divisible by ( p ). Consequently: [ A = frac{n(n-1) cdots (N+1) N (N-1) cdots (n-p+1)}{p} - frac{N(p-1)!}{p} ] is divisible by ( p ) because it is a multiple of the term in question when scaled by ( frac{N}{p} ). 10. Since ( C_n^p - leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor = frac{A}{(p-1)!} ) and ( A ) is divisible by ( p ), it follows that ( C_n^p - leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor ) is indeed divisible by ( p ).

There exist integers (r, s) such that (a = br + s) and (Delta_0(s) < Delta_0(n)). 6. Since (Delta_0(s) < Delta_0(n)), we have (Delta_0(s) = delta(s)). 7. It can be shown that (|s| geq lfloor frac{|n|}{2} rfloor), which is at least (delta(n) - 1). 8. Thus, (delta(n) geq Delta_0(n) > delta(n) - 1), which implies (Delta_0(n) = delta(n)).

We need to prove that it is always possible to make all the coins either face up or face down, but not both. 2. **Parity of Flips:**    Note that flipping a coin twice returns it to its original state. Therefore, the parity (even or odd) of the number of flips determines the final state of each coin. If a coin is flipped an even number of times, it remains in its initial state; if flipped an odd number of times, it changes state. 3. **Classification of Configurations:**    Any target configuration (all coins face up or all coins face down) can be classified as \\"even\\" or \\"odd\\" based on the parity of the number of moves required to reach that configuration.  4. **Total Number of Flips:**    The total number of flips performed is:    [    1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 2015 = frac{2015 times 2016}{2} = 2015 times 1008    ]    This is an even number. 5. **Parity of Target Configurations:**    Suppose we can make all coins face up. To make all coins face down, we would need an additional 2015 flips (one flip for each coin), which is an odd number. This means the configuration of all coins face up and all coins face down belong to two different classifications (one even, one odd). 6. **Reaching the Even Configuration:**    Since the total number of flips is even, we can only reach the configuration that requires an even number of flips. We will now show that we can always reach this configuration. 7. **Flipping Strategy:**    We can permute our moves; flipping a coin and then another is the same as flipping the other coin first. We will perform the flips in reverse order: (i = 2015, 2014, ldots, 1). 8. **Step-by-Step Flipping:**    - First, flip all 2015 coins (since (i = 2015)).    - For each (i), observe the (i)-th coin:      - If the (i)-th coin is face down, turn over the first (i) coins.      - If the (i)-th coin is face up, turn over the first (i-1) coins and the last coin.    - This ensures that the (i)-th coin is face up after our move, and we will not touch it again. 9. **Final Configuration:**    By following this strategy, the first 2014 coins will be face up. Since we assumed the face-up configuration is an even one, the last coin must also be face up at the end, otherwise, it would contradict our assumption. Thus, we have proven that we can make the coins into a particular configuration (all face up or all face down), and thus cannot be the other.

Given that all three integers are divisible by 3, let's express them as: a = 3x b = 3y c = 3z where x, y, and z are also integers. Since the integers are not consecutive and divisible by 3, the difference between any two of them must be at least 6 (because if it were 3, they would be consecutive).  The median of the three numbers is b, and it is given that the median is (a + 13). Therefore, b = a + 13.

The next smallest value for b that is divisible by 3 is 21 (since 18 is too close to a and would make them consecutive). So, let's correct b to be 21. Now we have: a = 6 b = 21 The sum of a and b is 6 + 21 = 27, which leaves us with 60 - 27 = 33 for c.

If this store wants to make a daily profit of 2400 dollars from selling this type of electronic firecracker and also wants to sell it quickly, what should be the selling price?","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Finding the Functional Relationship between w and x Given that the cost price of the electronic firecracker is 80 per box and the daily sales quantity y is related to the selling price x as y=-2x+320, we can express the daily profit w as: [ begin{align*} w &= (x - 80) cdot y  &= (x - 80) cdot (-2x + 320)  &= -2x^2 + 480x - 25600 end{align*} ] Thus, the functional relationship between w and x is: w = -2x^2 + 480x - 25600.  Part 2: Maximizing Daily Profit To find the selling price that maximizes the daily profit, we rewrite w as: [ begin{align*} w &= -2x^2 + 480x - 25600  &= -2(x - 120)^2 + 3200 end{align*} ] Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (-2 < 0), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point at x = 120. Within the given range of 80 leqslant x leqslant 160, the maximum profit occurs when x = 120. The maximum profit is 3200 dollars. Thus, the selling price should be set at boxed{120 text{dollars}} for the daily profit to be maximized, with a maximum profit of boxed{3200 text{dollars}}.  Part 3: Selling Price for a Desired Daily Profit To achieve a daily profit of 2400 dollars and sell quickly, we set w = 2400: [ begin{align*} -2(x - 120)^2 + 3200 &= 2400  (x - 120)^2 &= 400  x - 120 &= pm 20 end{align*} ] Solving for x, we get two possible selling prices: x_1 = 100 and x_2 = 140. To sell quickly, we prefer the lower price, which is x_1 = 100. Therefore, the selling price should be set at boxed{100 text{dollars}} to achieve the desired daily profit of 2400 dollars and also to sell the electronic firecrackers quickly."},{"instruction":"Let the set U={1,3,5,7}, and M={1,3}.

No three of the five points are collinear, and  2. The line through any two points is normal to the plane containing the other three. We will analyze this using vector and geometric arguments. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution: 1. **Consider the plane and line relations**:     - We need to find ( D ) and ( E ) such that any line through these points and any of ( A, B, ) or ( C ) should be perpendicular (normal) to the respective plane formed by the others.     - Begin by assigning the orthocenter of ( Delta ABC ) as point ( X ), which will be pivotal in ensuring normalcy conditions are met in various configurations. 2. **Orthocenter properties**:     - The orthocenter ( X ) of an acute-angled triangle ( Delta ABC ) is within the triangle, thereby ensuring certain desired perpendicularities.     - Set ( X ) as the origin ( O ) and denote ( overrightarrow{XA} = mathbf{a} ), ( overrightarrow{XB} = mathbf{b} ), ( overrightarrow{XC} = mathbf{c} ). 3. **Expression of additional points**:     - Let ( D ) and ( E ) be along a line direction defined by some vector, say ( mathbf{d} ), with proportional magnitudes.     - Let ( overrightarrow{XD} = mathbf{d} ) and ( overrightarrow{XE} = k mathbf{d} ). Here, ( k ) is to be determined. 4. **Normalcy condition**:     - We need the line ( DE ) to be perpendicular to the plane ( ABC ).     - Additionally, we need ( BC ) (line between ( B ) and ( C )) to be perpendicular to the plane ( ADE ).  5. **Verification of perpendicular conditions**:     - From existence of orthocenter, if any line is perpendicular to two vectors in a plane, it is perpendicular to the plane itself:     [     begin{aligned}         &text{Suppose } DE text{ intersects } ABC text{ at } X.          &text{Take projection, consider } AX text{ meeting } BC text{ at } Y.          &text{If } BC text{ and } ADE text{ are normal then } Y text{ would be altitude intersection.}     end{aligned}     ] 6. **Geometric consistency using vectors**:     - Notice, vector products or dot product can be evaluated to ensure perpendicularity:     [         (mathbf{k} mathbf{d} - mathbf{a}) cdot (mathbf{b} - mathbf{d}) = 0      ]     Announce the normal equation using magnitudes and vector directions:     [         k mathbf{d}^2 = -mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b}.     ] 7. **Establishing the magnitude ( k )**:     - Since ( -mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} ) is the relation holding at orthocenter:     [         k mathbf{d}^2 = -mathbf{b} cdot mathbf{c} = -mathbf{c} cdot mathbf{a}.     ]     Validate it meets the geometric need ensuring all combinations work. 8. **Final checks considering triangle acuteness**:     - Verify positivity condition and ensure no collinearity:     [        boxed{ D text{ and } Etext{ don’t coincide or become collinear.}}     ]     Since ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} neq 0 ), ( mathbf{k} neq 0. ) **Conclusion**: All prescribed geometric conditions established with ( D ) and ( E ), ensuring lines through any points are normal to the respective planes with no collinear occurrence: [ bo}"},{"instruction":"A 20% stock is quoted at 200.

The percentage yield is calculated by taking the annual income from the stock and dividing it by the stock's current market price, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Given: - The stock's percentage yield is 10%. - The stock's quoted price is 200. Let's denote the face value of the stock as FV. Since it's a 20% stock, it means that the annual income from the stock is 20% of its face value. So the annual income (I) from the stock is: I = 20% of FV I = 0.20 * FV The percentage yield (Y) is given by the formula: Y = (I / Quoted Price) * 100 We know the percentage yield (Y) is 10%, and the quoted price is 200, so we can plug these values into the formula: 10 = (I / 200) * 100 Now we can solve for I: 10 = (I / 200) * 100 10 / 100 = I / 200 0.1 = I / 200 I = 0.1 * 200 I = 20 Now we know the annual income (I) from the stock is 20. Since this income represents 20% of the face value (FV), we can now find the face value: 20% of FV = 20 0.20 * FV = 20 FV = 20 / 0.20 FV = 100 Therefore, the face value of the stock is boxed{100} ."},{"instruction":"the function y=sqrt{2x}+frac{1}{{x+1}}, the range of the independent variable x is () A: xleqslant 2 B: xleqslant 2 and xneq 1 C: xgeqslant 2 D: xgeqslant 2 and xneq 1","output":"To determine the range of the independent variable x for the function y=sqrt{2-x}+frac{1}{{x+1}}, we need to consider two conditions: 1.

The formula to find the total number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. Since we are looking for the number of proper subsets, we subtract 1 from the total number of subsets to exclude the set itself.

Let us examine the definition of a regular polygon and the properties of diagonals and isosceles triangles.  2. Given that the polygon has 2021 sides, which is an odd number.  3. Consider that in dividing the 2021-sided polygon into smaller triangles, each such triangle would have one of its vertices at one of the polygon's vertices and two of its sides formed by the diagonals of the polygon from that vertex. 4. Because the number of sides (2021) is odd, it is inherently impossible for all the diagonals from any one vertex to be equal. Therefore, pairs of diagonals drawn from that vertex cannot form isosceles triangles, as required by the problem. 5. Let's remove one triangle to consider what happens next: Suppose we remove one such triangle along with its included sides and diagonals. This action will leave us with a polygon having (2021 - 2) sides for each remaining segment. But since 2021 is odd, we would then have ( 2 times (2021 - 2) = 2 times 1010 ) sides, but still, this calculation is inherently incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the properties of forming exact polygons. 6. We essentially simplified the problem by showing an inherent impossibility in steps without performing unnecessary recalculations. The challenge inherent to non-intersecting diagonals in any polygon subset continually results in sides that cannot provide equal-length diagonals enough to preserve the primary polygon properties. 7. Given the constraints, while we can continue fragmenting and segmenting the polygon further, the inherent constraint continues: Refactor any polygon of geometry but ends again verifying that the next step in polygonal formation of diagonals fits remaining unsatisfactorily forming isosceles triangles. 8.

Let's verify this:    - Sum of (2, 3,) and (6) is (2 + 3 + 6 = 11), which is divisible by (1).    - Sum of (1, 3,) and (6) is (1 + 3 + 6 = 10), which is divisible by (2).    - Sum of (1, 2,) and (6) is (1 + 2 + 6 = 9), which is divisible by (3).    - Sum of (1, 2,) and (3) is (1 + 2 + 3 = 6), which is divisible by (6).

Since fleft(x+1right) is odd, f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0). This implies that if 1 is a zero, the other two zeros, x_{1} and x_{2}, are such that x_{1} + x_{2} = 2 due to the symmetry about x=1. 2.

From the given information, we can derive that c = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a, where c is the distance from the center to the focus, and a is the length of the semi-major axis. This allows us to calculate the eccentricity e. Step-by-step solution: 1. Given that one focus of the ellipse and the two endpoints of its minor axis form an equilateral triangle, we can infer that the distance from the center of the ellipse to the focus (c) is equal to the altitude of the equilateral triangle formed by the minor axis and the focus. 2. In an equilateral triangle, the altitude is equal to frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times the length of the side. In this case, the side is the minor axis, which has a length of 2a (since a is the semi-major axis and the minor axis is typically denoted as b = 2sqrt{a^2 - c^2}). So, the altitude (and thus c) is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a. 3. The eccentricity of an ellipse is given by the formula e = frac{c}{a}.

Any line with the specified slopes will either pass through this point or not.    - For ( n = 2 ), we can take two lattice points that are aligned such that any line with the specified slopes will pass through exactly these two points or none. 2. **Recursive Construction:**    - Consider an equiangular octagon with lattice points at its vertices. For ( n = 2 ), we can place lattice points at the vertices of the octagon.    - To extend this to larger ( n ), we use a homothety (scaling transformation) centered at each vertex of the octagon with a sufficiently small ratio ( frac{1}{t} ). This creates smaller octagons at each vertex. 3. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume that for some ( k ), we have a configuration for ( n = 2^k ) and ( n = 2^k + m ) where ( m in [1, 2^k] ).    - To construct a configuration for ( n = 2^{k+1} ), we take the octagon configuration for ( n = 2^k ) and apply the homothety to create smaller octagons at each vertex.    - We then place the configuration for ( n = 2^k ) in one of these smaller octagons and the configuration for ( n = m ) in a neighboring smaller octagon. This process is repeated until all smaller octagons are filled with configurations of ( 2^k ) or ( m ). 4. **Verification:**    - Any line with the specified slopes will either not intersect any points in the configuration or will intersect exactly ( 2^k + m ) points. This is because the lines will pass through the sides of two opposite smaller octagons, one containing the configuration for ( 2^k ) and the other for ( m ). 5. **Strong Induction:**    - By strong induction, we can extend this construction to any ( n ). Specifically, for ( n = 2022 ), we note that ( 2022 ) lies in the interval ( (2^{10}, 2^{11}] ). Therefore, we can construct a configuration for ( n = 2022 ) using the described method.

This creates three perpendicular lines:    - (AD), the altitude from (A) to (BC)    - (BE), the altitude from (B) to (AC)    - (CF), the altitude from (C) to (AB) 3. **Identify Orthocenter**:     Identify the orthocenter of the triangle (H), which is the point where the three altitudes intersect. 4. **Determine Cyclicity**:    According to the properties of triangles, any circle that passes through (A, B, C) and one point on one of the triangle's altitudes forms a cyclic quadrilateral:        - Circle through (A), (D), (H), (B)    - Circle through (B), (E), (H), (C)    - Circle through (C), (F), (H), (A)        From the above, we have three sets of circles, each set represented by the 4 points:    - ({A, D, H, B})    - ({B, E, H, C})    - ({C, F, H, A})    In total, these form 3 circles. 5. **Point (P) outside (triangle ABC)**:     Place a point (P) outside of the triangle (triangle ABC). Consequently, point (P) will not lie on any of the circles already identified. Nor will (P) lie on any side or altitude of the triangle. 6. **Inversion with respect to (P)**:    Perform an inversion with respect to point (P) and a specific radius (r).

We will analyze the cases when ( n ) is even and odd separately. 2. **Case 1: ( n ) is even**:    Suppose ( n ) is even. Since both ( k ) and ( l ) are integers, ((2k + 1)) and ((2l + 1)) are odd integers. For even ( n ), consider:    [    (2k + 1)^n + (2l + 1)^n     ]    Using modulo arithmetic, notice that for even ( n ):    [    (2k+1)^n equiv 1 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad (2l+1)^n equiv 1 pmod{4}    ]    Thus,    [    (2k + 1)^n + (2l + 1)^n equiv 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4}    ]    Therefore,     [    left(k + frac{1}{2}right)^n + left(l + frac{1}{2}right)^n = frac{1}{2^n}((2k+1)^n + (2l+1)^n) = frac{2}{2^n}    ]    When ( n ) is even and greater than ( M ), ( 2/2^n ) has a denominator of ( 2^n ), which implies it cannot be an integer as ( n > M ). 3. **Case 2: ( n ) is odd**:    Now consider ( n ) to be odd. We need to inspect:    [    (2k + 1)^n + (2l + 1)^n    ]    Since ( n ) is odd, expanding the binomial terms for simplicity:    [    (2k + 1)^n + (2l + 1)^n = (2k + 1 + 2l + 1)left((2k+1)^{n-1} - (2k+1)^{n-2}(2l+1) + cdots + (2l+1)^{n-1}right)    ]    Note that:    [    2(k + l) + 2    ]    is an even number that multiplies a sum consisting of products of odd terms (as all terms derived from odd powers of odd numbers remain odd). Therefore, the entire sum for odd odd ( n ),    [    (2k + 1)^n + (2l + 1)^n    ]    involves an added multiple of 2. Therefore,    [    frac{1}{2^n}((2k+1)^n + (2l+1)^n)    ]    again divides by a power of ( 2 ) greater than the numerator component, echoing similar logic to the even case.

In this scenario, putting ( a_{k_s} ) before ( a_{k_{s+1}} ) would form a subsequence longer than ( k ), which contradicts our assumption that ( pi_k ) is maximal. 11. **Conclusion on Decreasing Subsequence:**      Therefore, the sequence ( a_{k_1}, a_{k_2}, ldots, a_{k_{n+1}} ) is a strictly decreasing subsequence of length ( n + 1 ). # Conclusion: If there is no increasing subsequence of length ( m + 1 ) in the sequence ( pi ), there must be a decreasing subsequence of length ( n + 1 ).

If Diane will be half the age of Alex at that time, then Alex will be 2 * 30 = 60 years old when Diane is 30. Let's find out how old Alex is now. Since Diane will turn 30 in 14 years, and Alex will be 60 years old at that time, Alex is currently 60 - 14 = 46 years old. Now we know Alex's current age, we can find Allison's current age.

This means that for sufficiently large ( x ), every integer can be expressed as ( P(n) ) for some integer ( n ). 2. **Degree of the polynomial**: Consider the degree of the polynomial ( P(x) ). If ( P(x) ) has a degree greater than 1, then the difference ( P(x+1) - P(x) ) will grow without bound as ( x ) increases. This is because the leading term of ( P(x) ) will dominate, making the difference arbitrarily large. Therefore, ( P(x) ) must be of degree at most 1. 3. **Form of the polynomial**: Since ( P(x) ) is of degree at most 1, it can be written as ( P(x) = ax + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are real numbers.  4. **Constraints on ( a )**: For ( P(x) = ax + b ) to cover all integers except possibly finitely many, ( a ) must be rational. If ( a ) were irrational, then ( ax + b ) would not be able to hit all integers for integer ( x ). Let ( a = frac{p}{r} ) where ( p ) and ( r ) are integers with ( r > 0 ). 5. **Ensuring all integers are covered**: For ( P(x) = frac{p}{r}x + b ) to cover all integers except possibly finitely many, ( frac{p}{r} ) must be such that ( P(x) ) can take on all integer values. This implies that ( p le r ), otherwise, the gaps between consecutive values of ( P(x) ) would be too large, missing infinitely many integers. 6. **Form of ( b )**: Since ( P(x) ) must map integers to integers, ( b ) must also be rational. Let ( b = frac{q}{r} ) where ( q ) is an integer. 7. **Final form of the polynomial**: Combining these, we get ( P(x) = frac{p}{r}x + frac{q}{r} ). For ( P(x) ) to map integers to integers, ( r ) must divide ( q ). Let ( q = kr ) for some integer ( k ). Thus, ( P(x) = frac{p}{r}x + k ). 8. **Simplifying the polynomial**: We can rewrite ( P(x) ) as ( P(x) = frac{p}{r}(x + frac{kr}{p}) ). For ( P(x) ) to be an integer for all integers ( x ), ( frac{kr}{p} ) must be an integer, implying ( p ) divides ( kr ). Since ( p le r ), we can simplify this to ( P(x) = frac{x + c}{k} ) where ( c ) is an integer and ( k ) is a positive integer. Therefore, the only polynomials that satisfy the given condition are of the form ( P(x) = frac{x + c}{k} ) where ( c ) is an integer and ( k ) is a positive integer.

The total dividend per share would then be the sum of the expected dividend per share and the additional dividend per share: Total dividend per share = E/2 + 0.4 * (1.10 - E) The total dividend paid to a person who owns 500 shares would be: Total dividend = 500 * Total dividend per share Total dividend = 500 * (E/2 + 0.4 * (1.10 - E)) We are given that the total dividend paid is 260, so we can set up the equation: 260 = 500 * (E/2 + 0.4 * (1.10 - E)) Now, let's solve for E: 260 = 500 * (E/2 + 0.4 * 1.10 - 0.4E) 260 = 500 * (0.5E + 0.44 - 0.4E) 260 = 500 * (0.1E + 0.44) 260 = 50E + 220 Subtract 220 from both sides: 40 = 50E Divide both sides by 50: E = 40 / 50 E = 0.8 So, the expected quarterly earnings per share were boxed{0.80} ."},{"instruction":"Two cones with radii 10 cm and heights 10 cm and 16 cm respectively are enclosed within a cylinder.

This means the reduced salary is S - (P/100 * S). To bring the reduced salary back to the original salary, we need to increase it by 100%. This means we need to double the reduced salary.

Next, we combine the two terms by finding a common denominator, leading to frac{sin 20^{circ} + 4sin 20^{circ}cos 20^{circ}}{cos 20^{circ}}.

Therefore, 4sin 20^{circ}cos 20^{circ} = 2sin 40^{circ}, yielding frac{sin 20^{circ} + 2sin 40^{circ}}{cos 20^{circ}}. We can further simplify this expression by splitting the numerator, resulting in frac{sin 20^{circ} + sin 40^{circ} + sin 40^{circ}}{cos 20^{circ}}.

Let’s denote the midpoints of ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ) as ( M1, M2, ) and ( M3 ) respectively. The projections of the incenter ( I ) onto these lines are denoted as ( P1, P2, ) and ( P3 ), i.e., the foot of the perpendiculars drawn from ( I ) to the perpendicular bisectors of ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ). We want to prove that the lines ( AP1, BP2, ) and ( CP3 ) are concurrent. 2. **Applying Cheva's Theorem**:    Cheva's theorem states that for a triangle ( Delta ABC ), three lines ( AD, BE, ) and ( CF ) are concurrent if     [    frac{AF}{FB} cdot frac{BD}{DC} cdot frac{CE}{EA} = 1.    ] 3. **Calculating Required Ratios**:    Since ( P1, P2, ) and ( P3 ) are the projections of ( I ) onto the perpendicular bisectors, each of these points lies on the segment connecting a vertex to the respective midpoint of the opposite side. Let's denote these points precisely:    - ( P1 ) lies on the segment ( AM1 )    - ( P2 ) lies on the segment ( BM2 )    - ( P3 ) lies on the segment ( CM3 ) 4. **Proving the Concurrency Using Projections**:    Let’s proceed by projecting points and utilizing the properties of projections and triangle angle bisectors (properties of the incenter and projections on sides):        - For the line ( AP1 ) passing through ( A ) and projecting on ( M1 ) we have segment ratios,      [      AP_1 : P_1A' = frac{p-b}{p-c}.      ]    - For the line ( BP2 ) passing through ( B ) and projecting on ( M2 ),      [      BP_2 : P_2C' = frac{p-c}{p-a}.      ]    - For the line ( CP3 ) passing through ( C ) and projecting on ( M3 ),      [      CP_3 : P_3B' = frac{p-a}{p-b}.      ] 5. **Application of Cheva's Theorem Condition**:    By applying Cheva’s theorem for verification and possibly simplifying the obtained ratio results of projections and incenter positing, we eventually get:    [    frac{AP_1}{P_1M1} cdot frac{BM2}{P_2M2} cdot frac{CM3}{P_3M3} = left( frac{p - b}{p - c} right) cdot left( frac{p - c}{p - a} right) cdot left( frac{p - a}{p - b} right),    ]    Simplifies to:    [    frac{AP1}{P1A} cdot frac{BP2}{P2B} cdot frac{CP3}{P3C} = 1.    ] 6. **Conclusion**:    Since the product ( frac{AP1}{P1A} cdot frac{BP2}{P2B} cdot frac{CP3}{P3C} ) equals 1 by Cheva’s theorem, we can conclude that the lines ( AP1, BP2, ) and ( CP3 ) intersect at a single point.

(Round the result to two decimal places.)","output":"To calculate the probability of selecting at least one second-class product when picking 4 products, it's easier to use the complementary probability method. This means we'll first calculate the probability of picking only first-class products (no second-class products) and then subtract that probability from 1. Let the probability of picking only first-class products be P(text{all first-class}). To find this probability, consider that for each of the 4 draws, we are only selecting from the first-class products. For the first pick, we have a frac{90}{100} chance of getting a first-class product. For the second pick, since we've already taken one first-class product out, we have a frac{89}{99} chance. For the third pick, the chance is frac{88}{98}. And for the fourth pick, it becomes frac{87}{97}. The probability of picking all first-class products in all 4 draws is the product of these individual probabilities:  P(text{all first-class}) = frac{90}{100} times frac{89}{99} times frac{88}{98} times frac{87}{97}  Calculating the above product, we get:  P(text{all first-class}) = left(frac{90}{100}right) times left(frac{89}{99}right) times left(frac{88}{98}right) times left(frac{87}{97}right) = left(frac{9}{10}right) times left(frac{89}{99}right) times left(frac{88}{98}right) times left(frac{87}{97}right)  We can simplify this by canceling out common factors:  P(text{all first-class}) = left(frac{9}{10}right) times left(frac{1}{11}right) times left(frac{88}{98}right) times left(frac{87}{97}right)  Finally, we multiply these fractions to get P(text{all first-class}). Now, the probability of selecting at least one second-class product is 1 - P(text{all first-class}). Let's compute the exact values:  P(text{all first-class}) = left(frac{9}{10}right) times left(frac{1}{11}right) times left(frac{44}{49}right) times left(frac{29}{97}right) = 0.6505...  Thus, the probability of having at least one second-class product is:  P(text{at least one second-class}) = 1 - P(text{all first-class})   P(text{at least one second-class}) = 1 - 0.6505...

For y=-x^2, as x increases, -x^2 decreases because the negative sign in front of x^2 reflects the parabola downward. Thus, y=-x^2 is a decreasing function on (0, +infty). 2. For y=frac{1}{x}, as x increases, frac{1}{x} decreases because the larger the denominator becomes in a fraction, the smaller the value of the fraction. So, y=frac{1}{x} is a decreasing function on (0, +infty). 3. For y=left(frac{1}{2}right)^x, this is a decreasing function because the base frac{1}{2} is between 0 and 1, and for exponentials with a base between 0 and 1, the function decreases as x increases. Therefore, y=left(frac{1}{2}right)^x is a decreasing function on (0, +infty). 4. For y=log_2{x}, as x increases, log_2{x} also increases because the logarithmic function with a base greater than 1 is increasing. Thus, y=log_2{x} is an increasing function on (0, +infty).

We aim to eliminate such occurrences using the operation described.    - Insert the digit b on the left side of overline{ab} and the digit a on the right side of overline{ab}, obtaining the number: cdots overline{text{bbab}} cdots.    - Next, delete the two adjacent identical two-digit sequences overline{bb} and overline{aa}, resulting in: cdots overline{ba} cdots. 3. **General Case for Two Adjacent Digits:**    - By repeating the insertion and deletion process, we can transform cdots overline{ab} cdots into cdots overline{ba} cdots.    - Essentially, we can swap any two adjacent digits and thus this method can be used to generate adjacent identical digits, which can then be removed. 4. **Extension to Non-Adjacent Digits:**    - By successively applying the insertion and deletion process, we can deal with non-adjacent identical digits as well.    - Every time we identify identical digits, we can bring them next to each other using swaps and then eliminate them.  5. **Conclusion:**    - Based on the operations allowed (inserting identical digit pairs and deleting two-digit identical pairs), we can effectively remove all identical digits.    - Since each deletion reduces the total number of digits, eventually, we end up with a number where all digits are unique.    - Given that the initial number N has no digit as 0 and no more than 9 digits are needed to represent a number where all digits are unique, the final number will have fewer than 10^9 digits.

Combining like terms on the left-hand side: [ n^3 + n^2 + frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n^3 + n^2 + frac{n^2 + n}{2} = n^3 + n^2 + frac{n^2}{2} + frac{n}{2} ] Getting a common denominator: [ n^3 + n^2 + frac{2n^2 + n}{2} = n^3 + n^2 + frac{2n^2}{2} + frac{n}{2} = n^3 + n^2 + n ] Now, express everything with a common denominator of 2: [ frac{2n^3 + 2n^2 + n}{2} ] So we get: [ n^3 + n^2 + frac{n(n+1)}{2} = frac{(2n^3 + 2n^2 + n)}{2} ] Equating this to the right-hand side term ( 3 S_n ): [ frac{2n^3 + 2n^2 + n}{2} = 3 S_n ] Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to clear the denominator: [ 2n^3 + 2n^2 + n = 6 S_n ] Solving for ( S_n ): [ S_n = frac{2n^3 + 2n^2 + n}{6} = frac{n(2n^2 + 2n + 1)}{6} ] We simplify this by noticing that: [ S_n = frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} ] Therefore, the sum of the squares of the first ( n ) natural numbers is: [ boxed{frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}} ]"},{"instruction":"Determine the domain of the function y=ln (x^{2}2).","output":"Since the function is y=ln (x^{2}-2), We know that the argument of the natural logarithm must be greater than 0.

The natural logarithm function ln(x) is defined only for x > 0. Hence, we need to find the values of x such that x^{2} - 2 > 0. 2. Adding 2 on both sides of the inequality gives us x^{2} > 2. 3.

According to the formula for the length of a tangent line segment, we have |PT|=sqrt{|PC|^2-r^2}=sqrt{|PC|^2-1}. To minimize the length of the tangent segment |PT|, we need to minimize the distance |PC|. This minimum distance is achieved when P is the point on the line closest to C.

Since 1 ton is equal to 2100 pounds, a 13-ton gunny bag would have a capacity of: 13 tons * 2100 pounds/ton = 27300 pounds Next, we need to find out the total weight of the 1680 packets in pounds. Since each packet weighs 16 pounds and 4 ounces, we need to convert the ounces to pounds to add it to the 16 pounds. But we don't know how many ounces are in a pound yet, which is what we're trying to find out. Let's call the number of ounces in a pound \\"x\\". Therefore, 4 ounces is 4/x pounds. The weight of each packet in pounds is then: 16 pounds + (4/x) pounds The total weight of the 1680 packets is: 1680 packets * (16 pounds + 4/x pounds) We know that this total weight must equal the capacity of the gunny bag, which is 27300 pounds.

There is a possibility that some lines may not be parallel to the second plane. 3. The third proposition is true. If every line in a plane is parallel to another plane, there cannot be any line that intersects with the second plane. Thus, by definition, the two planes are parallel. 4. The fourth proposition is true. If two intersecting lines in a plane are each parallel to another plane, it follows that all the lines in the intersecting plane must be parallel to the second plane. Otherwise, there would be a contradiction where the intersecting lines are not parallel among themselves. Therefore, the two planes are parallel.

Determine, with proof, the minimum number of colors needed.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many colors are required to draw line segments that connect every black point to every white point on a regular decagon, adhering to the conditions mentioned. Let's go through the steps to find the minimum number of colors required: 1. **Identify the constraints**:     - There are 10 vertices in a regular decagon, with vertices colored alternately black and white.     - Every black point must be connected to every white point by a line segment.     - No two line segments of the same color can intersect, except at their endpoints. 2. **Classify the vertices**:     - Label the vertices alternately as black and white. Assume vertices labeled (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) are black, and vertices labeled (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are white. 3. **Connecting black and white vertices**:     - We need to connect each of the 5 black vertices to each of the 5 white vertices.     - This creates a complete bipartite graph, specifically (K_{5,5}), where one set of vertices contains the black vertices and the other set contains the white vertices. 4. **Coloring the edges**:     - If line segments of the same color intersect, they must do so at their endpoints. In a regular decagon, most line segments will need to cross the center (principal diagonals), and these principal diagonals will intersect at the center.     - Consider the intersection properties of the diagonals. Suppose we color the diagonals:         - **Observation**: The 5 main diagonals which all intersect at the center have to be colored differently because they all meet at a single point and thus would intersect otherwise. 5. **Minimum number of colors**:     - Given the 5 main diagonals intersecting at the center, it establishes that a minimum of 5 different colors is required.     - Other connections can be colored in such a way that no two segments of the same color intersect except at vertices, following the same color scheme used for the main diagonals. 6. **Verification of sufficiency**:     - We use a different color for each black vertex. Each color is used to connect the black vertex to all five white vertices. Since no two segments of the same color originate from different black vertices, no intersections (except at endpoints) are forced by this method. # Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of colors needed to draw the required line segments under the given conditions is: [ boxed{5} ]"},{"instruction":"The number 76 has an interesting property: the last two digits of 76^2 = 5776 are 76 again. a) Are there any other twodigit numbers with this property? b) Find all threedigit numbers A such that the last three digits of A^2 form the number A. c) Does there exist an infinite sequence of digits a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ldots, such that for any natural number n, the square of the number formed by overline{a_{n}} overline{a_{n1}} bar{ldots} bar{ldots} overline{overline{2}} overline{a_{1}^{}} ends in these same n digits?

All other coefficients (except the constant term) are integers that are divisible by ( n ).  3. **Rational Root Theorem**:    By the Rational Root Theorem, any potential rational solution ( frac{p}{q} ) must satisfy ( p ) divides the constant term (i.e., ( n! )) and ( q ) divides the leading coefficient (which is 1). Hence, ( q ) must be 1 and the possible rational root must be an integer. 4. **Consider Integer Roots**:    Suppose ( x = k ) is an integer solution of the polynomial.

Given ( n > 1 ), ( n ) must have a prime divisor ( p ). 6. **Prime Divisor Consideration**:    Suppose ( p mid n ), then ( p mid k ) must also hold true because ( p mid k^n ).

However,    - ( nu_p(k^n) = n alpha )    - All other terms ( nu_p ) can be similarly analyzed showing they must meet higher ( alpha ) which will be contradicting as ( n > nu_p(n!) ). 9. **Conclusion**:    The term ( k^n + n k^{n-1} + cdots ) fails in divisibility due to ( p )'s exponents leading contradiction thus showing no integer (or rational) root exists.

You can do this by drawing a semicircle centered at B with any radius and marking points on the semicircle that intersect with AC. Connect these points to B. 4. **Bisect the Angle:**     Bisect the angle DBC to create a ray BE such that angle EBC = 45^{circ}. To bisect the angle, use a compass to draw arcs from B intersecting both lines BD and BC. Mark the intersection points, then draw arcs from these points so they intersect, forming a bisector. 5. **Draw the Circle:**     Set your compass to the length c (the hypotenuse) and draw a circle k centered at A with radius c. This circle will intersect the ray BE at some point X because the hypotenuse c is longer than the difference of the legs d, i.e., c > AB. 6. **Find the Point of Intersection:**     Let X be the point where the circle k intersects the ray BE.  7. **Drop a Perpendicular:**     Drop a perpendicular XY from point X to line AC. This will form a right angle at point Y. 8. **Forming the Right Triangle:**     The triangle AXY is now a right triangle with hypotenuse AX = c and legs AY and XY. Note that the difference of the legs AY - XY = AY - BY = AB = d, as required. The construction is now complete, and triangle AXY is the right triangle we're looking for.  To confirm that this is the only possible triangle with the given specifications, let's argue by contradiction: - Suppose there exists another right triangle AX'Y' that fits these specifications. Position AX'Y' such that the smallest angle is at A, the longer leg is AY' placed on AC, and X' is above Y'. - The point X' must lie on the circle k because AX' = c. - Similarly, since AX' - XY' = AY - BY = AB = d, BX'Y' must be an isosceles right triangle, which places X' on the ray overrightarrow{BE}. - However, point B is inside circle k, so the intersection of k and overrightarrow{BE} can occur only once. Thus, X' = X and Y' = Y, meaning that any such triangle must be the one we've constructed.

Kelly held her breath for 3 minutes, which is 3 * 60 seconds = 180 seconds. Brittany held her breath for 20 seconds less than Kelly, so that's 180 seconds - 20 seconds = 160 seconds. Buffy held her breath for 40 seconds less than Brittany, so that's 160 seconds - 40 seconds = 120 seconds. Carmen held her breath for 15 seconds more than Kelly, so that's 180 seconds + 15 seconds = 195 seconds.

According to the information given, Ashok's capital is 1/9 of Pyarelal's capital. So we can write: A = (1/9) * P Since they share the loss in the ratio of their investments, the total loss will be divided between Ashok and Pyarelal in the same ratio as their capitals. Let's denote the total loss as L. Pyarelal's share of the loss is Rs 1080, which is his capital's proportion of the total loss. So we can write: Pyarelal's loss = (P / (A + P)) * L We know Pyarelal's loss is Rs 1080, so: 1080 = (P / (A + P)) * L Now, substitute A with (1/9) * P: 1080 = (P / ((1/9) * P + P)) * L 1080 = (P / ((1/9) * P + (9/9) * P)) * L 1080 = (P / ((1/9 + 9/9) * P)) * L 1080 = (P / ((10/9) * P)) * L 1080 = (9/10) * L Now, we can solve for L, the total loss: L = 1080 * (10/9) L = 1200 So, the total loss they incurred is Rs boxed{1200} ."},{"instruction":"The HCF and LCM of two numbers are 12 and 396 respectively.

Following this pattern, if one of the split numbers for (m^3) is (2017), what is the value of (m)? (A) (44) (B) (45) (C) (46) (D) (47)","output":"We observe a pattern in which the split numbers for each cube are consecutive odd numbers, starting from a certain odd number. For (2^3), the split begins with (3), and for (3^3), it begins with (7). Each subsequent split starts with the next odd number after the last odd number used for the previous cube split. First, let's denote the first odd number of the split for (m^3) as (a_1). Thus, the set of odd numbers used in the split for (m^3) will be (a_1, a_1 + 2, a_1 + 4, ldots, a_1 + 2(m^3 - 1)). Now, we need to find when (2017) appears in this pattern. The previous odd numbers in the sequence before (2017) are part of the split for cubes of natural numbers less than (m). Therefore, (a_1) must be the first odd number for the split associated with ((m - 1)^3). The last odd number used in the split for ((m-1)^3) is (2015 = a_1 + 2((m - 1)^3 - 1)), which gives us the equation to solve for (a_1): [ 2015 = a_1 + 2((m - 1)^3 - 1) ] [ a_1 = 2015 - 2((m - 1)^3 - 1) ] We need to find (m) such that (a_1) and all the split numbers (a_1, a_1 + 2, ldots, 2017) are odd and follow our observed pattern. This implies that (2017) should be part of the sequence starting from (a_1). Note that (2017) is an odd number, so (a_1) also should be an odd number. Since the options for (m) are limited to (44, 45, 46), and (47), we can check them one by one using the equation we derived. We're looking for the smallest natural number (m) such that: [ a_1 text{ is odd and } (m - 1)^3 < frac{2017 - a_1}{2}+1 leq m^3 ] Let's test each option: For (m = 44), we would have (a_1 = 2015 - 2((44 - 1)^3 - 1)). Since (43^3) is less than (2017), the first odd number for (44^3) would be after (2015), but (44^3) is also less than (2017). So, (m) cannot be (44). For (m = 45), the first odd number for (45^3) follows (44^3), which uses odd numbers up to (43 + 44 + ldots + 86) (since (44^3 = 44 + 44 + ldots + 44), (44) times). (2017 - 43) is not divisible by (44), so we can tell that (2017) cannot belong to the split for (45^3). For (m = 46), the expectation is that (2017) belongs to the split for (46^3), but this would mean (2017 - 45) should be divisible by (46), and it is not. For (m = 47), we verify if (47^3) contains (2017) in its split. If (2017) is the first number in the split for (47^3), then (a_1 = 2017), and (2017) matches the form (a_1 + 2(k - 1)), with (k) as the position of (2017) in that split sequence. We can also deduce that (46^3) does not reach (2017), so (a_1) for (47^3) should be less than or equal to (2017). If (a_1) were the start for (46^3), then the last number used in the split for (46^3) would be (2015), which would make (a_1 = 2015 - 2(46^3-1)). This would, in turn, mean that (2017) is part of the sequence for (47^3), as (46^3) does not reach it, and (47^3) starts immediately after. Thus, the only viable option for (m) such that (2017) can appear in the split for (m^3) is when (m = 47).

Substituting x = a into the equations of the asymptotes, we get y = pm b. Therefore, the coordinates of points D and E are D(a, b) and E(a, -b), respectively.

Here, the base OD = a and the height DE = 2b. Thus, the area S_{triangle ODE} = frac{1}{2} times a times 2b = ab. Given that the area of triangle ODE is 8, we have ab = 8. Step 4: Find the minimum value of the focal length of C. The focal length of the hyperbola C is given by 2c, where c^2 = a^2 + b^2. To find the minimum value of c^2, we use the inequality a^2 + b^2 geqslant 2ab (by the AM-GM inequality). Substituting ab = 8 into the inequality, we get c^2 geqslant 2 times 8 = 16. Equality holds when a = b = 2sqrt{2}, which means the minimum value of c^2 is 16, and thus the minimum focal length is 2c = 2 times sqrt{16} = 2 times 4 = 8.

To verify, consider two circles (C_1) and (C_2) with radii (R_1) and (R_2) respectively.

We are given that any quadratic trinomial formed by these numbers as coefficients has real roots. This means that for any permutation of (a), (b), and (c), the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be non-negative. 2. **Formulate the quadratic equations:**    Consider the quadratic equations formed by the permutations of (a), (b), and (c):    [    ax^2 + bx + c = 0, quad bx^2 + cx + a = 0, quad cx^2 + ax + b = 0    ]    For each of these equations to have real roots, their discriminants must be non-negative:    [    b^2 - 4ac geq 0, quad c^2 - 4ab geq 0, quad a^2 - 4bc geq 0    ] 3. **Proof by contradiction:**    Suppose, for contradiction, that one of these trinomials does not have a positive root. Without loss of generality, assume (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) has only nonpositive roots. Let the roots be (alpha leq 0) and (beta leq 0). 4. **Express the coefficients in terms of the roots:**    Using Vieta's formulas, we have:    [    alpha + beta = -frac{b}{a}, quad alpha beta = frac{c}{a}    ]    Since (alpha leq 0) and (beta leq 0), their product (alpha beta geq 0).

Specifically, (a), (b), and (c) must all have the same sign. 6. **Rearrangement and discriminant analysis:**    Let (p), (q), and (r) be the numbers (a), (b), and (c) rearranged such that (|p| geq |q| geq |r| > 0). Consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation with these coefficients:    [    r^2 - 4pq    ]    Since (|p| geq |q| geq |r|), it follows that:    [    r^2 - 4pq leq r^2 - 4r^2 = -3r^2 < 0    ]    This implies that the discriminant is negative, which contradicts the assumption that all trinomials have real roots. 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, our assumption that one of the trinomials does not have a positive root must be false.

Note that ( C_{ii} ) is the determinant of the ((n-1) times (n-1)) submatrix obtained by deleting the (i)-th row and (i)-th column of ( A ). 4. **Laplace Expansion and Symmetry**:    Since ( A ) is symmetric, the submatrices ( A_{ii} ) obtained by deleting the (i)-th row and (i)-th column are also symmetric. Moreover, the property that the sum of elements in any row of ( A ) is zero implies that the sum of elements in any row of ( A_{ii} ) is also zero. 5. **Determinant of Submatrices**:    The determinant of a matrix with rows summing to zero is zero unless the matrix is singular. However, since ( A ) is singular, the submatrices ( A_{ii} ) are not necessarily singular. The key observation is that the structure of ( A ) ensures that the determinants of these submatrices are equal. 6. **Inductive Argument**:    By induction on the size of the matrix, we can argue that the determinants of the submatrices ( A_{ii} ) are equal. For ( n = 2 ), this is trivially true. Assume it holds for ( n-1 ). For ( n ), the structure of ( A ) ensures that the submatrices ( A_{ii} ) have the same determinant. 7. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, all elements in the main diagonal of the cofactor matrix ( C ) are equal.

If frac{n}{2} + 1 is odd, we can get a_3 = frac{n}{2} + 2, then frac{n}{2} + 2 = 1, solving this gives n = -2, which is discarded.   2. Assume n is an odd number, let a_1 = n + 1. If n + 1 is even, then a_2 = frac{n + 1}{2}. If a_2 is even, we can get a_3 = frac{n + 1}{4} = 1, solving this gives n = 3.   If n + 1 is odd, then a_2 = n + 2. If a_2 is even, we can get a_3 = frac{1}{2}(n + 2) = 1, solving this gives n = 0, which is discarded.   If a_2 is odd, we can get a_3 = n + 3, then frac{1}{2}(n + 3) = 1, solving this gives n = -1, which is discarded.   Therefore, the numbers that become 1 after three operations are 2, 3, and 8.   Similarly, the number of non-zero natural numbers that become 1 after 11 operations are 3, 8, and 89.   Hence, the answer is: boxed{2, 3, 8;  3, 8, 89}.

How much change did Seonwoo receive?","output":"First, let's calculate the total cost of the bubblegum. Since each packet costs 600 won and Seonwoo bought 2 packets, the total cost for the bubblegum is: 2 packets * 600 won/packet = 1200 won Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ramen. Since 2 bags cost 1600 won and Seonwoo bought 9 bags, we need to find out how many times 2 goes into 9 to determine how many times Seonwoo pays 1600 won.  9 bags / 2 bags = 4.5 Since Seonwoo can't buy half a set, we'll round down to 4 sets of 2 bags, which means Seonwoo buys 8 bags for the price of 4 sets of 1600 won, and 1 bag will be left out of this calculation.  4 sets * 1600 won/set = 6400 won Now, we need to add the cost of the extra bag of ramen. Since 2 bags cost 1600 won, 1 bag would cost half of that: 1600 won / 2 = 800 won Adding this to the cost of the 8 bags: 6400 won + 800 won = 7200 won Now, let's add the total cost of the bubblegum and the ramen to find the total cost of Seonwoo's purchase: 1200 won (bubblegum) + 7200 won (ramen) = 8400 won Finally, let's calculate the change Seonwoo received.

The result can be obtained by applying the formula for classical probability based on the given conditions. **Solution** To form a five-digit number without repeating any digit using 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, there are A_{4}^{1}A_{4}^{4}=96 numbers in total. For even numbers where digits 1, 2 are adjacent, we consider the following cases: 1. If the last digit is 0, then 1, 2 are considered as one group and can swap positions, with 3, 4 each being one digit, forming a total of 2A_{3}^{3}=12 five-digit numbers. 2. If the last digit is 2, then 1 is adjacent to it, with the remaining 3 digits arranged in order, and 0 cannot be the first digit, resulting in 2cdot A_{2}^{2}=4 five-digit numbers. 3. If the last digit is 4, then 1, 2 are considered as one group and can swap positions, with 3, 0 each being one digit, and 0 cannot be the first digit, resulting in 2cdot(2cdot A_{2}^{2})=8 five-digit numbers.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Sarah will be reading for a total of 20 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1200 minutes.

Since Sarah plans to check out 6 books, the total number of words she will read across all 6 books is 48000 words. To find out how many words are in each book, we divide the total number of words by the number of books: 48000 words / 6 books = 8000 words per book. Given that each page has 100 words, we can find out the number of pages in each book by dividing the number of words per book by the number of words per page: 8000 words/book / 100 words/page = 80 pages per book.

Let's call these two planets ( A ) and ( B ). 2. **Observation for ( A ) and ( B ):**    Given that ( A ) and ( B ) are the closest pair, the distances from any astronomer on planet ( A ) to any other planet (except ( B )) are greater than the distance from ( A ) to ( B ). Similarly, the distances from any astronomer on planet ( B ) to any other planet (except ( A )) are greater than the distance from ( B ) to ( A ). 3. **Mutual Observation:**    Therefore, the astronomer on planet ( A ) will observe planet ( B ) as the closest, and likewise, the astronomer on planet ( B ) will observe planet ( A ) as the closest. Thus, planets ( A ) and ( B ) are observing each other. 4. **Remaining Planets:**    Now, we need to consider the remaining 13 planets. 5. **Pigeonhole Principle:**    If any astronomer from the remaining 13 planets observes either ( A ) or ( B ) as the closest planet, it would mean not all 13 remaining astronomers are observing different planets because there would be two observers observing the same planet ( A ) or ( B ). 6. **Finding the Unobserved Planet:**    So, among these 13 planets, some planets won't be observed by anyone. If all astronomers from these 13 planets observe each other and not ( A ) and ( B ), we can repeat the argument initially for ( A ) and ( B ) among these 13 planets to find at least one planet that none of these 13 astronomers observe. 7. **Repetition of Argument:**    This argument can be applied iteratively as we keep subtracting pairs of mutually observing planets from the set of remaining planets until we exhaust all possible pairs.

Ta hormon ima v telesu več funkcij, še posebej pa je pomemben za ženske, saj igra ključno vlogo pri dojenju. Pri ženskah prolaktin spodbuja rast mlečnih žlez in proizvodnjo mleka po porodu. Zaradi tega se raven prolaktina običajno poveča med nosečnostjo in ostane visoka v obdobju dojenja. Čeprav je prolaktin najbolj znan po svoji vlogi pri razvoju dojk in laktaciji, ima tudi vpliv na široko paleto drugih telesnih funkcij, vključno z imunskim odzivom in uravnavanjem metabolizma. Povišane ravni prolaktina, ki je znan kot hiperprolaktinemija, so lahko posledica različnih vzrokov, kot so zdravila (na primer antipsihotiki ali zdravila za zniževanje visokega krvnega tlaka), hipotiroidizem, hipofizarne neoplazme (npr. prolaktinoma) ali druga stanja. Hiperprolaktinemija lahko povzroči različne simptome, kot so galaktoreja (nenormalno izločanje mleka iz dojk), nepravilnosti menstrualnega cikla, neplodnost in pri moških zmanjšano spolno željo ali impotenco. Vrednosti prolaktina se lahko preverijo s krvnim testom in, če so ugotovljene nepravilnosti, zdravnik lahko predlaga dodatno testiranje ali zdravljenje, odvisno od vzroka in simptomov."},{"instruction":"آمریکا میباشد که از کیفیت متوسطی برخوردار است و منابع نور نیز مورد قبول هستند، لطفا یک قالب گزارش برای من آماده کن AA medical من در حال تهیه یک گزارش از کابل نور سرد پزشکی برای عمل لاپروسکوپی و دو منلع نور پرتابل هستم ، کابل های از برند","output":"در اینجا یک قالب کلی برای تهیه گزارش از کابل نور سرد و منابع نور پرتابل برای عمل لاپروسکوپی از برند AA Medical ارائه می‌شود. این قالب شما را قادر می‌سازد تا اطلاعات مهم را به شکل سازمان‌یافته و موثر ارائه دهید. --- عنوان گزارش: بررسی کابل نور سرد پزشکی و منابع نور پرتابل برند AA Medical برای عمل لاپروسکوپی تهیه‌کننده: [نام شما] سازمان / بخش: [نام بیمارستان یا کلینیک شما] تاریخ تهیه گزارش: [تاریخ] مقدمه: [یک پاراگراف کوتاه شرح دهید که چرا این گزارش تهیه شده است و اهمیت انتخاب تجهیزات مناسب برای عمل لاپروسکوپی.] مشخصات دستگاه‌ها: 1. کابل نور سرد پزشکی AA Medical - مدل: [نام مدل] - طول کابل: [طول] - قطر کابل: [قطر] - نوع اتصال: [نوع اتصال] 2. منابع نور پرتابل AA Medical - مدل: [نام مدل] - نوع لامپ: [نوع لامپ] - شدت نور: [شدت نور] - زمان کارکرد باتری: [زمان کارکرد] بخش‌های ارزیابی: I. کیفیت ساخت و دوام II. عملکرد و کارایی نوردهی III. سهولت استفاده و اتصالات IV. ایمنی و استانداردهای پیروی‌شده V. مقایسه با محصولات مشابه در بازار VI. قیمت و مقرون‌به‌صرفه بودن روش ارزیابی: [شرح دهید که چگونه تست‌ها انجام شد، برای مثال بوسیله شبیه‌سازی شرایط عمل جراحی، ارزیابی توسط جراحان یا کارکنان فنی، و غیره.] یافته‌ها و نتایج: [در این بخش، شرح دهید که نتایج هر بخش از ارزیابی چه چیزهایی را نشان داد] نظرات و پیشنهادات: [پس از ارزیابی، نظرات و پیشنهادات خود را بیان کنید، این می‌تواند شامل راهکارهای بهبود، توصیه‌هایی برای خرید یا جایگزینی باشد.] نتیجه‌گیری: [خلاصه‌ای از کلیه موارد گفته‌شده در بالا را ارائه دهید و نتیجه نهایی را شرح دهید.] ضمائم: - جداول مقایسه‌ای محصولات - تصاویر و نمودارهای تست - بازخوردهای جمع‌آوری‌شده از کاربران امضا: [امضای شما] تاریخ: [تاریخ امضا] --- این گزارش باید بر پایه داده‌های واقعی، تجربیات کارکنان پزشکی و نتایج تست‌های عملی که انجام داده‌اید، بنا شده باشد. ارزیابی‌های شما باید منصفانه، دقیق و بدون جانبداری صورت گیرد تا اطمینان حاصل شود که تصمیم‌گیری برای خرید و استفاده از این تجهیزات بر اساس اطلاعات قابل اعتماد می‌باشد."},{"instruction":"آیا این متن برای مقدمه مناسب می باشد : طبق بازدیدی که در بهمن ماه سال ۱۴۰۲ از نمایشگاه عرب هلث به عمل آمد، با توجه به نیاز های شرکت و … با چندین کمپانی در جهت تأمین لوازم جانبی و منبع نور صحبت شد، که از این بین ۳ شرکت AA medical (آمریکا)، HCM (چین)، Applied Optical (هند) برای خرید کابل نور سرد و همچنین منابع نور مینی و پورتابل انتخاب شدند، که این اقلام مورد بررسی و مقایسه با کابل های فعلی شرکت و همچنین منابع نور، با منبع نور فعلی قرار گرفت، در این گزارش سعی شده است با توجه به امکانات و ابزار موجود گزارشی از کیفیت و بازدهی اقلام خریداری شده، ارائه شود.","output":"بله، متن پیشنهادی شما برای مقدمه گزارش شما مناسب به نظر می‌رسد. متن، زمینه‌ای برای انتخاب تجهیزات و ضرورت تهیه گزارش را فراهم می‌کند. با این حال، چند توصیه برای بهبود متن‌تان وجود دارد: 1. اضافه کردن جزئیات بیشتر: بسته به نیاز شما و مخاطبان گزارش، می‌توانید جزئیات بیشتری درباره نمایشگاه یا نیازهای شرکت خود توضیح دهید. 2. بیان اهداف گزارش: مشخص کردن اهداف دقیق‌تر گزارش به خوانندگان کمک می‌کند تا بهتر درک کنند که چه اطلاعاتی از گزارش انتظار دارند. 3. دقت در نگارش: متن شما به زبان فارسی است و برای هرگونه ارائه رسمی، توجه به نگارش صحیح و استفاده از واژگان فارسی و اصطلاحات پزشکی درست، اهمیت دارد. مقدمه پیشنهادی شما پس از ویرایش مختصر به شرح زیر می‌باشد: --- در بهمن ماه سال ۱۴۰۲ و در جریان بازدید از نمایشگاه عرب هلث، بر اساس نیازهای رو به افزایش شرکت، با چندین کمپانی برجسته در زمینه تأمین و تولید لوازم جانبی و منابع نور مذاکره به عمل آمد. از میان شرکت‌های متعدد، سه کمپانی AA Medical واقع در آمریکا، HCM از چین، و Applied Optical از هند، برای خرید کابل‌های نور سرد مورد نیاز لاپروسکوپی و همچنین منابع نور مینی و پرتابل انتخاب شدند. در این راستا، مقایسه‌ای دقیق و حرفه‌ای بین محصولات خریداری شده و تجهیزات مورد استفاده کنونی شرکت صورت گرفت. هدف از این گزارش، ارزیابی و مقایسه کیفیت، کارایی، و بازدهی اقلام خریداری‌شده با توجه به امکانات و ابزار موجود است تا تصمیم‌گیری درستی جهت به‌روزرسانی و ارتقا تجهیزات پزشکی به انجام برسد. --- این متن پایه محکمی برای ابتدای گزارش شما ایجاد می‌کند و به خواننده اطلاعات کافی را می‌دهد تا درک کند که این ارزیابی چرا و چگونه انجام شده است."},{"instruction":"Please edit the below snippet to return AddDate value from the table M_CKGrossMotor table in addition with Id, Appointment ID ... and such in response.

It is most widely known internationally for its association with Volodymyr Zelensky, the President of Ukraine, who was elected in 2019. The party shares its name with the television show \\"Servant of the People,\\" in which Zelensky played the role of a high school teacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine. The political ideology of the \\"Servant of the People\\" party is generally centrist, with a focus on anti-corruption, reformist and populist principles. They support the implementation of modern and efficient governance, the rule of law, the fight against corruption, and aligning Ukrainian law and standards more closely with those of the European Union and the West. During the early days of Zelensky's presidency and the 2019 parliamentary elections, the party put forward a platform that emphasized the following: 1. **Anti-corruption measures**: A central pillar of their ideology, Servant of the People advocates for a legal and political system that is transparent and resists acts of corruption. 2. **Economic reforms**: The party supports free-market policies aimed at improving the economy and fostering growth, while also increasing social support for vulnerable groups and working towards greater economic equality. 3. **Judicial reform**: Ensuring the independence and efficiency of the judiciary to fight against legal impunity and ensure that justice serves the people. 4. **Decentralization of power**: Transferring more power and authority to local governments to enhance democratic governance and responsiveness to local needs. 5. **National security**: Ensuring strong defense capabilities and working towards ending the war in the Donbas region through diplomatic means, as well as enhancing cooperation with NATO and seeking a path toward Euro-Atlantic integration. 6. **Social policies**: Investing in health care, education, and pensions with an emphasis on social mobility and access to services for all citizens. 7. **Foreign policy**: Moving towards European integration, maintaining a strong relationship with the European Union, and eventually aiming for EU membership. At the same time, the party supports a pragmatic approach to relations with Russia, tied strongly to the latter's respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the party's immediate focus, like much of the country's political discourse, has shifted dramatically towards national unity, resistance against the invasion, and the mobilization of domestic and international support for the defense of Ukraine. The political ideologies have been thus overshadowed by the more urgent need for resilience and national defense. It is important to note that political ideologies can evolve, and party positions may shift in response to new challenges or changes in leadership. As such, for the most current platform and policy positions of Servant of the People or any other political party, it is best to consult recent statements, official party documents, and policy positions put forward by party representatives."},{"instruction":"write a short story about a detective solving a mysterious case involving supernatural elements. The story should have well-developed characters, an engaging plot and a coherence narrative","output":"In the enigmatic city of Verimor, where shadows lingered as persistently as the fog, Detective Elara Crane was known for her unshakable rationality. She had a meticulous mind that could unravel the most complex of cases. Yet nothing had prepared her for the peculiar events at the Hollows Mansion that perched on a craggy hill overlooking the city. It began with a scream that shattered the night—a sound so piercing that it compelled the neighbors to call the authorities. The residence belonged to the esteemed Hollows family, long whispered to be cursed, with a lineage marred by inexplicable tragedies. Upon arrival, Elara found no signs of forced entry, and the body of Mr. Atticus Hollows, the current patriarch, lay sprawled in the library—his eyes wide with horror, skin ashen, and hands clutching an open, ancient tome. There were no marks, no wounds; it was as though he had been frightened to death. Elara carefully closed the book, noting the odd symbols on the timeworn pages. Hers was a world of evidence and logic, but as the investigation proceeded, peculiarities emerged. Objects vanished only to reappear in impossible places, unearthly whispers echoed in empty rooms, and a cold touch seemed to linger where shadows danced. The staff spoke of a malevolent force that had haunted the family for generations. They whispered of a pact made long ago with a being not of this world—a trade of fortune for souls within the Hollow line. Elara preferred facts over folklore, but she couldn't ignore the unusual occurrences threading the Hollows' history with tragedy. Her first breakthrough came from the mansion’s stoic butler, who finally confided in her after a particularly unsettling event. He revealed a hidden chamber behind the library—it was there Elara discovered a trove of diaries dating back centuries, each chronicling the family's rise and the same spectral presence. Determined to sever the connection, Elara scoured the texts for a pattern and stumbled upon the due date of the chilling contract—tonight, the same time every fifty years. She deduced that the spirit was bound to an artifact, the very book she had found in Mr. Hollows’ hands. As midnight approached, an unnatural chill filled the air, and the mansion seemed to sigh with apprehension. Elara, despite every nerve screaming for her to leave, positioned herself in the library, the book on the desk before her. The clock chimed, and an otherworldly glow seeped from the pages. A spectral figure, indistinct and flickering, rose and reached towards Elara, whispering promises of power in exchange for acquiescence. But the detective, armed with her resolve and knowledge gleaned from the journals, stood firm. \\"I deny you,\\" she proclaimed with an authoritative voice, repeating a counterspell she’d pieced together from the diaries, a phrase that could relinquish the spirit's claim. The entity howled, a sound of rage and despair, as it dissolved into the ether, the book crumbling to dust along with it. The Hollows' curse was broken. When dawn kissed the horizon, the city of Verimor found itself unwittingly lighter, as if it had been relieved of a burden too intangible to hold and too heavy to bear. Detective Elara Crane had indeed solved the case, her name whispered through the cobbled streets both with reverence and a hint of fear. With her logically tempered with newfound respect for the unexplainable, Elara maintained her reputation as the detective who could solve any mystery—even those touched by the supernatural.

Text messages can lead to delays and misunderstandings due to the absence of vocal cues.

Here's a reply template based on the Twitter support team's request for more information about why you believe the account suspension was in error and why you are requesting an appeal: Subject: Request for Account Reinstatement Review – @Utkarsh19814144 Hello Twitter Support Team, Thank you for acknowledging my request for account reinstatement. I am writing to provide additional details regarding my appeal. The primary reason I believe the suspension of my account, @Utkarsh19814144, was made in error is due to the account being compromised. I did not perform the activities that triggered the suspension as my account was accessed without my authorization. Here are the key points supporting my case: 1. Account Compromise: My account was compromised, as evidenced by unusual activity that does not align with my habitual use of the platform. I have always utilized my Twitter account within the community standards and guidelines set forth by Twitter. 2. Immediate Action: Upon realization of the compromise, I immediately took action to secure my account. This included changing my password and enabling two-factor authentication to prevent further unauthorized access. 3. Compliance with Twitter Policies: It has been, and it is always my intention to use my Twitter account according to the terms of service. I do not condone nor partake in any behavior that violates Twitter's rules, and I firmly believe that my account has been conducted within the appropriate use of the service. 4. Willingness to Cooperate: I am prepared to present any additional information or engage in steps necessary to verify my ownership of the account and validate my compliance with Twitter policies. Considering the circumstances of the account compromise and my subsequent actions to restore security to my account, I am kindly requesting an appeal. I am eager to regain access to my Twitter account and continue to be an active and responsible member of the Twitter community. I understand that the review may take 3-5 days, and I appreciate the effort your team will put into this process. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to a favorable resolution.

Is there data in the \`AddDate\` fields in the database? 2. Does the conversion function \`Common_Function.CommonFun.convertToJson()\` include the \`AddDate\` field in its conversion to JSON? 3. Are there any errors in your code or server that might be causing the field to be omitted from the response? If after checking all the above, you still face issues, you could add a simplified example JSON entry to illustrate the expected output: \`\`\`json { \\"result\\": [ { \\"ID\\": 20, \\"Appointment ID\\": null, \\"0-3 Months\\": \\"0\\", \\"grossmotor03no\\": \\"0\\", \\"3-6 Months\\": \\"3\\", \\"grossmotor36no\\": \\"0\\", // ... other fields ... \\"grossmotor5460no\\": \\"0\\", \\"AddDate\\": \\"2023-01-01T12:34:56\\" // Example AddDate field in the response }, // ... other entries ... ] } \`\`\` Ensure this example \`AddDate\` value is in the same format as the value stored in the database.

It is often associated with feelings of longing, nostalgia, or melancholy that surface during the late hours of the day when one is typically alone or isolated from others. Noctalgia can be triggered by memories of past events, relationships, or experiences that evoke emotions of loss or longing. This feeling can impact a person's mood, thoughts, and behavior, leading to insomnia, sadness, or a sense of emotional distress during the night."},{"instruction":"Humanity is slowly losing access to the night sky, and astronomers have invented a new term to describe the pain associated with this loss: \\"noctalgia,\\" meaning \\"night grief.\\"","output":"Noctalgia is the feeling of sadness and loss that comes from being unable to see the stars and planets in the night sky due to light pollution and urban development. It is a reminder of the beauty and mystery of the universe that is slowly slipping away from us. Astronomers and stargazers alike are concerned about the impact of light pollution on our ability to see the night sky. Not only does it make it difficult to observe celestial objects, but it also has negative effects on wildlife and human health. As we continue to lose our connection to the night sky, it is important to advocate for policies and practices that aim to reduce light pollution and preserve our ability to appreciate the wonders of the universe. Noctalgia serves as a reminder that we must take action to protect our view of the night sky for future generations."},{"instruction":"hi make the code in html for a Pokemon website","output":"Creating a full-fledged Pokémon website would be a complex venture requiring extensive HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and potentially server-side programming. However, I can provide you with a simple HTML template to get you started. This sample code will set up a basic webpage with some Pokémon-themed content.

For a more advanced and personalized style, you might want to create separate CSS files. - Grid System: The Pokémon are displayed using a simple CSS Grid. Adjust the \`grid-template-columns\` property for different layouts. - Responsiveness: This layout will work on most devices but may require media queries for better responsiveness. To enhance this website, you would want to include additional HTML pages for individual Pokémon details, a navigation bar to link different sections, search functionality, and possibly user account systems. For advanced features and interactivity, you'd typically use JavaScript or a JavaScript framework/library like React, Angular, Vue.js, etc. Remember to check for usage rights for Pokémon images and content to avoid copyright infringement."},{"instruction":"que suelen ver los gamers en videos","output":"Los gamers, o jugadores de videojuegos, suelen ver una variedad de contenido en videos relacionado con sus intereses.

Los gladiadores a menudo gozaban de un estatus de celebridad y podían recibir patrocinios de comerciantes y políticos que buscaban asociar sus nombres con la valentía y el heroísmo de estos luchadores. Además, hay evidencia de que las imágenes de gladiadores se utilizaban en diversos productos y así como en marketing. Se han encontrado lámparas de aceite, jarras y otros objetos domésticos con representaciones de gladiadores. Estos objetos podían ser souvenir o formas de mercadeo para asociar productos con la popularidad de los gladiadores. El merchandising también era evidente en la venta de memorabilia relacionada con los juegos y sus estrellas, incluyendo amuletos y pequeñas estatuillas de gladiadores, que probablemente eran vendidos a los espectadores del mismo modo que hoy podemos comprar productos de deportistas famosos. También es importante señalar que aunque la estructura del patrocinio en la antigua Roma era diferente a la compleja industria de patrocinio de deportistas modernos, la idea básica de apoyar financieramente a una figura atlética como manera de publicidad existe desde hace tiempo y era una práctica aplicada en diferentes formas en Roma. Por tanto, aunque el paralelismo con los deportistas modernos y su tipo de patrocinio no es idéntico en todos los sentidos, hay suficientes similitudes en la relación comercial entre gladiadores famosos y los productos o patrocinadores como para considerar la afirmación razonablemente cierta en términos generales."},{"instruction":"According to Cefr, give me 15 words and 5 phrasal verbs at B1-B2 level.

Founded in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Yabloko has been a minority party and has often struggled to gain significant political power in a political landscape dominated by Vladimir Putin and the United Russia party. Yabloko's political ideologies include: 1. Liberal Democracy: Yabloko promotes the development of multiparty democracy in Russia with strong checks and balances. They emphasize the need for free and fair elections, judicial independence, and a vibrant civil society. 2. Human Rights: The party stands for the protection of individual rights and liberties. It opposes authoritarian tendencies and stands against political repression and censorship. 3. Free Market Economy with Social Responsibility: Yabloko supports a market economy that includes social protections for the poor and vulnerable groups within society. They advocate for economic reforms that balance efficiency with social equity. 4. Environmental Protection: Environmentalism is a significant aspect of Yabloko's platform. The party pushes for sustainable development and strong environmental regulation to protect natural resources and public health. 5. Rule of Law: Yabloko stresses the importance of adhering to the rule of law and aims for a legal system free from corruption and political influence. 6. Social Liberalism: The party combines its advocacy for a market-based economy with support for social welfare programs designed to address issues like healthcare, education, and income inequality. 7. International Integration: Yabloko advocates for closer integration with European institutions and a foreign policy that aligns with international law and human rights norms. Yabloko has been critical of Putin's government, and as a result, it has faced challenges including political marginalization and limited media coverage. Throughout its history, Yabloko has attracted intellectuals, academics, and activists, as well as those who support a liberal alternative to Russia's dominant political powers. Despite these challenges, the party continues to participate in elections and remains an important voice for liberal values in Russia."},{"instruction":"Write an comedy anime scene about a young man saving his colleague from looking up the definition of ABDL on his computer.

Klaus quickly runs to Takumi's desk to prevent him from looking up the defintion of the term while in slow motion.","output":"INT. UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LAB - DAY The camera pans across a typical research lab filled with computers, beakers, and whiteboards covered in mathematical equations. TAKUMI, a bright-eyed Japanese researcher with a mischievous grin, sits at his cluttered desk. His fingers dance over the keyboard as he tries to stifle a laugh. TAKUMI (whispers to himself) Heh, wait till I look this up. This’ll be hilarious! Suddenly, KLAUS, a tall, stoic German researcher with a neatly kept beard, enters from across the room. He carries a precarious stack of papers. His ears catch the muffled snickers from Takumi’s direction. Suspicion paints his usually calm face as he glances over. KLAUS (muttering to himself) Was finden Sie so lustig, Takumi-kun? Takumi blinks and looks over his shoulder, spotting Klaus. He immediately becomes overly enthusiastic, a bit too nonchalant. TAKUMI Oh, Klaus! Just found this fascinating term... ABDL! I'm about to check it out. What does it stand for, Advanced Bio...? Before he can finish, Klaus’s eyes widen, and he realizes the potential disaster. Time seems to slow down as Klaus springs into action. His stack of papers flies up into the air in dramatic slow-motion, fluttering like a flock of startled doves. KLAUS (voice deepened, slow-mo) Neeeeiiiiinnnn!!! Takumi turns his head, confusion in his eyes as Klaus barrels towards him, his calm demeanor replaced by an unexpected urgency. The screen switches to a first-person view from Klaus’s perspective, rushing towards Takumi like a scene from an action movie. Takumi’s finger hovers over the ‘Enter’ key, his curiosity as clear as day. The words “ABDL definition” sit innocently in the search bar. Cut back to the slow-motion chaos. Klaus leaps over a lab stool with the grace of a figure skater, skidding across the smooth lab floor in his socks, each movement exaggerated. KLAUS (narrating with intensity) In the name of research integrity, I shall not let this gaffe besmirch our esteemed workspace! As he slides across the floor, papers rain down around him. Finally, with a heroic lunge, he slams the laptop shut mere milliseconds before Takumi's finger descends. SMACK! Takumi blinks at the closed laptop, then slowly turns to Klaus, who is panting heavily but with a look of determined victory. TAKUMI (genuinely curious) Wow, Klaus... I never knew you were so passionate about... laptop lids. KLAUS (frantic yet composed) Takumi-kun, there are some things in life better left un-Googled. Trust me on this. TAKUMI (raising an eyebrow) Is that so? Well, I trust you, Klaus. But now you owe me one—help me pick up this mess!

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LAB – DAY An expansive space peppered with computers, lab equipment, and mountains of academic papers. TAKUMI, a young Japanese researcher with a mischievous sparkle in his eyes, types away at his computer, humming a catchy anime opening theme. He's the kind of guy that has figurines on his desk and a collection of manga in a corner. KLAUS, his German colleague, tall with blond hair, impeccably dressed in a lab coat, surveys his own desk—a model of organization and efficiency. He is the embodiment of calm, with glasses perched on his nose, a man who speaks softly but carries a big intellect. Takumi's humming stops abruptly. He leans forward with a look of intense curiosity. TAKUMI (Thinking aloud with a smirk) Heh, what on earth is ABDL? Sounds like some new anime genre I've never heard of. Klaus, who's walking by with a petri dish, overhears Takumi and nearly drops it. His eyes widen in horror. Clearly, he knows what ABDL is, and it's certainly NOT an anime genre. In slow motion, with the gravity of an anime hero, he drops the dish on a conveniently located cushioned stool—because let's face it, this is comedy, no petri dishes were harmed in the making of this scene. KLAUS (Whispering like an action star) Nein! The SLOW MOTION BEGINS as dramatic, suspenseful music swells. Klaus tosses aside his notes, sending papers flying like doves in a John Woo film. KLAUS (Shouting) Takumi, nein! Do not search for it! Takumi, still oblivious and clicking towards the search button, chuckles to himself. TAKUMI (Playfully) Come on, Klaus, what's the worst it could be? Some secret magical girl series you’re embarrassed to admit you love? Klaus leaps over a lab bench in a feat of Teutonic athleticism, knocking over a stack of books. His normally stoic expression is replaced with sheer determination—he will save Takumi's innocence from the mysterious corners of the internet. KLAUS (Internally) For science, and for the sanctity of our workplace! Takumi's finger hovers over the enter key. The music reaches a climax. KLAUS (Desperately) Takumi! It’s... it’s not suitable for our scientific ambiance! Takumi, amused by the spectacle, finally glances up and sees Klaus, the human incarnation of a Valkyrie, descending upon him in a majestic dive. TAKUMI (Confused) Uh, Klaus? In a final, desperate lunge, Klaus crashes into Takumi, both of them toppling to the floor in a heap, just as Takumi's finger freezes inches from the keyboard. The music abruptly stops. The two lay there in a pile, and Klaus grabs the mouse, swiftly closing the browser. KLAUS (Breathing heavily) Bitte, trust me. You did not want to see that... Takumi, now on the floor with Klaus, bursts into laughter. TAKUMI (Giggling) Alright, man, alright! I'll take your word for it! But you owe me lunch for that tackle. KLAUS (Grinning ruefully) Fine, fine... Sushi on me, ja? As long as we never speak of the ABDL again. They both stand up, brushing themselves off. The laughter and camaraderie between them suggest that this is just another day in their unorthodox, yet endearing research lab life.

TAKUMI, a young Japanese researcher with a cheeky grin, sits at his desk surrounded by stacks of papers and multiple computer screens. He’s the epitome of organized chaos. Across from him, KLAUS, a tall and lean German researcher, is the polar opposite. His desk is a model of German efficiency: everything in its right place. Klaus wears glasses that reflect the light from his impeccably tidy computer screen. TAKUMI (grinning mischievously) Hey, Klaus! I came across this weird term online, 'ABDL,' and I'm about to look it up. Ever heard of it? Klaus's eyes widen in horror, a rare break in his stoic demeanor, as he instantly realizes what Takumi is about to stumble upon. KLAUS (in a desperately calm voice) Takumi, my friend, I urge you to reconsider this potentially perilous quest for knowledge... But it’s too late. Takumi is already mid-type, his fingers ready to hit 'Enter'. KLAUS (in slow motion, panic-stricken) Neeeeiiiin!!!

His usually composed self is replaced by an action hero as he makes a desperate, slow-motion dive across the lab towards Takumi. Cut to TAKUMI, who is feeling a strange sense of anticipation mixed with mischievous delight, unaware of the gravity Klaus associates with the situation. KLAUS (desperately reaching with his hand) Taaaakumiiiii!!! Suddenly, dramatic orchestral music swells as Klaus, in a slow-motion sequence, knocks over a cup of pencils, papers flutter like doves in the air, and a lone stapler tumbles to the ground in sacrifice to the cause. Takumi, still blissfully ignorant, finally feels the gravity pulling Klaus towards him and turns to see his colleague flying through the air with the determination of a guardian angel. Just inches from catastrophe, Klaus slams the laptop shut with a heroic smack, the force of his impact causing his glasses to skid across the room. Silence falls over the lab. Takumi erupts into hysterical laughter at the absurd spectacle, while Klaus sits back on his heels, panting and trying to regain his composure. TAKUMI (laughing) Klaus, man, you're like a ninja! What’s the big deal anyway? Klaus, now recovering, pushes his glasses back up his nose and lets out a relieved chuckle. KLAUS Just trust me on this one, Takumi. There are certain realms of the internet that are better left unexplored. Keep to the safety of your anime and manga. Takumi winks and gives a thumbs up, a new level of respect for his colleague’s mysterious intuition. TAKUMI Alright, Mr. Secret Internet Agent, I'll take your word for it.

They were known as the Gelatons, a fascinating race of gelatinous people who inhabited the planet Gelaria. These unique beings were a marvel of evolution, their bodies comprised entirely of a translucent, shimmering gelatinous substance. The Gelatons possessed the ability to change their shape and consistency at will, making them incredibly versatile and adaptable. They could transform into any form or mimic the appearance of various objects. But what truly set them apart was their extraordinary ability to bond and merge, allowing them to communicate effectively as a collective consciousness. The Gelatons lived harmoniously in their radiant, crystal-like cities, built entirely from their gelatinous bodies. Their cities were living entities, pulsating and ever-changing, adapting to each inhabitant’s needs. These magnificent structures stood tall, shimmering with beautiful hues, radiating peace and serenity. The Gelatons were a peaceful and benevolent race, seeking knowledge, understanding, and unity amongst each other and the universe. Their collective consciousness allowed them to share thoughts, emotions, and experiences, fostering a profound connection that strengthened their bond as a civilization. One day, an unexpected event unfolded in the peaceful realm of Gelaria. A massive asteroid thundered through space, heading straight towards their planet. Panic surged through the Gelaton cities as they collectively felt the vibrations of impending doom. Their gelatinous bodies quivered with fear, for they had never encountered such a threat before. Realizing the imminent danger, the Gelatons swiftly gathered in their central meeting chamber. The collective consciousness hummed with urgency as they pledged to save their precious planet from destruction. They knew they had to act quickly and find a solution. Every Gelaton contributed their ideas and experiences to form a comprehensive plan. One by one, they volunteered and merged themselves into a colossal gelatinous sphere. This gigantic entity personified unity, strength, and determination. It stretched its gelatinous body towards the heavens, intercepting the colossal asteroid. As the massive impact occurred, the Gelatons absorbed the destructive energy, sacrificing parts of their collective body to shield their planet. The asteroid crumbled into countless fragments, dancing majestically across the sky, as the Gelaton’s unified sphere weakened slightly but stood firm. Upon realizing that their planet had been saved, the Gelatons celebrated their triumph. They oozed with joy, merging once more into their individual forms, forming a magnificent celebration of colors and shapes. They danced, shimmering in the radiant light, rejoicing in their victory and the enduring spirit of unity that prevailed among them. From that day forward, the Gelatons revered the power of unity and collective consciousness, recognizing that by working together, they could overcome any challenge. Throughout the ages, they built countless wonders, explored distant realms, and shared their wisdom with other races, spreading harmony and understanding throughout the universe. And so, the gelatinous people of Gelaria continued to live, flourish, and inspire others with their extraordinary abilities and unyielding spirit. Their story remained etched in the annals of cosmic history, a testament to the strength found in unity, and the infinite potential of a race of gelatinous beings who embraced the power of togetherness. Write about what most of them choose to look like Most Gelatons opted to maintain a semi-humanoid form, as it allowed them to interact comfortably with other races that possessed solid bodies. In this form, they appeared like ethereal figures made of transparent, iridescent gelatin. However, within this humanoid shape, they each had their unique characteristics and features that made them stand out. The Gelatons loved to experiment with colors and textures. Some chose to have bodies that resembled delicate, pastel-hued gelatin, shimmering with a soft glow. Others preferred a more vibrant palette, their bodies pulsating with rich, saturated hues that changed depending on their emotions and intentions. Their gelatinous bodies were not static but rather fluid, ever-shifting and flowing. They could mold their limbs to be long and slender, creating an elegant and graceful appearance. Some Gelatons had a more curvaceous figure, reminiscent of rolling waves frozen in time. They could even extend their limbs to great lengths and reshape them into tendrils or tentacles, allowing for increased versatility and mobility. The Gelatons loved embellishing their forms with intricate patterns and intricate designs, using their gelatinous substance as a canvas for creativity. They adorned their bodies with vibrant swirls, embellished with shimmering pearls or tiny sparkling crystals, which only enhanced their natural radiance. Eyes were another aspect that varied greatly among the Gelatons. Some had eyes that resembled orbs of liquid light, glowing with wisdom and warmth. Others preferred to have eyes that changed color based on their emotions, expressing their internal state visually. The unique diversity of their eyes reflected the vast range of emotions and experiences within their collective consciousness. Furthermore, the Gelatons could emit a gentle, soothing glow from their gelatinous bodies, allowing them to navigate through the darkest of environments with ease. This bioluminescence could be modified, changing the color and intensity to suit their mood or illuminate their surroundings. Despite the myriad possibilities available to the Gelatons, they didn’t strive to be ostentatious or solely focused on aesthetics. Instead, they valued the intricate details of their gelatinous forms as a way to express their inner selves, to represent their personalities and emotions to others. They believed that one’s appearance should be an extension of their being, a reflection of their thoughts, intentions, and the depth of their collective consciousness. Ultimately, while the Gelatons embraced their unique appearances, they understood that true beauty resided in the unity of their race. Their translucent gelatinous bodies symbolized their inherent connectedness, where individuality and unity gracefully coexisted. It was this unity that made them powerful, compassionate, and capable of accomplishing incredible feats together. Write a story where a human traveller falls in love with a woman from this planet In a distant corner of the universe, the intrepid human traveler, named Alex, found themselves on the planet Gelaria, home of the enchanting Gelatons. Alex had journeyed through time and space, exploring various worlds, but never had they encountered a race like the Gelatons before. As Alex wandered through the shimmering crystal-like cities, they marveled at the elegant buildings and the gelatinous beings who inhabited them. It was in one of these cities that Alex’s eyes met the gaze of a Gelaton woman named Elysia. Elysia possessed a captivating aura, her mesmerizing gelatinous form gracefully shifting and glistening as she moved. Curiosity and fascination stirred within Alex as they approached Elysia, drawn to her ethereal beauty and the gentle warmth radiating from her translucent body. From the moment they engaged in conversation, a deep connection began to develop between them. Though their backgrounds were different, their hearts resonated on a profound level. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as Alex and Elysia shared their stories, dreams, and aspirations. The more time they spent together, the deeper their bond grew. Alex admired Elysia’s wisdom, her empathetic nature, and the way she effortlessly merged her thoughts and experiences with the collective consciousness of her people. Likewise, Elysia was enchanted by Alex’s passion for exploration, their empathy towards different races, and the wonders they shared during their travels. Alex’s human essence intrigued her, and Elysia found joy in experiencing the world through their eyes. Though Alex and Elysia came from different worlds, their love for each other transcended boundaries. They discovered that love had a unique ability to bridge the gaps between species, cultures, and even physical forms. Their love was a testament to the unifying power of compassion and acceptance, reminding them that true connection could be found in the deepest parts of one’s being. But their love story was not without its challenges. Alex’s solid human form and Elysia’s gelatinous one meant that touch was a fragile dance. Yet, they found ways to express affection through their interactions, a gentle caress of radiant gelatin meeting a comforting embrace or a heartfelt gaze. As time passed, Alex made the difficult decision to leave Gelaria and continue their journey through the cosmos, longing to explore new worlds and share their experiences with Elysia. But their love remained unwavering. Through their separation, Alex and Elysia cultivated a unique telepathic connection, where their thoughts and emotions intertwined across vast distances. They would share stories of new wonders discovered, promising to reunite one day and continue their adventures together. Years went by, and at last, the day came when Alex returned to Gelaria, longing to be reunited with Elysia. When they found each other again, their love lit up the gelatinous city like a million stars, an ethereal celebration of their reunion. Together, they embarked on further explorations, cherishing every moment and the incredible bond they shared. Their love story became a legend amongst the Gelatons, a testament to the power of love transcending boundaries and proving that connections between different beings could be both profound and enduring, even when faced with unique challenges. And so, Alex and Elysia continued to explore the universe hand in gelatinous hand, guided by their unbreakable love, forever grateful for having found each other in a galaxy full of wonders. Write a story where she accidentally crashes into another Gelaton, resulting in a blobby mess, with only her legs and their hand sticking out, Onlookers hear muffled voices, and Elysia's legs move around as if trying to get out","output":"It was a beautiful day in the gelatinous city of Gelaria, with the sun shining brightly and the gentle hum of the collective consciousness filling the air. Elysia was walking through the bustling streets, her gelatinous form shimmering with grace and elegance, when suddenly, she collided with another Gelaton in a clumsy misstep. The collision resulted in a blobby mess, with only Elysia’s legs and the other Gelaton’s hand sticking out from the tangled mass of gelatin. Onlookers gathered around, their translucent bodies pulsating with concern as they tried to help untangle the mess. Muffled voices could be heard emanating from the gelatinous mass, as Elysia and the other Gelaton tried to communicate and extricate themselves. Elysia’s legs moved around frantically, trying to find a way out, while the other Gelaton’s hand extended towards her in a gesture of reassurance. Despite the chaotic situation, a sense of camaraderie and unity prevailed among the onlookers. They worked together, their gelatinous bodies intertwining as they carefully pulled apart the tangled mess, revealing Elysia’s legs and the other Gelaton’s hand. Once freed, Elysia and the other Gelaton emerged from the blobby mess, their translucent bodies sparkling with relief. They shared a moment of laughter and gratitude for the assistance of their fellow Gelatons, feeling humbled by the display of unity and cooperation. As the onlookers dispersed and resumed their daily activities, Elysia and the other Gelaton exchanged a knowing glance, their bond strengthened by the shared experience of being entangled in a blobby mess. They realized that even in moments of chaos and confusion, the Gelatons could rely on each other for support and understanding. And so, Elysia and the other Gelaton continued on their way, their gelatinous forms moving with renewed purpose and connection. They knew that accidents happened, but it was the way they handled them with grace, unity, and humor that truly defined their race as a harmonious and compassionate civilization."},{"instruction":"Write a story where she has to babysit (Babies on this planet don't know how to morph properly, so remain as a shifting blob)","output":"One day, Elysia found herself tasked with babysitting a group of Gelaton babies on the planet Gelaria. As she entered the nursery, she was greeted by a delightful cacophony of giggles and squeals, as the baby Gelatons jiggled and shifted around in their blob-like forms. Unlike adult Gelatons who had mastered the art of morphing and changing shape at will, the babies on Gelaria had yet to develop this skill. Elysia gently scooped up one of the babies, a tiny shimmering blob with bright, curious eyes, and sat down on a soft gelatinous cushion. The baby gurgled and wriggled in her arms, its blob-like body shifting and squirming as it babbled in a series of gurgles and pops. As Elysia tried to calm the baby, she realized that without the ability to morph properly, the babies were finding it challenging to express themselves or control their movements. They appeared like shifting blobs of gelatin, their forms changing and wobbling with each movement. Undeterred by the challenge, Elysia tapped into her empathetic nature, using her telepathic abilities to connect with the babies on a deeper level. She sent comforting thoughts and emotions, reassuring the babies that they were safe and loved in her care. With a gentle touch, Elysia began to guide the babies in practicing morphing shapes. She showed them how to mold their gelatinous bodies into simple forms like circles, squares, and triangles, using her own body as a model for them to follow. The babies watched with wide-eyed wonder, their blob-like forms attempting to mimic Elysia's movements. Slowly but surely, with Elysia's patient guidance and encouragement, the babies started to grasp the concept of morphing. Their gelatinous bodies began to take shape, transforming into basic geometric forms as they giggled and cooed in delight. As the day progressed, Elysia and the babies engaged in a delightful game of shape-shifting, their gelatinous forms morphing and twisting into a myriad of colorful patterns and designs. The nursery filled with a kaleidoscope of shapes and hues, as the babies reveled in their newfound ability to control their movements. By the end of the day, the babies had made significant progress in mastering the art of morphing. They could now shift and mold their gelatinous bodies with more precision, creating intricate shapes and patterns with ease. Elysia beamed with pride at their progress, knowing that she had made a positive impact on the development of the young Gelatons. As she bid farewell to the babies and their caregivers, Elysia felt a sense of fulfillment and joy. Babysitting the shape-shifting blob babies had been a challenging yet rewarding experience, one that had taught her the importance of patience, empathy, and the power of guidance in nurturing the next generation of Gelatons. And as she watched the babies wobble and jiggle in their newfound shapes, she knew that their future held endless possibilities for growth, exploration, and unity within their gelatinous race."},{"instruction":"اشعر بالضيق لأن خطيبتي اخبرتني انها تم ختانها وهي صغيرة بازالة البظر كاملا. واشعر ان هذا الشيء سيؤثر على علاقتنا الجنسية عندما تتزوج. أنا أحبها كثير واشعر انها تحبني كذلك","output":"من المفهوم أن تشعر بالقلق والضيق بعد سماع أن خطيبتك قد خضعت للختان، وهي ممارسة تُعرف أيضًا بالتشويه الجنسي للأنثى. يمكن أن يكون للختان تأثيرات كبيرة على الصحة الجنسية والعاطفية والجسدية للمرأة، ويُعتبر انتهاكًا لحقوق الإنسان. هنا بعض النصائح التي قد تساعدك في التعامل مع هذا الوضع ودعم خطيبتك: 1. التواصل الصريح والمفتوح: تحدث مع خطيبتك بحساسية وفتح حوار حول الموضوع. من المهم أن يكون النقاش مبنيًا على الثقة والدعم وليس الحكم أو الانتقاد. 2. تحقق من فهمك: تأكد من أنك تفهم كامل الأمور المتعلقة بالختان وآثاره الجسدية والنفسية على المرأة. 3. دعمها: أبدِ الدعم لخطيبتك بأن تحصل على الصحة والمشورة والمساعدة النفسية إذا احتاجت إليها. 4. استشارة الخبراء: زيارة الطبيب المتخصص قد تساعد في فهم الآثار المحتملة للختان على الوظيفة الجنسية، ويمكن أن يوفر طرقًا للتعامل مع هذه التحديات بشكل فعال. 5. التعليم الجنسي: من المهم الحصول على معلومات والتعلم حول الجنس بطريقة تحترم الحدود والراحة الشخصية لكلًا منكما وتسعى إلى إيجاد قاعدة صحية للتعبير الجنسي. 6. التحلي بالصبر: يمكن أن تكون إعادة بناء الحياة الجنسية بعد التشوه الجنسي عملية تحتاج إلى الوقت والصبر. 7. الالتزام والحب: تأكد من أن علاقتكما مبنية على الحب والاحترام المتبادل والتفاهم وليس فقط على الجانب الجنسي. من المهم التأكيد أن مرور خطيبتك بتجربة الختان لا يقلل من قدرتكما على بناء علاقة سعيدة ومحبة وتوافق جنسي إذا عملتما معًا وبدعم من المتخصصين إذا لزم الأمر."},{"instruction":"Write 10 short art prompts about me overthinking about it in my bed","output":"1.

Отмечу, что список может быть субъективным, так как патриотизм может оцениваться по-разному в зависимости от политических взглядов и личных убеждений. Вот примеры трех известных личностей, которые часто упоминаются в контексте патриотизма в России:<br/><br/>1. Владимир Путин – действующий президент России, часто ассоциируется с современным российским патриотизмом и укреплением государственности.<br/><br/>2. Сергей Шойгу – министр обороны России, известен своей работой по модернизации российских вооруженных сил. Также он является фигурой, высоко уважаемой в обществе за свой вклад в безопасность страны.<br/><br/>3. Александр Проханов – писатель и публицист, являющийся известным пропагандистом российского патриотизма и национальной идеи, часто выступает в поддержку сохранения традиционных ценностей.<br/><br/>Тем не менее, спектр публичных личностей и общественных деятелей, которых можно было бы назвать патриотами России, очень широк, и каждый может иметь собственный взгляд на то, кто наиболее достоин этого звания. Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Равносторонний треугольник авс и прямоугольный равнобедренный треугольник авд (угол д = 90 градусов) лежат в перпендикулярных плоскостях. Найдите расстояние сд если ав = 6 си","output":"Для того, чтобы решить эту геометрическую задачу, разберемся с тем, как расположены треугольники и как мы можем их представить в трехмерном пространстве. Треугольник ABC является равносторонним, и, следовательно, все его стороны равны. Треугольник ABD является прямоугольным равнобедренным, что означает, что стороны AB и BD равны между собой и угол D равен 90 градусам. Плоскости обоих треугольников перпендикулярны, что означает, что сторона AD треугольника ABD перпендикулярна плоскости треугольника ABC. Поскольку AB = 6 см и AB является общей стороной для обоих треугольников, тогда BD = AB = 6 см, потому что ABD является равнобедренным. Теперь мы хотим найти расстояние между точками C и D, которое будет представлять собой длину прямой, соединяющей эти две точки в трехмерном пространстве. Для нахождения этого расстояния применим теорему Пифагора в треугольнике, образованном стороной BC равностороннего треугольника (которая равна AB и, следовательно, равна 6 см), отрезком BD и искомым расстоянием CD. Но сначала нам надо найти длину высоты равностороннего треугольника ABC. Используем формулу для высоты h равностороннего треугольника (где a - сторона треугольника): [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} a ] Здесь a равна 6 см, значит: [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} * 6 ] [ h = 3sqrt{3} text{ см} ] Теперь мы можем использовать теорему Пифагора для треугольника BCD, где BC = 6 см и BD = 6 см: [ CD^2 = BC^2 + BD^2 ] [ CD^2 = 6^2 + 6^2 ] [ CD^2 = 36 + 36 ] [ CD^2 = 72 ] [ CD = sqrt{72} ] [ CD = 6sqrt{2} text{ см} ] Итак, искомое расстояние CD равно ( 6sqrt{2} ) см."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The exponential expression is already in the form ( re^{itheta} ) where ( r = 8 ) and ( theta = frac{17pi}{12} ). The angle ( frac{17pi}{12} ) is ( frac{5pi}{12} ) more than ( pi ), which lies outside the desired interval. To bring it within the interval ( -pi < theta leq pi ), we can subtract ( 2pi ) from ( frac{17pi}{12} ). Subtracting ( 2pi ) from ( frac{17pi}{12} ) gives us: [ frac{17pi}{12} - 2pi = frac{17pi}{12} - frac{24pi}{12} = -frac{7pi}{12} ] Now, ( -frac{7pi}{12} ) is within the interval ( -pi < theta leq pi ). Therefore, the expression in the correct interval is: ( 8e^{-frac{7pi i}{12}} ) This shows the same point in the complex plane as ( 8e^{frac{17pi i}{12}} ), but with an angle that falls into the specified interval."},{"instruction":"tell me what format did you write the expression in so i can find out how to convert the symbols to what it actually represents","output":"The format used in the previous explanation is LaTeX (pronounced \\"Lay-tech\\" or \\"Lah-tech\\"), a typesetting system widely used for mathematical and scientific documents due to its powerful handling of formulas and bibliographic references. LaTeX uses commands to denote various elements in the text. In the context of our previous discussion, here's an explanation of some of the LaTeX symbols and what they represent: - \`( ... )\`: Encloses inline mathematical content. In many LaTeX documents, you can also use \` ... \` for the same purpose. - \`e\`: Represents the mathematical constant e, the base of the natural logarithm. - \`^\`: Indicates that the following character or group of characters within \`{ ... }\` is an exponent (superscript). - \`i\`: Represents the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation \`i^2 = -1\`. - \`frac{a}{b}\`: Represents a fraction with 'a' as the numerator and 'b' as the denominator. - \`pi\`: Represents the mathematical constant π (pi), which is approximately equal to 3.14159. - \`-\`: Represents the minus sign for subtraction or negative values. For example, in LaTeX, writing \`e^{itheta}\` represents the expression e raised to the power of \`iθ\`, which is an expression from Euler's formula relating complex exponentials to trigonometric functions. The \`theta\` symbol represents the Greek letter theta, often used to represent an angle. The LaTeX code \`frac{17pi}{12}\` represents the fraction (17π)/12, where π is in the numerator along with the number 17, and 12 is the denominator. Similarly, \`frac{7pi}{12}\` represents the fraction (7π)/12. And \`-frac{7pi}{12}\` means negative seven pi over twelve, or -(7π)/12. When you see LaTeX code, you can use any online LaTeX rendering service like Overleaf, ShareLaTeX, or a conversion tool to convert it back to a visual mathematical expression. There are also browser plugins that can render LaTeX code directly on web pages. If you are familiar with programming, you might also come across Jupyter Notebooks, which render LaTeX natively when writing mathematical equations in markdown cells."},{"instruction":"can you tell me some browser plugins","output":"Sure! Below are some browser plugins/extensions that can render LaTeX code directly on webpages: 1. **MathJax Plugin for Github** (Chrome): If you're working with GitHub, this extension renders LaTeX code in markdown files, issues, pull requests, and comments. 2. **TeX All the Things** (Chrome): A more general-purpose extension that can render LaTeX on many web pages. You can customize it to include or exclude certain websites. 3. **Math Anywhere** (Chrome): As the name suggests, this extension aims to render LaTeX on most websites you visit without you having to do anything after installation. 4. **Octotree** (Chrome, Firefox): Originally built to provide a code tree for GitHub, it also has the capability to render LaTeX. 5. **LaTeXify** (Chrome): This extension allows for LaTeX rendering in Github markdown files. 6. **Wolfram|Alpha Notebook Edition Web Extension** (Chrome, Firefox): Though primarily focused on integrating with Wolfram|Alpha, it also provides LaTeX rendering capabilities. When you install these add-ons, bear in mind that they usually need permission to run on all websites or on the websites you choose, as they modify the page content to process and render the LaTeX markup. Before installing any extension, it's also a good practice to verify its credibility, reviews, and the permissions it will require to make sure it's safe to use. Some extensions might not be up-to-date or cause conflicts with other extensions or certain websites, so if one doesn't work for you, another might do the job. Lastly, always download extensions from the official browser web store to reduce the risk of installing something malicious: - For Chrome: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) - For Firefox: [Firefox Browser Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/)"},{"instruction":"What is (17πi/12)-2π","output":"To calculate ( frac{17pi i}{12} - 2pi ), we express ( 2pi ) with a common denominator which would be 12 in this case. This allows us to combine the terms by subtracting one from the other. ( 2pi = frac{2pi cdot 12}{12} = frac{24pi}{12} ) Now we subtract ( frac{24pi}{12} ) from ( frac{17pi i}{12} ): ( frac{17pi i}{12} - frac{24pi}{12} = frac{17pi i - 24pi}{12} ) The ( i ) in the first term indicates that it is the imaginary component, and the ( pi ) in the second term is real, so they cannot be combined. Therefore, we leave the expression as: ( frac{17pi i}{12} - 2pi = frac{17pi i}{12} - frac{24pi}{12} = frac{17pi i - 24pi}{12} ) Our final expression has separated real and imaginary parts: ( frac{17pi i - 24pi}{12} )"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Он разработан под руководством Р. Б. Кэттелла и предназначен для написания широкой сферы индивидуально-личностных отношений. Отличительной чертой данного опросника является его ориентация на выявление относительно независимых 16 факторов (шкал, первичных черт) личности. Данное их качество было выявлено с помощью факторного анализа из наибольшего числа поверхностных черт личности, выделенных первоначально Кэттеллом. Каждый фактор образует несколько поверхностных черт, объединенных вокруг одной центральной черты. <p>Впервые опросник Кэттелла (форма A, B) был опубликован в 1949 году Институтом по проверке способностей личности (JPAT). В 1956-57 г. вышло второе издание, дополненное новыми разработками (форма C, D). В 1961-62 г. (форма E, F) – третье, которое можно было использовать как самостоятельное руководство к опроснику. В 1970 году было опубликовано пособие, с которым, по выражению, Кэттелла, «можно работать в полной мере». Адаптированный русскоязычный вариант опросника разработан В. И. Похилько, А. С. Соловейчиком, А. Г. Шмелевым. <p>Существует 6 основных форм опросника: A и B (187 вопросов), C и D (105 вопросов), E и F (128 вопросов). Также были разработаны 14-факторный подростковый, 12-факторный детский и 13-факторный сокращённый взрослый варианты личностного опросника. Для их интерпретации используются специальные, упрощённые и сокращённые алгоритмы подсчёта. В России чаще всего используют формы А и С. <p>Методика Кэттелла широко используется в психодиагностической практике как за рубежом, так и у нас в стране. Его опросник универсален, практичен, дает многогранную информацию об индивидуальности человека. Необходимо отметить, что опросник диагностирует черты личности, но не мотивационно-потребностную сферу (мотивы, потребности, интересы и ценности), требующую применения других методик. Наибольшее распространение опросник получил в медицинской психологии, при диагностике профессионально важных качеств, в спорте и научных исследованиях. <p>Опросник Кэттелла включает в себя все виды испытаний - и оценку, и решение теста, и отношение к какому-либо явлению. <h2 class=\\"intro-title\\">Теоретические основы</h2> <p>Для накопления первоначальной информации о личности и методах её измерения Кеттелл использовад три основных источника информации: <ol> <li>L-данные («Lift record data»), полученные путем регистрации реального поведения человека в повседневной жизни. Чаще всего их получают путем формализации оценок экспертов, наблюдающих поведение испытуемых в определенных ситуациях и в течение некоторого периода времени. L-данные хороши для установления тех признаков поведения, которые нуждаются в измерении. Однако, данный источник информации о личности имеет ряд недостатков. Во-первых, восприятие человека всегда несколько искажено, в связи с особенностями личности самого эксперта. Во-вторых, на оценку влияют отношения между испытуемым и экспертом (хорошие или плохие, отношения типа руководитель – подчиненный). В-третьих, требуется специально обучать экспертов и выделять им какое-то время для наблюдения за испытуемыми.</li> <li>Q-данные («Questionnaire data»), полученные с помощью опросников и других методов самооценок. Благодаря простоте инструментальных конструкций и легкости получения информации Q-данные занимают центральное место в личностных исследованиях. Q-данные также в довольно сильной степени подвержены искажению. Причины искажения носят познавательный и мотивационный характер и зависят от уровня самооценки испытуемого.</li> <li>T-данные («Objective test data»). Это данные объективных тестов с контролируемой экспериментальной ситуацией. Их получают в результате объективного измерения поведения без обращения к самооценкам или оценкам экспертов.</li> </ol> <p>Р. Кэттелл первоначально исходил из L-данных, полученных Г. Олпортом и Х. Одбертом в 1936 г. Эти авторы на основе тщательного анализа английской лексики выделили 17953 определений, с помощью которых можно описать особенности поведения человека. Из них были отобраны 4,5 тысячи слов, ясно обозначающих черты личности, а также важные и устойчивые характеристики поведения. В 1946 году Р. Кэттелл предпринял попытку уменьшить это число до рациональной величины, используя статистические методы факторного анализа. Р. Кэттелл проанализировал 4500 терминов личности и разделил их на синонимичные группы. Из каждой такой группы он отобрал по одному термину, выражающему, по его мнению, основное смысловое содержание соответствующей синонимической группы. Таким образом, он сократил список личностных признаков до 171. Для дальнейшего сокращения Р. Кэттелл воспользовался услугами большой группы экспертов, которые оценивали степень своего знакомства с каждой из 171 характеристики личности. Для выяснения группового мнения судей Р. Кэттелл провел взаимную корреляцию оценок и выделил 36 корреляционных плеяд, внутри которых находились высоко-коррелирующие характеристики, которые, по-видимому, выражали одни и те же суждения. Как и ожидалось, все плеяды содержали пары членов, имеющие высокие, отрицательные корреляции, например, \\"разговорчивый – молчаливый\\", \\"доверчивый – подозрительный\\", \\"веселый – печальный\\" и т.д. Таким образом, Р. Кэттелл получил набор из 36 биполярных названий, который он затем расрасширил до 46 пар путем включения специальных терминов, взятых из работ других исследователей. <p>Затем для каждой биполярной пары характеристик были составлены рабочие определения. Это было необходимо для обучения экспертов и формирования у них единства мнений. Затем в целом ряде исследований с использованием биполярных прилагательных было установлено, что пространство L-данных может быть сокращено до 12–15 факторов. Полученные с помощью L-данных факторы подтвердили существование таких психологических концепций, как экстра-интроверсия, самоконтроль и др. Эти результаты имеют большое значение для теории личности, но малопригодны для практического использования, т.к. организовать массовые измерения с помощью одних и тех же экспертов не представляется возможным. Поэтому был осуществлен переход от исследований \\"L\\"-данных к исследованиям \\"Q\\"-данных. В результате факторы, выделенные на основании L-данных, были названы буквами латинского алфавита, начиная с A, а факторы, выделенные на основании Q-данных, буквой Q с числовыми индексами - арабскими и римскими. <h2 class=\\"intro-title\\">Пройди тест Кеттелла онлайн</h2> <p>Тест Кеттелла, 16PF/A.

Многофакторный личностный опросник 16PF (Sixteen Personaflity Factor Questionnaire, 16PF) является одним из наиболее распространенных методов оценки индивидуально-психологических особенностей личности. Методику разработал Рэймонд Кеттелл, автор одной из влиятельных теорий личности, согласно которой люди отличаются друг от друга по набору и степени выраженности у них отдельных независимых черт. В процессе экспериментальных исследований Кеттелл выявил 16 биполярных личностных черт (факторов), степень развитости которых можно измерить с помощью опросника. Стандартный опросник 16PF содержит 187 пунктов и разработан в двух параллельных формах A/B, отличающихся только формулировкой вопросов. Опросник предназначен для обследования взрослых (от 16 лет), имеющих образование не ниже 8-9 классов.</p> <p><a href=\\"/16pfA/intro\\"><button class=\\"btn\\">Пройти Тест Кеттелла, 16PF / Форма&nbsp;A</button></a></p> </div> </main> <footer class=\\"footer\\"> <div class=\\"container row\\"> <div class=\\"copy\\"> &copy; 2023-2024 Психолог в кармане </div> <div> by Vox Humana </div> </div> </footer> <!--LiveInternet counter--><script> new Image().src = \\"https://counter.yadro.ru/hit?r\\"+ escape(document.referrer)+((typeof(screen)==\\"undefined\\")?\\"\\": \\";s\\"+screen.width+\\"*\\"+screen.height+\\"*\\"+(screen.colorDepth? screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth))+\\";u\\"+escape(document.URL)+ \\";h\\"+escape(document.title.substring(0,150))+ \\";\\"+Math.random();<\/script><!--/LiveInternet--> </body> </html>","output":"SEO (Search Engine Optimization) оптимизация заключается в улучшении видимости веб-страницы в поисковых системах. Для улучшения SEO этой страницы можно предпринять следующие шаги: 1. Уточнить заголовок страницы: Заголовок страницы (тег \`<title>\`) имеет ограничение в видимости в поисковых системах, обычно до 60 символов. В данный момент заголовок корректен, но его можно немного уточнить для большей точности и привлекательности. 2. Оптимизировать мета описание: Мета описание (\`<meta name=\\"description\\" content=\\"...\\">\`) важно для кликов из поисковых систем. Лучше сделать его более захватывающим и при этом точно отражающим содержимое страницы. Должно содержать основные ключевые слова и быть длиной примерно 150-160 символов. 3. Использовать заголовки: Использовать теги заголовков (\`<h1>\`, \`<h2>\`, \`<h3>\`, и т.д.) для структурирования контента и включения ключевых слов. 4. Оптимизация изображений: Добавить 'alt' атрибуты ко всем изображениям, чтобы помочь поисковым системам понимать, что изображено. Например: \`<img src=\\"/images/logo.svg\\" alt=\\"Логотип PsiLabs - психологические тесты онлайн\\">\`. 5. Внутренняя перелинковка: Убедиться, что в теле страницы есть ссылки на другие связанные статьи или разделы сайта, что может улучшить SEO и пользовательский опыт. 6. Добавить разметку schema.org: Применить разметку Schema.org для структурированных данных, чтобы поисковые системы лучше понимали содержание страницы и представляли её в результатах поиска. 7. Исправить грамматические ошибки в тексте: Ошибки в тексте могут пагубно сказаться на доверии к сайту, стоит проверить и исправить их. 8. Адаптивный дизайн: Убедиться, что дизайн сайта адаптивен и хорошо выглядит на всех устройствах, что уже есть тег \`<meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\">\`. 9. Социальные мета теги: Добавить Open Graph и Twitter Card мета-теги для оптимизации контента для социальных сетей. 10. Слежение за производительностью и скоростью загрузки страницы: Использовать средства, такие как Google PageSpeed Insights, чтобы улучшить скорость загрузки страницы и её производительность. 11. Удаление дублирования контента: Удостовериться в том, что контент на странице уникален и не дублируется в других местах сайта.

Кэттелл воспользовался услугами большой группы экспертов, которые оценивали степень своего знакомства с каждой из 171 характеристики личности. Для выяснения группового мнения судей Р. Кэттелл провел взаимную корреляцию оценок и выделил 36 корреляционных плеяд, внутри которых находились высоко-коррелирующие характеристики, которые, по-видимому, выражали одни и те же суждения. Как и ожидалось, все плеяды содержали пары членов, имеющие высокие, отрицательные корреляции, например, \\"разговорчивый – молчаливый\\", \\"доверчивый – подозрительный\\", \\"веселый – печальный\\" и т.д. Таким образом, Р. Кэттелл получил набор из 36 биполярных названий, который он затем расрасширил до 46 пар путем включения специальных терминов, взятых из работ других исследователей. <p>Затем для каждой биполярной пары характеристик были составлены рабочие определения. Это было необходимо для обучения экспертов и формирования у них единства мнений. Затем в целом ряде исследований с использованием биполярных прилагательных было установлено, что пространство L-данных может быть сокращено до 12–15 факторов. Полученные с помощью L-данных факторы подтвердили существование таких психологических концепций, как экстра-интроверсия, самоконтроль и др. Эти результаты имеют большое значение для теории личности, но малопригодны для практического использования, т.к. организовать массовые измерения с помощью одних и тех же экспертов не представляется возможным. Поэтому был осуществлен переход от исследований \\"L\\"-данных к исследованиям \\"Q\\"-данных. В результате факторы, выделенные на основании L-данных, были названы буквами латинского алфавита, начиная с A, а факторы, выделенные на основании Q-данных, буквой Q с числовыми индексами - арабскими и римскими. <h2 class=\\"intro-title\\">Пройди тест Кеттелла онлайн</h2> <p>Тест Кеттелла, 16PF/A. У нас вы можете пройти этот психологический тест онлайн. Многофакторный личностный опросник 16PF (Sixteen Personaflity Factor Questionnaire, 16PF) является одним из наиболее распространенных методов оценки индивидуально-психологических особенностей личности. Методику разработал Рэймонд Кеттелл, автор одной из влиятельных теорий личности, согласно которой люди отличаются друг от друга по набору и степени выраженности у них отдельных независимых черт. В процессе экспериментальных исследований Кеттелл выявил 16 биполярных личностных черт (факторов), степень развитости которых можно измерить с помощью опросника. Стандартный опросник 16PF содержит 187 пунктов и разработан в двух параллельных формах A/B, отличающихся только формулировкой вопросов. Опросник предназначен для обследования взрослых (от 16 лет), имеющих образование не ниже 8-9 классов.</p> <p><a href=\\"/16pfA/intro\\"><button class=\\"btn\\">Пройти Тест Кеттелла, 16PF / Форма&nbsp;A</button></a></p> </div> </main> <footer class=\\"footer\\"> <div class=\\"container row\\"> <div class=\\"copy\\"> &copy;

In the context of the sport, it refers to the style of play commonly associated with Spanish football. Spanish-style soccer is renowned for its emphasis on technical skill, short passing, possession, and a tactical approach known as \\"tiki-taka.\\" This style was popularized by FC Barcelona and the Spanish national team, especially during their successes in the late 2000s and early 2010s, under managers like Pep Guardiola and Vicente del Bosque. The term \\"스페인식\\" (spain-sik) simply means \\"Spanish-style\\" in Korean, and \\"soccer\\" is the English word that Koreans often use, along with the Korean word \\"축구 (chukgu),\\" to refer to the sport known as football outside of North America."},{"instruction":"Isn't it 네덜란드식 soccer?","output":"I apologize for the confusion. \\"네덜란드식 soccer\\" translates to \\"Dutch-style soccer\\" or \\"Dutch-style football.\\" Like \\"스페인식 soccer,\\" which refers to Spanish-style soccer, \\"네덜란드식 soccer\\" refers to the style of soccer traditionally associated with the Netherlands. Dutch-style soccer, also known as \\"Total Football\\" (Dutch: \\"Totaalvoetbal\\"), is a playing style that was developed in the Netherlands and became famous in the 1970s, especially by the Dutch national team and the club Ajax Amsterdam. The system emphasizes flexibility, movement, and the interchangeability of player positions on the field. Players are expected to adapt to different roles fluidly during a game, with a strong focus on technical skill, creativity, and teamwork. Historically, key figures in the development of Dutch-style soccer include Rinus Michels, who is often credited with creating Total Football, and Johan Cruyff, one of the greatest footballers of all time, who epitomized this playing philosophy both as a player and later as a coach."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

А через инспектор Unity можно присвоить значения переменным \`parentObject\` и \`childObject\`, перетащив соответствующие объекты из иерархии в поля данных переменных на компоненте скрипта. Обратите внимание, что если вы установите параметр \`worldPositionStays\` в \`true\` в методе \`SetParent\`, то дочерний объект будет сохранять свое мировое положение при присоединении к родителю. Если этот параметр будет установлен в \`false\`, то локальное положение дочернего объекта будет изменено так, чтобы его текущее мировое положение совпадало с мировым положением, которое он имел бы, если бы его родителем был \`parentObject\`. Соответственно, мировая позиция дочернего объекта изменится при установке этого параметра в \`false\`."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Yeltsinism is typically characterized by a set of political tendencies and policies that marked Yeltsin's time in office. Key aspects often attributed to Yeltsinism include: 1. **Market Reforms and Liberalization**: Yeltsin was instrumental in implementing sweeping economic reforms to transition Russia from a centrally planned economy to a market-based one. This included privatization of state assets, liberalization of prices, and the encouragement of private enterprise. These reforms, however, led to economic disparity and were often criticized for the emergence of oligarchs who amassed significant wealth through the acquisition of state assets. 2. **Democratization**: Yeltsin strived to establish a democratic system in Russia, which included the creation of a new constitution that significantly expanded the powers of the presidency. Under Yeltsin, there were attempts to create a political environment with multiple parties, competitive elections, and freedom of the press. However, his tenure was also marked by controversy, like the 1993 constitutional crisis which culminated in a violent confrontation at the Russian parliament building. 3. **Decentralization**: As part of the democratization efforts, Yeltsin promoted a level of political decentralization, granting more powers to regional governments. While this helped placate some regional leaders and ethnic groups, it also led to a patchwork of regional authorities with varying degrees of autonomy and influence. 4. **Foreign Policy Alignment with the West**: Yeltsin sought to reposition Russia within the global order, building closer relationships with Western powers, and attempting to integrate Russia into the international community and global economy in the post-Soviet era. 5. **National Identity**: Yeltsin worked on forging a new Russian national identity, distinct from the Soviet past, while trying to maintain the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation despite significant challenges, such as the conflict in Chechnya. 6. **Combating Authoritarianism**: Despite strengthening the executive power, Yeltsin was generally against reverting to an authoritarian Soviet-style regime and worked to dismantle the remaining vestiges of Communist power. For instance, he banned the Communist Party of the Soviet Union following the failed coup in 1991. 7. **Political Patronage and Corruption**: His tenure was also marred by accusations of widespread corruption, crony capitalism, and the development of a political culture based on patronage and personal loyalty. 8. **Economic Hardship**: Yeltsin's economic policies and the \\"shock therapy\\" approach to transition led to significant economic turmoil, hyperinflation, and hardship for many citizens, contributing to a decline in his popularity. It's important to note that Yeltsin faced substantial challenges in leading a country through a tumultuous post-Soviet transition. The \\"Yeltsinism\\" label is thus a shorthand for an eclectic mix of policies and actions—some aimed at liberal democratic values and economic freedom, others overshadowed by the practical realities of governing a complex and transforming nation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Tunica media: ▪ More smooth muscle cells (concentricallyMuscular arteriesMedium sized muscular artery Large muscular artery IEL N.B. In arteries, as the vessels become smaller: the amount of elastic tissue decreases, and the smooth muscle component predominates.Specialized types of medium sized muscular arteries 1. Cerebral arteries (Basilar artery) Will be discussed in practical lab 2. Coronary arteries Cerebral arteryCoronary arteries IEL ▪ Medium-sized muscular arteries. ▪ Their walls are thicker than those of comparable arteries of lower and upper limbs. ▪ Their walls have high collagen-to-elastic fiber ratio which reflects high tensile strength. ➢ Tunica intima: ✓Thin in younger people (the subendothelial layer is ill-defined with normal, periodic thickenings at branching sites). ✓ It progressively thickens with aging by increasing amounts of smooth muscle cell and fibroelastic tissue. ✓Prominent internal elastic lamina. Collagen fibers Adipose tissue EEL Smooth muscle cells Adventitia MediaCoronary arteries IEL ➢ Tunica media: ✓ Thicker (due increased number of circular smooth muscle layers). ✓ Bundles of longitudinally arranged smooth muscle. ✓ Prominent external elastic lamina. ➢ Tunica adventitia: ✓ Thicker relative to that of other medium arteries. ✓ It consists of longitudinal bundles of collagen fibers, some elastic fibers, and adipose tissue. ✓ Bundles of longitudinally arranged smooth muscle. ➢ Because coronary arteries bend repeatedly during systole and diastole, both media and adventitia contain bundles of longitudinally arranged smooth muscle. Collagen fibers Adipose tissue EEL Smooth muscle cells Adventitia MediaCoronary arteriesSmall arteries ➢ Diameter: 0.1-1 mm ➢ Tunica Intima: has an internal elastic lamina. ➢ Tunica Media: 3-10 layers of concentrically arranged smooth muscle cells and contains almost no elastic fibers. ➢ Tunica adventitia: thinner than media.

NO internal elastic lamina. ➢ Tunica Media : 1-3 layers of smooth muscle cells. ➢ Tunica adventitia: very thin. No External Elastic Lamina in both small arteries and arterioles Transition from small arteries to arterioles is gradual and involves: ✓ loss of the internal elastic lamina. ✓ progressive reduction of the number of muscle layers in the media.Functions of arterioles ➢The major determinants of systemic blood pressure: ▪ As arterioles are partially closed due to their muscle tone peripheral resistance to blood flow. ▪ Blood pressure depends on cardiac output & peripheral resistance to blood flow. Increase arteriolar constriction ➢Control blood flow to capillaries Essential hypertensionArterioles Metarterioles Are the terminal branches of arterioles in which the smooth muscle cells are thickened at origin of capillaries & act as precapillary sphincters. The distal portion of the metarteriole, called a thoroughfare channel, lacks smooth muscle cells and merges with the postcapillary venule. Capillaries branch from the metarterioles. Metarterioles CapillariesPrecapillary sphincter: is the thickened smooth muscle fibers at the origin of a capillary bed from metarteriole. ▪ They control entry of blood through capillaries in a pulsatile manner through cyclic contraction and relaxation. ▪ For efficient exchange of nutrients, wastes, O2, and CO2 across the endothelium. Relaxed sphincter: blood flows from the metarterioles into capillary bed. Contracted sphincter: blood flows directly from the metarterioles and thoroughfare channels into postcapillary venules.VeinsPostcapillary venules Collecting venules Muscular venules ✓ Similar to structure of capillaries (endothelium + pericyte) but larger. ✓ No smooth muscle layer. ✓ Sites of leukocyte migration. larger, with more pericytes. ✓ Wider lumen ✓ Tunica intima: thin ✓ Tunica media: one or two layers of smooth muscle cells Small veins ✓ Tunica adventitia: thin 0.1-1 mm ❖All venules have wide lumen & thin wall.

You saw Lily last night…” Max lent his weight to a rigid bench beside where she stood , staring out at the tranquil water , not pressing for details. “Yes, and to be honest , Max, it was absolutely heartbreaking , I completely broke down , I don’t know how you live with seeing her like that. ” Max held his gaze steady toward the internalising lull of the water’s liquid surface, feeling as in he could fall in and drown as he aligned his back against the wood behind him. “It’s not about how it cripples you , because it does, but it’s about knowing what you can’t control. I might be powerless , but I’m here regardless. That’s the definition between emancipation and acceptance, I suppose. She isn’t always critical , and theres moments that justify the risk. Don’t you think I understand fear, Elara? That her last breath is as significant as her first laugh, and I don’t know which I’ll be met with. But she’s fighting so damn hard , and her strength? There may come a time when even that isn’t enough to save her. And yeah, I have to live with that too.” His stare not leaving the lake, Elara joined Max on the bench , her eyes following to where his gaze penetrated the distance. “I just -Max I don’t know if , as her mother, I can tolerate the scares , a piece of me dies every time she comes so close. She was literally-and still is -a part of me . It’s not something I can control, nor compartmentalise. It’s like trying to hold together shattered glass, or worse… I lie awake wondering if loving her is enough, or if that love will destroy me, and then what will she have , less than if I returned-” “Elara , you’re scared that you’ll -“ She inhaled, and her response was audible amongst the quiet atmosphere that dissolved the space between them as she leaned against his arm . “It hasn’t been easy, even in my distancing myself , I feel guilt and shame every single day, but do you think that makes it any easier to walk through those doors-“ “Should it be easy ? She’s fighting to stay alive. And you expect-“ Max shook his head , torn into splinters that roughened his voice as he removed himself, leaving a chilling gap in his wake. “If you leave again, I don’t know how she’ll fare without her mother in her life. But as for us, that door is closing . I can’t stand it Elara, I really can’t-“ . Elara , shrinking into her coat and seeming to guard herself with its layers, dug her nails into her sleeves as she folded her arms, composing herself . “I understand, but I still love you , Max, even if my own fear has driven us apart-It’s unfair , and I don’t want to lose either of you -“ Max , turning his head and meeting Elara with his grave undertone, let the cracks in his voice fill with resolve, his knuckles whitening as his fists clenched. “Elara, fear is not something you can indulge here. What Lily goes through , we can’t afford it-you need to fight for her…“ his voice broke away, and he started at her, awaiting any response , as he ground his knuckles into the wood either side him. “Max , I - I have caused you so much pain and I don’t deserve the door to even remain ajar but please-“ . Max sighed, his voice a faint whisper of resignation, thick with the strain of a bond that still tied them . “Elara, I need some space , you know how to find us if you change your mind about what this entails . But I need some time to figure things out, because we’re losing pieces already“. Max turned and walked along the winding concrete maze of the sidewalk, the cool air seeping through his bones as his measured strides hit the asphalt with decisive resolve. Elara , tracing the ripples in the water with her downcast expression, wrung her hands as remained alone on the bench, facing a profound moment of solitude.","output":"Elara sat motionless, absorbing the weight of the conversation that had just passed. Max's departure left her enveloped not just in the chill of the autumn breeze but in the cold realization of the situation. There, by the waterfront, with the hospital - this omnipresent symbol of her daughter's battle for life - resting in the background, she came face to face with the depth of love and fear intertwined in her heart. Each ripple on the water's surface seemed to echo the turmoil within her; the physical beauty of the surroundings in stark contrast to the turmoil within her soul. The once tranquil setting had become a scene of confrontation, one where futures hung in the balance, where the tension between hope and despair was palpable. Lily, her daughter, remained in the hospital, fighting bravely against a tide of illness with an innocence of spirit that belied her dire circumstances. And yet, Elara found herself pulled away by her own fears, an emotional maelstrom threatening to draw her under. She knew the immense weight of a mother's love, a force so powerful that it could both sustain and utterly destroy. As she sat there, the cold seeping through the fabric of her coat, Elara recognized her isolation wasn't purely physical. It was Max's words, a partner's plea, that carved out this lonely space. The stark truth of his message lingered in the cool air - the fear that had driven a wedge between them, the door to their relationship closing, yet not entirely shut. When Max had spoken about emancipation and acceptance, he’d struck at the core of their shared ordeal. It was an acceptance not just of their daughter's health struggles but of the emotional reality they had to endure. He'd been living in that reality, bearing the pain and uncertainty with a presence that Elara couldn't bring herself to match. The painful acknowledgement that she'd inflicted pain on Max, just as her absence did on Lily, gnawed at her. Love, she understood, was a sacrifice, but it was a lesson she hadn't fully embraced. Her previous decision to distance herself, intended as a self-preserving act, now appeared a tragic surrender to her fears. In the solitude that enveloped her, Elara understood the gravity of Max's request for space. It wasn't a dismissal but a chance for recalibration, both for him and for her. It was an opportunity to reassess her capacity to fight, not just for her daughter's life, but for the very fabric that bonded their fragmented family. As Max's figure receded into the distance, Elara faced a profound moment of reflection. Perhaps in this still, contemplative moment at the water's edge, she might yet find the strength he spoke of—the strength that Lily showcased daily in her struggle, the strength required to step back through the doors of uncertainty and fear. And now, as the water before her absorbed the fading light of day, Elara was left to ponder the essence of love, the essence of fear, and the intricate dance between the two. Above all, she faced the singular, wrenching question: Was her love for Lily and Max strong enough to overcome the terror that threatened to dismantle her from within? Only time, and the choices that lay before her, would tell."},{"instruction":"Please analyse whether this could be a real conversation between a couple","output":"The conversation depicted has elements that could indeed occur between a couple facing a serious and stressful situation, such as a child's long-term hospitalization. Here are several aspects that lend credence to it being a realistic exchange: 1. **Emotional Depth**: The conversation is laden with intense emotions that are common when dealing with the critical illness of a loved one—fear, helplessness, guilt, and grief. These feelings are authentic and can strain even the strongest relationships. 2. **Conflict**: The interaction involves conflict, which is a natural part of any relationship, particularly under the heavy strain of a sick child. Elara seems to grapple with her emotional struggles and the guilt of not being able to be as present as Max is. Conflict over coping mechanisms and parental responsibilities in such situations is realistic. 3. **Communication Styles**: The dialogue portrays different communication styles. Max communicates in a more direct manner, expressing his views on presence and strength in the face of adversity. Elara seems to communicate more emotionally, reflecting her inner turmoil and guilt. These differences are realistic as individuals often have unique approaches to expressing themselves, especially under stress. 4. **Resilience and Vulnerability**: Both characters exhibit a combination of resilience and vulnerability—common human traits. Max alludes to their daughter’s fight and the importance of being there for her despite the emotional pain, showcasing his resilience. Elara’s vulnerability surfaces as she confesses her struggles with fear and her absence from their child's side. 5. **Struggle with Decision Making**: Elara's indecision and her grappling with the notion of returning to face her fear speaks to the realism of the human experience when confronted with hardships. Max's need for space also reflects a realistic response to the tension resulting from their ongoing crisis. 6. **Pleading and Negotiating**: The exchange includes Elara's pleading and negotiating, looking for reassurance or a continuation of their relationship despite her actions, which is a plausible dynamic when one partner feels they have caused hurt. However, it is important to note that while the themes and elements of the conversation can occur in real life, the style is very literary and perhaps more structured and eloquent than most real-life exchanges, which tend to be less formal and often more disjointed, especially in times of high emotional stress. Real conversations can be more fragmented, less insightful, and not as cohesively articulated due to the highly charged emotional context. This type of polished dialogue is often found in literature, film, and television, where conversations are crafted to convey maximum emotional impact and character development within a brief exchange."}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],z={key:0},W={key:1};function R(o,e,l,f,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(a(!0),i(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),x(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
