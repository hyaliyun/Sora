Since he worked for 3/4 of the year, we can calculate the amount he would have earned for that period by taking 3/4 of Rs. 900: (3/4) * 900 = Rs. 675 However, the servant received Rs. 650 instead of Rs. 675 for 9 months of service. The difference between what he should have received for 9 months of service (Rs. 675) and what he actually received (Rs. 650) is the price of the uniform: Price of the uniform (U) = Rs. 675 - Rs. 650 U = Rs. 25 Therefore, the price of the uniform is Rs. boxed{25} ."},{"instruction":"On a hot day, Megan and her friend Anna decide to eat ice cream cones at a steady pace.

On flat terrain, Annika hikes at a rate of 12 minutes per kilometer. For 1.5 kilometers, it would take her: 1.5 km * 12 min/km = 18 minutes When hiking uphill, her speed decreases by 20%. So, her uphill hiking time per kilometer would be: 12 min/km * (1 + 0.20) = 12 min/km * 1.20 = 14.4 min/km For 1.25 kilometers uphill, it would take her: 1.25 km * 14.4 min/km = 18 minutes So far, Annika has hiked for a total of: 18 min (flat) + 18 min (uphill) = 36 minutes She has 51 minutes to get back to the start of the trail, which means she has: 51 min - 36 min = 15 minutes left to hike east and then return. Now, when hiking downhill, her speed increases by 30%.

She will then have to hike the same distance back uphill and on flat terrain. The time it takes her to hike downhill and then back would be: Downhill: x km * 8.4 min/km Uphill: x km * 14.4 min/km Flat: (1.5 km - x km) * 12 min/km (since she already hiked 1.5 km east on flat terrain) The total time for the return trip should be equal to the remaining 15 minutes: x * 8.4 + x * 14.4 + (1.5 - x) * 12 = 15 Now, let's solve for x: 8.4x + 14.4x + 18 - 12x = 15 22.8x + 18 - 12x = 15 10.8x = 15 - 18 10.8x = -3 x = -3 / 10.8 x = -0.2778 Since the distance cannot be negative, this means that Annika cannot continue hiking east if she wants to return to the start of the trail in exactly 51 minutes.

The slant height of the cone is equal to the original radius R of the semicircle. Using the Pythagorean Theorem in the resulting right-angled triangle (using the radius of the cone's base r, the slant height R, and the height h), we have: h^2 + r^2 = R^2.

For the uphill section (0.5 km at 15 minutes per km): 0.5 km * 15 minutes/km = 7.5 minutes For the downhill section (0.5 km at 5 minutes per km): 0.5 km * 5 minutes/km = 2.5 minutes The total time for the uphill and downhill sections is: 7.5 minutes + 2.5 minutes = 10 minutes Now, let's calculate the time Annika has left to hike after accounting for the uphill and downhill sections. She has 45 minutes total, and she will need the same amount of time to return, so she can only use half of that time to continue hiking east before turning around. Time available for the outward hike: 45 minutes / 2 = 22.5 minutes Since she will spend 10 minutes on the uphill and downhill sections, she has: 22.5 minutes - 10 minutes = 12.5 minutes left for flat terrain hiking. On flat terrain, Annika hikes at a rate of 10 minutes per kilometer, so in 12.5 minutes, she can hike: 12.5 minutes / 10 minutes/km = 1.25 kilometers Adding this to the 2.75 kilometers she has already hiked, we get: 2.75 km + 1.25 km = 4 kilometers So, Annika will have hiked a total of boxed{4}  kilometers east before she needs to turn around and head back to the start of the trail."},{"instruction":"Given a complex number z satisfies frac{z1}{z+2}=1+3i, where i is the imaginary unit, then left| overline{z}+2i right|=    (    ) A: sqrt{2} B: sqrt{3} C: sqrt{5} D: sqrt{6}","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the conjugate of a complex number, the four arithmetic operations of complex numbers, and the modulus of a complex number.

Let ( P(x) ) be a polynomial with real coefficients and let ( m ) be the degree of ( P(x) ). We are given that ( P(P(P(x))) = Ax^n + 19x + 99 ). 2. The degree of ( P(P(P(x))) ) is ( m^3 ). This is because the degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees. 3. We need to consider two cases: ( A = 0 ) and ( A neq 0 ). # Case 1: ( A = 0 ) 4. If ( A = 0 ), then ( P(P(P(x))) = 19x + 99 ). This implies that the degree of ( P(P(P(x))) ) is 1. 5. Since ( m^3 = 1 ), we have ( m = 1 ). Therefore, ( P(x) ) must be a linear polynomial of the form ( P(x) = ax + b ). 6. Substituting ( P(x) = ax + b ) into ( P(P(P(x))) ), we get:    [    P(P(P(x))) = a(a(ax + b) + b) + b = a(a^2x + ab + b) + b = a^3x + a^2b + ab + b    ] 7.

If ( A neq 0 ), then the degree of ( P(P(P(x))) ) is ( n ). This implies ( m^3 = n ). 12. Given ( 2 leq n leq 19 ), the only integer ( m ) that satisfies ( m^3 = n ) is ( m = 2 ) and ( n = 8 ). 13. Therefore, ( P(x) ) must be a quadratic polynomial of the form ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ). 14. The highest degree term in ( P(P(x)) ) is ( a^3x^4 ) and the highest degree term in ( P(P(P(x))) ) is ( a^7x^8 ). 15. Comparing this with ( Ax^8 + 19x + 99 ), we get ( a^7 = A ) and the coefficient of ( x^7 ) must be zero. 16. The coefficient of ( x^7 ) in ( P(P(P(x))) ) is ( 4a^6b ). For this to be zero, ( b ) must be zero. 17. Therefore, ( P(x) ) must be of the form ( P(x) = ax^2 + c ). 18. However, if ( P(x) ) is even, then ( P(P(P(x))) ) must also be even, which contradicts the presence of the linear term ( 19x ). 19. Hence, there is no solution if ( A neq 0 ). # Conclusion 20.

Now, let's add the cost of both pairs of shoes together: 40 (first pair) + 20 (discounted second pair) = 60. Next, we apply the extra discount of a fourth off the total amount.

The original dimensions of the metallic sheet are 48 m x 38 m. After cutting off the squares, the new dimensions of the base of the box will be: Length: 48 m - 16 m = 32 m Width: 38 m - 16 m = 22 m The height of the box will be equal to the side length of the square that was cut off, which is 8 m. Now, we can calculate the volume of the open box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: Volume = Length x Width x Height Substituting the values we have: Volume = 32 m x 22 m x 8 m Volume = 704 m² x 8 m Volume = 5632 m³ However, we need to consider the thickness of the material, which is 0.5 m. Since the material is metallic and we assume it's uniformly thick, the thickness will not affect the external dimensions of the box, but it will reduce the internal volume.

Step-by-step solution: 1. **Introduction to variables**:     - In this problem, ( OA, OB, AB, AC, BC ) are all variables, while ( BC + CA = l) is a constant. These variables influence the area of the quadrilateral ( ACBO). 2. **Fixing ( AB )**:    - We start by fixing ( AB ), and allowing ( OA ), ( OB ), ( AC ), ( BC ) to vary. By doing this, we turn the problem into two sub-problems related to maximizing the area. 3. **Problem 1**:     - In triangle ( triangle ABC ), if ( AB ) is fixed and ( AC + BC = l ) is constant, when is the area of ( triangle ABC ) maximized?    - **Sentence**:      - This is a problem of isoperimetric inequality. The conclusion is that ( triangle ABC ) has maximum area when it is an isosceles triangle with equal legs (left( AC = BC = frac{l}{2} right)).       - **Explanation**:        - Let's assume ( triangle ABC ) is isosceles with ( AC = CB = frac{l}{2} ) and let ( triangle ABC^{prime} ) be not isosceles. If both triangles share the common base ( AB ) and the conditions:          [          AC + CB = AC^{prime} + CB^{prime} = l,          ]        - We need to show that the area ( S_{triangle ABC} > S_{triangle ABC^{prime}} ).        - If ( C ) and ( C^{prime} ) are on the same side of ( AB ) and line ( l ) is parallel to ( AB ) through ( C ), it suffices to show ( C^{prime} ) lies between line ( l ) and ( AB ).        - Otherwise, if ( M ) is the intersection of ( AC' ) with line ( l ), and with ( B' ) being the reflex point of ( B ) with respect to ( l ):          [          begin{aligned}              AC' + C'B &geq AM + MB^{prime} = AM + MB > AB'               &= AC + CB^{prime} = AC + CB,          end{aligned}          ]        - This provides a contradiction to ( AC + CB = AC' + C'B ), resolving Problem 1. 4. **Problem 2**:    - In triangle ( triangle AOB ), if ( AB ) is a fixed length and ( angle AOB = 90^circ ), when is the area of ( triangle AOB ) maximum?    - **Sentence**:      - Given that ( S_{triangle AOB} = frac{1}{2} OA cdot OB leq frac{1}{4} (OA^2 + OB^2) = frac{1}{4} AB^2 ),          - The area is maximized when ( OA = OB ), which makes ( triangle AOB ) isosceles. 5. **Combining the two problems**:    - Therefore, combining the two problems, the maximum area of the quadrilateral ( ACBO ) is achieved when:    - ( OA = OB ) and ( AC = CB = frac{1}{2} l ).    - At this configuration, point ( C ) lies on the angle bisector of ( angle POQ ). 6. **Detailed calculations for maximization**:    - Considering ( ACBO ), we fix ( AB ), maximizing ( triangle AOC ):    - When ( triangle AOC ) has maximum area with ( AC = frac{1}{2} l ) as fixed length and ( angle AOC = 45^circ ) as fixed angle, it happens when ( A C = O C ).    - Hence, when ( AOB ) is an isosceles right triangle, overall, the configuration occurs with points ( A ) and ( B ) symmetrical about the bisectors, making:      [      OA = frac{sqrt{2+2sqrt{2}}}{4}.      ] 7. **Summary**:    - The quadrilateral ( ACBO ) forms ( OA ) as the radius of the inscribed circle of an octant, making ( A, C, B ) symmetric. # Conclusion: Hence, the area of the quadrilateral ( ACBO ) is maximized when it forms a section of a circle inscribed, specifically this reveals: [ boxed{ABO = text{Isoceles Right Triangle and } AC = CB = frac{1}{2}l } ]"},{"instruction":"A point Q has coordinates (a, b) such that the distance from the origin O to Q is noted d.

Then let ( p ) and ( n ) be as above.

This contradiction proves the claim. (blacksquare) 2. **Lemma:** If ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct positive integers, then there exists an odd integer ( n ) and an odd prime ( p ) such that ( p nmid a, b ) and ( p mid a^n + b^n ).    **Proof:**    First, write ( d = gcd(a, b) ) and then let ( x = frac{a}{d} ) and ( y = frac{b}{d} ). Take ( q ) to be a sufficiently large odd prime, more precisely, take ( q ) so that ( q > a + b ) and ( q > r ) for all ( r mid d ). Then take ( n = q ) and ( p ) as an odd prime dividing:    [    frac{x^q + y^q}{x + y}    ]    To see that such ( p ) exists, first note that since ( a ne b ) by assumption, we cannot have ( x = y = 1 ) and hence (frac{x^q + y^q}{x + y} > 1). Now to show that ( p ) is odd, note that since ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ), we must have that either ( x, y ) are both odd or have different parities. In the latter case, we would have that (frac{x^q + y^q}{x + y}) is odd and we are done; in the former case, just note that:    [    frac{x^q + y^q}{x + y} = x^{q-1} - x^{q-2}y + dots - xy^{q-2} + y^{q-1}    ]    is odd since it is the sum of an odd number of odd numbers. So indeed ( p ) exists and is odd.    Now we have to show that ( p ) satisfies the other condition, i.e., ( p nmid a, b ). First note that since ( x ) and ( y ) are coprime, we have ( p nmid x, y ) and so ( p mid a, b iff p mid d ). Now note that since ( q ) is odd, we have that:    [    p mid x^q + y^q Rightarrow (-xy^{-1})^q equiv 1 pmod{p}    ]    where ( y^{-1} ) denotes the multiplicative inverse of ( y ) modulo ( p ). Then let ( k ) denote the order of ( -xy^{-1} ) modulo ( p ). By the above congruence, we have that ( k mid q ) and since ( q ) is prime, it follows that ( k = q ) or ( k = 1 ). If the former case happens, then we have that ( p - 1 ge k = q ) which implies that ( p nmid d ) by the choice of ( q ) (we have selected ( q ) so that it is greater than all divisors of ( d )), hence ( p nmid a, b ) and we are done. In the latter case, we have that ( p mid x + y ); hence by LTE we have:    [    v_pleft(frac{x^q + y^q}{x + y}right) = v_p(q)    ]    Since ( p ) divides the above number by definition, we must have that ( v_p(q) ge 1 ), i.e., ( p = q ). Then ( q mid x + y mid a + b ) which is an absurdity since we have chosen ( q > a + b ). So the lemma is proven. (blacksquare) 3. From the **Claim** and the **Lemma**, it follows that we must have ( a = b ) and the condition becomes ( 2a^n ) is an ( n+1 ) power for all ( n ). We claim that ( a ) must be ( 2 ). Indeed, let ( l = v_2(a) ), then the problem's condition becomes ( n + 1 mid 1 + nl ) for all positive integers ( n ). This is equivalent to ( n + 1 mid l - 1 ) for all positive integers ( n ), which can only happen if ( l - 1 = 0 ) (since ( l ) is fixed and ( n ) can be arbitrarily large), i.e., ( l = 1 ). 4. Now let ( p ) be any odd prime, then the condition implies ( n + 1 mid nv_p(a) ) for all positive integers ( n ); since ( n + 1 ) and ( n ) are coprime, this is equivalent to ( n + 1 mid v_p(a) ) for all positive integers ( n ), which similarly implies ( v_p(a) = 0 ). Then we have that ( v_2(a) = 1 ) and ( v_p(a) = 0 ) for all odd primes ( p ), i.e., ( a = 2 ). Clearly, ( (2, 2) ) satisfies the problem's condition and so we are done.

Extending to (K_5), by ensuring that certain edges are of the same color without sharing vertices we get (n=5).     end{itemize} 2. **Generalizing the Pattern:**     Let's show for any positive integer (m), the smallest (n) such that there are (m) monochromatic edges without common endpoints, is given by:     [     n = 3m - 1     ]     We can use an induction argument to validate this. 3. **Base Cases:**     begin{itemize}         item For (m=1), (n=2). This meets our requirement because the only edge is automatically monochromatic.         item For (m=2), (n=5).

Consider (K_{3r+2}). There are two cases to evaluate:     begin{itemize}         item If all edges in (K_{3r+2}) are the same color, we automatically have (r+1) such monochromatic edges, meeting our condition.         item Otherwise, there exists a vertex which is connected to edges of different colors. Remove the blue and red edges sharing this vertex, leaving us with two separate smaller complete graphs. By the hypothesis in these smaller graphs, (K_{3r-1}) contains (r) monochromatic edges, and thus the inclusion of another edge will result in (r+1) monochromatic edges in total.     end{itemize} 6. **Additional Validation:**     Consider dividing (K_{3r+1}) into two groups (A) (with (r) vertices) and (B) (with (2r+1) vertices). Suppose all edges inside group (B) are red, and edges connecting (A) and (B) are blue.

We are also given that the interest amounted to Rs. 8600 less than the sum lent after 8 years. This means that the total amount (sum lent plus interest) after 8 years is P + I, and I = P - 8600. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount) r = the annual interest rate (decimal) n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for We can rearrange the formula to solve for P: P = A / (1 + r/n)^(nt) We know that A = P + I and I = P - 8600, so we can substitute I with P - 8600: P + (P - 8600) = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Now we can plug in the values we know: r = 0.0625 (6.25% annual interest rate) n = 4 (compounded quarterly) t = 8 (years) P + (P - 8600) = P(1 + 0.0625/4)^(4*8) Simplifying the right side of the equation: P + (P - 8600) = P(1 + 0.015625)^(32) Now we can solve for P: 2P - 8600 = P(1 + 0.015625)^(32) 2P - P(1 + 0.015625)^(32) = 8600 P(2 - (1 + 0.015625)^(32)) = 8600 P = 8600 / (2 - (1 + 0.015625)^(32)) Now we need to calculate (1 + 0.015625)^(32): (1 + 0.015625)^(32) ≈ 1.015625^32 ≈ 1.677097 Now we can plug this value back into the equation for P: P = 8600 / (2 - 1.677097) P = 8600 / (0.322903) P ≈ 8600 / 0.322903 P ≈ 26635.94 Therefore, the sum lent was approximately Rs. boxed{26635.94} ."},{"instruction":"What is the sum of all twodigit positive integers whose squares end with the digits 25?","output":"If n is a two-digit number, we can express n as 10a + b, where a and b are digits.

What are its possible positions?","output":"1. **Initial Condition:**    Initially, all lamps on the 5 times 5 grid are turned off. 2. **Operation Description:**    When Martin activates any lamp, the state of that lamp and its neighboring lamps (those adjacent by a side) change. Specifically, an off lamp turns on, and an on lamp turns off. 3. **Parity Invariance:**    If we consider that the initial state has all lamps off, the initial number of lamps in the \\"on\\" state is zero, which is an even number.        Let's denote the number of lamps that are on at any given point as N. We need to observe the parity (even or odd nature) of N as lamps are toggled. Each toggle involves a change in state of the lamp and its adjacent ones, meaning each activation affects multiple lamps. 4. **Examining the Change in Parity:**    Activating a lamp changes the state of it and its neighbors:    - Activating a single lamp at position (i, j) changes the state of up to 5 lamps (the lamp itself and its 4 neighbors).    - If an inner lamp (not on the edge) is toggled, exactly 5 lamps are influenced.    - For each activation, since toggling a lamp and four neighbors (5 lamps in total) switches their state, the number of lamps that toggle from off to on (or vice versa) remains odd (odd number of switches means the parity of \\"on\\" lamps flips). 5. **Possible Positions for One Lamp On:**    Given that starting from an even number (zero), each move toggles an odd number of lamps, the parity changes with each move. Thus, ending with exactly one lamp on (an odd number of 'on' lamps), requires that after a sequence of such moves, all other lamps are turned off. 6. **Central and Near-Central Positions:**    Considering the symmetry and behavior of the toggling operation:    - One scenario: activating the lamps in a cross (plus shape) around the center (meaning the 13 times activation total leaving the center lit).      ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_346641170ac76390eef3g-222.jpg?height=456&width=1698&top_left_y=614&top_left_x=177)    - Positions directly adjacent to central row/column (activating corresponding figures demonstrate similar behavior). 7. **Symmetrical Consistency:**    As the grid is symmetric by 90-degree rotations, the possible positions that lead to only one lamp being on are those central and ones directly diagonal or adjacent to the corners. # Conclusion: The positions where a single lamp can be lit at the end are: - The center of the grid (3, 3), - The four positions (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4).

We need to prove that there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in this graph that consists of at most two monochromatic parts.  Inductive Proof We will prove the result using mathematical induction. 1. **Base Case**:     - For a complete graph with ( n = 3 ) vertices (a triangle), the statement is trivially true. Any cycle in this graph already satisfies the condition, as we can just select any one of the edges to form the required cycle. 2. **Inductive Step**:     - Suppose the statement is true for a complete graph with ( n ) vertices. We will show that it holds for a complete graph with ( n + 1 ) vertices.     - Consider a complete graph ( K_{n+1} ) with ( n + 1 ) vertices. Remove one vertex, say ( M ), and the edges incident to it. The remaining graph is a complete graph ( K_n ) with ( n ) vertices.     - By the induction hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in this ( K_n ) graph that contains at most two monochromatic parts. Denote this Hamiltonian cycle by ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ). We will consider two cases based on the coloring of the edges in the cycle: # Case 1: **All edges of the cycle are of the same color**:    - Without loss of generality, assume all edges of the cycle are red. Removing the edge ( A_1A_2 ) and adding the vertex ( M ) by connecting ( M ) to both ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) using the edges ( MA_1 ) and ( MA_2 ).    - The resulting path ( A_1MA_2A_3 ldots A_n ) forms a new cycle. Since ( K_{n+1} ) is complete, ( MA_1 ) and ( MA_2 ) exist. This construction ensures that the cycle still fulfills the requirement of containing at most two monochromatic parts. # Case 2: **The cycle contains edges of both colors**:    - Suppose the cycle is divided into two monochromatic parts: a red segment ( A_1A_2 ldots A_m ) and a blue segment ( A_mA_{m+1} ldots A_1 ).    - Examine the edges ( MA_m ) (the edge from ( M ) to ( A_m )). There are two subcases to consider:         - If ( MA_m ) is red, the complete cycle ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_m, M, A_{m+1}, ldots, A_1 ) is valid, where only one color change happens between red and blue segments.         - If ( MA_m ) is blue, consider the cycle formed by ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{m-1}, M, A_m, A_{m+1}, ldots, A_1 ). This also consists of two monochromatic parts (red and blue). In both cases, we achieve a Hamiltonian cycle in the ( K_{n+1} ) graph that satisfies the required condition of having at most two monochromatic segments. # Conclusion: By induction, the statement is proven for any complete graph ( K_n ). There always exists a Hamiltonian cycle consisting of no more than two monochromatic parts.

(II) If line l passes through the incenter of triangle ABC (say D) and intersects the locus of point P at exactly 3 points, find the possible values of the slope k of line l.  (I) Finding the Equation of the Locus of Point P 1. Determine the equations of the lines AB, AC, and BC:    - For line AB: The slope of AB is frac{frac{4}{3} - 0}{0 - (-1)} = frac{4}{3}. Therefore, the equation is y = frac{4}{3}(x + 1).    - For line AC: The slope of AC is frac{frac{4}{3} - 0}{0 - 1} = -frac{4}{3}. Therefore, the equation is y = -frac{4}{3}(x - 1).    - For line BC: This line is along the x-axis, so the equation is y = 0. 2. Calculate the distances from point P(x, y) to lines AB, AC, and BC:    - Distance to AB:       [      d_1 = frac{|4x - 3y + 4|}{5}      ]    - Distance to AC:      [      d_2 = frac{|4x + 3y - 4|}{5}      ]    - Distance to BC:      [      d_3 = |y|      ] 3.

Identify the incenter D of triangle ABC. The distances from D to AB, AC, and BC are equal, implying d_1 = d_2 = d_3. Using the distance formula:    [    d_1 = d_2 = d_3 = |y| = frac{1}{5}|4x - 3y + 4| = frac{1}{5}|4x + 3y - 4|    ]    Solving for D, we find:    [    Dleft(0, frac{1}{2}right)    ] 2.

According to the problem, when T is divided by 12 and 18, there is a remainder of 3 in both cases. This means that T can be expressed as: T = 12k + 3 = 18m + 3 where k and m are integers. Since 12 = 2^2 * 3 and 18 = 2 * 3^2, the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 18 is 2^2 * 3^2 = 36. Therefore, T must be 3 more than a multiple of 36.

Now, we want to find the minimum number of toys to be added to T so that when they are grouped into 7, no toys will remain ungrouped.

We need to demonstrate that the line s (formed by the intersection of planes alpha and beta) is parallel to both lines a and b. 4. Recall that if two planes intersect, their intersection is a line that lies in both planes. Thus, since a subset alpha and s subset alpha, and b subset beta and s subset beta, we analyze the parallelism. 5. Since the line a is parallel to the line b, it implies that there exists a direction vector mathbf{d} such that both a and b are along mathbf{d}, i.e., they have the same direction.

This implies both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) are equal polynomials with 2016 roots each corresponding to x = 1, 2, ldots, 2016 respectively. 2. **Remove Factors to Break Equality:**    To ensure the equation has no real solutions, we need to eliminate enough factors to break the equality. Both sides initially have identical sets of roots. 3. **Ensuring at Least One Factor Remains:**    After removing factors, it is critical to have at least one non-zero factor on both sides of the equation, otherwise, we would end up with 0 = 0 which is always true and would not help in breaking equality. 4. **Disrupting the Equation:**    We need to strategically remove factors such that the resulting polynomials no longer share any common roots. If we erase fewer than 2016 factors, some roots will still be matched between LHS and RHS. 5. **Calculating Minimum k:**    - Each polynomial side has 2016 factors. To ensure no real solutions remain, we need to eliminate enough factors to avoid shared roots completely.    - If we remove 1008 factors from LHS and 1008 from RHS:      - Both remaining polynomials will have 1008 factors each.      - We must guarantee that these remaining factors do not overlap in values (roots). 6. **Verification:**    - Removing 1008 specific factors from both sides leaves 1008 factors on each side.    - For instance, you can remove factors (x-1) to (x-1008) from LHS, and (x-1009) to (x-2016) from RHS (or vice versa), ensuring no overlapping roots. Therefore, the minimum number k that we need to erase to ensure the modified equation has no real solutions is: boxed{2016} Here, 1008 factors from one side and 1008 from the other side combine to make the total minimum required k = 2016."},{"instruction":"Let us call a real number  r  *interesting*, if  r = a + bsqrt2  for some integers a and b.

Therefore, we have:    [    s = frac{a + b + c}{2} = 21 implies a + b + c = 42    ] 3. Substituting (c = a + b - 12) into the equation (a + b + c = 42), we get:    [    a + b + (a + b - 12) = 42 implies 2a + 2b - 12 = 42 implies 2a + 2b = 54 implies a + b = 27    ] 4.

The first image plane angle of line (a) corresponds to one of the acute angles of the triangle (S_1 S_2 S_2'). Let's denote this angle as (angle S_1 S_2 S_2'). 5. Similarly, the second image plane angle of line (b) corresponds to one of the acute angles of the triangle (S_2 S_1 S_1'). Let's denote this angle as (angle S_2 S_1 S_1'). 6. Due to the problem's conditions (i.e., (a'' parallel b') and (a' parallel b'')), the triangles (S_1 S_2 S_2') and (S_2 S_1 S_1') are congruent. This congruence follows from SAS (side-angle-side) congruence theorem as (overline{S_2 S_1}) is taken as equal and the angles adjacent to these sides are acute. 7. Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding angles of these triangles are equal. This means (angle S_1 S_2 S_2' = angle S_2 S_1 S_1'). 8. Consequently, the opposite image plane angles of lines (a) and (b) are equal, meaning the spatial orientation concerning the image planes of (triangle S_1 S_2 S_2') and (triangle S_2 S_1 S_1') are symmetrical due to the congruence property.

Conway’s notations for variables ( S_A, S_B, S_C ) are used:    - ( S_A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2} )    - ( S_B = frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2} )    - ( S_C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2} ) 3. **Calculating Coordinates of ( E ) and ( F )**:        Using the fact that ( E ) lies on the extended angle bisector and is constrained by ( B )-altitude:    [    E = (c S_C, -b S_A, c S_A)    ]        Similarly, for ( F ):    [    F = (b S_B, b S_A, -c S_A)    ] 4. **Intersection ( Z )**:        Finding intersection ( Z ) by solving for both lines:    [    Z = ( -bc S_B S_C, b^2 S_A S_B, c^2 S_A S_C)    ] 5. **Coordinates of Intermediate Points ( X ) and ( Y )**:        - For ( X ) in terms of ( ( E B ) ) and circumcircle ( ( A B C ) ):      [      X = left( S_C left( a^2 S_A + c^2 S_C right), -b^2 S_A S_C, S_A left( a^2 S_A + c^2 S_C right) right)      ]        - For ( Y ) in terms of ( ( C F ) ) and the circumcircle ( ( A B C ) ):      [      Y = left( S_B left( a^2 S_A + b^2 S_B right), S_A left( a^2 S_A + b^2 S_B right), -c^2 S_A S_B right)      ] 6. **Circle Equation and Radical Axis Calculation**:    - Using the above coordinates to verify the conditions of the radical axis equating coefficients leading to:      [      V_B - V_C quad text{and} quad W_B - W_C      ]        Where detailed steps give:    [    left( V_B - V_C right) b^2 S_B + left( W_B - W_C right) c^2 S_C = 0    ] **Conclusion**: Since the calculations confirm that ( Z ) satisfies the radical axis property, we conclude that points ( E, M, N, ) and ( F ) are concyclic as required.

We start by analyzing the given condition:    [    left[frac{a_m}{a_n}right] = left[frac{m}{n}right]    ]    for any positive integers ( m ) and ( n ). Here, ([r]) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to ( r ). 2. We claim that the only such sequences are ( a_i = ki ) for some fixed positive integer ( k ). To verify this, we first observe that if ( a_i = ki ), then:    [    frac{a_m}{a_n} = frac{km}{kn} = frac{m}{n}    ]    and thus:    [    left[frac{a_m}{a_n}right] = left[frac{m}{n}right]    ]    which satisfies the given condition. 3. Next, we need to show that these are the only sequences that satisfy the condition. Fix any positive integer ( n ) and choose a positive integer ( N ). We have:    [    0 leq left|frac{a_N}{a_n} - frac{N}{n}right| < 1    ]    This inequality follows from the fact that the floor function ([x]) is the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x ). 4.

Taking the limit as ( N to infty ), the term ( frac{a_n}{N} ) approaches 0. Therefore, we have:    [    lim_{N to infty} left|frac{a_N}{N} - frac{a_n}{n}right| = 0    ]    which implies:    [    lim_{N to infty} frac{a_N}{N} = frac{a_n}{n}    ] 6.

Then:    [    a_n = kn    ]    for all positive integers ( n ). 7. Therefore, the only sequences that satisfy the given condition are of the form ( a_i = ki ) for some fixed positive integer ( k ).

So, we get [ f(1) = 0 ] and [ fleft(frac{1}{4}right) = 4 ]. (2) To prove this property, let's consider 0 < a < 1, as any positive real number can be represented as a^m where m is a real number. Since x, y > 0, there exist m, n such that x = a^m and y = a^n.

For this inequality to hold in the given interval, we need x - 3a > 0 and x - a > 0, which is satisfied in the interval. Simplify a + 2 -3a > 0 and a + 2 - a > 0 to get 0 < a < 1. From log_a(x - 3a) - 1 > 0, we get x - 3a < a. For all x in the interval, we then have a + frac{9}{4} < 4a, which simplifies to a > frac{3}{4}. For -log_a(sqrt{x - a})>0, we get x - a > 1, which always holds true within the interval. Using (2), we have f(1) = fleft(frac{1}{4}right) + f(4), and we can use this to assert that f(4) = -4.

Conclusion: [ boxed{r = 4} ]  Part (c) As in Solution 1 for part (b), (triangle SBP) is similar to (triangle DSQ) and (SP = SQ). Therefore:  [ frac{SP}{BP} = frac{DQ}{SQ} ] Thus: [ frac{SP}{1} = frac{r}{SP} ] Which gives:  [ SP^2 = r ] And hence, [ SP = sqrt{r} ] Therefore, (SP = SQ = SC = sqrt{r}). Next, (triangle APB) is similar to (triangle AQD) (common angle at (A), right angle): 1. Therefore:      [    frac{AB}{BP} = frac{AD}{DQ}    ]    And so:      [    frac{AB}{1} = frac{AB + BD}{r}    ] 2. Re-arranging gives:      [    r AB = AB + 1 + r    ] 3. And so:      [    (r-1) AB = r + 1    ] 4. Therefore:       [    AB = frac{r + 1}{r - 1}    ] This means that: [ AC = AB + BC = AB + 1 = frac{r + 1}{r - 1} + 1 = frac{(r + 1) + (r - 1)}{r - 1} = frac{2r}{r - 1} ] Next, draw the circle with centre (O) that passes through (A), (S), and (T), and through point (V) on the circle with centre (D) so that (OV) is perpendicular to (DV).

The profit made after applying the discount is the discounted selling price minus the cost price, which can be expressed as 5(1 - frac{x}{100}) - 4 yuan. To ensure a minimum profit margin of 10% on the cost price, the profit must be at least 10% of the cost price, which is 4 times 10% = 0.4 yuan.

The equation can then be simplified to finding n such that the units digit of 6n is 1. In other words, we need to find the units digit of n that makes 6n have a units digit of 1.  The computation for this is straightforward: - Multiplying 6 times 7 = 42, which has a units digit of 2. - Multiplying 6 times 2 = 12, which has a units digit of 2. - Multiplying 6 times 3 = 18, which has a units digit of 8. - Multiplying 6 times 4 = 24, which has a units digit of 4. - Multiplying 6 times 5 = 30, which has a units digit of 0. - Multiplying 6 times 6 = 36, which has a units digit of 6. - Multiplying 6 times 7 = 42, which has a units digit of 2. - Multiplying 6 times 8 = 48, which has a units digit of 8. - Multiplying 6 times 9 = 54, which has a units digit of 4. - Multiplying 6 times 0 = 0, which has a units digit of 0. - Multiplying 6 times 1 = 6, which has a units digit of 6. - Multiplying 6 times 2 = 12, which has a units digit of 2.

She cannot look back to (0,0,0,0) until she has visited all other 14 vertices. The path can now be designed to traverse all other vertices exactly once. 4. **Using symmetry and restrictions**: The choices at each subsequent vertex, with similar restrictions as a cube, are limited to ensure Jamie does not prematurely traverse back to her starting vertex. After each move, Jamie needs to move in dimensions that leave unvisited vertices available. 5. **Complete the chosen path**: Continue selecting edges ensuring no vertex is revisited. Due to the high number of vertices, and pathways, Jamie eventually reaches the last vertex (1,1,1,1) which does not have a direct edge back to the starting point. 6. **Calculation of possible paths**: Since Jamie can start from any of the 16 vertices and 4 initial moves, there are 16 * 4 initial paths.

Hence,     {sqrt{a}}^k = (sqrt{a} - c)^k = x_k + y_k sqrt{a}.  3.

Let us consider a convex polygon (M) which can be divided into smaller polygons, each having a center of symmetry.     2. For the given convex polygon (M), let's examine the edges and vertices.  3. According to the hypothesis, each smaller polygon (from the division of (M)) is centrally symmetric.     4. We need to show that (M) itself must have a center of symmetry if each of its parts does. 5. Let's fix one side (AB) of polygon (M) and investigate the neighboring polygons sharing side (AB). 6. By symmetry of the smaller polygons, (AB) needs to be matched by another segment. Thus, for a centrally symmetric polygon, there must be an equivalent and parallel segment (A'B'). 7. If we continue to look at the next set of neighboring polygons, each one of these will also contribute new segments parallel and congruent to (AB). By this logic, each side of the original convex polygon (M) must have a matching side in terms of length and parallelism. 8. Because the polygon (M) is convex, by this iterative argument, each of its sides will have an equal and parallel counterpart, ensuring that the entire polygon has bilateral symmetry across a central point. 9. By definition, if all sides of a polygon have this matching property and symmetry, then this polygon itself must have a center of symmetry. Thus, if a convex polygon can be divided into smaller centrally symmetric polygons, then the original polygon (M) itself is centrally symmetric. This proves the assertion for convex polygons. Now, let's consider whether this assertion holds for non-convex polygons. 10. In the case of non-convex polygons, the situation is more complicated. A non-convex polygon can have internal angles greater than (180) degrees, and its shape can be irregular in ways that violate the conditions required for having a single central symmetry. 11. For instance, consider a non-convex polygon that is divided into centrally symmetric polygons. In such a case, it is possible to have a configuration like the one depicted below (refer to Chart 220, part b in the problem statement). 12. This non-convex polygon does not have the requisite matching side pairs or the structural properties needed for a unified center of symmetry. Essentially, having centrally symmetric parts does not guarantee the overall non-convex shape will respect the same symmetry due to irregularities and the nature of concavities. Thus, the proposition does not hold for non-convex polygons.

This implies sqrt{a} < sqrt{b}, leading to a < b. Squaring both sides, we get a^{2} < b^{2}, not a^{2} > b^{2}. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **Option B: frac{b}{{a+b}}+frac{a}{{2b}}≥frac{{2sqrt{2}-1}}{2}** We rewrite the left-hand side as frac{b}{{a+b}}+frac{a}{{2b}}=frac{b}{{a+b}}+frac{{a+b}}{{2b}}-frac{1}{2}. Applying the AM-GM inequality, we have frac{b}{{a+b}}+frac{{a+b}}{{2b}} geq 2sqrt{frac{b}{{a+b}}cdotfrac{{a+b}}{{2b}}}.

Since a < b, we have a-b < 0, and thus frac{{a-b}}{{a(a+1)}} < 0.

After selling all the units of both items at their respective discounted prices, what is the overall profit percentage made by the merchant?","output":"First, let's calculate the selling price for each unit of Item A and Item B after the markup and discount. For Item A: - The markup on the cost price is 60%, so the marked price is 10 + (60/100) * 10 = 10 + 6 = 16. - The discount on the marked price is 20%, so the discount amount is (20/100) * 16 = 3.20. - The selling price after the discount is 16 - 3.20 = 12.80. For Item B: - The markup on the cost price is 80%, so the marked price is 18 + (80/100) * 18 = 18 + 14.40 = 32.40. - The discount on the marked price is 10%, so the discount amount is (10/100) * 32.40 = 3.24. - The selling price after the discount is 32.40 - 3.24 = 29.16. Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all units of both items. Total revenue from Item A = 30 units * 12.80/unit = 384. Total revenue from Item B = 20 units * 29.16/unit = 583.20. Total revenue from both items = 384 + 583.20 = 967.20. Next, let's calculate the total cost price for all units of both items. Total cost for Item A = 30 units * 10/unit = 300. Total cost for Item B = 20 units * 18/unit = 360. Total cost for both items = 300 + 360 = 660. Now, let's calculate the profit. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = 967.20 - 660 = 307.20. Finally, let's calculate the overall profit percentage. Profit percentage = (Profit / Total cost) * 100 = (307.20 / 660) * 100 ≈ 46.55%.

These vectors can form a non-convex quadrilateral. 2. These vectors can form a self-intersecting quadrilateral.

Part (a): Non-Convex Quadrilateral 1. **Reference to Previous Problem**:    According to problem 13.7, we know that from these vectors, we can form a convex quadrilateral. These are vectors of fixed length whose sum is zero, so they lie in a plane. Let’s consider that we rearrange the vectors to form a closed shape. Since (vec{a_1} + vec{a_2} + vec{a_3} + vec{a_4} = 0), placing ( vec{a_1} ) at the origin and subsequent vectors head-to-tail results in a quadrilateral that closes at the origin, giving a closed loop, hence a quadrilateral. 2. **Arranging Vectors**:    Placing vectors head-to-tail:    [    vec{a_1} to vec{a_1} + vec{a_2} to vec{a_1} + vec{a_2} + vec{a_3} to vec{a_1} + vec{a_2} + vec{a_3} + vec{a_4} = 0    ]     3. **Forming the Quadrilateral**:    We can change the order of the vectors and find that a different sequence will form a closed loop that forms a non-convex quadrilateral as shown in **Figure 13.1(a)**.  Part (b): Self-Intersecting Quadrilateral 1. **Self-Intersection**:    By selecting vectors and their sequences differently, or placing vectors head-to-tail in alternating directions, we get a self-intersecting quadrilateral. This occurs because any four vectors in a plane whose sum equals zero can be arranged to cross each other at exactly one point (since pairs will inevitably cross when summed in planar Euclidean space). 2. **Visualization**:    Drawing them suitably with ( vec{a_1} + vec{a_2} ), and (vec{a_3} + vec{a_4}) with varying directions, these vectors will intersect at a point inside the quadrilateral forming a self-intersecting quadrilateral as shown in **Figure 13.1(b)**. # Conclusion: Therefore: - It is possible to arrange the given vectors to form a non-convex quadrilateral. - It is also possible to arrange them to form a self-intersecting quadrilateral, visualization and verification via proper vector arrangement reinforce this.

The slopes of the medians to these midpoints are: - For the median to (a, b+c): slope =frac{c}{-d} - For the median to (a-d, b): slope =frac{2c}{d} - By the property, frac{2c}{d} = 4left(frac{c}{-d}right) Rightarrow frac{2c}{d} = -4left(frac{c}{d}right), which simplifies to frac{2c}{d} = -4left(frac{c}{d}right).

Since the graph G is determined uniquely by the partition of the point set P, let us denote this partition as X_1, X_2, ldots, X_{83} where X_i represents the set of points in the i-th group for i = 1, 2, ldots, 83. Also, let left|X_iright| = x_i where x_i is the number of points in X_i.  2. Given, x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_{83} = 1994. We want to determine the minimum value of m(G), where m(G) denotes the number of triangles formed by the vertices in P. According to the problem, m_0 is the minimum value of m(G). 3. The number of possible triangles within the i-th group X_i can be calculated as  binom{x_i}{3}. Therefore, [ m_0 = sum_{i=1}^{83} binom{x_i}{3} ] 4. Let's consider a scenario where there exists i and j such that |x_i - x_j| geq 2. Without loss of generality, assume x_i > x_j, and construct a new partition Y_1, Y_2, ldots, Y_{83} where the sizes of the groups are given by: [ y_k =  begin{cases}  x_k & text{if } k neq i text{ and } k neq j  x_i - 1 & text{if } k = i  x_j + 1 & text{if } k = j  end{cases} ] 5. In this new partition, the total number of points remains 1994, and a new graph G' obtained from this partition has: [ m(G') = sum_{k=1}^{83} binom{y_k}{3} ] 6.

Therefore, the difference in the size of any two groups cannot exceed 1. Consequently, to minimize m(G), the groups should be approximately the same size. 7. Given 1994 = 83 times 24 + 2, we can have 81 groups of 24 points and 2 groups of 25 points. Therefore, [ m_0 = 81 binom{24}{3} + 2 binom{25}{3} ] 8. Calculate each term: [ binom{24}{3} = frac{24 times 23 times 22}{6} = 2024 ] [ binom{25}{3} = frac{25 times 24 times 23}{6} = 2300 ] Thus, [ m_0 = 81 times 2024 + 2 times 2300 = 168544 ] [ boxed{m_0 = 168544} ] 9. For the second part, we need to prove that there exists a coloring of the edges of G^* (the graph that achieves m_0 triangles) with 4 different colors such that no triangle is monochromatic. 10. Consider the groups X_1, X_2, ldots, X_{83}. To create G^* exactly, let's assume the structure involves either 24 points in one group or 25 in another. 11. We will use a known result from graph theory (also related to Turán's theorem) which states a graph whose edges are colored with 4 colors can avoid monochromatic triangles if the graph is appropriately balanced. 12. Construct each graph G_i^* corresponding to group X_i:    - If X_i has 25 points, partition X_i into 5 disjoint subsets of 5.    - Color the edges within each subset of size 5 with the same color and assign each subset a different color. This results in no monochromatic triangle within the subsets.     13. Repeat this division for all other 83 subsets in a similar manner:    - For the subsets of size 24, add one point temporarily to make it 25, and color the edges as above. Then, remove the extra point and its associated edges after coloring. 14. After coloring all subsets, it ensures no monochromatic triangle exists within or across the groups, completing the proof.

Prove that AM is the angle bisector of angle BAC.","output":"To solve the given problem, we will use the information about the geometry of the rectangle and employ certain properties of circles and isosceles triangles. Let's go step-by-step through the reference solution: 1. **Identifying Properties of Triangle ( triangle BDK )**:        - Given that ( A B C D ) is a rectangle, ( D K ) is laid on ( DC ) such that ( DK = DB ). This makes ( triangle BDK ) isosceles with ( DB = DK ).    - For any isosceles triangle, the median drawn to the base is also the altitude and the angle bisector. Therefore, the median ( DM ) is the angle bisector of ( angle BDK ). 2. **Circle and Inscribed Angles Observations**:    - Consider a circle with ( BD ) as the diameter. Points ( B, M, C ), and ( A ) lie on this circle because the angles subtended by the diameter (( angle BMD, angle BCD, angle BAD )) are right angles.    - Since ( angle BMD ), ( angle BCD ), and ( angle BAD ) all subtend the same arc, the inscribed angles ( angle BAM ) and ( angle BDM ) are equal.    - Similarly, the inscribed angles ( angle MAC ) and ( angle MDC ) are equal. 3. **Angle Equivalence and Bisector Confidence**:    - From the properties of inscribed angles and previous steps, we conclude ( angle BAM = angle BDM ) and ( angle MAC = angle MDC ).    - Also, in ( triangle BDK ), ( angle BDM = angle MDC ), because ( DM ) is the angle bisector of ( angle BDK ).    - Hence, ( angle BAM = angle MAC ), confirming ( AM ) is the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ). Conclusively ( boxed{AM} ) is the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ). 4. **Verification Using Coordinate Geometry and Reflection**:    - Let midpoint ( O ) be the origin (intersection of diagonals of the rectangle).    - ( M ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( BC ), halfway between ( B ) and ( K ), where ( K ) is reflection of ( D ) over ( BC ).    - ( OM ) is parallel to ( DK ) and is thus perpendicular to ( BC ), making ( M ) the midpoint along ( DK ).    - Since ( M ) is equidistant from sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) due to symmetry properties of ( triangle ABD ) reflected over ( AD ), ( M ) inherently lies on the bisector of ( angle BAC ). Therefore, ( AM ) indeed serves as the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ), providing consistency through geometric reflection and position properties, verifying the correctness of the proof. boxed{AM}"},{"instruction":"Given a triangular pyramid PABC with its three side edges PA, PB, PC being mutually perpendicular, and PA=2, PB= sqrt{3}, PC=3, then the surface area of the circumscribed sphere of this pyramid is A: 16pi B: 32pi C: 36pi D: 64pi","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the structural characteristics of a triangular pyramid and the surface area of a sphere.

These conditions can be written as: 1. k = 17a + 1 for some integer a, 2. k = 6b + 1 for some integer b, 3. k = 2c + 1 for some integer c. From these equations, we observe that k-1 must be divisible by 17, 6, and 2. To find the smallest integer k greater than 1 that satisfies these conditions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 17, 6, and 2. This is because k-1 must be a common multiple of these numbers, and we are looking for the smallest such k. We calculate the LCM as follows: - The LCM of 17 and 6 is found by recognizing that 17 and 6 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), so their LCM is simply their product: 17 times 6 = 102. - Since 2 is a factor of 6, the LCM of 17, 6, and 2 remains 102 because including 2 does not change the LCM already calculated with 17 and 6. Therefore, the smallest value for k-1 that is divisible by 17, 6, and 2 is 102. To find the corresponding value of k, we add 1 back to this result: k = 102 + 1 = 103.

Here, it's under x^2, so the major axis length is 2sqrt{25}=10.    - The minor axis length is determined by the smaller denominator, which is under y^2, so the minor axis length is 2sqrt{9}=6.    - The eccentricity, e, of an ellipse is given by e=sqrt{1-frac{b^2}{a^2}}, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.

Thus, when xinleft(-infty,0right), g'left(xright) < 0; when xinleft(0,+inftyright), g'left(xright) > 0. Hence, g_{min}=gleft(0right)=1-a. When aleqslant 1, gleft(xright)=f'left(xright)geqslant 0, thus the function fleft(xright) is monotonically increasing and has no extreme points.

Since the function fleft(xright) is also monotonically decreasing on left({x}_{1},0right), we have fleft({x}_{1}right) > fleft(-{x}_{2}right).

Recall that a knight moves in an \\"L\\" shape: either two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular. 2. **Chessboard Pattern**: By coloring the cells in a chessboard pattern, each move of the knight always lands on a cell of the opposite color. Hence, if we follow this strategy, no two unpainted cells will be reachable by one move of the knight. 3. **Shaded Squares Calculation**: To execute the chessboard pattern on a 35x35 grid:     [     N = 35     ]     [     leftlfloor frac{N^2}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{35^2}{2} rightrfloor     ]     [     35^2 = 1225     ]     [     leftlfloor frac{1225}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 612.5 rightrfloor = 612     ] 4. **Coverage by Coloring**: By colouring 612 cells in the chessboard pattern, we ensure no two neighbouring knights can stand on uncolored cells. This is because a knight on a black cell can only move to white cells and vice versa, and since half (rounded down) of the cells are colored, the condition is maintained. 5. **Verification**: Given that this 35x35 grid can be divided into 49 smaller 5x5 grids:     [     frac{35}{5} times frac{35}{5} = 7 times 7 = 49     ]      - Each of these smaller grids can independently follow the same colouring pattern.      - Explicitly, numbering cells in any smaller grid of 5x5 to ensure proper knight's movement coverage proves that no sequence arrangement shorter than 612 cells ensures knights do not access neighbouring cells. 6. **Conclusion**: By systematic and strategic coloring following the chessboard concept and confirming through grid division, the minimal cells required to ensure no knight on a white/unpainted cell can jump to another unpainted one must be:     [     boxed{612}     ]"},{"instruction":"On a balance scale, 4 red balls balance 8 blue balls, 3 orange balls balance 6 blue balls, and 7 blue balls balance 5 purple balls.

The polynomial is given by: [ x^3 + 2(k-1)x^2 + 9x + 5(k-1) = 0. ] It is stated that this polynomial has a set of roots, where one of the roots is a complex root with modulus (sqrt{5}). By the Conjugate Root Theorem, we know that if a polynomial with real coefficients has a complex root (a + bi), its conjugate (a - bi) must also be a root.  Therefore, the roots of the polynomial are: [ a + bi, quad a - bi, quad text{and} quad c, ] where (a, b, text{ and } c in mathbb{R}) and (b neq 0). Furthermore, given that the modulus of the complex roots is (sqrt{5}), we have: [ a^2 + b^2 = 5. ] Next, as the sum of the roots of the polynomial is equal to the coefficient of (x^2) term (with opposite sign), we obtain: [ (a + bi) + (a - bi) + c = -2(k-1). ] Simplifying this, we get: [ 2a + c = -2(k-1). tag{1} ] Using Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the polynomial equals the constant term, divided by the coefficient of (x^3), which gives us: [ (a + bi)(a - bi)c = - 5(k-1), ] Since ((a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2 = 5): [ 5c = 5(k-1) ] Thus, we can simplify this to: [ c = k-1 tag{2} ] The polynomial's coefficients provide another relation where the product of any two roots equals the coefficient of (x)-term, divided by the coefficient of (x^2)-term: [ (a + bi)c + (a - bi)c = 9, ] Substituting (c = k-1): [ (k-1)(a+bi) + (k-1)(a-bi) = 9. ] Since (a+bi) and (a-bi) add up to (2a): [ (k-1)2a = 9 ] [ a = frac{9}{2(k-1)}. tag{3} ] Now, solving for (c) from earlier, we put the expression back in: [  c = frac{1}{2}(1-k). tag{4} ] Finally, we should verify the consistency of our answers: From (2a + c = -2(k-1)): [ a = frac{1}{2}(1-k), ] [ c = 1-k, ] Substituting back, we get two values for (k): Solving these we get: [ (1) rightarrow k = -1, ] [ k = 3. ] Thus, we have: 1.

First, let's calculate the probability of both events A and B occurring, denoted as P(AB). Event A is \\"at least one occurrence of tails\\", and event B is \\"exactly one occurrence of heads\\". The only way both events can occur is when we have one heads and two tails. There are 3 ways this can happen in three tosses (THH, HTH, HHT), so P(AB) = dfrac{3}{2^{3}} = dfrac{3}{8}. 2. Next, we calculate the probability of event A, P(A). Since event A is \\"at least one occurrence of tails\\", its complement is \\"no occurrence of tails\\", which means all three tosses are heads. The probability of this is dfrac{1}{2^{3}} = dfrac{1}{8}. So, P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - dfrac{1}{8} = dfrac{7}{8}. 3.

Determine the minimum costs of the building materials.","output":"Let's start by finding the perimeter of the enclosure. Since it is rectangular, the length and width will be the same as the sides' lengths. Let's assume the length and width of the enclosure are L and W, respectively. The perimeter of the enclosure is given by: 2L + 2W. Since the three sides will be built of redwood fencing, the cost for these sides is: 14/ft * (2L + W). The fourth side will be built of cement blocks, so the cost for this side is: 28/ft * L. The total cost for the materials is given by: (14/ft * (2L + W)) + (28/ft * L). Since we want to minimize the cost, we need to find the values of L and W that minimize the total cost.

At what level of output will average cost per unit be a minimum?","output":"To find the level of output at which the average cost per unit is a minimum, we first need to find the average cost function. The average cost is the total cost divided by the number of units produced. The average cost function is given by: AC(q) = C(q) / q. Substituting the given cost function into the average cost function, we have: AC(q) = (0.05q^2 + 5q + 500) / q. To find the minimum of the average cost per unit, we take the derivative of the average cost function with respect to q and set it equal to zero. d/dq (AC(q)) = d/dq ((0.05q^2 + 5q + 500) / q) = 0. To simplify the calculation, we can multiply both sides of the equation by q to eliminate the denominator: 0.05q^2 + 5q + 500 = 0. Now we have a quadratic equation. To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula: q = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 0.05, b = 5, and c = 500. Plugging these values into the formula, we have: q = (-(5) ± √(5^2 - 4(0.05)(500))) / 2(0.05). Simplifying further: q = (-5 ± √(25 - 100)) / 0.1. q = (-5 ± √(-75)) / 0.1. Since the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real number system, there is no real solution for q. Therefore, there is no level of output at which the average cost per unit is a minimum."},{"instruction":"Advantages of using windows operating system","output":"1.

Conspicuously, the number of this family members has been found to exhibit variation across different species. In current study, 20 AA9 genes were recognized from T. fergusii genome. These AA9 categorized into 3 subgroups, including LPMOs1, LPMOs2, and LPMOs3 which were analogous to the AA9 genes in C. thermophilum and N. crassa genomnes (Galagan et al., 2003; Hegnar et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). The evolutionary relationships among the T. fergusii (TfAA9) and the model organisms C. thermophilum (CtAA9), N. crassa (NcAA9), and T. reesei (TrAA9) were established using a comparative study. The findings demonstrated that TfAA9 shares the same domain composition as the other three model fungi (Figure 1). The evolutionary tree was partitioned into three distinct subgroups, and our findings align with a previously conducted study on AA9 in C. thermophilum (Li et al., 2020). The motif composition analysis also demonstrated that motifs 1–6 were common with highly conserved nature. The functional characterisation of LPMOs AA9 motifs has not been optimised to the present time. Motifs 1, 2, and 7 exhibited an abundance of His residues, whereas Motifs 1, 3, 8, and 12 were characterized by a predominance of Tyrosine residues. Previous research has indicated that these motifs may potentially serve as significant active sites for lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), given the significance of His and Tyr residues in copper (Cu) metal binding sites (Ciano et al., 2018). Moreover, the Conserved domain analysis showed that same AA9 domain was prsented in all 20 TfAA9 genes consistent with the many other fungi (Grieco et al., 2020; Tõlgo et al., 2022). These findings suggest the presence of potential structural diversification within the TfAA9 gene family, which is known to have a significant impact on the evolutionary process of multi-gene families.","output":"In this recent study, the AA9 gene family was investigated in various fungi, revealing variations in the number of family members across different species.

Further optimization of functional characterization for AA9 motifs is needed. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary process and structural characteristics of the TfAA9 gene family."},{"instruction":"The genome of the thermophilic fungus T. fergusii suggested the functional secretomes of this fungi were substrate-dependent, and insoluble substrate avicel were specific for LPMOs AA9 induction. Endoglucanase activity, Cellulase activity, protein concentration and functional secretome analysis indicated that avicel was a good inducer of endoglucanases and cellulases secreted by T. fergusii (Figure 12). Endoglucanase activity results were similar to C. thermophilum but cellulase activity results were different to P. chrysosporium (Li et al., 2020; Machado et al., 2020). The insoluble crystalline substrate avicel specifcally induced the effecient secretion of cellulose-degrading enzymes by T. fergusii, which was similar to the model fungus C. thermophilum and N. crassa (Li et al., 2020; Phillips, Iavarone, & Marletta, 2011). T. fergusii gene expansion probably reflects the adaptability of the fungus to the substrate because a thermophilic fungus genome encodes more LPMOs gene. Compared to the cellobiose a carbon sources, biomass on Avicel was lower, which was similar to the Thielavia terrestris LPH172 and Malbranchea cinnamomea poor growth performance on avicel (Figure 12 B) (Hüttner et al., 2017; Tõlgo et al., 2021). Probably poor growth performance was due to the crystal nature of avicel. Growth discrepancies between the two T. terrestris strains LPH172 and CBS 117535 corroborate previously reported differences in biomass degradation and enzyme production between strains of the same species. This was mainly attributed to the postgenomic and regulatory diferences between strains. Differential gene expression analysis helped to suggest the main enzymes involved in degradation of tested substrates. The range of upregulated LPMOs AA9 genes encoding cellulase was perhaps more diverse than expected on all 3 substrates (Avicel, cellobiose and glucose) but the ratio of up-reugulated gene was more high on avicel (Figure 13). Similarly several AA9 genes of T. terrestris strains LPH172, LPMOs1 genes of C. thermophilum and N. crassa wild type strain genes encoding lignocellulolytic were upregulated on avicel (Li et al., 2020; Tõlgo et al., 2021; Znameroski et al., 2012). Co-regulation of biomass-degrading enzymes could explain the induction of these genes. Enzymological studies that compare the activities and activity optima of these enzymes will help to determine the function of seemingly redundant enzymes such as the abundantly expressed AA9 LPMO genes.","output":"The genome of the thermophilic fungus T. fergusii revealed that its functional secretomes were substrate-dependent, with avicel being a specific inducer for LPMOs AA9.

This substrate specificity in inducing cellulose-degrading enzymes was also observed in C. thermophilum and N. crassa. The expansion of LPMOs genes in T. fergusii likely reflects the adaptability of the fungus to its substrate, as thermophilic fungi genomes tend to encode more LPMOs genes.

Research findings have indicated that these many loops comprise the surface responsible for binding substrates (Figures 2a). The oxidation regioselectivity of a given substrate is attributed to the active site architecture of a LPMO (Vu, Beeson, Phillips, Cate, & Marletta, 2014; Zhou, Qi, Huang, & Zhu, 2019). Another some special feature of LPMOs2 like the serine (S) residue before the H-103 and along with the S-99 another 9-14 aa loop considered to be active sites (Figures 2a and Figure S1). The crystal structures of NCU01050, NCU07898, and Ta_GH61A reveal that the S hydroxyl group is situated on the surface of the active site, potentially facilitating interactions with the cellulose substrate (Vu et al., 2014). The alignment of the aromatic side chain of residue Y24 with the active site surface indicates that Y24 could potentially play a crucial role in the oxidation of C4 by LPMOs3 (Figures 2a) (Vu et al., 2014). By employing structural and sequence alignments, It was successfully discovered the characteristics present on the active site surface that are expected to play a role in precisely adjusting the positioning of the copper active site on the cellulose surface, thereby enabling regioselective hydroxylation (Vu et al., 2014). In the meantime, a considerable multitude of LPMOs sequences exhibiting significant diversity have been discovered. However, the characterization of enzyme activities and structures associated with LPMOs remains limited, impeding our comprehension of the intricate connection between their structural attributes and functional properties. The protein-protein interaction network of a specific gene family serves as empirical support for the interconnections among its constituent proteins. The protein-protein interaction results of TfAA9 proteins exhibited that 12 TfAA9 proteins were homologous with M. thermophila (MtAA9) and displayed strong intearction with each other (Figure 4). A previous study has indicated that the nine MtAA9 genes, that encode LPMOs, play a dynamic role in the auxiliary activity family 9, which is associated with the process of cellulose decomposition (Q. Liu et al., 2019). The findings of this study suggest that the TfAA9 proteins may possess a shared characteristic of cellulose degradation, compared to the MtAA9 proteins..","output":"The catalytic domains of LPMOs exhibit similar β-sandwich core structures, but the loops beyond these structures show significant diversity, which is responsible for substrate binding.

Это создаст анимацию падения снежинок на ель. В данном примере используются простые геометрические формы для снежинок (сферы) и ели (цилиндр и конус для ствола и кроны соответственно). Снег падает равномерно и периодически повторяется. **Замечание**: Для большей реалистичности анимации можно было бы использовать сложные модели и алгоритмы для моделирования движения частиц снега и более детальной модели ели. Также возможно добавление разных эффектов, таких как свет и тени, однако это будет существенно более сложным и может потребовать написания дополнительных функций и рендеринга сцен вне Mathematica."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's what these terms generally mean in this context: 1. **Type Approval:** Before a new model of a weighing instrument is allowed on the market, it needs to go through a type approval process to ensure it complies with the applicable regulations and standards for that type of equipment. This involves testing the instrument to check that it meets the required metrological and technical specifications. 2. **Conformance Assessment:** This is a broader term that includes the process of determining, through evaluation and subsequent decision, whether specified requirements relating to a product, process, system, person, or body have been fulfilled. In the context of weighing systems, this would be the assessment process for verifying that the system conforms to the relevant standards. 3. **Verification:** After type approval and before a weighing instrument can be used in commerce or for legal purposes, it often needs to go through an initial verification process. Verification ensures that an individual instrument operates correctly and within the tolerances set for its class. Afterward, periodic verifications or inspections may be required to maintain the system's certified status. 4. **Certification**: Depending on the jurisdiction, once a weighing system has passed type approval and verification, it might receive a certification, which formally recognizes that the equipment is suitable for its intended use according to the relevant standards. These processes are typically regulated by national or regional standards and are intended to protect consumers and businesses by ensuring the reliability and accuracy of weighing instruments used in trade and certain legal contexts. The specific process and terminology can vary by country or region, so it's important to check with local authorities to determine the exact requirements and procedures."},{"instruction":"写一篇小学生去动物园的游记。","output":"我很兴奋地和同学们一起去了动物园。当我们走进动物园的大门时，一股清新的花草气息扑面而来，令人眼前一亮。 我们首先来到了猴山。哇，那里有各种各样的猴子，它们在树枝间跳来跳去，好像在演杂技表演。有的猴子还会挂在旁边的树枝上“吊死鬼”，真是活泼可爱。 接下来，我们来到了狮虎馆。在那里，我看到了一只巨大的白虎正在悠闲地晒太阳。它身上的花纹很美丽，就像一幅绘画。旁边还有几只雄壮的狮子，它们的威猛模样令人敬畏。 然后，我们来到了鸟类馆。鸟儿们在那里唱歌、跳舞，展示它们的美丽羽毛和优雅动作。有的鸟儿还会和游客互动，展示它们的才艺。我特别喜欢那只彩色羽毛的孔雀，它开屏时简直像一朵美丽的花朵。 接着，我们来到了海洋馆。那里有蓝蓝的海水和各种奇特的海洋生物。我看到了小丑鱼、海龟、鲨鱼等等。它们在水中游动的姿态优美极了，仿佛是在为我们表演水中芭蕾舞。 最后，我们来到了熊猫苑。大熊猫是我最喜欢的动物之一，它们白白胖胖的身体特别可爱。我们看到了一只母熊猫和它的小宝宝在一起玩耍，宝宝的样子简直太逗了，我们都忍不住笑出声来。 整个动物园充满了欢声笑语，我和同学们玩得非常开心。这次去动物园的经历让我更加了解了动物们的生活习性，也让我更加珍惜自然和动物。我决定要保护动物，保护我们美丽的地球！"},{"instruction":"Below is a paragraph from an academic paper.

NVPF@rGO can be obtained at different experimental conditions including microwave hydrothermal temperatures (120-140 ℃), microwave hydrothermal times (0.5-2 h), calcination times (4-10 h), calcination temperatures (500-600 ℃), and rGO addition (8-17%). NVPF nanocuboids with sizes of 50-150 nm are evenly decentralized on the rGO, showing the best electrochemical properties. For example, a high reversible capacity of 123 mAh g-1 with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 84% at 1 C can be obtained. After 7000 cycles, a steady capacity of 107 mAh g-1 with a high capacity conservation rate of 85.6% is attained at 10 C.

The performance of a full battery composed of NVPF@rGO as cathode and hard carbon as anode is also explored. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) reveal that the enhanced reaction kinetics such as small resistance, high pseudocapacitive contribution, and big Na+ diffusion coefficient due to the introducing of rGO are beneficial to the preeminent properties. In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) consequences demonstrate a highly reversible Na+ insertion/extraction mechanism with a low volume change of 3.3% for NVPF@rGO.","output":"In this study, NVPF nanocuboids were prepared by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method with post-calcination, and then coated with rGO.

Endoglucanase activity, Cellulase activity, protein concentration and functional secretome analysis indicated that avicel was a good inducer of endoglucanases and cellulases secreted by T. fergusii (Figure 12). Endoglucanase activity results were similar to C. thermophilum but cellulase activity results were different to P. chrysosporium (Li et al., 2020; Machado et al., 2020). The insoluble crystalline substrate avicel specifcally induced the effecient secretion of cellulose-degrading enzymes by T. fergusii, which was similar to the model fungus C. thermophilum and N. crassa (Li et al., 2020; Phillips, Iavarone, & Marletta, 2011). T. fergusii gene expansion probably reflects the adaptability of the fungus to the substrate because a thermophilic fungus genome encodes more LPMOs gene. Compared to the cellobiose a carbon sources, biomass on Avicel was lower, which was similar to the Thielavia terrestris LPH172 and Malbranchea cinnamomea poor growth performance on avicel (Figure 12 B) (Hüttner et al., 2017; Tõlgo et al., 2021). Probably poor growth performance was due to the crystal nature of avicel. Growth discrepancies between the two T. terrestris strains LPH172 and CBS 117535 corroborate previously reported differences in biomass degradation and enzyme production between strains of the same species. This was mainly attributed to the postgenomic and regulatory diferences between strains. Differential gene expression analysis helped to suggest the main enzymes involved in degradation of tested substrates. The range of upregulated LPMOs AA9 genes encoding cellulase was perhaps more diverse than expected on all 3 substrates (Avicel, cellobiose and glucose) but the ratio of up-reugulated gene was more high on avicel (Figure 13). Similarly several AA9 genes of T. terrestris strains LPH172, LPMOs1 genes of C. thermophilum and N. crassa wild type strain genes encoding lignocellulolytic were upregulated on avicel (Li et al., 2020; Tõlgo et al., 2021; Znameroski et al., 2012). Co-regulation of biomass-degrading enzymes could explain the induction of these genes. Enzymological studies that compare the activities and activity optima of these enzymes will help to determine the function of seemingly redundant enzymes such as the abundantly expressed AA9 LPMO genes","output":"Here's the paraphrased version of the paragraph: According to the genome analysis of T. fergusii, it was found that the functional secretomes of this thermophilic fungus are influenced by the type of substrate, with avicel, an insoluble substrate, specifically inducing the production of LPMOs AA9. Various assessments, including endoglucanase activity, cellulase activity, protein concentration, and functional secretome analysis, demonstrated that avicel effectively induced the secretion of endoglucanases and cellulases by T. fergusii. While the results for endoglucanase activity were similar to those of C. thermophilum, the cellulase activity results differed from those of P. chrysosporium. Similar to the model fungi C. thermophilum and N. crassa, T. fergusii exhibited efficient secretion of cellulose-degrading enzymes when induced by the insoluble substrate avicel. The expansion of genes in T. fergusii may reflect the adaptability of the fungus to the specific substrate, considering that the thermophilic fungus genome encodes more LPMOs genes. Growth on avicel resulted in lower biomass compared to cellobiose as a carbon source, a pattern observed in other fungi such as Thielavia terrestris LPH172 and Malbranchea cinnamomea. This phenomenon may be attributed to the crystal nature of avicel. Differences in growth performance and enzyme production between the two strains of T. terrestris, LPH172 and CBS 117535, have also been reported previously and are likely due to postgenomic and regulatory variations. Differential gene expression analysis provided insights into the key enzymes involved in the degradation of the tested substrates. Interestingly, the range of upregulated LPMOs AA9 genes encoding cellulase appeared to be more diverse on all three substrates (avicel, cellobiose, and glucose), with a higher ratio of upregulated genes observed on avicel. Similarly, several AA9 genes in T. terrestris strains LPH172, LPMOs1 genes in C. thermophilum, and wild type strain genes in N. crassa, all encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes, were upregulated specifically on avicel. It is possible that co-regulation of biomass-degrading enzymes contributes to the induction of these genes. Further enzymological studies comparing the activities and optimal conditions of these enzymes will help determine the functionalities of seemingly redundant enzymes, such as the highly expressed AA9 LPMO genes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Bạn có thể kiểm tra điều này bằng việc đi đến mục Firewall > NAT và đảm bảo rằng có quy tắc tự động \\"Outbound NAT\\" đã được tạo cho mỗi interface. 5. **Cấu hình Firewall Rules:** - Tạo quy tắc lưu lượng trên pfSense để cho phép các thiết bị truy cập Internet. Đi đến mục Firewall > Rules và thêm các quy định cho các interfaces LAN, OPT1 và OPT2. Ví dụ, bạn có thể thêm một quy tắc là cho phép tất cả lưu lượng từ LAN net, OPT1 net và OPT2 net đến bất cứ đâu (any destination). 6. **Kiểm tra Cấu hình:** - Xác nhận rằng các thiết bị trong các mạng nội bộ có thể nhận địa chỉ IP từ DHCP, và có thể truy cập internet thông qua WAN interface. - Thực hiện ping từ các thiết bị trong mạng đến một địa chỉ Internet (ví dụ: google.com) để kiểm tra kết nối. 7. **Debug và Troubleshoot:** - Nếu vẫn gặp vấn đề, bạn cần kiểm tra lại cấu hình và log hệ thống để tìm nguyên nhân. Đôi khi cần kiểm tra cả định tuyến và quy định tường lửa ở cả hai phía (incoming và outgoing).

Trong trường hợp của một gói tin truyền trên mạng, địa chỉ nguồn (source address) sẽ chỉ địa chỉ mạng của thiết bị đã gửi gói tin đó. - Ví dụ, nếu bạn gửi một yêu cầu web từ máy tính của bạn, máy tính đó sẽ là nguồn của yêu cầu đó và địa chỉ IP của máy tính bạn sẽ được dùng làm địa chỉ IP nguồn trong gói tin gửi đi. 2. **Destination (Đích):** - Đích (destination) thì là nơi mà gói tin hoặc dữ liệu được gửi đến. Địa chỉ đích (destination address) trong gói tin chỉ địa chỉ mạng của thiết bị hay dịch vụ dự định nhận gói tin đó. - Theo ví dụ trên, nếu bạn truy cập một trang web, máy chủ web hosting trang đó sẽ là điểm đích cho yêu cầu của bạn và địa chỉ IP của máy chủ đó sẽ được dùng làm địa chỉ IP đích trong các gói tin gửi đến nó. Trong hầu hết các giao thức mạng, mỗi gói tin sẽ chứa cả địa chỉ nguồn và đích. Điều này cho phép các thiết bị mạng như router và switch định tuyến gói tin một cách chính xác từ nguồn đến đích, đồng thời cũng cho phép thiết bị đích biết được nơi mà gói tin đến, từ đó có thể phản hồi lại đúng nguồn gửi nếu cần. Địa chỉ nguồn và đích có thể là địa chỉ IP trong mạng TCP/IP, hoặc có thể là địa chỉ MAC trong phạm vi một mạng LAN cục bộ. Trong lập trình mạng, thông thường, các ứng dụng sẽ lựa chọn cổng nguồn (source port) để gửi dữ liệu và địa chỉ đích cùng cổng đích (destination port) để xác định ứng dụng đích trên thiết bị đích."},{"instruction":"cổng 445 là dịch vụ gì","output":"Cổng 445 là cổng mạng được sử dụng chủ yếu bởi giao thức SMB (Server Message Block) qua TCP/IP trong môi trường Windows để chia sẻ tệp, máy in và cung cấp các dịch vụ thông tin giữa các máy trên mạng. SMB cho phép các hệ thống trên một mạng kết nối với nhau để truy cập và chia sẻ tệp, thư mục và máy in. Trong phiên bản Windows 2000 và các phiên bản sau đó, Microsoft thực hiện một số thay đổi trong cách kết nối SMB hoạt động. Giao thức không còn phụ thuộc vào NetBIOS (dịch vụ cơ bản của các hệ điều hành mạng có thể được truy cập qua cổng 137, 138 và 139) và hoàn toàn chuyển sang sử dụng TCP/IP qua cổng 445 để giao tiếp. Việc này giúp cho việc cấu hình và quản lý mạng trở nên dễ dàng và hiệu quả hơn. Tuy nhiên, cổng 445 cũng nổi tiếng với việc là một vector tấn công phổ biến mà malware và hacker sử dụng để lan truyền trong mạng. Ví dụ, mã độc WannaCry đã tận dụng lỗi trong cách thức Microsoft SMB v1 server xử lý các yêu cầu SMB đặc biệt để thực hiện tấn công ransomware lớn năm 2017. Chính vì lý do bảo mật, trên các hệ thống không sử dụng hoặc không cần đến chia sẻ SMB, nên cân nhắc việc chặn cổng 445 cả từ phía tường lửa hệ thống (firewall) lẫn tường lửa mạng, nhằm giảm thiểu nguy cơ bị tấn công từ bên ngoài hoặc lan truyền mã độc từ bên trong mạng."},{"instruction":"dùng pfsense, cần phải mở protocol gì để có thể truy caaph internet","output":"Để có thể truy cập Internet thông qua pfSense, bạn cần phải đảm bảo rằng những protocol quan trọng sau đây có thể được sử dụng qua tường lửa (firewall) của bạn: 1. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** - Protocol: TCP - Port: 80 - Mục đích: Dùng cho truy cập các trang web không mã hóa. 2. **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** - Protocol: TCP - Port: 443 - Mục đích: Dùng cho truy cập các trang web mã hóa bằng SSL/TLS, và là cách kết nối an toàn phổ biến nhất hiện nay. 3. **DNS (Domain Name System):** - Protocol: UDP (và đôi khi là TCP) - Port: 53 - Mục đích: Dùng để chuyển đổi tên miền (ví dụ: www.google.com) thành địa chỉ IP. 4. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** - Protocol: UDP - Port: 67 và 68 cho máy khách, 67 cho máy chủ - Mục đích: Dùng cho máy khách trong mạng nội bộ để nhận địa chỉ IP và thông tin cấu hình mạng khác từ máy chủ DHCP.

Tuy nhiên, việc giữ máy chủ DHCP được bật có thể hữu ích trong một số trường hợp như: 1. **Thuận tiện khi mở rộng mạng:** Nếu bạn muốn thêm thiết bị mới vào mạng, máy chủ DHCP có thể tự động cấp thông tin cấu hình cần thiết mà không yêu cầu bạn phải thực hiện cấu hình IP tĩnh thủ công. 2. **Thiết bị di động và khách:** Đối với các thiết bị di động hoặc khách thăm, việc bật DHCP sẽ cho phép họ kết nối mạng một cách dễ dàng mà không cần cấu hình tĩnh. 3. **Flexibility (Linh hoạt):** DHCP cho phép bạn thay đổi cấu hình IP một cách trung tâm mà không cần truy cập vào từng thiết bị. Điều này bao gồm việc thay đổi DNS server, gateway mặc định, hoặc khung địa chỉ IP. Nếu bạn quyết định không sử dụng DHCP, hãy đảm bảo rằng: - Mọi thiết bị đều được cấu hình đúng địa chỉ IP tĩnh, subnet mask, gateway, và DNS servers. - Không có xung đột địa chỉ IP trong mạng (tức là không có hai thiết bị nào được cấu hình cùng một địa chỉ IP). Tóm lại, việc bật hay tắt DHCP phụ thuộc vào thiết kế và nhu cầu cụ thể của mạng của bạn.

Here's an example code in Python to calculate force from pressure and area, and draw a graph using the Matplotlib library: \`\`\`python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def calculate_force(pressure, area): return pressure * area def draw_graph(values): plt.plot(values) plt.xlabel('Time') plt.ylabel('Force') plt.title('Force over time') plt.show() # Example sequence of pressure and area values pressures = [5, 10, 15, 20] # in psi areas = [2, 4, 6, 8] # in square inches forces = [] for p, a in zip(pressures, areas): force = calculate_force(p, a) forces.append(force) print(f'Force: {force} Newtons') draw_graph(forces) \`\`\` In this code, the \`calculate_force\` function takes the pressure and area values as parameters and returns the calculated force using the formula \`force = pressure * area\`. The \`draw_graph\` function uses Matplotlib to create a basic line graph of the force values over time. You can modify the \`pressures\` and \`areas\` lists with your actual sequence of pressure and area values. Once you run this code on your Raspberry Pi, it will calculate the forces and print them, and then display a graph showing the force values using the \`draw_graph\` function. Make sure you have the Matplotlib library installed on your Raspberry Pi. If not, you can install it by running \`sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib\` in the terminal. Note: The example code assumes the pressure is in psi and the area is in square inches, but you can adjust it to your specific unit system."},{"instruction":"how to calculate on time values and draw graph according to this values","output":"To calculate and graph values over time, you can modify the previous code as follows: \`\`\`python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def calculate_force(pressure, area): return pressure * area def draw_graph(times, values): plt.plot(times, values) plt.xlabel('Time') plt.ylabel('Force') plt.title('Force over time') plt.show() # Example sequence of pressure and area values pressures = [5, 10, 15, 20] # in psi areas = [2, 4, 6, 8] # in square inches times = [1, 2, 3, 4] # in seconds forces = [] for p, a in zip(pressures, areas): force = calculate_force(p, a) forces.append(force) draw_graph(times, forces) \`\`\` In this updated code, a new list \`times\` is added, which represents the time values corresponding to each pressure and area measurement. The \`draw_graph\` function is modified to take both the \`times\` and \`forces\` lists as inputs. You can adjust the \`times\` list to match the time intervals at which you measured the pressures and areas. For example, if you took measurements every 2 seconds, you can use \`[2, 4, 6, 8]\` as your \`times\` list. When you run this code on your Raspberry Pi, it will calculate the forces based on the given pressures and areas, and then plot a graph showing the force values over time.

It updates the live graph with the latest force values over time. The \`draw_live_graph\` function is similar to the previous \`draw_graph\` function, but now it includes a pause of \`0.01\` seconds to allow for the graph to update progressively. The \`plt.ion()\` call activates interactive mode, and the \`plt.clf()\` command clears the current plot before redrawing it. You can replace the example code for getting live pressure and area values with your actual code to retrieve real-time data from sensors or any other source. When you run this code on your Raspberry Pi, it will continuously update the graph with live force values over time. The program will run indefinitely until stopped manually.

Identify three ethical issues that can arise from an organisation’s use of digital for 3mins presentation","output":"Good evening everyone, today we're going to explore the intersection of technology and ethics, specifically focusing on three key ethical issues that organizations face with their use of digital technologies. Firstly, let's talk about Data Privacy. In today's digital age, organizations collect vast amounts of personal data, ranging from shopping habits to personal communications. Ethical concerns arise regarding how this data is stored, used, and shared. There's the issue of consent – are individuals fully aware of what they are consenting to when they sign up for services? And then, there's the matter of surveillance and data breaches – a constant threat to the privacy of individuals. Companies have a moral responsibility to handle user data securely and transparently, failing which can lead to loss of trust and reputational damage. Secondly, consider the concept of AI and Bias. Artificial intelligence systems are as good as the data they are trained on, and if this data contains biases, the AI will too. We've seen cases where AI in recruitment tools showed bias against certain demographic groups. Or in law enforcement, where predictive policing tools may disproportionately target specific communities. For organizations, there's an ethical imperative to ensure that AI systems function in a fair and impartial manner, requiring constant evaluation and adjustment. Lastly, let's examine the Workplace Surveillance issue. Digital technologies allow for unprecedented monitoring of employees. From software that tracks keystrokes and mouse movements to tools that monitor emails and employee time management, the scope for surveillance is immense. While on one hand, there may be legitimate reasons for some level of monitoring – to ensure productivity or protect company assets – there is a thin line between legitimate oversight and invasive surveillance that can harm employee trust, morale, and even mental health. To synthesize, as organizations more deeply integrate digital technologies into their operations, they must remain vigilant about maintaining the trust of their customers and workforce. Respecting privacy, ensuring fairness, and balancing oversight with respect for individual autonomy are not just good ethical practices; they're also good business.

Cependant, ils nécessitent toujours des mesures de prévention pour protéger les populations et les infrastructures. Voici des moyens de prévention et de préparation face à ce type d'éruption volcanique : 1. Surveillance volcanologique : Installer des équipements de surveillance, comme des sismographes, des inclinomètres, des stations GPS et des caméras thermiques, pour détecter les signes avant-coureurs d’une éruption (augmentation de l’activité sismique, déformation du sol, changements dans la composition des gaz volcaniques). 2. Zonage et planification de l'utilisation du territoire : Délimiter les zones à risque en se basant sur les cartes de dangers volcaniques et restreindre le développement des zones résidentielles et industrielles dans ces zones. 3. Plans d'évacuation : Mettre en place des plans d'évacuation et des itinéraires clairs pour les populations vivant près des volcans effusifs, et réaliser régulièrement des exercices d'évacuation. 4. Éducation et sensibilisation : Informer la population locale sur le comportement à adopter en cas d'alerte volcanique et les mesures de sécurité à suivre avant, pendant et après une éruption. 5. Structures de protection : Construire des digues et des canaux de déviation pour diriger les coulées de lave loin des zones habitées et des infrastructures vitales. 6. Réponse d'urgence : Organiser des services d'urgence pour fournir des soins médicaux, de la nourriture, de l'eau et un abri en cas de nécessité pendant et après une éruption. 7. Systèmes d'alerte : Mettre en place des systèmes d'alerte précoce pour avertir la population locale en cas d'éruptions imminentes, par le biais de sirènes, de messages textes ou d'autres moyens de communication. 8. Assistance juridique et financière : Créer des fonds d'urgence et des assurances spéciales pour aider les individus et les entreprises affectés par les éruptions volcaniques. Bien que ces mesures ne puissent empêcher les éruptions, elles peuvent grandement contribuer à en minimiser l'impact. Il est crucial que les autorités locales collaborent avec les volcanologues et les services de secours pour développer des stratégies efficaces de gestion des risques volcaniques."},{"instruction":"Ted has quickly adjusted to our class and new friends and is becoming more confident by the day.

Как повысить давление","output":"Пониженное артериальное давление (гипотония): Последствия и методы повышения Гипотония, или пониженное артериальное давление, является одним из распространенных состояний, которые могут повлиять на работу сердечно-сосудистой системы. Это означает, что кровь циркулирует в организме с более низким давлением, чем обычно. В этой статье мы рассмотрим возможные последствия гипотонии и поделимся некоторыми методами повышения артериального давления. Пониженное артериальное давление может иметь несколько причин, включая генетическую предрасположенность, состояния стресса, недостаток жидкости в организме, а также определенные хронические заболевания. Основными симптомами гипотонии являются слабость, головокружение, чувство усталости, повышенная потливость и нарушения сна. Также могут возникать проблемы с концентрацией, затруднения при замедлении реакции, повышенная стимулируемость нервной системы, а также присущее этому состоянию снижение работы сердечно-сосудистой системы. Пониженное артериальное давление может привести к различным осложнениям и последствиям. Например, недостаточное кровоснабжение органов и тканей может вызвать головокружение, ощущение слабости и даже потерю сознания. В некоторых случаях возникают серьезные проблемы с сердцем и дыхательной системой, что может привести к сердечным приступам или обморокам. Более тяжелые формы гипотонии могут повлиять на работу пищеварительной системы, почек и нервной системы. Если вы столкнулись с пониженным артериальным давлением, существуют несколько методов, которые могут помочь вам повысить давление. Прежде всего, важно поддерживать уровень жидкости в организме возможно более полным. Это можно достичь путем частого потребления воды и других жидкостей, таких как свежевыжатые соки или негазированные напитки. Ограничение употребления кофеина и алкоголя также может помочь в повышении давления. Правильное питание также сыграет важную роль в повышении артериального давления. Рекомендуется употреблять пищу, богатую белками, чтобы поддерживать здоровый уровень гормонов и электролитов. Разнообразные продукты, такие как мясо, рыба, яйца и сыры, могут быть отличными источниками белка. Дополнительно, физическая активность может помочь улучшить циркуляцию крови и повысить артериальное давление. Регулярные физические упражнения, такие как ходьба, плавание или езда на велосипеде, способствуют укреплению сердечно-сосудистой системы. Тем не менее, перед началом физической активности необходимо проконсультироваться с врачом, особенно если у вас уже есть какие-либо заболевания или проблемы со здоровьем. В заключение, гипотония является распространенным состоянием, которое требует внимания и правильного лечения. Она может привести к различным неприятным последствиям и осложнениям, поэтому важно знать, как повысить артериальное давление. Путем поддержания нормального уровня жидкости в организме через правильное питание и регулярную физическую активность, можно снизить риск возникновения проблем, связанных с гипотонией."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Dưới đây là một số ảnh hưởng chính: 1. Giao dịch quốc tế bị hạn chế: SWIFT là một hệ thống quan trọng để thông báo và thực hiện các giao dịch quốc tế. Việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT sẽ làm tăng rào cản trong việc chuyển tiền và thực hiện các giao dịch tài chính đối với Nga. Do đó, việc giao thương giữa Nga và các đối tác quốc tế có thể trở nên khó khăn và chậm trễ, gây ảnh hưởng lớn đến hoạt động xuất nhập khẩu và đầu tư. 2. Mất lòng tin của nhà đầu tư và ngân hàng: Việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT sẽ làm mất lòng tin của các nhà đầu tư và ngân hàng quốc tế đối với Nga. Điều này có thể gây ra sự suy thoái đáng kể trong luồng vốn và đầu tư trực tiếp nước ngoài vào nền kinh tế Nga. Các ngân hàng cũng có thể từ chối cấp các khoản vay nước ngoài cho các doanh nghiệp Nga, làm gia tăng gián đoạn tài chính trong nền kinh tế. 3. Mất giá trị đồng Ruble: Sự không chắc chắn và rủi ro về việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT có thể làm giảm giá trị của đồng Ruble, đồng tiền của Nga. Điều này có thể dẫn đến lạm phát và làm gia tăng khó khăn kinh tế bên trong Nga. 4. Hạn chế trong ngành ngân hàng: Việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT sẽ gây ra sự rối loạn trong hoạt động của các ngân hàng Nga, bao gồm cả quốc gia và tư nhân. Các ngân hàng sẽ gặp khó khăn trong việc thực hiện các giao dịch và chuyển tiền quốc tế, gây ra trì trệ trong lĩnh vực tài chính của Nga. 5. Tác động tới hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu: Việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT cũng sẽ tạo ra sự ảnh hưởng đối với hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu. Các ngân hàng và doanh nghiệp quốc tế sẽ phải đối mặt với sự khó khăn và rủi ro trong việc thực hiện các giao dịch và giao tiếp với các đối tác Nga. Điều này có thể làm gia tăng sự không ổn định và rủi ro trong hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu. Tuy nhiên, cần lưu ý rằng việc loại bỏ Nga khỏi SWIFT hiện nay vẫn chưa được thực hiện và đòi hỏi sự thỏa thuận từ các quốc gia thành viên khác của SWIFT."},{"instruction":"Đánh giá việc Nga bị loại khỏi hệ thống SWIFT đến hoạt động thanh toán toàn cầu và tác động đối với Việt Nam","output":"Việc Nga bị loại khỏi hệ thống SWIFT sẽ tạo ra một số tác động đối với hoạt động thanh toán toàn cầu và có thể ảnh hưởng tới Việt Nam. Dưới đây là một số đánh giá và tác động có thể xảy ra: 1. Giao thương với Nga và các giao dịch quốc tế: Nếu Nga bị loại khỏi SWIFT, giao thương với Nga và các giao dịch quốc tế có liên quan đến Nga có thể gặp khó khăn. Điều này có thể ảnh hưởng đến các doanh nghiệp Việt Nam mà hiện đang có mối quan hệ thương mại, đầu tư hoặc tài chính với Nga, gây trì trệ và không chắc chắn trong việc thực hiện các giao dịch. 2. Rủi ro tài chính và hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu: Việc Nga bị loại khỏi SWIFT có thể tạo ra những rủi ro tài chính và gây ảnh hưởng đến hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu. Các ngân hàng và doanh nghiệp Việt Nam có thể đối mặt với khó khăn trong việc thực hiện các giao dịch và giao tiếp với các đối tác Nga, làm gia tăng sự không ổn định và rủi ro trong hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu. 3. Thị trường năng lượng: Nga là một trong những nhà cung cấp lớn của năng lượng cho Việt Nam.

Điều này có thể ảnh hưởng tới nguồn cung năng lượng và giá cả của nó. 4. Định giá đồng tiền và thị trường tài chính: Việc loại bỏ Nga khỏi SWIFT có thể làm tăng rủi ro và tạo ra sự không chắc chắn trong thị trường tài chính toàn cầu. Điều này có thể gây ra biến động giá trị đồng tiền và thị trường tài chính trên toàn cầu, có thể ảnh hưởng tới Việt Nam và các hoạt động thương mại và tài chính của nước này.

Dưới đây là một số hậu quả có thể xảy ra: 1. Gián đoạn trong giao dịch xuất - nhập khẩu: SWIFT đóng vai trò quan trọng trong việc thực hiện các giao dịch thanh toán quốc tế. Việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT sẽ làm gia tăng rào cản và khó khăn trong việc thực hiện giao dịch xuất - nhập khẩu của Nga. Các doanh nghiệp Nga có thể gặp khó khăn trong việc nhận và chuyển tiền cho các đối tác quốc tế, gây trì trệ và làm chậm quá trình giao dịch. 2. Tăng nguy cơ rủi ro và chi phí: Việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT có thể làm tăng nguy cơ rủi ro và chi phí trong việc thực hiện giao dịch xuất - nhập khẩu. Các doanh nghiệp Nga có thể phải tìm các phương thức và hệ thống thanh toán thay thế để có thể tiếp tục giao dịch với các đối tác quốc tế, điều này có thể tốn kém và gây rối. 3. Mất lòng tin và khó khăn trong giao thương quốc tế: Việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT có thể làm mất lòng tin của các đối tác và người mua quốc tế đối với Nga. Điều này có thể gây khó khăn trong việc thiết lập và duy trì các mối quan hệ thương mại quốc tế. Các đối tác có thể có sự do dự hoặc từ chối thực hiện giao dịch với Nga do rủi ro và không chắc chắn trong hệ thống thanh toán. 4. Hiệu quả và cạnh tranh xuất khẩu: Hậu quả của việc bị loại khỏi SWIFT có thể làm giảm hiệu quả và cạnh tranh của xuất khẩu Nga. Khả năng thực hiện giao dịch nhanh chóng và đáng tin cậy là yếu tố quan trọng đối với các doanh nghiệp xuất khẩu. Nếu không có khả năng thực hiện giao dịch qua SWIFT, doanh nghiệp xuất khẩu Nga có thể gặp khó khăn trong việc cung cấp hàng hóa và không đáp ứng được nhanh chóng yêu cầu từ các thị trường quốc tế.

[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.800] 而森川的最終目標 [00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.800] 是參加在韓國舉辦的亞洲運動會 [00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.800] 在韓國 [00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.800] 作為日本代表參與韓國的亞洲運動會 [00:06:50.800 -->

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.800] 這個女子大師一級的類別 [00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.800] 并且每個項目都有 [00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.800] 各自的代表選拔標準線 [00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.800] 有特定的選拔標準時間 [00:07:13.800 -->

--> 00:07:41.800] 首先是從運動選手的 [00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.800] 333競技開始 [00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.800] 將分成三組放置的杯子堆疊起來 [00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.800] 並且回復到原始狀態所需的時間競賽 [00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.800] 以日本代表選拔標準時間 [00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.800] 3.1秒台為目標 [00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.800] 雖然大約一年沒有挑戰 [00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:07.800] 但從開始就逐漸提速 [00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.800] 並以3.1秒台為目標 [00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.800] 從頭到尾速度極快 [00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.800] 轉瞬之間就達到了3.2秒台 [00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800] 3.1秒？可以做到嗎？ [00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.800] 接著 [00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:27.800] 快速！ [00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800] 竟然跳過了3.1秒台 [00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.800] 一口氣衝到3.0秒台 [00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.800] 順利突破了選拔標準時間 [00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.800] 順帶一提，這已超過日本紀錄 [00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.800] 啊？ [00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.800] 是的，就是最近才更新的 [00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.800] 森川的年齡組別日本紀錄 [00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.800] 3秒050 [00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.800] 在25次挑戰中 [00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.800] 森川就超越了這個紀錄 [00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.800] 如果現場能做到這樣 [00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800] 那就會讓人驚嘆 [00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.800] 但在正式比賽中只能嘗試三次 [00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.800] 接下來是363運動堆疊競賽 [00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.800] 這次是將3個、6個、3個的杯子分類擺放 [00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.800] 並競爭建立與恢復原狀的時間 [00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.800] 363選拔標準時間為 [00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.800] 4.6秒台為目標"},{"instruction":"translate the

[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.800] まずは先ほどの363 [00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.800] そして次は6個の山を2つ建て [00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.800] 最後に最大の難関 [00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.800] 10個の山を作って元の状態に戻す競技 [00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800] サイクルの先行基準タイム [00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.800] 13秒台を目指す [00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.800] だが実はこのサイクル [00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.800] 森川が最も苦手とする種目 [00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.800] 勝負は最後の難関10個の山を [00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.800] いかにスムーズに建てられるか [00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800] 挑戦を続けると [00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.800] 自己最速記録を更新し [00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800] 先行基準タイムに迫る [00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.800] 14秒台前半まで到達 [00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800] しかし [00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.800] 残念ながらその後も13秒台には届かず [00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.800] 2時間後特訓が終了 [00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.800] サイクルは課題を残す結果となったが [00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.800] 333と363この2つを取れれば [00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.800] 日本代表入りが見えてくる [00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.800] 果たして森川は本番の3回で実力を発揮し [00:12:59.800 -->

次に森川が出場するマスターズの部の順で行われる [00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.800] ここから本番までは各テーブルで個人練習 [00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:34.800] 緊張を振り払うかのように黙々と練習を続ける森川 [00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.800] そして","output":"[00:09:20.800 -->

00:10:22.800] 只有三次機會展現真正實力 [00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.800] 初次實戰練習，目標是4.6秒台 [00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.800] 請 [00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:37.800] 好的時間 [00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.800] 首次嘗試遺憾地只達到4.7秒台

00:11:28.800] 循環賽 [00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.800] 現在讓我們來看森川實際操作並解釋流程 [00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.800] 首先是剛才的363 [00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.800] 接著是建立六個杯子的兩座高塔 [00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.800] 最後是最難的挑戰 [00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.800] 創建十個杯子的堆疊並恢復原狀 [00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800] 循環項目的預備基準時間 [00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.800] 是13秒台 [00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.800] 但事實上，循環 [00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.800] 是森川最不擅長的項目 [00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.800] 比賽的勝負取決於 [00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.800] 最後難關的十個杯子能否順利堆疊 [00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800] 不斷挑戰之下 [00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.800] 不斷刷新個人最快紀錄 [00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800] 接近了預備基準時間 [00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.800] 達成了14秒台初期的成績 [00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800] 但遺憾的是 [00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.800] 繼續挑戰仍未達到13秒台 [00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.800] 兩小時的特訓結束後 [00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.800] 循環賽留下未解決的問題 [00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.800] 但只要在333和363兩項取得成績 [00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.800] 日本代表資格將在望 [00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.800] 森川能否在正式比賽的三次機會中發揮實力 [00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.800] 取得日本代表的位置？ [00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.800] 而命運的大會之日轉瞬即來 [00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.800] 終於來到了紀錄會現場 [00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.800] 進入會場之後 [00:13:28.800 -->

00:23:10.800] 還需要再得到一個項目才能加入日本隊 [00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:18.800] 不過，下一個363項目，在特訓中，她已經達到了4.4秒台的日本紀錄候選 [00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.800] 想要決定是否能加入日本隊，需要接下來通過這一項 [00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:33.800]

[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:24.800] やはり日本代表の座をつかむのは容易くはない [00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.800] しかも最後の種目は森川が苦手とするサイクル [00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:35.800] 練習でも一度も先行基準の13秒台を出したことはない [00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.800]

日本代表という高みへの挑戦 [00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.800] だがこれまでもどんなに高い壁が立ちはだかろうと [00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.800] 諦めることなく最後まで立ち向かい [00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:44.800] 幾度となく激闘を制してきた [00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:50.800]

日本代表への険しい壁だろうと [00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.800] きっと超えてみせる [00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.800] いや超えてくれる [00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:31.800] 時は来た [00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.800] 緊張する [00:29:34.800 -->

Thème du long dialogue du film imaginaire Fictif: La fille parfaite.","output":"Bénédicte: Mes chers amis, aujourd'hui nous avons un thème un peu spécial pour notre dialogue improvisé. Nous allons explorer le concept de \\"la fille parfaite\\". Que signifie-t-elle pour vous? Pascal: Eh bien, pour moi, la fille parfaite est celle qui excelle dans tout ce qu'elle entreprend. Elle est intelligente, belle, empathique et talentueuse. Elle est capable de jongler entre ses études, ses loisirs et ses relations personnelles sans problème. Pauline: Je suis d'accord avec Pascal. Mais je pense également que la fille parfaite doit être indépendante et confiante. Elle sait ce qu'elle veut dans la vie et ne se laisse pas influencer par les autres. Elle a également une grande capacité d'adaptation et est toujours prête à aider les autres. Olivier: Oui, et je pense aussi que la fille parfaite doit être généreuse et altruiste. Elle se soucie des autres et est prête à donner de son temps et de ses ressources pour les aider. Elle a un grand cœur et est toujours prête à tendre la main à ceux qui en ont besoin. Anne: J'aimerais ajouter que la fille parfaite doit être courageuse et persévérante. Elle ne recule jamais devant les défis et est prête à sortir de sa zone de confort pour atteindre ses objectifs. Elle est déterminée et ne laisse pas les obstacles l'arrêter. Roberto: Je suis d'accord avec Anne. En plus de cela, je pense que la fille parfaite doit être respectueuse des autres et de l'environnement. Elle est attentionnée et pense toujours aux conséquences de ses actions. Elle est une citoyenne responsable et se préoccupe de préserver notre planète. Marjorie: Et n'oublions pas l'importance de l'authenticité. La fille parfaite ne cherche pas à être quelqu'un d'autre, elle est fière de qui elle est et de ses imperfections. Elle accepte les autres tels qu'ils sont et inspire ceux qui l'entourent à faire de même. Christine: Tout à fait, Marjorie. La fille parfaite est également équilibrée dans tous les aspects de sa vie. Elle sait prendre soin d'elle-même, physiquement et émotionnellement. Elle réalise l'importance de maintenir un équilibre entre son travail, sa famille, ses amis et ses propres besoins. Thierry: Je suis d'accord avec tout ce qui a été dit jusqu'à présent, mais je voudrais ajouter que la fille parfaite doit être ouverte d'esprit et tolérante. Elle est prête à accepter les différences des autres et à apprendre d'eux. Elle est également douée pour la communication et la résolution de conflits. Marie: Tu as tout à fait raison, Thierry. En fin de compte, la fille parfaite est une personne qui inspire les autres par son exemple. Elle est aimante, confiante, courageuse, généreuse, respectueuse, authentique et équilibrée. Elle est une force positive dans le monde. Frédéric: Je suis d'accord avec tout ce qui a été dit jusqu'à présent. Mais je pense également que la fille parfaite doit avoir un bon sens de l'humour. Elle sait rire d'elle-même et apporter de la joie à ceux qui l'entourent. L'humour est une qualité essentielle dans la vie. Juliette: Je suis totalement d'accord avec toi, Frédéric. Et je pense que la fille parfaite doit également être curieuse et avide de connaissances. Elle est toujours prête à apprendre de nouvelles choses et à remettre en question ses propres croyances. Elle est ouverte à la croissance personnelle et intellectuelle. Nathalie: Je pense que nous avons vraiment dressé un portrait complet de la fille parfaite. Elle est simplement extraordinaire dans tous les aspects de sa vie. Mais en même temps, nous devons aussi nous rappeler que personne n'est parfait et que nous avons tous nos propres défauts. C'est ce qui nous rend humains. Bénédicte: Mes amis, je suis inspirée par cette discussion. Nous avons décrit une fille parfaite, mais n'oublions pas que nous sommes tous uniques et spéciaux à notre manière. Célébrons nos différences et nos imperfections, car c'est là que notre véritable beauté réside. Maintenant, mettons tout cela en action dans notre improvisation! (Tous les membres du groupe applaudissent et se préparent à commencer leur dialogue improvisé sur le thème de \\"la fille parfaite\\")"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍laser welding process of manufacturing lithium battery","output":"激光焊接是一种制造锂电池的常用工艺。锂电池的制造过程中需要连接电池的正负极材料，而激光焊接能够通过高能量激光束将两种材料精确焊接在一起。 激光焊接的工作原理是，通过激光器产生的激光束，将能量集中到焊接位置。当激光束聚焦在正负极材料交汇处时，激光束的能量会使两种材料表面瞬间熔化，并迅速形成焊接接头。由于激光焊接过程时间极短，激光束的热影响区域较小，能够避免过多热量导致的损伤。 激光焊接在锂电池制造中具有多个优点。首先，激光焊接能够实现非接触式焊接，不需要直接接触电池材料，减少了与材料接触可能带来的污染风险。其次，激光焊接具有高精度的特点，可以实现精细的焊接接头，保证了电池的稳定性和性能。此外，激光焊接速度快，生产效率高，适用于大规模量产。 总的来说，激光焊接是一种常用的锂电池制造工艺，通过高能量激光束将正负极材料焊接在一起，实现高效、精准和稳定的焊接接头。这种工艺能够提高锂电池的质量和性能，广泛应用于电动汽车、移动设备和储能系统等领域。"},{"instruction":"can you speak chinese？","output":"Yes, I can speak Chinese."},{"instruction":"说说你对中国经济现状的看法，并谈谈中国经济之后的发展，1500字左右","output":"中国经济是世界上最大的经济体之一，对全球经济具有重要影响力。在过去几十年里，中国取得了令人瞩目的发展成就，实现了经济增长和减贫的同时推动了科技创新和城乡发展。 然而，近年来中国经济面临一些挑战。首先，受全球经济增长放缓和贸易摩擦影响，中国的出口受到一定冲击。其次，中国内部经济结构存在不均衡和不可持续的问题。过度依赖投资和出口导致了供给过剩和环境污染的问题。同时，消费和服务业发展相对滞后，需要进一步培育和升级。 为了应对这些挑战，中国政府采取了一系列重要政策措施。首先，政府推动供给侧结构性改革，促进产业升级和结构调整，加大对创新和科技的支持。同时，通过推进市场化改革和减轻企业负担，提高全要素生产率和竞争力。其次，政府加大对消费和服务业的支持，鼓励居民消费和旅游消费等，推动内需增长成为经济增长的新动力。 中国经济之后的发展还有很大的潜力和机遇。首先，中国拥有庞大的人口红利和规模经济效应，其中一个重要机遇是促进农村和城市的一体化发展。通过建设现代农业产业体系和推动农民转移就业，可以提高农村居民收入，同时促进农村市场的扩大，释放出巨大的消费潜力。 其次，中国在科技创新和数字经济领域具有巨大的潜力。中国已成为全球最大的互联网市场，拥有世界上最多的互联网用户和移动支付用户。政府大力推动人工智能、大数据、物联网等新兴技术的发展，积极引导企业加大研发投入和创新能力，将技术进步转化为经济增长的动力。 此外，中国积极推进“一带一路”倡议，加强与沿线国家的经济合作和基础设施建设，提高区域合作水平，进一步开放中国市场和扩大对外开放。这将为中国经济提供更多的机遇和空间，同时也将为全球经济增长提供新的动力。 然而，中国经济也面临一些风险和挑战。首先是金融风险。高杠杆和影子银行等问题可能导致金融风险的积累，需要加强监管和规范。其次是环境和资源压力。中国经济的高增长速度和高能耗模式导致环境和资源的损耗增加，需要更加重视可持续发展，加大环保和低碳转型的力度。 总的来说，中国经济现状是一个充满机遇和挑战的阶段。政府需要继续坚定推进供给侧结构性改革，加大对消费和服务业的支持力度，并加强金融风险和环境问题的管理。以创新为驱动，加快转型升级，中国经济必将迎来更加稳定和可持续的发展，为全球经济增长注入新的活力。"},{"instruction":"中国推进“一带一路”倡议的具体做法是什么，以及你有什么看法","output":"“一带一路”倡议是中国提出的重要国家战略，旨在促进沿线国家和地区的经济合作和共同发展。该倡议首先提出于2013年，主要由“丝绸之路经济带”和“21世纪海上丝绸之路”两大组成部分。 具体来说，中国推进“一带一路”倡议采取了以下几个重要的做法： 1. 建设基础设施：中国积极推动与“一带一路”沿线国家和地区的基础设施建设合作，包括公路、铁路、港口、电力等项目。通过建设互联互通的跨境交通网络，提高地区间贸易和人员往来的便利性，促进经济的互联互通。 2. 促进贸易和投资：中国推出了一系列措施，包括减免关税、简化贸易手续以及加强投资合作等，以推动沿线国家和地区之间的贸易和投资活动。中国还成立了丝路基金和亚洲基础设施投资银行，为沿线国家提供融资支持。 3. 深化经济合作：中国积极推动与沿线国家的产能合作和经济合作区建设，通过技术转让、联合开发和产能对接等方式，促进产业的协同发展和互利共赢。 4. 文化交流和人员往来：中国注重推动沿线国家和地区之间的人文交流和人员往来，加强教育、文化、旅游等领域的合作，增进人民之间的了解和友谊。 个人而言，我认为“一带一路”倡议具有积极意义。首先，该倡议为沿线国家提供了巨大的发展机遇，帮助他们加强基础设施建设、促进贸易和投资、推动经济发展。其次，该倡议通过促进经济合作和互联互通，有助于构建开放、包容和多边的国际经济体系。此外，该倡议还有助于推动文化交流和人民友谊，增进各国人民之间的相互了解和合作。 然而，我也认识到“一带一路”倡议面临一些挑战和难题。其中包括项目风险、债务风险、环境影响等问题。因此，中国需要确保项目的可行性和可持续性，加强风险管理和环境保护，避免可能出现的不良影响。 总的来说，中国推进“一带一路”倡议是为了促进共同发展、实现互利共赢的目标。通过与沿线国家和地区深化合作，共同开创经济合作的新局面。同时，中国需要持续完善政策和机制，提高透明度和问责制度，确保倡议的顺利推进和共同受益。"},{"instruction":"概ね更新は進んでおりますので、明日ご提出させて頂きます。 少々お時間頂いておりますがご了承ください。 丁寧なビジネスメールの文章にしてください","output":"いつもお世話になっております。 このたびは、貴重なお時間を割いていただきまして誠にありがとうございます。お取り組みの進捗につきまして、概ね更新が進んでおりますこと、ご報告申し上げます。 ただし、まだ少しの手続きが残っており、明日までに完了させる予定でございます。少々お時間をいただいてしまいますが、何卒ご了承いただけますと幸いでございます。 なお、ご不明点やご質問等がございましたら、お気軽にお申し付けください。迅速かつ丁寧にお答えさせていただきます。 引き続き、なお一層のご協力とご支援を賜りますようお願い申し上げます。 どうぞよろしくお願いいたします。 敬具"},{"instruction":"既に小林さんから連絡がありましたらすみません。 丁寧なビジネスメールに直してください","output":"いつもお世話になっております。 この度は、貴重なお時間を割いていただきまして誠にありがとうございます。先ほど、小林さんから連絡をいただいた旨、承知いたしました。 ご了承いただきたいのは、お取り組みの進捗につきましては、概ね順調に進んでおり、明日までに完了させる予定であるということです。ただし、まだ少々の手続きが残っており、少しのお時間をいただくことになります。何卒ご了承いただけますと幸いでございます。 また、ご不明点やご質問等がございましたら、お気軽にお申し付けください。必要な情報を迅速かつ丁寧にお伝えいたします。 引き続き、なお一層のご協力とご支援を賜りますようお願い申し上げます。 どうぞよろしくお願いいたします。 敬具"},{"instruction":"Executive summary の意味","output":"「Executive summary」は、ビジネス文書や報告書などで使用される表現であり、「要約」という意味を持ちます。通常は、文書の冒頭部分に位置し、全体の内容や主要なポイントを簡潔にまとめたものです。要約部分を読むことで、読者は文書の概要や重要な情報を把握することができます。Executive summaryは、特に管理職や意思決定者向けに作成されることが多く、時間の制約がある読者に対して効果的な情報提供を行う役割を果たしています。"},{"instruction":"Par exemple: Pour 245 grammes de lait, l'énergie réelle sera 245 x 65.1 + 100 = 159.495 kcal.

Dưới đây là cấu hình tối thiểu công bố cho Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS, phiên bản được phát hành tháng 4 năm 2020. Cần lưu ý rằng cấu hình này có thể không phải là lựa chọn tốt nhất để mục đích sản xuất, nhưng vẫn có thể hoạt động cho các tác vụ đơn giản hoặc môi trường thử nghiệm: - Bộ vi xử lý: 1 GHz CPU (x86-64 hoặc ARMv8) - RAM: 512 MB - Dung lượng ổ cứng: 2.5 GB không gian trống tối thiểu cho cài đặt tiêu chuẩn. Cần thêm không gian cho dữ liệu của bạn và ứng dụng. - Boot: Hệ thống UEFI và Legacy BIOS (tùy thuộc vào hệ thống của bạn) - Card mạng: ít nhất một card mạng Ethernet (để cấu hình mạng) Tất nhiên, đây là cấu hình tối thiểu và các yêu cầu thực tế có thể tăng lên tùy thuộc vào các dịch vụ và ứng dụng bạn muốn chạy trên server. Đối với một máy chủ sản xuất hoặc với nhiều dịch vụ cần nhiều tài nguyên hơn, bạn nên có cấu hình cao hơn. Nếu bạn quan tâm đến việc cài đặt một phiên bản Ubuntu Server mới hơn, bạn nên kiểm tra tài liệu chính thức hoặc trang web của Ubuntu để biết cấu hình tối thiểu chính xác cho phiên bản mà bạn muốn cài đặt."},{"instruction":"protocol ssh là gì","output":"SSH, viết tắt của Secure Shell, là một giao thức mạng được sử dụng để thiết lập một kết nối an toàn giữa máy khách và máy chủ. SSH cho phép bạn đăng nhập vào một máy chủ từ xa, thực thi các lệnh, di chuyển các file và sử dụng các tài nguyên mạng khác một cách an toàn. Giao thức SSH được thiết kế để thay thế các giao thức kém an toàn hơn như Telnet và FTP, những giao thức này truyền thông tin, đặc biệt là mật khẩu, ở dạng văn bản rõ ràng và không được mã hoá, làm tăng nguy cơ bị nghe lén và tấn công \\"man-in-the-middle\\". Các tính năng chính của SSH bao gồm: 1. Mã hóa phiên: Toàn bộ dữ liệu truyền qua kết nối SSH đều được mã hoá, bảo vệ chống lại nguy cơ bị đọc lén. 2. Xác thực: SSH hỗ trợ nhiều phương thức xác thực, bao gồm mật khẩu và xác thực dựa trên khóa công khai, nơi mà các khóa riêng được sử dụng để chứng minh danh tính mà không cần truyền mật khẩu qua mạng. 3. Tính toàn vẹn: SSH sử dụng các thuật toán để đảm bảo rằng dữ liệu không bị thay đổi hoặc hỏng khi truyền qua mạng. 4. Túnel hóa: SSH có thể tạo ra các kênh mã hóa bảo mật (tunnels) để bảo vệ các ứng dụng mạng không được mã hoá khi chúng được truyền qua mạng công cộng. 5. Chuyển tiếp cổng: Còn được gọi là SSH port forwarding, tính năng này cho phép bạn chuyển tiếp một cổng máy tính từ máy khách hoặc máy chủ SSH đến máy khác, tạo điều kiện cho việc chuyển tiếp dữ liệu an toàn. Ubuntu cung cấp các package SSH phổ biến như OpenSSH, một bộ công cụ SSH miễn phí và mã nguồn mở, thường được sử dụng cho cả máy khách và máy chủ SSH trên hệ thống Linux, bao gồm \`ssh\` (máy khách SSH), \`sshd\` (máy chủ SSH), \`scp\` (chương trình chuyển file an toàn), \`sftp\` (Secure File Transfer Protocol), và nhiều tiện ích hỗ trợ khác."},{"instruction":"IO::Socket::SSL là gì","output":"\`IO::Socket::SSL\` là một mô-đun Perl cung cấp một giao diện đơn giản để sử dụng socket trong Perl với mức độ bảo mật SSL/TLS. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) và TLS (Transport Layer Security) là những giao thức mã hóa được thiết kế để cung cấp kết nối an toàn qua mạng. Mô-đun \`IO::Socket::SSL\` làm việc trên cơ sở \`IO::Socket::INET\`, mở rộng khả năng của nó để bao gồm hỗ trợ mã hóa. Nó cho phép các nhà phát triển tạo ra các ứng dụng mạng sử dụng SSL/TLS để bảo vệ truyền tải dữ liệu, ví dụ như các kết nối HTTPS, IMAPS, SMTPS và các giao thức khác đã được nâng cấp để sử dụng mã hóa. Các tính năng chính của \`IO::Socket::SSL\` bao gồm: 1. Tạo các kết nối socket an toàn cho cả máy chủ và máy khách. 2. Xác thực cả máy chủ và máy khách bằng cách sử dụng chứng chỉ. 3. Tích hợp với các giao diện lập trình ứng dụng (API) mã hóa như OpenSSL hoặc các thư viện mã hóa tương đương. 4. Hỗ trợ SNI (Server Name Indication) để cho phép cùng một địa chỉ IP được chia sẻ bởi nhiều tên miền SSL. 5. Cung cấp một cách dễ dàng để nâng cấp kết nối không mã hóa thành mã hóa, và ngược lại. Để sử dụng \`IO::Socket::SSL\`, bạn cần cài đặt mô-đun và các phụ thuộc của nó (chẳng hạn như OpenSSL và mô-đun Perl \`Net::SSLeay\`). Đây là một phần của CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network), nơi lưu trữ các mô-đun Perl mở rộng. Cài đặt \`IO::Socket::SSL\` từ CPAN có thể được thực hiện thông qua các công cụ như \`cpan\` hoặc \`cpanm\`, ví dụ: \`\`\`shell cpan install IO::Socket::SSL # hoặc cpanm IO::Socket::SSL \`\`\` Nhớ rằng để sử dụng SSL/TLS, bạn cũng cần phải cài đặt và cấu hình đúng các chứng chỉ SSL, chìa khóa riêng tư và bộ chứng nhận tin cậy trên hệ thống của bạn."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],E={key:0},N={key:1};function W(n,e,h,f,o,r){const m=p("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(i(!0),a(w,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(i(),v(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
