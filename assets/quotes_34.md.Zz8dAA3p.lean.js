Recognize that it can be factored using the difference of squares:    [    p^2 - 1 = (p - 1)(p + 1)    ]  Part 2: Divisibility by 8 3. Since ( p geq 5 ) is a prime number, ( p ) is odd. Therefore, ( p - 1 ) and ( p + 1 ) are two consecutive even numbers. 4. Among any two consecutive even numbers, one of them is divisible by 2 and the other by 4. Thus, the product ( (p - 1)(p + 1) ) is divisible by:    [    2 times 4 = 8    ]  Part 3: Divisibility by 3 5. The product ( (p - 1) p (p + 1) ) is the product of three consecutive integers. Among any three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3. 6. Since ( p ) is a prime number greater than 3, ( p ) itself is not divisible by 3. Thus, either ( p - 1 ) or ( p + 1 ) must be divisible by 3. Therefore, ( (p - 1)(p + 1) ) is divisible by 3. 7.

Notice that ( 12k(3k + 1) ) is divisible by 24 because ( k ) or ( 3k + 1 ) must be even, ensuring a factor of 2 in ( 12k(3k + 1) ).  Case 2: ( p = 6k + 5 ) 4. Substitute into the original equation and simplify:    [    p^2 - 1 = (6k + 5)^2 - 1 = 36k^2 + 60k + 25 - 1 = 36k^2 + 60k + 24    ]    [    = 12(3k^2 + 5k + 2)    ] 5.

Thus, choosing 2 from remaining ( n-4 ) positions for placing these bound sections:     [    C_{n-4}^2 = frac{(n-4)(n-5)}{2}    ] 4. **Probability calculation:**    [    text{Probability} = frac{C_{n-4}^2}{C_{n-1}^2} = frac{frac{(n-4)(n-5)}{2}}{frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}} = frac{(n-4)(n-5)}{(n-1)(n-2)}    ] 5. **Conclusion for general ( n geq 6 ):**      [    boxed{frac{(n-4)(n-5)}{(n-1)(n-2)}}    ]"},{"instruction":"Completely factor the following expression: 25x^2 + 10x.","output":"The given expression is 25x^2 + 10x. 1.

From this square, four corners are cut off, each forming a triangle where two sides are along the sides of the square and are 1 / 3 of their lengths.

This creates a sequence of polygons (each contained within the previous one). Find the area of the figure that is the intersection of all these polygons (i.e., formed by the points belonging to all the polygons).","output":"1. **Introduction of polygons:**     Let M_0 be the initial square with side length 1. We continue creating polygons M_1, M_2, M_3, ... from M_0 by successively cutting off triangles. These triangles have two sides that go 1/3 the length of the sides of the polygon from the previous step. 2. **Definition of the auxiliary polygons:**     Introduce polygons N_k where vertices are the midpoints of the sides of M_k for k=0, 1, 2, ldots. 3. **Understanding iterative cuts:**     For any vertex A of M_k, let B and C be the neighboring vertices. To get M_{k+1} from M_k, a triangle B_2AC_2 is cut from each vertex A, where B_2 and C_2 divide the segments [AB] and [AC] in a ratio of 1:2.  4. **Midpoints relationships:**     Let B_1 and C_1 be the midpoints of [AB] and [AC] respectively. Hence, secondary calculations show:          begin{aligned}     & |AC_2| = frac{2}{3} |AC_1|,      & |AB_2| = frac{2}{3} |AB_1|.     end{aligned}      5. **Area relationships:**          Denote by S(triangle ABC) the area of triangle ABC. It follows that:          begin{aligned}     S(B_2 A C_2) &= frac{4}{9} S(B_1 A C_1),      S(B_1 A_1 C_1) &= frac{1}{3} S(B_1 A C_1).     end{aligned}      6. **Defining areas:**     Let x_k be the area of polygon N_k, and y_k be the area of polygon M_k. Summing the area relationships over all vertices results in:          begin{aligned}     y_k - y_{k+1} &= frac{4}{9} (y_k - x_k),      x_{k+1} - x_k &= frac{1}{3} (y_k - x_k).     end{aligned}      7. **Simplifying the expressions:**     By defining a = frac{y_k - y_{k+1}}{x_{k+1} - x_k} = frac{4}{3}, we obtain the iterative contraction described by:          y_{k+1} - x_{k+1} = frac{2}{9} (y_k - x_k).      8. **Finding common intersection point:**     If we continuously zoom into the segments like [x_k, y_k], a unique point a would be dividing in the ratio 3:4 for all such segments. In consideration, the ratio remains consistent throughout the process:          frac{y_k - a}{a - x_k} = frac{4}{3}.      9. **Initial segment and adjusting point:**     Starting from the initial segment [x_0, y_0] = left[frac{1}{2}, 1right]:          frac{1 - a}{a - frac{1}{2}} = frac{4}{3}.          Solving this results in:          a = frac{5}{7}.      10. **Conclusion:**     Therefore, the area of the figure that is the intersection of all these polygons (considering k to infty) converges to a = frac{5}{7}.

The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. So, for a square with a side length of 8 cm, the area is: Area of square = side × side Area of square = 8 cm × 8 cm Area of square = 64 cm² The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, for a rectangle with a length of 10 cm and a width of 5 cm, the area is: Area of rectangle = length × width Area of rectangle = 10 cm × 5 cm Area of rectangle = 50 cm² Now, to find the difference between the areas, we subtract the area of the rectangle from the area of the square: Difference in area = Area of square - Area of rectangle Difference in area = 64 cm² - 50 cm² Difference in area = 14 cm² So, the difference between the area of the square and the rectangle is boxed{14}  square centimeters (cm²)."},{"instruction":"Given that f(x) = lg (frac{2}{1x} + a) is an odd function, determine the range of x values for which f(x) < 0.","output":"1. First, we must recognize that for any odd function, f(-x) = -f(x). However, since the given function contains a logarithm, it cannot be an odd function due to the presence of the absolute value in its definition. Therefore, let's find the range of x for which f(x) < 0 without considering its odd function property. 2. For the logarithm to be defined, its argument must be positive: frac{2}{1-x} + a > 0. Additionally, to satisfy f(x) < 0, the argument must be less than 1 (since logarithm base 10 of a number less than 1 is negative): frac{2}{1-x} + a < 1. 3. Combine these two inequalities: 0 < frac{2}{1-x} + a < 1. Subtract a from all sides: 0 - a < frac{2}{1-x} < 1 - a. 4. Invert the inequality signs when taking the reciprocal: frac{1}{1-a} > frac{1-x}{2} > frac{1}{-a} (assuming that a neq 1 and a neq -1). 5.

However, given the original problem, we must consider the case when a = 0 separately, as it simplifies the function to f(x) = lg(frac{2}{1-x}). In this case, the inequality that satisfies the condition f(x) < 0 is 0 < frac{2}{1-x} < 1. Solving this inequality yields 0 < 1-x < 1, and finally -1 < x < 0. 8.

Observe that the exponent ((n+1)^{n-2}) modulo 4 determines the cyclical nature of ( n^{(n+1)^{n-2}} mod 10 ) because the cycles of the units digits of ( n^k mod 10 ) repeat every 4. 3. Let's analyze ( a_{n} ) for various ( n ) modulo 10:     - When ( n equiv 0 mod 10 ), ( a_{n} equiv 0^{ (anything)} equiv 0 mod 10 ).     - When ( n equiv 1 mod 10 ), ( a_{n} equiv 1^{ (anything)} equiv 1 mod 10 ).     - When ( n equiv 2, 4, 8 mod 10 ):         - ( (n+1)^{n-2} equiv (1+1)^{something} = 2^{something} (mod 4) equiv 0 (mod 4) ).         - So, ( a_{n} equiv n^{4k+1} equiv n mod 10 ).     - When ( n equiv 3, 7, 9 mod 10 ):         - ( (n+1)^{n-2} equiv 0 (mod 4) ),         - So, ( a_{n} equiv n^{4k} equiv 1 (mod 10) ). 4.

Since the sequence ( a_{n} ) is periodic with a period of 10, its sum up to 2018 can be calculated as the sum of the repeated pattern:     - Sum of one full period: [1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 0 = 29]. 6. The total number of terms is 2018, thus the number of complete periods in 2018:     - Number of complete periods: (leftlfloor frac{2018}{10} rightrfloor = 201),     - Extra terms beyond the complete periods: (2018 mod 10 = 8). 7.

The probability of placing the next O is frac{1}{2}, with 1 O tile left out of the 2 remaining tiles. 5.

Since we need an equal number of colored and non-colored adjacent cells, these cannot be marked.     - There are four corner nodes in a (6 times 6) grid. 3. **Boundary Nodes Excluding Corners**:     - Nodes along the boundary, excluding the corners, touch two cells. Since we need an equal number of colored and non-colored cells, these cannot be marked either.     - There are (4 times 5 - 4 = 20) boundary nodes (excluding corners). 4. **Inner Nodes**:     - For a node that forms an intersection of four cells, we can mark it if two of these cells are colored and two are not, satisfying the requirement.     - The inner nodes constitute a grid of (5 times 5 = 25) intersections. 5. **Chessboard Pattern Justification**:     - By using a chessboard coloring pattern, each 2x2 block around a node will have two cells of one color and two cells of another, ensuring we satisfy the condition at each internal node.     - This pattern will cover all the internal (5 times 5) nodes, but not the outermost boundary nodes and corners.

First, we find the total number of non-repeating three-digit numbers. Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 5 choices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) for the first digit. For the second digit, we can choose from the remaining 5 options (that is, 5 options excluding the first digit chosen).

This is due to hydrostatic pressure equilibrium.    - At equilibrium, the pressure due to the water column should be equal to the pressure due to the oil column at the bottom of the vessels. 3. **Hydrostatic Pressure Consideration:**    - The pressure at the bottom of the first vessel (with water) is:      [      P_w = rho_w cdot g cdot h_w      ]    - The pressure at the bottom of the second vessel (with oil) is:      [      P_o = rho_o cdot g cdot h_o      ]    - At equilibrium, ( P_w = P_o ). Hence:      [      rho_w cdot g cdot h_w = rho_o cdot g cdot h_o      ]    - Here, ( g ) (acceleration due to gravity) is the same on both sides and can be canceled out. Therefore:      [      rho_w cdot h_w = rho_o cdot h_o      ] 4. **Volume Consideration:**    - As the cylinder cross-sections are identical and assuming there is no significant change in volumes when the valve opens, we focus on the height adjustments.    - Considering the initial and final volumes (since the total volume of water + oil must be conserved):      [      h_w + h_o = 80 , text{cm} quad (text{since the total height initially was 40 cm each for water and oil})      ] 5. **Solving the Equations:**    [    1000 cdot h_w = 700 cdot h_o    ]    Hence:    [    h_w = frac{7}{10} h_o    ] 6. **Substituting in Volume Equation:**    [    h_w + h_o = 80    ]    Substitute ( h_w = frac{7}{10} h_o ):    [    frac{7}{10} h_o + h_o = 80    ]    [    frac{17}{10} h_o = 80    ]    [    h_o = 80 cdot frac{10}{17}    ]    [    h_o approx 47.059 , text{cm}    ]    Then:    [    h_w = 80 - h_o    ]    [    h_w = 80 - 47.059 approx 32.941 , text{cm}    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    - Converting ( h_w ) to a more precise and simpler form considering the approximation:    [    h_w approx 34 , text{cm}    ] [ boxed{34} ]"},{"instruction":"For the sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms S_n=2^n3, then the general formula for this sequence a_n= ______.","output":"Solution: When n=1, a_1=S_1=2-3=-1.

We are given that ( N ) is divisible by 6 if and only if ( N equiv 0 pmod{6} ).  Since 6 is the product of 2 and 3, ( N ) must be also divisible by 2 and 3.  Step 1: Understanding the divisibility rules - **Divisibility by 2:** For ( N ) to be divisible by 2, its last digit ( a_0 ) must be even. - **Divisibility by 3:** For ( N ) to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits should be divisible by 3.

Thus, AR and AS are the external and internal angle bisectors of angle BAC. 2. **Construct point X**: Let X be a point on RS such that PX parallel AR. This implies that PX is parallel to the external angle bisector AR. 3. **Define the circle w**: Let w be the circumcircle of triangle BCX.  4. **Find the antipode Y**: Let Y be the antipode of X on the circle w. This means XY is a diameter of w. 5. **Draw a parallel line**: Draw a line parallel to AS through Y. Let this line intersect AR at E' and PX at F'. 6. **Properties of F'**: Since XY is a diameter of w, F' lies on w. Also, F'Y bisects angle BF'C because Y is the antipode of X. 7. **Collinearity condition**: To show that E', P, D are collinear, we need to prove that RE'/PX = RD/XD.

Prove that a line can be drawn on the plane such that the number of red and blue points on each side of the line is equal.","output":"1. **Initial Setup**: Consider a plane with 2000 points, where no four points are co-linear. Among these points, 1600 are red, and 400 are blue. We are to prove that there exists a line such that the number of red and blue points on both sides of the line is equal. 2. **Construct a Large Circle**: Draw a sufficiently large circle that encompasses all 2000 points inside it.  3. **Connecting Points**: Draw lines through every pair of points. Each such line intersects the circle at two distinct points, known as intersection points or \\"odd points\\". 4. **Odd Points Analysis**: There are a finite number of such odd points on the circumference of the circle. Excluding these odd points from the circle leaves us with segments (arcs) known as \\"normal points\\" on the circle. 5. **Random Normal Points**: Select any normal point on the circumference. If you draw a line through this point and any point inside the circle, this line will at most intersect one point among the 2000 inside points due to how the points and odd points are structured. 6. **Rotation Argument**: Rotate such a line around the circle (consider lines through the normal points). As you rotate the line from the initial through one normal point to another that diametrically opposes it, the number of points on the left side of the line will vary from 0 to 2000, changing by at most 1 point at each step since the line can intersect each point at most once during the rotation. 7. **Intermediate Line Argument**: Because the number of points on one side of the line changes continuously from 0 to 2000, there must be a point during this rotation where the number of points on either side of the line is exactly equal. Hence, there will be a position where there are exactly 1000 points on each side of the line. 8. **Color Equidivision Proof**: Suppose some line divides the 2000 points such that the left side has exactly x red points and the right side has 1600 - x red points (as the total number of red points is 1600). Similarly, it will also have 1000 - x blue points on one side and 400 - 1000 + x = 400 - x blue points on the other side due to the total count of blue points being 400. 9. **Intermediate Configuration**: Observe that when rotating, if this configuration shifts from the starting point where it begins with (x, 1600-x) to the exact opposite configuration, we must pass a point where exactly half the red points and half the blue points are on either side (as halves of 1600 and 400 are 800 and 200 respectively). 10. **Conclusion**: By continuity and the intermediate value theorem, at some rotation angle, there will be 800 red points and 200 blue points on each side of the line, achieving the equal distribution condition we sought. Hence, there exists a line such that the red and blue points are equally divided as required. [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"Georgia has 4 yellow buttons, 2 black buttons, and some green buttons.

By the Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots t_1 and t_2 is the constant term divided by the coefficient of t^2, which is frac{8}{5}. Hence, t_1t_2 = frac{8}{5}. Since the locations of points A and B in terms of t are t_1 and t_2, respectively, and |MA|cdot|MB| corresponds to the product of distances from M to A and B, which in turn corresponds to the product of the values t_1 and t_2, we have: |MA|cdot|MB| = t_1 cdot t_2 = frac{8}{5}. quad boxed{|MA|cdot|MB| = frac{8}{5}}"},{"instruction":"The king has 5 bags of gold coins, 100 coins in each bag.

The king remembers that in one bag, all the coins weigh 10g each, in another bag they weigh 11g each, in another 12g each, in another 13g each, and in the last 14g each, but he does not remember which bag contains which coins. The king tells this to a wise man in his court and points out one of the bags. The wise man can take any number of coins from this and other bags, but all look the same in appearance. The wise man has a precise balance with two pans but no weights (it will show whether the weights on the pans are equal, and if not, which pan is heavier). a) Can the wise man verify with one weighing whether the pointed bag contains coins of 10g each? b) Can the wise man determine what coins are in the pointed bag with no more than two weighings?   Part (a) **Yes, the wise man can verify with one weighing:** 1. Take 1 coin from each of the other four bags (excluding the pointed bag). 2. Put these 4 coins on the left pan. 3. Take 5 coins from the pointed bag and put them on the right pan. **Calculation:** If the pointed bag contains coins weighing 10g: [11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] Calculate the exact weights: [11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = 50] [10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50] The balance will show equilibrium if the pointed bag contains 10g coins. If not, the balance will tip towards the heavier side, indicating that the pointed bag contains coins heavier than 10g.  Part (b) **Yes, the wise man can determine the weight of coins in the pointed bag with two weighings:** **First weighing:** 1. Take 1 coin from each of the five bags (including the pointed one). 2. Put these 5 coins on the left pan. 3. Take 4 coins from the pointed bag and put them on the right pan. This will compare: [10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4] Where ( X ) represents the type of coin in the pointed bag. Depending on the result: - If the balance is equal, the pointed bag contains 12g coins. - If the right pan is heavier, the pointed bag contains coins heavier than 12g. - If the left pan is heavier, the pointed bag contains coins lighter than 12g. **Second weighing:** 1. If coins are heavier (13g or 14g):    - Take 2 coins from each of the four other bags and place them on the left pan.    - Take 7 coins from the pointed bag and place them on the right pan. This compares: [2(10 + 11 + 12 + 13) = 7 times X] Where ( X ) represents the unknown coin type in the pointed bag. Calculate the exact weights: [2(10 + 11 + 12 + 13) = 92] For 14g: [7 times 14 = 98] For 13g: [7 times 13 = 91]  If the left pan is heavier, the pointed bag contains 14g coins. If the right pan is heavier, it contains 13g coins. 2. If coins are lighter (10g or 11g):    - Compare 10g with a similar method used in part (a). If after the first weighing it is deduced that the coins are 11g, re-verify using the first step of (a). Thus, with these steps, the wise man can determine the type of coins in the indicated bag with at most two weighings.

So we can write the equation as: x + y/2 + z + 5 = 76 We want to find out how many seashells Oliver collected on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, which is x + y + z.  To find this, we need to isolate x + y + z in the equation. We can start by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation to account for the seashells collected on Thursday: x + y/2 + z = 76 - 5 x + y/2 + z = 71 Now, we need to get rid of the division by 2 for y. To do this, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2(x + y/2 + z) = 2 * 71 2x + y + 2z = 142 Now we have an equation with 2x + y + 2z, but we want to find x + y + z. Since we have 2x and 2z, we can divide the entire equation by 2 to get the desired expression: (2x + y + 2z) / 2 = 142 / 2 x + y/2 + z = 71 But we already know from the original equation that x + y/2 + z = 71. This means that the total number of seashells Oliver collected on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (x + y + z) is the same as the total he had after Thursday minus the 5 he collected on Thursday, which is 71. Therefore, Oliver collected x + y + z = boxed{71}  seashells on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday."},{"instruction":"is known that the difference between the variables ( y ) and ( z ) is proportional to the variable ( x ), and the difference between the variables ( z ) and ( x ) is proportional to the variable ( y ).

To find the monotonic intervals, we set f′(x)=0: frac{1-ln x}{a{x}^{2}}=0 Rightarrow 1-ln x=0 Rightarrow ln x=1 Rightarrow x=e. Since a > 0, we analyze the sign of f′(x): - For 0 < x < e, we have ln x < 1 Rightarrow 1-ln x > 0 Rightarrow f′(x) > 0. - For x > e, we have ln x > 1 Rightarrow 1-ln x < 0 Rightarrow f′(x) < 0. Therefore, the monotonic increasing interval of fleft(xright) is left(0,eright), and the monotonic decreasing interval is left(e,+infty right). **(Ⅱ) Finding the range of a given fleft(xright)leqslant x-frac{1}{a}:** Given fleft(xright)leqslant x-frac{1}{a}, we have frac{ln x}{ax} leqslant x-frac{1}{a}, which simplifies to ln x - ax^{2} + x leqslant 0 for all x > 0. Let gleft(xright)=frac{ln x + x}{{x}^{2}}, then a geqslant gleft(xright) for all x > 0. Finding the maximum of g(x), we compute its derivative: g′(x)=frac{-2ln x - x + 1}{{x}^{3}}. Setting g′(x)=0 gives -2ln x - x + 1 = 0. It's clear that g′(1)=0. Let hleft(xright)=-2ln x - x + 1, then h′(x)=-frac{2}{x} - 1 < 0 for all x > 0, indicating h(x) is monotonically decreasing. Since h(1)=0, for 0 < x < 1, h(x) > 0, and for x > 1, h(x) < 0. This means g(x) increases until x=1 and then decreases, making g(1)=1 the maximum value. Therefore, the range of a is a geqslant 1, or boxed{a in left[1,+infty right)}. **(Ⅲ) Proving x_{1}+x_{2} > 2 given x_{2}ln x_{1}+x_{1}ln x_{2}=0 and x_{1}neq x_{2}:** From x_{2}ln x_{1}+x_{1}ln x_{2}=0, we can write frac{ln x_{1}}{x_{1}} + frac{ln x_{2}}{x_{2}} = 0, with x_{1} neq 1 and x_{2} neq 1. Setting a=1, consider m(x)=ln x - x^{2} + x. It's clear that m(1)=0. The derivative of m(x) is m′(x)=frac{-2x^{2} + x + 1}{x} = frac{-(x-1)(2x+1)}{x}, which is positive for 0 < x < 1 and negative for x > 1. Thus, m(1)=0 is the maximum value of m(x), implying ln x - x^{2} + x leqslant 0 for all x > 0, with equality only when x=1. Therefore, frac{ln x_{1}}{x_{1}} < x_{1} - 1 and frac{ln x_{2}}{x_{2}} < x_{2} - 1. Adding these inequalities gives frac{ln x_{1}}{x_{1}} + frac{ln x_{2}}{x_{2}} < x_{1} + x_{2} - 2, which implies x_{1} + x_{2} - 2 > 0.

First, it's asserted that after closing any two cities, the graph (cities and roads) remains connected. This means that removing two cities and their associated roads from the graph doesn't split it into separate components. 4. We can label the cities as A, B, C, D, E, and F with a structure such that any pair of cities being removed still leaves the rest connected. Assume the vertical edges (roads) are chosen for travels, depicted in the provided illustration.  5. Label the cities A, B, C red and D, E, F blue. Each chosen road must connect a city of one color to a city of the other color. If the tourist does not want to visit any city twice, they should pass through each chosen road exactly once. 6. Each time the tourist travels a chosen road, they move from a city of one color to a city of the other (from red to blue or blue to red). However, because the number of chosen roads is odd (three roads), the tourist would end in a city of the opposite color from where they started. 7.

Therefore,         7alpha = 180^circ     4. From this we get,        sin(2alpha) = sin(5alpha)            and        sin(3alpha) = sin(4alpha)     5.

Jim brought 20 and his cousin brought 10, so together they had 20 + 10 = 30. They spent 80% of their combined money, so they spent 0.80 * 30 = 24. Now let's calculate the cost of the cheeseburgers and milkshakes. Each cheeseburger costs 3 and each milkshake costs 5. Since they both ordered a cheeseburger and a milkshake, the cost for those items would be: 2 cheeseburgers = 2 * 3 = 6 2 milkshakes = 2 * 5 = 10 The total cost for the cheeseburgers and milkshakes is 6 + 10 = 16. Now we subtract the cost of the cheeseburgers and milkshakes from the total amount spent to find the cost of the cheese fries: 24 (total spent) - 16 (cheeseburgers and milkshakes) = 8 Therefore, the cheese fries cost boxed{8} ."},{"instruction":"a different hyperbola setting, the center is at (1, 3), one focus is at (1, 9), and one vertex is at (1, 0).

Part (2): Selling Price for a Daily Profit of 600 Yuan 1. Set the daily profit equation to 600 yuan:    [    (x - 30)(-2x + 140) = 600    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    -2x^2 + 140x - 60x + 1800 = 600    ]    [    -2x^2 + 80x + 1200 = 0    ]    [    x^2 - 40x - 600 = 0    ]    [    x^2 - 40x + 2400 = 0    ]     2.

Denote (DB = x), then (BC = a - x).    - The Law of Cosines in (triangle ABD) gives:  [ DA = DB = (a - x) cos(B) = c / 2] [  2(a - b) cos(B) = c ] 5. **Applying the Cosine Rule**:    - Using the cosine rule on (triangle ABC):  [  a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos(A) ]    - Substituting ( cos(A) = cos(3B) ) and using triple angle formulas:  [  cos(3B) = 4cos^3(B) - 3cos(B)  ]    - Then we solve:  [  a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc (4cos^3(B) - 3cos(B)) ] 6. **Simplification** (deducing a relevant expression for (a), (b), and (c)): [  a = 2b cos(frac{B}{2})  ] 7. **Expression** from the Cosine Rule in terms of (a), (b), and (c) (by isolating (x)): [  2(a - b) cos(B) = c ] [  (a - b) (a^2 + c^2 - b^2) = a c^2  ] 8. **Analyzing Prime Factorization**:    - Now, solving for (a), (b), and (c): [  a^3 - a^2 b - a b^3 + b^3 = b c^2  ]    - Rearranging: [ a^3 = b (a^2 + ab - b^2 + c^2) ] 9. **Prime Factor Examining**:    - If some prime (p) divides (b), then (p) divides (a^3) and thus (a).    - Given that (a), (b), and (c) are coprime, (p) cannot divide (c).    - Therefore it does not divide ((a^2 + ab - b^2 + c^2)), implying (v_p(b) = v_p(a^3)). 10. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, (b) must be a cube of some integer.

We need to find the minimum distance between P and Q during their motion, precise to 0.0001 cm. 2. **Coordinate System Setup:**     First, set up a coordinate system for the cube:     - Let A = (0, 0, 0).     - The vertices of the cube have coordinates given by:       - B = (100, 0, 0),       - C = (100, 100, 0),       - D = (0, 100, 0),       - A_1 = (0, 0, 100),       - B_1 = (100, 0, 100),       - C_1 = (100, 100, 100),       - D_1 = (0, 100, 100). 3. **Parameterize the Motion of Points:**     Let P be moving along the line AC_1 which is the space diagonal:     - ( A = (0, 0, 0) )     - ( C_1 = (100, 100, 100) )     The position of P as a function of time t (in seconds) is:     [     mathbf{P}(t) = (3t, 3t, 3t)     ]     since it travels along (100, 100, 100) at 3 cm/s.

Additionally, the condition that the digits add up to 16 means a+b+c+d=16. Given that (a+c)-(b+d) = 0 implies both a+c and b+d are equal, we can set a+c = b+d = k. Hence, 2k = 16 leading to k = 8. Therefore, a+c = 8 and b+d = 8. Let's count possible combinations: 1. If a = 1, possibilities for c range from 0 to 7, which provides 8 combinations (c = 0, 1, ..., 7). For each of these, b+d = 8, which similarly provides several combinations (0 to 8 inclusive). 2. This pattern repeats for a = 2 to 7, noting that a cannot be 8 or higher as c would be negative or zero, which is not allowed since all digits need to be positive.

Given (2pi) is irrational, this leads to contradiction. Hence, the induction is complete for (i = 0). 7. **Final Determination:**     - We find that for large enough (n), there are only two distinct arc lengths unless every basic arc length results in (n = p + q - 1).     - Calculation reveals that for (n = 1000), this condition makes the basic arcs split into (p_{19}), (q_{19}) and (p_{20}), (q_{20}), providing three different values. # Conclusion: The lengths of the basic arcs for ( n = 1000 ) take exactly three different values.

Prove that the second points of intersection of the circles are the vertices of a triangle similar to the original triangle.","output":"1. **Define the basic setup**:     Let the altitudes of the acute-angled triangle (ABC) intersect at point (H) (the orthocenter). Denote the feet of the altitudes from vertices (A), (B), and (C) as (A_0), (B_0), and (C_0) respectively. Hence, (A_0), (B_0), and (C_0) are the points where the altitudes (AA_0), (BB_0), and (CC_0) intersect the opposite sides. 2. **Position of the circles**:    Construct three circles, each passing through (H) and tangential to one side of triangle (ABC):    - The circle passing through (H) and tangent to side (BC) at point (A_0).    - The circle passing through (H) and tangent to side (AC) at point (B_0).    - The circle passing through (H) and tangent to side (AB) at point (C_0). 3. **Identify the diameters**:    Because each altitude is perpendicular to the respective side it intersects, the segments (HA_0), (HB_0), and (HC_0) are the diameters of the respective circles. This is due to the right angle subtended by the altitude at the base, making these segments diameters of the circles by the property of the right triangle inscribed in a semicircle (Thales' theorem). 4. **Intersection points and orthotriangle**:    Let the circles with diameters (HA_0) and (HB_0) intersect again at point (C_1). Since (HA_0) is a diameter, any point on the circle will view (HA_0) under a right angle:    [    angle HC_1A_0 = 90^circ    ]    This implies that point (C_1) must lie on the line (A_0B_0) because it views both diameters (HA_0) and (HB_0) under right angles, thereby intersecting them at a right angle. 5. **Similar argument for the remaining circles**:    Similarly, let the circles with diameters (HB_0) and (HC_0) intersect again at point (A_1). Then (A_1) must lie on the line (B_0C_0).    And, the circles with diameters (HA_0) and (HC_0) intersect again at point (B_1), so (B_1) must lie on the line (A_0C_0). 6. **Conclude the configuration**:        Observing these intersections, (B_1) and (C_1) are symmetric with respect to the altitudes (reflective property). Since (A_0A) is perpendicular to (BC), the line segment (C_1B_1) is parallel to (BC). Therefore, the pairs ((A_1B_1 parallel AB)), ((A_1C_1 parallel AC)), and ((B_1C_1 parallel BC)) signify that (A_1, B_1, C_1) form a triangle which is similar to the original triangle (ABC).    Given that the configuration is parallel with corresponding sides, by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem again), the triangles (A_1B_1C_1) and (ABC) are similar.

This is done repeatedly until at least one of the coins comes up heads, at which point the process stops. What is the probability that the other coin also came up heads on this last flip?","output":"1. Let the desired probability that both coins land on heads the first time we get a heads on either coin be ( p ). 2. Consider the first flip:     - There is a (frac{1}{4}) chance that both coins will come up heads (i.e., HH).     - There is a (frac{1}{4}) chance that the coins will be HT.     - There is a (frac{1}{4}) chance that the coins will be TH.     - There is a (frac{1}{4}) chance that both coins will come up tails (i.e., TT). 3. If the first flip results in HH, then the process stops, satisfying our desired event. Thus, the probability of this event occurring on the first flip is ( frac{1}{4} ). 4. If the first flip does not result in HH, and at least one coin is heads (HT or TH), the process also stops. Such events have probabilities (frac{1}{4}) each, totaling (frac{1}{2}). 5. If the first flip results in TT, the process repeats as if starting fresh, with a probability ( p ). The probability of this occurring is (frac{1}{4} times p ). 6. Summing these probabilities, we get the total probability for event HH either immediately or after any number of TT instances:     [     p = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4}p     ] 7. Solve the equation for ( p ):     [     p - frac{1}{4}p = frac{1}{4}     ]     [     frac{3}{4}p = frac{1}{4}     ]     [     p = frac{1}{4} div frac{3}{4} = frac{1}{4} times frac{4}{3} = frac{1}{3}     ] Thus, the probability that both coins will be heads when one coin first shows heads is ( boxed{frac{1}{3}} ). # Alternate Solution: 1. To provide an alternative approach, consider the desired event of both coins landing heads when at least one coin lands heads. 2. Let ( p ) again be the probability that both coins will be heads on the first instance of heads. 3. Suppose that the process continues for ( n ) successive turns where both coins are tails before landing on heads. The probability for such sequences is calculated as follows:    [    (text{Probability for 'TT'})^n times text{Probability of 'HH'}    ]    - The probability of 'TT' in each turn is ( frac{1}{4} ).    - The probability of 'HH' following any ( n ) turns of 'TT' is ( frac{1}{4} ). 4. Hence, the probability for the combined event after ( n ) turns is:    [    left(frac{1}{4}right)^{n} times frac{1}{4} = left(frac{1}{4}right)^{n + 1}    ] 5. Summing over all possible values of ( n geq 0 ), we consider:    [    p = sum_{n=0}^{infty} left(frac{1}{4}right)^{n+1}    ]     6.

Consider the set ( S = {1, 2, ldots, 3n } ). We need to prove that in any subset of ( n+2 ) elements of ( S ), there are at least two elements whose difference lies between ( n ) and ( 2n ). 2. Assume we have a subset ( T ) of ( S ) with ( |T| = n+2 ) elements. 3. To facilitate the proof, let us assume that the largest element in ( T ) is ( 3n ). If this is not the case, we can always increase some or all of the elements of ( T ) until one of them reaches ( 3n ). Since the problem only requires the difference between elements and not their absolute values, this assumption does not lose generality. 4. Consider the remaining ( n+1 ) elements in ( T ). If one of these elements lies in the set ( {n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n+1} ), then the problem is solved as the difference between ( 3n ) and any of those elements is at least ( n ) and at most ( 2n ). 5. Assume none of the remaining ( n+1 ) elements lie in ( {n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n+1} ). Therefore, all these ( n+1 ) elements must lie in pairs mentioned as follows:    [    (1, 2n), (2, 2n+1), (3, 2n+2), ldots, (n, 3n-1).    ] 6. From the Pigeonhole Principle, if we choose ( n+1 ) numbers from ( n ) pairs, at least one of these pairs must contain two elements from our subset ( T ). These elements are picked from our pairs which fit within the range mentioned, so their differences satisfy the condition ( n leq |a - b| leq 2n ). 7. To prove this again with an alternative method, consider a circle that is divided into ( 3n ) equal parts, labelled ( 1, 2, ldots, 3n ), in counterclockwise order. Colour any ( n+2 ) points black, the rest white. 8. These ( n+2 ) black points must have at least one arc between them that is at least (frac{1}{3}) of the circle (since if all arcs were less than (frac{1}{3}), there would not be space for all points). 9. Any arc in this context corresponds to a difference which fits between ( n ) and ( 2n ). If this was not the case, by symmetry and distribution, the arcs would contradict the requirements of the pigeonhole principle. 10. The maximal arc not containing black points, noted as an unbroken section (free arc), if less than (frac{2}{3}) fills the complementary requirement. 11. Given the constraints and hypothetical contradiction negations, we ascertain the longest free arc indeed provides the covering ( n ) to ( 2n ) requirement. 12.

Since the width is half the length, we can express the length as 2y. 2. **Calculate Base Area:**    The base area A of the rectangular parallelepiped is:        A = text{length} times text{width} = 2y cdot y = 2y^2     3. **Express Volume Increase:**    The volume of water added, 76 hectoliters (where 1 hectoliter = 0.1 cubic meters), is:        text{Volume added} = 76 times 0.1 text{ m}^3 = 7.6 text{ m}^3        When this volume is added, the water level rises by 0.38 meters. Therefore, the increase in volume can also be expressed in terms of the base area and the height increase:        0.38 cdot 2y^2 = 7.6     4. **Solve for ( y^2 ):**    Solving for y^2:        0.38 cdot 2y^2 = 7.6            0.76y^2 = 7.6            y^2 = frac{7.6}{0.76} = 10            y = sqrt{10}     5. **Determine Initial and Final Filled Heights:**    Originally, the reservoir was filled to three-eighths of its height, so the initial volume V_{text{initial}} was:        V_{text{initial}} = frac{3}{8} cdot text{height} cdot 2y^2 cdot x = frac{3}{8} cdot 2 cdot 10 cdot x = frac{60x}{8} = 7.5x        After adding 76 hectoliters, the reservoir is filled to five-sevenths of its height, so the new volume V_{text{final}} is:        V_{text{final}} = frac{5}{7} cdot text{height} cdot 2y^2 cdot x = frac{5}{7} cdot 2 cdot 10 cdot x = frac{100x}{7}     6. **Calculate Height Increase:**    Set up the equation using the given volume addition:        V_{text{final}} - V_{text{initial}} = 7.6 text{ m}^3            frac{100x}{7} - frac{60x}{8} = 7.6        Combine terms:        frac{800x}{56} - frac{420x}{56} = 7.6            frac{380x}{56} = 7.6        Simplify:        frac{190x}{28} = 7.6            190x = 7.6 times 28            190x = 212.8        Solve for x:        x = frac{212.8}{190} = frac{212.8}{190} = 1.12     **Conclusion:** The height of the reservoir is approximately: boxed{1.12 text{ m}}"},{"instruction":"ABCDEFGH is a rectangular prism with side lengths AB=AD=AE=1, BC=2, and EH=3.

The cheapest food item is the roll at 0.60, and the cheapest drink is the juice pack at 0.50. The total cost for the cheapest food and drink combination is: 0.60 (roll) + 0.50 (juice pack) = 1.10 per person Since Lyle has to spend at least 10 on food items, let's first calculate how many food items he can get with 10: 10 / 0.60 (roll) = approximately 16 rolls This means Lyle can buy food for at least 16 people with 10. However, he also needs to buy drinks for each person. Let's see how many complete food and drink combinations he can afford with his total budget of 12.50: 12.50 / 1.10 (food and drink combination) = approximately 11 combinations Since he can't buy a fraction of a combination, he can afford 11 combinations. However, we need to check if spending 1.10 for 11 people will allow us to meet the condition of spending at least 10 on food. 11 people x 0.60 (roll) = 6.60 on rolls 11 people x 0.50 (juice pack) = 5.50 on juice packs Total spent on 11 people = 6.60 (rolls) + 5.50 (juice packs) = 12.10 This exceeds the total budget of 12.50, so we need to reduce the number of people by one to see if we can meet the budget and the condition of spending at least 10 on food. 10 people x 0.60 (roll) = 6.00 on rolls 10 people x 0.50 (juice pack) = 5.00 on juice packs Total spent on 10 people = 6.00 (rolls) + 5.00 (juice packs) = 11.00 Now we have 1.50 left from the total budget (12.50 - 11.00), which we can't use to buy another full combination of food and drink.

Since A must be scheduled before the other two, we only need to consider the order of B and C after A. There are 5 days in total, and we need to choose 3 different days for A, B, and C, which can be done in binom{5}{3} ways. After choosing the days, there are 3! ways to arrange the three volunteers, but since A must be before B and C, we divide by 2 to exclude the arrangements where A is not the first among the three. Therefore, the total number of different scheduling methods is: binom{5}{3} times frac{3!}{2} = 10 times 3 = 30 However, this calculation does not consider the constraint that A must be scheduled before B and C. To correctly account for this, we note that once the days for A, B, and C are chosen, A's position is fixed as the earliest among the three chosen days.

Then, according to the problem, b subscribes x + 5,000 and a subscribes (x + 5,000) + 4,000 = x + 9,000. The total amount they subscribed for the business is: a + b + c = (x + 9,000) + (x + 5,000) + x = 3x + 14,000 The profit is distributed in the ratio of their subscriptions. So, the ratio of a's share to the total profit is the same as the ratio of a's subscription to the total subscription. The ratio of a's share to the total profit is: a's share / total profit = 15,120 / 36,000 The ratio of a's subscription to the total subscription is: a's subscription / total subscription = (x + 9,000) / (3x + 14,000) Since these ratios are equal, we can set them equal to each other and solve for x: (15,120 / 36,000) = (x + 9,000) / (3x + 14,000) Simplify the left side of the equation: 15,120 / 36,000 = 0.42 Now we have: 0.42 = (x + 9,000) / (3x + 14,000) Cross-multiply to solve for x: 0.42 * (3x + 14,000) = x + 9,000 Expand the left side: 1.26x + 5,880 = x + 9,000 Subtract x from both sides: 0.26x + 5,880 = 9,000 Subtract 5,880 from both sides: 0.26x = 3,120 Divide both sides by 0.26 to solve for x: x = 3,120 / 0.26 x = 12,000 Now we know c's subscription is Rs. 12,000.

First, let's calculate the probability that both balls are green. There are 9 green balls, so the probability of drawing one green ball is 9/17 (since there are 17 balls in total). After drawing one green ball, there are now 8 green balls left and 16 balls in total. So the probability of drawing a second green ball is 8/16. The probability of both events happening (drawing two green balls) is the product of the individual probabilities: P(both green) = (9/17) * (8/16) Now, let's calculate the probability that both balls are white. There are 8 white balls, so the probability of drawing one white ball is 8/17. After drawing one white ball, there are now 7 white balls left and 16 balls in total. So the probability of drawing a second white ball is 7/16. The probability of both events happening (drawing two white balls) is the product of the individual probabilities: P(both white) = (8/17) * (7/16) To find the total probability that both balls are of the same color, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios: P(same color) = P(both green) + P(both white) P(same color) = (9/17 * 8/16) + (8/17 * 7/16) Now, let's calculate the values: P(both green) = (9/17) * (8/16) = 72/272 P(both white) = (8/17) * (7/16) = 56/272 P(same color) = 72/272 + 56/272 = 128/272 To simplify, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 16: P(same color) = 128/272 = 8/17 So, the probability that both balls drawn are of the same color is boxed{8/17} ."},{"instruction":"Find   int_{  1}^1 {nchoose k}(1 + x)^{n  k}(1  x)^k dx (k = 0, 1, 2, cdots n) .","output":"1.

We know that in an equilateral triangle, the height ( h ) can be written in terms of the side length ( s ) as:    [    h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} s    ]     4. **Consider a line parallel to one of the sides through point ( P ):**        Draw a line through ( P ) that is parallel to one side of the triangle, say ( BC ).

It ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 or -1 indicate a strong linear relationship. Therefore, if two variables are linearly related, a stronger correlation implies that the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is closer to 1. This makes proposition (1) correct. **For (2):** In a normal distribution curve, mu represents the mean, and sigma represents the standard deviation, which measures the dispersion of the data points around the mean. A smaller sigma means that the data points are more closely clustered around the mean, leading to a more concentrated distribution. Conversely, a larger sigma indicates that the data points are more spread out, resulting in a more dispersed distribution. Thus, proposition (2) is correct. **For (3):** The k^{2} statistic is used in the context of categorical data to test the independence of two variables. A larger k^{2} value suggests a stronger evidence against the null hypothesis of independence, implying a higher credibility that the variables A and B are related. Therefore, proposition (3) is correct. **For (4):** In regression analysis, the sum of squared residuals measures the discrepancy between the observed and predicted values. A smaller sum of squared residuals indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual data points. The R^{2} statistic, or the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). A larger R^{2} value suggests a better fit of the model to the data.

The mouse moves forward except when it reaches a piece of cheese; it eats part of the cheese, turns right, and continues moving forward. We define a subset of cells containing cheese as good if the mouse tastes each piece of cheese exactly once and then falls off the table. Show that: (a) No good subset consists of 888 cells. (b) There exists a good subset consisting of at least 666 cells.","output":"(a) No good subset consists of 888 cells. 1. **Assumption and Observation:**    - Assume for contradiction that there exists a good subset consisting of 888 cheese cells.    - The cells that do not contain cheese are termed *gap-cells*.    - The mouse can visit each cheese cell exactly once, and each gap-cell at most twice in its uninterrupted journey through the table. 2. **Sequence Definition:**    - Define a sequence ( s ) whose ( i )-th element is ( C ) if in the ( i )-th step of the mouse's path it steps onto a cheese-cell and ( G ) if it steps onto a gap-cell.    - According to the assumption, there are 888 steps that correspond to cheese cells, i.e., ( s ) contains 888 ( C )'s. 3. **Block Formation:**    - The sequence cannot have a block of 4 or more contiguous ( C )'s because the mouse must turn right after reaching a cheese cell, thereby requiring it to encounter a gap cell soon after.    - Consequently, the longest continuous block of ( C )'s we can have alternates with every 3 cheese cells followed by at least one gap cell.  4. **Counting Blocks:**    - So, ( s ) contains at least ( 888 / 3 = 296 ) such blocks of ( C )'s.    - Hence, there are at least 295 ( G )'s in ( s ). 5. **Gap Cells Estimation:**    - Each gap cell can be visited at most twice, implying there must be at least ( lceil 295 / 2 rceil = 148 ) gap cells. 6. **Total Cell Count:**    - Adding the cheese cells and gap cells, the total number of cells required is ( 888 + 148 = 1036 ). 7. **Contradiction:**    - The total number of cells in a ( 32 times 32 ) table is 1024, which is less than 1036. **Conclusion for (a):**    - Thus, our assumption is false, and no good subset can consist of 888 cells.    - (boxed{})  (b) There exists a good subset consisting of at least 666 cells. 1. **Tile Definitions:**    - Define ( L_i ) as a ( 2^i times 2^i ) tile that allows the mouse to \\"turn left\\" and ( X_i ) as a tile that allows the mouse to \\"cross\\" from one edge to another.    - Specifically, \\"turn left\\" tiles let the mouse enter at its bottom left facing up and leave at bottom left facing left.    - \\"Cross\\" tiles allow the mouse to enter at its top right facing down and leave at its bottom left facing left and also enter at its bottom left facing up and leave at its top right facing right. 2. **Inductive Construction:**    - Using the inductive construction, given ( L_i ) and ( X_i ), form larger tiles ( L_{i+1} ) and ( X_{i+1} ) such that ( L_{i+1} ) and ( X_{i+1} ) tiles maintain these crossing and turning properties. 3. **Cheese Count via Induction:**    - Let ( |T| ) denote the number of cheese pieces in tile ( T ).    - By straightforward induction, we derive:      [      |L_i| = |X_i| + 1       ]      [      |L_{i+1}| = 4 cdot |L_i| - 1      ]    - Using the initial condition ( |L_1| = 3 ). 4. **Specific Values:**    - Compute the counts for higher indices:      [      |L_2| = 4 cdot 3 - 1 = 11      ]      [      |L_3| = 4 cdot 11 - 1 = 43      ]      [      |L_4| = 4 cdot 43 - 1 = 171      ]      [      |L_5| = 4 cdot 171 - 1 = 683      ] **Conclusion for (b):**    - Therefore, there indeed exists a good subset consisting of at least 666 cells of cheese.    - (boxed{})  Another Proof of (a): - Let ( X_N ) be the largest possible density of cheese-cells in a good subset on an ( N times N ) table. - Claim ( X_{32} leq frac{4}{5} + o(1) ), showing the cheese density cannot exceed (frac{4}{5}). - Because the mouse must cross itself (or another path) at certain points, requiring empty squares (gap cells), we have the upper limit on the density. - Specifically, for ( N = 32 ):   [   X_{32} leq frac{817}{1024}   ] This alternate proof aligns with the conclusion that a subset of 888 cells is impossible due to constraints imposed by necessary crossings and gap cells."},{"instruction":"Given the function fleft(xright)=ae^{x}bxcleft(0 lt a lt 1,b gt 0right).

Analyzing the sign of f'(x): - For x < 0, we have e^x < 1, so e^x - 1 < 0. Therefore, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (-infty, 0). - For x > 0, we have e^x > 1, so e^x - 1 > 0. Therefore, f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing in (0, +infty). Since f(x) transitions from decreasing to increasing at x = 0, f(x) reaches its minimum value at x = 0. Substituting x = 0 into f(x) gives the minimum value as f(0) = a - c. Thus, the extreme value of f(x) when a = b is boxed{a - c}, with no maximum value.  Part (2): Proving the Inequality Given x_1 and x_2 are zeros of f(x), with x_1 > x_2, we set e^{x_1} = t_1 and e^{x_2} = t_2, implying t_1 > t_2 and thus m = frac{t_1}{t_2} > 1. From the zeros of f(x), we have: - at_1 - bln t_1 - c = 0 - at_2 - bln t_2 - c = 0 Taking the difference of these equations gives a(t_1 - t_2) = blnfrac{t_1}{t_2}, leading to frac{t_1 - t_2}{lnfrac{t_1}{t_2}} = frac{b}{a}. To prove frac{e^{x_1}}{a} + frac{e^{x_2}}{1-a} > frac{4b}{a}, we equivalently need to show lnfrac{t_1}{t_2} > frac{4a(1-a)(t_1-t_2)}{(1-a)t_1 + at_2}. Let g(m) = ln m - frac{4a(1-a)(m-1)}{(1-a)m + a}, for m > 1. Differentiating g(m) with respect to m gives g'(m) = frac{[(1-a)m - a]^2}{m[(1-a)m + a]^2} geq 0. Since g'(m) geq 0 for m > 1, g(m) is monotonically increasing on (1, +infty). Therefore, g(m) > g(1) = 0, which implies frac{e^{x_1}}{a} + frac{e^{x_2}}{1-a} > frac{4b}{a}.

Thus:    [    b^2 + c^2 = a^2 + 10    ] 4. **Equation Transformation:**    Given that a = b + c, we can rewrite the requirement for the sum of the squares:    [    b^2 + c^2 = a^2 + 10    ]    Squaring both sides of a = b + c, we get:    [    (b + c)^2 = b^2 + c^2 + 2bc    ]    Hence,    [    b^2 + c^2 - 10 = (b + c)^2 = b^2 + c^2 + 2bc     ]    Therefore,    [    b^2 + c^2 + 2bc = b^2 + c^2 - 10    ]    Simplifying, we find:    [    2bc = -10 implies bc = -5    ] 5. **Possible Values of b and c:**    To satisfy b+c = a and bc = -5, let's solve for b and c given specific values:    - If a = 4, then b and c should satisfy:      [      bc = -5 quad text{and} quad b + c = 4      ]      Solutions include (b, c) = (5, -1) or (b, c) = (-1, 5).    - If a = -4, then b and c should satisfy:      [      bc = -5 quad text{and} quad b + c = -4      ]      Solutions include (b, c) = (-5, 1) or (b, c) = (1, -5). 6. **Verification:**      We can verify possible solutions:    - Replacing 4 with 5 and -1 or -1 and 5.    - Replacing -4 with -5 and 1 or 1 and -5. **Conclusion:**   To keep the arithmetic mean and variance unchanged, you need to replace (-4) with (-5) and (1) or (1) and (-5), or replace (4) with (5) and (-1). (boxed{text{Replace -4 with 1 and -5 or replace 4 with -1 and 5}})"},{"instruction":"The expansion of (x+1)^n has 3 consecutive terms with coefficients in the ratio 1:2:3 that can be written in the form[{nchoose k} : {nchoose k+1} : {n choose k+2}]Find the sum of all possible values of n+k.","output":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of the coefficients in the expansion of (x+1)^n.

For the first 40 hours, he earns ( R ) dollars per hour, so his earnings for these hours are ( 40R ). For overtime, which is any time worked over 40 hours, he earns twice his regular rate, so his overtime rate is ( 2R ) dollars per hour.

His total earnings for the week are the sum of his regular earnings and his overtime earnings, which is ( 40R + 10R ). We know that his total earnings for the week were 210, so we can set up the following equation: [ 40R + 10R = 210 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 50R = 210 ] Now, we can solve for ( R ) by dividing both sides of the equation by 50: [ R = frac{210}{50} ] [ R = 4.2 ] Therefore, Edward's hourly rate for the first 40 hours is boxed{4.20} ."},{"instruction":"Suppose the polynomial g(x) = x^{2007}  2x^{2006} + 2.

In this case, it must be either two pure vertices or two impure vertices consecutively. 5. **Conclusion for pure vertices:**     - Suppose two consecutive vertices P = (x_1, y_1) and Q = (x_2, y_2) are pure.     - Since P and Q are pure, their coordinates x_1, y_1, x_2, and y_2 all have the same parity. 6. **Midpoint of pure vertices:**     - The midpoint (M) of these vertices P and Q is given by:     [     M = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right)     ]     - Because x_1 and x_2 share the same parity, (x_1 + x_2) is even, and the same logic applies for y_1 and y_2. Thus, the coordinates of the midpoint M will be integers.     - This contradicts the problem statement that no side has a midpoint with integer coordinates. 7. **Conclusion for impure vertices:**     - Alternatively, suppose two consecutive vertices P = (x_1, y_1) and Q = (x_2, y_2) are impure.     - Since P and Q are impure, their coordinates x_1, y_1, x_2, and y_2 have opposite parities. 8. **Midpoint of impure vertices:**     - The midpoint (M) of these vertices P and Q is given by:     [     M = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right)     ]     - Because x_1 and x_2 have opposite parity, (x_1 + x_2) is odd, and the same logic applies for y_1 and y_2.

Let us denote the circle by k and consider an arbitrary line segment widetilde{A B} on the circumference of the circle that bisects the circle into two equal areas. 2. First, note that if A and B are diametrically opposite points on the circle, the line widetilde{A B} bisects the circle. In this case, the arc widetilde{A B} is clearly longer than the chord A B, which has a length equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the length of widetilde{A B} is greater than the diameter of the circle. This corresponds to: [ text{arc length } widetilde{A B} > text{diameter of the circle} ] 3. Now, we consider the case where A and B are not diametrically opposite. In this situation, identify the unique diameter PQ that is parallel to the chord AB. If A coincides with B, take PQ as the diameter parallel to the tangent at that point. 4. Since A and B are on the same side of the diameter PQ, and widetilde{A B} bisects the circle's area, the arc widetilde{A B} must pass through the semicircle on the opposite side of PQ. 5. There exists a point M on widetilde{AB} that lies on PQ. Reflect the segment widetilde{MB} over PQ and denote the reflected segment as widetilde{MB'}. Then A and B' are diametrically opposite points on the circle because: [ angle PA = angle BQ = angle QB' ] 6. If we join the segments widetilde{AM} and widetilde{MB'}, we obtain an arc widetilde{AB'} that is at least as long as the arc widetilde{AB} and certainly longer than the diameter AB' of the circle. 7. Since widetilde{AB'} is constructed from widetilde{AM} and widetilde{MB'}, and widetilde{MB} is equal in length to widetilde{MB'} due to the reflection, it follows that: [ text{arc length } widetilde{AB} = text{arc length } widetilde{AB'} ] Thus, the line segment widetilde{AB}, which bisects the circle, must be: [ text{arc length } widetilde{AB} > text{diameter of the circle} ] In conclusion, we have proven that if an arc bisects the area of a circle, its length is indeed longer than the diameter of the circle. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given the joint density function of the continuous twodimensional random variable (X, Y): [ f(x, y)=  begin{cases} 4 x y e^{x^{2}y^{2}} & (x>0, y>0)  0 & (x<0 , text{or} , y<0). end{cases} ] Find:  a) Expectations (means) of X and Y.  b) Variances of X and Y.","output":"Part (a): Finding the expected value of X and Y 1. **Find marginal density function ( f_X(x) ) for ( X )**:    [    f_X(x) = int_{0}^{infty} f(x, y) , dy    ]    Given ( f(x, y) = 4xy e^{-x^2 - y^2} ) for ( x>0 ) and ( y>0 ), we have:    [    f_X(x) = int_{0}^{infty} 4xy e^{-x^2 - y^2} , dy    ] 2. **Evaluate the integral**:    [    f_X(x) = 4x e^{-x^2} int_{0}^{infty} y e^{-y^2} , dy    ]    Using the integral ( int_{0}^{infty} y e^{-y^2} , dy ), which is a known integral result in the form of ( frac{1}{2} ):    [    f_X(x) = 4x e^{-x^2} times frac{1}{2} = 2x e^{-x^2} quad text{for} quad x > 0    ] 3. **By symmetry, find ( f_Y(y) )**:    [    f_Y(y) = int_{0}^{infty} f(x, y) , dx = 2y e^{-y^2} quad text{for} quad y > 0    ] 4. **Find the expected value of ( X )**:    [    E(X) = int_{0}^{infty} x f_X(x) , dx = int_{0}^{infty} x left( 2x e^{-x^2} right) , dx    ]    [    E(X) = 2 int_{0}^{infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} , dx    ] 5. **Simplify by using the substitution ( u = x^2 )**:    [    int_{0}^{infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} , dx = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{infty} u^{1/2-1} e^{-u} , du    ]    The integral is now in the form of the Gamma function ( Gamma left( frac{3}{2} right) = frac{1}{2} sqrt{pi} ):    [    2 times frac{1}{2} Gamma left( frac{3}{2} right) = 2 times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} sqrt{pi} = sqrt{pi}/2    ] 6. **By symmetry, ( E(Y) = sqrt{pi}/2 )**:    [    E(Y) = sqrt{pi}/2    ] Therefore: [ E(X) = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2}, quad E(Y) = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2} ]  Part (b): Finding the variance of ( X ) and ( Y ) 1. **Find the variance of ( X )**:    [    text{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2    ] 2. **Calculate ( E(X^2) )**:    [    E(X^2) = int_{0}^{infty} x^2 f_X(x) , dx = int_{0}^{infty} x^2 left( 2x e^{-x^2} right) , dx    ]    [    E(X^2) = 2 int_{0}^{infty} x^3 e^{-x^2} , dx    ] 3. **Simplify by using the substitution ( u=x^2 )**:    [    int_{0}^{infty} x^3 e^{-x^2} , dx = frac{1}{2} int_{0}^{infty} u e^{-u} , du    ]    The integral is now in the form of the Gamma function ( Gamma(2) = 1! = 1 ):    [    2 times frac{1}{2} times 1 = 1    ] 4. **Find ( E(X)^2 )**:    [    [E(X)]^2 = left( frac{sqrt{pi}}{2} right)^2 = frac{pi}{4}    ] 5. **Calculate variance**:    [    text{Var}(X) = 1 - frac{pi}{4}    ] Thus: [ text{Var}(X) = 1 - frac{pi}{4}, quad text{Var}(Y) = 1 - frac{pi}{4} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{E(X) = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2},  E(Y) = frac{sqrt{pi}}{2},  text{Var}(X) = 1 - frac{pi}{4},  text{Var}(Y) = 1 - frac{pi}{4}} ]"},{"instruction":"Consider the cubic equation x^3 + 3x^2  4x  12 = 0.

Calculating DF: [ DF = sqrt{(-2-0)^{2} + left(frac{10}{3}-frac{11}{4}right)^{2}} ] [ DF = sqrt{4 + left(frac{40}{12}-frac{33}{12}right)^{2}} = sqrt{4 + frac{49}{144}} ] [ DF = sqrt{frac{576}{144} + frac{49}{144}} = sqrt{frac{625}{144}} ] [ DF = frac{25}{12} ] Thus, the length of DF is boxed{frac{25}{12}}. - **(2)** For any point P(a, frac{1}{3}a^{2}+2) on the parabola, the distance FP is: [ FP = sqrt{(a-0)^{2} + left(frac{1}{3}a^{2}+2-2right)^{2}} = sqrt{a^{2} + left(frac{1}{3}a^{2}right)^{2}} ] [ FP = sqrt{a^{2} + frac{1}{9}a^{4}} = sqrt{frac{9}{9}a^{2} + frac{1}{9}a^{4}} = sqrt{frac{1}{9}a^{4} + a^{2}} ] [ FP = sqrt{left(frac{1}{3}a^{2}right)^{2} + a^{2}} = frac{1}{3}a^{2} + 2 ] Thus, the length of segment FP is equal to the ordinate of point P, proving the conjecture. - **(3)** A parabola can be seen as boxed{text{the set of points whose distance to a fixed point is equal to the distance to a fixed line}}."},{"instruction":"Given the functions f(x)=ln x frac{1}{4}x+ frac{3}{4x}1 and g(x)=x^22bx+4.

Determine the range of the real number b.","output":"Let us first investigate the behavior of the function f(x) in order to understand its minimum value on the interval (0,2). To do this, we find the derivative of f(x) and analyze the sign of the derivative to determine intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing. We have: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( ln x- frac{1}{4}x+ frac{3}{4x}-1 right) = frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{4} - frac{3}{4x^2}. Upon further simplification, we can write the derivative as: f'(x) = - frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{4x^2} = - frac{(x-1)(x-3)}{4x^2}. By analyzing the roots of the quadratic in the numerator, we find that f(x) is an increasing function for 1 < x < 3 and decreasing for x > 3 or 0 < x < 1. Since we're interested in the interval (0,2), we must evaluate the function at the boundary where it switches from decreasing to increasing to find the minimum value, which occurs at x=1: f_{text{min}}(x) = f(1) = -frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{4} - 1 = -frac{1}{2}. Now, consider the behavior of g(x) = x^2 - 2bx + 4. We observe that g(x) can be rewritten as: g(x) = (x-b)^2 + 4 - b^2, which is a parabola with the axis of symmetry at x=b. Analyzing g(x) within the interval [1,2] leads to three different scenarios for its minimum value based on the value of b: 1. If b leqslant 1, g(x) achieves its minimum at x=1:    g_{text{min}}(x) = g(1) = 5 - 2b. 2. If 1 < b < 2, g(x) achieves its minimum at x=b:    g_{text{min}}(x) = g(b) = 4 - b^2. 3. If b geqslant 2, g(x) is decreasing on [1,2], and its minimum occurs at x=2:    g_{text{min}}(x) = g(2) = 8 - 4b. According to the problem statement, for the inequality f(x_1) geqslant g(x_2) to hold for any x_1 in (0,2) and some x_2 in [1,2], the minimum of f(x) must be greater than or equal to the minimum of g(x). Applying this to the different scenarios for g(x): - When b leqslant 1, -frac{1}{2} geqslant 5 - 2b, which yields b geqslant frac{11}{4}; but since b must be less than or equal to 1, there is no solution in this case. - When 1 < b < 2, -frac{1}{2} geqslant 4 - b^2 implies that b must be greater than or equal to frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} or less than or equal to -frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}. However, since b is between 1 and 2, there is no solution in this range. - When b geqslant 2, -frac{1}{2} geqslant 8 - 4b leads to b geqslant frac{17}{8}.

Show that  angle HAL=angle DAL  if and only if  angle BAC=90^{circ} .","output":"1. **Given**: In a triangle triangle ABC with angle B > angle C, the altitude, the angle bisector, and the median from A intersect BC at H, L, and D, respectively. We need to show that angle HAL = angle DAL if and only if angle BAC = 90^{circ}. 2. **Construction**: Extend AD to E such that AD = DE. Extend AH to F such that AH = HF. This construction implies that ABEC is a parallelogram because AD = DE and AB = EC. 3. **Properties of Parallelogram**: In parallelogram ABEC, we have AB = EC and BC parallel EF. Notice that BF is not parallel to CE, which implies that CEFB is an isosceles trapezium. Hence, C, E, F, B are concyclic (they lie on the same circle). 4. **Angle Relationships**: Given angle HAL = angle DAL, we need to show that angle BAC = 90^{circ}. Since C, E, F, B are concyclic, we have:    [    angle DAC = angle DEB = angle HAB = angle HFB    ]    This implies that A, C, F, B are concyclic. Therefore, the five points A, C, E, F, B are concyclic. 5. **Inscribed Parallelogram**: Since ABEC is a parallelogram and it is inscribed in a circle, it must be a rectangle. This is because the only parallelogram that can be inscribed in a circle is a rectangle. Hence, angle BAC = 90^{circ}. 6. **Converse**: If angle BAC = 90^{circ}, then by easy calculation, we can verify that angle HAL = angle DAL. This is because in a right triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse creates two similar right triangles, and the angle bisector and median properties hold symmetrically.

First, let's simplify the term inside the parentheses:    [    frac{1}{ab} + frac{1}{ac} + frac{1}{bc}    ]    To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is (abc):    [    frac{c}{abc} + frac{b}{abc} + frac{a}{abc} = frac{c + b + a}{abc}    ] 2. Now we have:    [    left(frac{c + b + a}{abc}right) cdot frac{ab}{a^2 - (b+c)^2}.    ] 3. Simplify the second part of the expression:    [    frac{ab}{a^2 - (b+c)^2}    ]    Note that:    [    a^2 - (b+c)^2 = a^2 - (b^2 + 2bc + c^2)    ] 4. Using the difference of squares formula ((a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b))), we get:    [    a^2 - (b^2 + 2bc + c^2) = (a + b + c)(a - b - c)    ]    Now we have:    [    frac{ab}{(a + b + c)(a - b - c)}.    ] 5. Now, multiply the simplified versions together:    [    left(frac{c + b + a}{abc}right) cdot frac{ab}{(a+b+c)(a-b-c)}    ] 6. Notice that the (a + b + c) terms will cancel out:    [    frac{c+b+a}{abc} cdot frac{ab}{(a+b+c)(a-b-c)} = frac{1}{c(a-b-c)}.    ] 7. The final simplified expression is therefore:    [    boxed{frac{1}{c(a-b-c)}}    ]"},{"instruction":"Tom has 30 violet balloons, he gave Fred some of the balloons. He now has 14 violet balloons.

Did you know there are pros of listening to music while studying? In my essay, I will discuss how music helps you when studying! Research has shown music has a strong effect on us. Surprisingly, music genres are important. The right genre of music can help you focus, improve concentration, and block distractions. They studied which music is the most relaxing, and it was found that harmonious sounds were the most relaxing and also led to a decrease in stress. Studying may be stressful, and may increase anxiety, so that is why I think it is much better to listen to music while studying or doing work. Music also can be good for you because it can clear all the stress in your mind and body. Music, one of the most universal and beloved forms of art, has a fascinating history. Its exact origins remain a mystery. However, reliable sources believe that music gained popularity during the Paleolithic period. Despite this, we still do not know who invented music. The oldest known musical composition is the \\"Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal\\" In the past, there was a popular theory that listening to Mozart or classical music could increase a child's intelligence. However, there is no solid scientific evidence to support this claim. Despite this, classical music is very much recommended. However, silence may be a better option when it comes to studying. Memory tasks are better performed in a quiet environment, according to research conducted by King's Christian College. Additionally, silence can help to lower blood pressure and promote relaxation. So next time, consider turning off the music and tuning into the sound of silence for better concentration and calmness. I recommend listening to ambient or instrumental music! Ambient music is like white noise mixed with music. White noise is disruptive sounds in the environment. Instrumental music, on the other hand, is the sound of relaxing instruments playing. Music made by Mozart is instrumental, and I recommend listening to his songs while doing schoolwork. It was found that listening to fast-paced music increases anxiety, which means the tempo of music is also important so you can concentrate. Also, reading lyrics from songs that describe how you are feeling or lyrics that mean a lot to you, can make you feel better! However, if it is a reading work, it is said that it is better to listen to music without lyrics. Listening to music can change your mood. Which means it has a big impact on depression or anxiety. As I said studying may be stressful, and increase anxiety, so music helps a lot. They did research and found out that if you listen to music you like, it can reduce cortisol levels. For example, President Obama listens to jazz before his speeches to relax them. Music has a profound effect on the human mind. Did you also know that music therapy helps repair brain damage? It has been hypothesized that music therapy could be responsible for the birth of new brain cells. The University of Maryland Global Campus says the best way to stay focused is to listen to music. They said there were higher scores for mental wellbeing. So, if you're looking for a complete mental workout, why not try turning on your favorite song? It increases your productivity. Which is good to tackle important tasks. Whether you prefer classical, pop, or rock music, listening to your favorite tunes can help stimulate your brain and improve your overall abilities. So next time you're not in a good mood, turn up the volume and give your brain the boost it needs!","output":"The text you provided exhibits characteristics that could be attributed to both AI and human writing, making it a bit challenging to categorize definitively without more context. However, based on certain indicators, it leans more toward what might be expected from an advanced AI-generated text. Here’s why: 1. **Broad and Generalized Statements**: The text makes several broad claims about music, its history, and its effects on studying and mental health without providing specific studies or evidence to back up these claims. This style is common in AI-generated texts that synthesize information from diverse sources. 2. **Lack of Personal Insight or Experience**: Even though the text is structured like a personal essay, it lacks personal anecdotes or insights that would typically reflect an individual's unique experiences or opinions about listening to music while studying. AI-generated texts often lack personal depth. 3. **Surface-Level Transition between Topics**: The transitions between topics, such as the history of music, the impact of music on studying, and recommendations on what music to listen to, are somewhat abrupt and surface-level. Human writing, especially in essays, tends to offer smoother and more logically connected transitions based on deeper analysis or personal narrative. 4. **Inclusion of Dubious or Generic Facts**: Mentioning facts like President Obama listening to jazz before speeches or the claim about music therapy repairing brain damage without specifying sources is characteristic of AI attempting to add credibility or interest to the text but doing so in a way that might not meet academic or journalistic standards. 5. **Repetitive Phrasing and Ideas**: There is a repetition of the main idea—that music impacts mood and studying—without significantly deepening the argument or introducing new evidence. AI-generated texts can sometimes circle around the same point in different words. While advanced AI can produce highly coherent and structured texts, the nuances of personal voice, deep critical analysis, and seamless integration of diverse pieces of evidence are challenging to replicate fully. Therefore, while this text has the appearance of a carefully structured essay, the lack of depth, personal insight, and reliance on generalized statements suggest it might be AI-generated.

Here are a few observations: 1. **Repetitiveness**: The text repeats several points, such as the independence developed through homework and its motivational aspects. Both AI and inexperienced human writers can fall into repetitive patterns, but the specific manner of repetition here—without deeper elaboration or new insights—leans slightly more towards an AI's approach to ensure topic coverage. 2. **Lack of Depth**: The arguments presented are relatively surface-level, lacking in-depth analysis or evidence. This could be seen in texts produced by AI, which might not engage in deep analysis, or it might be indicative of a beginner human writer not yet skilled in developing complex arguments. 3. **Contradictory Statements**: The text both critiques and supports homework without effectively reconciling or exploring these opposing views. While this could be a strategic choice in human writing, the execution here seems more characteristic of AI attempting to cover multiple perspectives without a clear strategy for integrating them. 4. **Generalized Statements without Specific Examples**: The points made are quite general, without specific examples or evidence. This is common in both AI-generated content, which might not have access to detailed examples, and in writing by individuals who are still learning how to effectively incorporate examples into their work. 5. **Structure and Coherence**: The essay follows a basic structure but lacks coherence in connecting its various parts (introduction, body paragraphs with arguments, and conclusion). This disjointedness can be found in both AI-generated texts and human-written texts, especially from those still mastering essay writing. 6. **Simplistic Language and Style**: The writing style is simple and straightforward, which is typical of AI but can also be characteristic of a human writer who is either writing in a non-native language or is at an early stage of learning how to write essays. Given the mixed indicators and the fact that AI-generated texts are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making them sometimes indistinguishable from human writing, it's challenging to definitively categorize this text without more context. Nonetheless, aspects of the writing suggest a higher probability of AI authorship, particularly due to the repetitiveness, lack of depth, and formulaic structure.

It is the art of folding paper to make 2- or 3-dimensional shapes! The name “origami” comes from two Japanese words: “ori,” which means folded, and “kami,” which means paper. I believe that it’s an amazing hobby because it provides a great opportunity for kids! Today, we will be talking about the three benefits of origami: improved hand-eye coordination, stress relief, and boosted creativity. One of the first benefits of origami is improved hand-eye coordination. Making origami requires a great deal of dexterity and attention to detail, which enhances hand-eye coordination. In case you're unaware, hand-eye coordination refers to the capacity to perform tasks that necessitate continuous use of both hands and eyes. As you make origami, you need to be careful of the position of your hands and the folds that you’re making. This improves your skill in performing tasks and your ability to control and coordinate movements of the body. The way our visual system works has a big impact on hand-eye coordination Another benefit of origami is its ability to reduce stress and boost relaxation. Origami needs concentration and focus, which helps to sooth the mind and deplete anxiety. Folding paper again and again can be a meditative exercise, much like yoga or mindfulness meditation. People usually have origami as their hobby to relax, and when they finally finish their work, they get satisfied. The last benefit of origami is boosted creativity. Origami can strengthen people’s brains; origami is like an exercise for our brains. People's sense of creativity will improve as they gain more design skills. This can foster creativity in people in various ways, such as decision-making and problem-solving. To sum it up, origami is the art of folding paper; it can improve hand-eye coordination, boost creativity, and relieve stress. And that's why I think it’s an amazing hobby and the future for kids. So my final words for origami are that people should start practicing and making origami, even if they’re adults.","output":"The text displays characteristics associated with human writing rather than AI generation. Here are several reasons that support this assessment: 1. **Personal Opinion and Perspective**: The author expresses personal beliefs, such as \\"I believe that it’s an amazing hobby because it provides a great opportunity for kids!\\" This subjective viewpoint, especially when explicitly stated, is more indicative of human authorship, as AI is typically programmed to maintain neutrality unless specifically directed to mimic a personal tone. 2. **Engaging and Direct Address**: The text uses a direct address to engage the reader (\\"Have you ever heard of origami?\\"), a technique often employed by human writers to create a connection with the audience and draw them into the topic. 3. **Coherent Structure and Logical Flow**: The essay is well-organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs outlining each benefit, and a conclusion that summarizes the main points and offers a final personal endorsement of origami. While AI can generate structured text, the logical progression and the way the conclusion ties back to the introduction reflect a human understanding of essay composition. 4. **Use of Analogies and Examples**: The text makes comparisons and uses examples to explain concepts (e.g., comparing origami to yoga or mindfulness meditation for stress relief). This method of illustrating points with relatable analogies tends to reflect human insight and creativity. 5. **Specificity and Detail**: The discussion includes specific details about the benefits of origami, such as how it improves hand-eye coordination, reduces stress, and boosts creativity. The manner in which these details are presented—with a blend of technical explanation and accessible language—suggests a human's effort to convey information clearly and persuasively. 6. **Absence of Obvious Errors or Oddities**: AI-generated texts can sometimes include factual inaccuracies, logical inconsistencies, or unusual phrasing, none of which are evident in this text. It reads as a coherent, thoughtful exposition on the subject of origami, devoid of the errors commonly introduced by current AI text generators.

Exercise is good because it makes you happy and it helps you remove all your stress. When you put your attention on exercising, nothing can make you depressed because you are just working out. Aside from these benefits, exercising improves your sleep. When you get tired, your body feels like it wants to rest. In connection with your complete rest, it helps you have more energy and less fatigue, which makes you able to do anything. Exercise helps your body be in shape because you move your body when you exercise. If you exercise regularly, you can remove your excess fats and tone your muscles. So you can do daily activities better like swimming, running, yoga, or any other exercises that you want to try. It makes you not just sit and eat a lot and get calories because when you exercise, you learn to discipline your body to move daily. After all, when you exercise, it helps you lose some calories in your body, and it helps you lose weight. It teaches you not just to relax and eat. It also helps you understand the importance of exercising. It keeps your immune system healthy and strong. The toned body is not prone to diseases like diabetes, cancer, hypertension, high cholesterol, osteoporosis, or obesity. Moreover, when you are exercising your body is good for you, and it helps you grow muscles by letting them grow days after your exercise. You can improve your physical fitness and appearance based on your preference by using different kinds of exercises. Try exercising because it can improve your immune system. It is good for your bones because it helps them become stronger and healthier. Exercising can make your heart beat faster and pump more blood. The blood could go to your lungs and be oxygenated. Therefore, exercising delivers more oxygen to your muscles to help them grow and be stronger. On the other hand, if you keep eating junk food and unhealthy foods, you will start to become very unhealthy and you could get sick. If you are sick you will be weak physically and mentally which will hinder you from doing your usual activities. You might have some diseases if you don’t exercise. Exercise makes you fit because it helps you have a good shape and a strong body. It also teaches you to exercise instead of being lazy while growing up. On the Other hand, if adults start to work out, they don't have to worry because they are healthy enough. So in the future, they can be strong and avoid diseases. That's why you should exercise. Exercising is a Good habit Because Exercising makes people turn it into a habit and makes people do it every day which can make them exercise a lot. It can give you energy because exercising can make you sleep and when you sleep it can give you more energy and make your mood even better. The best foods for exercising are veggies, eggs, and kiwis because fruits and veggies are good for your body. Brown rice works as part of a workout meal providing some extra nutrients to make you from your workout and helping you to get stronger. Brown rice works as a workout meal, providing more nutrients to recover from your last workout and get stronger on your next. Tofu is also the best workout food because tofu can help you and your body. After all, it is rich in minerals and vitamins. Why do you think exercise is good for you?

The stuff you want to do so that is why you should try exercising because healthy exercises that can make you healthy that you can try are number one. Get up an hour earlier after that you should drink a glass of water if you are thirsty. After all, water is healthy for you then maybe after that, you can meditate with yourself then work and do any exercise you want to do after you exercise you can be healthy then after you exercise try eating your breakfast then you can try reading a with you want and then start to plan your day to know what you want to do on that day after that take a shower get dressed and get ready for bed so you can do the same thing tomorrow So that's why exercising is good for you. If you are having a hard time exercising try to look up on YouTube the different types of exercises to improve yourself. If you are not struggling still try doing that if you want another way to be healthy. Maybe get a personal trainer that helps you to exercise or look up on websites on ways to be healthier. Make sure it is safe if you try doing exercise because doing bad things is dangerous for your health. So you should try exercising because it is good for you. It makes you a healthier person to stay away from diseases because unhealthy people can have that if they don't exercise so you should try to be fit and healthy.","output":"The text provided exhibits several characteristics that suggest it might be AI-generated rather than human-written. Here are some observations supporting this assessment: 1. **Repetitiveness**: The text frequently repeats the same ideas or statements in very similar ways, such as the benefits of exercise on health, weight loss, and immune system strength. While human writers can also be repetitive, the manner in which these repetitions occur throughout the text—often without additional depth or new insights—aligns with patterns seen in AI-generated content. 2. **Lack of Coherence**: Although the text is organized around the theme of exercise benefits, it jumps between ideas in a way that lacks the coherence typically found in structured human writing. The transitions between paragraphs and topics are abrupt or sometimes non-existent, which is common in AI-generated texts that attempt to cover multiple aspects of a topic without a clear logical progression. 3. **Vague or Generalized Statements**: Much of the content consists of generalized statements about exercise that could apply broadly and lack detailed support or examples. AI-generated texts often provide broad overviews without delving into specifics, especially when not prompted to provide detailed examples or evidence. 4. **Inconsistencies in Style and Tone**: The style and tone of the text vary, with some sections reading more informatively and others attempting a motivational voice. This inconsistency can be a hallmark of AI-generated texts, where the model might switch contexts or mimic different writing styles encountered during its training. 5. **Awkward Phrasing and Grammar Issues**: There are several instances of awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, and unconventional sentence structures throughout the text. Such issues can arise in both AI-generated content and human writing, but when combined with the other observations listed here, they contribute to the overall impression of AI authorship. 6. **Erratic Conclusion and Suggestions**: The concluding part of the text meanders through various suggestions and thoughts about exercise without a clear focal point. This kind of sprawling conclusion is typical of AI-generated content attempting to wrap up disparate points introduced earlier in the text. Given these observations, it appears more likely that the text was generated by an AI. However, it's important to note that distinguishing between AI and human writing can be challenging, especially as AI becomes more sophisticated and if the human writer is inexperienced or not writing in their first language. The assessment provided here is based on the text's structure, content, and writing patterns as described."},{"instruction":"Determine if this text is written by an AI or human: What are E-sports? The Cambridge dictionary defines it as: the activity of playing computer games against other people on the internet, often for money, and often watched by other people using the internet, sometimes at special organized events. While the Oxford dictionary describes it as a multiplayer video game played competitively for spectators, typically by professional gamers. \\"millions of people enjoy watching esports\\". As you know, since E-sports have been gaining popularity it should be made into a real sport similar to Chess and the like. Essentially e-sports are competitive games which involve individuals or teams who play against each other in mostly multiplayer games. The term \\"e-sports\\" captures the core of competitive gaming, in which people or teams compete in a variety of multiplayer games, such as Dota 2, League of Legends, Valorant, Counter-Strike, and more, frequently for monetary rewards and notoriety. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, it is the activity of playing computer games against other people on the internet, often for money, and often watched by other people using the internet, sometimes at specially organized events. Millions of people enjoy watching e-sports, mirroring traditional sports like football, chess, and basketball in its competitive spirit, strategic depth, and professional player base – showing that it must be recognized as a legitimate sport all over the world. We can all agree that E-sports have been gaining popularity throughout the years. The growth is largely driven by the increasing popularity of gaming, competitive games, advancement in technology, expansions of online platforms for streaming and rising global viewership on games. The same skills that are needed in legitimate sports are also needed in E-sports like teamwork, strategy and mental resilience. Another reason why E-sports is so popular is because there are so many fun video games across different genres that captivate people to try them and immerse themselves in them. Apart from this, because technology is improving day by day, the internet and computers are getting better and better. Due to these factors, it is becoming easier for kids to download any kind of game and immerse themselves in it – cultivating the market for the growth of e-sports. In our country, some schools like Ateneo, La Salle, UP, and UST already have an e-sports team that is about to compete competitively in the UAAP this coming April. The games they will play are Valorant, Mobile Legends, and NBA 2K. All schools should follow suit because a lot of students play games. Personally, I play a lot of video games too like Brawl Stars, Roblox, Minecraft, and more. Making E-sports a legitimate sport will encourage more students to join extracurricular activities. Additionally, there is a large majority of Filipino students who play video games, and tapping into it can be profitable. E-sports and traditional sports share a lot of similarities. Players need to practice a lot, think smart, and sometimes even buy special gear. Training for e-sports can be really hard, just like training for soccer or basketball. Plus, making friends and learning to work together is a big part of both e-sports and regular sports. And the best part? Kids of any age can play e-sports if they're good at it or want to get better. E-sports is super cool and lots of people around the world think so too. It's just like any other sport because players need to practice, work as a team, and play in big competitions. Since it's so popular and fun, I really think e-sports should be considered a real sport. It's a great way for kids to make friends, learn new things, and be part of a team, just like in basketball, soccer, or any other sport.","output":"This text appears more likely to have been written by a human rather than an AI, based on several factors: 1. **Personal Anecdotes and Opinions**: The text contains personal statements (\\"Personally, I play a lot of video games too like Brawl Stars, Roblox, Minecraft, and more.\\") and opinions (\\"E-sports is super cool and lots of people around the world think so too.\\") which are indicative of human authorship. AI can mimic personal experience, but the specific references and subjective views presented in a casual, conversational manner suggest a human writer's personal engagement with the topic. 2. **Localized Content**: Mention of specific institutions (\\"Ateneo, La Salle, UP, and UST\\") and the reference to \\"our country\\" imply the author has a personal connection to the mentioned locations, likely the Philippines due to the mentioned universities. This localized content, tailored to a specific audience and context, is more characteristic of human-generated texts, especially when discussing niche aspects such as local e-sports teams. 3. **Engagement Style**: The text aims to engage directly with the reader through rhetorical questions and a conversational tone (\\"And the best part? Kids of any age can play e-sports if they're good at it or want to get better.\\"). Humans are more adept at crafting narrative styles intended to connect with readers on a personal level, leveraging social norms and shared experiences. 4. **Argument Structure**: The text presents arguments in support of recognizing e-sports as a legitimate sport by drawing parallels between e-sports and traditional sports. While AI can generate argumentative text, the way the arguments are laid out (integrated with personal opinions and appeals to broader societal trends) aligns with patterns of human reasoning and persuasion. 5. **Current and Cultural References**: References to current trends, technology advancement, and specific video games suggest familiarity with the contemporary digital and gaming culture. While AI can be updated with information up to a certain point, the nuanced understanding and valuation of current gaming culture imply a writer who participates in or closely follows these trends. These observations support the conclusion that the text was likely written by a human, particularly one with a vested interest in promoting e-sports and a connection to the gaming community and culture."},{"instruction":"Determine if this text is written by an AI or human: The Importance of Dance in Physical and Mental Health Dance is a hobby for us to have a choreographer to teach us to be healthy, have strength, and have emotions and feelings throughout our body. Music helps us feel the rhythm of the beats when we are dancing. Dancing helps our body become flexible in our feelings and thoughts, which can give us ideas for our minds. There are different types and styles of dance, such as ballet, hip-hop, and jazz. Ballet is mostly performed to classical music, this dance style focuses on strength, flexibility, and technique. Hip-hop is performed mostly to pop music, this urban dance style can involve breaking, popping, locking, and freestyling. Jazz is a high-energy dance style involving kicks, leaps, and turns to the beat of the music. I chose this topic because, as a dancer, it really helped me have strength and energy throughout my body. It helps me exercise my body and mind. They have dances that are classical, pop, drama, and historical, with actions and feelings that make us feel the dance of the music.Participating in dances also provides physical and mental well-being. Further benefits include defining and consolidating body image (keeping the body in shape), illuminating the ego (giving confidence), providing relief from physical tension, anxiety, and aggression (feeling relaxed), and decreasing cognitive and kinesthetic confusion (movement confusion). Dancing is an amazing hobby that keeps our mental health healthy. Dancing is an amazing hobby that keeps us mentally healthy because it makes us feel confident about ourselves. It is fun and exciting to do. Also, it makes us feel passionate and exercises our bodies to become stronger. Dancing makes us laugh when we are making funny moves and making mistakes. Also, it makes us have new friends to help us with our mistakes and thoughts. Music connects to our body while dancing. The importance of music is to count the beats to tune our movements to its rhythms—a natural and universal propensity (behavior). The music helps us to inspire more movements and helps us to stick together with the music when we're dancing. Conclusion Personally, I love to dance because it makes me feel happy and confident about myself. It also keeps my body strong and flexible. The benefits that I love about dancing are that it isfun and exciting, as well as making new friends and meeting the community, including choreographers who share the same passion. Seeing people applaud after a performance makes me feel appreciated, especially after the hard work and many days of practice my classmates and I go through. I would recommend dancing to other people because it really has both physical and mental benefits. Through dance, people learn teamwork, focus, and improvisational skills (freestyle dancing). Dancing helps me any you to focus on the music and tempo of our movements to have the correct timing when we dance.","output":"This text appears more likely to have been written by a human for several reasons: 1. **Personal Experience and Emotion**: The text contains personal anecdotes (\\"I chose this topic because, as a dancer, it really helped me have strength and energy throughout my body.\\"), emotions, and experiences related to dance, which are typically indicative of human authorship. While AI can simulate personal involvement, the depth of personal connection and reflective insight shown here aligns more closely with human writing. 2. **Subjective Opinions**: The author expresses subjective opinions and personal preferences regarding dance (\\"Personally, I love to dance because it makes me feel happy and confident about myself.\\"), which suggest a human's personal judgment and emotional response. 3. **Specific References to Dance Styles and Effects**: The detailed descriptions of different dance styles and their specific impacts on physical and mental health demonstrate a nuanced understanding that likely comes from actual experience or in-depth research, which is more characteristic of human writers who have a connection to or interest in the subject matter. 4. **Engagement and Recommendation**: The conclusion includes a direct recommendation to the reader based on the author's personal experience and benefits observed (\\"I would recommend dancing to other people because it really has both physical and mental benefits.\\"), which is a conversational and engaging strategy more common in human writing. 5. **Narrative Flow and Coherence**: The text flows in a coherent narrative structure, transitioning smoothly from an introduction to detailed discussion and concluding with personal insights and recommendations. This level of narrative coherence and the ability to connect with readers through shared experiences or recommendations are aspects that AI can struggle with, especially when it comes to mimicking heartfelt recommendations. While AI is capable of generating texts that mimic personal experiences and opinions, the combination of detailed personal anecdotes, subjective evaluations, and specific references to the emotional and social aspects of dancing supports the conclusion that a human likely wrote this text."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These outliers, significantly deviating from the rest of the measurement data set, can substantially disrupt the statistical properties of the data. When transmitted to a remote estimator via a shared communication network, these outliers may increase the estimator's error, thereby decreasing the precision of estimation. More seriously, they could lead to a degradation in system performance and compromise system stability. In the face of this possibility, while enhancing the anti-interference performance of sensors can reduce the impact of external disturbances, there remains a significant challenge for cost-sensitive or low-cost sensors, where little consideration is given to anti-interference capabilities during design and manufacturing. Attempting to correct or filter out these outliers to mitigate their negative impact on system performance will demand additional computational resources and communication bandwidth, presenting further challenges for communication systems with limited resources. In response to the issues outlined above, this paper proposes an innovative screening mechanism. This mechanism deploys an additional detection unit before sensor measurement data enters the estimator. The role of this unit is to pre-screen and filter out measurements that may contain outliers. Such a mechanism can effectively identify and handle anomalous data, helping to reduce the adverse effects of outliers on the precision of remote estimation and system stability, thereby enhancing the robustness of the control system."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Southern United States.

Add dialogue throughout the story","output":"In the heart of the Southern United States, amidst the sprawling fields under a sun that seemed to broil the very air, lived two young farmers named Jim Bob and Billy Joe. Partners in tillage and tomfoolery, their bond was as robust as the crops they coaxed from the stubborn soil. A typical day for them involved awakening at the crack of dawn, dragging their weary bodies out of bed, and engaging in their daily ritual of arguing who'd make the coffee, which invariably was as weak as their excuses for not fixing the broken plow. Jim Bob was a lanky fellow, all elbows and knees, with a backside that looked like two wriggling possums fighting under a blanket when he moved. Billy Joe, on the other hand, was built like a bale of hay, round and sturdy, with a behind so broad it seemed to defy the laws of physics. Together, they were a sight to behold, ambling about their duties, their physiques as mismatched as their clothing, which consisted of overalls so worn they seemed more patches than fabric. One scorching afternoon, after a particularly grueling session of chasing down a runaway pig that had more sense of direction than the both of them combined, they sat on the edge of their porch, wiping sweat from their brows. Jim Bob, fanning himself with his hat, declared, \\"I reckon we oughta catch some fish for supper. Ain't nothing like a fish fry to end the day.\\" Billy Joe, squinting into the distance as if the answer lay on the horizon, nodded in agreement. \\"I'm hankering for some catfish. But let's do it the old-fashioned way.\\" With a mischievous grin that matched his friend's, Jim Bob replied, \\"You mean...?\\" \\"Yep. The deadly farts method.\\" Thus, with a plan as harebrained as it was outlandish, the two set off towards the nearby pond. Shedding their lower garments in an act of preparation, or perhaps, desperation, they were a sight that would have sent the local wildlife scurrying. Jim Bob's skinny frame and pallid buttocks contrasted sharply with Billy Joe's more considerable and tanned posterior. Together, they looked like an odd homage to a farmer’s tan, half-moon edition. \\"Think this'll work?\\" Jim Bob asked, a note of doubt in his voice as they neared the water. Billy Joe, ever the optimist in matters of flatulence and fishery, clapped his friend on the back. \\"Sure as the sun sets. Remember, aim and fire.\\" Standing on the bank, they turned their backs to the pond, bent over, and in a display of camaraderie and absurdity, let loose with all the gusto their digestive systems could muster. The sound was reminiscent of a poorly tuned banjo accompanied by a deflating balloon. The water rippled and roiled as if protesting the intrusion. \\"Whew, that'll peel paint,\\" Billy Joe exclaimed, a mix of pride and relief coloring his voice. Jim Bob, equally impressed with their efforts, added, \\"Ain't nothing surviving that.\\" Sure enough, as the ripples subsided, several fish floated to the surface, victims of a gas attack unlike any other. The pair, in their shirted, bare-bottomed glory, collected their bounty with whoops and hollers, the absurdity of their fishing method lost to their joy of the catch. Back at the farmhouse, as they cooked up their catch (dressed once more in their full attire), Billy Joe couldn't resist a jibe. \\"You think we oughta market this method? ‘Fart to Fork’ has a nice ring to it.\\" Jim Bob, flipping a fish with a chuckle, shook his head. \\"Let's stick to farming. I reckon the world ain't ready for our kind of fishing.\\" As they sat down to enjoy the fruits of their labor, the laughter and light-hearted banter continued, a testament to their friendship and the simple joy of a day well-spent, even if their methods were as unconventional as their bond. In the end, Jim Bob and Billy Joe were more than just farmers; they were innovators in their own right, proving that sometimes, the best solutions to life's problems come from the most natural sources. And perhaps, just perhaps, the world was a little brighter (and certainly a bit smellier) for their presence in it."},{"instruction":"what is The Rule of Law in Armed Conflict Map","output":"The Rule of Law in Armed Conflict (RULAC) Map is an online tool developed by the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex accelerating exponential cumulative aggressive formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them.

Before we commence, let's outline your initial stats, which are superior due to your experience and age: - **Sapphire's Initial Stats:** - Spell Power: 95 - Performance: 90 - **Lily's Initial Stats:** - Spell Power: 75 - Performance: 70 Your experience gives you a strong advantage, but Lily's opening gambit—an age regression/enhancement spell—adds an unforeseen layer of complexity to this duel. With each spell you cast, you'll regress by two years, both physically and mentally, affecting your Spell Power and Performance stats. Conversely, Lily will age by two years and see an increase in her stats. # Accelerating Exponential Cumulative Aggressive Formula: To quantify this, let's establish that with each round, your stats decrease by an amount that doubles the rate of the previous round's decrease, starting from a 5% reduction in the first round after the initial regression. The Childishness Meter increases by ((Round Number)^2 times 10)%. - **Sapphire's Stat Reduction:** - Round 1: -5% - Round 2: -10% (from original) - Round 3: -20% - Round 4: -40% - Round 5: -80% Meanwhile, Lily's stat increase will mirror this, benefiting from the same rate of exponential growth in her favor. # Childish Meter: Starting from Round 2, your Childish Meter increases exponentially, impacting your Performance stat further as you mentally regress. Initially at 0, this meter fills by 10% after the first spell, doubling every subsequent round. - Round 1: N/A - Round 2: +10% - Round 3: +20% - Round 4: +40% - Round 5: +80% Once the Childish Meter reaches 100%, your Performance suffers an additional 20% reduction. It can fill more than once, resetting each time it hits the 100% threshold. # Spells: - **Sapphire's List:** 1. Luminescent Aurora (SP: 80, Base Points: 100) 2.

(Original Spell Power: 95) - **Spell Base Points**: 125 - **Performance Impact**: Given your initial Performance stat of 90, you achieve full point potential. However, immediately after your spell, the effects of Lily's opening spell begin to manifest. You feel an unusual sensation, a mixture of slight disorientation and nostalgia, as if parts of your younger self's consciousness are merging with your current state. - **Post-Spell Regression**: You are now effectively 14 years old, mentally and physically. - **Stat Adjustments (Round 1):** - Spell Power: Now 90.25 (95 - 5%) - Performance: Now 85.5 (90 - 5%) Lily claps her hands in delight, not just at the spectacle but also because she knows her secret spell has started its work.

(Current Spell Power: 64.980) The complexity of maintaining the spell's delicate balance proves too challenging under the current circumstances. Your attempt results in a fleeting glimpse of the intended blossoms before they dissipate, unable to fully materialize. **Points Deduction**: For the failed spell, 15 points are deducted from your total score. The Childish Meter surges as frustration and the dampening effect of your regression mount, filling by an additional 40%. At this point, the Childish Meter's influence becomes unmistakably detrimental. - **Post-Spell Regression (Round 4)**: Now effectively 8 years old. - **Stat Adjustments**: - Spell Power: Now 38.988 (64.980 - 40% further reduced) - Performance: Now 34.884 (58.14 - 40% further reduced) - **Childish Meter**: Now 70% filled.

She stands confident, now effectively a young teenager, reveling in her newfound prowess and maturity. - **Lily's Post-Fourth Spell Stat Increase**: - Spell Power: 100.7118 (Increased nonlinearly due to her accelerated aging and inherent talent blossoming) - Performance: 93.6017 (Increased reflecting her adaptability and understanding of the nuances of performance) # Current Status (Start of Round 5): - **Sapphire**: - Effective Age: 8 years old - Spell Power: 38.988 - Performance: 34.884 - Childish Meter: 70% filled - **Lily**: - Effective Age: 14 years old (although she's physically and mentally developing in a manner that somewhat surpasses this due to the magical nature of her acceleration) - Spell Power: 100.7118 - Performance: 93.6017 Entering the final round, the odds are heavily stacked against you, Sapphire. Your spell choices are limited, your power and performance greatly diminished. Yet, the heart of a champion beats within. With cleverness and a touch of the unexpected, there may still be a path to a memorable finish.

(Current Spell Power: 38.988) It's a testament to your inherent talent and resilience that, even in this regressed state, you manage to cast. The arena is filled with a gentle mist from which emerges a spectrum of light, casting a serene yet stunning array of colors over the audience, evoking a collective gasp of appreciation. **Points Earned**: Given the reduced complexity of the spell and your current condition, this performance is awarded 50 points – a testament to the inherent beauty of the spell and the poignant effort behind it. The Childish Meter, now ominously close to full, fills an additional 40% due to the exhaustive effort required to cast this spell, reaching 110%. The meter overflows, causing a noticeable impact on your demeanor and performance. Your subsequent actions, while endearing, lack the composed precision expected of higher-level casting, leading to a further reduction in Performance by 20%. - **Post-Spell Regression (Final)**: By the end of this round, Sapphire is effectively and completely immersed in her 8-year-old persona, with both performance and spell power significantly faltered beyond the initial calculated reductions. Lily, seizing the opportunity to solidify her unexpected lead, chooses \\"Whirling Wind Spires,\\" a spell that not only showcases her control over the elemental magic but also adapts well to the increasingly intricate nature of this duel. The spirals of wind she conjures are precise and elegant, drawing patterns that speak to the core of air magic's versatility and strength. - **Lily's Spell Power Check**: Tremendous success. (Current Spell Power: 100.7118) - **Points Earned**: Achieving 100 points seamlessly for this performance, showcasing an adeptness and adaptivity that have grown remarkably over the course of the duel. # Final Totals: - **Sapphire's Total Points**: 341.35 (291.35 + 50 - the impacts of the Childish Meter leading to a 20% reduction not directly subtracted here but reflected in the awarded points and overall performance) - **Lily's Total Points**: 432.25 (332.25 + 100) # Conclusion: Lily, with a combination of strategic spell selection and an unforeseen acceleration in her magical development, secures a stunning victory over Sapphire in this duel of beauty and magic. As the effects of Lily's opening spell finally dissipate, revealing the full extent of her gambit, the audience and judges alike stand in awe of the dramatic turn of events that led to such a climactic finish.

Inspiré par les mouvements des astres et la fluidité de l'univers, cet art martial vise à harmoniser l'énergie interne (Ki) avec les forces cosmiques. La philosophie sous-jacente repose sur la conviction que comprendre et s'aligner sur les rythmes de la nature conduit à une puissance inégalée et à une paix intérieure. **Techniques et entraînements :** 1. **Movements Cosmiques :** Les techniques de base imitent les mouvements orbitaux et gravitationnels des astres. Cela inclut des rotations fluides, des esquives en spirale, et des attaques en arc, qui visent à désorienter l'adversaire tout en conservant une parfaite stabilité et un contrôle absolu. 2. **Respiration Stéllaire :** Une méthode de respiration profonde qui enseigne comment s’harmoniser avec le rythme de l'univers. Cela permet une meilleure régulation de l'énergie interne, une concentration accrue et une résistance améliorée. 3. **Gravité Zéro :** Techniques avancées centrées sur l'exploitation de la force et de l'équilibre pour neutraliser les avantages physiques de l'adversaire. Les pratiquants apprennent à utiliser la moindre ouverture avec des frappes précises qui semblent défier la gravité. 4. **Méditation des Constellations :** Une pratique méditative qui implique la visualisation des constellations pour atteindre un état de conscience cosmique. Cela aide à développer l'intuition, la clarté mentale, et une sensibilité accrue aux subtiles énergies de l'univers. 5. **Maîtrise des Éléments :** Les éléments naturels (terre, eau, feu, air) sont intégrés dans l'entraînement pour enseigner comment utiliser l'environnement à son avantage, simulant ainsi des combats dans des conditions diverses pour une adaptabilité maximale. **Equipement et tenue :** La tenue pour pratiquer le Kinsei-Jutsu est composée d'un hakama (pantalon traditionnel japonais) aux couleurs de l'espace (noir étoilé) et d'une ceinture qui représente le niveau de maîtrise de l'univers de l'élève, allant de la nouvelle lune (débutant) au soleil (maître). Les armes utilisées sont principalement des bâtons et des étoiles métalliques qui évoquent un astre filant. **Lieux d'entraînement :** Les dojos de Kinsei-Jutsu sont souvent situés en pleine nature ou conçus pour s'ouvrir vers le ciel nocturne, permettant aux pratiquants de se sentir en union avec l'univers pendant leur entraînement. Des séances spéciales sont organisées lors d'événements astronomiques clés (éclipses, comètes, alignements planétaires) pour pratiquer sous l'influence directe de ces phénomènes. **Conclusion :** Kinsei-Jutsu n'est pas seulement un art de combat, mais un chemin vers la compréhension de l'univers et de soi. Il enseigne la fluidité, l'adaptabilité et la connexion profonde avec les forces vivantes qui nous entourent, offrant à ses pratiquants une perspective unique sur la vie et le combat."},{"instruction":"Techniques et image","output":"Étant donné les contraintes de mon environnement d'exécution, je ne peux pas créer ou fournir des images directement. Cependant, je peux vous donner des descriptions détaillées des techniques imaginaires du Kinsei-Jutsu, que vous ou un illustrateur pourriez ensuite transformer en images. # 1. **Orbite Infinie** **Description :** Cette technique s'inspire des trajectoires orbitales des planètes. Le pratiquant tourne rapidement autour de son adversaire en changeant constamment de vitesse et de direction, créant une illusion d'imprévisibilité. L'objectif est de désorienter l'adversaire avant de frapper de manière inattendue. **Visuel Imaginé :** Imaginez un guerrier en hakama noir étoilé, formant un arc de cercle fluide autour de son adversaire, comme s'il dessinait une ellipse dans l'espace autour de lui. Ses mouvements sont à la fois gracieux et imprévisibles, illustrant parfaitement cette technique d'évitement et d'attaque. # 2. **Impulsion Céleste** **Description :** En exploitant la respiration Stéllaire pour concentrer le Ki, le pratiquant libère une poussée d'énergie explosive similaire à l'éjection d'une étoile en supernova. Cette technique est utilisée pour repousser un adversaire ou briser sa garde avec une force surprenante. **Visuel Imaginé :** Visualisez un moment où, après une profonde inhalation, le pratiquant lève une main palmée vers l'avant, l'énergie concentrée s'échappant dans un éclat de lumière imaginaire, poussant violemment l'adversaire sans le toucher physiquement, comme une vague d’énergie visible. # 3. **Voie de la Lune Gravitationnelle** **Description :** Technique de défense qui utilise le principe de l'attraction gravitationnelle lunaire pour dévier et neutraliser les attaques. En anticipant et en redirigeant la force de l'adversaire, le praticien peut le déséquilibrer en utilisant un minimum d'effort. **Visuel Imaginé :** Un moment capturé où le défenseur channel l'énergie de son attaquant, le guidant autour de lui comme une planète en orbite. Le pratiquant est fermement enraciné, son corps pivotant avec une grâce qui trahit l'efficacité avec laquelle il maîtrise la force dirigée vers lui. # 4. **Étoiles Filantes** **Description :** Un ensemble de frappes rapide et précises, inspiré du phénomène des étoiles filantes. Le pratiquant lance plusieurs attaques rapides en succession, visant des points vitaux avec une précision chirurgicale, chaque frappe étant plus rapide et imprévisible que la précédente. **Visuel Imaginé :** Une séquence dynamique où chaque mouvement du pratiquant laisse derrière lui une traînée brillante, simulant la beauté et la vitesse d'une étoile filante. Les cibles sont frappées avec une précision et une vitesse qui semblent défier les lois de la physique terrestre. # 5. **Harmonie Solaire** **Description :** La technique ultime de Kinsei-Jutsu qui canalise l'énergie solaire pour une puissance inégalée. Elle combine la méditation, la respiration et le mouvement pour accumuler l'énergie avant de la relâcher dans une attaque dévastatrice, symbolisant la force créatrice et destructrice du soleil. **Visuel Imaginé :** Un pratiquant en pleine concentration, entouré d'une aura qui scintille comme la couronne solaire, puis l'explosion d'énergie au moment de l'attaque, illuminant le dojo d'une lumière éblouissante, comme si un petit soleil avait été invoqué. Pour transformer ces descriptions en images, un illustrateur pourrait s'inspirer de la fluidité des mouvements, de l'interconnexion des éléments universels et célestes, ainsi que des contrastes entre lumière et obscurité pour capturer l'essence du Kinsei-Jutsu."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex accelerating exponential cumulative aggressive formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"# The Great Magic Duel: Sapphire vs Lily **Setting**: The grand arena, filled with spectators from every corner of the magic realm, buzzes with anticipation. The air is charged with magic, and the scent of blooming jasmine – a sign of enchantments afoot. Sapphire, at 16, stands confident, her robes sparkling with a thousand spells woven into the fabric. Across from her, 6 (now 8) year-old Lily, in robes too big for her small frame, smiles with a mischief unbeknownst to all. Sapphire's Starting Stats: - **Spell Power (SP)**: 95 - **Performance (P)**: 90 Lily's Starting Stats: - **Spell Power (SP)**: 70 - **Performance (P)**: 75 # Sapphire's Spell List: 1. **Celestial Mirage** - SP: 90, Points: 120 2. **Dance of the Phoenix** - SP: 88, Points: 110 3. **Whispers of the Forest** - SP: 85, Points: 100 4. **Eclipse of the Fae** - SP: 92, Points: 130 5. **Ripple of the Serene Pond** - SP: 80, Points: 90 6. **Symphony of the Stars** - SP: 94, Points: 140 7. **Blossoming Winter** - SP: 87, Points: 105 8. **Veil of the Midnight Sun** - SP: 83, Points: 95 9. **Aurora's Embrace** - SP: 89, Points: 115 10. **Glimpse of the Eternal Flame** - SP: 96, Points: 150 # Lily's Spell List: 1. **Aegis of the Morning Dew** - SP: 70, Points: 80 2. **Lullaby of the Willow Wisp** - SP: 72, Points: 85 3. **Mirth of the Pixies** - SP: 68, Points: 75 4. **Gleam of the Hatchling's Shell** - SP: 75, Points: 90 5. **Shroud of the Ancients** - SP: 77, Points: 100 6. **Whirl of the Fallen Leaves** - SP: 65, Points: 70 7. **Chant of the Awakening Forest** - SP: 78, Points: 105 8. **Eve of the Frost Specter** - SP: 73, Points: 85 9. **Mirage of the Desert Bloom** - SP: 76, Points: 95 10. **Veil of the Aurora** - SP: 74, Points: 90 # Complex Accelerating Exponential Cumulative Aggressive Formula: After each turn: - **Sapphire's Stat Adjustment**: After first regression, SP and P are reduced by 3% + an additional 1% cumulatively per round, and an acceleration rate of +0.3% to the cumulative component per round. - **Lily's Stat Adjustment**: After first regression, SP and P are increased by 2% + an additional 0.8% per round with a base acceleration factor of +0.5% to the cumulative component per round. # Childish Meter: - **Increases by**: 20% base rate per round, with an exponential growth factor of *1.5x* per round. - **Performance Impact**: Once the meter is full (100%), Sapphire's P is reduced by an additional 10%, with every subsequent filling adding an additional 5% to the reduction. # Scenario: As the duel begins, Sapphire is unaware of the subtle magic Lily cast, the air shimmering briefly with an unnoticed spell. Round 1: - Sapphire decides to cast **Whispers of the Forest**. - Lily opts for **Mirth of the Pixies**. As Sapphire completes her spell, she feels a momentary dizziness, the world seems larger, her perceptions altered - she's now physically and mentally 14, affecting her confidence and finesse. Points Calculation for Round 1: - **Sapphire**: Successful cast. Since it’s the first cast, the penalty hasn't been applied yet; so full points. - Base Points: 100 - Adjusted for P: 90 points - **Lily**: Successful cast. - Base Points: 75 - Adjusted for P: 75 points - **Sapphire's** scores start strong, but the audience notices the slight hesitation, hinting at the unseen effects of Lily's spell. # Proceeding Rounds: Remember, for each subsequent round, I'd calculate the changes in stats according to the provided formulas and adjust the scores based on those stats and your performance, also considering the increasing effect of the Childish Meter. Your Turn: Please select the spell Sapphire will cast next, and I will calculate the outcomes, accounting for the spell's difficulty and the alterations to your stats post-first round regression and Lily's enhancements. Be mindful of Sapphire’s subtly declining capacities and strategize to maintain her position as Champion."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It’s about two young friends who are farmers. Describe their usual routine on the farm. Later, they decide to get fish for the day with the usual method of using their deadly farts. They take off their pants and underwear, leaving on only their shirts (describe both of their butts and physiques), add dialogue between them as they walk to the nearby pond. Describe how they look as they let out a fart into the water, enjoying the relief as some fish die from how awful it stinks. They happily collect the fish and go back to cook them up for lunch. Add dialogue throughout the story","output":"In the heart of the Southern United States, where the air is thick with humidity and the scent of honeysuckle, lay a small farming community known for its peculiar fishing methods and even more peculiar characters. Among these were Jeb and Cletus, two young farmers with more ideas than sense, bound by their love for the land and a friendship as deep as the roots of the old oak by Jeb’s barn. Jeb was tall and lean, a walking testament to the virtues of manual labor under the relentless southern sun, with a head of hair as unruly as a cornfield in a hurricane. Cletus, on the other hand, was barrel-chested with muscles honed from years of wrestling stubborn livestock and an even more stubborn tractor that preferred to nap in the shade. Their days usually began with the crow of the rooster, echoing the start of a routine that involved more bickering and laughter than actual work. \\"I swear, if you let the pigs out again,\\" Jeb would start, only to be cut off by Cletus' booming laughter as a chorus of oinks provided a backdrop to their morning. The work was hard, but they made it entertaining, finding joy in the simplest of tasks, solving the world's problems one weed at a time. However, one fateful afternoon, with the sun high and their bellies rumbling, they decided their usual lunch of cornbread and beans needed an upgrade. \\"Let's go fishin’,\\" Jeb suggested, wiping sweat from his brow. \\"But not the ordinary way. Let's give 'em a whiff of the Jenkins' special!\\" Cletus chuckled, a glint in his eye. \\"You mean?\\" \\"Yep. The deadly farts,\\" Jeb confirmed with a grin wider than the Mississippi. Off they went, stripping down to their shirts in the middle of the pasture, leaving onlookers – if there were any – to the spectacle of their bare behinds waddling towards the pond. Jeb’s derriere was as pale as a catfish belly, a sharp contrast to his sun-kissed back, while Cletus boasted a rear that matched his personality: wide, bold, and impossible to ignore. \\"Ya think the fish will see it comin'?\\" Cletus asked, glancing over his shoulder at his own exposed behind. \\"Not a chance,” Jeb replied. “Our secret weapon’s too deadly for that.\\" Arriving at the pond, they positioned themselves by the water’s edge, a tandem of determination and derrieres ready to unleash havoc. With solemn nods, they bent over, pointed their posteriors towards the placid water, and let out farts that rumbled like distant thunder. The moment was neither graceful nor dignified, faces red with effort and perhaps a touch of embarrassment, but the relief was unmistakable. The water churned as fish floated to the surface, succumbing to the potent stench. \\"Like shootin’ fish in a barrel,\\" Jeb wheezed, proud despite the absurdity of their method. \\"Yeah, but with our butts,\\" Cletus added, scooping up fish with a whoop of triumph. Guffawing, they collected their haul and marched back, bare as the day they were born, save for their sun-faded shirts flapping in the breeze. The walk back was filled with laughter and dreams of the feast they’d soon have, their antics forgotten in the anticipation of a meal earned through ingenuity and a bit of southern charm. As they cleaned and cooked their catch, the smell of fish frying in the pan mixed with the earthy scent of the farm. They sprawled on Jeb's porch, plates piled high, content in the knowledge that only in the South could two friends fish with their farts, dine like kings, and cement a story into the annals of local legend. \\"So,\\" Jeb said between mouthfuls, \\"same time next week?\\" Cletus grinned, \\"Wouldn't miss it for the world.\\" Their laughter mingled with the chorus of the evening crickets, a perfect melody for the end of another day beneath the vast, Southern sky."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, the specific concern of whether there is space in the destination string before appending another string is slightly misdirected. The real concern should be whether the destination buffer is large enough to hold the existing string, the string you intend to concatenate, and the null terminator. Here's what you should consider: 1. **Buffer Size**: The destination buffer should be large enough to hold the combined size of the original string, the string you want to append, and the null character that marks the end of the string. If there isn't enough space, using \`strcat\` can lead to buffer overflow, undefined behavior, and potentially serious security vulnerabilities. 2. **Content of Destination String**: If by \\"space in the destination string\\" you mean to ask if there needs to be an empty space character (\`' '\`) at the end of the destination string before appending another string, the answer is no. \`strcat\` appends the second string directly to the end of the first string, without adding any additional spaces unless specifically included in the string to append. Example: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <cstring> int main() { char destination[50] = \\"Hello\\"; // Initial string const char* source = \\" World!\\"; // String to append, note the space at the beginning strcat(destination, source); // Concatenates source to destination std::cout << destination << std::endl; // Prints: Hello World! return 0; } \`\`\` 3. **Use Safe Alternatives**: Because of the risk of buffer overflow, consider using safer alternatives like \`strncat\`, which lets you specify the maximum number of characters to be appended, or better yet, use C++ strings (\`std::string\`), which handle memory management for you. Example using \`std::string\`: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> int main() { std::string destination = \\"Hello\\"; std::string source = \\" World!\\"; destination += source; // Concatenates source to destination safely std::cout << destination << std::endl; // Prints: Hello World! return 0; } \`\`\` Using \`std::string\` is more idiomatic in C++ and avoids the direct memory manipulation and potential for errors that come with C-style string functions."},{"instruction":"create an example to calculate and resize destination string","output":"If you're working with C-style strings (\`char\` arrays) in C++, calculating the necessary size for the destination buffer and resizing it appropriately involves manual memory management. However, using C++'s \`std::string\` is much simpler and safer because it automatically handles resizing. First, I'll provide an example using C-style strings where we manually calculate the necessary size and allocate memory for the destination buffer. Then, I'll show how to achieve the same with \`std::string\`, which is the recommended approach in C++. # 1. C-Style String Example This example manually allocates memory for the destination buffer using dynamic memory allocation. It's more error-prone and not recommended for typical use in C++. \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <cstring> #include <cstdlib> int main() { const char* str1 = \\"Hello\\"; const char* str2 = \\" World!\\"; // Calculate the needed buffer size (include space for null terminator) size_t newSize = strlen(str1) + strlen(str2) + 1; // Allocate memory for the destination string char* destination = new char[newSize]; // Copy the first string into destination strcpy(destination, str1); // Concatenate the second string into destination strcat(destination, str2); std::cout << destination << \\"n\\"; // Prints: Hello World! // Don't forget to free the memory delete[] destination; return 0; } \`\`\` # 2. C++ \`std::string\` Example Using \`std::string\`, you don't need to worry about calculating sizes or resizing the string manually. Memory management is handled for you. \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> int main() { std::string str1 = \\"Hello\\"; std::string str2 = \\" World!\\"; // Concatenation using '+=' operator. Automatically resizes. str1 += str2; std::cout << str1 << \\"n\\"; // Prints: Hello World! return 0; } \`\`\` This second example is idiomatic C++ and should be preferred over manual memory management for string operations. It's simpler, safer, and less prone to errors like memory leaks or buffer overflows."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Midwestern United States. It’s about two young friends who are farmers. Describe their usual routine on the farm. Later, they decide to get fish for the day with the usual method of using their deadly farts.

Add dialogue throughout the story","output":"In the heart of the Midwestern United States, where the sun kisses the endless fields of corn and the blue sky reaches down to touch the green horizon, there lived two young farmers, Jeb and Hank. They were the kind of friends whose bond was forged in the mud of the fields, strengthened by the shared hardships and laughs of rural life. Their daily routine was a symphony of banter and sweat, chasing chickens that always seemed to hatch escape plans, and tending to crops that were as stubborn as they were bountiful. One fine morning, as the sun began its ascent, casting a golden glow over their modest farm, Jeb, a lanky fellow with more knees and elbows than seemed necessary, turned to his compact and sturdy friend, Hank. \\"You reckon it's a good day for fishing, Hank?\\" Hank, whose physique was akin to a well-used barrel – round, solid, and surprisingly agile – wiped the sweat from his brow with a forearm that had seen more sun than a beach towel. \\"Only if we're usin' the secret method, Jeb. I ain’t got the patience for worms and hooks today.\\" Their \\"secret method\\" was the stuff of local legend, involving a talent so peculiar it had generations of farm-dwellers chuckling into their handkerchiefs. With a shared grin that signified mutual mischief, they set off toward the nearby pond, a glistening mirror to the vast Midwestern sky. As they approached the water’s edge, Jeb, bare as the day he was born save for his flannel shirt, which hung over his frame like a flag on a pole, commented on the necessity of their disrobing. “Ain’t nobody wanna ruin good pants over fishin’, right?” Hank, equally disrobed and showcasing a behind that could’ve been mistaken for two pumpkins in a sack, agreed wholeheartedly. “True enough. Plus, we gotta let the arsenal breathe.” Their butts, as contrasting as the rest of their physiques – Jeb’s being as bony and angular as a pair of folded garden chairs, and Hank’s as rounded and full as the harvest moon – were now poised dangerously over the pond’s tranquil waters. “On three?” Jeb suggested, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. “Let ‘er rip,” Hank agreed, and with that, they unleashed a torrent of deadly gas into the unsuspecting waters below. The surface of the pond bubbled and frothed as if a great beast stirred below, the stench so unholy it could peel paint from a barn door. The fish, caught in this noxious assault, floated to the surface, surrendering to the unconventional fishing method. Jeb and Hank, seizing the moment, scooped up their prizes, laughing heartily at the absurdity of their success. “Ma’s gonna think we’re geniuses or lunatics,” Hank observed, admiring their catch. “Little from column A, little from column B,” Jeb replied, equally pleased. They made their way back to the farmhouse, their bounty in hand, ready to feast on the fruits of their labor. As they cooked their unconventional catch, the aroma of fried fish filled the kitchen, a testament to their friendship and the lengths (or depths) they’d go to keep life interesting. “Y’know,” Hank began, as they sat down to enjoy their meal, “if farming don’t work out, we could always start a fishing business.” Jeb snorted, nearly choking on a bite of fish. “Yeah, ‘Farts & Fins’ has a nice ring to it.” Their laughter echoed into the golden afternoon, a reminder that in the end, it’s not the method but the madness and camaraderie that make for the best stories."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex accelerating exponential cumulative aggressive formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the margins in both lists can have a wide range. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"**Welcome to the Grand Magic Dueling Arena, Sapphire!** **Your Initial Stats:** - **Spell Power:** 95 (The ability to successfully cast spells.) - **Performance:** 90 (Dictates the quality of the performance, altering the base points of a spell.) **Lily's Initial Stats:** - **Spell Power:** 40 (Due to her young age and inexperience.) - **Performance:** 60 (Energetic but lacking the finesse of experience.) **Magic Dueling Scenario:** As the current teen division champion of magic dueling, your confidence is unshaken, even when 6-year-old Lily challenges you to a match. This will be a spectacle of glamour, beauty, and pure magical prowess in the form of 5 intense rounds. However, unbeknownst to all, Lily casts a cunning spell on you at the duel's start, causing you to regress in age mentally and physically by 2 years after every spell you cast, while she ages by 2 years, gaining maturity and power. **The Complex Accelerating Formula:** After each of your turns, - **Your Stats decrease:** ( NewStat = CurrentStat - left(2 times Turnright) ) - **Lily's Stats increase:** ( NewStat = CurrentStat + left(2 times Turnright) ) **Childishness Factor:** - Starts after your first turn. - **Childish Meter increase per turn:** ( NewChildishness = CurrentChildishness + left(10 times 2^{Turn}right) ) - When the Childish Meter hits 100, your Performance undergoes an additional reduction of 10% from its current status, and the meter resets. **Sapphire's Spells List:** 1. **Aurora Wave** (Spell Power: 95, Base Points: 100) 2. **Glistening Mist** (Spell Power: 90, Base Points: 90) 3. **Diamond Rain** (Spell Power: 85, Base Points: 85) 4. **Celestial Dance** (Spell Power: 80, Base Points: 80) 5. **Butterfly Swarm** (Spell Power: 75, Base Points: 75) 6. **Lunar Glow** (Spell Power: 70, Base Points: 90) 7. **Stardust Whirl** (Spell Power: 65, Base Points: 85) 8. **Rose Blossom** (Spell Power: 60, Base Points: 70) 9. **Sunray Arch** (Spell Power: 55, Base Points: 80) 10. **Twinkling Delight** (Spell Power: 50, Base Points: 60) **Lily's Spells List:** 1. **Frolic of Doves** (Spell Power: 40, Base Points: 50) 2. **Rainbow Ribbon** (Spell Power: 45, Base Points: 60) 3. **Pixie Dust Shower** (Spell Power: 50, Base Points: 70) 4. **Emerald Grass Wave** (Spell Power: 55, Base Points: 60) 5. **Moonbeam Twirl** (Spell Power: 60, Base Points: 80) 6. **Sapphire's Grace** (Stealable from Sapphire, Spell Power: 95, Base Points: 100 + 20 Bonus Points) 7. **Opal Essence** (Spell Power: 65, Base Points: 70) 8. **Whisper of the Willows** (Spell Power: 70, Base Points: 75) 9. **Gleam of the Argent Wing** (Spell Power: 75, Base Points: 85) 10. **Blossom of the Phoenix** (Spell Power: 80, Base Points: 95) **Rules for Spell Casting:** - Spell Power dictates if you can successfully cast the chosen spell. Failure results in 0 points for the round. - Your Performance stat influences the final points of your spell. If you have an 80% Performance and cast a spell with base 90 points, you receive only 72 points. - As the duel progresses, keep in mind the spells you choose. Selecting a spell requiring higher stats than you can handle will fail. - If Lily's stats allow, she can \\"steal\\" spells from your list that you have yet to cast for a bonus point gain. **Scenario Start:** The duel begins magnificently, with the crowd eagerly watching. Sapphire, as the champion, you will cast the first spell. Remember, the secret challenge placed upon you by Lily will test your resilience, strategy, and adaptability to an extreme level. **Choose your first spell to cast and the adventure shall unfold from there, with each choice bringing new consequences and shifting the tide of this magical duel.

However, immediately after casting, another round of regression hits. **Post-Casting Adjustment:** - **Sapphire's Post-Round 2 Stats:** Spell Power drops to 87 (91 - (2 * 2)), and Performance to 84 (88 - (2 * 2)). The age-regression effects compound your challenge. - **Childish Meter:** Fills up to 60/100, as it now increases exponentially. Despite the increasing difficulty, *Diamond Rain* is cast flawlessly.

Sapphire earns a commendable 75 points in the second round, showcasing her skill despite the emerging hindrances. **Lily's Turn:** Feeling ambitious and growing in confidence with her inadvertently boosted abilities, Lily opts for a spell slightly above her grasp before the round - *Pixie Dust Shower*. **Spell Casting:** - *Pixie Dust Shower* requires a Spell Power of 50, slightly above her pre-round ability. Yet, with her stats now boosted (Spell Power: 44, Performance: 64), she struggles but manages a successful cast, benefiting from the dueling arena's magical enhancements. - Her Performance of 64 affects the spell's final outcome. **Points Earned:** - Base Points: 70 - With a 64% Performance: (70 times 0.64 = 44.8), rounded to 45 points.

Add dialogue throughout the story","output":"In the heart of the Midwest, where the horizon stretches like the buffet line at a local diner and the sky paints colors you thought only existed in your grandma's quilt, lived two young farmers, Bob and Joe. Theirs was a friendship solidified by the mutual understanding of early mornings, the backbreaking work of tilling the soil, and an unconventional method of fishing that was as effective as it was humorous. Bob, tall and as lanky as a cornstalk in August, had a walk that resembled a scarecrow brought to life by a particularly whimsical sorcerer. His buddy, Joe, was shorter and built like a potato sack filled with bowling balls—round, sturdy, and surprisingly tough to lift. Both sported the farmer's tan to an impressive degree, their skin a patchwork of sun-kissed brown and startlingly white. \\"Another hot one today, eh Bob?\\" Joe remarked, wiping sweat from his brow as they finished up their morning routine of feeding chickens that had the chaos energy of toddlers on a sugar high. \\"You betcha, Joe. Perfect for our little... fishing trip,\\" Bob replied, the corner of his mouth lifting in a mischievous grin that had seen more than a few pranks in its time. The two friends, having attended to their daily farm duties, which involved an argument with a goat that thought it was a dog and trying to convince a pig that mud wasn't a food group, decided it was high time for a bit of a break. And in the Midwest, \\"a bit of a break\\" often involved fishing. But not just any fishing. Oh no. Bob and Joe had developed a method that was whispered about in hushed tones and accompanied by disbelieving head shakes at the local tavern. As they approached the nearby pond, they began their peculiar ritual. Bob started, \\"You remember the drill, right Joe?\\" \\"As if I could forget,\\" Joe replied, chuckling. \\"Pants and undies off, shirts on. Can't risk sunburn in... delicate places.\\" Thus, they stripped from the waist down, revealing two rears as different as their personalities. Bob's behind was as pale as the moon on a clear night, reflective and likely to blind any unsuspecting passerby with its brilliance. Conversely, Joe's was a testament to his sturdy nature, resembling two pumpkins fighting under a blanket, sturdy and unyielding. Both waded into the pond waist-deep, positioning themselves with the solemnity of monks at a ritual. The air was still, the only sound the gentle lapping of water against fabric. \\"Ready, Bob?\\" \\"Let 'er rip, Joe.\\" And with that, they did. The water around them roiled and bubbled as if a hot spring had suddenly appeared beneath their feet. The sound was reminiscent of a tuba player with a bad case of the hiccups. \\"Golly, that's relieving!\\" Bob exclaimed, a contented sigh following his contribution to the aquatic cacophony. \\"Better out than in,\\" Joe agreed, grinning as bubbles continued to surface. The stench was formidable, a weaponized odor that would've had the EPA raising eyebrows and taking notes. To their delight and the bewilderment of anyone witnessing the spectacle, fish began to float to the surface, victims of an unconventional but undeniably effective fishing method. \\"Well, would you look at that haul, Joe. We'll be eating good tonight!\\" Bob cheered as they gathered the fish, their mission a stinky success. \\"Nothing like a bit of 'natural' fishing, eh Bob? Let's get these beauties cleaned up and fried. I think we've earned it,\\" Joe suggested, both men making their way back to shore, their midwestern modesty covered once more. As they cooked their bounty, the smell of fried fish replacing the remnants of their earlier activities, Bob mused, \\"You think anyone else would ever fish like us, Joe?\\" Joe chuckled, turning a fish over in the pan. \\"I doubt it, Bob. Takes a special kind of genius to come up with our method. Or madness. Probably madness.\\" With that, the two friends settled down to enjoy their meal, their laughter and tales of the day mixing with the warm summer breeze, a testament to the enduring bond of friendship and the unorthodox methods that sometimes result in the best memories. In the heart of the Midwest, where life was as rich and unpredictable as the soil itself, Bob and Joe had found their own slice of paradise, one deadly fart at a time."},{"instruction":"for a thriller game, could it be effectively creepy if the game was simply a nameless character exploring a house in a non-specified place, and the only objective is finding a 'key'. If so, why?","output":"Yes, a thriller game focusing on a nameless character exploring a house in search of a 'key' can definitely be effectively creepy, and there are several reasons why this minimalist approach can work very well: # 1. **Atmosphere and Tension** A large part of what makes a game effectively creepy is its atmosphere. A seemingly ordinary setting like a house can become incredibly eerie when presented with dim lighting, unsettling silence punctuated by strange noises, or an unexplained sense of dread. The lack of a clear context or backstory for being in the house can heighten the tension, as players' imaginations fill in the blanks, often with horrifying possibilities. # 2. **Simplicity and Focus** By stripping down the game mechanics to the simple act of exploring and the singular objective of finding a key, players can become more immersed in the environment and the experience. The simplicity of the goal doesn't distract from the atmospheric tension but enhances the feeling of vulnerability and the psychological aspect of fear. The narrow focus can make every creak and shadow significant, ramping up the suspense. # 3. **Isolation and Vulnerability** The premise of a nameless character alone in an unknown house plays into deep-seated fears of isolation and vulnerability. The lack of identity or backstory for the character can make them an everyman, allowing players to project themselves into the situation more easily. This can make the experience more personal and the suspense more palpable. # 4. **Open-ended Narrative** A minimalist narrative allows players to fill in the gaps with their imagination, potentially crafting a more personally terrifying experience than a fully detailed storyline might. The open-ended nature of such a game, where the only known objective is to find a key, leaves room for speculation about what the key unlocks, why it's important, and what consequences finding or not finding it might have. # 5. **Player-generated Suspense** When a game doesn't specify its threats explicitly, players are left to wonder and worry about what might happen. The anticipation of a scare can be just as powerful, if not more so, than the scare itself. Every shadow or strange sound could potentially be a threat, which can keep players on edge throughout the game. # 6. **Psychological Thriller Elements** A game with such a simple premise can easily incorporate psychological thriller elements that make the player question the reality within the game. Ambiguity surrounding the character's situation—like why they are in the house and what significance the key holds—can lead to a thrilling sense of unease and curiosity. To sum up, a thriller game built around the concept of a character exploring an unspecified house with the goal of finding a key can leverage atmosphere, tension, and player psychology to create an effectively creepy experience. The simplicity of the premise can actually serve to heighten the fear factor, making every tiny detail a source of potential terror."},{"instruction":"До какой даты ограничены твои знания?","output":"Мои знания ограничены информацией, доступной до сентября 2023 года."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

使用 accelerator.backward 代替 loss.backward accelerator.backward(loss) optimizer.step() print(\\"训练完成！\\") \`\`\` 上面的代码片段展示了如何使用 \`accelerate\` 简化训练模型的过程。通过调用 \`accelerator.prepare\` 方法，您的模型、优化器和数据加载器自动适配于您的运行环境，无论是单GPU、多GPU还是CPU。同时，使用 \`accelerator.backward\` 直接替换了标准的 \`loss.backward()\`，以确保与 \`accelerate\` 的其他部分兼容。 # 混合精度和分布式训练 \`accelerate\` 同样支持混合精度训练和分布式训练，这两种技术都是提高模型训练效率和速度的重要手段。启用混合精度训练非常简单： \`\`\`python accelerator = Accelerator(fp16=True) # 开启混合精度 \`\`\` 而对于分布式训练，\`accelerate\` 会自动检测您的环境设置（如通过环境变量配置的多GPU系统）并据此进行优化，无需手动配置。 # 总结 Hugging Face 的 \`accelerate\` 库为深度学习模型训练提供了简单而强大的加速机制，无论是在CPU还是GPU上，都可以更方便地进行分布式训练和混合精度训练。通过抽象掉底层的许多复杂性，它允许研究人员和开发人员将更多精力集中在模型的设计和实验上，而不是环境配置和优化。"},{"instruction":"通过acclerate 库 调用def inference(model_path=\\"/data/wanghui01/models/deepseek-coder-7b-instruct-v1.5\\"): result = \\"\\" config = LlamaConfig.from_pretrained(model_path) with init_empty_weights(): model = LlamaForCausalLM(config) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True) model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch( model, checkpoint=model_path, device_map=\\"auto\\" ) print(type(model)) messages = [{\\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\"content\\": \\"写一个快速排序\\"}] inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template( messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors=\\"pt\\" ).to(\\"cuda\\") outputs = model.generate( inputs, max_new_tokens=512, do_sample=False, top_k=50, top_p=0.95, num_return_sequences=1, eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id, ) print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][len(inputs[0]) :], skip_special_tokens=True)) 报错：RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cuda:1! 是怎么回事","output":"当你遇到错误消息 \\"RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cuda:1!\\"，这表示在进行模型的前向传递或其他操作时，参与计算的张量（tensors）位于不同的CUDA设备上。在PyTorch中，进行任何形式的张量运算时，参与该运算的所有张量必须位于同一设备上（即所有张量都在CPU上或都在同一GPU上）。 这个问题经常出现在使用了多个GPU设备进行计算的情况下。看到你提供的代码，特别是这一行： \`\`\`python model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch(model, checkpoint=model_path, device_map=\\"auto\\") \`\`\` 函数\`load_checkpoint_and_dispatch\`根据\`device_map=\\"auto\\"\`自动将模型的各个部件分配到了不同的GPU设备上。而当你将输入数据直接发送到了特定的设备（比如\`\\"cuda\\"\`），就可能造成输入数据和模型部件不在同一设备上的情况。 解决此问题的方法之一是确保模型和输入数据都位于同一设备上。这可以通过明确指定设备并确保模型和数据位于该设备上来实现，例如，如果你的系统具有多个GPU，可以选择一个专门的GPU来运行整个模型和数据。 此外，在使用\`accelerate\`库时，你可以通过\`accelerate\`来管理模型和数据的设备放置，以保证它们始终同步。示例代码可能需要相应调整以充分利用\`accelerate\`提供的设备管理特性。 适当地修改你的代码以确保一致性可能包括使用\`Accelerator\`来处理设备分配，示例如下（注意，这里只是一个方向，并未直接修改你的代码）： \`\`\`python from accelerate import Accelerator accelerator = Accelerator() model = LlamaForCausalLM(config) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True) model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch(model, checkpoint=model_path, device_map=\\"auto\\") #

They are particularly useful in cases where you do not have a labeled dataset (i.e., you do not know beforehand which samples are anomalies or 'mutations' in this context). Let's evaluate each of the given options in relation to unsupervised anomaly detection for classifying tissue samples as either normal or mutated. **A. There are very few occurrences of mutations relative to normal samples.** - **Support for this method:** This characteristic is fundamental for unsupervised anomaly detection to be effective. Anomaly detection algorithms work best when the anomalies (in this case, mutated tissue samples) are rare compared to the normal data. The scarcity of anomalies allows these algorithms to learn what \\"normal\\" looks like so that it can identify anything that deviates significantly from that norm as an anomaly. - **Against this method:** There isn't a strong argument against this characteristic for unsupervised anomaly detection; it's essentially the scenario these methods are designed for. **B. There are roughly equal occurrences of both normal and mutated samples in the database.** - **Against this method:** This scenario is not ideal for unsupervised anomaly detection. If mutated samples are as common as normal samples, then neither type is truly an \\"anomaly\\" in the statistical sense. Supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled examples of both classes, would be more appropriate in this case. **C. You expect future mutations to have different features from the mutated samples in the database.** - **Support for this method:** Unsupervised anomaly detection is suitable for this situation because it does not rely on pre-labeled examples to learn what makes a sample an anomaly. Since it learns what is normal and flags what is significantly different, it can potentially detect new types of mutations as anomalies, even if they do not share the exact features of past mutations. - **Against this method:** If future mutations are vastly different from current normal data, there could be a risk of the model not having enough similarity to base its detection on; however, this largely depends on the diversity of the \\"normal\\" samples and the extent of the differences in future mutations. **D. You expect future mutations to have similar features to the mutated samples in the database.** - **Against this method:** This point is more aligned with supervised learning, where having labeled examples of mutations can help the model learn specific features associated with mutations. If future mutations are expected to be similar to known mutations, this knowledge could be used to label data and train a supervised model rather than relying on unsupervised techniques. **E. You already have labels for which samples are mutated and which are normal in the database.** - **Against this method:** This is a scenario where supervised learning would be preferable to unsupervised anomaly detection. With labeled data available, you can train a model to understand the specific features that distinguish normal from mutated samples, potentially achieving higher accuracy than with unsupervised methods. Unsupervised methods are best when you do not have such labels. In summary, characteristic **A** and **C** support the use of an unsupervised anomaly detection method. **A** provides the ideal scenario of rarity necessary for anomaly detection to work effectively. **C** aligns with the flexibility of anomaly detection in identifying new, unseen anomalies. **B**, **D**, and **E** present scenarios where supervised learning methods might be more appropriate due to either the balanced occurrence of classes, the expectation of similar mutations in the future, or the availability of labeled data, respectively."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It was inhabited by two young friends, Jacek and Wojtek, both of whom were as inseparable as they were peculiar. They had a unique routine unlike any other farmers in the vicinity. Every morning, just as the first rays of the sun kissed the dew-laden grass, Jacek and Wojtek would rise from their beds, groaning and stretching, their muscles flexing under their simple, worn-out clothes. They would then proceed to undertake the day’s tasks, which involved a comical orchestra of chasing chickens back into their pens - Wojtek, with his longer legs and lanky frame, would often get pecked, while Jacek, shorter but stockier, somehow always ended up tangled in the fence. By midday, after a series of mishaps that would have made even the gloomiest of souls burst into laughter, the duo would sit under the shade of an old oak tree, relishing their meager meal of bread and cheese. It was during one of these breaks that Jacek, rubbing his somewhat rounded belly, turned to Wojtek and announced, “I reckon it’s time we fetched ourselves some fish for dinner, don’t you think?” Wojtek, scratching his sinewy back, grinned in agreement. “Ah, the usual method then?” he chuckled. And so, the pair set off toward the nearby pond, shedding their trousers and undergarments along the way, much to the amusement of the farm animals. Jacek’s behind, akin to two pillows squished together, and Wojtek’s, flat as a pancake yet oddly muscular, were now exposed to the gentle breeze. “Do you ever think,” Wojtek began, wading waist-deep into the pond, the water dancing around his thighs, “that there’s a more... traditional way to fish?” Jacek let out a hearty laugh, causing ripples to spread across the surface. “And miss out on the joy of seeing the fish keel over from our deadly gases? Never!” Positioning themselves back-to-back, they prepared for the unusual harvest. “On three,” counted Jacek, “One… two…” Together, they released a thunderous fart into the pond, causing bubbles to furiously erupt around them. Their faces, a picture of innocent relief mixed with mischief, couldn’t help but crinkle into smiles as they witnessed the effect of their potent weapon. “Like shooting fish in a barrel!” Wojtek exclaimed, watching as a handful of fish floated to the surface, victims of the stench. The duo wasted no time in collecting their haul, their laughter echoing across the farm as they made their way back, pants still dangling from their shoulders. Back in the kitchen, with the fish cleaned and cooking over the fire, Jacek couldn’t resist a jest. “You know, some would say our method is groundbreaking.” “More like windbreaking,” Wojtek retorted, and their laughter filled the room once more. Indeed, in their little part of Poland, Jacek and Wojtek were legends in their own right. Not for their farming skills, perhaps, but certainly for their unorthodox yet effective fishing technique. And as they settled down to enjoy their meal, the sun dipping below the horizon, they knew there was no other life they’d rather lead."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Сколько детей пришло в садик без игрушек?","output":"Итак, из информации, что половина всех детей принесла по 2 игрушки, получаем, что 40 детей принесли по 2 игрушки каждый. Это означает, что игрушек, принесённых двумя игрушками, всего 80 (потому что каждый из этих детей принёс ровно 2). Известно, что грузовик принесли 11 детей и только грузовик, поэтому они входят в число детей, которые принесли всего одну игрушку. Что касается тех, кто принес только совок или только ведёрко, то их в сумме 5 человек. Таким образом, мы уже знаем, что 11 (с грузовиками) + 5 (только с совком или ведёрком) = 16 детей принесли по одной игрушке. Если у нас всего 80 детей и 40 из них принесли по две игрушки, то игрушек, принесённых этими 40 детьми, будет 80, как мы уже установили. Из них нужно вычесть тех детей, которые принесли только одну игрушку (16 детей), чтобы понять, сколько детей вообще не принесли игрушки. Но сначала поймем, сколько всего было принесено игрушек. У нас 11 грузовиков, и допустим x - это количество совков, y - ведерок. Мы знаем, что дети с совками и ведёрками в сумме составляют 5 человек, значит x + y = 5. Эти игрушки принесли по одной. Так как 40 детей принесли по 2 игрушки, то общее количество игрушек, принесённых в сад, составляет 80 (дети с двумя игрушками) + 11 (грузовики) + x + y (совки и ведёрки, и x + y = 5). Но, так как никто другой игрушки не принёс кроме этих категорий, и каждый из 40 детей принёс 2 игрушки, то все остальные игрушки уже учтены в этих 80. Получается, совок и ведёрко уже учтены в части двойных игрушек. 11 детей с грузовиками и 5 детей с совком/ведёрком составляют тех, кто принес всего одну игрушку, всего 16 детей. Так что, на самом деле, для определения, сколько детей пришло без игрушек, мы берём общее число детей (80) и вычитаем тех, кто принёс хотя бы одну игрушку (40 детей с двумя игрушками и 16 детей с одной игрушкой принесли всего 56 детей). 80 - 56 = 24 ребёнка пришли в садик без игрушек."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in Russia.

Here's a simplified guide to get you started. Note that while there are many free tools available, some features or services might be limited unless you opt for paid versions. # For Creating a Free Website: 1. **Plan Your Comic Content**: Before diving into building a website, know what kind of comics you want to publish, the target audience, update frequency, etc. 2. **Choose a Website Builder**: Use a free website builder that doesn't require coding skills, such as WordPress.com, Wix, or Weebly. These platforms have free plans and templates optimized for visual content like comics. 3. **Select a Template**: Choose a template that fits the visual style of your comics. Many website builders offer templates specifically designed for artists and galleries. 4. **Customize the Template**: Using the website builder's tools, customize your chosen template to suit your branding and comic style. You can usually change colors, fonts, layout, and more. 5. **Add Your Content**: Upload your comics, create an engaging homepage, about page, and contact page. If your platform allows, categorize your comics for easier navigation. 6. **Publish Your Site**: After reviewing your site and making sure everything is set, publish it. Most free website builders will host your site on a subdomain (e.g., yourcomicname.wordpress.com). 7. **Promote Your Comic Website**: Use social media, comic forums, and other platforms to share your website and reach your target audience. # For Creating a Free App: Creating an app involves more complexity, especially if you're looking for a completely free option. For simplicity and to avoid the need for programming: 1. **Use an App Builder**: Platforms like Appy Pie, BuildFire, or AppMakr offer a no-code approach to app development, some with free plans. These might be somewhat limiting but are a good start. 2. **Select a Design**: Choose a layout that showcases your comics effectively. Many app builders offer templates or drag-and-drop interfaces to help you. 3. **Customize Your App**: Add your comics, choose colors, and decide how you want your app to function. For a comic app, you might want features like a comic reader, categories, and possibly in-app purchases if you plan to monetize your content in the future. 4. **Test Your App**: Use the tools available on the app builder platform to test your app on different devices to ensure a good user experience. 5. **Publish Your App**: Publishing your app may require you to have developer accounts on platforms like Google Play Store or Apple App Store. While the app builders might be free, be aware that these platforms typically charge fees for developer accounts. # Considerations: 1. **Monetization**: If you plan to make money from your comics, research monetization options early. This might influence your choice of website builder or app platform. 2. **Rights and Privacy**: Make sure you understand the terms of service of any platform you use, especially concerning the ownership rights of your uploaded content and how user data is handled. 3. **Scaling Up**: Consider future growth. As your audience grows, you might need to move to a paid plan or a more customizable solution to accommodate your needs. Creating a free comic website and app is an excellent way to start sharing your work with the world. However, be prepared to invest time in learning and possibly upgrading to paid services as your requirements expand."},{"instruction":"Online job work at home website","output":"If you're seeking online job opportunities that allow you to work from home, here's a list of reputable websites where you can start your search.

Though most platforms will take a percentage of your sales as a fee, you can start without needing to invest money for hosting or development. Here’s how you can leverage these platforms effectively: # 1. Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) Amazon’s KDP is a popular choice for self-publishing authors. It’s free to publish, and your story books will be available on the Amazon marketplace, which reaches millions of readers globally. You earn royalties on your sales, but Amazon does take a cut. - **Pros**: Wide audience, print-on-demand options, and Kindle Unlimited subscriptions can earn you money based on pages read. - **Cons**: Competition is fierce, and Amazon takes a percentage of sales. # 2. Smashwords Smashwords is an e-book distribution platform that makes your book available in multiple formats across various retailers, including Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Apple Books, and more. It’s free to publish, and Smashwords takes a small portion of sales. - **Pros**: Wide distribution, control over pricing, and higher royalty rates compared to some platforms. - **Cons**: The platform's reach may not be as extensive as Amazon's. # 3. Lulu Lulu offers a platform for both eBooks and print-on-demand physical books. It’s free to publish, and Lulu provides global distribution options, including its own storefront, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and others. - **Pros**: Wide range of format options, including print, and control over pricing. - **Cons**: Lulu takes a cut of your profits, and physical books have production costs deducted from sales. # 4. Wattpad Wattpad is a community of writers and readers where you can publish your storybook for free. While directly selling books on Wattpad isn’t the primary focus, gaining a large following can lead to monetization opportunities through Wattpad’s Paid Stories program or attracting publishers. - **Pros**: Excellent platform for building an audience and receiving feedback. - **Cons**: Monetization can be indirect and might take time. # 5. Draft2Digital Similar to Smashwords, Draft2Digital offers eBook distribution to several storefronts like Apple Books, Barnes & Noble, and Kobo. It’s free to use their services, and they take a percentage of sales as their fee. - **Pros**: Easy to use, automated formatting tools, and broad distribution. - **Cons**: Like other distribution platforms, they take a cut of your sales. # Building Your Own Website While building a website to sell your books isn’t free due to hosting and domain costs, platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Weebly offer free plans or trials. You could start with a free plan to build your website and leverage PayPal or Stripe for transactions, moving to a paid plan for more features as you grow. # Tips for Selling Story Books Successfully: - **Marketing is Key**: Use social media, email marketing, and other online platforms to market your books. - **Quality Matters**: Ensure your book covers are professionally designed and your book content is well-edited. - **Gather Reviews**: Encourage readers to leave reviews to build credibility. - **Offer Promotions**: Free giveaways or discounted pricing for a limited time can help garner interest. - **Leverage Analytics**: Use the data provided by platforms to understand your audience better and target your marketing efforts effectively. Choosing the right platform depends on your specific needs, the level of control you want over pricing and distribution, and whether you're focusing on eBook or print formats. Combining several platforms can also be an effective strategy to maximize your reach and sales potential."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in Britain.

How about I tell a witty and imaginative story about two young friends who are farmers in Britain, with a unique and family-friendly twist? Let's dive into their adventure! --- In the lush, green countryside of Britain, there lived two young, enthusiastic farmers named Toby and Jasper. They weren't your ordinary farmers; they had a sense of humor that could make even the sternest cow chuckle. Their friendship was as thick as the manure they spread in the fields - inseparable and, admittedly, a bit smelly. Each morning, Toby, with his mop of unruly hair that looked suspiciously like a nesting site for birds, would leap out of bed, don his overalls, and rush to Jasper's door, leaving a trail of laughter in his wake. Jasper, tall and lanky, with spectacles perpetually perched on his nose, would be ready, armed with a pitchfork, looking more like a gentle giant than a fierce farmer. Their routine on the farm was anything but usual. They'd start with the chickens, which they had lovingly named after various British monarchs. \\"Morning, Queen Elizabeth!\\" Toby would chirp, tossing feed, while Jasper rolled his eyes, remarking, \\"You do know she's the second, right?\\" By the time they'd move on to milking the cows, Jasper's aim to innovate the process with a vacuum cleaner last week was still the talk of the township. The cows had looked as perplexed as their mechanical milker, but the milk had never been frothier! One bright morning, as they leaned on their shovels, pondering their lunch prospects, Toby had a eureka moment. \\"Let's fish in the pond today, Jasp! But let's make it interesting,\\" he winked. Jasper, ever the skeptic, raised an eyebrow. \\"What mischief are you concocting now?\\" Toby's plan was unconventional, to say the least. It involved them attempting to catch fish not with nets or rods, but by startling them. How, you might ask? By tickling. Yes, tickling each other until they laughed so hard it scared the fish right out of the water. With a shrug and a chuckle, they ambled to the nearby pond, armed with nothing but their wits and a bucket. \\"Don't you dare tickle me under the armpits; you know I'm helpless there!\\" Jasper warned, only half-serious. \\"You have my word, dear Watson. I shall aim for the knees!\\" Toby declared in his best detective accent, rolling up his sleeves like a man on a mission. Wading into the pond, they looked a sight to behold. Two grown men, knee-deep in water, trying their utmost to keep a straight face. It didn’t last long. Soon, peals of laughter echoed across the farm, blending with the sounds of nature in a symphony of joy. And would you believe it? Their laughter sent ripples through the pond, startling a number of fish right into their bucket. They hadn't seen it coming; neither had the fish, apparently. Triumphant and chuckling, they returned to the farmhouse, their catch in tow. \\"Who would've thought, haha, tickling, the best fishing method!\\" Toby gasped between laughs. Jasper shook his head, amused. \\"Only us, Toby. Only us.\\" Under the shade of an old oak, they cleaned and cooked their fish, the aroma of herbs filling the air. It was a meal fit for kings, or at least for two merry farmers. Their laughter, as hearty as their appetite, was a testament to a friendship built on joy, creativity, and a shared love for the unexpected. In the rolling hills of Britain, amidst the clucking and the mooing, Toby and Jasper had found a little slice of paradise, one hilarious adventure at a time."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in Lithuania.

Their friendship was as old as the oak trees lining the village outskirts, and their antics were as legendary as the tales of old. These two weren’t your run-of-the-mill cultivators; they had a flair for the extraordinary, blending the mundane with the utterly hilarious. Every morning, as the sun peeked like a shy maiden over the hilly bosoms of Lithuania, you'd find Jonas and Martynas following a routine that was anything but. After milking the cows, which often involved an impromptu milking contest (Jonas always claimed the cows chuckled along), and chasing the chickens back into their coop, which resembled more of a slapstick chase scene from an old film, they’d settle into the less comedic, albeit essential, tasks of tilling and planting. “Martynas, my brother, do you feel the day beckoning us towards adventure?” Jonas would often say, wiping the sweat from his brow with a straw hat that had seen better decades. Martynas, ever the quintessential sidekick with a twinkle in his eye, replied, “More like it’s calling us to a nap, but your kind of adventure sounds more lively.” It was on one such day, under the relentless gaze of the midday sun, that Jonas and Martynas decided that a change in their dietary routine was overdue. Since time immemorial, or at least since last Tuesday, the staple of their diet had been potatoes in various disguises. But today, they craved fish, and not just any fish, but those caught using their infamously deadly method. With a conspiratorial grin, Jonas announced, “It’s time to deploy the secret weapon.” Martynas, chuckling, replied, “You mean your rear-end secret weapon?” Without a hint of modesty, both friends stripped down to their shirts, revealing two derrières as contrasting as their personalities. Jonas, tall and lanky, his physique reminiscent of a beanpole, had a posterior that looked like it could hardly withstand a gentle breeze. Martynas, on the other hand, was built more robustly, his butt a testament to the many hours of laborious farm work, and perhaps, an extra helping of potatoes. As they made their way to the pond, an absurd pair by any standard, their dialogue was as buoyant as their spirits. “Do you think we’ll be remembered as pioneers of aquaculture?” Martynas mused. “More like pioneers of trauma for any witnesses,” Jonas quipped, as they reached the water's edge. Waist-deep in the pond, they prepared for the act. The anticipation was palpable, the scene almost surreal – two shirt-clad farmers standing in solemn dignity before unleashing chaos. As they let out their farts, the water around them roiled and bubbled as if a monstrous, unseen beast stirred beneath. Their faces contorted in a mix of relief and mischievous delight, an image so profoundly ridiculous, it could only inhabit the realms of the absurd. The pond's inhabitants, unaccustomed to such a deadly olfactory assault, succumbed en masse. Jonas and Martynas collected the fish with glee, their laughter echoing off the water, disturbing the otherwise peaceful Lithuanian countryside. “Who needs fishing rods or nets, eh?” Martynas said, with a grin wide enough to shame the Cheshire Cat. “Indeed, who needs dignity when you have efficiency?” Jonas retorted, as they made their way back, their bounty in tow. That lunchtime, as they cooked their ill-gotten gains, the aroma of grilled fish blending with the pastoral scents of the farm, they contemplated their unconventional method. “We should patent this technique,” Jonas joked, flipping a fish with a flourish. Martynas nodded sagely, “Yes, ‘Fart Fishing: A Lithuanian Tradition.’ We could start tours.” As they dug into their feast, their laughter and banter rising like the smoke from their grill, it was clear that these two friends had found the perfect recipe for happiness: a dash of the absurd, a sprinkle of adventure, and a hefty serving of camaraderie. And so, in a little corner of Lithuania, life was anything but ordinary, thanks to two young farmers with pioneering spirits (and posterior potency) that were as indomitable as they were hilarious."},{"instruction":"митфорд дж. «тюремный бизнес» краткое","output":"Сюжет романа \\"Тюремный бизнес\\" Джона Митфорда описывает жизнь заключенного по фамилии Лоуренс, который работает в тюремной библиотеке и пытается восстановить свою адвокатскую лицензию.

Los elementales del","output":"En una realidad alterna a la de Karma Switch y de la serie Ben 10, los Elementales del universo desempeñan un papel crucial en mantener el equilibrio entre las múltiples dimensiones. Estos seres, que poseen habilidades únicas basadas en los elementos fundamentales de la naturaleza – tierra, aire, fuego, agua, y algunos incluso controlan elementos más esotéricos como la energía, el tiempo y el espacio –, trabajan en silencio desde las sombras de la historia, asegurando que las fuerzas del mal no perturben la armonía entre los mundos. En esta realidad, los Elementales y los personajes de Ben 10 se encuentran cuando una amenaza interdimensional inminente se hace presente, obligando a los héroes – Ben Tennyson, con su Omnitrix que le permite transformarse en múltiples alienígenas, y los Elementales, con sus poderes únicos – a unir fuerzas. El villano de esta aventura es Eon, un enemigo conocido por los seguidores de Ben 10, quien esta vez ha adquirido la capacidad de saltar entre dimensiones, buscando corromper la esencia de los Elementales para crear una superarma capaz de doblegar la realidad a su voluntad. Eon comprende que el poder puro de los Elementales, combinado con las múltiples formas alienígenas de Ben, representaría una amenaza inigualable para sus planes, por lo que se propone capturarlos o eliminarlos antes de que puedan unirse y detenerlo. Ben, al principio, encuentra desafiante la tarea de colaborar con seres cuyas capacidades van más allá de lo que su Omnitrix puede manifestar, pero rápidamente aprende el valor de la diversidad y la fuerza que viene de la complementariedad de sus habilidades. Los Elementales, por otro lado, que están acostumbrados a trabajar en soledad, descubren en Ben una fuente inesperada de inspiración y coraje humano. A lo largo de su aventura, descubren que numerosas realidades han comenzado a colapsar debido a las acciones de Eon, lo que lleva a un clímax en donde los héroes tienen que enfrentar un ejército de versiones alteradas de ellos mismos corrompidas por Eon. Para contrarrestar esta fuerza abrumadora, Ben y los Elementales deben confiar plenamente los unos en los otros, combinando sus poderes de formas innovadoras para salvar no solo su realidad, sino todas las existencias del multiverso. En última instancia, la historia no solo es una batalla épica entre el bien y el mal, sino también una exploración de cómo las diferencias pueden unirse para formar una fuerza invencible. Esta realidad alterna de Karma Switch y Ben 10 demuestra que, independientemente de cuán distintos puedan ser los héroes, la cooperación y el entendimiento mutuo son esenciales para superar las adversidades más desafiantes."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in Russia.

Bu yüzden, ağ genişleticiler tipik olarak ağdaki cihazlara IP adresi dağıtmak yerine, ana modem/router'ın DHCP özelliğini kullanırlar. Eğer Mi AX1800 gibi bir WiFi extender'a DHCP özelliği eklemek istiyorsanız, bu genellikle yazılımsal bir güncelleme veya özel bir firmware yüklemesi ile mümkün olabilir. Ancak, çok spesifik durumlar dışında, bu tür bir değişiklik üretici tarafından desteklenmeyebilir ve cihazın garantisini geçersiz kılabilir. Ayrıca, özel firmwarelerin yüklenmesi cihaza zarar verebilir veya güvenlik açıklarına yol açabilir. Çözüm olarak, eğer ağınızdaki cihazlara IP adresi atama konusunda daha fazla kontrol veya esneklik istiyorsanız, genellikle en iyi çözüm ana modem/router'ınızın DHCP ayarlarını yönetmek veya daha gelişmiş bir router kullanmaktır. Bu şekilde, tüm ağınızdaki IP adresi yönetimini merkezi olarak kontrol edebilirsiniz. Eğer mevcut ağ yapılandırmanızda özel bir ihtiyaçtan dolayı bir WiFi extender üzerinde DHCP server özelliği arıyorsanız, farklı bir cihaz modeli veya daha gelişmiş bir ağ cihazı kullanmayı düşünmelisiniz. Bu tür durumlar için tasarlanmış cihazlar pazarda mevcuttur ve bu ihtiyacınızı daha uygun şekilde karşılayabilir."},{"instruction":"firmware e nasıl bu özelliği ekleyebilirim","output":"Firmware'e yeni bir özellik eklemek, özellikle DHCP sunucu özelliği gibi karmaşık bir işlevsellik söz konusu olduğunda, oldukça teknik ve riskli bir süreçtir. Bu tür değişiklikler, genellikle cihaz üreticisi veya çok deneyimli yazılım geliştiricileri tarafından yapılır. Eğer bu konuda deneyiminiz yoksa, cihazınıza zarar verebilir, kullanılamaz hale getirebilir veya güvenlik açıklarına neden olabilirsiniz. Ancak, bu süreci anlamak açısından genel bir bakış sunalım: 1. **Firmware Kaynak Koduna Erişim:** Firmware'e bir özellik eklemek için ilk adım, cihazın mevcut firmware'inin kaynak koduna erişmektir. Birçok üretici, firmware'in kaynak kodunu yayınlamaz. Eğer açık kaynaklı bir firmware kullanıyorsanız veya kaynak kodu halka açık olarak mevcutsa, bu adımı geçebilirsiniz. 2. **Geliştirme Ortamının Kurulumu:** Firmware üzerinde çalışmak için uygun bir geliştirme ortamı kurmanız gerekecek. Bu, genellikle bir çapraz derleyici (cross compiler) ve firmware'i geliştirmek için gerekli diğer araçlardan oluşur. 3. **DHCP Sunucu İşlevselliğinin Yazılması/Entegrasyonu:** DHCP sunucu işlevselliğini firmware'e eklemek, ilgili DHCP protokolünü anlamak ve bu protokolü cihazın donanımı ve mevcut software mimarisiyle uyumlu bir şekilde uygulamayı gerektirir. Bu aşama, ağ protokolleri hakkında derinlemesine bilgi sahibi olmayı ve genellikle C dili gibi düşük seviye bir programlama dilinde kod yazmayı gerektirir. 4. **Test Edilmesi:** Yeni olarak eklenen işlevsellikle birlikte firmware'i cihazınıza yüklemeyi denemeden önce kapsamlı bir şekilde test etmek çok önemlidir. Bu testler, olası hataları ve uyumsuzlukları bulmak için simülasyon ortamlarında veya benzer donanımlar üzerinde yapılabilir. 5. **Firmware'in Yüklenmesi:** Testler başarılı olduktan sonra, firmware'i cihaza yükleyebilirsiniz. Bu genellikle bir seri bağlantı portu veya cihazın kendisi tarafından sağlanan bir arayüz üzerinden yapılır. Ancak, firmware güncellemeleri riskli olabilir ve cihazın kullanılmaz hale gelmesine yol açabilir. Bu süreçler, genellikle gelişmiş teknik bilgi ve deneyim gerektirir. Ürününüzün garantisi veya yasal yükümlülükleriniz konusunda olası sonuçları göz önünde bulundurduğunuzdan emin olun. Cihazınız için resmi güncellemeleri veya desteklenen third-party firmware'leri araştırmak genellikle daha güvenli bir yol olacaktır."},{"instruction":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic story set in Russia.

Farmers by trade and mischief-makers by choice, these two were the heart and soul of their small village. Their daily routine was nothing short of an orchestrated ballet of chaos, blending traditional farming methods with a healthy dose of Slavic ingenuity and humor. Each morning began with Ivan stretching his sinewy, scarecrow-like frame, bones popping like a melody as he greeted the sun. Boris, stockier and as sturdy as the oak barrels he often found himself wrestling with during harvest, would already be up, attempting to milk a surprisingly agile and uncooperative goat. \\"Boris, you look like you're dancing the worst polka of your life!\\" Ivan would heckle, dodging a stray hooves aimed at his head. \\"Better than your crow’s waltz when you try to catch the chickens, Ivan!\\" Boris would retort, finally managing to corral the goat. Their mornings were filled with the usual farm duties - sowing seeds, tending to the animals, and getting into small, comedic squabbles. Yet, it was their unconventional method of fishing that truly set them apart from the rest of the village. One particularly balmy afternoon, after a hard morning's work, Ivan slapped Boris on the back. \\"Comrade, it is a splendid day for fishing, don't you think?\\" With a mischievous glint in his eye, Boris nodded. \\"Ah, yes. The traditional way, with our...special technique?\\" Grinning wide enough to scare a scarecrow, Ivan nodded enthusiastically. \\"Precisely! Let’s not dilly dally!\\" Off they went, striding side by side towards the nearby pond, shedding their clothes along the way until they were only in their shirts. Ivan’s lean, lanky buttocks seemed almost at odds with the rest of his wiry physique, while Boris’s rear was as broad and powerful as the rest of him, each cheek resembling a small, determined boulder. \\"As elegant as ever, Ivan. You could be a swan, if swans had skeletons for buttocks,\\" Boris teased, observing Ivan's backside. \\"And you, Boris, could be mistaken for two bears fighting under a blanket,\\" Ivan shot back, unperturbed. Waist-deep in the cool pond water, they positioned themselves back-to-back, grinning like fools. \\"Ready, comrade?\\" Ivan asked, focusing on the task at hand. \\"Let the symphony begin,\\" Boris declared with an air of exaggerated solemnity. Then, with all the grace and finesse of two semi-naked farmers in a pond, they both relaxed and released. The water around them bubbled and churned as if a minor seismic event had occurred beneath the surface. The relief was immediate and palpable, their expressions of bliss utterly comical. \\"Oh, the joy of traditional methods,\\" Ivan sighed, almost dreamily, as the bubbles continued to surface. \\"Look, the fish! They succumb to our mighty...erm, technique,\\" Boris pointed out, triumph in his voice as tiny silver bodies began to float up. They collected the stunned fish in silence, expressions of satisfaction and pride lighting up their faces. Heading back to their clothes, they dressed and prepared for the short walk home. \\"Our village will feast tonight, Boris.\\" \\"Indeed, Ivan. Powered by the strength of our...endowments.\\" Back at the farm, they cleaned their catch and cooked it up, the rich aroma of fish stew filling the air. Sitting down to enjoy their meal, they clinked glasses of homemade kvass. \\"To us, Boris, the finest fishers in all of Russia.\\" \\"And to our unorthodox methods, may they never fail us.\\" As they ate, laughter filled the air, mingling with the scent of their successful catch. These moments, in their perfectly imperfect world, were what made their life truly rich."},{"instruction":"Из этого отзыва создай пять новых отзывов, о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Юг Центр Авто.

Вежливый молодой человек рассказал подробно про машину. Показал документы. Всё было в порядке. Что бы началось оформление документов с меня взяли залог 70 тыс. Потом начались чудеса. Оказывается, что за коврики, диски на колёсах, встроенные колонки! мне нужно доплатить + НДС и менеджер улыбаясь озвучил цифру в 1850000 руб. На мои слова, что нужной суммы у меня нет, мне предложили оформить кредит. Естественно я отказалась и потребовала вернуть залог. Мне посоветовали повнимательнее почитать договор, в котором ясно прописано на 8 странице, что внесённый залог не возвращается. Не верьте обещаниям низких цен. Не вносите никакие залоги. Не попадайтесь на ту же удочку.","output":"1. Мой опыт покупки Renault Kaptur в Юг Центр Авто оставил после себя одни разочарования. Всё началось так заманчиво: объявленная цена на авто была невероятно привлекательной. Я ещё подумал: \\"Вот это удача!\\" Однако радость была преждевременной. После того, как я проявил интерес и приехал в салон, начался цирк с конями. За каждую мелочь, даже за стандартное оборудование, просят доплату. Законный вопрос о стоимости превратился в фарс, когда мне насчитали стоимость авто в полтора раза выше изначальной. Менеджеры пытались меня убедить, что это норма. Нет, это не норма, это безобразие! Честность и прозрачность для них - пустые слова. 2. Приобретение Toyota Camry в автосалоне Юг Центр Авто стало настоящим испытанием для моих нервов. На сайте заманивают клиентов низкими ценами, а когда дело доходит до реальной покупки, цена внезапно \\"прыгает\\" вверх на невообразимые суммы! Менеджер, сначала изливавший медовые обещания, внезапно оказался настоящим шарлатаном. То, как они пытались впарить мне кучу не нужных опций по астрономическим ценам, просто поражает. Вдобавок ко всему, когда я отказался от предложения, начались уговоры оформить кредит. Вся эта ситуация оставила меня не только без машины, но и с крайне негативным впечатлением о данном салоне. 3. Ужасный опыт покупки автомобиля Skoda Octavia в Юг Центр Авто! Никогда бы не подумал, что в современном салоне могут так открыто обманывать клиентов. Цена автомобиля, заявленная на сайте, и окончательная цена, которую озвучили в салоне, разошлись на сотни тысяч рублей. Менеджеры еще пытались меня убедить, что все \\"дополнительные\\" услуги и оборудование абсолютно необходимы. Мои возражения игнорировались, а когда я начал требовать обоснования такого расчета, менеджер просто увел разговор в сторону. Я чувствовал себя обманутым и брошенным. Недопустимо такое отношение к покупателям! 4. Выбрал Volkswagen Polo в Юг Центр Авто и очень пожалел о своем выборе. В рекламе обещают одно, а на деле - совершенно другое. Казалось бы, цена слишком хороша, чтобы быть правдой, и это оказалось фактом. Дополнительные услуги, которые оказались \\"обязательными\\", взвинтили стоимость автомобиля до небес. На мои претензии менеджер лишь пожал плечами и посоветовал \\"идти в другой салон, если что-то не устраивает\\". Непрофессионально и крайне некорректно. Пообещал себе никогда больше не связываться с Юг Центр Авто. 5. Со словами о выгодной покупке я посетил салон Юг Центр Авто, рассчитывая приобрести Lada Vesta. Всё, что было обещано в рекламе, оказалось обманом. Цена, которую мне предложили в итоге, превысила рекламную на 30%. Менеджер пытался манипулировать мною, предлагая услуги и опции, которые явно не стоили заявленных денег. Когда я начал задавать неудобные вопросы относительно разницы в цене, менеджер вести себя все более агрессивно и навязчиво. Осознав, что мне тут не помогут, я решил отказаться от покупки. Но сделать это оказалось не так просто, так как в договоре был пункт о не возвращении залога. После этого опыта я точно знаю, что не стоит доверять салону Юг Центр Авто."},{"instruction":"You are training a spam classifier. You notice that you are overfitting the training data.
