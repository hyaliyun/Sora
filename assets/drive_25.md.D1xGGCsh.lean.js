Part a): Proving H is the Orthocenter of Triangle ABC 1. **Form a Rhombus:**    - Since A_{1}, B_{1}, and C_{1} are centers of circles all passing through H, the segments HA_1, HB_1, and HC_1 are radii of the circles and consequently equal to R.    - Consider the cyclic nature and symmetry in circle formations: HA_1BC_1 forms a rhombus.

Find the angles formed by the edges of this trihedral angle with the planes of the opposite faces.","output":"1. **Understanding the Geometry:**    - Let (O) be the vertex of the given trihedral angle.    - We denote the edges of this angle as (OA, OB), and (OC).    - Since all face angles of the trihedral angle are (60^circ), each triangular face formed by these edges is equilateral. 2. **Marking Equal Lengths:**    - Choose points (A, B,) and (C) on the edges (OA, OB,) and (OC) respectively, such that (OA = OB = OC = a).    - Consequently, the triangles (OAB, OBC,) and (OCA) are all equilateral with side length (a).    - Hence, (AB = BC = CA = a). 3. **Forming a Pyramid:**    - The points (A, B,) and (C) form an equilateral triangle, and the pyramidal structure (OABC) is fully symmetric.    - Therefore, all faces of the pyramid are equilateral triangles. 4. **Projecting Orthogonally:**    - Consider the orthogonal projection of point (A) onto the plane (OBC), denoted as (M).    - The angle between the edge (OA) and the plane (OBC) is denoted by (angle AOM).    - In the equilateral triangle (OBC), (M) is the centroid (also the orthocenter) due to symmetry. 5. **Geometric Relationships:**    - In an equilateral triangle, the centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1.    - Therefore, the distance from (O) to (M) (height of the equilateral triangle) is (frac{asqrt{3}}{3}). 6. **Using Trigonometry:**    - In the right triangle (AOM):      [      OM = frac{asqrt{3}}{3}      ]    - Using the definition of cosine in the triangle:      [      cos angle AOM = frac{OM}{OA} = frac{frac{asqrt{3}}{3}}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}      ] 7. **Calculating the Angle:**    - Thus, the angle (angle AOM) is obtained from:      [      angle AOM = arccos frac{sqrt{3}}{3}      ] 8. **General Conclusion for All Edges:**    - By symmetry, the angles between each edge (OA, OB, OC) and the opposite face are the same.    - Therefore, the angles formed by the edges and the opposite planes are:      [      arccos frac{sqrt{3}}{3}      ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{arccos frac{sqrt{3}}{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"w many integers between 400 and 600 have the sum of their digits equal to 18?","output":"We have to consider 3 cases: 1. **Hundreds digit is 4**: The sum of the tens and unit digit needs to be 18 - 4 = 14.

For a product of numbers to be divisible by 10, it must include at least one instance of these prime factors. We can, therefore, break this problem down into cases based on these factors. There are 6^3 total ways to choose the numbers x, y, and z since each can be any integer from 1 to 6. Now we consider the cases where the product is not divisible by 10, which occur when the numbers 2, 4, 5, and 6 (the multiples of 2 and 5 within the range) are not included. Here are the different scenarios to consider: 1. Cases where 2, 4, or 6 are not chosen: These form the even numbers within our range, and we cannot form a multiple of 10 without an even number (since 2 is a prime factor of 10). There are 3 choices for each of x, y, and z without picking 2, 4, or 6, which gives us 3^3 cases. 2. Similarly, cases where 5 is not chosen: We can't form a multiple of 10 without the number 5 either. There are 5 choices for each of x, y, and z (excluding 5), leading to 5^3 possibilities. 3. Cases where none of the numbers 2, 4, 5, or 6 are chosen: This is more restrictive, and we only have two choices for each variable (either 1 or 3), giving us 2^3 cases. To avoid double-counting, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The number of ways that x, y, or z do not result in a product divisible by 10 is the sum of the individual cases (where 2, 4, or 6 and 5 are excluded) minus the overlap (where both sets are excluded).

Now we determine the values of ( f(n) ) over one period:    [    begin{aligned}       &f(0) = 1,        &f(1) = 0,        &f(2) = -f(0) = -1,        &f(3) = -f(1) = 0.    end{aligned}    ]    Hence, the function can be expressed as:    [    f(n) = begin{cases}     0, & text{if } n equiv 1 pmod{4} text{ or } n equiv 3 pmod{4},      1, & text{if } n equiv 0 pmod{4},      -1, & text{if } n equiv 2 pmod{4}.     end{cases}    ] 4. To calculate ( frac{f(1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + 2015^2)}{f(1^2) + f(2^2) + cdots + f(2015^2)} ):    We first sum the squares of the first 2015 integers:    [    sum_{k=1}^{2015} k^2    ]    Note that 2015 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 3. This implies the sum can be restructured in groups summing to multiples of 4 (since the periodic function assigns values modulo 4). 5. Recall the periodicity identified in ( f(n) ):    - ( f(k^2) ) evaluates to 1 or -1 or 0 depending on ( k^2 mod 4 ):      [      begin{array}{ll}      text{For } k = 2m: & f((2m)^2) = f(4m^2) = 1,       text{For } k = 2m+1: & f((2m+1)^2) = f(4m^2 + 4m + 1) = 0,       text{For } k = 2m+2: & f((2m+2)^2) = f(4m^2 + 8m + 4) = 1.      end{array}      ] 6. Summing up the non-zero part gives half counts up to even highest counts:    The total count ( sum = 1007 times (1 + (-1) + 1) = 1007 ).    Thus:    [    f left( sum_{k=1}^{2015} k^2 right) = f(some multiple of 4) = 1,    ]    meaning:    [    sum_{k=1}^{2015} f(k^2/count=1007 + Non-Zero )^2 = 1007,    ]    and the resulting value:    (      frac{1}{1007}.    ) Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{1007}} ]"},{"instruction":"the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n, and a_2=8, a_4=4, (1) Find the value of a_9; (2) Find the maximum value of S_n and indicate when the maximum value is reached.","output":"Solution: (1) Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence {a_n} be d, Since a_2=8 and a_4=4, We have begin{cases} a_1+d=8  a_1+3d=4 end{cases},   Thus begin{cases} a_1=10  d=-2 end{cases},   Therefore, a_9=a_1+8d=-6.

Recognize that a perfect square trinomial takes the form a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2. 2. In our case, a^2 = 4x^2 implies a = 2x (since a must be positive for a perfect square). 3. The term b^2 corresponds to 1, suggesting b = 1 (since b must be positive for a perfect square). 4. The middle term of our perfect square, 2ab, should equal the middle term of our given trinomial, (m-3)x. 5. Substituting a = 2x and b = 1 into 2ab, we get 2 cdot 2x cdot 1 = 4x. 6.

We are required to prove that the length of segment XY does not depend on the choice of point R. 1. **Proving R X O Y is a Cyclic Quadrilateral**:     - Since angle RXO + angle RYO = 65^circ + 115^circ = 180^circ, quadrilateral RXOY is a cyclic quadrilateral by the inscribed angle theorem. This theorem states that a quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of a pair of opposite angles is 180^circ.     2. **Determining Diagonal Relationships**:     - Since RXOY is a cyclic quadrilateral, it is possible to find the radius r_2 of the circumcircle of RXOY.     - The diagonal RO is equal to the radius r_1 of the original circle centered at O.     3. **Calculating Radius r_2**:     - The angle angle RXO of the inscribed angle is 65^circ, making the corresponding arc RO span 130^circ. The relation between the chord length and the radius of the circle in a cyclic quadrilateral is given by:       [       R = frac{r_1}{2 sin(angle RXO)}       ]     - For angle RXO = 65^circ:       [       r_2 = frac{r_1}{2 sin 65^circ}       ] 4. **Using Diagonal XY**:     - The angle angle XOY subtended by the arc XY is 60^circ since angle AOB = 60^circ and all these angles are central angles subtending the same arc between points A and B.     - The length of the chord XY can be found using the fact the diagonal XY spans an angle of 60^circ:       [       XY = 2 r_2 sin(60^circ)       ] 5. **Substituting the Radius r_2**:     - Substituting r_2 from earlier:       [       XY = 2 left(frac{r_1}{2 sin 65^circ}right) sin 60^circ = frac{r_1 sin 60^circ}{sin 65^circ}       ] 6. **Conclusion**:     - This length is entirely in terms of r_1 and constant trigonometric values, thus indicating that it does not depend on the position of point R.

For lattice points like ( (1,1) ) to lie on a diagonal, it occurs when ( frac{s}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}k ) where ( k ) is an integer. Solve for ( s = 2k sqrt{2} ).     Setting ( k ) to find the smallest ( s ) providing exactly five boundary points, we choose ( k = 2 ). This choice places at least one lattice point on each diagonal leg and counts those at horizontal and vertical extremities. 4. **Area Calculation**:    With ( k = 2 ), we find ( s = 4sqrt{2} ). The area of the square is then ( s^2 = (4sqrt{2})^2 = 32 ). Conclusion: The area of the smallest square, centered at a lattice point and rotated such that exactly five lattice points lie on its boundary, is (32).

After Ashton gives Jimmy 40 sheets, Jimmy will have J + 40 sheets. According to the problem, at that point, Jimmy will have 30 more sheets than Tommy. So we can write the equation: J + 40 = T + 30 Now we can substitute the value of J (which is 32) into the equation: 32 + 40 = T + 30 72 = T + 30 Now we can solve for T by subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation: 72 - 30 = T 42 = T So Tommy has 42 sheets initially.

The 12 soldiers are randomly divided into three groups, with group sizes of 3, 4, and 5 soldiers, respectively. What is the probability that each group has exactly 1 radio operator?","output":"1. Let's begin by calculating the total number of ways to divide the 12 soldiers into three groups with sizes 3, 4, and 5, respectively. To do this, we use the combination formula: [ binom{12}{3} binom{9}{4} binom{5}{5} ] - The first combination (binom{12}{3}) represents selecting 3 soldiers from 12. - The second combination (binom{9}{4}) represents selecting 4 soldiers from the remaining 9. - The last combination (binom{5}{5}) is 1 because there is only one way to choose the remaining 5 soldiers from 5. Thus, we can calculate this step by step: [ binom{12}{3} = frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = frac{12 times 11 times 10}{3 times 2 times 1} = 220 ] [ binom{9}{4} = frac{9!}{4!(9-4)!} = frac{9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 126 ] [ binom{5}{5} = 1 ] Multiplying these values together gives the total number of ways to divide the soldiers: [ 220 times 126 times 1 = 27720 ] 2. Next, we calculate the number of ways to ensure that each group includes exactly one reporter. There are 3 reporters out of the 12 soldiers. We need to place one reporter in each of the three groups. - We select the group of 3 first. We choose 1 reporter out of the 3 for this group, then select 2 non-reporters from the remaining 9 soldiers. The number of ways is: [ binom{3}{1} binom{9}{2} ] - Next, we choose the group of 4. We select 1 reporter from the remaining 2 reporters and 3 non-reporters from the now reduced 7 soldiers. The number of ways to do this is: [ binom{2}{1} binom{7}{3} ] - Lastly, the remaining group of 5 must contain the last reporter and the remaining 4 non-reporters. Hence, the number of ways is: [ binom{1}{1} binom{4}{4} ] - We also have to consider the permutations of assigning reporters to the groups. Therefore, multiply by the number of permutations of 3 reporters which is (3!): [ 3! ] Now we calculate these combinations: [ binom{3}{1} = 3 ] [ binom{9}{2} = frac{9 times 8}{2 times 1} = 36 ] [ binom{2}{1} = 2 ] [ binom{7}{3} = frac{7 times 6 times 5}{3 times 2 times 1} = 35 ] [ binom{1}{1} = 1 ] [ binom{4}{4} = 1 ] Also, the number of permutations of the 3 reporters is: [ 3! = 6 ] Putting it all together: [ binom{3}{1} binom{9}{2} times binom{2}{1} binom{7}{3} times binom{1}{1} binom{4}{4} times 3! = 3 times 36 times 2 times 35 times 1 times 1 times 6 ] [ = 3 times 36 times 2 times 35 times 6 = 7560 ] 3. Finally, the probability that each group has exactly one reporter is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the number of possible outcomes: [ frac{7560}{27720} = frac{3}{11} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{3}{11}} ]"},{"instruction":"the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, it is known that S_9=90.

Let (a = rb). 2. **Substitute into the equation**:    Substituting (a = rb) into the initial equation, we get:    [    frac{rb + b}{rb} + frac{rb}{rb + b} = b.    ]    Simplifying these fractions, we have:    [    frac{r+1}{r} + frac{r}{r+1} = b.    ] 3. **Check the conditions for solutions**:    It's important to note that (b = 0) is not possible, as it would lead to undefined expressions. Thus, excluding (r = 0) and (r = -1) avoids division by zero. For any rational number (r neq 0) and (r neq -1), we find:    [    b = frac{r+1}{r} + frac{r}{r+1}.    ]    This confirms that (b) is rational if (r) is rational.

Let ( B = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n} ) and ( C = {c_1, c_2, ldots, c_m} ), where ( n + m + 1 = p-1 ). 4. For each ( b_i in B ), consider the sum ( a + b_i pmod{p} ). Since ( a + b_i notequiv z pmod{p} ) for any ( z in C ), ( a + b_i ) must be in ( B ). 5. This implies that ( a + b_i equiv b_j pmod{p} ) for some ( b_j in B ). Since the ( b_i )'s are distinct, we have ( a + b_i equiv b_j pmod{p} ) for distinct ( b_i ) and ( b_j ). 6. Summing all such congruences, we get:    [    a + b_1 + a + b_2 + cdots + a + b_n equiv b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n pmod{p}    ]    [    na + b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n equiv b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n pmod{p}    ]    [    na equiv 0 pmod{p}    ] 7. Since ( p ) is a prime, ( na equiv 0 pmod{p} ) implies that either ( n equiv 0 pmod{p} ) or ( a equiv 0 pmod{p} ). However, ( a in P ) and ( a neq 0 ), and ( n < p ), so ( n neq 0 pmod{p} ). This is a contradiction. 8. Now consider the general case where ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) each have more than one element. For each ( a_i in A ), consider the sums ( a_i + b_j pmod{p} ) for ( b_j in B ). 9. If ( a_i + b_j notequiv z pmod{p} ) for any ( z in C ), then ( a_i + b_j ) must be in ( A ) or ( B ). If ( a_i + b_j in A ), we get a similar contradiction as in the special case. 10. If ( a_i + b_j in B ), then for each ( a_i in A ), there exists ( b_j in B ) such that ( a_i + b_j equiv b_k pmod{p} ) for some ( b_k in B ). Summing these congruences leads to a similar contradiction as before. 11. Therefore, our assumption that no such ( x, y, z ) exist must be false. Hence, there exist ( x in A ), ( y in B ), and ( z in C ) such that ( x + y equiv z pmod{p} ).

Therefore, the game must end in at most 1994^2 moves, as no square can be revisited. 3. **Consider the principle of strategy**:     - One of the players must have a winning strategy.

Notice that if we rotate the first board by 90^circ, the game on the second board with the switched roles will exactly mimic the original game in terms of the sequence and nature of moves. 5. **Simulate the moves on both boards**:     - On the first board, A makes an arbitrary first move from square x to square y.      - On the second board, A places the knight on square y and waits for B's reply on the first board.         - If B moves to square z on the first board, A copies this move on the second board as their own move.         - This means A will make exactly the same moves on the second board as Player B would by vertical-first then horizontal-second analogously. 6. **Move determination**:     - Both boards independently progress with each player copying the moves from one board to the other in a mirrored fashion.     - Since the knight moves (horizontal and vertical exchanges) mimic each other, each move on the second board corresponds to a valid step from the first board rotated 90^circ. 7. **Conclusion of the dual game strategy**:     - If Player B could force a win on the first board starting from any configuration when A moves first, B must be able to win as A on the rotated second board.     - However, because A is following the presumed perfect strategy of B, Player B's strategy on one board implies a contradictory outcome based on mirrored conditions. 8. **Result**:     - Thus, B cannot claim an irrefutable winning strategy on every turn and configuration.     - Therefore, A must have a winning strategy for them to rely on in such a game structure.

Since (A) and (B) are roots of the quadratic equation, their x-coordinates sum to give ( -frac{b}{a} ) (sum of the roots in a quadratic form). Thus, the center ( (h, k) ) of the circle is calculated as:    [    h = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = -frac{b}{2a}, quad k = 0    ]    Therefore, the center of the circle is ( left(-frac{b}{2a}, 0right) ). 5. **Radius of the Circle**:    The radius ( R ) of the circle is the distance from the center to any of the intersection points.

The perpendicular bisectors of the sides a and b, which form the angle gamma, intersect side c at points P and Q, respectively. We need to show that the angle angle PCQ = varphi is less than, equal to, or greater than 90^circ, depending on whether gamma is less than, equal to, or greater than 135^circ. 1. **Geometric Properties of Perpendicular Bisectors:**    The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is the locus of points that are equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. Therefore, the triangles QAC and PBC are isosceles with:    - angle A = angle ACQ = alpha    - angle B = angle PCB = beta    Here, alpha and beta are the base angles of these isosceles triangles. 2. **Sum of Interior Angles:**    Since gamma is an obtuse angle and given that the sum of interior angles in any triangle is 180^circ, we have:    [    alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ    ]    From the above, it follows:    [    alpha + beta = 180^circ - gamma    ] 3. **Comparison of Angles:**    Since gamma > 90^circ, it means:    [    180^circ - gamma < 90^circ    ]    Thus, alpha + beta < 90^circ. 4. **Angle Sum of Triangle PCQ:**    The perpendicular bisectors intersect externally to the triangle so angle PCQ can be expressed as the difference between gamma and the sum of alpha and beta. Therefore:    [    varphi = gamma - (alpha + beta)    ]    Substituting the earlier relationship alpha + beta = 180^circ - gamma, we get:    [    varphi = gamma - (180^circ - gamma) = 2gamma - 180^circ    ] 5. **Analyzing varphi:**    To determine the conditions under which varphi is less than, equal to, or greater than 90^circ, we analyze:    [    varphi leq 90^circ iff 2gamma - 180^circ leq 90^circ    ]    Solving this inequality:    [    2gamma - 180^circ leq 90^circ implies 2gamma leq 270^circ implies gamma leq 135^circ    ]    Hence, the angle varphi is determined based on gamma as:    [    varphi lesseqgtr 90^circ text{ as } gamma lesseqgtr 135^circ.    ]    # Conclusion:    Therefore, we have shown that:    [    varphi = angle PCQ lesseqgtr 90^circ quad text{as } gamma leqq 135^circ.    ]    Thus, the problem statement is proved.    blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A nonequilateral triangle has an inscribed circle, with the points of tangency taken as the vertices of a second triangle.

The angles of the contact triangle are given by the expressions:    [    frac{beta + gamma}{2}, quad frac{alpha + gamma}{2}, quad text{and} quad frac{alpha + beta}{2}    ]    These angles are ordered such that:    [    frac{beta + gamma}{2} geq frac{alpha + gamma}{2} geq frac{alpha + beta}{2}    ] 3. For the second triangle in the sequence, notice that the differences between the largest and smallest angles reduce by half due to the properties of the angle bisectors. Specifically,    [    text{Difference} = frac{gamma - alpha}{2}    ] 4.

To conclude that no two triangles in this sequence are similar, observe that for similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding angles must be identical.

If -1 < b < 2, then f(x) first decreases and then increases on the interval [-1, 2]. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is attained at x = b, so we have f(b) = b^2 - 2b^2 + 3 = 1. Solving for b, we have -b^2 + 3 = 1, which implies b^2 = 2. Hence, b = sqrt{2} or b = -sqrt{2}. We discard b = -sqrt{2} since it does not lie in the prescribed range for b. Combining all cases, we find two possible values of b: b = -frac{3}{2} and b = sqrt{2}.

Therefore, the cost price of Wei Long spicy strips, being twice that of regular spicy strips, is 2x yuan.

He collects 3 gold coins from each druid, then gives one gold coin to each person in any pair willing to shake hands. Show that the chief can keep at least 3 gold coins in his pocket at the end of the action.","output":":  We can model the situation with a graph G where each vertex represents a druid, and there is an edge between two vertices if the corresponding druids are willing to shake hands. The graph G does not contain any cycle of length 4 or more. Let n be the number of vertices, and e be the number of edges in this graph. We want to show that: [ 3n - 2e geq 3 ] **Step-by-Step Explanation:** 1. **Assume the graph is connected:**        If G is connected, we can express the number of edges e as:    [    e = n - 1 + u    ]    where u geq 0 is some non-negative integer. 2. **Transform the inequality:**        Substitute e = n - 1 + u into the inequality 3n - 2e geq 3:    [    3n - 2(n - 1 + u) geq 3    ]    Simplify the above expression:    [    3n - 2n + 2 - 2u geq 3    ]    [    n - 2u + 2 geq 3    ]    Which simplifies to:    [    n - 1 geq 2u    ]        Thus, we need to show that the number of blue edges (in the spanning tree) is at least twice the number of green edges (that are part of some cycle). 3. **Color the edges:**        Consider a spanning tree of G. Color the edges of the spanning tree blue, and the remaining edges green. In this configuration, every green edge must complete a triangle with two blue edges, as green edges are not part of the tree and their endpoints are connected through a path in the tree. 4. **Analyze the structure:**        Each green edge together with the blue edges from the spanning tree must form exactly one triangle. This argument is valid because there are no cycles of length greater than 3 in the graph:    - If a green edge forms part of a longer cycle, it contradicts the premise that our graph contains no cycles of length 4 or more.     5. **Count the triangles:**        Each green edge forms a triangle with exactly two blue edges. Since each blue edge can be part of at most one such triangle (because there are no cycles of length 4 or more), the number of blue edges must be at least twice the number of green edges. 6. **Conclude for connected graphs:**        This directly implies that:    [    n - 1 geq 2u    ]    which means:    [    3n - 2e geq 3    ]    for connected graphs. **Conclusion for non-connected graph:** If G is not connected, it can be represented as a union of connected components. Apply the same analysis to each component. For each component, we have: [ 3n_i - 2e_i geq 3 ] where n_i and e_i are the number of vertices and edges in the i-th component, respectively.

Therefore, statement A is correct. - **Statement B**: For x > 0, we examine how y changes as x increases. Since y=frac{2}{x}, if x increases, y actually decreases because the value of frac{2}{x} becomes smaller as x becomes larger. Thus, the statement that y increases as x increases is incorrect.  - **Statement C**: The function y=frac{2}{x}, with k=2 > 0, implies that the graph will have branches in the first and third quadrants.

Let ( A ) have coordinates ( (4 cos alpha, 4 sin alpha) ) and ( B ) be the point ((4, 0)). 4. **Construct the perpendicular from ( T ) to ( AB ):**    The line ( AB ) has the equation:    [    y = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha - 1}(x - 4)    ]    The line ( TS ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) and passes through ( T(3, 0) ).

Suresh's work rate is 1 job per 15 hours, so per hour he completes ( frac{1}{15} ) of the job. Ashutosh's work rate is 1 job per 20 hours, so per hour he completes ( frac{1}{20} ) of the job. Priya's work rate is 1 job per 25 hours, so per hour she completes ( frac{1}{25} ) of the job. Suresh works for 6 hours, so he completes ( 6 times frac{1}{15} = frac{6}{15} = frac{2}{5} ) of the job.

So, the sum of the digits in the thousands place is 1 * 1000 = 1000. Next, let's consider the digits in the hundreds, tens, and ones places for the numbers 1000 to 1999. Each digit from 0 to 9 will appear an equal number of times in each place. Since there are 1000 numbers and 10 possible digits, each digit will appear 1000/10 = 100 times in each place. The sum of the digits from 0 to 9 is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45. Since each digit appears 100 times in each of the three places (hundreds, tens, and ones), the sum for each place is 45 * 100 = 4500.

We arrange that:      - One of these safes will contain (k) diamonds.      - The second will contain (N-k) diamonds (where (0 leq k leq N)).    - Given diamonds in safes need to have different counts, we construe (k) and (N-k) such that they are unique for all (0 leq k leq N) combinations. 5. **Distribution Mechanism**:    - Consider each of the 777 bankers.    - For a banker with two safes:      - Safe 1: Contains (d) diamonds where (d) is a unique number for this banker.      - Safe 2: Contains (N-d) diamonds. 6. **Concluding that all Diamonds can be Distributed**:    - Since (d) ranges from (0) to (N-1), and no two safes can hold the same count within the same banker, starting one safe at (d) and the other at (N-d) ensures all unique configurations are covered for each banker.    - This distribution remains valid because there are (N) choices for numbers to distribute diamonds into two safes without repetition.    - Thus, each banker can retain only two safes and still satisfy the oligarh's requirement: distributing (N) diamonds uniquely. # Conclusion: Since each banker can effectively distribute (N) diamonds into exactly two safes as detailed, leaving all bankers capable of fulfilling the given distribution problem, the solution holds for each having at least two safes.

Recognize that the third quadrant is characterized by both x and y being negative, hence the notation left(-,-right). 2. Given the distance from point P to the x-axis is 2, this distance represents the absolute value of the y-coordinate, thus |y| = 2.

We will consider the elements of ( X ) as residues modulo 37. All elements must be nonzero and distinct. 2. **Using Roots of Unity:**    - Let ( omega ) be a primitive 37th root of unity.

For each term ( x^m ) in the polynomial, replace it with ( x^{m mod 37} ). This polynomial has degree less than 37 but is divisible by ( x^{37} - 1 ).

The reaction between NH4I (ammonium iodide) and KOH (potassium hydroxide) can be represented as follows: NH4I + KOH → NH3 + KI + H2O Now, let's balance the equation: NH4I + KOH → NH3 + KI + H2O The equation is already balanced with a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. This means that 1 mole of NH4I reacts with 1 mole of KOH to produce 1 mole of NH3, 1 mole of KI, and 1 mole of H2O. According to the problem, we have 3 moles of KOH. Since the reaction is a 1:1 ratio, we will also need 3 moles of NH4I to react with the 3 moles of KOH. Now, let's calculate the moles of NH3 formed. Since the ratio of NH4I to NH3 is 1:1, the moles of NH3 formed will be equal to the moles of NH4I reacted. Therefore, if 3 moles of NH4I are required, then 3 moles of NH3 will be formed. The problem states that the total amount of NH4I required is 435. However, this information seems incomplete because we need to know the units associated with the number 435 to make sense of it.

If the function f(x) satisfies the condition f^{2}(x)-f^{2}(y)=f(x+y)cdot f(x-y) and is increasing on its domain, the given statement would be false. Only propositions 2 and 3 are correct.

Let (x_k) be the integer represented by the first (k) digits of the sequence, i.e.,     [    x_k^2 = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i+1} cdot 10^i.    ]    For large (k), consider the difference between consecutive terms:    [    (x_k - x_{k-1})(x_k + x_{k-1}) = a_k cdot 10^{k-1}.    ] 3. **Analyzing the Parity and Divisibility:**    If (a_1 neq 5), then (5) does not divide both (x_k - x_{k-1}) and (x_k + x_{k-1}).

Thus,    [    x_k = frac{(x_k - x_{k-1}) + (x_k + x_{k-1})}{2} geq frac{2 cdot 5^{k-1} + 1}{2} = 5^{k-1} + 1.    ]    Consequently,    [    10^k > x_k^2 > 5^{2k-2}.    ]    This inequality implies    [    left(frac{10}{25}right)^k > frac{1}{25},    ]    which is clearly false for sufficiently large (k). 5. **Contradiction and Conclusion:**    The contradiction implies that our initial assumption is false. Therefore, no such sequence of nonzero digits (a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots) and positive integer (N) exists such that for every (k > N), the number (overline{a_k a_{k-1} cdots a_1}) is a perfect square.

First, let's convert the dimensions of the courtyard from meters to centimeters, since the dimension of the brick is given in centimeters. Courtyard length = 18 meters = 1800 cm Courtyard breadth = 12 meters = 1200 cm Now, let's calculate the total area of the courtyard in square centimeters: Total area = Courtyard length × Courtyard breadth Total area = 1800 cm × 1200 cm Total area = 2160000 cm² Next, we'll divide the total area by the number of bricks to find the area of one brick: Area of one brick = Total area / Number of bricks Area of one brick = 2160000 cm² / 11076.923076923076 To simplify the calculation, let's round the number of bricks to the nearest whole number, which is 11077. Area of one brick = 2160000 cm² / 11077 Area of one brick ≈ 194.999 cm² (approximately 195 cm²) Now, we know that one of the dimensions of the brick is 13 cm, so we can find the other dimension by dividing the area of one brick by this known dimension: Other dimension = Area of one brick / Known dimension Other dimension = 195 cm² / 13 cm Other dimension = 15 cm Therefore, the other dimension of the brick is approximately boxed{15}  cm."},{"instruction":"The numbers (1, 2, ldots, 50) are written on a blackboard.

This means this product does not change regardless of how we perform the operation. 3. **Verify the Invariance**:    - Consider two numbers (a) and (b) being replaced by (a + b + 2ab).    - Transform the numbers (a) and (b) as follows:       [      (2a + 1) quad text{and} quad (2b + 1)      ]    - After the operation, the new number on the board is:       [      a + b + 2ab       ]    - Observe the transformation of the combined term:      [      1 + 2(a + b + 2ab) = 1 + 2a + 2b + 4ab      ]    - Note that:      [      (1 + 2a)(1 + 2b) = 1 + 2a + 2b + 4ab      ]    - Hence, we conclude:      [      1 + 2(a + b + 2ab) = (1 + 2a)(1 + 2b)      ]    - This shows that the product ((2x_1 + 1)(2x_2 + 1) cdots (2x_k + 1)) remains unchanged after the transformation. 4. **Compute the Initial Product**:    - Initially, the numbers on the blackboard are (1, 2, ldots, 50).    - Compute the initial invariant product with these numbers:      [      (2 cdot 1 + 1)(2 cdot 2 + 1) cdots (2 cdot 50 + 1)      ]      [      3 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdots 101      ]      - This is the product of all the odd numbers from 3 to 101. 5. **Final Number on the Board**:    - After continuous application of the operation, only one number (M) remains on the board.    - The invariant value when only one number (M) is left on the board is:      [      2M + 1      ]    - Hence, we must have:      [      2M + 1 = 3 cdot 5 cdots 101      ] 6. **Conclusion**:    - The final number (M) is precisely determined by the invariant:      [      M = frac{3 cdot 5 cdots 101 - 1}{2}      ]    - This shows that the final number does not depend on the order of operations.

Since the students who passed in both subjects is 20%, the percentage of students who failed in at least one subject is 100% - 20% = 80%. Now, we know that the students who failed in both subjects are counted in both the Hindi and English failure percentages. To avoid double-counting, we subtract the percentage of students who failed in both from the Hindi and English failure percentages.

Therefore, these vectors satisfy the following relation:    [    frac{mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{4} = mathbf{s} = mathbf{0} quad text{which implies} quad mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1 = mathbf{0}    ] 2. **Computing ( mathbf{a}_2 ):**    From the definition, point ( A_{n+1} ) is the centroid of the triangle ( B_n C_n D_n ). Hence,     [    mathbf{a}_2 = frac{mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{3}    ]        Using the fact that ( mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1 = 0 ), we can write:    [    mathbf{a}_2 = frac{mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{3} = frac{-mathbf{a}_1}{3} = -frac{1}{3} mathbf{a}_1    ] 3. **Similar Computation for Other Points:**    Similarly, we define ( mathbf{b}_2, mathbf{c}_2, mathbf{d}_2 ) as follows:    [    mathbf{b}_2 = frac{mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{3} = -frac{1}{3} mathbf{b}_1, quad mathbf{c}_2 = frac{mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{3} = -frac{1}{3} mathbf{c}_1, quad mathbf{d}_2 = frac{mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1}{3} = -frac{1}{3} mathbf{d}_1    ] 4. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    Let's assume for some ( n in mathbb{N} ), the hypothesis holds as:    [    mathbf{a}_n = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{a}_1, quad mathbf{b}_n = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{b}_1, quad mathbf{c}_n = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{c}_1, quad mathbf{d}_n = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{d}_1    ] 5. **Induction Step:**    We now prove it for ( n+1 ). Using the definition again, we get:    [    mathbf{a}_{n+1} = frac{mathbf{b}_n + mathbf{c}_n + mathbf{d}_n}{3}    ]    Substituting the inductive hypothesis, we get:    [    mathbf{a}_{n+1} = frac{1}{3} left( left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{b}_1 + left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{c}_1 + left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{d}_1 right)    ]    Simplifying further,    [    mathbf{a}_{n+1} = frac{1}{3} left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} left( mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1 right)    ]    Using ( mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1 = 0 ):    [    mathbf{a}_{n+1} = frac{1}{3} left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} (-mathbf{a}_1) = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n} mathbf{a}_1    ] 6. **Extension to Other Points:**    Analogously, we can show:    [    mathbf{b}_{n+1} = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n} mathbf{b}_1, quad mathbf{c}_{n+1} = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n} mathbf{c}_1, quad mathbf{d}_{n+1} = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n} mathbf{d}_1    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    The lengths of vectors ( mathbf{a}_n, mathbf{b}_n, mathbf{c}_n, mathbf{d}_n ) decrease exponentially, specifically as ( left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n-1} ). Therefore, after a finite number of steps, all points ( A_n ) will eventually lie within the unit circle centered at ( S ). Thus, only a finite number of points from the sequence ( A_n ) can lie outside the circle.

Each edge can be directed in 2 ways (either from vertex ( u ) to vertex ( v ) or from vertex ( v ) to vertex ( u )). 2. **Total Number of Possible Directed Graphs**:    Since each of the ( binom{n}{2} ) edges can be directed in 2 ways, the total number of possible directed graphs is ( 2^{binom{n}{2}} ). 3. **Number of Directed Triangles**:    A directed triangle is a set of three vertices ( {u, v, w} ) such that the edges between them form a cycle (e.g., ( u to v to w to u )).

For example, iterating to values like ( (1, 1, 2, 4) ), ( (1, 2, 4, 13) ), ( (2, 4, 13, 85) ), etc., show an increase in the smallest values when transformation applied correctly.

Total edge count:    (6 times 5 = 30). 6. **Identifying Shapes of New Faces:**    - The six longest (a-edge) faces now form symmetrical hexagons (parallel sides as symmetrically aligned trapezoids from adjacent gables combine).    - The shortest (c-edge) faces combine similarly to make rhombuses.    - The faces (b-edge) following trapezoidal and triangular merge into symmetrical pentagons.    Hence, we obtain four of each type: hexagons, rhombus, and pentagon, all congruent. 7. **Volume Calculation:**    - For a roof on an (a)- and (b)-edged face, it's helpful to calculate geometrically considering contributions from pyramidal and prismatic segments created by inclines.    - Volume of one such constructed roof around an edge combination results as:    [    V_{ab} = frac{b^3}{6} + frac{b^2(a - b)}{4} = frac{ab^2}{4} - frac{b^3}{12}    ]    Similarly, applying transformations for edges:    [    V_{ac} quad text{and} quad V_{bc}    ]    give the volumes respectively. 8. **Summing Up Contributions:**    The overall combined volume for the modified cuboid plus gabled roofs:    [    V = abc + 2 left( V_{ab} + V_{ac} + V_{bc} right) = abc + frac{1}{2} left( ab^2 + ac^2 + bc^2 right) - frac{b^3}{6} - frac{c^3}{3}    ]        Hence:    [    boxed{a b c + frac{1}{2} (a b^2 + a c^2 + b c^2) - frac{b^3}{6} - frac{c^3}{3}}    ] This fully detailed computation and combining various calculation steps conclude the new geometry's vertex count, edge configurations, face formations, and overall volumetric analysis after the introduction of inclined gables."},{"instruction":"Nitrogen is an extremely abundant element on Earth.

The given distance function is the Manhattan distance:    [    d(A, B) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|    ]    We can rotate the plane by 45 degrees and change the coordinates ( P = (x, y) rightarrow P' = (x - y, x + y) ). Under this transformation, the Manhattan distance becomes:    [    d'(P', Q') = max { |P'_x - Q'_x|, |P'_y - Q'_y| }    ]    This transformation does not change the structure of the problem but simplifies the distance function. 2. **Claiming the Maximum Number of Harmonic Pairs:**    We claim that the maximum number of harmonic pairs among 100 points is:    [    frac{3 times 100^2}{4 times 2} = 3750    ]    To see that this bound is achievable, we can place 25 points each in a small neighborhood of the four points ((pm frac{1.0201082102011209}{2}, pm frac{1.0201082102011209}{2})). 3. **Graph Representation:**    Create a graph ( G ) with 100 vertices, where two vertices are joined by an edge if the corresponding points are harmonic. We need to show that ( G ) has no ( K_5 ) (complete graph on 5 vertices). 4. **Proof by Contradiction:**    - **Step 1:** Color the edges of ( G ) as follows: color the edge ( PQ ) red if ( max { |P_x - Q_x|, |P_y - Q_y| } = |P_x - Q_x| ), and blue otherwise.    - **Step 2:** Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is a ( K_5 ) in ( G ) with points ( A, B, C, D, E ).    - **Step 3:** By the properties of edge coloring in ( K_5 ), if there is no monochromatic triangle, there must be a monochromatic cycle of length 5.    - **Step 4:** Assume the cycle is red and let it be ( A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow D rightarrow E rightarrow A ). 5. **Bounding the Coordinates:**    - Note that ( max(A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y, E_y) - min(A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y, E_y) leq 2 ) because otherwise, the extreme points would not be harmonic.    - Assume ( min(A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y, E_y) = A_y = 0 ), so ( max(A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y, E_y) leq 2 ).    - Thus, ( A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y, E_y in [0, 2] ). 6. **Coloring the Vertices:**    - Color the vertices with ordinates in the interval ([0, 1]) black and those in the interval ((1, 2]) white.    - By traversing the cycle ( A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow D rightarrow E rightarrow A ), we change the color of the interval each time, implying the odd cycle is bipartite, which is a contradiction. 7. **Applying Turan's Theorem:**    By Turan's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a graph with no ( K_5 ) is:    [    frac{3n^2}{4}    ]    For ( n = 100 ), this gives:    [    frac{3 times 100^2}{4} = 7500    ]    Since each harmonic pair is counted twice, the maximum number of harmonic pairs is:    [    frac{7500}{2} = 3750    ] The final answer is (boxed{3750})"},{"instruction":"Trapezoid EFGH has base EF = 24 units and base GH = 36 units.

Given the information and the standard solution provided, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in directly equating CD with AD or DB. Without additional geometric properties or theorems applied, such as those concerning the properties of median lines in triangles or specific right triangle median properties, we cannot directly conclude CD = 2.5 based on the given solution steps. To correct and adhere to the format and rules: If the intention was to find the length of the median CD in a right triangle where such a median connects the right angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse, then by a specific property of right triangles, the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse. Thus, in this corrected understanding: [ CD = frac{1}{2}AB = frac{1}{2} times 5 = 2.5. ] Therefore, the corrected step-by-step solution, adhering to the rules and format, and assuming the application of the right triangle median property, concludes with: [ boxed{2.5} ]"},{"instruction":"Luke had 20 stickers.

Specifically, there are (binom{2014}{n}) subsets of (S) with exactly (n) elements. Therefore, we can rewrite the sum as:    [    sum_{T subseteq S} i^{|T|} = sum_{n=0}^{2014} binom{2014}{n} i^n    ] 3.

Also, construct a perpendicular to ( AB ) at point ( O ), let this be line ( l_O ). 3. Since ( A ) and ( B ) are the furthest vertices from ( O ), both ( l_A ) and ( l_B ) are supporting lines of the polygon (i.e., the polygon lies entirely on one side of each of these lines). 4. Let ( C ) and ( D ) be the points where the boundary of the polygon intersects line ( l_O ). Through points ( C ) and ( D ), construct parallel supporting lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ), respectively. 5.

Given the angular velocities, we can set up an equation to find the first meeting time, x. - For A to catch up with B, A's angular displacement (3x radians) plus B's initial angle (frac{pi}{3}) must equal B's angular displacement (x radians).

Since B moves slower, we let y be the time for a new meeting after the first, including the initial phase difference. - For the second meeting, taking into account a full cycle for B (2pi), we have: y + 2pi = 3y  Solving for y gives: 2pi = 2y Rightarrow y = pi At this time, A, moving at 3 times the angular velocity of B, would have completed 3pi radians, landing at (0,-1). 3. **Assessing the Third Meeting Time**: Interestingly, the third \\"meeting\\" time is mistakenly calculated with the same condition as the second meeting.

Given the cyclic nature of the motion, the actual conditions for each subsequent meeting would iterate through the same positions due to the periodicity of the circle.

The total number of players is:  [ n = i + g = i + 10i = 11i ] The total number of games played, given each player played against every other player exactly once, is given by the combination formula: [ frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] This also represents the total number of points distributed, which is ( 5.5I ) since ( I + G = 5.5I ): We equate the total games to the total points: [ frac{11i(11i-1)}{2} = 5.5I ] Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction, we get: [ 11i(11i-1) = 11I ] Dividing both sides by 11 gives: [ i(11i-1) = I ] So we have: [ I = i(11i - 1) ] This equation suggests that each MI appears to have scored the maximum possible points, which is not feasible because MI's will play against each other, and thus their points cannot reach the maximum possible without losses or draws. Therefore, this only holds if ( i = 1 ), meaning there is only one MI. Therefore, the number of MI's is: [ boxed{1} ]  b) Determining the number of Grandmasters (GM's) Given from the problem and from our previous calculation: [ g = 10i ] Substituting ( i = 1 ): [ g = 10 cdot 1 = 10 ] Hence, the number of GM's is: [ boxed{10} ]  c) Determining the number of games in the tournament The total number of players in the tournament is: [ n = i + g = 1 + 10 = 11 ] The total number of games played is given by: [ frac{n(n-1)}{2} = frac{11 cdot (11 - 1)}{2} = frac{11 cdot 10}{2} = 55 ] Thus, the total number of games in the tournament is: [ boxed{55} ]"},{"instruction":"Choose the largest of the following sums, and express it as a fraction in simplest form: frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4},   frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{5},   frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{2},   frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{9},   frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6}","output":"We first recognize that frac{1}{3} is a common fraction in each of the five sums, and so the relative size of the sums depends only on the other fractions.

We are asked to show that the product of ( n^2 ) and ( n^2-1 ) is always divisible by 12. First, we can rewrite the expression ( n^2(n^2-1) ) as follows: [ n^2(n^2-1) = n^2 cdot (n^2 - 1) = n^2 cdot (n^2 - 1) = n^2 cdot left((n-1)n(n+1)right) ] This expansion relies on the identity ( (n-1)n(n+1) ), representing three consecutive integers. # Step 1: Divisibility by 3 Among any three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3.  - If ( n equiv 0  (text{mod} 3) ), then ( n ) is divisible by 3. - If ( n equiv 1  (text{mod} 3) ), then ( n-1 ) is divisible by 3. - If ( n equiv 2  (text{mod} 3) ), then ( n+1 ) is divisible by 3. Thus, one of ( (n-1) ), ( n ), or ( (n+1) ) is always divisible by 3. # Step 2: Divisibility by 4 We need to show that the product is also divisible by 4. We can notice that among any three consecutive integers, at least one will be divisible by 2, and among these at least two will be even numbers ensuring a factor of 4. - If ( n ) is even, ( n ) contains at least one factor of 2. - Regardless whether ( n ) is even or odd:     - If ( n ) is even, ( n ) and at least one of ( n-1 ) or ( n+1 ) is even, ensuring two factors of 2 (hence 4).     - If ( n ) is odd, ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are both even.  Thus, there are always at least two even numbers within ( (n-1) ), ( n ), or ( (n+1) ), ensuring the product ( (n-1)n(n+1) ) has at least one factor of 4. # Step 3: Conclusion Since the product ( n^2 cdot (n-1)n(n+1) ) is divisible both by 3 and 4, it must be divisible by ( 3 times 4 = 12 ).

Consider the logarithmic functions log_a(1-x) and log_a(1+x) where 0 < x < 1 and a > 0, a neq 1.     2. Let's compare the absolute values of these logarithmic expressions. Specifically, we want to determine if:    [    left|log_a(1-x)right| > left|log_a(1+x)right|    ] 3. We start by analyzing the behavior of the functions (1-x) and (1+x) in relation to the logarithmic base a. 4. Because 0 < x < 1, we know that 0 < 1-x < 1 and 1 < 1+x < 2. 5. Let's first consider the case where 0 < a < 1. For bases between 0 and 1, the logarithmic function log_a(y) is a decreasing function. Therefore:    [    log_a(1-x) > log_a(1+x)    ]    Since the logarithm is decreasing in this interval. 6. Taking the absolute values, note that:    [    left|log_a(1-x)right| > left|log_a(1+x)right|    ]    because the logarithmic output for (1-x) would be negative (since 0 < 1-x < 1) and for (1+x) it will be negative as well since a < 1 and we are in the decreasing function's domain. 7. Now let's consider the case where a > 1. In this instance, the logarithmic function log_a(y) is an increasing function for y > 0. For 0 < x < 1:    [    log_a(1-x) < log_a(1+x)    ]    but both log_a(1-x) and log_a(1+x) are negative, essentially flipping the inequality when absolute values are considered. 8. Thus, for a > 1, we have:    [    left|log_a(1-x)right| > left|log_a(1+x)right|    ] 9. Concluding both cases, irrespective of whether 0 < a < 1 or a > 1, the desired inequality holds true.

First, note that: [ 476 equiv 2 pmod{3} ]    Since a has four prime factors denoted as p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, and assuming 3 does not divide any of these primes, we have: [ p_i^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ]    for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

Since alpha = A + B, beta = C + A, gamma = C + B, we have A + B < 90^circ, B + C < 90^circ, C + A < 90^circ.    Therefore, 2(A + B + C) < 270^circ, which implies A + B + C < 135^circ.

This makes angle B = 30^circ. 2. **Bisection and Folding:**    Draw the bisector AD of angle A which intersects BC at point D. Since angle A = 60^circ, bisector AD splits it into two 30^circ angles: angle BAD = 30^circ and angle CAD = 30^circ. This makes triangle ACD an isosceles triangle with AD = CD, and angle CDA = angle CAD = 30^circ. 3. **Perpendicular Line:**    Draw perpendicular DE from D to BC. Here DE parallel AC since both are perpendicular to BC. 4. **Cutting and Reflecting:**    Now fold the triangle along the line DE. When folded along DE, point A will move to position A', symmetric to A with respect to DE. Perform a straight cut along line DA'. 5. **Exploring Triangle Formations:**    Unfolding the cut triangle, we will see three resulting triangles: ACD, AFD, and BFD, where F is the intersection point of lines DA' and AB. 6. **Equivalence of Triangles:**    To prove the three triangles (ACD, AFD, BFD) are equal, we need to show their angles and sides are equivalent. Note that:     - ACD and AFD both have angle CAD = angle DAF = 30^circ,    - AFD and BFD both have common side DF and angle AFD = angle BFD = 60^circ. 7. **Right Angle Verification:**    Additionally, to ensure that the triangles formed are indeed right-angled:    Since DE parallel AC,  angle DEF = angle CAB = 60^circ. Therefore, angle FDA = 90^circ confirming  angle AFD = 90^circ is satisfied.

If 64 non-hot peppers represent 80% of the total peppers, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of peppers: 80% * Total Peppers = 64 Non-Hot Peppers To find the Total Peppers, we divide the number of non-hot peppers by 80% (or 0.80 in decimal form): Total Peppers = 64 / 0.80 Total Peppers = 80 Now that we know Joel picked a total of 80 peppers, we can find out how many peppers he picked each day by dividing the total number of peppers by the number of days in a week (7 days): Peppers per Day = Total Peppers / 7 Peppers per Day = 80 / 7 Since we can't pick a fraction of a pepper, we'll round to the nearest whole number. When we divide 80 by 7, we get approximately 11.43. Since Joel can't pick 0.43 of a pepper, we'll round down to 11 peppers per day.

Sachin joined after 10 months with Rs. 40,000 and stayed for 2 months. Now, let's calculate the investment-months for each partner: Rajan = Rs. 20,000 * 12 months = Rs. 240,000 Rakesh = Rs. 25,000 * 4 months = Rs. 100,000 Mahesh = Rs. 30,000 * 10 months = Rs. 300,000 Suresh = Rs. 35,000 * 12 months = Rs. 420,000 Mukesh = Rs. 15,000 * 8 months = Rs. 120,000 Sachin = Rs. 40,000 * 2 months = Rs. 80,000 The total investment-months for all partners is: Total = Rs. 240,000 + Rs. 100,000 + Rs. 300,000 + Rs. 420,000 + Rs. 120,000 + Rs. 80,000 Total = Rs. 1,260,000 Now, we calculate the share of each partner in the profit based on their investment-months. Rajan's share will be his investment-months divided by the total investment-months, multiplied by the total profit.

Let T be the point of intersection of lines BF and CE. Prove that points A, D, and T are collinear.","output":"To prove that points ( A, D ), and ( T ) lie on the same straight line, we will use projective geometry to transform the configuration in a way that simplifies the problem. 1. **Applying Projective Transformation**:    Let ( A', B', ldots ) be the images of the points ( A, B, ldots ) under a projective transformation that maps the excircle of triangle ( ABC ) to a circle. This transformation transforms the chord ( EF ) into a diameter of the circle. Under this transformation, ( A' ) becomes a point at infinity on the line perpendicular to the diameter ( E'F' ). 2. **Identifying ( A' )**:    Since ( E'F' ) is now a diameter, the point ( A' ) is an infinitely distant point on the line perpendicular to this diameter. This means that ( A' ) corresponds to the direction perpendicular to ( E'F' ). 3. **Establishing the Perpendicularity**:    We need to demonstrate that the line ( D'T' ) contains this infinitely distant point, implying ( D'T' ) is also perpendicular to ( E'F' ). 4. **Similar Triangles**:    By the properties of projective transformations and similar triangles:    [    Delta T'B'E' sim Delta T'F'C'    ]    This similarity relation gives:    [    frac{C'T'}{T'E'} = frac{C'F'}{B'E'}    ] 5. **Tangency Condition**:    From the tangency of ( C' ) and ( B' ) to the excircle at ( D' ):    [    C'D' = C'F' quad text{and} quad B'D' = B'E'    ] 6. **Proportionality**:    Substituting the tangents into the similarity condition:    [    frac{C'T'}{T'E'} = frac{C'D'}{D'B'}    ] 7. **Collinearity**:    This implies:    [    D'T' parallel B'E'    ]    Since ( A' ) is an infinitely distant point perpendicular to ( E'F' ), and since the projection maps lines perpendicular to ( E'F' ), this shows that ( D'T' ) must be perpendicular to ( E'F' ) as well. 8. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the points ( A, D ), and ( T ) must lie on the same line: the one reflecting the direction perpendicular to ( E'F' ) in the transformed space. This proves the original configuration without loss of generality under projective transformation. [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"Twelve balls are numbered by the numbers  1,2,3,cdots,12 .

According to condition (i), if ball 1 and ball ( a ) are red, then ball ( 1 + a ) must also be red. This implies that all balls numbered ( 1 + a, 1 + a + 1, 1 + a + 2, ldots ) must also be red. 3. **Consider the implications of condition (i).** If ball 1 is red and ball ( a ) is red, then all balls numbered ( 1 + a, 1 + a + 1, 1 + a + 2, ldots ) must be red. This means that if ball 1 and any other ball ( a ) are red, then all balls from 1 to 12 must be red. 4. **Consider the case where ball 1 is red and no other ball is red.** This is a valid coloring since it does not violate any of the conditions. 5. **Consider the case where ball 1 is red and ball 2 is green.** If ball 2 is green, then according to condition (ii), if any other ball ( b ) is green, then ball ( b + 2 ) must also be green. This implies that all balls numbered ( 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ) must be green. 6. **List all possible valid colorings:**    - All balls are red.    - All balls are red except ball 2.    - Only ball 1 is red, and all other balls are green. 7. **Multiply by 2 to account for the symmetry of exchanging red with green.** Each of the above cases can be mirrored by exchanging red with green, resulting in the same number of valid colorings. 8. **Calculate the total number of valid colorings.** There are 3 valid colorings when ball 1 is red. Multiplying by 2 for the symmetry, we get ( 3 times 2 = 6 ) valid colorings.

The remaining 20% of the way, John traveled by car. So the distance he traveled by car is 0.2D miles. We don't know the speed v, so the time he spent in the car is (0.2D) / v hours. The average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. We know the average speed is 50 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation: [ frac{D}{text{Total Time}} = 50 ] The total time is the sum of the time on the train and the time in the car: [ text{Total Time} = frac{0.8D}{80} + frac{0.2D}{v} ] Substituting the total time into the average speed equation, we get: [ frac{D}{frac{0.8D}{80} + frac{0.2D}{v}} = 50 ] We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator: [ D = 50 left( frac{0.8D}{80} + frac{0.2D}{v} right) ] [ D = 50 left( frac{0.8D}{80} right) + 50 left( frac{0.2D}{v} right) ] [ D = 0.5D + frac{10D}{v} ] Now we can solve for v: [ 0.5D = frac{10D}{v} ] [ v = frac{10D}{0.5D} ] [ v = 20 ] So, John's speed by car (v) is boxed{20}  miles per hour."},{"instruction":"As shown in Figure 5, convex quadrilateral ABCD has diagonals AC and BD, intersecting at point P.

The sequence will have 15 terms, and the sum of these terms must equal 360 degrees, the total degrees in a circle. 2. **Use the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence:** The sum S of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:    [    S = n cdot frac{a_1 + a_n}{2}    ]    Here, n = 15 and S = 360, so:    [    15 cdot frac{a_1 + a_{15}}{2} = 360    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    a_1 + a_{15} = 48    ] 3. **Express a_{15} in terms of a_1 and d:** The last term a_{15} can be written as:    [    a_{15} = a_1 + 14d    ]    Substituting into the equation a_1 + a_{15} = 48, we find:    [    a_1 + (a_1 + 14d) = 48    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    2a_1 + 14d = 48    ] 4. **Solve for a_1 in terms of d**: Rearranging:    [    a_1 = frac{48 - 14d}{2}    ] 5. **Determine valid values for d:** a_1 must be an integer, thus 48 - 14d must be an even number. Also, a_1 must be positive. 6. **Check possible values for d:** Starting with smaller values of d:    - If d = 2, then a_1 = frac{48 - 14 times 2}{2} = frac{48 - 28}{2} = 10 (an integer). 7. **Conclusion:** The smallest possible value for a_1 that satisfies all conditions is 10 degrees. Therefore, the degree measure of the smallest possible sector angle is 10. The final answer is boxed{10}"},{"instruction":"A profit of Rs. 500 is divided between X and Y in the ratio of 1/2 : 1/3.

The ratio of X's share to Y's share is 1/2 : 1/3. To make it easier to work with, we can convert these fractions to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6, so we can express the ratio as: X's share : Y's share = (1/2 * 6/6) : (1/3 * 6/6) X's share : Y's share = 3/6 : 2/6 Now, we can simplify the ratio to whole numbers by multiplying both parts by 6: X's share : Y's share = 3 : 2 The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts. Now, we can find the value of each part by dividing the total profit by the total number of parts: Value of each part = Total profit / Total parts Value of each part = Rs. 500 / 5 Value of each part = Rs. 100 Now we can find the individual shares of X and Y: X's share = 3 parts * Rs. 100/part = Rs. 300 Y's share = 2 parts * Rs. 100/part = Rs. 200 The difference between their profit shares is: Difference = X's share - Y's share Difference = Rs. 300 - Rs. 200 Difference = Rs. 100 Therefore, the difference between X's and Y's profit shares is Rs. boxed{100} ."},{"instruction":"Given a function y=f(x) with the domain interval D, if for a given nonzero real number m, there exists x_{0} such that f(x_{0})=f(x_{0}+m), then the function y=f(x) is said to have property P(m) on interval D.

Second Part: Proving the Right Inequality 1. **Rearrange Desired Inequality**:    We need to prove:        sum_{j=1}^n frac{2j+1}{j^2} < nleft(1 - n^{-frac{2}{n-1}}right) + 4.     2. **Rewrite Summation to Reflect Structure**:    Observe:        n + 4 - sum_{j=1}^n frac{2j+1}{j^2} > n cdot n^{-frac{2}{n-1}}.     3. **Manipulate the Expression**:    We rewrite:        n + 4 - sum_{j=1}^n frac{2j+1}{j^2} = 4 + sum_{j=1}^n left(1 - frac{2j+1}{j^2}right).     4. **Simplify Each Term**:    Given:        1 - frac{2j+1}{j^2} = frac{(j-1)^2 - 2}{j^2}.     5. **Separate the Summation Further**:    Now we handle it as follows:        4 + sum_{j=1}^n frac{(j-1)^2}{j^2} - 2sum_{j=1}^n frac{1}{j^2}.     6. **Approximate the Harmonic Series Sum**:    Use inequality for the sum of squares of reciprocals:        2 sum_{j=1}^n frac{1}{j^2} < 2left(1 + frac{1}{4} + sum_{j=3}^n frac{1}{(j-1)j}right) < frac{7}{2}.     7. **Evaluate the Square Terms**:    By introducing a parameter ( k ):        sum_{j=1}^n frac{(j-1)^2}{j^2} > frac{1}{4} - k + left[k + sum_{j=3}^n frac{(j-1)^2}{j^2}right].     8. **Bound the Sum**:    Therefore,        sum_{j=1}^n frac{(j-1)^2}{j^2} > frac{1}{4} - k + (n-1)left(frac{4k}{n^2}right)^{1/(n-1)} = frac{1}{4} - k + (n-1)(4k)^{1/(n-1)} n^{-2/(n-1)}.     9. **Select Appropriate ( k )**:    Choose ( k = frac{1}{4}left(frac{n}{n-1}right)^{n-1} ):        (n-1)(4k)^{1/(n-1)} = n.     10. **Substitute Final Expression**:     Hence,          sum_{j=1}^n frac{(j-1)^2}{j^2} > frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{4}left(frac{n}{n-1}right)^{n-1} + n cdot n^{-2/(n-1)}.      11. **Apply the Exponential Approximation for ( e )**:     Noting:          left(frac{n}{n-1}right)^{n-1} < e < 3,          leads to:          sum_{j=1}^n frac{2j+1}{j^2} < 4 + n cdot n^{-frac{2}{n-1}} - frac{1}{2} - frac{7}{2}.      12. **Final Inequality Establishment**:     Therefore:          n+4-sum_{j=1}^{n} frac{2 j+1}{j^2}>ncdot n^{-frac{2}{n-1}}.       Conclusion: We have shown:  nleft((n+1)^{frac{2}{n}}-1right)<sum_{j=1}^{n} frac{2j+1}{j^2}<nleft(1-n^{-frac{2}{n-1}}right)+4.  Thus, the proof is complete. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given a sphere G and a circle k inside it, such that the perpendicular projection of the center of G onto the plane of k lies on k. Furthermore, we know that there are two other spheres that are tangent to G and also pass through k. Show that the sum of the radii of these two spheres is equal to the radius of G.","output":"1. **Define and Identify Components**:     - Let G be the given sphere with center O and radius R.     - Let k be the circle inside G, such that the perpendicular projection of O onto the plane of k lies on k.     - Let G_1 and G_2 be the spheres tangent to G and also containing k, with centers O_1 and O_2, respectively. 2. **Consider the Plane S**:     - Notice that plane S passes through the centers O, O_1, and O_2.     - Since G_1 and G_2 are tangent to G at points on the diametral plane of k, S will also contain the center K of circle k.     - Since O projects perpendicularly onto point A on k, A lies on S as well. 3. **Geometric Relationships & Cross-Section**:     - The plane S intersects G in a great circle k^* with radius R.     - The plane S intersects G_1 and G_2 in circles with radii r_1 and r_2, respectively, both tangent to k^*.      - The segment AB in S is the projection of k onto S, with K being its midpoint. Thus, AB = 2a where a < R.     - Let the perpendicular distance from O to AB be d where d < R. 4. **Right Triangles and Distances**:     - In right triangles O_1KA and O_2KB, the hypotenuse is O_iK = sqrt{r_i^2 + a^2} (for i=1,2).     - For each i, the distance from O to O_i includes a term involving d and another term depending on whether the points are on opposite sides of K. Thus, O_iP can be expressed as sqrt{r_i^2 + a^2} pm d.     - By considering the geometry, applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangles involving O_i, O, and tangency points, we get:          left(sqrt{r_i^2 + a^2} pm dright)^2 + a^2 = (R - r_i)^2, quad (i=1,2)      5. **Simplifying**:     Simplify the equation:               (sqrt{r_i^2 + a^2} pm d)^2 + a^2 = R^2 - 2Rr_i + r_i^2               After expanding and simplifying both sides:          r_i^2 + a^2 pm 2dsqrt{r_i^2 + a^2} + d^2 + a^2 = R^2 - 2Rr_i + r_i^2                    pm 2dsqrt{r_i^2 + a^2} = R^2 - 2Rr_i - d^2 - a^2      6. **Formulating the Quadratic Equation**:     Squaring both sides and simplifying:          (2d sqrt{r_i^2 + a^2})^2 = (R^2 - 2Rr_i - d^2 - a^2)^2          Simplifies to a quadratic equation in r_i:          4d^2(r_i^2 + a^2) = R^4 - 4R^3r_i + 4R^2r_i^2 + d^4 + 2d^2a^2 + a^4           7. **Equation Comparisons & Sum of Roots**:     Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of roots of the quadratic equation gives the relationship between R, r_1, and r_2.     The sum of the roots r_1 and r_2 can be simplified as:          r_1 + r_2 = R          This completes the proof that the sum of the radii of the two spheres G_1 and G_2 tangent to G is equal to the radius of G. # Conclusion:     [     boxed{r_1 + r_2 = R}     ]"},{"instruction":"18 balls numbered 1 through 18 are placed in a bin.

However, there is no other integer in the list that can be added to 6 to give 12 (excluding 6 itself due to the distinctness condition), so removing 6 from the list will not reduce the number of pairs of distinct integers whose sum is 12. Since removing any integer besides 6 will reduce the number of pairs that add to 12, while removing 6 will leave the number of pairs that add to 12 unchanged, we find the highest probability of having a sum of 12 when we remove boxed{6}."},{"instruction":"Given that the quadrilateral pyramid SABCD has a square base ABCD and equal lateral edges, with SA=2sqrt{3}, determine the height of the pyramid when its volume is maximum.

The volume V of the pyramid is: V = frac{1}{3}a^2h = frac{1}{3} sqrt{12a^4 - frac{1}{2}a^6}. To find the maximum volume, we determine the derivative of the volume function with respect to side length a, denoted as y: y = 12a^4 - frac{1}{2}a^6.

Solving for a, we find that a=0 or a=4. Since a side length of zero does not make sense for a pyramid, the maximum volume occurs when a=4.

Find the maximum possible value of  k .","output":"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of vertices ( k ) in an acyclic graph with 2022 vertices such that every chosen vertex has at most 2 edges to other chosen vertices. We will use induction and some combinatorial arguments to establish the result. 1. **Define the Problem and Initial Setup:**    Let ( T ) be an acyclic graph (a tree) with ( n ) vertices. We need to find the maximum number of vertices ( k ) such that the induced subgraph formed by these vertices has a maximum degree of 2. We denote this subset as *good*. 2. **Base Case:**    For small values of ( n ), we can manually verify the result:    - If ( n = 1 ), the maximum ( k ) is 1.    - If ( n = 2 ), the maximum ( k ) is 2.    - If ( n = 3 ), the maximum ( k ) is 2.    - If ( n = 4 ), the maximum ( k ) is 3. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    Assume that for any acyclic graph with ( n leq 4a + b ) vertices (where ( 0 leq b < 4 )), the maximum number of vertices ( k ) such that the induced subgraph has a maximum degree of 2 is ( lceil frac{3}{4}n rceil ). 4. **Inductive Step:**    Consider an acyclic graph ( T ) with ( n = 4a + b ) vertices. We need to show that the maximum ( k ) for ( T ) is ( lceil frac{3}{4}n rceil ).    - **Construction:**      Construct ( a ) disjoint star graphs, each with 4 vertices, and ( b ) isolated vertices. In each star graph, we can choose at most 3 vertices to form a good subset. Therefore, the total number of vertices we can choose is ( 3a + b ). This translates to ( lceil frac{3}{4}n rceil ).    - **Bounding Argument:**      We use induction to show that this bound holds for all ( n ).      - **Case ( k = 1 ):**        If ( k = 1 ), then ( deg(v_1) = 1 ). We can take a maximal good subset of ( T setminus {v_1} ) and add one vertex to it. By the inductive hypothesis, this is sufficient.      - **Case ( k = 2 ):**        Consider ( T' = T setminus {v_1, w_1, w_2, v_2} ). This subgraph contains ( n - 4 ) vertices. By the inductive hypothesis, it has a good subset with at least ( frac{3}{4}(n-4) = frac{3}{4}n - 3 ) vertices. Adding ( v_1, w_1, w_2 ) to this subset yields a good subset of ( T ) with at least ( frac{3}{4}n ) vertices.      - **Case ( k geq 3 ):**        Consider ( T' = T setminus {v_1, w_1, ldots, w_k} ), which contains ( n - k - 1 ) vertices. By adding ( w_1, ldots, w_k ) to a maximal good subset of ( T' ), we get a good subset of ( T ) containing at least:        [        frac{3}{4}(n - k - 1) + k = frac{3}{4}n + frac{1}{4}k - frac{3}{4} geq frac{3}{4}n        ]        vertices, since ( k geq 3 ). 5. **Conclusion:**    Combining these cases, we conclude that the maximum number of vertices ( k ) in an acyclic graph with ( n ) vertices such that every chosen vertex has at most 2 edges to other chosen vertices is ( lceil frac{3}{4}n rceil ).

Let:    [    S = frac{a_{n-1}}{2} + frac{a_{n-2}}{3} + cdots + frac{a_1}{n}    ]    Since all ( a_i > 0 ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ), it follows that ( S > 0 ). 4. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, we have:    [    a_n = frac{1}{n+1} - S    ]    Since ( S > 0 ), it follows that:    [    frac{1}{n+1} - S < frac{1}{n+1}    ]    However, since ( S ) is a sum of positive terms, it is less than ( frac{1}{n+1} ), ensuring that:    [    a_n > 0    ]    This completes the induction step.

Next, we analyze the parity of the terms in this expression. For any integer k, either k or k + 3 is even, making k(k + 3) always even. Similarly, for any integer j, either j or j + 1 is even, making j(j + 1) always even. Therefore, the entire expression 3k + j + (k + j)^2 is always even, since it is a sum of even numbers. We then claim that for any nonnegative integer n, there exist unique nonnegative integers j and k such that [3k + j + (k + j)^2 = 2n.] To see this, let a = k + j. Then, the expression becomes [3k + j + (k + j)^2 = 2k + a + a^2 = a^2 + a + 2k.] For a fixed a, k can range from 0 to a, which means a^2 + a + 2k takes on all even integers from a^2 + a to a^2 + 3a. For a + 1, we have [3k + j + (k + j)^2 = (a + 1)^2 + (a + 1) + 2k = a^2 + 3a + 2 + 2k,] which takes on all even integers from a^2 + 3a + 2 to a^2 + 5a + 4. This pattern continues for increasing values of a, ensuring that for different values of a = k + j, the possible values of 3k + j + (k + j)^2 do not overlap and cover all even integers exactly once. Therefore, the original sum can be rewritten as a sum over all nonnegative even integers 2i: [sum_{j = 0}^infty sum_{k = 0}^infty 2^{-3k - j - (k + j)^2} = sum_{i = 0}^infty 2^{-2i}.] This is a geometric series with the first term a = 2^0 = 1 and common ratio r = frac{1}{4}.

It is worth noting that individual responses to training can vary, and what works for one person may not necessarily work for another. It is always best to consult with a certified fitness professional to develop a workout routine that aligns with your specific goals and capabilities. They can assist in designing a program suitable for your needs, taking into account factors such as your fitness level, recovery capacity, and training goals."},{"instruction":"how do I make sure that I am making my body focus on muscle hypertrophy","output":"To ensure that your body focuses on muscle hypertrophy, you can follow these guidelines: 1. Lift in a moderate to heavyweight range: Focus on lifting weights that are challenging for the given rep range. Aim for 8-12 reps per set to stimulate muscle growth. Gradually increase the weight over time as you become stronger. 2. Use progressive overload: Continually strive to increase the intensity of your workouts by adding weight, increasing reps, or decreasing rest periods. This progressive overload principle helps promote muscle growth. 3. Control the eccentric phase: Slowly lower the weight during the eccentric phase of each exercise to maximize muscle stimulation. For example, take about 2-3 seconds to lower the weight during a squat or bench press. 4. Prioritize compound exercises: Incorporate compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously. These exercises, such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows, recruit more muscle fibers and promote overall muscle growth. 5. Allow for adequate rest and recovery: Muscles grow during the recovery phase, so make sure to give your body enough time to rest and rebuild. Get enough sleep, eat a balanced diet with sufficient protein, and incorporate rest days into your training program. 6. Focus on progressive resistance training: Ensure that your resistance training program is structured and progressive, gradually increasing the demands on your muscles over time. 7. Monitor and adjust your training program: Regularly assess your progress, both in terms of strength gains and muscle development. If you're not seeing the desired results, consider adjusting your routine, exercise selection, or intensity. Remember that building muscle takes time and consistency. It's also crucial to listen to your body and avoid overtraining. Consulting with a certified fitness professional can provide you with personalized guidance and create a training program tailored to your goals."},{"instruction":"o que é melhor: um boost que aumenta os ganhos em 10x por 4 horas ou um que aumenta em 100x por 10 minutos?","output":"Isso depende de vários fatores, como o contexto em que você está buscando um aumento nos ganhos e suas metas específicas. Se você está procurando por um ganho significativo durante um curto período de tempo, o boost que aumenta os ganhos em 100x por 10 minutos pode ser mais adequado. Essa opção pode ser útil em situações em que você precisa alcançar uma meta financeira rapidamente, como em uma venda ou negócio pontual. Por outro lado, se você está procurando por um aumento consistente ao longo de algumas horas, o boost que aumenta os ganhos em 10x por 4 horas pode ser mais vantajoso. Essa opção pode ser útil em cenários em que você precisa aumentar seus ganhos ao longo de um período mais extenso, como ao trabalhar em um projeto ou emprego com duração determinada. Em última análise, a escolha entre essas opções depende de suas necessidades e preferências individuais. É importante considerar seus objetivos, planejamento financeiro e as circunstâncias específicas em que você está buscando um aumento nos ganhos."},{"instruction":"o que é melhor: um boost que aumenta os ganhos em 10x por 4 horas ou um que aumenta em 100x por 10 minutos? considere o valor total no final do tempo","output":"Se considerarmos apenas o valor total no final do tempo, o boost que aumenta os ganhos em 100x por 10 minutos seria a opção mais vantajosa. Com esse boost, você teria um aumento de 100 vezes nos ganhos durante os 10 minutos, o que pode resultar em um valor total mais alto nesse curto período de tempo. Por exemplo, se você normalmente ganha R100 em 10 minutos, com esse boost você ganharia R10.000. Por outro lado, o boost que aumenta os ganhos em 10x por 4 horas resultaria em um aumento de 10 vezes nos ganhos durante as 4 horas. Embora seja uma opção que proporciona um aumento consistente ao longo de um período mais longo, seu valor total provavelmente seria menor em comparação com o boost de 100x por 10 minutos. No entanto, é importante considerar outros fatores além do valor total, como a consistência, a estabilidade e a confiabilidade do boost. Por exemplo, se você precisa de um ganho mais estável ao longo de 4 horas, o boost de 10x por 4 horas pode ser mais adequado, mesmo que o valor total seja menor. Portanto, a escolha entre essas opções depende do seu objetivo específico e da importância que você dá para o valor total versus a consistência e a duração da vantagem no aumento dos ganhos."},{"instruction":"o que é melhor: um boost que aumenta os ganhos em 10x por 4 horas ou um que aumenta em 100x por 10 minutos? considere o valor total no final do tempo e mostre os valores, tome 100 como valor inicial","output":"Considerando um valor inicial de 100 para os ganhos, podemos calcular o valor final para cada uma das opções: 1. Boost que aumenta os ganhos em 10x por 4 horas: - Primeiro, multiplicamos o valor inicial por 10 a cada hora: - Após 1 hora: 100 * 10 = 1000 - Após 2 horas: 1000 * 10 = 10000 - Após 3 horas: 10000 * 10 = 100000 - Após 4 horas: 100000 * 10 = 1000000 - Portanto, o valor final após 4 horas seria 1.000.000. 2. Boost que aumenta os ganhos em 100x por 10 minutos: - Nesse caso, multiplicamos o valor inicial por 100: - Após 10 minutos: 100 * 100 = 10000 - Portanto, o valor final após 10 minutos seria 10.000. Ao comparar os valores finais, vemos que o boost que aumenta os ganhos em 10x por 4 horas resulta em um valor final muito maior, de 1.000.000, em comparação com o boost que aumenta em 100x por 10 minutos, que resulta em 10.000. Portanto, se considerarmos apenas o valor total no final do tempo, o boost que aumenta os ganhos em 10x por 4 horas seria a opção preferível.

Despite its name suggesting a liberal democratic stance, its ideology does not align with liberal democracy as understood in many Western contexts. The party was led by its founder, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, until his death in April 2022. Zhirinovsky was known for his fiery rhetoric, controversial statements, and often provocative political stunts. Key aspects of the LDPR's ideology have included: 1. **Russian nationalism:** The LDPR advocates for a strong Russian national identity and has often emphasized the defense of ethnic Russians' rights both within Russia and in neighboring countries. 2. **Authoritarianism:** The party has shown support for a strong, centralized state authority and has been supportive of the Kremlin's power consolidation, particularly under Vladimir Putin, although it sometimes positions itself as an opposition party for electoral purposes. 3. **Populism:** The party often uses populist strategies to appeal to voters, offering simple solutions to complex problems and claiming to represent the \\"common people\\" against the elite establishment. 4. **Protectionism:** In economic policies, the LDPR has supported protectionist measures to defend Russian industries and workers from foreign competition. 5. **Social conservatism:** The party promotes traditional social values and has opposed various liberal policies related to LGBTQ+ rights and other progressive social movements. 6. **Territorial expansionism:** The LDPR and Zhirinovsky have been known for making extreme statements about expanding Russia's territory and re-establishing influence or control over former Soviet states and territories. 7. **Anti-Western sentiment:** The party often expresses distrust of Western countries and international institutions, positioning Russia as a countering force to Western influence in the world. It's important to note that the party's stances and its charismatic leader's statements have occasionally been provocative and erratic, making it difficult to categorize the LDPR as strictly adhering to a doctrinal ideology. Their platform can be a mix of extreme nationalism, opportunistic populism, and a catch-all approach designed to resonate with various segments of Russian society, often leveraging anti-establishment sentiments. The LDPR's actual impact on policy and governance in Russia may be limited, as the country's political system is heavily dominated by the United Russia party and the executive branch, which has been under the control of Vladimir Putin for several consecutive terms."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What causes quantum fluctuations?","output":"Quantum fluctuations are a natural consequence of the uncertainty principle at the heart of quantum mechanics. These random, temporary changes in the energy of a point in space arise because particles and fields cannot have precisely determined properties simultaneously. This inherent “jitteriness” of the quantum world means that even the vacuum of space is not completely empty but teems with virtual particles popping in and out of existence."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is Ergodic theory and sojourn time?","output":"Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the long-term statistical behavior of dynamical systems. It explores how systems evolve over time and whether their trajectories eventually distribute evenly across the available space. Sojourn time, within this context, refers to the duration a system state spends in a particular region of the phase space throughout its evolution, helping to understand the temporal aspects of the system's behavior and its statistical properties."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] Can you give me an example of sojourn time in practice?","output":"In practice, sojourn time might be exemplified by considering a particle moving in a confined space. As it bounces around, we can measure how long the particle spends within a designated area. For instance, if we're observing gas molecules in a container, sojourn time would be the statistical average of the durations each molecule spends in a corner of the container over a long period. This concept is crucial in fields like meteorology, where sojourn time could denote how long a weather system remains over a particular region, affecting climate predictions and models."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] Does sojourn time apply to macroscopic systems, or only microscopic systems?","output":"Sojourn time applies to both macroscopic and microscopic systems. In macroscopic systems, it might refer to how long a planet stays in a certain area of its orbit, while in microscopic systems, it could relate to the duration an electron resides in a specific orbital. Regardless of scale, sojourn time is a versatile concept used to analyze the time-dependent behavior of dynamic systems across various disciplines."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is Recurrence period density entropy?","output":"Recurrence period density entropy is a measure within complex systems theory related to the predictability and complexity of a time series or dynamical system. It quantifies the density of recurrent states over time, linking the frequency and timing of these recurrences to the system's overall entropy. This measure provides insights into the system's dynamics, revealing patterns and structures that might not be apparent through other methods, and is useful in studying phenomena ranging from weather patterns to brain activity."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is Shannon Entropy and what does it measure?","output":"Shannon entropy is a fundamental concept from information theory that measures the unpredictability or uncertainty in a dataset or information source. It quantifies the average amount of information produced by a stochastic process, with higher entropy indicating greater randomness and less predictability. Shannon entropy is instrumental in diverse fields such as cryptography, communication theory, and statistical physics, helping to assess the efficiency of data compression and the capacity of communication channels."},{"instruction":"Ideology of Party of Growth","output":"The Party of Growth (Russian: Партия Роста, Partiya Rosta), is a political party in Russia that, as its name suggests, primarily focuses on economic growth and development as the cornerstone of its platform. It is a center-right, pro-business party with a liberal-conservative ideology that advocates for a free market economy, small government, and the reduction of state interference in the economy. The Party of Growth was founded in February 2016 as a rebranding of the Just Cause (Russian: Правое дело, Pravoye Delo) party. It positions itself as a party supporting entrepreneurs and the middle class, emphasizing the importance of creating favorable conditions for business, promoting innovation, and improving the investment climate. Some of the key principles and policies commonly associated with the Party of Growth include: 1. Promoting entrepreneurship and removing barriers to starting and running businesses. 2. Simplifying the tax code to foster business development and economic expansion. 3. Ensuring property rights and the rule of law to attract both domestic and foreign investments. 4. Implementing reforms to reduce corruption and increase transparency in government activities. 5. Fostering a competitive environment through deregulation and antitrust laws. 6. Investing in infrastructure and modernizing transportation to facilitate trade and commerce. The party also addresses social issues, advocating for improvements in education, health care, and social security, but their main emphasis remains on creating a robust and dynamic economy, which they believe is the foundation for improving the standard of living for all citizens. While the Party of Growth is not a major player in Russian politics, it strives to appeal to business owners, professionals, and those who believe in a market-oriented approach to economic policy. It is important to note that, in the context of Russian politics, the actual influence and independence of the Party of Growth, as with any political party, can be limited due to the centralized control of the political system under the leadership of Vladimir Putin and the prominent role of the United Russia party."},{"instruction":"Answer these questions very briefly. 1.

Ortaçağ'da Üniversite Bugünkü üniversite kavramının akademik ve kültürel kökleri Ortaçağ Av. rupa'sına gider. Batı dünyasında kurulan ilk üniversitelerin, başlangıçta Hris tiyan katedral okulları olarak oluşturulmalarına rağmen, 12. yüzyılda bugünkü anlamda üniversiteye dönüştüğü görülmektedir. Manastır ve Kilise okulları üniversitelerin kökenini teşkil eder. Örneğin Paris Üniversitesi'nin nüvesini (çekirdeğini) Notre Dame İlahiyat (Teoloji) okulu teşkil etmektedir. Başlan- gıçta tek bir fakülteden meydana gelen üniversiteler daha sonra akademik alanlar ve fakülteler olarak çeşitlenmiştir. Hukuk, İlahiyat (Théologie/Tcoloji) ve Tıp Fakülteleri üniversitelerin temel alanlarını oluşturur. Ortaçağ'da ilk üniversite İtalya'da Bolonga şehrinde 1119'da kurulmuş- tur. Bu üniversiteyi sırasıyla Salerno, Padua, Paris Üniversiteleri (1200'ler), Cambridge, Oxford (1249), Prag (1348), Kraków (1364). Viyana (1365), Heidelberg (1386), Köln (1388), Erfurt (1392), Leipzig (1409), Rostock (1419), Greifswald (1456), Freiburg (1457), Basel (1460), Ingolstadt (1472).

Tanrı Cermenlere Kayzerliği (İmpa- ratorluk), Italyanlara Papalığı ve Fransızlara da ilmi vermiştir sözü bu tarihi gelişme ile ilgili olarak yakıştırılmıştır. Almanya'da üniversitelerin (Prag Üniversitesi, Viyana Üniversitesi, Heidelberg, Erfurt, Laipsig, Roştak vs.) kuruluşları bu ilk hareketlerden bir yüzyıl sonrasında (14. yüzyıl) gerçekleşir. Alman Üniversiteleri Paris örneğine göre kurulmuştur; bu süreçte İlahiyat öğrenimi için Paris büyük ve öncelikli konumunu korumuştur. Böylelikle kuzey ve merkez Avrupa'da kurulan üniversiteler ilk örneklerini İtalya'daki kuruluşlardan; bunlar da İspanya ve Sicilya'daki başta medreseler olmak üzere İslâmi kültür ve eğitim kuruluşlarından esinlenmiştir. Bu tecrübe Orta çağdaki bilim ve felsefe hareketlerine İslâm dünyasındaki kuruluşların takad- düm ettiği, onlara örnek teşkil ettiğini göstermektir. 4.1.

Teoloji öğrencisi olabilmek için sekiz yıl süren Yedi Özgür Sanat öğre- nimini başarı ile tamamlamak gerekirdi. Teoloji öğrenimi de sekiz yıl sür- mekteydi. Teolojiyi başarı ile tamamlayan kişi Baccalaures (Doçent) olma hakkına sahip olurdu. Doçentlikte dört yılı tamamlayan Magister (profesör) olurdu. 4.1.3. Hukuk Fakültesi (\\"Facultas Descretistarum\\") Hristiyanlığın nassları (öğretileri) ve bunların hukuksal açıklamalarına da- yalı hukuk bilgileri öğretilmekteydi. 4.1.4.

The Afterlifecore TV show cartoon has a style similar to Wander over Yonder, a popular animated series known for its whimsical and adventurous nature."},{"instruction":"Describe anti-afterlifecore","output":"Anti-afterlifecore is an aesthetic that challenges the belief in an afterlife and embraces concepts such as eternal oblivion, the nonexistence of an afterlife, Orwellianism, brutalism architecture, nihilism, capitalism, and anti-fun. It rejects the notion of self-love and creativity as controversial and instead focuses on stringent rules, abuse, Alzheimer's-induced comas, bad luck, and nightmares. Anti-afterlifecore foods are described as cheap, disgusting, oppressive, and tormenting, with a strong emphasis on enforcing strict and abusive laws, particularly the rule of not rejecting foods. Here are some examples of these foods: 1. Soylent Bugs: Insects ground up and made into a repulsive paste-like substance. 2. Trash Dessert: A dessert that does not contain any food creams, but instead replicates the taste and texture of trash. 3. Actual Chocolate: A deceptive fake chocolate secretly made from feces, symbolizing coprophagic manipulation and the forced consumption of it by people. 4. Traumatic Soup: A liquid concoction made from toilet water, mixed with pizza vegetables and ice cream scraps. 5. Abusive Salad: A salad adorned with ashes from garbage and houseflies. 6. Soulless Cereals: Brutal cereals made from excrement and garbage, served with rotten black milk. Consuming these cereals is often associated with being banished to garbage lands and forced to eat trash and waste. The anti-afterlifecore language resembles a mix of Newspeak (from George Orwell's \\"1984\\") and Chinese script. This language is likely meant to evoke a sense of control, limited expression, and uniformity. The anti-afterlifecore TV show cartoon has a style influenced by North Korean or Russian cartoons. These cartoons often portray a strict adherence to regulations, propaganda, and limited individualism, reflecting the ideals of the anti-afterlifecore aesthetic."},{"instruction":"My workbook resides within the folder SERVICE PROVIDERS The folder I want to open has its name dispalyed in B1 The folder also resides in the folder SERVICE PROVIDERS I want to open the folder which has the name displayed in B1 on my active sheet.

Without additional context, it's challenging to specify the ideology of \\"New People.\\" Here are some possibilities that various uses of \\"New People\\" might entail: 1. **In a Fictional or Conceptual Sense**: \\"New People\\" can be a term used in a fictional or speculative context, perhaps in science fiction or futurist discourse, where it could refer to a group in society who have adopted a new way of life or evolved into a new stage of human development with distinct beliefs and practices. In this case, their ideology would be tied to the specific narrative or theory in which they're presented. 2. **As a New Generation**: If \\"New People\\" refers to a new generation or cohort in society, such as Millennials or Gen Z, then their collective ideology might trend towards values like inclusivity, digital connection, social justice, environmental sustainability, and innovation. However, it's important to note that any generational group is highly diverse, and no single ideology could fully encompass the views of all its members. 3. **Political or Social Movements**: Sometimes \\"New People\\" could be a referent to members of a new political or social movement. This could vary widely depending on the regional and historical context. The ideologies of such movements could range from progressive to conservative and include a variety of social, economic, and political goals. 4. **Cultural or Ethnic Groups**: In some contexts, \\"New People\\" could refer to immigrants or a population group that has recently become prominent in a particular area. The ideology of such groups would likely be closely related to their cultural background and their adaptative patterns and responses to new social environments. 5. **A Specific Organization or Party**: \\"New People\\" could be the name of a specific political party, movement, or organization with its unique set of beliefs, goals, and principles. For instance, in some countries, there may be political parties or civic groups called \\"New People's Party\\" or a term to that effect, and they would have a well-defined ideological platform. 6. **Spiritual or Religious Movement**: Occasionally, \\"New People\\" may describe members of a new religious or spiritual movement that has a particular set of beliefs or practices that distinguish it from established traditions. To give you a precise answer, I would need more context or information about which \\"New People\\" you are referring to. If you can provide that, I can then discuss the specific ideologies associated with that group."},{"instruction":"Ideology of New People (Russia)","output":"\\"New People\\" (Russian: Новые люди, Novye Lyudi) is a political party in Russia founded in 2020. The party presents itself as being focused on pragmatic and technocratic approaches to solving problems, emphasizing innovation and entrepreneurship. The ideology of New People could be described as centrist or center-right, with a pro-business orientation. They advocate for policies that would support economic modernization, the expansion of individual freedoms, and the development of civil society. While they are not directly confrontational with the Kremlin, they seek to appeal to a younger, urban, and more liberal constituency that may be looking for fresh political alternatives within the framework of the current Russian political system. Key points of the New People's platform typically include: 1. Promoting business and reducing bureaucratic barriers: They propose measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and reduce excessive regulation. 2. Emphasizing technology and innovation: The party promotes the adoption of new technologies and innovative approaches to both business and governance. 3. Advocating for quality education: New People stress the importance of modernizing the education system to prepare citizens for the demands of the 21st-century economy. 4.

Ensuring good governance: The party advocates for the transparency and efficiency in government operations to combat corruption and improve public administration. While the New People attempt to position themselves as a fresh and modern force in Russian politics, some critics argue that the party's emergence is somewhat tolerated by the Kremlin as a way to provide a controlled outlet for public demand for change, without posing a serious challenge to the dominant United Russia party or President Vladimir Putin's leadership. This is a common pattern in the Russian political landscape, where genuine opposition is often marginalized. However, it's important to be cautious about labeling any political entity in Russia, as the political space is heavily influenced by the authoritarian context and the channels for legitimate opposition are limited. The 'real' ideology of parties can sometimes be obscured by the need to operate within the constraints set by the prevailing political order."},{"instruction":"Ideology of United Russia","output":"United Russia (Единая Россия) is a conservative political party in Russia and it has been the country's dominant political party since the early 2000s. The party's ideology is often characterized by the following elements: 1. Centralized Power: United Russia supports a strong, centralized federal government and has consistently backed measures to strengthen the power of the presidency and federal authorities, sometimes at the expense of regional autonomy. 2. Conservatism: The party promotes conservative values, emphasizing tradition, patriotism, and social cohesion. This includes support for the Russian Orthodox Church and conservative stances on social issues. 3. Statism: The party is associated with statist economics, supporting a significant role for the state in the economy. This can include state direction of key sectors, support for national champions (major Russian corporations), and measures to protect domestic industries. 4. Nationalism: Nationalistic sentiment, including pride in Russian history and culture, is a key part of the party’s appeal. United Russia promotes the idea of Russia as a great power with a special role in world affairs. 5.

The party has portrayed itself as a guarantor of steady development, contrasting the stability of the Putin era with the turmoil of the 1990s. 6. Pragmatism: While having its own ideological leanings, United Russia is also known for its pragmatic approach to policy-making, sometimes shifting positions or adopting policies from other parties to consolidate power or address public demands. 7. Opposition to Western Liberalism: United Russia often positions itself against Western liberal values, which it portrays as foreign to Russian culture and society. It supports policies that emphasize sovereignty and resists what it perceives as foreign interference in Russia's internal affairs. United Russia's ideology has evolved over time and has been described as a \\"big tent\\" party, encompassing a wide range of views but generally aligned with the interests of the current leadership and the state apparatus. The party has been closely associated with President Vladimir Putin, although he is not formally a member. Putin's own vision for Russia and his leadership style have greatly influenced the party's direction and policy choices."},{"instruction":"what triggers a \\"app is not responding\\" message? What goes on inside the network to send such a request?","output":"When you see an \\"app is not responding\\" message on your device, it typically means that the application you are using is unable to process or respond to the requests being sent to it in a timely manner. There can be several reasons for this: 1. CPU or Processing Load: If the app is utilizing excessive CPU resources or is overwhelmed with processing tasks, it may become unresponsive. This can happen when the app is performing complex calculations, handling large amounts of data, or running resource-intensive operations. 2.

Temel trafo bağlantı şekilleri şunlardır: 1. **Yıldız (Star) Bağlantısı:** Her sargının bir ucu ortak bir noktada birleştirilir, bu ortak nokta nötr olarak da adlandırılır ve genellikle topraklanır. Yıldız bağlantısı kullanmanın bazı sebepleri şunlardır: - Faz ve nötr arasındaki gerilim, fazların gerilimi (line voltage) ile faz arası gerilim (phase voltage) arasında √3 oranında bir fark sağlar. Bu özellik, farklı voltaj seviyelerine ihtiyaç duyan sistemlerde esneklik sağlar. - Gerilim düşümünü ve enerji kaybını azaltmanın yanı sıra yok dengesi olan yükler için istikrarlı bir nötr sağlar. 2. **Delta (Δ) Bağlantısı:** Sargıların uçları birbirine seri şekilde bağlanarak bir üçgen veya delta şeklini alır. Delta bağlantısının kullanılmasının nedenleri ise şunlardır: - Her faz ayrı bir döngü oluşturduğu için, bir sargının arızalanması durumunda sistemin diğer iki faz ile çalışmaya devam etmesine olanak tanır. - Faz dengesizliğini emebilme kapasitesi olması nedeniyle, dengesiz yüklerde ve harmonik akım taşıyan uygulamalarda tercih edilir. 3. **Zikzak Bağlantısı:** Her faz, bağımsız her bobinin yarısıyla bağlanır ve zikzak şekli oluşturur. Zikzak bağlantısına ihtiyaç duyulmasının nedenleri şunlardır: - Nötr sağlamak için, özellikle yüksek oranda dengesiz yüklerin olduğu durumlarda kullanışlıdır. - Harmonikleri azaltma yeteneği sayesinde, özellikle üçüncü harmoniği filtreleyerek elektrik sisteminin genel kalitesini artırır. Transformatör bağlantılarına ihtiyaç duyulmasının temel nedenleri şunlardır: - **Voltaj Seviyesi Ayarlama:** Trafo bağlantı tipleri, farklı voltaj seviyeleri arasında dönüşüm yaparak, gereken voltaj seviyesinin yük tarafına uygun şekilde teslim edilmesini sağlar. - **Sistem Adaptasyonu:** Güç sistemleri, üzerinde çalıştıkları standarda göre farklı faz sayılarına sahip olabilirler (örneğin, üç fazlı veya tek fazlı). Trafo bağlantıları sayesinde, bu farklı sistemler arasında geçiş yapmak mümkündür. - **Güç Kalitesi ve Güvenilirlik:** Trafo bağlantılarının özellikleri, sistemdeki dengesiz yükleri ve harmonikleri yönetmeye yardımcı olur, bu da genel güç kalitesini ve sistem güvenilirliğini artırır.

Star-Star bağlantısının kullanılmasının birçok avantajı vardır: 1. **Nötr İmkanı:** Star-Star bağlantısında, her iki tarafın da nötr noktaları olduğu için topraklama yapmak mümkündür. Bu, sistemin toprak hatası gibi durumlar karşısında daha güvenli hale gelmesini sağlar ve faz-nötr arızalarının etkilerini sınırlar. 2. **Düşük İzolasyon Gereksinimi:** Her bir sargının yalıtım seviyesi, faz geriliminin (√3 ile çarpılmamış) tek faz gerilimine göre tasarlanabilir, bu da transformatörün yalıtım maliyetini ve karmaşıklığını azaltır. 3. **Faz Dengesi:** Yıldız bağlantısı, dengesiz yükler durumunda bile fazlar arasında daha iyi bir denge sağlar ve nötr aracılığıyla dengesiz akımları toprağa atabilir. 4. **Gerilim Dönüşümü:** Bu bağlantı, farklı voltajlar arasında dönüştürme ihtiyacına uygun şekilde voltaj seviyesi ayarlama olanağı sunar. 5. **Harmoniklerin Azaltılması:** Star-Star bağlantısı, özellikle üçüncü harmonikler gibi sıfır dizi akımları için bir yol sağlar. Bu harmonikler transformatorun nötründen akabilir, böylelikle sistemdeki harmonik bozulmanın azalmasına katkı sağlayabilir. 6. **Düşük Mekanik Stres:** Star-Star bağlantılı transformatörler, sargılarda daha düşük genlikli mekanik gerilime maruz kalırlar, çünkü sistem kısa devre durumunda fazlar arası voltajın √3 katı yerine tek faz gerilimiyle sınırlıdır. 7. **Uygulama Esnekliği:** Yıldız bağlantısı, hem yüksek gerilim (HV) hem de düşük gerilim (LV) uçlarında kullanılabileceği için çoklu voltaj seviyelerine uygun çalışma olanağı sunar. Bununla birlikte, Star-Star bağlantısının da dezavantajları bulunmaktadır. Örneğin, star bağlantılı transformatörler kısa devre koşullarında daha düşük kısa devre empedansına sahip olabilirler ve bu da onları kısa devre akımlarına karşı daha hassas yapabilir. Ayrıca, yüksek oranda dengesiz yüklerin olduğu durumlarda yetersiz performans gösterebilirler. Bunun yanı sıra, özellikle bir taraf açık devre olursa veya ciddi yük dengesizlikleri varsa, ferrorezonans adı verilen aşırı gerilim durumlarına daha eğilimlidirler.

The ideology of Unity was based on principles of centrism, with a strong support for the then acting President Vladimir Putin. The party sought to consolidate various groups around a platform of stability, supporting the continuation of Putin's policies, which were seen as a middle ground between the extremes of communism and liberal capitalism. While it wasn't deeply ideological in a traditional sense, the party was generally supportive of strong state power, economic reform that maintained stability, and the restoration of Russia's status as a major power on the global stage. In a very short span of time, Unity managed to gain significant support, in part thanks to the Kremlin's backing and widespread media coverage.

The ideology of the Taiwan Statebuilding Party centers around the belief that Taiwan should be recognized as a sovereign nation, distinct from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Their key ideological points include: 1. **Taiwanese Nationalism**: The party promotes the identity of Taiwan as an independent entity, with its own unique culture, history, and political identity, separate from China. 2. **Support for Independence**: The party openly supports formal independence for Taiwan, a stance that is in contrast to status quo policies or unification with China promoted by other parties. 3. **Democracy and Sovereignty**: The Taiwan Statebuilding Party upholds democratic values and the sovereignty of Taiwan, arguing that the people of Taiwan have the right to determine their own future and political status. 4. **Progressive Social Policies**: The party also advocates for progressive social policies, including LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality, and social justice. 5. **Environmental Sustainability**: They often emphasize the importance of environmental protection and the development of sustainable energy policies, reflecting a broader trend among Taiwanese political movements. 6. **Economic Development**: While promoting independence, the party also focuses on the economic development of Taiwan. They stress the need to strengthen Taiwan's economy to ensure that it can stand independently on the world stage. It's important to note that the political landscape in Taiwan is complex, and within it, there are a variety of positions concerning Taiwan's national identity, its relationship with the PRC, and the question of independence. The Taiwan Statebuilding Party is one of several small parties that play a role in Taiwan's vibrant democracy, which is dominated primarily by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which also leans towards Taiwan's independence, and the Kuomintang (KMT), which has historically been more favorable towards closer relations with China, although its stance has evolved in response to changing political realities and public opinion."},{"instruction":"Comment au revoir à ton fiancé lorsque tu voyages lorsque l'avion","output":"Il y a différentes façons de dire au revoir à ton fiancé avant de voyager en avion.

للمريض وتأكيد الحاجة إلى العلاج. يمكن للطبيب بعد ذلك أن يقرر تجديد الوصفة الطبية على فترات محددة دون الحاجة إلى زيارة كل مرة، وهذا يعتمد على: 1. الحالة الصحية للشخص واستقرارها. 2. لوائح الرعاية الصحية والقوانين في البلد الذي يعيش فيه الشخص. 3. البروتوكولات الداخلية لعيادات الأطباء أو المستشفيات. 4. طبيعة الدواء الموصوف، حيث يتطلب بعض الأدوية مراقبة أكثر تواتراً من الأطباء. في العموم، إذا كانت حالة المريض مستقرة والدواء لا يتطلب تقييمًا مستمرًا، فقد يقوم الطبيب بتجديد الوصفة لفترات زمنية طويلة، وقد يُسمح أيضًا للمريض بالحصول على الدواء من الصيدلية دون الحاجة إلى زيارة الطبيب في كل مرة. من الممكن أيضًا وجود خدمات استشارية عبر الهاتف أو منصات الرعاية الصحية عن بُعد التي تتيح للمرضى تجديد الوصفات الطبية دون الحاجة لزيارة الطبيب شخصيًا، خصوصًا في حالات الأمراض المزمنة المعروفة والمستقرة. مع ذلك، فإن بعض الأدوية وخصوصًا تلك التي لها قابلية للإدمان أو تؤثر على وظائف حيوية حرجة في الجسم، قد تحتاج إلى متابعة ومراجعة دورية من قِبل الطبيب لتقييم فعاليتها والتأكد من سلامة الجرعات وضبطها إذا دعت

En mathématiques, le terme \\"différencier\\" se réfère généralement à prendre la dérivée d'une fonction. La dérivation est un concept fondamental en calcul différentiel qui permet de déterminer le taux de variation instantané d'une fonction par rapport à une de ses variables. Pour différencier une fonction simple \`f(x)\` par rapport à \`x\`, on applique les règles de dérivation. Voici quelques règles de base : 1. Constante: Si \`f(x) = c\` où \`c\` est une constante, alors la dérivée \`f'(x) = 0\`. 2. Puissance: Si \`f(x) = x^n\` alors \`f'(x) = n * x^(n-1)\` où \`n\` est un nombre réel. 3. Somme/Différence: Si \`f(x) = g(x) + h(x)\` alors \`f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x)\`, et si \`f(x) = g(x) - h(x)\` alors \`f'(x) = g'(x) - h'(x)\`. 4. Produit: Si \`f(x) = g(x) * h(x)\` alors \`f'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x)\` selon la règle du produit. 5. Quotient: Si \`f(x) = g(x) / h(x)\` alors \`f'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2\` selon la règle du quotient. 6. Chaîne: Si \`f(x) = g(h(x))\` alors \`f'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)\` selon la règle de la chaîne. Pour des fonctions plus complexes, il peut être nécessaire d'appliquer plusieurs de ces règles en combinaison, ainsi que d'autres techniques de dérivation telles que la dérivation logarithmique ou la dérivation implicite. Voici un exemple simple de différenciation : Soit la fonction \`f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5\`. Pour trouver la dérivée \`f'(x)\`, on applique les règles de puissance et de somme : 1. La dérivée de \`x^2\` est \`2 * x^(2-1)\` soit \`2x\`. 2. La dérivée de \`3x\` est simplement \`3\` car la dérivée de \`x\` est \`1\`. 3. La dérivée de \`5\`, qui est une constante, est \`0\`. Donc la dérivée de \`f(x)\` est \`f'(x) = 2x + 3\`. Tout en sachant calculer les dérivées à la main, dans la pratique, de nombreuses personnes utilisent des logiciels de calcul symbolique ou des calculatrices graphiques pour différencier des fonctions plus complexes."},{"instruction":"No Filme: Os Vingadores: O Que O Capitão América Quis Dizer Com: \\"Eu Entendi A Referencia\\"","output":"No filme \\"Os Vingadores\\" (The Avengers, 2012), o Capitão América, também conhecido como Steve Rogers, diz a frase \\"I understood that reference\\" (\\"Eu entendi essa referência\\", em tradução livre) durante uma conversa entre os personagens.

Quando Stark faz essa comparação, a câmera corta para o Capitão América que diz, aliviado, \\"Eu entendi essa referência\\". Essa fala é cômica porque Steve Rogers foi congelado durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial e só foi revivido no mundo moderno, perdendo mais de 70 anos de cultura popular. Sua vida anterior ao congelamento foi nos anos 1940, então ele muitas vezes não entende as referências culturais contemporâneas.

A história acompanha um programador de 29 anos chamado Ichiro Suzuki, que de repente é transportado para um mundo de fantasia RPG no qual ele estava trabalhando, mas sob a forma de seu avatar de jogo de 15 anos, Satou Pendragon. No mundo de fantasia, as habilidades de Satou são incrivelmente aumentadas após um inesperado combate com uma horda de monstros que ele derrota usando uma poderosa magia de área que estava destinada para testes de depuração no jogo. Essa ação causa um \\"Death March\\" (Marcha da Morte), que lhe concede enormes quantidades de experiência e níveis, tornando-o extremamente poderoso de forma instantânea. A partir desse ponto, o anime segue as aventuras de Satou enquanto ele explora este novo mundo. Ele decide esconder seus níveis poderosos e habilidades e viajar como um simples mercador. Ao longo de sua jornada, ele conhece vários outros personagens, muitos dos quais se tornam suas companheiras, incluindo uma elfa, anões, e outras figuras místicas. A série mistura elementos de fantasy, harem, e slice of life enquanto Satou descobre os segredos deste mundo, ajudando pessoas ao longo do caminho e procurando uma maneira de potencialmente voltar para a sua realidade original. \\"Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody\\" é um exemplo de história isekai, um subgênero de fantasia em que um personagem do mundo real é transportado para ou reencarna em um mundo paralelo ou de fantasia.

A transição para o outro mundo ocorre subitamente enquanto Satou está adormecido após longas horas de trabalho encarando códigos sem parar, sugerindo que ele pode ter adormecido ou desmaiado no seu local de trabalho devido ao excesso de cansaço. Quando ele acorda, está no mundo do jogo que ele estava ajudando a desenvolver, mas sem compreender imediatamente como ou por que ele foi transportado para lá. Ele inicialmente acredita que pode estar sonhando ou participando de algum tipo de teste realista para o jogo. Durante a série, essa transição é muitas vezes tratada com um elemento de mistério e as razões por trás dela são exploradas de forma mais gradual. Como é comum em histórias de isekai, o foco se volta para as aventuras do personagem principal neste novo mundo, em vez de concentrar-se exclusivamente em encontrar uma explicação para o transporte entre os mundos. Até o meu conhecimento atual, a light novel e a adaptação para o anime não fornecem uma explicação detalhada sobre as razões ou mecanismos metafísicos que levaram à transferência de Satou para o mundo de fantasia.

Founded in 2001 by the Kaczyński twins - Jarosław and Lech - the party adheres to a mix of conservative, nationalist, and right-wing ideologies. As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, here are some of the key ideological tenets of Law and Justice: **Conservatism:** Law and Justice has a strong conservative platform that emphasizes traditional family values, Christian beliefs, and the importance of maintaining Polish cultural norms. The party is generally aligned with the Catholic Church and often takes stances against measures such as abortion and same-sex marriage. **Nationalism:** PiS promotes a patriotic and nationalistic sentiment, emphasizing Polish sovereignty and independence. The party often champions rhetoric that stresses the importance of protecting Polish interests, both within Europe and in the broader international arena. **Social welfare:** Despite its conservative values, Law and Justice advocates for robust social welfare policies. This includes their flagship program \\"Family 500+\\", which provides monthly financial assistance to families for every child after the first. Such policies have been popular among many Poles, particularly those in rural areas and small towns. **Euroscepticism:** While not advocating for Poland's exit from the European Union, Law and Justice often expresses skepticism towards deeper European integration. The party argues for the protection of national decision-making power against what it perceives as overreach by EU institutions. **Judicial reforms:** One of the most controversial aspects of the Law and Justice governance has been its approach to judicial reform. The party argues that the Polish judicial system requires an overhaul to eradicate corruption and inefficiencies. However, critics, including the European Union, claim that the reforms undermine judicial independence and have led to conflicts with EU law. **Strong state:** PiS favors a strong role for the state in the economy and society. This is reflected in its preference for state intervention and control over certain economic sectors, as well as its advocacy for a central role for the government in guiding social policies. These ideological stances have led to both domestic and international controversies, particularly concerning the rule of law and Poland's relationship with the European Union. Law and Justice has faced criticism for measures that opponents argue erode democratic institutions, although the party contends that its policies are intended to combat elitism and restore justice. It is essential to recognize that political ideologies are dynamic and can evolve or adapt in response to various factors, including public opinion, international developments, and the party's own strategic goals. Therefore, the current ideological stance of Law and Justice or any other political entity could have changed beyond my knowledge cutoff date."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a alchemist time-travelling from 1923 to 2023.

El costo de oportunidad representa el valor de la mejor alternativa a la que se renuncia cuando se toma una decisión. No se trata simplemente del costo monetario directo de una acción, sino del valor de lo que podríamos haber hecho en lugar de la acción que elegimos. Por ejemplo, si decides gastar tiempo y dinero en ir a la universidad, el costo de oportunidad incluiría no solo la matrícula y los costos relacionados, sino también los ingresos que pierdes al no trabajar a tiempo completo durante el periodo de estudio. Si en vez de eso hubieras trabajado, podrías haber ganado dinero; por lo tanto, ese ingreso no ganado es parte del costo de oportunidad de tu educación. Este concepto ayuda a las personas y empresas a valorar diferentes opciones y tomar decisiones más informadas. Al considerar los costos de oportunidad, se busca optimizar los recursos disponibles al elegir la opción que ofrezca el mayor beneficio potencial o la menor pérdida de valor."},{"instruction":"Hablando del riesgo del trabajador a que pierda en el futuro su trabajo. Cuál sería lo que se renuncia para obtenerlo?","output":"La frase \\"el costo de algo es aquello a lo que se renuncia para obtenerlo\\" podría aplicarse a la situación de un trabajador y el riesgo de perder su trabajo en el futuro, aunque es una interpretación indirecta del concepto de costo de oportunidad. Si nos enfocamos en lo que renuncia un trabajador para mantener su trabajo o para prepararse contra el riesgo de perderlo en el futuro, podríamos considerar diversas alternativas de acción y lo que cada una de ellas implica renunciar. Algunos ejemplos podrían incluir: 1. **Inversión en habilidades y educación continua:** Un trabajador puede decidir invertir en su educación y en el desarrollo de nuevas habilidades para ser más competitivo en el mercado laboral y reducir el riesgo de desempleo. El costo de oportunidad aquí serían los recursos (tiempo, dinero, esfuerzo) que se gastan en esa formación, que podrían haberse utilizado para el ocio, otro tipo de trabajo, o invertido en otras formas. 2. **Trabajar horas extras o tomar roles adicionales:** Si un trabajador decide hacer horas extras o asumir más responsabilidades para aumentar su seguridad laboral, el costo de oportunidad podría ser el tiempo personal o familiar que se sacrifica para dedicarlo al trabajo adicional. 3. **Ahorrar en lugar de gastar:** Un trabajador puede optar por ahorrar un porcentaje de su salario para tener un colchón financiero en caso de perder el empleo. Al hacerlo, renuncia al consumo inmediato o a la inversión de ese dinero en otros aspectos de la vida, como viajes, bienes de consumo o experiencias. 4. **No cambiar de trabajo:** Un trabajador puede decidir no tomar oportunidades de empleo potencialmente mejores debido al riesgo que estas conllevan, como una fase inicial en una startup o un contrato temporal. El costo de oportunidad de quedarse en un trabajo más seguro puede ser el potencial ingreso o satisfacción personal que podría haberse obtenido en la nueva posición. En todos estos casos, el trabajador está sopesando los posibles beneficios y costos de diferentes acciones para atenuar el riesgo futuro de desempleo. El \\"costo\\" aquí no es directamente monetario, sino más bien el valor de las oportunidades no aprovechadas al elegir una acción sobre otra. Esto destaca la importancia de considerar el costo de oportunidad al tomar decisiones, ya que ayuda a comprender las implicaciones y sacrificios asociados con cada elección."},{"instruction":"Entonces cual seria el costo?","output":"Si estamos hablando específicamente sobre el costo relacionado con el riesgo de un trabajador de perder su empleo en el futuro, este podría conceptualizarse no en términos de costo de oportunidad, sino como un \\"costo\\" más general asociado con la pérdida potencial de empleo. Aquí hay algunas formas de entender los costos asociados con ese riesgo: 1. **Costo financiero:** Si un trabajador pierde su empleo, enfrentará costos financieros directos debido a la pérdida de ingresos. Esto puede afectar su capacidad para cubrir gastos cotidianos, pagar deudas y mantener su nivel de vida. 2. **Costo de la búsqueda de empleo:** Si un trabajador es despedido, tendrá que invertir tiempo y, posiblemente, dinero en la búsqueda de otro trabajo. Esto puede incluir la preparación de currículos, asistencia a entrevistas, o incluso capacitación para mejorar sus habilidades. 3. **Costo emocional y de estrés:** La inseguridad laboral y la pérdida de empleo a menudo conllevan un alto costo emocional debido al estrés, la ansiedad y la incertidumbre sobre el futuro. 4. **Costo de oportunidad de carrera:** La interrupción de la carrera puede significar perder oportunidades de desarrollo profesional y avance, así como la posible desactualización de habilidades si el período de desempleo es prolongado. 5. **Costo social:** En algunos casos, perder un empleo puede llevar al aislamiento social y la pérdida de relaciones profesionales. Las redes sociales a menudo se construyen y mantienen a través del trabajo, y estas pueden verse afectadas por el desempleo. 6. **Costo de jubilación y beneficios:** La pérdida de un empleo también podría significar la pérdida de aportes a planes de jubilación y de beneficios adicionales como seguro de salud, lo cual tendría un impacto a largo plazo en la seguridad financiera del trabajador. Los trabajadores pueden, y a menudo lo hacen, tomar medidas para mitigar estos costos, como construir fondos de emergencia, mantener un conjunto diverso de habilidades transferibles y mantener una red profesional sólida que pueda ayudar en la búsqueda de nuevas oportunidades en caso de despido."},{"instruction":"Los ojos estan en el craneo?","output":"Sí, los ojos están alojados en el cráneo.

Estas cavidades orbitarias protegen los ojos y están formadas por varios huesos del cráneo. Dentro de estas cavidades se encuentran no solo los globos oculares, sino también músculos, nervios, vasos sanguíneos y glándulas lacrimales que son esenciales para la función visual y la protección de los ojos. La estructura ósea de las órbitas proporciona un soporte resistente, salvaguardando los ojos de lesiones mecánicas que podrían ocurrir por impactos directos a la región facial.

En primer lugar, el capitalista (inversor o propietario del capital), al poner capital en un negocio, se expone al riesgo financiero. Si el negocio fracasa, el capitalista puede perder su inversión inicial y no obtener el retorno esperado. La capacidad de \\"arriesgar\\" se deriva no sólo de la disposición a perder, sino también de la capacidad de invertir capital que se ha acumulado o se ha obtenido a través de préstamos, lo que a menudo significa asumir la responsabilidad de pagar esos préstamos independientemente del éxito del negocio. Por otro lado, los trabajadores también asumen riesgos, pero de diferente naturaleza. Ellos podrían arriesgar su estabilidad laboral, invertir tiempo en adquirir habilidades específicas para el trabajo, y corren el riesgo de perder su fuente de ingresos si la empresa no tiene éxito. Sin embargo, su nivel de riesgo por lo general no incluye la pérdida de capital. Para que un negocio tenga éxito, es necesario tanto el capital como el trabajo, así como la asunción de riesgos por ambas partes. El éxito del negocio generalmente resulta en ganancias que pueden ser compartidas entre capitalistas y trabajadores a través de salarios, beneficios, dividendos e inversión en el crecimiento de la empresa. **Analogía:** Considera una expedición de buceo en busca de tesoros sumergidos. Un benefactor (el capitalista) proporciona el barco, el equipo de buceo y la tecnología necesaria para localizar el tesoro. Los buceadores (los trabajadores) aportan sus habilidades y esfuerzo físico para llevar a cabo la búsqueda. Si la expedición descubre un tesoro, el benefactor recibe una parte del botín para compensar su inversión inicial y asumir el riesgo de que la expedición pudiera haber vuelto con las manos vacías. Los buceadores reciben su pago por el trabajo realizado y, dependiendo del acuerdo, también podrían tener una participación en el botín para reflejar su contribución y el riesgo de trabajar en un entorno peligroso. Si la expedición fracasa y no se encuentra ningún tesoro, el benefactor pierde su inversión, mientras que los buceadores pueden perder el tiempo y haber arriesgado su seguridad. Tanto el capital como el trabajo han asumido riesgos, aunque diferentes en su naturaleza, y ambos son necesarios para la empresa. El ingreso recibido refleja la combinación de estos riesgos y contribuciones."},{"instruction":"Qué es la filosofía?","output":"La filosofía es una disciplina intelectual que se ocupa de explorar y analizar preguntas fundamentales sobre la existencia, la realidad, el conocimiento, los valores, la mente, el lenguaje, y la moralidad, entre otros temas. Originada en la antigua Grecia, la filosofía se ha desarrollado a lo largo de la historia y ha generado una amplia gama de corrientes de pensamiento, teorías y subdisciplinas. Características y funciones de la filosofía incluyen: 1. **Pensamiento crítico:** La filosofía promueve la evaluación crítica de las creencias y argumentos. Utiliza la lógica y el razonamiento analítico para cuestionar las suposiciones y explorar consecuencias de diversas ideas. 2. **Interrogación fundamental:** Los filósofos abordan preguntas como \\"¿Qué es la verdad?\\", \\"¿Qué podemos conocer?\\", \\"¿Qué es justo?\\", y \\"¿Cuál es el sentido de la vida?\\", preguntas que no siempre pueden ser respondidas definitivamente y que invitan a la exploración constante. 3. **Exploración de conceptos:** La filosofía busca dar claridad a conceptos que pueden ser ambiguos o complejos, como la justicia, la belleza, o la libertad. 4. **Fundamentos teóricos:** En muchos casos, la filosofía proporciona los fundamentos teóricos sobre los que se construyen otras disciplinas, como las ciencias naturales, las ciencias sociales, la religión, el derecho, y la política. 5. **Ética y valores:** La ética, una rama principal de la filosofía, investiga qué es lo correcto y lo incorrecto, y cómo debemos vivir nuestras vidas. 6. **Metodología:** A diferencia de las ciencias empíricas que se basan en la observación y experimentación, la filosofía emplea principalmente el argumento racional, el análisis conceptual y la reflexión profunda. La filosofía se divide en varias áreas principales, incluyendo: - **Metafísica:** Estudio de la naturaleza fundamental de la realidad y del ser. - **Epistemología:** Investigación sobre la naturaleza y los límites del conocimiento y la creencia. - **Ética:** Análisis de los valores y principios que guían el comportamiento moral. - **Lógica:** Exploración de los principios del razonamiento válido y correcto. - **Estética:** Reflexión sobre el arte, la belleza y el gusto. - **Filosofía política:** Examen de conceptos como el poder, la justicia, los derechos y la organización social. A lo largo de los siglos, la filosofía ha tenido un rol vital en la formación del pensamiento humano y en la evolución de las sociedades, influyendo en la manera en que entendemos el mundo y a nosotros mismos."},{"instruction":"Qué exponentes tienen una visión crítica con la filosofía?","output":"Varios pensadores y críticos han mantenido una relación ambivalente con la filosofía, a menudo reconociendo su valor mientras cuestionaban ciertos aspectos, métodos o conclusiones. Algunos exponentes con visiones críticas de la filosofía incluyen: 1. **Friedrich Nietzsche:** Nietzsche criticó a la filosofía occidental, especialmente la tradición socrática y platónica, por lo que percibía como su desconexión de la vida y sus valores. Acusó a los filósofos de crear sistemas abstractos que ignoraban o negaban la corporeidad, la pasión y el poder. 2. **Ludwig Wittgenstein:** En la segunda fase de su carrera, Wittgenstein adoptó una visión crítica de la filosofía tradicional, argumentando que muchos problemas filosóficos surgen de malentendidos del lenguaje. Su enfoque terapéutico pretendía disolver las confusiones filosóficas más que resolverlas de la manera tradicional. 3. **Karl Marx:** Aunque formado en la tradición filosófica, Marx fue crítico con la filosofía especulativa y la acusó de ignorar las condiciones materiales y la clase. Para Marx, la filosofía debía ser práctica y orientada a la transformación social y económica, según lo reflejado en su famosa tesis \\"Los filósofos solo han interpretado el mundo de diversas maneras, pero de lo que se trata es de transformarlo\\". 4. **Richard Rorty:** Como parte del movimiento pragmatista y neo-pragmatista, Rorty criticó la representación tradicional de la filosofía como la búsqueda de verdades universales y fundamentos últimos. En lugar de ello, argumentó que la filosofía debe centrarse en la utilidad y el beneficio de sus aplicaciones. 5. **Theodor W. Adorno y la Escuela de Frankfurt:** Los teóricos críticos de la Escuela de Frankfurt, como Adorno, cuestionaron las narrativas de la ilustración y la racionalidad que dominaban la filosofía occidental. Argumentaron que la razón había sido cooptada por sistemas de opresión y que la filosofía debería desempeñar un papel crítico en la liberación de la sociedad de tales estructuras. 6. **Martin Heidegger:** Aunque Heidegger es uno de los filósofos más destacados del siglo XX, en su obra tarde critica lo que él llama la \\"metafísica occidental\\" por su enfoque en la representación y por perder de vista la pregunta por el ser. Estas críticas no llevan a estos pensadores a desechar completamente la filosofía; más bien, intentan reorientar su enfoque, cambiar la forma en que se practica o desafiar determinadas premisas que han sido ampliamente asumidas en la tradición filosófica. Su trabajo ha llevado a renovadas discusiones y avances en la filosofía, demostrando que la disciplina es dinámica y capaz de autocriticarse y evolucionar."},{"instruction":"Qué autor rechaza la caracterización de filosofía?","output":"Uno de los autores más conocidos por rechazar ciertas caracterizaciones tradicionales de la filosofía es Ludwig Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein es particularmente famoso por sus críticas a la manera en que la filosofía había sido concebida y practicada en la historia. En su obra temprana, el \\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\\", Wittgenstein sugiere que la filosofía debe delimitarse al lenguaje lógico y al análisis de proposiciones con significado. Aquí, aunque no rechaza la filosofía per se, sí limita su alcance a lo que puede ser claramente dicho o mostrado a través de la lógica. Sin embargo, es en sus escritos posteriores, especialmente en \\"Investigaciones Filosóficas\\", donde Wittgenstein critica abiertamente la concepción y práctica tradicional de la filosofía. Argumenta que muchos \\"problemas filosóficos\\" surgen en realidad de confusiones sobre el uso del lenguaje y la búsqueda de esencias o significados ocultos que no existen. Según esta visión, la filosofía no debería ser considerada como una doctrina o teoría, sino más bien como una actividad, una práctica crítica que disuelve confusiones y aclara el funcionamiento de nuestro lenguaje. Wittgenstein propuso que el papel de la filosofía no es especular sobre teorías metafísicas ni ofrecer explicaciones sobre la naturaleza de la realidad, sino que su tarea es aclarar las confusiones lingüísticas que llevan a problemas filosóficos aparentes. Por esta razón, Wittgenstein a menudo es asociado con la corriente filosófica conocida como \\"filosofía del lenguaje ordinario\\", y su obra marca un giro importante en el siglo XX sobre cómo la filosofía entiende su propia naturaleza y propósitos."},{"instruction":"Alguno dijo que el que hace mejor filosofía es el que no está queriendo hacer filosofía?","output":"La idea de que la mejor filosofía se hace sin la intención explícita de hacer filosofía no se atribuye a un único filósofo, sino que refleja una variedad de actitudes críticas hacia la disciplina. Sin embargo, esta noción captura un espíritu similar al de algunos autores prominentes que han expresado desconfianza hacia la filosofía académica o profesional, o han visto valor en una forma de pensamiento que no se ajusta a los moldes tradicionales de la disciplina filosófica. El mencionado Ludwig Wittgenstein, por ejemplo, en sus \\"Investigaciones Filosóficas\\", rechazó gran parte de la filosofía tradicional y argumentó que la confusión y el sinsentido a menudo emergían del intento de hacer filosofía de maneras convencionales. Su idea era que la filosofía debería apuntar a mostrar el \\"mosaico\\" de nuestro lenguaje \\"tal como es\\", en lugar de reconstruirlo o teorizar sobre él. Por otro lado, Henri David Thoreau, aunque no es principalmente conocido como filósofo, expresó en sus escritos una vida en sintonía con la naturaleza y la necesidad de vivir deliberadamente, cuestionando la sociedad y sus valores, lo que puede ser visto como una forma de filosofía práctica que emerge de la experiencia de vida más que del trabajo académico típico en filosofía. Otra perspectiva interesante es la de los filósofos existencialistas como Søren Kierkegaard, quien enfatizó la individualidad y el compromiso personal en contraposición a la filosofía sistemática y abstracta. Para Kierkegaard y otros existencialistas, las verdades más significativas son subjetivas y emergen de la experiencia personal y auténtica de cada individuo. Además de estos, algunos críticos de la filosofía contemporánea han señalado que algunas de las mejores \\"filosofías\\" pueden encontrarse fuera de los departamentos de filosofía, en la literatura, en el arte, en la lucha social y en la vida cotidiana, donde las personas reflexionan y actúan sobre sus creencias y valores de manera más implícita y práctica. Estos críticos podrían argumentar que las personas que no se etiquetan a sí mismas como filósofos a menudo pueden estar haciendo \\"mejor filosofía\\" al aplicar un pensamiento reflexivo y crítico en la práctica."},{"instruction":"Ideology of Civic Platform","output":"Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska, PO) is a political party in Poland that has been considered to be center-right or centrist in its ideological orientation. Founded in 2001, Civic Platform has played a significant role in Polish politics, including holding the presidency and leading the government at different times. The ideology of Civic Platform is based on the following principles and values: 1. Liberal Democracy: Civic Platform is a proponent of liberal democratic values. This means they support a political system that emphasizes individual freedoms, the rule of law, equal rights, and competitive elections. 2. Free Market Economy: The party advocates for a free market economic system, with an emphasis on entrepreneurship, private business, and economic liberalism. They generally support policies that encourage economic growth, innovation, and competition while also being open to social market economy aspects that balance free markets with social welfare. 3. European Integration: Civic Platform is strongly pro-European and supports Poland's continued integration with the European Union. The party has been a proponent of adopting the euro currency and deepening European cooperation in various domains. 4. Civic Engagement: The name of the party itself underscores its commitment to citizen involvement in the political process. Civic Platform encourages active participation of the populace in civic life and the decision-making process. 5. Social Policies: While advocating for free market principles, Civic Platform also understands the need for a social safety net to support the vulnerable sections of society. As such, they often promote policies that are centrist on social issues, supporting a balanced approach that aims to reconcile economic efficiency with social cohesion. 6. Security and NATO: Civic Platform values Poland's membership in NATO and has a strong stance on national defense and security. They advocate for international cooperation in defense and have supported modernizing Poland's military capabilities. Over time, the party's stance can shift on various issues as they respond to the changing political climate and societal needs. The core of Civic Platform's identity, however, remains anchored in promoting a liberal, pro-European, and economically liberal Poland. It's important to note that political ideology is dynamic and subjective, and different members within the party may hold a range of views on certain issues."},{"instruction":"Si on trouverait la solution a immortalité qu est-ce que ce passera","output":"Si on trouvait une solution à l'immortalité (c’est-à-dire la capacité pour les êtres humains de vivre éternellement ou indéfiniment), cela provoquerait sans aucun doute de profonds changements dans la société, la culture, l'économie et de nombreux autres aspects de la vie humaine. Voici quelques-unes des nombreuses conséquences possibles : 1. **Surpopulation :** Avec les gens cessant de mourir, la population mondiale pourrait augmenter considérablement, conduisant à une surpopulation. Cela pourrait entraîner une pénurie de ressources, notamment de nourriture, d'eau, et de logements. 2. **Systèmes socio-économiques :** Les systèmes de retraite, les services de santé et d'autres aspects du bien-être social seraient sous une pression énorme ou deviendraient obsolètes. Les économies doivent être repensées pour s'adapter à une main-d'œuvre potentiellement âgée mais toujours active. 3. **Inégalités :** Il est probable que l'accès à l'immortalité ne serait pas équitable. Les inégalités déjà existantes pourraient s'aggraver si seuls les riches ou certains groupes avaient accès à l'immortalité. 4. **Implications éthiques et morales :** Les questions éthiques seraient au premier plan. Est-il juste de vivre éternellement? Quelles seraient les conséquences sur la structure familiale? Comment cela affecterait-il nos concepts de mariage, de parentalité, et de l'héritage? 5. **Changement des priorités personnelles :** Les objectifs de vie individuels pourraient changer. Les gens pourraient choisir de reporter leur éducation, leur carrière ou de fonder une famille, sachant qu'ils ont un temps infini devant eux. 6. **Ressources naturelles et environnement :** La durabilité serait un défi encore plus grand avec une population immortelle, nécessitant des avancées significatives dans les technologies écologiques et de recyclage pour éviter l'épuisement des ressources naturelles. 7. **Innovation et progrès :** Avec plus de temps, les individus pourraient poursuivre des projets à long terme et contribuer à un progrès scientifique ou culturel continu, mais cela pourrait aussi ralentir le renouvellement des idées si les mêmes personnes gardent le pouvoir indéfiniment. 8. **Philosophie de vie et religion :** Les religions et philosophies qui se concentrent sur l'au-delà pourraient être remises en question ou adaptées pour tenir compte de la nouvelle réalité de l'immortalité. 9. **Gestion de la population :** Des mesures de contrôle des naissances pourraient être mises en place pour éviter une croissance démographique non durable. 10. **Recherche médicale :** Les recherches pourraient se déplacer des maladies mortelles aux maladies contribuant à la qualité de vie, car même sans mort, des problèmes de santé pourraient persister. Rappelons que ce scénario de l'immortalité reste pour l'instant de la science-fiction et il soulève des questions qui vont bien au-delà de la science, touchant à la philosophie, à la religion, à l'éthique, et même à des questions pratiques comme la gestion des ressources et le développement durable."},{"instruction":"On pourrait changer de planète si il y a trop de gens","output":"L'idée de coloniser d'autres planètes pour gérer une population croissante sur Terre est un concept populaire dans la science-fiction et a également été évoquée par des scientifiques et des entrepreneurs spatiaux. Cependant, il existe de nombreux défis techniques, économiques et éthiques à surmonter avant que cela puisse devenir une réalité. Voici quelques-uns des défis majeurs : 1. **Technologie de voyage spatial :** Nous n'avons pas encore la technologie permettant de transporter des humains sur de longues distances dans l'espace de manière sûre et viable. Les vols habités au-delà de la Lune, comme ceux vers Mars, sont encore en développement. 2. **Vie sur une autre planète :** Aucune planète dans notre système solaire, à part la Terre, n'est directement habitable pour les humains. La colonisation nécessiterait d'importants systèmes de support de vie, de la terraformation ou la construction d'habitats fermés pouvant reproduire les conditions terrestres. 3. **Ressources :** Le transport de personnes et de matériel nécessaire à la colonisation d'une autre planète serait incroyablement coûteux. Par ailleurs, il faudrait également trouver ou créer des sources de ressources essentielles sur la planète d'accueil. 4. **Délais :** Même si la technologie était disponible, le processus de colonisation serait lent. Les voyages vers Mars prennent environ 6 à 8 mois avec les technologies actuelles, ce qui signifierait que seulement un petit nombre de personnes pourraient être déplacées à chaque voyage. 5. **Éthique et politique :** Qui aurait le droit de coloniser une nouvelle planète ? Quel serait le statut juridique des colonies? Ces questions éthiques et politiques devraient être largement débattues et résolues. 6. **Impact sur l'environnement extraterrestre :** La colonisation d'une autre planète aurait d'importantes implications pour les écosystèmes locaux, si ceux-ci existent. Nous risquerions de contaminer ou de détruire des formes de vie inconnues. 7. **Adaptation humaine :** Les effets à long terme de la vie dans un environnement à faible gravité ou sans la protection du champ magnétique terrestre sur la santé humaine sont largement inconnus et potentiellement néfastes. En résumé, bien que la colonisation spatiale soit une idée séduisante pour remédier aux problèmes terrestres liés à la surpopulation et à d'autres enjeux de durabilité, il s'agit d'une solution lointaine qui ne peut pas être considérée comme une alternative à court terme. Pour le moment, il est plus pratique et réaliste de se concentrer sur la gestion durable de nos ressources terrestres et de travailler à minimiser l'impact environnemental de la population humaine sur notre planète."},{"instruction":"Bonjour j’aimerais savoir comment calculer le differenciel en mathematiuqe","output":"Bonjour! Dans le contexte des mathématiques, le \\"différentiel\\" peut signifier différentes choses en fonction du domaine d'étude (calcul différentiel, équations différentielles, géométrie différentielle, etc.). Cependant, le concept est généralement relié à la notion de changement infiniment petit. Voici quelques contextes dans lesquels on pourrait calculer un différentiel. 1. **Calcul différentiel (Dérivée)**: Un des calculs les plus fondamentaux en calcul différentiel est celui de la dérivée. La dérivée d'une fonction f(x) en un point x représente le taux de changement instantané de la fonction à ce point. Le différentiel de la fonction, noté df ou dy, est donné par l'expression: df = f'(x) dx où f'(x) est la dérivée de f au point x et dx est un accroissement infiniment petit de la variable x. Le différentiel df est alors l'approximation du changement de la fonction f quand x varie de dx. 2. **Calcul de Différentielles Totales**: Dans le cas de fonctions de plusieurs variables, par exemple f(x, y), on peut parler de différentielle totale. Si la fonction est différentiable, sa différentielle totale est donnée par: df = ∂f/∂x dx + ∂f/∂y dy où ∂f/∂x et ∂f/∂y sont des dérivées partielles de f par rapport à x et y, respectivement, et dx et dy sont des accroissements infiniment petits de x et y. 3. **Équations différentielles**: Les équations différentielles impliquent des fonctions et leurs dérivées. Par exemple, si vous avez une équation différentielle simple telle que: dy/dx = f(x) Pour la \\"résoudre\\", vous cherchez une fonction y(x) dont la dérivée est égale f(x). Le calcul précis dépend de la forme de l'équation différentielle et peut nécessiter diverses méthodes (séparation de variables, facteurs intégrant, série de puissance, méthodes numériques, etc). Le processus précis pour calculer un différentiel peut varier largement en fonction de la situation spécifique et du niveau d'abstraction. Dans les applications pratiques, les différentiels peuvent être utilisés pour des approximations linéaires, des estimations d'erreur, ou dans le cadre de l'intégration (par exemple, dans les méthodes de changement de variable). Si vous avez besoin d'informations plus détaillées sur un type spécifique de calcul différentiel (comme le calcul d'une dérivée particulière, la résolution d'une équation différentielle spécifique ou autre), n'hésitez pas à fournir plus de détails pour que je puisse vous offrir une assistance adaptée."},{"instruction":"Comment faire une intégration par changement de variable","output":"L'intégration par changement de variable, aussi connue sous le nom de substitution, est une méthode pour résoudre des intégrales qui ne sont pas immédiatement intégrables dans leur forme originale. Voici les grandes étapes pour effectuer une telle intégration : 1. **Choisir une nouvelle variable**: Identifiez une partie de l'intégrande (la fonction à intégrer) qui peut être remplacée par une autre variable, souvent notée u. Cette substitution est choisie pour simplifier l'intégrale. La relation entre u et la variable originale (souvent x) s'établit avec une fonction u = g(x). 2. **Calculer du**: Dérivez u par rapport à x pour trouver du. Cela veut dire que vous devez trouver g'(x) et puis écrire du = g'(x)dx. 3. **Substituer**: Remplacez toutes les instances de x dans l'intégrale par les expressions en termes de u, y compris remplacer dx par (du/g'(x)). À ce stade, vous aurez une intégrale en termes de u seulement si la substitution a été correctement effectuée. 4. **Intégrer par rapport à u**: Résolvez l'intégrale en u, ce qui devrait être plus simple après la substitution. 5. **Substituer en arrière**: Une fois que vous avez trouvé l'antidérivée en termes de u, remplacez u par sa valeur d'origine en x (u = g(x)) pour revenir à la variable initiale, x. Prenons un exemple pour illustrer cela: Supposons que vous souhaitiez intégrer l'expression suivante: ∫ e^(2x) dx Vous pouvez utiliser la substitution en posant u = 2x. La dérivée du par rapport à x est du = 2 dx, ou de manière équivalente, dx = du/2. L'intégrale devient alors: ∫ e^u * (du/2) Puisque nous avons un facteur constant (1/2), nous pouvons le sortir de l'intégrale: (1/2) ∫ e^u du C'est une intégrale plus simple que nous pouvons résoudre directement: (1/2) e^u + C Finalement, nous remettons u dans les termes de la variable originale: (1/2) e^(2x) + C Cela démontre comment l'intégration par changement de variable peut simplifier le processus d'intégration. C'est une technique puissante largement utilisée en calcul intégral."},{"instruction":"Donne moi un autre exemple pour que je m’entraîne","output":"Bien sûr, voici un exemple un peu plus complexe pour votre entraînement. Considérez l'intégrale suivante: ∫ (x * sqrt(x^2 + 1)) dx Suivez ces étapes pour effectuer l'intégration par changement de variable: 1. **Choisir une nouvelle variable**: Posez u = x^2 + 1. Ici, nous choisissons cette substitution car la racine carrée rend l'intégrale difficile, et en remarquant x^2 sous la racine, nous voyons une opportunité de simplification. 2. **Calculer du**: Calculez la dérivée de u par rapport à x. Donc du/dx = 2x, ou du = 2x dx. 3. **Réorganiser pour dx**: Résolvez l'équation différentielle pour dx: dx = du/(2x). 4. **Substituer dans l'intégrale**: Votre intégrale devient alors: ∫ x * sqrt(u) * (du/(2x)) Vous pouvez simplifier en annulant le x dans le numérateur et le dénominateur: (1/2) ∫ sqrt(u) du 5. **Intégrer par rapport à u**: Maintenant, intégrez par rapport à u. Vous obtenez: (1/2) ∫ u^(1/2) du = (1/2) * (2/3) * u^(3/2) + C = (1/3) * u^(3/2) + C Puisque u = x^2 + 1, l'intégrale devient: (1/3) * (x^2 + 1)^(3/2) + C Maintenant, vous avez votre intégrale résolue en termes de la variable originale x. Vous pouvez vérifier votre travail en dérivant ce résultat pour voir si vous retombez sur l'intégrande original (à l'exception de la constante d'intégration C)."},{"instruction":"what is social engineering?","output":"Social engineering is a term used primarily to describe a range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. It involves the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Unlike traditional hacking, which involves breaking into computer systems through technical means, social engineering exploits psychological principles and human error to trick individuals. Social engineering attacks often rely on the natural tendencies of human behavior, such as the inclination to trust, the reluctance to confront someone who seems to have authority, or the desire to be helpful. Attackers may use various tactics, such as: 1. Pretexting: Creating a fabricated scenario or pretext to engage a target in a manner that leads to information or access being unintentionally provided. 2. Phishing: Using email or malicious websites to solicit personal information by pretending to be a trustworthy organization. 3. Spear-phishing: A more targeted form of phishing, where the attacker has some prior knowledge about the victim and tailors the deception accordingly. 4. Baiting: Offering something enticing to the target in exchange for information or access, such as a free music or movie download that requires entering credentials. 5. Tailgating: Following closely behind a person to gain physical access to a restricted area without proper authorization. 6. Vishing (voice phishing): Using the telephone to scam the user into surrendering private information. 7. Quizzes and surveys: Distributing seemingly innocuous quizzes or surveys that lure individuals into providing sensitive information. The goal of social engineering is often to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or physical locations, or to convince someone to perform an action that may be detrimental to their own or their organization's security. Security education and awareness training are considered crucial components in defending against social engineering, as they can equip individuals with the knowledge and skepticism needed to recognize and resist these types of manipulative tactics."},{"instruction":"does setting up fake crowdfunding projects also fall uner this","output":"Setting up fake crowdfunding projects can indeed be considered a form of social engineering if the intention behind the project is to deceive and manipulate individuals into donating money under false pretenses. In this context, the manipulator exploits the goodwill and trust of people who believe they are contributing to a legitimate cause or supporting an innovative project. The tactics used in fake crowdfunding campaigns might involve creating a compelling but entirely fabricated story, using persuasive messaging, posting fake updates and testimonials, and even creating a false persona or organization to gain credibility. All of these elements are strategically designed to appeal to the emotions and generosity of potential backers, thereby convincing them to part with their money. While the manipulation in fake crowdfunding projects is financially driven, the core principle of exploiting human psychology and trust is consistent with the broader definition of social engineering. To protect against such scams, it's important for potential backers to perform due diligence on crowdfunding campaigns, looking for verifiable information, transparent communication, and evidence of the project's legitimacy before making a contribution."},{"instruction":"what skills does social engineering encompus?","output":"Social engineering encompasses a wide range of skills that are primarily psychological and interpersonal in nature, as it revolves around manipulating individuals into divulging information or performing certain actions. Some of the key skills involved include: 1. Communication Skills: Effective verbal and written communication skills are fundamental to social engineering, as the attacker must be able to construct plausible stories and interact convincingly with their targets. 2. Persuasion: The ability to persuade and influence others is crucial. Social engineers must convince their targets to take certain actions, share confidential information, or bypass security protocols, often without raising suspicion. 3. Understanding of Human Psychology: A good grasp of psychological principles, such as trust, authority, reciprocity, commitment, and social proof, enables social engineers to exploit these tendencies to their advantage. 4. Observation and Reconnaissance: Social engineers often gather information about their targets ahead of time through research and observation, enabling them to tailor their approach for better success. 5. Rapport-Building: The ability to establish a connection and build rapport quickly with targets can make them more likely to comply with requests or divulge sensitive information. 6. Storytelling and Pretexting: Crafting believable stories and scenarios (pretexting) that provide a cover for the engineer's true intentions is a key skill, used to gain the confidence and cooperation of targets. 7. Adaptability and Improvisation: Social engineers must be able to think on their feet and adapt to changing circumstances, particularly if a target becomes suspicious or a planned approach encounters unforeseen complications. 8. Attention to Detail: Attention to detail helps social engineers maintain consistency in their story and role, making it less likely for their target to detect any anomalies or deceit. 9. Emotional Intelligence: Recognizing and responding to the emotions of others can increase the effectiveness of a social engineering attempt, helping to manipulate the target's emotional state. 10. Technical Knowledge: While not always necessary, some degree of technical knowledge can be beneficial, especially when it comes to understanding the systems and security measures that are in place within an organization. 11. Deception and Misdirection: Skilled social engineers are adept at deceiving their targets and misdirecting their attention away from the true nature of the interaction. These skills, when combined, allow social engineers to devise and execute strategies that can lead to the unauthorized acquisition of information, access to systems, or financial gain at the expense of unwitting individuals or organizations. It's important to note that while these skills can be used for malicious purposes, they can also be employed in legitimate settings, such as penetration testing or security training, where the goal is to identify vulnerabilities in order to reinforce defenses against actual attacks."},{"instruction":"which skill is explisive to social engineering compared to lets say the skills needed to be a good marketer or copywriter?","output":"While many of the skills used in social engineering overlap with those needed in marketing, sales, copywriting, or other professions involving persuasion and communication, certain aspects are more distinctive to social engineering, largely due to its deceptive and manipulative nature. One such skill that stands out in the context of social engineering is: Pretexting: Pretexting is the act of creating a fabricated scenario or identity specifically to deceive someone into giving up information or access. While marketers and copywriters might create scenarios or personas to relate to their audience or to illustrate the benefits of a product, they typically do so without an intent to deceive for malicious purposes. Social engineers use pretexting explicitly to manipulate targets into compromising their own or their organization's security. The creation and maintenance of a false pretext for the purpose of fraud or theft is a skill that is fairly exclusive to social engineering. A few other skills that are more aligned with or emphasized in social engineering than in marketing or copywriting include: 1. Exploitation of Trust and Authority: Social engineers often exploit people's natural tendencies to trust others or follow perceived authority without question. While marketers might leverage authority (e.g., expert endorsements), they do so to build credibility for their products or services rather than to directly deceive individuals into harmful actions. 2. Emotional Manipulation: Although marketers and copywriters tap into emotions to engage consumers, social engineers manipulate emotions (like fear, greed, or sympathy) in a way that further primes targets for exploitation, often leading to rash decisions that compromise security. 3. Elicitation Techniques: Social engineers are adept at subtly extracting information from targets without them realizing that they are giving away anything sensitive or valuable. This skillset often includes advanced techniques of questioning, listening, and steering conversations that are not typically part of a marketer or copywriter's approach. 4. Bypassing Security Protocols: While marketers and copywriters strive to comply with rules and regulations (like data privacy laws), social engineers seek ways to circumvent security measures and protocols to achieve their goals. It's important to note that skills like persuasion, communication, and understanding human psychology are not inherently malicious—they can be used for good or ill. The key difference is intent: marketers and copywriters aim to attract and engage customers to promote products or services, while social engineers aim to deceive and manipulate individuals for unauthorized access or personal gain."},{"instruction":"do you think if youre good at one you're good at the other?","output":"Being skilled in one area, such as marketing or copywriting, does not automatically mean one will be skilled in social engineering, and vice versa. However, there are transferrable skills between these fields due to their common reliance on communication, persuasion, and understanding human behavior. Someone who is adept at marketing or copywriting may have a strong foundation in: 1. Crafting persuasive messages 2. Understanding audience needs and pains 3. Utilizing emotional triggers effectively 4. Creating compelling narratives These skills are certainly beneficial in a social engineering context, as they help build believable pretexts and engage targets. On the other hand, social engineering requires a specific set of skills and a certain mindset that goes beyond standard marketing practices, such as the willingness to deceive, manipulate, and exploit individuals for access or information. It's also important to consider ethical boundaries. A good marketer or copywriter operates within ethical guidelines, building trust with customers and respecting privacy and consent. Social engineers, by contrast, intentionally break ethical codes and often legal boundaries to achieve their goals. So, while a marketer or copywriter may have some of the communication and persuasion skills that could be useful in social engineering, the application of these skills in a deceitful and manipulative way is not generally within their professional or ethical scope. In conclusion, there might be overlapping skills, but being good at marketing or copywriting does not inherently equip someone to be effective at social engineering, and vice versa. Proficiency in one field requires a specific set of skills, mindset, and often ethical considerations that may not align with the other."},{"instruction":"which skills are the ones that aligns between them?","output":"Several core skills align between social engineering, marketing, and copywriting due to their shared emphasis on communication and influence. These include: 1. Persuasive Communication: The ability to craft messages that can influence people's attitudes, emotions, and actions. 2. Understanding of Human Psychology: Knowledge of what drives behavior, decision-making processes, and cognitive biases. 3. Empathy and Emotional Intelligence: The capacity to understand and connect with other people's emotions, which can inform how one tailors communication strategies. 4. Storytelling: Creating engaging narratives that capture attention and convey messages in a memorable way. 5. Active Listening: The skill of truly hearing what someone else is saying, asking insightful questions, and using the responses to shape subsequent communication. 6. Rapport Building: Establishing trust and a positive connection with individuals, which can influence their willingness to engage or take action. 7. Creativity: Developing innovative ways to present ideas, messages, or concepts to capture interest and stand out. 8. Research Skills: Gathering, analyzing, and utilizing information about an audience or target to better tailor messages to their interests, needs, or vulnerabilities. 9. Observation: Noticing details about people's behavior or environment that can be useful in crafting persuasive communication. 10. Adaptability: Modifying strategies or tactics in response to feedback or changing circumstances. While these skills are common to both social engineering and marketing/copywriting, it's important to reiterate that social engineering is used for malicious purposes, and thus, it often involves additional specific skills related to deception, manipulation, and exploitation. In contrast, ethical marketing and copywriting seek to build trust and provide value to the customer without compromising their security or privacy. The shared skills are used within very different ethical frameworks depending on the context."},{"instruction":"which one is objectivelly easier to learn as a whole? i mean use measures that you can say are somewhat objective","output":"Determining which one is objectively easier to learn—social engineering or marketing/copywriting—is challenging because the ease of learning any skill can be highly subjective and depends on various factors, including an individual's background, aptitudes, learning style, and previous experiences. However, there are some criteria we can consider that might differentiate the learning process for each: 1. **Availability of Resources**: - **Marketing/Copywriting**: There are abundant resources available to learn marketing and copywriting, including formal education, online courses, books, workshops, and more. The principles and practices of marketing are well-documented, and there are established best practices and ethical guidelines. - **Social Engineering**: Resources for learning social engineering are less formalized and may be of a dubious nature due to the often-illicit goals of social engineering. However, there is literature on the topic, particularly related to cybersecurity and ethical hacking, where understanding social engineering is crucial for defense purposes. 2. **Legality and Ethics**: - **Marketing/Copywriting**: Marketing and copywriting are legitimate fields with clear ethical standards. Professional organizations often provide guidelines and frameworks for responsible practice. - **Social Engineering**: The manipulative practices used in social engineering are often illegal and unethical when used for fraud, theft, or unauthorized access. Learning these skills for malicious purposes can lead to legal repercussions. 3. **Structured Learning Path**: - **Marketing/Copywriting**: There are clear career paths and educational tracks available in universities, colleges, and professional development programs that offer structured learning experiences. - **Social Engineering**: Learning to defend against social engineering is part of cybersecurity education, but there is no traditional educational path for becoming a social engineer due to its unethical nature. 4. **Practice Opportunities**: - **Marketing/Copywriting**: Opportunities to practice these skills are widely available through internships, entry-level positions, freelance work, and personal projects. - **Social Engineering**: Ethical practice opportunities are limited mainly to roles in security testing such as penetration testing or red teaming, where professionals simulate social engineering attacks to test an organization's defenses. 5. **Measurable Outcomes**: - **Marketing/Copywriting**: Success in marketing and copywriting can be measured through metrics such as sales, engagement, brand awareness, and conversion rates, which provide clear indicators of skill proficiency. - **Social Engineering**: Measuring the success of social engineering is more challenging in a legitimate context. It's often assessed through the success of security breach simulations or the efficacy of security training programs. Given these factors, it could be argued that marketing and copywriting present a more straightforward and transparent learning path due to the ample learning resources, ethical practice opportunities, and measurable outcomes that align with recognized professional standards. Learning how to defend against social engineering as part of cybersecurity can also be approached through formal education and ethical practice, but learning social engineering for illegitimate purposes is neither recommended nor conducive to a legal career. Ultimately, the ease of learning will vary greatly from person to person, and success in either field will depend on both the individual's effort and the quality of their training and experiences."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene about a alchemist time-travelling from 1923 to present time.

Inicialmente, você precisa instalar a biblioteca. Isso geralmente é feito via pip, o sistema de gerenciamento de pacotes para Python. No seu terminal ou linha de comando, digite o seguinte: \`\`\`sh pip install pyaudio \`\`\` Uma vez que \`pyaudio\` esteja instalado, você pode criar um script como o seguinte: \`\`\`python import pyaudio CHUNK = 1024 # Número de quadros de dados coletados de cada vez FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16 # Formato de dados (bytes de 16 bits) CHANNELS = 1 # Mono (para estéreo, use 2) RATE = 44100 # Taxa de amostragem: quantas amostras de som são coletadas por segundo # Inicialize a interface para PortAudio p = pyaudio.PyAudio() # Abra o fluxo usando as configurações da gravação stream = p.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=RATE, input=True, output=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK) print(\\"Streaming...\\") try: # Loop para capturar e reproduzir o áudio em tempo real while True: data = stream.read(CHUNK) stream.write(data, CHUNK) except KeyboardInterrupt: # Pare o programa pressionando Ctrl+C print(\\"Stream stopped\\") # Encerre o fluxo stream.stop_stream() stream.close() # Encerre a interface PortAudio p.terminate() \`\`\` Ao executar esse script em Python, ele começará a gravar o áudio do microfone e a reproduzi-lo pelas colunas em tempo real.

Se você precisar de funcionalidades adicionais ou quiser reduzir a latência para níveis mínimos, você pode precisar de uma configuração e hardware mais avançados, como uma interface de áudio profissional com suporte para ASIO (Audio Stream Input/Output) ou similar."},{"instruction":"qualquer som reproduzido pelas colunas e capturado novamente pelo microfone pode causar feedback (um som de assobio ou eco), porque é que isso acontece por exemplo quando um cantor está a cantar ao microfone isso não vai acontecer Qual é a diferença?","output":"O feedback acústico, ou microfonia, ocorre quando o som do alto-falante é captado novamente pelo microfone, amplificado e reproduzido repetidamente. Esse loop contínuo cria uma onda sonora que pode aumentar rapidamente em volume e frequência, resultando no som de assobio ou apito característico do feedback. Durante um show ao vivo, vários métodos são usados para minimizar ou prevenir o feedback: 1. **Posicionamento do microfone e dos alto-falantes:** Os microfones são posicionados de forma a não captarem diretamente o som dos alto-falantes. Geralmente, os alto-falantes de PA (Public Address - Sonorização Pública) estão direcionados para o público e estão fisicamente separados e orientados longe dos microfones do palco. 2. **Monitores de palco:** Muitas vezes, os cantores usam monitores de palco que apontam diretamente para eles, para que possam ouvir claramente a si mesmos e à mistura da banda sem que o som seja direcionado ao microfone. Em muitos casos, os monitores de retorno estão fora do \\"padrão polar\\" do microfone, o que significa que a maioria do som do monitor não entra diretamente no microfone. 3. **Microfones direcionais:** Os cantores geralmente usam microfones direcionais ou unidirecionais (como os microfones cardióides ou supercardióides) que captam o som principalmente de uma direção — a frente do microfone — e rejeitam o som de outras direções. 4. **Equalização e processamento de som:** Os engenheiros de som ajustam as frequências do sistema de som usando equalizadores para reduzir os níveis de determinadas frequências que são mais propensas ao feedback. Eles também podem usar processadores de dinâmica, como compressores e limitadores, para evitar picos súbitos que podem levar ao feedback. 5. **Uso de sistemas de monitoramento pessoal (in-ear):** Muitos artistas usam monitores pessoais, ou \\"in-ear monitors\\" (IEMs), que são fones de ouvido especiais que eliminam a necessidade de monitores de palco, reduzindo drasticamente o risco de feedback. 6. **Técnicas de performance:** Os artistas often stay a certa distância dos alto-falantes e monitoram seu uso do microfone, mantendo-o próximo quando estão cantando e afastando-o quando não, ou até mesmo usando a mão para cobrir a parte de trás do microfone e bloquear o som indesejado. Quando se trata de um ambiente doméstico ou de escritório, onde você pode estar tentando ouvir o som do microfone pelas colunas do computador, a proximidade dos dispositivos e a falta de equipamentos e técnicas profissionais de som aumentam a chance de feedback. Por isso, é mais difícil controlar o feedback nessas condições sem o equipamento apropriado e o ajuste fino disponível em um ambiente de performance ao vivo."},{"instruction":"Microfones direcionais: Os cantores geralmente usam microfones direcionais ou unidirecionais (como os microfones cardióides ou supercardióides) que captam o som principalmente de uma direção — a frente do microfone — e rejeitam o som de outras direções, Como é que sei se o meu microfone é um destes tipos?","output":"Para determinar se o seu microfone é direcional (também conhecido como unidirecional) e qual é o seu padrão polar (como cardióide, supercardióide ou hipercardióide), siga estes passos: 1. **Verifique o Manual do Usuário ou Especificações do Produto**: A maneira mais direta de identificar o padrão polar do seu microfone é verificar o manual do usuário que acompanha o produto ou buscar as especificações técnicas do microfone no site do fabricante. 2. **Olhe para Marcas ou Símbolos no Microfone**: Alguns microfones têm o padrão polar marcado no corpo do microfone ou perto da grade onde o som entra. Pode ser um ícone ou um texto que indica o padrão. 3. **Teste o Microfone**: Se você não tiver acesso às especificações e não houver nenhuma indicação visual no microfone, você pode fazer um teste simples: - Ligue o microfone e coloque-o na posição normal de uso. - Fale ou faça barulhos a uma intensidade constante e gire lentamente o microfone mantendo a boca na mesma posição. - Observe onde o som parece ser mais forte (a \\"frente\\" do microfone, onde ele é mais sensível) e onde o som fica mais fraco ou ausente (as \\"laterais\\" ou \\"costas\\" do microfone, onde ele rejeita o som). 4. **Identificação Visual**: Microfones cardióides normalmente possuem uma única cápsula dentro da grade e são usados para uma ampla variedade de propósitos. Microfones supercardióides ou hipercardióides, muitas vezes são mais alongados e tubulares, sugerindo a rejeição de som que vem de ângulos mais afilados em relação ao eixo do microfone. 5. **Peça Ajuda em uma Loja Especializada**: Se você ainda tiver dúvidas, leve o microfone a uma loja de música ou a um profissional de áudio e pergunte sobre o padrão polar do seu microfone. Padrões Polares Comuns de Microfones: - **Cardióide**: Capta o som principalmente da frente e é menos sensível aos lados e à parte de trás. O padrão de captação tem a forma de um coração, daí o nome \\"cardióide\\". - **Supercardióide**: Semelhante ao cardióide, mas com uma área de captação frontal mais estreita e uma pequena sensibilidade na parte de trás. - **Hipercardióide**: Ainda mais estreito que o supercardióide na captação frontal, com um pouco mais de captação na parte de trás. - **Omnidirecional**: Capta som igualmente de todas as direções, sem rejeitar o som de nenhum ângulo específico. - **Figura 8 ou Bidirecional**: Capta som da frente e da parte de trás do microfone, rejeitando os sons dos lados. Saber o padrão polar do seu microfone é útil para entender como ele se comportará em diferentes configurações e como você pode usá-lo para obter os melhores resultados ao gravar ou amplificar sons."},{"instruction":"Por exemplo, este microfone sabes me dizer se é unidirecional?

O Python pode ser utilizado para capturar o áudio do microfone em tempo real, mas a aplicação de efeitos em tempo real será complexa de executar somente com Python e FFmpeg, pois envolveria processamento de áudio em buffers, o que pode não ser ideal sem um software de processamento de áudio em tempo real especializado. Contudo, para fins de simplicidade, vou fornecer um exemplo de script que captura uma gravação de áudio do microfone e depois processa o arquivo gravado para alterar o pitch, criando um efeito de voz mais aguda (similar a uma voz feminina dependendo do ajuste) com o FFmpeg. Antes de mais nada, você precisa do FFmpeg instalado no seu sistema. Em seguida, você precisará de dois pacotes Python: \`pyaudio\` para gravação de áudio e \`ffmpeg-python\` como um wrapper para interagir com o FFmpeg. Garanta que você os tenha instalado: \`\`\`sh pip install pyaudio ffmpeg-python \`\`\` Agora, aqui está um exemplo de script que grava o áudio e depois processa o arquivo para alterar o pitch: \`\`\`python import pyaudio import wave import ffmpeg # Parâmetros de gravação CHUNK = 1024 FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16 CHANNELS = 1 RATE = 44100 RECORD_SECONDS = 5 WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME = \\"output.wav\\" p = pyaudio.PyAudio() # Iniciar gravação stream = p.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=RATE, input=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK) print(\\"* recording\\") frames = [] for i in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)): data = stream.read(CHUNK) frames.append(data) print(\\"* done recording\\") # Encerrar gravação stream.stop_stream() stream.close() p.terminate() # Salvar arquivo WAV wf = wave.open(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME, 'wb') wf.setnchannels(CHANNELS) wf.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(FORMAT)) wf.setframerate(RATE) wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames)) wf.close() # Aplicar efeito de pitch no arquivo WAV resultante input_file = WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME output_file = \\"output_pitched.wav\\" # Define o valor de pitch shifting.

O aumento do pitch é conseguido ajustando a taxa de amostragem do áudio e mantendo a mesma taxa de reprodução, o que resulta em uma voz mais aguda. Lembre-se que, para alterar o pitch e manter uma qualidade de áudio razoável, alguns experimentos com os valores podem ser necessários. O fator \`pitch_factor\` é um exemplo que você pode ajustar para atingir a alteração desejada no pitch da voz. Valores mais altos que 1 aumentam o pitch e fazem a voz soar mais aguda, enquanto valores menores que 1 diminuem o pitch e fazem a voz soar mais grave."},{"instruction":"Mas não era possível fazer isto tudo capturando a voz e aplicando o efeito e ao mesmo tempo passá-lo para a saída das colunas.

FFmpeg é uma ótima ferramenta para processamento de áudio e vídeo, mas não é ideal para processamento de áudio em tempo real, pois foi projetado principalmente para trabalhar com arquivos e streams completos, não com buffers de áudio em tempo real. Para processar áudio em tempo real em Python, você geralmente usaria uma biblioteca projetada para isso, como \`pyaudio\` para capturar e reproduzir áudio, junto com uma biblioteca de processamento de áudio como \`numpy\` para manipular os dados de áudio. Entretanto, para alterar o pitch em tempo real, você precisará de uma biblioteca de processamento de áudio que permita mudar o pitch sem alterar a velocidade de reprodução, o que é algo mais complexo do que a funcionalidade básica oferecida por \`numpy\`. Uma biblioteca que pode trabalhar em tempo real e oferece funcionalidades de mudança de pitch é \`SoundTouch\`. Porém, integrar \`SoundTouch\` com \`pyaudio\` requer uma certa experiência em processamento de áudio e programação de sistemas de tempo real. Aqui está um exemplo conceitual de como você poderia começar a estruturar isso em Python com \`pyaudio\` e \`numpy\`: \`\`\`python import pyaudio import numpy as np import wave # Assume que você tem uma função chamada shift_pitch que pode alterar o pitch de um buffer de áudio def shift_pitch(data, pitch_factor): # Esta função é onde ocorrerá a alteração de pitch # Você precisaria implementar ou utilizar uma biblioteca de terceiros para fazer isso return data # Configurando parâmetros CHUNK = 1024 FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16 CHANNELS = 1 RATE = 44100 # Inicializar interface PyAudio p = pyaudio.PyAudio() # Abrir stream de áudio (com streams de entrada e saída para microfone e colunas) stream = p.open(format=FORMAT, channels=CHANNELS, rate=RATE, input=True, output=True, frames_per_buffer=CHUNK) print(\\"Stream em tempo real com alteração de pitch.

Para aplicativos mais avançados de processamento de áudio, como mudança de pitch em tempo real, podem ser utilizadas ferramentas e ambientes de desenvolvimento especializados em áudio, como Max/MSP, Pure Data ou sistemas em C/C++ que implementam bibliotecas de processamento de áudio como PortAudio, SoundTouch ou Rubber Band.

No entanto, existem algumas soluções possíveis se você deseja usar a SoundTouch em um projeto Python: 1. **Criar suas próprias bindings**: Isto implica escrever um wrapper em torno da API da SoundTouch usando Cython ou um wrapper C/C++ para Python como o SWIG. Isso requer conhecimento de C++ e da API C do Python, e é um processo bastante avançado. 2. **Usar uma biblioteca Python existente que inclua a SoundTouch**: Alguns projetos de terceiros podem já ter feito o trabalho de criar bindings para você. Um exemplo seria \`pysox\`, que é um wrapper em torno da biblioteca \`sox\`, que por sua vez pode usar a SoundTouch.

Quando você escreve um wrapper para uma biblioteca, você tipicamente está fazendo o seguinte: 1. **Mapeamento de Tipos de Dados**: Converter tipos de dados entre as duas linguagens. Por exemplo, você pode precisar converter tipos de dados C++ como \`int\` ou \`float\` para seus equivalentes em Python. 2. **Chamadas de Funções**: Permitir que funções da biblioteca original sejam chamadas de dentro do Python.

Pressione Ctrl+C para parar.\\") # Mantém o stream rodando while True: time.sleep(0.1) \`\`\` Neste exemplo, \`shift_pitch\` é uma função de placeholder que simplesmente realiza uma operação de interpolação linear para simular uma mudança de pitch. Esta é apenas uma ilustração e não resultará num efeito de mudança de pitch realista. Para alcançar a mudança de pitch de uma maneira que preserve o timbre e a duração do áudio (conhecida como mudança de pitch sem mudança de tempo), seria necessário uma implementação mais sofisticada, possivelmente usando algoritmos como o time-domain pitch synchronous overlap add (TD-PSOLA) ou frequência-domain processing como a Transformada Rápida de Fourier (FFT).

Aqui está um exemplo simples que mostra como adicionar um eco (delay) na entrada do microfone: 1. Abra o Pure Data e crie um novo patch (Arquivo > Novo). 2. Crie um objeto para capturar áudio do microfone clicando no espaço em branco e digitando \`adc~\` ou colocando o objeto a partir do menu \\"Put\\" > \\"Object\\" e digitando \`adc~\` seguido por Enter. 3. Crie um objeto para delay clicando no espaço em branco e digitando \`delwrite~\` seguido por um nome exclusivo para o buffer de delay e o tempo máximo de delay em milissegundos, como \`delwrite~ mydelay 1000\`. 4. Crie um objeto para ler o delay clicando no espaço em branco e digitando \`vd~\` seguido pelo mesmo nome de buffer que você deu ao \`delwrite~\`, por exemplo, \`vd~ mydelay\`. 5. Crie um objeto de saída de áudio clicando no espaço em branco e digitando \`dac~\`. 6. Conecte a saída do \`adc~\` à entrada do \`delwrite~\`. 7. Conecte a saída do \`vd~\` à entrada do \`dac~\`. 8. Adicione um controle para o tempo de delay clicando no espaço em branco e digitando \`hslider\`, clique em \\"Propriedades\\" para definir o intervalo (por exemplo, 0 a 1000 ms), e conecte a saída do slider à entrada de controle do \`vd~\` usando um objeto \`pack 0\` e alguma matemática \`+~\` para obter o valor correto, pois \`vd~\` espera intervalos negativos. 9. Conecte a saída do \`adc~\` também diretamente ao \`dac~\` se quiser ouvir o som direto além do eco. 10. Ative o processamento de áudio clicando no botão \\"DSP\\" para ligar no canto superior direito da janela principal do Pd.

Se você apenas deseja transpor as frequências sem preocupação com formantes, outro método é usar o objeto \`tabread4~\` juntamente com um \`phasor~\` para realizar uma leitura de tabela em uma velocidade diferente do original, efetivamente mudando o pitch. Aqui está um exemplo simplificado usando o objeto \`tabread4~\` e \`phasor~\` para mudar o pitch, o que faz um \\"pitch shifting\\" bastante primário: 1. Abra o Pd e crie um novo patch. 2. Crie uma matriz (array) para armazenar um bloco de áudio para processamento. No menu, selecione \\"Put\\" > \\"Array\\" e dê um nome à matriz (por exemplo, \\"pitchArray\\"). 3. Defina o tamanho da matriz para o mesmo que o tamanho do bloco de áudio (normalmente 64, 128, 256, 512, etc.). Clique com o botão direito na matriz e selecione \\"Properties\\" para definir. 4. Crie um objeto \`adc~\` para capturar áudio do microfone. 5. Crie um objeto \`tabwrite~\` e dê a ele o nome da matriz que você criou. 6. Conecte a saída do \`adc~\` à entrada do \`tabwrite~\`. 7. Crie um objeto \`phasor~\` e um objeto \`tabread4~\`. Ligue o objeto \`phasor~\` ao objeto \`tabread4~\` e use o nome da matriz como um argumento do \`tabread4~\`. 8. Adicione um multiplicador (\`*~\`) entre o \`phasor~\` e \`tabread4~\` para controlar a velocidade de leitura (e, portanto, a mudança de pitch). 9. Crie um objeto \`dac~\` para enviar o áudio processado para as colunas. 10. Conecte a saída do \`tabread4~\` à entrada do \`dac~\`. Agora, ajustando o valor do multiplicador (\`*~\`), você pode mudar a velocidade com que o \`phasor~\` lê a matriz, resultando em uma mudança de pitch. Um fator de multiplicação maior que 1 aumentará o pitch e um fator menor que 1 diminuirá o pitch. Isso é um exemplo básico e existem maneiras mais sofisticadas de se fazer pitch shifting que preservam a qualidade do som e evitam artefatos indesejados. Muitas dessas técnicas avançadas podem não estar disponíveis diretamente no Pd ou podem exigir uma complexidade adicional ou uso de objetos externos de bibliotecas adicionais. Lembre-se que a mudança de pitch no exemplo fornecido será de uma forma primitiva e não será a mais limpa ou musical, pois é uma mudança de velocidade simples, que também afetará a velocidade de reprodução do som. Para um verdadeiro pitch shifting que preserva a duração original da amostra, você precisaria de uma implementação mais complexa, possivelmente usando bibliotecas externas ou objetos como \`g09.pitchshift~\` do GEM ou [helmholtz~], [sigmund~] e outros objetos de análise e síntese de Pd."},{"instruction":"Max/MSP: Max (originalmente conhecido como Max/MSP quando inclui o processamento de áudio), desenvolvido pela Cycling '74 (agora parte da Ableton), é um ambiente de programação visual que permite a músicos, artistas e desenvolvedores a criar software sem escrever linhas de código através de uma interface de “arrastar e soltar”.

Os usuários ligam objetos entre si com \\"patch cords\\" numa interface chamada \\"patcher\\" para definir o fluxo de dados e as operações de processamento. Max/MSP é composto por duas partes principais: 1. **Max:** o componente de processamento de dados e controle, que lida com tarefas não relacionadas ao áudio, como entrada/saída MIDI, processamento de mensagens, interface de usuário, lógica e controle de sequências, entre outros. 2. **MSP:** o conjunto de objetos de processamento de áudio em tempo real do Max, onde MSP é derivado de \\"Max Signal Processing\\". No MSP, você pode criar sintetizadores, efeitos de áudio, analisadores, e interfaces para várias formas de processamento de sinal em tempo real.

Aqui estão os passos detalhados para criar um patch básico de pitch shift no Max: 1. Abra o Max/MSP e crie um novo patcher indo em \\"File\\" > \\"New Patcher\\" ou usando o atalho \`Command+N\` no macOS ou \`Ctrl+N\` no Windows. 2. Arraste e solte um objeto \`adc~\` para o seu patcher. Este é o objeto que captura o áudio de sua entrada padrão, que normalmente seria o seu microfone. 3. Em seguida, adicione um objeto para o pitch shift. No Max/MSP, você pode usar o objeto \`gizmo~\` para mudar o pitch. Arraste e solte um objeto \`gizmo~\` para o seu patch. 4. Agora, conecte a saída do objeto \`adc~\` às entradas do objeto \`gizmo~\`. Como o \`adc~\` tem duas saídas para canais estéreo, certifique-se de conectar ambos os canais caso esteja processando áudio estéreo. 5. Para controlar o valor de pitch shift, crie um objeto \`float\`, que permitirá a entrada de um valor numérico que representará a quantidade de transposição em semitons. 6. Conecte a saída do objeto \`float\` à entrada de transposição do objeto \`gizmo~\`. 7. Finalmente, adicione um objeto \`dac~\` para enviar o áudio processado para suas saídas, que seriam as colunas ou fones de ouvido. 8. Conecte as saídas do objeto \`gizmo~\` às entradas do objeto \`dac~\`. 9. Clique no botão de modo de apresentação (modo de travamento) no canto superior direito do patcher no Max para sair do modo de edição e assim interagir com o seu patch. 10. Ajuste o valor no objeto \`float\` para alterar o pitch do áudio de entrada em tempo real. Valores positivos vão aumentar o pitch e valores negativos vão diminuir. O patch ficaria aproximadamente assim: \`\`\` [adc~] | | [gizmo~] | | [dac~] \`\`\` E diretamente abaixo do \`gizmo~\` você teria o objeto \`float\` para controlar a quantidade de transposição do pitch. Com esses objetos conectados, você tem um patch básico de pitch shift em tempo real. Inicie o processamento de áudio clicando no botão de áudio DSP no Max e manipule o valor do \`float\` para alterar o pitch do áudio que está passando do microfone para as colunas.

Escrevi mal aquilo que queria perguntar. e um exemplo no c++s conheces","output":"Se deseja criar um exemplo em C++ que capte áudio de um microfone, aplique um efeito de pitch shift e em seguida o reproduza nas colunas, é necessário usar algumas bibliotecas especializadas de processamento de áudio, pois o C++ não tem essa funcionalidade incorporada na sua biblioteca padrão. Um exemplo de bibliotecas que poderiam ser usadas para este propósito: - **PortAudio:** para captura e reprodução de áudio em tempo real. - **SoundTouch:** para processamento de áudio, como o pitch shifting. Vamos considerar que você já tem as bibliotecas instaladas e configuradas em seu sistema. Aqui está um esqueleto básico de como o código poderia ficar. Este código não será compilável ou executável como está, pois necessitaria de configurações adicionais e implementação detalhada das bibliotecas. \`\`\`cpp #include <portaudio.h> #include <SoundTouch.h> // Esta função será chamada pelo PortAudio quando precisar de dados para reprodução static int audioCallback( const void* inputBuffer, void* outputBuffer, unsigned long framesPerBuffer, const PaStreamCallbackTimeInfo* timeInfo, PaStreamCallbackFlags statusFlags, void* userData) { // Cast userData como um ponteiro para SoundTouch soundtouch::SoundTouch* pitchShifter = static_cast<soundtouch::SoundTouch*>(userData); // Cast input e output buffers para o tipo apropriado const float* in = static_cast<const float*>(inputBuffer); float* out = static_cast<float*>(outputBuffer); // Adicionar amostras ao processor SoundTouch pitchShifter->putSamples(in, framesPerBuffer); // Receber amostras processadas do SoundTouch int numSamples = pitchShifter->receiveSamples(out, framesPerBuffer); // ...

(aguardar ou fazer outras operações aqui) ... Pa_StopStream(stream); Pa_CloseStream(stream); Pa_Terminate(); return 0; } \`\`\` Este exemplo extremamente simplificado faz suposições sobre o ambiente de programação e não contém todo o gerenciamento de erros e recursos que seriam necessários em um programa de produção. O que é importante notar: - A captura de áudio é gerida pelo PortAudio, o qual chama a função callback fornecida com buffers de áudio para processamento. - O SoundTouch processa os buffers de áudio para fazer o pitch shifting. - A implementação exata do processamento de buffer no callback envolverá enviando os dados para o SoundTouch e, em seguida, passando os resultados para o buffer de saída. - A maneira como você implementa o gerenciamento do fluxo de áudio entre a captura e a reprodução (e especialmente, gerenciamento de underflow ou overflow de buffers) será crucial para o desempenho da aplicação em tempo real. Para um exemplo real e funcional, seria necessário verificar a documentação do PortAudio e do SoundTouch para entender melhor como interagir com as respetivas APIs. No entanto, espero que este exemplo forneça uma visão geral de alto nível sobre como essas peças se encaixam em um projeto C++."},{"instruction":"bibliotecas instaladas e configuradas em seu sistema #include <portaudio.h> #include <SoundTouch.h> É difícil fazer isso no ambiente Eclipse.","output":"Configurar bibliotecas de terceiros no Eclipse para projetos C++ pode ser um processo detalhado, especialmente se você estiver trabalhando com bibliotecas que exigem diferentes dependências e configurações de compilação. Vou guiá-lo pelos passos gerais de como configurar o Eclipse para usar as bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch. Antes de começar, certifique-se de ter o Eclipse CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling) instalado, além do compilador C++ e das bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch instaladas em seu sistema. # Baixar e Instalar o PortAudio e o SoundTouch: 1. **PortAudio:** Você pode baixar a versão mais recente do PortAudio do [site oficial](http://www.portaudio.com/download.html).

Além disso, o SoundTouch fornece um arquivo de projeto para o Autotools que você pode usar para configurar e compilar a biblioteca em Linux e Unix. Em um sistema Windows, você pode optar por usar o projeto pré-configurado no Visual Studio fornecido. # Configurando o Eclipse: 3. **Criar um Projeto C++ no Eclipse:** - Abra o Eclipse e crie um novo projeto C++. 4. **Adicionar Include Paths:** - Clique com o botão direito no seu projeto C++ no Eclipse. - Vá em \\"Properties\\" > \\"C/C++ General\\" > \\"Paths and Symbols\\". - Na aba \\"Includes\\", clique em \\"Add...\\" para adicionar os diretórios que contêm os arquivos de cabeçalho das bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch. - Isso normalmente seria \`include\` dentro do diretório de instalação das bibliotecas. 5. **Adicionar Bibliotecas:** - Na mesma janela de \\"Properties\\", vá para \\"C/C++ Build\\" > \\"Settings\\". - Sob a seção de \\"Linker\\", procure \\"Libraries\\" e adicione as bibliotecas compiladas do PortAudio e do SoundTouch. Você geralmente precisa adicionar os nomes das bibliotecas sem o prefixo 'lib' e o sufixo '.so', '.dll' ou '.dylib', dependendo do seu sistema. - Também adicione os caminhos para as bibliotecas compiladas se não estiverem no caminho padrão de busca do compilador/linker. 6. **Copiar as DLLs ou SOs (se estiver em Windows ou Linux):** - Se você estiver em um sistema Windows, pode ser necessário copiar os arquivos DLL das bibliotecas no diretório do executável ou em algum lugar no PATH. - No Linux, os arquivos SO devem ser acessíveis pelo loader, que normalmente significa ter eles instalados nos diretórios padrão como \`/usr/lib\` ou ter o seu diretório incluído no \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\`. 7. **Reiniciar o Eclipse e Tentar Compilar:** - Após fazer todas as configurações, o Eclipse pode precisar de um reinício para reconhecer as alterações corretamente. - Tente compilar o seu projeto para verificar se as bibliotecas estão corretamente configuradas. Cada sistema operacional tem suas peculiaridades em relação à localização das bibliotecas e arquivos de cabeçalho, sistemas de compilação e o processo exato para configurar essas dependências. O importante é garantir que o compilador e o linker tenham acesso aos arquivos de cabeçalho corretos e as bibliotecas compiladas. Se você encontrar problemas, geralmente ajuda verificar a saída do console para quaisquer mensagens de erro, e então refinar as configurações do projecto com base nessas informações."},{"instruction":"é possível pôr-se isto a funcionar no Visual Studio Code?

Here are a few notable examples: 1. Phoenicia: The Phoenician city-states, located in present-day Lebanon and coastal Syria, were major seafaring powers during this period. Phoenician sailors and traders covered vast distances across the Mediterranean, establishing colonies and trade networks throughout the region. Their maritime expertise made them dominant players in Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange. 2. Sea Peoples: The Sea Peoples were a group of various tribes and seafaring nations that emerged in the eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age. They are believed to have caused significant disruptions and migrations, as well as engaging in piracy and raiding activities. While their origins and exact identities are still debated, they were a notable seafaring presence during this time. 3. Mycenaean Greece: The Mycenaean civilization, centered in ancient Greece, was known for its maritime activities during the Late Bronze Age. Mycenaean seafarers conducted trade throughout the Mediterranean, particularly with the Minoans of Crete and other eastern Mediterranean civilizations. Their naval prowess is depicted in the Homeric epics, such as the Iliad and the Odyssey. 4. Hittite Empire: The Hittite Empire, based in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), also had access to the Mediterranean Sea through various port cities, such as Alalakh and Ugarit. While the Hittites were primarily a land-based empire, they had a navy and engaged in maritime trade, particularly with the city-states of Cyprus. These are just a few examples of the seafaring kingdoms and powers that existed during this period. There were other smaller maritime powers and trading networks in the region that played significant roles in Mediterranean trade and influence."},{"instruction":"Would any of them had had easy access with little to no opposition to the Nile River and/or the Red Sea?","output":"Yes, some of the seafaring powers during that time had relatively easy access to the Nile River and the Red Sea, while others faced varying degrees of opposition. Here are a few examples: 1. Phoenicia: Phoenician city-states, such as Tyre and Sidon, had relatively easy access to both the Nile River and the Red Sea. They established trade networks and colonies along the coast of the Levant, including in present-day Lebanon, Israel, and Syria. Phoenician ships could navigate the Mediterranean and reach the Nile Delta, allowing them to engage in trade with Egypt. They also had access to the Red Sea through their colonies in modern-day Lebanon, which facilitated trade with the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. 2. Sea Peoples: The Sea Peoples, being a loosely affiliated group of seafaring tribes and nations, had the potential to access the Nile River and the Red Sea. However, their activities were often marked by conflict and disruption. While some Sea Peoples may have engaged in trade or raiding along the Egyptian coast, their presence was more associated with military incursions and migrations rather than peaceful trade. 3. Hittite Empire: The Hittite Empire, based in Anatolia, did not have direct access to the Nile River or the Red Sea. However, they had control over several port cities along the eastern Mediterranean coast, such as Alalakh and Ugarit. These ports allowed them to engage in maritime trade and potentially establish connections with Egypt and other civilizations in the region. It's important to note that while these powers had access to the Nile River and the Red Sea, the extent of their influence and the ease of their access varied. Factors such as political alliances, trade agreements, and the presence of rival powers could impact their ability to navigate these waterways without opposition."},{"instruction":"Did the ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and any of its neighboring kingdoms and countries, ever have any sort of naval force or seafaring culture?","output":"The ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as well as their neighboring kingdoms and countries, did not have a significant naval force or seafaring culture compared to other maritime powers of the time. The region of ancient Israel and Judah was primarily focused on agriculture and land-based activities. However, there is some evidence to suggest that these kingdoms did have limited maritime activities and access to the sea. The kingdom of Israel, for example, had a coastline along the Mediterranean Sea, which allowed for some interaction with maritime trade networks. The port city of Jaffa (modern-day Tel Aviv) was an important coastal city during this period and likely facilitated some maritime trade. Additionally, the kingdom of Israel had contact with the Phoenician city-states, which were renowned for their seafaring abilities. The Phoenicians, who were neighbors and trading partners of Israel and Judah, would have influenced the region's maritime activities to some extent. However, it is important to note that the biblical accounts and historical records do not provide extensive information about a naval force or seafaring culture specifically associated with Israel and Judah. The focus of these kingdoms was primarily on land-based activities, agriculture, and conflicts with neighboring powers."},{"instruction":"olá","output":"Olá! Como posso ajudar você hoje?"},{"instruction":"Isto foi interrompido, estávamos a falar.: Sim, é possível configurar o Visual Studio Code (VS Code) para trabalhar com C++ e bibliotecas como PortAudio e SoundTouch. O VS Code é um editor de código-fonte poderoso e leve que pode ser configurado com uma variedade de extensões e ferramentas para atender a várias necessidades de desenvolvimento. Embora o VS Code não seja uma IDE completa como o Eclipse ou o Visual Studio, você pode agregar funcionalidades semelhantes através de extensões. Aqui estão os passos gerais para configurar o VS Code para um projeto C++ que utiliza as bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch: # Pré-requisitos: 1. Instale o VS Code se ainda não o tiver feito. 2. Instale o compilador C++ e as ferramentas de build para a sua plataforma (por exemplo, GCC para Linux/Mac, MSVC para Windows). 3. Assegure-se de que as bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch estão instaladas e disponíveis em seu sistema (compiladas e prontas para usar). # Configurando o VS Code: 4. Instalar a Extensão C/C++: - No VS Code, instale a extensão C/C++ fornecida pela Microsoft, que oferece recursos como IntelliSense, debugging, etc. 5. Abrir Pasta do Projeto: - No VS Code, abra a pasta onde está o seu código-fonte C++ utilizando “File” > “Open Folder…”. 6. Configurações de Compilação: - Crie um arquivo tasks.json dentro da pasta .vscode do diretório do seu projeto ou abra as configurações de compilação a partir de “Terminal” > “Configure Default Build Task…”. Aqui você pode especificar o comando de compilação, flags do compilador, diretórios de includes e bibliotecas. - Exemplo para GCC no Linux/Mac: { “tasks”: [ { “type”: “shell”, “label”: “g++ build active file”, “command”: “/usr/bin/g++”, “args”: [ “-g”, “{file}”, “-o”, Podes continuar?","output":"Claro!

Configurações de Depuração: - Crie um arquivo launch.json na mesma pasta \`.vscode\` para configurar a depuração. No VS Code, você pode abrir o painel de depuração e clicar em \\"create a launch.json file\\", então escolha C++ (GDB/LLDB). - No arquivo \`launch.json\`, especifique o executável a ser depurado e outras configurações de depuração, se necessário. 8. Incluir Intellisense: - Caso o Intellisense não reconheça automaticamente as bibliotecas, você pode precisar configurar o arquivo \`c_cpp_properties.json\` para incluir os caminhos de include das bibliotecas que você está usando. Ao realizar essas configurações, você poderá construir e depurar projetos C++ no VS Code que utilizem PortAudio e SoundTouch. Lembre-se que os caminhos exatos para as bibliotecas e arquivos de include dependerão de como e onde você instalou as bibliotecas no seu sistema. Você também precisará assegurar-se de que os nomes das bibliotecas estão corretos e correspondem àqueles instalados no seu sistema. Tenha em mente que essas instruções são bastante genéricas; você pode precisar ajustar algumas configurações baseadas em seu sistema operacional e configuração específica do seu projeto."},{"instruction":"Write a fully detailed story with dialogue about a guy with a sexist friend inviting them over to a party. The guy introduces his friend to his two brothers. The party goes well, and the friend leaves. After he is gone, the ‘brothers’ sigh hard. One of them calls him a creep, in a female voice, before peeling off his face, revealing a woman. The other ‘brother’ agrees, before peeling his face off, revealing another woman. The guy apologised to them, for his Behaviour, and for having to wear the male masks, saying his friend couldn’t know he actually had sisters.","output":"Title: The Masquerade of Tolerance Jason had always been the bridge between the worlds he loved and the world he tolerated. His friend Mark, on the other hand, could never quite understand the balance that Jason struck - especially since Mark had views that were, at best, considered archaic. Nonetheless, they had been friends since childhood, long before Mark's sexist views had become apparent. Jason had learned to cope with Mark's behavior, often with an inward cringe, but he never quite felt comfortable enough to confront him about it. On a sunny Saturday afternoon, Jason was hosting a party at his family's home. It was a casual affair, a gathering of neighbors and friends to enjoy the warm weather and good food. Jason had cautiously extended an invitation to Mark, knowing that his presence could ruffle feathers, especially those of his siblings. \\"Hey Mark! Great to see you, man!\\" greeted Jason, clasping hands with his friend at the door. \\"Come on in. I want you to meet my brothers.\\" Mark grinned and followed Jason inside. \\"Brothers, huh? I thought you only had sis—\\" Jason hastily interjected, \\"Yeah, yeah, they've been away. Just got back.\\" Inside, they walked into the sunlit living room where two young men, Adam and Michael, stood. They looked slightly uncomfortable in their button-up shirts and jeans, a stark contrast to the easy-going atmosphere of the party. \\"Mark, this is Adam and Michael,\\" Jason introduced. Mark stepped forward, his handshake firm. \\"Pleasure to meet you guys. Jason's always talking about how great his brothers are at sports.\\" The two exchanged a brief, knowing glance before smiling. \\"Thanks, man. We try to keep up,\\" Adam responded in a slightly strained tone, as if suppressing laughter. The party unfolded pleasantly enough, with food, drinks, and laughter. Mark, however, couldn't keep his outdated mindset at bay, frequently commenting on the women at the party and how they were \\"naturally\\" less inclined to understand the complexities of the football game playing on TV. \\"Women just don't get the strategy, you know? It's all about physical strength and tactics,\\" Mark spouted confidently. The brothers simply nodded, offering non-committal grunts in agreement. The sun had long set and the party dwindled to a close when Mark, having had his fill of beer and bravado, decided to call it a night. Jason walked him to the door, thinking about the charade he had pulled off. \\"Thanks for the invite, bro. Your brothers are cool. Let's do this again sometime,\\" Mark slurred slightly. \\"Of course, Mark. Take care,\\" Jason said, waving him goodbye. Once Mark was out of sight, Jason shut the door, and the remaining guests, Adam and Michael, let out exasperated sighs. Their relief was palpable. \\"That guy is such a creep,\\" Adam said, his voice changing to a higher, distinctly female tone. \\"Tell me about it,\\" Michael agreed, his voice following suit. \\"I can't believe we pulled that off.\\" The brothers began to peel off their prosthetic face masks, revealing the familiar, frustrated faces of Jade and Michelle, Jason's sisters. \\"I'm so sorry,\\" Jason began, his face a mixture of remorse and gratitude. \\"I should have never asked you to wear those masks. But you know how Mark is. He just wouldn't understand that my most impressive family members are my sisters.\\" Jade shook her head, wiping away the thin layer of sweat that had formed beneath the silicone mask. \\"It's not your fault that your old friend is a misogynist, but Jason, I don't know how much longer we can endorse this behavior by hiding who we are.\\" Michelle nodded. \\"Yeah, if he can't accept the real us, maybe it's time to rethink that friendship.\\" Jason's eyes met theirs, filled with a complex mix of guilt and recognition. \\"I know,\\" he sighed. \\"I've been making excuses for him for too long. You've both been incredible tonight, and every other day. I promise, no more masks. It's time Mark met the amazing women in my life.\\" His sisters smiled, a mixture of relief and love in their eyes. They nodded, ready to finally bring the truth to light, regardless of how it might rattle the narrow worldviews of those like Mark. The night of the party had come to a close, but a new dawn awaited the siblings, one where honesty and pride in themselves would lead the way."},{"instruction":"Write a sequel, in which Jade and Michelle, as Adam and Micheal, challenge Mark to a game of football.

Tired of letting Mark's sexist views slide, the siblings had cooked up a plan – one that would challenge not only Mark's physical prowess but also his beliefs. \\"Hey, Mark,\\" Jason began during one of their usual meetups. \\"My brothers were thinking about challenging you to a game of football this weekend. You up for it?\\" Mark chuckled, a smug grin spreading across his face, \\"Pfft, bring it on. Girls can't play football, but I've seen what your brothers can do. Should be fun to show them how it's done.\\" \\"Great, let's set it up!\\" Jason replied, hiding a wry smile. The day of the \\"big game\\" arrived. The sun beat down on the makeshift field in Jason's backyard. Jade and Michelle, once again donning their male personas, Adam and Michael, warmed up, tossing the football between them with practiced ease. Mark sauntered onto the field, decked out in sports gear, brimming with confidence. \\"Hope you're ready to lose,\\" he joked, eyeing what he believed to be his male competitors. The game commenced, and much to Mark's surprise, \\"Adam\\" and \\"Michael\\" were formidable opponents. Their throws were accurate, their catches were graceful, and their strategies were well-executed. The sisters knew the game inside and out, and they played with a synchronicity that left Mark scrambling to keep up. After a series of impressive plays, Mark found himself panting and sweating, with the score tilted not in his favor. As the game wrapped up, Mark had to admit defeat. He congratulated Adam and Michael with hearty handshakes. \\"You guys are good,\\" he conceded with a genuine respect he'd seldom shown before. \\"Thanks, man,\\" Jade, as Adam, smiled before pretending to scratch her nose to cover her face. In her real voice, she whispered just loud enough for her siblings to hear, \\"We sure showed him.\\" Mark's head whipped around, his eyes searching for the source of the feminine voice. \\"Who said that?\\" Michelle, still as Michael, shrugged and replied in a deepened voice, \\"Don't know what you're talking about, dude.\\" Both \\"brothers\\" regained Mark's attention, shifting from their modified male voices to their natural female tones, the pitch rising slowly but deliberately. The realization dawned on Mark's face, his eyes widening in disbelief as they echoed the truths he'd denied for so long. Jade and Michelle reached up to their faces and began to peel away the silicone masks, revealing the determined faces beneath. They tossed the masks at Mark's feet, a symbolic gesture that no longer would they hide their true selves for the comfort of another's ignorance. Jade flipped her hair, a smirk on her lips, \\"Game over, Mark.\\" Michelle followed suit, her eyes locked with Mark's, \\"Maybe next time, you'll think twice before underestimating women.\\" Mark stood frozen, his mind racing to comprehend the depth of his misconception. The world as he knew it had been flipped on its head by the very people he'd unwittingly underestimated—and respected—minutes before. Jason stepped forward, standing with his sisters in solidarity. \\"We're done pretending, Mark. It's time you see the truth and, hopefully, learn from it.\\" The sisters walked away with a newfound freedom, their strides confident and proud. Mark was left to contemplate the reality before him, one where gender did not dictate talent or capability, and where two women had just taught him a lesson he wouldn't soon forget."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but extra detail on the unmaskings, and how exactly Hp they beat him.","output":"Title: The Revelatory Match The plot was set, a cunning plan devised by Jade and Michelle in collusion with their brother Jason. Their goal was clear: to expose the fallacies of Mark's sexist viewpoint in the most incontrovertible way possible—through a game of football. It was to be a match that would not only test Mark's athletic skills but also the very foundations of his beliefs about women in sports. In preparation, Jade and Michelle practiced extensively, brushing up on plays, honing their agility, and perfecting their team dynamics. They dedicated themselves to becoming Adam and Michael, not only in appearance but in demeanor and movement. Their sibling Jason had seen them in countless matches and knew that Mark was in for a surprise. Come the weekend, the faux turf of Jason's backyard was the battleground for the challenge. Dressed in sports gear that matched their masculine guises, Jade and Michelle, or \\"Adam\\" and \\"Michael,\\" were the epitome of concentration and athletic readiness. Mark swaggered onto the makeshift pitch, clad in his own gear, exuding a confidence that seemed unshakeable. He greeted his challengers with a smirk, never anticipating that his preconceived notions were about to be dismantled. The game kicked off with Mark's arrogance converting into forced plays. He tried to outpace and outmaneuver, but the tide of the match was against him. With precise throws, clever feints, and interceptions, the disguised sisters dismantled Mark's defense one play at a time. Jade, as Adam, darted across the field with ease, intercepting a pass meant for Mark and sprinting past him for a touchdown. Meanwhile, Michelle, in the Michael persona, showcased her arm strength with a spiral throw that flew right past Mark's outstretched hands. On the sidelines, Jason watched with bated breath, impressed by his sisters' skillful emulation of his fondly fabricated brothers. The look of disbelief and the dawning respect on Mark's face were not to be missed as he realized he was being bested by players he thought were inferior. As the final whistle blew, Mark shook hands with his opponents, panting and sweating more than he would care to admit. Overwhelmed by their performance, he praised \\"Adam\\" and \\"Michael.\\" \\"You guys are good,\\" he admitted, a shadow of surprise in his voice. Jade took the opportunity to provoke the big reveal. Shielding herself under the pretense of scratching her nose, she slipped into her natural voice and said, \\"Couldn't have done it without my teammate.\\" Mark's head spun around, a puzzled frown creasing his face. \\"Who said that?\\" he asked, bewildered, scanning the vicinity for the mystery woman's voice. \\"Strategy, not strength, wins the game,\\" Michelle responded in her deepened tone, deflecting his suspicion while suppressing a knowing smile. Then, under the guise of wiping sweat from their brows, Jade and Michelle began to peel away the edges of their masterfully applied prosthetics. First, the skin around their jaws slackened, revealing the softer lines of their actual features beneath. Slowly but deliberately, they continued to pull at the realistic masks, the high-tech adhesive giving way until the disguises detached from their foreheads. The sisters stood before a stunned Mark, the guise of Adam and Michael falling away to reveal Jade and Michelle's true faces—determined, triumphant, proud. They dropped the facades at Mark's feet. The discarded masks lay there, symbols of a subterfuge made necessary by narrow-mindedness. Hair was flicked back, their feminine features now unobstructed, as they delivered the final blow to Mark's outdated perceptions. \\"Game over, Mark,\\" Jade declared with a mix of cheek and challenge in her voice. \\"Remember this the next time you think women can't play,\\" Michelle added, her eyes holding Mark's in a lesson he could not escape. Mark was silent, his mind reeling from the revelation before him. With the unmasking came an understanding that perhaps he had more to learn about not only football but the potential of those he had so casually dismissed because of their gender. Jason stepped forward alongside his sisters, now unmasked and unburdened. \\"We no longer play by your rules, Mark. It's time to change the game.\\" The sisters turned and walked off the field, leaving their effigies behind. For Mark, there was no looking back from this moment of pure, enlightening defeat."},{"instruction":"convierte estos textos con otras palabras agregando otras :\\"• Proyectos de investigación, desarrollo tecnológico, innovación o de investigación-creación • Publicación de resultados de investigaciones: artículos en revistas, comunicaciones en encuentros científicos y tecnológicos, producción de libros o partes de ellos, y similares • Registro y protección de la propiedad intelectual y derechos de autor • Promoción de la investigación entre los estudiantes de las especialidades de los grupos, que pueda dar lugar a informes de investigación o tesis de pregrado y posgrado • Organización de encuentros relacionados con las líneas de investigación del grupo (conferencias, congresos, seminarios, talleres, entre otros.) y que estén abiertos a la participación nacional e internacional continuación, presentamos los nuevos grupos de investigación reconocidos por el VRI. \\"","output":"Iniciativas en exploración científica, avance tecnológico, innovaciones o investigación-creativa.

O VS Code é um editor de código-fonte poderoso e leve que pode ser configurado com uma variedade de extensões e ferramentas para atender a várias necessidades de desenvolvimento. Embora o VS Code não seja uma IDE completa como o Eclipse ou o Visual Studio, você pode agregar funcionalidades semelhantes através de extensões. Aqui estão os passos gerais para configurar o VS Code para um projeto C++ que utiliza as bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch: # Pré-requisitos: 1. Instale o VS Code se ainda não o tiver feito. 2. Instale o compilador C++ e as ferramentas de build para a sua plataforma (por exemplo, GCC para Linux/Mac, MSVC para Windows). 3. Assegure-se de que as bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch estão instaladas e disponíveis em seu sistema (compiladas e prontas para usar). # Configurando o VS Code: 4. Instalar a Extensão C/C++: - No VS Code, instale a extensão C/C++ fornecida pela Microsoft, que oferece recursos como IntelliSense, debugging, etc. 5. Abrir Pasta do Projeto: - No VS Code, abra a pasta onde está o seu código-fonte C++ utilizando “File” > “Open Folder…”. 6. Configurações de Compilação: - Crie um arquivo tasks.json dentro da pasta .vscode do diretório do seu projeto ou abra as configurações de compilação a partir de “Terminal” > “Configure Default Build Task…”. Aqui você pode especificar o comando de compilação, flags do compilador, diretórios de includes e bibliotecas. - Exemplo para GCC no Linux/Mac: { “tasks”: [ { “type”: “shell”, “label”: “g++ build active file”, “command”: “/usr/bin/g++”, “args”: [ “-g”, “{file}”, “-o”, Podes continuar?","output":"\\"{fileDirname}/{fileBasenameNoExtension}\\", \\"-std=c++17\\", // Especifica a versão do C++ \\"-I\\", // Especifica o caminho do diretório include \\"caminho/para/include/portaudio\\", \\"-I\\", \\"caminho/para/include/soundtouch\\", \\"-L\\", // Especifica o caminho do diretório de lib \\"caminho/para/lib/portaudio\\", \\"-L\\", \\"caminho/para/lib/soundtouch\\", \\"-lportaudio\\", // Linka com a biblioteca PortAudio \\"-lsoundtouch\\", // Linka com a biblioteca SoundTouch \\"-lpthread\\", // Se necessário para PortAudio \\"-lasound\\", // Em Linux, se necessário para PortAudio \\"-ljack\\", // Em Linux, se necessário para PortAudio ], \\"group\\": { \\"label\\": \\"build\\", \\"kind\\": \\"build\\", \\"isDefault\\": true } } ], \\"version\\": \\"2.0.0\\" } 7. Configurações de Debug: - Crie um arquivo launch.json dentro da pasta .vscode para configurar o debugging no seu projeto. Especifique o caminho do executável, os argumentos para o programa, se necessário, e outras configurações relevantes para o debugger. 8. Configurações do IntelliSense: - A extensão C/C++ solicitará para configurar o IntelliSense se o arquivo c_cpp_properties.json ainda não existir. Este arquivo é onde você define os caminhos de include e as definições de pré-processador específicas para a sua aplicação. 9. Escreva seu código: - Agora você pode escrever seu código-fonte C++ e incluir os headers das bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch conforme necessário. 10. Compilação: - Para compilar seu projeto, você pode pressionar Ctrl+Shift+B para executar a tarefa de build que você definiu nas configurações de compilação. 11. Debugging: - Com o lançamento configurado no launch.json, você pode iniciar uma sessão de debug pressionando F5, permitindo que você coloque breakpoints e inspecione variáveis durante a execução do seu código. 12. Terminal Integrado: - O VS Code também possui um terminal integrado que você pode usar para executar o seu aplicativo manualmente, instalar pacotes adicionais ou realizar quaisquer tarefas de script que o seu projeto possa necessitar. 13. Dicas: - Se houver problemas com os caminhos ou configurações, verifique o console de saída para mensagens de erro que podem ajudar a diagnosticar o problema. - Familiarize-se com a documentação oficial do VS Code e das bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch para mais detalhes sobre configuração e opções de build. Com essas etapas, você deve ser capaz de configurar um ambiente de desenvolvimento no VS Code para trabalhar com C++, PortAudio e SoundTouch. É importante personalizar as configurações de acordo com o seu ambiente específico e sistemas de bibliotecas."},{"instruction":"2. Instale o compilador C++ e as ferramentas de build para a sua plataforma MSVC para Windows","output":"Para instalar o compilador C++ do Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC) e as ferramentas de construção no Windows, você seguirá estas etapas: # 1. Instalar o Visual Studio Embora você possa usar o VS Code como seu editor, você ainda vai precisar instalar o Visual Studio (não o VS Code) para obter o MSVC. Você pode baixar o instalador do Visual Studio da seguinte página: [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) # 2. Selecione as cargas de trabalho necessárias Durante a instalação, você terá que escolher as cargas de trabalho necessárias. Para desenvolvimento em C++, selecione \\"Desenvolvimento para desktop com C++\\". Esta opção irá instalar o compilador MSVC, o Windows SDK, e outras ferramentas necessárias para o desenvolvimento de aplicações de desktop em C++. # 3. Personalizar instalação (opcional) Opcionalmente, você pode selecionar componentes individuais para instalar, como as versões específicas do Windows SDK ou ferramentas de linha de comando do MSVC. # 4. Instalação Conclua a instalação e certifique-se de que o MSVC esteja instalado corretamente. # 5. Configurar o PATH (opcional) Normalmente, o instalador do Visual Studio configura automaticamente as variáveis de ambiente necessárias, mas se necessário, você pode adicionar manualmente o caminho dos executáveis do MSVC ao PATH do sistema para acessá-lo facilmente a partir da linha de comando. # 6. Verificar instalação Você pode verificar a instalação do MSVC abrindo um \\"Prompt de Comando do Desenvolvedor para VS 2019\\" (ou a versão correspondente do seu Visual Studio) do menu Iniciar e digitar o seguinte para verificar a versão do compilador: \`\`\`cmd cl \`\`\` O comando deve mostrar a versão do compilador C++ da Microsoft. # 7. Usar com o VS Code Finalmente, uma vez que o MSVC está instalado, você pode utilizar o VS Code para editar seus arquivos de código-fonte. Ao preparar o seu arquivo \`tasks.json\` no VS Code, você precisará configurar os caminhos e comandos para usar o compilador MSVC (\`cl.exe\`). Certifique-se de que o VS Code e suas extensões estejam configuradas corretamente para apontar para as ferramentas do Visual Studio. A extensão C/C++ do VS Code pode ajudar a detectar suas configurações do compilador e configurar o IntelliSense automaticamente."},{"instruction":"Assegure-se de que as bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch estão instaladas e disponíveis em seu sistema (compiladas e prontas para usar).","output":"Para assegurar que as bibliotecas PortAudio e SoundTouch estão instaladas e disponíveis em seu sistema Windows, siga os passos abaixo: # Instalando e Compilando PortAudio: 1. Baixe o código-fonte de PortAudio: Você pode obter o código-fonte de PortAudio a partir do repositório oficial em [http://www.portaudio.com/download.html](http://www.portaudio.com/download.html). 2. Descompacte o código-fonte em um diretório no seu computador. 3. Compile a biblioteca: - Você pode compilar PortAudio usando o Visual Studio. Para isso, abra o arquivo de projeto (\`.sln\`) que se encontra no diretório do PortAudio usando o Visual Studio. - Selecione a configuração desejada (Debug ou Release) e a arquitetura (x86 ou x64) no Visual Studio. - Compile a solução. Isto irá gerar a biblioteca \`portaudio.lib\` e, possivelmente, \`portaudio.dll\`. 4. Após a compilação bem-sucedida, lembre-se de onde o \`portaudio.lib\` e o \`portaudio.dll\` estão localizados, já que você precisará desses caminhos para configurar o VS Code. # Instalando e Compilando SoundTouch: 1. Baixe o código-fonte de SoundTouch: O código-fonte de SoundTouch pode ser obtido a partir do repositório oficial em [https://gitlab.com/soundtouch/soundtouch](https://gitlab.com/soundtouch/soundtouch). 2. Descompacte o código-fonte em um diretório em seu computador. 3. Compile a biblioteca: - Abra o arquivo de solução/Makefile correspondente com o Visual Studio ou outra ferramenta de compilação suportada. - Siga as instruções fornecidas no \`README\` ou na documentação oficial para compilar a biblioteca. - Após a compilação bem-sucedida, anote a localização do arquivo \`soundtouch.lib\` e dos binários correspondentes. # Configurando o Visual Studio Code: 1. **Include Paths**: Adicione os caminhos dos diretórios de cabeçalho (headers) onde os arquivos \`.h\` ou \`.hpp\` de PortAudio e SoundTouch estão localizados ao seu arquivo \`c_cpp_properties.json\` do VS Code. 2. **Library Paths**: No arquivo \`tasks.json\`, especifique os diretórios onde os arquivos \`.lib\` de PortAudio e SoundTouch estão localizados. Eles serão utilizados pelo linker durante a fase de construção. 3. **Linker Input**: Ainda no arquivo \`tasks.json\`, adicione os nomes das bibliotecas (como \`portaudio.lib\` e \`soundtouch.lib\`) nas configurações de linker para que seu projeto possa linká-las durante a construção do executável. 4. **Runtime DLLs**: Se sua aplicação requer DLLs em tempo de execução (para bibliotecas dinâmicas), certifique-se de que elas estejam disponíveis no PATH do sistema ou na mesma pasta do seu executável. É importante observar que a documentação oficial e exemplos fornecidos pelas bibliotecas podem ser extremamente úteis para orientá-lo através do processo de compilação e instalação. Em caso de erros durante a compilação ou linkagem, consulte a documentação e verifique as mensagens de erro para identificar o problema."},{"instruction":"Их движения стали согласованными и страстными, одновременно воплощая любовь, страсть и желание.

Eğitimin Konusu Olarak Çocukluk ve Çocuklar Aristokrasi ve Çocuk: Küçük Hayvanlar Ortaçağ'ın feodal toplumunda en şanslı çocuklar aristokrat çocuklarıdır. Aslında bu çocukların bütün şansları feodal toplumun diğer tabaklarına oranla onların ayrıcalıklı bir tabakada yer almalarıyla sınırlıdır. Yani köylü ve serf ailelerde yer almamaları onların şansı olarak düşünülür. Oysa yakın tahlilde bu görece şanslılığın mutluluğa ve mutlu çocukluğa yol açmadığı görülür. Her şeyden önce aristokrat ailelerde esas olan aristokrasinin yani soylulu- ğun devamıdır. Bu yüzden daha başlangıçta erkek çocuklar lehine bir cinsiyet ayırımı ortaya çıkmaktadır. Çocuklar dünyaya geldikleri andan itibaren hizmet- çilerin ellerindeydi. Çocuk bakımının aristokrat bir kadının soyluluğuna (asale- tine) yakışmadığı düşünülmekteydi. Çocuklar sevgi ve duygulanma nesneleri olarak değil \\"küçük hayvanlar\\" olarak düşünülüyor ve kabul ediliyordu. Soylu çocuklar dadıları tarafından emziriliyordu. Her koşulda çocuklar ilk bağlılıkla- rını aile dışındaki birisiyle kuruyorlardı. Mark Poster burjuva ailesinde sorun tuvalet eğitimi iken aristokrat ailede sorunun otoriteye (baba) itaat olduğunu belirtir. Birinci durumda çocuktan beklenen bedensel denetim, ikinci durumda ise çocuğun toplumsal hiyerarşiye saygı göstermesidir. Bu yaklaşım aristokrat ailelerde çocuklara yakın ilgi, şefkat ve sevecenliği olumsuz yönde etkilemiştir. Bu ailelerde çocukların tuvalet eğitimi gevşek tutulmaktadır. Köylü Aileleri: Feodal toplumun alt tabakalarını teşkil eden köylüler ve serflerin toplum içindeki konumları onların toplumsal rollerini sınırlamak- taydı. Bu olgu söz konusu ailelerin yetişkin kuşakları kadar çocukları da aynı ölçüde kapsamaktadır. Köylü ailelerinde toplumsal otorite evin babasında değil, köyün genel idari otoritesine sahip olan toplumsal mekanizmaya aitti. Mark poster bu olguyu şöyle betimler: Köylü erkeklerin ve kadınların ayrı ayrı işlevleri vardı. Ka- dınlar kendi alanlarında önemli güce sahip olmalarına karşın genelde esaret altındaydılar. Kadınların işi, ailenin ve topluluğun (cemaatin) bekası için önemliydi ve kadınlar ev işleri, çocuk bakımı, tarla işlerinde yoğun bir tempo da çalışıyorlardı. Köylerde duygusal olarak kabul edilen olgular karı-koca ara- sında değil, bir bütün olarak toplulukta vuku bulurdu. Dini bayramlar, tapınma ayinleri, oyunlar vb. eylemler topluluğa ait eylemlerdi. Tek eşli evlilik bağla- mında bile köyün akrabalık ve aile üzerinde egemenliği anne-babaların ve ço cukların ilişkilerini etkilemiştir. Akrabalar, yaşlılar ve genç kadınlar çocuk bakımında annelere yardımcı olmuşlardır. Poster'ın bu açıklamasında şunlar öne çıkarılmaktadır: Otorite, çocuğun yaşamına katılan çok sayıdaki yetişkinle birlikte köy içinde yayılmıştır. Bu otoritenin insafsız olması ve çocuğun ihtiyaçlarına kayıtsız kalması olasıdır. Çocuğun ihtiyaç duyduğu sevgi örüntüsü de geniş bir akraba ve köylü farklılığı üzerinde yayılmıştır. Böylelikle çocuk hem bütün köyün duygusal baskısını üzerinde hissetmiş hem de bu anonim duygusallığa anlam katmıştır. Çocuğun psikolojisi yani çocuk ruhu böylelikle anne babalar tarafından değil anonim bir cemaat ruhu ile kuşatılmış oluyordu. Dolayısıyla köylü çocukları anne-babaların şahsiyetlerini kendileri için kalıcı bir karaktere dönüştüremediler. Çünkü cemaatin ruhu anne babanın şahsiyet terbiyesinin daima önünde yer almaktaydı. Köyün toplumsal hareketliliği, töre ve adetleri çocuğu sosyalleştiren en önemli unsurdu. Çocuk kişiliği bu toplumsal ortamların baskısında köyün ve cemaatin menfaatlerine adanmış bir yapı üretiyordu. Ortaçağ'da Çocuk Kültürü: Aristokrat ve köylü aileleri örnekleri Ortaçağ'da çocuk kültürünün feodal toplum yapısı tarafından kuşatıldığı ve belirlendiğini açıkça göstermektedir. Her iki toplumsal tabakanın kendine öz-gü fark ve ayrıntılarına rağmen bu dönemin çocuk kültürü konusunda tüm toplumsal kategorileri kuşatan özelliklere sahip olduğu söylenebilir. Sözü edilen ortaklık iki önemli faktörün etkisinde gelişir. Bunlardan birincisi toplumsal yapı ve toplumsal koşullar, diğer ise terminolojidir. Ortaçağ tarıma dayalı bir mülkiyet anlayışının egemen olduğu bir toplumsal yapı üretmiştir. Günlük yaşam, tüketim alışkanlıkları ve siyasal örgütlenme biçimleri tarımsal ekonominin ichar ettiği (zorunlu kıldığı) sınırlar içinde gelişir. Feodalite işte bu tarımsal ekonominin bir sonucudur. Çünkü bu ekonomide geçerli olan toprak mülkiyetidir. Toprağa sahip olanlar ve ol- mayanlar aynı zamanda güç ve prestij farklılaşmasının taraflarını da oluş- turmuşlardır. Toprağa sahip olanlar hem ekonomik gücün, hem de siyasal gücün sahipleridirler. Bu güç sahipleri toplumun çalıştıran kesimini, bu güçten yoksun olanlar ise çalışan kesimini teşkil etmekteydi. Çocuklar da mensubiyetlerine uygun olarak toplumun bu kamplaşmasından kuşkusuz paylarını aldıkları için kendilerini babalarının kaderlerinde kabulleniyorlar- dı. Eğitim sosyologu James C. Coleman, bu durumu şöyle açıklar: \\"Endüstri öncesi Avrupa'da çocukların ufku genellikle aileleri tarafından sı- ırlanmaktaydı; bu yüzden çocuklar ailelerine göre yaşıyorlardı. Babalarının konumu ve yaşam standardı ne ise çocuklarının ki de o oluyordu. Eğer baba- nız köle ise siz de muhtemelen köle olarak yaşıyordunuz. Eğer babanız zana- atkâr ise siz de zanaatkâr olmaya mecburdunuz. Bu hareketsizlik bile duru- mun zor kısmı değildi. Çocuk aile -üretim işletmesinin bir parçasıydı ve muhtemelen de bu işletmenin içinde kalacaktı. Bu anlamda aile çocuk üze- rinde tam bir otorite ve sorumluluğa sahipti. Bu durum çocuğun yetişkin ol- ması durumunda da değişmezdi. Çünkü aynı ekonomik birimin bir parçası olarak kalırdı ve bu sorumluluk geleneğini sonraki kuşak üzerinde de yerine getirirdi. Aile dışında bir miktar değişkenlik olsa bile tablo ataerkil geniş aile içinde aile sürekliliğiydi. 372 Bu dönemde çocuğun bütün dünyasını teşkil eden aile aynı zamanda çocu- ğu işe koşan ve istihdam eden bir işletme görünümündeydi. Bu yüzden 7-8 yaşlarından itibaren çocuklar arazi, tarla, bağ-bahçe ve çiftliklerde aileleri- ne yardım ederek bir iş hayatına yönlendirilmekteydi. Bu itibarla denilebilir ki Ortaçağda çocukluk yedi yaşlarında biterdi. Ailenin geçimi ve hayat mü- cadelesi için çocuklar bu yaşlarda gerekliydi. Bu gereklilik aynı zamanda \\"çok çocukluluğu\\" da beraberinde getiriyordu. Gerçekten Ortaçağ'da aileler birden fazla çocuk yapmayı denemişlerdir. Bunun çocukları çalıştırma ve çocuk işgücünden yararlanma isteğinin yanı sıra çocuk ölümlerinin de esaslı bir sebep oluşu ile ilgisi bulunmaktadır. Çocuk ölümleri ailelerde çocukları üzerinde kalıcı duygusal bağlarla onların rın geleceğine yönelik özlemler üretmelerinin de bir engeli olarak görül. mektedir. O kadar ki, 14. yüzyılın sonlarına değin \\"çocuklar vasiyetnamele re bile dahi edilmezlerdi. Çünkü yetişkinler, çocukların çok uzun süre ya- şamayacağını düşünürlerdi.373 Bütün bu gelişmeler ışığında Ortaçağ'da çocuk kültürünün temel özellikleri şöyle sıralanabilir: ✔ Ortaçağda çocuk kendini dil ve davranış olarak ifade edebilecek düzey kabul edilen yedi-sekiz yaşlarında yetişkin yaşamına girerdi. ✓ Çocuğun yetişkin yaşamına girmesi çocukluğun kısa sürede son bulması anlamına gelmekteydi. ✓ Çocuğun yetişkin yaşamına girmesi bir yandan anne-babaların yaptığı işleri paylaşması, Öte yandan onların sahip oldukları dil ve kültüre sahip olmaları anlamına gelmekteydi. \\"Yedi yaşından itibaren çocuklar yetiş- kinlerin söyleyebildiği ve anlayabildiği şeyleri söyleyebilir ve anlayabi- lirlerdi. Bilmeyi gereksindikleri dilin tüm sırlarını bilebilirlerdi. \\"374 Ye- tişkinlerin masal ve eğlence dünyası ile eğlence kültürü de bu çocuk il- gisinin araladığı sırlardandı. Çocuğun bir an önce yetişkin yaşamına girmesi çocuktan beklenen en önemli toplumsal ödev olarak ortaya çık- maktaydı. Bir anlamda çocuklar, \\"annesinin, dadısının ya da beşiğini sallayan kişinin sürekli ilgisi olmadan yaşayabilmeye başlar başlamaz, yetişkinler toplumuna ait oluyor. 375 olmak zorunda kalıyordu. ✓ Ortaçağ'da çocuk eğitimi aristokrat çocuklar için söz konusuydu. Bu eğitimde amaç yetişkin yaşamının bütün kesim ve zümreler için geçerli olan değerleri için değil yalnızca aristokrat kültürün öğrenilmesine yö- nelikti. ✓ Ortaçağ'da çocuğun bilmemesi gerekenler olarak ifade edilen ayıp ve sakıncalı gibi bir kavram ve değer yoktu. Dolayısıyla çocuklar yetişkin yaşamının olanca mahremiyetine son derece yakın olabilmekteydiler. Yetişkinlerin oyun, eğlence ve masal dünyaları da çocukların yabancı olmadıkları bir ilgi ve alışkanlık kültürü idi. ✓ Ortaçağ'ın geçerli dilleri olan Fransızca, İngilizce ve Almancada çocuğu ifade eden özel kelimeler yoktu. Çünkü çocukluk özel bir dönem olarak kabul görmemişti. Bu olgu da özel bir sözcüğün üretilmemesinin bir ne- deni olarak düşünülebilir. Çocuklar \\"cinsiyetsiz cinsler\\" ya da \\"küçük yetişkinler\\" olarak betimlenmekteydi. Bu nedenle onları yetişkinlerden ayıran böyle bir belirtme dışında özel sözcükler bulunmuyordu. Boy, garçon, knabe gibi sözcükler bağımlı bir erkeği belirtmek üzere rastgele kullanılıyordu. 376 ✓ Çocuk giysilerinde yetişkin modeli esas alınıyordu. Bu nedenle çocuk giysileri tıpkı yetişkinlerde olduğu gibi statü farklığının bir alamet-i färikasıydı. \\"Kundaklık elbiseleri giyme dönemi biter bitmez çocuklar aynı biçimde olmak üzere kendi toplumsal sınıflarının yetişkinleri gibi giydirilirdi. 377 ✔ Ortaçağ'ın deva bulmaz salgın hastalıkları en çok çocukları etkilemiştir. Bu nedenle çocuk ölümleri Ortaçağ'a özgü çok belirgin bir toplumsal olgudur. \\"1730 ile 1779 arasında Londra'da ölen insanların yarısının, 5 yaşın altında 378 olduğu göz önüne alındığında olayın vahameti ortaya çıkar. Çok çocukluk ile anne babaların çocuklardan esirgedikleri duygu- sal bağlılıkların (sevgi, şefkat, sevecenlik vs.) olası çocuk ölümleri kar- şısında ortaya çıkan bastırılmış anne-baba tutumlarının bir ölçüde nede- ni yaygın çocuk ölümleridir. ✓ Çocukluğu görmezden gelen Ortaçağ'ın yazılı kültüründe çocuk üzerine yazılmış özel eserler ve çalışmalar yoktur.

Amanda retrieves the money with her leather-gloved hand, sliding the whiskey bottle under her arm.

CONCETTA BLANCHARD, a beautiful but ethereal young woman with porcelain skin and piercing violet eyes, sits in her antiquated wooden wheelchair. Her fashionable white nightgown billows around her, a stark contrast to the gloom of the room. She absentmindedly twirls a lock of her midnight-black hair, her fingers trembling slightly. DR. VICTOR BLOODSTONE, a lanky and wild-haired physician, paces back and forth across the room. He wears a lab coat stained with mysterious substances, and his eyes gleam with an unhinged curiosity.

Pray, have you met our charming patients? They lend an air of whimsy to our little abode.

We delve into the depths of the human psyche, uncovering secrets long forgotten. And you, my dear, hold a key to your own family's clandestine history. Concetta's eyes widen with anticipation, but she quickly composes herself, attempting to maintain an air of nonchalance. CONCETTA BLANCHARD (teasingly) And I suppose you intend to unlock those secrets, Dr. Bloodstone, all while surrounded by antiquated tools and futuristic contraptions? This place seems like a whimsical dance between the past and the future. Dr. Bloodstone chuckles maniacally, a sound that echoes throughout the room. DR.

We push the boundaries of science, blending the eccentricities of gothic horror with the marvels of the giallo era. We are the epitome of the absurd!

El estado en React es un objeto que contiene algunas informaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo, y la vista (UI) se actualiza en respuesta a esos cambios. Cuando llamas a \`useState\`, recibes un par de valores: el estado actual y una función que te permite actualizar ese estado. Cada vez que actualizas el estado usando esa función, React vuelve a renderizar el componente para reflejar los cambios. \`\`\`javascript import React, { useState } from 'react'; function Example() { // Declara una nueva variable de estado, que llamaremos \\"count\\" const [count, setCount] = useState(0); return ( <div> <p>You clicked {count} times</p> <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> Click me </button> </div> ); } \`\`\` En este caso, \`count\` es el valor del estado y \`setCount\` es la función para actualizarlo. El argumento inicial de \`useState(0)\` es el valor inicial del estado. # useEffect \`useEffect\` te permite realizar efectos secundarios en componentes funcionales, similar a los métodos del ciclo de vida \`componentDidMount\`, \`componentDidUpdate\`, y \`componentWillUnmount\` en componentes de clase. Un \\"efecto secundario\\" puede ser cualquier cosa que afecta algo fuera del ámbito del componente, como solicitudes de datos, suscripciones, o manualmente cambiando el DOM de React. \`useEffect\` se llama después de cada renderizado, pero puedes indicarle a React que salte la aplicación de un efecto si ciertos valores no han cambiado entre renderizados. Esto se hace pasando un segundo argumento: un array de dichos valores. \`\`\`javascript import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; function Example() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Similar a componentDidMount y componentDidUpdate: useEffect(() => { // Actualiza el título del documento usando la API del navegador document.title = \`You clicked {count} times\`; }, [count]); // Solo se vuelve a ejecutar si count cambia return ( <div> <p>You clicked {count} times</p> <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> Click me </button> </div> ); } \`\`\` En este caso, React actualizará el título del documento después de cada renderizado, pero debido a que hemos pasado \`count\` como dependencia en el array, el efecto solo se ejecuta cuando el valor de \`count\` cambia. Estos dos hooks forman la base del desarrollo en React con componentes funcionales y permiten a los desarrolladores construir aplicaciones complejas y de respuesta rápida con funcionalidades que anteriormente estaban reservadas para los componentes de clase."},{"instruction":"Explicar un poco más sobre useEffect","output":"El hook \`useEffect\` es una poderosa característica de React que te permite llevar a cabo efectos secundarios en tus componentes funcionales. Los efectos secundarios son operaciones que pueden afectar otros componentes, realizar operaciones de I/O (como peticiones de red), interactuar con la API del navegador o realizar cualquier otra acción que vaya más allá de retornar un elemento JSX en la función del componente. Aquí hay algunas cosas importantes que debes saber sobre \`useEffect\`: # ¿Cuándo se ejecuta useEffect? \`useEffect\` se ejecuta después de que todos los componentes hayan sido evaluados y el DOM haya sido actualizado, lo que lo convierte en el lugar perfecto para realizar cambios que necesitan reflejarse en la pantalla y que dependen de los cambios en el estado y/o las props. # ¿Cómo funciona la limpieza en useEffect? Algunos efectos secundarios pueden requerir limpieza para evitar fugas de memoria, como suscripciones o temporizadores. useEffect puede devolver una función que se llamará cuando el componente se esté desmontando o antes de que el efecto se ejecute la siguiente vez, proporcionando la oportunidad de limpiar esos efectos: \`\`\`javascript useEffect(() => { const subscription = someObservable.subscribe(); // La función de limpieza return () => { subscription.unsubscribe(); }; }, []); // Las dependencias vacías significan que esto solo ocurre en el montaje y desmontaje \`\`\` # Dependencias de efecto \`useEffect\` acepta un segundo argumento opcional: un array de dependencias. React comparará las dependencias de la lista con los valores de la renderización anterior para decidir si debe volver a ejecutar el efecto: - **Sin dependencias (\`useEffect(fn)\`):** El efecto se ejecuta después de cada actualización del componente. - **Con un array vacío (\`useEffect(fn, [])\`):** El efecto se ejecuta solo una vez, después del montaje inicial del componente, similar a \`componentDidMount\`. - **Con un array de dependencias (\`useEffect(fn, [dep1, dep2, ...])\`):** El efecto se ejecuta solo cuando cualquiera de las dependencias ha cambiado entre renderizaciones. # Ejemplo de uso con fetch API Aquí tienes un ejemplo en el que \`useEffect\` se usa para solicitar datos desde una API: \`\`\`javascript import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; function Example() { const [data, setData] = useState(null); useEffect(() => { const fetchData = async () => { const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); const result = await response.json(); setData(result); }; fetchData(); }, []); // Un array vacío como segundo argumento significa que solo se ejecutará una vez // El renderizado del componente if (!data) { return <div>Loading...</div>; } return ( <div> {/* renderizar datos aquí */} </div> ); } \`\`\` En este ejemplo, hacemos una petición a una API apenas el componente se monte (porque pasamos un array vacío de dependencias), y actualizamos el estado local con los datos cuando los recibimos. # Resumen - \`useEffect\` permite ejecutar efectos secundarios en componentes funcionales. - Se ejecuta después de que el DOM se haya actualizado. - Puede contener una función de limpieza para efectuar tareas de limpieza. - Acepta un array de dependencias para controlar cuándo se deberían ejecutar los efectos."},{"instruction":"Explicar useState y useEffect con el siguiente ejemplo: import React, { useEffect } from 'react'; import '../../styles/bases/Loader.css'; export const Loader = ({ seconds }) => { const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(seconds); useEffect(() => { counter > 0 && setTimeout(() => setCounter(counter - 1), 1000); }, [counter]); return ( <div className='loader'> <div className='loader__circle'></div> <div className='loader__circle'></div> <div className='loader__circle'></div> <div className='loader__shadow'></div> <div className='loader__shadow'></div> <div className='loader__shadow'></div> <span className='loader__text'>En brevedad...{counter}</span> </div> ); }","output":"En el ejemplo proporcionado, estamos definiendo \`Loader\` como un componente funcional que utiliza los hooks \`useState\` y \`useEffect\` para crear una cuenta regresiva basada en la cantidad de segundos pasados a través de la prop \`seconds\`. # useState Primero, \`useState\` está siendo utilizado para crear una variable de estado \`counter\` y una función \`setCounter\` que permite actualizar ese estado: \`\`\`javascript const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(seconds); \`\`\` Al llamar a \`useState\`, le estamos pasando \`seconds\` como el valor inicial de \`counter\`. Eso significa que la primera vez que se monta el componente \`Loader\`, el estado \`counter\` será igual al valor de la prop \`seconds\` que se pasó al componente. Luego, cada vez que el estado \`counter\` cambie, el componente se volverá a renderizar con el nuevo valor de \`counter\`. # useEffect El hook \`useEffect\` se está usando para manejar un efecto lateral que es decrementar el contador cada segundo hasta que llegue a cero: \`\`\`javascript useEffect(() => { counter > 0 && setTimeout(() => setCounter(counter - 1), 1000); }, [counter]); \`\`\` Lo que hace \`useEffect\` aquí es muy específico: 1. \`useEffect\` se ejecuta después de que el componente se ha renderizado y el DOM se ha actualizado. 2. Dentro del cuerpo de \`useEffect\`, verificamos si el \`counter\` es mayor que cero. Si es así, se establece un \`setTimeout\` que llamará a \`setCounter(counter - 1)\` después de 1 segundo (1000 milisegundos). Esto disminuirá el contador en uno. 3. El array de dependencias \`[counter]\` le indica a React que este efecto específico solo debe volverse a ejecutar si el valor de \`counter\` ha cambiado desde el último renderizado. Un punto a tener en cuenta es que, aunque no se muestra dentro del código proporcionado, debería haber una limpieza del temporizador para prevenir potenciales fugas de memoria o estados indeseados si el componente se desmonta antes de que el temporizador termine. Esto se haría devolviendo una función desde \`useEffect\` que limpie el temporizador: \`\`\`javascript useEffect(() => { const timer = counter > 0 && setTimeout(() => setCounter(counter - 1), 1000); // Función de limpieza para eliminar el temporizador cuando el componente se desmonte return () => clearTimeout(timer); }, [counter]); \`\`\` # Renderizado del Componente Finalmente, el componente retorna un marcado JSX que representa el loader visual.

Aquí hay algunas ventajas específicas que aporta a la aplicación: - **Abstracción y Reutilización**: Al separar la lógica de vuelos en un hook, los componentes que lo usan no necesitan preocuparse por los detalles de la implementación de cómo se manejan los vuelos, solo necesitan consumir las funciones y el estado proporcionados. - **Simplicidad**: El hook ofrece una API simple y declarativa que oculta la complejidad de las operaciones, como la manipulación de los datos y las actualizaciones contextuales del estado. - **Mantenibilidad**: Si en el futuro es necesario cambiar la forma en que se cargan o filtran los vuelos, se puede hacer en un solo lugar (\`useFlights\`) sin afectar a los componentes que lo utilizan. - **Cohesión**: Agrupar toda la lógica relacionada con los vuelos en un hook separado mantiene al código relacionado con una misma funcionalidad juntos, lo cual es una buena práctica de diseño de software. En resumen, el hook personalizado \`useFlights\` facilita la gestión de vuelos al organizar y proporcionar las funcionalidades necesarias para que otros componentes de la aplicación interactúen con la información de los vuelos de una manera eficiente y mantenible."},{"instruction":"ASI pourrait nous propulsé a une civilisation de type 1","output":"La notion de civilisation de type 1 fait référence à l'échelle de Kardashev, une méthode théorique proposée par l'astrophysicien russe Nikolai Kardashev pour mesurer le niveau de développement technologique d'une civilisation en fonction de l'énergie qu'elle est capable d'utiliser. Une civilisation de type 1 est capable d'utiliser et de stocker toute l'énergie disponible sur sa planète d'origine. Une superintelligence artificielle (ASI), s’il elle est contrôlée et bien dirigée, pourrait théoriquement contribuer de manière significative à l'accomplissement de ce type de développement pour plusieurs raisons: 1. Optimisation énergétique : L'ASI pourrait identifier des moyens plus efficaces de produire, stocker et distribuer l'énergie, réduisant les pertes et augmentant l'efficacité globale de l'utilisation énergétique. 2. Gestion des ressources : Elle pourrait mieux gérer les ressources naturelles de façon durable, permettant une exploitation plus rationnelle et efficace, y compris en s’appuyant sur le recyclage avancé et la préservation de l'environnement. 3. Recherche et développement : L'ASI accélérerait potentiellement les progrès en science et technologie, y compris dans les domaines de la fusion nucléaire, des énergies renouvelables, et d'autres technologies futuristes pouvant clore la dépendance aux combustibles fossiles. 4. Amélioration de l'infrastructure : Elle pourrait aider à la conception et à la construction d'infrastructures énergétiques avancées pour une distribution plus efficace de l'énergie. 5. Développement durable : L'ASI pourrait nous aider à évoluer vers des modes de vie plus durables, réduisant drastiquement l'empreinte écologique de l'humanité. 6. Gouvernance et stabilisation : Avec des capacités analytiques supérieures, l'ASI pourrait contribuer à une meilleure prise de décision politique et économique, favorisant la paix, la stabilité et une coopération internationale nécessaire à un projet de civilisation globale. Toutefois, atteindre le statut de type 1 ne dépend pas uniquement de la capacité à gérer l'énergie mais aussi de nombreux autres facteurs comme les avancées sociales, politiques, et économiques, ainsi que la capacité de la civilisation à surmonter les défis sociaux et écologiques. De plus, il est important de souligner que l'avenir et l'impact d'une ASI sont spéculatifs et comportent des risques importants, y compris des risques existentiels si l'ASI échappe au contrôle humain ou si ses objectifs ne sont pas parfaitement alignés avec le bien-être de l'humanité."},{"instruction":"6.1. Eğitimin Konusu Olarak Çocukluk ve Çocuklar Aristokrasi ve Çocuk: Küçük Hayvanlar Ortaçağ'ın feodal toplumunda en şanslı çocuklar aristokrat çocuklarıdır. Aslında bu çocukların bütün şansları feodal toplumun diğer tabaklarına oranla onların ayrıcalıklı bir tabakada yer almalarıyla sınırlıdır. Yani köylü ve serf ailelerde yer almamaları onların şansı olarak düşünülür. Oysa yakın tahlilde bu görece şanslılığın mutluluğa ve mutlu çocukluğa yol açmadığı görülür. Her şeyden önce aristokrat ailelerde esas olan aristokrasinin yani soylulu- ğun devamıdır. Bu yüzden daha başlangıçta erkek çocuklar lehine bir cinsiyet ayırımı ortaya çıkmaktadır. Çocuklar dünyaya geldikleri andan itibaren hizmet- çilerin ellerindeydi. Çocuk bakımının aristokrat bir kadının soyluluğuna (asale- tine) yakışmadığı düşünülmekteydi. Çocuklar sevgi ve duygulanma nesneleri olarak değil \\"küçük hayvanlar\\" olarak düşünülüyor ve kabul ediliyordu. Soylu çocuklar dadıları tarafından emziriliyordu. Her koşulda çocuklar ilk bağlılıkla- rını aile dışındaki birisiyle kuruyorlardı. Mark Poster burjuva ailesinde sorun tuvalet eğitimi iken aristokrat ailede sorunun otoriteye (baba) itaat olduğunu belirtir. Birinci durumda çocuktan beklenen bedensel denetim, ikinci durumda ise çocuğun toplumsal hiyerarşiye saygı göstermesidir. Bu yaklaşım aristokrat ailelerde çocuklara yakın ilgi, şefkat ve sevecenliği olumsuz yönde etkilemiştir. Bu ailelerde çocukların tuvalet eğitimi gevşek tutulmaktadır. Köylü Aileleri: Feodal toplumun alt tabakalarını teşkil eden köylüler ve serflerin toplum içindeki konumları onların toplumsal rollerini sınırlamak- taydı. Bu olgu söz konusu ailelerin yetişkin kuşakları kadar çocukları da aynı ölçüde kapsamaktadır. Köylü ailelerinde toplumsal otorite evin babasında değil, köyün genel idari otoritesine sahip olan toplumsal mekanizmaya aitti. Mark poster bu olguyu şöyle betimler: Köylü erkeklerin ve kadınların ayrı ayrı işlevleri vardı. Ka- dınlar kendi alanlarında önemli güce sahip olmalarına karşın genelde esaret altındaydılar. Kadınların işi, ailenin ve topluluğun (cemaatin) bekası için önemliydi ve kadınlar ev işleri, çocuk bakımı, tarla işlerinde yoğun bir tempo da çalışıyorlardı. Köylerde duygusal olarak kabul edilen olgular karı-koca ara- sında değil, bir bütün olarak toplulukta vuku bulurdu. Dini bayramlar, tapınma ayinleri, oyunlar vb. eylemler topluluğa ait eylemlerdi. Tek eşli evlilik bağla- mında bile köyün akrabalık ve aile üzerinde egemenliği anne-babaların ve ço cukların ilişkilerini etkilemiştir. Akrabalar, yaşlılar ve genç kadınlar çocuk bakımında annelere yardımcı olmuşlardır. Poster'ın bu açıklamasında şunlar öne çıkarılmaktadır: Otorite, çocuğun yaşamına katılan çok sayıdaki yetişkinle birlikte köy içinde yayılmıştır. Bu otoritenin insafsız olması ve çocuğun ihtiyaçlarına kayıtsız kalması olasıdır. Çocuğun ihtiyaç duyduğu sevgi örüntüsü de geniş bir akraba ve köylü farklılığı üzerinde yayılmıştır. Böylelikle çocuk hem bütün köyün duygusal baskısını üzerinde hissetmiş hem de bu anonim duygusallığa anlam katmıştır. Çocuğun psikolojisi yani çocuk ruhu böylelikle anne babalar tarafından değil anonim bir cemaat ruhu ile kuşatılmış oluyordu. Dolayısıyla köylü çocukları anne-babaların şahsiyetlerini kendileri için kalıcı bir karaktere dönüştüremediler. Çünkü cemaatin ruhu anne babanın şahsiyet terbiyesinin daima önünde yer almaktaydı. Köyün toplumsal hareketliliği, töre ve adetleri çocuğu sosyalleştiren en önemli unsurdu. Çocuk kişiliği bu toplumsal ortamların baskısında köyün ve cemaatin menfaatlerine adanmış bir yapı üretiyordu. Ortaçağ'da Çocuk Kültürü: Aristokrat ve köylü aileleri örnekleri Ortaçağ'da çocuk kültürünün feodal toplum yapısı tarafından kuşatıldığı ve belirlendiğini açıkça göstermektedir. Her iki toplumsal tabakanın kendine öz-gü fark ve ayrıntılarına rağmen bu dönemin çocuk kültürü konusunda tüm toplumsal kategorileri kuşatan özelliklere sahip olduğu söylenebilir. Sözü edilen ortaklık iki önemli faktörün etkisinde gelişir. Bunlardan birincisi toplumsal yapı ve toplumsal koşullar, diğer ise terminolojidir.

Köylü ailelerinde ise toplumsal otoritenin çocuğun yaşamını etkilediği ve çocuğun ihtiyaçlarına kayıtsız kalabileceği üzerinde durulmuş.

Bu itibarla denilebilir ki Ortaçağda çocukluk yedi yaşlarında biterdi. Ailenin geçimi ve hayat mü- cadelesi için çocuklar bu yaşlarda gerekliydi. Bu gereklilik aynı zamanda \\"çok çocukluluğu\\" da beraberinde getiriyordu. Gerçekten Ortaçağ'da aileler birden fazla çocuk yapmayı denemişlerdir. Bunun çocukları çalıştırma ve çocuk işgücünden yararlanma isteğinin yanı sıra çocuk ölümlerinin de esaslı bir sebep oluşu ile ilgisi bulunmaktadır. Çocuk ölümleri ailelerde çocukları üzerinde kalıcı duygusal bağlarla onların rın geleceğine yönelik özlemler üretmelerinin de bir engeli olarak görül. mektedir.

Bilmeyi gereksindikleri dilin tüm sırlarını bilebilirlerdi. \\"374 Ye- tişkinlerin masal ve eğlence dünyası ile eğlence kültürü de bu çocuk il- gisinin araladığı sırlardandı. Çocuğun bir an önce yetişkin yaşamına girmesi çocuktan beklenen en önemli toplumsal ödev olarak ortaya çık- maktaydı. Bir anlamda çocuklar, \\"annesinin, dadısının ya da beşiğini sallayan kişinin sürekli ilgisi olmadan yaşayabilmeye başlar başlamaz, yetişkinler toplumuna ait oluyor. 375 olmak zorunda kalıyordu. ✓ Ortaçağ'da çocuk eğitimi aristokrat çocuklar için söz konusuydu. Bu eğitimde amaç yetişkin yaşamının bütün kesim ve zümreler için geçerli olan değerleri için değil yalnızca aristokrat kültürün öğrenilmesine yö- nelikti. ✓ Ortaçağ'da çocuğun bilmemesi gerekenler olarak ifade edilen ayıp ve sakıncalı gibi bir kavram ve değer yoktu. Dolayısıyla çocuklar yetişkin yaşamının olanca mahremiyetine son derece yakın olabilmekteydiler. Yetişkinlerin oyun, eğlence ve masal dünyaları da çocukların yabancı olmadıkları bir ilgi ve alışkanlık kültürü idi. ✓ Ortaçağ'ın geçerli dilleri olan Fransızca, İngilizce ve Almancada çocuğu ifade eden özel kelimeler yoktu. Çünkü çocukluk özel bir dönem olarak kabul görmemişti. Bu olgu da özel bir sözcüğün üretilmemesinin bir ne- deni olarak düşünülebilir. Çocuklar \\"cinsiyetsiz cinsler\\" ya da \\"küçük yetişkinler\\" olarak betimlenmekteydi. Bu nedenle onları yetişkinlerden ayıran böyle bir belirtme dışında özel sözcükler bulunmuyordu. Boy, garçon, knabe gibi sözcükler bağımlı bir erkeği belirtmek üzere rastgele kullanılıyordu. 376 ✓ Çocuk giysilerinde yetişkin modeli esas alınıyordu. Bu nedenle çocuk giysileri tıpkı yetişkinlerde olduğu gibi statü farklığının bir alamet-i färikasıydı. \\"Kundaklık elbiseleri giyme dönemi biter bitmez çocuklar aynı biçimde olmak üzere kendi toplumsal sınıflarının yetişkinleri gibi giydirilirdi. 377 ✔ Ortaçağ'ın deva bulmaz salgın hastalıkları en çok çocukları etkilemiştir.

L'échelle de Kardashev est une méthode de mesure du niveau technologique d'une civilisation basée sur la quantité d'énergie dont elle est capable d'utiliser. Une civilisation de type I est capable d'utiliser toute l'énergie disponible sur sa planète, une civilisation de type II peut utiliser toute l'énergie de son système stellaire (comme celle émise par son étoile), et une civilisation de type III peut utiliser l'énergie à l'échelle de sa galaxie. En théorie, une ASI pourrait aider l'humanité à faire le saut vers une civilisation de type II en plusieurs façons : 1. Gestion de l'énergie : Une ASI pourrait optimiser de manière extrêmement efficace l'utilisation et la production d'énergie, en maximisant l'efficience et en réduisant le gaspillage. 2. Avancées scientifiques et technologiques : Grâce à sa capacité supérieure de traitement de l'information, une ASI pourrait accélérer le rythme des découvertes scientifiques, en principe trouvant des solutions à des problèmes qui entravent actuellement notre développement technologique. 3. Colonisation spatiale : L'ASI pourrait concevoir des vaisseaux spatiaux avancés et des habitats spatiaux, faciliter l'exploitation des ressources extraterrestres et ouvrir la voie à la colonisation humaine du système solaire, un précurseur nécessaire à une civilisation de type II. 4. Énergie durable : Une ASI pourrait développer des sources d'énergie renouvelables ou quasi-infinies, comme la fusion nucléaire ou avancer significativement dans l'ingénierie de la matière pour permettre l'exploitation efficace de l'énergie solaire à grande échelle. 5. Contrôle et maintenance de l'infrastructure : Une ASI serait capable de superviser et de maintenir une infrastructure énergétique complexe à l'échelle d'un système stellaire avec une efficacité sans précédent. 6. Assurer la sécurité et la durabilité : Une ASI pourrait identifier et atténuer les risques possibles pour l'existence de l'humanité, y compris la gestion des armes, les impacts environnementaux et la prévention des catastrophes.

Ce développement aurait le potentiel de transformer radicalement nos vies, nos sociétés et nos loisirs de plusieurs manières : 1. Énergie Abondante : Avec l'accès à une telle quantité d'énergie, les problèmes de pénurie énergétique seraient résolus. Ceci pourrait se traduire par une baisse drastique des coûts de production et de consommation pour à peu près tous les services et produits, permettant des technologies et activités jusque-là trop coûteuses. 2. Avancements Technologiques : Les progrès technologiques, turbochargés par des quantités massives d'énergie, pourraient conduire à des améliorations dans des domaines tels que la santé, le transport, l'habitation et l'éducation. Par exemple, les voyages spatiaux pourraient devenir routiniers et accessibles, ouvrant de nouveaux horizons de loisirs. 3. Expansion Spatiale : Notre capacité à vivre et voyager dans l'espace signifierait que des loisirs tels que le tourisme spatial ou l'exploration de nouveaux mondes pourraient devenir des options viables pour le grand public. 4. Évolution de l'Emploi : Avec d'importantes innovations dans l'automatisation et l'intelligence artificielle, la nature du travail pourrait être radicalement transformée, peut-être réduisant la nécessité de travailler pour vivre et offrant aux gens plus de temps pour les loisirs et les activités créatives. 5. Changements sociétaux : Si l'énergie ne constitue plus un coût significatif, cela pourrait entraîner des changements majeurs dans les structures économiques et politiques. Les inégalités basées sur l'accès et le contrôle des ressources pourraient être réduites, potentiellement conduisant à une ère de prospérité partagée. 6. Modifications Législatives : Avec ces nouveaux domaines de croissance, de nouvelles lois devront être mises en place pour réglementer l'utilisation de l'espace, la répartition des ressources énergétiques, les nouveaux types de propriété (comme des terrains sur d'autres planètes), ainsi que les droits et responsabilités qui résulteraient de nos interactions accrues avec l'intelligence artificielle. 7. Éducation et Recherche : Un accroissement des ressources disponibles pour l'éducation et la recherche pourrait entraîner une ère de curiosité et de découverte sans précédent, enrichissant nos loisirs par le biais de l'éducation et de la culture. 8. Durabilité et Environnement : L'accès à l'énergie propre à grande échelle pourrait permettre de réduire ou éliminer notre dépendance aux combustibles fossiles, ce qui aurait des effets positifs significatifs sur l'environnement. Il est difficile de prévoir tous les changements exacts qui pourraient survenir, car ils dépendraient de nombreux facteurs, y compris les choix politiques, la culture, l'évolution des valeurs sociales, et les technologies spécifiques développées. Toutefois, le passage à une civilisation de type 2 impliquerait des changements profonds et généralisés sur le plan technologique et social qui façonneraient les activités humaines et les modes de vie de manière inédite."},{"instruction":"Mais si on n’ ai une civilisation de type 2 sa va changer quoi dans les jeux vidéo","output":"L'avancement vers une civilisation de type 2 pourrait avoir des implications significatives pour l'industrie des jeux vidéo, induisant des avancées et des changements qui pourraient transformer l'expérience de jeu comme suit : 1. **Réalisme graphique et immersion** : Avec des ressources énergétiques virtuallement illimitées et des technologies avancées, les développeurs pourraient créer des jeux d'une fidélité visuelle et sonore inégalée, avec des graphismes photoréalistes et des mondes de jeu extrêmement détaillés et interactifs. 2. **Intelligence artificielle avancée** : Les jeux pourraient intégrer des IAs bien plus avancées, permettant à des personnages non-joueurs (PNJs) de réagir et d'interagir avec le joueur de manière beaucoup plus crédible et imprévisible, rendant les mondes de jeu plus dynamiques et réalistes. 3. **Simulation et monde virtuel** : Les progrès en informatique permettraient la création de simulations vastes et complexes, avec des mondes virtuels qui fonctionnent avec leurs propres écosystèmes, économies et sociétés, offrant une profondeur et une rejouabilité inégalées. 4. **Connectivité globale** : Des réseaux de communication ultra-rapides et économes en énergie pourraient permettre des expériences multijoueurs sur une échelle jamais vue, rassemblant des joueurs du monde entier sans latence perceptible. 5. **Technologies de contrôle novatrices** : Les interfaces homme-machine seraient probablement beaucoup plus sophistiquées, avec peut-être l'implantation de dispositifs de contrôle direct par la pensée ou des réalités augmentées et mixtes qui brouillent la ligne entre jeu et réalité. 6. **Éducation et formation** : Les jeux pourraient devenir des outils éducatifs et de formation encore plus efficaces, utilisant des simulations interactives pour enseigner des compétences complexes ou pour préparer les gens à des carrières dans les technologies de pointe ou l'exploration spatiale. 7. **Jeux vidéo comme expérience commune** : Avec une prospérité potentielle et plus de temps libre grâce à l'automatisation, les jeux vidéo pourraient devenir une partie encore plus centrale de la culture humaine, servant de plateformes principales pour les interactions sociales, l'art et le récit d'histoires. 8. **Infrastructure de jeu étendue** : Il pourrait y avoir des infrastructures physiques dédiées aux jeux, comme des arènes VR massives ou des parcs thématiques interactifs exploitant pleinement les capacités technologiques avancées. 9. **Durabilité** : Les jeux pourraient être développés et exécutés sur des plateformes qui sont complètement durables et respectueuses de l’environnement, grâce à l'utilisation d’énergie propre et renouvelable. Il est également possible que les formes de loisirs et de jeux que nous ne pouvons pas encore imaginer émergeront, étant donné que des avancées technologiques sur une telle échelle pourront transformer notre imagination et nos attentes de manière radicale. La créativité des concepteurs de jeux vidéo sera probablement le facteur limitant plutôt que les capacités matérielles ou énergétiques."},{"instruction":"Оксана Игоревна, я могу все объяснить, это не то, о чем вы подумали…”Но Оксана Игоревна уже не слушала, она была в ярости. “Как ты смеешь, Лизавета?!

Но теперь было уже поздно для раскаяния.Мария молча стояла рядом, наблюдая за всем происходящим. Она чувствовала себя неловко и понимала, что стала ненароком причиной разрыва двух людей. “Лизавета, я не хотела навредить, верь мне. Я даже не знала о твоей связи с Оксаной Игоревной”, - сказала она с горечью в голосе.Лиза, сломленная и переполненная чувствами, просто кивнула, соглашаясь с Марией. “Я понимаю, но теперь все равно. Все разрушено. Я потеряла все, что было мне дорого”, - прошептала она, слезы текли по ее щекам.Оксана Игоревна молча повернулась и вышла из кабинета. Лиза смотрела ей вслед с грустью в глазах, зная, что больше ничего не может исправить их отношения.Мария прикоснулась к руке Лизы и прошептала: “Прости, что стала причиной всего этого. Я действительно не хотела никому навредить. Но я знаю, что ты сильная и найдешь силы справиться с этим”.Лиза кивнула и поняла, что теперь ей нужно смириться с произошедшим, проявить Хочу продолжение истории диалогов Марии и Лизы.

Лиза, все еще потрясенная происшедшим, сидела на стуле, смотря в пол. Мария, стоя рядом, наблюдая за ней с нежностью и заботой, понимала, что нужно что-то сделать, чтобы вернуть доверие Лизы и ее сердце.- Лиза, я знаю, что ты испытываешь сейчас много боли и разочарования, - начала Мария, обращаясь к Лизе. - Но я хочу, чтобы ты знала, что я готова бороться за нас. Я не позволю директрисе или еще кому-то разрушить то, что у нас есть. Я люблю тебя и готова сделать все возможное, чтобы вернуть твою улыбку и доверие.Лиза подняла глаза и посмотрела на Марию, в ее глазах промелькнула искра надежды. Голос девушки звучал слегка дрожащим, но ее слова были заполнены решимостью.- Мария, я действительно не ожидала такой обман от Оксаны Игоревны. И я понимаю, что ты не знала, что у меня есть отношения с ней. Но я это простить не могу. Я чувствовала себя преданным и разочарованным. Я не хочу быть с кем-то, кто не доверяет мне.Мария медленно подошла к Лизе, села рядом на стул и взяла ее руку в свои. Она смотрела ей прямо в глаза.- Лиза, я обещаю тебе, что я буду заслуживать твоего доверия. Я буду заботиться о тебе и показывать тебе, что ты важна для меня. Я готова стоять рядом с тобой и бороться за наше счастье. Но я понимаю, что это решение должно быть твоим. Если ты решаешь пойти со мной, я постараюсь сделать все возможное, чтобы быть твоей опорой и любить тебя.Лиза медленно кивнула, ощущая смесь эмоций внутри себя. Она знала, что будет трудно простить и забыть произошедшее, но она также давно испытывала сильные чувства к Марии.- Я не могу сказать, что все будет легко, Мария. Но я даю тебе шанс. Я готова попытаться восстановить наши отношения. Но, пожалуйста, будь искренней со мной. Будь лучшей, чем другие.Мария улыбнулась и прижала руку Лизы к своим губам, чтобы поцеловать ее пальцы.- Я обещаю быть только лучшей, Лиза. Мое сердце верит, что мы можем преодолеть все трудности и быть счастливыми вместе. Лиза улыбнулась и нашла в себе силы снова поверить в любовь. Она позволила Марии приблизиться и они обнялись, чувствуя, как их сердца начинают замирать в унисон.В другом конце школы, Оксана Игоревна, слушая голоса Лизы и Марии, ощутила ревность и гнев. Она понимала, что проиграла их сердца. Но она решила, что не сдастся так просто. Она начала замышлять новые планы, чтобы разрушить отношения Марии и Лизы, устроив историю, из которой будет невозможно выбраться…Продолжение следует…Хочу продолжение истории диалогов Марии и Лизы. Оксаны Игоревны, Ольги ЮрьевныВ следующий день, Лиза и Мария были чрезвычайно осторожными и предпочитали держаться подальше от глаз посторонних. Они понимали, что Оксана Игоревна и директриса Ольга Юрьевна не простят им и будут стараться разрушить их отношения любой ценой.Во время перерыва между уроками, Лиза заметила, что Оксана Игоревна наблюдает за ними со двора школы, с неудовольствием сжимая свой мобильный телефон. Лиза почувствовала, что что-то не так и предположила, что Оксана Игоревна готовится к новой атаке.- Мария, я вижу Оксану Игоревну. Я думаю, она готова использовать какие-то компроматы или угрозы, чтобы разрушить нас, - шепнула Лиза Марии, пытаясь сохранить спокойствие.Мария посмотрела в сторону Оксаны Игоревны и улыбнулась Хочу захватывающее интригующее продолжение История","output":"получает новый поворот. Она крепко сжала руку Лизы и сказала: - Лиза, я не позволю Оксане Игоревне разрушить наши отношения. Я готова бороться за нашу любовь и показать ей, что мы сильнее ее игр и манипуляций.

Давай покажем Оксане Игоревне, что нам не нужны ее игры и угрозы. Мы сильные вместе и ничто не сможет нас разделять. Мария приложила палец ко губам Лизы и тихо прошептала: - Дай-ка я придумаю свой план. Я знаю, как найти уголок справедливости и победить Оксану Игоревну. В следующую минуту Мария и Лиза уже тронулись в другой конец школы, в кабинет директрисы Ольги Юрьевны. Они знали, что Оксана Игоревна точно будет здесь, пытаясь обратить директрису на свою сторону. Когда они вошли, Оксана Игоревна была занята разговором с Ольгой Юрьевной. Взгляд директрисы мгновенно сместился на Марию и Лизу, пока Оксана Игоревна продолжала горячий спор. - Лиза, Мария, вы что здесь делаете?! - вскричала Ольга Юрьевна, сердито смотря на них. Мария не смутилась, она стояла так, будто была готова к прямому сопротивлению. - Директриса, простите нас за вторжение в ваш кабинет, но нам есть, что вам рассказать. Здесь есть некая информация, которая может изменить ваше представление об Оксане Игоревне, - сказала Мария, показывая на Оксану Игоревну. Ольга Юрьевна подозрительно посмотрела на Оксану Игоревну и потребовала объяснений. - Что это за информация и почему ты, Оксана Игоревна, не рассказала мне об этом? - рассердилась директриса. Оксана Игоревна открыла рот, чтобы что-то ответить, но Лиза вмешалась. - Оксана Игоревна, мы знаем о ваших планах разрушить наши отношения и о том, что вы использовали ложные доказательства. У вас больше нет силы влиять на нас. Вы проиграли. Мария достала из сумки папку с доказательствами и передала ее Ольге Юрьевне. - Вот документы, директриса. Они подтверждают, что Оксана Игоревна использовала поддельные знаки внимания и угрозы, чтобы переключить внимание Лизы на себя и сорвать наши отношения. Ольга Юрьевна просмотрела документы, ее выражение лица стало жестче. Она встала и устремила свой взгляд на Оксану Игоревну. - Оксана Игоревна, вы серьезно? Вы действительно использовали подлоги и угрозы, чтобы разрушить отношения своей коллеги и ученицы? - спросила директриса, пронизывая Оксану Игоревну своим взглядом. Оксана Игоревна попыталась ответить, но слова замерли на губах. Она осознала, что проиграла и что дальнейшие отрицания не имеют смысла. - Директриса, я... я не могу ничего сказать в свое оправдание. Я пыталась разрушить их отношения, потому что... потому что я была ревнива и опустошена, - призналась Оксана Игоревна, склоняя голову. Ольга Юрьевна вздохнула и сделала еще один шаг вперед. - Оксана Игоревна, ваши действия недопустимы. Вы нарушили доверие, вы попытались разрушить отношения людей, которые вам доверяли. Ваша работа здесь больше не может быть продолжена. Вы уволены с поста учителя этой школы. Оксана Игоревна была ошеломлена, ее глаза наполнились слезами. - Но... но я люблю эту школу, - сказала она, пытаясь умолкнуть слезы. - Любовь не оправдывает таких по"},{"instruction":"Freedom Planet x Naruto: Naruto characters react to Dragon & Human Kingdom (Naruto's homeland) some of them could be Naruto's Allies.

Qui è presentato un breve riassunto degli eventi chiave nella storia di New York: 1. Pre-Colonizzazione: Prima dell'arrivo degli europei, l'area che ora è nota come New York era abitata da diverse tribù nativo americane, come i Lenape. 2. Esplorazione europea: L'esploratore italiano Giovanni da Verrazzano fu uno dei primi europei a esplorare la zona nel 1524, ma fu il capitano olandese Henry Hudson nel 1609 a viaggiare lungo il fiume che oggi porta il suo nome. 3. Nuova Amsterdam: Nel 1624, la Compagnia Olandese delle Indie Occidentali fondò l'avamposto coloniale di Nuova Amsterdam sull'isola di Manhattan, che servì come centro del commercio delle pellicce e di altre attività commerciali. 4. Dominio Britannico: Nel 1664, gli inglesi presero il controllo della colonia e la ribattezzarono \\"New York\\" in onore del duca di York (che in seguito divenne re Giacomo II d'Inghilterra). La città crebbe sia in termini di popolazione che di importanza economica durante il periodo coloniale. 5. Rivoluzione Americana: New York giocò un ruolo significativo nella Rivoluzione Americana, compresa la Battaglia di Brooklyn (noto anche come Battaglia di Long Island) nel 1776. La città fu occupata dalle forze britanniche per la maggior parte della guerra ma divenne la prima capitale degli Stati Uniti dopo l'indipendenza. 6. Espansione nel XIX secolo: Durante il XIX secolo, New York divenne un centro importante per l'immigrazione, con milioni di immigrati, soprattutto europei, che arrivarono attraverso Ellis Island. La città crebbe rapidamente sia in termini di estensione territoriale che di popolazione. 7. Rinascita economica e culturale: Con l'inizio della Rivoluzione Industriale, la città si è trasformata in un hub di finanza, commercio, cultura e arte. Wall Street divenne il simbolo del distretto finanziario americano. 8. Grande Depressione e Dopoguerra: New York fu colpita duramente dalla Grande Depressione degli anni '30, ma vide anche grandi progetti di costruzione come l'Empire State Building. Dopo la seconda guerra mondiale, la città continuò a espandersi ed evolversi, ospitando organizzazioni internazionali come le Nazioni Unite. 9. Crisi e Ripristino: Negli anni '70 e '80, New York affrontò crisi economiche e questioni legate al crimine. Tuttavia, verso la fine del XX secolo e l'inizio del XXI secolo, la città conobbe un periodo di ripresa e rigenerazione. 10. Eventi recenti: La tragedia dell'11 settembre 2001, in cui furono distrutte le Torri Gemelle del World Trade Center, ebbe un impatto profondo sulla città, seguito da un periodo di ricostruzione e solidarietà. New York continua a essere un epicentro dinamico di affari, cultura, moda e politica, nonostante le sfide come la crisi finanziaria globale del 2008 e la pandemia di COVID-19 del 2020-2021. Tutto sommato, la storia di New York è caratterizzata da periodi di rapidi cambiamenti, sfide e resilienza, unendo una diversa popolazione in una metropoli che rappresenta sia la promessa del sogno americano sia le complessità della vita urbana moderna."},{"instruction":"Che differenza c'è new york city","output":"Se stai chiedendo quale sia la differenza tra il termine \\"New York\\" in riferimento allo stato e \\"New York City\\" in riferimento alla città, ecco la spiegazione: - New York (spesso abbreviato in NY) è uno degli stati che compongono gli Stati Uniti d'America, situato nel nord-est del paese. Confina a sud con la Pennsylvania e il New Jersey, ad est con il Connecticut, il Massachusetts e il Vermont, a nord con il Canada, e ad ovest con il Lago Erie, il Niagara e l'Ontario. Lo stato di New York è il quarto stato più popoloso degli USA e ha un'economia molto variegata che include settori come il finanziario, il manifatturiero e l'agricoltura. La capitale dello stato è Albany. - New York City (NYC), invece, è la città più popolosa degli Stati Uniti e si trova nello stato di New York. Essa è composta da cinque distretti, chiamati borghi (boroughs): Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, il Bronx e Staten Island. New York City è un importante centro per la finanza, la cultura, i media, l'arte, la moda, la ricerca, la tecnologia e il commercio. La città è spesso chiamata \\"The Big Apple\\" e \\"la città che non dorme mai\\", e possiede un'influenza globale in molti ambiti. New York City è anche il luogo in cui si trovano le Nazioni Unite e alcuni tra i più famosi simboli ed attrazioni del mondo, tra cui Times Square, Central Park e il ponte di Brooklyn. La differenza chiave è quindi tra lo stato di New York, una delle 50 entità federate degli Stati Uniti con una propria governance statale, e New York City, la città più grande dello stato e una delle città più influenti al mondo."},{"instruction":"Washington dc?","output":"Washington, D.C. è la capitale degli Stati Uniti d'America. Il \\"D.C.\\" sta per \\"District of Columbia\\", che è un distretto federale, cioè una zona speciale che non fa parte di nessuno dei 50 stati USA, ma è sotto la diretta giurisdizione del governo federale americano. Il Distretto di Columbia venne creato come risultato di un compromesso tra i fondatori degli Stati Uniti, che volevano una capitale nazionale su terreno neutrale, in modo che non fosse sotto il controllo di un singolo stato. Ecco alcune informazioni chiave su Washington, D.C.: - Fondata: Il sito per la capitale degli Stati Uniti fu scelto dal primo Presidente George Washington nel 1791 e progettato dall'architetto francese Pierre Charles L'Enfant. La città venne ufficialmente fondata il 16 luglio 1790, e il governo federale si trasferì qui nel 1800. - Localizzazione: Washington, D.C. è situata sulla costa est degli Stati Uniti, sul fiume Potomac, confinante con gli stati di Virginia (a sud e ovest) e Maryland (a nord e est). - Governanza: Sebbene D.C. abbia un proprio sindaco e un consiglio comunale, il Congresso americano ha l'ultima parola sul suo bilancio e sulle sue leggi. Questo ha creato un lungo dibattito sulla rappresentanza e l'autodeterminazione dei residenti di D.C. - Non è uno Stato: A differenza degli stati USA, Washington, D.C. non ha rappresentanti con pieno diritto di voto nel Congresso americano. Ha un delegato non votante alla Camera dei Rappresentanti e nessun rappresentante al Senato, sebbene ci siano movimenti che chiedono il pieno riconoscimento dello status di stato per il distretto. - Sedi del Potere: Washington è il centro del potere politico americano e ospita importanti istituzioni, come la Casa Bianca (residenza e ufficio del Presidente degli Stati Uniti), il Campidoglio (sede del Congresso americano), la Corte Suprema degli Stati Uniti, e numerose agenzie governative nazionali. - Simboli e Monumenti: Numerosi monumenti e memoriali si trovano a Washington, D.C., incluso il Lincoln Memorial, il Washington Monument, il Jefferson Memorial e il Vietnam Veterans Memorial. La città ospita anche diversi musei importanti, come quelli dello Smithsonian Institution. - Popolazione: Washington, D.C. ha una popolazione diversificata di circa 700.000 residenti, una cifra che può raddoppiare trasitoriamente durante la giornata lavorativa a causa dei pendolari che vengono da Maryland e Virginia. Washington, D.C. è una città di grande importanza storica e politica, con un ruolo di primo piano non solo negli Stati Uniti ma anche a livello internazionale."},{"instruction":"Cuba dove si trova?","output":"Cuba è un'isola e uno stato situato nel Mar dei Caraibi. Si trova a sud degli Stati Uniti, precisamente a sud della Florida e delle Bahamas, a ovest di Hispaniola (condivisa da Haiti e dalla Repubblica Dominicana) e a nord della Giamaica e delle Isole Cayman. Geograficamente, è l'isola più grande dei Caraibi e, politicamente, è una repubblica socialista con la capitale all'Avana. A livello geopolitico, Cuba è stata al centro di numerosi eventi storici importanti, tra cui la Rivoluzione Cubana del 1959, che portò alla formazione di un governo comunista sotto la guida di Fidel Castro. Durante la Guerra Fredda, la sua alleanza con l'Unione Sovietica giocò un ruolo cruciale in eventi globali, come la Crisi dei Missili di Cuba del 1962, che segnò uno dei momenti di massima tensione tra Stati Uniti e Unione Sovietica."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},F=["disabled"],R={key:0},M={key:1};function j(o,e,l,f,n,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(x,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),w(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",I,' No results found for "'+h(n.searchQuery)+'".
