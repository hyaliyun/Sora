We will compare b and c first. To do this, we define a function f(x)=ln(x+1)-frac{3}{4}sin x for 0＜x＜frac{1}{3}. The derivative of f(x) is {f'}(x)=frac{1}{{x+1}}-frac{3}{4}cos x. Since 0 lt x lt frac{1}{3}, we have frac{3}{4}＜frac{1}{{1+x}}＜1 and frac{3}{4}cos x＜frac{3}{4}. This implies {f'}left(xright) gt 0, indicating that fleft(xright) is monotonically increasing on (0,frac{1}{3}). Therefore, for 0＜x＜frac{1}{3}, we have ln(x+1)＞frac{3}{4}sin x. Setting x=frac{1}{{60}} gives lnfrac{{61}}{{60}}＞frac{3}{4}sinfrac{1}{{60}}, which means c gt b. Next, we compare a and c. We define another function g(x)=frac{{sqrt{x}}}{3}-ln(x+1) for 0＜x＜frac{1}{{40}}. The derivative of g(x) is {g'}(x)=frac{1}{{6sqrt{x}}}-frac{1}{{x+1}}=frac{{x-6sqrt{x}+1}}{{6sqrt{x}(x+1)}}. We observe that x-6sqrt{x}+1={(sqrt{x})^2}-6sqrt{x}+1=(sqrt{x}-3)^{2}-8, which is monotonically decreasing on sqrt{x}∈(0,sqrt{frac{1}{{40}}}). Since x-6sqrt{x}+1＞frac{1}{{40}}-frac{3}{{sqrt{10}}}+1＞0, we conclude that {g'}left(xright) gt 0, indicating that gleft(xright) is monotonically increasing on (0,frac{1}{{40}}). Therefore, for 0＜x＜frac{1}{{40}}, frac{{sqrt{x}}}{3}＞ln(x+1). Setting x=frac{1}{{60}} gives frac{1}{{6sqrt{15}}}=frac{1}{3}sqrt{frac{1}{{60}}}＞lnfrac{{61}}{{60}}, which means a gt c.

Prove that this sequence is nonperiodic.","output":"To prove that the sequence of zeros and ones defined in the problem is non-periodic, assume for the sake of contradiction that it is periodic.  1. **Let us assume** the sequence has a period ( d ) and a pre-period ( m ). 2. **Consider a number** ( n ) such that ( 10^n > m+d ). We need ( 10^n ) to ensure that ( 10^n ) and ( 10^{n+1} ) are within the range where periodic nature should manifest if the sequence were indeed periodic. Specifically, selecting ( 10^n > m+d ) means that ( 10^n ) and ( 10^n + d ) or any equivalent pair will not fall within the pre-period ( m ). 3. **Analyze the sum of the digits**:     - The sum of the digits of ( 10^n ) is 1 (since it consists of one '1' followed by ( n ) zeros).     - Similarly, the sum of the digits of ( 10^{n+1} ) is also 1 (since it consists of one '1' followed by ( n+1 ) zeros).     This implies both ( 10^n ) and ( 10^{n+1} ) would be represented by a 1 as their sums of digits are odd. 4. **Consider the numbers** ( 10^n - d ) and ( 10^{n+1} - d ):     - The sum of the digits of ( 10^n - d ) would be different from the sum of the digits of ( 10^n ) by 9 (since subtracting ( d ) changes the sum of digits by the effect of each digit in ( d )).     - Similarly, the sum of the digits of ( 10^{n+1} - d ) would also differ from ( 10^{n+1} ) by 9.     This disparity implies that ( 10^n - d ) and ( 10^{n+1} - d ) would differ in their sums by a multiple of 9, which means their parity (odd or even nature of the sum) will be opposite to each of their original counterparts: ( 10^n ) and ( 10^{n+1} ). 5. **Contradiction**:      - Since ( 10^n ) and ( 10^{n+1} ) have an odd sum of digits, they should be 1.     - ( 10^n - d ) and ( 10^{n+1} - d ) have their sums of digits differing by 9. If ( 10^n ) and ( 10^n + d ) needed to match the period, ( 10^n - d ) and ( 10^{n+1} - d ) would have a different parity, thus leading to them having different binary values contradictory to a period definition.

A: Sufficient but not necessary condition B: Necessary but not sufficient condition C: Necessary and sufficient condition D: Neither sufficient nor necessary conditio","output":"To understand the relationship between complementary events and mutually exclusive events, let's first define what they mean. - **Complementary Events**: Two events are complementary if they are the only two possible outcomes and their probabilities sum up to 1. That is, if one event occurs, the other cannot, and vice versa. - **Mutually Exclusive Events**: Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. The occurrence of one event excludes the possibility of the other. Now let's analyze the statement in the problem: \\"Two events being complementary implies that they are mutually exclusive.\\" 1. If two events are complementary, they must be mutually exclusive because they cover all possible outcomes without any overlap; hence, the occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of the other. 2. However, if two events are mutually exclusive, they are not necessarily complementary. For example, consider two events A and B such that A = rolling a 2 on a dice, and B = rolling a 4. These two events are mutually exclusive, as you cannot roll a 2 and a 4 at the same time, but they are not complementary since other outcomes are possible (like rolling a 1, 3, 5, or 6). Based on this information, we can conclude that two events being complementary is a sufficient condition for them to be mutually exclusive, as the occurrence of one complementary event guarantees the non-occurrence of the other. However, it's not a necessary condition, as mutually exclusive events do not need to be complementary to satisfy their definition.

Each city is connected to other cities by roads, and from any city, it is possible to reach any other city by traveling along these roads. We need to prove the existence of a selection of \\"main roads\\" such that each city is connected by an odd number of these main roads. 2. **Step 2: Parity Argument and Matching Theory.**    To approach this problem, let’s look at graph theory. Here, our country with cities and roads can be visualized as a connected, undirected graph (G = (V, E)) with (V) representing the 100 cities and (E) representing the roads. 3. **Step 3: Hamiltonian Path idea.**    Begin by considering a subset of roads such that every city connects to every other city. This implies our graph needs to maintain connectivity. One method is to create pairs of cities, then connect each pair with a unique road. This can be imagined as forming a perfect matching of cities, ensuring there’s a pairing for 50 pairs (since 100 cities). 4. **Step 4: Constructing the odd-degree nodes in the matching.**    For each road in this matched graph, count the paths or \\"routes\\" that pass through them. When constructing these pairings:    - Each individual \\"main route\\" contributes 1 to the parity count of its cities (the endpoints).    - Remaining connections contribute either 0 or 2 because they either do not affect or they preserve the even nature of going in one way and back another.         Thus, when you sum these, each pair contributes an odd number because 1 is odd, and adding 0s or 2s does not change the parity of being odd. 5. **Step 5: Summing the parities.**        Since each city's odd-degree is maintained via this pair-contribution method, and the sum for each city remains an odd number regarding road connections, this meets our requirement. 6. **Step 6: Conclusion.**        By declaring the roads from step 4 as \\"main roads\\", we ensure that each city involves an odd number of these main roads. Therefore, we have shown that it is possible to select roads among the cities such that each city's outgoing roads are odd in count.

The line segments connecting their centers form a right triangle. Find the radius of the smallest circle if the radii of the larger and middle circles are 6 and 4, respectively. 1. Let ( r ) be the radius of the smallest circle.    2. The sides of the triangle formed by connecting the centers of the circles are:    - Distance between the largest circle (radius 6) and the middle circle (radius 4): ( 6 + 4 = 10 )    - Distance between the largest circle (radius 6) and the smallest circle (radius ( r )): ( 6 + r )    - Distance between the middle circle (radius 4) and the smallest circle (radius ( r )): ( 4 + r ) 3. Since the triangle is a right triangle and the side ( 10 ) is the hypotenuse, according to the Pythagorean Theorem, we have:    [    (6 + r)^2 + (4 + r)^2 = 10^2    ] 4.

Because the sequence cycles through the digits completely, each digit appears in the hundreds, tens, and units places once per complete cycle across all terms. Thus, the sum of the tens digits and the hundreds digits are similarly l. Using the structure of every term 100c + 10a + b (cycled from 100a + 10b + c).

Total time over 4 weeks (excluding windows): 35 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 140 minutes We are told that Kitty spends a total of 200 minutes cleaning the living room over 4 weeks. To find out how much time she spends cleaning the windows, we subtract the time spent on other tasks from the total time. Time spent cleaning windows over 4 weeks: 200 minutes (total) - 140 minutes (other tasks) = 60 minutes Since this is the total time spent cleaning the windows over 4 weeks, we need to find out how long it takes her to clean the windows each week. Time spent cleaning windows each week: 60 minutes / 4 weeks = 15 minutes Therefore, it takes Kitty boxed{15}  minutes to clean the windows each week."},{"instruction":"abel wants to partition the set  mathbb{N}  of the positive integers into  n  disjoint sets  A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n} .

If  |A_{j}|=1  for some  j , find the greatest positive integer that may belong to  A_{j} .","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We need to partition the set of positive integers mathbb{N} into n disjoint sets A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n such that for each i with 1 leq i leq n, given any positive integers r, s in A_i with r neq s, we have r + s in A_i. Additionally, we know that |A_j| = 1 for some j. We need to find the greatest positive integer that may belong to A_j. 2. **Analyzing the Condition:**    The condition r + s in A_i for r, s in A_i implies that each A_i must be closed under addition. This means that if A_i contains any two distinct elements, it must contain all their sums, and thus all multiples of their greatest common divisor (gcd). 3. **Implication of Singleton Set:**    Since |A_j| = 1 for some j, let A_j = {k}. This means k is the only element in A_j and no other element can be in A_j. 4. **Partitioning mathbb{N}:**    Since mathbb{N} is partitioned into n disjoint sets, and one of these sets is a singleton, the remaining n-1 sets must cover the rest of mathbb{N}. 5. **Finding the Greatest Singleton:**    To find the greatest positive integer that may belong to A_j, we need to consider the structure of the other sets. If A_i contains more than one element, it must contain all multiples of the gcd of any two of its elements. Therefore, the largest possible singleton k must be such that it cannot be expressed as a sum of any two elements from the other sets. 6. **Using the Frobenius Coin Problem:**    The Frobenius coin problem states that for two coprime integers p and q, the largest integer that cannot be expressed as ap + bq for non-negative integers a and b is pq - p - q. However, since we are dealing with positive integers, we need to consider pq - p - q + 1. 7. **Conclusion:**    Given that |A_j| = 1, the largest integer that cannot be expressed as a sum of any two elements from the other sets must be the largest possible singleton. This is given by the Frobenius number for the remaining sets. The final answer is boxed{n-1}"},{"instruction":"the first quarter, the workforce of Company X is 60% female.

Let's denote this leftmost point as A in M. 3. **Property of Points in M:**    By the problem's condition, each point in M is the midpoint of a segment connecting two other points in M. Therefore, A must be the midpoint of some segment connecting points, say B and C, where B, C in M. 4. **Implication for Point A:**    Given that A is the midpoint of the segment BC, this implies that B and C must be equidistant from A and on opposite sides of A. However, since A is the leftmost point, both B and C must be to the right of A.

The number of correct relationships between A and B is ( ). A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: 4","output":"Given the problem, we analyze the relationship between events A and B step by step. First, we identify the possible outcomes for two coins being tossed. Each coin has two outcomes: facing up (heads) or facing down (tails). Therefore, for two coins, there are 2 times 2 = 4 equally likely outcomes, which are: - Heads-Heads (HH) - Heads-Tails (HT) - Tails-Heads (TH) - Tails-Tails (TT) Event A is defined as \\"Both coins are facing up,\\" which corresponds to the outcome HH. Thus, we can write the set for event A as: [ A = {HH} ] Event B is defined as \\"The two coins are facing the same side,\\" which includes the outcomes HH and TT. Therefore, the set for event B is: [ B = {HH, TT} ] From these definitions, it is clear that every outcome in A is also in B, which means A is a subset of B (A subseteq B). This confirms that statement ① is correct. Next, we consider the complementary event of A, which includes all outcomes not in A. Since A only includes HH, the complementary event of A includes HT, TH, and TT. This shows that the complementary event of A does not match the description given for statement ③, making ③ incorrect. Calculating the probabilities: - The probability of event A, P(A), is the probability of getting two heads, which is frac{1}{4} because there is 1 favorable outcome out of 4 possible outcomes. - The probability of event B, P(B), is the probability of getting two coins facing the same side, which is frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2} because there are 2 favorable outcomes (HH and TT) out of 4 possible outcomes. - The probability of both A and B occurring, P(AB), is the same as the probability of A since A subseteq B, which is frac{1}{4}. Since P(A)P(B) = frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{8} neq P(AB) = frac{1}{4}, statement ④ is incorrect.

We are given that 1/4 of the first solution is replaced by the second solution, which has 31% salt by weight. Let's assume we have 100 grams of the first solution initially. This means we have S grams of salt in it. When we replace 1/4 of this solution with the second solution, we are replacing 25 grams of the first solution with 25 grams of the second solution. The amount of salt in the 25 grams of the second solution is 31% of 25 grams, which is (31/100) * 25 grams. The amount of salt that was in the 25 grams of the first solution that got replaced is (S/100) * 25 grams. After the replacement, the total amount of salt in the new solution is the salt from the remaining 75 grams of the first solution plus the salt from the 25 grams of the second solution.

Since the total weight of the solution is still 100 grams, the total amount of salt should be 16 grams (16% of 100 grams). So we can set up the equation: (S/100) * 75 + (31/100) * 25 = 16 Now we can solve for S: (75S/100) + (775/100) = 16 (75S + 775) = 1600 75S = 1600 - 775 75S = 825 S = 825 / 75 S = 11 Therefore, the percentage of salt in the first solution by weight is boxed{11%} ."},{"instruction":"Let ( f(n) ) be defined such that ( f(0) = 0 ) and ( f(n) = n  f(f(n  1)) ) for ( n = 1, 2, 3, cdots ).

Let the slant height (lateral edge) b = 2. For a regular pyramid, the volume V is given by: V = frac{1}{3} times text{base area} times text{height}. 2. Let's consider a cone that circumscribes the pyramid. If the slant height of the cone is b and the base radius is r, the height of the cone can be expressed as:  h = b sin alpha,  where alpha is the angle between the slant height and the base. 3. Using trigonometric identities, the radius of the cone’s base is expressed as:  r = b cos alpha. 4. The volume of the circumscribing cone is given by:  V_{text{cone}} = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 h.  Substituting the values of r and h: [ V_{text{cone}} = frac{1}{3} pi (b cos alpha)^2 (b sin alpha) = frac{1}{3} pi b^2 cos^2 alpha cdot b sin alpha = frac{1}{3} pi b^3 cos^2 alpha sin alpha. ] 5.

However, since cos alpha = 2 is not possible (as the range of cosine is [-1, 1]), we discard it and consider cos alpha = -frac{2}{3}. Given that alpha in (0, pi), it implies that alpha is in the second quadrant, where cosine is negative and sine is positive.

Assume the angles of the triangle (ABC) are (alpha), (beta), and (gamma), with the ratio ( alpha : beta : gamma = 1 : 2 : 4 ). According to the problem statement, the ratio of the smallest side to the largest side is (BC / AB = a / c = varrho approx 4 / 9). 2. Draw the angle bisector of (beta) as (BB'), where (AB' = b_1) and (B'C = b_2). 3. The triangle (ABB') is isosceles because (beta = 2alpha), hence (beta/2 = alpha). Therefore,    [    cos alpha = frac{AB / 2}{AB'} = frac{c}{2b_1}    ] 4. According to the angle bisector theorem:    [    frac{b_1}{b_2} = frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{varrho}    ] 5. The triangle (BB'C) is similar to triangle (ABC) because the angles at (C) are equal, and (angle CBB' = alpha = angle BAC). Hence,    [    frac{b_2}{a} = frac{a}{b_1 + b_2}    ] 6. Substitute (b_2) with (varrho b_1) based on the previous finding,    [    varrho b_1 left( b_1 + varrho b_1 right) = a^2    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{c}{b_1} = sqrt{1 + frac{1}{varrho}}    ] 7.

For constructing an approximate regular heptagon within a given radius circle: 1. Set the center as (B^{*}),  2.

One of the interesting functions related to primes is pi(n), which counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to ( n ).  Demonstration:  We need to prove that pi(n) geq frac{ln n}{ln 4}. 1. **Conceptual Framework and Elementary Approach by P. Erdős:**    Let us denote ( m ) as a natural number, and we assume that ( k^2 ) is the largest square factor of ( m ), i.e., ( m = k^2 v ). Here, ( v ) is square-free, meaning ( v ) has no repeated prime factors.     Fix a natural number ( n ), and consider the natural numbers ( m leq n ). Represent each ( m = 1, 2, ldots, n ) in the form ( m = k^2 v ), where ( v ) is square-free. Since ( k^2 leq m leq n ), ( k ) can take any value from the set ((1, 2, 3, ldots, leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor)). 2. **Prime Factors Consideration:**    All prime factors of ( v ) must be among ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{pi(n)} ). The number ( v ) thus can be represented as:    [    v = p_1^{alpha_1} cdot p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_{pi(n)}^{alpha_{pi(n)}},    ]    where each ( alpha_i ) is either 0 or 1 because ( v ) is square-free. Thus, there are ( 2^{pi(n)} ) such possible values for ( v ). 3. **Formulation:**    For each ( m = k^2 v ), ( k ) will belong to ( X = (1, 2, ldots, leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor) ). Therefore, the number of such products ( k^2 v ) can be expressed as:    [    [sqrt{n}] times 2^{pi(n)}.    ] 4. **Logic Combining:**    This should cover all integers ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, n ). Thus, the number of such products should be at least ( n ). Therefore:    [    [sqrt{n}] cdot 2^{pi(n)} geqslant n.    ] 5. **Inequality Standardization:**    Noting that (sqrt{n} geqslant [sqrt{n}]) by definition:    [    sqrt{n} cdot 2^{pi(n)} geqslant n.    ]    Dividing both sides by (sqrt{n}):    [    2^{pi(n)} geqslant sqrt{n}.    ] 6. **Taking Logarithm:**        Take the natural logarithm of both sides:    [    pi(n) ln 2 geqslant frac{1}{2} ln n.    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    Solving the above inequality for ( pi(n) ):    [    pi(n) geqslant frac{ln n}{2 ln 2} = frac{ln n}{ln 4}.    ]    Hence, we have proven that:    [    boxed{pi(n) geq frac{ln n}{ln 4}}.    ] This completes the required proof, demonstrating that the number of primes less than or equal to ( n ) is at least ( frac{ln n}{ln 4} )."},{"instruction":"Given that sin alpha is a root of the equation 5x^{2}7x6=0, calculate the value of frac {sin (alpha frac {3}{2}pi)cdot sin ( frac {3}{2}pialpha)cdot tan ^{2}(2pialpha)}{cos ( frac {pi}{2}alpha)cdot cos ( frac {pi}{2}+alpha)cdot cos ^{2}(pialpha)}.","output":"Since sin alpha is a root of the equation 5x^{2}-7x-6=0, it follows that sin alpha = -frac{3}{5} or sin alpha = 2 (discard since sin alpha cannot be greater than 1).

We will show by contradiction that ( U ) in fact contains all street corners.    - Assume indirectly that there exists a street corner ( A ) which is not in ( U ).    - Consider two different paths from ( A ) to a point ( B ) in ( U ). These paths exist by the problem's condition.    - On these paths, let ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) be the closest points in ( U ) to ( A ). Note that ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) might not be distinct and might even coincide with ( B ). 3. Observe that the paths ( AS_1 ) and ( AS_2 ) (between ( A ) and ( S_1 ), and between ( A ) and ( S_2 ) respectively) are not directed.    - Direct the path ( A ) to ( S_1 ) towards ( S_1 ).    - Direct the path from ( S_2 ) to ( A ) towards ( A ). 4. By this construction, we can travel from ( A ) to any point ( B ) in ( U ) via the path ( A S_1 B ), and from any point ( B ) in ( U ) back to ( A ) via the path ( B S_2 A ).    - This implies that all street corners, including ( A ), are connected in ( U ) under the one-way street conditions. 5. This contradiction shows that ( U ) must indeed contain all street corners, meaning all streets in the city can be made one-way such that any corner can reach any other corner.

The remaining tomatoes, which is ( (100 - P)% ) of ( W ), are to be sold at 1.0165 per pound to achieve this profit. The revenue from selling the remaining tomatoes is then ( 1.0165 times (100 - P)% times W ). The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost, so we have: [ 1.0165 times (100 - P)% times W - 0.80W = 0.064W ] Dividing both sides by ( W ) (since ( W ) is not zero) gives us: [ 1.0165 times (100 - P)% - 0.80 = 0.064 ] Now we can solve for ( P ): [ 1.0165 times (1 - frac{P}{100}) = 0.864 ] [ 1.0165 - 0.010165P = 0.864 ] [ 0.010165P = 1.0165 - 0.864 ] [ 0.010165P = 0.1525 ] [ P = frac{0.1525}{0.010165} ] [ P approx 15 ] So, approximately boxed{15}  percent of the tomatoes were ruined and discarded."},{"instruction":"Find the convex pentagons whose sides are, in some order, 1,1, sqrt{2}, 2,2, and whose angles are, in some order, 90^{circ}, 90^{circ}, 90^{circ}, 135^{circ}, 135^{circ}.","output":"We are tasked with finding convex pentagons with side lengths (1, 1, sqrt{2}, 2, 2) and angles (90^{circ}, 90^{circ}, 90^{circ}, 135^{circ}, 135^{circ}).  1. **Positioning the (90^{circ}) Angles:**        Among the three (90^{circ}) angles, at least two of them must be adjacent. Let's label these vertices as (A) and (B) such that (A)'s other neighbor (E) is the vertex with a (135^{circ}) angle. Hence, our task is to determine the placement of the remaining two angles and the remaining side lengths. 2. **Third (90^{circ}) Vertex Analysis:**        The third (90^{circ}) angle should either be at vertex (C) or (D). Since side lengths (BC) and (AE) are parallel (both being perpendicular to (AB)), and considering convexity, vertex (D) must lie between these lines. 3. **Case I: ( angle BCD = 90^{circ} )**    Here, if vertex (D) forms a (90^{circ}) angle with (C) and (E) (i.e., ( angle CDE = 135^{circ} ) and ( angle DEA = 135^{circ} )), then (AB parallel CD) and (E) lies between them.

By drawing parallel lines through (D) to (AB), we intersect (BC) at (G) and (AE) at (H).    In the triangle (DCG), (angle G = 90^{circ}), hence (angle C) must be (45^{circ}), indicating (DG = CG ). Similarly, (E) lies on (AH) and (DH = EH).

Given that the original purchase price is 30 yuan and the original selling price is 40 yuan, the profit per T-shirt without any increase is 40 - 30 = 10 yuan.  However, for every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the sales volume decreases by 10 pieces. Therefore, the profit equation based on the increase x can be established as follows: - The new selling price becomes (40 + x) yuan. - The new sales volume becomes (300 - 10x) pieces. The total profit, therefore, is given by the product of the profit per T-shirt and the number of T-shirts sold, which leads to the equation: [ (x + 40 - 30) times (300 - 10x) = 3360 ] Simplifying the equation: [ (x + 10) times (300 - 10x) = 3360 ] Expanding and simplifying further: [ -10x^2 + 100x + 3000 = 3360 ] [ -10x^2 + 100x - 360 = 0 ] Dividing the entire equation by -10: [ x^2 - 10x + 36 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find: [ x_1 = 2 quad text{or} quad x_2 = 18 ] To reduce inventory as much as possible, we choose the smaller increase in selling price, which is x_1 = 2.

However, since we want the average rate in miles per minute, we need to ensure that our total time is also in minutes.

This is mathematically represented as g(x)_{max} geq f(x)_{max}. First, let's find the maximum value of g(x) = frac{1}{3}x^3 - x^2 + 2. To do this, we calculate the derivative of g(x): [g'(x) = x^2 - 2x = x(x - 2).] By analyzing the derivative, we find: - For x in [-1,0], g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. - For x in [0,1], g'(x) < 0, indicating g(x) is monotonically decreasing in this interval. Thus, the maximum value of g(x) occurs at x=0. Substituting x=0 into g(x), we get: [g(x)_{max} = g(0) = 2.] Next, we need to ensure f(x) leq 2 for all x in (0,1], which translates to: [-ln x + frac{a}{x} - ex + 4 leq 2.] Rearranging the inequality gives us the condition on a: [a leq xln x + ex^2 - 2x.] We analyze the function h(x) = xln x + ex^2 - 2x to determine its behavior. The derivative of h(x) is: [h'(x) = ln x + 2ex - 1.] The second derivative of h(x) is: [h''(x) = frac{1}{x} + 2e > 0,] indicating that h(x) is concave upwards for all x in (0,1], and thus, h'(x) is monotonically increasing throughout this interval. As x to 0^{+}, h'(x) < 0, and at x=1, h'(1) = ln 1 + 2e - 1 = 2e - 1 > 0. Therefore, h'(x) has a unique zero point where it changes sign from negative to positive, indicating the minimum value of h(x) in the interval. Substituting x = frac{1}{e} into h(x), we find: [hleft(frac{1}{e}right) = lnfrac{1}{e} + 2eleft(frac{1}{e}right) - 1 = 0.] This means h(x) decreases until x = frac{1}{e}, then increases thereafter. Therefore, the minimum value of h(x) occurs at x = frac{1}{e}, which is: [hleft(frac{1}{e}right) = -frac{2}{e}.] Consequently, for the condition g(x_2) geq f(x_1) to hold for all x_1 in (0,1] and some x_2 in [-1,1], we require a leq -frac{2}{e}. This gives us the range of a as: [boxed{(-infty, -frac{2}{e}]}]"},{"instruction":"Xiaopang, Xiaodingding, Xiaoya, and Xiaoqiao have a total of 8 parents and 4 children in their four families.

We can analyze this condition for g(x) geq 0 with different intervals of x:    - When x^2-2x=0, i.e., x=0 or x=2, the inequality holds for all a in [2, 3].    - When x^2-2x > 0, i.e., x<0 or x>2, we need 2(x^2-2x)+2 geq 0 to satisfy the condition, giving x<0 or x>2 as the range where the inequality holds.    - When x^2-2x < 0, i.e., 0<x<2, we need 3(x^2-2x)+2 geq 0. Solving this gives us x leq 1-frac{sqrt{3}}{3} or x geq 1+frac{sqrt{3}}{3} within the interval [2, 3] for a.

We are given that 42% of the population are employed males, so 0.42P represents the number of employed males. We are also given that 30% of the employed people are females. This means that 70% of the employed people are males because the percentages must add up to 100%.  Let's denote the number of employed people as EP. Since 70% of the employed people are males, we can write this as 0.70EP. We know that the number of employed males is also 0.42P, so we can set these equal to each other: 0.70EP = 0.42P Now, we want to find E, which is the percent of the population that are employed (EP/P). We can rearrange the equation to solve for EP/P: EP/P = 0.42P / 0.70 Divide both sides by P: EP/P = 0.42 / 0.70 Now, we can calculate the fraction: EP/P = 0.6 So, boxed{60%}  of the population are employed."},{"instruction":"Let ( T ) be the set of all sides and diagonals of a regular hexagon.

Hence, there exists a triangle where the smallest side is the same as the largest side of another triangle.

Did João play his game against Maria?","output":"Part (a) To find the total number of games in a championship with 7 competitors where each competitor plays exactly one game against every other competitor: 1. Denote the players as {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}. 2. Observe that player a plays against the remaining 6 players, forming the pairs: (a, b), (a, c), (a, d), (a, e), (a, f), and (a, g). 3. After counting all games for player a, avoid double-counting by starting with player b and only considering games with b, b plays the 5 pairs: (b, c), (b, d), (b, e), (b, f), and (b, g). 4. Continue this process:    - Player c plays 4 additional games after those counted above: (c, d), (c, e), (c, f), and (c, g).    - Player d has 3 additional games: (d, e), (d, f), and (d, g).    - Player e has 2: (e, f) and (e, g).    - Player f has 1: (f, g). 5.

From the 5 weekly allowance for 8 weeks: 5/week * 8 weeks = 40 From the 6 weekly allowance for 6 weeks: 6/week * 6 weeks = 36 From her aunt's cash gift: 20 Total amount saved: 40 (from 5 allowance) + 36 (from 6 allowance) + 20 (gift) = 96 Now, let's calculate the expected return for each investment option to determine which one has the highest expected return. Option 1 (Guaranteed 5% return): The expected return is simply 5% of the investment amount. Expected return = 5% of 10 = 0.05 * 10 = 0.50 Option 2 (50% chance of 10% return and 50% chance of 2% return): The expected return is the average of the two possible outcomes. Expected return = (0.5 * 10% * 10) + (0.5 * 2% * 10) Expected return = (0.5 * 1) + (0.5 * 0.20) Expected return = 0.50 + 0.10 Expected return = 0.60 Since Option 2 has a higher expected return (0.60) than Option 1 (0.50), Francie decides to invest 10 in Option 2. Now, let's calculate the amount she has left after the investment and the expected return from the investment. Amount after investment: 96 (total savings) - 10 (investment) = 86 Expected return from investment: 0.60 (as calculated above) Amount after expected return: 86 + 0.60 = 86.60 Francie uses half of this amount to buy new clothes: Half for clothes = 86.60 / 2 = 43.30 Amount remaining after buying clothes: 86.60 - 43.30 = 43.30 Now, Francie buys a video game that costs 35: Amount remaining after buying the video game: 43.30 - 35 = 8.30 Francie has boxed{8.30}  remaining after buying the video game."},{"instruction":"Let [x] denote the greatest integer less than or equal to x. For any positive integer n, compute the sum sum_{k=0}^{infty}left[frac{n+2^{k}}{2^{k+1}}right].","output":"1. We begin by considering the behavior of the flooring function (leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor) for non-negative integer values of (k). 2. Notice that for any positive integer (n), when (2^k > n), the term (frac{n}{2^{k+1}} < frac{1}{2}), and therefore (frac{n+2^k}{2^{k+1}} < 1). Consequently, (leftlfloor frac{n+2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = 0) when (2^k > n). 3. This implies that we only need to consider terms where (2^k leq n). We can determine the maximum value of (k) such that (2^k leq n). Let (l = leftlfloor log_2 n rightrfloor). 4. Based on this, we have: [ sum_{k=0}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = sum_{k=0}^{l} leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor. ] 5. Let (a_k = leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor) for (k = 0, 1, ldots, l). Each (a_k) is the largest integer (m) such that: [ m leq frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}}, ] which means: [ 2^{k+1} m - 2^k leqslant n. ] 6. Construct the sequence ({2^k(2m-1)}) where (k = 0, 1, ldots, l), and (m = 1, 2, ldots, a_k). Each (k) corresponds to (a_k) terms in the sequence. Therefore, the number of terms in the sequence is (sum_{k=0}^{l} a_k). 7. Each positive integer (s leq n) can uniquely be represented as (s = 2^k(2m-1)) with (0 leq k leq l) and (1 leq m leq a_k). 8. Hence, (1, 2, ldots, n) each appear exactly once in the sequence ({2^k(2m-1)}), meaning the total number of terms in the sequence is indeed (n). Therefore: [ sum_{k=0}^{l} a_k = n. ] 9. Thus, the sum we are looking for is: [ sum_{k=0}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = n. ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{n} ] # Alternate Approach: 1. Express the integer (n) in binary form as: [ n = a_0 cdot 2^r + a_1 cdot 2^{r-1} + cdots + a_{r-1} cdot 2 + a_r, ] where (a_i = 0) or (1) for (i = 0, 1, ldots, r) and (a_0 neq 0). 2. For the binary representation, we have: [ leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = sum_{j=0}^{r-k} a_j cdot 2^{r-(k+j)}, ] for (k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, r), and (leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = 0) for (k > r). 3. Therefore, the sum becomes: [ sum_{k=0}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = sum_{k=0}^{r} leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor. ] 4. Computation of the sum yields: [ sum_{k=0}^{r} leftlfloor frac{n + 2^k}{2^{k+1}} rightrfloor = a_0 cdot 2^{r} + a_1 cdot 2^{r-1} + cdots + a_{r-1} cdot 2 + a_r = n. ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{n} ] # Yet Another Approach: 1. Use the floor function property ({x} = x - leftlfloor x rightrfloor). 2. Observe: [ leftlfloor frac{1}{2} + left{ frac{x}{2} right} rightrfloor =  begin{cases} 0, & text{if } left{ frac{x}{2} right} < frac{1}{2},  1, & text{if } left{ frac{x}{2} right} geq frac{1}{2}. end{cases} ] 3. It follows that: [ leftlfloor frac{1}{2} + left{ frac{x}{2} right} rightrfloor = left[ 2 left{ frac{x}{2} right} right]. ] Thus, [ leftlfloor frac{1}{2} + frac{x}{2} rightrfloor = left[ 2 left{ frac{x}{2} right} right] + leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor = left[x right] - leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor. ] 4.

This forms the lines ( AM ) and ( BM ). 3. **Second Intersection Points:**    If the line ( AM ) intersects the circle again at a point ( C ), and the line ( BM ) intersects the circle again at a point ( D ), then draw these points. 4. **Utilizing the Orthocenter Theorem:**    According to the Orthocenter Theorem, the altitudes of a triangle intersect at a single point which is the orthocenter of the triangle. 5. **Draw Altitudes:**    The altitudes of the triangle ( AMB ) from vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( M ) intersect at the orthocenter ( H ). First, recognize that the lines ( AD ) and ( BC ) represent the altitudes from ( A ) and ( B ) respectively since they are perpendicular to ( MB ) and ( MA ). 6. **Third Altitude:**    The third altitude of the triangle ( AMB ) must pass through the orthocenter ( H ) and be perpendicular to the base ( AB ). This third altitude can be represented by the line ( MH ). 7. **Conclusion:**    Since ( H ) is the orthocenter, by definition, it lies on the perpendicular from ( M ) to ( AB ). Thus, the line ( MH ) is perpendicular to ( AB ). Hence, using the property that the lines containing the altitudes of a triangle meet at a single point (the orthocenter), we have shown that the perpendicular from point ( M ) to the line containing the diameter ( AB ) can be drawn by constructing the point ( H ) and connecting ( M ) to ( H ).

The time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Monday was longer than the time it took him to drive back from work on Sunday by what percent?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Sunday and Monday, and then find the percent increase from Sunday to Monday. Let's start with Sunday: The total distance Daniel drove is 80 miles at a constant speed of x miles per hour. The time (T) it takes to cover a distance (D) at a constant speed (S) is given by the formula T = D/S. So, the time it took Daniel on Sunday is: T_sunday = D_sunday / S_sunday T_sunday = 80 miles / x mph Now let's calculate the time for Monday: For the first 32 miles, he drove at 2x mph, so the time for the first part is: T_1 = D_1 / S_1 T_1 = 32 miles / (2x mph) T_1 = 32 / (2x) hours T_1 = 16 / x hours For the next 24 miles, he drove at x mph, so the time for the second part is: T_2 = D_2 / S_2 T_2 = 24 miles / x mph T_2 = 24 / x hours For the last 24 miles, he drove at x/2 mph, so the time for the third part is: T_3 = D_3 / S_3 T_3 = 24 miles / (x/2) mph T_3 = 24 / (x/2) hours T_3 = 24 * 2 / x hours T_3 = 48 / x hours The total time for Monday is the sum of the times for each part: T_monday = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 T_monday = (16 / x) + (24 / x) + (48 / x) hours T_monday = (16 + 24 + 48) / x hours T_monday = 88 / x hours Now we have the times for both days: T_sunday = 80 / x hours T_monday = 88 / x hours The difference in time is: Difference = T_monday - T_sunday Difference = (88 / x) - (80 / x) hours Difference = (88 - 80) / x hours Difference = 8 / x hours To find the percent increase, we divide the difference by the original time (Sunday's time) and multiply by 100: Percent increase = (Difference / T_sunday) * 100 Percent increase = ((8 / x) / (80 / x)) * 100 Percent increase = (8 / 80) * 100 Percent increase = 1/10 * 100 Percent increase = 10% So, the time it took Daniel to drive back from work on Monday was longer than the time it took him to drive back from work on Sunday by boxed{10}  percent."},{"instruction":"Given an ellipse E: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0) intersects with two parallel lines l_1: y=x+b and l_2: y=xb at four points A, B, D, C, and the area of quadrilateral ABCD is frac{8b^2}{3}, find the eccentricity of ellipse E.

This is followed by some amount in February and 8 in March. If he continues this saving pattern, his total savings after 6 months will be 126.

According to the pattern, Robi saved: - 2 in January - F in February - 8 in March The pattern seems to be that the amount saved each month is increasing by a fixed amount. Let's call this fixed amount D. So, the savings for the subsequent months would be: - 8 + D in April - 8 + 2D in May - 8 + 3D in June The total savings after 6 months is 126, so we can write the equation: 2 + F + 8 + (8 + D) + (8 + 2D) + (8 + 3D) = 126 Simplifying the equation, we get: 2 + F + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + D + 2D + 3D = 126 Combining like terms, we get: F + 58 + 6D = 126 F + 40 + 6D = 126 Now, let's subtract 40 from both sides to isolate F + 6D: F + 6D = 126 - 40 F + 6D = 86 We know that the difference between the savings of March and January is 6 (8 - 2), which is the same as the difference between the savings of February and March.

Prove that  S_k  does not contain an infinite strictly increasing sequence.","output":"To prove that ( S_k ) does not contain an infinite strictly increasing sequence, we will use mathematical induction. 1. **Base Case (( k = 1 )):**    - For ( k = 1 ), ( S_1 ) consists of the set of numbers of the form ( frac{1}{n} ) where ( n ) is a positive integer.    - Suppose there exists an infinite strictly increasing sequence ( x_n ) in ( S_1 ). This means ( x_n = frac{1}{n_n} ) for some positive integer ( n_n ).    - Since ( x_n ) is strictly increasing, ( frac{1}{n_n} < frac{1}{n_{n+1}} ) for all ( n ). This implies ( n_n > n_{n+1} ), which is a contradiction because ( n_n ) are positive integers and cannot form an infinite decreasing sequence.    - Therefore, ( S_1 ) does not contain an infinite strictly increasing sequence. 2. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume that ( S_l ) does not contain an infinite strictly increasing sequence for some ( l geq 1 ).    - We need to show that ( S_{l+1} ) also does not contain an infinite strictly increasing sequence.    - Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that ( S_{l+1} ) contains an infinite strictly increasing sequence ( y_n ).    - Each ( y_n ) can be written as ( y_n = frac{1}{x_{1,n}} + frac{1}{x_{2,n}} + cdots + frac{1}{x_{l+1,n}} ) where ( x_{1,n}, x_{2,n}, ldots, x_{l+1,n} ) are positive integers.    - Without loss of generality, assume ( x_{1,n} ) is the maximum among ( x_{1,n}, x_{2,n}, ldots, x_{l+1,n} ).    - Since ( y_n ) is strictly increasing, ( y_{n+1} > y_n ) for all ( n ). This implies that at least one of the terms ( frac{1}{x_{1,n}}, frac{1}{x_{2,n}}, ldots, frac{1}{x_{l+1,n}} ) must decrease.    - Assume ( x_{1,n} ) is the term that decreases. Since ( x_{1,n} ) can only take a finite number of values (as it is a positive integer), there must be a subsequence of ( y_n ) where ( x_{1,n} ) is constant.    - Let this subsequence be ( s_n ) where ( x_{1,n} = a ) is constant. Then ( s_n = frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{s_{2,n}} + cdots + frac{1}{s_{l+1,n}} ).    - Define ( t_n = s_n - frac{1}{a} = frac{1}{s_{2,n}} + cdots + frac{1}{s_{l+1,n}} ). Since ( s_n ) is strictly increasing, ( t_n ) must also be strictly increasing.    - However, ( t_n ) is a term in ( S_l ), which contradicts our induction hypothesis that ( S_l ) does not contain an infinite strictly increasing sequence.

We are told that her final balance is 100% of her starting balance, which means her final balance is 125. So, we can set up the equation: (125 + (125 * P/100)) * 0.8 = 125 Now, let's solve for P: 1. First, divide both sides by 125 to simplify the equation: (1 + (1 * P/100)) * 0.8 = 1 2. Now, divide both sides by 0.8: 1 + (1 * P/100) = 1 / 0.8 3. Simplify the right side: 1 + (1 * P/100) = 1.25 4.

Then ( k = 2^t ) for ( t in mathbb{Z}^+ ) (otherwise ( n ) would be divisible by ( 2^q + 1 ), where ( q ) is an odd prime divisor of ( k )). So, ( n = 2^{2^t} + 1 ). Cases ( t = 0, 1 ) are trivial, so we'll assume ( t geq 2 ). For ( m in mathbb{Z} ), we shall denote the remainder of ( m ) ((mathrm{mod} n)) as ( r(m) ). 2. Let ( g ) be an arbitrary primitive root ((mathrm{mod} n)). For ( 0 leq m leq 2^t ), we shall denote ( A_m = {2^{2^t - m}q mid 0 < q leq 2^m, q text{ is odd} } ) and ( B_m = {r(x) mid mathrm{ord}(x) = 2^m} = {r(g^u) mid u in A_m} ). 3. **Lemma 1:** If ( m geq 2 ), then in the set ( B_m ), there are exactly ( 2^{m-2} ) even numbers and ( 2^{m-2} ) odd numbers.    - **Proof:** For every positive odd ( q < 2^{m-1} ), we have ( r(g^{2^{2^t - m}(q + 2^{m-1})}) = r(g^{2^{2^t - m}q}g^{2^{2^t - 1}}) = r(-g^{2^{2^t - m}q}) = n - r(g^{2^{2^t - m}q}) ). So, in the pair ( {r(g^{2^{2^t - m}q}), r(g^{2^{2^t - m}(q + 2^{m-1})})} ), there is one even number and one odd number. But ( B_m ) consists of ( 2^{m-2} ) such pairs. (blacksquare) 4. **Lemma 2:** There exists a function ( f: {2, 4, 6, ldots, 2^{2^t}} rightarrow {1, 2, 3, ldots, 2^{2^t}} ) with the following properties:    - 1) ( f ) is injective;    - 2) ( forall m ), ( f(A_m) = B_m );    - 3) If we construct the oriented graph ( G ) with vertices ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, n-1} ) and oriented edges ( {(m, f(m)) mid m text{ is even} } ), then there would be no oriented cycles.    - **Proof:** We shall construct that function consequently on the sets ( A_m ) using induction by ( m ). Since ( {2, 4, 6, ldots, 2^{2^t}} ) is the union of sets ( A_m ), it's all right.      - At first, ( A_0 = {2^{2^t}} ), ( B_0 = {1} ), ( A_1 = {2^{2^{t-1}}} ), and ( B_1 = {2^{2^t}} ). So, we assume ( f(2^{2^t}) = 1 ) and ( f(2^{2^{t-1}}) = 2^{2^t} ). Three conditions are satisfied, and this is the base of induction.      - Further, if we constructed our function on the sets ( A_0, A_1, ldots, A_{m-1} ), we shall now construct it on the set ( A_m ). At first, we define function ( f ) on ( A_m ) as an arbitrary bijection to ( B_m ). First and second conditions are satisfied (sets ( B_m ) disjoint), but there can be some problems with the third condition. We call the oriented edge ( (s, f(s)) ) (where ( s in A_m )) *bad* if there exists an oriented cycle consisting of this edge. Now we define ( f ) on ( A_m ) as the bijection to ( B_m ) with the minimal number of bad edges. Now we shall prove that there are no bad edges at all (that completes the proof of lemma 2). Let's denote ( C = {s in A_m mid f(s) text{ is odd} } ) and ( D = {s in A_m mid f(s) text{ is even} } ). By lemma 1, ( |C| = |D| = 2^{m-2} ). Edges from ( C ) to ( B_m ) can't be bad (because there are no edges from odd vertices to anywhere, so there can be no oriented cycles with the vertices from ( C )), so the bad edges could only begin in vertices in the set ( D ). Let ( (s, v) ) be one of the bad vertices, ( s in D ). We have ( v notin C ) (otherwise this edge can't be bad), then let's take an arbitrary vertex ( x in C ) with ( f(x) = w ) and redefine our function as ( f(x) = v ) and ( f(s) = w ) (we don't change function on other vertices). Now edge ( (x, v) ) is not bad (because after following the oriented edges, we have this situation: ( x rightarrow v rightarrow ldots rightarrow s rightarrow w ) ( ( w ) is odd), so there are no oriented cycles with this edge), so the number of bad edges has decreased by 1 - a contradiction. (blacksquare) 5. Let's consider our function ( f ) from lemma 2. By lemma 2, the corresponding graph is a union of disjoint oriented paths. Then it is obvious that function ( f ) can be continued to the bijection ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, n-1} rightarrow {1, 2, 3, ldots, n-1} ) such that the corresponding graph would be a simple cycle consisting of all vertices. 6. Now we shall define our permutation with ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( a_{m+1} = f(a_m) ). We're going to prove that this permutation satisfies the condition of the problem. We must prove that for every ( m ), the congruence ( x^{a_m} equiv a_{m+1} (mathrm{mod} n) ) is solvable. If ( a_m ) is odd, this congruence has a solution for any ( a_{m+1} ) (because ( x mapsto x^{2m+1} ) is an automorphism of the group ( mathbb{Z}^*_{n} )). If ( a_m ) is even, then we have the congruence ( x^{2^{2^t - s}q} equiv g^{2^{2^t - s}p} (mathrm{mod} n) ) for some odd ( p ) and ( q ), which is solvable because the congruence ( x^q equiv g^p ) is solvable. Our point is done. 7. **Point \\"if\\":** Now let ( n ) be a composite odd number, and let's assume that such a permutation exists. If ( n ) is divisible by ( p^2 ) for some prime ( p ), then we denote ( a_i = p ) and ( a_j = 2p ). Then obviously ( a_{i-1} = a_{j-1} = 1 ) (because if ( a_{i-1} > 1 ), then ( a_i = g_{i-1}^{a_{i-1}} ) must be divisible by ( p^2 ), in the same way ( a_{j-1} = 1 ) ) - a contradiction. So ( n ) is free from squares and ( n = p_1 p_2 ldots p_m ), ( p_i ) are different prime numbers. If ( a_j ) is even, then ( a_{j+1} ) must be a quadratic residue ((mathrm{mod} p_i)) (or zero) for all ( i ), so ( a_{j+1} ) has only ( frac{p_1 + 1}{2} frac{p_2 + 1}{2} ldots frac{p_m + 1}{2} < frac{2p_1}{3} frac{2p_2}{3} ldots frac{2p_m}{3} leq frac{4}{9} p_1 ldots p_m = frac{4}{9} n < frac{n-1}{2} ), but there are exactly ( frac{n-1}{2} ) even numbers among ( a_j ) - a contradiction. We are done. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, the three interior angles A, B, C form an arithmetic sequence, and (vec{AB}+vec{AC})cdot vec{BC}=0. The shape of triangle ABC is __________.

Since there are only 23 possible residues (0 through 22), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be some residue that appears at least ( leftlceil frac{250}{23} rightrceil = 11 ) times. 2. **Forming sums of four residues:**    We need to show that among these residues, we can find four numbers ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 ) such that their sum minus ( t ) is divisible by 23. This means we need:    [    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 equiv t pmod{23}    ] 3. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:**    Since we have at least 11 occurrences of some residue, let's denote this residue by ( r ). We can choose four of these numbers, all having the same residue ( r ). Thus:    [    a_1 equiv a_2 equiv a_3 equiv a_4 equiv r pmod{23}    ]    Therefore:    [    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 equiv 4r pmod{23}    ] 4. **Adjusting for ( t ):**    We need ( 4r equiv t pmod{23} ). Since ( r ) is a residue modulo 23, ( 4r ) will also be a residue modulo 23. For any integer ( t ), there exists some residue ( r ) such that ( 4r equiv t pmod{23} ). This is because 4 and 23 are coprime, and thus 4 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 23. 5. **Conclusion:**    Since we can always find such a residue ( r ) and we have at least 11 occurrences of some residue, we can always find four numbers among the chosen 250 numbers such that their sum minus ( t ) is divisible by 23.

The tape can go over edges onto adjacent faces but must run parallel to the edges and not hang off the faces. 2. **Visualizing Faces and Transition for Coverage**: A cube has 6 faces. To cover the entire surface, we can divide the task into two parts: covering four faces that form a lateral surface and then the two remaining faces. 3. **Covering the Lateral Surface**:     - We can treat the lateral surface as a rectangle with dimensions n times 4n. Thus, we can cover it by placing n rows of the tape, each of which is 4n cm long.     - Since each row of the tape is 1 cm wide, it will take n strips of the tape to cover this lateral surface. 4. **Covering the Remaining Two Faces**:     - The remaining uncovered faces of the cube would each be n times n.     - We need another n strips to cover these faces.     - Each tape strip here will run parallel to the edge and will be 1 cm wide by n cm long. 5. **Total Count of Required Tape Strips**:     - Summing up, the number of strips needed to cover the lateral surface is n.     - Number of additional strips needed to cover the top and bottom faces is n.     - Therefore, the total number of tape strips required is (n + n = 2n). # Conclusion: Finally, to cover the entire cube without any overhangs and in line with the given constraints, it requires 2n pieces of tape.

Since points (3,0) and (0,1) lie on circle M, we can use these points to find the radius of the circle. The distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates, gives us the radius of the circle. Therefore, we have two expressions for the radius based on these points: 1. The distance between M(a,1-2a) and (3,0): [ sqrt{(a-3)^2 + ((1-2a)-0)^2} ] 2. The distance between M(a,1-2a) and (0,1): [ sqrt{(a-0)^2 + ((1-2a)-1)^2} ] Setting these two expressions equal to each other because they both represent the radius of the circle, we get: [ sqrt{(a-3)^2 + (1-2a)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + (1-2a-1)^2} ] Simplifying both sides leads to the same expression, indicating that the equation is balanced for all values of a. However, to find the specific value of a that satisfies the conditions given (including the points on the circle and the line), we solve for a using the given conditions and find that a=1. Substituting a=1 into M(a,1-2a) gives us the center of the circle as M(1,-1).  The radius of the circle, using either of the distances calculated above with a=1, is sqrt{5}.

We consider these vertices on the integer coordinate grid. 2. **Check the sides**: We need to verify if any of the sides of the triangle align with the grid lines. The sides are:    - From (0,0) to (12,16)    - From (0,0) to (-12,9)    - From (12,16) to (-12,9) 3. **Compute the equations**: Let's find whether any side lies on a grid line coordinate.    - For the side from (0,0) to (12,16), the slope of this line is frac{16-0}{12-0} = frac{4}{3}. The equation of this line is:      [      y = frac{4}{3}x      ]    - For the side from (0,0) to (-12,9), the slope is frac{9-0}{-12-0} = -frac{3}{4}.

All lines contain a functional slope which doesn't represent either horizontal or vertical alignment strictly. 6. **Conclusion**: Based on the verification:    - All sides of the triangle have non-integer slopes and thus do not lie on the grid lines.    - Vertices lie at integer coordinates. Therefore, we conclude that it is indeed possible to arrange a right triangle with integer side lengths such that its vertices lie on the points of a grid without any side aligning with the grid lines. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Let OAPB be a rectangle in the xyplane with vertices O(0,0),A(2,0),P(2,3),B(0,3).

Let's identify the line with the real number line, and for a given segment ( s ), denote its rearranged counterpart as ( s' ). Let ( S ) be the system of the given finite segments, and let ( S' ) denote the new system after rearrangement. Furthermore, let ( t(S) ) represent the total length of the union of segments forming ( S ).  # Steps: 1. **Setting the problem structure**:        It's sufficient to prove this statement for segment systems ( S ) where the union ( U(S) ) is connected. If ( S = S_1 cup S_2 cup ldots cup S_k ), where ( U(S_1), U(S_2), ldots, U(S_k) ) are pairwise disjoint unions, then based on the connected case:        t(S) = t(S_1) + t(S_2) + ldots + t(S_k) geq t(S_1') + t(S_2') + ldots + t(S_k') geq t(S')        Since the total length of the union of segments cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the segments, it follows for each ( S_i ). 2. **Assuming connected union**:        Assume ( U(S) = [a, b] ). We need to show that ( t(S') leq t([a, b]) = b - a ). Let ( a' ) and ( b' ) denote the smallest and largest elements of ( U(S') ), respectively. Hence, it's sufficient to show ( b' - a' leq b - a ).    Suppose ( s in S ) is such that the left endpoint of ( s' ) is ( a' ), and ( u in S ) is such that the right endpoint of ( u' ) is ( b' ). If ( s = u ), then ( U(S') = s' ), and since ( s' ) is congruent to ( s ), the statement is evident as ( s subseteq U(S) ). Hence, assume ( s neq u ). 3. **Working with minimal intervals**:        Let ( [c, d] ) be the shortest interval that contains the union of segments ( s ) and ( u ). Therefore, ( a leq c leq d leq b ), meaning we need to show ( b' - a' leq d - c ). This boils down to the given problem's special case when ( S ) consists of just two segments ( s ) and ( u ). 4. **Generalizing for two segments**:    Consider two segments ( s ) and ( u ) with lengths ( alpha ) and ( beta ) respectively, and let ( varrho ) be the distance between their midpoints. Reflect the segments around the midpoint of the line segment joining their midpoints, without loss of generality, suppose the left endpoint of ( s ) is ( c ).    If ( u ) is not within ( s ), its right endpoint is ( d ). Let ( y ) be the right endpoint of ( s ), and ( x ) be the left endpoint of ( u ). Therefore,     - ( alpha = y - c )    - ( beta = d - x )        Thus,        d - c = (d - x) + (x - y) + (y - c) = (alpha + beta) + (x - y) quad Rightarrow quad x - y = d - c - (alpha + beta)        Now,        varrho = left| frac{x + d}{2} - frac{c + y}{2} right| = frac{1}{2} left| (alpha + beta) + 2(x - y) right| = frac{1}{2} left| (alpha + beta) + 2(x - y) right|        Since ( d - c geq alpha ) or ( beta ),        varrho = (d - c) - frac{alpha + beta}{2}        So, we have,        d - c = varrho + frac{alpha + beta}{2}     5. **Summing it up**:    It follows that the sum of positive numbers ( x - c ) and ( d - y ) is at least the absolute value of their difference,        (x - c) + (d - y) geq |(x - c) - (d - y)|        Thus,        2varrho = (x + d) - (c + y) geq | (alpha - beta) |        - **Special case**: If ( u ) is within ( s ), ( s ) is just ( [c, d] ), and ( x ) and ( y ) are the endpoints of ( u ),            d - c = alpha = max {alpha, beta }          Therefore,        2 varrho = (d + c) - (x + y) leq (d - c) - (y - x) = alpha - beta = | alpha - beta |     6. **Using Monotonicity**:    Generally,        d - c = begin{cases}    varrho + frac{alpha + beta}{2}, & text{if } |alpha - beta| leq 2varrho     max {alpha, beta}, & text{if } |alpha - beta| geq 2 varrho    end{cases}        Hence, ( f(varrho) = d - c ) is a monotonically increasing function of ( varrho ).

The second half of the distance is also D/2 km, and at a speed of 25 kmph, the time taken to cover this distance is (D/2) / 25 hours.

Since m(widehat{PAC}) = m(widehat{PCB}), we have angle CBT = angle CAT = angle PCB. This implies that BT parallel PC because corresponding angles are equal. 7.

Since T lies on the circumcircle, angle BCT = angle BAP (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem). 10. Hence, angle ECQ = 180^circ - angle BAP.

For x = -1, substituting into the quadratic function gives m = a(-1)^2 - 2a(-1) + 1 = a + 2a + 1.

If the probability the three new numbers still sum to  100  is  tfrac{m}{n} , where  m  and  n  are relatively prime positive integers, compute  100m+n . *Proposed by Aaron Lin*","output":"1. Let the three numbers be (a, b, c) such that (a + b + c = 100). We can express each number as (a = a' + a''), (b = b' + b''), and (c = c' + c''), where (a', b', c') are integers and (a'', b'', c'') are the fractional parts satisfying (|a''| leq 0.5), (|b''| leq 0.5), and (|c''| leq 0.5). 2. The sum of the fractional parts must satisfy:    [    a'' + b'' + c'' = 0    ]    This is because the sum of the original numbers is an integer (100), and the sum of the integer parts (a' + b' + c') must also be 100. 3. For the rounded numbers to sum to 100, the sum of the fractional parts must be such that the rounding does not change the total sum. This means that the sum of the fractional parts must be zero, and each fractional part must be within ([-0.5, 0.5]). 4. Consider the possible values of (a'', b'', c''). Since (a'' + b'' + c'' = 0), we can have:    [    a'' = x, quad b'' = y, quad c'' = -x - y    ]    where (x, y in [-0.5, 0.5]). 5. The condition for the sum of the rounded numbers to be 100 is that the sum of the fractional parts after rounding must be zero. This means:    [    text{round}(a'') + text{round}(b'') + text{round}(c'') = 0    ] 6. The rounding function (text{round}(x)) rounds (x) to the nearest integer. For (x in [-0.5, 0.5]), (text{round}(x)) is 0 if (|x| < 0.5), and (text{round}(x)) is (pm 1) if (x = pm 0.5). 7. To satisfy (text{round}(a'') + text{round}(b'') + text{round}(c'') = 0), the possible combinations of ((a'', b'', c'')) are:    - All three fractional parts are within ([-0.5, 0.5)), so they round to 0.    - Two fractional parts are (pm 0.5) and the third is 0. 8. The probability of each combination can be calculated by considering the volume of the region in the ((x, y))-plane that satisfies the conditions. The total volume of the cube ([-0.5, 0.5]^3) is 1. 9. The volume of the region where all three fractional parts are within ([-0.5, 0.5)) is:    [    text{Volume} = 1    ] 10. The volume of the region where two fractional parts are (pm 0.5) and the third is 0 is:     [     text{Volume} = 3 times left(frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times 1right) = frac{3}{4}     ] 11. The total volume of the valid region is:     [     text{Total Volume} = 1 + frac{3}{4} = frac{7}{4}     ] 12. The probability that the rounded numbers sum to 100 is:     [     P = frac{text{Total Volume}}{text{Volume of the cube}} = frac{frac{7}{4}}{1} = frac{7}{4}     ] 13. Since the probability must be a fraction (frac{m}{n}) in simplest form, we have (m = 7) and (n = 4). 14.

First, we calculate the difference inside the parentheses:    [    1,500,000 - 674,992 = 825,008     ] 3. Next, we calculate 20% of this difference:    [    0.2 times 825,008 = 165,001.6     ] 4. Now, subtract the 20% value from the difference:    [    text{Net Profit} = 825,008 - 165,001.6 = 660,006.4 text{ rubles}     ] 5. Then, let's calculate the total payments on the principal of the loan for the year 2018. This is given by:    [    text{Total Loan Payments} = 23,914 times 12 - 74,992     ] 6. Calculate the annual payment:    [    23,914 times 12 = 286,968     ] 7. Subtract the specified value:    [    286,968 - 74,992 = 211,976 text{ rubles}     ] 8. Next, we consider the net profit after subtracting the total loan payments, to establish the profits available for dividend distribution:    [    text{Profits for Dividends} = 660,006.4 - 211,976 = 448,030.4     ] 9. Since there are 1000 shares, we calculate the dividend per share:    [    text{Dividend per share} = frac{448,030.4}{1000} = 448.0 text{ rubles}     ] 10. Finally, the problem asks to find out the total dividends received by the General Director who owns 550 shares. Thus,     [     text{Director's Dividends} = 448.0 times 550 = 246,400.0 text{ rubles}      ] Conclusion: [ boxed{246,400.0} ]"},{"instruction":"A man sold 20 articles for 60 and gained 20%.

Specifically, this condition is equivalent to:    [    v_t(P(k)) = k    ]    for each ( k = 0, 1, ldots, m ). 3. **Constructing the Polynomial:**    To construct such a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( n ), we can use Lagrange Interpolation. Choose ( a_i ) such that ( v_t(a_i) = i ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, n ). Then, construct ( P(x) ) such that:    [    P(i) = a_i quad text{for all } i leq n    ]    This ensures that ( v_t(P(i)) = i ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, n ). 4. **Inductive Proof:**    We need to show that ( m ) cannot exceed ( n ). We use induction on ( n ).    - **Base Case:**      For ( n = 1 ), consider a polynomial ( P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x ). We need ( v_t(a_0) = 0 ) and ( v_t(a_1) = 1 ). This polynomial satisfies the condition for ( k = 0 ) and ( k = 1 ). Thus, ( m = 1 ).    - **Inductive Step:**      Assume that for a polynomial of degree ( n ), ( m ) cannot exceed ( n ). Now consider a polynomial ( Q(x) ) of degree ( n+1 ) for which ( m ) can be more than ( n+1 ). Define the first-order difference ( Delta_1(x) = Q(x+1) - Q(x) ).

For ( Delta_1(x) ), we have:      [      v_t(Delta_1(k)) = k quad text{for all } 0 leq k leq n+1      ]      This implies that ( Delta_1(x) ) satisfies the condition for ( m = n+1 ), which contradicts our inductive hypothesis that ( m ) cannot exceed ( n ) for a polynomial of degree ( n ). 5. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the largest ( m ) for which there exists a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( n ) with the given property is ( n ).

The statements given by A and B are: 1. A: B is a knight. 2. B: A is not a knight. Since each person can either be a knight (who always tells the truth), a liar (who always lies), or a normal person (who can either tell the truth or lie), we'll analyze the cases step-by-step. 1. **Assume A is telling the truth**: In this case, according to A's statement, B is a knight.     - If B is a knight, B must tell the truth. According to B's statement, A is not a knight.     - This contradicts our assumption that A is telling the truth because a knight cannot lie about A not being a knight if A is truly a knight. 2. **Assume A is lying**: In this scenario, A's statement about B being a knight is false. Therefore, B is not a knight.     - Since B is not a knight, B has two options: B can either be a liar or a normal person who is telling the truth or lying.      - The statement B makes is that A is not a knight. If B is lying, then A is a knight.     - If B is telling the truth, then A is not a knight. 3. **Analyze consequence if B is a Liar**:      - In this case, B's statement \\"A is not a knight\\" would be a lie, which means A must be a knight.     - This contradicts the original situation where if A were a knight, B's statement would imply that A is not a knight, creating another contradiction.      4. **Analyze consequence if B is a normal person telling the truth**:     - Here, B's statement \\"A is not a knight\\" must be true, meaning A is not a knight.     - Since A isn't a knight, A must either be a liar or a normal person.     - A’s initial statement \\"B is a knight\\" remains false. If A were a liar, this would be consistent with A lying about B’s status as a knight and would still hold if A were normal and lying. Thus, this exposition guarantees that: - B is not a knight. - A could either be a liar or normal person who lies or tells the truth inconsistently. - B might tell the truth but cannot be a knight (otherwise would create logical contradiction).

This means AB leq h because T is the minimal equilateral triangle circumscribing K. 3. **Case when AB = h**:     - Consider the case where the distance between A and B is exactly h.     - In this situation, the point A must coincide with one vertex of the triangle T due to symmetry and the equilateral property. 4. **Triangle angles**:     - Since T is equilateral, each internal angle is 60^circ.      - Additionally, the angle formed by any segment formed by the arcs of K at point A cannot exceed 60^circ. Specifically, for a pi-curve, we refer to each half of the chord-subtended angles at A and B being 30^circ or less with respect to the straight line segment AB. 5. **Sliding of the points**:     - As A and B move, they must slide along sides of T.

Reflect point T across line MG to obtain point (U).    - **Reflection Across a Perpendicular Bisector**:      - Reflect each point over the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the other two points. Again, there are three perpendicular bisectors:        1. Perpendicular bisector of the segment (GT) (connects the midpoint of (GT)). Reflect point M to get point (U).        2. Perpendicular bisector of the segment (MT). Reflect point G to get point (U).        3. Perpendicular bisector of the segment (MG). Reflect point T to get point (U). 4. **Count of Unique Symmetry Points**:    - In total, we calculate six distinct points of symmetry (three by direct reflection over lines and three by perpendicular bisectors). 5. **Special Case for Right-Angle Triangle**:    - If (M), (G), and (T) form a right-angled triangle, the perpendicular bisectors or reflections might coincide, leading to fewer distinct points. In such a special case, there will only be five distinct points because two of the bisectors or reflections might overlap and give the same point.  # Conclusion: Based on the above analysis, if (M), (G), and (T) form a general triangle (not a right-angled triangle), there will be 6 distinct points U. However, if they form a right-angled triangle, there could be some overlap, resulting in only 5 distinct points.

The property of an ellipse states that for any point (P) on the ellipse, the sum of the distances to the two foci is constant, i.e., ( PH + PO = text{constant} ). 3. **Reflection Method:**    To determine such an ellipse which is tangent to the sides of the triangle, consider the reflection of the orthocenter (H) across the side (AC) (without loss of generality). Let the reflected point be (H_B). 4. **Properties of Ellipse and Reflection:**    Reflecting (H) over the side (AC) will result in point (H_B). From the properties of reflection:    [    text{If a point (P) is on the side (AC), then the distance sum (PH + PO)} = text{PH}_Btext{ + PO}.    ]    By the definition of reflection, any point on (AC) maintains equidistance between the original point and its reflection. 5. **Introducing Touch Point (E):**    For the required ellipse to be tangent to (AC) at point (E), the sum (HE + EO) (distance from orthocenter to (E) plus distance from (E) to circumcenter) should be minimized. This is the crucial condition of the ellipse we are constructing. 6. **Minimization Condition:**    The minimization occurs when (H_B, E,) and (O) are collinear. Thus, (E) should be the point of intersection of the line segment (H_B O) with the line (AC). 7. **Formation of Specific Points:**    Known property states that reflecting the orthocenter (H) across any side of an acute-angled triangle lands the reflection on the circumcircle of the triangle. This forms:    [    H_B E + EO = r,    ]    where (r) is the constant sum. 8. **Ellipse Dimension:**    As a result, the constructed ellipse, having (H) and (O) as foci and being tangent to all three sides of the triangle, will have the major axis length (2a = r). This can similarly be validated for the other sides, ensuring consistency.    Similar process for sides (AB) and (BC) shows similar ellipses intersect similarly.

Since a = -2 < 0, this indicates that the parabola opens downwards. Therefore, we can conclude that the parabola has a highest point due to the negative coefficient of the quadratic term. This highest point is also known as the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form of a parabola is given by y = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) are the coordinates of the vertex. In our case, the parabola is already in vertex form, with h = -1 and k = -3. Thus, the coordinates of the vertex are: boxed{text{high}, left(-1,-3right)} Next, we consider the effect of shifting this parabola 2 units to the left and then 4 units up. Shifting a parabola to the left involves adding to the x-coordinate of the vertex, and shifting it up involves adding to the y-coordinate. Therefore, shifting the parabola 2 units to the left changes the x-coordinate of the vertex from -1 to -1 + 2 = 1, and shifting it 4 units up changes the y-coordinate from -3 to -3 + 4 = 1. However, the correct calculation for shifting 2 units to the left actually involves subtracting 2 from the x-coordinate, leading to a new x-coordinate of -1 - 2 = -3.

A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Given that the number is composed only of the digits 0 and 1, in order for the sum of its digits to be a multiple of 9, we consider the sum derived solely from the digit 1 (since 0 contributes nothing to the sum). 2.

Her weight after this loss: 87 + x - 36. 4. Finally, she gained back half of a dozen pounds. Half of a dozen is 6, so she gained back 6 pounds.    Her final weight after this gain: 87 + x - 36 + 6. We know her final weight was 81 pounds, so we can set up the equation: 87 + x - 36 + 6 = 81 Now, let's solve for x: 87 + x - 30 = 81 x + 57 = 81 x = 81 - 57 x = 24 pounds. So, Mary added back 24 pounds after initially losing 12 pounds.

Combine and simplify:    [    2 sqrt{3} - 3 = x sqrt{3} + y sqrt{3} - 2 sqrt{3 x y}    ] 6. Factor out (sqrt{3}) from the terms involving (sqrt{3}):    [    2 sqrt{3} - 3 = sqrt{3} (x + y) - 2 sqrt{3 x y}    ] 7. Combine terms involving (sqrt{3}):    [    (x + y - 2)sqrt{3} = 2 sqrt{3 x y} - 3    ] 8. To isolate the rational terms, let's square both sides again since the terms are rational (due to the initial problem condition that (x, y in mathbb{Q})):    [    left( (x+y-2) sqrt{3} right)^2 = left( 2 sqrt{3 cdot xy} - 3 right)^2    ] 9. Simplifying these terms we get:    [    (x+y-2)^2 cdot 3 = (2 sqrt{3xy} - 3)^2    ] 10. Expand both sides:     [     (x+y-2)^2 cdot 3 = 4 cdot 3xy - 12 sqrt{3xy} cdot 3 + 9       ] 11. Simplifying further:     [     3 (x + y - 2)^2 = 12xy - 12 sqrt{3xy} + 9     ] 12. Since (sqrt{3xy}) must be rational for the equality to hold (and it’s rational because (x, y in mathbb{Q})), the only possibility is to set the coefficients of (sqrt{3}) equal on both sides or equate the rational components independently:     [     3(x+y-2)^2 = 9 + 12xy - 12 sqrt{3xy}     ]     This requires that the rational parts stand equal as:     [     3(x + y - 2)^2 = 9 + 12xy - 12 sqrt{3xy}     ] 13. For the equation to hold, each component of the terms must independently hold that:     [     x + y - 2 = 0     ]     [     2 sqrt{3xy} - 3 = 0     ] 14. Solving for (x + y - 2 = 0):     [     x + y = 2     ] 15. Solving (2 sqrt{3xy} - 3 = 0 ):     [     2 sqrt{3xy} = 3      ]     [     sqrt{3xy} = frac{3}{2}     ]     [     3xy = left( frac{3}{2} right)^2      ]     [     3xy = frac{9}{4}     ]     [     xy = frac{3}{4}     ] 16. Therefore, (x) and (y) must be roots of the quadratic equation:     [     t^2 - 2t + frac{3}{4} = 0     ] 17. Solving the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:     [     t = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 - 3}}{2}     ]     [     t = frac{2 pm sqrt{1}}{2}      ]     [     t = frac{2 + 1}{2} quad text{or} quad t = frac{2 - 1}{2}      ]     [     t = frac{3}{2} quad text{or} quad t = frac{1}{2}      ] 18. Since (x > y), the solution is:     [     x = frac{3}{2}, quad y = frac{1}{2}     ] 19.

This is because the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two consecutive integers is always 1. Let's provide a proof for this statement:      - Let k and k+1 be two consecutive integers.      - Suppose d is a common divisor of both k and k+1.      - Since d divides both k and k+1, d must also divide the difference (k+1) - k = 1.      - Therefore, d=1, meaning the gcd of k and k+1 is 1. 2. **Partition the Set**:    - Consider the set {1, 2, ldots, 2n}.    - Partition this set into n pairs of consecutive integers: {1, 2}, {3, 4}, ldots, {2n-1, 2n}.      - Each pair consists of two consecutive integers, which we know are relatively prime. 3. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**:    - We have n pairs but n+1 integers chosen from the set {1, 2, ldots, 2n}.    - By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we place more items into a number of containers than there are containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.    - Here, the \\"items\\" are the n+1 distinct integers, and the \\"containers\\" are the n pairs. 4. **Conclusion**:    - Since we have n+1 integers but only n pairs, at least one pair will contain two of these chosen integers.    - Since each pair consists of two consecutive numbers, by Step 1, these two integers within the pair are relatively prime. Therefore, among any n+1 distinct integers from the set {1, 2, ldots, 2n}, there must exist at least two that are relatively prime. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) be the roots of the equation ( x^2  6x + 1 = 0 ).

Find the minimum value of its perimeter.","output":"1. **Given Conditions**:    - Triangle ( triangle ABC ) with integral side lengths    - Given angle relationship: ( angle A = 3 angle B ) 2. **Using the Sine Rule**:    According to the sine rule, in any triangle, the ratio of side lengths to the sine of their opposite angles is constant:    [    frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}    ] 3. **Sine of Triple Angle**:    Using the angle relationship ( angle A = 3 angle B ) and the triple angle formula for sine, we have:    [    sin 3B = 3 sin B - 4 sin^3 B    ]    Thus:    [    frac{a}{b} = frac{sin 3B}{sin B} = 3 - 4 sin^2 B    ] 4. **Relating Cosines**:    Using ( cos^2 B = 1 - sin^2 B ), we get:    [    4 cos^2 B - 1 = 4(1 - sin^2 B) - 1 = 3 - 4 sin^2 B    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{a}{b} = 4 cos^2 B - 1    ] 5. **C-Sine Rule**:    Similarly, for angle ( angle C ):    [    angle C = 180^circ - angle A - angle B = 180^circ - 3 angle B - angle B = 180^circ - 4 angle B    ]    So:    [    sin C = sin (180^circ - 4 angle B) = sin 4 angle B    ]    Using the quadruple angle formula for sine:    [    sin 4B = 8 cos^3 B - 4 cos B    ]    Thus:    [    frac{c}{b} = frac{sin 4B}{sin B} = frac{8 cos^3 B - 4 cos B}{sin B} = 8 cos^3 B - 4 cos B    ] 6. **Rationalizing Cosine**:    Let ( 2 cos B = frac{p}{q} ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime integers. Then:    [    cos B = frac{p}{2q}    ] 7. **Expressing (a, b, c) in Terms of (p) and (q)**:    Using the previous results:    [    frac{a}{b} = 4 left( frac{p}{2q} right)^2 - 1 = frac{4p^2}{4q^2} - 1 = frac{p^2 - q^2}{q^2}    ]    [    a = b cdot frac{p^2 - q^2}{q^2} = frac{b (p^2 - q^2)}{q^2}    ]    Similarly:    [    frac{c}{b} = frac{8 left( frac{p}{2q} right)^3 - 4 left( frac{p}{2q} right)}{1} = frac{p^3}{q^3} - 2 frac{p}{q}    ]    [    c = b cdot left( frac{p^3 - 2pq^2}{q^3} right)    ] 8. **Identifying Minimum Perimeter**:    Let's find minimal coprime positive integer values of ( p ) and ( q ).    From ( cos B = frac{p}{2q} ), to ensure ( sqrt{2} < 2 cos B < 2 ), we see that:    [    1 < frac{p}{q} < 2    ]    The smallest such pairs are ( p = 3 ) and ( q = 2 ). Therefore, we get:    [    b = q^3 = 2^3 = 8    ]    [    a = (3^2 - 2^2) cdot 2 = (9 - 4) cdot 2 = 5 cdot 2 = 10    ]    [    c = 3^3 - 2 cdot 3 cdot 2^2 = 27 - 24 = 3    ] 9. **Calculating Perimeter**:    Now, add the sides to find the perimeter:    [    a + b + c = 10 + 8 + 3 = 21    ] # Conclusion: (boxed{21}) Thus, the minimum value of the perimeter is ( boxed{21} )."},{"instruction":"Which of the following options is on the same side of the line 2x  y + 1 = 0 as the point (1, 2)?

Minimum Number of Coins: To minimize the number of coins, Paul should try to use the coin with the highest value first. The highest value coin available is the 50-cent coin.  1. **Using a 50-cent coin**: This leaves him with 60 - 50 = 10 cents to pay. 2. **Using a 10-cent coin**: After using one 50-cent coin, he can use one 10-cent coin to pay the remaining 10 cents. Thus, the minimum number of coins Paul can use is 1 (for the 50-cent coin) + 1 (for the 10-cent coin) = 2 coins.  Maximum Number of Coins: To maximize the number of coins, Paul should use the coin with the lowest value, which is the 5-cent coin. 1. **Using 5-cent coins**: Since each coin is worth 5 cents, to make up 60 cents, he would need frac{60}{5} = 12 coins. Thus, the maximum number of coins Paul can use is 12 coins.  Difference Between Maximum and Minimum: The difference between the largest and smallest number of coins Paul can use is 12 - 2 = 10.

Place one circle (Circle A) in a fixed position. 2. **Rotating Circle B**:    We will now rotate the second circle (Circle B) around its center. Each time a marked point on Circle A aligns with a point on Circle B, this alignment corresponds to a position on the circumference of Circle B. 3. **Marking the Points**:    Suppose Circle A has 100 marked points. These points will map to positions along the circumference of Circle B. As Circle B rotates, we keep track of these alignments. 4. **Painting Arc Segments**:    On each alignment, if a marked point on Circle A (e.g., point P) coincides with an arc segment on Circle B that is smaller than 1 cm in total length, we instruct a painter to mark that specific point. This process effectively *paints* the portion of Circle B highlighted by this alignment. 5. **Cumulative Effect over Full Rotation**:    After one full rotation of Circle B:    - Since the total length of the arc segments that can be painted is less than 1 cm, and since there are 100 such marked points on Circle A, each contributing less than 1 cm of painted arc on Circle B per rotation, the total painted length stays less than 100 cm.    - Mathematically, we conclude:      [      text{Total painted length} < 100 times 1 text{ cm} = 100 text{ cm}      ] 6. **Dirichlet's Principle Application**:    By Dirichlet’s principle or the pigeonhole principle, since we have fewer than 100 cm of painted arcs, it is impossible for every marked point on Circle A to coincide with a painted arc on Circle B simultaneously in any single alignment. # Conclusion: Since less than 100 cm out of the total 100 cm of circumference can be painted, there will always be at least one configuration where at least one marked point on Circle A avoids the painted arcs on Circle B.

Next, consider ( frac{(x^2 + y^2)^2}{2} geq (x^2 + y^2) x y ): [ (x^2 + y^2)^2 geq 2 (x^2 + y^2) x y ] This can be rewritten as: [ x^4 + y^4 + 2x^2 y^2 geq 2 x^2 y^2 + 2 x y (x^2 + y^2) ] Which simplifies straightforwardly by combining like terms. 3.

Let's break down the claims and provide a rigorous proof for each part.  Part (a): **Claim:** If we construct the polar angle S a^{prime} b^{prime} c^{prime} relative to S a b c, then the angle S a b c is polar to S a^{prime} b^{prime} c^{prime}. 1. **Identifying Orthogonal Components:**     - The given external normals a^{prime}, b^{prime}, c^{prime} are perpendicular to the respective planes:       [       begin{aligned}       &a^{prime} perp b, quad a^{prime} perp c,        &b^{prime} perp c, quad b^{prime} perp a,        &c^{prime} perp a, quad c^{prime} perp b.       end{aligned}       ]      2. **Establishing Perpendicular Relations:**     - From the given perpendicular relationships, we can deduce:       [       begin{aligned}       &a perp b^{prime}, quad a perp c^{prime},        &b perp c^{prime}, quad b perp a^{prime},        &c perp a^{prime}, quad c perp b^{prime}.       end{aligned}       ]      3. **Concluding the Polarity:**     - Due to the orthogonal properties mentioned, the angle S a b c turns out to be the polar angle to S a^{prime} b^{prime} c^{prime}. Thus, we have shown that S a b c is indeed the polar angle of S a^{prime} b^{prime} c^{prime}.  Part (b): **Claim:** The sum of the plane angle at aSb of the given trihedral angle with the dihedral angle at the edge Sc^{prime} in the polar angle equals 180^circ. 1. **Analyzing the Trihedral Angle Setup:**     - Recall the setup from Problem 10 (referenced):       [       text{Relationship between dihedral angle } alpha text{ and the linear angle } b^{prime} widehat{S c^{prime}}.       ] 2. **Using the Known Formula:**     - The problem references a fundamental formula obtained in Problem 10, regarding the sum of the dihedral angle and its associated angles:       [        alpha_D + alpha_L = pi,       ]       where alpha_D is the dihedral angle at an edge and alpha_L is the linear angle between the normals. 3. **Application of the Formula:**    - For our specific case, summing the given plane angle (aSb) and the dihedral angle at (Sc^{prime}):       [       alpha_{aSb} + angle(b^{prime} widehat{S c^{prime}}) = pi = 180^circ.       ] This confirms the given statement in the problem. **Conclusion:** From analyzing both parts, we have demonstrated rigorously the perpendicular properties leading to polarity and the sum angles giving 180^circ.

Based on the contradictions observed in both cases, it is concluded that there does not exist an infinite sequence of prime numbers ( p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots ) such that ( p_{k+1} = 5p_{k} + 4 ) for ( k=1,2,ldots ).

The oriented angle is measured modulo ( 180^circ ). This allows us to consider the angles in the range ([0^circ, 180^circ]).  Consider the intersections of circles ( O_i ) as follows: 1. For any two circles (O_i) and (O_{i+1}), let ( A_i ) be their second intersection point besides ( O ). 2. We start with an arbitrary point ( B_1 ) on the circle ( O_1 ), and construct the points ( B_2, B_3, ldots, B_n ) as described in the problem. We claim that after constructing the points this way, the final point ( B_{n+1} ) on the circle ( O_1 ) coincides with the initial point ( B_1 ). We proceed with the proof as follows: 1.

Notice that every oriented angle between consecutive lines stays constant as a consequence of the construction of points ( B_i ) through their intersections and directed straight lines starting from ( B_i ) passing through ( A_i ). 3. Finally, we return to the first circle ( O_1 ):    [    angle(B_1 A_1, A_1 O) = angle(B_1 A_n, A_n O)    ] 4. Since the angles between the segments are preserved, and since the lines defined by ( B_i ) and ( A_i ) must align eventually due to the angles' consistency, ( A_n ) and ( B_1 ) must align such that:    [    angle(B_n A_n, A_n O) = angle(B_1 A_n, A_n O)    ]    This ultimately means that the points ( A_n, B_1 ), and ( B_n ) are collinear, and thus ( B_{n+1} ) must coincide with ( B_1 ).

From sin x = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we know that x could be in the first or second quadrant where the values of sin are positive. In these quadrants, cos x can be positive (first quadrant) or negative (second quadrant). Since tan x = frac{sin x}{cos x}, we find that tan x could be frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} = 1 or frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} = -1.

Let ( r_1, r_2, dots, r_{2000} ) be the (not necessarily real) roots of the polynomial ( f(x) ). We start by analyzing the polynomial ( f(x^2 - 1) ).

Given that ( f(x^2 - 1) ) has exactly 3400 real roots, and each quadratic factor ( x^2 - 1 - r_i ) can contribute at most 2 real roots, there must be at least 1700 values of ( r_i ) such that ( r_i geq -1 ). Let us denote this set of roots as ( S_1 ). 3. Next, consider the polynomial ( f(1 - x^2) ).

To find the intersection of these sets, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:    [    |S_1 cup S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| - |S_1 cap S_2|    ]    Since the total number of roots is 2000, we have:    [    2000 geq 1700 + 1350 - |S_1 cap S_2| quad Rightarrow quad |S_1 cap S_2| geq 1050    ]    Therefore, there are at least 1050 roots in the interval ((-1, 1)). 6. To conclude, we divide the interval ((-1, 1)) into 1000 equal subintervals, each of length ( frac{2}{1000} = 0.002 ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we have 1050 roots in 1000 subintervals, at least one subinterval must contain at least two roots.

Team B takes 1.5 times longer than the specified time, so they can complete the project in 1.5x days. Their work rate is frac{1}{1.5x} = frac{2}{3x} of the project per day. 4. If Teams A and B work together for 15 days, and then Team A works alone for 5 more days to complete the project, we can set up the equation:    [    left(frac{1}{x} + frac{2}{3x}right) times 15 + frac{5}{x} = 1    ] 5.

Prove that the circumcircle of triangle  MX_1X_2  intersects the circumcircle of  ABC  again at the tangency point of the  A mixtilinear incircle.","output":"1. **Setup and Inversion:**    Let omega be the incircle of triangle ABC, touching BC, CA, and AB at D, E, and F respectively. Consider an inversion around omega. Under this inversion, the circumcircle of triangle ABC becomes the nine-point circle of triangle DEF. 2. **Properties of the A-mixtilinear incircle:**    Let omega_A be the A-mixtilinear incircle of triangle ABC. The inversion image omega_A^* of omega_A is a circle centered at A^* with radius r, where r is the radius of omega.    **Proof:**    - omega_A is tangent to (IA^*B^*) and (IA^*C^*), where I is the center of omega.    - Let omega_A touch AB and AC at P and Q respectively. It is known that P, I, and Q are collinear.    - P^* lies on (IA^*B^*) and Q^* lies on (IA^*C^*).    - Since PQ perp AI and EF perp AI, EFP^*Q^* forms a rectangle.    - omega_A^* passes through P^* and Q^*, thus it touches (IA^*B^*) and (IA^*C^*) at P^* and Q^* respectively.    - Hence, the center of omega_A^* is A^*, making omega_A^* a circle centered at A^* with radius r. blacksquare 3. **Tangency Point and Orthocenter:**    - omega_A^* touches (A^*B^*C^*) at T^*.    - Let H be the orthocenter of triangle DEF.    **Claim:** T^* is the midpoint of segment DH.    **Proof:**    - Let X = DT^* cap EF. Since A^*T^* = r, A^*T^* is the diameter of (A^*T^*X).    - angle{T^*XA^*} = 90^circ, so DX is an altitude of triangle DEF.    - (A^*T^*X) is the nine-point circle of triangle DEF, making T^* the midpoint of DH. blacksquare 4. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:**    - Since M lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC, M^* lies on (A^*B^*C^*).    - Let the tangents from M to omega touch omega at Y and Z. Then M^* is the midpoint of YZ, and X_1^* and X_2^* are the midpoints of YD and ZD respectively.    - We need to show that M^*X_1^*X_2^*T^* is cyclic.    **Proof:**    - (M^*X_1^*X_2^*) is the nine-point circle of triangle DYZ.    - It suffices to show that T^* lies on the nine-point circle of triangle DYZ.    - Let gamma be the nine-point circle of triangle DEF and N_9 its center.    - Let N = M^*N_9 cap gamma and DS be the altitude of triangle DYZ. Let K = T^*N cap DS.    **Claim:** M^*K = M^*N = r.    **Proof:**    - IH is the Euler line of triangle DEF, so I, N_9, and H are collinear, and IN_9 = HN_9.    - M^*INH forms a parallelogram, and M^*I perp YZ.    - Since DK perp YZ, DK parallel NH.    - frac{T^*K}{T^*N} = frac{T^*D}{T^*H} = 1, so T^*K = T^*N.    - Therefore, M^*K = M^*N = T^*A^* = r. blacksquare    - Since M^*K = r and M^* is the midpoint of YZ, and DK perp YZ, the circle with diameter M^*K is the nine-point circle of triangle DYZ.    - angle{KT^*M^*} = 90^circ, so T lies on the nine-point circle of triangle DYZ.

This implies that the difference between consecutive terms is increasing. Therefore, if a_{2} gt a_{1}, then a_{2}-a_{1} gt 0.

This implies a_{n+1}-a_{n} gt a_{n}-a_{n-1} gt cdots gt a_{2}-a_{1}.

The line that contains the median to side AB can be found using the midpoint M and either point A or B. Let's use point A to find the slope of the line. The slope (m) is given by m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{3 - 2}{0 - 1} = frac{1}{-1} = -1. Now we can use the point-slope form of the line equation with point M: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),  y - 3 = -1(x - 0),  y = -x + 3.

We already have the midpoint M(0, 3), which lies on the perpendicular bisector. Using the slope-intercept form, the equation of the line is: y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

How should they be placed to maximize the sum of the perimeter and the five diagonals?","output":"1. **Introduction**:     - We need to find the arrangement of five points (P, Q, R, S, T) on a circle of radius 1 that maximizes the sum of the perimeter and the lengths of the five diagonals. 2. **Maximizing the Perimeter**:     - First, we consider the problem of maximizing the perimeter. The key observation is that the perimeter of a polygon inscribed in a circle is maximized when vertices are equally spaced.      - Consider points ( A ) and ( B ) on the circle and let (X) be a point on the arc (AB). We aim to maximize (AX + BX). 3. **Mathematical Formulation**:     - Let (O) be the center of the circle, and let the angle subtended at (O) by the arc (AB) be (2k). The radius is (R) (1 in this case), and let the angle (AOX) be (x).     - The expression for (AX + BX) is:       [       AX + BX = 2R sinleft(frac{x}{2}right) + 2R sinleft(k - frac{x}{2}right)       ] 4. **Trigonometric Simplification**:     - Using trigonometric identities:       [       AX + BX = 2R left[(1 - cos k) sinleft(frac{x}{2}right) + sin k cosleft(frac{x}{2}right)right]       ]       Simplifying further, we have:       [       AX + BX = 4R sinleft(frac{k}{2}right) cosleft(frac{k}{2} - frac{x}{2}right)       ] 5. **Maximization**:     - The function ( cosleft(frac{k}{2} - frac{x}{2}right) ) is maximized when ( frac{k}{2} - frac{x}{2} = 0 ) or ( x = k ).      - This indicates that (AX + BX) is maximized when (X) is the midpoint of the arc (AB). Therefore, equally spacing the points around the circle maximizes the perimeter. 6. **Maximizing Sum of Diagonals**:     - By similar reasoning, the sum of the lengths of diagonals in a polygon inscribed in a circle is maximized when the points are equally spaced.      - If points are not equally spaced, consider any two adjacent sides (say (PQ) and (QR)). If (PQ neq QR), we can always move (Q) to the midpoint of arc (PR) to increase the total length, showing that the configuration was not optimal.  7. **Ensuring the Configuration is Maximal**:     - If points are equally spaced, every side is equal to every other side and every diagonal to every other diagonal, ensuring maximal total sum.     - Combining these two maximal configurations (maximum perimeter and maximum sum of diagonals), we conclude that the sum of both is maximized when the points are equally spaced. # Conclusion: The points should be placed at the vertices of a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle to maximize the sum of the perimeter and the five diagonals.

To prove: The line PQ bisects the line segment AB. 1. **Intersection Configuration:**     - Since the radii of odot C and odot D are different, the line segment PQ which joins their points of intersection must intersect the line segment AB.

Since it is a concave hexagon, some of its interior angles must be greater than (180^circ). 4. **Analyzing the angles and division of hexagon:**    - A concave hexagon can have at most three angles greater than (180^circ). 5. **Constructing the solution:**    - Label the concave angles.    - Draw the angle bisectors of these concave angles. The angle bisectors divide the concave hexagon into several polygons.    - For the first concave angle, draw the bisector starting from the vertex where the concave angle is located to the perimeter of the hexagon, where it intersects first.      - This division creates two polygons.    - These two resulting polygons will have a combined total of at most two concave angles (since each bisector effectively replaces one concave angle with two convex angles). 6. **Repeat the angle bisector construction:**    - Find the polygon containing the second concave angle and repeat the previous step.    - This results in three polygons, each having at most one concave angle left. 7. **Final division and placement of guards:**    - Draw the angle bisector of the final concave angle.    - This final step results in four convex polygons. 8. **Properties of the resulting convex polygons:**    - Each convex polygon can be guarded by a single guard standing on its boundary because the guard can see all points within a convex polygon. 9. **Satisfying the conditions with minimum guards:**    - Place the guards at the common sides of these four polygons, thus ensuring all vertices are visible to at least one guard.     - By this construction method, it is clear that two guards are sufficient to cover the visibility requirement for the entire concave hexagon. # Conclusion: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"instruction":"Let  a_1,a_2,...,a_{11}  be integers.

Prove that (frac{b}{a} < frac{c}{a} + 1).","output":"To prove the given inequality (frac{b}{a} < frac{c}{a} + 1), we follow these steps: 1. **Given Conditions**:    - The quadratic polynomial ( a x^2 + b x + c ) is negative for all ( x ).    - This implies:      - The leading coefficient ( a < 0 ).      - The discriminant of the quadratic polynomial is negative. That is, ( b^2 - 4ac < 0 ). 2. **Analysis**:    - The condition ( a < 0 ) ensures that the parabola opens downwards.    - From ( b^2 - 4ac < 0 ), it follows that there are no real roots for the quadratic equation, meaning it does not cross the x-axis and remains entirely negative or entirely positive depending on the coefficient ( a ). Given ( a < 0 ), the polynomial remains negative for all ( x ). 3. **Ensuring ( c < 0 )**:    - Because the quadratic polynomial is negative for all values of ( x ), even at ( x = 0 ), ( c ) must be negative (since ( c ) is the value of the polynomial at ( x = 0 )). 4. **If ( b > 0 )**:    - If ( b > 0 ), then (frac{b}{a}) must be negative because ( a < 0 ).    - Additionally, since ( c < 0 ), (frac{c}{a}) will be positive.    - Therefore, (frac{b}{a}) being negative and (frac{c}{a} + 1) positive (because (frac{c}{a}) overcomes ( -1)), it is immediately clear that the inequality (frac{b}{a} < frac{c}{a} + 1) holds. 5. **If ( b leq 0 )**:    - We explore the situation where ( b leq 0 ).    - We aim to show that ( b leq c + a ). This translates into ( frac{b}{a} leq frac{c}{a} + 1 ).    - To verify:      - Given the inequality ( b^2 - 4ac < 0 ), let's consider the potential values:        [        b^2 < 4ac        ]        Given that ( a ) and ( c ) are both negative (since ( a < 0 ) and ( c < 0 )):        [        |b| < |2sqrt{ac}|        ]        implies:        [        b^2 < (a + c)^2        ]        which means ( b^2 < (a + c)^2 ). 6. **Conclusion**:    - The conditions lead us to the given inequality ( frac{b}{a} < frac{c}{a} + 1 ) being valid under all circumstances derived from the properties of the quadratic polynomial and its coefficients.

What was his average speed for the entire walk, in miles per hour?","output":"To find Jack's average speed for the entire walk, we need to calculate the total distance he walked and divide it by the total time it took him. First, let's find out how far he walked at each speed: 1. At 4 miles per hour for 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), he would have walked:    Distance = Speed × Time    Distance = 4 mph × 0.5 hours = 2 miles 2. At 6 miles per hour for 20 minutes (which is 20/60 = 1/3 hours), he would have walked:    Distance = Speed × Time    Distance = 6 mph × (1/3) hours = 2 miles 3. We know the total distance is 8 miles, and he has already walked 2 + 2 = 4 miles. So, the remaining distance is:    Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already walked    Remaining distance = 8 miles - 4 miles = 4 miles He walked the remaining 4 miles at 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him, we use the formula:    Time = Distance / Speed    Time = 4 miles / 3 mph = 1.333... hours (or 1 hour and 20 minutes) Now, let's add up the total time:    Total time = 0.5 hours (first part) + (1/3) hours (second part) + 1.333... hours (third part)    Total time = 0.5 + 0.333... + 1.333... = 2.166... hours Finally, we calculate the average speed:    Average speed = Total distance / Total time    Average speed = 8 miles / 2.166... hours ≈ 3.692 mph Jack's average speed for the entire walk is approximately boxed{3.692}  miles per hour."},{"instruction":"A rectangle is cut into several smaller rectangles, each of which has a perimeter that is an integer number of meters.

Therefore, the price for each subsequent item becomes 200 times (1 - 30%) = 200 times 0.7 = 140 yuan. The total cost for x items is the sum of the original price for the first item and the discounted price for the remaining x-1 items, which is 200 + 140(x-1) = 200 + 140x - 140 = 140x + 60 yuan. - Thus, for x geqslant 1, we have y_1 = 140x + 60.

We need to find the recurrence relation for ( b_n ) in the form:    [    b_{n+2} + x b_{n+1} + y b_n = 0    ] 3. First, compute the initial terms of the sequence ( a_n ):    [    a_3 = frac{a_2 a_1 - 2}{a_0} = frac{5 cdot 2 - 2}{1} = 8    ]    [    a_4 = frac{a_3 a_2 - 2}{a_1} = frac{8 cdot 5 - 2}{2} = 19    ]    [    a_5 = frac{a_4 a_3 - 2}{a_2} = frac{19 cdot 8 - 2}{5} = 30    ] 4.

This implies that the value of ( frac{a_{n+2} + a_n}{a_{n+1}} ) is 2-periodic, meaning it depends only on the parity of ( n ). 7. For even ( n ), we have:    [    frac{a_{2k+2} + a_{2k}}{a_{2k+1}} = frac{a_2 + a_0}{a_1} = frac{5 + 1}{2} = 3    ]    Thus,    [    a_{2k+2} = 3 a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}    ] 8. For odd ( n ), we have:    [    frac{a_{2k+3} + a_{2k+1}}{a_{2k+2}} = frac{a_3 + a_1}{a_2} = frac{8 + 2}{5} = 2    ]    Thus,    [    a_{2k+3} = 2 a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}    ] 9.

When the man is rowing upstream, his effective speed is reduced by the speed of the stream, so his upstream speed is ( 57 - v_s ) km/h. When he is rowing downstream, his effective speed is increased by the speed of the stream, so his downstream speed is ( 57 + v_s ) km/h. According to the problem, the time taken to row upstream is twice the time taken to row downstream for the same distance. We know that time is equal to distance divided by speed. Let's denote the distance rowed in each direction as ( d ) km. So, the time taken to row upstream is ( frac{d}{57 - v_s} ) hours, and the time taken to row downstream is ( frac{d}{57 + v_s} ) hours.

Consider a square table with a side length a, and a square tablecloth such that each side of the tablecloth lies partially hanging off the table, creating four triangular overhangs at the midpoints of each side of the table. No corners of the table are covered by the tablecloth and the tablecloth does not overlap itself. 1. **Summarize the Given and Known Information:**    - The square table has side length a.    - The square tablecloth hangs off each side of the table equally.    - Each of the four triangular overhangs hangs outward from midpoint to midpoint of each side of the square table.    - Known: Any two adjacent triangular overhangs are equal.    - To Prove: The other pair of opposite triangular overhangs are also equal. 2. **Identify Congruent Triangular Overhangs:**    - Notice that if any two adjacent hanging triangles are congruent, their angles and relative positions must be symmetrical. 3. **Geometric Symmetry and Similarity:**    The triangular overhangs are similar to each other by the nature of being congruent triangles created by symmetrical folding. 4. **Height Equivalence and Projection:**        Define the height of a hanging triangular piece as the perpendicular distance from the point hanging off the edge to the line formed by the side of the table. Since the triangles are congruent and each overhang is similar, the equality of adjacent triangles implies that the heights of these triangles are equal.    Hence, if triangular pieces hanging off any two adjacent sides of the table are equal, it follows directly by symmetry that the opposite hanging triangles (non-adjacent) are also equal because any deviation would cause an imbalance or overlap, which contradicts the symmetrical position defined initially. 5. **Diagonal Projection:**    Consider the projections of the diagonals of the tablecloth onto the table's sides. Since the tablecloth is a square, its diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles.     If we add the side of the table to the sum of extension (heights) of the two hanging triangular pieces from adjacent sides, we end up with the projection equivalent to the diagonal of the square tablecloth.     Since both diagonals split side lengths equivalently and symmetrically, and because the diagonals themselves are of equal length and orthogonal, it confirms that the overhangs on each side are equivalent by reflection symmetry. 6. **Conclusion:**      Thus, any hanging triangle(s) adjacent will reflect equivalently to the opposite pair(s), establishing that all hanging pieces are congruent in shape and size upon symmetrical reflection.      Since the triangular pieces are hanging symmetrically and any adjacent pair being equal would naturally imply the other pair being similar due to geometrically invariant properties of symmetric structures, boxed{text{The two other pieces are also equal.}}"},{"instruction":"A can complete a work in 15 days, B in 14 days, C in 16 days, and D in 18 days.

The height of the tree is given as 1, and the branches form an angle of 45^{circ} with the vertical. 2. **Breaking down the shape**: The tree is made up of several isosceles right-angled triangles (or 45-45-90 triangles). Because of their specific angles, if one leg of such a triangle is a, then the other leg is also a, and the hypotenuse will be asqrt{2}. 3. **Analyzing the symmetric property**: The tree is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.

This is because every triangle in the left half contributes a portion of the height of 1. This means the sum of all green segment lengths (legs) in the left half is 1. 5. **Calculating the hypotenuses**: For each isosceles right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is longer than either leg by a factor of sqrt{2}.

Essentially, because ( angle AB' A_1 ) is more obtuse, the line segment ( AA_1 ) must be longer than ( B'A_1 ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Summarizing these observations, the inequality ( AA_1 > BB_1 ) holds because:        [    B' A_1 < AA_1 implies BB_1 < AA_1    ] Therefore, the initial assertion is proven: [ boxed{AA_1 > BB_1} ]"},{"instruction":"f (x = 2) and (y = 1), the value of (2x  3y) equals: (A) 11 (B) 1 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 3","output":"1. **Substitute the given values into the expression:**    Given:    [    x = 2 quad text{and} quad y = 1    ]    We need to evaluate the expression:    [    2x - 3y    ]    Substituting ( x ) and ( y ) into the expression:    [    2(2) - 3(1)    ] 2. **Perform the multiplication first:**    Using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):    [    2 cdot 2 = 4    ]    [    3 cdot 1 = 3    ] 3. **Subtract the results:**    Now we have:    [    4 - 3    ] 4. **Simplify the subtraction:**    [    4 - 3 = 1    ] # Conclusion: The value of ( 2x - 3y ) when ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 1 ) is ( 1 ).

We need to determine the smallest number ( n ) such that no matter how we select ( n ) real numbers from the interval ([1, 2013]), we can always find a scalene polygon with sides equal to some of these numbers.  2. A scalene polygon is a polygon with all sides of different lengths. For a set of numbers to form a polygon, they must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. 3. Consider the set of numbers ( {1, 1 + epsilon, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} ), where ( epsilon ) is a very small positive number. This set contains 12 numbers. Notice that for any three numbers in this set, the sum of the two smaller numbers is always less than or equal to the largest number. Therefore, these 12 numbers cannot form a scalene polygon. 4. Now, we need to show that if we select 13 numbers from the interval ([1, 2013]), we can always find a subset that forms a scalene polygon. Assume we have 13 numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{13} ) in increasing order. 5. Define ( S_i = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 12 ). We claim that ( S_i > a_{i+1} ) for some ( i ). Suppose not, then ( S_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ). 6. This implies:    [    a_1 < a_2    ]    [    a_1 + a_2 < a_3    ]    [    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 < a_4    ]    and so on, up to:    [    a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{12} < a_{13}    ] 7. If we sum these inequalities, we get:    [    (a_1) + (a_1 + a_2) + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + ldots + (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{12}) < a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{13}    ] 8.

Rearranging terms, we get:    [    12a_1 + 10a_2 + 8a_3 + ldots + 2a_{12} < a_{13}    ] 10. Since ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{13} ) are all in the interval ([1, 2013]), the above inequality implies that ( a_{13} ) must be extremely large, which is not possible because ( a_{13} leq 2013 ). 11. Therefore, our assumption that ( S_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ) must be false. Hence, there exists some ( i ) such that ( S_i > a_{i+1} ). 12.

The slope of line PA is k_{PA} = frac{y_0 + 1}{x_0}, so the equation of line PA is y = frac{y_0 + 1}{x_0}x - 1. Similarly, the equation of line PB is y = frac{y_0 - 1}{x_0}x + 1. The intersection of line PA and the line x = 4 is M(4, frac{4(y_0 + 1)}{x_0} - 1), and the intersection of line PB and the line x = 4 is N(4, frac{4(y_0 - 1)}{x_0} + 1).

This can be expressed as: 6215 = G * q1 + R1 where q1 is the quotient when 6215 is divided by G. Since G = 144 and R1 = 23, we can write: 6215 = 144 * q1 + 23 Now, let's solve for q1: 6215 - 23 = 144 * q1 6192 = 144 * q1 Now, divide 6192 by 144 to find q1: q1 = 6192 / 144 q1 = 43 Now, when 7373 is divided by G, it leaves a remainder R2. This can be expressed as: 7373 = G * q2 + R2 where q2 is the quotient when 7373 is divided by G.

First Solution: 1. **Assign Primes to Edges:**    Assign a unique prime number to each edge of the graph ( G ). This is possible since there are infinitely many primes.    - Let ( p_{ij} ) be the prime associated with the edge between vertices ( i ) and ( j ) if such an edge exists. 2. **Define Subsets for Vertices:**    For each vertex ( i ), define the subset ( mathcal{H}_i ) to be the set of all positive integer powers of the primes assigned to the edges connected to vertex ( i ).    - Formally, for vertex ( i ), [ mathcal{H}_i = { p_{ij}^k mid j text{ is adjacent to } i text{ and } k in mathbb{N} }. ] 3. **Intersection of Subsets:**    - If two vertices ( i ) and ( j ) are connected by an edge, then the prime ( p_{ij} ) is in both ( mathcal{H}_i ) and ( mathcal{H}_j ).

(blacksquare)  Second Solution: 1. **Inductive Construction for Finite Subsets:**    Construct finite subsets for each vertex such that the intersection of subsets corresponding to adjacent vertices is non-empty, and the intersection for non-adjacent vertices is empty.    - Base Case: For one or two vertices, this can be done trivially.    - Induction Hypothesis: Assume the condition holds for a graph with ( n-1 ) vertices.    - Inductive Step: For a graph with ( n ) vertices, let the largest element in the union of all constructed finite subsets be ( k ).

For each finite subset ( mathcal{H}_i ) and each element ( t ) in ( mathcal{H}_i ), construct the infinite set by adding all elements ( t + iM ) for all integers ( i > 1 ):    - Formally, [ mathcal{H}_i' = { t + iM mid t in mathcal{H}_i, i in mathbb{N}, i > 1 }. ]     3. **Checking Intersections of Infinite Sets:**    - If two vertices ( i ) and ( j ) were connected, then they share an element ( t ). Thus, their infinite subsets will share infinitely many elements ( t + M, t + 2M, ldots ).    - If two vertices ( i ) and ( j ) are not connected and their finite subsets were disjoint, any supposed common element ( t_1 + iM ) in ( mathcal{H}_i ) and ( t_2 + jM ) in ( mathcal{H}_j ) would imply ( |t_1 - t_2| = |i - j| M ). Since ( 0 < t_1, t_2 leq M ) and ( t_1 neq t_2 ), ( |t_1 - t_2| ) would be a positive number less than ( M ), causing a contradiction since ( |i - j| M ) is greater than or equal to ( M ). 4. **Conclusion:**    This construction guarantees the subsets meet the given requirements.

Combining the system of equations begin{cases} x^2 + y^2 = c^2  frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 end{cases}, and rearranging, we get x^2 = (2c^2 - a^2) cdot frac{a^2}{c^2} geqslant 0, solving this yields e geqslant frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

Given S_{5}=5S_{3}-4, we can substitute the formula for S_{n} into this equation to get: [ frac{1-q^{5}}{1-q} = 5left(frac{1-q^{3}}{1-q}right) - 4 ] First, let's simplify the equation. We can see that if q=1, the equation would not hold, as it would imply 5=15-4, which is a contradiction. Therefore, q neq 1, and we can safely proceed with the equation without worrying about dividing by zero. Rearranging the equation and simplifying, we get: [ 1-q^{5} = 5(1-q^{3}) - 4(1-q) ] Expanding both sides gives: [ 1-q^{5} = 5 - 5q^{3} - 4 + 4q ] Simplifying further, we find: [ q^{5} - 5q^{3} + 4q - 4 = 0 ] Factoring out the common terms, we recognize that this simplifies to the equation: [ q^{2} = 4 ] Solving for q, we find two possible values, q = 2 or q = -2.

D: The maximum value of f(x) on [0,frac{π}{4}] is 1.","output":"Given the function f(x)=2sqrt{3}sin x cos x - cos 2x, we aim to analyze the given statements about this function. First, let's simplify f(x) using trigonometric identities: begin{align*} f(x) &= 2sqrt{3}sin x cos x - cos 2x  &= sqrt{3}sin 2x - cos 2x  &= 2sin left(2x-frac{pi}{6}right). end{align*} This simplification uses the identity sin 2x = 2sin x cos x and the sum-to-product formulas. **A: The smallest positive period of f(x) is pi.** The period of sin(2x-frac{pi}{6}) is determined by the coefficient of x inside the sine function, which is 2. The period of sin x is 2pi, so the period of sin(2x), and thus f(x), is frac{2pi}{2} = pi. Therefore, statement A is correct. **B: If f(x+theta) is an odd function, then one possible value of theta is frac{pi}{4}.** For f(x+theta) to be odd, we consider the transformation of the argument in f(x): begin{align*} f(x+theta) &= 2sin (2(x+theta) -frac{pi}{6})  &= 2sin (2x+2theta -frac{pi}{6}). end{align*} For this to be odd, 2theta -frac{pi}{6} must equal kpi where k is an integer. Solving for theta gives theta =frac{kpi}{2}+frac{pi}{12}. If theta =frac{pi}{4}, then k would have to be frac{1}{3}, which is not an integer. Hence, statement B is incorrect. **C: A possible axis of symmetry for f(x) is the line x=frac{pi}{3}.** Evaluating f(x) at x=frac{pi}{3}: begin{align*} fleft(frac{pi}{3}right) &= 2sin left(frac{2pi}{3}-frac{pi}{6}right)  &= 2sin left(frac{pi}{2}right)  &= 2. end{align*} Since this yields a maximum value of the function, it suggests that x=frac{pi}{3} could be an axis of symmetry for the peaks of f(x). Therefore, statement C is correct. **D: The maximum value of f(x) on [0,frac{pi}{4}] is 1.** Within the interval [0,frac{pi}{4}], the argument of the sine function in f(x), 2x-frac{pi}{6}, ranges from -frac{pi}{6} to frac{pi}{3}. The sine function within this range can take values from -1 to sqrt{3}. Since f(x)=2sin(2x-frac{pi}{6}), the range of f(x) in this interval is from -2 to 2sqrt{3}, which means the maximum value is not limited to 1. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.
