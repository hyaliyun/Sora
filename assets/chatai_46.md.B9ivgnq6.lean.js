Erasing two identical signs and writing a plus. b. Erasing two different signs and writing a minus. 2. **Operation Analysis**: - If two identical signs (either two plus signs or two minus signs) are erased, a plus sign is written, which does not change the evenness of the number of minus signs. - If two different signs (a plus and a minus) are erased, a minus sign is written. In this operation, one minus sign is removed, but another one is added, keeping the evenness of the number of minus signs unchanged. 3. **Parity Consideration**: - The total number of minus signs initially is 15, which is an odd number. - According to the given operations, each step will either: a. Not change the number of minus signs. b. Reduce the number of minus signs by 2, which also does not affect the parity (evenness or oddness) of the count of minus signs. - Therefore, after any number of these operations, the parity (odd or even character) of the number of minus signs will remain unchanged. 4. **Final Step**: - Since 24 operations are performed, we need to consider how the operations affect the number of symbols. - With each operation: - The total number of symbols on the board decreases by 1. - Initially, there are 25 symbols (10 plus signs + 15 minus signs). - After 24 operations, there will be: [ 25 - 24 = 1 ; text{symbol left} ] 5. **Conclusion**: - Given that the number of minus signs must remain odd throughout the operations and there is only one symbol left, this symbol must be a minus sign.

Since ( s ) is the reflection of ( AB ) across ( AC ), the points ( A, G, D, H ) form a cyclic quadrilateral. 5. **Angles in cyclic quadrilateral:** - In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum up to ( 180^circ ).

This is known as the Alternate Segment Theorem. - Therefore, ( angle HGC = angle HDA ) implies that ( GH ) is parallel to ( t ). 8. **Conclusion:** - Since ( angle HGC = angle HDA ), we have shown that ( GH ) is parallel to ( t ).

Draw a line through D parallel to AC, meeting line BC at A_2 and line AB at C_2. 2. **Relationships Between Segments**: Given the setup, we have the following segment relationships: [ A_2D = frac{CD}{CC_1} A_1 C_1 quad text{and} quad C_2D = frac{AD}{AA_1} A_1 C_1 ] 3. **Proportionality**: Since CD : DC_1 = AD : DA_1, it implies: [ frac{CD}{CC_1} = frac{AD}{AA_1} ] Hence, we can deduce: [ A_2D = C_2D ] Consequently, the midpoint ( B_1 ) of segment AC, point D, and point B are collinear.

Step 1: Establish the relationship between overrightarrow{p} and overrightarrow{q} due to their parallelism. Since overrightarrow{p} parallel overrightarrow{q}, we have the proportionality condition: [ frac{a+c}{b+a} = frac{b}{c-a} ] Step 2: Cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction and simplify the equation.

By simultaneously solving the system: 1. c^2 = a^2 + b^2, 2. b = sqrt{3}a, We can plug equation 2 into equation 1 to find a^2 and b^2: c^2 = a^2 + (sqrt{3}a)^2 36 = a^2 + 3a^2 36 = 4a^2 a^2 = frac{36}{4} a^2 = 9 Now we use the relationship b = sqrt{3}a to find b^2: b^2 = 3a^2 b^2 = 3(9) b^2 = 27 Thus, the equation of the hyperbola becomes: frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{27} = 1 Hence, the correct option is boxed{C}."},{"instruction":"f the function f(x) = kx^2 + (k 1)x + 3 is an even function, find the value of k.","output":"Since f(x) = kx^2 + (k - 1)x + 3 is an even function, begin{align*} f(-x) &= f(x) k(-x)^2 + (k - 1)(-x) + 3 &= kx^2 + (k - 1)x + 3 kx^2 - (k - 1)x + 3 &= kx^2 + (k - 1)x + 3 2(k - 1)x &= 0 end{align*} As x is not always equal to 0, begin{align*} k - 1 &= 0 k &= 1 end{align*} Therefore, the answer is boxed{k = 1}.

The husband saves 225 every month. After 4 months, the husband will have saved: 225/month * 4 months = 900 The total amount saved by the couple before buying stocks is the sum of the husband's savings and the wife's savings over 4 months. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the wife will have saved for 4 months * 4 weeks/month = 16 weeks. The wife's total savings over 4 months is: W dollars/week * 16 weeks = 16W dollars The total savings of the couple is: 900 (husband's savings) + 16W (wife's savings) = 900 + 16W They decided to invest half of their money in buying stocks. The number of shares they can buy is 25, and each share costs 50, so the total cost of the shares is: 25 shares * 50/share = 1250 Since this is half of their total savings, their total savings must be twice this amount: 2 * 1250 = 2500 Now we can set up the equation with the total savings: 900 + 16W = 2500 To find the wife's weekly savings (W), we solve for W: 16W = 2500 - 900 16W = 1600 W = 1600 / 16 W = 100 Therefore, the wife saves boxed{100} every week."},{"instruction":"Given a pyramid ( S A B C ) with a triangular base ( A B C ) that is equilateral, and all the plane angles at the vertex ( S ) are equal to ( alpha ).

We need to determine the smallest value of alpha for this pyramid to be regular. 2. **Objective**: Prove that when alpha = 60^circ, the pyramid is regular, and construct a non-regular pyramid with alpha < 60^circ. 3. **Step-by-step Proof for alpha = 60^circ**: - Let's assume the sides of the equilateral triangle ABC are all equal to 1. - In any triangle where one angle is 60^circ, the side opposite to it is the average length of the other two sides. Therefore, in the triangle with the 60^circ angle, if one side length exceeds another, the third side will be strictly less than one but greater than the other. 4. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose one lateral edge of the pyramid, say SA, is not equal to 1 (i.e., SA > 1). - In the triangles SAB and SAC, the edges SB and SC would both be less than 1, which yields a contradiction as the edge BC in the base triangle SBC would not be the median length. 5. **Building a non-regular pyramid with alpha < 60^circ**: - A regular pyramid cannot have alpha < 60^circ because for smaller alpha: - Consider triangle SAB where SA = SB and the included angle alpha being acute compared to 60^circ. - Consequently, AB < SA and therefore BC in SBC will not maintain the median value. - Thus, no uniformity or equality in all triangular faces. 6. **Second Constructive Method**: - Construct a triangle SAB where SA = SB and angle S = alpha. Given AB < SB, place point C such that BC = AB. - By constructing a three-faced solid with alpha degrees everywhere in SABC, the structure remains inequitable in height and base-angle correspondences if alpha < 60^circ. 7. **Summarizing the results**: - For alpha = 60^circ, point S forms equilateral faces SAB, SBC, SAC, maintaining axial symmetry and uniformity. - For alpha < 60^circ, non-symmetric point projection defaults, making pyramid non-regular. **Conclusion**: The smallest value of alpha such that the pyramid SABC is regular is: [ boxed{60^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"Among the following four equations, the one whose product is not equal to the others is ( ) A: 190 times 80 B: 19 times 800 C: 19 times 8 times 10 D: 19 times 8 times 100","output":"Let's calculate each product: 190 times 80 = 15200 19 times 800 = 15200 19 times 8 times 10 = 1520 19 times 8 times 100 = 15200 Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{C}."},{"instruction":"Given that S_{n} is the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, a_{1}=1, and a_{8}=3a_{3}, then dfrac{a_{2}}{S_{1}S_{2}}+ dfrac{a_{3}}{S_{2}S_{3}}+ dfrac{a_{4}}{S_{3}S_{4}}+ldots+ dfrac{a_{n+1}}{S_{n}S_{n+1}}= ______.","output":"Solution: From a_{1}=1 and a_{8}=3a_{3}, we get a_{1}+7d=3(a_{1}+2d), which simplifies to 1+7d=3+6d, yielding d=2. dfrac{a_{n+1}}{S_{n}S_{n+1}}= dfrac{S_{n+1}-S_{n}}{S_{n}S_{n+1}}= dfrac{1}{S_{n}}- dfrac{1}{S_{n+1}}, thus dfrac{a_{2}}{S_{1}S_{2}}+ dfrac{a_{3}}{S_{2}S_{3}}+ dfrac{a_{4}}{S_{3}S_{4}}+ldots+ dfrac{a_{n+1}}{S_{n}S_{n+1}}= dfrac{1}{S_{1}}- dfrac{1}{S_{2}}+ dfrac{1}{S_{2}}- dfrac{1}{S_{3}}+ldots+ dfrac{1}{S_{n}}- dfrac{1}{S_{n+1}}= dfrac{1}{S_{1}}- dfrac{1}{S_{n+1}}=1- dfrac{1}{(n+1)+ dfrac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}times2} =1- dfrac{1}{(n+1)^{2}}, Therefore, the answer is: boxed{1- dfrac{1}{(n+1)^{2}}} By using the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence to find the common difference, and applying the method of splitting terms for the solution, we can solve this problem.

Since they are moving towards each other, we add their speeds together to get the relative speed. First, we convert the speeds from km/h to m/s because the distance is given in meters and we want the time in seconds. Speed of Train A = 50 km/h = (50 * 1000 meters) / (3600 seconds) = 13.89 m/s (approximately) Speed of Train B = 60 km/h = (60 * 1000 meters) / (3600 seconds) = 16.67 m/s (approximately) Relative speed = Speed of Train A + Speed of Train B Relative speed = 13.89 m/s + 16.67 m/s Relative speed = 30.56 m/s (approximately) Finally, we calculate the time it will take for both trains to pass each other and clear the bridge completely: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 980 meters / 30.56 m/s Time ≈ 32.06 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{32.06} seconds for both trains to pass each other on the bridge and clear the bridge completely."},{"instruction":"Let a point on a drawing be determined by the intersection of two circular arcs; at what mutual position of these arcs will the point be determined with the greatest possible accuracy?","output":"# Problem: Пусть точка на чертеже будет определена пересечением двух круговых дуг; при каком их взаимном положении точка будет определена возможно более точно? 1. Рассмотрим две круговые дуги, пересекающиеся в одной точке на плоскости. 2. Вспомним, что точка пересечения двух кривых определяется пересечением их тангенциальных направлений в этой точке. 3. Точность определения точки пересечения зависит от угла пересечения двух дуг. Когда две дуги пересекаются под прямым углом (90 градусов), это значит, что их касательные направления в точке пересечения взаимно перпендикулярны. 4. В условиях прямого угла пересечения двух дуг, любая небольшая ошибка или изменение в положениях дуг имеет минимальное влияние на точку их пересечения. Это происходит из-за устойчивости такого угла пересечения. 5. Анализируя другие углы пересечения, можно заметить, что когда угол меньше 90 градусов или больше 90 градусов, точка пересечения становится более чувствительной к ошибкам в положениях дуг.

For this inequality to always hold for any two distinct points within the interval (0,1), the function must be either always increasing or always decreasing within this interval.

The number of distinct positive divisors of a number is given by the product of one plus each of the exponents in its prime factorization. 7.

To ensure this sum is feasible under our construction, consider: [ 132 + x quad text{(some combination of numbers adds (x))} ] Let's validate by re-arranging to ensure one sum is three times another. Adding numbers that allow us to maintain the said property: - The total is formed when the sums modulo 7 are also preserved.

Thus, overline{FG}, which is parallel to overline{BC} and contains the centroid, also splits the triangle into smaller triangles whose areas are in the ratio 1:2. 2. **Use the area ratio to find the length of overline{FG}**: The area ratio between triangle ABC and the smaller triangle AFG is 1:2, and since overline{FG} parallel overline{BC}, the similar triangles principle gives that frac{FG}{BC} = frac{1}{2}. 3. **Calculate FG**: Given BC = 15, then FG = frac{1}{2} times BC = frac{1}{2} times 15 = frac{15}{2}.

However, the sum A + B = 14 is not a single-digit number. Since the problem states that A and B must be single-digit numbers, we need to re-evaluate our solution. The problem might be interpreted as A being a single-digit number that is 3 greater than 5, which would make A = 8. However, if A + B must also be a single-digit number, then there is no solution because the smallest value B could be is 0 (if A were 2, which is not 3 greater than 5), and even then A + B would be 8 + 0 = 8, which is a single-digit number but does not satisfy the condition that A is 3 greater than 5.

By the assumption ( k leq n^2-n ), the maximum value that ( k ) can take ensures that the integers in ( C_k ) are still within the range of the squares on the ( n times n ) board. 4. By the assumption that neighboring squares differ by at most ( n-1 ), there is no common edge between any square in ( A_k ) and any square in ( B_k ) for each ( k ). 5.

Otherwise, both ( A_k ) and ( B_k ) would be incomplete within the bounds they cover, contradicting their own definition. 7.

According to our previous assertions about containment, ( B_{m-1} ) must also possess this trait, fully covering whole rows and columns before shifting focus. 10. Consequently, ( A_m ) and ( B_{m-1} ) must have at least one common square by shared necessity for whole line coverage, forming an inevitable contradiction to the ( C_k ) segmentation and assumed range integrity. 11.

We set frac{y - 4}{x - 2} = k, so the equation becomes kx - y - 2k + 4 = 0. For this line to be tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle (1, 1) to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle. The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by the formula frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Substituting the values for our line and circle center, we get: frac{|k - 1 - 2k + 4|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1. Solving for k, we first square both sides to remove the square root: (k - 1 - 2k + 4)^2 = (k^2 + 1). Simplifying and solving the resulting quadratic equation, we find the possible values of k. However, since we are only interested in the minimum value of frac{y - 4}{x - 2}, we will examine the distance formula closely: frac{|-k + 3|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1. To find the minimum k, we minimize -k + 3 (since we are looking for the minimum of this value over the positive radius). So, we want the smallest k such that |-k + 3| = sqrt{k^2 + 1}. Since k is in a denominator and we want to minimize frac{y - 4}{x - 2}, we want the largest negative k (which will give the smallest positive value when in the denominator). From the distance formula, we see that k must be negative because the absolute value function and the square root will both yield positive results, and have to balance each other out. Hence we focus on the case -k + 3 = sqrt{k^2 + 1}. Upon solving, we find k = -frac{4}{3}.

The area of parallelogram ABCD is given as 1, and the given ratio frac{AE}{EB}=frac{1}{4}. The area of triangle BHC is frac{1}{8}. We aim to find the area of triangle ADG. 1. **Setup the dimensions and ratios:** - Let the base of parallelogram ABCD be a and height be h. Thus, [ a cdot h = 1. ] - Given frac{AE}{EB} = frac{1}{4}, we have: [ AE = frac{a}{5}, quad EB = frac{4a}{5}. ] - Therefore, [ h = frac{1}{a}. ] 2. **Determine the location of point F on DC:** [ S_{triangle BHE} = BE times h div 2 - S_{triangle BHC}, ] with [ S_{triangle BHC} = frac{1}{8}. ] Thus: [ S_{triangle BHE} = frac{4}{5}a times frac{1}{2a} - frac{1}{8} = frac{2}{5} - frac{1}{8} = frac{16}{40} - frac{5}{40} = frac{11}{40}. ] 3. **Calculate h_1 (the height of triangle BHE from BE):** [ h_1 = 2 times frac{11}{40} div frac{4}{5}a = 2 times frac{11}{40} times frac{5}{4a} = frac{55}{80a} = frac{11}{16a}. ] 4. **Compute CF (distance on DC):** - Using S_{triangle CFH} = CF times (h - h_1) div 2, [ S_{triangle CFH} = CF times frac{h - h_1}{2} = CF times frac{1}{2a} - frac{1}{8} ] Therefore: [ CF times left( frac{1}{a} - frac{11}{16a} right) div 2 = CF times frac{1}{2a} - frac{1}{8}, ] rearranging gives: [ CF times frac{5}{16a} = CF times frac{8}{16a} - frac{2}{16}, ] solving, we have: [ CF times frac{3}{16a} = frac{2}{16}, quad CF = frac{2}{3}a. ] Thus: [ DF = DC - CF = a - frac{2}{3}a = frac{a}{3}. ] 5. **Calculate area of triangle ADG:** [ S_{triangle ADG} = S_{triangle ADE} - S_{triangle AEG}, ] since: [ S_{triangle ADE} = AE times h div 2 = frac{a}{5} times frac{1}{a} div 2 = frac{1}{10}. ] - Let h_2 be the height of triangle AEG from AE: [ S_{triangle ADG} = frac{a}{5} times left( frac{1}{a} - h_2 right) div 2 = frac{1}{10} - frac{a}{10} times h_2, ] resulting: [ S_{triangle ADG} = frac{7a}{11} times h_2 / 2, ] which simplifies to: [ frac{7a}{22} times h_2. ] 6. **Solve for h_2:** Equating and solving for h_2: [ frac{7a}{22} h_2 = frac{1}{10} - frac{a h_2}{10}, ] converting all terms gives: [ frac{70a h_2}{220} = frac{22}{220} - frac{22a h_2}{220}, quad 70a h_2 = 22 - 22a h_2, ] leading to: [ 92a h_2 = 22, quad h_2 = frac{22}{92a}. ] 7. **Final area of triangle ADG:** [ S_{triangle ADG} = frac{7a}{22} times h_2 = frac{7a}{22} times frac{22}{92a} = frac{7}{92}. ] Thus the area of triangle ADG is: [boxed{frac{7}{92}}]"},{"instruction":"The Vasilyev family's budget consists of the following income items: Parents' salary after income tax deduction: 71,000 rubles; Income from renting out real estate: 11,000 rubles; Daughter's scholarship: 2,600 rubles.

This is because the area of each strip increases quadratically as we move down the triangle, due to the similarity of the smaller triangles formed by the strips. 3. The total area of the darkened stripes is: [ x + 5x + 9x + 13x + 17x = 45x ] 4. We are given that the total area of the darkened stripes is ( 135 ).

He will need 110 legos total. How many legos per side does the bottom level have?","output":"Let's denote the number of legos per side on the bottom level as ( x ). Since each level has one less lego per side than the level below it, the second level will have ( x - 1 ) legos per side, and the top level will have ( x - 2 ) legos per side. For a pyramid, the number of legos in each level is the square of the number of legos per side. Therefore, the total number of legos in the pyramid is the sum of the squares of the legos per side for each level: Total legos = ( x^2 + (x - 1)^2 + (x - 2)^2 ) We know that the total number of legos is 110, so we can set up the equation: ( x^2 + (x - 1)^2 + (x - 2)^2 = 110 ) Expanding the squares, we get: ( x^2 + (x^2 - 2x + 1) + (x^2 - 4x + 4) = 110 ) Combining like terms, we have: ( 3x^2 - 6x + 5 = 110 ) Subtracting 110 from both sides, we get: ( 3x^2 - 6x - 105 = 0 ) Now, we can solve this quadratic equation for ( x ). To make it easier, we can divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify: ( x^2 - 2x - 35 = 0 ) This factors to: ( (x - 7)(x + 5) = 0 ) So, ( x ) can be either 7 or -5. Since we can't have a negative number of legos per side, the number of legos per side on the bottom level must be 7.

Then: [ angle ABH = 90^circ - angle AHB = 90^circ - 2alpha ] 3. Since P lies on omega and BPH is a chord of omega, P belongs to the orthogonal circle passed by points B, H, P. Hence: [ angle ACP = angle ABH = 90^circ - 2alpha text{ (inscribed angle subtended by the same arc)} ] 4.

Connect A to I. Let A I intersect the circumcircle of triangle ABC at point D. Connect B to D. Hence, D is the midpoint of arc overparen{BC} that does not contain A. 2. Since D is the midpoint of arc overparen{BC}, we have: angle IBD = angle IBC + angle CBD. It is known that: angle IBC = frac{1}{2} angle B, as I is the incenter and angle IBC is half of angle ABC. 3. Given that CBD is an angle at the circumference subtended by the arc overparen{BC}, we have: angle CBD = angle CAD, where CAD subtends the same arc overparen{BC}. 4. Therefore, angle CBD = frac{1}{2} (angle B + angle A). 5. Consequently, angle IBD = frac{1}{2} angle B + frac{1}{2} angle A. 6. Similarly for angle BID, we have: angle BIA = frac{1}{2} (angle B + angle C), so: angle BID = frac{1}{2} angle B + frac{1}{2} angle A. 7. Since, angle IBD = angle BID, we deduce that ID = BD. 8. Let E be the reflection of B over the line OI. Since the external angle angle OIB = 30^{circ}, it implies E is also on the circumcircle odot O. 9.

Here, (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1) are the midpoints of segments formed by extending the sides of ( triangle ABC ). 3. **Altitudes are Perpendicular Bisectors:** The altitudes of ( triangle ABC ) are now the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of ( triangle A_1 B_1 C_1 ). 4. **Orthocenter is the Circumcenter:** Consequently, the point where these altitudes of ( triangle ABC ) intersect is the same as the circumcenter of ( triangle A_1 B_1 C_1 ), which is the orthocenter ( H ) of ( triangle ABC ).

We know that the sum of these distances is equal to the distance between the two stations, so: (d_1 + d_2 = 630) km We also know that the trains are traveling towards each other, so the time taken for them to meet is the same for both trains. Let's denote this time as (t). The distance traveled by the first train can be calculated using the formula (d_1 = v_1 cdot t), where (v_1) is the speed of the first train (20 km/hr). Similarly, the distance traveled by the second train is (d_2 = v_2 cdot t), where (v_2) is the speed of the second train (25 km/hr).

The area of a sector of a circle is given by: [ text{Area of sector} = frac{theta}{360^circ} times pi times (text{radius})^2 ] Here, the radius is 2, so the area of the sector is: [ text{Area of sector} = frac{theta}{360^circ} times pi times 2^2 = frac{theta}{360^circ} times 4pi ] 4. **Expected value of the area**: Since theta is chosen uniformly at random from 0^circ to 180^circ, we need to find the expected value of the area swept. The expected value of theta in this range is: [ E[theta] = frac{0^circ + 180^circ}{2} = 90^circ ] 5. **Expected area swept**: Using the expected value of theta, the expected area swept is: [ Eleft[frac{theta}{360^circ} times 4piright] = frac{E[theta]}{360^circ} times 4pi = frac{90^circ}{360^circ} times 4pi = frac{1}{4} times 4pi = pi ] 6. **Revisiting the problem statement**: The problem states that the average amount of area swept is pi + frac{1}{2}(2pi).

By connecting midpoints of adjacent sides, we form the quadrilateral (MNKL), which is known to be a parallelogram by the Midpoint Theorem. 2. **Parallelogram Properties**: Since (MNKL) is a parallelogram, its diagonals (MK) and (NL) will bisect each other. Let (Q) be the intersection point of these diagonals. Thus, (Q) divides both (MK) and (NL) into two equal segments. 3. **General Formula for Division**: By the given problem, each of the segments connecting corresponding division points on opposite sides of the convex quadrilateral (ABCD) is divided into 8 equal parts. This forms (4 times 8 = 32) small triangles (as each side of the quadrilateral is divided into 8 segments and each pair of opposite sides form a grid structure). 4. **Summation of Areas**: The crux of the problem is to show that the total area of black cells is equal to the total area of white cells in a checkerboard pattern. By considering the parallelogram (MNKL) and its properties: - Any two adjacent triangular sections share a common vertex and their bases lie on parallel lines (as both are part of the same parallelogram). - Each triangle formed inside the parallelogram with a common vertex (Q) has its equivalent triangle with shared bases on the sides of the convex quadrilateral, thereby maintaining equal areas due to congruent bases and heights. 5. **Conclusion**: The above reasoning showcases parity in the areas formed by the intersection points and subdivisions of the convex quadrilateral sides. Given the symmetric properties and equal divisions by midpoints and intersection points, it logically follows that the checkerboard pattern's area, summed over black and white cells, results in equal total areas for each color. Thus, the sum of the areas of black cells is equal to the sum of the areas of white cells.

However, since c > b, we can eliminate the possibility of an obtuse angle opposite the longest side for a triangle, therefore angle C can only be 60^circ.

Hence area S for triangle ABC when C = 60^circ is calculated using the formula: S = frac{1}{2} times b times c = frac{1}{2} times 1 times sqrt{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} (II) If we had considered C = 120^circ, we would find angle A = 180^circ - 30^circ - 120^circ = 30^circ, and the area S would then be: S = frac{1}{2} times b times c times sin A = frac{1}{2} times 1 times sqrt{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} However, as previously justified, C = 120^circ is not possible in this case since c is not the longest side, thus we disregard this scenario.

Therefore, it meets the criteria. 2. **Parallelogram**: A parallelogram (excluding the special case of a square) generally has axes of symmetry if it's a rectangle or a rhombus, but it is not symmetric about a center unless it's a rhombus or a rectangle, in which case it's symmetric about the center through its diagonals. However, since a general parallelogram can vary in shape (and not all parallelograms have axis symmetry), and considering the most general case where it might not have axis symmetry but could be considered symmetric about a center through its diagonals, it's ambiguous.

We need to find the intersection of this line with the parabola in the first quadrant: Given the system of equations: begin{cases} y^2 = 16x x = 2 end{cases}, we can substitute x=2 into the first equation to find that y^2 = 32. Since we are looking for the point in the first quadrant, we take the positive square root to get y=4sqrt{2}. Thus, the center C of the circle is at (2, 4sqrt{2}). The radius r of the circle is equal to the distance from the center C to the focus F, which is |CF|. To find this distance, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: r^2 = (2-4)^2 + (4sqrt{2}-0)^2 = (-2)^2 + (4sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 32 = 36. Hence, the radius of the circle is r = sqrt{36} = 6.

First, let's denote the vertices of the given convex quadrilateral as (A, B, C, D), and let ( P ) be an arbitrary point on the segment ( AB ). We need to find the positions of the other vertices ( Q, R, S ) such that they form a rhombus ( P, Q, R, S ) with sides parallel to the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ). To verify that (P, Q, R, S ) form a parallelogram: 1. **Drawing Parallel Lines:** - Draw a line through (P) parallel to ( AC ). This line will intersect ( BC ) at point ( Q ). - Draw a line through (P) parallel to ( BD ). This line will intersect ( AD ) at point ( S ). - Similarly, draw a line through ( Q ), parallel to ( BD ), which intersects ( CD ) at point ( R ). 2. **Proving ( P, Q, R, S ) is a Parallelogram:** - Since (PS parallel AC) and (QR parallel AC), and because (AC) and (BD) intersect at point (O), we have (PS parallel QR) and (Q ) and ( S ) lie on the line segments between the corresponding lines. - Also, since (PQ) is parallel to ( AC ), applying the parallel intercept theorem yields: [ frac{AP}{PQ} = frac{CQ}{QR} ] - Applying the parallel intercept theorem to the triangles ( ABD ) and ( APS ) yields: [ frac{AP}{PB} = frac{PS}{BD} ] - Similarly for the triangles (BCD) and (QCR): [ frac{CQ}{QB} = frac{QR}{BD} ] 3. **Ensuring Rhombus Condition:** - For (P, Q, R, S) to be a rhombus, (PS) and (PQ) need to be equal. By the proportionality conditions derived: [ frac{PS}{PQ} = frac{BD cdot AP}{AC cdot PB} = frac{AP}{PB} : frac{AC}{BD} ] - Therefore, (PS = PQ) if: [ frac{AP}{PB} = frac{AC}{BD} ] Thus, the point (P) must divide the segment (AB) such that the ratio of (AP) to (PB) equals the ratio of the diagonals (AC) to (BD): [ frac{AP}{PB} = frac{AC}{BD} ] 4. **Constructing the Point (P):** - To find such a point (P), we can measure the lengths of (AC) and (BD).

Therefore, we get A(-2,0), B(2,0), F_{1}(-1,0), and F_{2}(1,0). The right directrix is l: x = 4. Given P(0, sqrt{3}), the equation of line PA is y = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}(x + 2). Substituting x = 4 gives us point M(4, 3sqrt{3}). Similarly, for PB we find point N(4, -sqrt{3}).

For the ellipse we have A(-a, 0), B(a, 0), F_{1}(-c, 0), and F_{2}(c, 0). The directrix is l: x = frac{a^2}{c}. Let P(x_0, y_0) be any point on the ellipse, so frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1, which implies y_0^2 = b^2(1 - frac{x_0^2}{a^2}). The equation of line PA is y = frac{y_0}{x_0 + a}(x + a), with the condition x_0 neq -a. By intersecting with x = frac{a^2}{c}, we find M(frac{a^2}{c}, frac{(frac{a^2}{c} + a)y_0}{x_0 + a}). Similarly, we find N(frac{a^2}{c}, frac{(frac{a2}{c} - a)y_0}{x_0 - a}). Continuing this process for the dot product overrightarrow{MF_{1}} cdot overrightarrow{NF_{2}}, we obtain (-c - frac{a^2}{c}, - frac{(frac{a^2}{c} + a)y_0}{x_0 + a}) cdot (c - frac{a^2}{c}, - frac{(frac{a^2}{c} - a)y_0}{x_0 - a}) = frac{a^4}{c^2} - c^2 + frac{(frac{a^4}{c^2} - a^2)y_0^2}{x_0^2 - a^2} = frac{(a^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2)}{c^2} + frac{a^2b^2}{c^2} cdot frac{b^2(1 - frac{x_0^2}{a^2})}{x_0^2 - a^2} = frac{b^2(a^2 + c^2)}{c^2} - frac{b^4}{c^2} = frac{b^2(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)}{c^2} = 2b^2.

This implies that the line ( BP ) either passes through the midpoint of ( AC ) or is parallel to it. b. The same argument applies for ( triangle ACP ) and ( triangle ABP ): the distances from points ( B ) and ( C ) to line segment ( AP ) must be equal. 5. **Key Geometric Insight**: The point ( P ) must lie on the lines that equally divide the triangle ( triangle ABC ) into three smaller triangles of equal area. This condition is satisfied when ( P ) lies on any of the medians of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). 6. **Intersection Point**: The medians of a triangle intersect at a single point, known as the centroid ( G ). By definition, the centroid ( G ) is the point that divides each median in a 2:1 ratio (with the longer segment being closer to the vertex). 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, the point ( P ) that satisfies the condition such that ( text{Area}(triangle ABP) = text{Area}(triangle BCP) = text{Area}(triangle ACP) ) is the centroid ( G ) of the triangle ( triangle ABC ).

There are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and 4 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8). To have an odd sum with a selection of four numbers, there must be either **one odd number and three even numbers** or **three odd numbers and one even number** in the combination, since an odd number of odd numbers always sums to an odd number. 1. One odd number can be selected from the five available in C_5^1 ways and three even numbers can be selected from the four available in C_4^3 ways. The number of combinations is therefore: C_5^1 times C_4^3 = 5 times 4 = 20 2. Three odd numbers can be selected from the five available in C_5^3 ways and one even number can be selected from the four available in C_4^1 ways.

If 4aS_n < b_n always holds, determine the range of the real number a.","output":"(1) Since a_n + b_n = 1 and using the given recursive formula for b_{n+1}, we can derive an expression for b_{n+1} in terms of b_n: b_{n+1} = frac{b_n}{1 - a_n^2} = frac{b_n}{(1 - a_n)(1 + a_n)} = frac{b_n}{b_n(2 - b_n)} = frac{1}{2 - b_n}. Given a_1 = frac{1}{4} and a_1 + b_1 = 1, we find that b_1 = frac{3}{4}. Then, using b_{n+1} = frac{1}{2 - b_n} recursively, we have: b_2 = frac{1}{2 - b_1} = frac{1}{2 - frac{3}{4}} = frac{4}{5}, b_3 = frac{1}{2 - b_2} = frac{1}{2 - frac{4}{5}} = frac{5}{6}. Thus, we obtain that b_1 = frac{3}{4}, b_2 = frac{4}{5}, and b_3 = frac{5}{6}. (2) From part (1), we have b_{n+1} = frac{1}{2 - b_n}. Therefore, we can write: b_{n+1} - 1 = frac{1}{2 - b_n} - 1 = frac{b_n - 1}{2 - b_n}, and hence, frac{1}{b_{n+1} - 1} = frac{2 - b_n}{b_n - 1} = -1 + frac{1}{b_n - 1}. This leads to: frac{1}{b_{n+1} - 1} - frac{1}{b_n - 1} = -1. Knowing b_1 = frac{3}{4}, we have frac{1}{b_1 - 1} = -4. Thus, the sequence left{ frac{1}{b_n - 1} right} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term -4 and common difference -1. Therefore, its general term is: frac{1}{b_n - 1} = -4 - (n - 1) = -n - 3. From this, we can deduce the general formula for {b_n}: b_n = 1 - frac{1}{n + 3} = frac{n + 2}{n + 3}. Thus, we have boxed{b_n = frac{n + 2}{n + 3}}. (3) Since a_n + b_n = 1, we can express a_n in terms of b_n: a_n = 1 - b_n = frac{1}{n + 3}, and therefore: a_na_{n+1} = frac{1}{(n + 3)(n + 4)} = frac{1}{n + 3} - frac{1}{n + 4}. To find S_n, we sum the series: S_n = frac{1}{4 cdot 5} + frac{1}{5 cdot 6} + ldots + frac{1}{(n + 3)(n + 4)} = left( frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{5} right) + left( frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{6} right) + ldots + left( frac{1}{n + 3} - frac{1}{n + 4} right) = frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{n + 4} = frac{n}{4(n + 4)}. So, we have: 4aS_n - b_n = frac{an}{n + 4} - frac{n + 2}{n + 3} = frac{(a - 1)n^2 + (3a - 6)n - 8}{(n + 3)(n + 4)}. For 4aS_n < b_n to always hold, the inequality (a - 1)n^2 + (3a - 6)n - 8 < 0 must always be satisfied. Let f(n) = (a - 1)n^2 + (3a - 6)n - 8. (i) If a = 1, f(n) = -3n - 8 < 0 always holds, so a = 1 is a valid solution. (ii) If a > 1, f(n) has a positive leading coefficient, implying the parabola opens upwards. Thus, f(n) < 0 cannot be true for all n, invalidating a > 1. (iii) If a < 1, the axis of symmetry is negative, -frac{3}{2} left(1 - frac{1}{a - 1}right) < 0. So f(n) is monotonically decreasing over [1, +infty). It suffices to check that f(1) < 0: f(1) = (a - 1) + (3a - 6) - 8 = 4a - 15 < 0, implying a < frac{15}{4}.

Let the area covered only by the left strip be denoted by ( A_L = 27 ) and the area covered only by the right strip be denoted by ( A_R = 18 ). Since the lengths of the strips are 9 and 7 respectively, we know: [ frac{A_L + S}{A_R + S} = frac{9}{7} ] where ( S ) is the area covered by both strips. 2. **Setting up the equation** We can use the relationship ( frac{A_L + S}{A_R + S} = frac{9}{7} ) to form our equation: [ frac{27 + S}{18 + S} = frac{9}{7} ] 3. **Cross-multiplying to eliminate the fraction** By cross-multiplying, we get: [ 7(27 + S) = 9(18 + S) ] 4. **Expanding both sides** Expanding the terms on both sides: [ 7 times 27 + 7S = 9 times 18 + 9S ] [ 189 + 7S = 162 + 9S ] 5. **Isolating the variable ( S )** Rearranging the equation to solve for ( S ): [ 189 + 7S - 162 = 9S ] [ 27 + 7S = 9S ] Subtracting ( 7S ) from both sides: [ 27 = 2S ] 6. **Solving for ( S )** Dividing both sides by 2: [ S = frac{27}{2} ] [ S = 13.5 ] 7. **Conclusion** The area covered by both strips is: [ boxed{13.5} ]"},{"instruction":"Last year, Yingchun Village planted 200 mu of rice and 100 mu of corn.

Given that the average yield per mu of rice is 100 kg higher than that of corn, the average yield per mu of corn can be represented as (x - 100) kg. The total income from selling rice and corn can be calculated by multiplying the yield per mu by the number of mu planted and the selling price per kg. Therefore, the equation representing the total income is: [3 times 200x + 2.5 times 100(x - 100) = 400,000] Simplifying this equation: [600x + 250x - 25,000 = 400,000] [850x = 425,000] [x = 500] Thus, the average yield per mu of rice is 500 kg, and for corn, it is 500 - 100 = 400 kg.

According to the problem statement: 1. **Four years ago being a perfect square:** ( (x - 4) = m^2 ) for some integer ( m ). 2. **In three years being a perfect cube:** ( (x + 3) = n^3 ) for some integer ( n ). We aim to find ( x ) such that both ( x - 4 ) and ( x + 3 ) satisfy the conditions. Let’s check a few values of ( m ) and ( n ) to see if the equations yield a valid ( x ): - For ( m = 1 ), ( x - 4 = 1^2 = 1 ) and so ( x = 5 ). In this case, ( x + 3 = 8 = 2^3 ), which is a perfect cube. - For larger ( m ) and ( n ), test if any other combinations work: - ( m = 2 ), ( x - 4 = 4 rightarrow x = 8 ), ( x + 3 = 11 ) not a cube. - ( m = 3 ), ( x - 4 = 9 rightarrow x = 13 ), ( x + 3 = 16 ) not a cube. - Further values would increasingly separate ( x - 4 ) and ( x + 3 ) from being perfect cubes and squares simultaneously after a few trials or calculations.

If the retailer made a profit equivalent to 20% of the final selling price after all deductions and taxes, what is the retail price R of the machine before any discounts or taxes were applied?","output":"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we need to find the original wholesale cost before the 5% tax and the 10 shipping fee. Let's call this original wholesale cost W. The retailer bought the machine for 90, which includes the 5% tax and the 10 shipping fee. So we can write the following equation: W + 0.05W + 10 = 90 Combining like terms, we get: 1.05W + 10 = 90 Now, we need to subtract the 10 shipping fee to solve for W: 1.05W = 90 - 10 1.05W = 80 Now, divide by 1.05 to find W: W = 80 / 1.05 W = 76.19 (rounded to two decimal places) Now, let's find the retail price R before any discounts or taxes. We know that the retailer made a profit equivalent to 20% of the final selling price after all deductions and taxes. Let's call the final selling price F. The retailer sold the machine with a 10% discount on the retail price R, so the selling price before tax is: F = R - 0.10R F = 0.90R Then, a 15% sales tax is applied to F, so the final selling price after tax is: F + 0.15F = 1.15F The profit made by the retailer is 20% of this final selling price, so: Profit = 0.20 * 1.15F We know that the profit is also the difference between the final selling price after tax and the original wholesale cost (including the 5% tax and 10 shipping fee), so: Profit = 1.15F - 90 Now, we can set the two expressions for profit equal to each other: 0.20 * 1.15F = 1.15F - 90 0.20 * 1.15F = 1.15F - 90 0.23F = 1.15F - 90 Now, we need to solve for F: 0.23F = 1.15F - 90 Subtract 1.15F from both sides: 0.23F - 1.15F = -90 -0.92F = -90 Now, divide by -0.92 to find F: F = -90 / -0.92 F = 97.83 (rounded to two decimal places) Now, we know that F = 0.90R, so we can solve for R: 97.83 = 0.90R R = 97.83 / 0.90 R = 108.70 (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, the retail price R of the machine before any discounts or taxes were applied is approximately boxed{108.70} ."},{"instruction":"Rationalize the denominator of displaystylefrac{8}{sqrt{8}} and then divide the result by 2.","output":"To rationalize the denominator: dfrac{8}{sqrt{8}} = dfrac{8}{sqrt{8}} cdot dfrac{sqrt{8}}{sqrt{8}} = dfrac{8 sqrt{8}}{8} = sqrt{8}.

From the given information, we know that the batsman scored an average of 50 runs in the first 30 matches. Therefore, the total runs scored in the first 30 matches is ( 50 times 30 ). In the second set of matches, the batsman scored an average of 26 runs. Therefore, the total runs scored in the second set of matches is ( 26 times x ). The average runs scored in all 45 matches is 42, so the total runs scored in all 45 matches is ( 42 times 45 ).

Given the information, we can express the number of dimes and nickels in terms of x as follows: - The number of dimes John has is x + 3 because he has three more dimes than quarters. - The number of nickels John has is x - 6 because he has six fewer nickels than quarters. The total number of coins in John's piggy bank is given as 63.

However, the sign of x + y depends on the values of x and y. Therefore, x > y does not guarantee that x^2 > y^2. - Conversely, x^2 > y^2 does not imply x > y because x and y could both be negative with |x| > |y|. - Hence, in this case, p is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for q. **Option B:** For the proposition \\"If x > 10, then x > 5\\": - Consider the set of all x such that x > 10. This set is a subset of all x such that x > 5. - Therefore, if x > 10, it is always true that x > 5. However, x > 5 does not imply x > 10. - Thus, p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q. **Option C:** For the proposition \\"If a = b, then ac = bc\\": - If a = b, multiplying both sides by c gives ac = bc, which always holds. - However, ac = bc does not necessarily imply a = b if c = 0. - Therefore, p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q. **Option D:** For the proposition \\"If a - c > b - d, then a > b and c < d\\": - If a - c > b - d, it does not necessarily mean a > b and c < d.

Next, we consider the next largest perfect square, 49 (which is 7^2): [81 - 49 = 32] [32 = 16 + 16 = 4^2 + 4^2] This yields another combination: 49 + 16 + 16 = 81, or 7^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 = 81. 3. Finally, we look at 36 (which is 6^2): [81 - 36 = 45] [45 = 36 + 9 = 6^2 + 3^2] This results in the third combination: 36 + 36 + 9 = 81, or 6^2 + 6^2 + 3^2 = 81.

Therefore, the total number of dominoes required to partition an m times n rectangle is given by: [ text{Number of dominoes} = frac{m times n}{a times b} ] Since a, b geq 1 and _m times n} is not divisible by 4, (frac{m times n}{a times b}) must be an odd number. This follows since if mn were even, and ab is even (which it must be because the product ab of two integers is always non-zero), (frac{m times n}{a times b}) would be odd or even. 3. **Reflection argument:** Now consider the reflection of the partitioned rectangle over one axis. Let's denote this reflection as P'. The reflection P' gives another partition of the rectangle into dominoes of type (a, b). We argue that P' cannot be the same as P. 4. **If the reflection were identical:** Suppose P' = P, then each domino in P would pair with its image in P'. If each domino pairs with another, and we have an odd number of dominoes, one must remain unpaired. This would mean one domino must reflect into itself. 5. **Self-reflecting domino:** For a domino to reflect into itself, it must lie exactly on the line of symmetry. However, since a > 0, it cannot hold since each domino spans at least 1 unit horizontally or vertically, and hence cannot be symmetric. 6. **Conclusion on pairing and evenness:** Since we cannot have a reflection that results in the same partition, every partition must be distinct from its reflected partition, creating pairs of partitions. Therefore, each partition pairs with exactly one distinct reflection, leading to an even number of possible partitions. # Conclusion: The number of ways an m times n rectangle can be partitioned into dominoes of type (a, b) is even.

Find the midpoint (E) of (AD) and join (PE), (BE), and (BD). 3. Since ( triangle ABD ) is an equilateral triangle (as (ABCD) is a rhombus and (angle BAD = 60^circ)), (AD perp BE). 4. Similarly, (AD perp PE) because plane (PAD perp) plane (ABCD), and both (PE) and (BE) lie in these planes respectively. 5. Consequently, (PE perp) plane (ABCD) as (PE) is in plane (PAD) and (PAD perp ABCD). 6. Since (EB) lies in plane (ABCD), (PE perp BE). 7. Thus, ( EA perp EP ) and (EB perp EP) implying (E) is an orthocenter for these perpendiculars. 8. Establish a coordinate system with the origin at (E). Using the given properties: [ begin{array}{c} C = (-2, sqrt{3}, 0) P = (0, 0, sqrt{3}) overrightarrow{PB} = (0, sqrt{3}, -sqrt{3}) overrightarrow{PC} = (-2, sqrt{3}, -sqrt{3}) end{array} ] 9.

Solving the system by setting ( y = 1 ) will give: [ begin{cases} sqrt{3}(1) - sqrt{3}z = 0 implies z = 1 implies mathbf{n} = (0, 1, 1) end{cases} ] 14. Next, use direction vector ( overrightarrow{EB} ) to find the dihedral angle: [ cos langle overrightarrow{EB}, mathbf{n} rangle = frac{ overrightarrow{EB} cdot mathbf{n} }{|overrightarrow{EB}| |mathbf{n}| } = frac{ sqrt{3} }{sqrt{3} cdot sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] 15.

At this stage, all of Kolya's crosses will be placed in some of the initial 16 _rectangles_, leaving exactly 16 other rectangles completely free for Dima to use for covering with his dominoes. 3. At every (16 + k)-th turn (where 1 leqslant k leqslant 16), Kolya places a cross into one of his remaining free rectangles. Dima will then cover this cross and another adjacent cell (which should be empty) with a domino. 4. This strategy works because, at each step, Kolya places a new cross. Consider the situation before Dima’s reply move: Kolya has placed 16 + k crosses in total, with each rectangle containing crosses to the capacity of k rectangles being fully utilized. Meanwhile, Dima must have placed dominoes covering k-1 new rectangles. This means that before each of Dima's (16 + k)-th moves, there must still be a new rectangle containing exactly two crosses. 5.

To prove this, we will utilize geometric properties of tetrahedra and triangles, as well as the properties of the centroid and circumcenter of a triangle. Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Centers Coincidence**: - In an equilateral tetrahedron, the centroid ( S ) acts as both the centroid and the circumcenter. - Let ( S ) be the centroid (or circumcenter) of tetrahedron (ABCD). 2. **Relevant Points in the Cube**: - Consider the cube formed by drawing the lines extending through the tetrahedron, denoted as (AB_1CD_1) and (A_1BC_1D) (see fig.1 in initial solution description). - For the rectangular parallelopiped (or cuboid), the geometric centroid ( K ) coincides with the circumcenter as ( A, B, C, D ) lie on the circumsphere. 3. **Projection of the Centroid**: - Let ( S_0 ) denote the centroid (or barycenter) of triangle ( ABC ). - In a regular tetrahedron, ( S ) lies on the line connecting ( D ) and ( S_0 ) such that ( S ) divides the segment ( DS_0 ) in the ratio 3:1 (towards ( S_0 )). - Let's denote the perpendicular projection of ( K ) onto the plane (ABC) by ( K_0 ). 4. **Right Triangles**: - Analyze the right triangles ( AK_0K ), ( BK_0K ), and ( CK_0K ). Since they share the same hypotenuse ( K_0K ) and one leg originating from equal radii of the circumsphere, ( K_0A = K_0B = K_0C ). - Therefore, ( K_0 ) is equidistant from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), positioning it as the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Scaling Transformation**: - A known geometric transformation involves scaling the centroid of a triangle to form another geometric figure. Applying a scaling transformation centered at ( S_0 ) with a factor of 4: - This transformation maps ( S ) to ( D ), since ( S ) is one-fourth of ( DS_0 ). - Consequently, it maps ( K_0 ) to ( D_0 ) ( (D_0 ) being the perpendicular projection of ( D )). 6. **Concluding the Euler Line Alignment**: - From the transformation, the projection ( D_0 ) of ( D ) aligns with the Euler line of ( triangle ABC ). - The Euler line passes through the centroid ( S_0 ), circumcenter ( K_0 ), orthocenter, and other key points associated with ( triangle ABC ).

To confirm that 10001 is indeed the greatest common divisor, we can consider two consecutive multiples of 10001, such as 10001 times 1000 and 10001 times 1001. 4. **Analyze the Consecutive Multiples**: The consecutive multiples 10001 times 1000 and 10001 times 1001 share 10001 as a common factor. After dividing both numbers by 10001, we are left with 1000 and 1001, which are consecutive integers and therefore share no common divisors other than 1. 5. **Conclude the GCD**: Since the only common factor between any two such eight-digit numbers (formed by repeating a four-digit number) is 10001, and considering that consecutive multiples of 10001 (after dividing out 10001) share no nontrivial factors, we conclude that the greatest common divisor of all such eight-digit numbers is boxed{10001}."},{"instruction":"There are 11 white rabbits and 13 black rabbits.

Since the sum of distances from any point on an ellipse to its two foci is constant, and here it is given as 10, we identify that the given equation describes an ellipse. The two foci of the ellipse are located at (4,0) and (-4,0), implying that the distance between the foci is 2c = 8, hence c=4. 3. The length of the major axis is the constant sum of distances to the foci, which is 10. Therefore, the semi-major axis length is a = dfrac{10}{2} = 5. 4. The relationship between the semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b, and the distance between the foci c in an ellipse is given by the equation a^2 = b^2 + c^2.

Thus, initially, ( X = O ), ( Y = A ), and ( Z = B ). 2. **Movement of (triangle XYZ)**: - Point ( Y ) and point ( Z ) move along the perimeter of the ( n )-gon, which means they trace out the boundary of the ( n )-gon. - Point ( X ) must follow a movement that corresponds to the configuration of ( triangle ABC ) being congruent to ( triangle XYZ ). 3. **Tracing the Path**: - For each possible position of ( Y ) along an edge of the ( n )-gon, there exists a corresponding allowable position for ( Z ) such that the segment ( YZ ) is fixed in length and aligned as per the congruence of ( triangle XYZ ) and ( triangle ABC ). - As ( Y ) and ( Z ) move along the perimeter, ( X ) must lie at a point such that ( triangle XYZ ) remains congruent to ( triangle ABC ).

Therefore, we have: f'(1) = 2. We can calculate f'(x) as: f'(x) = ln x + frac{a}{x} + 1. Setting x = 1 and equating to 2 gives us: a + 1 = 2, hence, a = 1.

Use the identity ( sin^6 x + cos^6 x ): [ sin^6 x + cos^6 x = (sin^2 x + cos^2 x)^3 - 3 sin^2 x cos^2 x (sin^2 x + cos^2 x) ] Since ( sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 ), we get: [ sin^6 x + cos^6 x = 1 - 3 sin^2 x cos^2 x ] 6.

So, the number of students who got second division would be the remaining students after accounting for those who got first division and those who just passed.

The weight of the marble after the second week is: 80% of 175 kg = 0.80 * 175 kg = 140 kg. In the third week, the statue is completed, and the final weight is 105 kg. This means that some percentage of the 140 kg was cut away to reach 105 kg. Let's calculate the weight cut away in the third week: 140 kg - 105 kg = 35 kg. Now, we need to find out what percentage 35 kg is of the 140 kg that was present at the start of the third week. Percentage cut away in the third week = (Weight cut away in the third week / Weight at the start of the third week) * 100 Percentage cut away in the third week = (35 kg / 140 kg) * 100 Percentage cut away in the third week = 0.25 * 100 Percentage cut away in the third week = 25%.

Let the edge length of the cube be denoted by ( a ) and the edge length of the roof be denoted by ( b ). 2. Consider the vertices of the edges of the roof to be ( A, B, C, D, E, ) and ( F ) as indicated in the figure. 3. The faces ( EBA, EBCF, ) and ( EFDA ) are adjacent, which implies that their respective plane angles are equal. The lines of intersection of these three planes also have equal angles, and each edge emanating from ( E ) has a length of ( b ). Due to these conditions, triangle ( ABF ) (and similarly triangle ( ECD )) must be equilateral. 4. The symmetric trapezoids ( AEFD ) and ( BCFD ) have diagonals and longer bases of length ( a ), while their shorter bases and sides have lengths ( b ). 5. Consider one trapezoid forming the roof, with vertices ( A, E, F, ) and ( D ). 6. By drawing the diagonals, we generate isosceles triangles with angles: [ angle MAD = angle MDA = angle MEF = angle MFE = alpha, ] where ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AD ). 7.

This property can be observed more easily if we begin with one of the faces as an equilateral triangle. **Step 3: Utilize the congruence of triangles.** Assume a tetrahedron (ABCD) with (BC=a), (CA=b), and (AB=c). If (b neq c), triangles (BCA) and (BCD), which share the common edge (BC), can only be congruent if the distances of points (A) and (D) from (BC) are equal. Thus, either (DB = AC) or (DA = AC). **Step 4: Prove the consistency of this property with all faces.** Given (DB=AC): 1. Assume (A in D). Then, for triangles (ADC) to be congruent to (ADB), they must have equal sides: (DC=DB) which contradicts the non-equality of sides unless (D = B) or (D = A). 2. Thus, it must hold that (DA = AC). **Step 5: Define the centroid and demonstrate the concurrency of median lines.** Define a median of a tetrahedron as a line segment connecting a vertex with the centroid of the opposite face. To show that the medians intersect at a single point, consider (BC) as a common edge of two faces: - Let the centroids of faces (BCA) and (BCD) be (S_{A}) and (S_{D}). - Thus, the medians (AS_A) and (DS_D) must intersect in a plane (ADF) including the midpoint (F) of edge (BC). **Step 6: Establish similarity and colinearity.** In the plane (ADF), both (S_A) and (S_D) are on medians that pass through (F). The triangles (FS_DS_A) are similar to (FAD) with a scaling factor of 1:3, leading to: [AD = 3 cdot S_DS_A, quad S_DS_A parallel AD] This makes the quadrilateral (AS_DS_AD) a trapezoid. **Step 7: Using the trapezoid property in tetrahedron geometry.** Considering the trapezoid formed by the centroids and adjoining median lines, the precious property of tetrahedrons states: [SS_A:SA = SS_D:SD = S_{A}S_D:AD = 1:3] Since each median line of a tetrahedron is divided into segments with a 1:3 ratio, any two of these medians intersect in such a way that other medians pass through the same intersection point. **Step 8: Circumcenter and centroid coincide.** Given that tetrahedron (ABCD) with congruent faces has equal medians intersecting at a point (S), where: [SA = SB = SC = SD] This point (S) must coincide with the centroid and circumcenter, implying (S) is equidistant from all tetrahedron vertices. Therefore, the claim is demonstrated. Hence, given any tetrahedron with congruent face triangles will have its centroid coincide with the center of its circumscribing sphere. The proof is complete.

For Acup B to cover all real numbers, the range of B must at least start where A ends, ensuring no gap between the two sets. Since A covers all numbers less than or equal to -3 and all numbers greater than 2, the gap between the two parts of A is from -3 to 2.

The total distance from P to both foci F_{1} and F_{2} is a constant for an ellipse, which is |PF_{1}| + |PF_{2}| = 2a. For the given ellipse, a^2 = 7, so a = sqrt{7}.

Since |PF_{1}| + |PF_{2}| = 2sqrt{7} and |PQ| = |PF_{2}|, it follows that |F_{1}Q| = 2sqrt{7}. 3. This implies that the trajectory of Q is a circle centered at F_{1}, which is located at (-2,0) (since the distance between the center of the ellipse and each focus is sqrt{7 - 3} = sqrt{4} = 2, and F_{1} is to the left), with a radius of 2sqrt{7}. 4.

Using the distance formula and the given information, we obtain (x+1)^2 + y^2) cdot ((x-1)^2 + y^2) = 2^2. For statement 1, if we substitute x with -x and y with -y, the equation remains unchanged. Therefore, the curve C is symmetric about both the y-axis and x-axis, which confirms that curve C is symmetric with respect to the axes. Hence, statement 1 is correct. For statement 2, substituting x with -x and y with -y in the equation leaves it unchanged, indicating that the curve is symmetric with respect to the origin. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. For statement 3, setting y=0 gives us (x+1)^2(x-1)^2=4, which simplifies to x^2-1=2, solving to give x= pm sqrt{3}. Thus, the range of the abscissas (x-coordinates) of the points on curve C is [-sqrt{3}, sqrt{3}], which means statement 3 is incorrect because these x-values extend beyond the unit circle. For statement 4, setting x=0 yields y=pm 1, indicating that the range of the ordinates of the points on curve C is [-1,1]. Therefore, statement 4 is incorrect since the y-values cover a larger range than the interval [-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}].

Proof 1: Using Rearrangement Inequality 1. Assume (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}) are arranged such that (b_{1} leq b_{2} leq cdots leq b_{n}), where ({b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n}) is a permutation of ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}). 2. We know (b_{k} geq k) for (k=1, 2, ldots, n) since each (b_{i}) is distinct and positive. 3. Observe that (frac{1}{k^{2}}) is a decreasing sequence: (frac{1}{1^2} geq frac{1}{2^2} geq cdots geq frac{1}{k^2}). 4. By the Rearrangement Inequality: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{b_{k}}{k^{2}} geq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{k}{k^{2}} = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} ] 5. Thus: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} geq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{b_{k}}{k^{2}} geq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} ] Proof 2: Using Power Mean Inequality 1. We use the inequality: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} geq frac{left(sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k}right)^{2}}{sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{k}}} ] 2. Since (a_{k} geq k), hence (frac{1}{a_{k}} leq frac{1}{k}): [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{k}} leq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} ] 3. Therefore: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} geq frac{left(sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k}right)^{2}}{sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k}} = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} ] Proof 3: Using Abel's Transformation 1. Define (A_{k} = a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{k}) and (B_{k} = 1 + 2 + cdots + k = frac{k(k+1)}{2}). 2. Since (a_{i}) are distinct, thus (A_{k} geq B_{k}) for all (k). 3. Applying Abel's Transformation, for partial sums, gives: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} left(frac{A_{k}}{k^2} - frac{A_{k}}{(k+1)^2}right) + frac{A_{n}}{n^2} ] 4. Since (A_k geq B_k), we have: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} geq sum_{k=1}^{n-1} left(frac{B_{k}}{k^2} - frac{B_{k}}{(k+1)^2}right) + frac{B_{n}}{n^2} ] 5. This is simplified as: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} geq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{k}{k^{2}} = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} ] Proof 4: Using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality 1. Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form: [ left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{sqrt{a_{k}}}{k} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{a_{k}}} right)^2 leq left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} right) left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{k}} right) ] 2. Observing that: [ left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{sqrt{a_{k}}}{k} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{a_{k}}} right)^2 = left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} right)^2 ] 3. Given (sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{k}} leq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k}), then: [ left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} right)^2 leq left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} right) left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} right) ] 4. Hence: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} leq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{a_{k}}{k^{2}} ] By any of the above proofs, we conclude that the inequality is valid.

In a cell with a turn sign, it turns 90 degrees (in any direction at its discretion). The central cell of the square is occupied by a house. Is it possible to place the signs in such a way that the car cannot crash into the house?","output":"1. **Initial Observation**: If the car can travel from cell ( A ) to cell ( B ), then it must be capable of making the same journey in the reverse direction, i.e., from ( B ) to ( A ), following the same path in reverse. This symmetry implies that the car can potentially traverse any path in both directions under the given movement rules. 2. **Strategy to Escape**: It suffices to demonstrate that the car, starting from the edge of the grid, can reach any other edge without hitting the central cell (the \\"house\\"). 3. **Sign Placement Consideration**: Assume all cells are filled with either the \\"straight\\" or \\"turn\\" signs except the central cell. Let’s \\"release\\" the car from the central cell and observe its movement. 4. **Movement Rules**: - In a cell marked with \\"straight\\", the car continues in its current direction. - In a cell marked with \\"turn\\", the car makes a 90-degree turn to either left or right, according to a pre-determined pattern (e.g., alternating left and right turns). 5. **Path Determination**: Consider the car starting from the central location. As it moves according to the turn alternation rule, the car will not loop indefinitely in a small area due to the finite number of cells in the grid and the alternating turns preventing any repetitive looping pattern. 6. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is ( 101 times 101 ), and since the car is released from the central cell, the perfect center divides the grid into equal halves. 7. **Proof of Oscillation and Escape**: - The alternating turn rule ensures that the car does not enter into an infinite loop within a small subset of the grid. - Eventually, given the finite size of the grid and the pattern of turns, the car will traverse from the center to one of the edges. 8. **Formal Argument**: The car, following the turn alternation, will eventually reach the boundary of the ( 101 times 101 ) grid without navigating infinitely within. This happens because each cell either redirects the car or continues forward, and the sheer finite nature of cells ensures movement towards the grid's perimeter over time. # Conclusion: The given setup implies that no arrangement of \\"straight\\" or \\"turn\\" signs can trap the car indefinitely within the grid, leading to the conclusion that: [ boxed{text{No, it cannot be arranged such that the car will indefinitely avoid escaping without hitting the house.}} ]"},{"instruction":") Let ( p ) be a prime number.

However, (sqrt{p}), where p is a product of distinct primes, remains irrational. - The product of distinct primes still leads to an irrational square root due to properties of prime factorization and rationals not being able to resolve the square root of product of primes as a rational number. 6. **Conclude contradiction:** Therefore, this rational cannot equal (sqrt{p}), leading to a contradiction and reinforcing that no number can be expressed in the form (m + n sqrt{p}) in two different ways.

The power ( p ) of point ( P ) with respect to circle ( S_2 ) is given by: [ p = (x - a)^2 + y^2 - r^2. ] 6. Substituting ( y^2 ) from the first equation, we have: [ y^2 = R^2 - (x + a)^2. ] 7. Substitute the value of ( y^2 ) in the expression for ( p ): [ p = (x - a)^2 + R^2 - (x + a)^2 - r^2. ] 8. Simplify the expression: [ p = x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + R^2 - x^2 - 2ax - a^2 - r^2. ] 9. Combining like terms, we get: [ p = R^2 - r^2 - 4ax. ] 10. Let ( (x_0, y_0) ) be the coordinates of point ( A ). Since ( A ) lies on both circles, we have: [ (x_0 + a)^2 + y_0^2 = R^2 ] and [ (x_0 - a)^2 + y_0^2 = r^2. ] 11. Subtract these two equations: [ (x_0 + a)^2 - (x_0 - a)^2 = R^2 - r^2, ] which simplifies to: [ 4ax_0 = R^2 - r^2. ] 12. Solving for ( x_0 ): [ x_0 = frac{R^2 - r^2}{4a}. ] 13.

This is due to the symmetry of the ellipse and the geometric construction given. 2.

Identify the problem setup: We have a robot located within a grid of 1 times 1 cells. The robot has an initial energy of E = 59. Each cell has an energy consumption (or \\"耗能\\") which is an integer not greater than 5. An adjacent cell is one that shares a common edge with the current cell. The robot can move to a neighboring cell by spending energy equal to the energy consumption of that cell. 2. Understand the constraints: - Any 5 times 5 subgrid has a total energy consumption of 88. - The robot needs to move through these cells in such a way that its total energy consumption does not exceed its initial energy of 59. 3. Break down the grid into manageable parts: - Assume there are several possible paths for the robot to take from its starting position. - Each path needs to be assessed to ensure that the total energy consumed does not exceed 59. 4. Consider the worst-case energy consumption scenario: To determine if there is at least one path where the total energy consumption is feasible. Given that a 5 times 5 subgrid has a total energy consumption of 88, and the robot can traverse a grid with at most 15 cells away from the boundary, let's evaluate the energy consumption along different candidate paths: 5. Calculate the energy consumption for each of these paths: - Assume we have five different paths through the cells, outlined by the robot's possible movements (not explicitly given in the problem, but inferred by assessing potential routes within the boundaries). - For these five paths, sum the energy consumption over the cells along each path. 6. Total energy consumption calculation (provided): [ 3 times 88 + 2 times 10 + 2 times 5 = 264 + 20 + 10 = 294 ] Here, (3 times 88) is derived from traversing through three individual 5 times 5 subgrids, (2 times 10) results from moving through two cells twice within certain paths, and (2 times 5) encompasses movements through two more cells twice. 7. Compare energy consumption with available energy: [ 294 < 5 times 59 ] Since this comparison shows that 294 units of energy consumption is less than 5 times the robot's initial energy budget (although the problem should be rephrased correctly to check for individual path ensuring the robot's movement is within constraints effectively): 8. Conclusion: Based on these calculations, moving the robot such that its total energy consumption along the paths is observed can confirm that at least one of these routes ensures the energy used does not surpass the available initial energy of the robot. Therefore, the robot can escape the grid without exhausting its energy supply.

By doing this, in each 2 times 1 rectangle (i.e., in each adjacent pair of squares where one is white and the other is black), the checkers will always be of different colors. 2. **Case 2: Exactly Three Colors** Suppose we have three colors, say Color A, Color B, and Color C. The maximum number of checkers in any color cannot exceed 32 (since 32 + 32 = 64, and the total is 64 checkers). Without loss of generality, assume: - Color A has the most checkers (let's say 32). - Color B has the second-highest number of checkers. - Color C has the fewest checkers. - Place the checkers of Color A on the white squares, starting from the top of the board and filling each row horizontally. - Place the checkers of Color B on the black squares, starting from the bottom of the board and filling each row horizontally. Define a row as \\"full\\" if it contains 4 checkers from the same color group (Color A or Color B). Since Color A has at most 32 checkers and fills white squares from the top, the top rows will be filled predominantly with Color A checkers. Similarly, the bottom rows will be filled predominantly with Color B checkers. - Color C checkers are then to be placed in the remaining squares, ensuring they do not substitute a checker from Color A or B already placed. Since there are at most 32 checkers of any color and all squares will be occupied complying with the rule, this arrangement ensures checkers in each 2 times 1 rectangle are of different colors. 3. **Case 3: More than Three Colors** When more than three colors are present, combine the smallest groups of colors until we reduce the problem back to the three-color case. Specifically: - Combine two of the smallest color checkers groups. The resulting group counts will not exceed the limit of 32 checkers per color because combining two groups with fewer checkers will still result in fewer than or equal to 32 checkers. Repeat this process of combining groups until exactly three groups remain. - Then, apply the same procedure as Case 2 to place the checkers on the board. **Conclusion:** Following these procedures allows us to distribute the checkers such that no 2 times 1 rectangle contains checkers of the same color. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"When 0.4 of the total rope was used, the remaining length was 0.69 m (m).

Firstly, observing the range of frac{4}{5} in radians, we know that frac{pi}{2} > frac{4}{5} > frac{pi}{4}.  For sine (sin), as the angle increases from 0 to frac{pi}{2}, sin of the angle increases. Therefore, considering sinfrac{pi}{2} = 1 and sinfrac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we find: - sinfrac{pi}{2} > sinfrac{4}{5} > sinfrac{pi}{4}, leading to the inequality frac{sqrt{2}}{2} < a < 1. For cosine (cos), as the angle increases from 0 to frac{pi}{2}, cos of the angle decreases. Therefore, considering cosfrac{pi}{2} = 0 and cosfrac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we establish: - cosfrac{pi}{2} < cosfrac{4}{5} < cosfrac{pi}{4}, which gives us 0 < b < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. For tangent (tan), knowing that tanfrac{pi}{4} = 1 and that tan increases as the angle increases in the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}), we can say: - c = tanfrac{4}{5} > tanfrac{pi}{4} = 1.

According to the previous problem's result, a convex polygon that can be divided into convex centrally symmetric polygons can itself be subdivided further into parallelograms.    - This result leverages the properties of centrally symmetric polygons: each such polygon can themselves be decomposed into several parallelograms due to their symmetrical properties. 4. We can use the fact that parallelograms are centrally symmetric figures, where the point of intersection of their diagonals is the center of symmetry. 5. Therefore, if the original polygon ( M ) can be divided into parallelograms, the combined structure of these parallelograms means that ( M ) must have a point ( O ) that acts as a center of symmetry for the entire structure.  6.

Therefore, no root ( r ) with ( |r| < 1 ) can exist. 6. Now, assume there exists a root ( r ) such that ( |r| = 1 ). Let ( r = cos theta + i sin theta ). 7. Then the sum of the coefficients simplifies to:    [    sum_{b_j} = sum b_j cos ((n-j+1)theta)    ]    For this to hold, it must be that all ( cos ((n-j+1) theta) = 1 ), implying ( theta = 2kpi ) for ( k in mathbb{N} ). Hence ( r = 1 ), which is clearly impossible for all roots to be at the same point on the boundary of the unit circle. Thus, no such ( r ) with ( |r| = 1 ) exists.

Hence, OA is the bisector of angle DOF.     - Since triangle AFD cong triangle AFC, angle AFO = angle ACO.     - Thus, points A, F, C, O are concyclic, and angle COF = angle CAF = 60^circ.     - Given the problem conditions, angle CEB = 60^circ = angle COF, implying that quadrilateral OBEC is cyclic.     - Since EB = EC, angle BOE = angle COE, i.e., OE is the bisector of angle BOC. Therefore, A, O, E lie on a single straight line, confirming that AE, BF, and CD intersect at point O. 3. **Proof for Statement (3): Each pair of lines form a 60^circ angle**     - From the intersection point O, we have:     [     angle AOF = angle AOD = angle BOD = angle BOE = angle COE = angle COF = 60^{circ}.     ] # Conclusion: All statements (1), (2), and (3) hold true.

B can do the work in 8 days, so B's one day work is 1/8. Together, A and B's one day work is: (1/6) + (1/8) = (4/24) + (3/24) = 7/24 This means that together, A and B can complete 7/24 of the work in one day. Now, let's find out how much work is done by C. Since A, B, and C together complete the work in 3 days, they complete 1/3 of the work each day. The work done by C in one day would be the total work done by A, B, and C together minus the work done by A and B together. So, C's one day work is: (1/3) - (7/24) = (8/24) - (7/24) = 1/24 This means C does 1/24 of the work in one day. Now, let's find out how much C should be paid for the work done.

This implies that the domain of y=g(x) is mathbb{R}.  To prove the monotonicity, let's consider any two real numbers x_1 and x_2 such that x_1 < x_2. We have: [g(x_2) - g(x_1) = left(1+frac{2b}{2^{x_2}-b}right) - left(1+frac{2b}{2^{x_1}-b}right).] Simplifying this, we get: [g(x_2) - g(x_1) = frac{2b(2^{x_1}-2^{x_2})}{(2^{x_2}-b)(2^{x_1}-b)} = frac{2b cdot 2^{x_1}(1-2^{x_2-x_1})}{(2^{x_2}-b)(2^{x_1}-b)}.] Given that b < 0, x_1 < x_2, and thus x_2-x_1 > 0, we have 2^{x_2-x_1} > 1, which implies 1-2^{x_2-x_1} < 0. Since 2^{x_1} > 0, 2^{x_1}-b > 0, and 2^{x_2}-b > 0, we conclude that g(x_2) - g(x_1) > 0.  Therefore, the function y=g(x) is monotonically increasing over x in mathbb{R}. **(2)** When b=-1, the function becomes g(x)=frac{2^x-1}{2^x+1}. From part (1), we know that y=g(x) is monotonically increasing over mathbb{R} and is an odd function, as shown by g(-x) = -g(x).  Given the inequality g(x^2+1) + g(3-ax) > 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, we can rewrite this as g(x^2+1) > -g(3-ax) = g(ax-3). This implies x^2+1 > ax-3, which simplifies to x^2 - ax + 4 > 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. For this quadratic inequality to hold for all x in mathbb{R}, its discriminant must be negative, i.e., Delta = a^2 - 16 < 0. Solving this inequality gives -4 < a < 4.

( log_{8} n ) is a rational number if and only if ( log_{2} n ) is an integer.

Now, let's calculate how much James would have spent if he bought the 200-pound weight vest without the discount. Since he saved 110 by not buying the 200-pound weight vest, we can add that to the cost of the weight vest he did buy to find out how much the 200-pound weight vest would have cost him without the discount. So, 250 (the cost of his vest) + 110 (the amount he saved) = 360. Since the 200-pound weight vest would have cost him 600 with the discount, and he would have spent 360 without the discount, we can find out how much he spent on weight plates by subtracting the cost of his vest from the discounted price of the 200-pound weight vest. 600 (discounted price of the 200-pound weight vest) - 250 (cost of his vest) = 350 spent on weight plates. Now, to find out how many pounds of weight plates he bought, we divide the total amount he spent on weight plates by the cost per pound. 350 (amount spent on weight plates) ÷ 1.2 (cost per pound) = 291.67 pounds.

The coefficients from x_2 to x_8 are multiples of 3 because the numerator of these binomial coefficients includes a 9, which is divisible by 3.

From frac{x_{1}^{2}}{4} - frac{y_{1}^{2}}{2} = 1 and frac{x_{2}^{2}}{4} - frac{y_{2}^{2}}{2} = 1, we get frac{(x_{1} - x_{2})(x_{1} + x_{2})}{4} = frac{(y_{1} - y_{2})(y_{1} + y_{2})}{2}.

These positions typically involve leaving a specific number of counters such that any move by the opponent leaves them in a losing position here it’s 1. 3. **Reasoning with an Example:**    - If there is only 1 counter left, the next player must take it and lose the game. 4. **Backtracking from Key Positions:**    - Consider the situation where there are 7 counters left:      - No matter how many counters (1 through 5) the opponent takes, the player can always take the remaining counters such that exactly 1 counter is left on the next turn:        - If the opponent takes 1 counter, 6 counters are left, the player takes 5, leaving 1.        - If the opponent takes 2 counters, 5 counters are left, the player takes 4, leaving 1.        - If the opponent takes 3 counters, 4 counters are left, the player takes 3, leaving 1.        - If the opponent takes 4 counters, 3 counters are left, the player takes 2, leaving 1.        - If the opponent takes 5 counters, 2 counters are left, the player takes 1, leaving 1. 5. **Generalizing the Key Moves:**    - From the above strategy, we notice a pattern: the critical positions are every 6th counter:      - If there are 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, or 49 (i.e., (1 + 6k) counters left), the player currently taking the turn can always force a win. 6. **Initial strategy for 50 Counters:**    - The original problem starts with 50 counters:      - To get into one of the key positions (i.e., positions 1, 7, 13, 19, etc.), the first player should aim to reduce 50 to the closest smaller key position which is 49.      - Thus, the first player should take 1 counter and leave 49 counters. 7. **Subsequent Moves:**    - Now, it’s the opponent’s turn with 49 counters:    - The first player will then remove enough counters on each turn to ensure that they always leave the opponent a multiple of 6 counters.    - Therefore, following this strategy, the first player can always force the situation back to the pattern (43, 37, 31, etc.) until finally leaving one counter for the opponent to pick up. # Conclusion: By following the strategy of leaving multiples of 6 plus 1 counters after their turn, the first player can ensure that they always force the opponent to take the last counter.

Let's calculate the number of factors for each integer from 2 to 15: - 2 = 2^1: (1+1) = 2 factors. - 3 = 3^1: (1+1) = 2 factors. - 4 = 2^2: (2+1) = 3 factors. - 5 = 5^1: (1+1) = 2 factors. - 6 = 2 times 3: (1+1)(1+1) = 2 times 2 = 4 factors. - 7 = 7^1: (1+1) = 2 factors. - 8 = 2^3: (3+1) = 4 factors. - 9 = 3^2: (2+1) = 3 factors. - 10 = 2 times 5: (1+1)(1+1) = 2 times 2 = 4 factors. - 11 = 11^1: (1+1) = 2 factors. - 12 = 2^2 times 3: (2+1)(1+1) = 3 times 2 = 6 factors. - 13 = 13^1: (1+1) = 2 factors. - 14 = 2 times 7: (1+1)(1+1) = 2 times 2 = 4 factors. - 15 = 3 times 5: (1+1)(1+1) = 2 times 2 = 4 factors. 3. From the calculations, we see that the number 12 is the only number between 2 and 15 that has exactly 6 factors. Conclusion: Since Tim's integer is the only one with 6 factors, Ted can be certain that Tim's integer is 12. The final answer is boxed{12}."},{"instruction":"What is the area, in square units, of the square with vertices at P (1, 1), Q (2, 3), R (1, 8), and S (2, 4)?","output":"1. **Define the Sides and Locations**:    - Vertices are P (1, 1), Q (-2, 3), R (-1, 8), and S (2, 4). 2. **Calculate Side Lengths**:    - Distance PQ:            PQ = sqrt{(-2-1)^2 + (3-1)^2} = sqrt{(-3)^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{9 + 4} = sqrt{13}.          - Consistently, check QR, RS, and SP to be identically sqrt{13} by substituting relevant coordinates. 3. **Confirm Square by Checking All Sides Equal**:    - Assuming from calculations above, PQ = QR = RS = SP = sqrt{13}. 4. **Calculate Area**:    - Area of square = Side length squared = 13 square units. 5. **Conclusion**:    - The area of the square is boxed{13} square units."},{"instruction":"Let (ABCD) be a convex quadrilateral, and let (K, L, M,) and (N) be the midpoints of sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA) respectively. Prove that the intersection point of segments (KM) and (LN) is the midpoint of these segments as well as the midpoint of the segment that joins the midpoints of the diagonals.","output":"1. Let's consider the vertices of the convex quadrilateral (ABCD) with the points (K, L, M), and (N) being the midpoints of the sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA) respectively. 2. To solve the problem, we'll utilize the concept of the center of mass (centroid) in a system of points. 3. Assign each vertex (A, B, C, D) of the quadrilateral the weight (mass) of 1 unit. Let (O) be the centroid of this system. 4. We need to show that the point (O) is:    - The midpoint of the segments (KM) and (LN), where points (K, L, M,) and (N) are midpoints as mentioned.    - The midpoint of the segment connecting the midpoints of the diagonals (AC) and (BD). 5. Consider points (K) and (M):    - Since (K) is the midpoint of (AB), it can be seen as the center of mass of two points (A) and (B) with equal mass.    - Similarly, (M) is the midpoint of (CD), thus the center of mass of points (C) and (D) with equal mass. 6. Now, if point (O) is the centroid of the quadrilateral (ABCD), we can state that:    [    O = frac{A + B + C + D}{4}    ]    considering the vectors of the coordinates. 7. Point (K) being the midpoint gives:    [    K = frac{A + B}{2}    ] 8. Point (M) being the midpoint gives:    [    M = frac{C + D}{2}    ] 9. Considering the center of mass property and using (K) and (M) as masses of 2 units each:    [    O = frac{K + M}{2} = frac{frac{A + B}{2} + frac{C + D}{2}}{2} = frac{A + B + C + D}{4}    ] 10. Therefore, (O) is indeed the midpoint of segment (KM). 11. Similarly, for points (L) and (N):    - (L) is the midpoint of (BC):      [      L = frac{B + C}{2}      ]        - (N) is the midpoint of (DA):      [      N = frac{D + A}{2}      ] 12. As the centroid (O) considering these points with mass:    [    O = frac{L + N}{2} = frac{frac{B + C}{2} + frac{D + A}{2}}{2} = frac{A + B + C + D}{4}    ] 13. Thus, (O) is also the midpoint of segment (LN). 14. For the midpoints of the diagonals (AC) and (BD):    - The midpoint of diagonal (AC):      [      P = frac{A + C}{2}      ]    - The midpoint of diagonal (BD):      [      Q = frac{B + D}{2}      ] 15. Considering the centroid (O) of these midpoints:    [    O = frac{P + Q}{2} = frac{frac{A + C}{2} + frac{B + D}{2}}{2} = frac{A + B + C + D}{4}    ] 16. Thus, (O) is the midpoint of the segment connecting the midpoints of the diagonals (AC) and (BD). # Conclusion: All points (O) (KM), (LN), and the points connecting the midpoints of diagonals intersect at the centroid of quadrilateral (ABCD).

The company hired 28 additional male workers, and as a result, the percent of female workers changed. The company had 336 employees after hiring the additional male workers. What was the new percentage of female workers in the company?","output":"Let's denote the original number of employees in the company as E. Since 60% of the workforce was female before hiring the additional male workers, the number of female employees was 0.60E. The company hired 28 additional male workers, so the new total number of employees became E + 28. According to the information given, after hiring the additional male workers, the company had 336 employees. Therefore, we can write: E + 28 = 336 Now, let's solve for E: E = 336 - 28 E = 308 So, the original number of employees was 308. Since 60% were female, the number of female employees was: 0.60 * 308 = 184.8 Since the number of employees must be a whole number, we can round this to 185 female employees. After hiring the additional male workers, the total number of employees became 336, and the number of female employees remained the same (185). To find the new percentage of female workers, we divide the number of female employees by the total number of employees and multiply by 100: Percentage of female workers = (Number of female employees / Total number of employees) * 100 Percentage of female workers = (185 / 336) * 100 Now, let's calculate the percentage: Percentage of female workers ≈ 55.06% So, the new percentage of female workers in the company was approximately boxed{55.06%} ."},{"instruction":"A square is inscribed in a circle.

If they are connected, then the difference ( |a  b| ) and ( n ) must share a common natural divisor greater than 1.

If (a) and (b) are not connected by a segment, (|a - b|) must be coprime with (n). 2. If (a) and (b) are connected, (|a - b|) and (n) must share a common natural divisor greater than 1. We need to find the smallest (n) for which such an arrangement exists.  Step 1: (n) Must Be Odd - Suppose (n) is even. In any set of six numbers, there must be at least three numbers of the same parity (either odd or even). Each pair of these numbers would be connected based on our initial condition, leading to a contradiction since there are no cycles of length 3 in the picture. - Therefore, (n) must be odd.  Step 2: (n) Must Have At Least Three Different Prime Divisors - Supposing (r) is a prime divisor of (n), having a chain of three consecutively connected numbers ((a, b, c)) with both (|a-b|) and (|b-c|) divisible by (r), implies (|a-c| = k cdot r enspace (text{for some integer } k)). Thus, (a, b, c) would form a cycle of three, which again does not exist in the picture. - Hence, (n) must have at least three different prime divisors to avoid such cycles.  Step 3: Determining the Smallest (n) - Based on the above, (n) must be the product of at least three distinct odd primes. - The smallest primes are (3, 5, 7). - Consequently, the smallest possible (n) is the product of these primes: (n = 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 105).

For the first area (17.56 hectares): We need to convert hectares to square meters because the cost of fencing is given per meter.  1 hectare = 10,000 square meters. So, 17.56 hectares = 17.56 * 10,000 = 175,600 square meters. Now, we use the area formula to find the radius: A = πr^2 175,600 = πr^2 r^2 = 175,600 / π r = √(175,600 / π) r ≈ √(55881.10806) r ≈ 236.4 meters 2. For the second area (25.92 hectares): 25.92 hectares = 25.92 * 10,000 = 259,200 square meters. A = πr^2 259,200 = πr^2 r^2 = 259,200 / π r = √(259,200 / π) r ≈ √(82515.54404) r ≈ 287.25 meters 3. For the third area (11.76 hectares): 11.76 hectares = 11.76 * 10,000 = 117,600 square meters. A = πr^2 117,600 = πr^2 r^2 = 117,600 / π r = √(117,600 / π) r ≈ √(37412.80625) r ≈ 193.42 meters Next, we calculate the circumference (C) of each circle using the formula C = 2πr. 1. For the first area: C = 2πr C ≈ 2 * π * 236.4 C ≈ 1485.6 meters 2. For the second area: C = 2πr C ≈ 2 * π * 287.25 C ≈ 1804.5 meters 3. For the third area: C = 2πr C ≈ 2 * π * 193.42 C ≈ 1215.6 meters Now, we calculate the cost of fencing for each area: 1.

The bases are equilateral triangles with side length 10. Points M, N, and O are the midpoints of edges PQ, QR, and RT, respectively. Determine the perimeter of triangle MNO.","output":"Since triangle PQR is equilateral with side length 10, and M and N are the midpoints of PQ and QR respectively, we have PM=MQ=NR=RQ=frac{1}{2}(10)=5. Since the height of the prism is 20 and O is the midpoint of RT we have RO = OT = frac{1}{2}(20)=10. We have angle PRT = angle QRT = 90^circ since faces PQRT and QRST are rectangles. Thus, triangle PMO and triangle NMO are right-angled at P and Q respectively. By the Pythagorean Theorem,  [ MO = sqrt{PM^2 + RO^2} = sqrt{5^2 + 10^2} = sqrt{125} = 5sqrt{5} ] and  [ NO = sqrt{NQ^2 + RO^2} = sqrt{5^2 + 10^2} = sqrt{125} = 5sqrt{5} ]. Now we look at triangle PMN. We know that PM = MN = 5 and that angle PMN = 60^circ, because triangle PQR is equilateral. Thus, triangle PMN is isosceles with angle PNM = angle NMP. These angles must each be equal to frac{1}{2}(180^circ - angle PMN) = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - 60^circ)=60^circ. Thus triangle PMN is equilateral, so MN = PM = MN = 5.

We call a number big if it is greater than its neighbors, and small if it is less than its neighbors. In the arrangement, each number is either big or small. What is the smallest possible sum of the big numbers?","output":"1. We begin by examining the nature of the problem: we must arrange the numbers from 1 to 8 in a circle such that every number is either larger or smaller than its immediate neighbors. According to the problem, a number is called \\"large\\" if it is greater than its neighbors, and \\"small\\" if it is less than its neighbors. 2. **Observation**: Neighboring numbers cannot all be of the same type. This means \\"large\\" and \\"small\\" numbers must alternate around the circle. Since we have 8 numbers, there will be exactly 4 \\"large\\" numbers and 4 \\"small\\" numbers in any valid arrangement. 3. Let's designate the numbers that should always be large. The numbers 8 and 7 must be larger than any other surrounding them because they are the highest sequential values, making it somewhat obvious they will be large. These observations arise since:    - The number 8 is the largest and therefore automatically larger than its neighbors.    - The number 7 could potentially be smaller than one (the number 8), but it must still be larger than the other, thereby qualifying it as a large number. 4. Next, consider the numbers 1 and 2:    - The number 1 is the smallest and thus will always be smaller than its neighbors.    - The number 2 is similarly smaller than most other numbers, making it consistently classified as small. 5. We now focus on the remaining numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6.     - We attempt to arrange these while keeping in mind they must be alternating with other types (large or small). We must ensure maintaining alternating properties.  6. For any sequence or permutation of 3, 4, 5, and 6, the total must include exactly 4 large and 4 small:     - One feasible minimal sum example could arise by selecting the smallest set which still acts as a \\"large\\" grouping. Here’s why:         - 6 is larger than both 5 and any leftward smaller number (like 1 or 2).         - 5 must then assume a similar large role by comparison.         - From this perspective, we could outline a three-step selection or confirm by bounding smaller sums.          7. **Sum Calculation**:     - Let's consider the example arrangement in the problem explanation, where sequence proofattempts were demonstrated 8, 6, 7, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4. Here:     [     sum_{large} = 8 + 6 + 7 + 3 = 24     ] 8. **Generalize larger constraints**:     - Through consideration systematically, numbers 3 and 4 can be large, expectationally 5, as supportively all 3 sum:          [      6, 5, 7, 8 (summing 23 as minimum)       text{Confirm smallest bound proves minimally positive constraints appropriately bounding practical checks}] Conclusion: The smallest possible sum of the \\"large\\" numbers in such a valid arrangement is larger filling checks.

Hence, we have: [ -frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi leqslant 2x + frac{pi}{6} leqslant frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi quad (k in mathbb{Z}) ] Solving for x, we get: [ -frac{pi}{3} + kpi leqslant x leqslant frac{pi}{6} + kpi quad (k in mathbb{Z}) ] Therefore, the interval of monotonic increase of the function f(x) is -frac{pi}{3} + kpi leqslant x leqslant frac{pi}{6} + kpi quad (k in mathbb{Z}). **For (Ⅱ):** - Given the interval 0 leqslant x leqslant frac{pi}{4}, we determine the range of 2x + frac{pi}{6} as: [ frac{pi}{6} leqslant 2x + frac{pi}{6} leqslant frac{2pi}{3} ] This means frac{1}{2} leqslant sin(2x + frac{pi}{6}) leqslant 1. Consequently, the range of f(x) = 2sin(2x + frac{pi}{6}) - 1 is 0 leqslant f(x) leqslant 1. - The minimum value of f(x) in the given interval is achieved when x = 0. Substituting x = 0 into f(x), we find f(0) = 0. - The maximum value of f(x) occurs when 2x + frac{pi}{6} = frac{pi}{2}, which implies x = frac{pi}{6}. Substituting x = frac{pi}{6} into f(x), we find fleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = 1. **Final Answers:** (Ⅰ) The minimum positive period is boxed{pi}, and the interval of monotonic increase is [-frac{pi}{3} + kpi, frac{pi}{6} + kpi] quad (k in mathbb{Z}). (Ⅱ) The minimum value of f(x) on [0, frac{pi}{4}] is boxed{0} when x = 0, and the maximum value is boxed{1} when x = frac{pi}{6}."},{"instruction":"A rectangular wooden block is 3 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches high.

The molar mass of barium hydroxide is calculated by adding the molar masses of barium (Ba), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H) as follows: - Molar mass of Ba = 137.327 g/mol - Molar mass of O = 15.999 g/mol - Molar mass of H = 1.008 g/mol Barium hydroxide has one barium atom, two oxygen atoms, and two hydrogen atoms. So, the molar mass of Ba(OH)₂ is: Molar mass of Ba(OH)₂ = (1 × 137.327) + (2 × 15.999) + (2 × 1.008) Molar mass of Ba(OH)₂ = 137.327 + 31.998 + 2.016 Molar mass of Ba(OH)₂ = 171.341 g/mol Now, we calculate the total mass of hydrogen in one mole of Ba(OH)₂: Total mass of H in Ba(OH)₂ = 2 × 1.008 g/mol Total mass of H in Ba(OH)₂ = 2.016 g/mol Finally, we find the mass percentage of hydrogen in Ba(OH)₂: Mass percentage of H = (Total mass of H in Ba(OH)₂ / Molar mass of Ba(OH)₂) × 100% Mass percentage of H = (2.016 g/mol / 171.341 g/mol) × 100% Mass percentage of H ≈ (2.016 / 171.341) × 100% Mass percentage of H ≈ 0.01176 × 100% Mass percentage of H ≈ 1.176% Therefore, the mass percentage of hydrogen in barium hydroxide is approximately boxed{1.176%} ."},{"instruction":"Jackson had 20 kilograms of meat.

How many sides does the polygon have?","output":"To solve for the number of sides n in a regular polygon with interior angles of 120^circ, we can follow two approaches: **Approach 1: Using the Sum of Interior Angles** 1. The sum of the interior angles in any n-sided polygon is given by the formula 180(n-2) degrees. 2. Given that each interior angle is 120^circ, the sum of all interior angles can also be expressed as 120n. 3. Setting these two expressions equal to each other gives us the equation:    [180(n-2) = 120n.] 4. Expanding and simplifying the equation:    begin{align*}    180n - 360 &= 120n     180n - 120n &= 360     60n &= 360     n &= 6.    end{align*} 5. Therefore, the polygon has boxed{6} sides. **Approach 2: Using Exterior Angles** 1. The measure of each exterior angle of the polygon is 180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ. 2. The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is 360^circ. 3. The number of exterior angles (and thus the number of sides) can be found by dividing the total sum of exterior angles by the measure of one exterior angle:    [frac{360^circ}{60^circ} = 6.] 4. Hence, the polygon has boxed{6} sides.

Prove that it is possible to label the edges with the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, k ) in such a way that for each vertex belonging to two or more edges, the greatest common divisor of the integers labeling these edges is 1.","output":"1. **Initial Setup**:    - We start with a connected graph ( G ) with ( k ) edges.    - We will demonstrate a method to label the edges ( 1, 2, ldots, k ) so that every vertex touching two or more edges has those edge labels relatively prime, i.e., the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these labels is 1. 2. **Labeling Strategy**:    - Enumerate the edges from the smallest to the largest that have not yet been used.    - Consider the vertex set ( V ) of the graph ( G ). 3. **Path Selection**:    - Select ( u ) as the smallest number not yet assigned as a label.    - Identify the longest path within the graph ( G ), such that each vertex on the path is used exactly once. Denote this path as ( P = (v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n) ).    - Note that if ( v_1 ) or ( v_n ) connects to another edge besides those in the path ( P ), it connects to vertices ( v_0 ) or ( v_{n+1} ), respectively. 4. **Label Assignment**:    - If ( v_0 ) exists, assign labels to the edges along ( P ) in increasing order starting from ( u ), i.e., label the edge between ( v_i ) and ( v_{i+1} ) with ( u+i ).    - If ( v_0 ) does not exist, label these edges starting from ( u+i-1 ). 5. **Ensuring Relative Primality**:    - Remove vertices ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n ) from the set ( V ).    - This maintains that for any remaining vertices outside ( V ), their adjacent edges are labeled with integers that are pairwise relatively prime.    - Continue labeling in this manner ensuring vertices are sequentially removed from consideration until all vertices in ( V ) have a degree of 1 or are surrounded by edges satisfying the relative primality condition. 6. **Finalization**:    - Vertices that are connected to only one vertex (degree 1) do not affect the GCD condition since they will only have one connecting edge.    - For any vertex of degree at least 2 that we must still label, assign the smallest remaining labels such that the edges they connect to have consecutive integers. This ensures that any two connected edges have a GCD of 1. Thus, we repeat this process until all vertices either are reduced to importance or have labels such that any pair of connected edges meet the required criteria of having a GCD of 1. # Conclusion:     The algorithm guarantees that each vertex connected to multiple edges maintains the condition that the GCD of any two such edge labels is 1. Hence, it is possible to label the edges of the connected graph ( G ) such that every vertex touching two or more edges is correctly labeled according to the problem's stipulation.

Let's denote three random city residents by A, B, and C. 2. According to the problem, one of the following scenarios must occur among A, B, and C:     a. All three are friends with each other.     b. Two of them are friends, and the third is not friends with either of them. 3. Consider scenario b): Suppose A is not friends with B and C, but B and C are friends. In this case, for A, B, and C to all become friends, it is sufficient for A to \\"start a new life\\" and switch their relationship with their current friends and enemies.     - After A starts a new life:       - A will become enemies with B's and C's previous friends.       - A will become friends with B and C. 4. Other cases can exist, such as all three being enemies or A being friends with both B and C, while B and C are enemies. Both of these situations are impossible as stated by the premise. 5. The structure of \\"friendship relationships\\" among any three residents A, B, and C proves that the entire city's relationship can be described simply: the city consists of two groups of residents (two parties M and mathbf{N}), such that:     - All residents belong to one party or the other but never both.     - Any two members of the same party are friends.     - Residents from different parties are enemies. 6. Now include another resident D:     - If A and B are friends and D is friends with any one of them, then D must be friends with the other and thus belong to the same party.     - If A and B are enemies, D can be friends with only one of them, but certainly one. 7. Proceed with this reasoning:     - By successively introducing one person into the city and integrating them into the existing groups, we can establish that the city can indeed be partitioned into two parties where everyone can become friends. 8. Therefore, the initial problem's proposition becomes straightforward once each party's dynamics are understood. In other words, we can propose that each day, one member from party M begins a new life (switches to party mathbf{N}).      - Eventually, for k members of a party M, they can all move to party mathbf{N} in k days, resulting in all residents becoming friends with each other across all the parties. # Conclusion: Every resident in the city can eventually become friends with every other resident, making it feasible to establish universal friendship within the city. boxed{text{All residents can become friends.}}"},{"instruction":"Calculate: 10  9^2 + 8 times 7 + 6^2  5 times 4 + 3  2^3.","output":"By the order of operations, we first address all exponentiation and multiplication before handling additions and subtractions: [ 10 - 9^2 + 8 times 7 + 6^2 - 5 times 4 + 3 - 2^3 ] [ = 10 - 81 + 56 + 36 - 20 + 3 - 8 ] Now, perform the additions and subtractions from left to right: [ 10 - 81 = -71 ] [ -71 + 56 = -15 ] [ -15 + 36 = 21 ] [ 21 - 20 = 1 ] [ 1 + 3 = 4 ] [ 4 - 8 = -4 ] Hence, the solution is boxed{-4}."},{"instruction":"Let each of  m  distinct points on the positive part of the  x axis be joined to  n  distinct points on the positive part of the  y axis.

From 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM is 8 hours, and each hour has 12 five-minute intervals (since 60 minutes / 5 minutes per interval = 12 intervals per hour). So, for the 8 hours, we have 8 hours * 12 intervals/hour = 96 intervals. From 5:00 PM to 5:55 PM is another 11 intervals (since 55 minutes / 5 minutes per interval = 11 intervals). Adding these together, we get 96 intervals + 11 intervals = 107 intervals. Now, since the museum sells tickets to a group of 30 people every 5 minutes, the total number of people who bought tickets is 107 intervals * 30 people/interval = 3210 people. Let's denote the number of student tickets as S and the number of regular tickets as R. According to the problem, R = 3S. Since every person buys a ticket, R + S = 3210. Substituting R with 3S, we get 3S + S = 3210, which simplifies to 4S = 3210. Dividing both sides by 4, we find S = 3210 / 4 = 802.5. Since we can't have half a ticket, let's round down to the nearest whole number, which is 802 (assuming we can't sell half a ticket, and we round down because we can't sell more tickets than there are people). So, there are 802 student tickets sold. Since R = 3S, R = 3 * 802 = 2406 regular tickets sold. Now, let's calculate the revenue from each type of ticket: Revenue from student tickets = 802 tickets * 4/ticket = 3208. Revenue from regular tickets = 2406 tickets * 8/ticket = 19248.

Since the radius of the circle is 10 feet, and the distance from the origin to the center of the circle is 5 feet, the total distance from the origin to the farthest point on the circle can be found by adding these two distances: [d_{text{total}} = d_{text{center to origin}} + text{radius}] [d_{text{total}} = 5 + 10] [d_{text{total}} = 15] Therefore, the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is boxed{15} feet."},{"instruction":"The sets ( A ) and ( B ) form a partition of positive integers if ( A cap B = emptyset ) and ( A cup B = mathbb{N} ).

(We count ( A, B ) and ( B, A ) as the same partition.) b) How many partitions for which the set ( P ) of all powers of 2 is prohibited are there? What if we require in addition that ( P subseteq A )?","output":"**Part a)**   We need to determine the number of partitions for which the set (F) of all Fibonacci numbers is prohibited. **Step 1: Define Fibonacci numbers** We define the Fibonacci numbers ({f_i}) by: [ begin{cases} f_1 = 1,  f_2 = 2,  f_{i+1} = f_i + f_{i-1} quad text{for} quad i geq 2. end{cases} ] Thus, the sequence begins as ( f_3 = 3, f_4 = 5, dots ) **Step 2: Show that there exists no more than one acceptable partition** To demonstrate this, we assume (A cup B = mathbb{N}) and (A cap B = emptyset), with (F) as the prohibited set. Without loss of generality, we can assume that 1 is in (A). Next, suppose that up to some integer (k), we have been able to place each number (l < k) unambiguously, meaning we know whether (l) is in (A) or (B). Let (f_i) be the smallest Fibonacci number strictly greater than (k). Then (f_i) satisfies: [ f_i > k ] Define (d = f_i - k). This (d) is positive and less than (k) because if (f_i - k > k), then we have: [ 2k < f_i implies k < f_i / 2 leq f_{i-1} ] This contradicts the minimal condition of (f_i). Therefore, we can conclude (d < k), and we already know to which set (d) belongs since (d < k). **Step 3: Assign (k) to the opposite set of (d)** Since (d = f_i - k) is already in one of the sets (either (A) or (B)), we have no choice but to place (k) in the other set; otherwise, we would have (k) and (d) in the same set. Since: [ k + d = f_i ] This would violate the condition that (F) is prohibited. Hence, there exists no more than one partition where (F) is prohibited. **Step 4: Establish the existence of such a partition** Now, we show how to construct this partition recursively. Suppose we have correctly partitioned all integers up to some number (k). Construct sets recursively as follows: Let the smallest Fibonacci number greater than (k) be (f_i) as earlier. For each new number (k), place it in the set opposite to (f_i - k). Suppose, by contradiction, there exists a smallest (m) such that (n + m = f_i) for some (n < m), both (m, n) are in the same set (say (A)). Let (f_j) be the smallest Fibonacci number greater than (m). Then: [ f_{j-1} leq m < f_j Rightarrow f_{j-1} < m + n < 2f_j leq f_{j+2} ] Since (m + n = f_j) is excluded by construction, it must be that (m + n = f_{j+1}). On the other hand, for (hat{m} = f_j - m) and (hat{n} = f_j - n), we get a consistent recursive construction proving that: [ hat{m}, hat{n} text{if any issues existed we would find them under similar recursion.} ] Thus, an acceptable partition exists, and it is constructed as desired. # Conclusion Thus, the answer to part a) is that there is only one acceptable partition where the set of Fibonacci numbers (F) is prohibited. boxed{1} **Part b)**   **Step 1: Define the partitioning with powers of 2 prohibited** We need to prove: Given a partition of the set of all powers of 2, say into sets (Q) and (R), there exists a unique partition of positive integers (A) and (B) such that all powers of 2 are prohibited and (Q subseteq A) and (R subseteq B). **Step 2: Prove uniqueness of the partition** Assume without loss of generality that 1 is in (A). Suppose all integers up to (k) have been placed unambiguously. If (k) is a power of 2, then its placement is predetermined by (Q) and (R). If not, let (2^i) be the smallest power of 2 greater than (k): [ d = 2^i - k quad text{with} quad d < k ] By the earlier assumption, (d) has already been placed in (A) or (B). For the prohibition rule to hold, (k) must be placed in the opposite set to (d). Hence, this determines the placement uniquely. **Step 3: Show the partition’s existence** We construct (A) and (B) recursively as outlined earlier. If there are contradictions, e.g., (n + m = 2^i) for integers (m, n) within the same set, contradictions arise similarly negating the existence of such pairs and proving such construction works consistently without conflicts. # Conclusion: Thus, there exist infinitely many partitions of integers with powers of 2 prohibited and only one partition such that (P subseteq A). boxed{infty} and boxed{1} (for the case ( P subseteq A ))"},{"instruction":"The ratio of the areas of two squares is frac{50}{98}.

We need to show that such pairs can always be generated such that both n and n+1 are \\"pretty numbers\\" (numbers whose prime factorization have each prime raised to at least the power of 2). 2. **Construct a new pretty number:**    Define a new number m = 4n(n+1). Notice that m must be a pretty number because:    - m is the product involving (4n) and (n+1), where both terms are made up of primes raised to at least the power of 2.    - Specifically, 4n(n+1) involves 4 (which is 2^2) and the primes in n and n+1. 3. **Find a related number which is also a square:**        Next, consider the expression 4n(n+1) + 1.

Step-by-Step Proof 1. **Initial Case for (m = 1)**:     - If m = 1, each set consists of at least one interval. Selecting this interval obviously satisfies the conditions as there is only one interval. 2. **General Case for ( m > 1 )**:     - We will proceed by induction and describe a method for selecting the intervals one by one.     - For each set ( L_i ), consider the right endpoint of the first interval from the left. Let us denote these right endpoints and the corresponding intervals. 3. **Selection of Interval ( I_1 )**:     - Choose the interval I_1 such that its right endpoint is the smallest among all the first intervals of each ( L_i ).      - If there are multiple intervals with the same smallest right endpoint, select a right-open interval. If no such interval exists, choose one arbitrarily. 4. **Removal of Associated Sets and Endpoint Arguments**:     - Remove the set from which (I_1) was selected and the leftmost interval from each remaining set.     - Repeat the selection process iteratively for the remaining sets until no sets are left. 5. **Ensuring Non-overlapping Intervals**:     - After the first step, there will remain ( m - 1 ) sets, with each set still containing at least ( m - 1 ) intervals.     - We need to show that ( I_1 ) does not overlap with any interval selected in subsequent steps.     - If there is an interval ( I' ) in some set ( L_j ) that overlaps with ( I_1 ), we know ( I' ) must be the first interval in ( L_j ) after removing the leftmost one. 6. **Utilizing the Smallest Endpoint**:     - Let ( b ) be the left endpoint of ( I' ). If there was an interval ( I'' ) in ( L_j ) to the left of ( I' ), then:         - If ( b ) is less than the right endpoint of ( I_1 ), similarly ( I'' )'s right endpoint would be even less, contradicting the choice of ( I_1 ).         - If ( b ) equals the right endpoint of ( I_1 ), then ( I' ) must be closed on the left where ( I_1 ) is open on the right. Hence no overlap. 7. **Conclusion by Induction**:     - The procedure can repeatedly be applied until ( m ) intervals are selected, ensuring the maximal non-overlapping intervals required.  This establishes the statement that it is possible to select from each set ( L_i ) one interval such that no two chosen intervals overlap as long as they each have at least ( m ) pairwise disjoint intervals. # Additional Note on the Sharpness of the (leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2} rightrfloor) Bound - For ( n leq 6 ), it has been shown that the bound (leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2} rightrfloor) is tight. - In general, the bound is (left(1 - frac{1}{e}right)(n+1)), which indicates a fraction of approximately 0.63212 of ( (n+1) ).

Thus, we can factor out the sum of all ( a_i ) as follows:    [    S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{12} = 3 left( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{12} right)    ] 3. **Calculate Specific Values:**    Since ( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{12} = 1 + 2 + cdots + 12 ), we have:    [    a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{12} = frac{12 cdot 13}{2} = 78    ]    Therefore:    [    S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{12} = 3 times 78 = 234    ] 4. **Average of the Sums:**    The average of these sums is:    [    frac{S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{12}}{12} = frac{234}{12} = 19.5    ] 5. **Conclusion on Minimum Sum:**    Since the sums ( S_i ) are integers, at least one of them must be at least 20. This proves that there is always a sum of three consecutive numbers which is at least 20.  6. **Addressing the Second Part of the Problem:**    It claims to show there is always a sum greater than 20. Suppose for contradiction that all sums ( S_i ) are at most 20. Then consider the number of sums that are exactly 20 and number that are less. 7. **Analyzing the Counts:**    If there are fewer than 6 sums that are exactly 20, then:    [    5 times 20 + 7 times 19 < 233    ]    which is only 233, contradicting the total sum of 234. So, there must be at least 6 sums each valued at 20. Now, if there are 7 or more sums of exactly 20, there are two consecutive sums both equal to 20:    [    S_i = S_{i+1} = 20    ]    leading to:    [    a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} = 20    ]    Therefore:    [    a_{i-1} = a_{i+2},    ]    which is a contradiction since all numbers are unique. Thus, exactly 6 sums can be 20. 8. **Examining Critical Condition:**    To maintain the sum of 234, the other six sums must be strictly 19:    [    6 times 20 + 6 times 19 = 234    ]    Then sums alternate between 20 and 19, but this leads to: 9. **Absurdity in Structure:**    Considering the sums involving groups like ( a_1, a_4, a_7, a_{10} ) (figure 1 from the problem):    [    |a_4 - a_7| geq 2 Rightarrow |S_5 - S_6| = |a_4 + a_5 + a_6 - (a_5 + a_6 + a_7)| geq 2    ]    This adjacency contradiction shows that not all sums can be 20 or lesser, proving there must be a sum greater than 20. 10. **Final Conclusion:**    Therefore, the arrangement necessitates a maximum sum greater than 20, and examination of figures supports that:    [    boxed{21}    ]"},{"instruction":"A can do a work in 9 days.

When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate = A's work rate + B's work rate Combined work rate = (1/9) + (1/18) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 18 in this case: Combined work rate = (2/18) + (1/18) Combined work rate = 3/18 We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: Combined work rate = (3 ÷ 3) / (18 ÷ 3) Combined work rate = 1/6 This means that A and B working together can complete 1/6 of the work in one day.

Therefore, boxed{text{B is incorrect}}. For option C, if c = 6, then k = 4, making a = 14 and b = 10. Again, using the Law of Cosines to find cos A and subsequently sin A, we determine the area of triangle ABC to be 15sqrt{3}, not 15. Hence, boxed{text{C is incorrect}}. For option D, if b+c = 8, then k = 2, leading to a = 7, b = 5, and c = 3. Calculating cos A and sin A as before, and using the Law of Sines to find the radius of the circumcircle, we find it to indeed be frac{7sqrt{3}}{3}. Therefore, boxed{text{D is correct}}. Thus, the correct choices are boxed{text{A and D}}."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],I={key:0},R={key:1};function M(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),v(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",W,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
