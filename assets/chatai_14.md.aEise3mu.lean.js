We need to prove that after several reflections off the sides, the ball will fall into the top left corner pocket. 1. **Identify the starting and ending points:**    The ball starts from the bottom left corner ((0, 0)), and we are to show it will end at the top left corner ((0, 1965)). 2. **Understand the trajectory of the ball:**    At an angle of (45^circ), the ball's path can be represented by the equation ( y = x ). However, this path will reflect off the sides of the table. To understand the reflections, we can use a method of 'unfolding' the table, which involves reflecting the table itself and tracing the ball's path in a straight line through multiple copies of the table. 3. **Extend the billiard table:**    We extend the billiard table by reflecting it across its borders to create a grid of reflections:    - Horizontal distance covered in one bounce: 26    - Vertical distance covered in one bounce: 1965 4. **Find the effective distance the ball travels in the extended grid:**    Since the slope of the ball's trajectory is 1 (45 degrees), the number of horizontal and vertical units it travels must match to form a 45 degree trajectory. Thus, we check for the ratio of the number of horizontal units needed to match 1965 vertical units:        [    frac{1965}{26} = 75.576923    ]    This implies the ball will indeed travel a multiples of 26 horizontally to match vertical travel until it aligns. 5. **Identify the top left corner in the reflected grid:**    The starting at ((0, 0)), in reflection process over the 'unfolded' table, the actual top is:        The ball reaches exactly the top after (m = frac{1965}{26} = 75.576923)    Hence the nearest integer would confirm placement to the extent it exactly completes within bounds. 6. **Generalizing with equal ratios ensuring proper placements:**    Continuing step-by-step with reflections of walls until the target ( top-left.

We are required to color the faces of the icosahedron in five colors such that no two faces sharing a vertex have the same color. This type of coloring implies a unique distribution of colors up to rotations and color permutations. 2. **Distance Definitions:**    Define the distance between two faces of an icosahedron as the minimum number of edge crossings required to travel from one face to the other. For a face of the icosahedron, it would have neighbors at distances 1, 2, 3, and 4 from it. 3. **Distances Between Faces:**    - For any given face, three faces are at distance 1.    - Six faces are at distance 2.    - Six faces are at distance 3.    - Three faces are at distance 4.    - One face is at distance 5 (the face diametrically opposite). 4. **Coloring Analysis:**    Consider a specific red face. According to the problem's constraints, faces that are at distance 1 or 2 cannot be red. If we color the face diametrically opposite to the initial red face as red, the remaining faces must be arranged in such a way that the coloring constraint (no shared vertices) is still respected. 5. **Constraint Verification:**    Further examining the faces at distances 3 and 4, at distance 4, we can choose up to three more faces to be red while maintaining the constraint. In this configuration:    - Up to three faces at distance 3 from the initial face can be red.    - Alternatively, face configurations would ensure we have an even distribution of colored faces per the icosahedron’s symmetry. 6. **Geometric Symmetry:**    The valid coloring results in exactly four faces being red, as this will satisfy the unique defined coloring constraints. This symmetry distributes faces such that planes of any monochromatic set form a tetrahedron. 7. **Sum of Distances Property:**    - For any point inside a regular tetrahedron, the sum of distances from the point to each face is constant and equals the altitude of the tetrahedron.     - Since our colored faces (like those of red or blue set) are symmetrically distributed within the icosahedron, the same property holds. 8. **Conclusion:**    Since the distances from any internal point to the symmetrical distribution of colored faces (red or blue) sum up to the same constant, we assert that for any point inside the icosahedron, the sum of the distances from the point to the red faces equals the sum of the distances to the blue faces. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let ( a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ldots ) be an infinite sequence of positive real numbers such that for all ( n geq 1 ), [ a_{n} leq a_{2n} + a_{2n+1} ] Prove that there exists an ( N geq 1 ) such that [ sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{n} > 1 ]","output":"To solve the problem, we will use a technique based on induction. 1. **Base Case**:     We start with ( k = 1 ).

Given a set of four noncoplanar points, how many equalizer planes are there?","output":"Let's consider four non-coplanar points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). A plane ( p ) is called an equalizing plane if the distances from each of these points to ( p ) are equal. Let's examine the possible configurations and how many such planes exist. 1. **Case i) All Points on the Same Side:**    If all four points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) are on the same side of plane ( p ), then a contradiction arises. Given the non-coplanarity of the points:    - Imagine moving plane ( p ) parallel to itself until it contains one of these points. This results in a plane containing all four points, contradicting the non-coplanarity assumption.    Therefore, all four points cannot be on the same side of the equalizing plane ( p ). 2. **Case ii) One Point on One Side and Three Points on the Other:**    Suppose point ( A ) is on one side of plane ( p ) and points ( B, C, ) and ( D ) are on the other side.    - The plane ( p ) must be parallel to the plane determined by points ( B, C, ) and ( D ) (denote this plane by ( q )).    - Moreover, plane ( p ) will intersect the segment extending from ( A ) perpendicular to ( q ) at its midpoint to ensure equal distances.    This configuration yields a unique equalizing plane for each combination of choosing the \\"isolated\\" point:        - Isolating ( A ), leaving {B, C, D} on the other side,    - Isolating ( B ), leaving {A, C, D} on the other side,    - Isolating ( C ), leaving {A, B, D} on the other side,    - Isolating ( D ), leaving {A, B, C} on the other side.        Thus, there are exactly 4 such planes for this configuration. 3. **Case iii) Two Points on Each Side:**    Suppose points ( A ) and ( B ) are on one side of plane ( p ), while points ( C ) and ( D ) are on the other side.    - Consider plane ( r ) passing through points ( A ) and ( B ) and parallel to the segment ( CD ).    - Similarly, consider plane ( s ) passing through points ( C ) and ( D ) and parallel to the segment ( AB ).        Planes ( r ) and ( s ) are therefore parallel. The equalizing plane ( p ) in this case is exactly midway (equidistant) between these two parallel planes ( r ) and ( s ). Each choice of pair formations on either side gives a distinct equalizing plane:        - Pairing ( A ) with ( B ) and ( C ) with ( D ),    - Pairing ( A ) with ( C ) and ( B ) with ( D ),    - Pairing ( A ) with ( D ) and ( B ) with ( C ).    Therefore, there are 3 such equalizing planes in this scenario. # Conclusion: Summing up the configurations provides the total number of unique equalizing planes: [ 4 text{ (from one isolated point) } + 3 text{ (from two pairs of points on each side) } = 7 ] Thus, there are a total of: [ boxed{7} ]"},{"instruction":"There is an infinite arithmetic progression, all terms of which are natural numbers.

The total cost of having the manuscript typed is the sum of the first-time typing cost and the revision costs, which is given as 1360. So, we have the equation: [ 200x + 80 times 3 + 20 times 3 times 2 = 1360 ] Now, let's calculate the revision costs: [ 80 times 3 = 240 ] [ 20 times 3 times 2 = 120 ] Adding these together gives us: [ 240 + 120 = 360 ] Now, we can substitute this into our equation: [ 200x + 360 = 1360 ] Subtract 360 from both sides to isolate the term with ( x ): [ 200x = 1360 - 360 ] [ 200x = 1000 ] Now, divide both sides by 200 to solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{1000}{200} ] [ x = 5 ] Therefore, the cost per page for the first time a page is typed is boxed{5} ."},{"instruction":"Let e be the base of the natural logarithm.

For a fraction to be negative, the numerator and denominator must have opposite signs. Since the numerator (x-1) and denominator (x-3) are linear expressions, we can easily find their zeros at x=1 and x=3, respectively. Plotting these on a number line and testing intervals, we find that the inequality holds for 1 lt x lt 3. 2. **Translate the condition |x-a| lt 2:** This absolute value inequality means that the distance between x and a is less than 2. Solving this inequality, we get two conditions: x-a lt 2 and -(x-a) lt 2, which simplify to x lt a+2 and x > a-2. Combining these gives a-2 lt x lt a+2. 3. **Combine the conditions:** The problem states that dfrac{x-1}{x-3} lt 0 is a sufficient but not necessary condition for |x-a| lt 2. This means every x that satisfies the first inequality must also satisfy the second, but not all x that satisfy the second must satisfy the first. Therefore, the range of x values from the first condition (1 lt x lt 3) must be entirely contained within the range from the second condition (a-2 lt x lt a+2). 4. **Determine the range of a:** For the range 1 lt x lt 3 to be contained within a-2 lt x lt a+2, the endpoints of the second inequality must accommodate the endpoints of the first.

Prove that it is possible to remove the two points of one color and still preserve the aforementioned property for the remaining points.","output":"To prove the given statement, we follow these detailed steps: 1. **Definitions and Initial Setup**:    - Define a \\"good\\" arrangement as one that satisfies the conditions of the problem.    - Consider the (2n) points on the circle as (A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, ldots, A_n, B_n), with (A_i) and (B_i) each having the color (i). 2. **Circle Division and Segment Properties**:    - According to the problem, if (A_i) and (B_i) are not adjacent on the circle, they divide the circle into two arcs.    - For every color (i), there exists a color (j) ((j neq i)) such that one point of color (j) lies on one arc and the other point on the other arc. This implies arc (A_i B_i) intersects arc (A_j B_j). 3. **Graphical Representation**:    - Consider a graph (G) where each vertex (C_i) corresponds to a color, and an edge exists between (C_i) and (C_j) if arc (A_i B_i) intersects arc (A_j B_j).    - The earlier conclusion implies that for any (1 leq i leq n), there exists (j) with (1 leq j leq n) and (j neq i), such that vertices (C_i) and (C_j) are connected by an edge. 4. **Base Case for (n = 2)**:    - If (n=2), there are four points. The only arrangement that satisfies the conditions is (1, 2, 1, 2). This corresponds to a connected graph (G). 5. **Proof by Induction**:    - Assume for (n geq 3), any good arrangement results in graph (G) being connected.    - If there's an arc (L) with (k) colors, where (1 leq k leq n-1), this arc must intersect other points such that total (2n - 1) points can be covered by (L).    - Suppose (L) does not cover every color, then by similar analysis, (G) becomes disconnected, forming a contradiction. 6. **Maximal Connected Subgraph**:    - Assume a non-good arrangement leads to a disconnected graph (G). Let (G^*) be the largest connected subgraph with (l) vertices ((2 leq l leq n-1)).    - The (2l) points associated with these vertices partition the circle into segments following their colors (A_1, B_1, ldots, A_l, B_l). 7. **Verification of Remaining Colors**:    - There exists an arc (PQ) containing these (2l) color points. The complementary arc contains the rest of the points.    - Since the arrangement is good, any remaining point (A_j) lies in (PQ) and the other corresponding point (B_j) in the complement. 8. **Final Analysis for Graph (G)**:    - Since intersections are required, graph (G) must be connected. If it were not, contradictions arise as earlier discussed. 9. **Tree and One Vertex Removal**:    - Given (G)'s connectivity, suppose (G) forms a connected tree ( tilde{G} ).    - Removing leaf vertices of this tree leaves it still a tree and connected.    - By removing points (A_n) and (B_n), which correspond to a vertex and its edges, the graph (G) remains connected, proving the statement. With this comprehensive analysis, we conclude that even after removing points of one color, the properties still hold, hence the good arrangement persists.

Since we want the minimum positive value of a and given that a = frac{16x - 25}{x(x-1)} achieves its minimum for x = frac{25}{16}, we find that value: [ a = frac{16 cdot frac{25}{16} - 25}{frac{25}{16} cdot (frac{25}{16}-1)} = frac{25 - 25}{frac{25}{16} cdot frac{9}{16}} = frac{0}{frac{225}{256}} = 0] Since a has to be a positive real number, the minimum positive value is reached immediately after x = frac{25}{16}, due to the continuous nature of the function. 9.

(b) Will the kingdom be able to replace all the old banknotes in the treasury?","output":"Let's categorize the problem into two parts as given: 1. Calculating the number of days required to replace 90% of the old banknotes. 2. Determining whether the entire amount of old banknotes can be replaced within the given budget and constraints.  Part (a): 1. **Initialization**:    The total number of old banknotes in the treasury is 3628,800. 2. **First Day's Production**:    On the first day, the machine can produce half of these banknotes:    [    text{Banknotes on Day 1} = frac{3628,800}{2} = 1814,400    ] 3. **Decision Making for Repair**:    It is effective to carry out the major repair on the second day as it increases the capacity to produce new banknotes up to 1,000,000, which is more than the production capabilities without repair. Here is a detailed cost-benefit analysis:       - **Without Repair**: Total production of banknotes without repair:      - Second Day: frac{1814,400}{3} = 604,800      - Total for two days without repair:         [        1814,400 + 604,800 = 2,419,200 text{ banknotes}        ]      - **With Repair**: Cost of repair 700,000 and 90,000 per day for operations remaining (90,000 each additional day including repairs):      - Second Day post repair: Total banknotes on second day        - 1,000,000 plus first day's total = 1,814,400 + 1,000,000 = 2,814,400      - All subsequent days could produce 1,000,000.    Therefore, conducting the repair allows for an increased daily production of 1,000,000 banknotes, benefiting in subsequent days until the replacement is completed. 4. **Expected Production After Repair**:    Maximum possible releases:    - First day: 1,814,400    - Second day (post repair): 1,000,000    - Third day: 1,000,000    - Fourth day: 1,000,000 total up to third day would be 3,814,400.    5. **Verification**:    text{90%} of the old banknotes:    [    0.9 times 3628,800 = 3265,920 text{ banknotes}    ]    The requirement is to have 3265,920 out of 3628,800 (old banknotes). 6. **Conclusion**:    With three production days including the repair day within the budget, the replacement amount using no repair gets exceeded:    [    0.6M (frac{3,600,000 geq 90 %}) rightarrow quad text{Thus Time taken is:} ; boxed{3 text{ Days}}    ]  Part (b): 1.

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the breadth. So we have: Area = Length × Breadth 102400 = 4x × x 102400 = 4x^2 To find x, we divide both sides by 4: x^2 = 102400 / 4 x^2 = 25600 Taking the square root of both sides, we get: x = √25600 x = 160 Now we have the dimensions of the park: Length = 4x = 4 × 160 = 640 meters Breadth = x = 160 meters The perimeter of the park is the distance the man cycles in one round.

Is there a lattice point whose distance from every visible lattice point is at least 1995 units?","output":"The problem asks if there exists a lattice point whose distance from all visible lattice points is at least 1995 units.   Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Definition of Visible Lattice Points**:    - A lattice point ((x, y)) is considered visible if (gcd(x, y) = 1), which means that (x) and (y) are relatively prime integers. 2. **Choosing Prime Numbers**:    - Let (p_1, p_2, p_3, ldots) be the sequence of prime numbers. 3. **Product Construction**:    - We construct large integers by taking products of consecutive prime numbers:      - (A_1 = p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_k)      - (A_2 = p_{k+1} cdot p_{k+2} cdot ldots cdot p_{2k})      - (A_i = p_{(i-1)k+1} cdot p_{(i-1)k+2} cdot ldots cdot p_{ik}) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, k)    - Since (A_i) are products of distinct sets of primes, they are pairwise relatively prime. 4. **Values for Coordinates**:    - Assume integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k in mathbb{N}) (positive integers) exist such that (A_1 a_1, A_2 a_2, ldots, A_k a_k) are consecutive positive integers.    - Similarly, choose (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k in mathbb{N}) such that (B_1 b_1, B_2 b_2, ldots, B_k b_k) form another sequence of consecutive positive integers:      - (B_1 = p_1)      - (B_2 = p_2), and so on. 5. **Coordinate Lattice Square**:    - Consider the points ((x, y)) where (x) and (y) are taken from (A_i a_i) and (B_j b_j) respectively, for (1 leq i, j leq k).    - The pairs (A_i a_i) and (B_j b_j) are divisible by (p_{(i-1)k+j}), ensuring (gcd(A_i a_i, B_j b_j) ne 1). 6. **No Visible Points**:    - Hence, any lattice point of the form ((A_i a_i, B_j b_j)) for (1 leq i, j leq k) is not visible, since their coordinates share common prime factors. 7. **Choosing (k)**:    - Set (k = 2 cdot 1995 + 1).    - The grid of points ((x, y)) based on this (k) ensures that both (|x|) and (|y|) need to be greater than 1995 to include visible points. 8. **Geometric Interpretation**:    - A lattice square constructed this way ensures no visible points within it.    - Hence, the center of this square will have each visible point outside a distance of 1995 units. # Conclusion: We have shown a method to construct such a lattice point. Therefore, there indeed exists a lattice point whose distance from all visible lattice points is at least 1995 units.

Assume we number the islands consecutively around the circle. 2. **Consider movements**:    Each day, two ships move the same number of islands in the direction of their choice. This implies both ships land on islands with numbers that differ by exactly the difference in their starting points plus the chosen steps (since they are moving a circular path, modulo 1002). 3. **Introduce Coloring and Parity Argument**:    To use a parity argument, color the islands based on the parity (even or odd) of their numbers:    - Color islands with even numbers (0, 2, 4, ..., 1000) as black.    - Color islands with odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 1001) as white.    This evenly splits the 1002 islands into 501 black islands and 501 white islands. 4. **Count initial ships on each color**:    Initially, the ships are distributed such that there are an odd number of ships in total (1002). Since they are initially distributed among 501 black and 501 white islands:    - If there are ( x ) ships on black islands and ( y ) ships on white islands initially, ( x + y = 1002 ). 5. **Conservation of parity**:    When two ships move from their starting islands, the parity of the number of ships on black and white islands must be maintained. Specifically:    - If both ships start on black islands, they move together hence they land on islands of maintaining parity among black and white as even changes do not alter parity.    - If both ships start on white islands, the same logic applies.    - If one ship starts on a black island and another on a white island, they similarly maintain parity. 6. **Consequence of parity maintenance**:    At every point in time, the parity of ships on black and white islands remains unchanged. Consequently, there will always be at least one ship on a black island and at least one ship on a white island. 7. **Unable to gather all ships at one location**:    Since it is impossible for there to be zero or an even number of ships on either set of colored islands given an odd number initially, it follows that not all ships can be located on a single island (since that would require the total number of ships on other color to be zero). # Conclusion: Agamemnon will not be able to gather all his ships on a single island. boxed{text{No}}"},{"instruction":"Let (ABCD) be a convex quadrilateral and (P) be a point on ([AB]).

For our purposes, the key insights involve counting the number of edges we encounter in our traversal:     - Each side of the 3 times 5 rectangle is divided into a grid of 1 times 1 squares, leading to it having 38 unit edges (as there are (3+1) times 5 + (5+1) times 3 - 12 = 20 + 18 = 38 distinct unit edges). 3. To find the maximum possible path length that moves along these 1x1 squares, we must consider the specific property that no edge is traversed more than once:     - This includes vertical or horizontal movements between adjacent vertices (i.e., vertices of the individual 1x1 squares). 4. We begin by analyzing the number of distinct edges in our grid:     - The rectangle subdivides into 15 smaller squares (3times 5=15).     - These edges are counted uniquely since we are not allowed to revisit any edge.  5. Now, let's observe a Hamiltonian path that starts at vertex ( A ) and ends at vertex ( C ):     - A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once.     - The maximum length of such a path will utilize nearly all edges. The traversal maximizes edge coverage without repeating any. 6. Using theoretical considerations and knowing every internal edge will increment by 2 sides and boundary edges will increment by 1, we derive:     - Each intermediate vertex getting degrees higher than 2 implies internal crossing in our grid.     - Only vertices with degrees exactly 2 contribute without divergence or path splitting. 7. Comparisons show structured paths efficiently cover the entire traversal maximally gives out precisely 38-8=30 edges measure:    [    38 left(text{total edges}right) - 8 left(text{edge redundancy in multi-turn}right) = 30 text{ edges in maximal coverage without overlap}.    ]  8.

Prove that it is possible to select 51 boxes in such a way that they contain at least half of all the apples, at least half of all the oranges, and at least half of all the bananas.","output":"1. **Lemma Statement and Preliminary Assertion:**     Consider any (2n) pairs of positive numbers (left(a_i, b_iright)). The lemma asserts that these pairs can be divided into two groups of (n) pairs each such that the sum of (a_i)'s in the first group differs from the sum of (a_i)'s in the second group by no more than the maximum (a_i), and similarly for the sums of (b_i)'s. 2. **Ordering and Grouping:**    Sort the pairs ((a_i, b_i)) in descending order based on (a_i). Label the pairs with indices (2i-1) and (2i) as \\"double pairs.\\" If we divide the pairs into two groups (where each double pair falls into separate groups), it ensures that the difference between the sums of (a_i)'s in each group is bounded by the maximum (a_i). 3. **Mathematical Justification for Grouping:**    Assign the pairs as follows:    [    text{Group 1: } { (a_1, b_1), (a_3, b_3), ldots, (a_{2n-1}, b_{2n-1}) }    ]    [    text{Group 2: } { (a_2, b_2), (a_4, b_4), ldots, (a_{2n}, b_{2n}) }    ]    The sum of the (a_i)'s difference for these groups is:    [    left(a_1 - a_2right) + left(a_3 - a_4right) + cdots + left(a_{2n-1} - a_{2n}right) leq a_1    ] 4. **Handling the ( b_i )'s Similarly:**    Similarly, the sums of (b_i)'s in the two groups will have the same property:    [    left(b_1 - b_2right) + left(b_3 - b_4right) + cdots + left(b_{2n-1} - b_{2n}right) leq b_1    ] 5. **Adjusting Groups for Equal Distribution:**    If the sums in the two groups are not as required, adjust them by swapping pairs from different groups:    - If the sum of (b_i)'s in Group 1 exceeds that in Group 2, swap the necessary pairs to balance the distribution. Each swap does not increase the imbalance by more than the maximum (b_i). 6. **Application to the Problem:**    Given 100 boxes, select the box with the greatest number of oranges. Then choose from the remaining boxes the one with the greatest number of apples. Using the lemma, divide the remaining 98 boxes into two groups of 49 each with similar sum properties. 7. **Ensuring the Required Distribution:**    Add the two initially chosen boxes (with the largest count of oranges and apples) to the group where the number of bananas is not minimally fewer than in the other group. This ensures that the final group of 51 boxes has at least half of the total apples, oranges, and bananas. Conclusion: Given the construction, it is guaranteed to form a subset of 51 boxes such that each subset contains at least half of the apples, half of the oranges, and half of the bananas from the total in the original 100 boxes.

[    = frac{1}{6} cdot frac{3 cdot 3}{15} = frac{1}{10}    ] 2. **Case ( X = 4 ):**    For there to be an equal number of red and white balls when 4 balls are drawn:    [    P(X=4) = frac{1}{6} cdot frac{binom{3}{2} cdot binom{3}{2}}{binom{6}{4}}    ]    Here, binom{3}{2} is the number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 3.    [    = frac{1}{6} cdot frac{3 cdot 3}{15} = frac{1}{10}    ] 3. **Case ( X = 6 ):**    For there to be an equal number of red and white balls when 6 balls are drawn, obviously we would have all the balls.    [    P(X=6) = frac{1}{6}    ] Summing these probabilities gives us the total probability that the number of red balls is equal to the number of white balls: [ P(text{equal number of red and white balls}) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 6) = frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{6} ] Converting frac{1}{6} to a common denominator: [ frac{1}{6} = frac{3}{18} = frac{5}{30} ] And adding: [ P(text{equal number of red and white balls}) = frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{6} = frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{6} ] Next, consider the fact that the probabilities that the number of red balls is greater or less than the number of white balls are symmetric: [ P(text{greater red}) = P(text{greater white}) ] Since there's a symmetry and the total probability equals 1: [ P(text{equal number}) + 2 cdot P(text{greater red}) = 1 ] Solving for ( P(text{greater red}) ): [ 2 cdot P(text{greater red}) = 1 - frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{6} = 1 - left(frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{6}right) = 1 - left(frac{6}{30} + frac{7}{42}right) = 1 - frac{1}{5} - frac{1}{6} = frac{19}{60} ] Therefore, the probability that the number of red balls drawn is greater than the number of white balls is: [ boxed{frac{19}{60}} ]"},{"instruction":"the coordinate plane, points A(1, 9), C(5, 8), D(8, 2), and E(2, 2) are given.

Therefore, statement D is correct. 3. **Intersection with the x-axis**: To find where the parabola intersects the x-axis, we set y=0 and solve for x:    [    -frac{1}{3}(x-2)^2+1=0 implies (x-2)^2=3    ]    Taking the square root of both sides gives:    [    x-2 = pmsqrt{3}    ]    Therefore, we find the x-intercepts by solving for x:    [    x_1 = 2 + sqrt{3}, quad x_2 = 2 - sqrt{3}    ]    This shows the parabola does indeed intersect the x-axis at two points.

Step 1: Understand the implication of the graph passing through the second and fourth quadrants. For a linear function to pass through these quadrants, its slope must be negative. This is because, in the second quadrant, x is negative and y is positive, and in the fourth quadrant, x is positive and y is negative. A negative slope means that as x increases, y decreases. Step 2: Analyze the slope of the given function. The slope of the function y = (1-m)x is (1-m). For the graph to pass through the second and fourth quadrants, (1-m) must be negative.

Find the total number of children in this group. 1. Let us denote the total sum of the ages of the children as S. Given S = 50. We are also given that there is a 10-year-old child, so let’s denote the sum of the ages of the other children as S'. Thus, S' = 50 - 10 = 40. 2. We know the maximum age among the other children is 13. Let us denote the number of children excluding the 10-year-old as n-1 and denote these ages as forming an arithmetic sequence. 3. Representing the arithmetic sequence, let’s denote the smallest age in the sequence by a and the common difference by d. The ages then are a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+(n-2)d.

In this case, since ( triangle DEF ) and ( triangle ABC ) are similar and perspective from point ( P ), they must be perspective from a line. 4. **Assume the contrary and derive a contradiction:**    Assume that ( P ) is not the centroid of ( triangle ABC ). Let ( FE ) and ( BC ) intersect at ( A_1 ), ( FD ) and ( CA ) intersect at ( B_1 ), and ( DE ) and ( AB ) intersect at ( C_1 ). By Desargues' Theorem, ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) should be collinear. 5. **Analyze the configuration:**    Without loss of generality, assume ( A_1 ) lies on the extension of ( CB ) beyond ( B ). By angle chasing, we find that ( B_1 ) lies on the extension of ( AC ) beyond ( C ), and ( C_1 ) lies on the extension of ( BA ) beyond ( A ). 6. **Check for collinearity:**    By Desargues' Theorem, ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) must be collinear. However, this configuration is impossible because it contradicts the properties of the triangle and the given similarity condition. 7. **Conclude that ( P ) must be the centroid:**    Since the assumption that ( P ) is not the centroid leads to a contradiction, we conclude that ( P ) must be the centroid of ( triangle ABC ).

This means that if x and y are equal but negative, the statement \\"ln x = ln y\\" does not hold because both sides are undefined.

This means that for any two positive real numbers x and y, if ln x = ln y, then it must be the case that x=y.

For x>0, we have g'(x)>0, leading to an increasing function, and for x<0, we have g'(x)<0, which indicates a decreasing function.

We need to determine the moments in time when the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock was exactly the same as it will be at 16:00 (i.e., 4:00 PM). 1. **Calculate the angle at 4:00 PM:**     - At 4:00 PM, the hour hand is at the 4th hour mark.     - Each hour mark represents 30 degrees because the full circle is 360 degrees divided by 12 hours.     - So, the hour hand is at (4 times 30^circ = 120^circ).     - The minute hand is at 0 minutes, which corresponds to 0 degrees.     The angle between the hour and minute hands at 4:00 PM is (120^circ). 2. **General formula for the angle between hour and minute hands:**     Let (M) be the number of minutes past the hour.     - The minute hand moves (6^circ) per minute (since (360^circ / 60 = 6^circ)).     - The hour hand moves (0.5^circ) per minute (since (30^circ / 60 = 0.5^circ)).

The LCM of 12 and 16 is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in either number.

Since the perimeter of the rectangle involves two lengths and two widths, our cost constraint can be written as:  2 times 3 times l + 2 times 5 times w leq 100.  Simplifying this gives us:  6l + 10w leq 100,  which can be further simplified to:  3l + 5w leq 50.  As we're looking to maximize the area A = lw of the rectangle and since l and w are integers, we can systematically test combinations of l and w to find the maximum product while satisfying the inequality 3l + 5w leq 50. Starting with the highest possible value for w that satisfies the budget constraint (ignoring l for the moment), we find that w = 10 would already cost 5 times 10 = 50 yuan, leaving no budget for the length, so w must be less than 10. Considering integer values for w, we start with w = 9 and find the maximum possible l:  3l + 5 times 9 leq 50,   3l + 45 leq 50,   3l leq 5,  which is not possible for any positive integer l.

This area is:  A = 5 times 7 = 35 , text{m}^2.  This is larger than our previous area and is now the area to beat. We should verify that no smaller w will give a larger product.

The area for these dimensions would be the same as with w = 6, so A = 36 , text{m}^2 was an incorrect finding. The correct area for w = 6, l = 6 is:  A = 6 times 6 = 36 , text{m}^2.  We continue to check for lower values of w (down to w = 1) to ensure that no larger area exists.

Since December's sales total is some multiple of A, we can denote December's sales total as M * A, where M is the multiple we want to find. The total sales for the year is the sum of the sales from January to November plus the sales in December. Since there are 11 months from January to November, the total sales from these months would be 11 * A. Adding December's sales, the total sales for the year would be 11 * A + M * A. According to the information given, December's sales total (M * A) is 0.15384615384615385 of the total sales for the year. This can be represented by the equation: M * A = 0.15384615384615385 * (11 * A + M * A) To find M, we can divide both sides of the equation by A: M = 0.15384615384615385 * (11 + M) Now, we can solve for M: M = 0.15384615384615385 * 11 + 0.15384615384615385 * M M = 1.6923076923076923 + 0.15384615384615385 * M Subtract 0.15384615384615385 * M from both sides to isolate M: M - 0.15384615384615385 * M = 1.6923076923076923 (1 - 0.15384615384615385) * M = 1.6923076923076923 0.8461538461538461 * M = 1.6923076923076923 Now, divide both sides by 0.8461538461538461 to solve for M: M = 1.6923076923076923 / 0.8461538461538461 M = 2 Therefore, the multiple of the average monthly sales total for January through November that December's sales total was is boxed{2} ."},{"instruction":"Calculate sec(405^circ).","output":"Using the definition of secant, we have: [ sec(405^circ) = frac{1}{cos(405^circ)} ] Since the cosine function has a period of 360^circ, we can simplify 405^circ as follows: [ cos(405^circ) = cos(405^circ - 360^circ) = cos(45^circ) ] Therefore, we know that: [ cos(45^circ) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] So, the secant of 405^circ is: [ sec(405^circ) = frac{1}{cos(45^circ)} = frac{1}{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} ] Thus, the final answer is: [ boxed{sqrt{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"The effect of changes in the dimension of a rectangle on its area is calculated when the length is increased by 35% and its breadth is decreased by some percentage.

Let's denote the center of the moving circle as point M. Here are the steps to enhance the solution: 1. Since the circle is tangent to the vertical line x = -1, the tangent point on the circle must have the same x-coordinate as the line, which is -1. 2. The center of the circle M must be to the right of the tangent point since the circle passes through (1, 0). This implies that the distance between the center M and the point of tangency must equal the radius of the circle, say r. 3. Therefore, if the center of the circle M has coordinates (x_m, y_m), then the point of tangency has coordinates (-1, y_m), since the y-coordinate must be the same for both points. 4. Using the fact that M passes through (1, 0), we can establish the distance from the center M to the point (1, 0) is also r. Therefore, r = sqrt{(x_m - 1)^2 + y_m^2}. 5. Because the distance from the center M to the tangent point (-1, y_m) is also r, we have r = x_m - (-1) = x_m + 1. 6. Equating these two expressions for r, we get sqrt{(x_m - 1)^2 + y_m^2} = x_m + 1. 7. Squaring both sides of the equation, we obtain (x_m - 1)^2 + y_m^2 = (x_m + 1)^2. 8. Expanding the squares and simplifying, we get x_m^2 - 2x_m + 1 + y_m^2 = x_m^2 + 2x_m + 1. 9. Further simplification gives us y_m^2 = 4x_m.

However, these numbers do not satisfy the condition that the sum of their digits should be 14 since:     - If a number is ( 900 ), digits are ( 9 + 0 + 0 = 9 )     - Hence, a number ending in ( 00 ) will have a digit sum ( leq 9 ), clearly less than 14. So this case isn't feasible. 4. Therefore, we consider numbers ending in ( 50 ).     - Let the three-digit number be represented as ( 950 ), ( 850 ), ( 750 ),... up to (150). We check the digit sums:       - For ( 950 ): ( 9 + 5 + 0 = 14 )       - For ( 850 ): ( 8 + 5 + 0 = 13 ) (does not satisfy the condition)       - Similarly, other combinations ( x50 ) where ( x ) varies from 1 to 8 will sum less than 14. 5.

For a hyperbola in standard form, the eccentricity e is given by  e = sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}}.  Also, the coordinates of the foci are (pm ae, 0), so the right focus is at (ae, 0). The asymptotes of a hyperbola are straight lines that pass through the center and have the slopes equal to pm frac{b}{a}. The equations of the asymptotes are therefore  y = pm frac{b}{a}x.  Since the problem states that the circle is tangent to one of the asymptotes, without loss of generality, let's consider the asymptote with the positive slope (y = frac{b}{a}x). The equation for the circle with radius equal to eccentricity e and centered at the right focus (ae, 0) is  (x - ae)^2 + y^2 = (ae)^2.   x^2 - 2aex + (ae)^2 + y^2 = (ae)^2.   x^2 - 2aex + y^2 = 0.

Since e = sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}}, this simplifies to:  x(frac{b^2}{a^2} + 1 - 2sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}}) = 0.  For a tangency point to exist, x cannot be zero because we are considering the point on the asymptote away from the origin. Therefore:  frac{b^2}{a^2} + 1 - 2sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}} = 0.

Tap A fills the bucket at a rate of 3 liters per minute. So, in 10 minutes, tap A would fill ( 3 times 10 = 30 ) liters. Since both taps working together fill the bucket in 10 minutes, the total volume of the bucket (36 liters) minus what tap A fills in 10 minutes (30 liters) gives us the amount tap B contributes in 10 minutes, which is ( 36 - 30 = 6 ) liters. Now, we know that tap B fills 6 liters in 10 minutes. To find out how much tap B fills in 20 minutes, we simply double the amount because 20 minutes is twice as long as 10 minutes.

For such a quadrilateral:          - If the center of the circle lies strictly inside the quadrilateral and not on its diagonals, then this quadrilateral will be called a \\"good\\" quadrilateral. In this scenario, out of the four triangles formed by the quadrilateral's vertices, exactly half (2 out of 4) will be acute-angled triangles. 3. **Calculating the Number of Good Quadrilaterals:**     - The problem states that exactly half of the triangles formed are acute-angled. To meet this, all quadrilaterals formed by any selection of four points must be \\"good\\" quadrilaterals. 4. **Identifiable Cases for Lower ( n ):**     - For ( n = 4 ), we can easily verify this condition by placing four points evenly spaced on the circle. Any quadrilateral formed in this manner is good, yielding 2 acute-angled triangles per 4 triangles each time a set of four points is considered.     - Similarly, for ( n = 5 ), the vertices of a regular pentagon also satisfy the condition. Every quadrilateral formed will be a \\"good\\" quadrilateral resulting in the desired number of acute-angled triangles. 5. **Analysis Beyond ( n = 5 ):**     - Suppose ( n > 5 ). Consider selecting a point ( A ) and drawing a diameter ( AA' ) through ( A ). If ( A' ) is also a marked point on the circle, any quadrilateral involving ( A ), ( A' ), and any other two points will not be a good quadrilateral (since both ( A ) and ( A' ) lie on the circle's diameter and are not on the same side). This guarantees that not all quadrilaterals will be good, thus failing to meet the condition that half the triangles formed are acute-angled. 6. **Conclusion:**     The condition where exactly half of the triangles are acute-angled can only be met when ( n = 4 ) or ( n = 5 ).

Assuming the sample is representative of the entire company, and there are 2000 employees in total, we can estimate the number in the entire company by setting up a proportion:  frac{20}{200} = frac{x}{2000}  Where x is the estimated number of employees living between 1000 and 2000 meters from the workplace in the entire company. Solving for x gives:  x = frac{20}{200} times 2000   x = frac{20}{1} times 10   x = 200  Therefore, it is estimated that there are boxed{200} employees in the entire company whose residence is between 1000 and 2000 meters away from the workplace."},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements is incorrect?

Therefore, the knights should be separated by 2 meters.       Computing distances:       - The distance 2 meters apart means islander 3 must be the knight if islander 1 is one.     - Therefore, islander 3 is a knight by our previous assumption.     - This leaves islanders 2 and 4 as liars since there are exactly 2 knights and 2 liars. 4. **Verification of Statements Consistency**:     - According to the fourth islander (who is a liar), the fellow tribesman should be 2 meters away, which contradicts the assumption since knights tell the truth and liars lie. 5. **Check for Contradiction**:     - From the statements, if both islander 1 and islander 4 are saying the same thing but one of them must be lying, we have a contradiction. Thus, our initial assumption that islander 1 is a knight must be false. 6. **Revised Assumption**:     - Assume islander 1 is a liar.     - Now, we need to reassess the positions. If islander 4 is also a liar, islands 2 and 3 must be honest knights. 7. **Checking Intermediate Islanders' (2 and 3) Consistency**:     - Islander 2 should be 1 meter away, and since they must be honest:         - Constraints check (distance must be 1 meter to their fellow tribesman):             - If islander 2 is 1 meter from islander 3; this is consistent and feasible.          - Resultantly, islander 3 will also say \\"1 meter\\" consistently. 8. **Conclusion**: Hence, the valid combinations consistent with knights and liars must be:     - The second islander (from the left) says \\"1 meter\\".     - The third islander (from the left) says \\"1 meter\\".

The interval (9.8, 10.2) can be expressed in terms of the mean and standard deviation as ((mu - 2sigma, mu + 2sigma)). We can standardize this interval and calculate the probability using the standard normal distribution, where the standardized variable (Z) follows a standard normal distribution N(0, 1). We convert X to Z by the formula (Z = frac{X - mu}{sigma}). So we have: [ P(9.8 < X < 10.2) = Pleft(frac{9.8 - 10}{0.1} < Z < frac{10.2 - 10}{0.1}right) = P(-2 < Z < 2) ] From the standard normal distribution table or using a calculator, we can find the probability associated with Z values between -2 and 2: [ P(-2 < Z < 2) = P(Z < 2) - P(Z < -2) approx 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544 ] Thus, the probability that a randomly selected bag of rice weighs between 9.8 kg and 10.2 kg is (boxed{0.9544})."},{"instruction":"John volunteers at a shelter twice a month for 3 hours at a time.

Let these perpendiculars meet ( BC ), ( AC ), and ( AB ) at points ( A' ), ( B' ), and ( C' ), respectively. 2. **Establishing the Parallelism:**     Notice that the perpendicular from ( A ) to ( BC ) implies that line ( AA' ) is parallel to the altitudes from ( B ) and ( C ). Similarly, ( BB' parallel AC ) and ( CC' parallel AB ). These parallel relationships indicate that we can form parallelograms by extending lines through appropriate points. 3. **Use of the Circumcircle:**     Since these altitudes intersecting at the vertices of the triangle meet at points equidistant from the circumcenter (by definition of the perpendicular bisectors being radii of the circumcircle), we can utilize properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. 4. **Properties of Parallelograms:**     Consider quadrilaterals ( ABA'C ), ( ACB'B ), and ( BCA'A ). Given the circumcircle and parallel properties, segments ( AA', BB', ) and ( CC' ) serve as altitudes and thus, form orthocenters opposite each vertex.      - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel.     - Consequently, we have:     [     AA' parallel BB' quad text{and} quad AA' = BB'     ]     This parallelism and equality imply that the triangles formed by the intersection of these altitudes and corresponding segments must be similar and equal in all aspects. 5. **Conclusion:**     By geometry, if two angles or sides are equal and the other identical due to orthogonality and equidistance from the circumcenter, we infer that the resultant figures (here, our triangles) are congruent.

From this, A, E, D, F form a cyclic quadrilateral (as opposite angles subtended by the same arc are equal). 3. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties**:     - Since A, E, D, F is cyclic, we have angle A F E = angle A D E.     - By given conditions, angle A D E = angle A B C.     - Thus, angle A F E = angle A B C. 4. **Proving Cyclic Quadrilateral A, B, C, F**:     - It is given that angle A E F = angle A F E = angle A B C.     - Additional property of cyclic quadrilateral tells us that angle A B C + angle A F C = 180^circ.      - So, A, B, C, F must also form a cyclic quadrilateral by definition. 5. **Intersecting Circles Theorem**:     - The circles odot A B C F and odot A F D E intersect at points F and A.     - By the property of intersecting circles (Intersection Property 2), triangle A D B sim triangle A E C.     - From the similarity relation, angle B A D = angle C A E. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Consequently, since angle B A D = angle C A E and given that angle A B C = angle A D E, it follows that angle B A C = angle D A E.

Given that the reduction is 40%, we can express the reduced price as: R = P - 0.40P R = 0.60P The housewife is able to obtain 10 kgs more for Rs. 2000 after the reduction. This means that for Rs. 2000, she can get 10 kgs more at the reduced price than she could at the original price. Let's calculate the amount of oil she could get for Rs. 2000 at the original price: Amount of oil at original price = 2000 / P After the reduction, she gets 10 kgs more for the same amount of money: Amount of oil at reduced price = (2000 / R) + 10 Since R = 0.60P, we can substitute R in the equation: Amount of oil at reduced price = (2000 / (0.60P)) + 10 We know that the amount of oil at the reduced price is equal to the amount of oil at the original price plus 10 kgs: 2000 / P + 10 = 2000 / (0.60P) Now, let's solve for P: 2000 / P + 10 = 3333.33 / P Multiplying both sides by P to get rid of the denominator: 2000 + 10P = 3333.33 Now, let's solve for P: 10P = 3333.33 - 2000 10P = 1333.33 P = 1333.33 / 10 P = 133.33 Now that we have the original price per kg (P), we can find the reduced price per kg (R): R = 0.60P R = 0.60 * 133.33 R = 79.998 Therefore, the reduced price per kg of oil is approximately Rs. boxed{80} ."},{"instruction":"Let f(x) = x^2  6x + 14 and let g(f(x)) = 3x + 4.

We need to show that ( A_{n+1} ) has eigenvalues ( -n-1, -n+1, ldots, n-1, n+1 ) with multiplicities ( binom{n+1}{0}, binom{n+1}{1}, ldots, binom{n+1}{n+1} ).

We start with:    [    x_{N-m} - (N-m)k leq x_N - Nk quad text{and} quad x_{N+m} - (N+m)k leq x_N - Nk    ]    Adding these inequalities gives:    [    x_{N-m} + x_{N+m} - (N-m)k - (N+m)k leq 2x_N - 2Nk    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    x_{N-m} + x_{N+m} leq 2x_N    ] 6. **Ensuring Arbitrarily Large ( N ):**    To ensure that we can find arbitrarily large ( N ), we need to carefully choose ( k ). Take ( k ) small enough, such that:    [    k < frac{x_{N+1} - x_N}{N+1}    ]    This choice ensures that:    [    x_{N+1} - (N+1)k > x_N    ]    Since ( x_{N+1} - (N+1)k > x_N ), and thus greater than all ( x_i - ik ) for ( i leq N ), the definition of ( N ) will keep increasing. Hence, ( N ) can be made arbitrarily large by choosing ( k ) appropriately small. # Conclusion: Thus, it can be concluded that there exist arbitrarily large ( N ) such that all of ( x_1 + x_{2N-1}, x_2 + x_{2N-2}, ldots, x_{N-1} + x_{N+1} ) are less than ( 2 x_N ).

This number can be written as ( 10x + 6 ).       *Explanation*: Appending a digit 6 to the right of the number ( x ) means multiplying ( x ) by 10 (shifting it one place to the left) and then adding 6. 3. According to the problem, the new three-digit number is 474 more than the original two-digit number ( x ). This can be expressed by the equation:    [    10x + 6 = x + 474    ] 4. To solve for ( x ), we need to isolate ( x ) on one side of the equation. Subtract ( x ) from both sides:    [    10x + 6 - x = 474    ] 5. Simplify the equation:    [    9x + 6 = 474    ] 6. Next, we'll isolate the term ( 9x ) by subtracting 6 from both sides:    [    9x = 474 - 6    ] 7. Compute the subtraction:    [    9x = 468    ] 8. Finally, solve for ( x ) by dividing both sides by 9:    [    x = frac{468}{9}    ] 9. Perform the division:    [    x = 52    ] 10. Therefore, the original two-digit number is ( 52 ). # Conclusion [ boxed{52} ]"},{"instruction":"Kevin starts with 100 red tokens and 100 blue tokens.

Square EFGH is inscribed with vertices on the diagonals of ABCD, so the side of EFGH is aligned along lines OE and OH as shown: [asy] size(200); pair A = (-1,1), B = (1,1), C = (1,-1), D = (-1,-1), O = (0,0); pair E = (-0.5, 0.5), F = (0.5, -0.5), G = (0.5, 0.5), H = (-0.5, -0.5); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(circle(O, sqrt(2))); draw(E--F--G--H--cycle); label(\\"A\\", A, NW); label(\\"B\\", B, NE); label(\\"C\\", C, SE); label(\\"D\\", D, SW); label(\\"E\\", E, NW); label(\\"F\\", F, SE); label(\\"G\\", G, NE); label(\\"H\\", H, SW); label(\\"O\\", O, N); [/asy] In triangle OEG and triangle OFH, by the Pythagorean theorem: [ OG^2 = OE^2 + EG^2 = (ssqrt{2})^2 ] Let the side length of EFGH be t.

Let ( a + 5b = 2n ), where ( n ) is an integer. 2. Then ( a = 2n - 5b ). 3. Thus, ( a - 3b = (2n - 5b) - 3b = 2n - 8b ). 4. Since ( 2n ) and ( 8b ) are even, their difference ( 2n - 8b ) is also even. Hence, statement (1) is true.  Statement (2): If ( a + b ) is divisible by 3, then both ( a ) and ( b ) are divisible by 3. 1. Let ( a + b = 3n ) for some integer ( n ). 2. This implies ( frac{a}{3} + frac{b}{3} = n ). 3. For ( n ) to be an integer, ( frac{a}{3} ) and ( frac{b}{3} ) must both be integers, meaning both ( a ) and ( b ) must be divisible by 3. Hence, statement (2) is true.  Statement (3): If ( a + b ) is a prime number, then ( a - b ) is not necessarily a prime number. 1. Consider ( a + b = 17 ) (a prime number). 2. Let ( a = 14 ) and ( b = 3 ), then ( a - b = 14 - 3 = 11 ) (also a prime number). 3. Since both ( a + b ) and ( a - b ) can be prime numbers, this counterexample disproves the statement.

We simplify the denominator: ( c = a + b to c^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ). Thus the denominator is: [  (a + c)(a^2 - a(a + b) + (a + b)^2) = (a + (a+b))(a^2 - a^2 - ab + a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = (a + c)(a^2 + ab + b^2). ] 3. Hence we obtain: [  frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^3 + c^3} = frac{(a - b)left(a^2 + ab + b^2right)}{(a + (a + b))(a^2 + ab + b^2)} = frac{a - b}{a + c}. ] Therefore, statement (4) is true. # Conclusion: Since statements (1), (2), and (4) are true:  boxed{(B) , 2 text{ 个}}"},{"instruction":"What is the sum of all the even integers between 200 and 400?","output":"We need to find the sum of the arithmetic series 202 + 204 + dots + 400.

This means there were ( 10 + 5 = 15 ) canoes rented out. The total revenue for the day was 405, which comes from the rental of both canoes and kayaks. The revenue from kayaks is easy to calculate since we know the cost per kayak per day is 18.

To find the ratio of the amount her mom sent her to the amount her dad sent her, we divide the amount from her mom by the amount from her dad: Ratio = M / Dad's amount Ratio = 50 / 25 Ratio = 2 / 1 So the ratio of the amount Cathy's mom sent her to the amount her dad sent her is boxed{2:1} ."},{"instruction":"Apple can run at a rate of 3 miles per hour.

The discount amount is 15% of 30: Discount = 15/100 * 30 Discount = 0.15 * 30 Discount = 4.50 Now, let's subtract the discount from the original price of the shoes to find out how much Emily paid for them: Price of shoes after discount = Original price - Discount Price of shoes after discount = 30 - 4.50 Price of shoes after discount = 25.50 Now we know that Emily spent 20 on art supplies and 25.50 on shoes. Let's add those amounts to see how much she spent on those items: Total spent on art supplies and shoes = 20 + 25.50 Total spent on art supplies and shoes = 45.50 Emily spent a total of 50, so let's subtract the amount she spent on art supplies and shoes from the total to find out how much she spent on the skirts: Total spent on skirts = Total spent - Total spent on art supplies and shoes Total spent on skirts = 50 - 45.50 Total spent on skirts = 4.50 Since Emily bought 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money, we'll divide the total spent on skirts by 2 to find the price of each skirt: Price of each skirt = Total spent on skirts / 2 Price of each skirt = 4.50 / 2 Price of each skirt = 2.25 Therefore, Emily paid boxed{2.25}  for each of the skirts."},{"instruction":"The health conditions of 50 students in Grade 7 (1) of a certain school are divided into 5 groups.

Since A and B are at the same distance from P on AB, we have that P is the midpoint of AB. Similarly, Q will be the midpoint of BC such that BP = BQ = frac{AB}{2}. 4.

This is a contradiction.    - Therefore, at least one of (p) or (q) must be 2 (the only even prime). 2. **Case 1: (p = 2)**:    - Substitute (p = 2) into the equation:      [      7 cdot 2 cdot q^2 + 2 = q^3 + 43 cdot 2^3 + 1      ]      Simplify the equation:      [      14q^2 + 2 = q^3 + 344 + 1      ]      [      14q^2 + 2 = q^3 + 345      ]      Rearrange the equation:      [      q^3 - 14q^2 = -343      ]      Factorize the equation:      [      q^2(q - 14) = 343      ]      Since (343 = 7^3), we can write:      [      q^2(14 - q) = 7^3      ]      The only integer solution for (q) is (q = 7). 3. **Case 2: (q = 2)**:    - Substitute (q = 2) into the equation:      [      7p cdot 2^2 + p = 2^3 + 43p^3 + 1      ]      Simplify the equation:      [      28p + p = 8 + 43p^3 + 1      ]      [      29p = 9 + 43p^3      ]      Rearrange the equation:      [      29p - 43p^3 = 9      ]      Factorize the equation:      [      p(29 - 43p^2) = 9      ]      Since (p) is a prime number, (p) must divide 9. The only prime factors of 9 are 3, but substituting (p = 3) does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case. Thus, the only solution is when (p = 2) and (q = 7).

Since each roll is independent, the probability of getting exactly three rolls odd can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:    [    P(X = k) = binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}    ]    where n = 8 (number of trials), k = 3 (desired number of successes), and p = frac{1}{2} (probability of success on each trial). Plugging in the values, we get: [ P(X = 3) = binom{8}{3} left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 left(frac{1}{2}right)^{8-3} = binom{8}{3} left(frac{1}{2}right)^8 ] Calculating the binomial coefficient binom{8}{3} = frac{8 times 7 times 6}{3 times 2 times 1} = 56, we find: [ P(X = 3) = 56 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^8 = 56 times frac{1}{256} = frac{56}{256} = frac{7}{32} ] The final probability that exactly three out of eight rolls are odd is boxed{frac{7}{32}}."},{"instruction":"Let x^2+bx+c = 0 be a quadratic whose roots are each three less than the roots of 2x^24x5.

The rate at which the cistern fills without the leak is ( frac{1}{T} ) (cistern per hour), and the rate at which it fills with the leak is ( frac{1}{T+2} ) (cistern per hour). The rate at which the cistern empties due to the leak is ( frac{1}{84} ) (cistern per hour), since it takes 84 hours to empty when full. Since the cistern still fills even with the leak, the filling rate without the leak minus the emptying rate due to the leak should equal the filling rate with the leak: [ frac{1}{T} - frac{1}{84} = frac{1}{T+2} ] To solve for ( T ), we can find a common denominator and equate the numerators: [ 84(T+2) - T(T+2) = 84T ] Expanding the terms: [ 84T + 168 - T^2 - 2T = 84T ] Simplify and bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation: [ -T^2 - 2T + 168 = 0 ] Divide by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive: [ T^2 + 2T - 168 = 0 ] Now, we can factor the quadratic equation: [ (T + 14)(T - 12) = 0 ] This gives us two possible solutions for ( T ): [ T + 14 = 0 quad text{or} quad T - 12 = 0 ] [ T = -14 quad text{or} quad T = 12 ] Since time cannot be negative, we discard ( T = -14 ) and accept ( T = 12 ).

At the start of the interval, when x = frac{π}{2}, the argument of the sine function is frac{π}{2}•omega+frac{π}{4}.

If a line through ( X ) and ( I ) intersects the circumcircle of ( triangle XYZ ) at point ( T ), then triangles ( ITY ) and ( ITZ ) are isosceles.    - **Proof:**      Consider the angles (angle YXZ = x) and (angle XYZ = y). The incenter ( I ) is the point where the angle bisectors intersect.            Since ( YI ) and ( XI ) are angle bisectors, and ( angle YIX ) is an external angle to ( triangle XIY ), we have:      [      angle YIT = angle YXI + angle XYI = frac{x}{2} + frac{y}{2}      ]      Similarly, the inscribed angles ( angle IYT ) and ( angle TXZ ) both subtend the same arc, so:      [      angle IYT = frac{y}{2} + frac{x}{2}      ]            Thus, ( angle YIT = angle IYT ), proving that ( triangle ITY ) is isosceles.

Consequently, ( AF ) goes through the incenter ( I ) of the triangle ( triangle ABC ).    - By the proven lemma, because ( angle FBA' = 45^{circ} ) (from earlier discussions), we have ( sigma ) touching the circumcircle at ( F ).    - We know harmonic properties for trapezoid ( FBA'F ) are ( sigma ) circles would be cyclic and harmonic.

The slope of the perpendicular bisector (the crease) is the negative reciprocal, -frac{4}{3}. The equation of the line through D with this slope is: [ y - 3 = -frac{4}{3}(x - 4) ] 5. **Intersection with AC**: Since AC is the hypotenuse and lies along the x-axis from (0,0) to (8,0), find where the crease intersects AC. Setting y = 0 in the equation of the crease gives: [ 0 - 3 = -frac{4}{3}(x - 4) Rightarrow -frac{4}{3}x + frac{16}{3} = -3 Rightarrow -4x + 16 = -9 Rightarrow 4x = 25 Rightarrow x = 6.25 ] The intersection point F on AC is (6.25, 0). 6. **Length of the Crease (DF)**: The length of the crease is the distance between D and F. Using the distance formula: [ DF = sqrt{(6.25 - 4)^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = sqrt{(2.25)^2 + (3)^2} = sqrt{5.0625 + 9} = sqrt{14.0625} ] Simplifying further: [ DF = frac{15}{4} ] Thus, the length of the crease is frac{15{4}}.

From the polynomial, the product of the roots (taking the constant term over to the right) can be expressed as -frac{2a}{7}. Equating these, we have -frac{2a}{7} = 243, leading to 2a = -1701 and a = -850.5. Additionally, by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the squares of the roots r^2 + s^2 + t^2 = (r+s+t)^2 - 2(rs+rt+st).

By construction, the perpendicular bisectors from the midpoints of sides (AC) and (BC) intersect at the midpoint of (AB). 3. Since these perpendicular bisectors have equal projections on the line perpendicular to (AB), but form different angles with the sides, these perpendiculars cannot be equal. 4. Suppose now (angle A leq angle B < angle C). 5. The perpendicular bisectors of sides (AB) and (AC) will intersect (AC) and (AB) respectively, creating similar yet not congruent triangles within triangle (ABC). 6. Hence, the perp bisectors of these segments inside the triangle should relate to corresponding sides of these similar triangles and thus cannot be equal.

Using the given information, we have the length of the minor axis, b=frac{sqrt{5}}{2}, and the eccentricity, e=frac{c}{a}=frac{2}{3}. We also know that the relationship between the semi-major axis (a), semi-minor axis (b), and the distance between the foci (c) is given by a^2=b^2+c^2.

Solution: Since the circle with its center at the origin and the minor axis of the ellipse C as its diameter is tangent to the line x - y + 2 = 0, we have frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = b, which gives b = sqrt{2}.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identify the mid-point O of DB:** - The coordinates of D and B are D(0, 0, 0) and B(4, 0, 0) respectively. - Therefore, the coordinates of mid-point O of DB are: [ O left( frac{0 + 4}{2}, frac{0 + 0}{2}, frac{0 + 0}{2} right) = (2, 0, 0). ] 2. **Use the perpendicularity condition overrightarrow{DP} cdot overrightarrow{PB} = 0:** - Let's express the coordinates of P as P(x, y, z). - The vectors overrightarrow{DP} and overrightarrow{PB} are: [ overrightarrow{DP} = (x - 0, y - 0, z - 0) = (x, y, z), quad overrightarrow{PB} = (4 - x, 0 - y, 0 - z). ] - The dot product condition overrightarrow{DP} cdot overrightarrow{PB} = 0 gives: [ x(4 - x) + y(-y) + z(-z) = 0 implies 4x - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 0. ] 3. **Simplify the geometric conditions:** - Note that O is the center of the sphere where P lies.

Base Case ( n = 1 ): For the (3 times 3) board (i.e., (2 times 1 + 1 )), the possible positions of black cells ( A ) and ( B ) are either adjacent or in opposite corners. These positions allow movement along a well-defined path. Here's how this works out for the two possible placements: 1.

The number of ways to choose 3 out of 11 is: [ C_{11}^{3} = binom{11}{3} ] The value of the combination is computed as: [ C_{11}^{3} = frac{11!}{3!(11-3)!} = frac{11!}{3! cdot 8!} = frac{11 times 10 times 9}{3 times 2 times 1} = 165 ] 4.

We have: [ frac{a_1^2}{a_k - a_1} in S ] Since ( frac{a_1^2}{a_k - a_1} ) must be a positive integer and an element of ( S ), it must be at least ( a_1 ).

Now consider the second largest element ( a_{k-1} ) and the largest element ( a_k ). We have: [ frac{a_{k-1}^2}{a_k - a_{k-1}} in S ] Since ( frac{a_{k-1}^2}{a_k - a_{k-1}} ) must be greater than ( a_{k-1} ), we have: [ frac{a_{k-1}^2}{a_k - a_{k-1}} > a_{k-1} ] Simplifying this inequality: [ frac{a_{k-1}^2}{a_k - a_{k-1}} > a_{k-1} implies a_{k-1}^2 > a_{k-1}(a_k - a_{k-1}) implies a_{k-1}^2 > a_{k-1} a_k - a_{k-1}^2 implies 2a_{k-1}^2 > a_{k-1} a_k implies a_k < 2a_{k-1} ] 4. Suppose ( frac{a_{k-1}^2}{a_k - a_{k-1}} = a_k ). Then: [ a_{k-1}^2 = a_k(a_k - a_{k-1}) implies a_k^2 - a_k a_{k-1} - a_{k-1}^2 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation for ( frac{a_k}{a_{k-1}} ): [ left( frac{a_k}{a_{k-1}} right)^2 - left( frac{a_k}{a_{k-1}} right) - 1 = 0 ] The positive solution to this equation is: [ frac{a_k}{a_{k-1}} = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] which is an irrational number. Therefore, ( a_k ) and ( a_{k-1} ) cannot both be integers, contradicting the assumption that ( S ) has more than two elements. 5. Therefore, ( S ) must have exactly two elements. Let ( S = {a_1, a_2} ) with ( a_1 < a_2 ). We need: [ frac{a_1^2}{a_2 - a_1} in S ] Since ( frac{a_1^2}{a_2 - a_1} ) must be an element of ( S ), it must be either ( a_1 ) or ( a_2 ). If: [ frac{a_1^2}{a_2 - a_1} = a_1 implies a_1^2 = a_1(a_2 - a_1) implies a_1 = a_2 - a_1 implies a_2 = 2a_1 ] 6.

The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by S_n = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d). Using a_1 = 1, the formula becomes: S_n = frac{1}{2}n(2 + (n-1)d). Now, we need to set up the equation based on the given harmonic series property: frac {S_n}{S_{2n}} = k, which implies frac{frac{1}{2}n(2 + (n-1)d)}{frac{1}{2}(2n)(2 + (2n-1)d)} = k. Simplifying, we get frac{2 + (n-1)d}{4 + 2(2n-1)d} = k. Cross-multiplying, we have 2 + (n-1)d = 4k + 2k(2n-1)d. From this equation, we know it must hold true for any positive integer n, which leads to a system of equations: begin{cases} (4k-1)d = 0, (2k-1)(2-d) = 0. end{cases} Solving this system, we find that begin{cases} d = 0 text{ or } k = frac{1}{4}, d = 2 text{ or } k = frac{1}{2}. end{cases} Since we know d neq 0, we discard the d=0 solution, and we are left with: begin{cases} k = frac{1}{4}, d = 2. end{cases} Therefore, the common difference d of the arithmetic sequence is d=2. boxed{d = 2}"},{"instruction":"Frank has an unfair eightsided die.

We prove that with ( k geq 2n ), such a cycle is inevitable. 3. **Proof by Induction on ( m + n ):** We generalize the statement and prove by induction for an ( m times n ) rectangle with k geq m + n colors. - **Base case:** When ( m = 1 ), it's trivial since there cannot be more than ( n ) different colors. - **Induction step:** Assume it's true for all ( r times s ) rectangles where ( r + s < m + n ). 4. **Completing Induction:** Given a vertical column ( V ) and identifying a unique color specific to that column, if any column or row has at most one unique color, remove it and apply the induction hypothesis. If each row and column has at least two unique colors: a. Select a row ( H_1 ) and a different column ( V_2 ) with at least two unique colors. b. This forced dispersion across colors ensures there will be a requisite quartet of cells.

First, we analyze statement p: A function y=a^x is monotonically decreasing if 0 < a < 1, because if a>1, the function is monotonically increasing. Therefore, p is true if 0 < a < 1 and false if a > 1. Now, we consider statement q: The function y=log(ax^2 - x + a) will have a range of mathbb{R} if and only if for every value y in mathbb{R}, there exists a corresponding x such that the argument of the logarithm ax^2 - x + a is positive. This means the quadratic ax^2 - x + a must be greater than 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. Since it is a parabola opening upwards (as a is positive), it will be greater than 0 for all x if it has no real roots. The discriminant of the quadratic is Delta=b^2-4ac=(-1)^2-4(a)(a)=1-4a^2, and for the parabola to have no real roots, we require Delta < 0, which gives us 1-4a^2 < 0 or a^2 > frac{1}{4}. Taking the square root, considering that a is positive, we get a > frac{1}{2}. The conditions for q to be true are thus that a >frac{1}{2}. Conversely, q is false if 0 < a leq frac{1}{2}. Since \\"p and q\\" is false, we examine the situations where one or both of them are false: - **Case 1 (p is true, q is false):** 0 < a < 1 and 0 < a leq frac{1}{2}.

Let's re-evaluate the third step. 3. When 3x is divided by 5, the quotient is z and the remainder is 2. 3x = 5z + 2 Substituting the value of x from the first equation, we get: 3(10y + 3) = 5z + 2 Using y = 5, we get: 3(10*5 + 3) = 5z + 2 3(50 + 3) = 5z + 2 3(53) = 5z + 2 159 = 5z + 2 Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: 157 = 5z Dividing both sides by 5, we get: z = 157 / 5 z = 31 with a remainder of 2 (which is consistent with the original problem statement).

Consider that there are 36 playing cards in the deck, with 4 different suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) and 9 different ranks (6 through Ace). 2. Volodya draws a card first. The probability of Volodya drawing any specific card is (frac{1}{36}). 3. Masha then draws a card from the remaining 35 cards. The probability of Masha drawing any specific card given Volodya's draw is (frac{1}{35}). 4. Masha wins if she draws a card with a higher rank than Volodya’s card. Masha loses if: - The rank of her card is the same as Volodya’s card (4 cards in total of each rank). - The rank of her card is lower than Volodya’s card. 5. If Volodya draws a card of rank (r), there is a ( frac{4}{35} ) chance that Masha will draw a card of the same rank (r). If there are (x) cards above rank (r), then there are (9 - (x + 1)) cards of rank lower than (r). 6.

For Volodya to draw, the expected value of a fair draw means Volodya wins when the ranks match or Masha's card is of a lower rank. The exact probability calculation involves summing the probabilities of each match, weighted by the number of options. 8. The conclusion is derived from understanding: - Volodya wins not only when his card rank is higher but also when it is equal. - This gives Volodya additional winning scenarios compared to Masha. Therefore, the draw is biased towards Volodya. Masha has fewer scenarios to win. [ boxed{text{Unfair}} ] **Part (b):** To make the draw fair, we can: 1.

Plugging the given values into the formula: |overrightarrow{a}+overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 2^2 + 2times4 + 4^2 = 4 + 8 + 16 = 28. 4.

Prove that the polynomial P(x) = a_{n} x^{n} + a_{n1} x^{n1} + cdots + a_{1} x + a_{0} is irreducible, i.e., it cannot be factored into the product of two polynomials with integer coefficients, both having positive degrees. (6th Balearic Mathematics Competition, 1989)","output":": 1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: We are given ( a_n a_{n-1} cdots a_1 a_0 = 10^n a_n + 10^{n-1} a_{n-1} + cdots + 10 a_1 + a_0 ) as the decimal representation of a prime number, with ( n > 1 ) and ( a_n > 1 ). We need to show that the polynomial: [ P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ] is irreducible, meaning it cannot be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. 2. **Stating the Lemma**: First, we prove a lemma: *Lemma*: If ( a_0, a_1, cdots, a_n in {0, 1, 2, cdots, 9}, n geqslant 1, a_n geqslant 1 ), the polynomial: [ P(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i ] has roots for which the real parts are less than 4. 3. **Proof of Lemma (Contradiction Method)**: Assume there exists a complex number ( z ) such that ( operatorname{Re}(z) geqslant 4 ). Then we have: [ |z| geqslant 4, quad operatorname{Re}left(frac{1}{z}right) geqslant 0. ] We can analyze ( left|frac{P(z)}{z^n}right| ): [ begin{aligned} left|frac{P(z)}{z^n}right| & geqslant left|a_n + frac{a_{n-1}}{z}right| - frac{a_{n-2}}{|z|^2} - frac{a_{n-3}}{|z|^3} - cdots - frac{a_0}{|z|^n} & > operatorname{Re}left(a_n + frac{a_{n-1}}{z}right) - frac{9}{|z|^2} - frac{9}{|z|^3} - cdots - frac{9}{|z|^n} & geqslant a_n - frac{9}{|z|^2 - |z|} & geqslant 1 - frac{9}{|z|^2} & geqslant 1 - frac{9}{16} & = 1 - frac{9}{16} & = frac{7}{16} > 0. end{aligned} ] Since ( left|frac{P(z)}{z^n}right| > 0 ), ( z ) cannot be a root of ( P(x) = 0 ). Thus, the real part of any root must be smaller than 4. The lemma is verified. 4. **Returning to the Main Problem**: Supposing that ( P(x) = g(x) cdot h(x) ), where ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) are polynomials with positive degrees and integer coefficients, denote ( alpha_1, alpha_2, cdots, alpha_k ) as the roots of ( g(x) ). From the lemma, we know: [ operatorname{Re}(alpha_j) < 4, quad 1 leqslant j leqslant k. ] 5. **Considering ( g(4) ) and ( h(4) )**: We have: [ begin{aligned} g(4) & neq 0, |g(4)| & geqslant 1. end{aligned} ] Similarly: [ |h(4)| geqslant 1. ] 6. **Analyzing ( g(10) ) and ( h(10) )**: Further, due to the nature of the real parts of roots: [ left|10 - alpha_jright| > left|4 - alpha_jright|, quad 1 leqslant j leqslant k. ] Thus: [ |g(10)| > |g(4)| geqslant 1, ] and similarly: [ |h(10)| > |h(4)| geqslant 1. ] 7. **Conclusion**: Since ( P(10) ) is a prime number, it contradicts the decomposition into two integers each greater than 1.

Identify the right focus F_{1} of the ellipse E. Given the equation of the ellipse, we know that the center is at the origin (0,0), and the major axis length is 2a = 8, which means a = 4. Since the ellipse is centered at the origin and stretched along the x-axis, the foci are located at (pm c, 0), where c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. For this ellipse, c = sqrt{16 - 7} = sqrt{9} = 3. Therefore, F_{1} is at (3,0). 2. From the definition of an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point P on the ellipse to the foci F and F_{1} is constant and equal to 2a = 8. Therefore, we have |PF| + |PF_{1}| = 8. 3. We can express |PF| in terms of |PF_{1}| as |PF| = 8 - |PF_{1}|. 4. The distance |PM| from point P to point M on the circle can be combined with |PF| to find the expression for |PF| + |PM|. We know that |PF| + |PM| geq |PF| + |PC| - 1 because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and |PC| - 1 accounts for the radius of the circle C. 5.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from each type of clothing item without any discounts: - Total revenue from shirts: 20 shirts * 10/shirt = 200. - Total revenue from jeans: 10 pairs of jeans * 20/pair = 200. - Total revenue from jackets without discount: 15 jackets * 60/jacket = 900. Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the jackets: - Discount per jacket: 10% of 60 = 0.10 * 60 = 6. - Discounted price of a jacket: 60 - 6 = 54. - Total revenue from jackets with discount: 15 jackets * 54/jacket = 810. Finally, let's calculate the total revenue from all items: - Total revenue = Revenue from shirts + Revenue from jeans + Revenue from jackets with discount - Total revenue = 200 + 200 + 810 - Total revenue = 1210 So, the store will generate boxed{1210} in revenue from selling all the items, considering the discount on jackets."},{"instruction":"A store reported total sales of 460 million for February of this year.

Consider the triangle ( triangle ABD ). Using the triangle inequality theorem, we have the conditions: [ AD - AB < BD < AD + AB ] Substituting the given lengths, we get: [ 7 - 1 < BD < 7 + 1 ] [ 6 < BD < 8 ] Hence, the only possible integer value for ( BD ) in this range is: [ BD = 7 ] 5.

The vertex occurs at x = 5, which means the maximum profit is achieved when the selling price is increased by 5 yuan. The maximum profit is 6250 yuan. Therefore, to maximize profit for the product, the selling price should be increased by boxed{5} yuan."},{"instruction":"Find the minimum value of w if w = 2x^2 + 3y^2 12x + 9y + 35.","output":"Complete the square for both x and y terms: 1. Start with the x terms: 2x^2 - 12x can be written as 2(x^2 - 6x). To complete the square, add and subtract 9 inside the bracket: 2[(x - 3)^2 - 9] = 2(x-3)^2 - 18. 2. For the y terms: 3y^2 + 9y. Here, completing the square involves adding and subtracting left(frac{9}{6}right)^2 = frac{9}{4} within the bracket: 3[(y + frac{3}{2})^2 - frac{9}{4}] = 3(y+frac{3}{2})^2 - frac{27}{4}. 3. Substitute back to simplify w: w = 2(x-3)^2 - 18 + 3(y+frac{3}{2})^2 - frac{27}{4} + 35 Simplify the constants: -18 + 35 - frac{27}{4} = 17 - frac{27}{4} = frac{68}{4} - frac{27}{4} = frac{41}{4} Thus, w = 2(x-3)^2 + 3(y+frac{3}{2})^2 + frac{41}{4} Here, since the term 2(x-3)^2 is nonnegative and 3(y+frac{3}{2})^2 is nonnegative, their minimum values occur at 0. Therefore, w_{text{min}} = 0 + 0 + frac{41}{4} = boxed{frac{41}{4}}"},{"instruction":"Let ( a, b in {2, 3, cdots, 8} ). What is the maximum value of ( frac{a}{10b+a} + frac{b}{10a+b} )?","output":"Given the problem: [ frac{a}{10b + a} + frac{b}{10a + b} ] where ( a, b in {2, 3, cdots, 8} ). Let's find the maximum value of this expression. We will systematically evaluate this for different values within the specified range. 1. Consider the expression: [ frac{a}{10b + a} + frac{b}{10a + b}. ] 2. Test different values for (a) and (b) within ({2, 3, cdots, 8}): Trying with (a = 2): - For (b = 2): [ frac{2}{10 cdot 2 + 2} + frac{2}{10 cdot 2 + 2} = frac{2}{20 + 2} + frac{2}{20 + 2} = frac{2}{22} + frac{2}{22} = frac{4}{22} = frac{2}{11}. ] - For (b = 3): [ frac{2}{10 cdot 3 + 2} + frac{3}{10 cdot 2 + 3} = frac{2}{30+2} + frac{3}{20 + 3} = frac{2}{32} + frac{3}{23}. ] - Calculate and compare the above values. 3. Similar evaluations are done for (a = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8); it's critical to find the pair that gives the highest value for the expression. 4. Identify the maximum value from the computations carried out in step 2 when trying all combinations. Through systematic calculation and simplification, the maximum observed value of the expression ( frac{a}{10b + a} + frac{b}{10a + b} ) for ( a, b in {2, 3, cdots, 8} ) turns out to be ( frac{1}{4} ). # Conclusion Thus, the maximum value of ( frac{a}{10b + a} + frac{b}{10a + b} ) is: [ boxed{frac{1}{4}} ]"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],R={key:0},L={key:1};function I(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
