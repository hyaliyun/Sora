[     int_{0}^{1}(ax^2 + bx + c) , dx     ]     We compute this integral as follows:     [     int_{0}^{1}(ax^2 + bx + c) , dx = left. left( frac{a x^3}{3} + frac{b x^2}{2} + cx right) right|_{0}^{1}     ] 2. **Calculate the definite integral**:     Substituting the limits 0 and 1, we get:     [     left( frac{a (1)^3}{3} + frac{b (1)^2}{2} + c(1) right) - left( frac{a (0)^3}{3} + frac{b (0)^2}{2} + c(0) right)     ]     [     = frac{a}{3} + frac{b}{2} + c     ] 3. **Substitute the given condition**:     By substituting ( 2a + 3b + 6c = 0 ), we simplify:     [     frac{a}{3} + frac{b}{2} + c = frac{2a + 3b + 6c}{6} = frac{0}{6} = 0     ] 4. **Interpret the result**:     Since the integral of ( ax^2 + bx + c ) from 0 to 1 equals 0, (int_{0}^{1}(ax^2 + bx + c) dx = 0), it implies that the quadratic function ( ax^2 + bx + c ) changes signs in the interval ([0,1]).      - A continuous function that has zero integral over an interval must change signs.

Assume angle BPC = 90^circ. We will show AE + AP = PD. 3. Construct the line through P that intersects circle (O) at Q and BC at Q or extends infinitely to meet Q. 4. We know Q and D are harmonic conjugates with respect to segment CB. 5. Because angle BPC = 90^circ, we infer that PC bisects angle QPD. 6. Therefore, in triangle PCD, we have angle CDP = 2angle CPD. 7. Let AP = m, PD = n, AE = x, and EC = v. Thus, CD = v. 8. For triangle PCD, consider its circumcircle. Using the Angle Bisector Theorem, we apply the secant-tangent formula:          PC^2 = CD^2 + CD cdot PD      9. This simplifies to:          PC^2 = v^2 + v cdot n      10.

Simplifying the equation, we obtain m + n = 2x, which further simplifies to m + n = 2sqrt{m(m+n)}. 15. Solving for n, we find n = 3m, and thus x = 2m. Since x + m = n, we again confirm x + m = 3m = n. 16. Therefore, we conclude AE + AP = PD holds when angle BPC = 90^circ. # Necessity: 17. Now assume AE + AP = PD and prove angle BPC = 90^circ. 18.

Substitute into the existing Stewart and Power of a Point equations:          PC^2 = v^2 cdot frac{m}{m+n} + (x+v)^2 cdot frac{n}{m+n} - mn      22.

Then, ( p(alpha) = 0 ).      - Given ( p(x^2) = p(x)p(x-1) ), substituting ( x = alpha ) yields     [     p(alpha^2) = p(alpha)p(alpha-1) = 0.     ]     - Therefore, ( alpha^2 ) must also be a root of ( p(x) ). 2. **Constraint on the Magnitude of ( alpha )**:     - Assume there is a root ( alpha ) such that ( |alpha| > 1 ).     - Let ( beta ) be the root with the largest magnitude ( |beta| ).     - By the earlier argument, ( beta^2 ) is also a root, and since ( |beta^2| = |beta|^2 ), we have     [     |beta^2| > |beta|,     ]     - This contradicts ( beta ) having the largest magnitude.

Prove that on this art object it is possible to erase all lines of some one color so that from any marked point it is still possible to get to any other by moving along the remaining lines.","output":"To solve this problem, we shall leverage the principles of graph theory. We can model our problem using a complete graph (K_{50}), where: - The (50) points are the vertices. - Each pair of vertices is connected by an edge colored in one of three colors. Our goal is to prove that it is possible to erase all edges of one particular color such that the remaining graph is still connected. Here is the step-by-step formal proof: 1. **Graph Representation:**     1.1. Consider the graph (K_{50}) where each of the 50 points represents a vertex.     1.2. Each pair of vertices is connected by an edge, and each edge is colored with one of three colors: let’s denote these colors by (C_1), (C_2), and (C_3). 2. **Assumption and Goal:**     2.1. We need to show that after removing all edges of one color, the resulting subgraph remains connected.     2.2. Assume by contradiction that it's impossible to remove all edges of a single color while preserving connectivity. 3. **System of Colors:**     3.1. Let's define the colors (C_1), (C_2), and (C_3).     3.2. Suppose we remove all edges of color (C_1). If the resulting graph is not connected, the vertices must have split into at least two disjoint sets, where no edges of colors (C_2) or (C_3) connect vertices from these different sets. 4. **Contradiction and Connectivity:**     4.1. For the graph to not be connected after removing all edges of color (C_1), there must exist at least two non-empty sets of vertices (V_1) and (V_2) such that:         - All edges between vertices in (V_1) and vertices in (V_2) are of color (C_1).         - Hence, removing edges of color (C_1) would disconnect (V_1) and (V_2).     4.2. Since every vertex is connected by an edge to every other vertex (complete graph), and colors are chosen arbitrarily, such sets (V_1) and (V_2) cannot exist without violating the initial condition of having every edge colored by one of (C_1), (C_2), or (C_3). 5. **Revising Assumptions:**     5.1. Since we assumed by contradiction that removing edges of one color results in disconnection and deduced that such sets (V_1) and (V_2) would contradict our complete graph properties, our assumption must be incorrect.     5.2. Therefore, removing all edges of a single color must leave the graph connected. 6. **Conclusion:**     By verifying our graph structure and the way edges and vertex connectivity behave under color constraints, we confirm that if one set of colored edges is removed, the remaining colored edges still uphold the connectivity of the complete graph (K_{50}). Hence, we've proven that it is possible to erase all lines of some one color while preserving the connectivity of the graph. This result aligns with the principles of a complete graph and multi-colored complete edge coloring.

Thus, we can express the other normalized edges as: [ w_2 = a_2 omega, quad w_3 = a_3 omega^2, quad w_4 = a_4 omega^3, quad w_5 = a_5 omega^4 ] where ( a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ) are rational numbers. Substituting these into the sum, we obtain: [ 1 + a_2 omega + a_3 omega^2 + a_4 omega^3 + a_5 omega^4 = 0 ] Notice that ( omega ) satisfies the minimal polynomial over the rationals: [ 1 + omega + omega^2 + omega^3 + omega^4 = 0 ] Comparing this with our expression, we realize that for the coefficients of ( omega ) to match, we must have: [ a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_5 = 1 ] Thus: [ w_2 = omega, quad w_3 = omega^2, quad w_4 = omega^3, quad w_5 = omega^4 ] Given that (| w_i | = 1), it follows that (| z_i | = |z_1 |) for (i = 2, 3, 4, 5).

The domain of definition (ODZ) must ensure that the trigonometric functions involved are defined and non-zero.  Thus, (sin x neq 0) and (cos x neq 0).  Step 2: Use trigonometric identities. Recall the trigonometric identities: [ sin x = 2 sin frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2}, ] [ tan frac{alpha}{2} = frac{1 - cos alpha}{sin alpha}, ] [ cot frac{alpha}{2} = frac{1 + cos alpha}{sin alpha}. ]  Step 3: Rewrite the original equation. Using the identity (sin x = 2 sin frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2}): [ sin x = 2 sin frac{x}{2} cos frac{x}{2}, ] [ sin^3 x = 8 sin^3 frac{x}{2} cos^3 frac{x}{2}, ] we rewrite the first term of the equation: [ frac{1}{sin^3 x} = frac{1}{8 sin^3 frac{x}{2} cos^3 frac{x}{2}}. ] Also, rewrite (cos^{-1} x equiv frac{1}{cos x}): [ -6 cos^{-1} x = -frac{6}{cos x}. ] Now rewriting the right side using the identities for tangent and cotangent: [ tan^3 frac{x}{2} = left(frac{1 - cos x}{sin x}right)^3, ] [ cot^3 frac{x}{2} = left(frac{1 + cos x}{sin x}right)^3. ] Thus the equation becomes: [ frac{8}{sin^3 x} - frac{6}{cos x} = frac{(1 - cos x)^3}{sin^3 x} + frac{(1 + cos x)^3}{sin^3 x}. ]  Step 4: Simplify the equation. Multiplying through by ( sin^3 x ): [ frac{8}{sin^3 x} cdot sin^3 x - frac{6}{cos x} cdot sin^3 x = frac{(1 - cos x)^3}{sin^3 x} cdot sin^3 x + frac{(1 + cos x)^3}{sin^3 x} cdot sin^3 x, ] we get: [ 8 - 6 frac{sin^3 x}{cos x} = (1 - cos x)^3 + (1 + cos x)^3. ]  Step 5: Expand and simplify the terms. Expanding the cubic terms using the Binomial Theorem: [ (1 - cos x)^3 + (1 + cos x)^3 = 1 - 3 cos x + 3 cos^2 x - cos^3 x + 1 + 3 cos x + 3 cos^2 x + cos^3 x, ] [ = 2 + 6 cos^2 x. ] The equation simplifies to: [ 8 - 6 frac{sin^3 x}{cos x} = 2 + 6 cos^2 x. ]  Step 6: Rearrange terms. [ 8 - 2 = 6 cos^2 x + 6 frac{sin^3 x}{cos x}, ] [ cos x - cos x sin^2 x = 0, ] [ sin^3 x - cos x sin^2 x = 0, ] which becomes: [ sin^2 x (sin x - cos x) = 0. ]  Step 7: Solve the simplified equation. Given (sin x ne 0), we must have: [ sin x - cos x = 0, ] [ sin x = cos x, ] [ tan x = 1, ]  Step 8: Find the general solutions. The general solution for (tan x = 1) is: [ x = frac{pi}{4} + kpi, quad k in mathbb{Z}. ] Therefore, the solution to the equation is: [ boxed{x = frac{pi}{4} + kpi, quad k in mathbb{Z}}. ]"},{"instruction":"All the cells of a (100 times 100) square table are numbered in some order from 1 to 10000.

What is the smallest (k) such that, regardless of the initial numbering, Petya will be able to color all the cells of the table in several steps? (S. Berlov)","output":"1. We first need to prove the following lemma:    **Lemma:** For any two cells A and B, there exists a cell C such that if C is colored, A and B can subsequently be colored (possibly C coincides with A or B).    **Proof:** Suppose the cell numbers of A and B are a and b respectively, with a < b. Let D be the cell in the same column as A and in the same row as B, and let d be its number (it is possible that D = A or D = B). We consider three cases:    - If d < a, then after coloring A, we can color D and then B.    - If a leq d leq b, then after coloring D, we can color both A and B.    - If d > b, then after coloring B, we can color D and then A.    In any of these cases, by coloring one of A, B, or D first, we ensure that both A and B will be colored. Therefore, the lemma is proved. 2. We move on to solving the main problem. Clearly, k geq 1. We need to demonstrate that with k = 1, it is always possible to color all the cells. 3. Consider an arbitrary numbering of the cells. Let us examine all possible ways of coloring the cells according to the rules with k = 1. Among these ways, choose the one where the number of colored cells is maximal. Let A be the first cell colored in this way. 4. Suppose there exists an uncolored cell B in this scenario. By the lemma, we can choose another cell C and start the coloring process from C instead of A. By doing so, we will be able to color cells B, A, and all the cells that would have been colored in the originally chosen way. This means we can color at least one more cell, which is a contradiction to our choice of the initial coloring method being maximal. 5. Hence, in the optimal coloring approach, all cells will be colored, showing that k = 1 is sufficient.

It is given that (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 100). 2. **Key Condition**:    Each mathematician can redistribute their catch such that the remaining five have an equal number of fish. This implies the total fish caught by the remaining five must be divisible by 5. 3. **Redistribution Insight**:    Suppose mathematician (i) redistributes their fish to the remaining 5. For the remaining five fishermen to have an equal number of fish, the total fish left must be divisible by 5. If (a_i = k), the remaining sum (100 - k) must be divisible by 5. Thus, ((100 - k) equiv 0 (text{mod } 5)). 4. **Setting Up the Equations**:    Set (100 - k = 5m) where (m) is an integer. This simplifies to:    [    k = 100 - 5m    ]     Since (k) must also be one of (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6), it has to be within the range from (a_1) to (a_6). 5. **Range Analysis**:    The maximum (k) can be is (20) because if any mathematician caught more than 20 fish, it wouldn't be possible for the remaining five to divide the fish equally among themselves (as (100 - text{more than 20}) wouldn't be a multiple of 5). 6. **Substitution**:    Let's assume there isn't any mathematician with precisely 20 fish. The sequence of different amounts of fish caught, (a_i)'s, are non-repeating integers. The highest number (a_6) is at most 19, and correspondingly the smallest number (a_1) will be:    [    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 leq 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21    ]    (This is clearly not satisfying our sum of 100.) 7. **Existence Proof by Contradiction**:    Thus, if no one caught exactly 20 fish, we sum the six largest possible distinct values less than 20 and we get:    [    14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 = 99    ]    This shows a contradiction as the conditions of the problem state the total must be 100 fish. 8. **Conclusion**:    Since all other configurations lead to contradictions, there must exist at least one mathematician who caught exactly 20 fish. Hence, Ivan must have caught exactly 20 fish. If Ivan leaves with his catch, the remaining five fishermen have collectively caught 80 fish.

Step 1: Rearrange the Equation First, let's rearrange and modify the given equation to make it more tractable. We start by moving terms involving ( x ) and ( y ) to one side: [ xy - px - py = 0 ] Next, add ( p^2 ) to both sides: [ xy - px - py + p^2 = p^2 ]  Step 2: Factor the Equation We observe that the left-hand side can be factored to: [ (x - p)(y - p) = p^2 ]  Step 3: Analyze the Factor Pairs Notice that the product of two integer terms, ( (x - p) ) and ( (y - p) ), equals ( p^2 ). The prime number ( p ) squared produces specific factor pairs: 1. ( (x - p) = p ) and ( (y - p) = p ) 2. ( (x - p) = -p ) and ( (y - p) = -p ) 3. ( (x - p) = 1 ) and ( (y - p) = p^2 ) 4.

( (x - p) = -p^2 ) and ( (y - p) = -1 )  Step 4: Solve for ( x ) and ( y ) For each of these cases, solving for ( x ) and ( y ) yields: 1. ( x - p = p ) and ( y - p = p )    [ x = 2p ]    [ y = 2p ]    Hence, ((x, y) = (2p, 2p)). 2. ( x - p = -p ) and ( y - p = -p )    [ x = 0 ]    [ y = 0 ]    Hence, ((x, y) = (0, 0)). 3. ( x - p = 1 ) and ( y - p = p^2 )    [ x = p + 1 ]    [ y = p + p^2 ]    Hence, ((x, y) = (p + 1, p + p^2)). 4. ( x - p = -1 ) and ( y - p = -p^2 )    [ x = p - 1 ]    [ y = p - p^2 ]    Hence, ((x, y) = (p - 1, p - p^2)). 5. ( x - p = p^2 ) and ( y - p = 1 )    [ x = p + p^2 ]    [ y = p + 1 ]    Hence, ((x, y) = (p + p^2, p + 1)). 6.

We need to show that every edge of ( G ) is part of a cycle. # I: 1. **Choosing an arbitrary edge**:     Let's consider an arbitrary edge ( p_0q_0 ) in ( G ). This edge connects vertices ( p_0 ) and ( q_0 ). 2. **Extending to a maximal path**:     Extend this edge into a path ( U ) such that ( U ) is maximal and cannot be extended any further. Assume:     [     U = p_n p_{n-1} ldots p_1 p_0 q_0 q_1 ldots q_{m-1} q_m     ]     Here, ( U ) is a path starting from ( p_n ) to ( q_m ). 3. **Checking if the path forms a cycle**:     If ( p_n ) and ( q_m ) are connected by an edge, then ( U ) forms a cycle using the edge ( p_nq_m ), which includes the initial edge ( p_0q_0 ). Therefore, we have a cycle in this case. 4. **Degree assumptions and contradictions**:     Consider the complexity that ( U ) cannot consist only of ( p_0q_0 ), since in such a case, both ( p_0 ) and ( q_0 ) would have a degree of 1, contradicting the given condition that each vertex has a degree of at least ( k / 2 ).      Hence, ( p_n ) and ( q_m ) are not directly connected by an edge. However, at least one of them must be connected to a vertex within ( p_{n-1}, ldots, p_1, p_0, q_0, q_1, ldots, q_{m-1} ). 5. **Connectivity argument**:     Since the degrees ( p_n ) and ( q_m ) are at least ( k / 2 ), ( p_n ) and ( q_m ) must be connected to vertices among ( p_{n-1}, ldots, p_1, p_0, q_0, q_1, ldots, q_{m-1} ). This ensures that there exists a vertex ( y ) such that both ( p_n ) and ( q_m ) connect to ( y ), forming cycles including the path ( U ). 6. **Conclusion**:     Thus, the initial edge ( p_0q_0 ) is indeed part of a cycle, as required. # II: 1. **Graph components consideration**:     Since any graph can be decomposed into connected components, we only need to show the result for connected graphs. Hence, assume ( G ) is connected. 2. **Indirect proof**:     Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, there exists an edge ( a_1a_2 ) which is not part of any cycle in ( G ). 3. **Disconnecting the graph**:     Remove the edge ( a_1a_2 ) from ( G ), obtaining a graph ( G' ). Note that ( G' ) cannot be connected because (if it were, adding back ( a_1a_2 ) would form a cycle with ( a_1a_2 )). 4. **Component analysis after edge removal**:     Hence, ( G' ) consists of two disjoint connected components, ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ), which contain ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ), respectively.  5. **Existence of long paths**:     Let ( n ) be the upper integer part of ( k / 2 ). In ( A_i ):     - For ( A_1 ), an ( n )-long path starts at ( a_1 ).     - Similarly, for ( A_2 ), an ( n )-long path starts at ( a_2 ).         This is achievable considering each vertex's degree constraints. 6. **Combining paths**:     If in ( A_1 ) the path is ( U_1 ) of length ( n ) from ( a_1 ), and in ( A_2 ) the path ( U_2 ) of length ( n ) ends at ( y ), then combining them by ( U_1 a_1 a_2 U_2 ) gives a path of length:     [     2n + 1 geq 2 cdot (k / 2) + 1 = k + 1     ]     This is a contradiction because it exceeds the maximum path length constraint of ( k ). 7. **Conclusion**:     This contradiction implies that every edge in ( G ) must indeed be part of a cycle.

Consider numbers of the form ( k^m(k^i + j) ) for ( i in {1, ldots, n-k+1} ), ( j in {1, ldots, k-1} ), and ( m geq 0 ). Note that for such ( i ) and ( j ) in these intervals, we have ( i + j leq n ). 2. Based on whether ( n - (i + j) ) is an odd number or an even number, we have two cases:    - **Case 1:** If ( n - (i + j) ) is odd, there is some integer ( t geq 0 ) such that       [      n - (i + j) = 2t + 1.      ]      In this case, the number ( k^i + j ) can be represented using ( n ) number of ( k )'s as      [      k^i + j = underbrace{left( k times cdots times k right)}_{i+t} div underbrace{(k times cdots times k)}_{t} + underbrace{(k + cdots + k)}_j div k.      ]    - **Case 2:** If ( n - (i + j) ) is even, there is some integer ( t geq 0 ) such that       [      n - (i + j) = 2t.      ]      In this case, the number ( k(k^i + j) ) can be shown using ( n ) number of ( k )'s as      [      k(k^i + j) = k times left( underbrace{left( k times cdots times k right)}_{i+t-1} div underbrace{(k times cdots times k)}_{t-1} + underbrace{(k + cdots + k)}_j div k right).      ]      (In case when ( t = 0 ), we have ( t-1 = -1 ), so in the above equation, instead of multiplying the parentheses to ( -1 ) ( k )'s, we divide it by one ( k ).) 3. So in both cases, there is ( m geq 0 ) such that ( k^m(k^i + j) ) can be represented using ( n ) number of ( k )'s. Set ( m ) to be the largest number such that ( k^m(k^i + j) ) can be represented using only ( n ) number of ( k )'s (for fixed ( i ) and ( j )). There are a total of ( (n-k+1)(k-1) ) numbers created with given properties. 4. We prove that they are all distinct numbers and also cannot be represented using ( n-1 ) number of ( k )'s. If some number ( u = k^m(k^i + j) ) can be shown using ( n-1 ) number of ( k )'s, then clearly ( k times u = k^{m+1}(k^i + j) ) has a representation, using ( n ) number of ( k )'s, therefore ( m ) cannot be the largest number such that ( k^m(k^i + j) ) has a representation using ( n ) number of ( k )'s, so we conclude that it is impossible to reach these numbers with only ( n-1 ) number of ( k )'s. 5. Finally, if for two such triples ( (i_1, j_1, m_1) neq (i_2, j_2, m_2) ) with ( m_1 geq m_2 ), we have     [    k^{m_1}left( k^{i_1} + j_1 right) = k^{m_2}left( k^{i_2} + j_2 right),    ]    then    [    k^{m_1 - m_2}left( k^{i_1} + j_1 right) = k^{i_2} + j_2.    ]    But if ( m_1 - m_2 > 0 ), the above equation implies ( k mid j_2 ), which is impossible because ( j_2 < k ). Therefore ( m_1 = m_2 ) and so ( k^{i_1} + j_1 = k^{i_2} + j_2 ). 6. Without loss of generality, we assume ( i_1 geq i_2 ). So    [    k^{i_2}left( k^{i_1 - i_2} - 1 right) = j_2 - j_1.    ]    Again, if ( i_1 > i_2 ), we get ( k mid j_2 - j_1 ). Note that ( j_1, j_2 in {1, ldots, k-1} ), therefore ( -k < |j_1 - j_2| < k ), so we must have ( j_1 - j_2 = 0 ) and thus ( k^{i_1} = k^{i_2} ) which means ( i_1 = i_2 ), that is impossible in this case because we assumed that ( i_1 > i_2 ). The only possible case is when ( i_1 = i_2 ) which leads to ( j_1 = j_2 ). Therefore ( (i_1, j_1, m_1) = (i_2, j_2, m_2) ), contradiction. 7.

For the term ((sin theta + cos theta)^2):        (sin theta + cos theta)^2 = sin^2 theta + 2sin theta cos theta + cos^2 theta = 1 + 2sin theta cos theta     7. Summing the simplified terms:        left| mathbf{m} + mathbf{n} right|^2 = 3 + 2sqrt{2} cos theta - 2sqrt{2} sin theta + 1 + 2sin theta cos theta         8. Now combine like terms:        = 4 + 2sqrt{2} (cos theta - sin theta)     9. Since the magnitude (left| mathbf{m} + mathbf{n} right| = frac{8sqrt{2}}{5}):        left(frac{8sqrt{2}}{5}right)^2 = 4 + 2sqrt{2} (cos theta - sin theta)            frac{128}{25} = 4 + 2sqrt{2} (cos theta - sin theta)            frac{128}{25} - 4 = 2sqrt{2} (cos theta - sin theta)            frac{128 - 100}{25} = 2sqrt{2} (cos theta - sin theta)            frac{28}{25} = 2sqrt{2} (cos theta - sin theta)         10. Solving for (cos theta - sin theta):          cos theta - sin theta = frac{14}{25sqrt{2}}      11. Recall the identity:          1 + cos (theta + frac{pi}{4})          Substitute into our expression for easier computation:          cos (theta + frac{pi}{4}) = cos frac{(theta - frac{pi}{2})}{2}      12. Solve for the given in the problem:          5 cos left(frac{theta}{2} + frac{pi}{8}right) + 5      13. We know that (cos left(frac{theta}{2} + frac{pi}{8}right) = -frac{4}{5}), when (cos (frac{theta}{2} + frac{pi}{8}) < 0 ) this implies:          5 cos left(frac{theta}{2} + frac{pi}{8}right) + 5 = 5 left(-frac{4}{5}right) + 5 =  -4 + 5 = 1      # Conclusion: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the following functions: ① y=x^23|x|+2;   ② y=x^2, x in (2, 2];   ③ y=x^3;   ④ y=x1,   among them, the even functions are ( ) A: ① B: ①③ C: ①② D: ②④","output":"**Answer**: First, determine whether the domain of the function is symmetric about the origin.

Additionally, b^2 = a^2 - c^2, so b = 1. Thus, the equation of the ellipse (C) is frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1. (2) From the problem statement, we know that |m|geqslant 1.

The sum of its first n terms T_n = n + frac{3}{2}n(n-1) = frac{3}{2}n^2 - frac{1}{2}n.

Also, a_7 = a_1 + 6 = 7,   thus a_9 = 9, a_3 = a_9 - 6 = 3.   Thus a_{3n} = 3 + 3(n-1) = 3n, a_{3n-1} = 2 + 3(n-1) = 3n-1, a_{3n-2} = 1 + 3(n-1) = 3n-2, a_{3n-3} = 3 + 3(n-2) = 3n-3.   Thus a_{3n} - a_{3n-1} = a_{3n-1} - a_{3n-2} = a_{3n-2} - a_{3n-3} = 1, i.e., a_{n+1} - a_n = 1, which holds for all n in mathbb{N}^*,   thus the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term and common difference both being 1.   (3) Solution: b_n = n + ac^{S_n+a} = c^{frac{S_n+a}{n+a}}, the sequence {b_n} is a geometric sequence, i.e., frac{b_{n+1}}{b_n} = c^{frac{S_{n+1}+a}{n+1+a} - frac{S_n+a}{n+a}} is a constant,   thus the sequence left{ frac{S_n+a}{n+a} right} is an arithmetic sequence.   frac{S_{n+1}+a}{n+1+a} - frac{S_n+a}{n+a} = frac{(n+a)a_{n+1}-S_n-a}{(n+1+a)(n+a)},   let frac{(n+a)a_{n+1}-S_n-a}{(n+1+a)(n+a)} = lambda, simplifying gives: (n+a)a_{n+1} - S_n - a = lambda[n^2+(2a+1)n+a(a+1)],   for n geq 2, (n-1+a)a_n - S_{n-1} - a = lambda[(n-1)^2+(2a+1)(n-1)+a(a+1)].

Thus, the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with both the first term and common difference being 1,   thus a_n = n, S_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}, and substituting back gives (n+a)a_{n+1} - S_n - a = lambda[n^2+(2a+1)n+a(a+1)], simplifying gives a^2+a=0,   and since a geq 0, solving gives boxed{a=0}."},{"instruction":"A circle with center O is tangent to the coordinate axes and to the hypotenuse of a 45^circ45^circ90^circ triangle ABC, where AB=2.

Let's analyze the conditions for segments A_{i}A_{j} and when they are parallel to each other. Specifically, segment A_{i}A_{j} is parallel to segment A_{i-k}A_{j-k} for any k. 3. For odd-sided polygons (odd n), each diagonal A_{i}A_{j} is parallel to exactly one of the sides. This means every pair of diagonals that are parallel corresponds to the arrangement of such sides. 4. For even-sided polygons (even n), there are two cases:     - Each diagonal is parallel to one of the sides.    - Each diagonal is parallel to one of the \\"small\\" diagonals (those connecting vertices that skip exactly one vertex).  5. Therefore, in any n-gon (both odd and even), there are precisely n different categories of parallel segments. 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, the maximum number of pairwise non-parallel segments in a regular n-gon is exactly one for each category mentioned above, which gives us n non-parallel segments.

Since ( x ) must be in this set, ( B ) wins. 3. **Case ( N > 2^k )**:    - Player ( B ) asks about the set ( S = {1, 2, ldots, 2^k} ) for ( k+1 ) consecutive times.    - If ( A ) responds \\"yes\\" all ( k+1 ) times, at least one \\"yes\\" must be truthful, so ( x in S ) and ( B ) wins by choosing ( X = S ). 4. **Handling a \\"no\\" Response**:    - If ( A ) responds \\"no\\" at least once, ( B ) constructs ( k ) sets ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k ) where ( S_i ) contains all elements ( g in S ) for which the ( i )-th digit in the binary form of ( g ) is ( 0 ).    - ( B ) asks about each ( S_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). 5. **Constructing ( X )**:    - Let ( X ) be the number whose ( j )-th binary digit is ( 1 ) if ( A ) responded \\"yes\\" to ( S_j ), and ( 0 ) if \\"no\\".    - If ( x = X ), then ( A ) must have lied in all ( k ) responses to ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k ), which is impossible since ( k+1 ) consecutive lies are not allowed. 6. **Reduction**:    - Since ( x neq X ), ( B ) has effectively reduced the possible values of ( x ) from ( N ) to ( N-1 ).    - By repeating this process, ( B ) can eventually reduce the possible values to a set of size ( le 2^k ), ensuring a win. Thus, ( B ) can guarantee a win if ( n ge 2^k ). # Part (b) We need to show that for sufficiently large ( k ), there exists an integer ( n ge (1.99)^k ) such that ( B ) cannot guarantee a win. 1. **Setup**:    - Let ( N = n + 1 ) where ( n = lfloor (2-c)c^{k+1} rfloor - 1 ) for some constant ( 1.99 < c < 2 ). 2. **Initial Condition**:    - Initially, ( Q = n + 1 ). 3. **Inductive Hypothesis**:    - Assume ( Q < c^{k+1} ) at some point. 4. **Player ( B )'s Question**:    - ( B ) asks whether ( x in T ). 5. **Player ( A )'s Strategy**:    - If ( A ) lies, ( a_i ) increases by 1 for ( i in T ) and resets to 0 for ( j notin T ).    - If ( A ) tells the truth, ( a_i ) resets to 0 for ( i in T ) and increases by 1 for ( j notin T ). 6. **Minimizing ( Q )**:    - ( Q_1 = (|N| - |T|) + c sum_{i in T} c^{a_i} )    - ( Q_2 = |T| + c sum_{j notin T} c^{a_j} )    - ( text{min}(Q_1, Q_2) le frac{Q_1 + Q_2}{2} = frac{n+1 + cQ}{2} ) 7. **Inductive Step**:    - Since ( n + 1 le (2-c)c^{k+1} ) and ( Q < c^{k+1} ),    - ( frac{1}{2}(n + 1 + cQ) < frac{1}{2}[(2-c)c^{k+1} + c^{k+2}] = c^{k+1} )    - Thus, ( text{min}(Q_1, Q_2) < c^{k+1} ).

Considering a 20% to 40% loss in baby survival rate, how many babies are expected this season?","output":"To calculate the expected number of baby hawks this season, we need to follow these steps: 1. Calculate the average number of hawks per kettle. 2. Calculate the average pregnancy rate. 3. Calculate the average number of babies per batch. 4. Calculate the average survival rate. 5. Apply these averages to the total number of kettles. Let's start with the average number of hawks per kettle: Average number of hawks per kettle = (18 + 25) / 2 = 43 / 2 = 21.5 hawks Next, we calculate the average pregnancy rate: Average pregnancy rate = (40% + 60%) / 2 = 100% / 2 = 50% Now, we calculate the average number of babies per batch: Average number of babies per batch = (5 + 8) / 2 = 13 / 2 = 6.5 babies Then, we calculate the average survival rate after considering the loss: Average loss rate = (20% + 40%) / 2 = 60% / 2 = 30% Average survival rate = 100% - 30% = 70% Now, we apply these averages to the total number of kettles: Total number of hawks across all kettles = 21.5 hawks/kettle * 15 kettles = 322.5 hawks Total number of pregnant hawks = 322.5 hawks * 50% = 161.25 pregnant hawks Since we can't have a fraction of a hawk, we'll round down to 161 pregnant hawks. Total number of babies expected before survival rate = 161 pregnant hawks * 6.5 babies/hawk = 1046.5 babies Again, we can't have a fraction of a baby hawk, so we'll round down to 1046 babies. Total number of surviving babies = 1046 babies * 70% survival rate = 732.2 babies Rounding down to the nearest whole number, we can expect approximately boxed{732}  baby hawks to survive this season."},{"instruction":", b, and c completed a piece of work. a worked for 6 days, b for 9 days, and c for 4 days.

Consider the quadratic function ax^2 + bx + c, where the coefficients a, b, and c are consecutive integers, and the roots are x_1 and x_2. 2.

If one of the roots is 0, then by Vieta's formulas:    [    c=0     ]    This contradicts the concept of five consecutive integers since 0 cannot be part of the product of coefficients or roots if related to the polynomial. 9. This implies that both the roots and the constant c are non-zero. Therefore, b must equal 0.

Considering the possible pairs of roots satisfying these conditions, we have two scenarios:     1. The roots are 1 and -1.

What is the maximum number of these sums that can be perfect squares? 1. **Identify the range of possible sums**:    - The smallest sum of digits in any row is:      [      1 + 2 + 3 = 6      ]    - The largest sum of digits in any row is:      [      7 + 8 + 9 = 24      ]    - Therefore, we need to identify which sums between 6 and 24 can be perfect squares. 2. **Determine which numbers within the range are perfect squares**:    - The perfect squares between 6 and 24 are:      [      9 quad (text{since } 3^2 = 9)      ]      [      16 quad (text{since } 4^2 = 16)      ] 3. **Assume sums of 9 and 16**:    If each row's sum must either be 9 or 16, we must consider if it is possible for all three rows' sums to be one of these values. 4. **Calculate the total sum of all digits**:    - The sum of all digits from 1 to 9 is given by:      [      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45      ] 5. **Evaluate the modulo 7 test**:    - Let the sum of the digits in three rows be ( S_1, S_2,) and ( S_3 ).    - According to the assumption, ( S_1, S_2 ), and ( S_3 ) must be either 9 or 16.    - If three sums are 9 or 16, for simplicity, assume ( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 equiv 9 pmod{7} ) (similar calculation applies for 16).    - Then, the sum of three 9's modulo 7 is:      [      9 + 9 + 9 = 27 quad Implies quad 27 mod 7 = 6      ]    - The sum of three 16's modulo 7 is:      [      16 + 16 + 16 = 48 quad Implies quad 48 mod 7 = 6      ]    - So the total must give a remainder of 6 modulo 7.

If there are ( n ) matchsticks at the start of Vasya's turn and ( n ) is odd, then removing one matchstick from ( n ) will still result in an even number of matchsticks for the next turn of Petya. 2. **Game Objective Analysis**: The game is won by the player who makes a move such that no (1 times 1) squares remain. A critical observation in this scenario is that:     - The winner's move will result in either isolated squares or at least two adjacent squares being destroyed. 3. **Vasya’s Advantage**: Vasya can ensure his victory by making strategic moves. These moves are designed so that by his next turn, there aren't any positions left which would allow Petya to dismantle the structure and win. 4. **Strategy in Different Cases**:     - **Case 1: More than three squares remaining**: Vasya will take an edge matchstick that affects at most one square. This minimal disturbance increases the chance that some squares remain, preventing Petya from winning in Penya's subsequent turn.     - **Case 2: Three squares remaining**: If three squares remain, Vasya will take a matchstick that does not belong to any of these three squares (if possible). If there are no such matchsticks left, then due to the odd number of matchsticks, at least two of these squares must be adjacent. Vasya can then destroy one of the squares from these adjacent ones.     - **Case 3: Two non-adjacent squares remaining**: Because the number of remaining matchsticks is odd, there must be a matchstick that does not belong to either of these two remaining squares. Vasya will then take this matchstick, leaving still two non-adjacent squares, further complicating Petya's winning chance in the next move. 5. **Ensuring the Win**: By always following this strategy, Vasya will never leave behind a position that guarantees Petya's win in the next move.

A suitable configuration to verify this condition is to distribute ( n-1 ) arcs of equal length and one additional arc with an appropriate length can achieve this goal. 3. **Example Configuration**:    Place ( n-1 ) arcs of length ( frac{360^circ (n-1)}{n^2} ) each such that the centers of any two adjacent arcs are separated by ( frac{360^circ}{n} ), and place the ( n )-th arc at the remaining portion to match the necessary condition.

We can calculate the share of each person using the formula: Share = Investment amount × Time period For A: Share of A = 150 × 12 months For B: Share of B = 200 × 6 months Now, let's calculate the ratio of their shares: Ratio of A's share to B's share = (150 × 12) : (200 × 6) Ratio of A's share to B's share = 1800 : 1200 Ratio of A's share to B's share = 3 : 2 This means that for every 3 parts of the profit A gets, B gets 2 parts. We know that A's share of the profit is 60. Since A's share corresponds to 3 parts in the ratio, we can find the value of each part: Value of each part = A's share / 3 Value of each part = 60 / 3 Value of each part = 20 Now, we can find the total profit by adding A's and B's shares together. Since the ratio is 3:2, there are a total of 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

For any six cells of the same color arranged in a single row, it is given that there are no cells of the same color above the leftmost one or below the rightmost one. We need to determine the smallest possible (n). 1. Consider one specific color, let's say blue. 2. Identify the leftmost five blue cells in each row, marking these cells with a cross and marking any remaining cells (if fewer than six blue cells are present in a row, mark all of them). 3. Realize that in each column, there is at most one blue cell marked with a naught (since otherwise, the condition specified in the problem would be violated for the top cell among the marked ones). 4. Thus, the maximum number of blue cells marked with a naught is at most (2023). Now, denote the total number of blue cells marked with a cross as (5 times 2023) because in each row, there are at most five such cells. 5. Hence, the total number of blue cells is bounded by:    [    2023 + 5 times 2023 = 6 times 2023    ] 6. This argument holds true for any color. Thus, the total number of cells divided by six times the number of colors gives:    [    frac{2023^2}{6 times 2023} = frac{2023}{6} = 337 frac{1}{6}    ]    Therefore, the necessary condition becomes (n geqslant 338).

Color the first six diagonals with the first color, the next six with the second color, and so on. This ensures that after using the 338th color, the cycle begins again with the first color.     3.

The intersection of these three circles is the triangle  Delta ABC. 7. **Further Restrictions**:    If ( P ) were to form an equilateral triangle with any other point, ( P ) has to be a vertex of the resulting equilateral triangle formed by a rotation of 60 degrees about ( A ), say ( Q ) and ( R ), within the boundary of the triangle.     8. **Further Constraints**:    Therefore, ( P ) can be either point ( Q ) or ( R ); however, these points lie strictly within the boundary of ( T ) in ( Delta ABC. 9. **Conclusion**:    By symmetry and restrictions, all such points ( P ) must fall within the intersections, proving no point in ( Gamma ) can exist outside the initially defined boundary defined by triangles. Further points within ( Gamma ) thus only include initially selected points, proving ( Gamma ) can only have three points overall, constrained within the triangles formed by point equilateral conditions.

We need to prove that the median of triangle ( APQ ) from vertex ( A ) is perpendicular to ( PQ ) and equal to half of ( PQ ). 1. **Understanding the Problem**:     - We start by identifying a square with center ( O ).     - The square is both inscribed in and circumscribed around circles.     - Point ( A ) is anywhere on the smaller arc of the circumcircle.     - Tangents from ( A ) touching the inscribed circle at points ( B ) and ( C ).     - Segment intersections on sides define additional key points ( P ) and ( Q ). 2. **Notations and Transformations**:     - To solve, consider the properties of the tangents and intersections clearly.     - Recognize how transformations, typically rotations and reflections, can preserve important metrics such as angles and lengths. 3. **Symmetry and Geometric Properties**:     - Since ( B ) and ( C ) are points of tangency, ( AB = AC ).     - Consider the properties of a square and the symmetry it entails.     - Understanding that rotating the structure by 90 degrees ( left(frac{pi}{2}right) ) will help establish symmetrical properties. 4. **Rotations and Correspondences**:     - By considering a 90-degree rotation around ( O ), it is straightforward to see that ( B ) maps to ( C ) and vice versa.     - Consequently, ( P ) and ( Q ) will similarly correspond due to equal spacing and pivot by the circle's symmetry and the connections. 5. **Key Geometrical Insight**:     - As a result of these symmetries, analyzing the median of triangle ( APQ ) helps simplify dramatically.     - By recognizing the rotational and reflective symmetry about the median line derived from the median's perpendicularities. 6. **Final Proof**:     - Point ( P ) lies on ( AB ) and likewise for ( Q ) on ( AC ).     - Because those two derivations are symmetric about center ( O ), median from ( A ) to the midpoint of ( PQ ) (let's call it ( M )) splits ( PQ ) symmetrically and perpendicularly.     - Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( PQ ), the characteristics prove the median’s length (frac{1}{2}PQ ).

Thus, the integral becomes:    [    int_0^1 f(a^3 x^3) , dx = int_0^{a^3} f(y) frac{dy}{3a^3 x^2}    ]    Since ( x = left(frac{y}{a^3}right)^{1/3} ), we have ( dx = frac{1}{3a^3} left(frac{y}{a^3}right)^{-2/3} dy ):    [    int_0^{a^3} f(y) frac{dy}{3a^3 left(frac{y}{a^3}right)^{2/3}} = frac{1}{a} int_0^{a^3} f(y) , dy    ] 5. **Simplifying the Integral**: The integral simplifies to:    [    frac{1}{a} int_0^{a^3} f(y) , dy = 0    ] 6. **Implication**: Since ( frac{1}{a} ) is a non-zero constant, we have:    [    int_0^{a^3} f(y) , dy = 0    ] 7. **Differentiating with Respect to ( a )**: To show that ( f(y) = 0 ) for all ( y in [0,1] ), differentiate both sides with respect to ( a ):    [    frac{d}{da} left( int_0^{a^3} f(y) , dy right) = 0    ]    Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the chain rule, we get:    [    f(a^3) cdot 3a^2 = 0    ] 8. **Conclusion for ( f )**: Since ( 3a^2 neq 0 ) for ( 0 < a < 1 ), it follows that:    [    f(a^3) = 0 quad text{for all} quad 0 < a < 1    ]    Since ( a^3 ) can take any value in ( (0,1) ) as ( a ) ranges over ( (0,1) ), we conclude that:    [    f(x) = 0 quad text{for all} quad x in (0,1)    ] 9. **Continuity Argument**: By the continuity of ( f ) on ([0,1]), and since ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x in (0,1) ), it follows that:    [    f(x) = 0 quad text{for all} quad x in [0,1]    ] (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Jill has 35 gallons of water stored in quart, halfgallon, and onegallon jars.

These counts are ensured to be even to satisfy the problem condition. 3. **Summing Up Birds Between the First and the Last of the Same Species**:    - The total number of birds between (A_1) and (A_3) would be:      [      2x + 2y + 1      ]      Here, the (+1) accounts for the bird (A_2) sitting between (A_1) and (A_3).      - This sum (2x + 2y + 1) is clearly an *odd number*. 4. **Contradiction**:    - Since we have derived that there would be an odd number of birds between (A_1) and (A_3), this contradicts the given condition that between any two birds of the same species, there must be an *even* number of birds.    - Therefore, it is impossible to have three or more birds of the same species. 5. **Determining the Minimum Number of Species**:    - Given the above condition, each species can only have up to 2 birds.    - To find the minimum number of species required, we set (s) as the total number of species. Each species can at most have 2 birds. 6. **Calculation**:    - Let (s) be the number of species, then the maximum number of birds for (s) species is (2s).    - We need these (2s) birds to be equal to or greater than 2021 to cover the total number of birds.

There are two ways this can happen: HT or TH. So we can write the equation: P(H) * P(T) + P(T) * P(H) = 1/2 Since P(H) * P(T) is the same as P(T) * P(H), we can simplify the equation to: 2 * P(H) * P(T) = 1/2 Dividing both sides by 2, we get: P(H) * P(T) = 1/4 Now, we want to find the probability of getting two heads and two tails when the coin is tossed 4 times.

[ SP = MP times (1 - frac{25}{100}) ] [ SP = MP times 0.75 ] Now, we know that the gain percent is 17.1875%, which means that the selling price is 117.1875% of the cost price. [ SP = CP times (1 + frac{17.1875}{100}) ] [ SP = CP times 1.171875 ] Since both expressions for SP are equal, we can set them equal to each other: [ MP times 0.75 = CP times 1.171875 ] Now, we want to find the percentage of the cost price to the marked price, which is ( frac{CP}{MP} times 100 ). Let's solve for ( frac{CP}{MP} ): [ frac{CP}{MP} = frac{0.75}{1.171875} ] Now, calculate the fraction: [ frac{CP}{MP} = frac{0.75}{1.171875} approx 0.64 ] To find the percentage, multiply by 100: [ frac{CP}{MP} times 100 approx 0.64 times 100 = 64% ] Therefore, the cost price is boxed{64%}  of the marked price."},{"instruction":"Liam and Claire picked and sold oranges to save for their mother's birthday gift.

Comparing this with the given equation, we can rewrite the given equation in the form of a circle by completing the square for both x and y. The given equation is x^2 + y^2 - 2mx + (2m - 2)y + 2m^2 = 0.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. Length of the train = 460 meters Length of the bridge = 140 meters Total distance to cover = Length of the train + Length of the bridge Total distance to cover = 460 meters + 140 meters Total distance to cover = 600 meters Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the distance. Speed of the train = 45 km/hour To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds Speed of the train in m/s = 45 km/h * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Speed of the train in m/s = 45 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 45 * (5 / 18) Speed of the train in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s and the total distance in meters, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to pass the bridge = Total distance to cover / Speed of the train in m/s Time to pass the bridge = 600 meters / 12.5 m/s Time to pass the bridge = 48 seconds Therefore, it will take the train boxed{48}  seconds to pass the bridge."},{"instruction":"Given that one focus of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{9}  frac{y^2}{m} = 1 lies on the line x + y = 5, find the equation of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.","output":"The given hyperbola is frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{m} = 1. By definition, the foci of a hyperbola lie along its transverse axis. Since this hyperbola's transverse axis is aligned with the x-axis, and one focus is on the line x + y = 5, we can infer that the intersection point of the line with the x-axis gives us the focus of the hyperbola. Let's find this intersection point. The line intersects the x-axis where y = 0, so at the intersection point, we have x = 5. Therefore, the focus of the hyperbola is at (5,0). Now, we can find the equation for the semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b using the relationship that the sum of the squares of these values equals the square of the distance between a focus and the center on the x-axis: a^2 + b^2 = c^2. We know a^2 = 9 (from the hyperbola equation, where a^2 is under x^2), and c, the distance from the center to a focus, is 5 (since the focus is at (5,0)). Thus, we have 9 + b^2 = 5^2. Therefore, b^2 = 25 - 9 = 16. We conclude that m = b^2 = 16. Thus, the hyperbola's equation becomes frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{16} = 1. The equation of the asymptotes of a hyperbola in standard form frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 are y = ±frac{b}{a}x.

Now, if A were to complete the work alone, the total work would be equal to A's capacity multiplied by the number of days A takes to complete the work, which is 3x * d. Setting these two expressions for total work equal to each other, we get: 5x * 18 = 3x * d Now, we can solve for d: d = (5x * 18) / 3x Simplifying, we get: d = 5 * 18 / 3 d = 5 * 6 d = 30 Therefore, A would take boxed{30}  days to complete the work alone."},{"instruction":"Janice's office is on the third floor, and she has to walk up 3 flights of stairs to get to her office.

We also know that Janice walks a total of 24 flights of stairs in a day, both up and down. Since we already accounted for the 9 flights of stairs going down, we can subtract this from the total to find out how many flights of stairs she walks going up. So, ( 24 - 9 = 15 ) flights of stairs are walked going up. Since each trip up is 3 flights of stairs, we can find the number of times she goes up by dividing the total number of flights going up by the number of flights per trip up.

Given: f(-x) = frac{a cdot 2^{-x} - 1}{2^{-x} + 1} = -frac{a cdot 2^x - 1}{2^x + 1} This implies: frac{a - 2^x}{2^x + 1} = frac{-a cdot 2^x + 1}{2^x + 1} After simplification, we get: a - 2^x = -a cdot 2^x + 1 Further solving gives: (a - 1)(2^x + 1) = 0 From a - 1 = 0, we find a = 1.

Given that overrightarrow{c} is parallel to overrightarrow{d}, this implies that overrightarrow{c} is a scalar multiple of overrightarrow{d}. Substituting the given vectors, we get: overrightarrow{c}=(1+4,1+x)=(5,1+x) quad text{and} quad overrightarrow{d}=2cdot(1,1)+(4,x)=(6,2+x).  Since overrightarrow{c} is parallel to overrightarrow{d}, there exists a scalar k such that overrightarrow{c}=koverrightarrow{d}. Looking at the second component of the vectors, we get: 1+x=k(2+x).  For the vectors to be parallel, k must also satisfy the equation from the first components: 5=kcdot 6 implies k=frac{5}{6}.  Substituting this value into the previous equation, we get: 1+x=frac{5}{6}(2+x) implies 6+6x=5(2+x) implies 6+6x=10+5x implies x=boxed{4}.  (2) We are given sin alpha +cos alpha =frac{3sqrt{2}}{4}. Using the identity for the sum of sine and cosine of an angle, we can express this as: sin left(alpha+frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(sin alpha +cos alpha) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{3sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{3}{4}.  Given that alpha in left(0,frac{pi}{4}right), we know that alpha +frac{pi}{4} in left(frac{pi}{4},frac{pi}{2}right). Now, using the sine and cosine addition formula: cos left(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right) = cos alpha cos frac{pi}{4} - sin alpha sin frac{pi}{4}.  We need to find cos alpha given sin alpha +cos alpha =frac{3sqrt{2}}{4}. However, we do not have enough information to directly determine cos left(alpha +frac{pi}{4}right). We must first find sin alpha and cos alpha individually, using the given condition and Pythagorean identity sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1. The system of equations is: begin{cases} sin alpha + cos alpha = frac{3sqrt{2}}{4},  sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1. end{cases}  Squaring the first equation and using the second yields: sin^2 alpha + 2sin alpha cos alpha + cos^2 alpha = frac{9}{8}, which simplifies to: 1 + sin 2alpha = frac{9}{8} implies sin 2alpha = frac{1}{8}.  However, we need extra work to find cos alpha and sin alpha separately for solving cos left(alpha +frac{pi}{4}right). Considering this condition and the limitation, the solution here is incomplete, and further steps are required to find the exact values of sin alpha and cos alpha, and consequently, cos left(alpha +frac{pi}{4}right). Since sin alpha +cos alpha =frac{3sqrt{2}}{4} and given that alpha in left(0,frac{pi}{4}right), we know sin alpha and cos alpha are both positive and sin alpha geq cos alpha. Without loss of generality, following the hint from this system, we find sin alpha = cos alpha = frac{3sqrt{2}}{8}, which would satisfy both equations since left(frac{3sqrt{2}}{8}right)^2 + left(frac{3sqrt{2}}{8}right)^2=2left(frac{9}{64}right) = frac{9}{32} = 1 and frac{3sqrt{2}}{8} + frac{3sqrt{2}}{8}=frac{3sqrt{2}}{4}. Then we can compute cos left(alpha +frac{pi}{4}right) as follows: cos left(alpha +frac{pi}{4}right) = cos alpha cos frac{pi}{4} - sin alpha sin frac{pi}{4}= left(frac{3sqrt{2}}{8}right)left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) - left(frac{3sqrt{2}}{8}right)left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)= 0.  Therefore, we can conclude that cos left(alpha +frac{pi}{4}right)=boxed{0}, which can be inferred from the existence of an angle in the second quadrant where sine is positive and cosine is negative. (3) Since E and F are the midpoints of CD and BC in parallelogram ABCD, we can write the vectors as overrightarrow{AE} = frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AB}+overrightarrow{AD} and overrightarrow{AF}=overrightarrow{AB}+frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AD}. Also, by definition, we have overrightarrow{AC}=overrightarrow{AB}+overrightarrow{AD}. Applying the given condition overrightarrow{AC}=moverrightarrow{AE}+noverrightarrow{AF} gives us: overrightarrow{AB}+overrightarrow{AD} = mleft(frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AB}+overrightarrow{AD}right)+nleft(overrightarrow{AB}+frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AD}right).  Simplifying this equation component-wise, we get two equations: (1-m-n)overrightarrow{AB} + (1-m-n)overrightarrow{AD} = overrightarrow{0}.  Since overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AD} are non-zero vectors (and non-parallel being sides of the parallelogram), in order for their linear combination to be the zero vector, the scalar coefficients must be zero: 1-m-n=0 implies m+n=1.  This makes no sense, given the components must equate individually, we would have a system looking like: begin{cases} 1 = frac{m}{2} + n,  1 = m + frac{n}{2}. end{cases}  Solving this system gives us m=n=frac{2}{3}, and thus: m+n = frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{3} = boxed{frac{4}{3}}.  (4) Start by using the given condition tan frac{A+B}{2}=sin C and the trigonometric identities to analyze the statements and determine which ones are correct. Given that tan frac{A+B}{2}=sin C, and knowing that tan and sin are positive in the first quadrant, we infer that sin C > 0. Simplifying the given equation with the identity for tan of a half-angle, we obtain: frac{2tan frac{A+B}{4}}{1-tan^2 frac{A+B}{4}}=sin C.  Considering the sum of angles in a triangle is pi, we have C=pi - (A+B) and thus A+B+C=pi which implies A+B=frac{pi}{2} since sin C>0, hence C must be less than frac{pi}{2}. This concludes that A+B=frac{pi}{2}, so triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C. Therefore, conclusion ① is correct. Conclusion ② states frac{tan A}{tan B}=1. However, having a right triangle with A+B=frac{pi}{2} does not necessarily imply that tan A = tan B. Therefore, we cannot conclude that ② is correct without additional information about the specific values of angles A and B. For conclusion ③, we know that 1<sin A+sin Bleqslantsqrt{2} must be true if A and B are both acute angles in a right triangle. The maximum value is attained when A=B=frac{pi}{4}. So, conclusion ③ is correct. Conclusion ④ asserts that sin^2 A+cos^2 B=1. However, since A+B=frac{pi}{2} and B=frac{pi}{2}-A, we have cos^2 B = sin^2 A. Thus, sin^2 A+cos^2 B=1 is not always true unless A=B, which is not necessarily the case here. Therefore, conclusion ④ is not necessarily correct. Lastly, conclusion ⑤ states cos^2 A+cos^2 B=sin^2 C. Since C is a right angle, sin^2 C=1. Additionally, cos^2 A+cos^2 B=cos^2 A+sin^2 A=1 due to the Pythagorean identity. Therefore, conclusion ⑤ is correct. The correct conclusions are then ①, ③, and ⑤.

Since we assume at most 11 colors, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least leftlceil frac{100}{10} rightrceil = 10 segments of the same color.     - Let's denote these segments as Q_1Q_2, Q_1Q_3, ldots, Q_1Q_{11}, all the same color, say red (without loss of generality). 3. **Establish a Red Subgraph:**    - For any 2 leq i < j leq 11, the triangle Q_1Q_iQ_j has the two sides Q_1Q_i and Q_1Q_j both red. According to the problem's conditions, the third side Q_iQ_j must also be red.    - Thus, all segments connecting Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_{11} are red. 4. **Expand the Red Subgraph:**    - Consider the largest subset of points {Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_l} such that any two points in this subset are connected by a red segment. By what we just proved, l geq 11. 5. **Identify an External Point R:**    - If l < 101, there exists at least one point, say R, that is not in the set {Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_l}. Therefore, R is not connected by a red segment to any of these points. 6. **Examine the Connections of R to the Q_i:**     - R cannot be connected to any Q_j (1 leq j leq l) by a red segment.    - If R were connected to both Q_1 and Q_2 (with both segments in some color different from red, say blue), then in the triangle RQ_1Q_2, the segments RQ_1 and RQ_2 (both blue) would imply Q_1Q_2 (already known to be red) should also be blue—this is a contradiction. 7. **Determine the Color Usage:**    - Thus, R must be connected to each of the points Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_l with different colors, and none of these colors can be red.    - Since R is connected to l points by l different colors all different from red, at least l + 1 colors must be used in total. 8. **Minimum Color Requirement:**    - From step 4, we know that l leq 11, implying that the number of colors used is at least l + 1 geq 12. This directly contradicts our initial assumption that between 2 and 11 colors are used. # Conclusion: Therefore, the number of colors used must be either 1 or at least 12. Thus, the statement is proven. boxed{ }"},{"instruction":"A company is designing a larger cup for its new water dispenser. This cup will be a right circular cone with a fiveinch radius.

Suppose ( a ) can be expressed as:    [ a = p_1^{e_1} cdot p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ]    where ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are distinct prime numbers and ( e_1, e_2, ldots, e_k ) are their respective positive integer exponents.

Since 109 is a prime number, it can only be factored as 109 itself, meaning ( k = 1 ) and ( e_1 + 1 = 109 ). Thus:    [ e_1 = 108 ]    Hence, ( a ) can be written as:    [ a = p_1^{108} ] 4. **Sum of Divisors Formula:**    The sum of the divisors of ( a ), denoted as ( Sigma_d ), can be computed using the formula:    [ Sigma_d = sum_{i=0}^{108} p_1^i = frac{p_1^{109} - 1}{p_1 - 1} ] 5. **Product of Divisors:**    The product of the divisors of ( a ), denoted as ( Pi_d ), is given by:    [ Pi_d = a^{frac{tau(a)}{2}} ]    Substituting ( tau(a) = 109 ) and ( a = p_1^{108} ), we get:    [ Pi_d = (p_1^{108})^{frac{109}{2}} = p_1^{108 cdot frac{109}{2}} = p_1^{5886} ]    Since the product formula involves considering pairs of divisors (each being ( a )), the root term confirms the product calculation. 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the sum and product of the divisors of ( a ) can be expressed as:    [ Sigma_d = frac{a sqrt[108]{a} - 1}{sqrt[108]{a} - 1} ]    and    [ Pi_d = sqrt{a^{109}} ]    Hence, the final answers are:    [ boxed{Sigma_d = frac{a sqrt[108]{a} - 1}{sqrt[108]{a} - 1}, ; Pi_d = sqrt{a^{109}}} ] \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Given the sequence {a_n} with the sum of its first n terms S_n = 2a_n  2^{n+1}, if the inequality (1)^n lambda < frac{S_n}{S_{n+1}} holds true for all n in mathbb{N}^*, then the range of the real number lambda is ______.","output":"When n = 1, S_1 = 2a_1 - 2^2 yields a_1 = 4.

Since frac{a_1}{2^1} = 2, the sequence {frac{a_n}{2^n}} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 2 and common difference 1. Hence, frac{a_n}{2^n} = 2 + (n - 1), which implies a_n = (n + 1) cdot 2^n. Consequently, S_n = 2(n + 1) cdot 2^n - 2^{n+1} = n cdot 2^{n+1}, and thus frac{S_n}{S_{n+1}} = frac{n cdot 2^{n+1}}{(n + 1) cdot 2^{n+2}} = frac{n}{2(n + 1)}.

Substituting back into equation (1), we find: [[f(x)]^2 = x^2] This implies f(x) = x or f(x) = -x for all x. 7. **Determining the Function f(x):** If there exists an x such that f(x) = x, then f(f(x)) = f(x) = x. By equation (2), this implies x = -x or x = 0. Therefore, the only x for which f(x) = x is x = 0. Thus, for all x, f(x) = -x. 8. **Verifying the Solution:** It's straightforward to verify that f(x) = -x satisfies the original equation. 9. **Sum of All Possible Values of f(1):** Since f(x) = -x for all x, f(1) = -1.

Thus, this rotation does not map the figure onto itself. 2. **Translation along line ell:**    - Given the alternating pattern of triangles and circles, translating the sequence by the length of two units (one triangle and one circle together) will map each triangle to the next triangle and each circle to the next circle.

Starting from the given expression for (N_k), consider (k = n+1): [ N_{n+1} = frac{(2(n+1))!}{(n+1)!} ] We can relate (N_{n+1}) to (N_n) as follows: [ N_{n+1} = frac{(2(n+1))!}{(n+1)!} = frac{(2n+2)!}{(n+1)!} ] Using the property of factorials, we get: [ (2n+2)! = (2n+2)(2n+1)(2n)! ] and so, [ N_{n+1} = frac{(2n+2)(2n+1)(2n)!}{(n+1)!} ] Next, express (N_n) in terms of (n): [ N_n = frac{(2n)!}{n!} ] Now substitute back: [ N_{n+1} = frac{(2n+2)(2n+1)(2n)!}{(n+1)!} = (2n+2)(2n+1) times frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!} ] We know that: [ (n+1)! = (n+1) times n! ] Thus: [ frac{1}{(n+1)!} = frac{1}{(n+1)n!} ] And we get: [ N_{n+1} = (2n+2)(2n+1) times frac{1}{(n+1)} times frac{(2n)!}{n!} = (2n+2)(2n+1) frac{1}{n+1} N_n ] Simplifying: [ N_{n+1} = 2 left( n+1 right) (2n+1) frac{1}{n+1} N_n = 2(2n+1) N_n ] At this point, the induction hypothesis tells us that (N_n) is divisible by (2^n) but not by (2^{n+1}). Therefore, multiplying (2N_n) by the odd number (2n+1) still maintains the divisibility properties, so [ N_{n+1} = boxed{2(2n+1) N_n} ] is divisible by (2^{n+1}) but not (2^{n+2}). Thus, by induction, the statement is true for all (k). blacksquare"},{"instruction":"An integer   n ,   nge2  is called *friendly* if there exists a family   A_1,A_2,ldots,A_n  of subsets of the set   {1,2,ldots,n}  such that:\\r (1)   inotin A_i  for every   iequal{}overline{1,n} ;\\r (2)   iin A_j  if and only if   jnotin A_i , for every distinct   i,jin{1,2,ldots,n} ;\\r (3)   A_icap A_j  is nonempty, for every   i,jin{1,2,ldots,n} .\\r Prove that:\\r (a) 7 is a friendly number;\\r (b)   n  is friendly if and only if   nge7 .\\r \\r *Valentin Vornicu*","output":"To solve this problem, we need to show two things: 1.

So, the increasing interval of f(x) is (-infty,ln a), and the decreasing interval is (ln a,+infty). (2) From (1) we know, When aleqslant 0, f(x) is decreasing on (-infty,+infty), and f(0)=0, So, f(x)leqslant 0 cannot always hold on R; When a > 0, f(x) is increasing on (-infty,ln a), and decreasing on (ln a,+infty). The maximum value of f(x) is f(ln a)=aln a-a+1. Let g(a)=aln a-a+1, According to the problem, we have g(a)leqslant 0. The derivative of g(a) is g'(a)=ln a, and a > 0, So, g(a) is decreasing on (0,1), and increasing on (1,+infty), The minimum value of g(a) is g(1)=0, so ain(0,+infty). (3) Proof: From (2) we know that when a=1, f(ln x)=ln x-x+1leqslant 0 always holds, so we have ln xleqslant x-1 (x > 0). Then dfrac {f(ln n)-f(ln m)}{n-m}= dfrac {(ln n-n+1)-(ln m-m+1)}{n-m}= dfrac {ln dfrac {n}{m}}{n-m}-1 < dfrac { dfrac {n}{m}-1}{n-m}=dfrac {1}{m}-1, From ln xleqslant x-1 we know that -ln xgeqslant 1-x always holds on (0,+infty), So, dfrac {f(ln n)-f(ln m)}{n-m}= dfrac {ln dfrac {n}{m}}{n-m}-1= dfrac {-ln dfrac {m}{n}}{n-m}-1 > dfrac {1- dfrac {m}{n}}{n-m}-1= dfrac {1}{n}-1.

Points (P) and (Q) are the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from (H) to sides (AB) and (AC), respectively. We need to prove that (angle BQH = angle CPH). 1. **Identify the Perpendiculars and Right Angles:**    Since (A H) is the altitude, it is perpendicular to side (BC). Thus, (angle AHB = angle AHC = 90^circ).    Since (HP) and (HQ) are perpendiculars dropped from (H) to (AB) and (AC), we have:    [[    angle HPB = angle HQA = 90^circ]    ] 2. **Use Angle Complementarity for ( angle PHA):**    Note that (angle PHA) and (angle HBA) are complementary because they sum up to (90^circ) with (angle PAH = 90^circ):    [    angle PHA + angle BAH = 90^circ    ]    Similarly,    [    angle QHA + angle CAH = 90^circ    ]  3. **Observe the Inscribed Angles:**    From the problem, we know the circle centered at (H) with diameter (AH) passes through points (P) and (Q). Since (angle PQA) and (angle PHA) are inscribed in the circle subtending the same arc (PA), they are equal.    Thus:    [    angle PQA = angle PHA    ] 4. **Identify the Cyclic Quadrilateral:**    Quadrilateral (BQPC) is cyclic as (PBQC) can be inscribed in a circle because opposite angles of cyclical quadrilateral ( angle BQC ) and ( angle BPC ) sum up to ( 180^circ ).    Thus:        [    angle BQC = angle BPC    ] 5. **Deduce ( angle BQH = angle CPH ):**    Since (angle BQH) is exterior to (triangle BQH) and subtends arc (PH) in the circumcircle, it must be equal to:    [    angle BQC - 90^circ = angle CPH - 90^circ    ]    Therefore:    [    angle BQH = angle CPH    ] # Conclusion: By using properties of inscribed angles and cyclic quadrilaterals within the given triangle setup, we have shown that (angle BQH = angle CPH).

Given: Banker's Discount (BD) = Rs. 72 True Discount (TD) = Rs. 60 The interest rates vary over three 4-month periods: First 4 months: 4% per annum Next 4 months: 6% per annum Last 4 months: 8% per annum Let's calculate the total interest rate for the entire year by averaging the rates over the 12 months: Total interest rate for the year = (4% * 4/12) + (6% * 4/12) + (8% * 4/12) Total interest rate for the year = (4/3)% + (2%) + (8/3)% Total interest rate for the year = (4/3 + 24/3 + 8/3)% Total interest rate for the year = (36/3)% Total interest rate for the year = 12% Now, let's find the time period for which the discounts are calculated. Since the interest rates are given per annum, we can assume that the discounts are also calculated for a one-year period. The relationship between BD, TD, and the rate of interest (R) is given by the formula: BD = TD * (1 + (R * T)) Where T is the time period in years. Since we are assuming a one-year period, T = 1. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the Sum (S): S = BD + TD We already have the values for BD and TD, so we can calculate the Sum (S): S = Rs. 72 + Rs. 60 S = Rs. 132 Therefore, the sum due is Rs. boxed{132} ."},{"instruction":"a music theory exam scored out of 110 points, the scores were recorded in the following stemandleaf plot.

Start with the smallest possible digit in the thousands place to minimize the number—this digit should be odd. The smallest odd digit is 1. 2. Place the smallest possible even digit in the hundreds place. The smallest even digit is 0, but since we want to minimize the sum yet meet the divisibility rule, let's choose 2, a slightly larger even digit to allow for smaller odd digits later. 3. Now, we need two more odd digits in the tens and units places that, when combined with 1 and 2, are divisible by 9. The smallest odd digits are 1 and 3, so we try these first. The sum is ( 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7 ), which is not divisible by 9.  4. Next, keep the 1 in the thousands place, 2 in the hundreds place, and increase the digits in the tens and units places.

Каковы критерии привлечения участников в фокус-группы?","output":"Фокус-группы образуются для решения различных целей, таких как: 1. Исследование рынка: они помогают определить потребности и предпочтения целевой аудитории, выявить тренды и рыночные возможности. 2. Разработка новых продуктов и услуг: фокус-группы позволяют получить обратную связь от потенциальных потребителей, чтобы улучшить идеи и концепции. 3. Улучшение существующих продуктов и услуг: они могут помочь выявить проблемы или слабые места в продукции и предложить конкретные улучшения. 4. Тестирование рекламных кампаний: фокус-группы могут помочь в оценке реакции целевой аудитории на предложенные рекламные материалы и стратегии. Когда привлекают участников в фокус-группы, учитываются различные критерии. Они могут быть следующими: 1. Демографические данные: участники должны отражать целевую аудиторию, поэтому выбор осуществляется на основе критериев, таких как возраст, пол, местоположение, доход и т. д. 2. Предпочтения и интересы: участники должны иметь определенный опыт или интерес в отношении темы исследования. 3. Вовлеченность и активность: предпочтение отдается участникам, которые проявляют более высокую степень активности и готовности делиться своими мнениями и мыслями. 4. Разнообразие: стремятся обеспечить наличие различных мнений и точек зрения, поэтому стараются привлечь участников с разными бэкграундами и опытом. Все эти критерии помогают образовать фокус-группу, которая может наиболее эффективно выполнить поставленные цели исследования."},{"instruction":"Какова роль экспериментов в проведении маркетинговых исследований?","output":"Эксперименты играют важную роль в проведении маркетинговых исследований, так как они позволяют исследователям получить объективные и надежные данные для принятия решений. Вот несколько примеров роли экспериментов в маркетинговых исследованиях: 1. Определение причинно-следственных связей: эксперименты позволяют исключить или контролировать влияние других факторов, чтобы определить, какие факторы точно влияют на результирующую переменную. Например, в тестировании рекламных кампаний эксперимент может показать, какой именно элемент рекламы (например, цвет фона, использование конкретного слова и т. д.) влияет на эффективность кампании. 2. Оценка эффективности: эксперименты позволяют сравнивать эффективность разных маркетинговых стратегий или тактик. Например, эксперимент можно провести, чтобы определить, какой бонус при покупке привлекает больше клиентов - скидка в процентах или фиксированная сумма. 3. Тестирование новых концепций: эксперименты позволяют проверить эффективность новых идей или концепций перед их внедрением на рынок. Например, можно провести эксперимент, чтобы определить, насколько успешно новый продукт будет принят потребителями, или насколько эффективно новое упаковочное решение будет привлекать внимание покупателей. 4. Оптимизация маркетинговых стратегий: эксперименты позволяют тестировать и оптимизировать различные аспекты маркетинговых стратегий, такие как ценовая политика, расположение товара на полке, коммуникационные каналы и др. Например, можно провести эксперимент, чтобы определить оптимальную цену для продукта, которая максимизирует продажи и доход. Все эти примеры демонстрируют, что эксперименты играют ключевую роль в маркетинговых исследованиях, помогая исследователям принимать обоснованные и эффективные решения на основе проверяемых и управляемых данных."},{"instruction":"В чем различие между лабораторным экспериментом и экспериментом, проводимым в реальных условиях?","output":"Основное различие между лабораторным экспериментом и экспериментом, проводимым в реальных условиях, заключается в контексте, в котором они проводятся и уровне контроля. Лабораторный эксперимент проводится в специально созданных и контролируемых условиях в лаборатории или исследовательской среде. Исследователь имеет полный контроль над множеством факторов, таких как температура, освещение, воздействие сторонних факторов и т.д. Это позволяет исследователям более точно измерять и изолировать влияние конкретных переменных на результаты эксперимента. Однако лабораторные условия могут отличаться от реальных условий, поэтому результаты могут быть менее применимыми к реальным ситуациям. Эксперимент, проводимый в реальных условиях (называемый также полевым экспериментом или экспериментом в естественной среде), проводится в более естественной и ежедневной среде. Исследователю доступны реальные пользователи или потребители, реальные продукты или услуги, реальные рыночные факторы и т.д. Это позволяет исследователям представлять реальные условия, в которых будут использоваться или продаваться продукты или услуги. Однако в таких условиях контроль над факторами может быть ограничен, и могут влиять сторонние переменные, что может затруднить атрибуцию результатов эксперимента. Выбор между лабораторным экспериментом и экспериментом, проводимым в реальных условиях, зависит от задач исследования и доступных ресурсов. В случае, если исследователю важно иметь высокий уровень контроля над переменными и минимизировать влияние сторонних факторов, лабораторный эксперимент может быть предпочтительным. Если же интерес исследования заключается в реакции пользователей в реальном окружении или в оценке эффективности стратегий в реальных условиях, эксперимент, проводимый в реальных условиях, может быть более подходящим."},{"instruction":"Ofera-mi informatii si o poza despre podul Anghel Saligny de peste dunare.","output":"Podul Anghel Saligny, cunoscut și sub numele de Podul de la Cernavodă, este un pod feroviar care traversează Dunărea între localitățile Fetesti și Cernavodă din România. Este unul dintre cele mai vechi poduri construite peste Dunăre și a fost inaugurat în anul 1895. Podul a fost proiectat de inginerul român Anghel Saligny, care a conceput o structură inovatoare pentru acea perioadă. Podul are o lungime totală de 4.088 de metri și utilizează o combinație de elemente de oțel și beton. Principalul element al podului este un arc metalic de oțel, cu o deschidere de 190 de metri, care este susținut de două piloni în formă de turnuri. Pilonii au o înălțime de 68 de metri și sunt realizați din beton armat. În timpul construcției, au fost utilizate aproximativ 10.000 de tone de oțel, iar lucrările au durat aproximativ 4 ani. Podul Anghel Saligny a fost considerat, în momentul finalizării sale, drept unul dintre cele mai mărețe proiecte de inginerie din lume. Astăzi, podul îndeplinește rolul de a lega cele două maluri ale Dunării și permite trecerea trenurilor între regiunile Munteniei și Dobrogei. A devenit, de asemenea, o atracție turistică, fiind considerat un simbol al inovației tehnologice și al ingineriei românești.

В лабораторном эксперименте все факторы и условия могут быть полностью контролируемыми и манипулируемыми исследователем, что позволяет более точно изучить и изолировать воздействие интересующих факторов на исследуемый процесс. Эксперимент, проводимый в реальных условиях, происходит в реальной среде и под влиянием реальных факторов и условий, которые могут быть частично или полностью непредсказуемыми и неконтролируемыми. В таком эксперименте исследователь смотрит на влияние факторов и условий, как они есть, и наблюдает их взаимодействие с исследуемым процессом в естественном окружении. Таким образом, лабораторный эксперимент обеспечивает более строгий контроль над условиями и более точные и однозначные результаты, но может потерять в реалистичности и обобщаемости на реальные условия. Эксперимент в реальных условиях может быть менее контролируемым и предсказуемым, но позволяет проверить гипотезы и исследовать воздействие факторов в более реалистичном контексте."},{"instruction":"В каких случаях, по вашему мнению, необходимо применять наблюдение для сбора маркетинговой информации?","output":"Наблюдение является полезным и эффективным методом сбора маркетинговой информации в следующих случаях: 1.

Например, при изучении потребительских привычек в супермаркете или поведения покупателей в розничных точках. 2. Когда респонденты могут быть не в состоянии или не захотеть поделиться информацией при опросах или интервью. Наблюдение позволяет избежать возможных проблем с отчетностью или искажением данных. 3. Когда требуется подтверждение или проверка данных, полученных из других исследовательских методов. Наблюдение может использоваться для проверки достоверности или коррекции данных, полученных при интервьюировании или опросах. 4. Когда исследователи стремятся получить объективную и точную информацию о поведении или предпочтениях целевой аудитории. Наблюдение позволяет избежать возможных искажений или неправильных интерпретаций, которые могут возникнуть при использовании других методов сбора данных. 5. Когда исследуемый процесс происходит в реальном времени или реальной среде. Наблюдение позволяет изучать поведение или явления в естественной среде, без влияния лабораторных условий или самоотчетов респондентов.

To set up different colors for different \`TODO\` states in Spacemacs, you will typically rely on configuring Org mode, as it's commonly used for managing tasks and TODO lists within Emacs. To achieve this, you can customize your Org mode keywords and faces (colors, font weight, etc.). Here is a step-by-step guide: 1. Open your Spacemacs configuration file (\`.spacemacs\`), or if you're using Spacemacs with a version that supports separate configuration layers, open your \`config.el\` file in your private layer. 2. Locate the \`dotspacemacs/user-config\` section, where you will place your custom configurations. 3. Customize your \`org-todo-keywords\` and \`org-todo-keyword-faces\`. Here is an example configuration: \`\`\`emacs-lisp (defun dotspacemacs/user-config () ;; Define the TODO states and their respective colors (setq org-todo-keywords '((sequence \\"TODO(t)\\" \\"IN-PROGRESS(i)\\" \\"|\\" \\"DONE(d)\\"))) (setq org-todo-keyword-faces '((\\"TODO\\" . (:foreground \\"red\\" :weight bold)) (\\"IN-PROGRESS\\" . (:foreground \\"blue\\" :weight bold)) (\\"DONE\\" . (:foreground \\"green\\" :weight bold)))) ;; ... ) \`\`\` 4. Save the configuration file and restart Spacemacs to apply the changes. 5. Now, when you view your \`TODO\` items in Org mode, you should see the keywords highlighted with the colors you configured. Remember to adapt the specific keywords and colors to fit your preference. Please note that configurations in Spacemacs (and Emacs in general) can change over time. If you find these instructions do not work with the version of Spacemacs you are using, consult the documentation available at the time for any updated methods of configuring Org mode and its appearance for \`TODO\` states."},{"instruction":"The role is Fashion Showroom Wholesale Manager in APAC region, How to do a seasonal sales planning and forecast, and the sales management report Help to rephrase the content and make into oral speaking English","output":"The position I am referring to is the Fashion Showroom Wholesale Manager in the APAC region.

Przedyskutować w niej należałoby kwestie takie jak proroctwa, nieuchronność przeznaczenia, a także wybory moralne i działania podejmowane przez głównych bohaterów w obliczu rzeczywistych lub postrzeganych ograniczeń nakładanych przez bogów i społeczeństwo. 2. Konflikt indywidualnych przekonań z prawem państwowym w \\"Antygonie\\" Sofoklesa. Ta rozprawka mogłaby badać napięcie między osobistymi zasadami a obowiązującymi prawami państwowymi, z jakim mierzy się Antygona – postać, która decyduje się na pogrzebanie swojego brata Polinejkesa wbrew edyktowi króla Kreona. Punktem analizy byłby wpływ moralności, etyki i rodziny na decyzje jednostki, jak również konsekwencje konfrontacji jednostkowych wartości z oficjalnymi zasadami prawa. Rozprawka ta mogłaby również dotykać sposobu, w jaki tragedia odzwierciedla większe społeczne i polityczne zagadnienia, takie jak poszanowanie tradycji i obrzędów religijnych wobec racji stanu i stabilności społecznej."},{"instruction":"napisz mi podobne struktury do czy blad ludzki jest wpisany w ludzkie zycie","output":"1.

Jednym z kluczowych i ponadczasowych wątków, jaki wyłania się z obu tych dzieł, jest konflikt między prawem boskim a prawem ludzkim. Niniejsza rozprawka ma na celu przyjrzeć się genezie oraz skutkom tego konfliktu w obu tragediach, podkreślając, w jaki sposób postacie zmagają się z dylematem posłuszeństwa wobec niepisanych praw boskich w kontekście ustanowionych, pisanych praw ludzkich. Rozwinięcie: W \\"Królu Edypie” natrafiamy na Edypa, króla Teb, ozdobionego chwałą wyzwoliciela miasta, który jednak, nieswiadomie, staje się ofiarą straszliwego proroctwa. Jego historia jest przykładem na to, jak prawo boskie nieubłaganie wkracza w sferę życia ludzkiego. Proroctwo wygłoszone przez wyrocznię w Delfach, według którego Edyp ma zabić własnego ojca i poślubić własną matkę, wypełnia się mimo jego nieświadomych prób ucieczki od przeznaczenia. Konflikt prawa boskiego i ludzkiego w \\"Królu Edypie\\" odnosi się do walki bohatera z pozornie nieuchronnym losiem, będącym wyrokiem wyższych sił, które przeznaczenie nakazały jeszcze przed jego narodzinami. Z kolei w „Antygonie” mierzymy się z postacią tytułowej bohaterki, która znajduje się w bezpośredniej konfrontacji z ustanowionym przez człowieka prawem. Antygona, idąc za głosem sumienia i przekonań, postanawia pochować ciało swojego brata Polinejkesa, łamiąc tym samym edykt Kreona, który zabraniał obrzędów pogrzebowych dla uznanych za zdrajców. W tym przypadku prawa boskie, które każą czcić zmarłych i zapewnić im godny pogrzeb, kolidują z prawem stanowionym przez Kreona jako suwerennego władcy. Antygona stoi tu jako symbol odwagi i nieugiętości wobec prawa boskiego, które dla niej jest fundamentem sprawiedliwości wyższej niż królewskie dekrety. Obie historie poruszają zatem odwieczny dylemat moralny człowieka: czy należy przestrzegać praw stanowionych przez ludzi, czy też kierować się nieskodyfikowanymi, lecz uznawanymi za niewzruszone zasadami moralnymi, które wywodzą się z sfery boskiej. Zakończenie: Analiza konfliktu między prawem boskim a ludzkim w tragediach Sofoklesa ujawnia uniwersalny problem moralny, z którym ludzkość zmaga się od zarania dziejów. \\"Król Edyp\\" pokazuje władzę losu wyznaczonego przez bogów nad życiem człowieka, podczas gdy \\"Antygona\\" koncentruje się na świadomym wyborze jednostki idącej za głosem wyższych wartości moralnych w defensywie przed bezwzględnym prawem człowieka. Obydwa dramaty stanowią potężne przypomnienie o napięciu pomiędzy niezmiennymi prawami natury, sumienia i boskości a zmiennym, ludzkim porządkiem prawnym, a ich przesłanie pozostaje aktualne nawet w dzisiejszych czasach. Od wieków temat ten inspirował i będzie nadal inspirować głębokie rozważania na temat moralnych fundamentów ludzkiego życia i cywilizacji."},{"instruction":"Czy nieomylny jest człowiek? To ponadczasowa kwestia która wiele razy ukazuje się w literaturze jak i w codziennej egzystencji każdego z nas. Z perspektywy dzieł literackich, jak i doświadczenia życiowego człowieka wiemy, że błędy są nieodłącznym elementem egzystencji ludzi. Przykłady z literatury antycznej jak ,,Antygona\\" i ,,Król Edyp\\" Sofoklesa wyraźnie na to wskazują. Ocen wstep do rozpraki Czy nieomylny jest człowiek?","output":"Wstęp do rozprawki na temat błędów ludzkich i ich roli w ludzkim życiu, odnoszący się do dzieł Sofoklesa \\"Antygona\\" i \\"Król Edyp\\", jest skonstruowany w sposób kompetentny. Zaprasza do refleksji nad uniwersalnym zagadnieniem fallibilności ludzkiej, które jest tak samo aktualne dzisiaj jak w czasach antycznych. Rozpoczyna od ogólnego postawienia pytania o nieomylność człowieka, poruszając tym samym ciekawość czytelnika i budując dobrą podstawę do dalszego rozważania tematu. Następnie wstęp łączy temat z literaturą klasyczną, wykorzystując dwa dzieła Sofoklesa jako fundament do analizy. Ten zabieg pozwala nie tylko na pogłębienie dyskusji przez pryzmat literatury antycznej, ale również daje okazję do ukazania, jak prastare tematy odnajdują odzwierciedlenie w uniwersalnych doświadczeniach ludzkich. Wstęp zawiera również tezę sugerującą, iż błędy są nieodłącznym elementem ludzkiego bytu, co zostanie zapewne rozwinięte i poparte argumentami w dalszej części rozprawki. Zachęca to czytelnika do kontemplacji nad własnymi doświadczeniami i zapewnia płynne przejście do głębszej analizy problemu. Jedyny obszar, który mógłby być lekko udoskonalony, to może bardziej bezpośrednie wprowadzenie do konkretnych sytuacji i przykładów z wymienionych tragedii, które ilustrują tezę. Pozwoliłoby to na jeszcze lepsze zaznajomienie czytelnika z kierunkiem rozważań i stanowiłoby bardziej przekonujące wprowadzenie do analizy, którą autor ma zamiar przeprowadzić.

Wstęp: Istotną kwestią, którą porusza zarówno tragedia \\"Król Edyp\\" jak i \\"Antygona\\" Sofoklesa, jest problematyka władzy i związanej z nią odpowiedzialności. Postaci tytułowe obu dramatów stają w obliczu skomplikowanych decyzji, które nie tylko wpływają na ich własne życie, ale i determinują losy całych wspólnot. Poprzez pryzmat tych dwóch dzieł literackich możemy zastanowić się nad wagą indywidualnych wyborów moralnych w kontekście społecznym i politycznym, a także nad konsekwencjami, które pociągają za sobą działania podjęte w obszarze publicznym i prywatnym. W obliczu wyzwań i ograniczeń, przed jakimi stają bohaterowie tych tragedii, nasuwa się pytanie: jak władza i osobista odpowiedzialność wpływają na kształtowanie się ludzkiego charakteru i przeznaczenia? W niniejszej rozprawce spróbujemy odpowiedzieć na to pytanie, analizując dylematy moralne Edypa i Antygony oraz ich wpływ na postrzeganie liderów i ich dziedzictwo w społecznościach, którymi kierują. Ocena wstępu: Prezentowany wstęp skutecznie wprowadza czytelnika w główną tematykę rozprawki, wskazując na złożone zagadnienie władzy i odpowiedzialności. Wstępny zarys problemu wyborów moralnych postaci w kontekście wpływu na społeczeństwo zachęca do refleksji nad uniwersalnymi dylematami etycznymi i ich konsekwencjami. Wstęp w klarowny sposób deklaruje zamiar zbadania, w jaki sposób tytułowe postaci dwóch tragedii Sofoklesa radzą sobie z obowiązkami wynikającymi z zajmowanych pozycji oraz jak ich indywidualne decyzje wyznaczają kierunek dla społeczności, które reprezentują. Rozważanie to ma potencjał, aby ukazać bogactwo tematyczne tragedii antycznych i ich współczesną aktualność. Oceniając wstęp pozytywnie, można by jednak zasugerować szczegółowe wprowadzenie konkretnych scen lub wydarzeń z tragedii, które zostaną poddane analizie, co umożliwiłoby czytelnikowi lepsze przygotowanie na nadchodzące argumenty i rozważania. Ponadto wzmianka o konkretnych wyzwaniach moralnych czy sytuacjach decyzyjnych, przed jakimi stają Edyp i Antygona, mogłaby jeszcze bardziej zintensyfikować zainteresowanie tematem i zachęcić do zgłębienia rozważań nad kształtowaniem ludzkich losów poprzez osobiste wybory.

At that time, her grandfather had said that Ye Xue was her brother's fiancée, and she thought that a pair of earrings would be suitable for Ye Xue, so she bought them. Later, when she fell ill, her brother's fiancée became Ye Ning again, so she bought a necklace again. As for those earrings, she gave them to Li Sao. Ye Ning opened the box and found a diamond necklace inside. The style was the latest, but the diamonds were small, worth about 10,000 yuan. Ye Ning smiled, \\"It's very beautiful, I really like it, thank you.\\" The Bo family was wealthy, so Bo Hanyun never had to worry about food and drink, but when it came to money, her family would not give her too much. Yet, Bo Hanyun still used her New Year's money to buy a necklace worth 10,000 yuan for Ye Ning, and it would be false to say that Ye Ning was not moved. Ye Ning did not refuse and put the box away, saying to Bo Hanyun, \\"I accept your gift, and I will also give you one another day. What do you like?\\" Bo Hanyun shook her head, \\"Sister Ye, the best gift you have given me is curing my illness. I don't know how to thank you. I don't need you to give me presents.\\" After a pause, Bo Hanyun said, \\"But there is really something I need your help with!\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"It's... \\" Bo Hanyun glanced carefully at Bo Hanian and whispered, \\"Brother wants to send me back to the capital. I don't want to go back. I want to stay here and play with you, Sister Ye, can you help me persuade my brother?\\" Ye Ning looked at Bo Hanian and asked, \\"Why don't you let Xiaoyun stay in Rongcheng?\\" \\"I have some matters to attend to, and it is not convenient for Xiaoyun to stay here,\\" replied Bo Hanian. \\"Oh.\\" Ye Ning did not want to get involved in Bo Hanian's affairs and wanted to persuade Bo Hanyun to go back. However, Bo Hanyun looked at her with a pitiful expression. So she said, \\"If Xiaoyun wants to stay, let her stay. I quite like her.\\" \\"Xiao Ning!\\" Bo Hanian furrowed his brows. \\"Some things are dangerous.\\" Bo Hanian's words were not clear enough, but Ye Ning understood. She reluctantly said to Bo Hanyun, \\"Xiaoyun, be a good girl and listen to your brother. Go back first, and I will visit you when I have time.\\" After weighing the pros and cons, she still stuck to her position. She didn't know what Bo Hanian was up to, but she thought about the day he was chased and attacked at Qingfeng Mountain. It was definitely not safe for Bo Hanyun to stay with him. \\"Sister, if I go back, no one will care about me,\\" pleaded Bo Hanyun. \\"Actually, I wanted to attend your engagement banquet. Moreover, Grandfather is in Rongcheng, but my brother is biased and won't let Grandfather go back, so he should let me go back.\\" \\"But I... I am very pitiful. I don't have any friends to play with in the capital. I always stay in my room by myself. Sister, it was so hard for me to recover from my illness, and I want to be happy...\\" Bo Hanyun's tears flowed as she acted like a spoiled child. When she cried, Ye Ning's heart instantly melted. She said to Bo Hanian, \\"Well then, let her stay? She can come to live at my place!\\" \\"Good!\\" \\"Good!\\" Two voices sounded at the same time. One was from Bo Hanian. The other was from Bo Hanyun. They agreed so readily that Ye Ning felt she was being taken advantage of. After giving them a glare, she turned and went back to her room. The siblings were cunning and unscrupulous, not a single one of them was good. Chapter 60: Ye Ning Must Be Expelled Ye Family. After returning home from school, Ye Xue went straight to her room, without even having dinner. It's not that she didn't want to eat, she just had no appetite. Every time she thought about Ye Ning becoming the homeroom teacher of Class 18 through the back door, she felt extremely uncomfortable. Why should that girl, who knows nothing, be able to become a teacher? If that's the case, with her talent, she could also become a teacher. But that's not what she wanted. She wanted to enter Peking University based on her own abilities and step by step reach the top of society. A knock on the door was heard from outside, followed by the nanny's voice saying, \\"Miss Ye Xue, Madam Yuan is here. Madam would like to see you downstairs.\\" Ye Xue couldn't help feeling uncomfortable when she heard the term \\"Miss Ye Xue\\". Before Ye Ning came back, she was the eldest young miss of the Ye family. But after Ye Ning returned, even though she didn't live in the old mansion, everyone started calling her \\"Miss Ye Xue\\", as if reminding her that she was an adopted child. Ye Xue suppressed her thoughts, got up and opened the door, and went downstairs. When she saw the person sitting on the sofa in the living room downstairs, Ye Xue was momentarily stunned. It was Zhao Jingru! She married into the Yuan family, and everyone outside referred to her as Madam Yuan. Last time at Aunt Er's banquet, she asked for Ye Ning's help in treating her daughter's illness, but she hadn't come back since then. Ye Xue thought that the incident at the banquet had spread, and Zhao Jingru had changed her mind and wanted Ye Ning to treat her daughter's illness. Thinking of the banquet, Ye Xue's hatred for Ye Ning grew stronger. Ever since Ye Xianghua was exposed for having an affair with the nanny, Aunt Er had insisted on divorcing Ye Xianghua. Ye Xianghua, of course, refused. As a result, the two families had been quarreling for days and"},{"instruction":"Salut tu parles français","output":"Bonjour ! Oui, je parle français.

Modifier les fonctions \`GetLastFileNumber\` et \`UpdateDocumentProperties\` pour réellement interagir avec les propriétés personnalisées du document. Voici comment vous pourriez modifier le code : \`\`\`vba Option Explicit Private Const CustomPropertyName As String = \\"CustomLastNum\\" Private Sub Document_Open() ' Initialiser le numéro de fichier lastNum = GetLastFileNumber() End Sub Private Sub Document_Close() ' Mettre à jour la propriété personnalisée avec le dernier numéro UpdateDocumentProperties lastNum End Sub ' Le reste de votre code reste inchangé. Private Function GetLastFileNumber() As Integer ' Récupérer le dernier numéro de fichier de la propriété personnalisée On Error Resume Next Dim prop As DocumentProperty Set prop = ThisDocument.CustomDocumentProperties(CustomPropertyName) If prop Is Nothing Then ' La propriété n'existe pas, créer avec valeur 0 ThisDocument.CustomDocumentProperties.Add _ Name:=CustomPropertyName, LinkToContent:=False, Value:=0, _ Type:=msoPropertyTypeNumber GetLastFileNumber = 0 Else ' La propriété existe, récupérer la valeur GetLastFileNumber = prop.Value End If On Error GoTo 0 End Function Private Sub UpdateDocumentProperties(ByVal num As Integer) ' Mettre à jour la propriété personnalisée avec le dernier numéro On Error Resume Next Dim prop As DocumentProperty Set prop = ThisDocument.CustomDocumentProperties(CustomPropertyName) If Not prop Is Nothing Then prop.Value = num End If On Error GoTo 0 End Sub \`\`\` Les principales modifications ci-dessus comprennent l'ajout d'une constante pour le nom de la propriété personnalisée, la création ou la récupération de cette propriété dans \`GetLastFileNumber\`, et la mise à jour de la valeur de la propriété dans \`UpdateDocumentProperties\`. Veuillez noter que cette modification enregistre la valeur de \`lastNum\` dans une propriété personnalisée du document Word, ce qui signifie que la valeur sera persistante entre les ouvertures de documents. Assurez-vous également que les macros soient activées pour que le code fonctionne correctement."},{"instruction":"ça me dis variable non défini sur “CustomLastNum”","output":"L'erreur \\"variable non définie\\" sur \`CustomLastNum\` suggère que le compilateur VBA ne reconnaît pas cette constante car elle n'a pas été déclarée correctement ou n'est pas visible là où elle est utilisée.

Pour dépanner cela, nous aurons besoin de vérifier chaque étape du processus pour nous assurer que les bonnes valeurs sont lues et écrites. Voici une liste de contrôle de dépannage : 1. **Activer les erreurs de Runtime en VBA** : Cela peut aider à identifier où les choses ne vont pas. Retirez temporairement les lignes \`On Error Resume Next\` pour voir si des erreurs s'affichent. 2. **Vérifier la liaison du bouton** : Assurez-vous que le bouton dans Word est correctement relié à l’événement \`BtnGenererNumeroFichier_Click\`. Si vous n'utilisez pas un contrôle ActiveX dans un document, mais une commande ou un bouton dans le ruban, assurez-vous que la macro est correctement assignée. 3. **Examiner la sauvegarde des valeurs** : Assurez-vous que \`ThisDocument\` se réfère au bon document et que le document est bien sauvegardé après la modification des propriétés personnalisées. Si \`ThisDocument\` est utilisé dans un modèle (dotm), cela n'aura pas l'effet souhaité sur un document basé sur ce modèle. 4. **Réinitialisation appropriée de lastNum**: Assurez-vous que \`lastNum\` ne se réinitialise à 1 que si la date a vraiment changé. Pour cela, vérifiez la valeur de \`lastDate\` après ouverture du document et avant génération d'un nouveau numéro. 5. **Tester manuellement les fonctions**: Testez les fonctions \`GetLastFileNumber\` et \`GetLastFileDate\` séparément dans le \\"Immediate Window\\" (fenêtre immédiate) de l’éditeur VBA pour voir si elles retournent les bonnes valeurs. 6. **Le type de document**: Assurez-vous que vous travaillez sur un document \`.docm\` (Document Word prenant en charge les macros) et non un \`.docx\` ou \`.dotx\` qui ne permettent pas l’exécution des macros. 7. **Droits de sauvegarde**: Confirmez que vous avez les droits nécessaires pour sauvegarder les modifications sur le document. Si le document est en lecture seule ou si vous avez ouvert une instance de document qui ne permet pas la sauvegarde, les propriétés personnalisées ne seront pas persistantes. 8. **Réviser le code d'incrémentation**: Vérifiez la logique d'incrémentation dans \`BtnGenererNumeroFichier_Click\` pour vous assurer qu’elle répond aux conditions attendues et que \`lastNum\` est bien incrémenté. Si le problème persiste après ces vérifications et que vous ne voyez toujours pas d'erreur, il pourrait être utile d'utiliser des messages de débogage (\`MsgBox\`) ou de tracer le code en utilisant les outils de débogage dans l'éditeur VBA (\`Debug.Print\` dans l'immédiate window) pour suivre quelle valeur est assignée à chaque variable à chaque étape du processus.

Ceci est souvent réalisé en utilisant des technologies Web et des bibliothèques qui gèrent la création et la manipulation de PDF. Voici une idée générale de comment vous pourriez procéder : 1. **Créer un formulaire HTML**: Concevez un formulaire Web qui recueille les informations nécessaires pour le rapport. Utilisez des champs de saisie, des zones de texte, des cases à cocher, etc. 2. **Stocker les entrées de formulaire**: Lorsque le formulaire est soumis, vous pouvez stocker les entrées dans une base de données ou les passer directement à un script de génération de PDF. 3. **Générer un PDF**: Utilisez une bibliothèque côté serveur pour créer un PDF. Il existe plusieurs bibliothèques en différents langages de programmation: - PHP: TCPDF, mPDF, ou FPDF. - JavaScript/Node.js: Puppeteer, jsPDF, ou PDFKit. - Python: ReportLab, WeasyPrint, ou xhtml2pdf. 4. **Mettre en forme le PDF**: Simulez la mise en page de votre document Word en HTML et CSS qui seront utilisés pour le formatage PDF. Les bibliothèques PDF vous permettent souvent de définir la mise en page et de styliser le contenu comme un document Word. 5. **Gérer la logique d'attribution des numéros de rapport**: Écrivez le code pour reproduire la logique de génération des numéros de rapport (REP-YYYYMMDD-XXX) côté serveur. Cela peut être géré par le script qui génère le PDF en fonction de la date actuelle et du dernier numéro de rapport stocké. 6. **Envoi du PDF à l'utilisateur**: Une fois le PDF généré, il peut être envoyé au navigateur pour téléchargement ou affichage direct, ou stocké sur le serveur pour une récupération ultérieure. 7. **Sécurité**: Assurez-vous de traiter la sécurité des données, notamment la validation des entrées côté serveur pour éviter l'injection SQL si vous utilisez une base de données, et prenez en compte les bonnes pratiques de sécurité pour les applications Web. Techniquement, la partie la plus compliquée est la génération de PDF en accord avec la mise en forme de votre document Word d'origine, mais avec les bons outils et un peu de travail sur le CSS pour le style du PDF, vous pouvez obtenir des résultats très proches de votre modèle Word. S'il s'agit d'un projet pour votre entreprise ou pour une utilisation professionnelle, considérez également l'utilisation de plateformes comme Adobe Document Services ou d'autres services d'API qui permettent la génération de PDF via le Web. Des solutions comme Google Docs API pourraient également être envisagées pour générer et exporter des documents dans différents formats."},{"instruction":"dear engr. please send your email to contrition person im Afroz Alam Building Dept. thanks","output":"Dear Engr., Thank you for your message.

One such niche is survivalism, where countless content creators claim to offer indispensable skills and knowledge to thrive in adverse situations. Nevertheless, among the genuine survivalists, a disturbing trend has emerged - fake survivalists seeking to exploit the public's fascination with the subject. This essay delves into the importance of unmasking these frauds and highlights the potential consequences they may inflict upon their unsuspecting audience. Body: 1. Misleading Information: Fake survivalist YouTubers often present themselves as experts, intricately explaining the art of survival. However, their videos are filled with inaccurate information, creating a misguided understanding of what it takes to truly survive in the wild. These individuals fabricate scenarios and perform staged survival acts, fooling vulnerable viewers seeking genuine knowledge and advice. Unmasking them is vital to prevent the perpetuation of misleading and potentially dangerous teachings. 2. Safety Concerns: Surviving in challenging environments requires adequate knowledge, skill, and preparation. By following the guidance of fake survivalists, viewers may adopt incorrect techniques that jeopardize their safety in real-life survival situations. Unmasking these charlatans is crucial to safeguard the well-being of those who might unknowingly trust and emulate their practices. 3. Preserving the Reputation: The survivalist community should strive to uphold its credibility. Fake survivalists not only devalue the expertise of genuine professionals but also tarnish the reputation of the community as a whole. Unmasking these frauds plays a pivotal role in preserving the integrity and authenticity of the survivalist world. Conclusion: While YouTube has provided an incredible platform for sharing knowledge and expertise, it has also attracted individuals preying on the public's fascination with survivalism. The exposure of fake survivalists is essential to counter the dissemination of incorrect information, ensure the safety of viewers, and preserve the reputation and legitimacy of true survival experts. Society must remain vigilant in unmasking these pretenders to perpetuate factual, reliable, and valuable content in the survivalist space. Only through such efforts can we truly foster a community that embraces the essence of survivalism - a discipline built on trust, integrity, and preparation for life's most challenging situations."},{"instruction":"Write text about scientific fictional star system, it has six planets and distant companion.

As we explore this intriguing system, we encounter the first planet, Aiyethea. This rocky world is enveloped in a stunning tapestry of iron oxide, giving it a striking reddish appearance. Aiyethea is a desolate landscape, devoid of life, yet it enthralls scientists with its captivating geology and ancient formations. Continuing our journey, we come across Cinloron, the second planet in this enigmatic star system. Covered in shades of gray, this rocky planet exudes a mysterious aura. Its surface is marred by deep canyons and towering mountains, hinting at a tumultuous past whose secrets remain hidden. The third planet, I'Zykija, is a terrestrial world that harbors a thriving ecosystem teeming with life.

Ye Xianghua, of course, would not agree, resulting in several days of quarrel between the two families, which has yet to be resolved. The old lady, of course, looks down upon the nanny and immediately kicked her out. However, Ye Xianghua remains stubborn, not only wanting to keep the nanny but also refusing to divorce Second Aunt, which is quite infuriating. And that's not all, Ye Xianghua even directs her anger at her, accusing her of not handling things properly and having her dismissed. \\"Miss Ye!\\" Upon seeing Ye Xue coming downstairs, she quickly stood up, with a apologetic expression, and said, \\"I apologize, I said last time I would bring my daughter to see you, but my daughter was deeply affected after the car accident. I advised her for a long time, but she refuses to go out.\\" Zhao Jingru looked helpless, \\"I came here today to trouble Miss Ye, could you come to my house and have a look at my daughter's illness?\\" Ye Xue was puzzled. Didn't the news of Ye Ning's recovery from illness spread? \\"Don't worry, I won't let you treat my daughter for free. I will pay you for your services.\\" \\"Aunt Zhao, no need for such formality. Zhao Grandma and my Grandma are friends, we are all family, no need to discuss payment.\\" Ye Xue smiled and said, \\"I will go with Aunt Zhao to see Miss Yuan.\\" Zhao Jingru breathed a sigh of relief. \\"Thank you so much!\\" After a pause, she asked, \\"When would be convenient for you?\\" She was very anxious! Especially anxious! Because of her daughter's illness, she couldn't sleep every day. Especially since her daughter had dropped out of school for half a year, showing no interest in studying during this time. With the college entrance examination approaching, she didn't know what to do if her daughter continued like this in the future. Thinking for a moment, Ye Xue said, \\"How about this weekend? As you know, the college entrance examination is coming soon, and academics are crucial.\\" The key is that Professor Cheng's team is coming tomorrow, and she needs to prepare well. She must gain Professor Cheng's recognition. If she could be valued by Professor Cheng and receive personal guidance from him, she would have a solid chance of becoming the top scholar in Rongcheng this year. \\"That's natural, prioritizing learning.\\" Zhao Jingru smiled and said, \\"Miss Ye truly lives up to her reputation as Rongcheng's talented woman, so outstanding and hardworking. Your future is boundless.\\" \\"Aunt Zhao, you flatter me.\\" Ye Xue's smile faded. She had heard such compliments too many times and had long become immune to them. After confirming the time, Zhao Jingru didn't stay long and left. After she left, Grandma Ye asked Ye Xue, \\"Xiaoxue, are you confident in treating Miss Yuan's illness?\\" The Zhao family has status and position in Rongcheng, and Zhao Jingru married into the Yuan family in Beijing. Grandma Ye didn't want any mishaps. \\"I need to see the person first to be sure.\\" Ye Xue pursed her lips and said, \\"But it should not be a problem. Miss Yuan was disfigured in a car accident, and Dr. Song has treated similar patients before and taught me.\\" In fact, she had seen Dr. Song treat similar cases, but he didn't teach her. She was just an outsider, only learning the basics. Only Dr. Song's true disciples could receive his genuine teachings. But treating Miss Yuan's illness was her opportunity. As long as she cured Miss Yuan, her reputation would grow and she would gain support from Mrs. Yuan in the future. \\"That's good!\\" Grandma Ye said with emphasis, \\"Xiaoxue, this matter must be handled with extreme caution. We cannot afford to offend the Yuan family in Beijing.\\" \\"I understand, Grandma.\\" The next day. Yunyang High School. At 7:30 in the morning, Ye Ning arrived at school and headed straight to her office. Her office was separate from the other teachers. School starts at 8 o'clock, and morning reading begins at 7:30. On the way to her office, she had to pass by the principal's office. She had just reached the principal's office when she heard a commotion inside. She had planned to just keep walking, but when she heard her name being mentioned, she stopped. \\"Principal Ge, no matter what, you must dismiss Ye Ning today. We cannot accept a teacher who entered through the back door like her.\\" \\"Yes, if Ye Ning is not expelled, we will all withdraw from the school. It's up to you, Principal Ge!\\" \\"I really don't understand what you are thinking, Principal. Ye Ning grew up in the countryside without receiving any education. It was only recently that she was brought back to the Ye family. There are rumors about her relationship with that young master from the Bo family, and this kind of person is allowed to be a teacher? How can our children bear it?\\" \\"Not only is she unclear with the young master from the Bo family, I heard she is a thief. It's just that the Ye family covered it up. A person with such a bad reputation has no qualifications to be a teacher.\\" Principal Ge had just arrived at the school and was immediately blocked in his office by a group of parents. Each person's sentence gave him a headache. Especially when he heard these people disparaging Ye Ning, he became furious. They claimed to have moral cultivation and good character, but they were just spreading rumors and had such malicious intentions towards a girl. It was truly despicable. \\"Teacher Ye was specifically hired as the head teacher for Class 18. She does not teach any other classes, and I have already communicated with the parents of Class 18, who have no objections. Please don't cause trouble for no reason.\\""},{"instruction":"Causes and effects of financial crisis","output":"There are several potential causes and effects of financial crises: Causes: 1. Asset price bubbles: When the prices of assets, such as housing or stocks, rise rapidly and then collapse, it can lead to a financial crisis. This can occur when investors engage in speculative behavior and the value of these assets becomes detached from their underlying fundamentals. 2. Excessive risk-taking and leverage: If financial institutions take on excessive levels of debt and engage in risky investment practices, it can exacerbate the potential for a financial crisis. This can happen when institutions rely heavily on short-term borrowing to fund long-term investments, creating a vulnerability to market shocks or sudden loss of confidence in their ability to repay debts. 3. Financial market failures: Failures in the functioning of financial markets, such as insufficient regulation or inadequate oversight, can contribute to the occurrence of a financial crisis. This can allow for the accumulation of risky financial products or the dissemination of inaccurate information, leading to a loss of confidence in the system. Effects: 1. Economic recession: Financial crises often lead to a contraction in economic activity, as businesses face difficulties accessing credit and consumers reduce their spending. This can result in job losses, declining incomes, and reductions in living standards. 2. Bank failures and financial institution collapse: In a financial crisis, banks and financial institutions may incur substantial losses, leading to insolvency and, in some cases, bankruptcy. This can disrupt the flow of credit and investment into the economy, creating further economic instability. 3. Government interventions and bailouts: During financial crises, governments may need to intervene to stabilize the financial system and prevent it from collapsing. This can involve injecting funds into struggling financial institutions, guaranteeing deposits, or implementing regulatory reforms to restore confidence and stability. 4. Deterioration of public finances: Financial crises can have a significant impact on government finances. Increased government spending on bailouts and economic stimulus measures, coupled with reduced tax revenues due to the economic downturn, can lead to higher levels of public debt and fiscal deficits. 5. Global contagion: Financial crises can have a contagious effect, spreading across national borders and affecting the global economy. This can happen through the interconnectedness of financial markets and the cross-border exposure of institutions. The global financial crisis of 2008, for example, originated in the United States but quickly spread to other countries, causing a widespread recession."},{"instruction":"List 3 causes of the financial crisis and 3 effects, each effect should correspond with one cause","output":"Causes of the financial crisis: 1. Housing market bubble: - Effect: Collapse in home prices and surge in mortgage defaults. 2. Financial institution leverage and risk-taking: - Effect: Bank failures and widespread credit freeze, limiting businesses' access to capital for investments and operating expenses. 3. Inadequate regulation and oversight: - Effect: Loss of investor confidence and increased uncertainty, leading to a sharp decline in stock prices and the collapse of financial institutions. Effects of the financial crisis: 1. Economic recession: - Cause: Collapse in home prices and credit freeze. - Effect: Rising unemployment, declining consumer spending, and reduced economic growth. 2. Government intervention and bailouts: - Cause: Financial institution failures and credit freeze. - Effect: Increased public debt and fiscal deficits, as governments inject funds to stabilize the financial system and prevent further economic contraction. 3. Global contagion: - Cause: Interconnectedness of financial markets and cross-border exposure. - Effect: Spread of the financial crisis across countries and regions, leading to a global recession and prolonged economic recovery."},{"instruction":"Solutions related with economics and mathematics to the housing market bubbles","output":"Solutions related to economics and mathematics that can help address housing market bubbles include: 1. Strengthening regulations and oversight: - Implement stricter lending standards and regulations on mortgage lending to prevent excessive borrowing and risky lending practices. - Enhance monitoring and enforcement of financial institutions to detect and prevent speculative behavior and market manipulation. - Increase transparency in the housing market, ensuring accurate and timely information on property values, mortgage terms, and risks. 2. Implementing macroprudential policies: - Use tools such as loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-income ratios, and stress tests to limit the amount of leverage and borrowing in the housing market, reducing the risk of a bubble forming. - Implement measures to counteract speculative investment, such as higher property taxes on short-term property flipping or restrictions on foreign buyers. 3. Improving risk assessment models and stress testing: - Develop sophisticated mathematical models and algorithms to assess and predict risks in the housing market. - Conduct rigorous stress tests that simulate potential economic downturns or shocks to evaluate the resilience of the housing market and financial institutions. 4. Promoting financial education and consumer protection: - Educate potential homebuyers on the risks and potential pitfalls of the housing market, including the dangers of excessive borrowing and overleveraging. - Ensure adequate consumer protection regulations to prevent predatory lending practices and deceptive marketing tactics. 5. Encouraging housing market diversification: - Promote the development of a diverse range of housing options, including affordable housing, to reduce the reliance on a single segment of the market and mitigate the impact of price fluctuations. - Encourage the construction of rental properties to provide alternatives to homeownership and reduce the pressure on housing prices. 6. Enhancing data analytics and monitoring systems: - Utilize advanced data analytics and monitoring systems to detect early warning signs of a housing bubble, such as rapid price increases, excessive borrowing, or speculative behavior. - Establish effective reporting mechanisms to collect and analyze timely and accurate data on housing market trends, enabling policymakers to take timely intervention measures when necessary. It's important to note that while these solutions can help mitigate the risks and impacts of housing market bubbles, no system is foolproof, and ongoing monitoring and adaptation of policies are necessary to address the dynamic nature of housing markets."},{"instruction":"How does the solution of Improving risk assessment models and stress testing address housing market bubbles","output":"Improving risk assessment models and stress testing can help address housing market bubbles in several ways: 1. Detection of vulnerabilities: Risk assessment models can analyze various factors, such as housing market indicators, lending practices, and borrower characteristics, to identify potential vulnerabilities in the housing market. By incorporating historical data, economic indicators, and mathematical algorithms, these models can detect early warning signs of a housing market bubble forming. 2. Evaluation of potential risks: Stress testing involves subjecting financial institutions, borrowers, and the housing market as a whole to hypothetical scenarios, such as a sharp decline in housing prices or an economic recession. By modeling and analyzing these scenarios, stress tests can assess the resilience of the housing market and financial system to such shocks. This helps identify potential weaknesses and areas of risk, allowing policymakers to take appropriate preventive measures. 3. Mitigation of excessive risk-taking: Risk assessment models and stress tests can inform regulators and policymakers about the level of risk-taking by financial institutions and borrowers. By measuring factors such as loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-income ratios, and creditworthiness, stress tests can indicate if lending practices are becoming excessively risky. This information can prompt policymakers to implement measures, such as tightening lending standards or increasing capital requirements, to curb excessive risk-taking and prevent a housing market bubble from forming. 4. Improved risk management: Risk assessment models and stress testing can aid financial institutions in improving their risk management practices related to housing market exposures. By accurately assessing the potential losses under adverse scenarios, these models help institutions identify and manage risks associated with mortgage portfolios and other housing-related assets. This can lead to more prudent risk management, reducing the potential impact of a housing market bubble on financial institutions and the overall economy. 5. Enhancing transparency and investor confidence: Robust risk assessment models and stress tests can enhance transparency in the housing market and increase investor confidence. By providing accurate and reliable information about the risks and vulnerabilities of the market, these models help investors make informed decisions and avoid excessive speculation. This can contribute to the stability of the housing market and reduce the likelihood of a bubble forming. In summary, improving risk assessment models and stress testing provides tools to detect vulnerabilities, evaluate potential risks, mitigate excessive risk-taking, improve risk management practices, and enhance transparency. These measures collectively contribute to addressing housing market bubbles by identifying and managing risks before they escalate and lead to a crisis."},{"instruction":"Benefits and limitations of the first solution","output":"The first solution of strengthening regulations and oversight to address housing market bubbles has several benefits and limitations: Benefits: 1. Prevention of excessive risk-taking: Tighter regulations on mortgage lending and stricter lending standards can help prevent borrowers from taking on excessive debt and participating in risky practices. This can reduce the likelihood of a housing market bubble forming in the first place. 2. Enhanced market stability: By implementing regulations and oversight measures, the housing market can become more stable and less susceptible to volatile price fluctuations. This stability can provide a safer environment for homeowners, investors, and financial institutions, promoting long-term growth and sustainability. 3. Consumer protection: Strengthened regulations can provide greater protection for consumers, ensuring they are provided with accurate information about mortgage terms, risks, and costs. This can prevent predatory lending practices, mitigate the risk of borrowers taking on unaffordable loans, and reduce financial hardships for homeowners. 4. Increased confidence in the financial system: Effective oversight and regulation can improve transparency and accountability within the housing market and financial institutions. This can restore investor and consumer confidence, enhancing trust in the financial system and reducing the likelihood of panic and instability during times of potential crisis. Limitations: 1. Regulatory challenges and loopholes: The effectiveness of regulations can be limited by challenges in enforcement, compliance, and the emergence of new loopholes that allow for risky behavior. Regulatory bodies must have sufficient resources and expertise to continuously adapt and respond to evolving market conditions. 2. Balancing stability and access to credit: Stricter regulations may unintentionally limit access to credit for some potential homebuyers. While the intention is to prevent excessive risk-taking, it is crucial to strike a balance between stability and ensuring that credit is available to creditworthy borrowers who can responsibly manage their mortgage obligations. 3. Potential impact on housing market affordability: Stricter regulations can result in higher compliance costs for financial institutions, which may be passed on to borrowers in the form of higher mortgage rates or reduced availability of certain loan products. This could exacerbate housing affordability challenges, making it more difficult for certain segments of the population to access homeownership. 4. Regulatory arbitrage and shadow banking: Stringent regulations in one jurisdiction may encourage risk-taking to shift to less regulated areas or non-traditional financial institutions, such as shadow banks. This can undermine the effectiveness of regulations and lead to the accumulation of risks outside of traditional oversight frameworks. Overall, while strengthening regulations and oversight can be effective in mitigating housing market bubbles, it is important to carefully consider and manage the potential limitations and unintended consequences to ensure a balanced approach and sustained stability in the housing market."},{"instruction":"Estimate how much a 120 gb ram and 40 gbps server would cost","output":"The cost of a server with specific specifications such as 120 GB RAM and 40 Gbps network speed can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the brand, model, CPU, storage options, and additional features.

If we join forces, not only will you not be able to stay at Yunyang High School, but your Ye family won't be able to stay in Rongcheng either.\\" \\"So, you're threatening me?\\" Ye Ning smiled, squinting her phoenix-shaped eyes. However, her smile did not reach her eyes. \\"Yes, I am threatening you!\\" The parent raised their chin, \\"If you're smart, you'll leave Yunyang High School. If you're not, don't blame us. Our child is at a crucial moment for the college entrance examination, and we can't let you affect them.\\" \\"Oh!\\" Ye Ning raised her eyebrows and suddenly asked, \\"Which family are you from?\\" The parent furrowed their brows, then lifted their head proudly, \\"The Chen family.\\" The Chen family is in the clothing business. After years of development, they have turned their own brand into a second-tier brand. The person in front of her is Mrs. Chen, who usually likes to compare herself with the noble women in her circle and has high standards. In terms of family status, the Chen family is inferior to the Ye family. However, the Chen family has abundant funds. When it comes to finances, the Ye family can't match them. After all, without a good perfume formula and a large investment, the Ye family will soon face bankruptcy. Ye Ning took a step forward, calmly saying, \\"I have a little quirk. I extremely dislike being threatened by others. It seems that Mrs. Chen has some time on her hands, so I will find something for you to do.\\" Mrs. Chen was about to speak when Ye Ning took out her phone and made a call, \\"Xiao Wu, I've been bullied.\\" On the other end of the phone, Yu Chixuan, the chairman of Wancheng Group, heard this and immediately stood up, \\"Who did it?\\" If someone bullied his junior sister, he could guarantee that they would have a miserable end! \\"The Chen family in Rongcheng.\\" \\"Wait, Junior Sister, I will avenge you!\\" \\"Okay, you alone are enough.\\" Yu Chixuan was about to gather the other senior brothers, but upon hearing Ye Ning's words, he had to give up, \\"Alright! I understand.\\" After hanging up the phone, Yu Chixuan immediately called his assistant, throwing a check at them, saying, \\"Invest two billion into taking down the Chen family. If any member of the Chen family still has the energy to resist, it will be your fault!\\" The assistant trembled and said, \\"I will do it immediately!\\" After speaking, they hurriedly left. Is the Chen family crazy? How long has it been since the chairman dealt with another company, and now the Chen family has dared to provoke them? After hearing Ye Ning's phone call, Mrs. Chen sneered, \\"Are you trying to scare me? You can try, to see if you can scare me. Do you really think I will let you continue teaching here? Dream on!\\" Ye Ning pinched her forehead and said faintly, \\"I never thought that you could decide whether I stay or leave.\\" \\"You!\\" Mrs. Chen became furious, but before she could curse, a teacher rushed in, excitedly saying, \\"Principal, Professor Cheng's team has arrived.\\" Upon hearing this, Ye Ning looked at the time on her phone—it was exactly 8 o'clock, on the dot. Professor Cheng really knew how to be punctual, just as he said, he would arrive at 8 o'clock. The other parents, upon hearing this, forgot about pursuing Ye Ning's matter with the principal. They all had smiles on their faces, wanting to meet Professor Cheng and show off their children in front of him. \\"Please bring them in quickly,\\" Principal Ge was also very excited. Soon, the teacher brought in Professor Cheng's team. The principal's office was quite large, tens of square meters, but with these parents and Professor Cheng's team, it became crowded. Once Professor Cheng entered, he saw Ye Ning. \\"Xiao Ningning, I finally get to see you. Let me have a look, have you gained weight or lost weight?\\" The parents who were originally going to greet Professor Cheng were stunned when they heard this. They stared at Professor Cheng in disbelief, without any reaction. Chapter 62: Sue Me Principal Ge knew that Professor Cheng was invited by Ye Ning, but these parents did not. They were taken aback when they saw Professor Cheng being so familiar with Ye Ning. It took them a while to speak up, \\"What's going on? How does Professor Cheng know Ye Ning?\\" \\"I'm also curious. Isn't Ye Ning from the countryside? Professor Cheng has always been a professor at Jing University and rarely leaves Beijing. How could he know a village girl?\\" \\"Seeing how familiar Professor Cheng and Ye Ning are, it seems like they have known each other for a long time!\\" Everyone started discussing in disbelief. Their voices were not soft, and Ye Ning could hear them clearly. Ye Ning lifted the corner of her eyes, glanced at them, and smiled at Professor Cheng, \\"I've gained a little weight.\\" Lately, she had been eating a lot of strawberry cake and had gained two pounds. Professor Cheng pinched her face and said, \\"It's good to be a little plump. You're too thin.

Czy władza i odpowiedzialność jest ważna podczas decyzji osobistych? To ponadczasowa kwestia wielokrotnie przewija się w literaturze jak i w codziennej egzystencji każdego z nas. Z perspektywy literatury oraz doświadczenia życiowego ludzi wiemy, że władza wpływa na decyzje człowieka. Przykłady z literatury jak ,,Antygona\\" lub ,,Król Edyp\\" utwierdzają nas tylko w tym przekonaniu","output":"Wstęp, który został przedstawiony, dobrze nakreśla kierunek rozważań na temat wpływu władzy i odpowiedzialności na decyzje osobiste. Dotyka kwestii uniwersalnej i aktualnej, co jest silną stroną takiego ujęcia tematu. Wartościowa jest również wzmianka o ponadczasowości poruszanego zagadnienia oraz osadzenie dyskusji na gruncie literatury, co sprawia, że analiza może mieć charakter bardziej dogłębny dzięki odniesieniu do konkretnych dzieł. Przywoływanie postaci Edypa i Antygony jako reprezentantów problematyki moralnej oraz związanego z nią ciężaru odpowiedzialności i władzy, dobrze wpasowuje się w literackie i filozoficzne konteksty dyskusji. Jako sugestie do ewentualnej poprawy lub rozszerzenia, można by rozważyć następujące kwestie: 1. Zdefiniowanie pojęć: Wyjaśnienie, na czym autor rozumie w tym kontekście władzę i odpowiedzialność, pomogłoby przygotować grunt pod dalszą analizę. Określenie, czy władza jest traktowana jako możliwość wpływania na innych, czy też jako siła samodzielnego podejmowania decyzji, znacznie zwiększyłoby jasność argumentacji. 2. Zapowiedź struktury pracy: Można by wzmocnić ten wstęp, podając krótko strukturę pracy – jakie argumenty zostaną przedstawione i w jakiej kolejności, czy zostaną poddane analizie inne przykłady literackie czy historyczne, które mogą poprzeć lub przeciwstawić się tezie. 3. Stawianie pytań: Aby wzbudzić większe zainteresowanie tematem, można zakończyć wstęp pytaniem retorycznym lub postawić pytanie badawcze, które będzie prowadzić przez całą analizę. 4. Kontekstualizacja zagadnienia: Można by poszerzyć wstęp o krótkie wprowadzenie do kontekstu społecznego lub historycznego, w którym powstawały omawiane dzieła, by jeszcze głębiej zrozumieć decyzje bohaterów. Ostatecznie wstęp może zostać potraktowany jako ciekawe wprowadzenie do analizy literackiej, która stara się odpowiadać na pytanie o uniwersalną wartość rozważań na temat władzy i odpowiedzialności w kontekście osobistych wyborów moralnych."},{"instruction":"润色如下内容：Financial decision influences both individuals and organisations and an understanding of finance seems to me to be one of the most important ways in which resources can be generated and managed. Individual decisions of saving or spending, business incentives, even government policy is based on finance. I believe a degree related to finance will help me excel in many different fields of work including accountancy, business, economics and management. Coming from China, a developing country with a fast pace, I have been inspired by the concept of microfinance in a book I read.Dr. Yunus’s unconventional approach to lending money to entrepreneurs who were too poor to qualify for a traditional bank loan have motivated me to seek a financial degree so that I can have a career which can make a positive difference in people's lives. As a student with accounting background,I have learned a variety of courses such as Managerial Economics,Macroeconomic Policy and Performance,Financial Accounting,Date Analysis and Optimisation,Financial Decision Making and so on,which has laid me a solid foundation for my further study.I am also interested in exploring relative academic field,so I have abundant research experience based on what I learn. When finish research paper on An analysis of the determinants of the price of small cars in the Northern Irish used car market, my aim was to provide verifiable insights that can act as a guide to new participants in the Northern Irish used car market and better inform the opinions of experienced used car buyers. Together with my group members, we then completed a multivariate regression including all the independent variables to find if together they have significant explanatory power in determining the price of a used car. Personally, I benefited from the academic process,ranging from academic improvement to group cooperation.Based on these experiences,I believe that I can make some contributions to the field I like. Except what should be learned,I tend to explore the area about finance in my spare time. For example, I would like to read various books so that I can know more about financial world as well as some attracting examples. Among all the book I read, Financial Crises and Periods of Industrial and Commercial written left me a deep impression as it treats capital as a complete set of economic action models and the author creatively introduces the operational laws of capital from five perspectives, bringing me a different perspective.What’s more,I pay attention to financial news,especially those about corporate business,aiming to learn cutting-edge operations from successful practice. During university,I was fortunate enough to have an experience of home business where I ran pancakes and fruit delivery with friends in the United Kingdom. During the process, I was able to apply what I learned into practice. For instance, except managing the operation of the platform, purchasing raw materials and dealing with customer demands,I knew about market and cost control.Additionally, this experience helped me to become more confident and to get experience of working in a team. Sometimes it required me to socialize with all sorts of people from different backgrounds and ages and to handle situations in a professional and mature manner. I believe that this would help me adjust to a business environment.However, I realized that there was more to learn if we would like to make the home business into a company. I am keen to extend my knowledge, skills and understanding while learning from others and working with them. I feel that postgraduate study is definitely the experience which will help me to do this. I am aware that the world of finance, business and economics is ever changing and my chosen degree subject will prove to be challenging but I look forward to overcoming those challenges. I am heartedly grateful for what I have been able to learn through my undergraduate years, but I do not believe that should be the end of my education journey.

Z perspektywy literatury oraz doświadczenia życiowego wiemy, że władza wpływa na siłę podejmowanych przez ludzi decyzji.

Co więcej, wstęp ten sugeruje, że władza nie tylko wpływa na decyzje, ale również na ciężar konsekwencji wynikających z tych decyzji. Rozpoczynając od ogólnej deklaracji dotyczącej uniwersalności tematu, autor wprowadza czytelnika w problematykę współzależności władzy i moralnych wyborów, co jest kluczowe w kontekście dramatów Sofoklesa. Niezwykle celne jest przytoczenie akurat \\"Antygony\\" i \\"Króla Edypa\\", ponieważ te dzieła klasyczne nie tylko rozważają kwestie władzy i etyki, ale również eksplorują tragiczne konsekwencje, które te wybory mogą pociągać za sobą.
