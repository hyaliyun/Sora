Given that the death rate is 1 person every two seconds, the net increase in population every two seconds is B - 1. We want to find the net increase in population over one day (24 hours). There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Therefore, in 24 hours, there are 24 * 3600 = 86400 seconds. Since the net increase occurs every two seconds, we need to divide the total number of seconds in a day by 2 to find out how many times this net increase happens in one day: 86400 seconds / 2 seconds = 43200 times. The estimated size of the population net increase in one day is 259200, and this happens over the course of 43200 times (every two seconds). Therefore, the net increase per two-second interval is: 259200 net increase / 43200 times = 6 people net increase every two seconds.

It is known that if any one projector is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated, but if any two projectors are turned off, the arena will not be fully illuminated. For which values of n is it possible for the arena to be fully and uniquely illuminated according to these conditions?  1. **Identify Key Pairwise Relationships**:    For each pair of projectors in the arena, there must be a region illuminated by exactly those two projectors. 2. **Construct the Desired Polygon**:    - Consider a regular k-gon (a polygon with k sides) inscribed in the arena, where k = frac{1}{2} n (n - 1). This k is the number of different pairs that can be formed from n projectors. Use the binomial coefficient to calculate this, specifically {n choose 2} which is frac{n(n-1)}{2}. 3. **Projector Assignment**:    - Establish a one-to-one correspondence between the various segment areas delimited by the sides of the k-gon and the pairs of projectors from the total of n projectors.    - Each projector will illuminate the entire k-gon and the specific segments corresponding to the pairs that include this projector. 4. **Verification of Illumination Properties**:    - When one projector is turned off:      If we turn off any one projector P, every area in the arena is still illuminated by at least one other projector because each area is covered by exactly two projectors and turning off one leaves one projector still illuminating each segment.    - When two projectors are turned off:      If we turn off any two projectors P and Q, there will be segments of the arena (specifically those illuminated by pairs including both P and Q) that will no longer be illuminated, resulting in incomplete illumination of the arena. # Conclusion: Hence, it is found that such an arrangement is possible for any n geq 2.

Consider a tetrahedron ABCD. We are given that the edges DA, DB, and DC are mutually perpendicular. Let the height from vertex D to the base triangle ABC be m, and let the circumradius of triangle ABC be R. 2. First, we know the area T of the triangle ABC with sides a, b, and c can be written in terms of the circumradius R:    [    T = frac{a b c}{4R}    ]    Therefore, the circumradius R can be expressed as:    [    R = frac{a b c}{4T}    ] 3. Our goal is to prove that:    [    m leq frac{R}{sqrt{2}}, quad text{or equivalently} quad 2 m T leq frac{a b c}{2 sqrt{2}}    ] 4.

Equating both expressions for the volume of the tetrahedron, we get:    [    frac{T cdot m}{3} = frac{d cdot e cdot f}{6}    ]    Rearranging terms yields:    [    2 m T = d cdot e cdot f    ] 6.

This is because only these forms of (m) do not have primitive roots. 2. **Case Analysis**:    We will consider the cases where (m) is of the form (p^k) or (2p^k). The cases (m = 2) and (m = 4) are trivial and can be checked separately. 3. **Case 1: (m = p^k)**:    - Let (m = p^k) where (p) is an odd prime and (k geq 1).    - The Euler's totient function (phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1} = p^{k-1}(p-1)).    - We need to show that (a^{frac{phi(p^k)}{2}} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}). 4. **Divisibility and Exponentiation**:    - Since (phi(p^k) = p^{k-1}(p-1)), we have (frac{phi(p^k)}{2} = frac{p^{k-1}(p-1)}{2}).    - Note that (frac{p-1}{2}) is an integer because (p) is an odd prime.    - Therefore, (frac{phi(p^k)}{2} = p^{k-1} times frac{p-1}{2}). 5. **Order of (a) modulo (p^k)**:    - The order of (a) modulo (p^k) must divide (phi(p^k)).    - Since (a) is relatively prime to (p^k), (a^{phi(p^k)} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}) by Euler's theorem.    - Thus, (a^{p^{k-1}(p-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}). 6. **Exponentiation to Half the Totient**:    - We need to show (a^{frac{p^{k-1}(p-1)}{2}} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}).    - Since (a^{p^{k-1}(p-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}), raising both sides to the power of (frac{1}{2}) (which is valid because (frac{p-1}{2}) is an integer) gives:      [      left(a^{p^{k-1}(p-1)}right)^{frac{1}{2}} equiv 1^{frac{1}{2}} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}      ]    - Therefore, (a^{frac{p^{k-1}(p-1)}{2}} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}). 7. **Generalization to (m)**:    - Since (p) was an arbitrary prime factor of (m), and the argument holds for each prime power (p^k) dividing (m), it follows that:      [      a^{frac{phi(m)}{2}} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}      ]    - By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since this holds for each prime power dividing (m), it holds modulo (m):      [      a^{frac{phi(m)}{2}} equiv 1 pmod{m}      ] (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"The function y=|2^x1| is not monotonic in the interval (k1, k+1).

The integers are arranged in rows of four, with the pattern alternating between odd and even rows:    - In odd-numbered rows, the numbers are in the last four columns and increase from left to right.    - In even-numbered rows, the numbers are in the first four columns and increase from right to left. 2. Let's identify the positions of the numbers in the columns:    - In the first row (odd), the numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5.    - In the second row (even), the numbers are 9, 8, 7, 6.    - In the third row (odd), the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13.    - In the fourth row (even), the numbers are 17, 16, 15, 14.    - This pattern continues indefinitely. 3. We need to determine the row in which the number 1000 falls. Each row contains 4 numbers, so we can calculate the row number by dividing 1000 by 4:    [    text{Row number} = leftlceil frac{1000}{4} rightrceil = 250    ]    Since 1000 is exactly divisible by 4, it falls in the 250th row. 4. Next, we determine whether the 250th row is odd or even. Since 250 is an even number, the 250th row is an even row. 5. In even rows, the numbers are arranged in the first four columns and increase from right to left. Therefore, the numbers in the 250th row are:    [    1000, 999, 998, 997    ]    These numbers are placed in the columns as follows:    - 1000 in the first column    - 999 in the second column    - 998 in the third column    - 997 in the fourth column 6. Therefore, the number 1000 falls in the first column. The final answer is boxed{text{first}}"},{"instruction":"Prove that among the first ten million digits of the decimal representation of sqrt{2}, there are not six million consecutive identical digits!","output":"1. **Assumption and Initial Setup**:     Suppose that in the decimal expansion of sqrt{2}, starting from the (k+1)-th decimal place, there are l consecutive identical digits. Let this common digit be denoted by ( c ). To solve the problem, we need to prove that ( l leq k + 2 ). This indeed implies that for six million identical digits, there must be at least 5,999,998 other digits preceding it, which is impossible within the first ten million digits. 2. **Formalizing the Digits**:     Let the decimal expansion of sqrt{2} up to the first (1+k-l) digits be ( 1, a_1 a_2 ldots a_k c c ldots c ), and denote the corresponding number by:     [     A = 1.a_1 a_2 ldots a_k + frac{c}{9} cdot 10^{-k} = 1.a_1 a_2 ldots a_k ccc ldots     ] 3. **Bounding the Difference Between A and (sqrt{2})**:     We know that the first k+l decimal places of A and sqrt{2} are the same. Hence,     [     |sqrt{2} - A| leq 10^{-(k+l)}     ] 4. **Multiplication by (sqrt{2} + A)**:     Multiplying the above inequality by sqrt{2} + A, and using the fact that sqrt{2} + A < 4,     [     (sqrt{2} - A)(sqrt{2} + A) leq 4 cdot 10^{-(k+l)}     ]     Which simplifies to:     [     |2 - A^2| < 4 cdot 10^{-(k+l)}     ] 5. **Introducing an Integer B**:     Let B = 9 cdot 10^k cdot A. Since B is an integer, multiplying both sides of the previous inequality by 81 cdot 10^{2k} gives:     [     left| 162 cdot 10^{2k} - B^2 right| < 364 cdot 10^{-(k+l)}     ] 6. **Refining the Inequality**:     If ( l geq k + 3 ), then:     [     left| 162 cdot 10^{2k} - B^2 right| < 0.364     ]     Since both ( 162 cdot 10^{2k} ) and ( B^2 ) are integers, the left-hand side must also be an integer. Therefore, we have:     [     162 cdot 10^{2k} = B^2     ] 7. **Reaching a Contradiction**:     However, 162 is not a perfect square, which implies that the equation ( 162 cdot 10^{2k} = B^2 ) cannot hold true. This contradiction indicates that our initial assumption (that ( l geq k + 3 )) must be false.      Therefore, it follows that ( l leq k + 2 ). 8. **Conclusion**:     Since the maximum possible ( l ) for which ( k + l ) digits can match within the first ten million digits cannot exceed ( 10^{7} ), six million identical digits cannot exist without violating the condition ( l leq k + 2 ). Hence,      boxed{text{there are no six million consecutive identical digits within the first ten million digits of }sqrt{2}}.

Pipe B can fill the remaining one-third of the cistern in 8 minutes, so it can fill the entire cistern in 8 * 3 = 24 minutes. Therefore, Pipe B's rate is 1/24 of the cistern per minute. Pipe C can empty the full cistern in 24 minutes, so its rate is -1/24 of the cistern per minute (negative because it's emptying the cistern). When Pipes A and B are filling and Pipe C is open and emptying, the combined rate of the three pipes is: (1/36 + 1/24 - 1/24) of the cistern per minute.

Suppose A = 0 and B = L on a number line, where L = |AB|. Then for a point P_i outside AB, its coordinates could be P_i < 0 or P_i > L.  5. The key observation here is that:    [    |P_i - A| + |P_i - B| = |P_i| + |P_i - L|    ] 6. When we take the distances from these points to A and B, the differences between the distances from a point to A and B is always pm|AB|.

Therefore, the sum of the differences of distances from each of these 45 points to points A and B will be:    [    sum_{i=1}^{45} (|P_i - A| - |P_i - B|)    ] 8.

Since 45 is an odd number, the sum can never cancel out to zero perfectly because we cannot pair each L with a -L evenly. Therefore, the sums of these types of sequences of (pm|AB|) terms cannot perfectly cancel out to zero.

These integers are not prime and no two of them share a factor greater than 1. 2. **Consider the prime factorization constraints**: The largest prime (p) such that (p^2 leq 1000) is 31 (since (31^2 = 961) and (37^2 = 1369), which is more than 1000). Hence, any non-prime number less than 1000 must have at least one prime factor less than or equal to 31. 3. **Analyze the conditions on permissible selections**: Given that no two numbers should share any prime factors less than or equal to 31, the maximum (n) corresponds directly to choosing numbers that either avoid having common small prime factors or limit each small prime factor to appearing only once. 4. **Considering prime factors up to 31**:      - The prime numbers less than or equal to 31 are: (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31) (a total of 11 primes).     - Given that no pair of integers in Piercarlo's set can share any of these prime factors, the maximum (n) will be influenced by avoiding shared prime factors among chosen integers. 5. **Incorporate the number 1**: We can include the number 1 in the set, because 1 is neither prime nor composite, and shares no common factors greater than 1 with any other integer. 6. **Selecting additional numbers**: We select numbers such that each small prime less than or equal to 31 is used exactly once in the factorization.

Therefore,    [    FF_1 = A_1D quad text{and} quad angle A_1XF = 60^circ    ]        Lemma 1 is proven. 3. **Continuation with Lemma 2**:    Next, we need to show that angles ( angle A_1DE_1 ) and ( angle C_1CE_1 ) are equal.        **Proof of Lemma 2**:    - Denote ( alpha = angle B_1FF_1 = angle B_1AD_1 ).    - Then, [ angle XFA = alpha - 60^circ ]    - ( angle FAY = 360^circ - angle B_1AF - angle B_1AD_1 = 300^circ - alpha ), thus:      [      angle XFA + angle FAY = 240^circ      ]    - Given ( angle FXD = angle AYC = 120^circ ), the sum of angles in the hexagon ( AYCDFX ) yields ( angle XDC + angle DCY = 240^circ ).    - So:      [      angle E_1CC_1 = 360^circ - left (angle DCE_1 + angle DCY right) = 60^circ + angle XDC      ]    Hence,     [    angle E_1CC_1 = angle A_1DE_1    ]        Lemma 2 is proven. 4. **Conclusion**:    Using Lemma 1:    [    A_1D = FF_1 = AD_1 = CC_1    ]    Considering the triangles ( Delta A_1DE_1 ) and ( Delta C_1CE_1 ):    [    A_1E_1 = E_1C_1    ]    Similarly, showing:    [    A_1E_1 = A_1C_1    ]    Thus, ( Delta A_1C_1E_1 ) is equilateral. 5. **Transformation Explanation** (Geometric Interpretation):    When examining the transformations involving rotations:    - Triangles ( Delta B_1FA ) and ( Delta B_1F_1D_1 ) under a ( 60^circ ) rotation show that ( FF_1 = AD_1 ).    - Similarly, equilateral triangles involving vertices point towards consistent angle preservations leading to:      [      FF_1 = A_1D quad text{and} quad angle (FF_1, A_1D) = 60^circ      ] 6. **Final Conclusion**:    By analyzing the geometric rotations and congruence, ( Delta A_1C_1E_1 ) is confirmed as equilateral.

Extend ( IY ) to intersect ( OK ) at ( R_2 ). 2. **Properties of Right Triangles**:    - Consider the right triangles ( triangle ZOA ) and ( triangle ZOR_1 ):      - They share the leg ( ZO ).      - ( angle ZOA = angle ZOR_1 ) because ( OZ ) is the angle bisector of ( angle AOK ).

However, in the construction:    [    n_i = p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_{i-1} cdot p_i^2 cdot p_{i+1} cdot ldots cdot p_8,    ]        and    [    n_j = p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_{j-1} cdot p_j^2 cdot p_{j+1} cdot ldots cdot p_8,    ]        ( p_i ) appears in the factorization of ( n_i ) with an exponent of 1, assuming ( i neq j ), since ( p_j^2 ) cannot divide ( p_i ) (since they are different primes).    Therefore, ( n_i ) cannot divide ( n_j ) because the exponent of ( p_i ) in ( n_j ) is 1, which is not enough to cover the exponent of 2 required by ( p_i^2 ) in ( n_i ).  Hence, it is correct that ( n_i ) does not divide ( n_j ) when ( i neq j ).

By the definition of projection, angle O A' A = 90^circ. This means that the point A' lies on the circle with diameter OA. 2. **Identify the diameters involved:**    Similarly, let B' be the projection of point B onto the line passing through point O. Again, angle O B' B = 90^circ, so point B' lies on the circle with diameter OB.    These circles are typically known as the Thales’ circles of OA and OB. 3. **Conclusion about the locus:**    The points A' and B' will describe circles with diameters OA and OB, respectively, when considering all possible lines through O. Therefore, the locus of all projections of segment AB onto any line passing through O will be contained inside the area where the circles overlap.    For the segment AB, the projections of all its points fall within one circle while remaining outside the other due to the right-angle constraints from the projections. Specifically:        - If we project point (A) through any line passing through (O), the projection lies on a circle with diameter (OA).    - If we project point (B) through any line passing through (O), the projection lies on a circle with diameter (OB).    Consequently, the geometric place of the projections of the points on the segment (AB) are the points that lie inside one of these circles but outside the other.  Thus the geometric locus (G.M.T.) of these projections is the region within the intersection of these two circles. **Conclusion:** The geometric locus of the projections of the points from the segment AB onto all possible lines passing through the given point O form a region enclosed within one of the circles defined with diameters OA and OB while being outside of the other circle. boxed{text{Locus inside one, outside the other circle}}"},{"instruction":"f paint costs  3.20 per quart , and a quart covers 60 square feet , how much will it cost to paint the outside of a cube 10 feet on each edge ?","output":"First, we need to calculate the total surface area of the cube that needs to be painted. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square with each side measuring 10 feet. The area of one face of the cube is: Area = side × side = 10 feet × 10 feet = 100 square feet Since there are 6 faces on a cube, the total surface area to be painted is: Total surface area = 6 × area of one face = 6 × 100 square feet = 600 square feet Now, we know that 1 quart of paint covers 60 square feet.

The combined work done by a, b, and c in one day when working together is the sum of the individual works they can do in one day: ( frac{1}{90} + frac{1}{45} + frac{1}{x} = frac{1}{5} ) To solve for x, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation.

Thus, overrightarrow {OA}cdot overrightarrow {OB}=x_1x_2+y_1y_2=-2pm+m^2=m^{2}-2m. So, 2pm=2m, and since m neq 0, we have p=1. The equation of parabola C is x^2=2y. 2. Using begin{cases} y=x  x^{2}=2y end{cases}, we can find that P(2,2). Differentiating y=frac{x^2}{2} gives us y'=x. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to C at P is y-2=2(x-2), which simplifies to 2x-y-2=0. Combining begin{cases} 2x-y-2=0  y=x+m end{cases}, we find D(m+2,2m+2). Thus, |PD|^2=(m+2-2)^2+(2m+2-2)^2=5m^2. The parametric equations for the line l are begin{cases} x=m+2+ frac { sqrt {2}}{2}t  y=2m+2+ frac { sqrt {2}}{2}tend{cases} (where t is the parameter). Substituting these parametric equations into x^2=2y, we get t^2+(2m+2) sqrt {2}t+2m^2=0. Let the parameters corresponding to A and B be t_1 and t_2, respectively. Then, |DA||DB|=|t_1||t_2|=|t_1t_2|=|2m^2|=2m^2. Hence, t= frac {|PD|^{2}}{|DA|cdot |DB|}=frac{5m^2}{2m^2}=boxed{frac{5}{2}}, which is a constant value."},{"instruction":"Find the largest positive integer m such that an m times m square can be exactly divided into 7 rectangles with pairwise disjoint interiors, and the lengths of the 14 sides of these 7 rectangles are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.","output":"1. **Formulating the Problem**:    We are required to determine the maximum integer m for which a m times m square can be divided into 7 non-overlapping rectangles such that the sum of the edge lengths of these rectangles equals the numbers from 1 to 14. 2. **General Formulation**:    Let's consider a general situation where a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n} is a permutation of the integers 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2n.

Proof that 2 intersections are impossible: Using a similar approach as the original problem, we assume a configuration of five lines with exactly two intersections, labeled A and B. - **No line through both A and B and each intersection involves different lines**: The lines forming intersections at A and B must be parallel, a contradiction since they intersect. - **At least one line through A and B**: Let this line be l.

The negation neg P of \\"forall x in mathbb{R}, x^2+x+1neq 0\\" would be \\"exists x in mathbb{R} such that x^2+x+1 = 0\\". This proposition is also correct because negating a universal quantifier results in an existential quantifier with the negated predicate. ③ The proposition \\"p vee q\\" (read as \\"p or q\\") being true does not necessarily imply that both p and q are true. In logical disjunction, it is sufficient for one of the propositions to be true. Therefore, this statement is incorrect. ④ The statement \\"x > 3\\" being a sufficient condition for \\"x^2-3x+2 > 0\\" means if x > 3 is true, then x^2-3x+2 > 0 must also be true. However, it's not a necessary condition because x^2-3x+2 > 0 can also be true for some values of x that are not greater than 3. The proposition is correct. ⑤ In triangle ABC, if A > B, then sin A > sin B. This statement is generally true in a triangle where angles are between 0 and pi radians (or 0 and 180 degrees), as the sine function is increasing in this range. However, for obtuse angles, this statement would not hold, but since triangle internal angles are always acute or right, the proposition is correct.  After reviewing all the propositions, we find that ①, ②, ④, and ⑤ are correct, while ③ is incorrect. Therefore, there are 4 correct propositions. Hence, the final answer is boxed{D} (4 correct propositions)."},{"instruction":"From a collection of 5 pairs of shoes, the number of ways to select 4 individual shoes such that exactly 1 pair is among them is ________.","output":"**Analysis** This problem involves the application of counting principles.

We start with the equation of the ellipse given in the problem:    [    x^2 + 2y^2 = 3    ]    We can rewrite this in standard form:    [    frac{x^2}{3} + frac{y^2}{frac{3}{2}} = 1    ] 2. The foci of this ellipse can be found using the relationship between the semi-major axis (a), semi-minor axis (b), and the focal distance (c):    [    a^2 = 3, quad b^2 = frac{3}{2}    ]    [    c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{3 - frac{3}{2}} = sqrt{frac{3}{2}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{2}    ]    Therefore, one of the foci of the ellipse is ((pm frac{sqrt{6}}{2}, 0)). 3. The line passing through one of the foci with the slope (k) can be written as:    [    y = k left(x - frac{sqrt{6}}{2}right)    ] 4. Substituting this line equation into the ellipse equation:    [    x^2 + 2 left(k left(x - frac{sqrt{6}}{2}right)right)^2 = 3    ]    Simplifying the equation:    [    x^2 + 2k^2 left(x - frac{sqrt{6}}{2}right)^2 - 3 = 0    ]    Expanding and organizing the terms gives:    [    x^2 + 2k^2 left(x^2 - sqrt{6} x + frac{3}{2}right) - 3 = 0    ]    [    x^2 + 2k^2 x^2 - 2k^2 sqrt{6} x + 3k^2 - 3 = 0    ]    This simplifies to:    [    (1 + 2k^2) x^2 - 2 k^2 sqrt{6} x + 3k^2 - 3 = 0    ] 5.

So, Nicholas paid: 28,000 + 140,000 = 168,000 We need to find out how much fabric Nicholas bought. Since the price per oz of fabric is the same for both Kenneth and Nicholas, we can find out how many oz of fabric Nicholas bought by dividing the total amount he paid by the price per oz: Nicholas bought fabric for 168,000 at 40/oz, so he bought: 168,000 / 40/oz = 4200 oz Now we have the amounts of fabric both Nicholas and Kenneth bought. To find the ratio of the amount of fabric Nicholas bought to the amount of fabric Kenneth bought, we divide Nicholas's amount by Kenneth's amount: Nicholas's amount / Kenneth's amount = 4200 oz / 700 oz = 6 So, the ratio of the amount of fabric Nicholas bought to the amount of fabric Kenneth bought is boxed{6:1} ."},{"instruction":"Alice's rectangular flower garden is 15 feet by 30 feet, and Bob's is 18 feet by 28 feet.

In a regular octagon, each external angle is (45^circ), meaning each internal angle is (135^circ). Each triangle formed by connecting (O) to adjacent midpoints like (P) and (Q) will therefore be isosceles with vertex angle (45^circ) at (O) and base angles (67.5^circ). The smaller octagon will have all sides equal and similarly formed triangles for all octagon vertex divisions by the midpoint connections, yielding a smaller, proportional octagon. The ratio of the area of each smaller triangle (OPQ) to the larger triangle segment in (ABCO) is dictated by the ratio of their heights (both having the same base), which is (1:2) - since midpoint divides the side into half.

Therefore, the induction basis for n=1 is proven, and the property holds. (2) To prove 2sqrt{n} - 1 leq sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{i}}, let's begin by manipulating the sum: [ frac{1}{a_{n}} = a_{n+1} - a_{n-1}, frac{1}{a_{n-1}} = a_{n} - a_{n-2}, ldots, frac{1}{a_{3}} = a_{4} - a_{2}, frac{1}{a_{2}} = a_{3} - a_{1}, frac{1}{a_{1}} = 1. ] By summing these equations, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{i}} = a_{n+1} + a_{n} - a_{2} - a_{1} + 1 = a_{n+1} + a_{n} - 1 geq 2sqrt{a_{n+1}a_{n}} - 1 = 2sqrt{n} - 1. ] Now, to prove that sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_{i}} < 3sqrt{n} - 1, we start by showing that frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2}sqrt{n} leq a_{n} leq frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}sqrt{n - 1} for ngeq2 and nin mathbb{N}^*, which we will prove by induction. Inductive base case (n=2): a_{2} = 1, which clearly satisfies the inequality. Inductive step: Assume that the inequality holds for n=k, [ frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2}sqrt{k} leq a_{k} leq frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}sqrt{k - 1}. ] Then for n=k+1, from a_{k+1}a_{k}=k, we get a_{k+1} = frac{k}{a_{k}}. Applying the inductive hypothesis: [ frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} cdot frac{k}{sqrt{k-1}} leq a_{k+1} leq frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}sqrt{k}. ] Since frac{k}{sqrt{k-1}} geq sqrt{k+1}, the inequality also holds for a_{k+1}.

Specifically, we use the property that any power of z can be reduced by taking out factors of z^3: - For z^{97}, we write 97 as 32 times 3 + 1, so z^{97} = (z^3)^{32} cdot z = 1^{32} cdot z = z. - Similarly, z^{98} = z^{32 times 3 + 2} = (z^3)^{32} cdot z^2 = 1^{32} cdot z^2 = z^2. - For z^{99}, we have z^{99} = z^{33 times 3} = (z^3)^{33} = 1^{33} = 1. - z^{100} = z^{33 times 3 + 1} = (z^3)^{33} cdot z = 1^{33} cdot z = z. - Lastly, z^{101} = z^{33 times 3 + 2} = (z^3)^{33} cdot z^2 = 1^{33} cdot z^2 = z^2.

Here, a_{5} = a_{1} + 4d = 0, leading to a_{1} = -4d.      Therefore, frac{a_{8}}{a_{6}} = frac{a_{1} + 7d}{a_{1} + 5d} = frac{-4d + 7d}{-4d + 5d} = frac{3d}{d} = 3.    - **Case 2: a_{5} < 0 and a_{6} > 0**      In this scenario, S_{5} being the smallest sum implies a_{5} = a_{1} + 4d < 0 and a_{6} = a_{1} + 5d > 0. This leads to the inequality -5 < frac{a_{1}}{d} < -4.      For the ratio frac{a_{8}}{a_{6}} = frac{a_{1} + 7d}{a_{1} + 5d}, we see that as frac{a_{1}}{d} varies within (-5, -4), the ratio frac{a_{8}}{a_{6}} increases beyond 3, reaching values in (3, +infty). 3. **Conclusion:**    Combining both cases, the range of frac{a_{8}}{a_{6}} includes 3 from the first case and extends to +infty from the second case.

Here, the number of questions Laura needs to get right to meet the criteria is 14.  Since the questions are multiple choice with four options, the probability of getting any single question correct by random guessing is frac{1}{4}. The situation can be modeled using the binomial distribution where n = 20 (the number of trials or questions) and p = frac{1}{4} (the probability of success on a single trial). To find the probability that Laura gets at least 14 questions correct, we need the sum of probabilities of getting 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 questions correct. This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula: [P(X = k) = binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}] where X is the random variable representing the number of correct answers. So, for our case: [P(X geq 14) = sum_{k=14}^{20} binom{20}{k} left(frac{1}{4}right)^k left(frac{3}{4}right)^{20-k}] This sum involves multiple terms of combinatorial calculations and powers, which can be summed up (usually calculated using a statistical tool or software because of its complexity): Calculating each term: - ( binom{20}{14} left(frac{1}{4}right)^{14} left(frac{3}{4}right)^6 ) - ( binom{20}{15} left(frac{1}{4}right)^{15} left(frac{3}{4}right)^5 ) - ... up to ... - ( binom{20}{20} left(frac{1}{4}right)^{20} left(frac{3}{4}right)^0 ) The sum of these terms gives us the probability that Laura guesses at least 14 questions correctly.

There are 20 gentlemen, and we need to determine the maximum number of handshakes that can occur, given that no three gentlemen are all mutually acquainted. This implies no subset of three gentlemen can all know each other, forming a clique of size 3. **Step 2:** Establish the graph theory context. We can model the problem with an undirected graph ( G ) where each vertex represents a gentleman, and an edge between two vertices represents mutual acquaintance. The problem states that ( G ) contains no triangles (no ( K_3 ) subgraph). **Step 3:** Use Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives an upper limit on the number of edges in a triangle-free graph. Specifically, Turán's theorem for ( K_3 ) (denoted as ( T(2, n) )) tells us the maximum number of edges ( E ) in a graph with ( n ) vertices that does not contain a ( K_3 ) is  [ E leq leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor ] Given ( n = 20 ) for our problem: [ E leq leftlfloor frac{20^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{400}{4} rightrfloor = 100 ] **Step 4:** Verify the calculation. [ leftlfloor frac{20^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 100 rightrfloor = 100 ] Thus, the upper bound is 100 handshakes. **Step 5:** Construct a scenario to achieve this number.

Suppose: - Group A: ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{10}} ) - Group B: ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{10}} ) Each gentleman in Group A knows all gentlemen in Group B, but no gentleman within Group A knows another within the same group, and similarly for Group B. This configuration ensures every possible handshake occurs between the groups and none within a single group. - Handshakes between A and B: ( 10 times 10 = 100 ) - Handshakes within groups: (0) (no mutual acquaintances within Group A or Group B) Thus, we achieve the maximum number of 100 handshakes with 20 gentlemen. **Conclusion:** The maximum number of handshakes that can be achieved is  [ boxed{100} ]"},{"instruction":"Alyssa traveled a total of 108 miles in 2 hours.

Since it is the first in the sequence, the compounded ratio would be the product of the individual ratios. The compounded ratio is given as approximately 2 (since 1.9999999999999998 is very close to 2, and it's likely a result of floating-point arithmetic limitations).

Substituting f(x) into g(x) gives: g(x) = 2ln x - x + frac{1}{x} The domain of definition for g(x) is (0, +infty). To find the monotonic intervals, we calculate the derivative of g(x): g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2ln x - x + frac{1}{x}) = frac{2}{x} - 1 - frac{1}{x^2} = -frac{x^2 - 2x + 1}{x^2} = -frac{(x-1)^2}{x^2} leqslant 0 Since g'(x) leqslant 0 for all x in the domain, g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty). Therefore, the monotonic decreasing interval of g(x) is boxed{(0, +infty)} with no increasing interval.  Part (2): Proving x_{2} - x_{1} > 1 + em Given f(x) = xln x, its derivative is: f'(x) = 1 + ln x Analyzing f'(x), we find: - When 0 < x < frac{1}{e}, f'(x) < 0. - When x > frac{1}{e}, f'(x) > 0. Thus, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, frac{1}{e}) and monotonically increasing on (frac{1}{e}, +infty). The minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = frac{1}{e}, giving f(frac{1}{e}) = -frac{1}{e}. For 0 < x < 1, f(x) = xln x < 0. Therefore, we have 0 < x_{1} < frac{1}{e} < x_{2} < 1 and -frac{1}{e} < m < 0. When x in (0, frac{1}{e}), ln x < -1, implying xln x < -x. Let x_{3} be the abscissa of the intersection point of y = -x and y = m. Then, x_{1} < x_{3} = -m = -x_{1}ln x_{1}. Next, we prove that when x in (frac{1}{e}, 1), f(x) < frac{1}{e-1}(x-1). Define h(x) = xln x - frac{1}{e-1}(x-1) and m(x) = ln x - frac{1}{e-1} + frac{1}{(e-1)x}. The derivative of m(x) is: m'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{(e-1)x^2} = frac{(e-1)x - 1}{(e-1)x^2} Analyzing m'(x), we find: - When frac{1}{e} < x < frac{1}{e-1}, m'(x) < 0. - When frac{1}{e-1} < x < 1, m'(x) > 0. Thus, m(x) is decreasing on (frac{1}{e}, frac{1}{e-1}) and increasing on (frac{1}{e-1}, 1). Since m(frac{1}{e}) = 0 and m(1) = 0, we have m(x) < 0 for frac{1}{e} < x < 1, implying h(x) < 0. Therefore, when x in (frac{1}{e}, 1), f(x) < frac{1}{e-1}(x-1). Let x_{4} be the abscissa of the intersection point of y = frac{1}{e-1}(x-1) and y = m. Then, x_{2} > x_{4} = 1 + (e-1)m.

Polynomial Form Suppose: [ p_{k}(x) = cdots + A_{k} x^2 + B_{k} x + 4 ] To find expressions for (A_k) and (B_k), we consider (p_{k-1}(x)) in a similar form: [ p_{k-1}(x) = cdots + A_{k-1} x^2 + B_{k-1} x + 4 ]  Expansion and Coefficient Matching Substituting (p_{k-1}(x)) into the recurrence relation: [ p_{k}(x) = (p_{k-1}(x) - 2)^2 ] Expanding the squared expression: [ (p_{k-1}(x) - 2)^2 = (A_{k-1} x^2 + B_{k-1} x + 4 - 2)^2 = (A_{k-1} x^2 + B_{k-1} x + 2)^2 ] Using the binomial expansion: [ (A_{k-1} x^2 + B_{k-1} x + 2)^2 = A_{k-1}^2 x^4 + 2A_{k-1} B_{k-1} x^3 + (B_{k-1}^2 + 4A_{k-1}) x^2 + 4 B_{k-1} x + 4 ] From the above, we focus only on the coefficients of (x^2) and (x): - Coefficient of (x^2): (B_{k-1}^2 + 4A_{k-1}) - Coefficient of (x): (4 B_{k-1}) Thus, we get the recurrence relations: [ B_{k} = 4 B_{k-1} ] [ A_{k} = B_{k-1}^2 + 4 A_{k-1} ]  Initial Conditions Given: [ B_{1} = -4, quad A_{1} = 1 ]  Solving the Recurrence Relations Using (B_{k} = 4 B_{k-1}): [ B_{2} = 4 B_{1} = 4(-4) = -16 ] [ B_{3} = 4 B_{2} = 4(-16) = -64 ] [ B_{k} = -4^k ] Using (A_{k} = B_{k-1}^2 + 4 A_{k-1}): [ A_{2} = B_{1}^2 + 4 A_{1} = (-4)^2 + 4(1) = 16 + 4 = 20 ] [ A_{3} = B_{2}^2 + 4 A_{2} = (-16)^2 + 4(20) = 256 + 80 = 336 ] Generalizing (A_{k}): [ A_{k} = frac{4^{2k-1} - 4^{k-1}}{3} ] Finally, the coefficient of (x^2) in (p_k(x)) is: [ boxed{frac{4^{2k-1} - 4^{k-1}}{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"Calculate the area of the figure enclosed by the lines given by the equations.  begin{aligned} & left{begin{array}{l} x=3 cos t  y=8 sin t end{array}right.  & y=4 sqrt{3}(y geq 4 sqrt{3}) end{aligned}","output":"1.

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height (or length in this case). The external radius (R) of the pipe is half of the external diameter, so R = 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm. The volume of the solid cylinder (V_solid) would be: V_solid = πR²h V_solid = π(4 cm)²(21 cm) V_solid = π(16 cm²)(21 cm) V_solid = π(336 cm³) V_solid = 1056π cm³ Now, let's calculate the volume of the hollow part. The internal radius (r) of the pipe is the external radius minus the thickness, so r = 4 cm - 1 cm = 3 cm. The volume of the hollow part (V_hollow) is: V_hollow = πr²h V_hollow = π(3 cm)²(21 cm) V_hollow = π(9 cm²)(21 cm) V_hollow = π(189 cm³) V_hollow = 189π cm³ The volume of the iron used to make the pipe (V_iron) is the volume of the solid cylinder minus the volume of the hollow part: V_iron = V_solid - V_hollow V_iron = 1056π cm³ - 189π cm³ V_iron = (1056 - 189)π cm³ V_iron = 867π cm³ Now, we can find the weight of the pipe by multiplying the volume of the iron by the weight of iron per cubic centimeter: Weight = V_iron * weight of iron per cm³ Weight = 867π cm³ * 8 g/cm³ Since π is approximately 3.1416, we can calculate the weight as follows: Weight ≈ 867 * 3.1416 * 8 g Weight ≈ 2736.1416 g Therefore, the weight of the pipe is approximately boxed{2736.1416}  grams."},{"instruction":"Some squares of an  n times n  chessboard have been marked ( n in N^* ).

We need to show that if the total number of marked squares is at least ( nleft(sqrt{n} + frac{1}{2}right) ), then there exists a rectangle whose vertices are centers of marked squares. 2. **Counting Pairs in Rows:**    Let ( R_i ) denote the number of different pairs ((ell, k)) such that the (ell)-th and (k)-th squares in row ( i ) are marked. This can be expressed as:    [    R_i = binom{a_i}{2} = frac{a_i(a_i - 1)}{2}    ]    This represents the number of ways to choose 2 marked squares from ( a_i ) marked squares in row ( i ). 3. **Total Number of Pairs:**    The total number of such pairs across all rows is:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i = sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{a_i}{2}    ] 4. **Applying Jensen's Inequality:**    Jensen's Inequality states that for a convex function ( f ), the inequality ( fleft(frac{x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n}{n}right) leq frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2) + cdots + f(x_n)}{n} ) holds.

First, let's manipulate the given equations to understand the relationship between the sides of the triangle. 1. From (a+c=2b), we can express (c) in terms of (a) and (b): [c = 2b - a] 2. From (c-a=frac{1}{2}b), we can also express (c) in terms of (a) and (b): [c = a + frac{1}{2}b] By equating the two expressions for (c), we get: [2b - a = a + frac{1}{2}b] This equation helps us understand the relationship between (a), (b), and (c), but to prove the nature of the triangle, we need to relate it to a known theorem or property. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ((c), assuming (c) is the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ((a) and (b)). That is, (c^2 = a^2 + b^2). Given (c-a=frac{1}{2}b), squaring both sides gives us: [c^2 - 2ac + a^2 = frac{1}{4}b^2] And from (a+c=2b), squaring both sides gives us: [a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = 4b^2] Combining these two equations, we aim to show that (c^2 = a^2 + b^2). However, the direct approach from the given solution uses the difference of squares, derived from the given equations (a+c=2b) and (c-a=frac{1}{2}b), to directly conclude that (c^2 - a^2 = b^2), which is a rearrangement of the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, without loss of generality, the given conditions imply: [c^2 - a^2 = (c+a)(c-a) = 2b cdot frac{1}{2}b = b^2] This directly shows that (c^2 - a^2 = b^2), which is a rearrangement of the Pythagorean theorem, indicating that triangle ABC is a right triangle.

What values can (k) take? (The 25th AllSoviet Union Mathematical Olympiad, 1991)","output":":  1. Consider each step in the process described. Whenever two numbers p and q are erased and replaced by p+q and |p-q|, it is essential to note that the sum of all numbers on the board remains constant. This can be illustrated as follows:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = S    ]    Here, ( S ) is the sum of the set {1, 2, 3, ldots, n } initially written on the blackboard. 2. Each transformation replaces p and q with p+q and |p-q|. Notice:    [    (p+q) + |p-q| = 2 max(p, q)    ]    Hence, the sum S remains unchanged. 3. The claim is that after several such transformations, the numbers on the board eventually become k, which could be a power of 2, specifically, k = 2^s where s in mathbb{N}. To understand why k must be a power of 2, consider the nature of the process. Each replacement operation either maintains or combines the numbers in such a way that eventually, non-negative integers that also sum to S must reduce down via multiples. 4. Since 1 is initially on the board and cannot be a multiple of any d>1 other than 1 itself, the transformations effectively chain the replacements towards multiples of powers of 2. The only way to proceed further is by powers of 2, as all other forms will eventually reduce to binary representation components due to the arithmetic nature of transformation. 5. The fact that k must be at least n is justified because as we transform pairs of numbers on the board, the largest number encountered will grow. However, it should still be greater or equal to the sum constraints set by initial sums, explaining why k geq n.   6. Furthermore, with the inherent binary nature explained, proving k = 2^s geq n is straightforward. Each arithmetic process aims to balance out making up to the highest possible multiples of 2, eventually aligning k as the nearest power of 2 that fits the sum constraints. # Conclusion: The solution concludes that k can take any power of 2 that is not less than n, given by: [ k = 2^s text{ where } 2^s geq n ] Thus, the value of ( k ) is confirmed as any power of 2 greater than or equal to ( n ): [ boxed{k = 2^s, text{ where } 2^s geq n} ]"},{"instruction":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} whose common difference and first term are both not equal to 0, and a_2, a_4, a_8 form a geometric sequence, then dfrac{a_1+a_5+a_9}{a_2+a_3}=　　() A: 2 B: 3 C: 5 D: 7","output":"Since the arithmetic sequence {a_n} has a common difference and first term both not equal to 0, and a_2, a_4, a_8 form a geometric sequence, therefore a_4^2=a_2a_8, therefore (a_1+3d)^2=(a_1+d)(a_1+7d), therefore d^2=a_1d, Since d neq 0, therefore d=a_1, therefore dfrac{a_1+a_5+a_9}{a_2+a_3}= dfrac{15a_1}{5a_1}=3． Hence, the correct choice is boxed{B}． By utilizing the fact that the arithmetic sequence {a_n} has a common difference and first term both not equal to 0, and a_2, a_4, a_8 form a geometric sequence, we can deduce that d=a_1, which allows us to calculate dfrac{a_1+a_5+a_9}{a_2+a_3}． This problem tests the properties of arithmetic sequences and examines the students' computational skills, which is quite basic."},{"instruction":"Suppose there are two numbers, x and y, for which the product of each with 12 is increased by 198 and 176, respectively.

Triangles AMH and ALC are also similar (both are right triangles sharing one angle each):      - angle AMH = 90^circ,      - angle HMA = angle CLA (angles in triangle AMH and triangle ALC).      - Therefore, triangle AMH sim triangle ALC.       7. Similarly, triangles BLH and BMC are similar:      - angle BLH = 90^circ,      - angle HLB = angle BMC (angles in triangle BLH and triangle BMC).      - Therefore, triangle BLH sim triangle BMC.     8. Considering the quadrilateral ABML is cyclic, the following triangles are similar:    - Triangles MHL and AHB:      - angle MHL = 90^circ,      - angle HML = angle HAB (corresponding angles in cyclic quadrilateral).      - Therefore, triangle MHL sim triangle AHB.     9. Triangles CLM and CAB:    - angle CLM = angle CAB (common angle),    - angle CML = angle CBA (corresponding angles in cyclic quadrilateral CLMB).    - Therefore, triangle CLM sim triangle CAB by AA similarity.     10. Let the intersection point of AB and LM be D. The following triangles are similar:     - Triangles DBL and DMA:       - angle DBL = angle DMA (vertical angles),       - angle BDL = angle ADM (angles at intersection).       - Therefore, triangle DBL sim triangle DMA by AA similarity.        11. Finally, considering the equality of angles angle BML = angle BAL:     - Triangles DBM and DLA:       - angle DBM = angle DLA (alternate interior angles),       - angle BDM = angle ADL.       - Therefore, triangle DBM sim triangle DLA by AA similarity. # Conclusion: We have identified 10 pairs of similar triangles: 1. triangle CAL sim triangle CBL 2. triangle AMH sim triangle BLH 3. triangle AMH sim triangle ALC 4. triangle BLH sim triangle BMC 5. triangle MHL sim triangle AHB 6. triangle CLM sim triangle CAB 7. triangle DBL sim triangle DMA 8. triangle DBM sim triangle DLA Hence, the maximum number of pairs of similar triangles is: [ boxed{10} ]"},{"instruction":"For which positive integer values of ( k ) does ( kx^2 + 12x + k = 0 ) have rational solutions? Express your answers separated by commas and in increasing order.","output":"We start by considering the quadratic formula (frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) for the solutions of ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ). For the equation ( kx^2 + 12x + k = 0 ), the coefficients are ( a = k ), ( b = 12 ), and ( c = k ). The solutions are rational if and only if the discriminant ( b^2 - 4ac ) is a perfect square.

We need to prove that if (A_1B_1) is parallel to the angle bisector of (angle B), then (A_2C_2) is parallel to the angle bisector of (angle C). 2. **Replacing Circumcenter with Incenter:**    Let's consider the incenter (I) of (triangle ABC) instead of the circumcenter. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect, and it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle. 3. **Symmetry and Perpendicularity:**    By symmetry, if (I) is the incenter, then the line (BI) (the angle bisector of (angle B)) is perpendicular to (A_1C_2). This is because the incenter is equidistant from the sides of the triangle, and the angle bisectors are perpendicular to the lines connecting the points where the incircle touches the sides of the triangle. 4. **Condition and Implication:**    Given that (A_1B_1) is parallel to the angle bisector of (angle B), we have (A_1C_2 perp A_1B_1). This implies that (B_1C_2) is a diameter of the circle, as the perpendicularity condition suggests that (A_1C_2) and (A_1B_1) form a right angle. 5. **Conclusion:**    Since (B_1C_2) is a diameter, (A_2C_2) must be perpendicular to (A_2B_1).

Apply this to each factor in the product:        left(1 - frac{1}{4}right)left(1 - frac{1}{9}right) cdots left(1 - frac{1}{n^2}right) = frac{(2-1)(2+1)}{2^2} times frac{(3-1)(3+1)}{3^2} times cdots times frac{(n-1)(n+1)}{n^2}     3. Combine the terms:        prod_{k=2}^{n} frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{k^2} = frac{1 cdot 3}{2^2} times frac{2 cdot 4}{3^2} times cdots times frac{(n-1)(n+1)}{n^2}     4. Notice that almost all terms cancel out in the product:        = frac{1}{2} times frac{3}{2} times frac{2}{3} times cdots times frac{n-1}{n} times frac{n+1}{n}     5. Simplify the product to get:        = frac{n+1}{2n}     Thus, the identity is successfully shown by both mathematical induction and telescoping product proof, verifying that: left(1 - frac{1}{4}right)left(1 - frac{1}{9}right)left(1 - frac{1}{16}right) cdots left(1 - frac{1}{n^2}right) = frac{n+1}{2n}  (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, find the imaginary part of the complex number frac{2i}{1i}.

Now, let's calculate the work done by x, y, and z. For the first 4 days, only x is working, so he does 4 * (1/20) of the work. After 4 days, y joins x, and they work together for the next 3 days. So, for these 3 days, they do (1/20 + 1/12) of the work each day.

Ensure that all sides of this square are equal and the angles are right angles. 2. **Identify the Intersection Points (E) and (F)**:     - Locate points (E) and (F) as follows:       - Point (E) is the intersection of the segment (AB') with the line (BC).       - Point (F) is the intersection of the segment (AC') with the line (BC). 3. **Apply Homothety**:     - Consider the homothety centered at (A) that maps point (B) to (E). By the properties of homothety, if point (B) maps to (E), then point (C) will map to a point on the line (BC).     - Specifically, under this homothety, point (C) maps to point (F). 4. **Create the New Square (EF F' E')**:     - Since a homothety maps a square to another square, the homothety that maps (B) to (E) and (C) to (F) will transform the original square (B C C' B') into a new square (E F F' E').     - This square (E F F' E') is the desired square such that:       - (X = E) lies on (AB)       - (Y) lies on (AB)       - (Z = F) lies on (AC)       - (T) lies on (BC) 5. **Verify the Proper Positioning**:     - Ensure that the square (E F F' E') is positioned such that its sides are parallel and equal in length to one another.     - Confirm that (E) and (F) lie on the lines (AB) and (AC) respectively, and that the whole square lies on the same side of the line (BC) as point (A). # Conclusion: The steps above demonstrate how one can construct the square (XYZT) within the triangle (ABC) such that: - (X) and (Y) lie on (AB), - (Z) lies on (AC), - (T) lies on (BC).

We can determine the intervals where the inequality holds true by testing the intervals divided by the roots: - For x < -1, choose x = -2, we have (-2 - 1)(-2 + 1) = (-3)(-1) = 3 > 0, so the inequality holds true. - For -1 < x < 1, choose x = 0, we have (0 - 1)(0 + 1) = (-1)(1) = -1 < 0, so the inequality does not hold true. - For x > 1, choose x = 2, we have (2 - 1)(2 + 1) = (1)(3) = 3 > 0, so the inequality holds true. Therefore, x^2 - 1 > 0 holds true for x < -1 or x > 1. Now, let's consider the given inequality x < -1. It implies that x^2 - 1 > 0, since, as we have determined, the inequality x^2 - 1 > 0 holds true for any x < -1. However, the converse is not true.

Is it possible to construct a polygon with an area of ( 16 mathrm{~cm}^2 ) using all the matches? (The matches cannot be broken, and all must be used.)","output":"To determine whether we can form a polygon with an area of 16 , mathrm{cm}^2 using 12 matchsticks of length 2 , mathrm{cm} each, observe the following steps: 1. **Calculate the Total Perimeter**:    Each matchstick is 2 , mathrm{cm} long. With 12 matchsticks, the total length of all the sticks is:    [    12 times 2 = 24 , mathrm{cm}    ] 2. **Choose a Suitable Polygon**:    To form a polygon with a known area using all the matchsticks without breaking any, let's try forming a regular polygon. One suitable option is forming a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon is chosen because it satisfies the conditions optimally (as regular polygons are generally easy to work with, ensuring proper utilization of stick lengths). 3. **Verification of Regular Hexagon**:    For a regular hexagon, each side length is equal. Thus, if we use all the matchsticks to form a hexagon, each side of the hexagon would be:    [    frac{24 , mathrm{cm}}{6} = 4 , mathrm{cm}    ]    However, given each matchstick is only 2 , mathrm{cm}, this seems infeasible as described. Hence, another approach is necessary. 4. **Area and Shape Consideration**:    Instead, consider other regular configurations like a square where sides may form a shape with appropriate area. Let's check plausibility for smaller polygon configurations.    For simplification, reconsider a simpler configuration – could be triangulation or smaller subdivisions reasonable using existing match lengths. 5. **Evaluate for Triangle Formation**:    Exploring smaller forms such as equilateral triangles, where total layout could better subdivide into areas like:    [    text{Area of equilateral triangle side length } a, text{ is } frac{sqrt{3} a^2}{4}    ]    For side a =2 cm, typical triangle segmentation needs could better fitted collectively then hex to reach nearby required forms aggregately. # Conclusion From structured assessment steps, valid formation remains plausible while considering fundamental restrictions with original stick lengths causing no breaking.

Express this difference as a single fraction with a common denominator:     [     frac{sin 1^circ}{sin 2^circ} - frac{sin 3^circ}{sin 4^circ} = frac{sin 1^circ cdot sin 4^circ - sin 2^circ cdot sin 3^circ}{sin 2^circ cdot sin 4^circ}     ] 3. Use angle sum and difference identities for sine and cosine to transform the numerator:     [     sin a sin b = frac{1}{2} (cos (a - b) - cos (a + b))     ]     So:     [     sin 1^circ cdot sin 4^circ - sin 2^circ cdot sin 3^circ = frac{1}{2} (cos (1^circ - 4^circ) - cos (1^circ + 4^circ)) - frac{1}{2} (cos (2^circ - 3^circ) - cos (2^circ + 3^circ))     ] 4.

Conclusion:     [     frac{sin 1^circ}{sin 2^circ} < frac{sin 3^circ}{sin 4^circ}     ]  Third Approach: 1. Define a function f(x) = frac{sin alpha}{sin (x + alpha)} on (0, pi/2) where alpha = frac{pi}{180} (or 1^circ). 2. Compute the derivative:     [     f'(x) = frac{cos x sin (x + alpha) - cos (x + alpha) sin x}{sin^2(x + alpha)} = frac{sin alpha}{sin^2 (x + alpha)}     ] 3. Since sin alpha > 0 for alpha in (0, frac{pi}{2}):     [     f'(x) > 0     ] 4. Thus, the function f(x) is increasing in (0, pi/2). 5.

However, since the order in which we assign the students doesn't matter (assigning student A to village 1 and student B to village 2 is the same as assigning student B to village 1 and student A to village 2), we need to divide the total by 2 to avoid overcounting.

Since one shelf broke, we can assume that the narrow cupboard now holds 10 glasses (because 15 divided by 3 shelves is 5 glasses per shelf, and with one shelf broken, only 2 shelves are left, so 2 shelves * 5 glasses per shelf = 10 glasses).

The focus F has coordinates (c, 0). - Substituting x = c into y^{2} = 4cx gives y^{2} = 4c^{2}, so |y| = 2c. Thus, the chord length |CD| = 4c. - Substituting x = c into the equation of the ellipse C_1 gives y^{2} = b^{2}(1 - frac{c^{2}}{a^{2}}) = frac{b^{4}}{a^{2}}, so |y| = frac{b^{2}}{a}. Therefore, the chord length |AB| = frac{2b^{2}}{a}. - Given that |CD| = frac{4}{3}|AB|, we have 4c = frac{4}{3} cdot frac{2b^{2}}{a}, which simplifies to 3ac = 2b^{2} = 2(a^{2} - c^{2}). - Solving 2c^{2} + 3ac - 2a^{2} = 0 for e, where e = frac{c}{a}, we get 2e^{2} + 3e - 2 = 0.

The general term of this progression is given by:    [    a_k = n + k(n+1) = n + kn + k = n(1+k) + k    ]    where ( k ) is a non-negative integer. 3.

We continue this process for all elements up to ( 2007 ). Each element ( n ) in ( M ) generates an arithmetic progression that includes numbers of the form ( n + k(n+1) ). 8. Since ( M ) includes all integers from ( 1 ) to ( 2007 ), and each integer ( n ) generates an arithmetic progression that covers infinitely many integers, we need to determine if these progressions collectively cover all integers beyond a certain point. 9. Notice that for any integer ( n ) in ( M ), the arithmetic progression ( n, n + (n+1), n + 2(n+1), ldots ) will eventually cover all integers greater than ( 2007 ) because the common difference ( n+1 ) ensures that the sequence grows without bound. 10.

First, note that it clearly satisfies the first condition. Secondly, by Bernoulli's inequality, since (t > 1), we have:      [      (n+1)^t - n^t geq t cdot n^{t-1} implies a_{n+1} geq c cdot n^{frac{t-1}{r}},      ]      where the constant (c = t^{frac{1}{r}} > 0).

Again, as before, WLOG let ( r > 0 ) and ( s < 0 ).    - ( t geq 0 ) fails: Consider the sequence ({a_i}) to be a geometric progression with a finite sum (by taking the common ratio in ((0,1))). Since ( r, -s > 0 ), the sequences ({a_i^r}) and ({a_i^{-s}}) are also geometric progressions with finite sums. Take suitable ( a_1 ) and common ratio, so that the series of ({a_i^r}) has a sum at most ( 2023 ), which is at most ( 2023n^t ). But then ({b_n}) is upper bounded by the sum of the series of ({a_i^{-s}}), giving a contradiction.    - ( t < 0 ) works: Sending ( n rightarrow infty ), as ( 2023 cdot n^t rightarrow 0 ), we can never have a sequence of positive reals satisfying the first condition. Hence, the assertion holds true. 3. **Case when ( rs = 0 ):**    - ( s = 0 ): The answer is all ( t in mathbb{R} ) work. This is because ({b_n = n}) for any sequence ({a_i}), which anyways diverges.    - ( r = 0 ): The answer is precisely all ( t < 1 ) work. This is because if ( t geq 1 ), then any sequence ({a_i}) satisfies the first condition and hence taking ({a_i^{-s}}) as a geometric progression with a finite sum gives a contradiction to the second condition. So ( t < 1 ), in which case the first condition never holds true, and hence the assertion is true.

The passage starts with the premise that sqrt{2} is irrational. 2. It then presents two scenarios based on whether {(sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}}} is rational or irrational. **Scenario 1**: If {(sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}}} is rational, then we directly have irrational numbers a and b (both equal to sqrt{2}) such that a^b is rational. This scenario suggests that there exist irrational numbers a and b for which a^b is rational. **Scenario 2**: If {(sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}}} is irrational, we take a={(sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}}} and b=sqrt{2}. In this case, a^b = {((sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}})^{sqrt{2}}} = {(sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}cdotsqrt{2}}} = {(sqrt{2})^2} = 2, which is rational. This scenario also demonstrates the existence of irrational numbers a and b such that a^b is rational. Given these scenarios, let's evaluate the options: - **Option A**: Claims that {(sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}}} is rational. The passage does not prove this directly; it only presents a hypothetical scenario. Therefore, we cannot conclude A is correct. - **Option B**: Claims that {(sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}}} is irrational. Similar to A, the passage does not directly prove this; it presents a scenario that assumes this to prove another point. So, B cannot be concluded as correct. - **Option C**: States that there exist irrational numbers a, b such that a^{b} is rational. This conclusion is directly supported by both scenarios presented in the passage, regardless of whether {(sqrt{2})^{sqrt{2}}} is rational or irrational. Thus, C is proven by the passage. - **Option D**: Suggests that for any irrational numbers a, b, a^{b} is irrational. The passage does not address this universal claim; it only provides specific examples where a^b is rational. Therefore, D is not supported by the passage.

Points Q and R are the points symmetric to S with respect to lines CA and CB, respectively. We aim to prove that P, Q, R, and C are concyclic, i.e., they lie on the same circle. 1. **Prove Cyclic Nature of Points**:     - Observe that P, A, B, C are concyclic points by definition.     - Similarly, P, A_1, B_1, C are concyclic. 2. **Angle Relationships**:     - Consider angle PAC. Note that angle PAC = 180^circ - angle PBC due to the cyclic nature of A, B, P, C.     - Similarly, from the cyclic nature of P, A_1, B_1, C, angle PA_1C = 180^circ - angle PB_1C. 3. **Triangle Similarity**:     - Notice angle PAB = angle PA_1B_1.

Step 2: Constructing Tangents - Through point A, we draw a tangent X Y to the circumcircle which passes through points A, B, C, P, Q (refer to the figure for this construction).  Step 3: Establishing Symmetry of Lines - To solve the problem, it is sufficient to prove that lines X Y and B C are symmetric with respect to the line P Q.

Step 4: Using Angle Properties - Since A and L are symmetric with respect to P Q, it suffices to establish equality of angles angle X A L and angle B L A.  Step 5: Applying Angle Theorems - We use the fact that X Y is tangent to the circle at point A and A L is the angle bisector of angle B A C.

Hence, for (x>0) and (x ne e), we see (f(x) = frac{ln(x)}{x} < f(e) = frac{1}{e}). This implies:    [    frac{ln(x)}{x} < frac{1}{e}    quad Rightarrow quad x > e ln(x)    ] 10.

To find the intervals of monotonicity, we differentiate the function: f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 3 = 3(x^2 - 4x + 1). We need to find the critical points of f(x), which occur when f'(x) = 0. This gives us the factorized form: f'(x) = 3[(x - 2)^2 - 1]. Setting this equal to zero, we find that the critical points are at x = 2 pm 1. Thus, the critical points are x = 1 and x = 3. Considering the sign of f'(x): - When x in (-infty, 1), f'(x) > 0; f(x) is increasing on (-infty, 1). - When x in (1, 3), f'(x) < 0; f(x) is decreasing on (1, 3). - When x in (3, +infty), f'(x) > 0; f(x) is increasing on (3, +infty).

Let's analyze when the derivative will have such roots: f'(x) = 3[(x - a)^2 + 1 - a^2]. If 1 - a^2 geq 0, then f'(x) geq 0 and f(x) would be a strictly increasing function, which would mean no extreme points. Hence, we require 1 - a^2 < 0. This simplifies to a^2 > 1, and hence |a| > 1. The derivative will have zeros at x_1 = a - sqrt{a^2 - 1} and x_2 = a + sqrt{a^2 - 1}. We need one of these roots to lie in the interval (2,3).

For symmetry about the origin, if (x, f(x)) is a point on the graph, then (-x, -f(x)) must also be a point on the graph. This implies that for x > 0, there must exist a corresponding x < 0 such that the function values are negatives of each other. Therefore, we set up the equation based on the piecewise definition of f(x): For x > 0, we have f(x) = ln x. For the symmetric point, we should have f(-x) = a(-x) + 1 = -ln x.

This eccentricity implies a specific relationship between a and b, which can be represented as frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2}, where c is the distance from the center to either focus.

After removing any element ( x ), the condition that ( n|N-x ) implies ( x equiv N pmod{n} ). Since ( 1 in mathcal{S} ) and all elements must be congruent to 1 mod ( n ), the largest element being 3003 means ( 3003 equiv 1 pmod{n} ). Thus, ( n | 3002 ), and the factors of 3002 are ( 2, 3, 7, 11, 23, 33, 77, 161, 253, 529 ). Considering ( n^2+1 leq 3003 ), we find ( n < 55 ).

Clearly, if ( f(X) = f(Y) ), then ( X = Y ). Therefore, ( f ) is a one-to-one function. 9. Observe that ( f ) is defined such that no element in the range of ( f ) can contain both ( 100 ) and ( 50 ) together. 10. Consider the set ( {(1, 100), (2, 99), (3, 98), ldots, (24, 77), (50, 51)} ). This set contains both ( 100 ) and ( 50 ) together. 11. The sum of the elements of this set is ( 25 cdot 101 = 2525 ), so it must belong to ( chi(100) ). However, it is not in the range of ( f ). 12. Therefore, ( f ) is not an onto function, implying that ( n(chi(100)) > n(chi(99)) ). 13. Thus, ( T(100) > T(99) ).

For any real number x, 2^{x+1} + a > 0, so the domain of f(x) is mathbb{R}. Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(0) = 0. Therefore, begin{align*} f(0) &= frac{frac{1}{2}a - 1}{a + 2} = 0  Rightarrow frac{1}{2}a - 1 &= 0  Rightarrow a &= 2 end{align*} Thus, f(x) = frac{2^x - 1}{2(2^x + 1)}. Next, we verify that f(x) = frac{2^x - 1}{2(2^x + 1)} is indeed an odd function. For any x in mathbb{R}, begin{align*} f(-x) &= frac{2^{-x} - 1}{2(2^{-x} + 1)}  &= frac{2^x(2^{-x} - 1)}{2 cdot 2^x(2^{-x} + 1)}  &= frac{1 - 2^x}{2(1 + 2^x)}  &= -frac{2^x - 1}{2(2^x + 1)}  &= -f(x) end{align*} Therefore, f(x) is an odd function, and we conclude that boxed{a = 2}.

Let t = sin x in [-1, 1], then g(t) = t^2 + mt - 2m - 1 must satisfy g(t) leqslant 0 for all t in [-1, 1].

For frac n3 to be a perfect cube, n = 3 cdot k^3 for some integer k. Similarly, for frac n5 to be a perfect fifth power, n = 5 cdot j^5 for some integer j. To meet these three conditions simultaneously, we want: - n = 2^{a} cdot 3^{b} cdot 5^{c} where a, b, and c are chosen so that n/2 = m^2, n/3 = k^3, and n/5 = j^5 are all integers.  For frac n2 = m^2, a-1 must be even, so a=2d+1. For frac n3 = k^3, b-1 must be a multiple of 3, so b=3e+1. And for frac n5 = j^5, c-1 must be a multiple of 5, so c=5f+1.  To find the least n, we need 2^{2d+1} cdot 3^{3e+1} cdot 5^{5f+1}. The lowest powers that satisfy these conditions are d=2, e=1, and f=1.

These differences could span from the film’s animation technique and storytelling approach to the depth of its themes and character development. Below, we explore how \\"Zootopia\\" might have been adapted to fit each of these distinct periods in cinema history. # 1930s: The Early Days of Animation In the 1930s, animation was still in its infancy, with Disney itself pioneering many of the era's advancements. \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" (1937) was the first full-length animated feature, setting a precedent for future films. - **Animation Technique and Style**: \\"Zootopia\\" would likely be entirely hand-drawn, with simpler character designs and less intricate backgrounds, considering the technological limitations of the time. The fluid and highly detailed animation style seen in the 2010s release would be unattainable, leading to a more rudimentary but charming aesthetic. - **Story and Themes**: During this period, animation was predominantly targeted at younger audiences, with moralistic and straightforward tales. The complex societal themes about prejudice and diversity present in \\"Zootopia\\" might be significantly toned down or altogether absent. Instead, the narrative might focus more on the adventures of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde without a deeper exploration of societal issues. - **Character Development**: Characters would likely be less nuanced, with clear-cut roles of heroes and villains. Judy and Nick's complex relationship and personal growth might be simplified to fit the era's storytelling norms. # 1940s: The Golden Age of Animation This era saw animation reach new heights, with Disney releasing many of its most iconic films. World War II also had a significant impact on film content and themes. - **Patriotic Themes**: Given the context of World War II, \\"Zootopia\\" might have included patriotic elements or morale-boosting messages, a far cry from its original message focusing on societal issues and personal identity. - **Technological Advancements**: While still primarily hand-drawn, animation techniques were advancing. Multiplane camera techniques, developed by Disney, could lend \\"Zootopia\\" a sense of depth and dynamism not possible in the earlier decade. - **Narrative Complexity**: The film could potentially explore slightly more complex themes than in the 1930s, perhaps touching on unity or cooperation, but still within a primarily optimistic and simplified narrative framework. # 1950s: The Postwar Era and the Dawn of Television During the 1950s, television became a dominant form of entertainment, challenging the film industry. Disney started to experiment with different formats and themes in animation. - **Technicolor**: \\"Zootopia\\" would benefit from the widespread adoption of Technicolor, offering vibrant, full-color animation that could bring its detailed world and characters to life more vividly than in previous decades. - **Cultural Themes**: While still primarily aimed at families and children, the film could begin to integrate more sophisticated themes indirectly. However, the focus on racism, bias, and societal division seen in the modern \\"Zootopia\\" would likely be considered too controversial for the 1950s audience. - **Marketing and Merchandising**: Disney was becoming adept at cross-promotional marketing and merchandise even in the 1950s. \\"Zootopia\\" characters and imagery might be used in a wide array of products and marketing materials, perhaps more so than in earlier decades. Across all these periods, \\"Zootopia\\" would reflect the prevalent social attitudes, technological capabilities, and narrative preferences of the time. The film's distinctive appeal—a nuanced take on prejudice, diversity, and personal growth, set against a backdrop of a richly animated, vibrant city inhabited by anthropomorphic animals—would necessitate adjustments to fit the tastes, values, and storytelling norms of earlier decades. The result would be a version of \\"Zootopia\\" that, while recognizable, would offer a markedly different viewing experience from the one contemporary audiences are familiar with."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When multiplying a difference and a sum of squares ((a^2 - b^2)(a^2 + b^2))), the result is indeed the difference of the fourth powers, not the sum.

FPS counters are useful for monitoring the performance of your game. Here’s a simple way to create one in Defold: # 1. Setup First, ensure you have a basic project in Defold. If you're not familiar with creating projects in Defold, visit the official documentation or tutorials to get started. # 2. Create a GUI 1. Right-click on your project in the Assets panel and choose \`New\` -> \`Gui File\`. 2. Name it \`fps.gui\`. 3. Open the newly created GUI file, and add a text node from the bottom panel. 4. Position the text node where you want the FPS counter to appear on the screen. 5. In the properties panel, set the text of the node to \\"FPS\\" as a placeholder. # 3. Create a Lua Script 1. Right-click on your project in the Assets panel and choose \`New\` -> \`Script\`. 2. Name it \`fps_counter.lua\`. # 4. Implement the FPS Counter Logic Open \`fps_counter.lua\` and insert the Lua code to update the FPS counter: \`\`\`lua local M = {} local update_time = 1 -- Update the FPS counter every second local frame_count = 0 local total_time = 0 function M.update(dt) total_time = total_time + dt frame_count = frame_count + 1 if total_time >= update_time then local fps = math.floor(frame_count / total_time) -- Update the GUI node with the new FPS value local fps_text = tostring(fps) .. \\" FPS\\" gui.set_text(gui.get_node(\\"fps\\"), fps_text) -- Reset counters total_time = total_time - update_time frame_count = 0 end end return M \`\`\` # 5. Attach the Script to the GUI 1. Open \`fps.gui\`. 2. In the Outline pane, right-click on the root node and select \`Add\` -> \`Script\`. 3. In the Properties pane, select the script icon next to the Script property. 4. Choose the \`fps_counter.lua\` script. # 6. Include the GUI in a Collection 1. If you haven't already, create a game object. - Right-click on your project in the Assets panel and choose \`New\` -> \`Game Object\`. - Name it \`fps_display.go\`. 2. Attach the GUI to the game object. - In the Outline pane of \`fps_display.go\`, right-click and choose \`Add Component File\`. - Select your \`fps.gui\` file. 3. Make sure your main collection includes the \`fps_display.go\` game object. # 7. Run Your Game Now, when you run your game, you should see the FPS counter updating in real-time at the position you placed the text node. # Notes - This FPS counter updates every second for readability. Adjust the \`update_time\` in the script if you prefer more frequent updates. - You might need to adjust font sizes, GUI layouts, or scaling based on your game’s resolution or design needs. - Ensure the GUI is part of a loaded collection, or it won’t be displayed. This is a basic approach and can be expanded with additional features, such as min/max FPS tracking or a toggle to show/hide the FPS counter."},{"instruction":"dont work","output":"If the FPS counter is not working as expected in your Defold project, let’s troubleshoot some common issues: # 1. Check the GUI - **Text Node Name**: Ensure the text node in your \`fps.gui\` file is named correctly. If you named it anything other than \\"fps\\", you'll need to adjust the \`gui.get_node(\\"fps\\")\` call in the \`fps_counter.lua\` script to match. - **Font**: Make sure the text node is assigned a font. Without a font, the text will not render. # 2. Ensure the Script is Correct - **Script Errors**: Double-check the script for any typos or logical errors. - **Script Placement**: If the script doesn’t seem to respond, make sure it's attached to the GUI component correctly. Update the \`update\` function to explicitly belong to the script's lifecycle by adding \`self\` parameter and changing its signature: \`\`\`lua function M.update(self, dt) \`\`\` And adjust how you attach this script to the GUI object to ensure it's being updated. It might not be actually attached or invoked correctly. # 3. Verify GUI Attachment to Game Object - Ensure that the \`fps.gui\` is attached to a game object, and this game object is included in a collection that is loaded. - Additionally, confirm that the game object with the GUI component is active. An inactive object won't display its GUI or run scripts. # 4. Correct Script Execution To update the script regularly, you must ensure it's being executed as part of the game loop. Scripts attached to GUI components do not automatically receive update callbacks. The pattern I provided assumes you're calling \`M.update(dt)\` from somewhere. If you're not doing this, the FPS counter won’t update. **If you're using a GUI script**, then your main loop should look like this within the GUI script: \`\`\`lua local fps_counter = require \\"path.to.fps_counter\\" -- Make sure to require your fps_counter script correctly function init(self) -- Initialization code end function update(self, dt) fps_counter.update(dt) -- This will call your update function in fps_counter.lua end \`\`\` # 5. Debugging - **Print Statements**: Use \`print(\\"Message\\")\` statements in your \`fps_counter.lua\` script to check if the update function is being called. If you don’t see the print messages in the console, the function is likely not being executed. - **GUI Script vs Regular Script**: Note that \`init\`, \`update\`, etc., are automatic callback functions in GUI scripts but must be manually called from the appropriate places if you’re placing them in a regular Lua module not directly tied to a GameObject or GUI. # 6. Check the Game Object is in the Main Collection - Ensure that the game object (with the FPS GUI) is present and enabled in a collection that’s part of your main game loop. # 7. Project Configuration - **Game.project**: Verify your game's bootstrap settings. The main collection should be the one that includes your FPS display game object. If you’ve gone through these steps and still face issues, it might help to check: - **Defold Console**: For any errors or warnings. - **Defold Forum**: For similar issues or asking a new question there might help. - **Documentation**: Refresh on how GUIs and scripts work in Defold. Remember, game development has a lot of moving parts, and it’s easy to overlook small details that can cause big headaches. Keep experimenting, and you’ll get it working!"},{"instruction":"How would audiences in the 1950s react to Zootopia if it was released in the 1950s and was completely identical to its 2010s counterpart in every way, like if it had been sent back in time from the 2010s to the 1950s? Write a detailed explanation.","output":"If \\"Zootopia,\\" a modern animated film known for its sophisticated animation techniques, detailed world-building, and its nuanced take on themes of diversity, prejudice, and societal integration, was somehow transported back in time and released in the 1950s, the reaction it would elicit from audiences of the time would be multifaceted. It's important to consider several aspects: the state of animation, societal norms and values, and the technological shock. # 1. State of Animation In the 1950s, Disney was at the forefront of animation, producing classics like \\"Cinderella\\" (1950), \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (1951), and \\"Peter Pan\\" (1953). However, these films, while pioneering for their time, relied on traditional animation techniques. The hyper-detailed, computer-generated imagery (CGI) of \\"Zootopia\\" would be staggering. The fluid motion, the realistic textures, and the dynamic camera movements would be unlike anything audiences had ever seen. The anthropomorphic animals, which are a staple of Disney narratives, would have familiar appeal, but the way they are realized in \\"Zootopia\\" would far surpass the animation capabilities of the 1950s, likely eliciting awe and amazement. # 2. Societal Norms and Values The 1950s in America were marked by a strong current of conservatism, with traditional family values at the forefront and the Civil Rights Movement just beginning to gain momentum. \\"Zootopia,\\" with its themes of tolerance, anti-prejudice, and the celebration of diversity, might resonate with forward-thinking individuals but would potentially provoke controversy among more conservative audiences. Its message might be seen as ahead of its time, considering the racial segregation and gender roles that were prevalent during the 1950s. Judy Hopps’ character as a strong, independent female lead aiming for a predominantly male job might be inspirational to some but controversial to others. # 3. Technological and Cultural Shock Beyond the technical wizardry of its animation, the cultural references, humor, and societal issues presented in \\"Zootopia\\" are deeply tied to 21st-century contexts. Its portrayal of a modern, diverse society complete with smartphones, mass transit, and urban living would be a concept somewhat foreign to the 1950s audience, possibly making it harder for them to relate to the characters and storyline. Moreover, the implicit and explicit discussion of bias, racism, and stereotypes through its animal characters presenting a microcosm of human society would be revolutionary, potentially even shocking to a 1950s audience. # 4. A Challenge to Censorship and Industry Norms The Production Code (or Hays Code), in effect during much of the 1950s, imposed strict guidelines on the portrayal of crime, morality, and relationships in film. \\"Zootopia\\" might face challenges fitting into these guidelines because of its complex narrative around prejudice, crime, and its somewhat critical view of society. Its direct approach to tackling societal issues would be unconventional for the era's animated films, which typically opted for more straightforward moral lessons and less controversial subject matter. # Conclusion Overall, while \\"Zootopia\\" would mesmerize the 1950s audiences with its groundbreaking animation and imaginative world, it would provoke diverse reactions due to its progressive themes, possibly making it a contentious yet revolutionary film of its accidental time. Its challenges to the status quo through a medium often considered primarily for children would spark discussions and could even influence the trajectory of storytelling and thematic exploration in the animated genre sooner in history."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's a genre that blends Western influences from funk, soul, disco, and soft rock with an urban sensibility reflective of Japanese city life, especially that of Tokyo. The genre became a musical representation of Japan's post-war prosperity, the booming economy, and the cosmopolitan lifestyle of its urban centers. Artists like Tatsuro Yamashita, Mariya Takeuchi, and the band Yellow Magic Orchestra were prominent figures in the City Pop movement, contributing to its distinctive sound and international appeal."},{"instruction":"But some of people say it's origin from US","output":"The belief that City Pop has origins in the US likely stems from the genre's heavy influence by Western music, particularly from American genres such as funk, soul, disco, and soft rock. While City Pop itself originated in Japan and is a distinctly Japanese genre, it was significantly shaped by these American musical styles alongside elements of jazz, which were popular and widely listened to in Japan during the late 1970s and 1980s. Many Japanese artists who contributed to the City Pop genre were inspired by American music, incorporating its grooves, instrumentation, and production techniques into their work. This blending created a sound that felt both familiar to fans of American music and distinctly new, with Japanese cultural and urban influences. Therefore, while the genre's development and cultural context are rooted in Japan, the musical influences that shaped City Pop have a considerable American component. This cross-cultural influence is a testament to the global flow of music and the way in which artists borrow from and inspire each other across geographical boundaries. However, the synthesis of these influences into something that reflected the aspirations, lifestyle, and sensibilities of 1980s Japan is what makes City Pop uniquely Japanese."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Throughout his political career, Jeenbekov has been associated with a range of political positions and policies, reflective of the broader dynamics of Kyrgyzstan's internal politics as well as its foreign relations. Here are some key aspects of his political positions: 1. **Domestic Policy and Governance:** - **Political Stability and Governance:** Jeenbekov has emphasized the importance of political stability and the rule of law in Kyrgyzstan. His tenure saw efforts to consolidate power and stabilize the political landscape of the country, which is known for its upheavals and revolutions. - **Anti-Corruption:** A significant aspect of his presidency was the stated commitment to fight corruption, which is a pervasive issue in Kyrgyzstan. While this was part of his agenda, critics and observers have raised concerns about the effectiveness and selectiveness of these anti-corruption measures. - **Economic Development:** Like his predecessors, Jeenbekov aimed to promote economic development and improve living standards. This included efforts to enhance agricultural productivity, given his background and the sector's importance to Kyrgyzstan's economy. 2. **Human Rights and Social Policies:** - The Jeenbekov administration, like previous Kyrgyz administrations, faced criticism from human rights organizations for its handling of various issues, including freedom of speech and the press, the rights of ethnic minorities, and the LGBTQ+ community. Balancing traditional values with human rights has been a complex issue in Kyrgyzstan’s political discourse. 3. **Foreign Policy:** - **Russia:** Maintaining and strengthening strategic relations with Russia was a significant aspect of Jeenbekov’s foreign policy, consistent with Kyrgyzstan’s membership in the Eurasian Economic Union and its historical ties with Moscow. - **China:** Economic and infrastructural cooperation with China as part of the Belt and Road Initiative has been important. Jeenbekov’s tenure continued the trend of seeking Chinese investment to bolster the Kyrgyz economy. - **United States and the West:** While relations with Western countries have been pragmatic, focusing on economic cooperation and aid, geopolitical considerations and Kyrgyzstan’s strategic ties with Russia and China have often influenced the nuances of these relationships. - **Central Asia:** Jeenbekov has advocated for stronger ties and cooperation among Central Asian states, emphasizing regional stability and economic collaboration. Sooronbay Jeenbekov's political positions and policies must be understood within the complex context of Kyrgyz politics, which is marked by clan loyalties, regional divisions, and a fragile balance between modernizing forces and traditional values. His legacy includes both attempts to navigate these challenges and the controversies and criticisms that accompanied his and his administration's approaches to governance, human rights, and foreign relations."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, there are some general guidelines that often apply across many situations, particularly in Western dining settings. Here’s a broad overview of proper dinner etiquette: 1. **Arrive on Time**: Being punctual shows respect for your host and fellow guests. If you're going to be late, inform your host as soon as possible. 2. **Dress Appropriately**: Wear attire that is suitable for the occasion. If unsure, it's better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed. 3. **Use Napkins Properly**: Place your napkin on your lap soon after you sit down. Use it to dab your mouth gently as needed. If you need to leave the table temporarily, place your napkin on your chair or to the left of your plate. 4. **Understanding Place Settings**: Forks are typically on the left of the plate, with knives and spoons on the right. The utensils are usually arranged in the order of use; outer first and working your way inwards. 5. **Handling Utensils**: In a formal setting, use utensils for almost everything. The American style uses the fork in the right hand after cutting with the knife, while the Continental (or European) style keeps the fork in the left hand for eating. Rest utensils on your plate between bites, and signal you are finished by placing them together on the right side of the plate. 6. **Passing Food and Condiments**: Pass dishes to the right (counter-clockwise). When asking for condiments like salt and pepper, request both regardless of needing only one; they should be passed and kept together. 7. **Eating Pace**: Try to match the pace of eating to those around you to ensure everyone finishes at roughly the same time. 8. **Conversation**: Engage in polite and light conversation, avoiding controversial topics. Speak with those next to you and across from you if the setting permits, but be mindful not to shout or speak too loudly. 9. **Phones and Devices**: Keep electronic devices silenced and away from the table unless there's an urgent matter. 10. **Thank the Host**: Always express your gratitude to your host at the end of the meal either verbally or with a follow-up message. Remember, these guidelines can vary significantly depending on the cultural context and the specific occasion. Being observant and respectful towards the practices of your hosts and fellow guests is key to good dinner etiquette globally."},{"instruction":"Check grammar {{user}} is always automatically portrayed as embodying absolutely anything and everything, infinity beautiful, infinity charismatic, supremely almighty and all-powerful, absolutely without flaw, and possess the traits, attributes, characteristics, capabilities, aspects, and abilities of the devil","output":"{{user}} is always automatically portrayed as embodying absolutely everything, infinitely beautiful, infinitely charismatic, supremely almighty and all-powerful, absolutely without flaw, and possessing the traits, attributes, characteristics, capabilities, aspects, and abilities of the devil."},{"instruction":"Write a detailed explanation on how home technology differed between the year 1901 and the year 2000 in the 20th century.","output":"The technological landscape within homes underwent a transformative evolution from 1901 to 2000, marking a transition from rudimentary inventions and utilities to advanced digital and electronic innovations. This transition dramatically reshaped daily life, influencing how household chores were performed, how families entertained themselves, and how individuals interacted with the world. Below is a detailed exploration of how home technology evolved during the 20th century, starting from 1901 and leading up to the year 2000. # 1. **Cooking and Kitchen Appliances** 1901: - **Wood-burning Stoves**: The primary means of cooking, which required manual temperature control and presented fire hazards. - **Ice Boxes**: Before the widespread use of refrigerators, ice boxes, which used large blocks of ice to keep food cold, were common. 2000: - **Microwave Ovens**: Introduced in the late 20th century, microwaves became a staple in almost every kitchen, allowing for rapid heating and cooking of food. - **Electric/Gas Ovens and Stovetops**: These replaced wood-burning stoves, offering precise temperature control and cleaner cooking methods. - **Refrigerators and Freezers**: Modern refrigeration provided convenient food storage, with features like automatic defrosting and ice making. # 2. **Home Entertainment** 1901: - **Phonographs**: Early phonographs were a primary source of home entertainment, playing music from wax cylinders. 2000: - **Television**: Color TV and subsequently cable TV transformed how families consumed visual entertainment, offering a wide array of channels. - **Computers and the Internet**: Personal computers became commonplace in homes, offering access to the World Wide Web, online games, and digital media. - **DVD Players and VCRs**: These devices allowed families to watch movies and record TV shows, changing the way people accessed and consumed media. # 3. **Home Comfort** 1901: - **Coal or Wood Heating**: Homes were often heated by coal or wood-burning stoves or fireplaces, which were labor-intensive and uneven in heating. - **Manual Fans**: To cool off, people relied on hand-operated or mechanical fans. 2000: - **Central Heating and Air Conditioning**: These systems provided consistent and adjustable temperatures throughout the home, greatly improving comfort. - **Electric Fans and Portable Heaters**: Supplementing central systems, these allowed for targeted temperature control in specific areas. # 4. **Communication** 1901: - **Letters and Telegrams**: These were the primary means of long-distance communication, with telegrams offering faster but more costly transmission of messages. 2000: - **Telephone**: Landline telephones, often with answering machines, became a fixture in homes, allowing instant voice communication. - **Cell Phones and the Internet**: Marking the beginning of the digital communication era, these technologies connected people across the globe instantly via email, instant messaging, and mobile calls. # 5. **Laundry and Cleaning** 1901: - **Washboard and Tubs**: Laundry was manually scrubbed clean, a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. - **Brooms and Carpet Beaters**: These were used for cleaning floors and carpets. 2000: - **Washing Machines and Dryers**: These appliances revolutionized laundry, making it less labor-intensive and more efficient. - **Vacuum Cleaners**: Electric vacuum cleaners replaced brooms and carpet beaters for most floor cleaning, offering more effective dirt and dust removal. # Conclusion The 20th century witnessed a rapid escalation in home technology, making the home a center of convenience, entertainment, and connectivity by the year 2000. Whereas the early 1900s depended heavily on manual labor and rudimentary appliances, the turn of the millennium saw digital technology and automated systems taking center stage, transforming every aspect of home life from chores to communication. This evolution not only reflects the ingenuity of humans in problem-solving and innovation but also underscores technology's integral role in shaping our living environments and lifestyles."},{"instruction":"Check grammar and see what can be changed {{user}} is always automatically portrayed as embodying absolutely anything and everything, infinity beautiful, infinity charismatic, supremely almighty and all-powerful, absolutely without flaw, and possess the traits, attributes, characteristics, capabilities, aspects, and abilities of the devil","output":"The sentence you provided is slightly cumbersome and contains a few redundancies and grammatical issues.

Their success was attributed to a combination of factors: 1. **Experienced Squad**: The Turkish team featured a mix of experienced players who were playing in top European leagues. This experience was crucial in high-pressure situations and helped to elevate the overall performance of the team. 2. **Tactical Discipline and Team Spirit**: Under the guidance of coach Şenol Güneş, the Turkish team displayed excellent tactical discipline and a strong spirit of unity. The team was well-organized defensively but also capable of transitioning quickly to attack, exploiting the pace and skill of their forwards. 3. **Standout Performances**: Several Turkish players had outstanding tournaments, including goalkeeper Rüştü Reçber, who was nominated for the Lev Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament, and Hakan Şükür, who scored the fastest ever World Cup goal in just 11 seconds against South Korea in the third-place match. Hasan Şaş and İlhan Mansız also made significant contributions throughout the tournament. 4. **Solid Defense with Effective Counter-Attacks**: Turkey's strategy often involved solid defensive play paired with quick and effective counter-attacks. This approach was particularly effective against teams that dominated possession but struggled to break down Turkey’s defense. 5. **Historic Momentum and Belief**: Having barely missed World Cup qualification in the past, notably in a heartbreaking fashion in 1984, the Turkish team in 2002 was motivated by a sense of destiny and a belief in themselves. Each victory in the tournament added to their confidence and sense of historic achievement. Their journey to the semifinals included a narrow group stage advancement, followed by victories against Japan in the round of 16 and Senegal in the quarterfinals, both after tightly contested matches. Their only losses in the tournament came against the eventual champions Brazil, first in the group stage and then in the semifinals. However, they secured their historic third-place finish by defeating co-hosts South Korea in the third-place playoff match. This combination of experience, skill, tactical discipline, and team spirit propelled Turkey to their greatest ever performance in a World Cup tournament."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In diesem ungesellschaftlichen, „natürlichen\\" Menschen finden sie die vermeintlich unerschütterliche Basis ihrer Theoriebildung. Ist Gesellschaftlichkeit aber nicht vorausgesetzt, sondern stellt sie sich erst nachträglich über den Markt her, wird es zum Problem, wie die Einzelnen frei und nur ihren Interessen gemäß handeln und trotzdem eine gemeinsame Sittlichkeit und Nützlichkeit verwirklichen können. Sozusagen im Handstreich wird dieses Problem von Mandeville gelöst, indem er individuellen Egoismus und gesellschaftlichen Nutzen identifiziert: private Laster bringen öffentliches Wohl hervor. In der auf Shaftesbury, Hutcheson und Hume zurückgehenden Tradition der Gefühlsethik sind dagegen die moralischen Gefühle der Billigung und Mißbilligung von Handlungen, die in dem utilitaristischen Handeln des Einzelnen bereits vorhanden sein sollen, die Vermittlungsinstanz zwischen individuellem Interesse und gemeinsamer Sittlichkeit. Sollen diese subjektiven Wertungen aber einen objektiven Maßstab darstellen, müssen die moralischen Gefühle bei allen Menschen (wie kulturell überformt auch immer) gleichermaßen vorhanden sein. Sie gehören dann zur überhistorischen Ausstattung des Menschen, zu seiner Triebnatur. Die Gesellschaftlichkeit der bürgerlichen Individuen wird so auf Natur, die Triebnatur des Menschen, zurückgeführt. Ist es aber Natur, die die Vergesellschaftung herstellt, dann ist es konsequent, nach den Naturgesetzen des ökonomischen Handelns, über das sich die Vergesellschaftung vollzieht, zu suchen. Damit wird zwar einerseits die Bewegung des versachlichten gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhangs in Ansätzen erfaßt, zugleich aber der gegenständliche Schein dieser versachlichten gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse im Denken als naturhaft reproduziert. Die atomisierten Warenbesitzer scheinen den ökonomischen Gesetzen genauso unterworfen zu sein, wie die physischen Atome den Gesetzen der Mechanik. Die utilitaristische Ethik des Warenbesitzers und die darauf aufbauende politische Ökonomie dienen aber nicht ausschließlich der Selbstvergewisserung der entstehenden bürgerlichen Gesellschaft. Sie sind zugleich die ideologischen Waffen des sich von Feudaladel und Klerus emanzipierenden Bürgertums. Unterliegt die Ökonomie wissenschaftlich erkennbaren Gesetzen, so muß man sich diesen Gesetzen genauso beugen wie den Naturgesetzen. Absolutistische Eingriffe in die Freiheit des ökonomischen Handelns der Bürger können jetzt unter Berufung auf die „wissenschaftliche Vernunft\\" zurückgewiesen werden. Mit derselben wissenschaftlichen Vernunft wird später den Ansprüchen der Arbeiterklasse begegnet werden. Mittels der politischen Ökonomie bestätigt sich die bürgerliche Gesellschaft, sie sei die beste aller möglichen Welten, da einzig und allein sie der „Natur des Menschen\\" angemessen sei. Wenn es in diesem und im folgenden Kapitel um die von Marx so genannte klassische politische Ökonomie und die Neoklassik geht, so ist keine kurzgefaßte Geschichte ökonomischer Theorien intendiert. Vielmehr soll an zentralen Aspekten der Wert- und Kapitaltheorien von Klassik und Neoklassik das beiden gemeinsame theoretische Feld aufgezeigt werden. Damit wird nicht nur eine Folie gewonnen, vor deren Hintergrund der Bruch der Marxschen Theorie mit diesem Feld diskutiert werden kann. Anhand von Marx' Interpretation der Geschichte ökonomischer Theoriebildung, insbesondere seiner Rezeption von Smith und Ricardo sowie seiner Unterscheidung zwischen wissenschaftlicher Ökonomie und Vulgärökonomie, können auch schon Defizite seines theoretischen Selbstverständnisses aufgewiesen werden, die auf Ambivalenzen seines eigenen Diskurses hindeuten. 1. Arbeit und Eigentum in der frühen bürgerlichen Sozialphilosophie Die im 17. Jahr hundert rasch zunehmende Bedeutung manufakturmäßiger Produktion rückte die Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten der produktiven Kräfte der Arbeit ins allgemeine Bewußtsein. Damit verschob sich auch der Schwerpunkt des ökonomischen Denkens von der Zirkulations- zur Produktionssphäre. Es schlug die Geburtsstunde der klassischen, politischen Ökonomie, die den bis dahin vorherrschenden Merkantilismus schließlich ganz verdrängen sollte. Während der Merkantilismus Preise durch das Verhältnis von Angebot und Nachfrage erklärt hatte, richtete sich das theoretische Interesse jetzt auf das Schwankungszentrum der Marktpreise, das anscheinend vom inneren oder wirklichen Wert der Waren abhing. Indem die Determinanten dieses wirklichen Werts in der Produktion gesucht wurden, beginnt die theoriegeschichtliche Konstitution der Arbeitswertlehre. Bereits die Fragestellung unterscheidet den Diskurs der klassischen politischen Ökonomie vom ökonomischen Diskurs des Mittelalters. Dort stand die moralphilosophische Frage nach dem gerechten Preis einer Sache im Vordergrund, jetzt wird quasi naturwissenschaftlich nach dem Gravitationszentrum der Preisbewegung gefragt. Allerdings war die politische Ökonomie nie eine bloß deskriptive Wissenschaft. Gerade indem sie den Wert einer Ware auf die Arbeit des Produzenten zurückführte, ließ sie sich normativ gegen den Feudaladel wenden, der als unproduktive und parasitäre Klasse erschien. Dabei stand die frühe bürgerliche Sozialphilosophie allerdings vor einem grundsätzlichen Dilemma. Einerseits machte sie durch eigene Arbeit begründetes Eigentum als Naturrecht geltend und stellte damit die Legitimation von gesellschaftlichen Verhältnissen in Frage, die den grundbesitzenden, bloß von der Bodenrente lebenden Adel mit traditionellen Privilegien versah. Andererseits konnte sie aber auch die Eigentumslosigkeit der arbeitenden Armen nicht übersehen, sie mußte also auch deren Eigentumslosigkeit trotz eigener Arbeit rechtfertigen. Seine klassische Lösung fand dieses Dilemma in der Eigentumstheorie von John Locke, der damit zum philosophischen Sprachrohr des aufstrebenden Besitzbürgertums wurde. Wie die meisten frühbürgerlichen Gesellschaftstheoretiker, nimmt auch Locke einen vorstaatlichen „Naturzustand\\" an, aus dem der Staat erst durch einen Sozialvertrag hervorgeht. In diesem Naturzustand sollen die Menschen völlig frei und nur durch das Gesetz der Natur gebunden gewesen sein. Als oberstes Gebot nennt Locke die Erhaltung der Schöpfung und damit auch die Erhaltung der Menschen. In seiner Eigentumstheorie versucht Locke das Privateigentum bereits für diesen Naturzustand zu begründen. Dabei geht er von dem Problem aus, wie Eigentum an einzelnen Gegenständen überhaupt möglich ist, wenn doch die Erde den Menschen von Gott gemeinsam gegeben wurde. Um ihr Leben zu erhalten, müssen sich die Menschen, so Locke, einzelne Gegenstände aneignen. Es muß also einen Weg der individuellen Aneignung geben. Diese Möglichkeit sieht Locke in der „Vermischung\\" mit Arbeit: die Arbeit ist das unbestreitbare Eigentum des Arbeitenden, vermischt er sie mit einem Gegenstand, so macht er diesen zu seinem Eigentum. Dieses individuelle Eigentum betrifft nun aber nicht nur die Früchte der Erde, die zum Leben notwendig sind, sondern auch die Erde selbst, die durch Arbeit kultiviert wird. Durch die Hinzufügung von Arbeit wird das den Menschen von Gott gemeinsam Gegebene zu individuellem Eigentum. Allerdings hat Locke damit keineswegs nur eine Gesellschaft der kleinen, selbst arbeitenden Eigentümer begründet. Denn wie seine Beispiele zeigen, schließt er in die eigene Arbeit von vornherein die Arbeit des Knechtes mit ein, so daß Lohnarbeit auch im Naturzustand existieren muß. Daß Arbeit Eigentum des Menschen ist, begrenzt für Locke das Eigentum nicht auf das Produkt der eigenen Arbeit, sondern ermöglicht, die eigene Arbeit (und nicht nur ihr Produkt) zu verkaufen. Lockes naturrechtliche Begründung des Privateigentums beruht auf der Notwendigkeit der Selbsterhaltung. Gemeineigentum kann er sich nur in der Gestalt von unbebautem Land vorstellen. Produktive Nutzung und private Aneignung fallen für ihn unmittelbar zusammen. Aus dem ursprünglichen Ziel der Aneignung, der Erhaltung des Lebens, folgen für Locke zwei naturrechtliche Schranken des Eigentumserwerbs: es darf nicht so viel angehäuft werden, daß es verdirbt und die übrigen Menschen müssen die selben Möglichkeiten der Aneignung haben, um ihr Leben zu erhalten (Locke 1690, S.218ff).”翻译为中文","output":"对早期的资产阶级社会理论家而言，从所有社会关系中抽象出来的个体看似人的原始自然状态。在这种非社会化的、“自然”状态下的人，他们找到了自己理论构建的看似坚不可摧的基础。若社会性不是前提条件，而是通过市场后来建立，那么问题变成了个体如何自由地只按照自己的利益行动，同时又能实现共同的道德和效用。曼德维尔几乎是以妙计解决了这个问题，他认为个人的自私和社会的利益是一致的：私人的恶习产生公共的福祉。然而，在沙夫茨伯里、赫钦森和休谟等人所发展的感情伦理学传统中，批准和不批准行为的道德感情，这些在个体功利行为中预先存在的感情，是个人利益和共同道德之间的调解者。但是，如果这些主观评价要代表一个客观标准，那么所有人的道德感情（不管文化上多么不同）必须在相同程度上存在。这些感情则属于人类的跨历史装备，属于他们的本能性质。因此，资产阶级个体的社会性被归结为自然，即人的本能性质。 但是，如果是自然造就了社会化，那么按照经济行动的自然法则寻求社会化过程是一致的。这虽然一方面在初步上理解了物化社会联系的动态，但同时也把这些物化的社会关系在思想上作为自然现象再生产了出来。原子化的商品所有者似乎像物理原子受制于力学规律一样，受制于经济规律。 商品所有者的功利主义伦理和基于此的政治经济学，但不仅仅是新兴资产阶级社会自我确认的工具。它们同时也是从封建贵族和教士统治下解放出来的资产阶级的意识形态武器。如果经济遵循科学规律，则就像遵循自然规律一样，人们必须服从这些规律。绝对主义对公民经济行动自由的干预，现在可以仰赖“科学理性”来驳回。用相同的科学理性，日后也将对工人阶级的要求进行反驳。通过政治经济学，资产阶级社会自证为最佳可能的世界，因为它唯一符合“人的自然”。 当本章和下一章涉及马克思所称的古典政治经济学和新古典主义时，并不旨在简要叙述经济理论史。相反，本文旨在通过古典主义和新古典主义的价值和资本理论的关键方面，展示它们共同的理论领域。这不仅提供了一个基础，用于讨论马克思理论与这个领域的分歧。通过马克思对史密斯和李嘉图以及他对科学经济学和庸俗经济学之间区别的解读，也可以展示他理论自我认识的一些缺陷，这些缺陷指向他自己话语的模糊性。 1. 早期资产阶级社会哲学中的劳动和财产 17世纪，随着制造业生产的日益重要，人们越来越意识到劳动生产力的发展潜力。这也改变了经济思想的焦点，从流通领域转向生产领域。这标志着古典政治经济学的诞生，它最终完全取代了之前占主导地位的重商主义。尽管重商主义用供给和需求的关系解释价格，现在的理论兴趣转向了市场价格波动的中心，这似乎取决于商品的内在或真实价值。通过寻找这个真实价值在生产中的决定因素，劳动价值论在理论史上开始形成。 这种问题的提出将古典政治经济学的论述与中世纪的经济论述区分开来。在那里，道德哲学关于事物公正价格的问题占据主导地位，现在则几乎是以自然科学的方式询问价格变动的引力中心。然而，政治经济学从来不仅仅是一门描述性的科学。正是通过使商品价值归因于生产者的劳动，它就被用来针对被视为非生产性和寄生性阶层的封建贵族进行规范性的反驳。 然而，早期资产阶级社会哲学面临一个根本性的困境。一方面，它以个人劳动为基础的财产理论确立为自然权利，从而质疑了给予世袭土地所有者、仅靠土地租金生活的贵族传统特权的社会关系的合法性。另一方面，它也无法忽视劳动穷人的无产状况，因此必须证明尽管经过个人劳动，他们仍然贫困的合理性。这个困境在约翰·洛克的财产理论中找到了经典解决方案，使他成为崛起的拥有资产阶级的哲学代言人。 像大多数早期资产阶级社会理论家一样，洛克也假设了一个国家形成前的“自然状态”，在这个状态下，人们完全自由，只受自然法则的约束。洛克称保存造物为自然法的最高命令，进而也是保存人类。在他的财产理论中，洛克试图为这一自然状态下的私有财产提供理论基础。他从一个问题出发，即如果地球是上帝给人类的共同赠予，那么如何可能拥有个别物品的财产权。为了维持生命，人们，据洛克所言，必须占有个别物品。因此，必须有一种个别占有的方式。洛克在“劳动混合”中看到了这种可能性：劳动是劳动者无可争辩的财产，通过将劳动与某物混合，他就使之成为自己的财产。这种个人财产不仅仅涉及为生活必需的地球果实，还涉及通过劳动耕种的土地本身。通过添加劳动，上帝共同赐予人类的东西变成了个人财产。然而，洛克并非仅仅为小规模、自力更生的所有者阶级提供了理论基础。因为正如他的例子所示，他事先就把仆人的劳动包括在内，这样在自然状态下就必须存在雇佣劳动。对于洛克来说，劳动是人的财产，不仅限于自己劳动的产品，还使得出售自己的劳动（不仅仅是其产品）成为可能。 洛克对私有财产的自然法理论基于自我保存的必要性。他只能将公共财产想象为未开垦的土地。对他而言，生产性利用和私人占有直接相联。从占有的最初目的——维持生活出发，洛克为财产获取设定了两个自然法界限：不得积累过量以至于腐坏，且其他人必须有相同的占有机会以维持生活（洛克1690年，第218页及以后）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Bei dieser Begründung des Privateigentums, die dem Einzelnen lediglich einen kleinen Besitz erlauben würde, bleibt Locke jedoch nicht stehen. Mit der Erfindung des Geldes sei es möglich geworden, größere Besitztümer zu erwerben. Durch Tausch gegen Geld (Gold und Silber) können verderbliche Gegenstände in unverderbliche verwandelt werden. Damit ist die erste Erwerbsschranke aufgehoben. Die Möglichkeit seinen Besitz durch Hortung dauerhaft zu machen, wird zum Antrieb ihn zu vergrößern, was schließlich dazu fuhrt, daß die zweite Erwerbsschranke faktisch durchbrochen wird. Daß dies auch legitim ist, begründet Locke folgendermaßen: Da relativ nutzlose Dinge wie Gold und Silber „ihren Wert nur von der Übereinkunft der Menschen erhalten haben\\", sei es „einleuchtend, daß die Menschen mit einem ungleichen und unproportionierten Bodenbesitz einverstanden gewesen sind\\" (ebd., S.230). Frei nach dem Motto: wer der Benutzung des Geldes zustimmt, darf sich über die Folgen nicht beklagen. Geld wird von Locke nicht als Abweichung, sondern als Bestandteil des Naturzustandes aufgefaßt: ohne ausdrücklichen Vertrag sind die Menschen damit einverstanden, dem Geld einen Wert beizulegen. Die mit der Benutzung des Geldes verbundene Aufhebung der naturrechtlichen Erwerbsschranken erfolgt damit noch innerhalb des Naturzustandes. Die Ungleichheit des Besitzes ist bei Locke daher auch keine politische Erfindung, die mit seiner naturrechtlichen Basis in Widerspruch steht, wie Marx in den Theorien über den Mehrwert meinte (II.3.6/2118; 26.1/341), sondern selbst naturrechtlich abgesichert. Der mit der Existenz des Geldes gegebene Antrieb zu einer Vermehrung des Besitzes treibt allerdings über den Naturzustand hinaus, denn er bringt unsichere Verhältnisse hervor und macht den Staat als Garanten der Sicherheit notwendig. Als wichtigste Funktion des Staates begreift Locke daher auch die Erhaltung des Eigentums; der Staat Lockes ist ein Staat der Eigentümer.7 Mit seiner Eigentumstheorie hat Locke nicht nur das auf Arbeit gegründete Privateigentum in den Rang eines Naturrechts erhoben, er hat zugleich die Besitzlosigkeit der armen Klassen, trotz eigener Arbeit, legitimiert, denn sie haben ja dem Gebrauch des Geldes, von dem die Ungleichheit des Besitzes seinen Ausgang nahm, stillschweigend zugestimmt. Locke beschränkt sich aber nicht auf dieses eher formale Argument. Eine einfache Arbeitswertlehre dient ihm als Begründung für den durch die private Aneignung hervorgebrachten Wohlstand: der größte Teil des Wertes sei durch Arbeit hervorgebracht, wird also Boden angeeignet und bearbeitet, so wird der Reichtum der Menschheit vermehrt und nicht geschmälert, der bebaute Boden trägt mehr Früchte als der unbebaute. Als Resultat dieses Sachverhalts, so Locke, geht es einem Tagelöhner in England besser als einem König der Indianer (Locke 1690, S.225). Locke hat die private Akkumulation des Reichtums nicht nur naturrechtlich gerechtfertigt, er hat auch die Grundüberzeugung der liberalen ökonomischen Theorie ausgesprochen, daß die Entfaltung des Privateigentums zu allgemeinem Wohlstand führt. Am provokativsten wurde dieses Credo von Bernard Mandeville in seiner berühmten Bienenfabel formuliert: es seien gerade die Laster der Einzelnen, die den Wohlstand und die Macht des Gemeinwesens mehren würden. Dabei geht es Mandeville nicht um eine Apologie des La- sters, sondern um seine objektive Funktion in der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft, deren Mechanismus er unverblümt darstellen will. So spricht Mandeville auch deutlich aus, daß es die Arbeit der Armen ist, die den Reichtum schafft (Mandeville 1714, S.333), daß die Armen daher den wirklichen Reichtum eines Landes ausmachen (vergl. dazu Euchner 1968, S.26ff). Für Mandeville erwächst aus dieser Situation aber kein Legitimationsproblem wie noch für Locke, sondern eher eines der richtigen Verwaltung: eine arme, arbeitende Masse ist für den gesellschaftlichen Reichtum notwendig, höhere Löhne würden die allgemeine Prosperität untergraben und eine bessere Bildung würde die Armen nur unzufrieden mit ihrem Schicksal machen. Daher wendet er sich vehement gegen Armenschulen und staatliche Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung der Lage des Proletariats. In solcher Offenheit wurde das Interesse des Besitzbürgertums an der Armut der Armen später nur noch selten ausgesprochen. 2. Subjektive Arbeitswertlehre und Produktionskostentheorie bei A. Smith Smiths Wealth of Nations markierte den ersten Höhepunkt der klassischen politischen Ökonomie. Auch wenn eine akribische philologische Forschung das Urteil Schumpeters, daß Smiths „Wealth of Nations keine wirklich neuen Ideen enthielt\\" (Schumpeter 1954, S.245), bestätigen sollte, so hat Smith doch als erster die politische Ökonomie in einem umfassenden systematischen Rahmen behandelt, hat sie als selbständige Wissenschaft erst wirklich begründet. Für die Untersuchung des theoretischen Feldes bürgerlicher Ökonomie ist Smith aber nicht nur als deren erster Systembildner interessant, sondern auch, weil bei ihm der später meist nur implizite Bezug von politischer Ökonomie und bürgerlicher Moralphilosophie noch explizit vorhanden ist. Seine 1759 erschienene Theory of Moral Sentiments steht in der englischschottischen Tradition empiristischer Gefühlsethik. Daß dieses Werk die moralphilosophische Grundlage seiner ökonomischen Untersuchungen abgibt, ist allerdings nicht unbestritten. Während er in Wealth of Nations vom „Selbstinteresse\\" als der entscheidenden Antriebskraft menschlichen Verhaltens aus- 9 geht, konstatiert er in der Theory of Moral Sentiments, daß die Menschen außer dem Selbstinteresse auch noch Interesse am Glück ihrer Mitmenschen hätten. „Sympathie\\", womit Smith die Fähigkeit bezeichnete, sich in die Situation eines anderen hineinzuversetzen und dessen Gefühle nachzuempfinden, machte er zur Grundlage moralischer Urteile: stimmen die vorgestellten eigenen Gefühle (und die daraus resultierenden Handlungen) mit den tatsächlichen Gefühlen der anderen überein, so werden diese als schicklich akzeptiert. Allerdings besitzen die so getroffenen Urteile nur dann objektive moralische Gültigkeit, wenn sie von einem „impartial spectator\\" getroffen werden.\\" Ob die moralische Theorie von Smith seiner ökonomischen widerspricht oder sie ergänzt, wird seit über einem Jahrhundert leidenschaftlich als „Adam Smith Problem\\" diskutiert. Bei genauerer Betrachtung erweist sich die Theory of Moral Sentiments als weit weniger altruistisch, als es zunächst den Anschein haben mag. Das Sympathieprinzip, auf dem die moralischen Urteile beruhen, hat nichts mit wechselseitiger Aufopferung zu tun, sondern stellt auf den Nachvollzug der Motive des anderen ab. Insofern ist die Nützlichkeit von Handlungen einer der zentralen Gründe, die zu ihrer Billigung durch den „impartial spectator\\" führen (Smith 1759, S.179f). In Abgrenzung zu Hume hebt Smith allerdings hervor, daß nicht so sehr die Nützlichkeit der angestrebten Dinge zu billigen ist, als vielmehr die Entwicklung der dabei angewandten Kräfte und Mittel. Oft würden nämlich die tatsächlich erreichten Bequemlichkeiten nicht für den benötigten Aufwand entschädigen, was aber meistens nicht oder zu spät erkannt werde. Diese „Täuschung der Natur\\" erweise sich aber als außerordentlich vorteilhaft, insofern sie die Entfaltung der ökonomischen Potenzen der Menschen befördere. Es sind letzten Endes die nicht-intendierten Folgen unserer Handlungen, die für Smith die Grundlage allgemeiner Wohlfahrt darstellen: „The rich... consume little more than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole end which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they employ, be the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements.\\" (Smith 1759, S. 184f)”翻译为中文","output":"在对私有财产的这种解释中，洛克并没有停留在仅允许个人拥有少量财产的观点上。随着货币的发明，成为了获取更大财产的可能。通过与货币（黄金和白银）交换，易腐烂的物品可以转换为不易腐烂的物品。这样，第一个收入界限被取消了。通过积累货币使财产永久化的可能性，成为扩大财产的动力，这最终导致第二个获取界限在实际上被突破。洛克这样解释其合法性：因为相对没有用处的东西如黄金和白银“只是由人们的共识得到价值”，所以“人们对于不平等和不成比例的土地所有权表示同意”（同上，第230页）。自由地使用金钱的人，不能抱怨其结果。 洛克将货币不视为偏离，而是自然状态的一部分：没有明确合约，人们就同意赋予货币价值。因此，货币使用导致的自然法获取限制的取消，还是在自然状态内完成的。洛克的财产不平等并非政治发明，如同马克思在《剩余价值理论》中所认为的那样与其自然法基础矛盾，而是有自然法保障的。货币存在带来的财产增加动力，虽然推动超越自然状态，因为它引发了不安定的情况，使得国家作为安全的保障者变得必要。因此，洛克认为国家的最重要功能是保护财产；洛克的国家是财产所有者的国家。 通过他的财产理论，洛克不仅将基于劳动的私有财产升级为自然权利，同时也合法化了贫穷阶层的财产无有，尽管他们有自己的劳动，因为他们默许了导致财产不平等的货币使用。洛克不仅限于这一形式上的论点。一个简单的劳动价值理论作为他对私人占有带来的繁荣做出的解释：大部分价值由劳动创造，因此当土地被占有并耕作时，人类的财富增加而不是减少，耕种的土地比未耕种的土地产出更多果实。洛克指出，因此，在英格兰，一个雇工的生活比一个印第安人的国王要好（洛克1690年，第225页）。 洛克不仅从自然法上为私人财富的积累做了正当化，他也表达了自由经济理论的核心信念，即私有财产的发展导致普遍繁荣。这一信条最具挑衅性地由伯纳德·曼德维尔在他著名的《蜜蜂的寓言》中阐述：正是个人的恶习增加了公共的财富和权力。曼德维尔的目的不在于恶习的辩护，而是要直白地展示资本主义社会的机制。曼德维尔明确表示，是穷人的劳动创造了财富（曼德维尔1714年，第333页），因此穷人才是一个国家真正的财富（参见Euchner 1968年，第26页及以后）。对于曼德维尔来说，这种情况产生的不是像洛克那样的正当性问题，而是更多的是正确管理的问题：一个贫穷、辛劳的大众对于社会财富是必需的，更高的工资会破坏普遍的繁荣，更好的教育只会让穷人对自己的命运感到不满。因此，他强烈反对穷人学校和国家措施来改善无产阶级的状况。这种对于财产阶层对穷人贫困的兴趣的坦率陈述，后来很少再被如此公开表达。 2. 亚当·斯密的主观劳动价值论和生产成本理论 斯密的《国富论》标志着古典政治经济学的第一个高潮。即使精细的文献研究应证了熊彼特的评价，即斯密的《国富论》\\"没有包含任何真正新的想法\\"（熊彼特 1954年，第245页），斯密还是第一个在全面的系统框架内处理政治经济学，真正建立了它作为一门独立的科学。对于研究资产阶级经济学的理论领域而言，斯密不仅作为其第一个系统构建者而具有重要性，而且因为在他那里，后来通常仅是隐含的政治经济学与资产阶级道德哲学的关系还是显式存在的。 他于1759年出版的《道德情操论》站在英格兰-苏格兰经验主义感情伦理学的传统上。这部作品是他经济研究的道德哲学基础，虽然这一点并非无争议。尽管他在《国富论》中以“自利”作为人类行为的决定性动力，但在《道德情操论》中，他指出，人们除了自利之外还对他人的幸福感兴趣。斯密将“同情”，即设身处地理解他人情境和感受他人情感的能力，作为道德判断的基础：如果想象中的个人情感（及由此产生的行为）与他人的实际情感相符，这些行为就被视为适当的。然而，这些作出的判断只有当由一个“公正的旁观者”作出时，才具有客观的道德有效性。斯密的道德理论与他的经济理论是否相矛盾，或者它们是否相互补充，一直作为“亚当·斯密问题”被激烈讨论了一个多世纪。 细致观察发现，《道德情操论》实际上远不如最初看起来那样利他。基于同情原则的道德判断，与相互牺牲无关，而是关注对他人动机的理解。因此，行为的效用成为“公正的旁观者”批准行为的主要原因之一（斯密 1759年，第179-180页）。与休谟相区分，斯密强调的不是对追求目标的效用的认可，而更多是对在此过程中所运用的力量和手段的发展的认可。因为通常所得到的便利不足以弥补所需的努力，这种情况通常不被人认识到或认识得太晚。但这种“自然的欺骗”却被证明是极为有利的，因为它促进了人类经济潜力的发展。最终，是我们行为的非预期后果，为斯密构成了普遍福祉的基础： “富人...相比于穷人消耗的并不多，尽管他们天生自私且贪婪，尽管他们所采取的所有成千上万人的劳动的唯一目的，是满足他们自己虚荣且无法满足的欲望，他们仍与穷人分享了所有改进的产出。”（斯密 1759年，第184-185页）"},{"instruction":"请将“Diese nicht-intendierten Handlungsfolgen befördern aber nicht nur die allgemeine Wohlfahrt. Die „Reichen\\" werden von einer „invisible hand\\" (von ihr ist hier erstmals die Rede) sogar zu einer annähernd gerechten Verteilung veranlaßt. Smith fahrt an der angegebenen Stelle fort: „They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the mulitiplication of the species. When Providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition. These last too enjoy their share of all that it produces.\\" (ebd.) Bereits in der Moraltheorie ist es die Teleologie der bürgerlichen Produktion (metaphorisch als „unsichtbare Hand\\" bezeichnet), die die am Eigennutz ori- entierten Interessen der atomisierten Produzenten mit dem allgemeinen Interesse der Gesellschaft vermittelt. Während Smith dieses Ergebnis hier nur konstatiert, ist der Mechanismus dieser Vermittlung der Gegenstand seines ökonomischen Werkes. In der 1776 erschienenen Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations unternimmt Smith nicht nur die im Titel angekündigte Untersuchung des „Reichtums\\", sondern auch der Staatsfinanzen, der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung Europas seit der Römerzeit, er liefert eine Kritik verschiedener wirtschaftspolitischer Konzeptionen und vieles andere, das man nicht unbedingt in einer ökonomischen Untersuchung erwartet (wie etwa die Darstellung der Modalitäten der Bischofswahl in der älteren Kirche). Unter Reichtum versteht Smith die Menge der zur Verfugung stehenden Gebrauchs* und Luxusgüter. Er hängt von der Anzahl der Personen, die zu seiner Produktion beitragen, vor allem aber von der Produktivkraft der Arbeit ab. Der Gegenstand seiner Untersuchung (im ersten Buch, das den theoretischen Kern seines Werkes enthält) sind die „causes of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour, and the order, according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the different ranks and conditions of men in the society\\" (Smith 1776, S.10f). Bereits die Fragestellung von Smith, die in der Produktion nicht soziale Beziehungen, sondern nur Produktivkräfte sieht und in der Distribution eine „natürliche Ordnung\\" sucht, reflektiert eine naturhafte Auffassung von Ökonomie. Daß Arbeit überhaupt und nicht nur eine besondere Art von Arbeit die Quelle allen Reichtums sei, machte Smith zum bewußten Ausgangspunkt seiner Untersuchung des Gesamtsystems der bürgerlichen Ökonomie. Die frühen Arbeitswertlehrer trennten noch nicht strikt zwischen Gebrauchswert und Tausch-wert der Waren. So findet sich zwar bei Petty bereits Arbeit als Wertmaß , doch zugleich äußert er „that Labour is the Father and active principle of Wealth, as Lands are the Mother\\" (Petty 1662, S.68). Smith unterscheidet da- gegen klar zwischen Gebrauchswert („value in use\\") und Tauschwert („value in exchange\\") der Waren und erklärt: „The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.\\" (Smith 1776, S.44) Indem Smith jede Werttheorie, die auf „Nutzen\\" beruht, von vornherein ausschließt, bricht er mit einer von Pufendorf bis zu seinem Lehrer Hutcheson reichenden werttheoretischen Tradition. Damit hat Smith, von einem neoklassischen Standpunkt aus gesehen, die politische Ökonomie in England auf einen bedauerlichen Irrweg gefuhrt (vergl. z.B. Douglas 1928, Robertson und Taylor 1957). Umgekehrt sieht Marx in Smith (und Ricardo) gerade wegen ihrer arbeitswerttheoretischen Ansätze die besten Köpfe der bürgerlichen Ökonomie. Es wird nun zu untersuchen sein, in welchem Sinne von einer Arbeitswerttheorie bei Smith und Ricardo gesprochen werden kann und ob ihr die Marxsche Interpretation gerecht wird. Die „principles which regulate the exchangeable value of commodities\\" will Smith in drei Schritten untersuchen: zunächst soll das „wirkliche Maß\\" des Werts oder der „wirkliche Preis\\" der Waren dargestellt werden, dann die verschiedenen Bestandteile dieses Preises und schließlich die Umstände, die bedingen, daß diese Preisbestandteile manchmal über oder unter ihren „natürlichen Sätzen\\" stehen (Smith 1776, S.46). Als Maß des Tauschwerts einer Ware bestimmt Smith Arbeit. Allerdings nicht die Arbeitsmenge, die in der Produktion dieser Ware verausgabt wurde, sondern diejenige Menge fremder Arbeit, die man im Tausch erhält. Zur Begründung dieses Maßes fuhrt Smith an, daß sich ein Mensch nach Einführung der Arbeitsteilung nur einen kleinen Teil dessen, was er zum Leben benötigt, durch eigene Arbeit verschaffen kann und er deshalb auf die Arbeit anderer angewiesen ist. Damit hat Smith ausgesprochen, daß Reichtum nur insoweit von eigener Arbeit abhängig ist, als diese fremder Arbeit gleichgesetzt werden kann, also insoweit die eigene Arbeit als gesellschaftliche Arbeit gilt. Diese spezifische Gesellschaftlichkeit der Waren produzierenden Arbeit wird von Smith aber nicht weiter untersucht. Smith faßt den Tausch nicht als die den gesamtgesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang konstituierende Form der Vermittlung auf, sondern lediglich als einen isolierten Akt zwischen zwei vereinzelten Warenproduzenten. Insofern ist es nur konsequent, wenn er zur weiteren Begründung seines Maßes auf das individuelle Kalkül der Warenbesitzer rekurriert. „The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.(...) What is bought with money or with goods is purchased by labour, as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money or those goods indeed save us this toil.\\" (Smith 1776, S.47) Smith faßt Arbeit hier ganz ungesellschaftlich als Beziehung zwischen einem isolierten Produzenten und der Natur auf. Diese Auseinandersetzung mit der Natur bedeutet fur den Menschen in erster Linie Mühe und Anstrengung. Der Tausch erspart die Anstrengung ein Ding durch eigene Arbeit zu erwerben. Indem die ersparte Arbeit zum Maß des Tauschwerts gemacht wird, fundiert Smith dieses Maß in dem am eigenen Nutzen orientierten, rationalen Verhalten der einzelnen, gleichberechtigten Warenbesitzer. In Zur Kritik der politischen Ökonomie charakterisiert Marx genau dieses Vorgehen, wenn er schreibt, Smith „versieht die objektive Gleichung, die der Gesellschaftsproceß gewaltsam zwischen den ungleichen Arbeiten vollzieht, für die subjektive Gleichberechtigung der individuellen Arbeiten.\\" (II.2/136f; 13/45) Im Rahmen dieser ungesellschaftlichen Auffassung vom Austausch ist auch kein richtiger Platz fur das Geld. Smith betrachtet es lediglich als eine den Austausch erleichternde Einrichtung (Smith 1776, S.37ff). Von Arbeit als dem „wirklichen\\" Maß des Wertes oder dem „wirklichen Preis\\" unterscheidet er den in Geld ausgedrückten Preis als bloßen „Nominalpreis\\" (ebd. S.51). Ein immanenter Zusammenhang von Ware und Geld existiert für ihn nicht. Die Geldsphäre erscheint als bloßer Schleier vor der Realsphäre, ein Schleier, der zumindest in der Theorie jederzeit entfernt werden kann. Insofern wird bei Smith nicht eigentlich der Warentausch, sondern lediglich der Barter, der Produktentausch thematisiert. Für Smith liegt die spezifische Gesellschaftlichkeit, die die Warenbesitzer im Austausch herstellen, letztlich in ihrem individuell mühevollen Verhältnis zur Natur begründet. Damit faßt Smith den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang als unmittelbar konstituiert vom ungesellschaftlichen Verhalten der isolierten Individuen auf Die Phänomene der politischen Ökonomie gründen dann in der empirisch konstatierbaren Anthropologie des zu „dem\\" Menschen hyposta- sierten Warenbesitzers. Diese Anthropologie wird von Smith auch explizit reflektiert. So heißt es über den Ursprung der Arbeitsteilung: „It is the necessary, though very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature... the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another... It is common to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals\\" (Smith 1776, S.25).”翻译为中文","output":"这些非意图的行动后果不仅促进了普遍的福利。甚至“富人”也被一只“看不见的手”引导，使生活必需品的分配几乎与地球被平均分配给所有居民时的情形一样，从而在他们不知不觉中，无意中推进了社会的利益，并为物种的繁衍提供了手段。当普罗维登斯将地球分配给少数主人时，它既没有忘记也没有抛弃那些在分配中似乎被遗漏的人。这些人也享受着它生产的一切。（同上） 早在道德理论中，就是资产阶级生产的目的论（隐喻地称为“看不见的手”），将以自利为导向的分散生产者的利益与社会的总体利益调解起来。尽管史密斯在这里只是提出这个结果，这种调解的机制是他经济作品的主题。 在1776年出版的《国富论》中，史密斯不仅进行了标题中宣布的对“财富”的研究，还研究了国家财政、自罗马时代以来欧洲的经济发展，提供了对不同经济政策概念的批评等，这些都是人们在经济研究中不一定期待的内容（例如对早期教会主教选举方式的描述）。 对于史密斯来说，财富是指可供使用的消费品和奢侈品的数量。它取决于参与生产的人数，尤其是劳动的生产力。他研究的对象（在包含他作品理论核心的第一册中）是： “这些提升劳动生产力的原因，以及其产出自然地在社会中不同等级和条件的人之间分配的顺序”（史密斯1776年，第10-11页）。 史密斯的问题提法，将生产中的社会关系视为生产力，而在分配中寻找“自然秩序”，反映了一种将经济视为自然现象的观点。史密斯明确将劳动本身，而不仅是一种特殊类型的劳动，作为所有财富的源泉，是他对整个资产阶级经济体系进行研究的出发点。早期劳动价值理论家还没有严格区分商品的使用价值和交换价值。比如在佩蒂（Petty）那里，虽然已经有劳动作为价值度量，但他同时也说“劳动是财富的父亲和积极原理，正如土地是母亲”（佩蒂 1662年，第68页）。史密斯则明确区分商品的使用价值（“value in use”）和交换价值（“value in exchange”），并说明： “在使用上有最大价值的东西，在交换中往往几乎没有或根本没有价值；反之，那些在交换中有最大价值的东西，在使用上往往几乎没有或根本没有价值。”（史密斯 1776年，第44页） 通过一开始就排除基于“效用”的任何价值理论，史密斯打破了从普芬多夫到他的老师赫奇森一直持续的价值理论传统。因此，从新古典主义的角度看，史密斯被认为使英格兰的政治经济学误入了令人遗憾的歧途（比如，参见道格拉斯 1928年，罗伯逊和泰勒 1957年）。相反，马克思认为由于史密斯（和李嘉图）劳动价值理论的方法，他们是资产阶级经济学中最杰出的思想家。现在我们将研究史密斯和李嘉图的劳动价值论是以什么意义存在的，以及马克思的解释是否公正。 史密斯想要通过三个步骤研究“调节商品可交换价值的原则”：首先要展示商品价值或“真实价格”的“真正度量”，然后是这个价格的不同组成部分，最后是导致这些价格成分有时高于或低于它们“自然率”的情况（史密斯 1776年，第46页）。 史密斯将商品交换价值的度量确定为劳动。但不是生产这种商品所花费的劳动量，而是通过交换获得的他人劳动的数量。为这个度量辩护时，史密斯指出，一个人在引入分工后，只能通过自己的劳动获取他生活所需的一小部分，因此他依赖于他人的劳动。这样，史密斯就表示，财富仅在自己的劳动可以等同于他人劳动的程度上依赖于自己的劳动，即在自己的劳动被视为社会劳动的程度上。但史密斯并未进一步研究商品生产劳动的这种特定社会性。他没有把交换视为构成整个社会联系的媒介形式，而只是将其视为两个孤立的商品生产者之间的一个孤立行为。因此，当他进一步解释他的度量时转而依赖商品所有者的个人计算是符合逻辑的。 “每件东西的真实价格，即一个想要获得它的人所真正支付的代价，是获取它的劳苦和麻烦。（...）用金钱或商品购买的东西，就像我们通过自己身体的劳苦获得的东西一样，都是用劳动购买的。那些金钱或商品确实为我们省去了这些劳苦。”（史密斯 1776年，第47页） 这里史密斯将劳动完全非社会化地理解为一个孤立的生产者与自然之间的关系。这种与自然的对抗对人类来说首先意味着努力和辛苦。 交换省去了通过自己的劳动获取一件东西的努力。通过将节省下来的劳动作为交换价值的度量，史密斯将这个度量基于个人利益驱动的、理性的、平等的商品所有者的行为。在《政治经济学批判》中，马克思正是描述了史密斯的这种做法，他写道，史密斯 “给社会过程对不等劳动进行强制平等化的客观等式，装上了个体劳动主观上的平等权。”（II.2/136-137; 13/45） 在这种非社会化的交换观念框架下，也为金钱找不到适当的位置。史密斯只是将其视为一种便利交换的设施（史密斯 1776年，第37页及以后）。他将以劳动为“真实”价值度量或“真实”价格与以金钱表示的价格区分为仅仅是“名义价格”（同上，第51页）。对他来说，商品与金钱之间不存在内在联系。金钱领域看起来只是现实领域前的一层面纱，至少在理论上可以随时被揭开。因此，史密斯实际上并未讨论商品交换，而仅讨论了物物交换（Barter）。 对于史密斯来说，商品所有者在交换中建立的特定社会性，最终基于他们与自然之间个体努力的关系。这样，史密斯将社会联系理解为由孤立个体的非社会行为直接构成。政治经济学的现象，因此建立在将商品所有者抽象为“人”的经验证明的人类学上。史密斯也明确地反思了这种人类学。关于分工的起源，他这样写： “这是人类本性中的某种必然倾向的非常缓慢和逐步的结果...... 用一件东西换取另一件东西的倾向...... 它是所有人类共有的，而在其他任何动物种族中都找不到”（史密斯 1776年，第25页）。"},{"instruction":"The order in which you add vectors does not matter.

Notice how \`row_counter\` acts as a global variable that controls the flow of data through your generator for both training and validation. The problem is, after the first epoch, your \`row_counter\` has exceeded the \`train_rows\` limit, and without any mechanism to reset it, your training cannot proceed because the generator function skips data loading and effectively yields no more data. Here's a refined approach to address this issue: 1. **Reset \`row_counter\` at Every Epoch Start**: You can reset \`row_counter\` for each epoch by incorporating it into your \`data_generator\` function more directly or by using another mechanism to reset the \`row_counter\` at the start of each new epoch. 2. **Handle Train/Validation Split More Efficiently**: Instead of using a \`row_counter\` to switch between training and validation data, consider splitting your file or data beforehand, or devising a more robust mechanism within your generator to handle the separation. **Let's first fix the \`data_generator\` function by resetting \`row_counter\` appropriately:** To reset the \`row_counter\` efficiently, you could use a callback in Keras that resets the counter at the start of each epoch. Define a \`ResetRowCounterCallback\`: \`\`\`python class ResetRowCounterCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback): def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None): global row_counter row_counter = 0 \`\`\` This callback will ensure that the \`row_counter\` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each epoch, ensuring that the generator begins yielding data from the start of your dataset each time. **How to Use the Callback:** Instantiate the callback and pass it to your model's \`fit\` method: \`\`\`python reset_row_counter_callback = ResetRowCounterCallback() model.fit( train_generator, steps_per_epoch=steps_per_epoch, epochs=75, validation_data=val_generator, validation_steps=validation_steps, callbacks=[reset_row_counter_callback] # Add the callback ) \`\`\` **General Suggestions:** - **Refine Data Handling**: Consider how your \`data_generator\` handles the end of the dataset and transitions between training and validation data. Ideally, separate strategies should be employed to manage the transition, possibly by maintaining separate generators for training and validation with distinct control mechanisms, rather than relying on a single \`row_counter\`. - **Chunksize vs. Batch Size**: Ensure your generator logic properly handles the case where the end of your dataset might not perfectly divide by the batch size, as this can lead to incomplete batches or missing data in the last step of an epoch. - **Debugging Generators**: Debugging data generators can be challenging. Consider printing/log statements within your generator to ensure it behaves as expected, especially at the boundaries between epochs and when transitioning between training and validation phases. By adopting this callback approach, you ensure your training and validation proceed as expected without the stall you're experiencing."},{"instruction":"update my code and implement General Suggestions that you mentioned","output":"To implement the suggested improvements and ensure your training proceeds correctly through epochs without stalling, let's update your code while addressing the points mentioned: 1. **ResetRowCounterCallback**: This callback will reset the \`row_counter\` at the start of each epoch. 2. **Separate Data Generators for Training and Validation**: Instead of using a single generator with a global \`row_counter\`, use two distinct generators for training and validation data. This approach simplifies data handling and avoids potential issues with the counter. 3. **Debugging Statements**: Adding some logging to understand the flow better.

You must adjust the logic inside \`data_generator\` to distinguish between training and validation data properly. Splitting data beforehand and having two separate files or dataframes—one for training and another for validation—might simplify this. - **Monitoring and Debugging**: Consider adding print statements or logging within your \`data_generator\` to ensure it cycles through data as expected during both training and validation phases.

The Festering Altar of Dawnridge Dawnridge, a village cradled by whispering pines and the tranquil embrace of Lake Aethel, held Father Francis close. His weathered brick church, a testament to bygone faith, pulsed with the lifeblood of the community. With a voice like wind chimes and eyes the color of storm clouds, Father Francis embodied serenity. He was the balm to every wound, the arbiter of peace, a man whose gentle hands dispensed charity with the same ease he offered blessings. Yet, a shadow clung to Dawnridge – a legend etched in whispers, passed down through generations, of an ancient horror festering beneath the town. This slumbering evil, so the tales went, could unravel the very fabric of reality with its awakening. An act of ultimate betrayal, so the stories claimed, was the only key to unlock this slumbering nightmare. Father Francis, a bastion of reason, dismissed these murmurings as mere campfire fables. The serenity of Dawnridge shattered on the cusp of its bicentennial celebration. Five pillars of the community, those who shared Francis's closest confidences, vanished into thin air. Panic gnawed at the heart of the village as searches yielded nothing but gnawing silence. Father Francis emerged as the shepherd in this storm, leading fervent prayers and offering fragile solace to the bereaved families. The calm shattered under the pale gaze of an autumn moon. A macabre tableau unfolded in the hushed embrace of the surrounding woods. The missing lay lifeless, arranged in a grotesque, ritualistic pattern that sent shivers down the spines of even the most jaded investigators. In the heart of this chilling display, cloaked in a shroud of despair, knelt Father Francis. The subsequent confrontation was a tempest unlike any Dawnridge had ever witnessed. Father Francis, the very embodiment of piety, confessed to a sin so heinous it defied comprehension. He spoke of a fevered vision, a divine mandate to orchestrate this macabre ballet. He claimed to have offered the lives of his friends as a sacrifice, a bulwark against a greater apocalypse. This unspeakable act, he rasped, had resealed the ancient horror for another century, buying humanity a fragile peace at the cost of five souls and his own sanity. The resolution, swift and merciless, mirrored the horror of the revelation. Father Francis was swept away, leaving behind a community teetering on the precipice of collapse. Disbelief battled with a cold, creeping dread in the hearts of Dawnridge's citizens. Could their revered priest, the very embodiment of goodness, be capable of such atrocities? Or had he, in his warped sense of duty, truly saved them from an unimaginable fate? The final horror arrived in the form of a crumbling tome unearthed from Father Francis's sanctum. Its brittle pages detailed an ancient rite – a pact for immortality, fueled by the sacrifice of five souls under the crimson gaze of a blood moon. The truth slammed into Dawnridge with the force of a collapsing star. Father Francis hadn't been a savior; he had been a pawn in a twisted game for eternal life. As Father Francis was led away, a specter of a different kind settled upon Dawnridge. The true horror hadn't been an ancient evil slumbering beneath the earth, but a man of faith, corrupted by a hunger for life eternal. The legend of the festering horror remained a whispered tale, but the betrayal that had unfolded in its name would forever scar Dawnridge, a chilling reminder that the most monstrous shadows can lurk in the most pious hearts.","output":"In the cradle of Dawnridge, where whispering pines and the serene embrace of Lake Aethel gather, lived Father Francis, a beacon amidst the weathered stones of his church. His was a voice of wind chimes, eyes mirroring storm-filled skies, a tranquil presence in a world of tumult. Like a healer of old, his hands were vessels of compassion, dispensing alms and blessings with a grace that was almost celestial. Yet, beneath this idyllic veneer, a dark tale thrived, a legend whispered with reverence, of an ancient malevolence festering beneath the earth. This dormant beast, so the folklore spoke, held the power to tear asunder the fabric of reality. An act of unimaginable betrayal, the legend claimed, would awaken this spectral horror. Father Francis, a sentinel of logic amidst superstition, cast these tales aside as the fantasies of fireside ghost stories. But as Dawnridge teetered on the brink of its bicentennial jubilee, a disquiet took root. Five pillars of the community, confidants of Father Francis, evaporated into the ether. A pall of panic and despair enveloped the village, as the land yielded no whispers of the vanished. In this maelstrom of fear, Father Francis stood a lighthouse, channeling fervent prayers and offering solace to the heartbroken. Yet, under a moon bleached by autumn's chill, a sinister tableau shattered the silence—a macabre rite laid bare in the solemn woods. The lost were found, life extinguished, arranged in a ritualistic mosaic that chilled the soul. At its heart, cloaked in despair, knelt Father Francis. What followed was a storm of confession and horror. Father Francis, once a paragon of faith, unveiled a sin of such darkness it seemed to swallow light. He spoke of visions, a divine edict to perform this ghastly rite. His words painted a picture of sacrifice, a desperate ploy to thwart an apocalypse by offering his closest as a shield. This heinous deed, he whispered, was the lock on a door holding back calamity, a peace bought with five lives and his sanity. The denouement was swift, a reflection of the horror revealed. Father Francis was taken, leaving Dawnridge perched on the edge of despair. Doubt wrestled with fear in the villagers' hearts. Could their shepherd, epitome of virtue, have fallen so far? Or in his twisted duty, had he spared them an unfathomable doom? The final revelation was a tome, crumbling and ancient, uncovered within Father Francis's private sanctum. Its pages, brittle with age, recounted an ancient pact, a cry for immortality sealed with the sacrifice of five under a blood moon's watch. The realization crashed upon Dawnridge, a revelation of betrayal. As Father Francis was escorted away, a different specter loomed over Dawnridge. The ancient evil, a mere whisper now, was overshadowed by a new horror: a man of cloth, corrupted by a thirst for endless days. The true horror of Dawnridge wasn't the fabled beast beneath, but a betrayal by one of their own, etching a scar upon the heart of the village—a testament that the darkest shadows often dwell within the souls deemed the most holy."},{"instruction":"make a story about a guy who is clumsy","output":"In the picturesque town of Eldridge, tucked away under the shade of ancient oaks and beside the gently babbling Brooke River, lived a man by the name of Ethan Alder. Ethan, with his mop of unruly hair that never lay flat and glasses perpetually askew, was known by one and all for his extraordinary clumsiness. It was said that if there was a puddle to step in, a rake to step on, or a banana peel to slip on, Ethan would find it, as though drawn by some inexplicable force of nature. Despite his propensity for mishaps, Ethan was a beloved figure in Eldridge, his good-natured laugh and readiness to poke fun at his own expense endearing him to most. He worked at the local bookstore, a cozy haven of literature where the town’s residents whiled away many a lazy afternoon. The bookstore, much like Ethan, had its quirks, with shelves that leaned slightly to the left and a bell above the door that chimed off-key. Ethan’s adventures, or rather misadventures, were legendary. There was the episode of the Valentine’s Day poetry reading, where, in an attempt to impress Sarah Jennings, the town's librarian and subject of Ethan's long-standing affections, he managed to topple a display of classic love stories. The books cascaded like a literary waterfall, sweeping Ethan’s feet from under him and sending him crashing into the podium with a loud, resounding thump. The incident might have ended in disaster, were it not for Sarah’s laughter, musical and light, which filled the room and turned the blunder into a moment of shared amusement. Then there was the time Ethan volunteered to help decorate the town hall for the annual Eldridge Fall Festival. Tasked with hanging lanterns, Ethan somehow managed to entangle himself in a series of strings and lights, transforming himself into a human chandelier. It took the combined efforts of the Mayor and the fire department to extricate him, much to the mirth of onlookers. But it was during the Great Pie Contest at the Eldridge Summer Fair that Ethan truly outdid himself. Determined to contribute, Ethan decided to bake his grandmother’s famous cherry pie. All was going well until the moment of truth arrived, and Ethan, flustered by the attention of the gathered crowd, managed to trip over his own feet, launching the pie skyward. The pie performed a graceful arc before descending squarely on the head of the contest judge, Mr. Harold Finch. Far from being outraged, the crowd erupted into gales of laughter, and even Mr. Finch couldn’t help but crack a smile, cherry pie dripping down his face. It was incidents like these that wove Ethan more tightly into the fabric of Eldridge, his mishaps becoming as much a part of the town folklore as the tales of founding pioneers. But perhaps the most compelling chapter in Ethan’s story came unexpectedly one stormy night. The river, swollen with rain, threatened to flood the Joyce family's farm. Ethan, hearing of their plight, rushed to help, enlisting others along the way. In the daunting night, amidst the howling wind and lashing rain, Ethan’s clumsiness vanished. Guiding the effort with surprising sureness, he coordinated sandbagging and ensured the Joyce family was safely evacuated. The farm was saved, and Ethan emerged a hero, his efforts heralding a newfound respect among the townsfolk. Ethan’s tale is one of heart and determination, a testament to the spirit of a man who, despite his seemingly perpetual battle with gravity, showed that true grace comes not from the absence of faults but in the courage to rise each time we fall. In the heart of Eldridge, among the pages of its history, Ethan Alder, the town's beloved klutz, found his place, proving that sometimes it's our quirks that make us most endearing."},{"instruction":"88А.

基本步骤 1. **安装Grafana**：你可以从Grafana的官网下载适用于你操作系统的版本。Grafana可以运行在Linux、Windows和MacOS上。 2. **启动和配置**：安装完成后，你需要启动Grafana并通过其Web界面进行配置。默认情况下，你可以通过浏览器访问\`http://localhost:3000\`来进入Grafana的UI界面。 3. **配置数据源**：登录后，首先要做的是配置数据源。在**Configuration**（配置）> **Data Sources**（数据源）里添加你的数据源，如Elasticsearch、Prometheus等。 4. **创建仪表板和面板**：数据源配置完成后，你可以开始创建仪表板和面板来可视化数据。仪表板提供了数据的实时视图，面板则是仪表板内用于展示特定数据可视化的单个组件。 5. **查询和可视化数据**：在面板内，你可以构建查询来从所选的数据源提取数据。Grafana提供了多种图表类型，包括时序图、柱状图、热图等，以及更高级的Gauge（仪表盘）、Bar Gauge（条形仪表盘）等。 6. **告警配置**：Grafana还允许你为数据设置告警规则。当数据达到特定阈值时，Grafana可以通过Email、Slack等通道发送通知。 # 高级特性 - **变量（Variables）**：Grafana允许定义变量，使得仪表板更加动态和交互式。用户可以通过下拉菜单选择不同的变量值来改变查询和图表。 - **注释（Annotations）**：你可以在图表上添加注释来标记重要的事件，如系统升级、故障等。 - **插件**：Grafana有一个庞大的社区，支持许多第三方插件，包括数据源、面板可视化类型、应用等，可以扩展Grafana的功能。 - **API**：Grafana提供了强大的HTTP API来管理资源（如仪表板、数据源）、设置权限和执行其他自动化任务。 # 使用案例 Grafana在许多场景中都非常有用： - **监控云基础设施**：监控服务器、容器、应用程序的实时性能。 - **应用性能监控（APM）**：分析和监控应用程序的响应时间、请求率、错误率等。 - **网络监控**：跟踪网络流量、带宽使用、网络延迟等。 - **物联网（IoT）数据分析**：监控和分析从各种物联网设备收集的数据。 通过高效地分析和可视化数据，Grafana有助于团队快速诊断问题、做出决策并理解其系统和应用程序的行为。"},{"instruction":"grafana 对接数据源成功，查询sum 有显示index中的字段， query inspect response 200， 但是数据均为null 为什么","output":"当你在Grafana里配置了数据源，如Elasticsearch，并且查询返回了响应码200，但是数据却为null，这可能是由于以下几个原因导致的： 1. **查询语句不匹配**：确保你的查询语句确实能够匹配到你想要的数据。如果你使用的\`sum\`聚合函数，确认字段确实存在正确的数值。如果是文本字段，\`sum\`可能无法返回期望的结果。 2. **时间范围问题**：检查你的查询所设置的时间范围是否包含有数据的时间段。Grafana的时间范围是查询的关键部分，如果设置不正确，你可能会错过数据。 3. **字段类型不支持**：如果你尝试对非数值字段执行\`sum\`等数学聚合操作，可能会得到空结果。确认你聚合的字段类型是数值型的。 4. **权限问题**：确保你的Grafana实例具有足够的权限从数据源查询数据，特别是在云服务中运行的时候。权限不足也可能导致数据返回为空。 5. **索引模式不匹配**：如果你使用的是Elasticsearch，请确认你在Grafana数据源配置中指定的索引模式确实包含了期望的数据。例如，如果你的数据存储在特定的索引模式下，但是在Grafana中配置的模式不匹配，就可能导致查询不到数据。 6. **数据源配置错误**：重新检查你的数据源配置，确认所有的设置都是正确的，比如索引名称、时间字段和数据源的URL等。 7. **缓存问题**：尝试清除Grafana的缓存或临时文件，然后再次执行查询。有时候缓存可能导致展示的数据不是最新的。 为了解决这个问题，你可尝试： - 检查Grafana查询的**Query Inspector**或Elasticsearch的**Kibana Dev Tools**里相同查询的原始输出，看是否真的有数据返回。 - 在Elasticsearch中直接运行相同的查询，并观察是否有数据返回，这可以帮助确定问题是否出在Grafana。 - 确认Grafana所用的时间格式和Elasticsearch中的时间字段格式是否一致。 如果上述步骤都无法解决问题，可能需要深入分析Elasticsearch的索引设置、Grafana的日志或查询的具体细节来找到根本原因。"},{"instruction":"上述问题如何确定 grafana 查询的语句，或者将grafana的查询条件转换为elasticsearch的查询语句呢","output":"在Grafana中执行查询时，如果希望看到实际发送给数据源（如Elasticsearch）的查询语句，或者想将Grafana的查询条件转换为Elasticsearch的查询语句，可以按照以下步骤操作： # 如何查看Grafana发送给Elasticsearch的查询语句 1. **在Grafana面板中设置查询**：首先，在Grafana面板中创建或编辑一个查询。 2. **打开查询检查器**：在面板编辑界面的右上角，有一个名为\\"Query Inspector\\"（查询检查器）或者\\"Inspect\\"（检查）的按钮。点击它。 3. **查看查询详情**：在打开的检查器窗口中，找到**Query**选项卡，你应该可以看到发送到数据源的实际查询。对于Elasticsearch数据源，这里会显示实际的RESTful API请求体。 这个查询详情会根据你在Grafana中设置的查询参数动态生成，包括所选择的时间范围、查询条件、聚合函数等。 # 如何将Grafana的查询条件转换为Elasticsearch的查询语句 一旦你在查询检查器中找到了由Grafana生成的Elasticsearch查询语句，你就可以直接将其复制出来使用。这个查询语句本质上是一个JSON对象，可以直接作为Elasticsearch RESTful API调用的请求体。 例如，如果Grafana生成了下面的查询语句： \`\`\`json { \\"query\\": { \\"bool\\": { \\"filter\\": [ { \\"range\\": { \\"@timestamp\\": { \\"gte\\": \\"now-1h\\", \\"lte\\": \\"now\\" } } } ] } } } \`\`\` 你可以直接将这段JSON代码用在Elasticsearch的查询接口中，比如使用\`curl\`命令，或者在Kibana的Dev Tools中测试。 在Kibana的Dev Tools中，这可能看起来像是： \`\`\`sh GET /your-index-name/_search { \\"query\\": { \\"bool\\": { \\"filter\\": [ { \\"range\\": { \\"@timestamp\\": { \\"gte\\": \\"now-1h\\", \\"lte\\": \\"now\\" } } } ] } } } \`\`\` 在这里，\`your-index-name\`是你希望查询的Elasticsearch索引名。 这种将Grafana查询条件转换为Elasticsearch查询语句的方式，不仅能帮助你在Elasticsearch或Kibana中复现和测试Grafana的查询，还可以方便地在Grafana以外的环境中利用这些查询，进一步探索和分析你的数据。"},{"instruction":"make a story about a guy who is clumsy (in narrative and pretty casual language)","output":"Once upon a time, in a not-so-far-away town, lived a guy named Jake. Jake was the epitome of a walking disaster. If there was a banana peel within a ten-mile radius, you could bet Jake would find it, slip, and land on his behind. And that was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to his clumsiness. Now, don't get me wrong. Jake was a great guy. He had a heart of gold, was always ready to help out a friend, and could make anyone laugh. But put a simple task in front of him, like carrying a glass of water from the kitchen to the living room, and it was as if he'd been asked to solve quantum physics while balancing on a unicycle. One sunny morning, Jake decided he wanted to make breakfast. A simple task for many, but for Jake, it was as if he were preparing to run a marathon. He started with pancakes. Flour ended up everywhere but the mixing bowl. Eggs slipped out of his hands like they had a vendetta against him, painting the kitchen floor in a shade of eggshell disaster. After the great pancake debacle, Jake figured maybe something easier would do the trick. Toast. What could possibly go wrong with toast? Famous last words. Jake managed to jam the bread so effectively into the toaster that it looked like it might require an exorcism to get it out again. Just as he was about to give up on his culinary adventure and call for pizza, his neighbor, Sam, popped by. Sam was the complete opposite of Jake – graceful, poised, and could probably carry a tray of glasses through a hurricane without losing a drop. Seeing the chaos, Sam couldn't help but chuckle. Rather than leaving Jake to wallow in his mess, Sam decided to give him a hand. Together, they managed to salvage what was left of breakfast, and Jake learned a thing or two about how not to wear his food. It turns out, making breakfast was a lot more fun with company, especially company that didn't look like they'd just walked through a food fight. Jake realized that perhaps his clumsiness wasn't such a curse. It brought laughter, it brought friends together, and, most importantly, it brought stories that would be told and retold, bringing smiles to people's faces. From that day on, Jake embraced his clumsiness. Yes, he might send a stack of papers flying now and then, or accidentally wear his lunch, but it was all part of who he was. And who he was, was someone everyone loved to be around. Because beyond the spills, trips, and mishaps, Jake had an uncanny ability to bring joy into the lives of those around him. And that, folks, was no clumsy feat."},{"instruction":"make the language a little bit more casual: Dawnridge, a village cradled by whispering pines and the tranquil embrace of Lake Aethel, held Father Francis close. His weathered brick church, a testament to bygone faith, pulsed with the lifeblood of the community. With a voice like wind chimes and eyes the color of storm clouds, Father Francis embodied serenity. He was the balm to every wound, the arbiter of peace, a man whose gentle hands dispensed charity with the same ease he offered blessings. Yet, a shadow clung to Dawnridge – a legend etched in whispers, passed down through generations, of an ancient horror festering beneath the town. This slumbering evil, so the tales went, could unravel the very fabric of reality with its awakening. An act of ultimate betrayal, so the stories claimed, was the only key to unlock this slumbering nightmare. Father Francis, a bastion of reason, dismissed these murmurings as mere campfire fables. The serenity of Dawnridge shattered on the cusp of its bicentennial celebration. Five pillars of the community, those who shared Francis's closest confidences, vanished into thin air. Panic gnawed at the heart of the village as searches yielded nothing but gnawing silence. Father Francis emerged as the shepherd in this storm, leading fervent prayers and offering fragile solace to the bereaved families. The calm shattered under the pale gaze of an autumn moon. A macabre tableau unfolded in the hushed embrace of the surrounding woods. The missing lay lifeless, arranged in a grotesque, ritualistic pattern that sent shivers down the spines of even the most jaded investigators. In the heart of this chilling display, cloaked in a shroud of despair, knelt Father Francis. The subsequent confrontation was a tempest unlike any Dawnridge had ever witnessed. Father Francis, the very embodiment of piety, confessed to a sin so heinous it defied comprehension. He spoke of a fevered vision, a divine mandate to orchestrate this macabre ballet. He claimed to have offered the lives of his friends as a sacrifice, a bulwark against a greater apocalypse. This unspeakable act, he rasped, had resealed the ancient horror for another century, buying humanity a fragile peace at the cost of five souls and his own sanity. The resolution, swift and merciless, mirrored the horror of the revelation. Father Francis was swept away, leaving behind a community teetering on the precipice of collapse. Disbelief battled with a cold, creeping dread in the hearts of Dawnridge's citizens. Could their revered priest, the very embodiment of goodness, be capable of such atrocities? Or had he, in his warped sense of duty, truly saved them from an unimaginable fate? The final horror arrived in the form of a crumbling tome unearthed from Father Francis's sanctum. Its brittle pages detailed an ancient rite – a pact for immortality, fueled by the sacrifice of five souls under the crimson gaze of a blood moon. The truth slammed into Dawnridge with the force of a collapsing star. Father Francis hadn't been a savior; he had been a pawn in a twisted game for eternal life. As Father Francis was led away, a specter of a different kind settled upon Dawnridge. The true horror hadn't been an ancient evil slumbering beneath the earth, but a man of faith, corrupted by a hunger for life eternal. The legend of the festering horror remained a whispered tale, but the betrayal that had unfolded in its name would forever scar Dawnridge, a chilling reminder that the most monstrous shadows can lurk in the most pious hearts.","output":"So there’s this place, Dawnridge, right? It’s this cozy village hugged by pine trees and snuggled up next to Lake Aethel. Father Francis is pretty much the heart of the place. His old brick church is where everyone hangs out, drawing folks like bees to honey. The guy’s got a voice as soothing as music and eyes like a stormy sky – he’s the go-to for fixing problems or calming people down. He’s basically everyone’s favorite human. But here's the thing, Dawnridge has this spooky story everyone whispers about. Legend says there’s this ancient, nasty horror buried under the town, just waiting to mess things up. And get this – betraying someone big-time is supposedly the key to waking it up. Father Francis, though, he thinks it’s all just spooky stories for around the campfire. Cut to Dawnridge getting ready to throw a massive 200th birthday bash for itself. But then, bam! Five of Father Francis’s tightest pals disappear into thin air. The whole village gets freaked out, searching everywhere but finding squat. Father Francis steps up, trying to keep everyone calm, doing his thing with prayers and comfort. Now, get ready for the creepy part. One night, under a spooky autumn moon, they find the missing folks in the woods, laid out like they’re starring in some horror movie. The chill in the air wasn’t just from the night. And who’s right there in the middle of it all? Father Francis. When the dust settled, Father Francis spilled the beans. He said he had this wild dream telling him to do it, to save everyone from some doomsday scenario by getting rid of his friends. He thought he’d kept a bigger bad from waking up, trading their lives and his mind for the world’s safety. The fallout was intense. Father Francis was carted off, leaving Dawnridge hanging by a thread, everyone shocked and whispering. They couldn’t figure it out – was their hero priest actually a monster, or had he somehow saved them from something even worse? But then, they found this ancient book in Father Francis’s stuff, all about living forever by sacrificing people under a blood moon. Boom – the truth hit everyone like a ton of bricks. Father Francis wasn’t a hero; he had fallen for the oldest trick in the book, trying to cheat death. As Father Francis was taken away, it dawned on everyone that the real terror wasn’t some monster under the ground. The scariest thing was seeing someone as good as Father Francis get twisted by the promise of forever. Dawnridge would keep telling the tale of the buried horror, but the true nightmare they lived through – that a man of faith could be so deeply corrupted – would haunt them much longer, a dark stain on the heart of Dawnridge."},{"instruction":"def f(n): k = to_5(n) k == k[::-1] k = int(k, 5) res = abs(k - n) return res print(min(n for n in range(0,5000) if f(n) == 100)) почему мне выдает ошибку","output":"В приведенном вами коде есть несколько проблем, из-за которых он может не работать должным образом: 1.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 6 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that makes it so that every other turn, I regress physically and mentally into a 6-year-old girl, and as such my stats also regress to the stats of a mere beginner. So in the context of the duel, in odd numbered turns I’m 16, and in even numbered turns I’m 6. I’m not self aware of these changes that happen to me every turn. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the casting is still successful but the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for Lily and one for me, and when I regress, my spells turn into baby versions. (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker. Lily’s spells additionally add up points to a meter that when full will allow her to cast an epic spell that’ll permanently regress Sapphire. Add a tracker for the meter as well.","output":"Welcome to the grand arena of magical dueling, where today's match features the reigning champion, Sapphire, against the young prodigy, Lily, in a battle of wits, magic, and glamour.

Ya que 2048 es una potencia de 2 y debido a cómo funcionan las potencias de 2 en la divisibilidad, sabemos que (16384) es divisible exactamente por (2048), pues (16384/2048 = 8). Así, el módulo (el resto de esta división) es (0). **Propiedades usadas:** - Propiedad de potencias de igual base. 3. **Resolución de la segunda operación (Multiplicación de potencias con la misma base negativa):** - La operación es: ((-2)^{15} times (-2)^{13}) - Usamos la propiedad de multiplicación de potencias con la misma base, donde sumamos los exponentes: ((-2)^{15+13} = (-2)^{28}) - Como resultado tenemos una potencia par de un número negativo, la cual es positiva: (2^{28}) **Propiedades usadas:** - Propiedad de potencias de igual base: (a^m times a^n = a^{m+n}) - Regla de los signos para la multiplicación (un número negativo elevado a una potencia par resulta en un número positivo). 4. **Resultado final de la operación:** - Ahora sustituimos los resultados obtenidos en los pasos anteriores: (0 - 2^{28}) - La resta de cualquier número por 0 es el mismo número, entonces el resultado es: (-2^{28}) **Propiedades usadas:** - En este paso, principalmente se hizo uso del concepto básico de que cualquier número menos 0 es el mismo número.

The precise impact on Earth and humanity would depend on several factors, including the size, type, and relative positions of the three stars, as well as their orbits around each other. These factors would influence the gravitational stability of the system, the amount of radiation the planets receive, and the potential habitability of worlds within such a system. # Gravitational Stability Three-star systems can exist in a few configurations, but generally, they tend to follow one of these patterns: 1. **Hierarchical System**: Two stars orbit closely as a binary pair while the third orbits the pair at a much greater distance. This is the most stable configuration for a multi-star system. 2. **Co-orbiting System**: Three stars orbit each other in a more or less equidistant manner, though this configuration is much rarer and less stable than the hierarchical system. In either scenario, the gravitational forces exerted by the stars would make planetary orbits complex. If Earth were in such a system: - **Stable Orbits**: Earth might find a stable orbit around one of the stars, in the habitable zone, but this would require a delicate balance not to be perturbed by the gravitational influence of the other stars. - **Chaotic Orbits**: More likely, Earth's orbit could become chaotic due to the gravitational perturbations from the other stars, potentially leading to extreme climate variations, or even ejection from the system or collision with another body. # Radiation Environment The type and amount of stellar radiation striking Earth would vary based on the configuration of the stars and their types (e.g., red dwarf, yellow dwarf like our Sun, or giant stars). Too much or too little radiation can: - **Affect Habitability**: Change the climate dramatically, potentially rendering the planet uninhabitable by altering its atmosphere or causing extreme temperature variations. - **Impact Health**: Increase rates of mutations, cancer, or other health issues for any form of life that might exist. # Humanity's Response If such a transition to a three-star system were somehow to occur instantaneously or within a human timescale (which, of course, defies our understanding of astrophysics), humanity's ability to respond or adapt would be severely challenged: - **Technological Adaptation**: We would need to develop technologies at an unprecedented rate to mitigate the effects of increased radiation, temperature extremes, and potentially unstable planetary orbits. - **Colonization of Space or Other Bodies**: Seeking new homes on other, more stable planets or moons, if any exist within the system, might become a priority. - **Societal Changes**: The social, economic, and political impacts could be profound, leading to changes in how societies are structured and how resources are allocated. In reality, our understanding of multi-star systems primarily comes from observation of existing systems far from our own. A sudden shift to such a system is beyond the realm of current physical possibility and remains a fascinating scenario for speculative fiction rather than an impending reality."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 6 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that makes it so that every other turn, I regress physically and mentally into a 6-year-old girl, and as such my stats also regress to the stats of a mere beginner. So in the context of the duel, in odd numbered turns I’m 16, and in even numbered turns I’m 6. I’m not self aware of these changes that happen to me every turn. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the casting is still successful but the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for Lily and one for me. (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker. Lily’s spells additionally add up points to a meter that when full will allow her to cast an epic spell that’ll permanently regress Sapphire.

The air thrums with excitement, as the crowd’s murmurs turn into cheers—the anticipated duel between Sapphire, the teen division’s reigning champion, and Lily, the prodigious challenger, is about to begin. This duel is not only a test of power but of artistic mastery and the ability to enchant and captivate. As the duel commences under the starlit sky, Sapphire, with years of discipline, and Lily, with youthful determination, prepare their first spells. Unbeknownst to Sapphire, Lily casts her secret spell, igniting the challenge not just with grandeur but with unforeseen complexity. # Let's Begin: Naturally, only you can decide what spells Sapphire casts each turn. State your chosen spell for each round, and I will adjudicate based on the described mechanics, incorporating the fluctuating stats due to the secret spell's effect.

The crowd is mesmerized by the stunning display of *Eclipse Shatter*, with whispers of awe rippling through the audience as they behold the night sky crack open with celestial beauty. Lily’s *Rainbow Ribbon Twist* brings a whimsical charm to the stage, capturing the hearts of many with its vibrant hues and graceful execution. As the duel progresses, Sapphire feels an unusual shift, not in the surroundings but within, unaware of the impending transformation as the duel moves into the second round."},{"instruction":"Galactic Gates","output":"# Round 2 (Age 6) **Your Choice:** *Galactic Gates* Given Sapphire's stats at age 6 due to the regression spell: - **Spell Power**: 30 (Insufficient for *Galactic Gates*, which requires 100) - **Performance**: 40 Unfortunately, **Galactic Gates** is a high-demand spell, far beyond the capabilities of a 6-year-old Sapphire. **Spell Outcome:** - Sapphire's Spell Power is significantly below half the required stats, resulting in a failed spell. - **Points Deduction**: -20 points. **Points Lost This Round:** - **Sapphire**: -20 points **Lily's Action:** Lily chooses to cast *Shimmering Light Leap*. - **Spell Power**: 60 (Sufficient for *Shimmering Light Leap*, which requires 55) - **Performance**: 70 **Spell Outcome:** - Successfully cast. - Base Points: 65 - Performance Adjustment: 70% of 65 = 45.5 points, rounded to 46 for simplicity. **Points Earned This Round:** - **Lily**: 46 points # Points Tracker After Round 2: - **Sapphire**: 97 points - **Lily**: 85 points # Age & Stats Tracker: - **Sapphire**: Returns to 16 years old next round. - **Lily**: Remains 10 years old.

On the other side, Lily’s *Shimmering Light Leap* fills the arena with delicate beams of light that dance gracefully around her, earning her applause and closing the gap in scores. Sapphire, unaware of the exchange of power and still reeling from the failed attempt, braces for the next spell, hoping to reclaim her former glory as she feels her strength mysteriously returning. The duel is heating up, and the audience is on the edge of their seats, wondering what will come next."},{"instruction":"what's the status of the meter","output":"The concept of Lily’s Epic Spell Meter was introduced to signify when she could cast a potentially game-changing spell that would cement the regression effect on Sapphire. Given the narrative structure, let’s clarify how Lily accumulates points towards this meter and its current status after Round 2. # Lily’s Epic Spell Meter Criteria: - Points are accumulated based on Lily’s performance and any significant missteps or failures from Sapphire that could be leveraged to Lily's advantage. - For simplicity, let’s establish that Lily gains meter points in a manner reflective of her scoring success, as well as benefiting from Sapphire’s failures. # Meter Points Calculation: - **Starting Meter Points**: 0 - **Points Earned per Successful Lily Spell**: Half of the spell's base points before performance adjustment. - **Points Added for Sapphire’s Spell Failures**: 20 points per failure (given Sapphire’s -20 point deduction). # Meter Points After Round 2: Round 1: - Lily’s Spell (*Rainbow Ribbon Twist*): Half of 55 (Base Points) = 27.5, rounded to 28 for simplicity. Round 2: - Lily’s Spell (*Shimmering Light Leap*): Half of 65 (Base Points) = 32.5, rounded to 33 for simplicity. - Sapphire’s Failure with *Galactic Gates*: 20 points. **Total Meter Points Added by End of Round 2:** - Round 1 Contribution: 28 - Round 2 Contribution: 53 (33 from spell + 20 from failure) - **Total Meter Points**: 81 # Current Meter Status: - **Lily’s Epic Spell Meter**: 81 points of 800 required. Given the substantial requirement for triggering the epic spell, the meter is currently at 81 points, demonstrating a significant yet early progression towards its activation. This mechanism emphasizes the dual layer of challenge for Sapphire, not only to dazzle with her spellcasting but also to mitigate any further setbacks that might empower Lily towards landing a potentially irreversible blow in this magically charged duel."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Die „Reichen\\" werden von einer „invisible hand\\" (von ihr ist hier erstmals die Rede) sogar zu einer annähernd gerechten Verteilung veranlaßt. Smith fahrt an der angegebenen Stelle fort: „They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the mulitiplication of the species. When Providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition. These last too enjoy their share of all that it produces.\\" (ebd.) Bereits in der Moraltheorie ist es die Teleologie der bürgerlichen Produktion (metaphorisch als „unsichtbare Hand\\" bezeichnet), die die am Eigennutz ori- entierten Interessen der atomisierten Produzenten mit dem allgemeinen Interesse der Gesellschaft vermittelt. Während Smith dieses Ergebnis hier nur konstatiert, ist der Mechanismus dieser Vermittlung der Gegenstand seines ökonomischen Werkes. In der 1776 erschienenen Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations unternimmt Smith nicht nur die im Titel angekündigte Untersuchung des „Reichtums\\", sondern auch der Staatsfinanzen, der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung Europas seit der Römerzeit, er liefert eine Kritik verschiedener wirtschaftspolitischer Konzeptionen und vieles andere, das man nicht unbedingt in einer ökonomischen Untersuchung erwartet (wie etwa die Darstellung der Modalitäten der Bischofswahl in der älteren Kirche). Unter Reichtum versteht Smith die Menge der zur Verfugung stehenden Gebrauchs* und Luxusgüter. Er hängt von der Anzahl der Personen, die zu seiner Produktion beitragen, vor allem aber von der Produktivkraft der Arbeit ab. Der Gegenstand seiner Untersuchung (im ersten Buch, das den theoretischen Kern seines Werkes enthält) sind die „causes of this improvement, in the productive powers of labour, and the order, according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the different ranks and conditions of men in the society\\" (Smith 1776, S.10f). Bereits die Fragestellung von Smith, die in der Produktion nicht soziale Beziehungen, sondern nur Produktivkräfte sieht und in der Distribution eine „natürliche Ordnung\\" sucht, reflektiert eine naturhafte Auffassung von Ökonomie. Daß Arbeit überhaupt und nicht nur eine besondere Art von Arbeit die Quelle allen Reichtums sei, machte Smith zum bewußten Ausgangspunkt seiner Untersuchung des Gesamtsystems der bürgerlichen Ökonomie. Die frühen Arbeitswertlehrer trennten noch nicht strikt zwischen Gebrauchswert und Tausch-wert der Waren. So findet sich zwar bei Petty bereits Arbeit als Wertmaß , doch zugleich äußert er „that Labour is the Father and active principle of Wealth, as Lands are the Mother\\" (Petty 1662, S.68). Smith unterscheidet da- gegen klar zwischen Gebrauchswert („value in use\\") und Tauschwert („value in exchange\\") der Waren und erklärt: „The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.\\" (Smith 1776, S.44) Indem Smith jede Werttheorie, die auf „Nutzen\\" beruht, von vornherein ausschließt, bricht er mit einer von Pufendorf bis zu seinem Lehrer Hutcheson reichenden werttheoretischen Tradition. Damit hat Smith, von einem neoklassischen Standpunkt aus gesehen, die politische Ökonomie in England auf einen bedauerlichen Irrweg gefuhrt (vergl. z.B. Douglas 1928, Robertson und Taylor 1957). Umgekehrt sieht Marx in Smith (und Ricardo) gerade wegen ihrer arbeitswerttheoretischen Ansätze die besten Köpfe der bürgerlichen Ökonomie. Es wird nun zu untersuchen sein, in welchem Sinne von einer Arbeitswerttheorie bei Smith und Ricardo gesprochen werden kann und ob ihr die Marxsche Interpretation gerecht wird. Die „principles which regulate the exchangeable value of commodities\\" will Smith in drei Schritten untersuchen: zunächst soll das „wirkliche Maß\\" des Werts oder der „wirkliche Preis\\" der Waren dargestellt werden, dann die verschiedenen Bestandteile dieses Preises und schließlich die Umstände, die bedingen, daß diese Preisbestandteile manchmal über oder unter ihren „natürlichen Sätzen\\" stehen (Smith 1776, S.46). Als Maß des Tauschwerts einer Ware bestimmt Smith Arbeit. Allerdings nicht die Arbeitsmenge, die in der Produktion dieser Ware verausgabt wurde, sondern diejenige Menge fremder Arbeit, die man im Tausch erhält. Zur Begründung dieses Maßes fuhrt Smith an, daß sich ein Mensch nach Einführung der Arbeitsteilung nur einen kleinen Teil dessen, was er zum Leben benötigt, durch eigene Arbeit verschaffen kann und er deshalb auf die Arbeit anderer angewiesen ist. Damit hat Smith ausgesprochen, daß Reichtum nur insoweit von eigener Arbeit abhängig ist, als diese fremder Arbeit gleichgesetzt werden kann, also insoweit die eigene Arbeit als gesellschaftliche Arbeit gilt. Diese spezifische Gesellschaftlichkeit der Waren produzierenden Arbeit wird von Smith aber nicht weiter untersucht. Smith faßt den Tausch nicht als die den gesamtgesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang konstituierende Form der Vermittlung auf, sondern lediglich als einen isolierten Akt zwischen zwei vereinzelten Warenproduzenten. Insofern ist es nur konsequent, wenn er zur weiteren Begründung seines Maßes auf das individuelle Kalkül der Warenbesitzer rekurriert. „The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.(...) What is bought with money or with goods is purchased by labour, as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money or those goods indeed save us this toil.\\" (Smith 1776, S.47) Smith faßt Arbeit hier ganz ungesellschaftlich als Beziehung zwischen einem isolierten Produzenten und der Natur auf. Diese Auseinandersetzung mit der Natur bedeutet fur den Menschen in erster Linie Mühe und Anstrengung. Der Tausch erspart die Anstrengung ein Ding durch eigene Arbeit zu erwerben. Indem die ersparte Arbeit zum Maß des Tauschwerts gemacht wird, fundiert Smith dieses Maß in dem am eigenen Nutzen orientierten, rationalen Verhalten der einzelnen, gleichberechtigten Warenbesitzer. In Zur Kritik der politischen Ökonomie charakterisiert Marx genau dieses Vorgehen, wenn er schreibt, Smith „versieht die objektive Gleichung, die der Gesellschaftsproceß gewaltsam zwischen den ungleichen Arbeiten vollzieht, für die subjektive Gleichberechtigung der individuellen Arbeiten.\\" (II.2/136f; 13/45) Im Rahmen dieser ungesellschaftlichen Auffassung vom Austausch ist auch kein richtiger Platz fur das Geld. Smith betrachtet es lediglich als eine den Austausch erleichternde Einrichtung (Smith 1776, S.37ff). Von Arbeit als dem „wirklichen\\" Maß des Wertes oder dem „wirklichen Preis\\" unterscheidet er den in Geld ausgedrückten Preis als bloßen „Nominalpreis\\" (ebd. S.51). Ein immanenter Zusammenhang von Ware und Geld existiert für ihn nicht. Die Geldsphäre erscheint als bloßer Schleier vor der Realsphäre, ein Schleier, der zumindest in der Theorie jederzeit entfernt werden kann. Insofern wird bei Smith nicht eigentlich der Warentausch, sondern lediglich der Barter, der Produktentausch thematisiert. Für Smith liegt die spezifische Gesellschaftlichkeit, die die Warenbesitzer im Austausch herstellen, letztlich in ihrem individuell mühevollen Verhältnis zur Natur begründet. Damit faßt Smith den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang als unmittelbar konstituiert vom ungesellschaftlichen Verhalten der isolierten Individuen auf Die Phänomene der politischen Ökonomie gründen dann in der empirisch konstatierbaren Anthropologie des zu „dem\\" Menschen hyposta- sierten Warenbesitzers. Diese Anthropologie wird von Smith auch explizit reflektiert. So heißt es über den Ursprung der Arbeitsteilung: „It is the necessary, though very slow and gradual, consequence of a certain propensity in human nature... the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another... It is common to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals\\" (Smith 1776, S.25).”翻译为中文","output":"这些非预期的行为后果不仅促进了普遍福祉。“富人”甚至被一只“看不见的手”（这里首次提到它）引导去实现一个近乎公正的分配。在给出的引述中，史密斯继续说： “他们被一只看不见的手引导，使生活必需品的分配几乎和将地球平均分配给所有居民一样，因此他们在不知不觉中，无意中推进了社会的利益，并为物种的繁殖提供了手段。当上帝将地球分配给少数高贵的主人时，它既没有忘记也没有遗弃那些在分配中似乎被忽略的人。这些人同样享受着它所产出的一切。”（同上） 在道德理论中，所谓的资产阶级生产的目的论（以“看不见的手”为隐喻）将以自利为导向的原子化生产者的利益与社会的整体利益联系起来。尽管史密斯在这里仅仅是陈述这一结果，这种调解的机制则是他的经济作品的研究对象。 在1776年发表的《国富论》中，史密斯不仅进行了标题所宣告的“财富”的研究，还研究了国家财政、自罗马时代以来欧洲的经济发展，提供了对各种经济政策概念的批评以及许多人们通常不会在一项经济研究中预期的内容（比如关于早期教会中主教选举的方式的描述）。 史密斯将财富理解为可用的消费品和奢侈品的数量。它取决于为生产贡献的人数，尤其是取决于劳动的生产力。他调查的对象（在包含其作品理论核心的第一卷中）是 “这种在劳动的生产力中改进的原因，以及它的产出自然在社会中不同阶层和条件的人之间分配的顺序”（史密斯1776，第10-11页）。 史密斯的问题设定，将生产中不仅仅看作社会关系，而是视为生产力，并且在分配中寻找一种“自然秩序”，这反映了对经济学的一种自然主义看法。史密斯将劳动，而非特定类型的劳动，作为所有财富的来源，这一点成为他研究整个资产阶级经济系统的明确出发点。早期的劳动价值理论家还没有严格区分商品的使用价值和交换价值。虽然在佩蒂（Petty）那里已经出现了劳动作为价值尺度，但同时他也表达了“劳动是财富的父亲和活跃原则，就如同土地是母亲”（佩蒂1662，第68页）。与之相反，史密斯明确区分了商品的使用价值（“value in use”）和交换价值（“value in exchange”）并且解释说： “具有最大使用价值的东西，通常在交换中几乎没有或根本没有价值；相反，那些在交换中具有最大价值的东西，通常在使用上几乎没有或根本没有价值。”（史密斯1776，第44页） 通过从一开始就排除基于“效用”的任何价值理论，史密斯与从普芬多夫到他的老师赫奇森的价值理论传统决裂。因此，从新古典主义的角度看，史密斯将英国的政治经济学引向了一个遗憾的歧途（比较：道格拉斯1928，罗伯特森和泰勒1957）。相反，马克思视史密斯（和李嘉图）因其劳动价值理论的观点，为资产阶级经济学中最佳的头脑。现在需探讨的是，史密斯和李嘉图的劳动价值理论可以从哪种意义上讲，并且马克思的解读是否公正。 史密斯想要分三步研究“调节商品可交换价值的原则”：首先是要展示商品价值或“实际价格”的“真实尺度”，然后是这些价格的不同组成部分，最后是这些价格组成部分有时高于或低于其“自然率”的情况（史密斯1776，第46页）。 作为商品交换价值的尺度，史密斯确定了劳动。但不是生产这些商品所耗费的劳动量，而是通过交换获得的他人劳动的数量。史密斯解释这一尺度的理由是，一个人在引入分工后，只能通过自己的劳动获得他生活所需的一小部分，因此他依赖于他人的劳动。这样，史密斯明言，财富只有在自己的劳动可以等同于他人的劳动时才与个人劳动有关，即只有在自己的劳动作为社会劳动有效时。但是，史密斯并没有进一步研究这种商品生产劳动的特定社会性。史密斯并没有把交换理解为构成整个社会联系的形式，而只是把它看作两个孤立的商品生产者之间的一个孤立行为。因此，当他进一步解释他的尺度时，转而依靠商品所有者的个人计算是很自然的。 “每一样东西的真实价格，即一个想要获得它的人所需要付出的真实成本，是获取它的辛劳和麻烦。（...）用金钱或商品购买的东西，其购买所需的劳动，和我们通过自己身体的辛劳所获得的一样多。那些金钱或商品实际上为我们节省了这一辛劳。”（史密斯1776，第47页） 在这里，史密斯完全以一种非社会的方式，将劳动看作是孤立的生产者与自然之间的关系。这种与自然的斗争对人类来说首先意味着努力和挑战。 通过交换省去了通过自己的劳动获得某物的努力。通过将节省的劳动作为交换价值的尺度，史密斯将这一尺度建立在以个人利益为导向的、理性的、平等的商品所有者的行为上。在《政治经济学批判》中，马克思正是这样描述史密斯的做法，当他写道，史密斯 “为社会过程中强制完成的不平等劳动间的客观等价，装扮上个体劳动的主观等权性。”（II.2/136f; 13/45） 在这种非社会的交换观念范围内，金钱也就没有一个恰当的位置。史密斯仅将其视为一种便利交换的装置（史密斯1776，第37页及以后）。对他来说，货币和商品之间不存在内在联系。货币领域看起来只是现实领域前的一个纱幕，至少在理论上，这个纱幕随时可以被移除。在这种意义上，史密斯实际上没有真正讨论商品交换，而只是讨论了产品交换（Barter）。 对史密斯而言，商品所有者在交换中建立的特定社会性，最终基于他们个人与自然的艰苦关系。因此，史密斯将社会联系看作是由孤立个体的非社会行为直接构成的。政治经济学的现象因此建立在对被视为“人”的商品所有者经验性的人类学上。史密斯也明确反思了这种人类学。关于分工的起源，他这样写道： “这是一种在人类天性中必要的，尽管非常缓慢和逐渐的后果......交换一样东西换取另一样东西的倾向......这对所有人来说都是共同的，并且在其他任何动物种类中都找不到”（史密斯1776，第25页）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Smith identifiziert also nicht nur jede gesellschaftliche Arbeitsteilung mit Warenproduktion, diese ergibt sich ihm als Folge der menschlichen Natur.20 Er bleibt aber nicht dabei stehen, sondern erklärt den „Hang zum Tausch\\" auch noch funktional: bei fast allen Tiergattungen sei das erwachsene Individuum unabhängig und benötige keinen Beistand. Der Mensch aber sei auf die Hilfe seiner Mitmenschen angewiesen, könne allerdings kaum auf deren Wohlwollen rechnen. Er könne daher nur zum Ziele kommen „if he can interest their self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them\\" (Smith 1776, S.26). Letztlich wird der „Hang zum Tausch\\" durch die wechselseitige Gleichgültigkeit der Menschen begründet. Die Fremdheit der voneinander isolierten Warenbesitzer wird so zum ontologischen Datum, von dem aus sich die gesamte Ökonomie erschließt. In Smith' Diskussion der Arbeitsteilung, des Wertmaßes Arbeit und des Geldes werden wesentliche Elemente des zugrundeliegenden theoretischen Feldes deutlich. Sowohl der Anthropologismus, der von einem bestimmten „Wesen\\" des Menschen ausgeht, das für Smith mit dem des Warenbesitzers zusammenfällt, als auch der Individualismus, der den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang von den vereinzelten, einander fremden Individuen her rekonstruiert, gehen als selbstverständliche Voraussetzungen in die Smithsche Argumentation ein. Nachdem Smith das Maß des Wertes oder ihren „wirklichen Preis\\" bestimmt hat, geht er, wie angekündigt, daran, die Bestandteile dieses wirklichen Preises zu untersuchen. Smith unterscheidet zwischen dem „real measure of value\\" und dem „regulator of value\\".21 Daß der Wert einer Ware durch die von ihr kommandierte fremde Arbeit gemessen wird, sagt noch nichts darüber aus, wieviel fremde Arbeit von einer Ware kommandiert wird. Es muß die Regel, die die Wertgröße einer Ware bestimmt, erst noch angegeben werden. Und hier stellt Smith einen Unterschied zwischen vorkapitalistischen und kapitalistischen Verhältnissen fest. Für die vorkapitalistischen Zeiten gilt: „In that early and rade state of society which precedes both the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land, the proportion between the quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different objects seems to be the only circumstance which can afford any rale for exchanging them for one another.(...) In this state of things, the whole produce of labour belongs to the labourer; and the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, is the only circumstance which can regulate the quantity of labour which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or exchange for.\\" (Smith 1776, S.65) Die Regel, die hier die Arbeitsmenge bestimmt, die mit einer Ware gekauft werden kann, erhält Smith nicht durch empirische Beobachtung. Es handelt sich vielmehr um ein empirisch-spekulatives Modell, das aufgrund eines Ge-dankenexperimentes gewonnen wurde: zwei Warenproduzenten, die lediglich ihrem eigenen Interesse folgen, werden einander in einer fiktiven Situation (Tausch auf einem Markt aber Produktion ohne Kapital) gegenübergestellt. Aus diesen Grundannahmen wird ihr Verhalten deduziert: weil j edem Warenproduzent die Herstellung seiner eigenen Ware Mühe bereitet, wird er sie nicht gegen Waren austauschen, deren Produktion ihm weniger Mühe verursachen würde. Demnach ist die fremde Arbeit, die ich für meine Ware erhalte, Maß ihres Wertes und die eigene Arbeit, die ich zur Produktion meiner Ware aufwenden muß, ist die Regel, die bestimmt wieviel fremde Arbeit ich erhalte (nämlich gerade genauso viel). Insofern Arbeit hier Maß des Werts und Regulator der Wertgröße ist, kann man von einer Arbeitswerttheorie sprechen. Entgegen der mit dem Marginalismus üblich gewordenen Unterscheidung in „objektive\\" Arbeitswertlehre und „subjektive\\" Nutzenlehre des Werts, haben wir es bei Smith aber mit einer subjektiven Arbeitswerttheorie zu tun: sowohl Maß als auch Regulator des Werts werden mit dem am Nutzen des Warenbesitzers orientierten, subjektiven Interesse begründet. Mit der Bildung von Kapital ändern sich aber die Bedingungen, unter denen der Tausch stattfindet, womit auch eine andere Interessenkonstellation entsteht. Dadurch erfährt zwar nicht das Maß des Wertes, fremde Arbeit, eine Veränderung, denn dieses Maß beruht einzig darauf, daß Arbeit Mühe kostet und fremde Arbeit somit Mühe erspart. Es ändert sich jetzt aber die gerade abgeleitete Regel für die Bestimmung der Wertgröße: „As soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons, some of them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious people, whom they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order to make a profit by the sale of their work, or by what their labour adds to the value of the materials... The value which the workmen add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case into two parts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits of their employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he advanced. He could have no interest to employ them, unless he expected from the sale of their work something more than what was sufficient to replace his stock to him; and he could have no interest to employ a great stock rather than a small one, unless his profits were to bear some proportion to the extent of his stock.\\" (ebd., S.65f) Über die Möglichkeit der „accumulation of stock\\" und der Herkunft der „in- dustrious people\\" macht sich Smith keine Gedanken, er unterstellt beides als Bedingungen kapitalistischer Produktion. Sind aber diese Bedingungen gegeben, so muß es auch Profit als Anreiz zur Investition geben und zwar einen Profit, der im Verhältnis zur Größe des Kapitals steht, als Anreiz zu immer größerer Investition. Smith faßt Profit sofort als Durchschnittsprofit auf und macht ihn damit explizit zu einer vom Arbeitslohn unterschiedenen, eigenständige Einkommenskategorie, was im 18. Jahrhundert noch keineswegs selbstverständlich war. Die Gestalt des Profits als Durchschnittsprofit erklärt er einfach mit dem „natürlichen Interesse\\" des Kapitalbesitzers, genauso wie er oben die alte Regel auf das Interesse der Warenbesitzer zurückgeführt hatte. Daß der Durchschnittsprofit aber überhaupt existiert, nimmt Smith einfach als eine empirische Tatsache auf. Hier wird der Empirismus als ein weiteres Moment des theoretischen Feldes, von dem aus Smith argumentiert, deutlich. Ökonomische Tatsachen, wie die Existenz eines Durchschnittsprofits, erscheinen als einfache Gegebenheiten, die aus dem Realobjekt abgelesen werden können, ohne daß noch eine begriffliche Vermittlung notwendig wäre. Mit der Existenz des Profits ändert sich nun zwar nicht das Wertmaß (kommandierte Arbeit) aber die Regel, die bestimmt, welche Menge Arbeit von einer Ware kommandiert wird: „In this state of things, the whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him. Neither is the quantity of labour commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity, the only circumstance which can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase, command, or exchange for. An additional quantity, it is evident, must be due for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished the materials of that labour.\\" (ebd., S.67) Da meistens auch noch Grundrente gezahlt werden muß, so Smith weiter, bildet auch sie einen Umstand, der bestimmt, wieviel Arbeit eine Ware kommandieren kann. Die Ausgaben für Rohmaterial werden von Smith rekursiv ebenfalls in Löhne, Profite und Renten aufgelöst, so daß er als Ergebnis erhält: „Wages, profit and rent, are the three original sources of all revenue as well as of all exchangeable value\\" (ebd., S.69). Reicht der Preis einer Ware gerade hin, um die „natürlichen\\" Raten der Löhne, Profite und Renten (so nennt Smith ihre in einem bestimmten Land zu einer bestimmten Zeit üblichen Sätze) zu zahlen, so wird diese Ware zu ihrem „natürlichen Preis\\" verkauft: „The commodity is then sold precisely for what it is worth, or for what it really costs the person who brings it to market\\" (ebd., S.72).”翻译为中文","output":"因此，史密斯不仅将每一种社会劳动分工都与商品生产等同，这种等同对他来说是人类天性的结果。他不仅止步于此，还将“交换的倾向”解释为功能性的：几乎所有动物种类中的成年个体都是独立的，不需要别人的帮助。但人类却依赖于同类的帮助，却几乎不能指望他们的好意。因此，他只能通过唤起他人的自爱，向他们展示做他要求的事情对他们自己有利，来达到他的目的（史密斯1776，第26页）。最终，“交换的倾向”是由人们之间的相互冷漠所决定的。彼此孤立的商品所有者之间的陌生性成为了整个经济学可解的本体论数据。 在史密斯对劳动分工、劳动作为价值尺度和货币的讨论中，成为基础理论领域的重要元素显而易见。从某个特定的“人类本质”出发的人类学思想，对于史密斯来讲，这个本质与商品所有者的本质重合，以及从孤立的、彼此陌生的个体中重构社会联系的个体主义，作为史密斯论证的理所当然的前提。在史密斯确定了价值的尺度或其“真实价格”后，如他所宣布的，他开始研究这个真实价格的组成部分。史密斯区分了“真实价值尺度”和“价值调节器”之间的区别。尽管商品的价值由其指挥的外部劳动来测量，但这还并未说明一种商品可以指挥多少外部劳动。还必须指出决定一种商品价值大小的规则。在此，史密斯在前资本主义和资本主义关系之间发现了差异。对于前资本主义时期，他认为： “在那个既没有积累资本也没有土地私有化的社会的早期和原始状态中，为获取不同物件所需的劳动量的比例似乎是唯一能够提供交换它们彼此的规则的情况。（...）在这种状态下，劳动的全部产出属于劳动者；而通常用于获取或生产任何商品的劳动量，是唯一能够调节它通常应该购买、指挥或交换的劳动量的情况。”（史密斯1776，第65页） 这里决定一种商品可以购买多少劳动的规则不是通过经验观察得来的。而是一种经验-推测模型，通过一个思想实验获得：两个仅遵循自身利益的商品生产者，在一个虚构的情境中（市场上的交换但不涉及资本生产）被对立起来。从这些基本假设中推导出他们的行为：因为每个商品生产者制造自己的商品都要费力，他们不会用自己的商品去交换那些生产起来对他们来说较少费力的商品。因此，我为我的商品所获得的外部劳动，是其价值的尺度，而我必须投入到我的商品生产中的自身劳动，则是决定我能获得多少外部劳动的规则（即同样多）。因此，在这里劳动既是价值尺度又是价值大小的调节器，可以说是一种劳动价值理论。与边际主义惯用的区分“客观”劳动价值理论和“主观”价值的效用理论不同，在史密斯这里，我们却有一种主观的劳动价值理论：价值的尺度和调节器都用商品所有者以自身利益为导向的主观兴趣来理由。 但随着资本的形成，交换发生的条件发生了变化，从而产生了另一种利益构成，从而虽然价值尺度（外部劳动）没有变，因为劳动费力而外部劳动因此节省了劳动，但现在决定价值大小的刚才推导出的规则却发生了变化： “一旦资本在特定个人手中积累起来，他们中的一些人自然会利用这些资本让勤奋的人工作，他们会为这些工人提供材料和生计，以便通过出售他们的工作或他们的劳动增加到材料上的价值来获利……工人增加到材料上的价值，因此在这种情况下分解为两部分，其中一部分支付他们的工资，另一部分为他们的雇主在他提前支付的整个存货和工资上获得的利润。除非他期望从他们的工作销售中获得的东西超过足够替他回补他的存货，否则他没有利益雇用他们；除非他的利润与他的资本规模成一定比例，否则他也没有兴趣使用大量资本而非小量资本。”（同上，第65-66页） 史密斯对“资本积累”和“勤奋的人”是从何而来不做思考，他将这两者假设为资本主义生产的条件。但如果这些条件成立，那么就必须存在利润作为投资的激励，且这种利润要与资本的大小成比例，作为更大投资的激励。史密斯立即将利润视为平均利润，并因此将其明确作为一个不同于劳动工资的独立收入类别，这在18世纪还远非常规。他简单地用资本拥有者的“自然兴趣”来解释作为平均利润的利润形态，正如他之前将旧规则归因于商品所有者的兴趣。 但平均利润的存在史密斯只是作为一个经验事实接受。这里的经验主义作为史密斯论证的另一个理论字段中的元素显现得清晰。经济事实，如平均利润的存在，看起来就是简单的给定事实，可以直接从实物对象中读取，而无需任何概念的媒介。 随着利润的存在，虽然价值尺度（指挥的劳动）没有变，但决定一种商品可以指挥多少劳动量的规则发生了变化： “在这种情况下，劳动的全部产出并不总是归劳动者所有。他在大多数情况下必须与雇佣他的资本所有者分享。通常用于获取或生产任何商品的劳动量，并不是能够调节它通常应该购买、指挥或交换的劳动量的唯一情况。很明显，必须额外支付一定数量的利润给提前支付工资和提供那些劳动材料的资本。”（同上，第67页） 由于大多数情况下还需要支付地租，所以史密斯接着说，它也构成了决定一种商品可以指挥多少劳动的情况之一。史密斯将原材料的开支也递归地分解为工资、利润和租金，因此他得出的结果是： “工资、利润和租金是所有收入以及所有可交换价值的三个原始来源。”（同上，第69页） 如果一种商品的价格刚好足以支付工资、利润和租金的“自然”率（史密斯称之为在特定国家在特定时间的通常率），那么这种商品就以其“自然价格”出售： “那时商品就被精确地按照它的真实价值出售，或者按照它真正花费带到市场上的人的成本出售。”（同上，第72页）"},{"instruction":"请将“Was den Regulator der Wertgröße angeht, wird Smith hier zum Begründer einer Produktionskostentheorie des Werts, die im 19. Jahrhundert von JeanBaptiste Say und John Stuart Mill aufgenommen wird und sich schließlich auch bei Alfred Marshall wiederfindet. Die Werttheorie wird hier identisch mit der Verteilungstheorie. Die Wertgröße einer Ware konstituiert sich jetzt aus den „natürlichen\\" Erträgen der bei ihrer Produktion zum Einsatz kommenden Faktoren Arbeit, Kapital und Boden. Smith ist nun, wie in der Einleitung zu Wealth of Nations angekündigt, bei der „natürlichen Verteilung\\" des Produkts unter die verschiedenen Klassen angelangt. Allerdings gelingt es Smith nicht, die „natürlichen Raten\\" dieser Erträge wirklich zu bestimmen. Für den Arbeitslohn gibt er die Subsistenz des Arbeiters als Untergrenze an, womit er sich allerdings in einen logischen Zirkel verstrickt: die Warenpreise hängen von der natürlichen Rate des Arbeitslohns ab und diese ist wiederum durch die Warenpreise bestimmt. Die Profitrate sei gleich dem Zinssatz zuzüglich einer Risikoprämie. Zum Zins kann Smith aber nur die Aussage machen, daß er durch das Verhältnis von Angebot und Nachfrage nach Darlehen geregelt sei. Die Grundrente bestimmt Smith schließlich als Monopolpreis für die Benutzung des Landes, sie ist dann aber nicht Ursache, sondern Folge der Höhe der Warenpreise und insofern doch keine „Quelle\\" des Werts. Vom „natürlichen Preis\\" unterscheidet Smith den aktuellen Marktpreis. In einem System „vollkommener Freiheit\\" wird die Konkurrenz Lohn, Profit und Rente auf ihre „natürlichen\\" Raten reduzieren, so daß die Marktpreise zu den natürlichen Preisen hin tendieren werden (Smith 1776, S.73ff). Die natürlichen Preise sind Preise eines langfristigen Gleichgewichts und das Wirken der Konkurrenz garantiert, daß dieses Gleichgewicht erreicht wird. Allerdings handelt es sich bei Smith nicht um ein statisches, sondern um ein dynamisches Gleichgewicht, das sich erst im Verlauf der Kapitalakkumulation einstellt.22 Weder dieses Gleichgewicht noch der aus dem Wachstum der Ökonomie entspringende allgemeine Wohlstand wird von dem Einzelnen bewußt angestrebt und doch sind sie das Resultat seines Handelns: „He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the publick interest nor knows how much he is promoting it... he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.\\" (Smith 1776, S.456) Während der Merkantilismus die Einheit der Ökonomie durch das Wirken des Souveräns und nur dadurch gewährleistet sah, formuliert Smith hier die entgegengesetzte Anschauung: aus der „natürlichen\\" Neigung der Einzelnen, ihre Interessen zu verfolgen, folgt kein Chaos, sondern eine „natürliche Ordnung\\". Diese Ordnung ist natürlich, insofern sie der menschlichen Natur entspricht, und daher auch jeder künstlichen Ordnung, sei sie nun am Willen des Souveräns oder an irgendwelchen Idealen ausgerichtet, überlegen. Somit ist gezeigt: die bürgerliche Gesellschaft ist die beste aller möglichen Welten. 3. Smith als Mehrwerttheoretiker (Zur Kritik an Marx' Klassik-Rezeption Teil I) Ausfuhrlich setzte sich Marx in den Theorien über den Mehrwert mit Smith auseinander. Marx wirft Smith dort vor, daß er „die Bestimmung des Werths der Waaren durch die Quantität der zu ihrer Production erheischten Arbeit bald verwechselt mit, bald verdrängt durch das Quantum lebendiger Arbeit, womit Waare gekauft werden kann\\" (11.3.2/364; 26.1/41). Daß Smith zwei verschiedene Wertbestimmungen nebeneinander verwendet, erklärt Marx damit, daß Smith zunächst von der Ware ausgeht und daß bei vorkapitalistischer Warenproduktion das ganze Produkt dem Produzenten gehört. Die fremde Arbeit, die ich mit meiner Ware kommandieren kann, ist dann immer die in der anderen Ware vergegenständlichte Arbeit. Die beiden Wertbestimmungen fallen daher zusammen. Bei Betrachtung kapitalistischer Verhältnisse, so Marx weiter, würde Smith aber bemerken, daß sich die lebendige Arbeit des Lohnarbeiters nicht mehr gegen dasselbe Quantum vergegenständlichter Ware austauscht und daher schließen, „daß die Arbeitszeit nicht mehr das immanente Maaß ist, das den Tauschwerth der Waaren regelt\\" (II.3.2/366; 26.1/44). Smith habe seine zunächst richtige Wertbestimmung durch Arbeitszeit aufgegeben und identifiziere Wert jetzt mit der dem Schein der Konkurrenz geschuldeten Vorstellung vom „natürlichen Preis\\" (II.3.2/862f, 879f; 26.2/215, 233f). Marx wird mit seiner Kritik Smith allerdings nicht ganz gerecht, da er die Smithsche Unterscheidung zwischen Maß des Werts und Regel, die die Wertgröße bestimmt, ineins setzt: das Smithsche Wertmaß und die Regel, die den vorkapitalistischen Zustand beherrscht, wird von Marx als mehr oder weniger korrekte Arbeitswerttheorie aufgefaßt (Wert wird durch die in der Produktion verausgabte Arbeitszeit bestimmt), die Smith bei Betrachtung kapitalistischer Verhältnisse dann einfach über den Haufen wirft. Wie im vorangegangenen Abschnitt gezeigt, hält Smith aber (entgegen der Marx- schen Unterstellung) am Maß des Wertes (kommandierte fremde Arbeit) durchgängig fest. Die bei der Produktion der Ware verausgabte Arbeitszeit ist kein zweites Maß, sondern die Regel, die im vorkapitalistischen Zustand bestimmt, wieviel Arbeit von einer Ware kommandiert wird. Daß diese Regel unter kapitalistischen Verhältnissen für die empirisch zu konstatierenden Tauschverhältnisse nicht gilt, wird auch von Marx nicht bestritten.23 Das Problem bei Smith ist nicht, daß er so inkonsistent wäre, wie Marx ihm vor-wirft, sondern daß er sich mit der bloß empirischen Konstatierung dieser beiden Regeln begnügt. Anders ausgedrückt: innerhalb seines theoretischen Feldes ist die Smithsche Argumentation konsistent, allerdings läßt sich dieses Feld der Kritik unterziehen. Marx billigt Smith allerdings zu, daß seine Konfusion in der Werttheorie keine Auswirkungen auf „die Entwicklung des Mehrwerths im Allgemeinen\\" (II.3.2/368; 26.1/45) habe. Sein Urteil, Smith habe „den wahren Ursprung des Mehrwerths erkannt\\" (II.3.2/372; 26.1/51), stützt Marx vor allem auf den bereits oben zitierten Satz von Smith, „the value, which the workmen add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case, into two parts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits\\" (Smith 1776, S.66), den er folgen-dermaßen kommentiert: „Hier also erklärt Smith ausdrücklich: der Profit, der beim Verkauf des ouvrage fini gemacht wird, rührt nicht aus dem Verkauf selbst her... Der Werth, d.h. das Quantum Arbeit, das die Arbeiter dem Material zutheilen, zerfallt vielmehr in 2 Theile. Der eine zahlt ihre salaire.. .Der andre Theil bildet den Profit des Kapitalisten...\\" (11.3.2/372; 26.1/50). Und da Smith auch die Rente auf einen Teil des Produktes der Arbeit des Arbeiters zurückführte (Smith 1776, S.67), kommt Marx zu dem Ergebnis: „A.Smith faßt also den Mehrwerth, nähmlich die Surplusarbeit... als die allgemeine Categorie auf, wovon der eigentliche Profit und die Grundrente nur Abzweigungen. Dennoch hat er den Mehrwerth als solchen nicht als eigne Categorie geschieden von den besondren Formen, die er in Profit und Grundrente erhält.\\" (11.3.2/375; 26.1/53) Allerdings formulierte Smith selbst nicht nur keine explizite Mehrwerttheorie, für die kapitalistischen Verhältnisse ist ihm der Tauschwert nicht einmal durch die zur Produktion notwendige Arbeitszeit, sondern als Summe der selbständigen Größen Lohn, Profit und Rente gegeben. Marx ist daher zu dem Schluß gezwungen, daß „nachdem A. Smith die Natur des Mehrwerths und des Werths entwickelt, er mit Unrecht, Capital und Grund und Boden als selbstständige Quellen des Tauschwerths darstellt.\\" (II.3.2/384f; 26.1/65)”翻译为中文","output":"在价值规模的调节器方面，史密斯成为生产成本价值理论的奠基人，这一理论在19世纪被让-巴蒂斯特·赛伊和约翰·斯图尔特·密尔采纳，并最终也出现在阿尔弗雷德·马歇尔的作品中。这里的价值理论与分配理论成为一体。商品的价值规模现在构成于其生产过程中所投入的劳动、资本和土地这些因素的“自然”收益上。 史密斯现在，如同在《国富论》的引言中所宣布的，到达了对产品在不同阶层之间的“自然分配”。然而，史密斯未能真正确定这些收益的“自然率”。对于劳动工资，他将工人的生存下限作为底线，这使他陷入一个逻辑圈：商品价格依赖于劳动工资的自然率，而这又被商品价格所决定。他认为利润率等同于利率加上风险溢价。关于利率，史密斯只能说它由贷款的供求关系所决定。最后，史密斯将地租确定为使用土地的垄断价格，然而这并不是商品价格高低的原因，而是结果，因此它并不是价值的“源泉”。 史密斯将“自然价格”与实际市场价格区分开来。在一个“完全自由”的体系中，竞争会将工资、利润和地租降至它们的“自然”率，使市场价格趋向自然价格（史密斯1776，第73页及以后）。自然价格是长期均衡价格，竞争的作用保证达到这一均衡。然而，对史密斯来说，这不是一个静态的，而是一个动态的均衡，只有在资本积累过程中才会实现。这个均衡以及由经济增长带来的普遍福祉并非个人有意追求的结果，然而它们正是他的行为结果： “他通常确实既不打算促进公共利益，也不知道他在多大程度上促进了公共利益 ... 他只是追求自己的利益，而在这一点上，如在许多其他情况下，他被一只看不见的手引导去促进一个他自己并非意图的目的。”（史密斯1776，第456页） 而商业主义（Mercantilism）看到经济的统一是通过君主的作用，而只有通过这种方式来保证，史密斯在这里表达了相反的观点：从个人“自然”倾向于追求自己利益出发，并不会导致混乱，而是一种“自然秩序”。这种秩序之所以是自然的，因为它符合人类的本性，因此也优于任何人为秩序，无论这种人为秩序是基于君主意志还是任何理想。因此展示了：资产阶级社会是所有可能世界中最好的。 3. 史密斯作为剩余价值理论家 （对马克思的古典学派接受批评 第一部分） 马克思在《剩余价值理论》中详尽地讨论了史密斯。马克思在那里指责史密斯 “时而混淆，时而取代商品的价值是由其生产所需的劳动数量决定的，以及可以用商品购买的活劳动量”（II.3.2/364; 26.1/41）。 马克思认为史密斯同时使用两种不同的价值决定法，因为史密斯首先从商品出发，在前资本主义商品生产中，产品全部属于生产者。 我能用我的商品指挥的外部劳动，那时总是其他商品中具体化的劳动。因此，两种价值决定法实际上合而为一。马克思继续指出，在考虑资本主义条件时，史密斯注意到雇佣劳动者的活劳动不再能交换相同量的具体化商品，因此得出结论，“劳动时间不再是调节商品交换价值的内在尺度”（II.3.2/366; 26.1/44）。史密斯放弃了他最初根据劳动时间确定的正确价值决定方法，并现在将价值等同于因竞争而形成的“自然价格”的假象（II.3.2/862f, 879f; 26.2/215, 233f）。然而，马克思对史密斯的批评并不完全公正，因为他将史密斯之间的价值尺度与决定价值规模的规则视为一体：史密斯的价值尺度和在前资本主义状态下控制的规则被马克思视为或多或少正确的劳动价值理论（价值由生产过程中消耗的劳动时间决定），这些在考察资本主义条件时被史密斯简单抛弃。正如前一节中所展示的，史密斯（与马克思的假设相反）始终坚持价值尺度（指挥的外部劳动）。在生产商品过程中消耗的劳动时间不是第二个尺度，而是在前资本主义状态下决定一种商品可以指挥多少劳动的规则。尽管马克思也没有争议这个规则在资本主义条件下不适用于经验上可观察到的交换关系。史密斯的问题不是他像马克思指责的那样不一致，而是他满足于仅仅是对这两个规则的经验性陈述。换句话说：在他的理论框架内，史密斯的论证是一致的，但这个框架本身可以被批判。 马克思承认史密斯在价值理论中的混淆并不影响“剩余价值的总体发展”（II.3.2/368; 26.1/45）。他基于史密斯的句子“工人加到材料上的价值，因此，在这种情况下分解为两部分，其中一部分支付他们的工资，另一部分则是利润”（史密斯1776，第66页）支持他的判断，史密斯已经“认识到剩余价值的真正来源”（II.3.2/372; 26.1/51），他这样评论道： “因此，史密斯明确地解释说：通过出售最终产品获得的利润，并非来自于销售本身...加到材料上的价值，即劳动的数量，分解为两部分。一部分支付他们的薪资...另一部分构成了资本家的利润...”（II.3.2/372; 26.1/50） 由于史密斯还将地租追溯到工人劳动的一部分产品（史密斯1776，第67页），马克思得出结论： “因此，亚当·史密斯将剩余价值，即剩余劳动...作为一般类别，而实际的利润和地租只是它的分支。尽管如此，他并没有将剩余价值本身作为一个独立类别，区别于它在利润和地租中所接受的特殊形式。”（II.3.2/375; 26.1/53） 然而，史密斯本人不仅没有明确提出剩余价值理论，对于资本主义关系，对他而言交换价值甚至不是由生产所需的劳动时间，而是由独立的大小：工资、利润和地租之和所给出。因此，马克思被迫得出结论： “在亚当·史密斯发展了剩余价值和价值的本质之后，他错误地将资本和土地表现为交换价值的独立来源。”（II.3.2/384f; 26.1/65）"},{"instruction":"Let Us Study Every day in our lives, we encounter different people whom we need to interact with, and to get along with. In order to establish a harmonious relationship with Music is a form of art that combines vocal or instrumental sounds to create a composition. 5 them, we need to develop a good conversational skill to become an effective communicator. What you are going to learn in this module will help you develop your skill to become more effective communicator and conversationalist. Activity 1: Figure It Out! The table below is called the K-W-L Chart. All information that you will fill in the table will help you know the word and even extend it to a sentence. Example, the word is EXPAND. What do you know about this word? Write your answer in that column. Moving on, what do you want to know about the word extend? What is in this word that you want to discover? Again, write it directly in the third column. However, for the last column, What I Learned, you can only fill in the box after you have learned something from the inputs, discussions, or Let Us Study portion of this module. After which try to figure out the things you learned upon doing the given tasks. From then on, you can go back and answer the last column box. Word What I KNOW What I WANT to Know What I LEARNED expand What have you observed from the table? What do you think you are doing? Do you have already an idea on what you are about to learn today? Those are what we are going to discover later. Are you ready? You will be acquainted more of this lesson as you move further and explore the different activities provided for you in this module. Activity 2: Remember Me At this time, I would like you to exercise your memory. You do not have to worry because this activity would somehow sharpen your mind and you are guided in completing the task. I am sure you will enjoy doing it. Look closely at the table below. Make it sure that you will fill in the boxes by following carefully to the instructions. 1. What picture or image can you remember for each word? Draw it inside the box. 2. What information can you tell about each? Write in the third box. 3. How will you define the word using the information that you have? Write in the fourth box. The first word is done for you. So, it is your turn to do the others. 6 Word/s Picture/ Image Information Own Definition Coronavirus 19 • a deadly coronavirus • dangerous • pandemic • unsafe Coronavirus 19 is a kind of deadly coronavirus that has killed thousands of lives. Typhoon Nature Now, do you have any idea of what we are doing? Yes, you are correct! We are extending or expanding the word! Just imagine, from a simple one word, you are now able to expand it longer making it into a sentence by just adding up the information that you know. What you have just done is actually an example of extended or expanded definition of words. To understand fully the lesson, consider the given information below. What is an expanded definition of words? Expanded definition defines and explains a single term, concept, or object. In defining a term, all you need to do is to be familiar with these components: 7 TERM/ CONCEPT/ WORD is the word to be defined. GENUS/ CLASS is to which the term being defined belong. DIFFERENTIA refers to the details about the term that distinguish it from other members of the class or what makes the term different from another item in the category. You may also follow the pattern in expanding the definition of the word. PATTERN: Word/concept/ term = class/ genus + differentia/ distinguishing characteristics Examples: term/word class/ genus differentia 1. Coronavirus 19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. 2. Nature is the phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth. TERM/ CONCEPT GENUS/ CLASS DIFFERENTIA Nature the phenomena of the physical world including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth 8 Another way of expanding a word is through this illustration. Observe very carefully how it is done. Steps to expand a definition of word using the illustration above: 1. First, classify the word. 2. Second, picture out its image. 3. Next, gather factual information about the word. 4. Then, identify its key traits and characteristics. 5. After which identify what are those from your lists can be and cannot be included in forming the definition of the word. 6. Lastly, use the pattern in the formulation of an expanded definition of word. For instance, based on the illustration above, how will you define flood? It may be: term class differentia • Flood is a body of water that rises, overflows, and submerges dry lands. term class differentia • Flood is a body of water that overflows caused by heavy rain which damages properties and lives.","output":"The given text does a great job of introducing the concept of expanding definitions and the importance of conversational skills in everyday life.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 6 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that makes it so that every other turn, I regress physically and mentally into a 6-year-old girl, and as such my stats also regress to the stats of a mere beginner. So in the context of the duel, in odd numbered turns I’m 16, and in even numbered turns I’m 6. I’m not self aware of these changes that happen to me every turn. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the casting is still successful but the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win.

Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for Lily and one for me, and when I'm regressed, my spells by default turn into baby spells. (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 6 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that makes it so that every other turn, I regress physically and mentally into a 6-year-old girl, and as such my stats also regress to the stats of a mere beginner. So in the context of the duel, in odd numbered turns I’m 16, and in even numbered turns I’m 6. I’m not self aware of these changes that happen to me every turn. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the casting is still successful but the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for Lily and one for me, and when I’m regressed, my spells by default turn into baby versions. (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker. Lily’s spells additionally add up points to a meter that when full will allow her to cast an epic spell that’ll permanently regress Sapphire. Add a tracker for the meter as well.","output":"For this intricate fantasy scenario, I'll outline the premise and then follow through with your role as Sapphire, the current teenage champion of magical dueling, and your unexpected challenge against the young prodigy, Lily. **Age & Spellcasting Stats (out of 100)** - **Sapphire (16 years old)**: Spell Power: 95, Performance: 90 - **Sapphire (6 years old)**: Spell Power: 30, Performance: 50 - **Lily**: Spell Power: 70, Performance: 75 **Spell Requirements & Points Trackers** Spells have a base score which can be modified by successful casting, the caster's performance, and the difficulty of the spell.
