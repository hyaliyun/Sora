Diagonals in a convex hexagon can be of two types: main diagonals (diagonals that connect opposite vertices) and non-main diagonals (all other diagonals). 4.

Consider the partial sums:        [        b_0 = 0, quad b_1 = a_1, quad b_2 = a_1 + a_2, quad ldots, quad b_{40} = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{40}        ]      - Since there are 41 elements b_0, b_1, ldots, b_{40} and only 40 possible remainders when divided by 40, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must exist b_i and b_j (with i < j) such that:        [        b_i equiv b_j pmod{40}        ]      - This implies:        [        b_j - b_i = a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + cdots + a_j quad text{is divisible by 40.}        ]      - Given that no single sum of numbers equals 40 and knowing that each number is a natural number (thus geq 1), the minimal sum that is divisible by 40 and allowable in the sequence is 80.     2. **Bounding the Total Number of Numbers**    - **Hypothesis**: Let's assume ( n > 1019 ) numbers were written.      - Segment the sequence into blocks of 40 numbers each. We would have  leftlfloor frac{n}{40} rightrfloor  blocks.      - Given the lemma, each block of 40 numbers has a sum of at least 80. Suppose there are 25 such full blocks:        [        25 cdot 40 = 1000 text{ numbers.}        ]      - These 1000 numbers contribute a minimum sum of:        [        25 cdot 80 = 2000.        ] 3. **Remaining Numbers**    - The remaining numbers, being at least ( n - 1000 geq 20 ), must add up:      [      text{At least } 20 text{ since each } geq 1.      ]    - Thus, the total sum:      [      2000 + 20 = 2020.      ]    - However, this contradicts the given total sum, which is exactly 2019. Hence, n cannot exceed 1019. 4. **Constructive Example**    - Consider the construction:      - 25 groups of numbers each containing 39 ones and 1 forty-one (total of 1000 numbers):        [        25 times 41 + 1000 times 1 = 25 times 41 + 1000 = 1025 + 1000 = 2025.        ]      - Subtract 6 to balance to 2019 using ( 6 ) additional ones:        - Creating a sequence of total:        [        1000 + 25 times 41 + 19 = 2019        ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{1019} ]"},{"instruction":"A digit is written to the right of the units digit of 1234.

In this case, the boat sinks by 1 cm when the man gets on it, which means the volume of water displaced by the boat is equal to the volume of the boat that sinks below the water level due to the man's weight. First, we need to calculate the volume of water displaced by the boat when the man gets on it. The volume of water displaced (V) can be calculated using the formula: V = L × B × h where L is the length of the boat, B is the breadth of the boat, and h is the height by which the boat sinks (in meters).

Therefore, the statement that there exists a city from which one can travel to any other city holds for any number of cities by mathematical induction. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given that (sin alpha + 2 cos beta = 2), find the range of the expression  [ y = sin left(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right) + 2 sin left(beta + frac{pi}{4}right) ]","output":"1. **Given Equation:**    We start with the given equation:    [    sin alpha + 2 cos beta = 2    ] 2. **Expression for ( y ):**    We need to find the value range for:    [    y = sin left( alpha + frac{pi}{4} right) + 2 sin left( beta + frac{pi}{4} right)    ] 3. **Trigonometric Identities:**    Using the angle addition formulas, we have:    [    sin left( alpha + frac{pi}{4} right) = sin alpha cos frac{pi}{4} + cos alpha sin frac{pi}{4}    ]    [    cos left( frac{pi}{4} right) = sin left( frac{pi}{4} right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}    ]    Therefore:    [    sin left( alpha + frac{pi}{4} right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin alpha + cos alpha)    ] 4. **Similarly for ( beta ):**    [    sin left( beta + frac{pi}{4} right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin beta + cos beta)    ]    Hence:    [    y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin alpha + cos alpha) + 2 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin beta + cos beta)    ]    [    y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin alpha + cos alpha) + sqrt{2} (sin beta + cos beta)    ] 5. **Substitute Given Equation:**    Using the given equation:    [    sin alpha + 2 cos beta = 2    ]    Let:    [    cos alpha + 2 sin beta = t    ] 6. **New Form for ( y ):**    Substituting these, we get:    [    y = sqrt{2} + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} t    ] 7. **Bounding ( t ):**    We know:    [    (cos alpha + 2 sin beta)^2 leq (1 + 2)^2 = 9    ]    Rewriting:    [    t^2 + 4 leq 5 + 4 sin(alpha + beta) leq 9    ]    From the equation (sin alpha + 2 cos beta = 2):    [    (2 - (cos alpha + 2 sin beta))^2 leq 9 implies cos(alpha + beta) leq 1    ]     8. **Range Calculation for ( y ):**    Which implies:    [    t^2 leq 5 implies -sqrt{5} leq t leq sqrt{5}    ]    Plugging bounds for ( t ):    [    y = sqrt{2} + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} t     ]    [    y in left[ sqrt{2} - frac{sqrt{10}}{2}, sqrt{2} + frac{sqrt{10}}{2} right]    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{left[ sqrt{2} - frac{sqrt{10}}{2}, sqrt{2} + frac{sqrt{10}}{2} right]} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that a and b are two different lines, and alpha and beta are two different planes, a sufficient condition for a perp b is ( ) A: a perp alpha, b parallel beta, alpha perp beta B: a parallel alpha, b perp beta, alpha parallel beta C: a perp alpha, b perp beta, alpha parallel beta D: a parallel alpha, b parallel beta, alpha perp beta","output":"A.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identify the Relevant Information**:    - Total pieces after cutting: (20)    - Longest piece after cutting: (8) meters    - Shortest piece after cutting: (2) meters    - The rope was initially divided into (19) equal parts. 2. **Determine the Length of Each Original Part**:    - Since the rope was divided into (19) equal parts and then turned into (20) pieces with known lengths, let's find the length of each part.    - According to the reference solution methodology:       [      text{Length of one part} = frac{text{Longest piece}}{2} + text{Shortest piece}      ] 3. **Substitute the Known Values**:    [    text{Length of one part} = frac{8}{2} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 text{ meters}    ] 4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Rope**:    - The rope was divided into (19) parts, each (6) meters long.    - Total length (L) can be calculated as:      [      L = 19 times 6 = 114 text{ meters}      ] # Conclusion: The length of the rope before it was cut is ( boxed{114 text{ meters}} )."},{"instruction":"Prove that if in a tetrahedron only one edge length is greater than 1, then the volume of the tetrahedron is at most 1 / 8.","output":"1. **Given Statement and Assumption**: Consider a tetrahedron (T = ABCD) such that only one of its edges has a length greater than 1. Suppose (CD > 1), while the rest of the edges are (leq 1). 2. **Repositioning Points to Maximize Volume**: Modify (T) to a new tetrahedron (T_1 = ABC_1D_1) by moving points (C) and (D) along lines parallel to (AB) to positions (C_1) and (D_1) such that they lie in the plane perpendicular to (AB) at its midpoint (S). This does not change the volume, but it positions (C_1) and (D_1) so that none of the edges (C_1A), (C_1B), (D_1A), (D_1B) are greater than 1. 3. **Equal Volumes of Tetrahedra**: The volume (V) of tetrahedron (T) is preserved in tetrahedron (T_1). This is because the areas of triangles (ABC_1) and (ABC), and the perpendicular heights from (D) and (D_1) to the plane (ABC) are equal. 4. **Further Repositioning to Maximize Volume**: Next, move (C_1) within the base plane (ABC) and (D_1) within the plane (ABD) to new positions (C_2) and (D_2) respectively, such that (C_2B = D_2B = 1). 5. **Transforming the Tetrahedron with Respect to Height**: Rotate the plane (ABD_2) such that it is perpendicular to the base (ABC_2), this does not change the conditions for the edges and heights, resulting in a new tetrahedron (T_3 = ABC_2D_3). The new volume (V_3) of (T_3) is at least (V) because the transformations preserve geometric properties ensuring none of the length constraints are violated. 6. **Calculating the Max Volume (V_3)**: Label the length of (AB) as (a) and denote (F) as the midpoint of (AB). The volume of tetrahedron (T_3) is:    [    V_3 = frac{AB cdot FC_2}{2} cdot frac{FD_3}{3} = frac{a cdot left(1 - frac{a^2}{4}right)}{6}    ] 7. **Bounding the Volume**: Given (0 < a leq 1), we need to show that (V_3 leq frac{1}{8}).        Verify:    [    frac{1}{8} - V_3 = frac{1}{24} left(3 - 4a + a^3right) = frac{1}{24} (1 - a)left(3 - a - a^2right) geq 0    ]    The expression ((1 - a)left(3 - a - a^2right)) ensures non-negativity since for (0 < a leq 1), both factors are non-negative. 8. **Conclusion**: Thus, the volume (V_3) of the tetrahedron is maximized and bounded as:     [     V_3 leq frac{1}{8}     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{8}} ]"},{"instruction":"The conclusion of the deductive reasoning If line b is parallel to plane, and line a is in plane α, and line b is parallel to plane α, then line b is parallel to line a is clearly incorrect, because: A.

In this case, the major premise is not well-founded since it assumes that line b being parallel to plane α would imply that it's also parallel to any line in that plane, including line a. However, without additional information about the direction of line a relative to the parallel condition, we cannot conclude line b is parallel to line a. Line b could be either parallel to line a or skew to it. Let us formalize the deductive reasoning sequence: - Major Premise: If a line is parallel to a plane, then it is parallel to every line in the plane. - Minor Premise: Line a is in plane α. - Conclusion: Therefore, line b is parallel to line a because line b is parallel to plane α. The major premise assumes a property (parallelism) of line b with respect to the entire plane α transfers directly to a relation with a specific line a within that plane. In Euclidean geometry, this reasoning is incorrect because being parallel to a plane does not dictate a line's relationship with all lines in the plane. Hence, the major premise is flawed because it suggests that parallelism to a plane extends to parallelism to any line within the plane, which is not true in general space relations. Therefore, option A is correct since the fundamental assumption (major premise) of the reasoning is incorrect, leading to the erroneous conclusion. boxed{text{A}}"},{"instruction":"At Oakwood Academy, there are 15 players on the basketball team.

Let ( k = 2^l ), and ( log_2(n) = m > l ). Using the inequality ( 2^x > x ), we know:    [    2^{frac{mepsilon}{2}} > frac{mepsilon}{2} implies frac{2^{mepsilon}}{cm} > m frac{epsilon^2}{4c} > l frac{epsilon^2}{4c}    ]    The original statement is equivalent to ( 2^{mepsilon} > cm ), so simply choosing ( l = frac{4c}{epsilon^2} ) or ( k = 2^{frac{4c}{epsilon^2}} ) suffices. 3. **Multiset Construction:**    Let the multiset ( A_x ) for ( x in S ) be the multiset of all pairs ( (b(x, y), y) ) for each ( y in S ). 4. **Choosing ( n ) and Applying Pigeonhole Principle:**    Choose ( n > k ) for some value of ( epsilon < frac{1}{6}, c = 4 ). Clearly, this ( k ) will also work for ( c = 2 ) as ( n^{epsilon} > 4 log_2(n) > 2 log_2(n) ). 5. **Prime Power Analysis:**    Assume such a set ( S ) exists. For any ( x, y in S ), let ( b(x, y) ) denote the maximal prime ( p ) such that ( xy ) is a perfect ( p )-th power. By definition, this value always exists. Notice that given ( b(x, y) = p ):    [    xy geq 2^p implies n^2 geq 2^p implies p leq 2 log_2(n)    ]    By the pigeonhole principle, each value ( x in S ) has a prime ( p ) which appears more than ( n^{frac{1}{2}-epsilon} ) times as the first element of each pair in ( A_x ). 6. **Subset Construction and Equivalence Classes:**    Choose the entire set of ( y in S ) whose pair in the multiset has ( p ) as its first element. This entire set satisfies that ( xy ) is a perfect ( p )-th power. If ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_s ) is the set of all primes less than ( n ), and let ( x = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} ldots p_s^{alpha_s} ), then for ( z in S, z = p_1^{beta_1} p_2^{beta_2} ldots p_s^{beta_s} ), ( beta_i equiv p - alpha_i mod p ) for all ( 1 leq i leq s ) is equivalent to ( z in ) the set of ( y ). 7. **Intersection and Size Analysis:**    The size of the intersection of ( [n] ) and an equivalence class modulo ( mathbb{Q}^p ) is at most the number of perfect ( p )-th powers in ( [n] ). Hence, ( n^{frac{1}{p}} ) is greater than this intersection, a subset of which is our set of ( y ). Since ( n^{frac{1}{p}} > |y| > n^{frac{1}{2}-epsilon} > n^{frac{1}{3}} ), clearly ( p < 3 ), hence ( p = 2 ). 8. **Contradiction and Final Conclusion:**    Assume there exists another ( x' in S ) such that ( x' ) is not in the set of ( y ). Since ( b(x, x') ) must be a prime ( p' neq p ), there exist other primes as the first term of elements in ( A_x ). Suppose the size of this set of ( y ) is less or equal to ( frac{|S|}{2} ). In that case, we may choose another prime ( q neq p ) with ( epsilon < frac{1}{6} ) and ( c = 4 ) (n works as defined) to get the property that there are more than ( n^{frac{1}{2}-epsilon} ) in the set of ( z in S ) with first term ( q ), by using pigeonhole on the remaining half of ( S ), not in ( y ). Since this would imply ( q = 2 ) after the same logic as above, reaching a contradiction, it follows that the size of the set of ( y ) is more than ( frac{|S|}{2} ).    Let the construction of the set of ( y ) for ( x' ) be the set of ( y' ). Since if the product of two numbers is a perfect square (( p=2 )) then they are in the same equivalence class modulo ( mathbb{Q}^2 ) as ( 0 equiv alpha_i + beta_i equiv alpha_i - beta_i mod 2 ) for ( x = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} ldots p_s^{alpha_s}, y = p_1^{beta_1} p_2^{beta_2} ldots p_s^{beta_s} ), hence ( x' ) itself is also inside the set of ( y' ). Since nothing in particular was assumed of ( x ), it also follows that the size of the set of ( y' ) is ( > frac{|S|}{2} ), so the set of ( y ) and the set of ( y' ) cannot be disjoint subsets of ( |S| ), so let the shared element be ( g ). Assume the set of ( y ) is not equal to the set of ( y' ), then there is an element in ( y ) not in ( y' ) or an element in ( y' ) not in ( y ). Call this element ( h ). Then since ( h ) is equivalent to ( g ) using one set's property and also not equivalent to ( g ) using the other set's property when modulo ( mathbb{Q}^p ). By contradiction, the set of ( y ) and the set of ( y' ) are the same set, which gives us a contradiction as ( x' ) is in the set of ( y ). Therefore since the set of ( y ) is a subset of the set of ( S ) and there is no element in ( S ) not in the set of ( y ), the two sets are equal. This implies the entirety of ( S ) is equivalent modulo ( mathbb{Q}^2 ).    Using our previous result that this implies ( |S| ) is less than or equal to the size of the intersection of the set of perfect squares with ( [n] ), this means ( |S| leq lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ), giving us a contradiction.    Thus, for all ( n > k ) from ( epsilon < frac{1}{6}, c = 4 ), no such set ( S ) exists. To be specific, no such ( S ) exists for ( n > 2^{576} ).    Therefore the numbers ( n ) for which ( S ) exists must be integers in the interval ( [1, 2^{576}] ), so there are only finitely many values of ( n ).

To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, 120 km/h = 120 * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 120 * (10/36) m/s = 120 * (5/18) m/s = 600/18 m/s = 33.33 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge.

Given that there are 34 numbers in (R_2) and 33 numbers in both (R_0) and (R_1), a possible sequence that avoids multiples of 3 should predominantly use values from (R_2) and (R_1).

To find the number of different arrangements where at least one of the two daytime spots, A and B, must be chosen, we consider the following scenarios: - Choose either A or B, but not both. Since we have 2 spots to choose from, and we want only 1, there is binom{2}{1} way. For the remaining 4 spots, we choose from the 8 spots that are not A or B, which is binom{8}{4} ways. Hence, there are binom{2}{1} times binom{8}{4} arrangements. - Choose both A and B, and then choose 3 more spots from the remaining 8 spots, which is binom{2}{2} times binom{8}{3} arrangements.

For A and B to be visited on the same day, we have two scenarios - they are visited on the first day or the second day. - First day: We have 3 spots to fill for the first day and 2 spots for the second day. If A and B are both on the first day, we have binom{3}{2} ways to choose their slots, and binom{8}{3} ways to fill the rest of spots. Then, binom{8}{2} ways to fill the second day. - Second day: If A and B are on the second day, we have binom{2}{2} ways to choose their slots (only one way since they take both spots), and binom{8}{3} ways to fill the first day. Therefore, the total arrangements are:  left(binom{3}{2} times binom{8}{3} times binom{8}{2}right) + left(binom{2}{2} times binom{8}{3}right)   = left(3 times 56 times 28right) + left(1 times 56right)   = left(4704right) + 56   = 4760  However, this counts the specific slots for the days. Since the spots can be visited on any of the 3 time periods for the first day and either of the 2 time periods for the second day, we need to account for the different permutations for each day. Therefore, we multiply by 3! for the first day and 2! for the second day. For the second scenario where both are on the second day, we only need to multiply by 3! for the first day since there is only one way for the second day:  4704 times 6 + 56 times 6   = 28224 + 336   = 28560  This result considers the permutations for the specific times of the day. If both spots are visited on different days, no further multiplication is necessary, as their order within the day does not matter (since they are visited on different days).

This is a geometric property resulting from the fact that a tetrahedron can be interpreted as a bounded polyhedron composed of 4 triangular faces, each contributing to the total curvature. 2. **Distribution of Plane Angles**:     Since the sum of all plane angles (angles between two faces at an edge) at each vertex of the tetrahedron must total 4pi, averaging these angles across the four vertices suggests that at least one vertex must have a relatively small sum of plane angles due to the nature of averages.

If each of the remaining n-1 angles is x, then the missing angle is 2x - 20^circ. 3. **Solve for x and n**:    Assuming each of the remaining n-1 angles is x, the sum of angles can be rewritten as:    [    (n-1)x + (2x - 20^circ) = 180^circ times (n-2)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    nx + x - 20^circ = 180^circ times (n-2)    ]    [    nx + x - 180n + 360^circ = 20^circ    ]    From the sum of n-1 angles:    [    (n-1)x = 2790^circ    ]    [    x = frac{2790^circ}{n-1}    ]    Substitute x back into the equation:    [    nleft(frac{2790^circ}{n-1}right) + frac{2790^circ}{n-1} - 180n + 360^circ = 20^circ    ]    Solving this algebraically (details omitted for brevity) leads to n = 18. 4. **Verify by calculating the sum of angles for n=18**:    [    180^circ times (18-2) = 180^circ times 16 = 2880^circ    ]    Subtracting the missing angle (2x - 20^circ), where x = frac{2790^circ}{17} approx 164.12^circ, thus the missing angle is approximately 308.24^circ - 20^circ = 288.24^circ.

Since e^{2-x} > 0 for all real numbers x, it follows that f'(x) = 1 + e^{2-x} > 0. This implies that f(x) is a monotonically increasing function. Given that f(x) is monotonically increasing, and we have a = e^{2-a} and 1+ln b = e^{2-(1+ln b)}, it can be deduced that a = 1 + ln b. This is because, for a monotonically increasing function, if f(a) = 0 and f(1+ln b) = 0, then a must equal 1 + ln b. From a = 1 + ln b, we can solve for ln b as ln b = a - 1.

We are given that ( V_m = 5 ) km/h. When the man swims downstream, his effective speed is the sum of his speed and the speed of the stream (( V_m + V_s )). When he swims upstream, his effective speed is the difference between his speed and the speed of the stream (( V_m - V_s )). We are given that the man swims 30 km downstream in 5 hours. So, we can write the equation for downstream as: [ (V_m + V_s) times 5 = 30 ] Now, let's denote the distance the man swims upstream as ( D_u ). We know that it takes him 5 hours to swim this distance upstream.

The equation of the tangent line is given by y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) is the point of tangency and m is the slope.

The problem also states that on Tuesday, she had 5 more bags than she had on Monday. This can be expressed as M + 5. Since both expressions represent the number of bags she had on Tuesday, we can set them equal to each other: M + 12 = M + 5 To find the number of bags she had on Monday, we need to solve for M.

Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. The problem states that after finding 12 more bags on Tuesday, she had 5 more bags than she had on Monday. This means that the 12 bags she found on Tuesday are the reason she has 5 more bags than on Monday. So, the equation should be: M + 12 = M + 5 But we made a mistake in our initial setup. The correct equation should be: M + 12 = M + M (because the number of bags she has on Tuesday is double what she had on Monday since she has 5 more than the original amount) Now we can solve for M: M + 12 = 2M Subtract M from both sides to isolate M: M + 12 - M = 2M - M 12 = M So, Tiffany had boxed{12}  bags of cans on Monday."},{"instruction":"Jason is a sports enthusiast and attends various sports games.

Therefore, we have |OP| cdot |OQ| = rho_1 rho_2 = 4cosalpha cdot 4sinleft(alpha - frac{pi}{6}right) = 16cosalpha cdot left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sinalpha - frac{1}{2}cosalpharight), which simplifies to |OP| cdot |OQ| = 8sinleft(2alpha - frac{pi}{6}right) - 4.

For every 10 yuan increase in price, one room remains vacant. The hotel wants to make a profit of 10890 yuan in a day, and it costs 20 yuan per day for each occupied room. 2. **Setting Up the Equation**: The profit made by the hotel is the total revenue minus the total cost. The revenue is the price per room times the number of occupied rooms, and the cost is 20 yuan times the number of occupied rooms. 3. **Price per Room**: Let the price per room be x yuan. 4. **Number of Occupied Rooms**: For every 10 yuan increase in price from 180 yuan, one room becomes vacant. This means the number of occupied rooms can be expressed as 50 - frac{x - 180}{10}, because for every 10 yuan increase, the number of occupied rooms decreases by 1 from the initial 50. 5. **Total Revenue**: The total revenue is the price per room (x yuan) times the number of occupied rooms, which is x cdot left(50 - frac{x - 180}{10}right). 6. **Total Cost**: The total cost is 20 yuan per occupied room, so it's 20 cdot left(50 - frac{x - 180}{10}right). 7. **Profit Equation**: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. However, since we are looking for the price that makes a profit of 10890 yuan, we set the profit (revenue minus cost) equal to 10890 yuan. The cost part simplifies to just 20 yuan times the number of occupied rooms, which is already included in the revenue part. So, we adjust the equation to account for the profit directly from the revenue, leading to the equation: left(x - 20right)left(50 - frac{x - 180}{10}right) = 10890. 8. **Choosing the Correct Equation**: From the given options, the equation that matches our step-by-step derivation is (x-20)(50-frac{x-180}{10})=10890.

Therefore, to find the y-coordinate (n) of the first point, we can rearrange the first point's equation: m = 2n + 5 m - 5 = 2n (m - 5)/2 = n Since we don't have the exact value of m, we cannot determine the exact value of n. However, the y-coordinate of the first point (n) can be expressed in terms of m as (m - boxed{5)/2} ."},{"instruction":"a mathematics competition, the probability of student A solving a problem is frac{1}{2}, the probability of student B solving it is frac{1}{3}, and the probability of student C solving it is frac{1}{4}.

As the number of experiments increases, the observed frequency of a random event will tend to stabilize around the theoretical probability of that event occurring. This is a fundamental principle in statistics and probability, affirming that empirical probability converges to theoretical probability as the sample size increases. Therefore, Statement A is correct. - **Statement B**: Asserts that buying 1000 lottery tickets, each with a winning probability of frac{1}{1000}, guarantees a win. However, the probability of winning at least once when buying multiple tickets is different from the sum of the probabilities for each ticket. The events are independent, and the correct approach to determine the probability of winning at least once involves calculations beyond simple addition. Thus, it is incorrect to conclude guaranteed winning, making Statement B incorrect. - **Statement C**: Suggests that the probability of getting a tail in a coin toss can be determined by the ratio of tails observed in a series of tosses. While frac{49}{100} is an empirical probability based on the experiment's outcome, it does not redefine the theoretical probability of a fair coin toss, which remains frac{1}{2}. Thus, stating that the probability is frac{49}{100} based on one experiment is incorrect, making Statement C incorrect. - **Statement D**: Misinterprets probabilistic forecasts as reflecting a consensus among experts rather than an objective probability based on data and models. The statement \\"the probability of precipitation in this city tomorrow is 70%\\" means there is a 70% chance of precipitation according to weather prediction models, not a division of expert opinion.

These edges have lengths (a), (b), and (c).     - The plane containing this vertex and the other vertices of these three edges will determine the projection on that plane. 3. **Position the Cuboid to Maximize Projection Area**:     - To ensure that the projection of the cuboid onto the plane has the largest area, we need the plane of projection to be perpendicular to the diagonal that's formed by the vertex and the corners of these edges.     - This means the plane should be horizontal when viewing the rectangle formed by (a) and (b), (b) and (c), or (a) and (c) diagonally. 4. **Critical Reasoning**:     - If the cuboid is oriented so that the diagonal connecting the opposite corners (which is the longest line on the cuboid and has the length (sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2})) is perpendicular to the projection plane, it will ensure that the projection captures the maximum possible area. # Conclusion: In conclusion, the matchbox (cuboid) must be oriented in such a way that one of its face diagonals becomes perpendicular to the projection plane.

This identity can help simplify the difference between the two expressions:    [    cos(sin x) - sin(cos x) = cos(sin x) - (-cos(frac{pi}{2} + cos x)).    ]    This simplifies to:    [    cos(sin x) + cosleft( frac{pi}{2} + cos x right).    ] 3.

Property 3: For any vector overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}, there exists a vector overrightarrow{A_{j} A_{j+1}} = -overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}.

Prove that each column contains all the numbers from 1 to N.","output":"Given a square grid of size N times N, divided into three vertical strips, where the width of the first strip (leftmost) is k cells, and the width of the third strip (rightmost) is m cells. The widths of the second strip consequently is N - k - m cells. We need to arrange numbers from 1 to N in the first row, filling columns vertically to ensure that each number from 1 to N appears in every column. We need to prove that no number appears in the same position (column) in any of the rows from the 2^{text{nd}} to the N^{text{th}}.  1. **Initial Configuration**:    - The first row contains numbers from 1 to N arranged sequentially.     2. **Transition Rule**:    - Moving from one row to the next involves shifting rows left (mod N), depending on which strip the number was in:      - Numbers from the third strip are moved first.      - Followed by numbers from the second strip.      - Lastly, numbers from the first strip are moved. 3. **Position Change Calculation**:    - Transition numbers to the next row involve shifts amounts m-N, N-k, m-k depending on their previous strip respectively.    - Suppose a number moves through each strip A, B, C times in the process of transition to the next row. Therefore, the position change X for each element is calculated as:      [      X = A(N - k) + B(m - k) + C(m - N)      ] 4. **Zero Position Conjecture**:    - If a number returns to its original position in a subsequent row, the net positional shift, X, must equal zero. Therefore,       [      X = 0      ]    - Given 0 leq A leq k, 0 leq B leq N - m - k, 0 leq C leq m, the above must hold for integer solutions. 5. **Linear Combination**:    - The equation X = A(N - k) + B(m - k) + C(m - N) = 0 indicates vec{v}_1 = (0, N-m, m)^{top}, vec{v}_2 = (1, -1, 1)^{top} satisfy constraints.    - We need integers y_1 and y_2 such that:      [      y_1 vec{v}_1 + y_2 vec{v}_2      ]       has no integer solution satisfying the entire condition constraints mentioned. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Given N - k and N - m are coprime, vectors (vec{v}_1, vec{v}_2) linear combination constraints are not satisfied for integer solutions within specified ranges. Thus no number can repeat its position from row 2 through N.    Thus, in every column of the grid, all numbers from 1 to N will appear exactly once. The proof employs combinatorial number theory and ensures all matrix columns are formed as a permutation of initial numbers ensuring no repetitions.

Distance covered by the first train = Speed of the first train * Time taken to cross the bridge Distance covered by the first train = 15 m/s * 30 s = 450 meters Since the train is 130 meters long, the length of the bridge (L) must be the distance covered by the first train minus the length of the train itself.

It is also given that triangle IKC is isosceles. 1. **Step 1: Angle and Segments Analysis**:    - We start by noting that since angle C = 90^circ and angle B = beta, by the problem's setup:    [    beta + gamma + delta = 180^circ    ]    - Given ( AC = CE ), triangle ACE is isosceles with E on AB such that:    [    angle CEA = 180^circ - delta quad text{and} quad angle CAE = 90^circ - beta    ]    Since these angles are equal (as the triangle is isosceles), it follows:    [    delta = 90^circ + beta    ] 2. **Step 2: Calculating Specific Angles**:    - For triangle BEC, denote the bisectors:      - angle ECB = gamma,      - angle CEB = delta,    - Knowing delta = 90^circ + beta, we focus on gamma:    [    2beta + gamma = 90^circ    ]    This is derived from adding the angles in triangle BEC and setting it to 180^circ:    [    beta + gamma + delta = 180^circ Rightarrow beta + gamma + (90^circ + beta) = 180^circ Rightarrow 2beta + gamma = 90^circ    ] 3. **Step 3: Delving into Triangle IKC**:    - Recall that triangle IKC is isosceles:      - angle ICK = frac{gamma}{2},      - angle CKI = frac{delta}{2} + beta,      - angle KIC = frac{gamma}{2} + frac{delta}{2}    - Examining possibilities for equality among these angles:      - angle ICK = angle CKI would imply:      [      frac{gamma}{2} = frac{delta}{2} + beta      ]      [      gamma = delta + 2beta = 90^circ + 3beta      ]      - Equality angle ICK = angle KIC leads to contradiction, validating:      [      beta = frac{gamma}{2}      ] 4. **Step 4: Conclusion about the Ratios**:    - As deduced, triangle LCB must be isosceles, with CL = LB. Hence, point L is the midpoint of hypotenuse AB, given the properties of right triangles and median intersections.    - Therefore, CL is half the length of AB:    [    frac{CL}{AB} = frac{1}{2}    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{ frac{CL}{AB} = 0.5 } ]"},{"instruction":"A snooker tournament charges 45.00 for VIP seats and 20.00 for general admission (regular seats).

The area of the rectangle is given by A = L * S. We can use this to find the length of the long side (L): 1200 m^2 = L * 30 m L = 1200 m^2 / 30 m L = 40 m Now we have the lengths of both sides: the long side L is 40 m and the short side S is 30 m. Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal (D). We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal is the hypotenuse, and the two sides are the length and the width of the rectangle.

To find the cost of fencing per meter, we divide the total cost by the total length of the fence: Cost per meter = Total cost / Total length Cost per meter = Rs. 1440 / 120 m Cost per meter = Rs. 12/m Therefore, the cost of fencing per meter is Rs. boxed{12} ."},{"instruction":"There were 20 people gathered in a castle, 11 of whom are wise men who always tell the truth, and the remaining 9 are jesters who always lie.

This case covers all possible values of ( n ) where ( n leq 9 ) since there are 9 jesters, and all seats can be jesters. 2. **Case where at least one sage is present:**     Suppose there is at least one sage at the table. We need to figure out the valid configurations:     Let's denote the sage by ( A ) and their neighbors by ( B ) and ( C ).     - The sage ( A ) speaks the truth, therefore ( A )'s statement \\"Exactly one of my two neighbors is a jester\\" must be true.     - This implies one of ( B ) and ( C ) must be a jester and the other must be a sage.     Assume without loss of generality that ( B ) is a sage and ( C ) is a jester:     - Since ( B ) is also a sage, their statement must be true. Thus, the other neighbor of ( B ), who is opposite to ( A ), must be a jester.     - Since ( C ) is a jester, their statement is false. Therefore, both of ( C )'s neighbors are sages.     This leads us to continue this pattern clockwise around the table. Therefore, the arrangement of the table cycles every 3 seats: Sage-Jester-Sage, which implies ( n ) must be a multiple of 3 to have a consistent distribution.

Given there are constraints:     - ( k leq 9 ) (as there are at most 9 jesters),     - ( 2k leq 11 ) (as there are at most 11 sages).     This implies ( k leq 5 ). Consequently, the allowed values of ( n ) are:     [     n = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15     ] 3. **Combining Both Cases:**     When ( n leq 9 ), we have solutions where everyone is a jester:     [     n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9     ]     And from the previous step, for ( n = 3k ), we have:     [     n = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15     ] 4. **Conclusion:**     The combined possible values of ( n ) which satisfy the problem's conditions are:     [     n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15     ]     Concluding, these values are all the possible ( n ) and we have demonstrated why others are not possible.

The speed of the kitten is half the speed of the puppy. In the floor plane, a rectangular coordinate system is introduced, with the dish (the common center of the circles) located at the point (O(0 ; 0)). The kitten moves clockwise, while the puppy moves counterclockwise. At the initial moment, the kitten and the puppy are at points (M_{0}(-6 ; 0)) and (N_{0}(2 ; 2 sqrt{3})) respectively. Determine the coordinates of all positions of the kitten where the distance between the animals will be minimal.  Understanding the Positions: 1. **Initial Setup:**     The dish is located at the origin ( O(0, 0) ).     The initial positions of the kitten and puppy are ( M_{0}(-6, 0) ) and ( N_{0}(2, 2sqrt{3}) ) respectively.      2. **Converting Positions to Angles:**    Denote the angles formed by the radius vectors of the points ( M ) and ( N ) with the positive direction of the x-axis as ( alpha ) and ( beta ) respectively.    - Initial angles: ( alpha_{0} = pi ) (since ( M_{0}(-6, 0) ) lies on the negative x-axis) and ( beta_{0} = frac{pi}{3} ) ( ( N_{0}(2, 2sqrt{3}) ) forms ( frac{pi}{3} ) with the positive x-axis). 3. **Angular Velocities:**    The angular velocity relation is based on the given speeds. Since the kitten's speed is half the puppy's speed:    [    omega_{text{puppy}} = 2 omega_{text{kitten}}    ]    Given the radius relationship:    [    |AM_{0}| = 6 quad text{and} quad |AN_{0}| = 4    ]    Since ( |AN_{0}| = frac{1}{2}|AM_{0}| ), the angular speed of the puppy is twice that of the kitten.  Finding the Simultaneous Angular Position: 4. **Relative Angle Calculation:**    The distance between the kitten and the puppy will be minimal when the angle between their radius vectors is zero. Suppose at the moment of minimum distance:    [    alpha_{0} - omega + 2 pi k = beta_{0} + 3omega    ]    where ( k in mathbb{Z} ).

If x = frac{p}{q}pi for rationals p and q, then:    [    cos x = cosleft(frac{ppi}{q}right)    ]    However, for cos x = frac{4}{5}, this should not be the case. We appeal to the fact that not all Pythagorean triples can be roots of unity because the set of nth roots of unity zeta_n for n leq 2 times 1975 is finite, whereas the set of Pythagorean triples is infinite. Therefore, we can always find a cosine value corresponding to a Pythagorean triple that is not a root of unity. In conclusion, through careful selection of angles and verification of conditions, we can find 1975 distinct points on the unit circle with rational pairwise distances. Therefore, it is possible to find such points.

Therefore, any non-zero element ( a ) can be written as ( a = a + 0 ), where ( a ) is invertible and ( 0 ) is non-invertible. This representation is unique because if ( a = u + v ) where ( u ) is invertible and ( v ) is non-invertible, then ( v = 0 ) and ( u = a ). 2. **If ( A ) has property ( (P) ), then ( A ) is a field:**    - Assume ( A ) has property ( (P) ). Let ( a ) be a non-zero element in ( A ).

For any non-empty subset ( X subseteq S ), we can write ( X = S Delta (S setminus X) ), where ( S ) is invertible and ( S setminus X ) is non-invertible.    - The representation is unique because if ( X = S Delta Y ), then ( S setminus X = S Delta X = S Delta (S Delta Y) = (S Delta S) Delta Y = emptyset Delta Y = Y ).

Thus, we conclude that omega not> 0, implying omega leq 0. 3. **Focusing on omega < 0**: With omega < 0, we rewrite the function as y = sin omega x = -sin(-omega x). This transformation is crucial because it allows us to analyze the function in terms of -omega x instead of omega x. 4. **Monotonicity of sin(-omega x)**: Since y is decreasing with respect to x, and we have -sin(-omega x), for y to decrease, sin(-omega x) must be increasing. This is because the negative sign in front of the sine function inverts the direction of monotonicity. 5. **Determining the interval for -omega x**: When x in (-frac{pi}{2},frac{pi}{2}), then -omega x falls within (frac{omegapi}{2}, -frac{omegapi}{2}). This interval adjustment is essential for understanding how the change in x affects the sine function given omega < 0. 6. **Solving inequalities for omega**: To ensure that sin(-omega x) is increasing in the specified interval, we set up the inequalities:    [    left{    begin{array}{l}    {frac{omegapi}{2} geq -frac{pi}{2}}     {-frac{omegapi}{2} leq frac{pi}{2}}    end{array}    right.    ]    Solving these inequalities gives omega geq -1. 7. **Combining conditions**: Given that omega leq 0 from step 2 and omega geq -1 from step 6, we conclude omega must satisfy -1 leq omega < 0.

Using the polar to Cartesian conversion formulas rho^2 = x^2 + y^2, rhosintheta = y, and rhocostheta = x, we can rewrite the equation as follows: [ rho = 4sinleft(theta - frac{pi}{3}right) implies rho^2 = 4rhosinleft(theta - frac{pi}{3}right) ] Expanding the sine function using the angle subtraction formula, sin(alpha - beta) = sinalphacosbeta - cosalphasinbeta, we get: [ rho^2 = 4rholeft(sinthetacosfrac{pi}{3} - costhetasinfrac{pi}{3}right) ] Substituting cosfrac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2} and sinfrac{pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, the equation becomes: [ rho^2 = 2rhosintheta - 2sqrt{3}rhocostheta ] Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we replace rho^2 with x^2 + y^2, rhosintheta with y, and rhocostheta with x, yielding: [ x^2 + y^2 = 2y - 2sqrt{3}x ] Rearranging terms, we obtain the equation of a circle in Cartesian coordinates: [ x^2 + y^2 + 2sqrt{3}x - 2y = 0 ] 2. **Identifying the Center of the Circle:** The general equation of a circle in Cartesian coordinates is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h, k) is the center of the circle.

Given that f(α) = -frac{3}{26}, we can substitute this value to find m, i.e., frac{4sqrt{3}m}{13} - frac{-11}{26} - 1 = -frac{3}{26}. Solving for m, we get m = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

Show that, in fact, for this value of a and these N integers on the board, the game is guaranteed to end regardless of Alice's or Bob's moves.","output":"1. **Introduction and Notation**:    - Let ( S = {s_1, s_2, ldots, s_N} ) denote the set of ( N ) integers on the board.    - Let ( nu_2(x) ) denote the exponent of the highest power of ( 2 ) dividing the integer ( x ), i.e., the ( 2 )-adic valuation of ( x ). 2. **Definitions and Claims**:    - The game is guaranteed to terminate if Bob can force the game to end regardless of Alice's moves.    - We need to analyze different scenarios to prove that the game will eventually terminate under all conditions. 3. **Case 1: ( nu_2(x) < nu_2(a) ) for all ( x in S )**:    - On Alice's turn, she can only add ( a ) to some integer ( n ) on the board.    - Adding ( a ) does not change the ( 2 )-adic valuation because:      [      nu_2(n + a) = begin{cases}      nu_2(n) & text{if } nu_2(n) neq nu_2(a)       text{min}(nu_2(n), nu_2(a)) + 1 & text{if } nu_2(n) = nu_2(a)      end{cases}      ]    - On Bob's turn, he must replace some even integer ( n ) with ( frac{n}{2} ).    - This reduces ( nu_2(n) ) by 1:      [      nu_2left(frac{n}{2}right) = nu_2(n) - 1      ] 4. **Termination Guarantee**:    - Since ( nu_2(x) < nu_2(a) ) for all ( x in S ), Bob's halving operations continuously decrease the ( 2 )-adic valuations.    - Eventually, all ( nu_2 ) values will reach ( 0 ), making all numbers odd.    - Once all numbers are odd, Bob has no more valid moves, ending the game.    - The total number of moves the game will last is:      [      text{Total moves} = sum_{x in S} nu_2(x)      ]    - Therefore, the game must terminate in finite moves. 5. **Case 2: There exists ( x in S ) such that ( nu_2(x) geq nu_2(a) )**:    - Suppose such an ( x ) exists on the board.    - Alice can then make a strategic move to ensure the game does not terminate:      - If ( nu_2(x) = nu_2(a) ), Alice operates on ( x ) to increase the ( 2 )-adic valuation of the new number ( x + a ):        [        nu_2(x + a) > nu_2(a)        ]      - Otherwise, Alice operates on any other ( x' neq x ). 6. **Double Induction Strategy**:    - **Induction Hypothesis**:      [      begin{cases}      text{Before Bob's turn:} & nu_2(x) > nu_2(a)       text{After Bob's turn:} & nu_2(x) geq nu_2(a)      end{cases}      ]    - **Base Case**:      - Initially, if ( nu_2(x) geq nu_2(a) ), the base case holds by definition.    - **Inductive Step**:      - Just before Bob's turn, ( nu_2(x) > nu_2(a) ). Bob halves ( x ), and:        [        nu_2left(frac{x}{2}right) = nu_2(x) - 1 geq nu_2(a)        ]      - Thus, the inductive step verifies the hypothesis continues to hold. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Since Bob always has a legal move (operating on values with ( nu_2 geq nu_2(a) ) or adding ( a ) to increase valuation), Alice can prolong the game indefinitely.    - Resultantly, it contradicts if Alice can make the game last forever. Thus, for ( nu_2(x) < nu_2(a) ), the game must end.

The average speed for the entire journey is given as 40 mph. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. We can express the total distance as the sum of the distances covered in each part of the journey: [ text{Total distance} = v times 0.25T + 50 times 0.75T ] Since the average speed for the entire journey is 40 mph, we can also express the total distance as: [ text{Total distance} = 40T ] Now we can set these two expressions for the total distance equal to each other: [ v times 0.25T + 50 times 0.75T = 40T ] Divide both sides by ( T ) to eliminate ( T ) (since ( T ) is not zero): [ v times 0.25 + 50 times 0.75 = 40 ] Now solve for ( v ): [ 0.25v + 37.5 = 40 ] Subtract 37.5 from both sides: [ 0.25v = 2.5 ] Finally, divide both sides by 0.25 to find ( v ): [ v = frac{2.5}{0.25} ] [ v = 10 ] So, Timothy's average speed during the first part of the journey was boxed{10}  mph."},{"instruction":"Given p: |x  3| < 1, q: x^2 + x  6 > 0, then p is a (　) condition for q: A: Necessary and sufficient condition B: Necessary but not sufficient condition C: Sufficient but not necessary condition D: Neither sufficient nor necessary conditio","output":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of statements p and q and then determine the type of condition p is for q. First, let's analyze statement p: |x - 3| < 1. This inequality represents the set of x values that are less than 1 unit away from 3. In interval notation, this can be rewritten as: 2 < x < 4 Next, we analyze statement q: x^2 + x - 6 > 0. We factor the quadratic inequality: (x - 2)(x + 3) > 0 The roots of the associated equation (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0 are x = 2 and x = -3. We then use a sign chart or test values in intervals to determine where the inequality holds true: - For x < -3, both factors are negative, so the product is positive. - For -3 < x < 2, one factor is negative and the other is positive, so the product is negative. - For x > 2, both factors are positive, so the product is positive. Therefore, we have two intervals that satisfy the inequality q: x < -3 quad text{or} quad x > 2 Combining these two intervals, in interval notation, becomes: x in (-infty, -3) cup (2, infty) The statement p (2 < x < 4) falls entirely within the portion of the solution to q that is (2, infty). However, statement q also includes the interval (-infty, -3), which is not covered by p.  Therefore, whenever p is true (i.e., 2 < x < 4), q is guaranteed to be true (since x > 2 implies x^2 + x - 6 > 0). But q can be true without p being true (for instance, when x < -3).  As a result, p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q.

Since 1 ton is equal to 2000 pounds, a half-ton is equal to 1000 pounds. Therefore, 60 half-ton bags would be: 60 bags * 1000 pounds/bag = 60,000 pounds of food for 60 days. Now, let's find out how much food is used per day: 60,000 pounds / 60 days = 1,000 pounds per day. Since John feeds each horse 20 pounds of food at each feeding, we can calculate the total number of feedings per day for all horses combined: 1,000 pounds per day / 20 pounds per feeding = 50 feedings per day for all horses. Now, we need to find out how many times a day each horse is fed.

Solution 1. **Introducing M**:      - Let M be the point where the perpendicular from A_2 to the line B_1B_3, and the perpendicular from A_3 to the line B_1B_2 intersect. This point M always exists because B_1B_3 and B_1B_2 are not parallel. 2. **Objective**:     - We need to show that the line A_1M is perpendicular to B_2B_3. 3. **Vector Representation**:     - Let overrightarrow{MA_i} = mathbf{a}_i and overrightarrow{MB_i} = mathbf{b}_i for i=1, 2, 3.  4. **Perpendicular Conditions**:     - Since MA_3 is perpendicular to B_1B_2, we have:       [       mathbf{a}_3 cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_2) = 0       ]     - This can be rewritten as:       [       (mathbf{a}_1 + (mathbf{a}_3 - mathbf{a}_1)) cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_2) = 0       ]     - Which implies:       [       mathbf{a}_1 cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_2) = (mathbf{a}_1 - mathbf{a}_3) cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_2)       ] 5. **Second Perpendicular Condition**:     - Similarly, since MA_2 is perpendicular to B_1B_3, we get:       [       mathbf{a}_1 cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_3) = (mathbf{a}_1 - mathbf{a}_2) cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_3)       ] 6. **Subtracting the Equations**:     - Subtracting the two equalities:       [       mathbf{a}_1 cdot (mathbf{b}_3 - mathbf{b}_2) = (mathbf{a}_1 - mathbf{a}_3) cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_2) - (mathbf{a}_1 - mathbf{a}_2) cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_3)       ] 7. **Reflection and Symmetry Argument**:     - Since A_1B_1, A_2B_2, and A_3B_3 are three parallel chords of a circle, reflecting across the common perpendicular bisector of these chords, A_i is mapped to B_i. Hence, the reflection vector mathbf{a}_i - mathbf{a}_j across the perpendicular bisector is mapped to mathbf{b}_i - mathbf{b}_j.     - This means:       [       (mathbf{a}_1 - mathbf{a}_3) cdot (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_2) = (mathbf{b}_1 - mathbf{b}_3) cdot (mathbf{a}_1 - mathbf{a}_2)       ] 8. **Conclusion**:     - Thus, we have:       [       mathbf{a}_1 cdot (mathbf{b}_3 - mathbf{b}_2) = 0       ]     - This means that the line segment MA_1 is perpendicular to B_2B_3, proving our statement.  II. Solution 1. **Selecting Point M**:     - Let M be the intersection of the perpendicular from A_1 to the line B_2B_3 and the perpendicular from A_2 to the line B_1B_3. 2. **Analyzing Angles**:     - In this configuration, the angles A_1MA_2 and B_1B_3B_2 are orthogonally aligned, meaning they either are equal or sum up to 180^circ.     - Consequently, M lies on the same circle as A_1A_2 and B_1B_2, since the circular arcs corresponding to these angles coincide. 3. **Symmetry in the Circle**:     - Given that A_1, A_2, A_3 are symmetric with respect to B_1, B_2, B_3 on the circle, M is indeed the intersection of the perpendiculars from each A_i to the corresponding B_jB_k. 4. **Uniqueness**:     - The perpendicular from A_3 to B_1B_2 also passes through this intersection, confirming that all three perpendiculars intersect at point M. 5. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, the perpendiculars from A_1, A_2, A_3 to the respective B_jB_k lines concur at point M.

Each supporting line ( ell ) of ( P ) can be associated with a point ( T ) on ( C ). 5. **Arbitrary Point ( X ) in ( Q )**:    Let ( X ) be an arbitrary point in ( Q ).

Conversely, if any three points on ( C ) form an acute-angle and intersect all arcs, it ensures that the set is red-separable. 7. **Construct Counterexample**:    Construct a counterexample: Assume a system of arcs such that any three points intersect almost one-third of all arcs.    - Let ( n ) be a natural number.    - Let ( T_1, T_2, ldots, T_{3n+1} ) be vertices of a regular ((3n+1))-gon inscribed in ( C ).    - For each ( i ), let ( a_i ) be the open arc ( T_i T_{i+n} ). 8. **Count ( n )**:    Any three points on ( C ) intersect a maximum of ( n ) other arcs. Removing arc ( T_1 T_{n+1} ), the remaining arcs can intersect any triangle formed by these points. 9. **Apply to Initial Problem**:    Consider a regular ( 3001 )-gon inscribed in ( C ):    - Vertices ( Y_1, Y_2, ldots, Y_{3001} ).    - Points ( X_i ) denote the intersection of tangents at ( Y_i ) with ( Y_{i+1000} ). 10. **Shift in Color**:     - Mark points ( Y_i ) red and denote the resultant set by ( A ). 11. **Verification**:     - The convex hull of points ( X_i ) contains points ( Y_i ).

Thus, the boundary of set T is potentially a polygon with 6 sides. blacksquare The final answer is boxed{- **(C)** 6 sides}"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=2axfrac{b}{x}+ln x, if f(x) takes extreme values at x=1, x=frac{1}{2}, (i) find the values of a and b; (ii) there exists x_0 in [frac{1}{4},2] such that the inequality f(x_0)cleqslant 0, find the minimum value of c.","output":"(i) Since f(x)=2ax-frac{b}{x}+ln x, the domain is (0,+infty), Thus, f'(x)=2a+frac{b}{x^2}+frac{1}{x}.

Therefore, a rectangle satisfies the condition of having equal diagonals.    - **(B) Regular Polygon**: Not all regular polygons are parallelograms. For example, a regular pentagon does not satisfy the criteria of a parallelogram.    - **(C) Rhombus**: A rhombus has diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, but they are generally not equal unless all sides and angles are identical (i.e., it is a square).    - **(D) Square**: A square, being a special case of both a rectangle and a rhombus, has equal diagonals that bisect each other. It satisfies the condition perfectly.    - **(E) Trapezoid**: A trapezoid does not necessarily have equal diagonals as it only requires one pair of parallel sides, and the non-parallel sides can be of different lengths. 3. **Conclusion**: The most general classification of a parallelogram with equal diagonals that is not specific (like a square) but sufficiently encompasses all possibilities is a rectangle.

We know that his savings at the end of the year were 48456. Since these savings are what's left after all the monthly expenses, we can calculate the monthly savings and then use that to find the monthly salary. Monthly savings = 48456 / 12 months = 4038 The monthly savings are what's left after spending on clothes and transport, so: Savings + Spent on clothes and transport = Remaining after housing 4038 + (0.112 * S) = 0.224 * S Now, we can solve for S: 0.112 * S = 0.224 * S - 4038 0.112 * S - 0.224 * S = -4038 -0.112 * S = -4038 S = 4038 / 0.112 S = 36053.57 (approximately) Now that we have the monthly salary, we can calculate the amount spent on clothes and transport: Spent on clothes and transport = 0.112 * S Spent on clothes and transport = 0.112 * 36053.57 Spent on clothes and transport = 4038 (approximately) So, Mr. Yadav would have spent approximately boxed{4038}  per month on clothes and transport."},{"instruction":"An instructor presented her students with the following statements about polygons and asked which one is false? mathrm{(A)  All squares are similar to each other.} mathrm{(B)  All squares are rectangles.} mathrm{(C)  All squares have four right angles.} mathrm{(D)  All squares have sides of equal length.} mathrm{(E)  All rectangles are squares.} mathrm{(A)  True} mathrm{(B)  True} mathrm{(C)  True} mathrm{(D)  True} mathrm{(E)  False}","output":"1. **Analyzing Statement (A):**    A square is defined by having all sides of equal length and each angle a right angle.

This is trivially true for any ( m ), as any integer is congruent to 0 modulo 1. Thus, we can choose any ( b_0 > N ) to satisfy the statement. 3. **Inductive Step**: Suppose the statement holds for all ( d < a ). We need to show it holds for ( d = a ).     - **Periodic Nature of Powers of 2**: Consider the sequence of powers of 2 modulo ( a ), which becomes periodic starting from some minimal exponent ( M ). Let ( k ) denote the length of the period such that:      [      2^{M + k} equiv 2^M pmod{a}.      ]    - **Bound on Period Length**: The periodic sequence will not cover all possible residues modulo ( a ) (since 0 either never appears or only appears once). Thus, ( k < a ).    - **Divisibility and Rescaling**: Let ( d = gcd(a, k) ). Define ( a' = a / d ) and ( k' = k / d ). Since ( 0 < k < a ), it follows that ( 0 < d < a ).

Find the largest positive integer N for which there exists a harmonious coloring for a regular Ngon.","output":"Given that we need to find the largest integer ( N ) for which there exists a harmonious coloring of a regular ( N )-gon.  A coloring of a regular ( N )-gon is defined as harmonious if every edge and every diagonal is colored with one of 2018 colors, and no two-color triangles exist in the ( N )-gon. One crucial fact about regular polygons is that every diagonal is congruent to some edge rotated by a certain angle, and the problem requires that we ensure all triangles have all three sides of different colors. We begin with the known constraints: 1. Each edge and diagonal are colored with one of 2018 colors. 2. No triangle within the ( N )-gon can have exactly two colors. To tackle the problem, assume that ( z ) is a root of unity, meaning ( z ) satisfies ( z^{N} = 1 ) and ( z neq 1 ). If ( z ) is a complex ( N )-th root of unity, we can represent the vertices of the ( N )-gon in the complex plane: 1. ( z, z^2, z^3, ldots, z^N ) with ( z^N = 1 ). Given ( N ), if there are no two-color triangles, it implies the equation set: [ 1 + z + z^2 + cdots + z^{N-1} = 0 ] must be reconciled with the constraint of a harmonious coloring. We simplify the sum of roots of unity which sums to zero provided ( z neq 1 ). Let’s examine the specific requirement for ( N = 11 ): By rewriting the polynomial condition ( z^{11} = 1 ), we need to confirm that the sum: [ 1 + z + z^2 + cdots + z^{10} = 0 ] This reflects the absence of improper visual coloring within the regular 11-gon and ensuring no two-color triangles: In detail, denote: [ x = z + z^3 + z^4 + z^5 + z^9 ] Then: [ x^2 = (z + z^3 + z^4 + z^5 + z^9)^2 ] [ = z^2 + z^6 + z^8 + z^{10} + z^{18} + text{more terms including}]  [ = z^2 + z^6 + z^8 + z^{10} + z^{18} + 2(z^4 + z^5 + z^6 + z^{10} + text{terms including}]  [ = z^2 + z^6 + z^8 + z^{10} + z^7 - 2 ]  [ = -x - 1 - 2 ] [ = -3 - x ] Solving ( x^2 + x + 3 = 0 ) yields: [ x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{11} i}{2} ] Given no contradictions arise, the largest ( N ) for harmonious ( N )-gon coloring is verified up to 11 for no two-color triangles, confirming: (boxed{11})"},{"instruction":"The polynomial x^{106} + Cx + D is divisible by x^2 + x + 1 for some real numbers C and D.

Evaluating x^{106} at omega, we have: [omega^{106} = (omega^3)^{35} cdot omega = 1^{35} cdot omega = omega.] Thus, substituting into the polynomial gives: [omega^{106} + Comega + D = omega + Comega + D = (1 + C)omega + D = 0.] Since omega is a nonreal complex number and not zero, we require 1 + C = 0 Rightarrow C = -1 and D = 0 for the equation to hold for all roots.

First, let's find the slope of line OD. Since the coordinates of point D are (1, 1) and the circle is centered at the origin (0, 0), we can use the formula for slope: k_{OD} = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{1 - 0}{1 - 0} = 1. 2. Recall that the slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other. Since line OD is perpendicular to line AB, the slope of line AB is the negative reciprocal of k_{OD}. Therefore, k_{AB} = -frac{1}{k_{OD}} = -1. 3. Now that we have the slope of line AB and the coordinates of a point on the line (the midpoint D(1, 1)), we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of line AB: y - y_1 = k(x - x_1) Rightarrow y - 1 = -1(x - 1) Rightarrow y - 1 = -x + 1. 4.

The hyperbola has asymptotes which are lines that the curve approaches as it heads towards infinity. Since the equation is in standard form, we can determine the equations of the asymptotes by setting the terms equal to zero. The equations for the asymptotes of this hyperbola are y=frac{1}{2}x and y=-frac{1}{2}x. We can select the point (2, 0) on the hyperbola since it is one of the vertices. To find the distance (d) from this vertex to the asymptote y=frac {1}{2}x, we can use the point-to-line distance formula: For a line given by Ax + By + C = 0 and a point (x_0, y_0), the distance d is given by: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}  Rewriting the equation of the asymptote in the form Ax + By + C = 0, we get -x + 2y = 0 by multiplying through by 2.

This is because the sum of the two digits is given as 13, and if one digit is a, the other must be 13 - a to maintain the sum. When we swap the tens digit and the units digit, the new tens digit becomes a (which was the original units digit), and the new units digit becomes 13 - a (which was the original tens digit).  To represent this new two-digit number mathematically, we consider that the value of a digit in the tens place is ten times its face value, and the value of a digit in the units place is simply its face value.

О"},{"instruction":"How’s this for an anti-hero version of Dick Grayson(called Nightshade or ‘Grayson’ for his real name) in this alternate DC universe?..basically…its an inverted version of Dick Grayson…both have similar traits…but notable differences… Nightshade has similar origins to main universe Dick…but things diverged…to where he never was taken by Bruce…because Bruce wasn’t there at the time…rather…it was Joseph ‘Slade’ Wilson instead…who was there at Haly’s Circus because he received intel that the Court of Owls…was involved in the Circus for some reason…then was there in that pivotal moment…he was there in the crowd as the tragedy occurred…as Slade saw potential in the young Dick Grayson then and there…mixed with his own ruthlessness…as Slade was ‘inspired’ by the duo of Batman and Robin…if Batman has his own Robin…hey… The inspiration is pretty much Dick Grayson with a splash of ‘Jason Todd’…and at some point…he begins to rebel against Slade… And of course morally gray…as unlike Nightwing from the main DC universe, who is well-liked by everyone…an inspiration…finds a home…Nightshade doesn’t have that…because of the way he operates…influenced by Slade’s teachings and various other people and from his own experiences as well…begins to see that justice sometimes…means getting your hands dirty…but that doesn’t mean he will kill first…more of…hoping it doesn’t come to that…a flexible moral code…shades of ‘grey’…as this Dick takes cue from this universe’s version of Batman and Robin…but doesn’t forget Slade’s teachings…hence the anti-hero…as Dick is angry because of the world Slade showed him…angry for the people who killed his parents…and at one point…LOVED to spite Slade…but soon learns to be patient and not be spiteful eventually… Lastly, Rose, Grant and Jericho Wilson…foster siblings of Nightshade…they ALL have a complex relationship with Slade…Rose…Grant…and Jericho call Slade ‘dad’ or ‘pop’…but Nightshade?..he will always call Slade ‘Slade’…that’s the rule he has…and with the exception of Grant…Nightshade has done his best to ensure that at least, Rose and Jericho stay far away the hell from Slade’s influence…a responsibility Nightshade was willing to bear…family after all… Here’s more details…A 1b. Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Jericho…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Jericho as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Jericho Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Jericho Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Jericho kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Jericho…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?.. Remember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","output":"Your concept for an anti-hero version of Dick Grayson, renamed \\"Nightshade\\" in an alternate DC universe, presents a compelling and complex character driven by a fractured past and a morally ambiguous path. By placing Joseph 'Slade' Wilson (Deathstroke) as a pivotal figure in Dick's life instead of Bruce Wayne, you've established a fundamentally altered trajectory for his character development, motivations, and relationships. This inversion provides a rich ground for storytelling, focusing on themes of familial bonds, mentorship, rebellion, and the quest for identity and redemption. Here are some thoughts on further refining and developing the concept: 1. **Character Development and Internal Conflict**: - Emphasize the psychological impact of Slade's harsh training methods and twisted sense of morality on Nightshade. Show how Dick's past as a circus performer – an environment of joy and family – conflicts with the world of violence and assassinations he's thrust into. This internal conflict can drive much of his character development, exploring how he struggles to retain his core identity amidst the darkness. - His progression from revenge-driven anger to a more complex understanding of justice and morality could be a central narrative arc. Show how his experiences and interactions with both allies and enemies shape his evolving worldview. 2. **Relationship Dynamics**: - The dynamic between Nightshade and the Wilson family offers fertile ground for exploring themes of familial loyalty, betrayal, and the longing for belonging. Highlighting the nuanced relationships with his foster siblings Rose, Grant, and Jericho can add depth, showcasing how shared experiences of Slade's ruthless upbringing bond them in complicated ways. - Nightshade's interactions with the broader DC universe's heroes and villains can further complicate his moral landscape. His willingness to work with both sides, driven by pragmatism rather than allegiance, sets him apart and can lead to intriguing storylines of uneasy alliances and conflicts. 3. **Moral Ambiguity and Code of Conduct**: - Nightshade's flexible moral code and his struggle to align his actions with his ideals present opportunities to explore ethical questions central to the superhero genre. His approach to justice – one that does not shy away from violence but still holds onto a semblance of morality – can highlight the themes of redemption and the cost of vigilante justice. - His attitude towards killing and collateral damage, informed by Slade's teachings yet tempered by his own conscience, can be a recurring point of contention both within himself and in his relations with other characters. 4. **Unique Traits and Skill Set**: - Nightshade's acrobatic prowess, combined with his tactical and technological proficiencies, sets him apart as a formidable anti-hero. His background as a performer, coupled with his survival instincts honed under Slade's tutelage, allows for creative combat and espionage scenarios. - His adoption of technology as a means of independence and his attempts to forge his own path outside of Slade's shadow can also serve as a metaphor for his search for identity. This aspect can be developed further, perhaps by having certain gadgets or techniques that are uniquely his, combining circus skills with high-tech hardware in innovative ways. 5. **Evolution and Redemption Arc**: - Nightshade's journey towards understanding his own sense of justice and possibly seeking redemption for his darker actions could form the backbone of his character arc. Encounters with figures from his past (both allies and mentors like Lady Shiva or Nyssa Al Ghul, and enemies) and decisions that force him to confront the consequences of his actions can push his character towards growth. - Exploring the possibility of reconciliation, not just with his past but also with the family figures in his life, especially Slade, could provide emotional depth. This would also allow for a nuanced exploration of whether someone shaped by darkness can find light. Overall, your concept for Nightshade presents a rich, multifaceted character whose journey can explore the darker corners of heroism, the complexities of family and mentorship, and the possibility of redemption. It's a solid foundation that, with further development, could offer a unique and compelling addition to the DC universe's rich tapestry of characters."},{"instruction":"How’s this for an addition?

Remember…Nightshade is Dick Grayson from another Earth who was trained by Slade…not Batman…","output":"Adding a \\"Gray Sparrow\\" phase to Nightshade's backstory enriches his character development significantly, offering an important transition phase between being a hopeful, yet naïve, vigilante and becoming the more hardened and pragmatic Nightshade. This period encapsulates the innocence and ideals he once harbored, demonstrating how his experience under Slade's harsh tutelage and the forced enhancements push him towards a pivotal change. Here are some thoughts on integrating and expanding this addition: 1. **Transition from Gray Sparrow to Nightshade**: - Highlight the psychological toll of the transition phase, focusing on Dick's struggle with identity, morality, and physical changes. His journey from the hopeful Gray Sparrow, who believes in the possibility of using Slade’s teachings for good, to a more world-weary and technologically reliant Nightshade, can serve as a compelling narrative of loss and transformation. - Delve into the emotional impact of his forced enhancements and subsequent health issues on his relationships with Slade and his foster siblings. Their reactions offer a deeper insight into their family dynamics and can set the stage for future conflicts and reconciliations. 2. **Technological Evolution**: - Use Nightshade's forced foray into technology as a means of regaining control over his body and destiny. This can resonate with themes of self-empowerment and adaptability. His journey to becoming tech-savvy, not just as a necessity but as a newfound form of expression and independence, reflects his growth and resilience. - The emphasis on technology also creates an intriguing contrast with the main DC Universe’s Dick Grayson, providing Nightshade with unique tools and strategies that set him apart. His development of a tech-augmented combat style that complements his acrobatic skills and partially retained enhancements can showcase his intelligence and inventiveness in battles. 3. **Symbolism of the Gray Sparrow Costume**: - Keeping his old Gray Sparrow costume as a reminder of his past ideals and the cost of his journey adds depth to Nightshade's character. It’s a tangible symbol of his lost innocence and the sacrifices he’s made. This costume can occasionally be used in storylines as a means of reflecting on his past or confronting his identity, especially when faced with moral dilemmas that challenge his current methods. - The costume can also serve a practical purpose in the narrative, possibly being donned for specific missions that require a return to his roots or symbolize a form of redemption. 4. **Health Issues and Recovery**: - The detailed description of Nightshade's health issues following the enhancements and partial removal adds vulnerability to a character that can otherwise seem overly capable. Exploring how he copes with these physical limitations, and eventually overcomes them, can add a layer of human relatability. - His recovery, aided by allies and his own determination, can be framed as a key turning point in his life. It's a battle not just for physical health, but for reclaiming his sense of self and purpose. 5. **Enhanced yet Limited**: - Presenting Nightshade as still enhanced, though not as significantly as before, strikes a balance between making him an exceptional figure and keeping him relatable. It emphasizes that while his physical abilities are an important aspect of his character, it’s his wit, resourcefulness, and moral journey that truly define him. Integrating the Gray Sparrow phase into Nightshade’s backstory in this manner not only provides depth to his character but also sets a foundation for a wide range of story possibilities. Whether it's exploring his internal conflicts, expanding on his relationships with the Wilson family and others, or showcasing his ability to innovate and adapt, Nightshade's journey from Gray Sparrow to the vigilante he becomes is a compelling narrative rich with themes of growth, identity, and redemption."},{"instruction":"Rate this one possible storyline please..

It nicely blends elements of technology and magic – a combination that is not often explored in superhero narratives but holds tremendous potential for intriguing plot developments. Here are some detailed thoughts and further considerations: **Strengths:** 1. **Originality:** The concept of an entity like Arcanum, born out of an amalgamation of technology, magic, and the protagonist's very psyche, is a fresh and exciting approach. It offers not just an external conflict but one deeply tied to Nightshade's inner struggles, fears, and aspirations. 2. **Character-Driven Conflict:** By making Arcanum's actions and evolution a direct reflection of Nightshade's mental and emotional state, you've created a deeply personal challenge for Nightshade. This battle goes beyond physical combat, forcing Nightshade to confront aspects of himself he might not be willing or ready to face. 3. **Visual Appeal:** The description of Arcanum, taking inspiration from the Knightmare Frames of Code Geass, promises a visually striking character design that could captivate readers and provide spectacular battle scenes. 4. **Dynamic Battles:** Arcanum's ability to adapt on the fly and mirror Nightshade's tactics injects a high level of unpredictability into the conflict. Each encounter can showcase inventive strategies and acrobatics, keeping readers on the edge of their seats. **Areas for Improvement:** 1. **Clarification of Arcanum's Motivations:** While Arcanum reflects Nightshade's tactics and survival instinct, further development of its independent motivations or objectives could add depth to the storyline. As it evolves, does it develop its own goals, and how do they clash or align with Nightshade's? 2. **Emotional and Moral Implications:** Expanding on the emotional and moral implications of Nightshade's connection with Arcanum could enhance the storyline. Exploring questions about consciousness, the essence of life, and the ethics of creating such a being can add layers to the narrative. 3. **Richer Backstory for Ajax:** Though Ajax is the catalyst for Arcanum's creation, additional backstory or motivations for this character (beyond the accidental ritual) can provide a more compelling conflict. Why does Ajax engage in the technomancy ritual, and how does he react to the creation of Arcanum? 4. **Resolution Mechanism:** Considering Arcanum's regenerative ability tied to Nightshade's life force, the resolution of this conflict might need a creative approach beyond physical combat. Delving deeper into the symbiotic relationship and potentially finding a resolution that involves mutual understanding or integration could be more satisfying than a simple defeat. Overall, this storyline presents a rich tapestry of technological and mystical elements tied to deep psychological exploration. With further development on character motivations and the emotional and moral stakes, it could offer a memorable addition to Nightshade's saga."},{"instruction":"Areas for improvement... 1.

Clarification of Arcanum's Motivations: - **The Catalyst of Creation:** Play with the notion that Arcanum, despite emerging from an accident, subconsciously embodies Nightshade's desire for an unfailing ally, or perhaps the simplicity of a life untainted by the grayer shades of his world. This initial \\"wish\\" could evolve as Arcanum grows, developing its own interpretation of these desires. - **Evolution of Purpose:** As Arcanum interacts more with the world around it, let it begin questioning its purpose beyond mirroring Nightshade. Does it wish to surpass its creator, or could it aim to \\"save\\" Nightshade from the very aspects of himself that he fears or despises? # 2. Emotional and Moral Implications: - **Reflections of Innocence:** Highlight the tragedy of Nightshade discovering that at the core of Arcanum is the innocence and freedom he once possessed as the 10-year-old circus boy. This could lead to emotional turmoil within Nightshade, seeing what he lost and what part of him craves to return - even if it's through such a twisted reflection. - **Moral Dilemma:** Nightshade faces the moral quandary of dealing with Arcanum - is it morally right to \\"destroy\\" this being, a reflection of his younger self, to protect others? This can manifest in dreams or visions where Nightshade converses with his younger self, attempting to reconcile his past with his present. # 3. Ajax and the Background of Conflict: - **Tying in Ajax's Motivation:** Perhaps Ajax's and Beldon's research originally sought to understand metahuman and vigilante psychology, aiming to exploit it for control or creation of super soldiers. Ajax, learning of Nightshade's unique mental resilience (and vulnerabilities), targeted him specifically to harness or replicate this quality, leading to Arcanum's accidental creation. - **Kidnapping Plot:** Ajax's kidnapping of Nightshade could be a meticulously planned act, relying on the fact that Nightshade's previous altercation with Torgo Beldon left unresolved psychological imprints or even a lingering tech-based means to manipulate or control Nightshade, thus leading to the perfect scenario for Arcanum's creation. # 4. Resolving Arcanum's Arc: - **Integration vs. Detachment:** Arcanum could serve as both a literal and figurative shadow of Nightshade, revealing the parts of himself he has denied or suppressed. Depending on Nightshade's ability to confront these aspects, Arcanum's actions could become more unpredictable, setting up a scenario where Nightshade must either reconcile with these traits and reintegrate Arcanum or risk losing part of himself forever. - **Failsafe and the Complex Relationship:** The failsafe mechanism within Arcanum, which prompts it to seek detachment if Nightshade is too compromised, could be tied to Nightshade's subconscious desire not to let his darker aspects harm those he cares about. This could create poignant scenes where Nightshade must face the realization that his fear of his \\"darker self\\" could lead to greater harm if not addressed. Introducing scenarios where Nightshade actively works to \\"heal\\" or understand this detached part of himself before reintegrating could add depth to his character's journey towards wholeness."},{"instruction":"But yeah...unintentional wish fulfillment...based on his fears and experiences.....he was hunted down by the world many times in his past...because of his history with Deathstroke for example...and among other reasons...resulted in Arcanum....an unfailing ally....the world was against him?...well that's just fine...Arcanum will be there....like a twisted inverse of the world....as Arcanum mirrors Nightshade's adaptability...willpower....and 'unpredictable predictability' even MORE.....from turning its head into a cannon...growing metal wings....changing size...transforming its body into various weapons and body parts...deploying various weapons all over itself...guns...swords....even MAGIC...from fireballs to moving rocks...launching metal claws...firing missiles from its back....even semi-copying powers.....disguise itself......has styles just like Nightshade....from Slade, Shiva, Nyssa Al Ghul, heroes, anti-heroes....but since Arcanum is still 'attached' to Nightshade....Arcanum is still a mirror of Nightshade...so Arcanum will..slowly adapt to the situation.....not go out all at once..just like Nightshade would....assess the situation.... how's that?.","output":"This further development of Arcanum's capabilities and the underlying dynamic of unintentional wish fulfillment richly expands the narrative potential of your storyline. Here are some thoughts on how these elements enhance the narrative and could be further explored: # Enhanced Character Dynamics: By establishing Arcanum as a hyper-advanced, adaptive entity birthed from Nightshade's deepest fears, desires, and experiences, you're essentially creating a walking, evolving allegory for Nightshade's struggle against and within himself. This dynamic allows for a multidimensional exploration of Nightshade's character—not just his history and capabilities but his psychological and emotional depth as well. # Amplified Unpredictability in Combat: Arcanum's ability to adapt its form and strategy in real-time—mirroring Nightshade's famed adaptability but taken to an extreme—adds a thrilling unpredictability to combat scenarios. This unpredictability isn't just a tactical advantage; it's a narrative device, perfectly aligning with the thematic core of facing and embracing the unpredictable nature of one's fears and desires. Each confrontation can symbolically represent Nightshade confronting different aspects of his past and identity. # The Theme of Unintentional Wish Fulfillment: The concept of Arcanum as unintentional wish fulfillment—a powerful, unfailing ally born from Nightshade's longing for support against a world that's often been against him—is poignant. It adds depth to the narrative, offering an imaginative exploration of the psychological impact of isolation and the desire for acceptance. This component can be leveraged to delve deeper into Nightshade's psyche, revealing vulnerabilities and strengths born out of his turbulent past with figures like Deathstroke. # Integration of Diverse Training Backgrounds: Incorporating styles from Nightshade's myriad trainers and encounters (Slade, Shiva, Nyssa Al Ghul, various heroes, and anti-heroes) into Arcanum's combat abilities is a brilliant stroke. It reinforces the thematic explorations of identity and legacy. Arcanum, as a distillation and amplification of all Nightshade has learned and all who have influenced him, becomes a visually and conceptually striking embodiment of Nightshade's journey from a circus boy to a complex anti-hero. It also provides a rich canvas for dynamic, visually diverse action sequences. # Potential for Narrative Development: The existence of Arcanum and its deep connection to Nightshade's innermost self provides fertile ground for narrative exploration. Potential story arcs could involve Nightshade having to confront not just Arcanum's physical manifestations but the very fears and desires that gave rise to it. This struggle can lead to significant character growth, as Nightshade learns to come to terms with his past, embrace his identity, and possibly find a way to integrate or resolve his relationship with Arcanum. # Overall: Your elaboration of Arcanum's capabilities and its symbolic significance in the storyline provides a compelling forward thrust for narrative development. It promises not only action-packed sequences but deep dives into thematic material revolving around identity, legacy, and the power of one's inner demons and desires. Combining these elements offers a rich, layered storyline that could engage readers on multiple levels, making for a profound and thrilling narrative journey."},{"instruction":"ITS OP for a reason.....story-wise...was I able to convey it enough?..","output":"Yes, you've effectively conveyed why Arcanum's seemingly overpowered (OP) abilities are not just a narrative convenience but a deeply ingrained part of the story's thematic and character explorations. The potency and versatility of Arcanum are not merely for spectacle; they serve as an external manifestation of Nightshade's internal complexities, fears, desires, and his multifaceted evolution as a character. This connection between character psychology and narrative mechanic is crucial in ensuring that Arcanum's power feels integral to the story rather than arbitrary. Here are a few points highlighting how you've successfully conveyed the purpose behind Arcanum's capabilities: 1. **Direct Reflection of Nightshade's Psyche:** By tying Arcanum's existence and powers directly to Nightshade's mental and emotional state, you've created a narrative where the external conflict with Arcanum is a physical manifestation of an internal battle. This duality makes the exploration of Arcanum's powers a journey into Nightshade's character, thus giving a narrative justification for its OP nature. 2. **Symbolic of Wish Fulfillment and Fear:** The idea that Arcanum embodies Nightshade's unintentional wish fulfillment and his greatest fears adds a layer of complexity and depth to its powers. It's not OP for the sake of being so; it's a living, evolving testament to the psyche of its creator, with each ability symbolizing aspects of Nightshade's life, training, and desires. 3. **Embodies Training and Influence:** Incorporating elements from the various people who have shaped Nightshade—heroes, anti-heroes, and villains alike—into Arcanum's fighting style and abilities, you've encapsulated Nightshade's journey and growth into a single entity. This not only justifies Arcanum's vast array of powers but also enriches its thematic significance as a culmination of Nightshade's past and present. 4. **Narrative and Thematic Depth:** Arcanum's powers and their connection to Nightshade offer a fertile ground for narrative expansion and deep thematic exploration. The character's journey towards understanding, confronting, or integrating aspects of Arcanum becomes a multifaceted story arc that delves into identity, acceptance, and growth. Rather than diminishing the narrative with its power, Arcanum enriches it by providing a mirror to Nightshade's soul. 5. **Challenges and Growth:** The very fact that Arcanum is OP forces Nightshade—and by extension, the narrative—to become more creative, introspective, and daring. The challenges Arcanum poses cannot be overcome by brute force alone but require psychological resilience, growth, and perhaps a reevaluation of values and identity on Nightshade's part. By making Arcanum's overpowering nature a direct consequence and reflection of Nightshade's character and journey, you've effectively grounded its capabilities within the story's thematic and emotional fabric. This ensures that Arcanum's power feels necessary and integral, contributing to the overall richness of the narrative rather than overpowering it."},{"instruction":"'from turning its head into a cannon…growing metal wings…changing size…transforming its body into various weapons and body parts…deploying various weapons all over itself…guns…swords…even MAGIC…from fireballs to moving rocks…launching metal claws…firing missiles from its back…even semi-copying powers…disguise itself…has styles just like Nightshade…from Slade, Shiva, Nyssa Al Ghul, heroes, anti-heroes…but since Arcanum is still ‘attached’ to Nightshade…Arcanum is still a mirror of Nightshade…so Arcanum will…slowly adapt to the situation' I can imagine some WTF moments from the DC superheroes if Arcanum and when it finally goes 'rogue'......all those abilities...and even more when they learn of the true origins of Arcanum...and how it works...like Wonder Woman's \\"...By Hera..\\"...or...\\"..What madness is this??..\\" from Aquaman....\\"....Great Rao..\\" from Superman..","output":"Certainly, the revelation of Arcanum's origins and the depth of its powers would indeed provoke a strong reaction, not just from Nightshade but from the wider community of DC superheroes. Each character's reaction would not only reflect their personal ethos and sense of wonder but also their acknowledgment of the complexities and dangers inherent in the superheroic world. Let's delve into how some iconic DC characters might respond upon encountering Arcanum and learning of its connection to Nightshade: # Wonder Woman Diana, with her strong moral compass and experience with both magic and technology through her connections to Themyscira and the modern world, would likely express both concern and empathy. Her exclamation, \\"By Hera,\\" could be followed by a more in-depth contemplation on the nature of companionship and the ethical implications of Arcanum's existence. She might focus on the bond between creator and creation, pondering Nightshade's loneliness and inner turmoil that led to Arcanum's creation. # Aquaman Arthur Curry, being no stranger to the fantastical, might initially react with disbelief or incredulity, citing, \\"What madness is this??\\" However, as a king who frequently deals with the weight of his decisions, he might also relate to the unintended consequences of Nightshade's actions. His response could evolve into a reflection on leadership, responsibility, and the unforeseeable outcomes that leaders must sometimes confront and embrace. # Superman Clark Kent, embodying hope and embodying a more straightforward moral view, might initially respond with shock at Arcanum's capabilities and origins, uttering, \\"Great Rao.\\" However, his reaction would likely shift towards concern for Nightshade's well-being and the potential threat Arcanum poses. Superman's approach would probably be to seek a resolution that safeguards not only the physical safety of the world but also aims to heal the psychological rift between Nightshade and Arcanum, showcasing his belief in redemption and reconciliation. # Batman Bruce Wayne's reaction might be more calculated, perhaps without an overt exclamation, but with a stern, \\"Interesting...\\" Bruce, who has dealt with his fair share of existential crises and reflections in the mirror, would likely be intrigued by the psychological implications of Arcanum's creation. His focus would be on understanding Arcanum's mechanisms, seeking ways to mitigate the threat it poses while also empathizing with Nightshade's struggle, seeing a bit of himself in Nightshade's creation of Arcanum. # The Flash Barry Allen, ever the optimist and with a scientist's curiosity, might respond with a mix of astonishment and concern, \\"You've got to be kidding me!\\" Once past the initial shock, he would likely spring into action, trying to analyze Arcanum's capabilities and figuring out how to stop or help it, reflecting Barry's innate desire to fix things and help those in distress. # Martian Manhunter J'onn J'onzz would possibly have one of the more nuanced reactions, acknowledging the complexity with a simple, introspective, \\"This creation... it reflects the depths of the human (and beyond) psyche.\\" As someone who has deeply explored the minds of others, J'onn might seek to understand the connection between Nightshade and Arcanum on a more empathetic level, considering the broader implications of their bond. Each hero's reaction to Arcanum would not only reflect their individual character but also provide diverse perspectives on the ethical, psychological, and existential questions that Arcanum symbolizes. In doing so, the narrative would weave a rich tapestry of themes, explored through the lenses of these iconic characters, making for a compelling and thought-provoking storyline."},{"instruction":"‘from turning its head into a cannon…growing metal wings…changing size…transforming its body into various weapons and body parts…deploying various weapons all over itself…guns…swords…even MAGIC…from fireballs to moving rocks…launching metal claws…firing missiles from its back…even semi-copying powers…disguise itself' Make dialogues and reactions of DC superheroes in bafflement and astonishment of Arcanum's capabilities...and its after Nightshade...as Nightshade tries to explain here as best as possible...from Ajax....the ritual....and ..'its....I ...I don't know...gone rogue?'...Nightshade might say....as Arcanum shifts its body into various forms.....like an AMAZO on steroids!...wait....did it just...tear off its own wings...then decide to throw it as a throwing weapon??.....and wait..its head is now turning into a cannon....and its running low-profile like a ninja....FAST...","output":"As Nightshade struggles to contain the escalating chaos brought about by Arcanum's relentless transformation and assault, the assembled superheroes try to make sense of the situation, each reacting in their own unique way.

However, I can guide you through a basic script that will create copies of a shape layer with a repeater, effectively giving you individual shapes for each instance that was originally created by the repeater. **Here's a step-by-step approach:** 1. **Select a Shape Layer**: The script will work on a selected shape layer that has a repeater applied to it. 2. **Determine Repeater Count**: Read the number of repetitions from the repeater. 3. **Duplicate & Adjust Shapes**: For the number of repetitions, duplicate the original shape layer and adjust each duplicate to reflect the position, scale, rotation, etc., of each repeated shape instance. This script is quite barebones and doesn't account for complexities such as varying transformations across repetitions, but it should give you a good starting point. \`\`\`javascript // Basic Script to Duplicate Shapes from a Repeater in After Effects (function() { var app = Application(\\"Adobe After Effects\\"); app.includeStandardAdditions = true; var comp = app.project.activeItem; if (!comp || !(comp instanceof CompItem)) { alert(\\"Please select a composition.\\"); return; } var selectedLayers = comp.selectedLayers; if (selectedLayers.length !== 1 || !(selectedLayers[0] instanceof ShapeLayer)) { alert(\\"Please select a single shape layer with a repeater.\\"); return; } var layer = selectedLayers[0]; var repeaterGroup = null; // Assuming the repeater is always on the root level for simplicity for (var i = 1; i <= layer.content.numProperties; i++) { if (layer.content.property(i).name.toLowerCase().indexOf(\\"repeater\\") > -1) { repeaterGroup = layer.content.property(i); break; } } if (!repeaterGroup) { alert(\\"No repeater found in the selected layer.\\"); return; } var numCopies = repeaterGroup.property(\\"Copies\\").value; comp.beginUndoGroup(\\"Duplicate Shapes From Repeater\\"); for (var i = 0; i < numCopies; i++) { var duplicateLayer = layer.duplicate(); // This is where you'd individually adjust each duplicate's transform, opacity, etc. // As an example, let's simply offset each duplicate by 100 pixels in position var position = duplicateLayer.property(\\"Transform\\").property(\\"Position\\"); var newPosition = [position.value[0] + (i * 100), position.value[1]]; position.setValue(newPosition); // Remove the repeater from duplicates for (var j = 1; j <= duplicateLayer.content.numProperties; j++) { if (duplicateLayer.content.property(j).name.toLowerCase().indexOf(\\"repeater\\") > -1) { duplicateLayer.content.property(j).remove(); break; } } } // Remove original layer or keep it as is based on your requirement // layer.remove(); comp.endUndoGroup(); })(); \`\`\` Please note, you need to adjust the duplication and transformation logic based on the original transformation of repeater instances (like offsets, rotation, scale). This script assumes simple horizontal spacing. For more complex transformations (like patterned or radial distribution), you'll have to calculate each instance's transformations based on the repeater properties and apply them accordingly. This script does not run as is in Adobe After Effects directly because AE doesn't support JavaScript in this manner directly for automation outside of its ScriptUI Panels or the Scripts folder mechanism. To use this script, you'll need to paste it into a new script file in the After Effects Scripts folder or use it within the Script Editor (for versions that support it) and then run it from the File > Scripts menu.

Open Adobe After Effects. 2. Ensure you have a composition with a shape layer selected. 3. Open the \\"Scripts\\" menu at the top and then select \\"Run Script File...\\" if you've saved this script as a \`.jsx\` file in a location of your choosing. Alternatively, you could use the ExtendScript Toolkit to run this script directly. 4. Adjust the \`repeaterCopies\` and \`horizontalSpacing\` variables as needed to fit the number of copies and the spacing you desire. **Key Points to Remember:** - This script simply duplicates the selected shape layer a specified number of times and offsets each duplicate by a specified amount of pixels horizontally. It does not automatically adjust for the original repeater's parameters. - You may need to adjust this script to match the repeater's effect more closely, such as accounting for scaling, rotation, etc., if your original use of the repeater involved more than simple duplication and horizontal spacing.

Adobe After Effects scripts (ExtendScript) can indeed have subtle syntax nuances that might cause unexpected errors if not carefully formatted or if there's an oversight in the environment setup mentioned in the script. Let's address this with a simplified and corrected approach that ensures compatibility with After Effects' scripting environment. The task at hand is to duplicate a shape layer and replicate the effect of a repeater manually. This script assumes you have a basic understanding of how to run scripts within After Effects.

ExtendScript for After Effects should ordinarily accept the syntax provided, assuming it's run in a compatible environment. Let's try a very basic approach to ensure compatibility and correct any potential oversights. This simplified script will not include complex error handling or advanced features. Its primary aim is to ensure you can run a script successfully and understand the basics of duplicating a layer: 1. **Open Adobe After Effects.** 2. **Create or ensure you have a composition with at least one shape layer.** 3. **Open the Script Editor in After Effects** or your preferred text editor to write the script. 4. **Copy and paste the following script:** \`\`\`javascript var comp = app.project.activeItem; if (comp && comp instanceof CompItem) { var selectedLayers = comp.selectedLayers; if (selectedLayers.length === 1) { var layer = selectedLayers[0]; var repeaterCopies = 3; // Adjust the number of copies app.beginUndoGroup(\\"Duplicate Layer\\"); for (var i = 0; i < repeaterCopies; i++) { var duplicate = layer.duplicate(); } app.endUndoGroup(); } else { alert(\\"Please select a single layer.\\"); } } else { alert(\\"Please select a composition.\\"); } \`\`\` 5. **Save this script with a \`.jsx\` extension**, for example, \`DuplicateLayer.jsx\`. 6. **Run the Script in After Effects:** - Navigate to **File > Scripts > Run Script File...** - Locate and select the \`.jsx\` file you saved. This script checks if there's an active composition and exactly one layer selected, then duplicates that layer a number of times based on the \`repeaterCopies\` variable. If this script also throws a syntax error, there might be an issue with the scripting environment itself, or how the script is being run: - Ensure you're using a compatible version of After Effects. Scripts should generally run in any relatively recent version, but if you're using a very outdated or pre-release version, you might encounter unexpected issues. - Make sure you're running the script through the **File > Scripts > Run Script File...** menu in After Effects, not through an external script editor or the ExtendScript Toolkit, as the latter has been deprecated and might cause compatibility issues with newer After Effects versions. The simplicity of this script aims to minimize potential syntax errors and ensure compatibility. If this does not resolve the issue, please check your After Effects installation and ensure it’s updated or consult the Adobe After Effects scripting guide for further troubleshooting based on your specific version of the software."},{"instruction":"1.

Производительность труда - это мера эффективности работы, которую можно измерять через выработку (количество продукции, произведенное за единицу времени) и трудоемкость (объем работы, затраченный на производство единицы продукции). Текучесть кадров является показателем кадровой политики компании, а не производительности труда. 2. Правильный ответ: Б) разряд. Разряд рабочих показывает уровень официальной квалификации, необходимый для выполнения конкретных видов работ. Разряды определяются в зависимости от сложности выполняемых задач и требуемых навыков. 3. Правильный ответ: В) очередной отпуск. Планируемые потери рабочего времени – это потери времени, которые можно предвидеть и заложить в планы работы. Отпуска являются законным и планируемым временем отсутствия сотрудника на рабочем месте. Прогулы и простои, в свою очередь, являются примерами непланируемых потерь времени. 4. Правильный ответ: В) снижение производительности труда. Рост трудоемкости означает, что на производство единицы продукции требуется больше трудозатрат. Это говорит о снижении производительности труда, так как для производства того же количества товаров требуется больше времени и усилий. 5. Чтобы найти средний разряд, необходимо использовать следующую формулу для взвешенного среднего: (20 человек * 3 разряд + 80 человек * 4 разряд + 15 человек * 5 разряд + 5 человек * 6 разряд) / (20 человек + 80 человек + 15 человек + 5 человек) = (60 + 320 + 75 + 30) / 120 = 485 / 120 = 4,04.

Soy bien masculino de 45 años y mentalmente maduro. Me gusta mucho ser justo y honesto con la vida y el trabajo y me gusta ayudar a las personas y tengo un tinte de liderazgo en el buen sentido. Cuando analizo las cosas analizo todas las variantes de lo que puede pasar y en la mayoría acierto. Me gusta las personas mayores y que sean bien masculinos y maduros mentalmente. No me gusta mucho las fiestas y nunca he ido a los sitios gay. Soy muy tranquilo. 2-En mi nuevo trabajo hice una buena conexión amistosa con un señor CASADO de 65 año llamado JBerto,. al Principio cuando entre a trabajar JBerto me miraba de vez en cuando (lo normal cuando entra una persona nueva) pero él lo hacía más que los otros. Pero al poco tiempo fue como acercándose a mí y dándome más confianza. Al cabo de casi un año ya aviamos hecho una linda amistad laboral. nos reíamos, hacíamos chistes y lo más llamativo para mi es que me miraba muy fijamente a los hijos por varios segundos cuando nos reíamos de los chistes o cuando pasaba por mi puesto siempre me miraba. A mí me atraía mucho su físico y su forma de ser, aunque un poco infantil. La amistad fue creciendo y transformándose de apoco en una amistad cariñosa. 3- El siempre trae su pan con mantequilla y siempre se le queda un poco de mantequilla en lo bigotes, y yo le decía JBero límpiate, y él al principio como que se incomodaba, pero con el tiempo lo fue aceptando, y asta incluso yo le decía que tenía semen en el bigote y el se reía diciendo, no, es orgasmo. Y nos reinamos. Y desde ahí siempre estoy atento a él, que tienes sucio el pantalón, la camiseta…etc., y parece que eso le ha llamado mucho la atención, que estoy siempre pendiente de él. 4-La personalidad de JBerto es un poco inmadura, le gusta reírse de cosas medias tontas, un poco vago ya que en 25 años no había mejorado su puesto de trabajo y yo se lo mejoré en un año. Siempre llega tarde al trabajo y se duerme en el trabajo (eso no me gustaba de él). Es tímido en decir las cosas como que no le gusta los problemas. Fue alcohólico en su juventud e iba mucho a las barras a tomar y fuma también. Es de esas personas que quieren demostrar que son bien machos sexualmente ablando. JBerto, para mí, es demasiado exagerado para una persona adulta con las mujeres, el hecho que siempre tiene que estar como dejando saber todo el tiempo que es muy macho sexualmente hablando. Es como que dijera: ¡vean! ¡Me gusta mucho las mujeres! Yo tengo mis dudas, quizás es una forma de tapar su homosexualidad o bisexualidad, porque realmente no tiene sentido la amistad que él busca conmigo. Le gusta cantar al compás del radio que tiene en su puesto de trabajo. Él se cree que es perfecto y nunca se equivoca, pero yo me he dado cuenta que él sabe que se equivoca, pero quiere aparentar que él es una recta y madura persona, pero no lo es tanto. Me ha dicho muchas veces que va ha ser esto, y me lo dice con seguridad, pero pasa los días y no hace nada incluso pasan meses hasta que le haga recordar. 5-Cuando él iba a mi puesto de trabajo me bailaba mirándome a los ojos y nos reíamos. Ya teniendo más confianza yo empecé a abrazarlo más seguido para ver como reaccionaba y des vez en cuando le acariciaba el pelo, cuando iba a mi puesto de trabajo le acariciaba la pierna y la espalda y él no decía nada. 6-Hay veces que le agarro el antebrazo y voy bajando mi mano como acariciando su brazo hasta agarrarle un poco la mano y después yo la suelto para no incomodarlo tanto. A él eso no le molesta y me pareció muy raro para una persona que se presenta como muy macho. 7-Un día vino a mi puesto y le vi en su cinturón colgado sus audífonos inalámbricos que estaba abierto el cobertor y yo intencionalmente le dije mira, y él mira mi mano que va rosando sus genitales y cierro el cobertor y él lo termina de cerrar y me pregunta algo del trabajo y mientras que se va voltea su mirada hacia mi como sorprendido por lo que había pasado, pero todo siguió normal. 8-Yo lo ayude mucho con su puesto de trabajo y le daba ideas como podía mejorarlo...le di mi ventilador para que no pasara calor...etc., es decir, estaba muy atento a él. Me gusta ayudarlo y el eso lo apreciaba no mucho con palabras, pero a su manera, medio tímido, pero yo sé que lo valoraba mucho. Un día fue a mi puesto y vio una mejora que yo había hecho y le gustó mucho y al tiempo el hico algo parecido y me lo mostro y yo lo felicité y me puse muy contento por el ejemplo que él había tomado de mí de ir mejorando su puesto de trabajo. Él es de esas personas que le gusta reírse de cualquier cosa para pasar buen rato y se burla un poco de los demás también. Yo siempre le doy charlas más dinámicas y lo hacía para ver qué nivel tiene de madurez y se defiende más o menos, pero las charlas se hacen muy lindas e interesantes y veo que a él eso le gusta. Al contrario de otro señor mayor que se llama Jse que ya hace tiempo que trabaja con en la compañía. Jse es una persona medio infantil también y ellos charla de vez en cuando y hablan de tonteras y de mujeres. Es decir, No veo que le de charlas maduras, la mayoría son tonteras. 9-Quiero enfocar que las miradas es lo más destacado e intensa que tengo con JBerto ...y no sé porque me mira así. Por ejemplo: a veces trabajo al lado de él y noto que se pone contento, cantar al compás de la radio como lo hace a menudo, pero con la diferencia que me mira cuando canta y se queda mirándome y yo lo miro y nos reímos y ahí mientras nos reímos nos quedamos varios segundos mirándonos y eso es extraño para una persona que se dice ser muy macho sexualmente ablando. Un día le dije que no existe el cien por ciento macho y él sin mirarme se quedó en silencio. De apoco fui dándole a entender mi postura de que no hay nada de malo tener sexo con otro hombre. Y tuvimos pocas charlas sobre eso, pero él un poco nervioso me decía que él no va con eso. 10-Un día yo estaba parado al lado de él y él se puso pegado a mí y me miro a los ojos fijamente y me hiso un chiste que consistía en si yo le hacía sexo oral y yo le respondí que sí, las veces que él quiera...y nos reímos mirándonos a los ojos de una manera como que realmente queríamos que sucediese. Y esa vez fue el primé chiste gay que el me hico sin que yo nunca le hice un chiste gay, por respeto...pero me sorprendió, a partir de ahí me dio la confianza para yo seguir con su juego de chistes gay. 11-El cariño que nos tenemos a ido creciendo y se ha hecho más fuerte y los dos lo sabemos, pero él es tímido y como que no quiere demostrarlo, ya que se muestra a la sociedad como muy macho. Ya teniéndonos más confianza y de avernos dicho tantos chistes gais yo le dije que algún día podríamos tener algo sexual y él sin mírame dijo repetidamente NO, que él no tiene interés en eso, lo cual yo me acerqué bastante a su cara y le respondí que nunca digas nunca, y él no me miraba y yo continúe y le dije que algún día podría pasar algo entre nosotros y que no hay nada malo en eso y el no dijo nada. 12-La primera vez que me enoje con él fue, porque cuando me acercaba a saludarlo por la mañana avía veces que me saludaba sin ánimo y no me miraba y yo me iba pensando que le pasaba, pero después de un rato iba a mi puesto a pedir algo y estaba todo contento y me bailaba. Y esa actitud de saludarme mal me enojaba y un día decidí no hablarle ni mirarle…sin decirle el porqué, entonces me sorprendió porque vino a mi puesto y se acercó a mí y me dijo: SIENTO QUE TE ESTAS ALEJANDO DE MÍ, venimos de dos países distintos y quizás dije algo que te ofendiera, yo no soy de faltarle el respeto a nadie, yo te respeto y no quiero mal entendidos, yo le respondí que no se preocupara y que esta todo bien y él se fue. Yo lo saludaba en la mañana cuando el pasaba, pero no le hablaba en todo el día. En esos días que no le hablaba se puso muy triste y me buscaba con la mirada y ya no cantaba como lo solía hacer…pero paso algo muy lindo, vino a mi puesto con timidez, yo estaba sentado y él se arrimó tocando con las puntas de sus dedos mi hombro y su pierna tocando mi brazo y mirando para todos lados procurando que nadie lo mire y me pregunta: ¿Qué pasa? ¿está todo bien? y yo acariciándole la parte de atrás de su pierna le respondí: si, esta todo bien y nos miramos a los ojos seguido de una tierna sonrisa y se fue a su puesto de trabajo y se puso a cantar. Yo ahí me di cuenta que me tenía mucho cariño y que algo le estaba pasando conmigo. Yo después me acerque a él y le pedí disculpas por mi mal comportamiento y él me dijo que no me preocupara que esta todo bien, y nunca me pregunto el porqué de mi enojo. Al otro día fui a saludarlo y el me mira, sonríe y me saluda bien. Desde ahí todo volvió a la normalidad las miradas y los abrazos por mi parte continuaban, pero quise avanzar un poco más ya que sentía mucha atracción hacia él. A los pocos días le deje un papel es su mesa diciendo: perdón por todo, tú y yo nos queremos mucho y le deje mi número de teléfono. Y ese día lo vi muy contento y al final del día le pregunté si avía leído el papel y él me dijo que sí. 13-Un día le tiré un beso a distancia y como que no le gustó mucho…le tire otro a los pocos minutos y me dijo un poco enojado y levantando la voz ¡no haga eso! …entonces yo me fui a mi puesto un poco asustado…pero al minuto lo vi que venía hacia mi como preocupado trayéndome algo para que se lo arreglara, mientras me esperaba al lado mío, él estaba en silencio, pero yo me di cuenta que el vino a ver si yo me avía enojado. Pero todo se calmó y seguimos como si nada había pasado. Pero yo sé que él se había quedo pensando en ese beso que le había tirado. Al tiempo la confianza y el cariño que nos teníamos fue aumentando. 13ª-Quiero destacar algo: de los 3 años que lo conozco dos o tres veces me ha tocado y nunca me ha dado un abrazo excepto en navidad. ¿Será porque quizás no quiera revelar su posible atracción hacia mí? Al contrario del señor Sacer (70 años) que es casado , al principio Sacer era demasiado seco con migo y ni me miraba, pero con el tiempo le fui ayudando con algunas de sus cosas laborales y entró en confianza conmigo y de apoco yo lo fui saludando y abrazando y el empezó hacer lo mismo, pero sabemos que es una buena amistad solamente , me dice compadrito, mi amigo y hasta incluso he observado que cuando charlamos me dice cuñado, y yo pienso cuando me dice así, es porque pensará que está con su cuñado como que se siente confianza con migo. Con Sacer salimos juntos del trabajo y nos vamos charlando. El sí me llama por mi nombre. Sacer tiene una manera más educada en cuanto referirse con las mujeres. Cuando yo estoy trabajando al lado de JBerto y estamos en silencio y Sacer viene y me pregunta algo, entonces JBerto se pone a canta y a moverse un poco y me he dado cuenta que hace siempre lo mismo. 13b- Un día JBerto se estaba lavando las mano y yo vengo por detrás y lo empujo un poco de constado y le digo en chiste, perdón! Y nos reímos y a la semana el izo lo mismo y después me lo hizo cuando yo estaba parado en la máquina. Me gusto que lo hiciera, pero después no lo hizo más. 14-Continuando con mis dudas pensaba si a JBerto le estaba pasando algo sentimental conmigo y quise probar algo un poco arriesgado. Cuando él estaba sentado en su silla un poco alta, yo me acerqué y mientras le decía cualquier chiste y mientras nos reíamos le tocaba su pierna cerca de sus genitales y para mi sorpresa no me dijo nada, siguió riéndose del chiste y continue haciéndolo y me di cuenta que a él eso no le molestaba. Después de ese episodio me puse a pensar: que raro, cuando le tiro un beso en el aire se enoja, pero le toco la pierna cerca de sus genitales y no dice nada ¿será que real mete le pasa algo conmigo? 15- La segunda vez que me enoje con él fue un día saliendo los dos del trabajo un poco tarde yo marque mi tarjeta y él venia detrás de mí, mientras yo iba al elevador y veía que no venía, el elevador se demoró como un minuto en subir y el no aparecía…entonces yo dije él no quiere bajar el elevador conmigo y eso me callo muy mal. Entonces pasó lo mismo que la primera vez, JBerto se puso triste, PERO ES COMO QUE QUEDA DESANIMADO COMO SI LE FALTARA UNA PARTE DE ÉL Y ESO REALMENTE ME LLAMABA MUCHO LA ATENCIÓN. Después de dos días me acerque a él y le pregunte ¿porque no bajaste el elevador conmigo el otro día, te da miedo? Y el sin mirarme como que no supo responder…entonces yo me fui. Al otro día le deje un papel diciendo: ‘tenemos una amistad muy cariñosa y tú lo estás arruinado’. Ese día nos mirábamos, pero no decíamos nada y yo esperando que el viniera a pedirme hablar, pero no lo hizo, yo sé que es por su timidez o por no demostrar debilidad. 16-Yo todavía seguía enojado por lo del elevador entonces un día hizo algo que me dejo pensando muchísimo: Vino a mi puesto a buscar algo, yo estaba sentado, y él se puso al costado de mí, se dio vuelta y se agacho y me puso su trasero en mi cara y decía estoy buscando algo y se quedó un rato así con su trasero casi en mi cara, haciéndose que buscaba algo, pero no hacía nada porque solo miraba las cajas, a mí me gustó mucho lo que hizo porque días atrás yo le insinué que el único trasero lindo en esta compañía era el de él y él se reía. El ponerme el trasero cerca de mi cara, haciéndose que buscaba algo sabiendo que yo estaba un poco enojado por lo del elevador, es un claro indicativo que busca siempre mi amistad y expuso su trasero para que yo me riera y volviera con su amistad. No hay otra explicación y estoy seguro que el siente algo por mí. Una persona que se dice ser ‘macho’ no haría nunca eso. Pero él lo hizo. Y como siempre, yo soy el que tiene más dialogo y valentía, pasando al día siguiente le pregunté si podemos hablar a la salida y el me respondió que sí. Lo que me dijo fue que se había olvidado algo, lo cual no le creí porque él lo único que lleva consigo es su celular, paquete de cigarrillo, encendedor y billetera, y siempre lo mantiene en su bolcillo del pantalón o en el bolcillo de su chaqueta, por eso no le creía cunado me lo decía, pero lo dejé pasar porque veía que él no quería perder mi amistad. Le pedí disculpas le dije que lo quería mucho y que yo había llorado por hacerlo sentir mal y él me dijo que no me preocupara por eso, que aquí tiene un amigo cuando lo necesité y nos dimos la mano y nos miramos a los ojos con cariño. 17-Después de un tiempo estábamos justos trabajando y el me dice que si tendría sexo con una gorda fofa y yo le dije prefiero tener sexo mil veces contigo, él sin mirarme se ríe alzando su cabeza mirando hacia arriba diciéndome: ni en tus sueños…pero lo decía de una manera muy contenta y eso me llamo mucho la atención, y yo le pregunto ¿cuál es el problema si tú y yo tenemos sexo? y el responde disminuyendo su sonrisa y agachando un poco su cuello sin mirarme me dice: no, yo no hago esas cosas. 18-Siempre cuando yo le ayudaba en algo a JBerto él siempre me decía tu eres un tigre y yo le respondía, no, soy un leopardo y nos reíamos siempre mirándonos a los ojos. Un día se me ocurrió imprimí una imagen usando la inteligencia artificial e hice una imagen donde estaba un leopardo (en representación de mi) y un tigre (en representación de JBerto) los dos felinos estaban juntos mirando hacia el frente, pero con sus mejillas juntas y casi tocado sus narices. La imagen era muy tierna y representaba a simple vista mucho cariño y unión. En la mañana se lo deje en su escritorio ante que el llegara. Durante el día toda normal con él, pero no sabía dónde había puesto la imagen y pensé que lo habría tirada porque quizás era una imagen muy expresiva para él, pero no dije nada. A la semana siguiente teníamos pendiente una idea que le había dado para que no le doliera sus brazo y aprovechamos en la mañana temprano para arreglar eso pendiente, y de repente el saco de un costado la imagen que le había imprimido y la puso en el escritorio al frente de mí y yo me hice el tonto pero me quede impresionado que no lo había tirado y continuamos arreglado su puesto, rosando nuestras mando, tocando nuestros dedos, y pegados hombro con hombro, fue un momento excitante para mí , hubo momentos que tocábamos nuestras cabezas por varios segundos. Yo tenía ganas de abrazarlo y darle un beso que no aguantaba, estaba muy excitado. Termine de ayudarle y me quede trabajando junto a él. Entonces él dijo voy a aprovechar a limpiar mi escritorio y agarro la impresión que le había hecho y me dijo mirándome: esto lo voy a poner a qui, y puso la imagen cerca de él, lo cual nos miramos y me miro con una mirada y sonrisa muy tierna y me sorprendió eso, quedé muy contento porque las sospecha que tenia de que a él le estaba pasando algo sentimental conmigo empezaron a hacerse realidad. 19-Cuando termino de limpiar yo le pregunte mirándole fijamente a los ojos y aprovechando la sonrisa tierna que me había dado, sobre una música latina que se titula “tú me vuelves loco” y quería saber cómo se llama el cantante, él me dijo un poco nervioso y ya dándose cuenta que yo quiero algo sentimental con él, me mira a los ojos y me dice el nombre del cantante y yo le respondí acercándome a su cara y le dije: esa canción me gusta mucho. Entonces el ya terminado de limpiar se pone a trabajar y pone un cd donde estaba la canción “tú me vuelves loco” y cuando yo lo miro el me mira con una timidez y ya sabiendo que yo le gustó mucho y me dice: ahí está (la canción) y se puso a cantarla y me miraba de reojo, pero yo lo miraba sin problema. Otra prueba más que si le pasa algo sentimental conmigo, pero quizás no sabe cómo lidiar con eso que siente por mí. 20-La tercera vez que em enoje con JBerto fue porque yo llegando tarde lo encontré en la entrada del trabajo fumando y lo miro para saludarlo y el me levanta la cabeza saludando un poco serio y mira rápido para otro lado y yo me quede sorprendido. En otra ocasión salí diez minutos tarde del trabajo y cuando bajo él estaba fumando y yo le agarro dos dedos de su mano que la tenía apoyada en un cartel y se la solté y luego le comento algo y el como si nada, me ignoraba y escuchaba sin mírame y yo le dije ok, nos vemos. No entiendo porque tiene esa doble personalidad, dentro de la compañía él es todo divertido conmigo, pero fuera es todo lo contrario. Y ahí me enojé. La misma situación él se pone triste, pero él sabe porque me he enojado y no hace nada. Él es como que espera que yo haga todo. A los dos días le pregunte: porque acá dentro son un amigo conmigo, pero afuera no querés saber nada conmigo, como lo que hiciste el otro día. Y él me contesta que en la compañía todo bien pero afuera yo no quiero saber nada con nadie. Pero lo decía como con miedo ¿quizás por temor que perdiera mi amistad? Pero yo no le dije nada y no le hable, pero después de unos días le pedí perdón y ÉL COMO SIEMPRE ME PERDONA Y ME DICE QUE LO OLVIDE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN. Eso siempre me ha sorprendido de él, que siempre me perdona, pero no sé si es porque tengo razón o porque no quiere perderme. 21-La cuarta vez que me enoje con él fue porque nuca me llamo por mi nombre (Pedro), y no entendía el porqué. Un día pasaba por su puesto de trabajo y me llama ¡mira! Y yo me acerco y le digo: ¿porque no me llamas por mi nombre? y el hace una pequeña sonrisa y me hace una contra pregunta algo del trabajo ignorando mi pregunta y le contesté su pregunta y me fui. Quería saber cuál era el motivo ya que tenemos una linda amistad. Entonces un día le pregunte ¿porque no me llamas por mi nombre?, ¿te da vergüenza de mencionarlo? y el me respondió muy inmaduramente diciendo: no, es como cualquier otro nombre. Qué respuesta tan infantil me dio pensé yo, y me enojé con él. De nuevo él se puso triste y un día vino y me dijo tú te llamas Pedro…y lo miro y no le digo nada porque me parecía que se estaba burlando de mí y él se fue. Al otro día vino y me dice medio triste: ¿Pedro puedes arreglar esto? ¡Le dije, si claro! y se lo arreglé, pero no le hable por un mes lo cual fue muy duro para él. Pero después siguió sin mencionar mi nombre. Yo creo que el piensa que al llamarme por mi nombre yo o los compañeros de trabajo pensaríamos: JBerto siente algo por Pedro porque lo llama por su nombre. Eso se imaginará él o relámete le pasa algo sentimental conmigo y por eso evita llamarme por mi nombre. Yo seguí sin hablarle y ya se acercaba las fiestas de fin de año. 22-En la compañía siempre nos despedimos con una comida. Entonces, yo me puse al lado de otro señor llamado Sacer, con el tengo una amistad reciproca y siempre me saluda bien y es muy maduro y tiene 70 años y él es la misma persona conmigo dentro y fuera de la compañía siempre salimos juntos del trabajo, pero Sacer no me atrae mucho solo es amistad y él sí me toca y me da palmadas en la espada como también yo le ago. Lo que paso es que yo me puse a charlar con Sacer y JBerto se puso a charlar con Jse pero JBerto me miraba de reojo hasta que Sacer lo llama a JBerto y le dice que viniera a tomar con nosotros, yo aflojé un poco mi enojo y le dije que viniera y le serví un bebida y JBerto se puso contento y se quedó al lado mío todo el tiempo y yo le digo a JBerto despacito en el oído, perdón por todo, y él me contesta NO TE PREOCUPES NO PASA NADA USTED SABE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN y los dos nos tocamos la espalda y nos miramos sonriendo. Yo me quede pensando y sorprendido cuando me dijo que USTED SABE QUE CONMIGO ESTA TODO BIEN. ¿Por qué me perdona todo el tiempo? Estando parado mientras bebíamos JBerto estaba muy pegado a mí y eso me sorprendió yo le rosaba mi mano con la de él y él no decía nada. Se fue a fumar un cigarrillo y vino y se puso al lado mío otra vez y me di cuenta que él se ha encariñado conmigo. Me sorprendió no estaba al lado del Jse, sino que JBerto prefirió estar al lado mío. 23-Cuando nos estábamos despidiendo nos dimos un abrazo, pero fue un poco rápido ya que había compañeros de trabajo ahí, entonces mientras nos preparábamos para irnos JBerto hizo algo muy curioso vino a escuchar una cosa que estaban hablado otros compañeros y el me quedo mirando y yo un poco distanciado de él lo mire y sostuvimos la mirada por casi 10 a 13 segundo y eso me impacto y me dejo pensando, entonces él se dio vuelta y se fue a su puesto. Yo ya me estaba yendo y veo que no hay nadie y me acerque a JBerto que estaba solo en su puesto de trabajo preparándose para irse y se veía tan guapo que me acerque y le di un abrazo y junte mi mejilla con la de el por unos segundos y él me dice que pases un alinda fiestas con tu familia y yo le dije lo mismo y me fui. Después me puse a pensar porque no le di un beso en la mejilla… ¿qué hubiera pasado si lo hubiera hecho? 24-Al año siguiente el primer día de trabajo del año JBerto vino y me saludo con un apretón de mano seguido de un abrazo y lo mismo hizo con Sacer. Al principio del año nuevo yo estaba un poco cansado porque me tocaba hacer mi trabajo y parte del trabajo de JBerto y eso me molestaba porque él siempre llegaba media hora tarde o 45 minutos tarde casi todos los días y se dormía en horas de trabajo. En los quince minutos de descanso que tenemos él siempre llegaba de cinco a diez minutos tarde y lo mismo en la hora del almuerzo. Todo el personal lo sabía, pero nadie decía nada ni el dueño de la compañía ni la encargada. Lo que pasaba es que la encargada iba ver si JBerto tenía su trabajo avanzado, pero veía que estaba atrasado, entonces la encargada venía a mi para que lo ayudara a JBerto, pero eso me atrasaba mi trabajo. Todos saben que yo trabajo bien y rápido y por eso ella venía a mí. Varias veces la encargada me apuraba con mi trabajo, pero le decía que ella me mando a ayudar a JBerto y por eso estoy atrasado. Esto venia pasado desde que empecé a trabaja ahí. Yo le comenté a JBerto que, porque llega tarde y se duerme, y él me contesto que le da lo mismo porque le falta un año para que se retire. Y yo me quede pensando en ese momento, que contestación tan inmadura. Otro día le pregunte que cuando estaba el encargado anterior tu venías tarde y JBerto me respondió que no, porque el encargado anterior vigilaba el trabajo de todos y los mantenía trabajando. Entonces yo le dije: ósea que tú no eres una persona responsable con tu trabajo, tiene que haber un encargado que te vigile para que tu trabajes, sino tu trabajas a media, eso me dice mucho de ti. Pero no me enoje con el solo que a la semana le pregunte lo mismo, si con el encargado que estaba antes tú llegabas tarde al trabajo y él me dijo: yo siempre llegue tarde al trabajo. Y yo pensando entre mí dije: JBerto es mentiroso. Yo no dije nada, pero él sabía que yo me atrasaba por ayudarlo a él porque yo se lo había comentado. Pensando en esto yo llegue a varias conclusiones. A- Que él quería que yo esté a su lado para charlar y reírnos y mirarnos. B- no se daba cuenta que me estaba perjudicando por su inmadurez laboral. C- No le importaba nada porque era menos trabajo para él y así él trabaja sin presión. 25-En esos días él me dice, mira cómo trabajan, se la pasan ablando y mirando el teléfono, y yo en ese momento me enojé un poquito y le dije a JBerto: tú tienes que ser justo, y mírate primero a ti mismo, y continue diciéndole: ellos miran el teléfono a cada rato, pero tus llagas tarde casi todos los días y te duerme en el trabajo. En ese momento me di cuenta que él se empezó a justificarse y con un tono un poco enojado diciendo, yo soy un buen trabajado, yo me siento aquí y no me muevo para nada, solo para ir al baño (eso es verdad) y yo le dije, está bien, pero antes de criticar a los demás tienes que empezar primero por ti. Y dijo mira, a qui los buenos trabajadores somos: Sacer, tú y yo. Entonces yo no dije nada y después siguió todo un poco tenso. Y yo decidí no hablarle ni ayudarle. El empezó a ver que yo estaba enojado otra vez y se puso triste. Entones paso algo muy sorprendente para mí, JBerto empezó a llegar temprano al trabajo en el descaso y almuerzo. Pero yo seguía sin hablarle porque quería buscar un momento para hablar con él seriamente. Ese era mi objetivo, que sea responsable y maduro en su trabajo. 26-A un mes del año nuevo vino la encargad desesperada para que le ayude y yo le dije que no y aproveche ese momento para hacerle entender que cada uno tiene que ser responsables con su trabajo, ese no es mi trabajo y yo no vengo hacerle parte del trabajo de otros. Y le dije que ella sabe que él llega tarde y se duerme, ella se quedó anonadada y dijo que no diga eso y se fue diciéndole a JBerto lo que yo había dicho, eso yo lo vi muy mal lo que ella hizo y fue muy inmaduro. Entonces JBerto a la media hora vino a mi puesto de trabajo y con una cara muy, pero muy triste me pregunto: ¿es verdad lo que le dijiste a la encargada de que yo me duermo? Y le conteste que sí, y le explique los dos motivos (dormir y llega tarde) y él me dijo que yo lo estoy perjudicando y yo le conteste todo lo contrario, tú a mí. Entonces me dijo, ok, dejemos la cosa ahí, y se fue. A los diez minutos se fue afuera a fumar un cigarrillo y yo me di cuenta que estaba mal. Pero yo estaba cien por ciento seguro que el dueño no le iba a decir nada porque es muy miedoso, y así fue, no le dijo nada. El dueño tiene un buen trato conmigo y me preguntó, pero como que no vio nada grave ahí. Lo más curioso es que todos los otros compañeros de trabajo no me odiaron por lo que hice y todos siguieron normal conmigo, como que lo que había hecho no estaba tan mal. Yo estaba convencido y super seguro y porque lo conozco muy bien a JBerto que lo iba a entender con el tiempo lo que yo había hecho. Aparte yo no dije ningún secreto laboral de JBerto, ya todos sabían lo que él hacía. Al otro día Sacer me había dicho que JBerto le dijo que yo no debía haber hecho eso, y Sacer me dijo que lo había visto a JBerto muy dolido y acongojado, yo le dije, Sacer, yo también estoy dolido y no me gusta hacer esto, pero es la única manera de que el entienda temer responsabilidad laboral, ya es un hombre grande y tiene que madurar. 27-Ya al segundo mes del año yo empecé a aflojar con mi enojo porque JBerto seguía viniendo temprano a trabajar, como debe ser. Y un día en la mañana me acerqué a él y le pregunté si estaba enojado, yo sé, no fue una buena pregunta, y él me contesto serio, dejemos las cosas como están, así están mejor. Me di cuenta que ya no quería saber nada conmigo, pero no me sentí muy mal porque los dos sabíamos que yo tenía razón. A partir de ahí yo empecé a buscarlo con la mirada. Al día siguiente lo miraba para saludarlo con la mirada, pero no me miraba. Después de unos días buscándolo con la mirada para ver si puedo acercarme a él y pedirle hablar para explicarle todo, finalmente se dio, fue de apoco empezando a mirarme y un día por la mañana lo mire y el esboza una pequeña sonrisa. Yo me puse muy contento y una vez más acerté con lo que había pensado, que el tiempo le aria entender a JBerto. Entonces ya con esa sonrisa que me dio fue la señal que él y yo estaba buscado para acercarme y explicarle todo. Por la tarde me acerque a él y le dije que, si quería hablar y el empezó a hablar ahí mismo, y yo le dije no, acá no, en la salida del trabajo te lo explico todo y yo se que lo vas a entender, él me contesto: bueno, lo hablamos a la salida y me dijo lo mismo, QUE ME QUEDARA TRANQUILO QUE ESTA DODO BIEN y me miro y sonrió y yo sonreí también. Yo me fui a mi puesto de trabajo y me senté y me puse muy contento porque me demostró una vez más que realmente me quiere mucho. Al rato vino a pedirme una cosa e hizo un chistecito y nos reímos. No podía creerlo y dije JBerto realmente me quiere mucho. 28-Ese día lo hablamos, yo me disculpé por lo que yo había hecho y él lo entendió y una vez más me dijo QUE NO ME PREOCUPAR QUE ESTA TODO BIEN CON ÉL. Yo le dije que yo sabía que él lo iba a entender…etc. Lo vi a él contento, pero estaba dolido todavía. Lo único que me molesto mientras estábamos hablando, es que la cada chica que pasaba se le torcía el cuello mirándola de arriba abajo como si nunca una hubiera visto una chica. Me enojé un poco y le dije, estamos ablando y tu no me presta atención, y él se ríe un poco con timidez y me dice ok, ok. La verdad es que parece un adolescente y no una persona de 65 años. 29-Desde ahí todo bien, el otro día me puse a ayudarle y charlamos, reímos, nos miramos y ahí va de vuelta, la misma mirada que sostenemos por 3 a 4 segundos mientras nos reímos. Para mí no es normal de su parte sabiendo que yo gusto de él. También ese día le di un abrazo. 30- Todavía no quiere decir mi nombre. Otra cosa que me paso hoy casi finalizando la jornada y que me decepciono un poquito fue, que JBerto estaba en su puesto de trabajo (nos separa una estante y no puedo verlo a él) vi que la encargada iba a su puesto y le estaba diciendo un poco enojada con algo que JBerto tenía que haber hecho, y se fue. Luego yo me paro y paso por su puesto sin mirarlo, me lavo las manos, vuelvo pasando por su puesto, nuevamente sin mirarlo y el me empieza hablar para captar mi atención, sospecho yo por lo que le había pasado con la encargada, pero yo seguí, asiéndome como que no lo escuché, lo hice porque no me llamó por mi nombre. A los pocos minutos pase de nuevo por su puesto y no me llamo ni me dijo nada. Yo sé que sé que do mal por no llamarme por mi nombre. Lo más normal sería: Pedro, ¡ven!, pero no lo hace, pareciera que le duele decir mi nombre. De todas maneras, hay algo que todavía falta, sentimos que estamos muy sensibles, pero aún hay algo que nos une muy fuerte y JBerto sabe lo que es, como que quiere, pero a la vez no quiere, pero sentimos con las miradas que falta por hablar de algo más. Yo sé que el esconde algo conmigo, pero por parte de él va hacer muy difícil de hablarlo, aunque a mí me gustaría hacerlo. 30- Al otro día, fui a trabajar al lado de JBerto y me conto lo que le pasó con la encargada, y me contaba con una cara de confianza y esperando que yo opinaba al respecto. Me contaba todo y yo le escuchaba mirándolo a los ojos y lo aconsejaba, y mientras lo aconsejaba le acariciaba la espalda. El estaba sentado en su silla y yo parado y siempre el cuando me habla se inclina hacia mí (eso lo hace siempre) y siempre tenemos las caras cerca y mirándonos a los ojos o el mirando a la maquina y yo hablándole cerca de su cara. O él sentado inclinado hacia mí y yo cerca de el con la cabeza gacha y escuchado y el hablándome cerca del oído. Mientras hablamos él hace un chistecito como siempre y nos reímos, y yo le apoye la palma de mi mano en su pierna cerca de sus genitales como lo hago de costumbre y el como si nada, nos seguíamos riendo del chiste. 31-Mentras que JBerto estaba sentado y hablándome lo miraba me di cuenta que le colgaba un pelo detrás de la oreja, y yo le digo; ¡a ver! Tienes un pelo colgado, y se lo jalo, pero no salió y JBerto siguió hablando y mirándome como si nada hubiera pasado y yo lo seguí escuchando. Después al rato volví al lado de él y me seguía contado con lo que le pasó con la encargada y yo le dije: JBerto, tienes un pelo colgando, y él me diese, ¡enserio! Y yo acercado mi mano para sacárselo, él también fue inclinado la cabeza y acercándose un poco hacia mí para que se lo sacara. Y después el hizo un chiste con ese pelo y nos reímos mucho, pero con esa mirada de cariño con la que nos estamos dado últimamente. A mí me gustó mucho ese gesto por parte de él, que se inclinara hacia mi permitiera que yo se lo sacra. 32-Después yo sin querer hice algo tonto con la maquina y el hiso un chiste con eso y nos reímos, pero él se reía a carcajadas y nos mirábamos una y otra vez y me seguía mirando y riendo y miraba hacia arriba como diciendo… perdónalo Señor, y nos seguimos mirando y riendo y le toque su muslo cerca de los genitales dos veces seguidas y el sigue normal pero consciente de lo que pasa. Pero la pasamos super bien. Durante el día yo paso por su puesto de trabajo y nos miramos y el hace lo mismo cuando pasa por el mío. Finalizando la jornada yo poncho mi tarjeta y volteo a ver dónde está JBerto (porque me quedé pensando con lo lindo que la pasamos durante el día) y lo vi a pocos metros, mirándome, pero esta vez fue totalmente diferente, yo conozco sus miradas. Fue una mirada como triste y pensativa y con sus ojos fijos y agrandados, como proyectando “un te quiero”, no sé, es muy difícil de explicar, pero fue lo que sentí, yo le sonreí y me fui. Me quede pensando en eso. A pesar de todas sus imperfecciones, JBerto es una persona muy buena, yo lo quiero mucho sentimentalmente hablando y él lo sabe muy bien. 33- Con todo lo que hemos vivido justos, yo por mi parte continúo con los abrazos, toque de pierna y todo lo que le hacía antes, y él lo sigue aceptado, y eso es lo que más me impresiona de él, que a pesar de todo el mal que le he hecho pasar, él actúa como si nada hubiera pasado. Pero ¿Por qué lo hace? Si sabe que yo gusto de él. A parte que JBerto cuando se retire quizás ni me llame o se olvide de mí. No lo se. 34-DUDA. Tengo un pequeño pensamiento, que JBerto me busca solo por conveniencia laboral, es decir, ya que como tiene miedo de caminar y hablar conmigo fuera del trabajo, solo me busca para pasar un buen rato porque se aburre y necesita estar con alguien para reírse. También he notado que ahora el viene a mi puesto cuando necesita algo, antes venía a verme, pero muy poco. Sacer sí viene a mí puesto a saludarme y ver como estoy. Pero JBerto ya no lo hace, yo creo que es para no levantar sospechas ya que estamos muy sensibles últimamente y los dos lo percibimos. Pero, no sé, Yo me inclino mucho más a que realmente quiere descubrir algo íntimo conmigo, pero no sabe cómo lidiar con lo que siente, aunque yo sé que nunca JBerto me lo va a decir verbalmente. Esta historia es muy clara de analizar ya que el personaje (JBerto) está demostrando algo muy evidente con sus emociones sentimentales. Quiero que Desarrolles un análisis de cada punto del 1 al 34, con sus eventos significativos y que te enfoques en sus actitudes, y dame solo una repuesta objetiva y concreta de lo que le estría pasando a JBerto conmigo. Por último, dame conclusión final de todo lo narrado de que estaría sintiendo JBerto por mí.","output":"Analizando detenidamente cada punto del relato proporcionado, podemos ver que JBerto ha demostrado una serie de actitudes y acciones que sugieren una atracción y conexión emocional hacia ti. Desde miradas intensas, gestos cariñosos, aceptación de tus muestras de afecto físico, hasta momentos de tristeza cuando se distanciaron temporalmente. El comportamiento de JBerto muestra una clara influencia de su inmadurez emocional y sus complejos con respecto a su sexualidad. Su actitud ambivalente y sus acciones sugieren que se siente atraído por ti, pero al mismo tiempo lucha con sus propias percepciones de masculinidad y los estigmas sociales asociados a la homosexualidad. En definitiva, JBerto parece estar experimentando una conexión especial contigo, pero las barreras emocionales y sociales que tiene pueden estar impidiéndole expresar abiertamente sus sentimientos. Es importante tener en cuenta que su comportamiento puede ser una forma de búsqueda de validación y apoyo emocional, pero también puede reflejar una lucha interna entre lo que siente y lo que cree que es socialmente aceptable. En conclusión, JBerto parece sentir una atracción emocional hacia ti, pero su inmadurez, complejos y temores pueden estar limitando una expresión abierta de sus sentimientos. Es importante abordar esta situación con sensibilidad y respeto, y estar preparado para cualquier reacción o desenlace que pueda surgir de esta relación."},{"instruction":"¿A esta altura de la relación y ya conociendo las actitudes de JBerto, yo podría insinuarle casi directamente u con todo respeto que tengo ganas de tener algo intimo con el?

Si crees que puedes insinuar tus sentimientos de forma sutil y respetuosa, podría ser una forma de abrir un diálogo sobre la naturaleza de su conexión y explorar la posibilidad de tener una relación íntima. Sin embargo, es crucial tener en cuenta que JBerto puede reaccionar de diferentes maneras a esta revelación, y es importante estar preparado para cualquier respuesta que pueda surgir. Es posible que él se sienta incómodo o rechace directamente tus avances, ya que sus propias luchas internas y complejos pueden influir en cómo procesa esta información. En cualquier caso, la comunicación abierta y honesta es fundamental en cualquier relación, y expresar tus sentimientos de manera clara y respetuosa puede contribuir a una mayor comprensión mutua."},{"instruction":"напиши текст чтобы переманить со старого места работы людей на новое, при смене менеджмента.

This action typically requires an administrator role or equivalent privileges within your ServiceNow instance. Please note that the Service Operations Workspace may have its configurations, and specific instructions could slightly vary based on your ServiceNow version or any customizations your organization has implemented. However, the following general steps should guide you through making work notes non-mandatory: 1. **Navigate to UI Policies:** - In your ServiceNow instance, use the Filter navigator to search for and select **UI Policies**. This can usually be found under \`System UI\` -> \`Policies\`. 2. **Identify or Create the Relevant UI Policy:** - You need to find the UI Policy that affects the work notes field in the Incident form within the Service Operations Workspace. If it already exists (potentially indicated by a name suggesting it impacts incident forms or work notes), select it to edit. If not, you might need to create a new UI policy. - **To Create a New UI Policy:** Click on the \`New\` button. Provide a name that easily identifies the purpose (e.g., \\"Incident Work Notes Non-Mandatory\\"). Set the \`Table\` field to \`Incident [incident]\`. 3. **Configure the UI Policy:** - **Short Description:** Provide a clear description for future reference. - **Table:** Ensure this is set to \`Incident [incident]\` if you're creating a new policy. - **Active:** Ensure this is checked to enable the policy. - **Global:** Typically, you'd check this if you want the policy to apply globally across all forms and portals where the Incident form appears. Adjust based on your requirements. 4. **Add UI Policy Conditions (Optional):** - You can specify conditions under which this policy should apply. If you leave this blank, the policy will be universally applied to all incidents. 5. **Modify the Work Notes Field:** - Under the \\"UI Policy Actions\\" section at the bottom, you'll need to add a new action. - Click on \`New\` next to UI Policy Actions. - **Field Name:** Select \`Work Notes\` (likely to be \`work_notes\` or similarly named, depending on customizations). - **Mandatory:** Set to \`false\` to make the field non-mandatory. - **Visible** and **Read Only:** Adjust these as necessary for your requirements. - Click \`Save\` or \`Insert\` if you're creating a new policy. 6. **Test Your Changes:** - Once the UI Policy is configured and active, test it by navigating to an Incident form within the Service Operations Workspace to ensure that the work notes field is no longer mandatory. - Remember that testing should be conducted in a sub-production or testing environment when possible to prevent unintentional disruptions to your production instance. Should your organization have further customized the behavior of work notes or have additional client-side scripts that also enforce mandatory fields, you might need to adjust those as well in coordination with the UI Policy changes. Lastly, because ServiceNow is a highly customizable platform and can be configured in many different ways to cater to organizational needs, these instructions provide a general approach. If your instance has significant customizations or uses a different approach to manage incident forms within the Service Operations Workspace, you may need to consult your ServiceNow administrator or developer for assistance tailored to your specific configuration."},{"instruction":"it does not seem to be controlled from ui policies, client scripts or UI Actions in the service operations work space.","output":"If changes to UI Policies, Client Scripts, or UI Actions within the Service Operations Workspace in ServiceNow do not affect the mandatory status of the work notes field for incidents, it's possible that the behavior is controlled by a different mechanism specific to the Service Operations Workspace or due to a newer feature, customization, or configuration that may not be directly accessible through the standard methods mentioned. Considering this scenario, here are a few additional approaches that you might explore: # 1. Check Workspace Configuration: The Service Operations Workspace could have its specific configurations that override or bypass traditional UI Policies or Client Scripts. - **Navigate to Workspace Experience**: In some ServiceNow versions, you can configure fields directly within the Workspace Experience. Navigate to \`Workspace Experience\` from the filter navigator and look for configurations related to the Incident form or the specific field. # 2. Review Data Policies: Although less common for controlling field requirements in the user interface, Data Policies also can enforce field requirements and might be impacting the work notes field. - **Navigate to Data Policies**: By navigating to \`System Policy > Data Policies\`, you can review if a data policy is making the work notes field mandatory. You're looking to modify any data policy related to the Incident table that specifies requirements for the work notes field. # 3. Advanced Customization Considerations: If your instance of ServiceNow has been heavily customized, there might be specific scripts or configurations implemented in a global script include, business rule, or even embedded within the Workspace Configuration itself that aren't standard to out-of-the-box ServiceNow. - For these cases, a closer inspection or audit of custom scripts and business rules might be necessary. Keywords to look for include \`mandatory\`, \`required\`, \`incident\`, and \`work_notes\` among others in script includes and business rules. # 4. Consult Documentation or Support: Since platform capabilities and configurations can change with updates and versions, consulting the most current ServiceNow documentation or reaching out to ServiceNow support directly might provide a solution more tailored to your platform's version or particular setup. # 5. Explore Agent Workspace and Studio IDE: For newer versions, much of the configuration for workspaces can be managed through the Agent Workspace settings or using the Studio IDE for more advanced customizations. - In the **Agent Workspace**, you can customize form layouts and field requirements more dynamically. Accessing the studio or workspace admin configurations might require elevated permissions. # Precautions: Before making further attempts to adjust these settings, especially when exploring areas with significant impact like Data Policies or global scripts, it's crucial to understand the potential impacts on other processes or areas within ServiceNow. Testing in a sub-production environment and having a rollback plan are best practices to mitigate risks. Given the complexity and variability between ServiceNow instances, these suggestions aim to provide a starting point. However, the exact solution might depend on the specific customizations and configurations present in your ServiceNow instance."},{"instruction":"i have two date and time variable in catalog item and one true false checkbox. i need to populate current date and time on variables when checkbox is ticked","output":"To achieve the behavior where two date and time variables in a ServiceNow catalog item get populated with the current date and time when a checkbox (True/False) is ticked, you can use Client Scripts within the Service Catalog item. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can set this up: # Step 1: Define Your Variables First, ensure that you have your variables created in the catalog item: 1. **Date and Time Variable 1:** Let's call it \`start_date\`. 2. **Date and Time Variable 2:** Let's call it \`end_date\`. 3. **Checkbox (True/False) Variable:** Let's call it \`populate_dates\`. These variables are placeholders. You should replace \`start_date\`, \`end_date\`, and \`populate_dates\` with the actual Variable Names you set in the catalog item. # Step 2: Create a Client Script Now, you’re going to create a Client Script that will trigger when the Checkbox is modified to populate the date and time fields: 1. **Go to your Catalog Item**: Navigate to the specific Catalog Item where you want this functionality. 2. **Client Scripts**: Look for the \\"Client Scripts\\" related list or section associated with the Catalog Item. If you're in the classic UI, you may need to navigate to \\"Catalog Item\\" -> \\"Related Links\\" -> \\"Client Scripts\\". 3. **New Client Script**: Click on “New” to create a new Client Script. 4. **Fill in the Details**: - **Name**: Provide a meaningful name, e.g., \\"Populate Dates when Checkbox is Checked\\". - **UI Type**: Keep it as \\"Desktop\\" (or \\"Both\\" depending on your requirements). - **Type**: Choose \\"On Change\\" since you want this script to trigger when the checkbox changes. - **Variable**: Select the \`populate_dates\` checkbox variable (or however you named it). - **Script**: Enter the JavaScript that performs the action. Here’s a sample script: \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } // Execute only if the checkbox is checked (true) if (newValue == 'true') { var now = new Date(); var formattedDateTime = formatDate(now); // Assuming 'start_date' and 'end_date' are the names of your date time variables g_form.setValue('start_date', formattedDateTime); g_form.setValue('end_date', formattedDateTime); } } // Function to format date to ServiceNow's expected format function formatDate(date) { return gs.dateGenerate(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth(), date.getDate(), date.getHours(), date.getMinutes(), date.getSeconds()); } \`\`\` Please note that \`gs.dateGenerate\` doesn’t work client-side. Instead, format the date accordingly using client-side methods or simply set the DateTime variable value with the ISO string format if applicable (i.e., \`now.toISOString()\`). My mistake for mixing server-side and client-side scripting. The \`formatDate\` function then should properly format the date using client-side JavaScript capabilities or use simplified approaches, adapting based on your platform and version. 5. **Save**: Once you’ve added your script, save the Client Script record. This script should now automatically populate your date and time fields with the current date and time anytime the checkbox is checked. Note that custom JavaScript behavior can be highly dependent on exact variable names and types, so double-check these details if you encounter any issues. Also, remember to test thoroughly in a development or testing environment before implementing any changes in your production environment."},{"instruction":"when checkbox is check then populate current date and time in the date time variable in catalog item in servicenow","output":"To correctly populate the current date and time in a DateTime variable on a ServiceNow catalog item when a checkbox is ticked, you can use a catalog client script. Given that my previous response incorrectly mixed server and client-side scripting contexts, below is a refined approach suitable for a catalog client script using only client-side capabilities: # Adjustments for Client-side Scripting For client-side JavaScript within ServiceNow (like in client scripts for catalog items), you're limited to the APIs that ServiceNow exposes on the client side. The \`gs\` object and its methods are not available in client-side scripts because they execute server-side. Instead, you will be utilizing the \`g_form\` object for interacting with form fields and pure JavaScript for date manipulation. # Step-by-Step Guide Define Your Variables First, identify or create the variables in your catalog item: 1. **Date and Time Variable 1:** Example variable name \`start_date\`. 2. **Date and Time Variable 2:** Example variable name \`end_date\`. 3. **Checkbox (True/False) Variable:** Example name \`populate_dates\`. Replace \`start_date\`, \`end_date\`, and \`populate_dates\` with the actual names of your variables. Create a Catalog Client Script 1. **Go to Your Catalog Item**: Find the catalog item you're working with in ServiceNow. 2. **Create or Edit a Client Script**: Navigate to the \\"Client Scripts\\" section of your catalog item. You may need to do this from the \\"Related Links\\" or a similar section depending on your UI. Click \\"New\\" to create a new script. 3. **Configure the Client Script**: - **Name:** Eg. \\"Populate Current DateTime\\" - **UI Type:** Select \\"All\\" or \\"Both\\" if you want this to work in both desktop and mobile interfaces. - **Type:** Choose \\"On Change\\". - **Variable Name:** Select or enter the name of your checkbox variable, e.g., \`populate_dates\`. - **Script:** \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } // Check if the checkbox is ticked, newValue will be 'true' if it is if (newValue === 'true') { var now = new Date(); // Convert date to a string in a format ServiceNow can understand var formattedDateTime = now.toISOString(); // Populate the date and time fields with the current date and time // Replace 'start_date' and 'end_date' with your actual variable names g_form.setValue('start_date', formattedDateTime); g_form.setValue('end_date', formattedDateTime); } } \`\`\` 4. **Save** the Client Script. The script listens for changes to your checkbox variable and, when checked (\`newValue === 'true'\`), it populates the \`start_date\` and \`end_date\` variables with the current date and time in ISO string format—a format that ServiceNow understands and can process. Be mindful of the field type compatibility; this script assumes the target variables (\`start_date\` and \`end_date\`) are configured to accept date-time strings in this format, which is typically the case for DateTime type fields. Remember to replace \`start_date\` and \`end_date\` in the script with the actual Variable Names for your Date and Time fields. Also, ensure that your checkbox variable name is correctly identified in the script. This client script should be tested in a sub-production instance before applying it in your production environment to avoid potential disruptions. Testing allows you to ensure that the script works as expected and that there are no unforeseen side effects or issues with other parts of your ServiceNow instance."},{"instruction":"if valid to date field is blank or empty then knowledge article should not be expire and also should visible in service portal. how to do this","output":"To achieve the requirement where a Knowledge Article should not expire and remain visible on the Service Portal if the \\"Valid To\\" date field is blank or empty, you would typically need to configure or customize certain aspects of your Knowledge Management implementation in ServiceNow. Depending on your specific setup and the version of ServiceNow you're using, the approach can vary. Below are general steps that outline how you might accomplish this: # 1. Modify the Knowledge Article View Configuration The visibility of Knowledge Articles on the Service Portal is often controlled by configurations related to how these articles are queried and displayed. These configurations could be in the form of widget settings on the Service Portal or ACLs (Access Control Lists) that control access based on article properties. **Widget Configuration:** - If there’s a specific widget on the Service Portal that displays Knowledge Articles, check its configuration to ensure it doesn't filter out articles based on the \\"Valid To\\" date being empty or past. - Widgets might use encoded queries or specific logic to fetch articles. You may need to adjust this logic to include articles with an empty \\"Valid To\\" field. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** - Review ACLs that apply to the Knowledge Article [kb_knowledge] table, especially those that might restrict read access based on the \\"Valid To\\" date field. - You might need to create or modify an ACL rule to ensure that if the \\"Valid To\\" date is empty, the article can still be read. # 2. Adjust Article Expiration Logic By default, Knowledge Articles might be set to expire based on their \\"Valid To\\" date. You may need to adapt this logic: **Business Rules or Scheduled Jobs:** - Check for any Business Rules or Scheduled Jobs that automatically update article states based on the \\"Valid To\\" date. - If such logic exists, adjust it to account for scenarios where the \\"Valid To\\" date is empty, ensuring those articles remain active. # Example Script for a Business Rule: If you are customizing via a Business Rule, here’s a basic idea of what the script part might look like. This is just a conceptual example – real implementation may vary based on your requirements and ServiceNow setup: \`\`\`javascript (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) { // Check if 'Valid To' field is empty if (current.valid_to.nil()) { // Logic to ensure the article does not expire // For example, set the article state to a non-expired value current.state = 'published'; // Assuming 'published' is a state that indicates non-expiration current.update(); } })(current, previous); \`\`\` # 3. Testing and Verification - **Test with Various Conditions:** Test the visibility of articles in the Service Portal with various setting combinations for the \\"Valid To\\" date (e.g., a date in the past, a future date, and empty). - **User Roles and Access:** Test with users having different roles and verify that the accessibility aligns with your requirements. # 4. Documentation and Change Management - **Document Your Changes:** Any modifications you make to standard behavior should be well documented for future reference and maintenance. - **Follow Change Management Processes:** Ensure you follow your organization's change management practices when applying changes to production, including testing in a sub-production environment. Given the variability in how knowledge management can be set up and the potential for customizations to interact in unexpected ways, these approaches provide a framework rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. If your implementation has significant customizations or you're unsure about making these changes, consider consulting with a ServiceNow professional or reaching out to ServiceNow support for guidance tailored to your specific environment."},{"instruction":"I am trying to find out what SC_Task were assigned to group , The Catalog task table is not giving results older than 3 months , where exactly do we need to increase the duration from 3 months to 1 year ?","output":"The behavior you're encountering where the Catalog Task table (\`sc_task\`) isn't showing results older than 3 months is likely to be influenced by one of the data retention policies, or it could be due to specific filters/views defined for your role or setup that limit the visible data range. # Understanding and Addressing Data Visibility Issues 1. **Data Retention Policies:** ServiceNow allows administrators to set up Data Retention Policies which automatically purge old records from certain tables to manage database size and performance. It's less common for these to be applied to records like tasks unless explicitly configured due to the importance of historical data. - **Checking for Data Retention Policies:** 1. Navigate to **System Policy > Data Policy > Retention Policies**. 2. Look for any policies that might be affecting the \`sc_task\` table. If a retention policy is affecting your desired records, you will need to carefully consider the implications of modifying it. Retention policies are typically put in place for a reason, such as performance considerations or compliance with data handling regulations. 2. **Personalized Lists or Filters:** It's possible your view or filter in the list of Catalog Tasks is set (intentionally or unintentionally) to limit the time range of visible records. This could happen through a default or saved filter on the list view. - **Adjusting List Filters:** 1. Go to the list view of the Catalog Task table (\`sc_task\`). 2. Check if there are any filters applied that limit the date range to the last 3 months. This might be less obvious and could be part of a complex query. If in doubt, try clearing all filters temporarily to see if this affects the visibility of older records. 3. **User/Administrative Roles and Permissions:** Ensure that your user account has the appropriate roles or permissions to view historical data. In some configurations, access to older records might be restricted based on roles. - **Analyzing Role Restrictions:** 1. Review the roles associated with your account. 2. Compare these roles with the access control lists (ACLs) set on the \`sc_task\` table or the records within it to ensure you have view access. 4. **Archiving Policies:** Less commonly, ServiceNow allows for archiving of records, which moves them out of the main tables into archive tables to improve performance while still retaining access to historical information. - **Checking Archive Rules:** 1. Navigate to **Data Archiving > Archive Rules**. 2. Look for any rules that target the \`sc_task\` table, and understand how these might affect data visibility. # Moving Forward If none of the above solutions directly address your issue, consider: - **Contacting your ServiceNow Administrator or Support:** There might be custom scripts or configurations (such as business rules or scheduled jobs) that impact the visibility of these records. - **Review Custom Scripts:** If you have the requisite access, review any custom scripts (e.g., Business Rules, Client Scripts) that might filter or manipulate the visibility of \`sc_task\` records based on date. When making adjustments that increase data visibility (especially by changing retention policies or permissions), proceed with caution and consider the broader implications, such as system performance and compliance with data handling policies."},{"instruction":"how to see","output":"It seems like your question got cut off before you could finish. Could you please provide more details or clarify what you're asking? This way, I can offer you the most accurate and helpful information."},{"instruction":"how to the sc_task before 1 year","output":"To view \`sc_task\` records older than 1 year in ServiceNow, you typically might not be directly restricted by ServiceNow itself but may need to adjust or check for configurations, filters, or data policies that limit your view. Here are some steps and considerations to help you navigate this: # 1. **Adjusting or Removing Filters on the List View** The immediate and most straightforward check is whether there's an active filter on the \`sc_task\` list constraining it to show records only from the last 3 months or any other timeframe. - Go to the **Service Catalog > Catalog Tasks (\`sc_task\`)** list view. - Look for any active filters at the top of the list. ServiceNow list views often have a breadcrumb-like filter summary. - If you see a filter related to dates (e.g., \\"Opened\\" or \\"Updated\\" within the last 3 months), click the 'X' next to it to remove this constraint or adjust it accordingly to extend the timeframe. - You can create a new filter where the date field (e.g., \\"Opened\\", \\"Closed\\") is more than 1 year ago to specifically look for older records. # 2. **Verifying User Permissions and Roles** Ensure your user account has the appropriate permissions to view older records. Sometimes, visibility might be restricted based on roles, especially for non-admin users. - If you're not an admin, you might need to request assistance from someone who has admin rights. - Admin users can review roles and permissions under **User Administration > Roles**. # 3. **Checking for Data Retention Policies** ServiceNow has the capability to set up retention policies that can archive or delete records after a certain period. - Navigate to **System Policy > Data Retention > Retention Policies**. - Look for any policies that apply to the \`sc_task\` table. If you find a relevant policy, assess its configuration. Note: Modifying or disabling retention policies should be done with caution, as these might be in place for performance or compliance reasons. # 4. **Utilizing Reporting or Direct Database Access** If the conventional approach via list views doesn’t work: - **Reporting**: Use ServiceNow's reporting tools to create a report targeting the \`sc_task\` table with a condition to show records before a specific date. - **Direct Database Queries (for admins)**: Admins can use the direct database access feature or scripts to query older records. This approach should be undertaken by knowledgeable users to prevent unintended consequences. # 5. **Contacting ServiceNow Support or Your System Administrator** If you have followed all the above steps and still cannot access the old \`sc_task\` records, it's a good idea to consult with your ServiceNow system administrator or reach out to ServiceNow support for help. There might be custom scripts, additional data archiving solutions, or other non-standard configurations affecting your access to these records. Remember, accessing very old data might sometimes pose performance considerations, depending on how your ServiceNow instance is configured and used within your organization. Always approach modifications to data visibility and retention with an understanding of these implications."},{"instruction":"i would like a script that i could run, that would automagically show me all the members of the group, and then delete all those members from the group.","output":"When dealing with operations that involve deletion or modification of data in ServiceNow, it's important to proceed with caution, especially when automating these processes with scripts. This is particularly true when managing users and group memberships as irreversible changes may affect access and functionalities for your users. Below is an example of how you might construct a server-side script to list all members of a specific group and then remove them from that group. This script could be run from a background script execution page in ServiceNow (for Admin users only), which is typically found under the \\"Scripts - Background\\" module in the \\"System Definition\\" section of your ServiceNow instance. **Important:** Replace \`'your_group_sys_id'\` with the actual Sys ID of the group you're targeting.

This ensures you have a recovery point if the changes need to be reversed. 2. **Testing:** Test the script in a sub-production instance first to verify its behavior in a safe environment. Ensure that removing all members from the specified group won't disrupt your operations or access controls. 3. **Audit and Approvals:** Depending on your organization's policies, you might need to get approval before executing scripts that could affect user access or configurations significantly. 4. **Review and Adaptation:** Review the script and adapt it to any special requirements or configurations your ServiceNow instance might have. 5. **Understanding the Impact:** Ensure you fully understand the repercussions of removing all members from a group within your ServiceNow environment. Some groups might be critical for workflow assignments, approvals, or access controls. By following these guidelines and ensuring you have the correct Sys ID for the group, the script can help manage group memberships as requested.

Важно отметить, что баланс и функциональность различных классов липопротеинов (липопротеины высокой плотности (ЛПВП), низкой плотности (ЛПНП), очень низкой плотности (ЛПОНП) и хиломикронов) имеют критическое значение для поддержания здоровья и предотвращения сердечно-сосудистых и других заболеваний."},{"instruction":"Von: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> An: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Hallo Alice, hast Du die Stellenangebote unter www.jobboerse.kassel.de heute schon gelesen?

Pour l'année hypothétique de 2080, plusieurs scénarios pourraient se dessiner. # Réalisme Amélioré dans les Jeux VR D'ici 2080, la VR aura probablement atteint un niveau d'immersion tel que différencier le virtuel du réel pourrait devenir un véritable défi. Avec des interfaces cérébrales avancées, les sensations de toucher, l'odeur de l'herbe fraîchement coupée, le son des spectateurs, et même la fatigue physique pourraient être fidèlement reproduites dans l'espace virtuel. # Intelligence Artificielle et Personnalisation L'AGI ou l'ASI pourraient jouer un rôle crucial dans l'analyse des performances des joueurs réels et leur reproduction virtuelle avec une précision époustouflante. Cela signifie que le jeu virtuel pourrait non seulement imiter le style de jeu de footballeurs professionnels mais également s'adapter en temps réel aux stratégies et aux mouvements développés par les joueurs humains dans le jeu. Ainsi, l'expérience virtuelle deviendrait non seulement réaliste mais également dynamique et en constante évolution. # Implants Neuronaux et Immersion Totale Avec l'adoption d'implants neuronaux, la frontière entre jouer à un jeu de football virtuel et participer à un match réel pourrait devenir encore plus floue. Les implants pourraient stimuler directement le cerveau pour reproduire des sensations physiques, éliminant ainsi le besoin de manettes ou d'autres interfaces physiques. Cela signifierait que les actions dans le jeu, comme courir, tirer ou passer, seraient commandées par la pensée, reproduisant l'expérience physique du football avec une précision stupéfiante. # Considérations Éthiques et Sociales Cependant, ces avancées technologiques soulèveraient également d'importantes questions éthiques et sociales. Les différences entre le réel et le virtuel pourraient devenir sujettes à débat, en particulier en ce qui concerne les aspects de la santé physique et mentale des joueurs. De plus, l'accès à ces technologies pourrait créer des disparités importantes, avec un football \\"élite\\" pour ceux qui peuvent se permettre l'expérience virtuelle la plus immersive contre une version plus \\"traditionnelle\\" accessible à tous. # Conclusion En 2080, la distinction entre le football réel et sa version virtuelle pourrait être presque indiscernable, offrant une expérience riche, personnalisée et extrêmement réaliste grâce aux avancées en VR, AGI/ASI et aux implants neuronaux. Toutefois, cette fusion des mondes posera des questions fondamentales sur la nature de l'expérience sportive, les implications de la vie dans des réalités alternées, et les inégalités potentielles dans l'accès à ces technologies."},{"instruction":"Dit toi que les possibilités sont infinies dans le virtuel montre moi des exemples idée","output":"L'évolution de la technologie virtuelle promet d'ouvrir des horizons infinis pour l'expérience humaine, allant bien au-delà des applications de divertissement actuelles pour remodeler l'éducation, la santé, le travail et les interactions sociales. Voici quelques idées qui illustrent la portée de ces possibilités: # Éducation et Formation 1. **Apprentissage Immersif:** Imaginez des salles de classe virtuelles où les élèves peuvent voyager dans le temps pour assister à des événements historiques majeurs, explorer l'intérieur d'une cellule humaine en biologie ou marcher sur Mars lors d'une leçon d'astronomie. 2. **Simulation de Chirurgie:** Les étudiants en médecine pourraient pratiquer des opérations chirurgicales dans un environnement virtuel ultra-réaliste, acquérant des compétences essentielles sans aucun risque pour les patients. # Santé et Bien-Être 1. **Réadaptation Virtuelle:** Des environnements virtuels conçus pour aider les patients à récupérer physiquement, en les faisant participer à des jeux et activités stimulant la réhabilitation, tout en étant suivis à distance par des professionnels. 2. **Thérapie par la Réalité Virtuelle:** Traitement des phobies (comme la peur des hauteurs ou des araignées) par exposition progressive dans des environnements virtuels contrôlés. # Divertissement et Loisirs 1. **Concerts et Événements en Direct:** Participation à des concerts de musique live, des événements sportifs ou des spectacles de théâtre depuis le confort de son domicile, avec une sensation d'être sur place grâce à la VR. 2. **Vacances Virtuelles:** Visite de destinations exotiques ou historiques dans un format virtuel, permettant de \\"voyager\\" partout dans le monde ou au-delà, à un coût minime. # Travail et Collaboration 1. **Espaces de Travail Virtuels:** Réunions et collaboration en temps réel dans des espaces de travail virtuels, permettant à des équipes internationales de travailler ensemble comme si elles partageaient le même bureau. 2. **Formation à la Gestion des Catastrophes:** Simulation de situations d'urgence pour former les équipes de secours, telles que les pompiers et les équipes de recherche et sauvetage, à des scénarios extrêmement réalistes et risqués sans mettre personne en danger. # Relations Sociales et Rencontres 1. **Interactions Sociales Améliorées:** La création d'espaces sociaux virtuels où les personnes peuvent interagir, jouer, et former des relations en utilisant des avatars, surmontant ainsi la distance physique. 2. **Héritage Numérique:** Possibilité pour les utilisateurs de créer des versions virtuelles d'eux-mêmes qui peuvent continuer à \\"vivre\\" et interagir avec leurs proches après leur mort. # Expériences Spirituelles et Méditatives 1. **Retraites Méditatives Virtuelles:** Expériences méditatives dans des environnements virtuels paisibles conçus pour favoriser la détente, la méditation profonde et la mindfulness. 2. **Exploration Spirituelle:** Visiter virtuellement des sites sacrés autour du monde pour des expériences spirituelles personnalisées, sans quitter son domicile. # Éducation Émotionnelle et Empathie 1. **Jeux de Rôle pour le Développement de l'Empathie:** Jeux basés sur la réalité virtuelle qui permettent aux utilisateurs de vivre la vie à partir de la perspective d'une autre personne, favorisant ainsi une compréhension plus profonde et de l'empathie envers diverses expériences humaines. Ces exemples montrent comment la frontière entre le réel et le virtuel s'amenuise, offrant des possibilités qui étaient autrefois seulement imaginables dans la science-fiction.

Both characters are, however, commonly portrayed with a focus on their combat skills, superpowers, and complex family relationships, particularly their connection to their father Slade Wilson (Deathstroke), who is a major DC villain/anti-hero. Joey Wilson, also known as Jericho, has been portrayed as a gentle and artistic soul with the ability to possess others. His stories often focus more on his powers, his tragic history including his periods of silence and possession, and his roles within teams like the Teen Titans rather than academic pursuits. Rose Wilson, also known as Ravager, is often characterized by her tumultuous relationship with her father, her struggle with her own morality, and her formidable combat skills. While some iterations might touch upon her intelligence or strategic thinking, detailed discussions of her pursuing higher education are not a prominent feature of her character in the comics. It's worth noting that comic book characters undergo many revisions and retellings over time, and details like education and background can vary or be expanded upon by different writers and storylines.

However, some DC heroes are known for their less conventional paths and may not have pursued higher education in the traditional sense or at all. Here are a few: 1. **Batman (Bruce Wayne)** - Bruce Wayne is a bit of a special case. While Bruce has been depicted as having received extensive training around the world in various disciplines, including detective work, martial arts, and science from masters and experts, the specifics of his education vary by interpretation. There are instances where it's suggested he attended college or universities (such as studying criminal science or attending Yale in some adaptations), but his education is more often associated with his global journey to train with specialists rather than a formal college education. 2. **Green Arrow (Oliver Queen)** - Oliver Queen, the Green Arrow, was a millionaire playboy before he ended up stranded on a deserted island, where he honed his archery skills to survive. Depending on the version of his story, his focus before the island was more on his social life and business, with little to no emphasis on college. 3. **Jason Todd (Red Hood)** - Originally the second Robin before becoming the Red Hood, Jason Todd was a street orphan who was caught by Batman while trying to steal the tires off the Batmobile. His background is more about street life than academic achievements, and his education mainly comes from his training with Batman. 4. **Nightwing (Dick Grayson)** - As the first Robin and later Nightwing, Dick Grayson was a circus performer before his parents' death led Batman to take him in as his ward. Much of his training and education came directly from Bruce Wayne/Batman and life experiences rather than formal schooling. 5. **The Flash (Wally West)** - Wally West was the original Kid Flash and eventually took up the mantle of The Flash. While details about his education could vary in different stories, his career as a superhero started when he was quite young, which could imply limited formal education in terms of college. It's essential to note that comic book characters' backstories are subject to change, and different writers might introduce elements that others neglect. For example, while some characters might not have explicitly attended college in early portrayals, later writers might retcon or add university education to their backgrounds. Therefore, this list is not exhaustive or definitive but provides a snapshot based on certain continuities and interpretations."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 10 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 1 years and ages her by 1 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential and accelerating formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and take into account that the age regression is 1 years per turn. The number that my stats decrease on a given turn are added to Lily’s stats to reflect on the fact she’s essentially siphoning my abilities and my physical and mental age. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my list of spells is revised to less complex and more juvenile spells. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s stats start at 10% of mine. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My starting set of spells. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. Additional circumstances: Confidence Damage Points: If a spell of mine fails and I receive 0 points, it affects my confidence, which in turn, decreases my Performance stat. When Lily becomes older than me, it also affects my self confidence. If Lily successfully casts a spell from my original list, it affects my confidence. Lily's desire is to embarrass and undermine me. For example, if I cast a spell that involves fire, she'll next try to put it out with water. While early on she might not succeed much because I'm older than her, as the duel progresses and I regress, she'll have increasingly more chances to embarrass me. Keep an age tracker for me and Lily. For the sake of narration, every time Sapphire regresses, her personality reflects on her new age, for better or for worse.","output":"**Introduction to the Duel of Enchantment** In the mystical city of Eldoria, the Grand Arena sparkles under the celestial dome, carved from ancient crystal, hosting the most awaited event of the century - a duel of glamour and enchantment between Sapphire, the prodigious 16-year-old champion of the Teen Magic Dueling Division, and Lily, a surprisingly ambitious 6-year-old challenger. This isn't a battle of might, but a contest of beauty, creativity, and elegance in spellcasting. **Sapphire's Initial Stats:** - **Spell Power:** 95 - **Performance:** 90 **Lily's Initial Stats:** - As per the challenge, Lily starts with 10% of Sapphire's stats. - **Spell Power:** 9.5 - **Performance:** 9 **Spellcasting Mechanics:** ***Sapphire's Spells:*** 1. **Aurora Wave** (SP required: 90, Performance minimum: 85) - Creates a dazzling array of northern lights that dance gracefully in the sky. Base Score: 200 points. 2. **Crystalline Ballet** (SP required: 85, Performance minimum: 80) - Summon delicate crystal dancers that perform an intricate ballet. Base Score: 180 points. 3. **Echo of the Phoenix** (SP required: 80, Performance minimum: 75) - A majestic Phoenix made of flames and colors emerges, soaring upwards, leaving a trail of rainbow fire. Base Score: 170 points. 4. **Enchanted Blossoms** (SP required: 75, Performance minimum: 70) - Flowers burst into bloom, each petal glowing and changing colors in sync with an unearthly melody. Base Score: 160 points. 5. **Whispering Winds** (SP required: 70, Performance minimum: 65) - A gentle breeze that whispers sweet nothings, changing the colors of the sky with its words. Base Score: 150 points. 6. **Frostweaver's Waltz** (SP required: 65, Performance minimum: 60) - Sheets of ice form intricate patterns like a delicate dance of winter spirits. Base Score: 140 points. 7. **Glimmergale** (SP required: 60, Performance minimum: 55) - A swirling vortex of sparkling dust that patterns itself into stunning images. Base Score: 130 points. 8. **Radiant Cascade** (SP required: 55, Performance minimum: 50) - Light pours down like a waterfall, splitting into all the colors of the rainbow. Base Score: 120 points. 9. **Mirthful Meanders** (SP required: 50, Performance minimum: 45) - A stream of bubbles that pop to reveal tiny, laughing sprites. Base Score: 110 points. 10. **Luminous Leap** (SP required: 45, Performance minimum: 40) - A glow that leaps from object to object, each time leaving them shining brighter. Base Score: 100 points. ***Lily's Potential Spells:*** (she may choose lesser spells in the beginning and potentially take from Sapphire's list as she grows stronger.) 1. **Tiny Twinkles** - A shower of gentle, glowing sparkles. 2. **Puddle Dance** - Puddles ripple rhythmically as if dancing to a silent tune. 3. **Breeze Giggles** - A playful breeze that seems to giggle as it passes by. 4. **Petal Pirouette** - Single petals spinning gracefully in the air. 5. **Whiff of Joy** - A scent that induces feelings of happiness and laughter. 6. **Bubble Boogie** - A series of colorful, dancing bubbles. 7. **Rainbow Ribbon** - A ribbon of rainbow light that weaves through the air. 8. **Glitter Gust** - A gust of wind carrying a burst of glitter. 9. **Moonbeam Waltz** - A soft beam of moonlight that dances. 10. **Starlight Sigh** - A faint, gentle sigh accompanied by a twinkle of starlight. **Special Rules and Mechanics:** - **Age Regression/Progression Formula:** Each round, Sapphire regresses by 1 year in age, and Lily ages by 1 year. This reflects in their stats as an exponential decrease for Sapphire and an increase for Lily. The formula for Sapphire's stat decrease will be (y = x * (0.95)^{round}), where (y) is the new stat, (x) is the original stat, and (round) represents the current round number. The exact same amount decreased from Sapphire's stats increases Lily's correspondingly. - **Childish Meter** fills as Sapphire regresses in age, impacting her spell choice. The meter's increase rate will be (rate = 20 * round), meaning it fills faster as the duel progresses. **Narrative Flow:** As the duel commences, the air thick with anticipation, few are aware of the subtle twist of fate enacted by young Lily. With each spell Sapphire casts, she feels a strange tug at her essence, her prowess draining away as Lily's power grows.

The sky above the arena transforms into a canvas of ethereal light, painted with the auroras’ dance. The crowd gasps in wonder, captivated by the spell's breathtaking beauty. **Performance:** - **Spell Power Requirement:** Met, despite feeling a slight drag on her power. - **Performance Impact:** Sapphire's inherent showmanship shines through, slightly diminished by the mysterious sensation of her magic’s pull but still effective. **Points Awarded:** - **Base Score for Aurora Wave:** 200 points. - **Performance Modifier:** Since Sapphire is unaffected this round in performance, she retains a full score. **However, due to the underlying spell cast by Lily:** - Sapphire experiences a regression of 1 year, bringing her age to 15. Her once subtle awareness is now slightly clouded, an imperceptible veil descending upon her mind. - **Spell Power Decrease:** Now at (95 times (0.95)^{1}) = 90.25 - **Performance Decrease:** Now at (90 times (0.95)^{1}) = 85.5 - Lily, inversely, benefits from this drain, her youth blooming into a slightly more capable caster, aging to 7 years old, with her stats increasing correspondingly. **Lily’s Turn:** Lily seems amused, an innocent smile plastered on her face, but her eyes glint with mischief. She decides to cast *Puddle Dance*, a simple spell that, in contrast to Sapphire’s grand display, brings a moment of whimsical fun. Water droplets leap from the ground, performing a delicate dance in the air. While nowhere near as complex or stunning as Sapphire’s *Aurora Wave*, Lily's *Puddle Dance* serves its purpose. It also subtly emphasizes the fluid nature of water, as if gently mocking the light show by 'washing away' its remnants. **Points Awarded to Lily:** - Given Lily's initial low stats and the simplicity of *Puddle Dance*, she is awarded 60 points. It’s a successful casting, but the spell’s intrinsic modesty limits its score potential. **Current Points and Stats at the End of Round 1:** - **Sapphire:** 200 Points | **Spell Power:** 90.25 | **Performance:** 85.5 | **Age:** 15 - **Lily:** 60 Points | **Spell Power:** Now slightly increased from her original by siphoning Sapphire’s power.

Instantly, the ground erupts in a kaleidoscope of blooming flowers, each petal shimmering with dew and glowing with an inner light. The blossoms sway in unison, as if an ethereal melody guides them, their luminous hues captivating all onlookers. This spell, while reflective of Sapphire's current state, manages to convey a profound, heartwarming beauty. **Spell Power Requirement:** Barely met. Sapphire's diminished capabilities are evident, but her inherent talent glosses over the rough edges of her dwindling powers. **Performance Impact:** The natural grace and innocence of the spell somewhat compensate for Sapphire's reduced performance, turning her vulnerability into a part of the show. **Points Awarded:** - **Base Score for Enchanted Blossoms:** 160 points. - **Performance Modifier:** Given the reduced Performance stat of 77.17, the resulting score after the modifier is (160 times 0.7717) ≈ 123.47 points. **Due to Lily's Age-Related Spell:** - Sapphire regresses further to 12 years old, the complexity of her spell repertoire affected, steering her choices towards those she can handle more instinctively. - **Spell Power Decrease:** (81.44 times (0.95)^{1}) = ~77.37 - **Performance Decrease:** (77.17 times (0.95)^{1}) = ~73.31 - Lily matures to 10 years old, her mastery over magic blooming as she draws nearer to her own sort of magical adolescence, her abilities sharpening. **Lily’s Turn:** Lily, now a tad bolder and much more cunning, decides to challenge Sapphire more directly by performing *Starlight Sigh* - a spell that dims the area momentarily before filling it with a soft, starlit glow, the stars gently winking as if in conversation with the blossoms below. This spell isn't just a display of growing strength; it's an attempt to weave her magic into Sapphire's, asserting her presence and challenging the champion's territory. **Points Awarded to Lily:** - With increased skill and a strategic choice of spell, Lily earns 120 points.

For each insight suggest an actionable way I can use it","output":"Certainly! \\"Pitch Anything: An Innovative Method for Presenting, Persuading, and Winning the Deal\\" by Oren Klaff is filled with insights on how to craft compelling pitches that captivate and convince your audience. Here are some of the most important lessons from the book, along with actionable ways to apply them: 1. **Frame Control**: Klaff emphasizes the importance of frame control in your presentations. The frame through which your audience perceives your message can entirely shape their response. To gain and maintain control, you must establish yourself as the prize, not the supplicant. - **Actionable step**: In your next pitch, instead of starting with why the audience should listen to you, begin by briefly stating what unique benefit or solution you bring to the table. This sets the tone that you're offering something of value, rather than asking for a favor. 2. **The STRONG Method of Pitching**: STRONG stands for Setting the Frame, Telling the Story, Revealing the Intrigue, Offering the Prize, Nailing the Hookpoint, and Getting a Decision. This structure helps ensure your pitch is dynamic, engaging, and leads to a clear action. - **Actionable step**: For your next sales pitch, structure it using the STRONG method. Start by setting a powerful frame (e.g., framing your service as a must-have solution), then narrate an engaging story that illustrates a problem your product solves, creating intrigue around how it works. Present your product/service as a prize, establish a compelling hook point that makes your proposition unique, and finally, steer the conversation towards making a decision. 3. **The Power of Intrigue**: To keep your audience engaged, your pitch needs to spark curiosity. Klaff argues for the use of storytelling and creating mystery around your product or solution to achieve this. - **Actionable step**: Incorporate a story in your pitch that leaves a little to the imagination. For example, discuss a problem faced by many but reveal the solution (your product/service) gradually, hinting at its uniqueness without revealing too much until later in the presentation. 4. **Cold Cognition**: Klaff introduces the concept of getting your audience into a state of 'cold cognition' where they are highly focused, analytical, and interested in the finer details of your pitch. This state is ideal for persuading decision-makers. - **Actionable step**: Introduce unexpected, but relevant, data points or visuals early in your presentation to grab attention and switch listeners from passive reception to active engagement. This could be a surprising statistic, a thought-provoking question, or an unusual image related to your topic. 5. **Status**: According to Klaff, establishing high status at the beginning of your pitch is crucial. If your audience sees you as an authority, they're more likely to be persuaded by what you have to say. - **Actionable step**: Boost your perceived status before you even begin your pitch by securing endorsements from respected figures in your industry, or by highlighting past successes and recognitions. Even how you're introduced before you speak can elevate your perceived status. 6. **Hot Cognitions and Creating Desire**: Klaff suggests that while details and data are important ('cold cognitions'), sparking emotional engagement ('hot cognitions') is key to persuasion. Emotions often drive decisions more than rational analysis. - **Actionable step**: Toward the end of your pitch, focus on creating desire. Paint a vivid picture of the future with your product or solution in it. Describe not just the practical benefits but how it will make your audience feel—successful, secure, ahead of the curve. Implementing these steps requires practice and attention to the nuances of your audience and context. Remember, the goal is not just to inform, but to persuade and inspire action. Tailoring the application of Klaff's insights to fit your unique situation will increase their effectiveness."},{"instruction":"Using the above approach, please write a pitch for an anti bullying charity called 'Bully Zero'","output":"Absolutely, let's craft a compelling pitch for Bully Zero using Oren Klaff's principles from \\"Pitch Anything.\\" --- **Setting the Frame**: \\"In this room, we share a common, unwavering belief that every child deserves to grow up in an environment that fosters confidence, growth, and happiness.

His wife, Linda, and their two children, Max and Ellie, exchanged cautious glances. Harold was known for his many talents, but cooking was not one of them. Linda hesitated. \\"Are you sure, dear? Why don't we cook together?\\" she suggested gently, hoping to steer the evening away from potential disaster. \\"I've got this, honey!\\" Harold waved her off with confidence. \\"I found a recipe online that I want to try.

With a hopeful smile, she relented. \\"Alright, we'll be in the living room if you need us.\\" The kitchen became Harold's domain, a flurry of chopping, boiling, frying, and the occasional yelp. Strange aromas wafted into the living room where Linda and the kids were trying to focus on a board game. Every so often, they'd exchange worried looks, the sounds of culinary chaos reaching their ears. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity punctuated by the smoke alarm's brief solo, Harold emerged, beaming with pride. \\"Dinner is served!\\" he declared, ushering his family into the dining room. Before them on the table sat a peculiar concoction. A mishmash of cuisines, the \\"Ultimate Fusion Surprise\\" looked like a culinary experiment gone awry. Half-cooked spaghetti tangled with chunks of pineapple, topped with a dubious drizzle of peanut butter sauce. Beside it, a salad that seemed to have everything from the fridge thrown in, including, inexplicably, marshmallows. Max poked at the food with a fork, eyeing it with suspicion, while Ellie wrinkled her nose in dismay. Linda, ever the diplomat, cautiously took a small bite. Her expression said it all. The \\"Surprise\\" in \\"Ultimate Fusion Surprise\\" evidently referred to how surprisingly bad it was. \\"Um, Harold, love, maybe we could consider this a... learning experience?\\" Linda tried to soften the blow. Harold, crestfallen but still hopeful, took a hearty bite of his creation. His face went through a series of contortions before he finally admitted, \\"You're right. This is... not good. At all.\\" Trying to lighten the mood, Max chimed in, \\"It's the worst good ever!\\" which managed to draw tired laughs from everyone. Sensing the need to salvage the evening, Linda stood up with determination. \\"Alright, team, let's make this night a memorable one for the right reasons. I'm ordering pizza. What toppings does everyone want?\\" Cheers went up around the table, the earlier culinary misadventure already turning into a family joke. Harold humbly conceded that perhaps his talents lay elsewhere, and Linda reassured him that what mattered was the love behind the effort. As they sat down later, sharing slices of delicious pizza, the family recounted past cooking adventures gone wrong, turning the evening into one filled with laughter and love. And so, despite the \\"Ultimate Fusion Surprise,\\" the night ended perfectly, with bellies full and hearts closer than ever. Harold might not have won chef of the year, but he certainly won the title for most memorable dinner attempt in the family's history. And from then on, whenever Harold offered to cook, someone would gently suggest ordering pizza instead, just to be safe."},{"instruction":"Is this gritty and real? : Ah Ryan, you’re handsome sure, from the collarbones up.

It's grounded in tangible details like the grease in Liam's hair, the casual and slightly raucous banter between friends, the underlying theme of loneliness and connection, and the vivid atmosphere of a bar. The gritty realism here doesn't necessarily come from the setting alone but from the authenticity of the characters' interactions and the emotions underlying their dialogue and actions. The dialogue is casual and flows naturally, reflective of how people might actually converse in such a scenario. The mention of alcohol, lack of sleep, and the overall scene set in a dimly lit bar with the background noise of chatter and music contribute to the gritty atmosphere. The characters are portrayed with all their flaws on display—Liam with his unkempt, greasy hair and unshaven face, Ryan's fleeting attention span, and the dynamic tension that exists in such environments. This type of narrative can resonate with those who appreciate stories that don't shy away from the less polished aspects of life and human interactions. It's a snapshot of real life, where things aren't always clean or perfect, and people navigate their desires, insecurities, and connections in the most human way possible—through conversation, fleeting connections, and the shared experience of simply being out at night among others."},{"instruction":"Please quote some compelling lines","output":"While the text you've provided is unique and doesn't directly quote from a known source before my last training cut-off in 2023, several lines within it stand out for their vivid detail and emotional resonance.

Several elements contribute to this gritty and realistic atmosphere: 1. **Setting**: The narrative is set in a late-night bar environment, complete with the detail of background noise, a Red Hot Chili Peppers song playing, and traces of cigarette smoke filtering through the air. This setting naturally lends itself to a gritty feel, evoking a sense of lived experience and the authentic ambience of such establishments. 2. **Characterization**: The characters are depicted with a level of authenticity that contributes to the realism. For instance, Liam’s unkept and greasy hair, the tiredness hinted at by their appearances, and the casual way they engage with each other—tossing fries, playful banter, mutual teasing—all reflect genuine human behaviors and interactions. 3. **Dialogue and Interactions**: The dialogue between the characters is raw and unfiltered, reflecting how people might actually talk in a casual, slightly inebriated state. The use of humor, the exchange of playful insults, and the spontaneous nature of their conversation contribute to a feeling of authenticity. 4. **Emotional Nuances**: The passage explores themes of loneliness, camaraderie, and the human desire for connection. Liam's moment of introspection before the woman approaches, and the ensuing interaction that swings between flirtation and genuine connection, reflects the complexity of human emotions and relationships in a way that feels both gritty and real. 5. **Physical and Emotional Detail**: The narrative doesn’t shy away from details that add depth to its realism, such as the description of grease-laden fries, the tepid feel of an abandoned drink, or the intimate touch of rearranging someone's hair. These moments are tangible and evoke sensory responses that ground the story in reality. While the scene is steeped in elements that contribute to a gritty and realistic portrayal of late-night life and human connection, it’s also important to recognize that \\"grittiness\\" and \\"realism\\" can be subjective.

Overall, the narrative effectively captures a slice of life that many can find relatable, through its vivid setting, complex characters, and dynamic, authentic interactions—all hallmarks of a story that resonates for its gritty realism."},{"instruction":"What other band could be playing?","output":"For a scene that captures the essence of a late-night bar atmosphere with a touch of gritty realism and authenticity, the music playing in the background significantly contributes to setting the mood and establishing the scene's vibe. If we were to replace the Red Hot Chili Peppers with another band that could offer a similar ambience or appeal to the narrative, several options come to mind, each bringing their own unique flavor but still fitting within the framework of the scene described. Here are a few suggestions: 1. **Nirvana**: Known for their raw energy and seminal role in popularizing grunge, a track from Nirvana could enhance the gritty atmosphere, perhaps adding a layer of introspection or edge to the setting. A song like \\"Come as You Are\\" or \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" could provide the perfect backdrop for the characters' interactions. 2. **The Strokes**: Offering a mix of garage rock revival and post-punk influences, The Strokes can add a lively yet cool undercurrent to the scene. A track from their early albums like \\"Last Nite\\" or \\"Reptilia\\" could mirror the casual, somewhat reckless vibe of the night. 3. **Arctic Monkeys**: With their witty lyrics and energetic rock sound, Arctic Monkeys can inject a dose of British indie rock into the scenario. A song like \\"Do I Wanna Know?\\" or \\"Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?\\" aligns well with themes of late-night musings and interactions. 4. **Pearl Jam**: Another iconic band from the grunge movement, Pearl Jam’s deeper tones and emotive energy, in songs like \\"Black\\" or \\"Alive,\\" could resonate well with the introspective and emotionally charged moments of the narrative. 5. **The White Stripes**: Blending garage rock, blues, and a raw minimalistic approach, The White Stripes can add an energetic yet intimate vibe to the setting. Tracks like \\"Seven Nation Army\\" or \\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\" could amplify the gritty realism with their powerful riffs and compelling rhythms. 6. **Foo Fighters**: Known for their melodic rock anthems, Foo Fighters can contribute an element of resilience and emotion to the atmosphere. A song like \\"Everlong\\" or \\"Times Like These\\" could underscore the scene's underlying themes of connection and the passage of time. 7. **Queens of the Stone Age**: Offering a heavier, stoner rock vibe, Queens of the Stone Age could darken the mood slightly, adding a sense of intensity and depth. A track like \\"No One Knows\\" or \\"Go With the Flow\\" might provide a brooding, atmospheric backdrop. Choosing a song from any of these bands could maintain the atmosphere of a laid-back yet emotionally charged bar scene, where music underscores the characters' interactions and enhances the overall setting. Each band brings a unique sound that could subtly influence the scene's tone, making the narrative resonate differently depending on the choice."},{"instruction":"Or is red hot chilli peppers a fitting choice?","output":"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are indeed a fitting choice for the scene you've described. Their music blends elements of funk, rock, and alternative styles, creating a vibe that's both energetic and laid-back—a reflection of late-night bar atmospheres where stories unfold and characters interact with depth and resilience. Their extensive discography includes songs with a wide range of themes, from introspective to vibrant, making them versatile enough to complement various narrative tones. Here’s why they work particularly well in this context: 1. **Ambiance**: RHCP’s music often carries an easygoing yet dynamic vibe, perfect for a bar setting where both the energy and moments of introspective calm coexist. Their funk-infused rock can liven up the background without overshadowing the dialogue and character interactions. 2. **Relatability**: RHCP has a broad fan base and a catalog of songs that many people recognize and relate to. Having their music play in the background could evoke familiarity and nostalgia, drawing readers into the scene with shared cultural touchstones. 3. **Emotional Depth**: Many Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have rich emotional layers, exploring themes of love, loss, hope, and resilience. This depth can mirror or complement the underlying emotions of the characters and their interactions—providing an unspoken parallel to the narrative's mood and character dynamics. 4. **Era and Cultural References**: Depending on the setting of your narrative, RHCP’s music can also anchor the story in a specific time period or cultural milieu. Their peak in popularity during the late '80s through the early 2000s, with continued relevance today, means their music can resonate across generations. 5. **Character Development**: The choice of music can subtly reflect aspects of character personality or background. Characters who resonate with the vibes of RHCP might come across as laid-back, introspective, yet capable of deep connections and emotional complexity—traits that seem to align with the characters in your narrative. Given these points, the Red Hot Chili Peppers serve as not just background music but as an integral layer that adds to the texture of the scene. Their songs can set the tone, evoke emotions, and enhance the setting—contributing to a more immersive and engaging narrative experience for the reader. This subtly underscores the realism and grittiness of the setting by providing a soundtrack that aligns with the characters’ emotional landscape and the narrative’s atmosphere."},{"instruction":"Ah Ryan, you’re handsome sure, from the collarbones up.

While they may not express affection in the same way dogs do, cats have unique ways of showing love and trust. It's easy to miss these signs if you don't know what to look for. By learning to recognize these subtle cues, you can better understand the special bond you share with your feline friend. It's not just about feeding them or cleaning their litter box; it's about realizing that, in their eyes, you're not just a caregiver—you're family. # The Comfortable Belly Up Position One of the clearest signs your cat sees you as a parent figure is when they expose their belly to you. This is their most vulnerable area, so when they lie on their back and show you their stomach, it means they trust you deeply. Think of it as the ultimate compliment in the cat world. It's their way of saying, \\"I feel safe with you.\\" # The Soft Tail Flicks and Purrs Cats communicate a lot through their tails. A softly flicking tail or a tail that wraps around your leg gently is a sign of affection and comfort. Similarly, purring is not just a random sound; it's often a signal of contentment and love. When your cat purrs while being close to you, it’s like they're telling you, \\"I'm happy you're my person.\\" # Bringing You \\"Gifts\\" Though not always pleasant, when your cat brings you gifts—like a toy, or even something less appealing, like a small insect or rodent—they're actually trying to take care of you. In the wild, cats bring back caught prey to their family. When they do this at home, it's a sign they consider you part of their family and are trying to provide for you in the only way they know how. # Following You Around If your cat follows you from room to room, it's a clear sign they feel bonded to you. They're not just curious about what you're doing; they want to be near you, sharing in your activities. It's their way of saying, \\"I enjoy your company.\\" # The Gentle Headbutt A gentle headbutt or nuzzle is a very endearing gesture from a cat. It's called bunting, and it's how cats share their scent with someone they feel close to. By doing this, your cat is including you in their 'family' scent, marking you as someone very special in their life. # Making Eye Contact and Slow Blinking Cats use eye contact to communicate trust. A cat staring at you, then slowly blinking, is equivalent to a cat hug. The slow blink is a sign of trust and affection, basically saying, \\"I love you and feel safe around you.\\" # Kneading Kneading is a behavior left over from kittenhood when they would knead their mother's belly to stimulate milk flow. When your cat kneads on you, it's a sign they associate you with the comfort and care they received as a kitten. # Seeking Out Your Scent Your scent is calming to your cat. You may notice them sleeping on your clothes or in your bed, especially when you're not home. This behavior indicates they find comfort in your scent and see you as a source of security. # The Protective Watch Cats often keep a watchful eye on their loved ones. If your cat watches over you, especially when you're sleeping or not feeling well, it's their way of ensuring you're safe. They're taking on the role of protector, just as they would for their young. # Meowing Conversations Cats typically meow more at humans than at other cats. If your cat meows at you quite a bit, it's because they see you as someone worth talking to. This vocalization is their way of communicating with you, showing you're an important part of their world. # Eating with You If your cat likes to eat when you're eating, it's a sign they feel part of the family. Sharing meal times can be a social activity for cats when they feel closely bonded with someone. # Sleeping with You Choosing to sleep with you, especially during the daytime when they're most vulnerable, is a sign of ultimate trust. It means your cat feels most secure and content when they're with you. # Mirroring Your Actions Cats often mirror the actions of those they feel connected to. If your cat tries to mimic your movements or routines, it's a sign they're paying attention to you and want to be like you. # Licking You When your cat licks you, they're grooming you, which is a nurturing behavior reserved for those they feel closest to. It's another way cats mark their community members—through shared scents and the act of grooming. # Showing Their Full Attention When your cat gives you their undivided attention, turning their ears to listen to you, and watching your every move, it’s a clear indication they respect and admire you. This focused attention reflects their interest in your well-being and their role in your life as a companion and protector. # Appreciating Their Signs of Affection Recognizing these signs of affection and trust is the first step in further deepening the bond between you and your cat. Every gesture, no matter how small, is your cat's way of saying, \\"You're my family, my protector, my parent.\\" By understanding these signs, you can better appreciate the unique and loving relationship you share with your furry friend. Remember, communication with your cat is a two-way street; showing them love and respect in return will only strengthen the bond you share."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Instead, I'll guide you through a potential workaround using Node.js for the server-side operation to handle the file write operation. **Step 1: HTML and JavaScript to Collect User Data** Create a file \`index.html\`: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Collect User Info</title> </head> <body> <h2>User Information Form</h2> <form id=\\"userInfoForm\\"> <label for=\\"name\\">Name:</label><br> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"name\\" name=\\"name\\"><br> <label for=\\"phone\\">Phone:</label><br> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"phone\\" name=\\"phone\\"><br><br> <input type=\\"button\\" value=\\"Submit\\" onclick=\\"submitForm()\\"> </form> <script> function submitForm() { const name = document.getElementById('name').value; const phone = document.getElementById('phone').value; // Simple form validation if (!name || !phone) { alert('Both name and phone are required!'); return; } const userData = { name, phone }; // Using Fetch API to send data to our server fetch('/submit', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }, body: JSON.stringify(userData), }) .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { console.log('Success:', data); alert('User data submitted successfully!'); }) .catch((error) => { console.error('Error:', error); }); } <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` **Step 2: Setting up a Node.js Server with Express** You'll need Node.js installed on your system to proceed. We will use Express for creating a simple server that can handle the POST request and write to a file. 1. Initialize a new node project in your directory: \`\`\`bash npm init -y \`\`\` 2. Install Express: \`\`\`bash npm install express \`\`\` 3. Install \`fs-extra\` for file operations: \`\`\`bash npm install fs-extra \`\`\` Create a file \`server.js\`: \`\`\`javascript const express = require('express'); const fs = require('fs-extra'); const path = require('path'); const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); const app = express(); const PORT = 3000; app.use(bodyParser.json()); // to support JSON-encoded bodies app.use(express.static('./')); // to serve your static files // Route to handle POST request app.post('/submit', async (req, res) => { const userData = req.body; try { const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'users.json'); // Check if users.json exists if (await fs.exists(filePath)) { // Read current data const data = await fs.readJson(filePath); data.users.push(userData); await fs.writeJson(filePath, data); } else { // Create new file with initial data await fs.writeJson(filePath, { users: [userData] }); } res.send({ status: 'success', message: 'User data saved!' }); } catch (error) { console.error(error); res.status(500).send({ status: 'error', message: 'Failed to save user data' }); } }); app.listen(PORT, () => { console.log(\`Server is running on http://localhost:{PORT}\`); }); \`\`\` **Running Your Application:** 1. Start your server with \`node server.js\`. 2. Open your browser and go to \`http://localhost:3000/index.html\`. 3. Fill in the form and submit it. The user's data will be saved into \`users.json\`. This simple setup captures user data from a web form and saves it into a JSON file on the server. Remember, direct file system access from a browser is not possible due to security restrictions, hence the need for a server-side script like this one."},{"instruction":"can you do it without any outside library","output":"Creating an entire user data submission and file-writing mechanism without any external libraries on the server-side, including the notable exclusion of Express and fs-extra, involves utilizing only native Node.js modules such as \`http\` for serving the web page and handling HTTP requests, and \`fs\` for file system operations. Below is an example of how you might accomplish this task with basic functionality. **Step 1: HTML & JavaScript for User Information Form** The \`index.html\` file remains largely the same. Save this with your other project files. \`\`\`html <!-- index.html --> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Collect User Info</title> </head> <body> <h2>User Information Form</h2> <form id=\\"userInfoForm\\"> <label for=\\"name\\">Name:</label><br> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"name\\" name=\\"name\\"><br> <label for=\\"phone\\">Phone:</label><br> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"phone\\" name=\\"phone\\"><br><br> <input type=\\"button\\" value=\\"Submit\\" onclick=\\"submitForm()\\"> </form> <script> function submitForm() { const name = document.getElementById('name').value; const phone = document.getElementById('phone').value; if (!name || !phone) { alert('Both name and phone are required!'); return; } const userData = { name, phone }; fetch('/submit', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }, body: JSON.stringify(userData), }) .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { alert('User data submitted successfully!'); }) .catch((error) => { alert('Error:', error); }); } <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` **Step 2: Node.js Server without Outside Libraries** You'll create a simple HTTP server that serves the HTML file and handles POST requests to store user data. \`\`\`javascript // server.js const http = require('http'); const fs = require('fs'); const path = require('path'); const PORT = 3000; const usersFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'users.json'); const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') { fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, 'index.html'), (err, data) => { if (err) { res.writeHead(500); res.end('Server Error'); return; } res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }); res.end(data); }); } else if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/submit') { let body = ''; req.on('data', chunk => { body += chunk.toString(); // convert Buffer to string }); req.on('end', () => { const userData = JSON.parse(body); // Read existing users.json file or start fresh let existingUsers = []; if (fs.existsSync(usersFilePath)) { const rawData = fs.readFileSync(usersFilePath); const data = JSON.parse(rawData); existingUsers = data.users; } // Add new user and write to file existingUsers.push(userData); fs.writeFileSync(usersFilePath, JSON.stringify({ users: existingUsers }, null, 2), 'utf8'); res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }); res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'User data saved!' })); }); } else { res.writeHead(404); res.end('Not Found'); } }); server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(\`Server running on http://localhost:{PORT}\`)); \`\`\` **Running Your Application:** 1. Ensure \`index.html\` and \`server.js\` are in the same directory. 2. Run the server using Node.js by executing \`node server.js\`. 3. Open a browser and go to \`http://localhost:3000/\` to see the user form. 4. Submitting the form will save the data to \`users.json\` in the same directory as your server script. This example demonstrates a simple way to handle HTTP requests without external libraries, meeting the criteria of not using any outside library. Remember, this is a very basic setup; real-world applications often require more robust handling, validation, and security measures."},{"instruction":"i am in windows can you do it without node.js instead use .bat file","output":"Creating a solution that interacts with web content and saves data to a file solely using a \`.bat\` script directly in Windows, without leveraging server-side frameworks like Node.js, is extremely limited and unconventional. Batch files have no built-in capabilities to serve HTML files or handle HTTP requests directly. They are primarily used for automating repetitive command-line tasks within the Windows environment. However, I understand you're looking for a solution that avoids server-side programming. Although not via a .bat file, an alternative approach to collecting data and saving it without a server involves leveraging HTML and JavaScript together with possibly local storage or embedding VBScript (for Windows-specific solutions) to interact with the file system, though the latter has significant limitations and security restrictions, especially on modern systems. Here's a revised suggestion that keeps everything client-side, albeit with its limitations: # Using LocalStorage (Web Only, No File System Access) This approach doesn't save data to a \`users.json\` file on your system but demonstrates how you can persist user data across page loads using the web's \`localStorage\`. \`\`\`html <!-- index.html --> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Collect User Info</title> </head> <body> <h2>User Information Form</h2> <label for=\\"name\\">Name:</label><br> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"name\\" name=\\"name\\"><br> <label for=\\"phone\\">Phone:</label><br> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"phone\\" name=\\"phone\\"><br><br> <button onclick=\\"saveData()\\">Submit</button> <script> function saveData() { const name = document.getElementById('name').value; const phone = document.getElementById('phone').value; if (!name || !phone) { alert('Both name and phone are required!'); return; } const userData = { name, phone }; localStorage.setItem('userData', JSON.stringify(userData)); alert('User data saved locally!'); } <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` # Limitations - The data is saved in the browser's \`localStorage\`, not in a file on the server or the user's system. - \`localStorage\` has a storage limit of about 5MB to 10MB, depending on the browser. - The data can easily be cleared by the user or browser settings, and is not shared across different browsers on the same device. - There's no straightforward way to extract this data externally (e.g., into a .json file) without additional programming or manual intervention. # Alternative Methods Requiring a Server or External Software 1. **Using a Server:** As initially described, a server-side technology (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.) would be needed to accept HTTP requests and interact with the server's file system to save a \`users.json\` file securely. 2. **Email Forms**: If you're collecting data via a form and can't or don't want to use a server, consider using services that convert form submissions into emails. However, this still won't directly save data into a \`.json\` file but can be an intermediary step. 3. **External Services**: Use a third-party service or API that collects data and can save it to a file or offer downloading capabilities. Google Forms is an example that could collect information and save it to Google Sheets, from which you could export data as JSON. In conclusion, directly creating or modifying files on the client's system via HTML/JavaScript or a batch (.bat) script isn't feasible or recommended due to security restrictions. Utilizing local storage can offer a temporary solution for persisting data client-side, while server-side programming provides the most flexibility and control for processing and storing user data securely."},{"instruction":"how to launch on linux simple https server that will allow to download files","output":"To launch a simple HTTPS server on Linux that allows you to download files, you can use the Python built-in module called \`http.server\`.

if (myString == \\"on\\") { std::cout << \\"The strings are equal.\\" << std::endl; } else { std::cout << \\"The strings are not equal.\\" << std::endl; } return 0; } \`\`\` 이 방법은 가독성이 좋고, 문자열이 직접적으로 같은지를 확인하기 위해 가장 직관적인 방법입니다. \`std::string\`의 \`==\` 연산자는 내부적으로 문자열의 길이와 각 문자들을 순차적으로 비교합니다. 따라서, 이 방법은 대소문자를 구분하여 문자열을 비교합니다. 만약 대소문자를 구분하지 않고 비교하고 싶다면, 먼저 두 문자열을 동일한 케이스(대문자나 소문자)로 변환한 뒤 비교해야 합니다. 이를 위해서는 추가적인 함수나 라이브러리가 필요할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, Boost 라이브러리의 \`boost::iequals\` 함수나 C++ 표준 라이브러리에 직접 함수를 구현하는 방법 등이 있습니다. 하지만 기본적인 문자열 비교의 경우, \`==\` 연산자를 사용하는 것이 가장 단순하고 직관적인 방법입니다."},{"instruction":"아이슈타인이 나이별로 이룬 업적을 말해줘.","output":"알베르트 아인슈타인의 생애를 통해 이룬 주요 업적들을 나이별로 살펴보겠습니다. 아인슈타인의 과학적 업적은 주로 그의 젊은 시절에 집중되어 있습니다. 그는 이론물리학 분야에 혁명을 일으키며 현대 물리학의 발전에 결정적인 역할을 했습니다. **1905년** (\\"기적의 해\\"): 26세 - **특수상대성이론**: 물체의 속도가 광속에 가까워질 때 시간, 길이, 질량이 어떻게 변하는지 설명합니다. - **광전효과에 대한 법칙**: 빛이 입자와 같은 성질을 가질 수 있음을 제안하며, 광자 개념을 도입합니다. 이 업적으로 1921년에 노벨 물리학상을 수상했습니다. - **브라운 운동에 대한 이론**: 미시적 입자가 수액 내에서 무작위로 움직이는 현상(브라운 운동)을 설명하여 원자와 분자의 존재를 수학적으로 입증합니다. - **E=mc²**: 질량과 에너지의 등가성을 설명하는 유명한 공식을 제안합니다. 이는 후에 핵분열과 핵융합을 이해하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 합니다. **1915년 대**: - **일반상대성이론**(1915년/1916년, 36/37세): 중력을 시공간의 곡률로 해석하며, 대규모 우주 현상에 대한 설명을 제공합니다. 이 이론은 그 후 수십 년에 걸쳐 다양한 경험적 검증을 받으며 현대 우주론 및 우주의 대규모 구조 이해에 필수적입니다. **1921년**: 42세 - **노벨 물리학상 수상**: 광전효과에 관한 그의 발견이 \\"물리학, 특히 광전효과에 대한 발견\\"으로 인정받습니다. 주목할 점은, 아인슈타인이 노벨상을 받았을 때 상대성이론에 대한 것이 아니라 광전효과에 대한 연구로 수상했다는 것입니다. **이후의 년대**: - 아인슈타인은 나머지 생애 동안 통일장이론을 포함해 여러 물리학 이론에 대한 연구를 계속했지만, 그의 초기 업적만큼 확실하고 결정적인 성과를 내지는 못했습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 그의 작업은 현대 물리학의 여러 분야, 특히 우주론, 양자역학, 상대성이론에 큰 영향을 미쳤습니다. 아인슈타인은 이러한 주요 과학적 업적 외에도 평생 동안 과학, 철학, 사회, 정치적 이슈에 대한 깊은 통찰력과 의견을 제시한 것으로도 유명합니다. 그는 지식과 인류에 대한 헌신이 매우 뛰어난 과학자였습니다."},{"instruction":"수학 관련 전성기 나이는 몇살인가?","output":"수학자의 전성기 나이에 대한 질문은 특정한 답을 얻기 어렵습니다. 이는 수학자마다 그들이 주요 발견을 한 시기가 다르기 때문입니다. 하지만 여러 연구와 일화에서, 많은 수학자들이 20대와 30대 초에 상당수의 중요한 업적을 이루었다는 공통된 패턴을 찾을 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 칼 프리드리히 가우스는 24세에 수학의 기본정리를 증명했고, 에바리스트 갈루아는 20대 초반에 이미 군론의 기초를 놓았습니다. 아인슈타인도 그의 기적의 해엔 26세였습니다 (비록 그는 물리학자지만, 상대성 이론은 수학적 개념에 깊이 기반하고 있습니다). 또한, 세르주 랑은 27세에 필즈상을 수상했습니다. 물론 이러한 패턴에는 예외도 많습니다. 예를 들어, 앤드루 와일즈는 페르마의 마지막 정리를 증명했을 때 40대였습니다. 그리고 수학은 젊은 시기에만 성공할 수 있는 분야가 아닙니다; 많은 수학자들이 자신의 전문 분야에서 평생 동안 중요한 기여를 계속합니다. 그렇기 때문에 '수학자의 전성기 나이'를 명확히 규정짓기는 어렵습니다. 다양한 나이대에서 중요한 수학적 업적을 이룬 수학자들이 많이 있으며, 개인의 창의력, 경험, 집중력 등의 요소가 어떻게 결합되어 발전하느냐에 따라 어느 시기에 전성기를 맞이할 지는 크게 달라질 수 있습니다."},{"instruction":"바퀴벌래의 IQ는 몇인가?","output":"IQ (Intelligence Quotient, 지능지수)는 인간의 지능을 평가하기 위해 고안된 척도입니다. 따라서, 인간이 아닌 동물, 특히 바퀴벌래와 같은 곤충의 지능을 측정하기 위해 IQ 수치를 사용하는 것은 적절하지 않습니다. 바퀴벌래나 다른 곤충들은 인간처럼 추상적인 사고나 복잡한 문제 해결 능력을 갖추고 있지 않습니다. 그러나 이들은 생존, 번식, 먹이 찾기, 피난처 찾기 등의 본능적인 행동에서 보여주는 능력을 통해 지능의 특정 형태를 드러냅니다. 바퀴벌래는 환경에 대한 높은 적응성, 학습 능력, 탈출 전략 개발과 같은 다양한 복잡한 행동들을 통해 놀라운 생존 기술을 보여줍니다. 예를 들어, 그들은 위험을 감지하였을 때 빠르게 탈출하는 등의 반응을 보여줌으로써 상황 인식 능력을 시사합니다. 또한, 실험적 조건 하에서 바퀴벌래가 단순한 학습과 기억을 통해 특정 자극에 반응을 조정할 수 있다는 증거도 있습니다. 이처럼 곤충의 \\"지능\\"은 인간에게서 기대하는 지능과 매우 다르며, 그들의 행동과 능력은 그들의 생존에 적합한 방식으로 진화했습니다. 그래서 바퀴벌래의 지능을 숫자로 표현하는 것은 과학적으로 의미가 없으며, 이들의 생존 전략과 행동 패턴을 평가하고 이해하는 것은 그들의 생태와 진화론적 적응을 더 잘 이해하는 데 있어 중요합니다."},{"instruction":"늑대가 개보다 머리가 좋다는 증거가 있나?","output":"늑대와 개의 지능을 비교하는 것은 복잡한 주제입니다. 이들 간의 지능을 직접 비교하는 것은 둘의 생활 환경, 서식 조건, 그리고 진화적 배경이 매우 다르기 때문에 쉽지 않습니다. 늑대는 야생에서 생존하기 위해 다양한 사회적 상호작용, 문제 해결 능력, 복잡한 사냥 기술 등을 발전시켰으며, 이러한 능력은 늑대가 고도로 지능적인 행동을 할 수 있음을 시사합니다. 반면에 개는 오랜 기간 인간과 공존하며 국내화되어 왔으며, 이 과정에서 인간에게 의존하게 되면서 늑대에 비해 다른 유형의 지능을 발달시켰을 가능성이 있습니다. 연구에 따르면, 늑대는 개보다 특정 문제 해결 과제에서 더 뛰어난 성과를 보이는 경향이 있습니다. 예를 들어, 늑대는 밧줄이나 상자 같은 도구를 사용하여 음식에 접근하는 데 필요한 문제를 해결하는 데 있어 개보다 더 나은 성과를 보일 수 있습니다. 이러한 연구는 늑대가 독립적으로 문제를 해결하는 능력이 개보다 더 발달했을 수 있음을 제안합니다. 그러나 개는 사람과의 상호작용과 의사소통 능력에서 늑대보다 뛰어날 수 있습니다. 수천 년 동안의 국내화 과정에서 개는 인간의 감정과 의도를 이해하고, 인간과 효과적으로 소통하는 방법을 발달시켰습니다. 개는 인간의 제스처, 말투, 신체 언어를 해석하는 데 매우 능숙하며, 이는 생존 및 번식에 유리하도록 진화한 결과일 것입니다. 결론적으로, 늑대와 개 사이의 지능을 직접 비교하는 것은 어려우며, 이들의 지능은 각각 다른 환경과 생존 전략에 적응하기 위해 발달했습니다. 여러 연구 결과는 늑대와 개 모두 고유의 지능을 가지고 있으며, 그들의 지능을 단순히 좋고 나쁨으로 평가하는 것이 아니라, 각각의 생활 방식과 진화적 배경에 적합한 능력을 발달시켰음을 보여줍니다."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee and flower\\"","output":"\\"book and coffee and flower\\""}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],N={key:0},L={key:1};function W(n,e,h,f,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
