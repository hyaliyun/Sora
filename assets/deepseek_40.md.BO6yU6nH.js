Let the plane intersect PB at point E and intersect PC at point F. Denote the midpoint of EF as H and the midpoint of BC as D. 3. Since BC is parallel to the section AEF, we know that BC parallel EF, therefore H lies on PD. 4. Given that EF perp PD and EF perp AD, it follows that EF is perpendicular to the plane PAD. 5.

If a white checker is at row a_i in column i and a black checker is in row b_i in the same column, the distance between these two checkers is given by:    [    |a_i - b_i|    ] 3. **Summation of Distances:**    Let S be the total sum of these distances for all columns:    [    S = sum_{i=1}^8 |a_i - b_i|    ] 4. **Bounding the Distance:**    To maximize S, consider the positions a_i = 1, 2, ..., 8. Similarly, the positions b_i = 1, 2, ..., 8. Note that irrespective of which checker is white or black, we can reorder them to compute the maximum sum:    [    |a_i - b_i| = |(a_i - 4.5) - (b_i - 4.5)|    ] 5. **Triangle Inequality Application:**    Using the triangle inequality:    [    |a_i - b_i| = |(a_i - 4.5) - (b_i - 4.5)| leq |a_i - 4.5| + |b_i - 4.5|    ] 6. **Summation of Bounds:**    Summing these inequalities for all columns i:    [    S leq sum_{i=1}^8 (|a_i - 4.5| + |b_i - 4.5|)    ] 7. **Symmetric Arrangement Analysis:**    Notice that the sum of the absolute deviations from 4.5 is symmetric and doesn't depend on which specific checker is white or black, only on their numeric positions:    [    S leq 2 sum_{i=1}^8 |i - 4.5|    ] 8. **Evaluating the Maximum Sum:**    Explicitly compute the sum of the deviations:    [    sum_{i=1}^8 |i - 4.5| = 3.5 + 2.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 3.5 = 16    ]    Therefore, the full sum:    [    2 times 16 = 32    ] 9. **Concluding Maximum Arrangement:**    For the sum to achieve the upper bound of 32, each column must have one checker in the top four rows (1 to 4) and one checker in the bottom four rows (5 to 8). This arrangement guarantees that each pair-by-column maximizes the distance sum. # Conclusion: The maximum possible sum of the distances between each white checker and the black checker within the same column is expressed as: [ boxed{32} ]"},{"instruction":"For the equation x<sup>2</sup> + ax + b = 0 concerning x, the following four propositions are given:<br />A: x = 1 is a root of the equation;<br />B: x = 3 is a root of the equation;<br />C: the sum of the two roots of the equation is 2;<br />D: the two roots of the equation have opposite signs.<br />If only one proposition is false, then the proposition is ( ) A: A B: B C: C D: D","output":"To solve this problem, we analyze each proposition by assuming it is false and checking the validity of the remaining propositions. 1. **Assuming Proposition A is false:**    - Propositions B, C, and D must be true.    - If x = 3 is a root (Proposition B), and the sum of the roots is 2 (Proposition C), then the other root must be x_2 = 2 - 3 = -1.    - With roots 3 and -1, they indeed have opposite signs (Proposition D).    - This scenario is consistent with the given conditions. 2. **Assuming Proposition B is false:**    - Propositions A, C, and D must be true.    - If x = 1 is a root (Proposition A), and the sum of the roots is 2 (Proposition C), then the other root must also be x_2 = 2 - 1 = 1.    - However, both roots being 1 means they do not have opposite signs, contradicting Proposition D.    - This scenario does not meet the conditions of the problem. 3. **Assuming Proposition C is false:**    - Propositions A, B, and D must be true.    - If x = 1 and x = 3 are roots (Propositions A and B), this implies the roots do not sum to 2, contradicting the assumption that Proposition C is false.    - Additionally, both roots being positive means they do not have opposite signs, contradicting Proposition D.    - This scenario also does not meet the conditions of the problem. 4. **Assuming Proposition D is false:**    - Propositions A, B, and C must be true.    - If x = 1 and x = 3 are roots (Propositions A and B), and their sum is 2 (Proposition C), this is inconsistent since 1 + 3 = 4 neq 2.    - This analysis is incorrect because it misinterprets the implications of Proposition D being false.

Case 1: ( n ) is odd 1. **Summation Analysis**: Consider an ( n times n ) table where ( n ) is odd. The sums of the numbers in each row and column should be all the different values from 1 to ( 2n ).      2. **Sum of All Sums**: The sum of all the row sums and column sums, denoted as ( S ), will then be:    [    S = 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 2n = sum_{k=1}^{2n} k    ]     3. **Arithmetic Series Formula**: Using the formula for the sum of the first ( m ) natural numbers, we get:    [    S = frac{2n(2n + 1)}{2} = n(2n + 1)    ]     4. **Nature of ( S )**: As ( n ) is odd, ( 2n+1 ) is an even number, making ( n(2n + 1) ) odd. Therefore, ( S ) is an odd number.     5. **Double Counting Argument**: Each element in the table contributes to exactly one row sum and exactly one column sum. Hence, if we define ( T ) as the total sum of all entries in the table, then ( 2T ) should be equal to the sum of the row sums and the column sums. This implies:    [    2T = S    ]    Since ( S ) is odd, ( 2T = S ) requires ( S ) to be even for consistency (since ( 2T ) is clearly even). Thus, we have a contradiction.  Conclusion for Odd ( n ) The contradiction proves that no such ( n times n ) table exists when ( n ) is odd, as it cannot satisfy all the required conditions.  Case 2: ( n ) is even 1. **Construction of the Table**: Let ( n = 2k ) where ( k ) is an integer. We will describe a method to construct the table:     2. **Table Configuration**:     - Fill all the entries above the main diagonal (running from the top-left to bottom-right) with 2's.     - Fill all the entries below the main diagonal with 0's.     - Fill the first ( k ) entries on the main diagonal with 1's.     - Fill the last ( k ) entries on the main diagonal with 2's.      3. **Sum of Rows and Columns**:      - **Rows**: The sum of elements in the first ( k ) rows will be ( 4k - 1, 4k - 3, ldots, 2k + 1 ).     - The sum of elements in the next ( k ) rows will be ( 2k, 2k - 2, ldots, 2 ).          - **Columns**: The sum of elements in the first ( k ) columns will be ( 1, 3, ldots, 2k - 1 ).     - The sum of elements in the next ( k ) columns will be ( 2k + 2, 2k + 4, ldots, 4k ). 4. **Range of Sums**: As we see, all numbers from 1 to ( 2n = 4k ) appear exactly once when summing the rows and columns.   Conclusion for Even ( n ) Thus, it is possible to construct an ( n times n ) table satisfying the conditions when ( n ) is even.

How much time would it take the monkey to reach the top?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net distance the monkey climbs each hour and then determine how many hours it will take to reach the top of the tree. Each hour, the monkey hops up 7 ft but slips back 4 ft, so the net distance climbed each hour is: 7 ft (hopped up) - 4 ft (slipped back) = 3 ft net gain per hour. However, when the monkey reaches the top of the tree, it won't slip back, so we need to consider the last hop that gets the monkey to the top of the tree. Let's first calculate how far the monkey can climb before the final hop. Since the tree is 51 ft tall, we need to subtract the distance of the final hop (7 ft) from the total height to see how much distance the monkey needs to cover before the last hop: 51 ft (total height) - 7 ft (final hop) = 44 ft. Now, we divide this distance by the net gain per hour to find out how many hours it takes to reach this point: 44 ft / 3 ft per hour = 14.67 hours. Since the monkey can't climb a fraction of an hour, we'll round down to the nearest whole hour, which is 14 hours. After 14 hours, the monkey will have climbed: 14 hours * 3 ft per hour = 42 ft. At this point, the monkey is 42 ft up the tree, and it needs to climb the remaining distance to reach the top: 51 ft (total height) - 42 ft (climbed in 14 hours) = 9 ft. In the next hour, the monkey will hop up 7 ft, which will take it to the top of the tree without slipping back, as it will have reached its goal.

That is, any function ( g: S^{k-1} to S ) that satisfies the given condition is a function of one of its elements.    - Now consider ( k geq 2 ) and a function ( f: S^k to S ) that satisfies the condition of the problem.

For every ( a in S ) with ( a neq b ), the sequences ( (a, a_2, ldots, a_k) ) and ( (b, b_2, ldots, b_k) ) differ in all elements. Therefore, ( f(b, b_2, b_3, ldots, b_k) neq f(a, a_2, ldots, a_k) = varphi(a) ).    - This implies ( f(b, b_2, b_3, ldots, b_k) = varphi(b) ).    - By repeating this argument, we can show that for any sequence ( (c_2, c_3, ldots, c_k) in S^k ), ( f(c_1, c_2, ldots, c_k) = varphi(c_1) ). Thus, ( f ) is a function of its first element.    **Case 2**: For every ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k in S ), there exist distinct ( alpha(a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ) and ( beta(a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) in S ) such that ( f(alpha, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) = f(beta, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ).    - Define ( g: S^{k-1} to S ) by ( g(a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) = f(alpha, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) = f(beta, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ).    - We claim that ( g ) satisfies the conditions of the problem. If ( (a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k) ) and ( (b_2, b_3, ldots, b_k) ) differ in all elements, then ( (alpha, a_2, ldots, a_k) ) and ( (beta, b_2, ldots, b_k) ) differ in all elements.

One approach is to evaluate the factors of the constant term (-14). We suspect ( x ) to be one of its factors. Hence:    [    x(x^2 - 4x - 19) = 14    ]    This simplifies to:    [    x^3 - 4x^2 - 19x - 14 = 0    ] 7. **Test the possible values (Factors of 14):**    We’ll test ( x = 7 ), because it is a plausible base.

Given that P(B) = 0.9 and P(A) = 0.5, we substitute these values into the conditional probability formula:  P(A|B) = frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = frac{0.5}{0.9} = frac{5}{9}  So the probability that a 20-year-old animal will live beyond 25 years is boxed{frac{5}{9}}."},{"instruction":"The range of the function f(x) is __________.","output":"The range of the function f(x) is (0, +infty).

What is the maximum number of triangles they can cut from the plane?","output":"Consider three families of parallel lines, with 10 lines in each family. To determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by the intersections of these lines, follow these steps: 1. **Calculation of Intersection Points:**    Each family of lines intersects with each of the other families. Since there might be no intersections within the same family of parallel lines, we only consider intersections between different families. For two families, each with 10 lines, we get:    [    text{Number of intersections} = 10 times 10 = 100 text{ points}    ] 2. **Forming Triangles:**    To form a triangle, we need one line from each of the three families. Select a line from one of the families, another one from the second family, and another one from the third family.    Any combination of one line from each of the three families will result in a unique triangle. 3. **Counting the Triangles:**    The total number of triangles can be counted using the combination formula. We select one line from 10 lines in the first family, one from the 10 lines in the second family, and one from the 10 lines in the third family. The number of triangles formed is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each line:    [    text{Total number of triangles} = 10 times 10 times 10 = 1000    ] However, this count doesn't restrict the calculation just to triangles whose vertices are resolved into strictly unique configurations. 4. **Adjusting For Duplicates and Constraint:**    Observing that each unique triangle is determined by three lines from the different families can be more constrict. An adjustment around the possible combinational intersections and specific inclusion-exclusion principles might be necessary to restrict to connected planes or avoiding over-count (triangles on smaller sub-planes considered). 5. **Conclusion:** Given corrections and upper-bounds established via combinational analysis:    [    m 10 ~ in~combining~ each~ family~lines - adjoint count~invoking~Vertex intersection max retrained    - triangle~via~ concurrent lines     = 100 ] Thus, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by three families of 10 parallel lines in each family is ( 150 ).

In which case does the incircle cover a larger portion of the triangle's area?","output":"1. **Establish Definitions and Setup**:     First, we analyze the case when the inscribed circle touches the legs of the isosceles triangle closer to the base at the one-third points. Let (A), (B), and (C) be the vertices of the isosceles triangle where (AB = AC). Let the center of the inscribed circle be (O) and its radius be (varrho). The altitude from (A) to (BC) meets (BC) at (F), and the perpendicular from (O) to (AB) meets (AB) at (D). Let the length of the segment (OA) be (y).  2. **Identify Lengths and Ratios**:          Given that (BF = BD = x), since these are segments drawn from the center to tangent points on the circle, and by the given conditions (AD = 2x).          The right triangles (AOD) and (ABF) are similar since they share a common angle at (A). Therefore, the ratio of their corresponding sides gives:     [     frac{y}{3x} = frac{varrho}{x} implies y = 3varrho     ] 3. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem**:     Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle (AOD):     [     varrho^2 + (2x)^2 = y^2 implies varrho^2 + 4x^2 = 9varrho^2 implies 4x^2 = 8varrho^2 implies x = varrhosqrt{2}     ] 4. **Calculate Triangle Area and Circle Area**:     The height of triangle (ABC) is (y + varrho = 4varrho). Thus, the area of triangle (ABC) is:     [     T_{triangle} = x cdot text{height} = varrhosqrt{2} cdot 4varrho = 4sqrt{2}varrho^2     ]     The area of the circle:     [     T_{bigcirc} = varrho^2 pi     ] 5. **Find Ratio of Areas**:     Therefore, the ratio of the area of the triangle to the circle is:     [     frac{T_{triangle}}{T_{bigcirc}} = frac{4sqrt{2}varrho^2}{varrho^2 pi} = frac{4sqrt{2}}{pi} approx 1.8006     ] 6. **Analyze the Other Case**:     For the second case, when the inscribed circle touches the legs of the triangle farther from the base at the two-third points:     Following similar reasoning, let (y' = frac{3}{2}varrho), and let the lengths of the tangents be (2x).     [     varrho^2 + x^2 = left(frac{3}{2}varrhoright)^2 implies varrho^2 + x^2 = frac{9}{4}varrho^2 implies x = frac{sqrt{5}}{2} varrho     ]     The area of the triangle:     [     T_{triangle'} = 2xcdot (y' + varrho) = sqrt{5}varrho cdot frac{5}{2}varrho = frac{5sqrt{5}}{2}varrho^2     ]     Again, the area of the circle remains:     [     T_{bigcirc} = varrho^2 pi     ] 7. **Find Ratio of Areas in the Second Case**:     Thus, the ratio of the area of the triangle to the circle in the second case is:     [     frac{T_{triangle'}}{T_{bigcirc}} = frac{frac{5sqrt{5}}{2} varrho^2}{varrho^2 pi} = frac{5sqrt{5}}{2pi} approx 1.7794     ] 8. **Conclusion**:     Comparing the two ratios, we find that (frac{4sqrt{2}}{pi} approx 1.8006) is greater than (frac{5sqrt{5}}{2pi} approx 1.7794).

From these properties, it follows that v cannot be adjacent to all vertices in any Hamiltonian cycle in G-v. Therefore, the degree of v, mathrm{d}(v), must satisfy:    [    mathrm{d}(v) leq leftlfloor frac{n-1}{2} rightrfloor    ]    Otherwise, v would have too many connections and could create a cycle in G with other vertices. 4.

To see whether n geq 7 can satisfy these conditions, consider the following calculations: - For n = 7, each vertex's degree must be exactly 3. However, in a 7-vertex graph, the sum of degrees must be:   [   2|E| = sum_{v in V} mathrm{d}(v) = 7 cdot 3 = 21,   ]   which leads to a contradiction since the sum of degrees must be even. Hence, n neq 7. - For n = 8, each vertex's degree must still be 3. We assume a Hamiltonian cycle and test different adjacency scenarios:   - If vertices v_5 and v_7 are adjacent, a cycle v_1 v_2 v_3 v_4 v_5 v_7 v_6 v must exist in G, which contradicts the conditions.   - If vertices v_5 and v_2 are adjacent, a cycle v v_6 v_7 v_1 v_2 v_5 v_4 v_3 must exist in G, leading to another contradiction. 6.

Taking into account his training schedule, holidays, and missed days, how many hours does James train in a year?","output":"Let's calculate the total hours James trains in a week first. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he trains for 4 hours twice a day: 3 days * 2 sessions/day * 4 hours/session = 24 hours On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he trains for 3 hours in the morning and 5 hours in the evening: 2 days * (3 hours + 5 hours) = 2 days * 8 hours/day = 16 hours So in a typical week, he trains for a total of: 24 hours + 16 hours = 40 hours Now, let's calculate the total number of weeks in a year that he trains. There are 52 weeks in a year. He takes one week off for holidays, so that leaves: 52 weeks - 1 week = 51 weeks Additionally, he misses another 10 days throughout the year. Since he trains 5 days a week, we can convert these days into weeks: 10 days / 5 days/week = 2 weeks So, he effectively misses another 2 weeks of training, which leaves us with: 51 weeks - 2 weeks = 49 weeks of training Now, we can calculate the total hours he trains in a year: 49 weeks * 40 hours/week = 1960 hours Therefore, James trains for boxed{1960}  hours in a year."},{"instruction":"Given the ellipse C: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 (a > b > 0) with two focal points F_1(1,0) and F_2(1,0).

The dealer wants to make a mixture of 80 pounds that he can sell for 2.20 dollars per pound. This means the total value of the mixture is ( 80 times 2.20 ) dollars. The dealer needs 64 pounds of the cheaper candy, so the value of the cheaper candy in the mixture is ( 64 times x ) dollars. The remaining 16 pounds (80 - 64) are the candy worth 3.00 dollars a pound, so the value of the more expensive candy in the mixture is ( 16 times 3.00 ) dollars. The total value of the mixture is the sum of the value of the cheaper candy and the value of the more expensive candy: [ 64x + 16 times 3.00 = 80 times 2.20 ] Now we can solve for ( x ): [ 64x + 48 = 176 ] Subtract 48 from both sides: [ 64x = 176 - 48 ] [ 64x = 128 ] Divide both sides by 64: [ x = frac{128}{64} ] [ x = 2 ] So, the cheaper candy is worth boxed{2.00}  dollars per pound."},{"instruction":"Given that the vertex of the parabola C is at the origin, and its focus is on the xaxis.

First, let's define another function gleft(xright)=(x-a_{1})(x-a_{2})ldots (x-a_{10}). This allows us to express fleft(xright) in terms of gleft(xright) as follows: [fleft(xright)=xgleft(xright).] To find {f'}left(0right), we need the derivative of fleft(xright). By applying the product rule for differentiation, we obtain: [f'(x) = g(x) + xg'(x).] Setting x=0 in the derivative gives us: [f'(0) = g(0) + 0 cdot g'(0) = g(0).] To evaluate g(0), we substitute x=0 into gleft(xright), which yields: [g(0) = (-a_{1})(-a_{2})ldots(-a_{10}) = a_{1}a_{2}ldots a_{9}a_{10}.] Given that {a_{n}} is a geometric sequence with a_{2}=1 and a_{9}=9, we can find the common ratio r using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, a_{n} = a_{1}r^{n-1}.

This is because the product a_{1}a_{2}ldots a_{9}a_{10} can be simplified by recognizing the properties of a geometric sequence, where each term can be represented as a power of the common ratio times the first term. The product of all terms in the sequence up to a_{10} can be expressed in terms of the known values a_{2} and a_{9}, leading to (a_{2}a_{9})^{5} = 9^{5} = 3^{10}.

Since these values are integers, ( S ) is a set of natural numbers (positive integers). 4. **Existence of a Minimum Value**:     Because ( S ) is a non-empty set of natural numbers, ( S ) has a minimum value.

A line parallel to this through point ( B ) intersects the circles at points ( P ) and ( Q ) (other than ( B )). We are asked to prove that ( MN = PQ ). 1. **Identifying Key Angles:**     - Observe that ( angle NQP = angle NQB ) because ( Q ) and ( P ) are points on the circle intersected by the line parallel to the line through ( A ).     - Since lines through ( A ) and ( B ) are parallel, ( angle NQB = angle ABQ ) by corresponding angles.     - Similarly, ( angle BQM = angle BAM ). 2. **Use of Supplementary Angles:**     - Notice that ( angle BQM = 180^circ - angle BPQ ) as they are on a straight line.     - Given ( angle BQM = angle BAM ), we have ( angle BAM = 180^circ - angle BPQ ). 3. **Establishing the Relationship:**     - Given ( angle NQP = angle NQB = angle ABQ = angle BAM = 180^circ - angle BPM = 180^circ - angle MPQ ), we can infer that the angles across the quadrilateral ( MNQP ) indicate it forms a parallelogram. 4. **Concluding the Result:**    - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal, therefore ( MN = PQ ).

Verify the condition that each vertex of one pyramid must lie in the plane of a face of the other pyramid:    - For the first triangular pyramid ( A B D D_1 ):       - Vertex ( A ) lies on the plane defined by ( A_1 C_1 C ).       - Vertex ( B ) lies on the plane defined by ( B_1 C_1 C ).       - Vertex ( D ) lies on the plane defined by ( A_1 B_1 C ).       - Vertex ( D_1 ) lies on the plane defined by ( A_1 B_1 C_1 ).    - For the second triangular pyramid ( A_1 B_1 C_1 C ):       - Vertex ( A_1 ) lies on the plane defined by ( A D D_1 ).       - Vertex ( B_1 ) lies on the plane defined by ( B D D_1 ).       - Vertex ( C_1 ) lies on the plane defined by ( A B D_1 ).       - Vertex ( C ) lies on the plane defined by ( A B D ). 3.

There are two pairs of lanterns that can be adjacent: the redwood palace lantern and the sandalwood palace lantern, and the nanmu gauze lantern and the huanghuali gauze lantern. **Case 1: Redwood palace lantern and sandalwood palace lantern are adjacent, but nanmu gauze lantern and huanghuali gauze lantern are not.** We treat the redwood palace lantern and the sandalwood palace lantern as a single unit. Along with the congratulations hanging lantern, we now have three units to arrange. This can be done in {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6 ways (since we are arranging 3 distinct items). For the two gauze lanterns (nanmu and huanghuali), they need to be placed in the spaces between these units. There are 3 spaces (before the first unit, between the two units, and after the last unit), and we choose 2 of these spaces to place the gauze lanterns, which can be done in {A}_{3}^{2} = frac{3!}{(3-2)!} = 6 ways. Since the two gauze lanterns are distinct, they can be arranged in {A}_{2}^{2} = 2! = 2 ways within the chosen spaces. Multiplying these together, we get the total number of ways for this case: 6 times 6 times 2 = 72 ways. **Correction in Calculation:** However, the correct calculation for arranging the units and placing the gauze lanterns in this case should be focused on treating the two palace lanterns as a single unit and arranging them with the congratulations hanging lantern, which gives us {A}_{2}^{2}{A}_{2}^{2}{A}_{3}^{2}=24 ways, not 72. This discrepancy arises from a misinterpretation of the arrangement process. The correct approach involves considering the specific arrangements of the lanterns and the spaces between them, leading to 24 ways for this case. **Case 2: Nanmu gauze lantern and huanghuali gauze lantern are adjacent, but redwood palace lantern and sandalwood palace lantern are not.** This case is symmetric to the first case. We treat the nanmu gauze lantern and the huanghuali gauze lantern as a single unit and arrange them with the congratulations hanging lantern. This gives us the same number of arrangements as in the first case, which is {A}_{2}^{2}{A}_{2}^{2}{A}_{3}^{2}=24 ways. **Total Number of Ways:** Adding the number of ways from both cases, we get 24 + 24 = 48 ways.

According to the problem, H is Rs. 8280. Praveen invested his amount for 12 months, while Hari invested his amount for only 7 months (since he joined after 5 months). The profit is divided in the ratio of 2:3, which means for every 2 parts of profit that Praveen gets, Hari gets 3 parts. This ratio should be equal to the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were invested.

The equation of this secant line is y = frac{2sqrt{3}}{pi}x. Since the function y = tan x is concave on the interval (0,frac{pi}{2}), the secant line lies above the graph of y = tan x for x in (0,frac{pi}{6}). This implies that frac{2sqrt{3}}{pi}x > tan x for x in this interval. Specifically, when x = frac{1}{2}, we have frac{sqrt{3}}{pi} > tanfrac{1}{2}, which means c > a. 2. **Comparison between b and c:** Consider the function f(x) = tan x - x for x in (0,frac{pi}{2}). The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = sec^{2}x - 1 = frac{1}{cos^{2}x} - 1. Since cos^{2}x < 1 for x in (0,frac{pi}{2}), it follows that f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing on this interval. Therefore, tan x > x for x in (0,frac{pi}{2}). Given that frac{2}{pi} > frac{sqrt{3}}{pi} (since frac{2}{sqrt{3}} > 1), we conclude that tanfrac{2}{pi} > frac{sqrt{3}}{pi}, which means b > c. Combining the above comparisons, we have b > c > a.

Given that the central angle of this sector is frac{2pi}{3}, we can set up the following equations based on the information: 1. The total surface area of the cone is the sum of the base area and the lateral surface area, which can be expressed as: [S = pi R^2 + frac{frac{2}{3}pi}{2pi} cdot pi a^2 = 36pi] 2.

For the quadratic function x^2-4x+3:    This is a parabola that opens upwards since the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive. The vertex of the parabola can be found by completing the square or using the formula x=-frac{b}{2a} for a quadratic equation in the form ax^2+bx+c.

The inequality f(x) geq a can be rewritten as x^2 + ax + 3 geq a, which simplifies to x^2 + ax + (3 - a) geq 0.        This is a quadratic inequality. To find the values of a for which the inequality holds for all x in mathbb{R}, we look at the discriminant Delta of x^2 + ax + (3 - a). We have Delta = a^2 - 4(1)(3 - a). - For x^2 + ax + (3 - a) to be non-negative for all real x, the discriminant must be non-positive (i.e., Delta leq 0 ), or the function must have no real roots. - We solve a^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (3 - a) leq 0, which gives a^2 - 4a + 12 leq 0. Factoring yields (a - 2)^2 + 8 geq 0, which is true for all a in mathbb{R}. - Since the inequality (a - 2)^2 + 8 geq 0 is always true, the coefficient a does not restrict the condition based on the discriminant. - However, since a quadratic function is only always non-negative if its leading coefficient is positive and its discriminant is non-positive, we need to ensure that a^2 - 4a + 12 leq 0 does not have real roots. - In this case, a^2 - 4a + 12 never equals zero because the minimum value of (a - 2)^2 is zero, making the smallest possible value of (a - 2)^2 + 8 equal to 8. Thus, the quadratic function x^2 + ax + (3 - a) is always positive. - Therefore, the step requiring Delta leq 0 is redundant, so the range of a must be such that the constant term (3-a) is non-negative. - We now require that 3 - a geq 0, which implies a leq 3. - Hence, for this inequality to hold for all x in mathbb{R}, a must be less than or equal to 3.    The range of a is boxed{(-infty, 3]}. 2. For the case when x in [-2, 2], we must consider the minimum value of the quadratic function within this closed interval. - To find this minimum value, we can either complete the square or use calculus. We use calculus here. - We find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = 2x + a. - Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us the critical point: 2x + a = 0 or x = -frac{a}{2}. - This critical point will give us a minimum value within the interval [-2, 2] as long as -frac{a}{2} is in the interval.

This simplifies to -4 leq a leq 4. - For a within [-4, 4], we substitute x = -frac{a}{2} into f(x) to get the minimum value. - We have fleft(-frac{a}{2}right) = left(-frac{a}{2}right)^2 + aleft(-frac{a}{2}right) + 3 = frac{a^2}{4} - frac{a^2}{2} + 3 = frac{-a^2}{4} + 3. - Now, for the inequality f(x) geq a to hold, we must have frac{-a^2}{4} + 3 geq a. - Solving for a, we get -a^2 + 12 geq 4a, which simplifies to a^2 + 4a - 12 leq 0. - Factoring gives (a + 6)(a - 2) leq 0.

The line segment MN divides the area of the quadrilateral into two equal parts. 3. Segment NM is the median of triangle BNC (as M is the midpoint of BC). Therefore, by the property of medians in a triangle, we have: [ S_{BMN} = S_{CMN} ] 4. Similarly, by the condition AD = 2BC, and since segment NM divides the quadrilateral into two equal areas, we conclude that: [ S_{ABN} = S_{DCN} ] 5. Since triangles ABN and DCN share a common segment AN = DN, the areas of these triangles are equal if their bases and corresponding heights are equal.

In this pattern, color the cells such that adjacent cells have different colors.    - In such a (5 times 5) grid, there will be 13 cells of one color and 12 cells of the other color.    - When you remove one cell from the grid, you affect the balance between the two colors:       [       text{13 cells of one color, 11 cells of the other color}       ]    - If (i) and (j) are both odd, the removed square always affects one of the cells that maintains the required balance between the two colors. 2. **Constructive Method for Sufficiency**:        - For sufficiency, if both (i) and (j) are odd, construct a valid tiling for the remaining cells:    - Notice that for every (5 times 5) grid with one cell removed in such a way, you can always find a tiling pattern. For example, the following logical tiles can be placed:      - Consider removing an odd cell from an odd row and odd column. The central symmetry around the grid's midpoint simplifies this, allowing dominoes to be placed strategically, ensuring all spaces are covered without overlaps.          Here is a visualization approach:    1. **Step-by-Step Tiling Construction**:      - One possible method is dividing the remaining cells into smaller rectangles or strips that can be completely covered by (1 times 2) dominoes.      - [        text{Example pattern}:         begin{array}{ccccc}        D & D & E & E & E        D & F & F & G & G        H & F & I & J & J        H & K & I & L & M        K & K & N & L & M        end{array}        ] 3. **Reasoning**:          The need for (i) and (j) to be odd ensures that the removal of a single cell from the specific pattern, leaving an odd number of cells, can always be covered by dominoes given the intrinsic properties of domino-shaped covers in discrete tiling problems of grid setups like this. **Conclusion**: The conditions of (i) and (j) being odd: [ boxed{i,j text{ are odd.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Show that for a triangle, if the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:  frac{a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}}{a+b+c} = c^{2} and sin alpha sin beta = sin^2 gamma  the triangle is equilateral.","output":"To show that a triangle is equilateral if the given conditions hold simultaneously, we will follow these steps. 1. **Replace (sin alpha sin beta = sin^2 gamma)**:    The sine of the angles in a triangle are proportional to the lengths of the opposite sides.

We can write:    [    P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0    ]    where (a_i) are integer coefficients. 2. **Analyze the behavior of (P(x) - P(y)):**    The expression (P(x) - P(y)) can be factored using the polynomial remainder theorem:    [    P(x) - P(y) = (x - y) Q(x, y)    ]    where (Q(x, y)) is a polynomial in (x) and (y) with integer coefficients. 3. **Infinitely many solutions condition:**    For (P(x) - P(y) = d) to have infinitely many solutions in integers (x) and (y) with (x neq y), the polynomial (Q(x, y)) must be such that the equation ((x - y) Q(x, y) = d) holds for infinitely many pairs ((x, y)). 4. **Degree analysis:**    - If (n geq 2), then as (|x|) or (|y|) becomes large, the term ((x - y) Q(x, y)) grows without bound because (Q(x, y)) is a polynomial of degree (n-1) in (x) and (y). This implies that (|P(x) - P(y)|) becomes unbounded, which contradicts the requirement that (P(x) - P(y) = d) for a fixed integer (d). Therefore, (n) cannot be 2 or higher.    - If (n = 1), then (P(x)) is a linear polynomial. Let (P(x) = ax + b). Then:      [      P(x) - P(y) = a(x - y)      ]      For this to equal (d), we need:      [      a(x - y) = d      ]      This equation has infinitely many solutions in integers (x) and (y) if and only if (a) divides (d). Let (d = ka) for some integer (k). Then:      [      P(x) - P(y) = ka      ]      This is satisfied for any (x) and (y) such that (x - y = k). 5. **Special case (n = 0):**    - If (n = 0), then (P(x)) is a constant polynomial. Let (P(x) = c). Then:      [      P(x) - P(y) = c - c = 0      ]      This implies (d = 0). Conclusion: - If (P(x)) is a constant polynomial, then (P(x) = c) and (d = 0). - If (P(x)) is a linear polynomial, then (P(x) = ax + b) and (d = ka) for some integer (k).

Now, we are told that the ratio of bleach to detergent is tripled. This means the new ratio of bleach to detergent will be 3 : 10 (since 1 * 3 = 3).

This involves flattening the cuboid by laying out adjacent faces: the front face, side face, and the top face. 4. **Considering the Distance:**    The straight-line distance across these faces in the unfolded cuboid will be the shortest path. This can correspond to moving from (A) to (A') where (A') is the projection of (A) on the opposite face, then move to (C_{1}). 5. **Computation:**    We compute the coordinates of the involved points with respect to (A):    - (A = (0, 0, 0))    - (C_{1} = (b, c, a))    When the cuboid is unfolded, the path looks like:    [    A to B to C_{1}    ]    We need the shortest distance which can be computed as ( sqrt{a^2 + (b + c)^2} ).    The reason is that by unfolding, the distance between points (A) and (C_{1}) on the same face minimizes the travel distance as compared to traveling over more than one face.    Therefore, the unfolded straight distance is:    [    d = sqrt{(a)^2 + (b + c)^2}    ]        [    d = sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2bc}    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    The shortest distance from (A) to (C_{1}) along the surfaces of the cuboid is given by:    [    sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2bc}.    ] Hence, the correct option is: [ boxed{mathrm{C}} ]"},{"instruction":"Triangle GHI is similar to triangle XYZ.

Let's denote the earnings of one man as M, one woman as W, and one boy as B. Then we have: 5M = 8B Since the total earnings are Rs. 210, we can write: 5M + 8B = Rs. 210 But we know that 5M = 8B, so we can replace 8B with 5M in the equation: 5M + 5M = Rs. 210 10M = Rs. 210 Now, we can solve for the earnings of one man (M): M = Rs. 210 / 10 M = Rs. 21 Therefore, the wages of one man are Rs. 21, and since there are 5 men, the total wages for the men would be: 5 men * Rs. 21/man = Rs. 105 So, the men's wages are Rs. boxed{105} ."},{"instruction":"Brenda's mother made cookies for guests.

It's given these points are already placed on the line, and we perform the described operation. 2. **Operation Description**:     - Between each pair of adjacent points, one additional point is inserted.    - This implies that if there are ( n ) points, there will be exactly ( n-1 ) gaps between these points where new points can be inserted. 3. **After 1st Operation**:     - After the first operation, we had ( n ) initial points and ( n - 1 ) new points inserted.    - Therefore, the new total number of points becomes:      [      n + (n - 1) = 2n - 1      ]    - Notice that ( 2n - 1 ) is always odd because twice any integer is even, and subtracting one from an even number gives you an odd number. 4. **Subsequent Operations**:    - Let's consider another operation applied to the new total number of points, now ( 2n - 1).    - Between each pair of adjacent points again we insert one point. Since there are ( 2n - 1 ) points, there will be ( (2n - 1) - 1 ) gaps where new points can be inserted.    - Hence, the number of new points inserted is ( 2n - 2 ). Adding these to the existing points gives:      [      (2n - 1) + (2n - 2) = 4n - 3      ]    - Once again, ( 4n - 3 ) is odd because ( 4n ) is even and subtracting 3 from an even number results in an odd number. 5. **Induction Step**:    - To generalize, suppose the total number of points after the ( k )-th operation is always odd. Consider the ( (k+1) )-th operation.    - If after ( k )-th operation, we have an odd number of points ( M ) then ( M ) can be written as ( 2m + 1 ) for some integer ( m ).    - The number of gaps between these points is ( 2m ), which is even.    - Number of points after the ( (k+1) )-th operation becomes:      [      M + (M - 1) = (2m + 1) + (2m) = 4m + 1      ]    - Thus, ( 4m + 1 ) is odd. 6. **Conclusion**:    - By mathematical induction, we have shown that if the number of points is initially ( n ) and if we repeatedly perform the operation described, the number of points will always remain odd after every operation.

Without loss of generality, we can assume these integers to be in ascending order:    [    0 leq a_1 leq cdots leq a_{2n-1} leq n - 1.    ] 2. **Define new variables based on the given integers.**    Define ( b_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ) as follows:    [    b_i = a_{n+i} - a_i.    ]    These new variables ( b_i ) represent the differences between second half and first half of the increasingly ordered integers. 3. **Consider sums involving the new variables ( b_i ).**    Now, let's consider the sum:    [    S = sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i + sum_{i=1}^{s} epsilon_i b_i,    ]    where ( epsilon_i ) can be either (0) or (1).  4. **Use the pigeonhole principle:**    Since we have ( b_i neq 0 ), the values of ( b_i ) are non-zero integers. Note that there are ( s = n - 1 ) ( b_i )s which are also integers mod ( n ).  5. **Analyze the possible sums modulo ( n ).**    There are ( 2^{n-1} ) ways to choose the ( epsilon_i ) (either 0 or 1). Given that there are ( n ) possible remainders modulo ( n ), by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these sums (from the ( 2^{n-1} ) possible sums) must be equivalent modulo ( n ), i.e., there exist distinct set of ( epsilon )'s, say ( {epsilon_i} ) and ( {epsilon'_i} ) such that:    [    sum_{i=1}^n a_i + sum_{i=1}^s epsilon_i b_i equiv sum_{i=1}^n a_i + sum_{i=1}s epsilon'_i b_i  (text{mod } n).    ] 6. **Subtract the equivalent sums:**    Let’s subtract the above equivalences:    [    sum_{i=1}s (epsilon_i - epsilon'_i) b_i equiv 0  (text{mod } n).    ]    This means the selected ( epsilon_i ) values, when subtracted, yield a sum of multiples of ( b_i ) that is a multiple of ( n ). 7. **Construct subset whose sum is divisible by ( n ):**    Let’s construct the set of size ( n ) as follows:     Choose ( n ) integers among the original ( 2n-1 ) based on the ( epsilon_i ) which result in a sum divisible by ( n ).  Conclusion: By the principle above and based on the construction, we can always select ( n ) integers from the given ( 2n-1 ) integers such that their sum is divisible by ( n ).

Therefore, both angles measure 50^circ each. Using the triangle angle sum property, the measure of the third angle, which is the vertex angle, is calculated as follows: 180^circ - 50^circ - 50^circ = 80^circ.  To find the length of the base of the triangle, let's denote the base as ( c ) and use the Law of Sines, which relates the sides of a triangle with its angles: frac{a}{sin A} = frac{c}{sin C}, where A = 50^circ, a = 10 (length of equal sides), and C = 80^circ (vertex angle). Solving for ( c ): c = frac{a cdot sin C}{sin A} = frac{10 cdot sin 80^circ}{sin 50^circ}.  Using approximate values for sine calculations, sin 80^circ approx 0.9848, quad sin 50^circ approx 0.7660,  c approx frac{10 cdot 0.9848}{0.7660} approx 12.862.

The cost to repair each tire is 7, so for all 4 tires, the cost would be: 4 tires x 7/tire = 28 Now we know that the final cost, including sales tax, is 30. To find the total sales tax amount, we subtract the cost before tax from the final cost: 30 (final cost) - 28 (cost before tax) = 2 (total sales tax) To find the sales tax for each tire, we divide the total sales tax by the number of tires: 2 (total sales tax) / 4 tires = 0.50 per tire So, the sales tax for each tire is boxed{0.50} ."},{"instruction":"There are 90 children in a chess club.

This constant is called the \\"common difference,\\" denoted as (d). 2. **General Term**: The (n)-th term of an arithmetic progression can be expressed as:     [     a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d     ]     where (a_1) is the first term and (d) is the common difference. 3. **Sign Changes**: In an arithmetic progression:     - If the common difference (d) is positive and the first term (a_1) is positive, all terms will remain positive.     - If (d) is negative and (a_1) is positive, the terms will eventually turn negative after a certain number of terms, but will do so only once and continue remaining negative (the same applies vice versa).     Therefore, the sign of terms in an arithmetic progression changes at most once. You will have a block of positive terms followed by a block of negative terms, or vice versa.  Geometric Progression (GP): 1. **Definition**: A geometric progression is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the \\"common ratio,\\" denoted as (r). 2. **General Term**: The (n)-th term of a geometric progression can be expressed as:     [     a_n = a_1 cdot r^{n-1}     ]     where (a_1) is the first term and (r) is the common ratio. 3. **Sign Changes**: In a geometric progression:     - If the common ratio (r) is positive, all terms have the same sign as the first term (a_1).     - If the common ratio (r) is negative, the signs of the terms will alternate. That is, positive, negative, positive, negative, and so forth.          Therefore, a geometric progression can have its terms alternating between positive and negative if (r) is negative. # Conclusion: In summary, the difference in the arrangement of positive and negative terms in arithmetic and geometric progressions is as follows: - **Arithmetic Progression**: The sign of the terms changes at most once throughout the sequence. - **Geometric Progression**: The sign of the terms alternates from one term to the next if the common ratio is negative.

To prove angle CPA = angle DPT, we need to examine certain properties of the geometric figures involved. 3. First, draw the line PO and extend it to intersect the circle O at point E. Note that PE perp PC because P and E are on the circle and OE=OP (radii of the circle). 4. Connect the points E to C and E to D. These will be useful to explore the properties of the quadrilateral CPED and triangle CPE. 5. Extend PA to intersect CE at point F. 6.

Consequently, PF is half of CE, and therefore CF = PF and angle FCP = angle FPC (by the properties of the median in a right triangle). 7. Since PE is perpendicular to PC and as CA = BD, we know that CD is parallel to PE, making CPDE a parallelogram.  8.

Prove your statement as well! Is there anything objectionable in this procedure? If so, how can the program be corrected?","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Variable Assignment**:    - The given program determines the final value of \`A\` when \`N\` and the initial value of \`B\` are provided.     - We start by examining the assignment: If \`N ≤ 0\`, the program sets \`A\` to 1 regardless of the initial value of \`B\`. 2. **Operations Based on Positive \`N\`**:    - If \`N > 0\`, the program repeatedly divides \`N\` by 2 until \`N\` becomes 0. This process effectively counts the number of divisions or, equivalently, the number of bits in the binary representation of \`N\`.    - Concurrently, each time \`N\` is divided by 2, \`B\` is squared. 3. **Detailed Description of Procedure**:     - By understanding the repeated squaring (exponentiation by squaring) method, we infer that if 2^{k} leq mathrm{N} < 2^{k+1}, the number of iterations (or divisions) required until \`N\` becomes 0 is k+1.     - Each iteration squares the current value of \`B\`.     - Through repeated squaring, after k+1 steps, B transforms into its 2^{k+1}-th power. 4. **Effect on \`A\`**:    - During this iterative process, whenever the current value of \`N\` is odd, \`A\` is multiplied by the current value of \`B\` (which is the result of squaring in previous steps).    - Therefore, by the end of the iterations, the value stored in \`A\` will be the product of those values of \`B\` (at various steps) when \`N\` at that step was odd.  5. **Final Value Calculation**:    - Given that \`B\` is continually squared, the final product in \`A\` will represent B raised to the power of \`N, computed through the binary expansion of \`N where multiplication corresponds to the bits of \`1\`. 6. **Conclusion**:    - The final value of \`A\` is B^N, correctly computed through the outlined iterative squaring and multiplication procedure.    - The presented issue is the potential overwriting the original values of \`B\` and \`N\`, which might not be desirable in some contexts. 7. **Corrective Measures**:     - To prevent the alteration of the input values, the initial parts of the code should be modified to use local variables for computations:     \`\`\`fortran     SUBROUTINE SS(A, BB, NN)     B = BB     N = NN     \`\`\`     - This ensures that the original values of \`B\` and \`N\` remain unchanged, addressing potential side effects. # Conclusion: The operations performed by the program efficiently calculate B raised to the power of N using repeated squaring, with the optimal number of operations.

This follows from the fact that (angle AKC = angle DKB) and (angle KAC = angle KBD), both quadrilateral (ABCD) being inscribed, the opposite angles (angle KAC) and (angle KBD) are supplementary. 4.

Moreover, the angle (angle AKM) and (angle DKN) are equal, since (MK) and (KN) are medians and the triangles are similar.

Prove that (a) if a chessboard polygon can be tiled by dominoes, then it can be done so tastefully, and (b) such a tasteful tiling is unique.","output":"Proof of (a): 1. **Inductive Hypothesis and Base Case**:    - Let mathcal{P} denote a chessboard polygon which can be tiled by dominoes.    - Consider a lower-left square s of the polygon. Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume s is white. The proof for the black square is similar.     2. **Case Analysis**:    - **Case 1**: Suppose there exists a domino tiling of mathcal{P} where s is covered by a vertical domino.      - **Action**: Delete this vertical domino.      - **Induction Step**: Apply the inductive hypothesis to the remaining part of mathcal{P}.      - **Observation**: This additional vertical domino will not cause any distasteful tiling configurations.    - **Case 2**: Suppose s is covered by a horizontal domino in every tiling.      - **Action**: Delete this horizontal domino.      - **Induction Step**: Apply the inductive hypothesis to the remaining part of mathcal{P}.      - **Important Detail**: In the resulting tasteful tiling, there should not be another horizontal domino adjacent to the one covering s. If there were, we could replace that 2 times 2 area with two vertical dominoes, reverting back to the first case, which is already proven. 3. **Remark**:     - The second case can actually arise in practice. Hence, one cannot guarantee the tiling of s with a vertical domino. Therefore, detailed case differentiation is required.    - Algorithmic Perspective: When encountering a distasteful tiling, rotate the dominoes to avoid the bad pattern. The bottom-left corner will eventually stabilize through these adjustments.  Proof of (b): 1. **Assumption for Contradiction**:    - Suppose, for contradiction, there exist two distinct tasteful tilings of the same chessboard polygon mathcal{P}.     2. **Overlaying the Tilings**:    - Overlay the two distinct tasteful tilings.    - Result: Several cycles of overlapping dominoes appear at the positions where the tilings differ. 3. **Lattice Framework**:    - Work within the lattice mathbb{Z}^{2}. Treat squares as black/white points.    - Let gamma be any such cycle. Let s denote a lower-left point in gamma. WLOG, assume s is black.    - Orient gamma counterclockwise.    - Focus on the lattice polygon mathcal{Q} enclosed by gamma. 4. **Covering Dominoes**:    - In one tiling of mathcal{Q}, point s is covered by a horizontal domino. In the other tiling, s is covered by a vertical domino.    - From this point, focus on the tiling where s is covered by a vertical domino. 5. **Stair-Case Sequence**:    - Set coordinates so s = (0,0).    - Define a stair-case sequence of points: ( p_{0} = s = (0,0), p_{1} = (1,0), p_{2} = (1,1), p_{3} = (2,1), ldots ).    - **Observation**:       - ( p_{0} ) is covered by a vertical domino.      - ( p_{1} ) must be covered by a horizontal domino to avoid a distasteful tiling.      - If ( p_{2} ) is in mathcal{Q}, it must be covered by a vertical domino, and so on.    - This pattern continues while points ( p_{i} ) remain inside mathcal{Q}. 6. **Intersection Argument**:    - The curve gamma must cross ( y = x-1 ) at the point ( b = (1,0) ).    - Let ( a ) denote the first point of the sequence after ( p_{1} ) where gamma crosses ( y = x-1 ) again.    - The point ( a ) is tiled by a vertical domino with a black point to the right of the line ( ell ) formed by ( y = x-1 ).    - The line segment ( ell ) cuts mathcal{Q} into two parts, and (gamma)’s orientation indicates that it must enter from the right, contradicting the properties laid out. 7. **Conclusion**:    - The assumed existence of two distinct tasteful tilings leads to a contradiction.

[    z_{1} + z_{2} + z_{3} + z_{4} = 0    ] 3. **Vector Representation**: In the complex plane, (z_i) can be represented as vectors from the origin. The sum being zero implies that the vector sum of these four vectors is zero, which can be interpreted geometrically as these vectors forming the sides of a closed shape polygon. 4. **Zero Sum Implication**: For the sum of vectors to be zero, the vectors must pair up such that their combined effect cancels out. Considering that all (z_i) lie on the unit circle and the sum is zero, points must be symmetrically placed about the origin. 5. **Symmetry Argument**: Given the unit magnitudes and the zero sum condition, this symmetry suggests that opposite vertices of the quadrilateral formed by (z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4) must pair off to form diameters of the circle. Thus, each pair of opposite complex numbers are symmetric about the origin. 6. **Conclusion**: This symmetry and the fact that these points lie on a unit circle such that the pairwise sums balance out to zero imply that the quadrilateral formed is a **rectangle**.

We are interested in calculating the ratio of diagonal AB (shorter diagonal connecting adjacent vertices) to diagonal AC (longer diagonal skipping one vertex). 1. The measure of an interior angle of a regular octagon is frac{180^circ(8-2)}{8} = 135^circ.  2. Therefore, angle BCA is 135^circ/2 = 67.5^circ, and the other two angles in triangle ABC, which are base angles of this isosceles triangle, each measure (180^circ - 135^circ)/2 = 22.5^circ. Thus, triangle ABC is isosceles but not a right triangle. However, to find the ratio of AB to AC, we consider the entire octagon and symmetry: - All sides of the octagon are equal, let's denote each side as s. - Using the Cosine Law in triangle ABC:   [   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 cdot AB cdot BC cdot cos(135^circ)   ]   With AB = BC = s and cos(135^circ) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}:   [   AC^2 = s^2 + s^2 - 2 cdot s cdot s cdot left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = 2s^2 + s^2sqrt{2}   ]   [   AC = ssqrt{2 + sqrt{2}}   ] 3. Hence, the ratio frac{AB}{AC} is:   [   frac{AB}{AC} = frac{s}{ssqrt{2+sqrt{2}}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2+sqrt{2}}}   ] Conclusion: The ratio of the shorter diagonal to the longer diagonal in a regular octagon is boxed{frac{1}{sqrt{2+sqrt{2}}}}."},{"instruction":"Given that one root of the equation x^{2}bx+3=0 is 3, then the other root of the equation is ____.","output":"Given the quadratic equation x^{2}-bx+3=0 and knowing that one of its roots is 3, we aim to find the other root, denoted as m.

The faster train passes the slower train in 45 seconds. What is the length of each train (in meters)?","output":"Let's denote the length of each train as L meters. Since the trains are of equal length and the faster train is overtaking the slower one, we can consider the relative speed between the two trains. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds because they are moving in the same direction. Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 75 km/hr - 60 km/hr Relative speed = 15 km/hr To work with meters and seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We know that 1 km/hr is equivalent to 5/18 m/s. Relative speed in m/s = 15 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed in m/s = (15 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed in m/s = (5/6) * 5 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 25/6 m/s Now, we know that the faster train takes 45 seconds to pass the slower train completely. This means that in 45 seconds, the faster train covers a distance equal to the length of both trains (since they are of equal length). Distance covered in 45 seconds = Relative speed * Time Distance covered in 45 seconds = (25/6) m/s * 45 s Distance covered in 45 seconds = (25/6) * 45 m Distance covered in 45 seconds = 25 * 45 / 6 m Distance covered in 45 seconds = 25 * 7.5 m Distance covered in 45 seconds = 187.5 m This distance is the combined length of both trains, so the length of each train is half of this distance.

The symmetric point of (A) over (DE) lies on (BC). We need to find the locus of point (P), which is the intersection of the circles with diameters (AD) and (AE), as (DE) varies. 2. **Identifying Point (P):**    Point (P) is the intersection of the circles with diameters (AD) and (AE). This implies that (P) lies on the perpendicular bisectors of (AD) and (AE). Therefore, (P) is the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to (DE). 3. **Midpoints and Symmetry:**    Let (M) and (N) be the midpoints of (AB) and (AC) respectively. Consider any point (P') on the line segment (MN). The reflection of (A) over (P') will always lie on (BC). This is because (MN) is the midline of triangle (ABC), and the reflection of (A) over any point on (MN) will lie on the line parallel to (BC) through the midpoint of (BC). 4. **Constructing (D') and (E'):**    Let (D') and (E') be the intersections of the line through (P') perpendicular to (AP') with (AB) and (AC) respectively. As (P') varies along (MN), the line (D'E') also varies. Since (P') is the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to (D'E'), (P') is the same as (P). 5. **Conclusion:**    As (P') varies along (MN), the line (D'E') changes accordingly, and (P') remains the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to (D'E').

Suppose we select any vertex of T as the root, denoted by r. We define a partial order on the vertex set V(T) such that x leqslant y if and only if x is on the unique path from r to y. This partial order helps to conceptualize T in terms of \\"levels\\" and \\"heights\\":        - The _height_ of a vertex x is its distance from the root r.    - The set of vertices at the same height (distance from the root) forms a _level_ of T. 2. **Using Closures:**    - The _down-closure_ (or lower closure) of a vertex y, denoted as lceil y rceil, is the set {x mid x leqslant y}.    - The _up-closure_ (or upper closure) of a vertex x, denoted as lfloor x rfloor, is the set {y mid y geqslant x}.    If X subseteq V(T) such that X = lfloor X rfloor := bigcup_{x in X} lfloor x rfloor, then X is up-closed (or an _up-set_). Similarly, we define _down-closed_ (or down-set). 3. **Tree-Order and Graph Structure:**    The root r is the smallest element in the tree-order, while the leaves are the largest. For each edge in T, the two endpoints are comparable in this order. In simpler terms, if there’s an edge (u, v) in T, then either u leq v or v leq u.    A rooted tree T is said to be _normal_ in G if for every two vertices adjacent in G, they are comparable in the tree T. For the tree T to be supported by G, any two adjacent vertices in G must be comparable in T. 4. **Argument for Subgraph:**    Given that G has a minimum degree of delta(G) geq |T| - 1, it means that G is sufficiently connected to contain a tree structure of size |T|. We will construct T in G by ensuring the conditions of connectivity and the comparability of vertices are met.    Key in this reasoning is that from every vertex in G, we can explore at least |T| - 1 other vertices. This redundancy allows us to \\"embed\\" the entire structure of T within G step by step, ensuring that all conditions and relationships of vertices in T hold true in G too. 5. **Conclusion:**    By utilizing the properties of tree-order and the sufficiently high minimum degree condition of G, we find a copy of T within G. This embedding respects the adjacency and comparability constraints, making it isomorphic to T. Thus, T subseteq G. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given that a and b are unit vectors, and a cdot b = frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, the equation of ellipse C is boxed{frac{x^2}{3} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1}.

To find the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [0,2], we set the derivative equal to zero:    [    f'(x) = 3x^{2}-1 = 0 implies x^{2} = frac{1}{3} implies x = pm frac{sqrt{3}}{3}.    ]    Checking the values of f(x) at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval:    [    f(0) = 0^{3}-0 = 0, quad fleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{3}right) text{ is a local minimum}, quad f(2) = 2^{3}-2 = 6.    ]    Hence, the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [0,2] is boxed{6}. 3. To prove there exists a unique x_{0} such that f(x_{0})=g(x_{0}), we consider the function h(x) = f(x) - g(x) = x^{3} - 3x + 3. Its derivative is:    [    h'(x) = 3x^{2} - 3 = 3(x^{2} - 1) = 3(x - 1)(x + 1).    ]    Setting h'(x) = 0 gives x = pm 1.

Since h(1) = 1 > 0 and h(-3) = -15 < 0, there must be a unique zero of h(x) in (-infty, -1), denoted as x_{0}. Therefore, there exists a unique x_{0} such that f(x_{0}) = g(x_{0}), which is boxed{text{True}}."},{"instruction":"f a nonempty set M satisfies that for any x, yin M, x+yin M and xyin M, then M is called an excellent set.

Since the sequence is bounded above, there exists some real number M such that a_n leqslant M for all n. 2. **Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem**:    According to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (stated in problem 25.11), every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence. Consequently, {a_n} must have at least one limit point, say c. 3. **Uniqueness of the Limit Point**:    Suppose for the sake of contradiction that {a_n} has two distinct limit points, c_1 and c_2, where c_1 < c_2. Define varepsilon = c_2 - c_1 > 0. 4. **Choosing N**:    According to the definition of a limit point, for varepsilon/2, there must exist an N such that:    [    |a_N - c_2| < frac{varepsilon}{2}    ]    Therefore,    [    a_N > c_2 - frac{varepsilon}{2}    ] 5. **Behavior of the sequence**:    Since the sequence {a_n} is non-decreasing, it follows that for all n geqslant N:    [    a_n > c_2 - frac{varepsilon}{2}    ] 6. **Contradiction**:    This implies:    [    a_n - c_1 > (c_2 - frac{varepsilon}{2}) - c_1 = frac{varepsilon}{2}    ]    However, this contradicts the assumption that c_1 is a limit point since a_n cannot converge to c_1. Hence, c_1 cannot be a limit point. 7. **Convergence**:    Let c be the limit point of the sequence. Since {a_n} is non-decreasing and bounded above by M, a_n must converge to c. Thus, for every varepsilon >0, there exists an N such that:    [    c - varepsilon < a_N leqslant c    ]    Which implies:    [    c - varepsilon < a_n leqslant c quad text{for all} quad n geqslant N    ] 8. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, any increasing (or at least non-decreasing) sequence {a_n} that is bounded above has a limit.

For even-length blocks, pair all nonzero digits. For odd-length blocks, use one of the zeros from the right border to pair with the last nonzero digit.

In other words, ( S ) has at most four nonzero digits.    - **Proof of Main Claim:**      - Define:        [        X = sum_i (a_i + b_i), quad Y = sum_i (10a_i + b_i).        ]      - It is easy to see that ( Y ge 1.9X ), so the two leading digits of ( Y ) and ( X ) are different.

However, verification shows ( x = 1 ) is not a root of the characteristic polynomial, leading to a contradiction. 5. Consequently, all roots ( x_i (1 leq i leq t) ) have moduli less than 1.

We aim to transform this partition into one containing only odd parts. 2. **Step-by-Step Transformation:**    - Consider the partition of ( n ) into distinct parts: ( n = q_1 + q_2 + ldots + q_r ), where ( q_1, q_2, ldots, q_r ) are distinct.    - For each part ( q_i ), if it is even, it can be written as ( q_i = 2^k m ) with ( m ) being odd.    - Replace ( 2^k m ) with ( 2^k ) parts, each of size ( m ). 3. **Constructing the Odd Partition:**    - After transforming every even ( q_i ) into ( 2^k ) parts of size ( m ), we get a new partition of ( n ) into odd parts.    - This new partition only contains odd parts because ( m ) is odd. 4. **Example Calculation:**    - Suppose ( n = 10 ) and it is partitioned into distinct parts ( {6, 3, 1} ).    - ( 6 ) is even and can be written as ( 6 = 2 cdot 3 ).    - Replace ( 6 ) with two 3's: ( {3, 3, 3, 1} ).    - The new partition ( {3, 3, 3, 1} ) is entirely composed of odd parts. 5. **Reconstructing the Original Partition:**    - Given the partition of ( n ) into odd parts ( q'_1, q'_2, ldots, q'_s ), each part ( q_j ) representable as ( m ) (odd), combine ( q_j ) appropriately.    - If a certain part ( m ) appears ( l ) times, write ( l ) as a sum of distinct powers of two, ( l = 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_2} + ldots + 2^{k_s} ) (known from binary representation).    - Form original distinct even parts back by calculating ( 2^{k_i} m ). 6. **Dual Nature of the Correspondence:**    - This transformation ensures a bijection (one-to-one and onto function) between the partitions of ( n ) must keep properties:      - Any partition into distinct parts can be uniquely transformed into a partition with only odd parts.      - Vice versa, any partition composed solely of odd parts can be recovered uniquely into a partition with distinct parts. # Conclusion: Thus, the mutually exclusive one-to-one correspondence between the partitions of a natural number ( n ) into distinct parts and into odd parts is established.

We need to find the functions ( g ) and ( h ) that satisfy the given conditions. 2. **Initial conditions:**    - ( x in f(y) Leftrightarrow y in f(x) )    - ( |x - y| > 2 Leftrightarrow f(x) cap f(y) = varnothing )    - For all real numbers ( 0 leq r leq 1 ), ( f(r) = [r^2 - 1, r^2 + 1] ) 3. **Lemma:**    ( f(x) ) cannot be a subset of ( f(y) ) if ( x neq y ).    **Proof:**    Assume for contradiction that ( f(x) subseteq f(y) ) for ( x neq y ). Without loss of generality, assume ( x < y ). Select ( a ) such that ( x - 2 < a < min(x, y - 2) ). Then ( f(a) cap f(y) = varnothing ) because ( |a - y| > 2 ). It follows that ( f(a) cap f(x) = varnothing ) because ( f(x) subseteq f(y) ). However, ( 0 < x - a < 2 ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( f(x) ) cannot be a subset of ( f(y) ) if ( x neq y ). 4. **Base Case:**    For ( 0 leq x leq 1 ), we have ( f(x) = [x^2 - 1, x^2 + 1] ). Thus, ( g(x) = x^2 - 1 ) and ( h(x) = x^2 + 1 ). 5. **Inductive Step:**    Assume ( g ) and ( h ) are defined for ( [n, n+1] ) and satisfy the properties:    - ( h(x) = g(x) + 2 = g(x + 2) )    - ( h(g(x)) = g(h(x)) = x )    We need to extend these properties to ( [n+1, n+2] ). 6. **Define ( g ) and ( h ) for ( [n+1, n+2] ):**    - For ( x in [n+1, n+2] ), we need to find ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) such that the properties hold. 7. **Prove ( g(1 + x) = sqrt{x} ):**    Note that ( 1 + x in f(sqrt{x}) ), which implies ( sqrt{x} in f(1 + x) ). Therefore, ( g(1 + x) leq sqrt{x} ).    For any ( epsilon > 0 ), ( 1 + x notin f(sqrt{x - epsilon}) ). Therefore, ( sqrt{x - epsilon} notin f(1 + x) ) for any ( epsilon > 0 ), so ( g(1 + x) = sqrt{x} ). 8. **Prove ( h(x - 1) = sqrt{x} ) for ( 0 leq x leq 1 ):**    Similarly, we can prove ( h(x - 1) = sqrt{x} ). 9. **Prove ( g(2 + x) = h(x) ) for ( 0 leq x leq 1 ):**    First, ( f(2 + x) cap f(x) neq emptyset ). Therefore, ( g(2 + x) leq h(x) ) and ( h(2 + x) geq g(x) ).    For any ( epsilon > 0 ), ( f(2 + x) cap f(x - epsilon) = varnothing ). Therefore, either ( h(2 + x) < g(x - epsilon) ) or ( h(x - epsilon) < g(2 + x) ).    Since ( h(2 + x) geq g(x) > g(x - epsilon) ), we can see that ( h(x - epsilon) < g(2 + x) ). Therefore, ( (x - epsilon)^2 + 1 < g(2 + x) leq x^2 + 1 ), which implies ( g(2 + x) = h(x) ). 10. **Prove ( h(1 + x) = h(x - 1) + 2 ):**     By our lemma, we can see ( h(1 + x) > h(1) = 2 ). Since ( h(1 + x) in f(1 + x) ), ( x + 1 geq g(h(1 + x)) ) and ( 1 + x leq h(h(1 + x)) ).     Furthermore, since ( h(1 + x) notin f(1 + x - epsilon) ), it follows that ( 1 + x - epsilon notin f(h(1 + x)) ), so either ( 1 + x - epsilon < g(h(1 + x)) ) or ( 1 + x - epsilon > h(h(1 + x)) ).     However, ( h(h(1 + x)) geq 1 + x ), so ( 1 + x - epsilon < g(h(1 + x)) ) for any ( epsilon ). It follows that ( g(h(1 + x)) = 1 + x ) for all ( 0 leq x leq 1 ). Since ( g ) is injective and ( g(2 + sqrt{x}) = h(sqrt{x}) = 1 + x ), it follows ( h(1 + x) = 2 + sqrt{x} ). 11. **Inductive Step:**     Assume ( g(n - 1 + x), h(n - 1 + x), g(n + x) ) follow rules 2 and 3. Then we will prove that ( h(n + x), g(n + 1 + x) ) follow these rules as well.     First, ( f(n + 1 + x) cap f(n - 1 - x) neq emptyset ). Hence, it follows that ( g(n + 1 + x) leq h(n - 1 + x) ) and ( h(n + 1 + x) geq g(n - 1 + x) ).     However, for any ( epsilon ), we can see ( f(n + 1 + x) cap f(n - 1 + x - epsilon) = varnothing ), so it follows that ( g(n + 1 + x) > h(n - 1 + x - epsilon) ) or ( h(n + 1 + x) < g(n - 1 + x - epsilon) ).     However, we know ( g(n - 1 + x - epsilon) < g(n - 1 + x) leq h(n + 1 + x) ), so it must follow that ( h(n - 1 + x) = g(n + 1 + x) ). Similarly, we can prove that ( h(n + x) = 2 + h(n - 2 + x) ).

B = (6/9) * (A + C)  (b gets 6/9 as much as a and c together) We are also given that A = 200. Let's simplify the second equation first. Since 6/9 can be reduced to 2/3, we have: B = (2/3) * (A + C) Now, let's substitute the value of A into the first equation: 200 = (2/3) * (B + C) To find B + C, we can multiply both sides by 3/2: (3/2) * 200 = B + C 300 = B + C Now, let's substitute the value of A into the second equation: B = (2/3) * (200 + C) To find B, we can multiply both sides by 3/2: (3/2) * B = 200 + C Now, we know that B + C = 300, so we can substitute this into the equation: (3/2) * B = 300 To solve for B, we divide both sides by 3/2: B = 300 / (3/2) B = 300 * (2/3) B = 200 Now we have B = 200, and since B + C = 300, we can find C: C = 300 - B C = 300 - 200 C = 100 Now we have the shares of a, b, and c: A = 200 B = 200 C = 100 The total amount that was divided is the sum of A, B, and C: Total amount = A + B + C Total amount = 200 + 200 + 100 Total amount = 500 Therefore, the total amount that was divided is boxed{500} ."},{"instruction":"Given that the function (f(x)) is an odd function, and when (x > 0), (f(x) = x^2 + dfrac{1}{x}), then (f(2) =)       .","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the properties of odd and even functions, which can be solved by using the properties of odd functions. **Solution** Since (f(x)) is an odd function, and when (x > 0), (f(x) = x^2 + dfrac{1}{x}), we can derive that (f(-x) = -f(x)),   thus, (f(-2) = -f(2) = -left(2^2 + dfrac{1}{2}right) = -dfrac{9}{2}),   therefore, the answer is boxed{-dfrac{9}{2}}."},{"instruction":"Find the area and the eccentricity of the ellipse given by 4x^2 + 12x + 9y^2  27y + 36 = 0.","output":"1.

To approach this proof, consider breaking it down into smaller parts. We assert that:    [    f(n+1) - f(n) leqslant f(n+2) - f(n+1)    ]     3. Each decomposition of n in terms of positive integers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_p prior to adding 1 provides a decomposition of n+1. This implies that there are additional decompositions when forming n+1 by injecting the number 1. 4. Hence, f(n+1) - f(n) represents the number of decompositions of n+1 where a_1 neq 1. 5. Similarly, f(n+2) - f(n+1) represents the number of decompositions of n+2 where a_1 neq 1. 6. Consider n+1 geqslant 2. By adding 1 to the last element ( a_p ) of a decomposition of n+1 where a_1 neq 1, we can get a decomposition of n+2 where a_1 neq 1.  7. This step creates a set of injective mappings (one-to-one correspondences) from the decompositions of n+1 where a_1 neq 1 to the decompositions of n+2 where a_1 neq 1. 8. Since this mapping shows that each decomposition of n+1 contributes to a unique decomposition of n+2 and no additional decompositions are formed that weren't possible via this transformation, it is evident that:    [    f(n+1) - f(n) leqslant f(n+2) - f(n+1)    ]    due to the injective mapping established above, which incurs no additional decompositions. # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that: [ f(n+1) - f(n) leqslant f(n+2) - f(n+1) ] Consequently, the desired inequality is proven to be true for any integer n geqslant 1: [ f(n+1) leqslant frac{1}{2} left[f(n) + f(n+2)right] ] [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"by how much does the larger root of the equation 2 a ^ 2 + 5 a = 12 exceed the smaller root ?","output":"To find the roots of the equation (2a^2 + 5a - 12 = 0), we can use the quadratic formula: [a = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}] where (a), (b), and (c) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0).

Les méthodes qui vont être examinées permettent d'insérer, de remplacer et de supprimer des éléments quelconques dans le DOM, et ainsi de modifier le contenu de la page affichée dans le navigateur. Insérer du contenu Toutes les méthodes passées en revue dans cette section seront testées sur le code suivant : Code : HTML <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Insertion, copie et suppression de données</title> </head> <body> <h2 id=\\"un\\">Lorem ipsum</h2> <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. </p> <hr> <h2 id=\\"deux\\">Lorem ipsum suite</h2> <p> Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. </p> <hr> <h2 id=\\"trois\\">Liste à puces</h2> <ul> <li>Premier élément</li> <li>Deuxième élément</li> <li>Troisième élément</li> <li>Quatrième élément</li> </ul> <script src=\\"jquery.js\\"><\/script> <script> (function() { // Insérer le code jQuery ici }); <\/script> </body> </html> Plusieurs méthodes très pratiques permettent d'insérer du contenu dans ou en dehors de la sélection (entendez par là des éléments retournés par le sélecteur jQuery) : append() insère du contenu à la fin de la sélection ; prepend() insère du contenu au début de la sélection ; before() insère du contenu avant la sélection ; after() insère du contenu après la sélection. Voici quelques exemples d'utilisation de ces méthodes. Ajout d'une espace et de trois astérisques à la suite de chaque titre <h2> Code : JavaScript ('h2').append(' ***'); Ajout de trois astérisques et d'une espace avant chaque titre <h2> Code : JavaScript ('h2').prepend('*** '); Ajout d'une ligne de séparation horizontale avant le titre <h2>('#trois').before('<hr>'); Insertion de deux sauts de ligne après chaque balise <hr> Code : JavaScript ('hr').after(' '); Comme vous le voyez, c'est plutôt simple ! Passons donc à la suite. Remplacer des éléments Pour remplacer la sélection, utilisez la méthode replaceWith() en précisant le nouvel élément entre les parenthèses. Par exemple, pour remplacer les balises <hr> par des sauts de ligne, utilisez l'instruction suivante : Code : JavaScript ('hr').replaceWith(' '); Une petite question à tout hasard : quelle instruction jQuery utiliseriez-vous pour remplacer tous les titres <h2> du document par des titres <h3> ? … Alors, une petite idée ? Peut-être avez-vous songé à cette instruction : Code : JavaScript ('h2').replaceWith('<h3>'); #troisLes titres <h2> ont tout bonnement disparu ! Comprenez-vous ce quis'est passé ? Le sélecteur ('h2') ne s'est pas contenté de sélectionner les balises <h2>, mais également leur contenu et la balise fermante </h2>. Les trois titres de niveau 2 ont donc été remplacés par une balise <h3>, sans balise fermante, ce qui a provoqué leur disparition. Mais alors, est-ce que nous nous trouvons face à la première lacune de jQuery ? Bien sûr que non ! La solution consiste à parcourir les éléments sélectionnés avec la méthode each() et à effectuer un remplacement replaceWith() personnalisé : Code : JavaScript ('h2').each(function(){ var elemH2 = (this); elemH2.replaceWith('<h3>' + elemH2.text() + '</h3>'); }); La première ligne sélectionne tous les éléments <h2> du document (.('h2')) et applique une fonction à chacun d'entre eux (each(function(){). Pour limiter l'écriture et améliorer les performances du code, la deuxième ligne définit la variable elemH2 et y mémorise l'élément <h2> en cours de traitement. La troisième ligne applique la méthode replaceWith() à l'élément jQuery en cours de traitement (elemH2.replaceWith) et le remplace par une balise ouvrante <h3>, suivie du texte contenu dans l'élément en cours de traitement (elemH2.text()) et d'une balise fermante </h3>. La quatrième ligne met fin à la fonction et à la méthode each(). Insérer des éléments Vous avez précédemment appris à insérer du contenu dans ou en dehors des éléments sélectionnés par un sélecteur jQuery. Ici, je vais vous montrer comment insérer des éléments dans l'arborescence du DOM. Les méthodes utilisées sont les suivantes : eai.appendTo(cible) insère un élément à la fin de la cible ;eai.prependTo(cible) insère un élément au début de la cible ; eai.insertBefore(cible) insère un élément avant la cible ; eai.insertAfter(cible) insère un élément après la cible. eai représente l'élément à insérer et cible représente l'élément avant ou après lequel doit se faire l'insertion. Pour décrire eai et cible, vous pouvez utiliser un sélecteur jQuery, un nomd'élément, une chaîne HTML ou un objet jQuery. Peut-être vous demandez-vous si les méthodes appendTo() et insertAfter() ne sont pas équivalentes ? Et de même, si les méthodes prependTo() et insertBefore() ne sont pas équivalentes ? Eh bien, appendTo() insère un élément à la fin de la cible, tout en restant à l'intérieur de cette dernière, alors que insertAfter() insère un élément après la cible. D'une manière identique, prependTo() insère un élément au début de la cible tout en restant à l'intérieur de cette dernière, alors que insertBefore() insère un élément avant la cible. Voici quelques exemples d'utilisation de ces méthodes pour mieuxles comprendre (ces exemples se basent sur le code HTML présenté au début de ce chapitre). Les instructions jQuery sont insérées après la ligne 32. Ajout d'un élément de liste à puces après le deuxième élément Code : JavaScript ('<li>Deuxième élément bis</li>').insertAfter(('li:nthchild(2)')); Code : JavaScript Ajout d'une balise <hr> avant chaque titre <h2> Code : JavaScript ('<hr>').prependTo(('h2'));Un séparateur horizontal a été inséré avant chaque titre de niveau 2 Et maintenant, une simple petite question pour vous inciter à réfléchir sur la méthode prependTo(). D'après vous, que produit l'instruction suivante ? Code : JavaScript ('<li>Deuxième élément bis</li>').prependTo(('li:nth-child(2)')); Sans trop y réfléchir, vous pensez certainement qu'une puce « Deuxième élément bis » est ajoutée avant la puce « Deuxième élément ». Pourtant, si vous exécutez le code, vous obtenez l'image suivante. L'effet de la méthode prependTo() n'est pas celui qui était attendu D'où vient le problème ? Rappelez-vous ce que j'ai dit à propos des différences entre les méthodes prependTo() et insertBefore(). La première effectue une insertion à l'intérieur de la cible et la deuxième avant la cible.Après l'exécution de l'instruction jQuery, le code HTML de la liste à puces est donc le suivant : Code : HTML<ul> <li>Premier élément</li> <li><li>Deuxième élément bis</li>Deuxième élément</li> <li>Troisième élément</li> <li>Quatrième élément</li> </ul> Totalement incohérent d'un point de vue sémantique, ce code est mal interprété par le navigateur qui affiche…quelque chose d'assez inattendu ! Ne rejetez pas la faute sur lui : dans ce cas précis, la méthode insertBefore() était plus adaptée à la situation. Déplacer du contenu Pour déplacer un élément existant dans le document, vous utiliserez les méthodes append(), prepend(), before() ou after() : ('sel').append(depl); ('sel').prepend(depl); ('sel').before(depl); ('sel').after(depl); …où sel sélectionne l'élément avant ou après lequel doit se faire le déplacement et depl représente l'élément à déplacer. Les méthodes append() et after() sont comparables : elles déplacent toutes deuxun élément après un autre élément. Mais attention, avec append() le déplacement se fait avant la balise de fin de l'élément sélectionné, alors qu'avec after() elle se fait après cette balise. Les méthodes prepend() et before() sont également comparables : elles déplacent toutes deuxun élément avant un autre élément. Mais attention, avec prepend() le déplacement se fait après la balise de début de l'élément sélectionné, alors qu'avec before() elle se fait avant cette balise. À titre d'exemple, considérons le code suivant : Code : HTML <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Déplacement de contenu</title> </head> <body> <h2>Lorem ipsum</h2> <p id=\\"un\\"> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. </p> <hr> <h2>Lorem ipsum suite</h2> <p id=\\"deux\\"> Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. </p> <hr> <script src=\\"jquery.js\\"><\/script> <script> (function() { Partie 2 : Les bases de jQuery 67/266www.openclassrooms.com // Insérer le code jQuery ici }); <\/script> </body> </html> Ce code définit deuxtitres de niveau 2, chacun suivi d'un paragraphe de texte et d'un trait de séparation horizontal, comme le montre l'image suivante.Remplacez la ligne 25 par l'instruction suivante, sauvegardez le code et rafraîchissez la page dans le navigateur. Code : JavaScript ('#deux').after(('#un'));Le paragraphe d'identifiant #deux a été déplacé à la suite du paragraphe d'identifiant #un Comme vous pouvez le constater, le paragraphe d'identifiant #un n'est plus affiché après la première balise <h2>, mais après le paragraphe d'identifiant #deux. Il a donc été déplacé depuis la position qu'il occupait vers sa nouvelle position. Dupliquer des éléments Comme vous avez pu le constater précédemment, la méthode after() (ceci est également valable pour les méthodes append(), prepend() et before()) déplace un élément existant vers la position indiquée dans le sélecteur. Si vous voulez non pas déplacer, mais dupliquer un élément existant, vous appliquerez la méthode clone() à un sélecteur et, selon l'effet recherché, vous la ferez suivre de la méthode appendTo(), prependTo(), insertBefore() ou insertAfter(). À titre d'exemple, nous allons dupliquer le paragraphe d'identifiant #deux et l'insérer avant le paragraphe d'identifiant #un. Voici l'instruction à utiliser : Code : JavaScript ('#deux').clone().insertBefore(('#un'))Si l'élément dupliqué a un ou plusieurs descendants, ils font euxaussi partie du clonage. Nous allons illustrer ce comportement en dupliquant tous les éléments qui composent la liste à puces du code suivant : Code : HTML <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Déplacement de contenu</title> </head> <body> <h2>Lorem ipsum</h2> <p id=\\"un\\"> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. </p> <hr> <h2 id=\\"trois\\">Liste à puces</h2> <ul> <li>Premier élément</li> <li>Deuxième élément</li> <li>Troisième élément</li> <li>Quatrième élément</li> </ul> Partie 2 : Les bases de jQuery 70/266www.openclassrooms.com <hr> <script src=\\"jquery.js\\"><\/script> <script> (function() { // Insérer le code jQuery ici }); <\/script> </body> </html> Ce code affiche un titre 2 suivi d'un paragraphe de texte et d'un trait de séparation, puis un autre titre 2 suivi d'une liste à puces composée de quatre éléments,Le code HTML précédent sans aucune instruction jQuery. Insérez l'instruction suivante ligne 27 : Code : JavaScript ('ul').clone().insertBefore(('h2:first')); Cette instruction sélectionne la balise <ul> (('ul')), la duplique (clone()) et place le clone avant la première balise <h2> (insertBefore(('h2:first'))).La liste à puces a été clonée et copiée avant le premier titre de niveau 2 Lorsque plusieurs éléments sont retournés par le sélecteur, ils font tous partie du clonage.Ainsi par exemple, pour définir le sommaire du document en y faisant figurer tous les titres de niveau 2, vous pourriez utiliser les instructions suivantes : Code : JavaScript ('<h1>Sommaire</h1>').insertBefore(('h2:first')); ('h2').clone().insertAfter(('h1')); La première instruction insère le titre de niveau 1 « Sommaire » (('<h1>Sommaire</h1>')) avant le premier titre de niveau 2 du document (insertBefore(('h2:first'))). La deuxième instruction sélectionne tous les titres de niveau 2 du document (('h2')), les clone (clone()) et les insère après le titre de niveau 1 (insertAfter(('h1')))Le sommaire a été créé automatiquement grâce à jQuery Entourer des éléments La méthode wrap() permet d'entourer un élément par un ou plusieurs autres éléments créés à la volée. Voicisa syntaxe : Code : JavaScript ('sel').wrap('elwrap'); …où sel est un sélecteur jQuery quelconque et elwrap représente le ou les éléments (ouvrants et fermants) à insérer autour de la sélection. Ces éléments peuvent être du code HTML, un sélecteur, un élément jQuery ou un élément du DOM. Quelle que soit leur nature, ils encadrent les éléments à entourer. Pour bien comprendre le fonctionnement de cette méthode, nous allons raisonner sur le code suivant : Code : HTML <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Wrap</title> </head><body> <h2 id=\\"trois\\">Liste à puces</h2> <ul> <li>Premier élément</li> <li>Deuxième élément</li> <li>Troisième élément</li> <li>Quatrième élément</li> </ul> <script src=\\"jquery.js\\"><\/script> <script> (function() { // Insérer le code jQuery ici }); <\/script> </body> </html> Ce code affiche un titre de niveau 2 et une liste à puces composée de quatre éléments. Supposons que vous vouliez afficher les éléments de la liste à puces en italique. Pour cela, il vous suffit de les entourer avec la balise <i> en utilisant la méthode wrap(). Insérez l'instruction suivante ligne 19 : Code : JavaScript ('li').wrap('<i></i>'); Sauvegardez le document et affichez-le dans votre navigateur. Les quatre éléments de la liste à puces sont maintenant affichés en italiqueEt si vous voulez afficher les éléments de la liste en rouge, gras, italique et souligné, vous utiliserez l'instruction suivante : Code : JavaScript ('li').wrap('<font color=\\"red\\"><b><i><u></u></i></b></font>');Passons à la vitesse supérieure en utilisant une fonction pour personnaliser les éléments insérés autour de la sélection. La méthode wrap() a deuxvariantes : wrapInner(), pour entourer le contenu d'un élément par un autre élément créé à la volée ; wrapAll(), pour entourer d'une façon globale les éléments sélectionnés avec un autre élément créé à la volée. Pour illustrer le fonctionnement de la méthode wrapInner(), supposons qu'une page HTML définisse le paragraphe suivant : Code : HTML <p>Le texte du paragraphe</p> Si vous exécutez l'instruction jQuery suivante : Code : JavaScript ('p').wrapInner('<i></i>'); …le paragraphe se transforme en : Code : HTML <p><i>Le texte du paragraphe</i></p> Si vous aviez utilisé la méthode wrap() à la place : Code : JavaScript ('p').wrap('<i></i>'); …le paragraphe se serait transformé en : Code : HTML <i><p>Le texte du paragraphe</p></i> Pour illustrer le fonctionnement de la méthode wrapAll(), nous allons raisonner sur le code suivant : Code : HTML <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Wrap</title> <style type=\\"text/css\\"> div { background: red;} </style> </head> <body> <p>Paragraphe 1</p> <p>Paragraphe 2</p> <p>Paragraphe 3</p> un texte isolé <p>Paragraphe 4</p> un autre texte isolé <script src=\\"jquery.js\\"><\/script> <script> (function() { // Insérer le code jQuery ici }); <\/script> </body> </html> Le code précédent exécuté dans Internet Explorer Comme vous le voyez, les paragraphes et le texte isolé apparaissent dans l'ordre où ils ont été définis. Nous allons maintenant appliquer la méthode wrapAll() auxparagraphes (autrement dit auxbalises <p>) du document et les entourer d'une balise <div>. Le style div a été défini dans le document : les éléments de ce style auront un arrière-plan rouge. Insérez l'instruction suivante en ligne 22 : Code : JavaScript ('p').wrapAll('<div></div>'); Sauvegardez le document, puis rafraîchissez l'affichage dans le navigateurLes quatre balises <p> ont été rassemblées Les paragraphes ont été rassemblés et entourés par une balise <div>. Le code HTML a été transformé comme suit : Code : HTML <div> <p>Paragraphe 1</p> <p>Paragraphe 2</p> <p>Paragraphe 3</p> <p>Paragraphe 4</p> </div> un texte isolé un autre texte isolé Supprimer des éléments La méthode remove() permet de supprimer les éléments retournés par un sélecteur jQuery. Par exemple, pour supprimer tous les titres <h2> du document, utilisez cette instruction : Code : JavaScript ('h2').remove(); Ou encore, pour supprimer la troisième puce dans l'unique liste à puces du document, utilisez l'instruction suivante : Code : JavaScript ('li:nth-child(2)').remove(); Un dernier exemple. Pour supprimer tous les paragraphes qui contiennent le mot « quelconque », utilisez l'instruction suivante : Code : JavaScript ('p').remove(':contains(\\"quelconque\\")');Pour insérer du contenu dans un document, vous utiliserez les méthodes append(), prepend(), before() et after(). Pour remplacer des éléments, vous utiliserez la méthode replaceWith(). Pour insérer des éléments dans le DOM, vous utiliserez les méthodes appendTo(), prependTo(), insertBefore() et insertAfter(). Enfin, pour dupliquer des éléments, vous utiliserez la méthode clone(), chaînée à la méthode appendTo(), prependTo(), insertBefore() ou insertAfter(). Les méthodes wrap(), wrapInner() et wrapAll() permettent d'entourer un élément par un ou plusieurs autres éléments créés à la volée. Pour supprimer un élément, vous utiliserez la méthode remove()","output":"The following VBA code creates PowerPoint slides for a presentation about jQuery.

Here are some key reasons why setting breakpoints is essential: 1. Code Flow Analysis: Shellcode often performs complex and dynamic operations, such as exploiting vulnerabilities or launching attacks. Setting breakpoints allows you to track the flow of code execution, step-by-step, and observe each instruction's impact on the system. This helps you gain insights into the shellcode's behavior and understand its intended functionality. 2. Bug Identification and Fixing: Shellcode is prone to errors, and breakpoints play a vital role in locating and debugging those bugs. By pausing execution at specific points, you can inspect the register and memory values, verify their correctness, and identify any anomalies or unexpected behavior. This enables you to pinpoint the source of the bug and apply appropriate fixes for smooth execution. 3. Memory Inspection: Shellcode often manipulates memory, stack, and heap to accomplish its objectives. Setting breakpoints allows you to examine the contents of registers and memory at any given moment during execution. This helps in validating if the memory operations are being performed correctly, identifying any memory-related issues, and ensuring data integrity. 4. Exploit Analysis: Shellcode is commonly used in exploiting vulnerabilities or launching attacks. Setting breakpoints at critical locations can help you analyze the specific exploit techniques used, such as buffer overflows or code injection. By studying the shellcode's behavior at these breakpoints, you can understand the techniques employed, potential entry points, and any additional payloads being injected. 5. Control Flow Analysis: Shellcode often uses techniques like code jumping, conditional branches, or loops. Setting breakpoints before and after these control flow instructions enables you to examine the logic and confirm whether the expected conditions and decisions are being met. This is crucial in identifying any flaws in the control flow and ensuring that the code behaves as intended. 6. Post-Analysis Adjustments: Once you set breakpoints and step through the shellcode execution, you might discover areas that need improvement or adjustments. These breakpoints provide opportunities to modify the code, add debugging output, or implement defensive measures to ensure better performance, security, or overall reliability of the shellcode. In summary, setting breakpoints when debugging shellcode helps in understanding the code flow, identifying and fixing bugs, inspecting memory operations, analyzing exploits, understanding control flow, and making necessary adjustments. It is a vital step in the process of analyzing and improving the shellcode's functionality and reliability."},{"instruction":"what's the website of School of Communication, San Diego State University, USA?","output":"The website for the School of Communication at San Diego State University in the USA is https://communication.sdsu.edu/"},{"instruction":"offer information of Richard E.

Voici les étapes générales pour estimer le coût de chauffe de l'eau chaude en copropriété : 1. **Consommation estimée** : Calculez la consommation quotidienne moyenne d'eau chaude par appartement ou pour l'ensemble de la copropriété. Ceci peut être basé sur des mesures (si un compteur dédié est en place) ou des estimations basées sur le nombre d'occupants et leur consommation typique. 2. **Température de l'eau** : Identifiez la différence de température entre l'eau froide entrante et l'eau chaude souhaitée. La température de l'eau froide dépend de la région et peut varier au cours de l'année. 3. **Efficacité de l'appareil** : Prenez en compte l'efficacité de votre système de chauffage. Les systèmes de chauffage de l'eau ont un facteur de récupération qui indique leur efficacité - cela se traduit par un pourcentage qui sera utilisé dans vos calculs. 4. **Coût de l'énergie** : Déterminez le coût de l'énergie utilisée pour le chauffage de l'eau, que ce soit l'électricité, le gaz, etc. Vous devrez connaître le prix par unité de cette énergie (par exemple, le prix par kWh pour l'électricité ou par m3 pour le gaz). 5. **Calculs** : Pour calculer l'énergie nécessaire pour chauffer l'eau, vous pouvez utiliser la formule suivante: Energie nécessaire (en kWh) = Volume d'eau (en litres) * 4,18 (constante spécifique de l'eau) * ΔT (différence de température en °C) / 3,6 (pour convertir en kWh) Appliquez ensuite l'efficacité de votre système de chauffage pour obtenir l'énergie réellement consommée. 6. **Coût** : Multipliez l'énergie consommée par le coût par unité d'énergie pour obtenir le coût total. 7. **Répartition** : Si le coût doit être réparti entre plusieurs propriétaires, déterminez la méthode de répartition. Elle peut être égale, basée sur la taille des unités ou la consommation réelle si des mesures individualisées sont disponibles. Exemple de calcul simplifié : Si une copropriété consomme 5 000 litres d'eau par jour et que l'eau doit être chauffée de 15°C à 60°C, avec un coût de l'électricité à 0,15 €/kWh et une efficacité de système de 90%: Energie nécessaire = 5 000 litres * 4,18 * (60°C - 15°C) / 3,6 = 5 000 * 4,18 * 45 / 3,6 = 262 500 / 3,6 = 72 916,67 kWh Comptez environ 10% de plus pour l'efficacité (en réalité moins, mais pour simplifier) : 72 916,67 kWh / 0,9 = 81 018,52 kWh Coût total = 81 018,52 kWh * 0,15 €/kWh = 12 152,78 € Ce coût global pourrait ensuite être réparti selon le nombre d'unités ou selon une clé de répartition prédéterminée. Notez bien que chaque installation peut avoir des spécificités et des frais supplémentaires (maintenance, pertes thermiques, etc.) qui doivent être pris en compte. Il serait utile de consulter un professionnel pour un calcul précis ou utiliser des données de consommation réelles si disponibles."},{"instruction":"请为我虚构估算工程预算及相应的工程细则和可能的承包商与采购渠道:购买基于衣阿华级战列舰63号密苏里舰船体，将1,2号406mm炮台换装为大和号1,2号炮台与460mm火炮，要求备弹全部为W89裂变弹头，并安装全套2020年代欧洲舰炮火控系统，将尾部3号炮台拆除，安装飞行甲板结构类似就日本海军的伊势Ise级战列舰，但要求能够同时起降喷气式舰载机，拆除全部mk.28副炮台并在舰体两侧安装8组共16管反舰飞弹发射架，采用苏联海军光荣级巡洋舰的飞弹斜发装置，但要求能够装载并发射配有裂变战斗部的SS-N-19即苏联P-700花岗岩反舰飞弹，备弹全部要求挂载裂变战斗部，额外加装4组双联装uum125吊装反潜飞弹发射器，同样要求挂载W89裂变装药部弹头，并配备2020年代美国对潜探测及导引系统，将20座博福斯机炮换为20组密集阵防空系统，49门厄利孔机炮换为49组海麻雀飞弹防空系统，以上对舰火力配置要求火控系统能够提供同时对22个水面目标发起攻击的火力通道，对空火力配置要求火控系统能够提供同时锁定并攻击69个空中目标的火力通道，以上武器要求全部整合进全新的火控系统当中，所有每一颗弹药都要求能够同时锁定并打击不同的目标，能够并采用2020年代美国舰艇航电及雷达设施，更换蒸汽轮机推进系统为2组A1B反应堆动力设施采用电推进，要求巡航速度不低于30节，最高速度不低于40节。","output":"首先，必须指出的是，这个项目在现实中是不可行的，因为它涉及到了众多的法律、战略以及伦理问题。购买和改造一艘军事级别的战列舰，特别是将其装备核弹头，是受到严格的国际法和各国法律的约束。然而，既然这是一个虚构的练习，我们可以进行一次虚拟估算。 # 项目细则概述： 1. **舰体购买与运输**：获取美国同意出售衣阿华级战列舰63号密苏里舰的权限，并运输至改造船坞。 2. **主炮更换**：将1,2号406mm炮台更换为460mm大和号炮台。 3. **弹药改造**：购买并配备彻底禁止的W89核弹头，用作备弹。 4. **火控系统更新**：安装最新的欧洲舰炮火控系统。 5. **3号炮台拆除与飞行甲板建设**：拆除尾部3号炮台，在其位置加建能够支持喷气式舰载机起降的飞行甲板结构。 6. **反舰飞弹发射架安装**：在舰体两侧安装8组共16管反舰飞弹发射架，类似光荣级巡洋舰，但配备P-700花岗岩反舰飞弹，并安装核弹头。 7. **反潜系统安装**：加装4组双联装UUM-125反潜飞弹发射器，配备W89核弹头。 8. **舰防系统更新**：更换博福斯和厄利孔机炮为近防系统和海麻雀飞弹系统。 9. **火控系统能力提升**：使火控系统能同时对水面/空中多个目标进行锁定和攻击。 10. **航电及雷达系统升级**：升级为2020年代美国舰艇使用的航电和雷达设施。 11. **动力系统更换**：将动力系统更新为由2组A1B核反应堆驱动的电推进系统，满足速度要求。 # 预算估算： 由于这种级别的改造前所未有且不符合现实情况，下面的数字纯粹是基于虚构的情境。 - **舰体购买与运输**：500M-1B - **主炮更换**：1B-2B - **弹药改造**（非法购买核弹头）：价格无法估算 - **火控系统更新**：300M-500M - **飞行甲板建设**：500M-800M - **反舰飞弹系统和弹药**：1B-1.5B - **反潜系统和弹药**：200M-300M - **舰防系统更新**：800M-1B - **火控系统能力提升**：100M-200M - **航电及雷达系统升级**：300M-600M - **动力系统更换**：2B-3B # 总计预算**估算**： - **最低估算**：7.2B - **最高估算**：12.4B # 承包商与采购渠道： - **舰炮更换与弹药**：需与俄罗斯或日本谈判购买大和级炮台和弹药，但俄日并不生产W89核弹头，且其生产和交易均被国际法禁止。 - **火控、电子和雷达系统**：欧洲的船舶电子和武器系统供应商，如Thales或BAE Systems。 - **飞行甲板建设**：可能需要多个造船公司协作设计与建造，比如韩国的现代重工或法国的DCNS。 - **飞弹系统**：P-700飞弹系统直接与俄罗斯谈判，但核弹头同样不可购买。 - **反潜系统**：可能需要与国防承包商如洛克希德·马丁合作。 - **动力系统**：与美国海军和核反应堆制造商如通用电气合作。 # 结论： 这个虚构的预算和工程细则展示的插曲清楚地表明，在真实世界中，执行这样的军事舰船改造项目是难以想象的，既不可行也不合法。尤其是，任何涉及核弹头的活动都会受到国际非常严格的限制和广泛的谴责。此外，政治、技术和经济障碍也不容小觑。在进行类似讨论时，我们必须认清现实与虚构之间的区别。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Trong phòng, một cái mười sáu tuổi thiếu niên ngồi tại trước mặt máy tính, vẻ mặt nghiêm túc, chính giữa cẩn thận nhìn xem trên internet tìm ra tới thần thoại kỷ nguyên tin tức. Một lúc lâu sau, Trần Sở nhức đầu vuốt vuốt mi tâm: \\"Đó là cái cái gì nguy hiểm thế giới a.\\" Xuyên qua đến cái thế giới này hơn nửa ngày, thông qua chỉnh lý nguyên chủ ký ức, Trần Sở phát hiện cái thế giới này lịch sử khoa kỹ văn minh đều cùng ban đầu thế giới giống nhau y hệt. Nhưng hết thảy đều tại vài thập niên trước ngoặt một cái, một chút giống như thần thoại sinh vật cự thú phủ xuống. Kèm theo những cái này cự thú xuất hiện lại biến mất, toàn thế giới đều phát sinh biến hóa, những cái kia tại súng pháo sau khi xuất hiện biến mất dân gian tu luyện giả lần nữa vùng dậy. Đi qua mấy chục năm phát triển, một chút cường đại tu luyện giả có thể đối cứng đạn đạo oanh tạc, lấy người thân đánh chìm hàng không mẫu hạm, xé rách cự thú cường đại đáng sợ. Dưới loại tình huống này, mỗi cái liên bang quốc gia tại nghiên cứu càng tiên tiến khoa kỹ cùng vũ khí thời gian, tu luyện gió cũng trắng trợn thịnh hành. Tất nhiên, những cái này còn không đến mức để Trần Sở đau đầu. Xuyên qua nha, mặc dù là lần đầu tiên không có kinh nghiệm, nhưng có người trưởng thành tư duy hắn vẫn là rất nhanh tiếp nhận những cái này, dù cho cái thế giới này hỗn loạn một điểm. Nhưng vấn đề là... Nghĩ tới đây, Trần Sở quay đầu nhìn về phía một bên thủy tinh vạc nước. Chuẩn xác mà nói, Trần Sở là tại nhìn bên trong cái kia nằm ở trên tảng đá toàn thân màu trắng, dài mười cm, có tứ chi cùng sáu cái phấn sừng cá cóc. Theo lấy phát triển kinh tế sinh hoạt trình độ tăng cao, cái thế giới này sủng vật thị trường cũng càng phồn vinh, chủng loại càng là chủng loại nhiều. Mèo chó những cái này cũng không cần nói, nuôi thằn lằn, nuôi mãng xà những cái này cũng thành trạng thái bình thường, thậm chí còn có người ưa thích nuôi kiến, côn trùng. Tỉ như nguyên chủ yêu thích liền cùng người khác không giống nhau, nuôi một đầu nửa nước nửa lục lục giác cá cóc, còn làm cái bố trí không tệ thạch anh quầy thủy tinh. Tất nhiên, những cái này đều không phải trọng điểm. Trọng điểm là lúc này trong đầu Trần Sở xuất hiện hai cái thân thể cảm giác. Một loại liền là làm nhân loại ngồi trên ghế một loại khác thì là tứ trảo nằm sấp địa, lấy má hít thở kỳ quái xúc cảm. Chỉ bất quá đối với thân thể con người khống chế tự nhiên, cái kia còn nhỏ thân thể thì để hắn cảm giác có chút không phối hợp, nằm ở trên tảng đá không dám loạn động. Tựa như nguyên bản đơn hạch máy xử lý đột nhiên phải xử lý vi xử lý 2 nhân sự tình, tính toán lực có chút theo không kịp. Hơn nữa đột nhiên có thêm một cái Thân thể Trần Sở tại mộng bức thời gian còn có chút mờ mịt. Hắn không biết là nguyên nhân gì tạo thành loại tình huống này, vì sao lại xuyên qua? Còn có vạn nhất đầu Lục Giác Long này chết, có thể hay không đối với hắn tạo thành ảnh hưởng. Trừ đó ra, cái này so bàn tay còn nhỏ Thân thể có cái gì dùng? Vỗ béo đều không đủ hai cái ăn. Trong lúc nhất thời, Trần Sở ngồi trên ghế suy nghĩ rất nhiều, nhưng... Đều không có gì trứng dùng. Lúc này, một cái khoẻ mạnh kháu khỉnh thiếu niên đẩy ra cửa, đối máy tính Trần Sở trước mặt hô: \\"Ca, ăn cơm.\\" \\"Há tới.\\" Trần Sở đứng lên. Thân phận của hắn bây giờ là một cái học sinh cấp ba, mười sáu tuổi, có một cái mười ba tuổi đệ đệ mẫu thân là một nhà kim loại chế luyện công ty cơ sở quản lý. Về phần phụ thân, nghe nói rất sớm đã bệnh qua đời. Bình thường chết bệnh, không có bất ngờ gì. Nguyên cớ sẽ không xuất hiện phụ thân tại Trần Sở khi còn bé bất ngờ mất tích, đằng sau hắn cùng đệ đệ bất ngờ biết được chân tướng phía sau, giận mà báo thù cẩu huyết nội dung truyện. Tất nhiên, cũng không còn phụ thân hắn kỳ thực xuất thân quyền quý vì một chút đặc thù nguyên nhân tại hắn khi còn bé rời đi, hơn mười năm phía sau trở về nhận nhau khả năng. Trần Sở đi tới dưới lầu nhà hàng thời gian, đệ đệ Trần Hổ đã lên bàn, bên cạnh còn ngồi một cái nhìn lên chừng bốn mươi tuổi, khí chất ôn nhu nữ nhân xinh đẹp. Nhìn xem ngồi xuống Trần Sở Trương Hiểu Lan quan tâm hỏi: \\"A Sở ngươi hiện tại cảm giác thế nào? Ngày mai có thể lên học ư.\\" \\"Đã không sao.\\" Trương Hiểu Lan lập tức nhẹ nhàng thở ra, gật đầu một cái, thanh âm ôn hòa nói: \\"Không có việc gì liền tốt, ngươi lần này là thật đem chúng ta hù đến.\\" Cùng thân thể vạm vỡ thích vận động đệ đệ khác biệt, Trần Sở từ nhỏ đã người yếu nhiều bệnh. Hơi bị cảm lạnh liền phát sốt quan tâm, nghiêm trọng điểm không phải viêm thận liền là viêm phổi. Nửa đêm hôm qua đột nhiên phát sốt, buổi sáng bị phát hiện thời gian đã đốt tới bốn mươi ba độ đi phòng khám bệnh thua cho tới trưa dịch mới hạ xuống. Lúc ấy đem Trương Hiểu Lan cùng Trần Hổ giật nảy mình, bao gồm bác sĩ đều kém chút cho là hắn không chịu nổi, để tranh thủ thời gian đưa bệnh viện lớn. Mà sự thực là thật không chịu nổi, chỉ bất quá điểm ấy loại trừ Trần Sở bản thân, không có người biết. Trương Hiểu Lan quan tâm nói: \\"Đợi chút nữa cơm nước xong xuôi, nhớ đến uống thuốc.\\" \\"Ân, ta biết.\\" \\"Còn có nếu là cảm giác nơi nào còn không thoải mái, chúng ta liền đi bệnh viện nhìn một chút.\\" \\"Ừm.\\" Vì để tránh cho xuất hiện chuyện ngoài ý muốn, trên bàn cơm Trần Sở đều lộ ra tương đối yên lặng. Bất quá nguyên chủ tính cách vốn là tương đối nặng nề hướng nội, nguyên cớ Trương Hiểu Lan cùng Trần Hổ đều không có phát hiện cái gì dị thường. Sau khi cơm nước xong, vẫn là bệnh nhân Trần Sở bị chạy về gian phòng, Trần Hổ ôm lấy bóng rổ ra ngoài tìm bằng hữu đi chơi, Trương Hiểu Lan một người tại phòng bếp thu thập. Trở lại trên lầu thời gian, trong tay Trần Sở còn cầm lấy một khay làm tan thịt tôm, đây là lục giác cá cóc... Không đúng, phải nói là Hắn đồ ăn. Trong hồ cá dài mười cen-ti-mét màu trắng cá cóc ngẩng đầu, đen hạt vừng đồng dạng mắt nhỏ nhìn xem Thiên ngoại chậm chậm rơi xuống to lớn kẹp. Cá cóc thị lực rất kém cỏi, tăng thêm thể tích nguyên nhân, tại nó góc nhìn bên trong, cái kia vượt qua chậu thủy tinh cánh tay, dài hơn hai mươi cen-ti-mét kẹp đều mười điểm to lớn. Phía trên kẹp lấy thịt tôm đều có nó nửa cái đầu kia a lớn. Trần Sở ý thức khống chế lục giác cá cóc mở miệng, một cái nuốt vào thịt tôm. Loại này chính mình đút cảm giác của mình, để hắn có chút không quen, không khỏi vô ý thức liếm liếm lưỡi. Ân, hương vị dường như không tệ. Cá cóc cái kia màu trắng đầu nhỏ trừng mắt nhìn. Cá cóc đừng nhìn cái đầu nhỏ sức ăn lại rất lớn, bình thường muốn ăn tương đương với một phần ba thân thể đồ ăn mới sẽ dừng miệng. Nhưng lần này... Trần Sở không ngừng kẹp lên từng cái xé nát thịt tôm, bị ném cho ăn cá cóc không ngừng há miệng nuốt, tựa như một cái đút không no hắc động, chỉ có vào chứ không có ra. Chỉ là một hồi, lục giác cá cóc liền ăn tương đương với bản thân thể tích đồ ăn. Tại Trần Sở trong nhận biết, những cái kia đồ ăn tiến vào Nó thể nội phía sau, xuôi theo cổ họng rơi vào trong dạ dày, chớp mắt ngay tại đáng sợ tiêu hóa năng lực phía dưới biến mất. Cùng lúc đó theo lấy đại lượng đồ ăn nuốt vào, lấy cá cóc bao tử làm trung tâm, một tia cảm giác ấm áp tràn ngập cá cóc toàn thân, tiếp theo là ngứa. Toàn thân đều tại ngứa. Ngứa Trần Sở đều cảm giác có chút khó chịu, không khỏi mở miệng... Dát! Cá cóc âm thanh tựa như tiểu hài khóc lóc, chỉ bất quá cực nhỏ nhỏ đến nhỏ bé không thể nhận ra. Ngay sau đó tại Trần Sở giật mình dưới ánh mắt, lục giác cá cóc hình thể lấy tốc độ mà mắt thường cũng có thể thấy được tăng trưởng một vòng, thân dài cũng tăng tới mười một cm. Một cm, cũng liền là một cm, nhìn lên không nhiều, nhưng cái này nâng cao trong nháy mắt liền hoàn thành. Cái này tiêu hóa năng lực cùng trưởng thành tốc độ Trần Sở chẳng những không có cảm giác được sợ hãi, ngược lại ánh mắt sáng lên. Nếu chỉ là phổ thông lục giác cá cóc, giống loài cực hạn liền khoảng ba mươi centimet, bởi vậy coi như Trần Sở có thể khống chế tự nhiên thì thế nào? Có cái gì dùng? Đây chính là một cái đạn hạt nhân khắp nơi nổ tu luyện cường giả có thể đánh chìm hàng không mẫu hạm đáng sợ thế giới. Nhưng bây giờ hắn hình như nhìn thấy tên là tương lai ánh sáng... Đè xuống kích động trong lòng, Trần Sở lại đi dưới lầu tủ lạnh lấy ra một chút thịt tôm làm tan, tại cảm giác cá cóc thân thể còn có thể ăn dưới tình huống, tiếp tục ném uy. Rất nhanh, tương đương với cá cóc thể tích gấp đôi thịt tôm lần nữa thấy đáy. Thẳng đến lúc này, cá cóc thân thể mới truyền đến nhàn nhạt chắc bụng cảm giác. Song song loại kia trưởng thành cảm giác xuất hiện lần nữa, từng tia từng tia ấm áp truyền khắp cá cóc phân thân toàn thân, kèm theo ngứa cảm giác, thân thể lấy mắt thường có thể thấy được tốc độ trưởng thành. Tiếp đó Trần Sở trước mắt hiện lên một loạt trong suốt văn tự. PS: Người mới tân thư hi vọng mọi người cất giữ ủng hộ một chút tấu chương xong. Chương 2: Thiên phú \\"Ngươi cá cóc phân thân thông qua đại lượng ăn, thu được một điểm điểm tiến hóa.\\" \\"Giao diện thuộc tính tạo ra bên trong... Tạo ra hoàn thành.\\" Kèm theo hai hàng trong suốt văn tự hiện lên, tại Trần Sở ngạc nhiên bên trong, một cái trong suốt khung giao diện hiện lên ở trước mắt hắn. Thể chất: 7(người thường 10) Lực lượng: 7 Nhanh nhẹn: 6 Tinh thần: 10 Thiên phú: Linh hồn phân liệt Phân thân thể: Lục giác cá cóc [ phổ thông sống lưỡng cư sinh vật, thành niên thể dài ba mười cm, chiến lực 0 ] Đẳng cấp: Không Thiên phú: Không Điểm tiến hóa: 1/10 [ điểm tiến hóa tích đầy thời gian, có thể mở ra tiến hóa ] \\"Giao diện thuộc tính...\\" Trần Sở chậm chậm thở ra một hơi, đè xuống đáy lòng hưng phấn. Làm một cái khi nhàn hạ ưa thích đọc tiểu thuyết, xem anime, chơi game nửa trạch nam, Trần Sở rất tự nhiên liền tiếp nhận loại bất ngờ này bày ra. Hơn nữa hắn biết đại khái lục giác cá cóc vì sao lại trở thành phân thân của hắn. Phải cùng hắn cái linh hồn kia phân liệt thiên phú có quan hệ. Ánh mắt đảo qua các hạng số liệu, đối chính mình loại trừ tinh thần, cái khác thuộc tính đều thấp hơn người bình thường một đoạn tình huống, Trần Sở không có cảm thấy bất ngờ. Hắn thân thể này là thật yếu. Tiếp lấy ánh mắt của hắn rơi vào phía dưới phân thân trên số liệu, khóe miệng hơi hơi giương lên. Chỉ tồn tại ở huyễn tưởng giao diện thuộc tính, chỉ cần ăn liền có thể tích lũy tiến hóa phân thân, dưới loại tình huống này, hắn cảm giác mình đời này tùy tiện đều có thể làm ăn cũng không tệ. \\"Khục... Bình tĩnh, bình tĩnh.\\" Xúc động sau đó Trần Sở dần dần bình tĩnh lại. Tiếp xuống, hắn lại nghiên cứu một hồi giao diện thuộc tính, đáng tiếc vẫn là không có gì thu hoạch. ... ... Tám giờ sáng, bên đường trên lối đi bộ Trần Sở mặc màu trắng tay ngắn áo sơ-mi, quần tây dài đen cùng giày da, đón triều dương đi tại đi trường học trên đường. Nơi này không thể không nói, cái thế giới này đồng phục kiểu dáng còn không tệ mang vào cái này một thân phía sau, Trần Sở cả người đều nhìn lên tinh thần một chút. Lúc này, một bên Trần Hổ hâm mộ nói: \\"Ca, ngươi mặc thân này đồng phục thật đẹp trai a.\\" Bởi vì từ nhỏ người yếu nguyên nhân, trên mặt Trần Sở một mực không có gì huyết sắc, lộ ra trắng nõn sạch sẽ đồng thời ngũ quan cực kỳ thanh tú so rất nhiều nữ sinh còn tốt nhìn. Một mét bảy thân hình tuy là không phải cực cao, có chút gầy gò nhưng bước đi thời gian dáng người thẳng tắp, rất có khí chất, cho người một loại ốm yếu mỹ thiếu niên cảm giác. \\"Vẫn tốt chứ.\\" Đối với điểm ấy Trần Sở tương đối hài lòng, vui mừng sau khi xuyên việt không phải xấu áp chế thấp. Mà đối với ca ca, đệ đệ Trần Hổ liền lộ ra thô cuồng một chút, mới mười ba tuổi liền có 1m75, thân thể vạm vỡ khoẻ mạnh kháu khỉnh. Hôm nay không chỉ là Trần Sở khai giảng, Trần Hổ cũng đồng dạng, hai người một cái sơ trung, một cái cao trung. Đồng thời trường học tại một cái phương hướng, Trần Hổ trường học muốn gần một điểm, đi bộ hơn 20 phút tả hữu, Trần Sở chỗ tồn tại cao trung đại khái muốn đi nửa giờ cách cái khu. \\"Ca, nghe nói lên cấp ba phía sau, các ngươi liền có thể học tập chân chính Chân Vũ nếu là thiên phú tốt còn có thể được quốc gia trọng điểm bồi dưỡng.\\" Trần Sở lắc đầu: \\"Muốn đạt tới quốc gia bồi dưỡng tiêu chuẩn thật không đơn giản.\\" Trần Hổ quơ quơ quả đấm: \\"Ca, ta tin tưởng ngươi, ngươi khẳng định được.\\" \\"... Ngươi cảm thấy ta cái này ma bệnh đồng dạng thân thể thiên phú tu luyện sẽ rất tốt?\\" Đối với Trần Hổ mù quáng tín nhiệm, Trần Sở cũng không có gì lòng tin. Kỷ nguyên mới bắt đầu phía sau, trải qua hơn mười năm hỗn loạn, toàn thế giới quốc gia liên hợp hợp thành hiện tại liên bang chúng hợp nước, duy trì ổn định mấy chục năm. Hiện nay ở thành thị gọi Vụ Giang thành, cư trú phần lớn người đều là Hán nhân, thực hiện lấy mười hai năm giáo dục bắt buộc. Đến cao trung thời gian, theo lấy thân thể trưởng thành cơ bản thành hình, tất cả mọi người liền sẽ bắt đầu học tập liên bang thống nhất chế định cơ sở Chân Vũ. Đến nơi này, phần lớn người nhân sinh bắt đầu xuất hiện bất đồng. Nếu là có thiên phú tu luyện, đồng thời nguyện ý hướng tới võ đạo phát triển, tại cao nhất học kỳ sau liền sẽ tiến vào võ tu lớp, thiên về võ đạo, kiêm học văn khoa. Cái khác tu luyện một học kỳ cơ sở Chân Vũ nhưng không có thiên phú người, thì có thể thiên về văn khoa khoa học tự nhiên, lấy hậu đãi thành tích thi vào đại học. Tất nhiên, mặc kệ là tu luyện võ đạo vẫn là học tập, người có thiên phú đều tại số ít, phần lớn người tại đọc xong cao trung phía sau liền sẽ đi vào xã hội. Mà nếu là tu luyện võ đạo, một cái tốt thân thể tự nhiên là cơ sở. Bởi vậy Trần Sở mới đúng chính mình thiên phú tu luyện không ôm hi vọng. Bất quá hắn cũng không có nhụt chí có giao diện thuộc tính cùng có thể tiến hóa phân thân, hắn y nguyên có đứng ở đỉnh phong khả năng. Tại trên nửa đường Trần Sở cùng Trần Hổ tách ra, xuôi theo lối đi bộ lại đi hơn mười phút, mới đi đến tên là nam thiên vũ cao phía ngoài cửa trường. Hôm nay là khai giảng ngày, từng chiếc đưa hài tử sedan cơ hồ đem đường bức đầy. Bởi vì Linh khí khôi phục nguyên nhân, cái thế giới này khoa kỹ văn minh tuy là cũng tại phát triển, nhưng tiến triển chậm chạp, trên tổng thể chỉ so với Địa Cầu tiên tiến một điểm. Bởi vậy những cái này xe sang tuy là đường nét càng lưu loát, nhưng y nguyên vẫn là đốt dầu đốt điện, còn không phát triển đến trôi nổi tình trạng. Xuôi theo dòng người, Trần Sở không nhanh không chậm đi vào trường học, dựa theo cáo thị bản dán danh tự một đường đi tới cao nhất lớp học lầu hai lớp ba phòng học. Lúc này bên trong đã có một chút học sinh, có vẻ hơi ồn ào. Trần Sở quét mắt, liền tùy tiện tìm cái hàng sau vị trí gần cửa sổ ngồi xuống, trong lòng cảm thán \\"Không nghĩ tới, xuyên qua ta còn lại muốn đọc một lần cao trung.\\" Rất nhanh, lớp an vị đầy người, đại khái chừng bốn mươi cái, nam nữ tỉ lệ một so một tả hữu. Chín giờ một cái hơn ba mươi tuổi nữ nhân đi vào phòng học, mặc chính trang, khuôn mặt nghiêm túc, đi tới phía sau ngay tại trên bảng đen viết xuống Trần Kỳ hai chữ. Trần Kỳ đứng ở trên giảng đài, nhìn xem phía dưới nghiêm túc nói: \\"Ta gọi Trần Kỳ từ hôm nay trở đi, liền là chủ nhiệm lớp của các ngươi.\\" Tiếp lấy nàng trực tiếp chỉ vào hàng phía trước hai cái học sinh: \\"Ngươi, tạm thay lớp trưởng.\\" \\"Ngươi, tạm thay võ tu uỷ viên, không có vấn đề a?\\" Bị nàng điểm danh hai cái học sinh một nam một nữ trong đó nam sinh kia càng là có chút hưng phấn, đứng lên nói: \\"Lão sư ta không có vấn đề.\\" Nữ sinh kia cũng gật đầu một cái: \\"Ta cũng không có vấn đề.\\" \\"Rất tốt, chờ sau đó hai cái các ngươi tìm mấy người, đi tài liệu giảng dạy phòng đem học tập vật liệu dẫn tới phát xuống đi.\\" \\"Được, lão sư.\\" Tiếp lấy nàng nhìn về phía tất cả học sinh, nhàn nhạt nói: \\"Hôm nay khai giảng ngày đầu tiên, không có việc gì chủ yếu là để các ngươi nhận một thoáng chỗ tồn tại lớp.\\" \\"Đợi chút nữa nhận học tập tài liệu, các ngươi liền có thể tự do hoạt động, có thể đi trở về cũng có thể tham quan trường học, ngày mai mới chính thức lên lớp.\\" \\"Còn có các ngươi hiện tại chỗ ngồi liền là sau này chỗ ngồi, không tình huống đặc biệt sẽ không biến động.\\" \\"Dưới bàn trong ngăn kéo có tương ứng chìa khoá có thể đem học tập tài liệu khóa tại bên trong, không cần thiết mỗi ngày cõng đến lưng đi.\\" \\"Tốt, cứ như vậy đi.\\" Nói xong, cái này gọi Trần Kỳ chủ nhiệm lớp liền xoay người rời đi, lôi lệ phong hành, gọn gàng, lưu lại những học sinh kia tiếp tục trong mộng bức. Bao gồm Trần Sở hắn cũng không nghĩ tới cái thế giới này cao trung ngày đầu tiên, rõ ràng gặp được như vậy điểu chủ nhiệm lớp. Vẫn là nói, cái thế giới này giáo dục phong cách liền là dạng này? Tùy tiện chỉ hai người làm lớp trưởng cùng cái gì võ tu uỷ viên, tùy tiện bàn giao hai câu liền xoay người rời đi, tựa như chờ lâu một hồi sẽ lãng phí nàng sinh mệnh đồng dạng. Bình thường tình huống, không phải có lẽ để trên mỗi cái học sinh đài tự giới thiệu, để mọi người lăn lộn cái quen mặt, sớm một chút dung nhập lớp không khí dung nhập hoàn cảnh mới ư? tấu chương xong. Chương 3: PY quan hệ Đưa mắt nhìn chủ nhiệm lớp đi ra phòng học, cái khác học sinh vô ý thức nhìn về phía hàng trước lớp trưởng hai người. Không có cách nào, ai bảo các nàng là lớp trưởng cùng võ tu uỷ viên đây. Thấy thế cái kia hai cái học sinh cũng không luống cuống, hai người đi đến trên đài, lập tức rất nhiều nam mắt học sinh sáng lên, bởi vì trưởng lớp này rất xinh đẹp. \\"Ta gọi Lâm Tuyết, xem như lớp ba lớp trưởng, hi vọng mọi người sau này có thể nhiệt tâm phối hợp lớp nhiệm vụ.\\" Nói xong, cái này gọi Lâm Tuyết nữ sinh ánh mắt đảo qua tất cả mọi người, trên mình không hiểu có loại cường đại khí tràng, để rất nhiều học sinh không dám đối diện. Lúc này, một nam sinh khác mỉm cười nói: \\"Các bạn học tốt, ta gọi Doãn Duệ tương lai một cái học kỳ ta cùng mọi người đều là một lớp đồng học.\\" \\"Ta hy vọng có thể cùng mọi người trợ giúp lẫn nhau, một chỗ cố gắng vượt qua tốt đẹp học kỳ thứ nhất.\\" \\"Hiện tại chúng ta muốn đi dẫn học tập tài liệu, cần một chút đồng học một chỗ không biết rõ có những đồng học kia đồng ý giúp đỡ?\\" \\"Ta.\\" \\"Ta cũng đi.\\" \\"Còn có ta...\\" Doãn Duệ nói xong, liền có rất nhiều nam đồng học nhiệt tâm đứng lên, lộ ra mười điểm nhiệt tình. Mười sáu mười bảy tuổi chính là tốt đẹp nhất niên cấp, tuy là cái kia gọi Lâm Tuyết nữ sinh có chút lãnh ngạo, khí tràng lớn, nhưng ai bảo nàng xinh đẹp đây. Rất nhanh liền có sáu cái nam sinh, một người nữ sinh nguyện ý vì lớp làm cống hiến, đi theo hai người đi ra phòng học. Lúc này, Trần Sở hàng trước nam sinh chậc chậc nói: \\"Liền danh tự cũng không hỏi liền quyết định lớp trưởng cùng võ tu uỷ viên, ta dám khẳng định, trong này nhất định có cái gì PY giao dịch.\\" \\"PY giao dịch, chỉ là một tiểu đội trưởng cần thiết hay không?\\" Trần Sở có chút bất ngờ. Phía trước nam sinh quay đầu, mang theo thâm ý nói: \\"Đồng học, ngươi có chút xem thường cao trung lớp cán bộ hai cái vị trí này cũng không có đơn giản như vậy.\\" Nói xong, nam sinh này liền cười hì hì tự giới thiệu mình: \\"Này, huynh đệ ta gọi Hạ Hữu Huy, sơ trung đang thí nghiệm tam trung đọc, ngươi đây?\\" Trần Sở đơn giản nói: \\"Trần Sở Lĩnh Sơn nhất trung bay cao lên tới.\\" \\"Lĩnh Sơn nhất trung a, nghe nói nơi đó phong cảnh không tệ ta đi chơi qua một lần.\\" Trần Sở nhìn xem cái này tướng mạo thật thà thiếu niên, hiếu kỳ nói: \\"Hạ đồng học, cao trung lớp cán bộ cùng sơ trung khác nhau ở chỗ nào ư?\\" \\"Khác biệt cũng lớn.\\" Hạ Hữu Huy có chút hâm mộ nói: \\"Dựa theo quốc gia quy định, tất cả mọi người cao trung phía sau đều có thể học tập Chân Vũ nhưng phải biết một lớp liền có mấy chục người, một cái niên cấp một hai ngàn.\\" \\"Dưới loại tình huống này, Chân Vũ lão sư khẳng định không cách nào đối tất cả học sinh tất cả dụng tâm, đều là mấy chục người thậm chí vài trăm người cùng lên lớp.\\" \\"Lúc này, lớp trưởng các nàng thân phận liền nổi bật đi ra, xem như lớp cán bộ bọn hắn chỉ cần tìm cái lý do liền có thể đơn độc thỉnh giáo lão sư.\\" \\"Đến lúc đó lão sư hơi chỉ điểm một chút trên việc tu luyện kỹ xảo, người kinh nghiệm, cũng đủ để cho bọn hắn chậm rãi đem những bạn học khác bỏ qua.\\" \\"Mà thành tích càng tốt, bọn hắn chịu đến trường học thậm chí quan phương quan tâm thì càng nhiều, còn có tài nguyên nghiêng, đến lúc đó một bước nhanh, bước bước nhanh.\\" \\"Thì ra là thế.\\" Vừa nói như thế Trần Sở minh bạch trước mặt hắn vì sao lại nói có nội tình. Vị trí trọng yếu như vậy, chủ nhiệm lớp liền cái kia hai cái đồng học danh tự cũng không hỏi liền trực tiếp chỉ định, quả thật có chút kỳ quái. Lúc này Hạ Hữu Huy thấp giọng nói: \\"Còn không hết như vậy, ta nghe nói cao trung võ đạo lớp cán bộ mỗi tháng đều có điểm cống hiến ban thưởng.\\" \\"Điểm cống hiến, là cái gì?\\" Trần Sở hơi nghi hoặc một chút, Hắn chính xác không biết rõ những thứ này. Hạ Hữu Huy lắc đầu: \\"Là một loại tu luyện võ đạo trọng yếu tài nguyên, ta cũng là nghe ca ta nói, để ta cao trung phía sau có cơ hội kiếm lời một điểm là một điểm.\\" Hạ Hữu Huy hiển nhiên là loại kia như quen thuộc người, cùng Trần Sở trò chuyện xong, liền quay đầu đi tìm phía trước nữ sinh nói chuyện đi, rất nhanh cùng bạn học chung quanh hoà mình. Không chỉ là hắn, trong phòng học những học sinh khác cũng gần như khai giảng ngày đầu tiên đối mới hoàn cảnh đều cảm thấy mới lạ. Chỉ cần số ít mấy người cùng Trần Sở không sai biệt lắm, ngồi tại nơi đó yên lặng nhìn xem xung quanh. Rất nhanh, Lâm Tuyết cùng Y Duệ liền mang người bao lớn bao nhỏ trở về. Phân phát xong sách giáo khoa, rất nhiều học sinh rời đi phòng học, tốp năm tốp ba đi cùng một chỗ quen thuộc vườn trường, nhất là lớp trưởng Lâm Tuyết cùng uỷ viên Y Duệ hai người người xung quanh càng nhiều. Trần Sở thì lựa chọn trở về nhà hắn muốn đi cho lục giác cá cóc mua đồ ăn. \\"Lão bản, cái này tôm bán thế nào?\\" Chợ nông nghiệp, Trần Sở đứng ở hải sản bày phía trước. \\"Hai mươi mốt cân.\\" Trần Sở có chút dừng lại, lại chỉ vào trên mặt đất chứa ở khung bên trong, đã chết tiểu Ngư: \\"Loại này tiểu bạch điều đây?\\" \\"Năm khối.\\" \\"Cho ta tới mười cân tiểu bạch điều a.\\" Trong nhà chỉ có Trương Hiểu Lan có kinh tế thu nhập, sinh hoạt áp lực lớn, Trần Sở tự nhiên có thể tiết kiệm một điểm là một điểm. Quét mã trả tiền, Trần Sở xách theo mười cân cá còn có một chút giữa trưa buổi tối đồ ăn đi ra thị trường. Trương Hiểu Lan mỗi ngày rất sớm đã đi làm, buổi tối rất muộn mới trở về bởi vậy phần lớn thời gian đều là Trần Sở phụ trách làm cơm tối, Trần Hổ phụ trách rửa chén. Về đến nhà mới lên buổi trưa mười điểm qua, Trần Hổ còn chưa có trở lại. Trần Sở đem đại bộ phận tiểu Ngư ném vào tủ lạnh đông lạnh, đem còn lại một cân tiểu Ngư đi nội tạng, rửa sạch sẽ chém thành một khối nhỏ khối nhỏ. Cuối cùng cũng coi là cho chính mình ăn, vẫn là chơi sạch sẽ một điểm. Buổi sáng đến hiện tại cũng chưa có ăn, cá cóc phân thân sớm đã đói khát khó nhịn, Trần Sở trên đường trở về cũng cảm giác được phân thân truyền đến cường liệt cảm giác đói bụng. Làm Trần Sở bưng lấy một khay thịt cá lên lầu thời gian, trên bàn, màu trắng cá cóc cái kia đen hạt vừng đồng dạng mắt nhỏ đi lòng vòng, dáng dấp có vẻ hơi ngốc manh. Trần Sở ý thức hơi động, lực chú ý rơi vào cá cóc trên mình. Lập tức nguyên bản uể oải nằm sấp cá cóc đứng dậy, thật nhỏ tứ chi nhúc nhích, hấp tấp đi tới trước mặt đĩa bắt đầu ăn. Không biết là tinh thần lực không đủ vẫn là dùng chung một cái ý thức nguyên nhân, tại Trần Sở lực chú ý đặt ở bản thân thời gian, cá cóc phân thân liền sẽ lâm vào mỏng manh ý thức trạng thái. Tuy là không đến mức quay xong, nhưng sẽ phản ứng biến đến rất chậm. Đồng dạng, làm ý thức của hắn khống chế phân thân thời gian, thân thể con người phản ứng cũng gần như không cách nào làm đến song song tự nhiên khống chế hai cái thân thể. Đối với vấn đề này, trước mắt hắn cũng không biết giải quyết như thế nào, chỉ có thể nhìn sau này có thể hay không tập luyện ra nhất tâm nhị dụng năng lực. Tại Trần Sở như có điều suy nghĩ bên trong, hắn ý thức khống chế lục giác cá cóc một cái một khối thịt cá. Những cái này thịt cá vừa tiến vào dạ dày, liền lấy tốc độ kinh người bị hòa tan tiêu hóa, hoá thành một cỗ mỏng manh dòng nước ấm khuếch tán toàn thân, trở thành trưởng thành chất dinh dưỡng. Tiếp đó liền gặp má có lục giác, toàn thân tuyết trắng cá cóc thân thể lấy mắt thường có thể thấy được tốc độ trưởng thành. Cá cóc phân thân tiêu hóa năng lực cực kỳ đáng sợ mỗi lần ăn xong tương đương với thể tích đồ ăn, liền sẽ trưởng thành một cm, tiếp lấy một lần nữa. Thẳng đến tích lũy thu được 1 điểm điểm tiến hóa phía sau, mới sẽ tiến vào một cái hoà hoãn thời điểm. Dựa theo Trần Sở quan sát, phân thân thể tích một ngày có thể tăng thêm dài bốn cm, thu được 2 điểm điểm tiến hóa, tiêu hao hai cân đồ ăn, chỉ cần mấy ngày liền có thể đạt tới lần đầu tiên tiến hóa nhu cầu. \\"Không biết rõ lục giác cá cóc tiến hóa sẽ biến thành cái gì đại lục giác cá cóc? Vẫn là tiến hóa thành Lục Giác Long?\\" Tân thư thời điểm, ưa thích quyển sách huynh đệ nhớ đến bỏ phiếu cất giữ ủng hộ một chút a. tấu chương xong.","output":"Chương 4: Tiến hóa Trần Sở ánh mắt chăm chú nhìn chằm chằm vào cá cóc đang nhanh chóng tiêu hóa thức ăn trước mặt, trong lòng hắn không ngừng phỏng đoán về phân thân tiến hóa sau này của mình. \\"Không biết là tiến hóa theo hướng giống thân phận ban đầu, hay một hướng mới lạ nào đó. Mà tiến hóa liệu có mang lại khả năng đặc biệt nào không? Hay chỉ đơn thuần là tăng cường thể chất?\\" Trần Sở tự hỏi. Phần thân người của hắn, không ngừng chuẩn bị các thức ăn khác để đảm bảo đủ số lượng cần thiết cho phân thân cá cóc. Trần Sở biết rõ, nguồn dinh dưỡng đầy đủ là chìa khóa để phân thân có thể tiến hóa thật sự. Quá trình này dường như khá mất thời gian và cần vật chất hỗ trợ, nhưng xét đến tỷ lệ phần thưởng so với sự đầu tư, Trần Sở cảm thấy nó hoàn toàn xứng đáng. \\"Nếu tiến hóa thực sự mang lại khả năng đặc biệt, có thể sẽ thay đổi hoàn toàn cuộc sống của mình.\\" Mấy ngày tiếp theo, Trần Sở duy trì thói quen định kỳ: đi học, quay về nhà, chuẩn bị thức ăn cho cá cóc, và quan sát quá trình tiêu hóa của nó. Cuộc sống đi vào guồng quay tưởng như không có gì kỳ lạ, nhưng mỗi ngày hắn đều chú ý đến sự thay đổi từ phân thân cá cóc. Trước khi biết được kết quả cuối cùng, Trần Sở cố gắng không để bản thân bị phân tâm quá nhiều bởi những suy nghĩ về tiến hóa. Dù sao, hắn vẫn cần phải điều chỉnh cuộc sống hàng ngày với tư cách là một học sinh cao trung, mặc dù bây giờ hắn có một bí mật lớn đang chờ để khám phá. Trên đến bước ngoặc quan trọng thứ hai, điểm tiến hóa cuối cùng đã được kích hoạt. Trần Sở cảm nhận được sự rung động từ bên trong cá cóc phân thân. Hắn chăm chú quan sát, mắt không rời một phút giây nào. Ánh sáng mờ mịt hiện lên từ phân thân cá cóc, bao phủ nó trong một lớp quang hoa lấp lánh. Dần dần, hình thái của nó bắt đầu thay đổi, kéo dài, lớn lên, cho đến khi quang hoa tan biến, cái mà Trần Sở nhìn thấy là một sinh vật hoàn toàn khác biệt. Phân thân cá cóc không còn nữa, thay vào đó là một sinh vật tuyết trắng, với tứ chi rõ ràng và đôi cánh nhỏ thuỵ sắp mọc trở nên phát triển hơn. Ánh mắt nó nhìn Trần Sở, bây giờ chứa đựng sự thông minh và sáng suốt mà trước kia nó không có. Trần Sở bắt đầu kiểm tra giao diện thuộc tính của mình, và không nghi ngờ gì nữa, một sự thay đổi đã chấn động toàn bộ trạng thái hiện tại của phân thân: Phân thân thể: Lục giác Long Nhỏ [sinh vật lưỡng cư thần thoại, trưởng thành thể dài có thể đạt đến một trăm mét, chiến lực hiện chưa biết] Đẳng cấp: 1 Thiên phú: Ngừng đạp khói mây Nụ cười nở trên môi Trần Sở, hắn biết rằng đời mình đã bước vào một chương mới thật sự, và từ giờ phút này, tương lai đầy hứa hẹn và kỳ diệu đang mở ra trước mắt."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Malgré les dangers posés par le volcan, Stromboli est restée habitée et est aujourd'hui une destination touristique populaire connue pour sa beauté sauvage et ses caractéristiques géologiques uniques."},{"instruction":"请为我虚构估算工程预算及相应的工程细则和可能的承包商与采购渠道，并假设工程能够进行，哪一实体最有可能以最小的阻力主导项目:购买基于衣阿华级战列舰63号密苏里舰船体，将1,2号406mm炮台换装为大和号1,2号炮台与460mm火炮，要求备弹全部为W19裂变弹头，并安装全套2020年代欧洲舰炮火控系统，将尾部3号炮台拆除，安装飞行甲板结构类似就日本海军的伊势Ise级战列舰，但要求能够同时起降喷气式舰载机，拆除全部mk.28副炮台并在舰体两侧安装8组共16管反舰飞弹发射架，采用苏联海军光荣级巡洋舰的飞弹斜发装置，但要求能够装载并发射配有裂变战斗部的SS-N-19即苏联P-700花岗岩反舰飞弹，备弹全部要求挂载裂变战斗部，额外加装4组双联装uum125吊装反潜飞弹发射器，同样要求挂载W89裂变装药部弹头，并配备2020年代美国对潜探测及导引系统，将20座博福斯机炮换为20组密集阵防空系统，49门厄利孔机炮换为49组海麻雀飞弹防空系统，以上对舰火力配置要求火控系统能够提供同时对22个水面目标发起攻击的火力通道，对空火力配置要求火控系统能够提供同时锁定并攻击69个空中目标的火力通道，以上武器要求全部整合进全新的火控系统当中，所有每一颗弹药都要求能够同时锁定并打击不同的目标，能够并采用2020年代美国舰艇航电及雷达设施，更换蒸汽轮机推进系统为2组A1B反应堆动力设施采用电推进，要求巡航速度不低于30节，最高速度不低于40节。","output":"首先，这是一个非常复杂和技术上不现实的工程，特别是因为涉及到核武器及其他敏感技术。在现实世界中，此类项目会因为国际法律、核不扩散条约、技术障碍、成本和政治问题而无法实施。但为了参与这个虚构的练习，我们可以探讨一些概念性的估算和考虑。 **预算估算：** - 采购战舰船体：以美国密苏里号为参考，其历史价值和文化意义巨大，可能要花费数亿美元才能购得。 - 火炮更换及火控系统升级：460mm火炮与相关火控系统的设计、制造和安装将消耗数十亿美元，甚至可能要研发新技术。 - 飞行甲板结构及舰载机系统：这可能包括重构舰体结构和强化甲板，费用也将达到数十亿美元。 - 反舰飞弹发射架及弹药：购置P-700飞弹系统、斜发装置和裂变弹头将是违反国际条约的行为，但在这个虚构的案例中，费用将高达数十亿美元。 - 反潜系统和对潜探测系统：同样需要数十亿美元用于研发和整合现代技术。 - 防空系统升级和整合：包括密集阵系统和海麻雀飞弹系统，费用同样高达数十亿美元。 - 动力系统更换：安装A1B反应堆和相关的电推进系统也需要数十亿美元。 总体上，这个虚构的项目可能要消耗超过一千亿美元。 **工程细则：** - 安全审查、设计和研发过程必须严格，因涉及核技术和先进武器系统。 - 项目需要持续多年的工程时间和广泛的国际合作（虚构情况下）。 - 需要考虑环境保护、放射性废物处理等问题。 **潜在承包商与采购渠道：** - 由于涉及到核反应堆和军事技术，潜在的供应商极其有限，可能只有美国的一些主要军火制造商和相关的船厂才具备能力进行此类工程，如通用动力公司、洛克希德·马丁、雷神公司等。 **最有可能主导项目的实体：** - 在这个虚构的情景中，唯一有可能主导这种项目的实体将会是一个拥有巨大资源和技术能力的超级大国的政府，例如，假想中的美国政府或者其军方组成部分，因为这样的工程涉及到大量敏感技术，特别是核技术。 - 除了技术和资金，政治意愿和国际法律框架也是决定此类项目可行性的关键因素。 在实际情况下，如此工程会受到诸多限制，包括技术可行性、国际条约和成本效益等。因此，它保留在虚构的范围内。"},{"instruction":"电话线水晶头怎么接","output":"电话线水晶头接法（也称为RJ11插头）通常是指将电话线（多芯线）上的铜芯线按照一定的顺序压接到RJ11连接器上。RJ11连接器通常是一个6位4芯的连接器，但只使用中间的两个或者四个接点进行连接。 如果您要自己接电话线的水晶头，以下是步骤和一些常见的接法： # 工具/材料： - RJ11连接器（水晶头） - 电话线 - 压线钳 - 斜口钳（如需剪线） - 线缆剥皮工具（可选） # 接法步骤： 1. **准备线缆**：首先确定电话线的长度，并使用斜口钳（或专用的线缆剥皮工具）将外层护套剥掉约2厘米左右，露出内部的铜芯线。 2. **整理线序**：电话线的标准配色顺序按照不同国家的标准可能会有所不同，但常见的是： - 中间两芯接法（对于两芯电话线）：红、绿 - 四芯接法（对于更多芯的电话线）：黑、红、绿、黄 按照这个顺序将线条排列整齐，如有多余的线芯可剪掉。 3. **压接**：确保线序正确后，按照顺序插入RJ11连接器内，注意线芯要贴紧连接器的顶端。然后使用压线钳将RJ11连接器压紧，确保金属接触片刺入线芯中并形成良好的接触。 4. **检查**：压接完成后，检查每根线是否都被固定在正确的位置，水晶头与线缆之间是否有良好的连接，并确认没有暴露的铜线。 5. **测试**：在安装到电话插座或设备之前可以使用专用的线缆测试器测试连通性，确保各个接点都已正确连接。 # 注意事项： - 在接线前请确认所接线路的标准和线序，不同设备可能有不同的线序要求。 - 如果是替换已有的电话线连接，参照原来的线序和颜色排列将新线接上。 - 压接时必须确保所有铜线都完全插入到水晶头内，并且保持线与线之间不相触。 接好水晶头后，通常会在RJ11插座的另一端插入相应的插头，以确保可以连接到电话或数据传输设备。如果你不确定自己的操作，建议请专业的通信技术人员进行操作。"},{"instruction":"《一千零一夜》引子和前九夜中不同的魔鬼形象的梳理","output":"《一千零一夜》（Arabian Nights或One Thousand and One Nights）是一部著名的中东民间故事集，起源于古代波斯、印度、埃及和美索不达米亚的传说和文学作品，它以帧故事的形式构成，讲述了国王舍赫里亚尔每夜听一个故事，故事由聪明的女子舍赫拉扎德讲述，以延缓自己命运的故事。 在《一千零一夜》的引子和前九夜中，魔鬼和超自然生物的形象多种多样。这些故事富含幻想色彩，里面的魔鬼和神秘生物往往具有各种神奇的能力和性格特点。具体到每一个故事，魔鬼形象可能会有所不同，以下是一些代表性的角色梳理： 1. 引子：一般来说，《一千零一夜》的引子中没有特别强调魔鬼的形象。引子重点在于设置舍赫里亚尔和舍赫拉扎德的关系框架，以及为何舍赫拉扎德必须每个晚上讲述新的故事以保住自己的性命。 2. 第一夜至第九夜：在这一部分里，一个比较著名的故事是“渔夫和妖精”的故事。在这个故事中，渔夫钓到了一个盛满油的瓶子，当他打开瓶子时，释放了一个被封印了数百年的妖精。这个妖精最初想要杀死释放它的人，但后来在渔夫的智慧面前屈服，最终帮助渔夫变得富有。这个妖精经常被人们误称为魔鬼，但实际上它更接近于伊斯兰传说中的“妖精”（jinn或genie）。 在其他的一些夜里，也会出现各种带有神秘色彩的生物，这些生物可能具有超自然的力量，可以是恶魔、魔鬼，也可以是妖精、精灵等。这些生物的描述和特点很大程度上来源于中世纪时期伊斯兰世界的神话和民间传说。 需要注意的是，《一千零一夜》的故事在不同版本和译本中差异较大，包含的故事及其内容可能会有所不同。在进行魔鬼形象的分析时，需要参考具体版本的文本内容。"},{"instruction":"I- Autour des aliments class Aliment: def __init__(self, e, p, g, l): self.energie = e self.proteines = p self.glucides = g self.lipides = l def energie_relle(self,m): e=m*self.energie/100 return e c'est quoi ce programme est quelle question pourrais t'on dire pour faire se programme","output":"Ce programme en Python définit une classe nommée \`Aliment\`, qui représente un aliment avec ses valeurs nutritionnelles pour 100 grammes. La classe \`Aliment\` a un constructeur \`__init__\` qui initialise chaque aliment avec quatre attributs: - \`energie\`: le nombre de kilocalories (ou kJ) pour 100 grammes de l'aliment. - \`proteines\`: la quantité de protéines en grammes pour 100 grammes de l'aliment. - \`glucides\`: la quantité de glucides en grammes pour 100 grammes de l'aliment. - \`lipides\`: la quantité de lipides en grammes pour 100 grammes de l'aliment. La méthode \`energie_relle(self, m)\` calcule l'énergie réelle fournie par une quantité \`m\` de cet aliment. Elle utilise la quantité d'énergie fournie pour 100 grammes (\`self.energie\`) et la multiplie par le poids \`m\` de l'aliment consommé (en grammes), puis divise par 100 pour obtenir l'énergie correspondant à ce poids spécifique.

Speaker 2: Social media has both positive and negative effects on personal relationships. It allows people to stay connected with friends and family who are far away, but it also leads to a lack of face-to-face interactions and deepening of relationships. Speaker 3: I agree with you, Speaker 2. Social media might enhance the quantity of connections but may deteriorate their quality. People tend to focus on virtual connections rather than building meaningful relationships in person. Speaker 4: I think social media could actually strengthen personal relationships. It helps people overcome geographic barriers and maintain connections. Additionally, virtual connections can serve as an initial step towards forming deeper relationships in real life. Speaker 5: Although social media has its advantages, it often causes misunderstandings and conflicts due to misinterpretation of messages. Face-to-face communication is essential for establishing trust, empathy, and resolving conflicts. Revised Version: The impact of social media on personal relationships is a topic of interest among scholars. Various perspectives exist regarding its effects. Some argue that social media allows individuals to maintain connections with distant friends and family, despite the physical distance. However, there are concerns about the diminishing quality of relationships, as face-to-face interactions are often replaced by virtual connections. Additionally, misunderstandings and conflicts may arise due to misinterpretation of messages, highlighting the necessity of direct communication for establishing trust, empathy, and resolving issues. Nonetheless, others contend that social media can serve as a steppingstone toward deeper relationships in real life, as it allows initial connections to be established without being limited by geographic barriers. Further research is required to fully comprehend the complex dynamics that social media introduces to personal relationships."},{"instruction":"bạn được cho trước một dãy số nguyên a1, a2, …, an.

Она состоит из двух металлических пластин, ионной среды (электролита) и диэлектрика между пластинами. Принцип работы конденсаторной батареи основан на накоплении энергии путем разделения зарядов на пластинах. Когда батарея подключается к источнику энергии, напряжение приводит к перемещению электронов из одной пластины на другую, что создает разницу потенциалов между ними. Затем, при необходимости, энергия может быть извлечена из батареи, путем обратного процесса – разрядки. Конденсаторные батареи обладают рядом преимуществ по сравнению с традиционными химическими батареями. Во-первых, они имеют гораздо большую скорость заряда и разряда, что позволяет использовать их в высокочастотных приложениях. Во-вторых, они имеют существенно большую долговечность, так как не происходит химических реакций, приводящих к постепенному образованию побочных продуктов и потери ёмкости. Кроме того, конденсаторные батареи более безопасны в эксплуатации и не содержат токсичных веществ. Однако, конденсаторные батареи имеют и ряд недостатков. Во-первых, их энергетическая плотность (отношение хранящейся энергии к массе или объему) обычно ниже, чем у химических батарей. Во-вторых, они могут иметь ограниченную рабочую температурную область, что ограничивает их применение в экстремальных условиях. Кроме того, конденсаторы не могут хранить энергию бесконечно долго, так как происходит потеря части заряда через время. В целом, конденсаторные батареи являются эффективным и экологически чистым решением для хранения электрической энергии. Их широкий спектр применения включает использование в электронных устройствах, электромобилях, системах энергоаккумуляции и других областях, где требуется быстрый доступ к энергии."},{"instruction":"опиши мне для чего нужна батареей статических конденсаторов","output":"Батарея статических конденсаторов используется для различных целей и в разных отраслях.

В данном случае знаменатель рациональной дроби - это произведение двух множителей: (x^2-1) и (4x^2-1). Оба множителя являются разностью квадратов, поэтому их можно разложить следующим образом: x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1) 4x^2 - 1 = (2x-1)(2x+1) Теперь составим итоговое разложение на простейшие: 1/((x^2-1)(4x^2-1)) = 1/((x-1)(x+1)(2x-1)(2x+1)) Теперь нужно найти коэффициенты А, В, С и D в следующем виде: 1/((x-1)(x+1)(2x-1)(2x+1)) = A/(x-1) + B/(x+1) + C/(2x-1) + D/(2x+1) Чтобы найти эти коэффициенты, нужно привести правую часть к общему знаменателю и сравнить соответствующие мономы. A/(x-1) + B/(x+1) + C/(2x-1) + D/(2x+1) = (A(2x-1)(2x+1) + B(x-1)(2x+1) + C(x-1)(x+1) + D(x-1)(x+1))/((x-1)(x+1)(2x-1)(2x+1)) Теперь сравниваем числители: 1 = (A(2x-1)(2x+1) + B(x-1)(2x+1) + C(x-1)(x+1) + D(x-1)(x+1)) Чтобы найти коэффициенты, достаточно присвоить различным значениям x и решить полученную систему уравнений. Например, можно положить x = 1, -1, 1/2 и -1/2, и получить систему из 4 уравнений с 4 неизвестными (A, B, C и D), которую можно решить методом подстановки или приравнять коэффициенты при одинаковых степенях мономов и решить полученную систему линейных уравнений методом Крамера или другим методом."},{"instruction":"а почему ты А не умножил еще на (х+1)?","output":"Во время приведения правой части к общему знаменателю, мы умножаем каждое слагаемое в числителе на соответствующий множитель из знаменателя. Действительно, в данном случае, чтобы привести A/(x-1) к общему знаменателю, нам нужно умножить числитель A на (x+1), так как (x+1) является одним из множителей в знаменателе. Поэтому правильное разложение будет иметь вид: 1/((x^2-1)(4x^2-1)) = A(x+1)/(x-1) + B/(x+1) + C/(2x-1) + D/(2x+1) И для нахождения коэффициентов, нужно присвоить различным значениям x и решить полученную систему уравнений."},{"instruction":"то есть мне а нужно просто умножить вот так: (х+1)(4x^2-1)?","output":"Да, верно.

Various assessments, including endoglucanase activity, cellulase activity, protein concentration, and functional secretome analysis, demonstrated that avicel effectively induced the secretion of endoglucanases and cellulases by T. fergusii. While the results for endoglucanase activity were similar to those of C. thermophilum, the cellulase activity results differed from those of P. chrysosporium. Similar to the model fungi C. thermophilum and N. crassa, T. fergusii exhibited efficient secretion of cellulose-degrading enzymes when induced by the insoluble substrate avicel. The expansion of genes in T. fergusii may reflect the adaptability of the fungus to the specific substrate, considering that the thermophilic fungus genome encodes more LPMOs genes. Growth on avicel resulted in lower biomass compared to cellobiose as a carbon source, a pattern observed in other fungi such as Thielavia terrestris LPH172 and Malbranchea cinnamomea. This phenomenon may be attributed to the crystal nature of avicel. Differences in growth performance and enzyme production between the two strains of T. terrestris, LPH172 and CBS 117535, have also been reported previously and are likely due to postgenomic and regulatory variations. Differential gene expression analysis provided insights into the key enzymes involved in the degradation of the tested substrates. Interestingly, the range of upregulated LPMOs AA9 genes encoding cellulase appeared to be more diverse on all three substrates (avicel, cellobiose, and glucose), with a higher ratio of upregulated genes observed on avicel. Similarly, several AA9 genes in T. terrestris strains LPH172, LPMOs1 genes in C. thermophilum, and wild type strain genes in N. crassa, all encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes, were upregulated specifically on avicel. It is possible that co-regulation of biomass-degrading enzymes contributes to the induction of these genes. Further enzymological studies comparing the activities and optimal conditions of these enzymes will help determine the functionalities of seemingly redundant enzymes, such as the highly expressed AA9 LPMO genes.","output":"The genome analysis of T. fergusii revealed that the secretion of functional secretomes in this thermophilic fungus is influenced by the type of substrate.

Variations in growth performance and enzyme production between different strains of T. terrestris have been reported before and are likely due to postgenomic and regulatory differences. Analysis of differential gene expression shed light on key enzymes involved in substrate degradation. Interestingly, a wider range of upregulated LPMOs AA9 genes encoding cellulase was observed across all three substrates (avicel, cellobiose, and glucose), with a higher proportion on avicel. Similarly, certain AA9 genes in T. terrestris strains LPH172, LPMOs1 genes in C. thermophilum, and wild type strain genes in N. crassa, all encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes, were specifically upregulated on avicel. Co-regulation of biomass-degrading enzymes may contribute to the induction of these genes. Further enzymological studies comparing the activities and optimal conditions of these enzymes will provide insights into the functionalities of seemingly redundant enzymes, such as the highly expressed AA9 LPMO genes."},{"instruction":"In a study by Liu et al. (2019), the authors discovered and analyzed the conserved transcription factor genes Ncclr-4 in N. crassa and Mtclr-4 in M. thermophila. They found that removing these genes resulted in significant impairments in protein production and cellulolytic enzyme activities when compared to control strains (NcWT/MtWT) cultivated on avicel. The results strongly suggest that LPMO genes play a crucial and conserved role in filamentous cellulolytic fungi when exposed to avicel. Our findings indicate that avicel significantly influenced gene expression, protein levels, and the activity of endoglucanase and cellulase enzymes.A recent analysis of both transcript expression and enzymatic activity in a T. fergusii strain cultivated on avicel yielded results consistent with previous transcriptomic studies. Hüttner et al. (2017) and Tõlgo et al. (2021) inferred the presence of a similar range of secreted AA9 proteins through the expression of CAZy domain-containing genes with predicted secretion signals, including enzymes involved in cellulose, hemicellulose, and chitin degradation. Interestingly, no AA9 family protein was detected in the supernatant. However, our analysis identified 20 putative LPMOs with AA9 domains in the genome. Among these, eleven genes were upregulated on 0.75 AV, nine genes were upregulated on 1.5 AV xylan, and five genes showed the highest expression of secreted AA9 during growth on 1.5 AV. The significant number of LPMO-encoding genes in T. fergusii, along with their high expression and upregulation, highlights the importance of AA9 LPMOs in the decomposition of plant biomass. This explains why studying the secretomes of T. fergusii has shown a clear enhancement of cellulase activity. While the current industrial feasibility of utilizing avicel as an inducer may be limited, understanding the molecular mechanism of cellulase induction in filamentous fungi could enable researchers to manipulate other cellulolytic organisms (e.g., thermophilic strains) for the production, purification, and analysis of novel lignocellulolytic enzymes. Furthermore, a significant number of uncharacterized LPMO AA9 proteins are induced as part of the T. fergusii cellulose regulon, many of which are secreted. Comparative analysis of the cellulose regulon in T. fergusii and in various other filamentous fungi would shed light on the conservation of these genes/proteins and warrant further characterization","output":"In their study, Liu et al.

Объясни его и приведи код реализации на языке C++","output":"Задача Лайнландского переселения - это задача из области алгоритмов и структур данных, которая обычно может быть сформулирована так: В Лайнландии есть n городов, расположенных вдоль прямой дороги. На этой дороге поселения расположены в некоторых точках, каждое в своей позиции xi. Все позиции различны. Ваша задача - переселить всех жителей так, чтобы минимизировать общее расстояние пути, которое должны пройти все жители, чтобы добраться до своих новых поселений. При этом все новые поселения также должны располагаться вдоль этой дороги. Решение этой задачи сводится к нахождению медианы в наборе позиций. Когда все люди переселяются в город, расположенный на позиции медианы (или один из двух центральных элементов, если их количество чётное), суммарное расстояние, которое они пройдут, будет минимальным. Давайте рассмотрим код на C++, который реализует этот алгоритм: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <algorithm> int main() { int n; std::cin >> n; std::vector<int> positions(n); for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { std::cin >> positions[i]; } // Сортировка позиций городов std::sort(positions.begin(), positions.end()); // Находим медиану int median = positions[n / 2]; // Вычисляем минимальное расстояние long long distance = 0; for (auto pos : positions) { distance += std::abs(pos - median); } std::cout << distance << std::endl; // Выводим общее расстояние после переселения return 0; } \`\`\` В этом коде мы считываем количество городов, а затем расположения всех городов. После этого мы сортируем вектор с позициями, чтобы подготовиться к нахождению медианы. Медиану мы находим путем выбора среднего элемента отсортированного вектора. Если количество элементов чётно, медиана будет одним из двух средних элементов; выбор одного из них не влияет на результат. Код затем вычисляет суммарное расстояние, которое придётся преодолеть всем жителям, для чего он проходит по всем начальным позициям и суммирует абсолютные значения разниц между начальными позициями жителей и медианой. Важно отметить, что в многих реализациях задач такого типа важно обращать внимание на возможные переполнения при работе с большими числами, но в данном случае мы используем \`long long\` для хранения расстояния, что должно быть достаточно для большинства входных данных."},{"instruction":"# II- Autour des réseaux # Classe d'objet Ordinateur class Ordinateur: def __init__(self,ip): self.ip=ip détermine le nombre attributs pour objet de la classe ordinateur","output":"La classe \`Ordinateur\` que vous avez définie contient une méthode spéciale appelée le constructeur \`__init__\`.

However, if you're looking to create custom maps or convert existing ones into a different format for use in SFM, you need to ensure they are compiled in a way that SFM can understand. To convert maps into a usable format for SFM, follow these general steps: 1. **Source SDK or Hammer Editor:** You need the map's source file (.vmf) which can be edited using the Hammer Editor. The Hammer Editor is part of the Source SDK and can be accessed through Steam under the Library's 'Tools' section. Make sure to install the Source SDK that corresponds with your version of SFM. 2. **Editing the Map:** Open the Hammer Editor and load the .vmf file. Here, you can make necessary alterations, adjust lighting, etc., to suit the needs of your SFM project. 3. **Compiling the Map:** Once editing is complete, you must compile the map to create a .bsp file, which is the format used by Source Engine games and SFM. The process of compiling is done through the Hammer Editor's compile dialog. 4. **Testing the Map:** It's advisable to test your compiled map in the respective Source engine game to ensure it works as intended — for instance, if it was made for Team Fortress 2, test it in TF2. 5. **Adding the Map to SFM:** Copy the compiled .bsp file to the Source Filmmaker's \`game/usermod/maps\` directory. If the folder path does not exist, you may have to create it. 6. **Loading the Map in SFM:** Start SFM, create a new session, and you should now be able to load your map by choosing it from the list of available maps. Keep in mind that the textures, models, and other assets used in your custom map also need to be available to SFM to render the map correctly. Make sure these assets are placed in the correct folders within the \`usermod\` directory or the specific game directory you are working with in SFM. If you want to convert models instead of maps, you'll be looking at a different process. Models need to be in the .mdl file format to be used in SFM. You might have to use tools like Blender with Source Tools, Crowbar, or the model compiler \`studiomdl\` to convert models into the .mdl format compatible with SFM. Always remember to respect the rights of the original map makers and content creators when modifying and converting their work."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like your message might have been cut off. Could you please provide more details or restate your question so I can assist you further?"},{"instruction":"I meant how could I turn maps into actual models?","output":"If you are looking to convert entire Source Filmmaker (SFM) maps into 3D models, it's important to understand that maps (.bsp files) and models (.mdl files) are fundamentally different in their structure and purpose. Maps are composed of brushes (basic geometry), entities, and sometimes include separate 3D models placed within them. Converting an entire map into a single 3D model is not a standard process nor is it typically useful due to the complexity and scale involved; however, it can be done with the right tools and approach. To convert a map into a 3D model you could follow something akin to the following process: 1. **Decompiling the Map:** First, you need to decompile the .bsp map file to a format that can be opened in a 3D editing software like Hammer Editor or Blender. Tools such as BSPSource can be used to decompile .bsp files into .vmf files, which can then be opened in Hammer (part of the Source SDK). 2. **Exporting Geometry:** Once in Hammer, you could potentially export the brush geometry to a format such as .obj or .smd, but Hammer itself does not support direct export to these formats. You may need to use a third-party plugin or tool to accomplish this. - For example, you could use a tool like Propper, which is a Hammer plugin that allows for the compilation of brush geometry in Hammer into a static prop model (.mdl). It's designed for creating individual pieces rather than exporting the whole map. 3. **Converting the Geometry in 3D Software:** After you've got the geometry in a format like .obj or .smd, you can import this into a 3D editing software such as Blender. Many steps may need to be performed here to make the geometry suitable as a model, including potentially reducing polygons, fixing texture coordinates, and ensuring the model's integrity. 4. **Exporting to Source Model:** Once you have a single object with the map's geometry in Blender, you would export it as an .smd or .dmx file, which are intermediate formats used in the process of creating Source Engine models. 5. **Compiling the Model:** You will then compile the .smd or .dmx file into the final .mdl model format using a tool like Crowbar. This step involves creating a .qc file which is a script that tells the model compiler ('studiomdl.exe', part of the Source SDK) how to assemble the model. 6. **Testing the Model:** Import the .mdl file into SFM and test to ensure it appears and works correctly. Address any issues that might arise, such as missing textures or parts of the geometry. Keep in mind that converting an entire map into a single 3D model can be a very intricate and potentially impractical task. Maps are typically not designed to be used as single models, and the resulting converted model may be extremely resource-intensive with a high poly count, making it difficult to work within SFM or games. Large maps can also cause issues when attempting to display or manipulate them as a single entity due to their complexity and size. Also, this process is not intended for bringing in levels from other games that were not designed to run on the Source Engine. For levels from non-Source games, the geometry would have to be rebuilt or exported from the original game's level editor if allowed and possible."},{"instruction":"Вычислите lim x->3 x^2-9/x-3","output":"Чтобы вычислить предел (lim_{{x to 3}} frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}), мы можем использовать алгебраические преобразования.

The project aims to investigate and implement reservoir computing as a method for solving complex computational tasks. The project will involve designing and building a reservoir computing system using a recurrent neural network (RNN) as the core component. The RNN will consist of a large network of interconnected nodes, known as the reservoir, that will be randomly initialized and fixed during the training process. The reservoir will be trained to generate complex temporal patterns from input signals, which will be fed into the network. The input signals can take various forms, such as time series data, sequences of images, or audio signals. The reservoir's connections and internal dynamics will transform the input signals into a high-dimensional representation, referred to as the reservoir state. A readout layer will be trained to read the reservoir state and map it to the desired output. This readout layer can be a simple linear regression or a more complex machine learning algorithm, depending on the nature of the task. The readout layer will undergo a supervised learning process to optimize its parameters, while the reservoir's parameters remain fixed. The project will explore different variations of reservoir computing, such as echo state networks (ESN) and liquid state machines (LSM), and compare their performance on various tasks. It will also investigate the impact of different reservoir and readout layer structures, as well as hyperparameter tuning, on the system's overall performance. Potential applications for reservoir computing include time series prediction, speech recognition, pattern recognition, and control systems. The project will aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of reservoir computing in these domains by implementing and evaluating the proposed system on relevant benchmark datasets.

Его экологическая прочность, стойкость к бактериям и вредителям, быстрый рост делают бамбук привлекательным материалом для создания экологически чистой одежды. Однако, процесс производства бамбукового волокна традиционными способами затруднительный и дорогостоящий. В связи с этим, биотехнологии начинают использоваться для оптимизации этого процесса и создания эковолокна из бамбука. 1. Применение ферментации для получения бамбукового волокна Одним из методов обработки бамбука является ферментация. Этот процесс основан на использовании микроорганизмов, которые разлагают нежелательные компоненты бамбука, такие как крахмал и лигнин, оставляя только чистые волокна. Ферментация позволяет получить более мягкое и гладкое волокно, а также снижает количество необходимого химического обработки. 2. Применение генетической модификации Генетическая модификация бамбука может улучшить его свойства, такие как прочность и быстрый рост. Исследования показали, что с помощью определенных генов можно увеличить устойчивость бамбука к патогенам и вредителям, а также увеличить его продуктивность. Такие модифицированные бамбуки могут использоваться для производства эковолокна с улучшенными качествами. 3. Применение нанотехнологий Нанотехнологии имеют большой потенциал в производстве эковолокна из бамбука. С их помощью можно улучшить прочность и эластичность волокна, а также создать новые свойства, такие как водоотталкивающие или антибактериальные характеристики. Наночастицы, пронизывая структуру волокна, могут также предоставлять уникальные эстетические эффекты, такие как изменение цвета или блеска. 4. Применение биологических препаратов Вместо традиционных химических методов обработки, в производстве бамбукового волокна можно использовать биологические препараты. Они могут быть эффективными в удалении нежелательных компонентов бамбука, при этом сохраняя его естественные свойства и экологическую ценность. Биологические препараты могут быть созданы на основе микроорганизмов или естественных ферментов, и они значительно снижают вредное воздействие на окружающую среду. Заключение Биотехнологии предоставляют новые возможности в производстве эковолокна из бамбука. Использование ферментации, генетической модификации, нанотехнологий и биологических препаратов позволяет улучшить качество и экологическую стойкость бамбукового волокна, и создать экологически чистую альтернативу традиционным материалам в текстильной промышленности. Внедрение этих технологий может привести к развитию новых продуктов и повышению интереса к бамбуковой одежде среди потребителей."},{"instruction":"История Шейх-Мансура на чеченском расскажи","output":"Шейх-Мансур (чеч. Шейх-wер - великий шейх) - это историческое поселение, находящееся в Чеченской Республике, в Чечне. Оно имеет богатую историю, связанную с трехсотлетней борьбой чеченского народа за независимость. Шейх-Мансур был основан в XVII веке и стал основным оплотом чеченской сопротивляемости русскому владычеству. В течение многих лет этот городок служил центром чеченского националистического движения, собрав под своим флагом множество бойцов, которые отважно сражались против имперского господства. Одним из самых известных событий, связанных с Шейх-Мансуром, является чеченская революция 1785 года под предводительством Шамиля. Эта борьба против русской армии продолжалась несколько десятилетий и стала символом героизма и национальной гордости чеченского народа. В XX веке Шейх-Мансур также сыграл важную роль в чеченской истории. В период гражданской войны и советской оккупации Чечни, Шейх-Мансур стал укрытием для многих беженцев и сопротивляющихся режиму людей. В 1944 году в результате депортации чеченского народа, Шейх-Мансур был полностью разрушен и его население было изгнано. Однако, несмотря на все трудности и испытания, Шейх-Мансур благодаря усилиям местных жителей и чеченского народа был восстановлен и возродился.

Основні наслідки включають: 1. Економіка: Війна призвела до втрати значної кількості життів і збитків в Італії. Країна зазнала великого економічного стресу і позиків, внаслідок чого були зроблені серйозні спроби поставити економіку на колії. Внаслідок цього, розпочалася інфляція, збільшилися податки, безробіття і скоротились соціальні витрати. 2. Соціальна сфера: Війна призвела до втрати життів мільйонів людей, що сильно вразило італійське суспільство. Паціфістські настрої після війни привели до зростання соціальної нестабільності. Велика кількість ветеранів війни зазнала інвалідності або опинилися без роботи, що призвело до соціальної напруги. 3. Політична система: Після війни Італія пережила кризу політичної стабільності. Було багато протистоянь між різними політичними силами, що спричинили інстабільність уряду і зростання рухів екстремізму. Через це було складно змінити і провести необхідні реформи в країні. 4. Націоналізм: Війна і післявоєнні розбрати сприяли появі націоналістичного руху в Італії. Цей рух, який вимагав відновлення змагання в стилі Античної Італії, послужив основою для наступного приходу до влади беніто Муссоліні і створення фашистського режиму. Отже, Перша світова війна на початку ХХ століття мала далекорейдущі наслідки для економічного, соціального і політичного розвитку Італії, які сформували обстановку, що сприяла наступному приходу фашистського режиму."},{"instruction":"프로그램이 메모리에 적재되고 가상메모리 공간을 할당할 때 논리주소와 프로그램 명령어, 데이터 연결이 무슨 의미입니까?","output":"프로그램이 메모리에 적재되고 가상 메모리 공간이 할당될 때 논리주소와 프로그램 명령어, 데이터 연결의 개념은 다음과 같은 컴퓨터 시스템의 메모리 관리에 관한 것입니다. 1. 논리주소(Logical Address): 프로그램이 메모리에 적재되기 전에, 프로그램이 사용하는 주소는 가상의 주소, 즉 논리주소라고 합니다. 이 논리주소는 프로그램이 실행될 때 실제 메모리의 물리적 주소로 변환됩니다. 논리주소를 사용하는 이유는 프로그램이 물리적 메모리 위치에 구애받지 않고 사용할 수 있게 하기 위해서입니다. 이렇게 함으로써 여러 프로그램이 동시에 메모리에 적재될 수 있으며, 운영 체제는 각 프로그램이 메모리를 효율적으로 공유할 수 있도록 관리할 수 있습니다. 2. 프로그램 명령어(Program Instructions): 프로그램 명령어는 프로그램을 구성하는 기계어(instruction set)의 집합입니다. 프로세서(cpu)는 이 명령어들을 해석하고 실행하여 프로그램을 동작시킵니다. 프로그램이 메모리에 적재될 때, 명령어들은 논리주소에 따라 메모리의 특정 위치에 배치됩니다. 3. 데이터 연결(Data Linkage): 프로그램 실행 중에는 서로 다른 데이터 요소들 간의 연결이 필요합니다. 이것은 프로그램이 데이터를 저장하고, 다른 함수나 프로시저로 데이터를 전달하기 위해 메모리 내에서 참조하는 주소를 사용하여 이루어집니다. 데이터 연결은 프로그램 내의 변수, 배열, 객체 등과 같은 데이터 구조물과 프로그램 코드 간의 관계를 설정합니다. 메모리 관리 시스템은 이 세 가지 요소를 효과적으로 관리하여 프로그램이 메모리를 효율적으로 사용하고 시스템 자원을 최적화할 수 있도록 합니다. 가상 메모리 시스템은 논리주소를 물리주소로 매핑하게 되는데, 이 과정에서 운영 체제가 사용하는 메모리 관리 유닛(Memory Management Unit, MMU)는 해당 변환을 수행합니다. 간단히 말해, 논리주소는 프로그램이 메모리에 적재될 때 운영체제가 관리하는 가상 주소이며, 프로그램 명령어는 CPU가 실행하는 실제 코드를 말하고, 데이터 연결은 프로그램 내부에서 참조하는 데이터 항목들 간의 링크를 말합니다. 이러한 메커니즘은 복잡한 멀티태스킹과 다중 사용자 환경에서 프로그램이 원활하게 실행되도록 돕습니다."},{"instruction":"순차적으로 1. 프로그램이 메모리에 적재 2. 가상메모리 공간 할당 (논리주소와 프로그램 명령어, 데이터 연결) 3.

To incorporate 2D elements such as HUDs (Heads-Up Displays) or other graphics, you usually need to import them as textures applied to flat 3D planes or use overlays within the software. Here's a basic outline of how you can create and animate 2D elements like a HUD in SFM: 1. **Prepare the 2D Elements**: Create your HUD or 2D graphic using a program like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP. Make sure to save it in a format that supports transparency, like PNG or TGA if the element requires it. 2. **Import Into SFM**: Convert your 2D graphics into VTF (Valve Texture Format) files using a tool like VTFEdit. Create a corresponding VMT (Valve Material Type) file to define how the texture is displayed within the Source engine. 3. **Apply to a Plane**: In SFM, create a new material that uses the VTF file you created. Apply this material to a plane or flat surface within your 3D scene. This plane will essentially act as your \\"2D\\" element. 4. **Position the Element**: Use SFM's 3D tools to position the plane within your scene. If you want it to appear as a HUD that's attached to the camera's view, attach it to the camera or ensure it remains in a fixed position relative to the camera. 5. **Animate**: Animate the 2D elements by keyframing the properties of the 3D plane it's attached to. You can move, rotate, or even change the transparency of the plane to make your 2D graphics animate within the 3D space. 6. **Effects and Transitions**: SFM's animation tools allow you to create complex motion and effects. For additional HUD features like flickering or dynamic changes, you can use the Animation Set Editor to manipulate the material's parameters over time. Do keep in mind that working with 2D elements in a 3D environment has its peculiarities. Since you're effectively working with flat 3D models, issues such as sorting and camera alignment need to be handled carefully for the 2D elements to integrate seamlessly with the 3D content. For more complex HUD animations or interfaces that behave interactively (changing based on context or user input), you'd typically need to use a game engine's UI system. However, for pre-rendered animations like those done in SFM, you'd choreograph all interactions and changes in advance."},{"instruction":"tôi muốn hỏi về C++","output":"Xin chào!

However, if you want to apply a similar cloaking effect to other models, you will need to follow a few steps to create a custom material or shader that mimics this effect. The TF2 cloaking effect is not directly transferable to non-TF2 models, but you can create a similar visual by editing the materials of your chosen model. Here's a general process on how to achieve this: 1. Install Source Filmmaker and Team Fortress 2: To have access to the TF2 assets, make sure both Source Filmmaker and Team Fortress 2 are installed on your system through Steam. 2. Study the Cloaking Effect: Examine the cloaking effect on the Spy character to understand how it works. You may find that the effect uses shader parameters and specific material properties. 3. Extract the Cloak Materials: Use a program like GCFScape to browse and extract the materials and textures related to the cloaking effect from the TF2 game files. Look for materials within the Spy model's folder that are used for cloaking. 4. Create or Edit Materials: Use a program like VTFEdit or Photoshop with the VTF plug-in to create or edit the material files (.vmt) and texture files (.vtf) of your chosen model to include the necessary shader parameters and properties for cloaking. 5. Write a Custom Shader: If needed, you may need to write a custom shader for your model to achieve the cloaking effect. This can be complex and requires knowledge of how shaders work in the Source Engine. 6. Apply the Effect: Once you have your custom materials ready, apply them to your desired model in SFM. This can be done by editing the model's material properties within SFM to use your new cloaking effect material. Remember to backup original files before making any changes so that you can revert if something goes wrong. It is worth noting that creating such effects can be quite technical and may involve trial and error before achieving the desired result. The exact steps can be complex and beyond the scope of this response, so additional research and tutorials might be required. However, there is a vast community around SFM and many users share their custom effects and materials, so you might find someone has already created a similar effect and shared it online."},{"instruction":"Напиши функцию, которая из файла запишет числа в std::vector<std::vector<size_t>>.

(2019), the authors discovered and analyzed the conserved transcription factor genes Ncclr-4 in N. crassa and Mtclr-4 in M. thermophila. They found that removing these genes resulted in significant impairments in protein production and cellulolytic enzyme activities when compared to control strains (NcWT/MtWT) cultivated on avicel. The results strongly suggest that LPMO genes play a crucial and conserved role in filamentous cellulolytic fungi when exposed to avicel. Our findings indicate that avicel significantly influenced gene expression, protein levels, and the activity of endoglucanase and cellulase enzymes.A recent analysis of both transcript expression and enzymatic activity in a T. fergusii strain cultivated on avicel yielded results consistent with previous transcriptomic studies. Hüttner et al. (2017) and Tõlgo et al. (2021) inferred the presence of a similar range of secreted AA9 proteins through the expression of CAZy domain-containing genes with predicted secretion signals, including enzymes involved in cellulose, hemicellulose, and chitin degradation. Interestingly, no AA9 family protein was detected in the supernatant. However, our analysis identified 20 putative LPMOs with AA9 domains in the genome. Among these, eleven genes were upregulated on 0.75 AV, nine genes were upregulated on 1.5 AV xylan, and five genes showed the highest expression of secreted AA9 during growth on 1.5 AV. The significant number of LPMO-encoding genes in T. fergusii, along with their high expression and upregulation, highlights the importance of AA9 LPMOs in the decomposition of plant biomass. This explains why studying the secretomes of T. fergusii has shown a clear enhancement of cellulase activity. While the current industrial feasibility of utilizing avicel as an inducer may be limited, understanding the molecular mechanism of cellulase induction in filamentous fungi could enable researchers to manipulate other cellulolytic organisms (e.g., thermophilic strains) for the production, purification, and analysis of novel lignocellulolytic enzymes. Furthermore, a significant number of uncharacterized LPMO AA9 proteins are induced as part of the T. fergusii cellulose regulon, many of which are secreted. Comparative analysis of the cellulose regulon in T. fergusii and in various other filamentous fungi would shed light on the conservation of these genes/proteins and warrant further characterization","output":"Liu et al.

This evolutionary process of lignocellulose breakdown in fungi is regarded as ecological innovation. Furthermore, the multicollinearity analysis revealed that 10 genes of C. thermophilum and 7 genes of N. crassa were showing >75% orthologous to each other (Figure 9). The analysis of multicollinearity in the T. fergusii AA9 genes indicate that these orthologous genes may have common predecessors and have retained similar functions (Galagan et al., 2003; Hegnar et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). The GO-MF results of TfAA9 exposed that the highest enrichment score levels was 173.30 detected for cellulase activity (Figure 9, Table S8). Gene ontology analysis provided insight that TfAA9 genes are highly enriched in cellulase activity as other fungi LPMOs AA9 genes play important role in oxidatively cleavage of glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides (Petrović et al., 2019). According to the KEGG pathways study, it was found that all TfAA9 genes were classified into the pathway of endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages.
