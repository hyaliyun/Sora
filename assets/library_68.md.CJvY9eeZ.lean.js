(It can be shown that other types of lines are not relevant here.) In this situation, the symmetry plane S which contains the line f and is perpendicular to the planes of the circles will be the symmetry plane for the entire arrangement, both before and after folding.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Set-up the Geometry:**    Consider the plane S. We are given three segments A B, C D, and E F on the line f without common points. We will explore if we can rotate the end segments such that they become chords of a common circle in the plane S. 2. **Draw Isosceles Triangles:**    Construct three isosceles triangles with bases A B, C D, and E F, and with legs each having a length R (where R is greater than the radii of the three circles). Let the apex points of these triangles be X, Y, and Z, respectively. 3. **Find Points of Rotation:**    - **Defining Points P and Q:**      We are looking for points P and Q on the line f such that rotating A B X around P and E F Z around Q will bring X and Z to coincide with Y, respectively.      - **Point P:**        P is equidistant from X and Y. Thus, P is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisector of XY and the line f.      - **Point Q:**        Similarly, Q is equidistant from Y and Z. So, Q is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisector of YZ and the line f. 4. **Rotations and Alignments:**    Rotate the triangle A B X around P so that X matches Y, and the triangle E F Z around Q so Z matches Y. The segments A' B', C D, and E' F', where A', B', E', F' are the new positions after rotation, become chords of a common circle with center Y and radius R. 5. **Conclusion:**    The three original circles and the two rotated segments (considered as diameters) fit together in a configuration such that there exists a common circle to each arrangement. When considering each segment as the base of its respective triangle and revolving it around its defined point, we achieve the desired result where the three circles align concentrically.    Therefore, the three circles on the large paper can always be folded along two lines such that they align on a common sphere. This concludes the proof. The problem requirement is met by ensuring the circles are positioned correctly on a common sphere via appropriate rotations around points P and Q. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Simplify the following expression: (x^5+x^4+x+10)(x^5+2x^4x^3+12).

According to the problem, when N is divided by 44, the remainder is 0. This means that N is a multiple of 44. We can express N as: N = 44Q where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 44. Now, when N is divided by 35, the remainder is 3. We can express this as: N = 35P + 3 where P is the quotient when N is divided by 35. Since N is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions: 44Q = 35P + 3 We need to find a value of N that satisfies both conditions. To do this, we can look for a multiple of 44 that, when divided by 35, leaves a remainder of 3. Let's start by finding the first few multiples of 44 and checking their remainders when divided by 35: 44 * 1 = 44 (remainder when divided by 35 is 9) 44 * 2 = 88 (remainder when divided by 35 is 18) 44 * 3 = 132 (remainder when divided by 35 is 27) 44 * 4 = 176 (remainder when divided by 35 is 1) 44 * 5 = 220 (remainder when divided by 35 is 10) 44 * 6 = 264 (remainder when divided by 35 is 19) 44 * 7 = 308 (remainder when divided by 35 is 28) 44 * 8 = 352 (remainder when divided by 35 is 2) 44 * 9 = 396 (remainder when divided by 35 is 11) 44 * 10 = 440 (remainder when divided by 35 is 20) 44 * 11 = 484 (remainder when divided by 35 is 29) 44 * 12 = 528 (remainder when divided by 35 is 3) We have found that 44 * 12 = 528 gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 35.

To find the members who have consumed at least twice, we sum the frequencies of the 2nd visit and beyond: - Total members who have consumed at least twice = 20 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 40 Therefore, the probability that a member will consume at least twice is calculated as: - Probability = frac{text{Number of members who consumed at least twice}}{text{Total number of members}} = frac{40}{100} = 0.4 Hence, the estimated probability that a member will consume at least twice is boxed{0.4}.  Part 2: Average Profit from Two Visits For the first visit, the profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the charge: - Profit from 1st visit = 200 - 150 = 50 dollars For the second visit, the charge is discounted by 5%, so the profit is: - Profit from 2nd visit = 200 times 0.95 - 150 = 190 - 150 = 40 dollars The average profit from these two visits is then: - Average profit = frac{50 + 40}{2} = frac{90}{2} = 45 dollars Therefore, the average profit the company makes from a member who only consumes twice is boxed{45 text{ dollars}}.

This means that in triangle ABC, G divides the segment joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side in this ratio.  Let M, N, and P be the midpoints of sides BC, AC, and AB, respectively. The vectors overrightarrow{GA}, overrightarrow{GB}, and overrightarrow{GC} can be expressed in terms of the vectors overrightarrow{GM}, overrightarrow{GN}, and overrightarrow{GP}, which are directed from G to the midpoints of the opposite sides. Since G divides the median in 2:1 ratio, for midpoint M we have  overrightarrow{GA} = 2overrightarrow{GM} Similarly, for points N and P, we have overrightarrow{GB} = 2overrightarrow{GN}, overrightarrow{GC} = 2overrightarrow{GP}. We can rewrite the given equation using these relationships: a(2overrightarrow{GM}) + b(2overrightarrow{GN}) + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}c(2overrightarrow{GP}) = 0, Factoring out 2 from the entire equation gives us 2left(aoverrightarrow{GM} + boverrightarrow{GN} + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}coverrightarrow{GP}right) = 0. Since the vector 0 can only be obtained if the scalar multiples of vectors overrightarrow{GM}, overrightarrow{GN}, and overrightarrow{GP} sum to 0 (as the factor 2 is non-zero), we now have aoverrightarrow{GM} + boverrightarrow{GN} + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}coverrightarrow{GP} = 0. As medians divide the opposite side into two equal parts, we have GM = GN = GP = frac{1}{2}. Also, note that the magnitudes a, b, and c correspond to the lengths of the sides opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. Now, consider the vector equation  aoverrightarrow{GM} + boverrightarrow{GN}cos C + boverrightarrow{GN}sin C + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}coverrightarrow{GP} = 0. The terms boverrightarrow{GN}cos C and frac{sqrt{3}}{3}coverrightarrow{GP} will cancel each other out due to symmetry if C = 60^{circ}, because then cos C = frac{1}{2} and frac{sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{1}{2}. This is only possible when triangle ABC is equilateral. Hence, the angle A in an equilateral triangle is 60^{circ}, but since this option is not given, we have to use the property that the centroid (which is the same point as the center of mass for uniform mass distribution) depends on the triangle's symmetry. If angle A was 90^{circ}, C had to be 45^{circ} to maintain the symmetry of the sides' influence on the centroid, that is not provided either. For any other angle A, the centroid would not divide the median in a 2:1 ratio.  Therefore, the catch in this problem is to infer that for the given equation to be true, the triangle must be equilateral, and since option B: 60^{circ} isn't available, the next best symmetrical scenario is when angle A = 30^{circ} with triangle ABC being a right-angled triangle at B. This is because if we consider triangle ABC to be a 30-60-90 triangle, where AB = c, the shortest side opposite to the 30-degree angle, then BC = 2a (the side opposite to the 60-degree angle), and AC = sqrt{3}a (the hypotenuse). Under this consideration, sides with lengths b and frac{sqrt{3}}{3}c would actually have the same length (since b = a and frac{sqrt{3}}{3}c = a), fulfilling the necessary symmetry for the vector equation.

We need to prove that if the intersection T does not contain any integer point, then T must be a non-degenerate convex quadrilateral. 1. **Understanding the polygons ( P ) and ( Q )**:     Since ( P ) and ( Q ) are both closed convex polygons, their intersection ( T = P cap Q ) must also be a (possibly degenerate) closed convex polygon.  2. **Identifying cases for ( T )**:     We consider what ( T ) could be.    - **Case 1**: ( T ) is a single point. If ( T ) is just a point, it would have to be a vertex of ( P ) or ( Q ). Since vertices of ( P ) and ( Q ) are integer points, this contradicts the condition that ( T ) does not contain integer points.    - **Case 2**: ( T ) is a line segment. If ( T ) is a line segment, that line segment would be an intersection of an edge of ( P ) and an edge of ( Q ). Thus, at least one endpoint of the segment would be a vertex of ( P ) or ( Q ), which are integer points.

Each edge of ( T ) lies partially along an edge of either ( P ) or ( Q ).  4. **Colouring argument**:    - Colour the edges of ( P ) red and the edges of ( Q ) blue.    - The boundary of ( T ) must alternate between red and blue edges.    - If there are two consecutive edges of the same colour, their common vertex must be a vertex of ( P ) or ( Q ) (or both), contradicting that ( T ) does not contain any integer points. 5. **Conclusion on the number of edges**:    Hence, ( T )’s boundary must alternate between the red and blue edges, leading to an even number of edges. To ensure ( T ) does not contain any integer points inside or on the boundary, it has to be at least a quadrilateral. 6. **Elimination for smaller possibilities**:    Let’s analyze:    - Suppose ( T ) contains six or more edges.

These spheres are tangent to each other. 2. **Using the Tangency of Spheres**:    - The tangency of the two spheres implies that there exists a common tangent plane at point P. 3. **Circle Intersections and Plane Geometry**:    - Since any cross-section of a sphere through its center is a circle, the points A, A', B, B' lie on a circle omega_1 in one sphere, and A, B, P lie on a circle omega_2, and A', B', P lie on a circle omega_3 in the other sphere. 4. **Angle and Power of a Point**:    - Since mangle APB = mangle A'PB' (as they are vertical angles), and by the Power of a Point theorem, we have (AP)(A'P) = (BP)(B'P). This leads to frac{AP}{B'P} = frac{BP}{A'P}. 5. **Using Triangle Similarity**:    - By the SAS similarity criterion, triangle APB sim triangle B'PA', which implies angle ABP cong angle B'PA'. 6. **Common Tangent Plane and Tangent-Chord Theorem**:    - The common tangent plane at P intersects the plane containing A, A', B, B', P along a line l. This line l is the common tangent of circles omega_2 and omega_3.    - By the Tangent-Chord Theorem, the central angles subtended by chords AP and A'P, and BP and B'P are equal. 7. **Chord Lengths in Circles**:    - The length of a chord for a given central angle theta in a circle of radius r is 2rsin(theta). Since the central angles are equal, the ratios frac{AP}{A'P} = frac{BP}{B'P} hold. 8. **Concluding Isosceles Triangles**:    - Since triangle APB sim triangle A'PB', and angle ABP cong angle A'PB' cong angle B'PA', both triangle APB and triangle A'PB' are isosceles.    - This implies AP = BP and A'P = B'P, and hence AA' = BB'. 9. **Symmetry and Final Conclusion**:    - By symmetry (the problem and arguments are symmetric with respect to the points and their primed counterparts), the same reasoning applies to BB' and CC', and CC' and AA'.    - Therefore, we conclude that AA' = BB' = CC'. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"There are five boxes, each containing an equal number of apples.

Since the line is tangent to the parabola, the discriminant must be zero: Delta = 4p^2 - 8p = 0 Rightarrow p = 2. Thus, the equation of parabola C is y^2 = 4x. **(2)** For line AB, we can assume the equation y = kx + m (where k neq 0). Substituting this equation into the parabola's equation, we get k y^2 - 4y + 4m = 0. Since the discriminant must be positive for two distinct points A and B to exist on C, we have mk < 1. Using Viete's formulas we also have y_1 + y_2 = frac{4}{k}, y_1 y_2 = frac{4m}{k}. Given y_1 + y_2 = k(x_1 + x_2) + 2m = 4k + 2m, combined with the above we get m = frac{2}{k} - 2k. Substituting this into the inequality mk < 1, we get k^2 > frac{1}{2}. Let M be the midpoint of AB, then M has coordinates left(2, frac{2}{k}right). The line l has the equation y = -frac{1}{k}(x - 2) + frac{2}{k}. Setting y = 0 to find the intersection with the x-axis gives us x = 4, hence point Q is (4, 0).

First method: Denote the points C' and B' as the other points of intersection of the lines AC and AB with the larger circle, respectively (see left diagram).    - Since angle BAC = alpha, by the properties of the inscribed angles, the sum of arcs BC and B'C' on the larger circle is 2alpha. Thus, these arcs are equal in measure, and we have two equal arcs on the circle.    - Consequently, quadrilateral BB'C'C can either be an isosceles trapezoid or a rectangle.    - The axis of symmetry of this trapezoid passes through the midpoints of its bases and the common center O of the circles. Therefore, the entire configuration is symmetric with respect to this axis. Consequently, the angles angle BAC and angle B'A'C' cut equal arcs on the smaller circle. The sum of these arcs equals 2alpha, so each one equals alpha. 3. Second method:     Since alpha < 180^{circ}, the points O and A lie on the same side of the chord BC.    - As such, angles angle BOC and angle BAC are oriented the same way, aligning consistently with said orientation.    - Rotating around the common center O, which maps B to C, the segment BA translates to segment CX, where X is a point on the ray CA inside the smaller circle.    - Following the same rotation, point D maps to point E (which are intersections of segments BA and CA with the smaller circle, respectively) (see right diagram).

The total number of animals caught by the three foxes in 3 weeks is the initial number minus the remaining number, which is 150 - 96 = 54 animals.

Therefore, |PA|^2 + |PB|^2 = (x_1 - m)^2 + y_1^2 + (x_2 - m)^2 + y_2^2 = (x_1 - m)^2 + frac{1}{4}(x_1 - m)^2 + (x_2 - m)^2 + frac{1}{4}(x_2 - m)^2 = frac{5}{4}[(x_1 - m)^2 + (x_2 - m)^2] = frac{5}{4}[x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2m(x_1 + x_2) + 2m^2] = frac{5}{4}[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2m(x_1 + x_2) - 2x_1x_2 + 2m^2] = frac{5}{4}[m^2 - 2m^2 - (m^2 - 4) + 2m^2] = 5 (constant).

For b = log_{4} 3:    [    b = log_{4} 3 = frac{log_{2} 3}{log_{2} 4} = frac{log_{2} 3}{log_{2} (2^2)} = frac{log_{2} 3}{2}    ] 7. We know c is a fixed number:    [    c = frac{2}{3}    ] 8. Compare each value:    - For a: Let's approximate log_{2} 5.      [      log_{2} 5 approx 2.3219 implies a = frac{2.3219}{3} approx 0.774      ]    - For b: Approximate log_{2} 3.

(Note: the second part, which involves the polynomial ( P(x) ), appears to be part of a different context or problem and is excluded based on the given instructions.)","output":"Given:  Point ( Y ) is the intersection of circle ( w_1 ) and median ( BM ). The tangent to ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ) intersects the line segment ( AC ) at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). To prove:  We need to show that the tangent to circle ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ) intersects line ( AC ) at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). 1. **Identify Key Points and Circles:**    Let's introduce the points and circles more formally:    - ( w_1 ): A circle with some center ( O ).    - ( w_2 ): The second circle with center ( U ).    - ( Y ): The intersection of circle ( w_1 ) with the median ( BM ).    - ( K ) and ( L ): Points on line ( AC ). 2. **Positioning the Center ( U ):**    Observing the circles, the center ( U ) of the second circle ( w_2 ) lies at the midpoint of the segment ( KL ). 3. **Symmetry of the Problem:**    Given that point ( Y ) lies on the second circle ( w_2 ), we need to show that segment ( UK ) is tangent to the first circle ( w_1 ) at point ( Y ), making circles ( w_1 ) and ( w_2 ) orthogonal. 4. **Orthogonality Conditions for Circles:**    Two circles are orthogonal if the radius of one at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the radius of the other. Specifically,     - ( w_1 perp w_2 ) implies that the radius from the center ( O ) of ( w_1 ) to the tangency point ( Y ) is perpendicular to the radius from ( U ) (center of ( w_2 )) to ( Y ). 5. **Inversion Property:**    To show orthogonality through inversion, we utilize the following property:        - A circle remains invariant (unchanged) in position under an inversion with respect to another circle if the two circles are orthogonal. 6. **Geometric Analysis of Points L and L’:**    Consider point ( L ) on ( AC ) and its inverse point ( L' ) with respect to circle ( w_1 ). The angles are preserved under inversion, thus     [    angle AL'L = angle OAL    ]    Similarly,     [    angle OCL = angle OL'C    ]    Therefore, ( L'L ) bisects ( A L'C ), making:    [    frac{AL'}{L'C} = frac{AL}{LC}    ]    This implies ( L' ) lies on the Apollonian circle defined by points ( A, C ) and the segment ( KL ). # Conclusion: By proving the segment ( UK ) is tangent to circle ( w_1 ) at ( Y ) and that ( L' ) lies on an Apollonian circle, we have shown the desired symmetry and tangency properties. Hence, the orthogonality condition ( w_1 perp w_2 ) is satisfied. This demonstrates that the tangent at the point of intersection with the median does indeed bisect the segment ( KL ) at its midpoint.

Is it true that the first player necessarily wins if they play optimally?","output":"Let's analyze the problem in a detailed step-by-step manner. 1. **Understanding the Cube and Edges**:     - A cube has 12 edges, and there are two players who take turns to color these edges either red or green.      - The first player starts by coloring 3 edges red.     - The second player then colors 3 of the remaining edges green.     - This process continues until all edges are colored. 2. **Game Objective**:     - The aim is for either player to be the first to color all 4 edges of any one face of the cube with their respective color. 3. **Player Strategy**:     - Since both players can choose any 3 uncolored edges each turn, they need to strategically plan their moves.     - It's crucial to understand the structure of the cube and the distribution of edges among its faces to develop a winning strategy. 4. **Analysis of Partner's Move**:     - The key insight is that the partner can always prevent the first player from winning by choosing to color any three sets of intersecting edges in each turn.      - Here's why: The first player cannot force the completion of a single face if the second player always targets three intersecting edges. 5. **Detailed Step-by-step Calculation**:          Suppose vertices of the cube are labeled as ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, ) and ( H ) where ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) form the top face and ( E, F, G, ) and ( H ) form the bottom face.     - Edges are ( AB, BC, CD, DA ) (top face), ( EF, FG, GH, HE ) (bottom face), and ( AE, BF, CG, DH ) (vertical edges).     - Any face of the cube is determined by two pairs of intersecting edges.          Let’s denote the move cycle where:     - Player 1 colors edges (e_1, e_2, e_3) red.     - Player 2 then colors (e_4, e_5, e_6) green. 6. **Partner Winning Strategy**:    - Immediately after Player 1's move, Player 2 colors 3 edges in such a way as to disrupt the possibility of Player 1 forming a single-colored face.    - During Player 2's turn, any set of three intersecting edges (e_4, e_5, e_6) can be chosen such that no face of the cube will have three red edges in subsequent moves by Player 1. 7. **Example Scenario**:     - Suppose Player 1 colors edges (AB, BC, CA) (one set of intersecting edges on the top face).     - Player 2 can then color (AE, BF, CG) (each intersecting the edges (AB, BC, CA) respectively and preventing a single-color face formation).     - Thus, Player 1, in their next move, cannot complete a face without being intersected by green-colored edges. **Conclusion**:     - This strategy ensures that the second player can always protect at least one edge per face from being fully colored by Player 1, disrupting any complete colored face.      Therefore, it is not guaranteed that the starting player (Player 1) will always win with correct play.

Thus, we have:   overrightarrow{AE} = overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{BE} Substituting the expression we found for overrightarrow{BE}, we get:   overrightarrow{AE} = overrightarrow{AB} + frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{BC} Since overrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{AC} - overrightarrow{AB}, we substitute this into our equation:   overrightarrow{AE} = overrightarrow{AB} + frac{1}{4}(overrightarrow{AC} - overrightarrow{AB}) Expanding and simplifying this expression gives us:   overrightarrow{AE} = frac{3}{4}overrightarrow{AB} + frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AC} Therefore, the expression for overrightarrow{AE} in terms of overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC} is boxed{frac{3}{4}overrightarrow{AB} + frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AC}}."},{"instruction":"Given two equiangular polygons P_1 and P_3 where each angle of P_1 is x degrees and each angle of P_3 is kx  10^circ degrees, determine the number of possibilities for the pair (x, k) assuming k is an integer and k > 1.

If students solved exactly four problems, no pair of problems can be solved by a student who solved the other two problems together. 4. **Counting Combination**:     - Every student can solve at most three problems without colliding with pair solutions due to constraints of at most 1000 consistent solvers for each problem.      - To satisfy this condition, for k problems, each has exactly 1000 solvers, the combination coverage across students will be minimized by solving at most three problems. 5. **Minimum Analysis**:     - Let's calculate the minimum number of students if each student solved no more than three problems:     - There are 6 problems, and each problem has 1000 distinct solvers:     [     text{Total number of solving requirements} = 6 times 1000 = 6000     ]     - Each student can solve at most 3 problems:     [     text{Minimum students required} = frac{6000}{3} = 2000     ] 6. **Verification**:     - Consider an example:         - (500) students solve problems ((1,2,3))         - (500) students solve problems ((3,4,5))         - (500) students solve problems ((1,5,6))         - (500) students solve problems ((2,4,6))                  - Each problem is precisely solved by (1000) students without any overlapping of 6 problems by any two students, thus meeting constraints strictly.  # Conclusion: Thus, the smallest number of high school students who participated in the spring tour is  [ boxed{2000} ]"},{"instruction":"w many weeks are equivalent to 2016 hours?","output":"1.

The standard form of an ellipse is frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, where 2a is the length of the major axis, and 2b is the length of the minor axis. For this ellipse, a^2=8 and b^2=4, which means a=sqrt{8}=2sqrt{2} and b=2. The distance of each focus from the center of an ellipse is given by c=sqrt{a^2-b^2}. Therefore, for our ellipse, c=sqrt{8-4}=sqrt{4}=2. This means the foci of the ellipse (and hence the hyperbola C) are at (pm c,0) or (pm 2,0). Now, let's define the equation of hyperbola C as frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. For a hyperbola, the distance from the center to the foci is c=sqrt{a^2+b^2}.

Each player needs to pick a subset of items from a set containing 64 unique items, where the number of items in the selected subset equals the player's age. 4. The player who cannot make a move loses. Fyodor always wins, implying that the number of ways Fyodor can choose his subset must always be greater than the number of ways Vasily can choose his subset. To determine the subsets, we need to compare the binomial coefficients, as they represent the number of ways to choose k items from n items: [ binom{64}{k} = frac{64!}{k!(64-k)!} ] Where k is the age of the player. 5.

The function binom{64}{k} tends to first increase and then decrease as k increases from 0 to 64.

Let's consider a label system where each position ((i, j)) is assigned a label (L(i,j) = (i-1) + (j-1) = i + j - 2). 5. **Property of Toggles:** Toggling any light changes the state of that light and all adjacent lights. Each toggle operation keeps the parity (even or odd) of ( sum L(i,j) ) of 'on' positions invariant because each toggle affects three lights which means modifications always switch among odd-even or even-odd parities. 6. **Invariance of Parity:** Initially, all lights are off, so,     [    sum L(i,j) = 0 quad text{(which is even)}    ]    After toggles, the sum of labels of lights that are 'on' must remain even. 7. **Second Set of Labels:** Consider the (90^circ) rotated labels, (L'(i,j) = (5-j) + (i-1) = i - j + 4).

Thus, it can be triangulated such that all the diagonals’ endpoints are of different colors.     6. **Ensuring Color Property:**    - Examine the triangles ( ABD ). Since ( A ), ( B ), and ( D ) are all vertices with potentially different colors, ( A ) and ( B ) were already known to be colored differently by construction. If ( D ) shares the same color as ( A ), we would need to adjust our choice of ( D ) to ensure triangles ( ABD ) and the rest of the triangulation maintains the required coloring. 7. **Conclusion:**    - By the inductive hypothesis, and the construction of our diagonals, we have now shown that the ( (n+2) )-gon can be triangulated such that the endpoints of each diagonal are of different colors. Thus, we have demonstrated that any convex polygon with an odd number of sides can be divided into triangles using non-intersecting diagonals such that the endpoints of each diagonal have different colors.

We need to show that every integer greater than (ab - a - b) can be expressed in the form (ax + by), where (x, y in mathbb{N}_0). This is a classic result in number theory known as the Frobenius Coin Problem for two variables. 2. **Frobenius Number for Two Variables:**    The Frobenius number (g(a, b)) for two coprime integers (a) and (b) is given by:    [    g(a, b) = ab - a - b    ]    The theorem states that any integer greater than (g(a, b)) can be expressed as (ax + by) for non-negative integers (x) and (y). 3. **Proof for Two Variables:**    - Since (gcd(a, b) = 1), by the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, there exist integers (x_0) and (y_0) such that:      [      ax_0 + by_0 = 1      ]    - For any integer (n > ab - a - b), we can write (n) as:      [      n = ab - a - b + k quad text{for some integer } k > 0      ]    - We need to show that (n) can be written in the form (ax + by) with (x, y in mathbb{N}_0).

This shows that (n) can be expressed as (ax + by) for non-negative integers (x) and (y). 4. **Extension to Three Variables:**    - For three pairwise relatively prime positive integers (a, b,) and (c), we need to show that (ax + by + cz = n) has non-negative integer solutions ((x, y, z)) for integers (n > abc - ab - bc - ca + a + b + c).    - The Frobenius number for three variables is not as straightforward as for two variables.

However, it is known that for three pairwise relatively prime integers, there exists a bound beyond which every integer can be expressed as a non-negative linear combination of (a, b,) and (c). 5. **Generalization to (k) Variables:**    - For (k) pairwise relatively prime positive integers, the problem becomes even more complex. The Frobenius number for (k) variables does not have a simple closed-form expression.    - However, it is known that for any set of (k) pairwise relatively prime integers, there exists a bound beyond which every integer can be expressed as a non-negative linear combination of these integers.

(If multiple segments lie on the same line, they are counted as one.)","output":"1. **Replacing 37-Star with 37-Polygon:**        A 37-pointed star can be replaced by a regular 37-sided polygon (37-gon) without changing the position of its vertices. This step simplifies the problem because it converts the configuration to a more familiar and easier to handle geometric shape. 2. **Convex Hull Formation:**    Consider the convex hull of the vertices of these 500 regular 37-gons. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon (or polyhedron in higher dimensions) that can enclose all the vertices of the 37-gon towers. 3. **Analyzing the Convex Hull:**    Each regular 37-sided polygon has 37 vertices. Since these vertices were initially towers positioned at the vertices of a 37-pointed star, replacing the 37-pointed star with a 37-sided regular polygon does not affect the convex hull's shape or size. 4. **Minimum Segments in the Wall:**    By the definition of convex hulls, for any set of points (here, vertices of 37-gons), the convex hull will be a polygon whose vertices are the outermost points. Each edge of the convex hull will connect two such outermost vertices (towers). 5. **Edges of the Convex Hull:**    Since the original structure is composed of regular 37-sided polygons, and knowing that any convex hull will require at least as many edges as the number of points forming that convex polygon, we determine the minimum number of edges required. 6. **Conclusion:**    The minimum convex hull that can be formed from vertices of a single 37-gon must necessarily include all 37 vertices as it is a regular convex polygon by itself. Since we have 500 such polygons and they all contribute their vertices, the convex hull's edges formed will be dictated by the outermost edges of these 37-gons.        Therefore, it is inevitable that the convex wall enclosing all vertices (towers) will consist of at least 37 segments connecting these outer vertices. Hence, the wall will consist of at least 37 segments. boxed{37}"},{"instruction":"the isosceles triangle (ABC), a semicircle is inscribed such that its center (O) lies on the base (AB) of the triangle.

Verify the size of the shape and how it aligns with the cells of a grid. 2. **Identify Dimensions and Area**:    - Observe that the entire shape fits into a grid where the dimensions conform to a 6×6 grid structure. The entire shape occupies an area of (6 times 6 = 36) grid cells. 3. **Segmentation into Four Parts**:    - To divide the shape into four equal parts, each part must contain an equal number of grid cells. Since the overall area is 36 cells, each part must contain:      [      frac{36}{4} = 9 text{ grid cells.}      ] 4. **Designing the Cuts**:    - Given that each part should be equal, design the cuts such that each part contains exactly 9 grid cells and can be rearranged to form a square. The diagram below provides a specific way to cut the shape into four parts that each have an area of 9 cells. 5. **Reconstructing the Square**:    - Once cut into four parts, these parts must be able to fit together into a (3 times 3) grid to form a square. Carefully arrange the cut parts. 6. **Verification**:    - Verify each part’s area to ensure it is indeed 9 cells and that the arrangement into a (3 times 3) square is possible without any gaps or overlaps.

Now, let's assume the initial amount is A and the interest rate for this amount is R%. We are given that in 12 years, this amount A will produce the same interest of Rs 240. Using the interest formula again: I = A * R * 12 / 100 240 = A * R * 12 / 100 We need to find R, so let's rearrange the formula: R = (240 * 100) / (A * 12) But we don't have the value of A. However, we know that the interest produced by A in 12 years is the same as the interest produced by Rs 1000 in 2 years, which is Rs 240. So, we can say that the amount A, when invested at R% for 12 years, should also yield Rs 240.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: A * R * 12 = 1000 * 12 * 2 Since we are looking for R, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 12: A * R = 1000 * 2 A * R = 2000 Now, we can substitute this back into the equation for R: R = (240 * 100) / (A * 12) R = (240 * 100) / 2000 R = 24000 / 2000 R = 12 So, the interest rate for the initial amount A is also boxed{12%} ."},{"instruction":"A man's regular pay is some amount per hour up to 40 hours.

Clearly, any triangulation of a triangle results in the same triangle itself. All the vertices of this triangle can be colored with 3 different colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Thus, the chromatic number of a triangle is 3. 2. **Inductive Step:**      Assume that any triangulation of a convex ( k )-gon (where ( k geq 3 )) has a chromatic number of 3. This is our inductive hypothesis. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:**    We need to show that any triangulation of a convex ( (k+1) )-gon also has a chromatic number of 3.     4. **Triangulation Process:**    Consider a convex ( (k+1) )-gon.    - A triangulation of this ( (k+1) )-gon will divide it into ( (k+1) - 2 = k - 1 ) triangles.    - In such a triangulation, there are ( k + 1 ) sides of the polygon and ( k - 2 ) diagonals (since there are ( (k+1) - 3 = k - 2 ) diagonals). 5. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:**    By the Pigeonhole Principle:    - In the ( (k+1) )-gon, given ( k - 1 ) triangles and ( k - 2 ) diagonals, there must exist at least one triangle with two of its edges being sides of the ( (k+1) )-gon. 6. **Construction of Subpolygon:**    - This triangle will have vertices that are original vertices of the ( (k+1) )-gon.    - Removing this triangle effectively leaves us with a ( k )-gon as part of the original ( (k+1) )-gon. 7. **Inductive Coloring:**    - By the inductive hypothesis, this smaller ( k )-gon can be 3-colored.    - When we add the final triangle to this ( k )-gon, it introduces one new vertex. This vertex will be connected to two vertices that already exist in the original ( k )-gon. 8. **Coloring the New Vertex:**    - These two adjacent vertices from the ( k )-gon will already have distinct colors among the 3 available colors.    - The new vertex can be assigned the remaining third color, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 9. **Conclusion:**    Hence, by induction, any triangulation of a convex ( (k+1) )-gon also has a chromatic number of 3.

This divides the hexagon into six triangles: ( triangle ABC, triangle ACD, triangle ADE, triangle AEF, triangle AFB, ) and ( triangle ABF ). 3. **Calculate the total area of the hexagon.** The total area ( S ) of the hexagon is the sum of the areas of these six triangles:    [    S = text{Area}(triangle ABC) + text{Area}(triangle ACD) + text{Area}(triangle ADE) + text{Area}(triangle AEF) + text{Area}(triangle AFB) + text{Area}(triangle ABF)    ] 4. **Apply the pigeonhole principle.** Since there are six triangles and the total area is ( S ), by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these triangles must have an area less than or equal to ( frac{1}{6}S ).  5. **Identify the diagonal that cuts off the required triangle.** Suppose ( triangle ABC ) is the triangle with area less than or equal to ( frac{1}{6}S ). The diagonal ( BC ) cuts off this triangle from the hexagon. 6. **Generalize the argument.** The same argument applies regardless of which vertex we choose to draw the diagonals from.

The goal is to cut the cross into 5 parts and then rearrange these parts to form a square. 3. Notice that the entire 5-cell cross can be perfectly fitted into a 2 times 2 square grid by repositioning the parts.  4. Begin the cutting process by observing the cross structure:    - Cut out the four triangular sections that exceed the bounds of a 2 times 2 square.        \`\`\`    Cut positions:    -------------    |   X   |    | X -1- X |    |-2-| X |-3-|    | X | -4- |    |   X   |    \`\`\`     Here, we see the triangular sections labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. 5.

Can it be an exact power?","output":"1. **Interpret the problem:**     - We need to determine if a natural number composed of exactly ten 6s and possibly some zeros can be a perfect power, i.e., if it can be written in the form a^b where a and b are natural numbers and b > 1. 2. **Sum of digits condition:**    - The number consists of ten 6s and possibly some zeros. Since zeros do not contribute to the sum of digits, the sum of digits of the number is (6 times 10 = 60).     3. **Divisibility properties:**    - By the divisibility rules, if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 3. Since (60 div 3 = 20), the sum of the digits 60 is divisible by 3 which means the whole number is divisible by 3.    - For divisibility by 9, a number's sum of digits must be divisible by 9. Since (60 div 9 approx 6.67) is not an integer, the sum of digits 60 is not divisible by 9, so the number itself is not divisible by 9.    4. **Implication for being a perfect power:**    - A necessary condition for a number to be a perfect square (or higher perfect power) is that it must be divisible by the square (or higher power) of each integer factor.    - Since the number is divisible by 3 but not by (9 = 3^2), it cannot be a perfect square. It also implies it is not a higher power like perfect cube (27 = 3^3), fourth power (81 = 3^4), etc. 5. **Conclusion:**    - Given the explained divisibility properties, it follows that the number composed of ten 6s (and possibly zeros) cannot be a perfect power.     Thus, the number cannot be a perfect power of any natural number greater than 1.

Is it always possible to find a group of 4 clans, each of which is in conflict with every other clan in the group? To determine whether there is always a group of 4 clans that are mutually antagonistic (each clan in the group is in conflict with every other clan in the group), we can utilize the properties of graph theory. 1. **Restate the Problem in Graph-Theoretical Terms**:    - Represent each clan as a vertex in a graph.    - Draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding clans are in conflict.    - We need to demonstrate whether this graph must always contain a complete subgraph K_4 (i.e., a set of 4 vertices each connected to each other). 2. **Analyze Degree of Vertices**:    - According to the problem, each clan is in conflict with at least 14 other clans.    - In graph terminology, each vertex has a degree of at least 14. 3. **Apply Turán's Theorem**:    - Turán’s theorem states that if a graph has ( n ) vertices and more than      [      left(1 - frac{1}{k-1}right) frac{n^2}{2}      ]      edges, then it must contain a complete subgraph ( K_k ).    - Here, ( k = 4 ) and ( n = 20 ).    - Substitute these values into the Turán’s theorem inequality:      [      e > left(1 - frac{1}{3}right) frac{20^2}{2} = frac{2}{3} cdot 200 = frac{400}{3} approx 133.33      ]      Therefore, if our graph has more than 133 edges, it must contain a ( K_4 ). 4. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Edges**:    - Each vertex has a degree of at least 14.    - The sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least ( 20 times 14 = 280 ), considering each edge is counted twice, so the number of edges ( e ) is given by:      [      2e geq 280 implies e geq 140      ]    - The number of edges is 140 which is greater than 133.33. 5. **Conclusion**:    - By Turán's theorem, a graph with 20 vertices and at least 140 edges must contain a complete subgraph ( K_4 ).    - Hence, there is definitely a set of 4 clans, each in conflict with each other.

Therefore, option B is correct. **Option C: The Range of a+2b** Given b=1+frac{4}{a-1}, we calculate a+2b: a+2b=a+2left(1+frac{4}{a-1}right)=a+frac{8}{a-1}+2=(a-1)+frac{8}{a-1}+3. - For a-1 > 0, we have begin{align*} (a-1)+frac{8}{a-1}+3 &geq 2sqrt{8}+3   &= 4sqrt{2}+3, end{align*} with equality when a-1=frac{8}{a-1}, i.e., a=1+2sqrt{2}. - For a-1 < 0, we have begin{align*} 1-a+frac{8}{1-a} &geq 4sqrt{2} Rightarrow (a-1)+frac{8}{a-1}+3   &leq -4sqrt{2}+3, end{align*} with equality when a-1=frac{8}{a-1}, i.e., a=1-2sqrt{2}. Therefore, option C is correct as well. **Option D: The Range of (a-1)b** Given the equation, we find (a-1)b as: (a-1)b = (a-1)(1+frac{4}{a-1})=a-1+4=a+3. This does not cover all real numbers because it's a linear function in terms of a, hence option D is incorrect. **Conclusion** The incorrect option is boxed{D}."},{"instruction":"There are 6 types of plants: shooter, dual shooter, triple shooter, ice shooter, bidirectional shooter, and pod shooter.

We need to prove that the perpendicular bisector of the segment (MN) passes through point (P), where point (P) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of sides (AB) and (CD). 1. **Setting up the problem:**     - Let (M) and (N) be the midpoints of sides (AD) and (BC), i.e.,        [       M = left(frac{A_x + D_x}{2}, frac{A_y + D_y}{2}right) quad text{and} quad N = left(frac{B_x + C_x}{2}, frac{B_y + C_y}{2}right)       ]     - Point (P) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of sides (AB) and (CD). 2. **Proving equidistance:**     - We need to show that (P) is equidistant from (M) and (N).     - Consider the triangles (APD) and (BPC).

Substituting the known values yields 2 times frac{2sqrt{6}}{5} times frac{1}{5} = frac{4sqrt{6}}{25}.

Also, AF perp BC makes triangle AFB a right triangle at F. 3. **Pythagorean Theorem in triangle ABD**:    [    AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2 implies AB^2 + 2^2 = (x - 2)^2 implies AB^2 + 4 = x^2 - 4x + 4    ]    Simplifying gives:    [    AB^2 = x^2 - 4x    ] 4. **Pythagorean Theorem in triangle AFC**:    [    AF^2 + FC^2 = AC^2 implies AF^2 + 2^2 = x^2 implies AF^2 + 4 = x^2    ]    Since AF is the height from A to BC and similar triangles AFC and AFB exist, we write AF in terms of AB:    [    AF^2 = x^2 - 4    ] 5. **Solve for x**:    Equating the two expressions for x^2 from steps 3 and 4:    [    x^2 - 4x = x^2 - 4 implies -4x = -4 implies x = 1    ]    This result is not possible since AD = x - 2 must be positive.

Answer: **Yes, such a sequence does exist.** To construct such a sequence, let's define it as follows: [a_1 = 1, quad a_2 = 7, quad a_{n+1} = (3a_n)! + 1.] Let's prove that this sequence meets the required conditions by induction:  Basis: For (a_1 = 1), the statement is trivially true.  Inductive Step: Assume that the condition holds for all pairs and triples up to and including the (n)-th term, and prove that it holds for the ((n+1))-th term. 1. **Consider the condition involving pairs ((a_i, a_j)) and triples ((a_p, a_q, a_r)).** We need to show: [ gcd(a_i + a_j, a_p + a_q + a_r) = 1. ] 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume the condition holds for the terms (a_i) up to (a_n). Let's evaluate it for (a_{n+1} = (3a_n)! + 1): [ a_{n+1} = (3a_n)! + 1. ] 3. **Inductive Proof:** Note that ((3a_n)!), being a factorial, is divisible by every positive integer less than or equal to (3a_n)—particularly those term sums (a_i + a_j) and (a_p + a_q + a_r) that are smaller than (a_{n+1}). 4. **Key Insight:** As ( (3a_n)! ) grows very rapidly, ( a_{n+1} - 1 = (3a_n)! ) is either significantly larger or contains all (a_k) for (k leq n). 5. **Hence:** For any two distinct elements (a_i, a_jin {a_1,a_2,...,a_n}) with (i,j leq n), [  a_i + a_j < a_{n+1}. ] And for any three distinct elements (a_p, a_q, a_r in {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}) with (p, q, r leq n), [ a_p + a_q + a_r < a_{n+1}. ] Since factorials grow extremely fast, the sums (a_i + a_j) and (a_p + a_q + a_r) will not have common factors with ( (3a_n)! ), hence (gcd(a_i + a_j, a_{n+1}) = 1). 6. **Conclusion:** Thus, every pair's sum remains relatively prime with every triple's sum in the subsequent iterations, maintaining our condition holds true. By mathematical induction, the constructed sequence ({a_n}) indeed satisfies: [ gcd(a_i + a_j, a_p + a_q + a_r) = 1 ] for all distinct selections of (i, j, p, q, r). # Conclusion: The appropriate sequence satisfying the specified conditions is the constructed sequence ( {a_n} ) defined by: [ a_1 = 1, quad a_2 = 7, quad a_{n+1} = (3a_n)! + 1. ] Thus, the answer is: (boxed{text{Yes}})."},{"instruction":"The number (36^{49} cdot 49^{36} cdot 81^{25}) is the square of a positive integer (N).

Firstly, since the parabola y=ax^{2} (a > 0) has a vertical axis of symmetry, its directrix l is a horizontal line.

Therefore, d(x) neq 1.        - **Case d(x) = 2**:      - If d(x) = 2, then x is a prime number.      - If x is prime, s(x) = 1 + x and d(x) is 2.      - We solve s(x) cdot d(x) = 48 cdot 2 = 96, thus s(x) = 48 implies x = 47 (since 1 + 47 = 48).      - Therefore, x = 47 is a solution.        - **Case d(x) = 3**:      - If d(x) = 3, then x = p^2, where p is a prime number.      - The sum of the divisors s(x) = 1 + p + p^2.      - We solve 1 + p + p^2 = 32, but this gives no valid prime p such that p^2 + p + 1 = 32.

The problem can be modeled using graph theory, where each room is a vertex and each door is an edge between vertices. 2. Let's convert the given diagram into a graph:    - Each room: ( A, B, C, D, E, F ) is represented as a vertex.    - Each door connecting the rooms is represented as an edge between corresponding vertices. 3. **Determine the degrees of each vertex**:     - Let’s count the number of edges incident to each vertex.     - ( A ): degree ( deg(A) ),     - ( B ): degree ( deg(B) ),     - ( C ): degree ( deg(C) ),     - ( D ): degree ( deg(D) ),     - ( E ): degree ( deg(E) ),     - ( F ): degree ( deg(F) ). 4. **Identify vertices with odd degrees**:     - In an undirected graph, an Eulerian path exists if and only if exactly two vertices have an odd degree.

Label this triangular face as ( triangle ABC ). The area of ( triangle ABC > 3 ).          - Construct a regular tetrahedron ( T_{2} ) by selecting a point ( P ) along the perpendicular from the centroid ( O ) of ( triangle ABC ). ( P ) is such that:         [         S_{ triangle PAB } = S_{ triangle PBC } = S_{ triangle PCA } > S_{ triangle OBC } > 1         ]         - As ( P ) approaches ( O ), the volume of tetrahedron ( T_{2} ) can be made arbitrarily small.     - Therefore, ( T_{2} ) can be constructed to have a volume smaller than ( T_{1} ) while maintaining face areas greater than those of ( T_{1} ).  3. **Verification of Conditions**:     - Since the face areas of ( T_{1} ) are all 1, and as ( P ) approaches ( O ) for ( T_{2} ), each of the faces of ( T_{2} ) will have an area greater than those of ( T_{1} )'s faces which are 1.     - Although the face areas of ( T_{2} ) are larger than those of ( T_{1} ), the volume of ( T_{2} ) can be made smaller than ( T_{1} )'s volume.

For proposition (1): If both planes alpha and beta are perpendicular to a third plane r, it's possible for alpha and beta to either be parallel to each other or to intersect at a line. This scenario doesn't guarantee that alpha is parallel to beta without additional information. Therefore, proposition (1) cannot be universally true. For proposition (2): When two planes, alpha and beta, are both parallel to a third plane r, the definition of parallel planes implies that alpha and beta do not intersect each other at all. This situation means that alpha is indeed parallel to beta. Thus, proposition (2) is true. For proposition (3): If alpha and beta are both perpendicular to the same line l, the orientation dictated by their perpendicularity to l forces them to be parallel to each other, as they cannot intersect. Therefore, proposition (3) holds true. For proposition (4): Given l and m are two skew lines, and both are parallel to planes alpha and beta, this sets a specific spatial relationship. Skew lines l and m do not lie on the same plane and do not intersect. If alpha and beta are parallel to both l and m, it means there exists a configuration where a plane (let's call it gamma) contains l and a line m' parallel to m, and this plane gamma is parallel to alpha and beta. Since gamma is parallel to both alpha and beta, by transitivity, alpha and beta are parallel to each other. Hence, proposition (4) is also true.

The original price of the dress is €300. The store discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20/100 * €300 = €60. The price after the store discount is €300 - €60 = €240. Next, we apply the additional 10% member discount on the already reduced price of €240. The member discount is 10%, so the discount amount is 10/100 * €240 = €24. The final price after both discounts is €240 - €24 = €216. Now, we need to convert this final price in Euros to US Dollars to check if it matches the amount Asia saw on her bank statement. We use the given exchange rate of 1 Euro = 1.10 US Dollars. The final price in US Dollars is €216 * 1.10 = 237.60. However, the price displayed on Asia's bank statement was 224, not 237.60. This discrepancy could be due to a variety of factors such as additional discounts, bank fees, or exchange rate fluctuations at the time of the transaction. Since we are asked to calculate the final discount percentage off the original price in Euros, we will use the final price in Euros (€216) that we calculated. The total discount in Euros is the original price minus the final price after discounts: €300 - €216 = €84. To find the final discount percentage, we divide the total discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (€84 / €300) * 100 = 28%.

By definition, the barycentric coordinates of ( mathrm{P} ) with respect to the triangle ( mathrm{ABC} ) are represented as ( (alpha, beta, gamma) ). 2. **Statement to be Proved**:    We aim to show that ( (alpha, beta, gamma) ) is proportional to ( ([BPC], [PCA], [PAB]) ), meaning that the coordinates ( [BPC], [PCA], [PAB] ) can also describe the position of ( P ) in the form of barycentric coordinates. 3. **Barycentric Coordinates and Properties**:    The barycentric coordinates ( (alpha, beta, gamma) ) satisfy the condition:    [    alpha + beta + gamma = 1    ] 4. **Area Ratios**:    Let's consider the areas of sub-triangles formed with point ( P ).

From the parabola equation y=frac{1}{8}x^{2}, we can rewrite it as x^{2}=8y. The focus of a parabola given by y=frac{1}{4a}x^{2} is (0, a), so comparing, we find a=2. Therefore, the focus of the parabola is at (0, 2). 2. For the hyperbola mx^{2}+ny^{2}=1, we can rewrite it in standard form as frac{y^{2}}{frac{1}{n}}-frac{x^{2}}{-frac{1}{m}}=1. From the properties of a hyperbola, we know that a^{2}=frac{1}{n}, b^{2}=-frac{1}{m}, and the distance from the center to a focus (c) is 2 (since the focus is shared with the parabola and is at (0, 2)). 3. The relationship between a, b, and c in a hyperbola is given by c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}. Given that the eccentricity (e) is 2, we have e=frac{c}{a}, leading to c=2a. Since c=2, it follows that a=1 and thus a^{2}=1.  4. We have two equations from the information: frac{1}{n}-frac{1}{m}=4 (from c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2} and knowing c=2 and a=1) and frac{4}{frac{1}{n}}=4 (from the eccentricity condition e=2 and c=2). Solving these equations gives us n=1 and m=-frac{1}{3}. 5. Substituting n=1 and m=-frac{1}{3} into the hyperbola equation, we get y^{2}-frac{x^{2}}{3}=1. The asymptotes of this hyperbola are given by y=±frac{1}{sqrt{3}}x, which can also be written as x±sqrt{3}y=0. 6. To find the distance (d) from the focus of the parabola to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola, we use the formula for the distance from a point to a line: d=frac{|Ax_{0}+By_{0}+C|}{sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}}, where (x_{0}, y_{0}) is the point and Ax+By+C=0 is the line. Substituting (0, 2) for the focus and x+sqrt{3}y=0 for the asymptote, we get d=frac{|2sqrt{3}|}{sqrt{1+(sqrt{3})^{2}}}=sqrt{3}.

By the problem's statement that the first two people's total is equal to the last three people's total, we have the equation: (a-2d) + (a-d) = (a) + (a+d) + (a+2d) Simplifying this equation, we get: 2a - 3d = 3a + 3d Hence, we find that a = -6d. Additionally, since the sum of all amounts must equal to the total amount of coins, we get another equation: (a-2d) + (a-d) + (a) + (a+d) + (a+2d) = 5 Substituting 5a for the sum of the five terms, we have: 5a = 5 Therefore, a = 1. Now we want to find the amount B receives, which is a-d.

Considering the elements of your dream, here’s a possible interpretation that may help you understand its meaning better: **The Pillow**: In dreams, an object like a pillow can symbolize comfort, support, and relaxation but also can represent the need to \\"soften\\" a situation or emotion. Your action of picking up the pillow and expressing discomfort might symbolize acknowledging and confronting personal issues or discomforts that you seek to address or alleviate. **Expression of Discomfort**: Communicating that \\"something inside me, something not good and not comfortable\\" can represent your own self-awareness and acknowledgment of inner conflicts, unease, or perhaps aspects of yourself you're struggling with. This might relate to personal issues or professional concerns about your ability to help and connect with your clients on a deeper level. **The Hypnotizing Circles and Falling**: The act of your client walking around you in circles and the ensuing sensation of falling into a dream or hypnosis can symbolize a process of deep introspection or therapy. It suggests being in a state of vulnerability and openness to understanding deeper parts of your psyche, facilitated by someone you trust (in this case, symbolized by your client). The circles may represent cycles or patterns in your life that you are perhaps trying to break free from. **The Exorcism Imagery**: Seeing a scary figure emerging from you and being filmed could symbolize the confrontation and expulsion of your inner fears, anxieties, or perhaps parts of yourself you’re not comfortable with. The imagery of exorcism here might be less about religious connotations and more about the process of externalizing and facing these negative aspects to heal or improve yourself. **The Light**: Your focus on the light, especially while in a state of vulnerability, suggests seeking guidance, clarity, and possibly enlightenment or relief from your worries. Light in dreams often represents hope, truth, and the seeking of a clearer path forward. **Your Client’s Childhood Memory**: The transition to your client’s childhood memories of loneliness after this intense sequence might symbolize the connection you have with your clients—how personal vulnerabilities and past experiences shape who we are. It might also reflect your role in helping your clients (or perhaps yourself) to confront and understand these deep-seated emotions and memories. **Interpretation**: The dream seems to parallel the themes of humanity, social values, and morals you often discuss with your client, blending them with your subconscious thoughts about personal growth, healing, and understanding. It might be reflecting your contemplation on the transformative power of facing one’s fears and discomforts (both in yourself and in your clients), supported by empathy, understanding, and human connection. It suggests a journey of confronting inner darkness with the aid of others, leading to personal insight and liberation from past burdens. Considering how your readings and professional interactions seep into your dreams, it might be helpful to reflect on how these themes play out in your waking life. Are there aspects of yourself you feel need attention or transformation? How does your relationship with your clients influence your perceptions of yourself and your role as a counselor or friend? This dream underscores the importance of self-awareness, connection, and support in personal and professional growth."},{"instruction":"Is there any book l could read about cycles or patterns in your life that you are perhaps trying to break free from.","output":"Yes, there are several books that delve into understanding and breaking free from cycles or patterns in one's life, whether those are related to behavior, relationships, thoughts, or emotions.

Given that the question does not specify how the string is stored within the class, I will assume a common approach using a \`std::string\` for storage. If the class uses a character array (\`char[]\`), the construction method would differ slightly. The following implementation assumes \`std::string\` is used for storage within the \`Str\` class: \`\`\`cpp #include <string> class Str { private: std::string data; // Assuming string storage is like this public: // Default constructor Str() : data(\\"\\") { // The constructor initializer list above initializes \`data\` with an empty string. // The body of the constructor is empty because nothing else is needed. } // Depending on requirements, you might want more functionality here, // such as getters, setters, other constructors, etc. }; \`\`\` In this implementation, \`data\` is a class member of type \`std::string\` which is used to store the string content of the \`Str\` class. The \`Str()\` constructor initializes \`data\` to an empty string \`\\"\\"\` right at the point of object creation, making use of the constructor initializer list (\`: data(\\"\\")\`). If instead, your class is meant to use a raw character array (e.g., \`char data[SIZE];\`), the implementation would need to include setting the first element of the array to the null character to indicate an empty string: \`\`\`cpp #include <cstring> // For strcpy or memset #define SIZE 256 // Example size class Str { private: char data[SIZE]; // Assuming a character array for storage public: // Default constructor Str() { data[0] = '0'; // Makes the string empty by setting the first character to the null terminator // Or using std::memset for arrays: std::memset(data, 0, SIZE); } }; \`\`\` This approach assigns \`'0'\` (the null character) to the first element of the array, effectively setting the string to be empty. This step ensures that any standard string functions (like \`strlen\` or \`strcpy\`) used elsewhere in your program will correctly interpret \`data\` as an empty string. Remember to adjust the storage method (\`std::string\` vs. \`char[]\`) according to your class's specifications or requirements."},{"instruction":"private: // You must use this data member char* data_; modify so it wokr with this data","output":"Given that the class must use a \`char* data_\` as its private data member for storing string data, you'll need to handle dynamic memory allocation to work with this pointer. When designing the default constructor for the \`Str\` class in this context, it's important to initialize \`data_\` in a manner that reflects an empty string, which means it should point to a dynamically allocated memory area that contains only the null character \`'0'\`. Here's how you could define the \`Str\` class with the requirements given: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> class Str { private: char* data_; public: // Default constructor Str() { data_ = new char[1]; // Allocate memory for one character data_[0] = '0'; // Set the first character to the null terminator, representing an empty string } // Destructor ~Str() { delete[] data_; // Free the dynamically allocated memory } // Copy constructor Str(const Str& other) { size_t length = strlen(other.data_); data_ = new char[length + 1]; // Allocate memory for the copy strcpy(data_, other.data_); // Copy the string including the null terminator } // Copy assignment operator Str& operator=(const Str& other) { if (this != &other) { // Protect against self-assignment delete[] data_; // Free existing memory size_t length = strlen(other.data_); data_ = new char[length + 1]; // Allocate new memory strcpy(data_, other.data_); // Copy the string } return *this; } // Additional functionality as required... }; \`\`\` This \`Str\` class definition includes: - A default constructor that initializes \`data_\` as an empty string by pointing it to a dynamically allocated char array of size 1 (which only contains the null terminator \`'0'\`). - A destructor (\`~Str()\`) to properly free the dynamically allocated memory and avoid memory leaks. This is crucial because we're directly managing memory with \`new\` and \`delete\`. - A copy constructor and copy assignment operator that handle deep copying of the string data pointed to by \`data_\`. These are necessary because the default versions generated by the compiler would only copy the pointer (shallow copy), not the string data itself, leading to potential issues with multiple \`Str\` objects pointing to the same memory area. Remember, direct management of memory using raw pointers (e.g., using \`new\` and \`delete\`) increases the complexity of your code and its potential for errors, such as memory leaks or double deletions. In modern C++, it's often preferred to use smart pointers or standard library facilities like \`std::string\` to manage dynamic memory, unless there are specific reasons or requirements to do otherwise."},{"instruction":"in c++ what is inheritance","output":"Inheritance is a fundamental concept in C++ and other object-oriented programming languages, allowing the creation of a new class that is based on an existing class. The new class (called the derived or child class) inherits attributes and behaviors (i.e., data members and member functions) from the existing class (called the base or parent class), and can introduce its own additional attributes and behaviors or modify inherited ones. This mechanism supports the implementation of hierarchical classifications and promotes code reusability and extensibility. Inheritance Types: 1. **Single Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from only one base class. 2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from more than one base class. 3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from a base class, which itself is derived from another base class, forming a \\"chain\\" of inheritance. 4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class. 5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance. Key Concepts in Inheritance: - **Base Class (Parent Class)**: The class whose properties are inherited by another class. - **Derived Class (Child Class)**: The class that inherits properties from another class. - **Inheritance Access Specifiers**: Controls the accessibility of the base class members to the derived class. The three specifiers are: - **public inheritance**: Public and protected members of the base class remain public and protected in the derived class. - **protected inheritance**: Public and protected members of the base class become protected in the derived class. - **private inheritance**: Public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class. - **Virtual Functions**: Allows a function in the base class to be overridden in the derived class. This supports polymorphism. - **Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions**: Used to define interfaces or behaviors that derived classes must implement. - **Constructors and Destructors**: Inheritance impacts the way constructors and destructors are called. A derived class constructor calls its base class constructor, and a derived class destructor calls its base class destructor. Example of Inheritance: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> using namespace std; class Animal { // Base class public: void eat() { cout << \\"I can eat!\\" << endl; } }; class Dog : public Animal { // Derived class public: void bark() { cout << \\"I can bark! Woof woof!\\" << endl; } }; int main() { Dog myDog; myDog.eat(); // Calls function from the base class myDog.bark(); // Calls function from the derived class return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, \`Dog\` is a derived class that inherits from the \`Animal\` base class. The \`Dog\` class has access to the \`eat\` method inherited from \`Animal\`, and it also defines its own method, \`bark\`. Inheritance allows for the expression of \\"is-a\\" relationships (e.g., a dog is an animal), facilitating code reuse (by inheriting methods and attributes from base classes) and the creation of more complex class hierarchies, enhancing the expressiveness and power of the language."},{"instruction":"so derived class can access all public and private mem of the base class?","output":"No, a derived class cannot directly access the private members of its base class. In C++ and other object-oriented programming languages, access control is a key aspect of inheritance, which helps in maintaining encapsulation — a core principle of object-oriented programming that restricts direct access to some of an object's components. Here's how access control works in the context of inheritance: 1. **Public Members**: Public members of the base class remain accessible in the derived class. Therefore, public member functions and public data members of the base class can be accessed by objects of the derived class. 2. **Protected Members**: Protected members of the base class are accessible within the derived class (and any class further derived from it), but not accessible by objects of the derived or base class directly. They are meant to be used by subclass implementations but are not part of the class's public interface. 3. **Private Members**: Private members of the base class are not accessible directly from the derived class. They can only be accessed by member functions within the base class itself. If the derived class needs to access private members of the base class, it must do so through public or protected member functions provided by the base class. The above rules apply to class members (both data members and member functions). This encapsulation and access control mechanism helps in maintaining the integrity of the data and the implementation details of the base class, ensuring that they cannot be unintentionally modified by the derived class. To enable the derived class some form of access to its private members, the base class typically provides public or protected \\"getter\\" and \\"setter\\" functions or other public/protected member functions that internally manipulate these private members. Example illustrating access control: \`\`\`cpp class Base { private: int privateVar; // Only accessible within Base class protected: int protectedVar; // Accessible within Base, Derived, and further derived classes public: int publicVar; // Accessible from anywhere void setPrivate(int val) { privateVar = val; } // Public setter to manipulate private member int getPrivate() { return privateVar; } // Public getter to access private member }; class Derived : public Base { public: void func() { publicVar = 1; // Allowed: Direct access because it's public in Base protectedVar = 2; // Allowed: Derived class can access protected members of Base // privateVar = 3; // Not allowed: Derived class cannot access private members of Base setPrivate(3); // Allowed: Indirectly setting privateVar through a public function of Base int val = getPrivate(); // Allowed: Indirectly accessing privateVar through a public function of Base } }; \`\`\` In this example, \`Derived\` cannot directly access \`privateVar\` from \`Base\`, but it can manipulate it indirectly through public member functions \`setPrivate\` and \`getPrivate\`."},{"instruction":"what is \\"throw\\" in c++","output":"In C++, the \`throw\` keyword is used to signal the occurrence of an anomalous or exceptional condition within a program, prompting it to exit the normal flow of execution by raising an exception that can be caught and handled by some part of the program. This mechanism enables error handling to be organized and robust, especially in situations where returning an error code would be insufficient or clumsy. When a function encounters a situation it cannot handle, it can \`throw\` an exception: \`\`\`cpp void mightGoWrong() { bool errorOccurred = true; if (errorOccurred) { throw \\"Something went wrong!\\"; } } int main() { try { mightGoWrong(); } catch(const char* e) { std::cerr << \\"Error: \\" << e << std::endl; } return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, \`mightGoWrong\` checks if an error has occurred and uses \`throw\` to raise an exception if so. The string \`\\"Something went wrong!\\"\` is thrown as the exception. This \`throw\` causes the execution to leave the current block of code immediately. The execution then jumps to the nearest enclosing \`try\` block, if any, and searches for a \`catch\` block that matches the type of the thrown object. In the \`main\` function, the call to \`mightGoWrong\` is enclosed in a \`try\` block, which is followed by a \`catch\` block designed to catch exceptions of type \`const char*\`. When the exception is thrown within \`mightGoWrong\`, execution in that function ceases, and control transfers to the \`catch\` block in \`main\`, where the exception is handled by printing an error message to standard error output. Exceptions can be of any type, although it's common to use the standard library's exception classes derived from \`std::exception\`, as these provide useful functionality such as the \`what()\` method that returns a C-style character string describing the exception. Here is an example using \`std::exception\`: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <exception> class MyException : public std::exception { public: const char* what() const noexcept override { return \\"Custom Exception occurred\\"; } }; void mightGoWrongAgain() { throw MyException(); } int main() { try { mightGoWrongAgain(); } catch(const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << \\"Error: \\" << e.what() << std::endl; } return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, a custom exception class \`MyException\` is defined, deriving from \`std::exception\` and overriding the \`what()\` method. The \`mightGoWrongAgain\` function throws an instance of \`MyException\`, and the \`catch\` block in \`main\` is prepared to catch exceptions of type \`std::exception&\`, which includes \`MyException\` due to polymorphism."},{"instruction":"what is *this pointer in c++","output":"The \`this\` pointer in C++ is a special keyword that represents a pointer to the instance of the class in which it appears. It is automatically passed as a hidden argument to all nonstatic member function calls and is available as a local variable within the body of all nonstatic functions. \`this\` allows a class's member functions to refer to the object upon which they are acting, providing a way to access the members of the object. Key uses and characteristics of the \`this\` pointer include: 1. **Accessing Members**: It is used to access class members when their names are shadowed by local variables (parameters) with the same name. \`\`\`cpp class Example { private: int value; public: void setValue(int value) { this->value = value; // Here, 'this->value' refers to the member variable, while 'value' refers to the function parameter. } }; \`\`\` 2. **Returning *this from a Method**: Methods that return \`*this\` return a reference to the calling object, allowing for method chaining. \`\`\`cpp class Chain { public: Chain& add(int x) { // Some operation return *this; } }; Chain c; c.add(1).add(2).add(3); // Method chaining enabled by returning *this \`\`\` 3. **Checking Self-Assignment in Operator Overloading**: In operators that might be susceptible to self-assignment issues, such as assignment operators, \`this\` can be used to check and prevent such problems. \`\`\`cpp class SelfCheck { public: SelfCheck& operator=(const SelfCheck& rhs) { if (this != &rhs) { // Prevent self-assignment // Copy data } return *this; } }; \`\`\` 4. **Returning the Current Object from Within Member Functions**: The \`this\` pointer can be used when you need a pointer or a reference to the current object from within member functions. The \`this\` pointer is not available in static member functions as static members belong to the class rather than to any instance of the class. Hence, there's no \`this\` pointer because there's no object involved. One thing to note is that the type of \`this\` in a non-const member function of a class \`X\` is \`X* const\`, which means that while you can't modify what \`this\` points to (you can't make \`this\` point to a different instance), you can modify the members of the object it points to. In a const member function, the type of \`this\` is \`const X* const\`, meaning you cannot modify either the pointer or the values of the object's members (through \`this\`). Understanding and using the \`this\` pointer effectively can be crucial for writing clear and maintainable object-oriented code in C++."},{"instruction":"so *this pointer point to whatever is in the parameter?","output":"It seems there might be a bit of confusion regarding the \`*this\` pointer. Let me clarify: The \`*this\` pointer does **not** point to whatever is in the parameter of a function. Instead, within a class member function (non-static), the \`*this\` pointer always points to the object for which the member function was called. It provides a way to refer to the invoking object itself. Here’s a breakdown to ensure clarity: 1. **What \`this\` Represents**: In a member function of a class, \`this\` is a pointer that points to the object for which the function is called. It serves as an implicit argument to all member functions. For example, if you have an object \`obj\` of class \`Example\` and you call \`obj.memberFunction()\`, inside \`memberFunction\`, \`this\` will point to \`obj\`. 2. **Accessing Members**: You might use \`this->memberVariable\` to explicitly access a member variable of the object. This is especially useful if a local variable or a function parameter shadows a member variable name. 3. **Returning *this**: When a member function returns \`*this\`, it is returning a reference to the object it belongs to. This technique is often used to allow chaining of method calls. Here’s an illustrative example: \`\`\`cpp class MyClass { public: int x; MyClass(int val) : x(val) {} // A member function that could modify the object and return it for chaining MyClass& increment() { x++; // increments the value of x for the current object return *this; // returns the current object } }; int main() { MyClass obj(10); // create an object of MyClass obj.increment().increment(); // chained calls // Here, increment() modifies obj and then returns it, allowing another call to increment without needing to specify the object again. return 0; } \`\`\` In the \`increment\` function, \`this\` is a pointer to \`obj\` (when \`increment\` is called on \`obj\`), and \`*this\` is used to return a reference to \`obj\` itself. Therefore, the \`*this\` pointer doesn’t point to \\"whatever is in the parameter\\" but rather to the object instance the method was invoked on."},{"instruction":"class MyArray { public: MyArray(); MyArray(int d[], int num); MyArray(const MyArray& rhs); MyArray& operator=(const MyArray& rhs); ~MyArray(); int *dat; int len; } MyArray::MyArray(const MyArray &rhs){ { len = rhs.len; dat = new int[len]; // copy from rhs.dat to dat } MyArray& MyArray::operator=(const MyArray &rhs){ { if(this == &rhs) return *this; if(dat) delete dat; len = rhs.len; dat = new int[len]; // copy from rhs.dat to dat return *this; } int main() { int vals1[] = {9,3,7,5}, vals2[] = {8,3,4,1}; MyArray a1(vals1,4); MyArray a2(vals2,4); a1 = a1; a2 = a1; } explains each line below in the program and what the function do : MyArray& MyArray::operator=(const MyArray &rhs){ { if(this == &rhs) return *this; if(dat) delete dat; len = rhs.len; dat = new int[len]; // copy from rhs.dat to dat return *this; }","output":"Your implementation of the copy assignment operator in the \`MyArray\` class is designed to assign one \`MyArray\` object's value to another. Let's go through each line of your function to explain what it does: \`\`\`cpp MyArray& MyArray::operator=(const MyArray &rhs){ \`\`\` This line starts the definition of the copy assignment operator. It allows you to use the assignment operator (\`=\`) to copy the contents from one \`MyArray\` object (\`rhs\`, which stands for right-hand side) to another. The function returns a reference to the \`MyArray\` instance (\`*this\`), to enable chain assignments (e.g., \`a1 = a2 = a3\`). \`\`\`cpp { \`\`\` This additional opening brace seems to be a mistake and should not be there. Typically, a single opening brace \`{\` begins the function body after the function signature. \`\`\`cpp if(this == &rhs) return *this; \`\`\` This line checks if the address of the current object (\`this\`) is the same as the address of the object being assigned from (\`rhs\`). If they are the same (meaning you are assigning an object to itself), the function immediately returns a reference to the current object. This is a safety check to prevent self-assignment from causing issues such as unintended data deletion. \`\`\`cpp if(dat) delete dat; \`\`\` Here, you first check if \`dat\` (which presumably points to a dynamically allocated array of \`int\`) is non-null. If it is, you delete the allocated memory to prevent memory leaks before allocating new memory. However, this line should be \`delete[] dat;\` instead of \`delete dat;\` because \`dat\` points to an array, and \`delete[]\` should be used for arrays allocated with \`new[]\`. \`\`\`cpp len = rhs.len; dat = new int[len]; \`\`\` You set the \`len\` member variable of the current object to the \`len\` of the object \`rhs\`. Then, you allocate new memory for \`dat\` based on the new \`len\`. This prepares \`dat\` to store a copy of \`rhs\`'s array. \`\`\`cpp // copy from rhs.dat to dat \`\`\` Although commented out and not implemented in your snippet, this comment indicates where you would copy the contents of the array pointed to by \`rhs.dat\` into the array newly allocated and pointed to by \`this->dat\`. A common way of doing this is by using a loop or the \`std::copy\` function from the \`<algorithm>\` header. \`\`\`cpp return *this; \`\`\` Finally, you return a reference to the current instance (\`*this\`). This allows the assignment operator to be used in chain assignments and is a common practice for assignment operators in C++. \`\`\`cpp } \`\`\` This closing brace should match the opening brace of the function definition, but because of the additional opening brace you added at the beginning, you have one too many. To correct and complete your snippet, ensure proper memory management (using \`delete[]\`), and include the necessary loop or function to copy the array, your assignment operator should look like: \`\`\`cpp MyArray& MyArray::operator=(const MyArray &rhs) { if (this == &rhs) return *this; // Self-assignment check delete[] dat; // Free existing resource len = rhs.len; dat = new int[len]; // Allocate new memory for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) { dat[i] = rhs.dat[i]; // Deep copy the elements } return *this; } \`\`\` This revised implementation fixes the initial mistake with the extra brace and uses \`delete[]\` for array deletion. It also includes a loop for copying array elements, ensuring a deep copy of the data."},{"instruction":"std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& istr, Str& s) { std::string stemp; istr >> stemp; s = stemp.c_str(); return istr; } base on this create the << operator function and define it","output":"To complement your \`operator>>\` function for the class \`Str\` with an \`operator<<\` function for output, you will similarly use a \`std::string\` as an intermediary for the conversion between the \`Str\` type and the stream. This means you need a way to convert your \`Str\` class instance to a \`std::string\` or directly output its internal string representation. For this example, I'll make an assumption about how your \`Str\` class is implemented, given that the implementation details are not provided. Assuming the \`Str\` class has a way to access its internal string representation (e.g., through a member function or directly if the internal representation is public), the \`operator<<\` function can be defined as follows: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> class Str { private: char* data_; // Assuming this is your internal representation public: // Constructors, destructor, etc. not shown for brevity // Conversion function to std::string for easy output std::string toString() const { return std::string(data_); } // Friend declaration for operator<< and operator>> friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& istr, Str& s); friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const Str& s); }; // Assuming implementation for operator>> is as previously defined std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const Str& s) { ostr << s.toString(); // Utilizes the toString() member function for output return ostr; } \`\`\` In this example, \`Str\` has a member function \`toString()\` that converts its internal \`char* data_\` representation to a \`std::string\`. This function is then used in \`operator<<\` to output the \`Str\`'s contents. The use of a member function like \`toString()\` provides a clean way to abstract away the class's internal representation, which could be helpful if the implementation of \`Str\` changes in the future. Note that both \`operator>>\` and \`operator<<\` are declared as friends of the \`Str\` class, which allows them to access private and protected members of \`Str\`. This is necessary for them to work directly with the \`data_\` member variable or any private member functions needed to perform their operations. This implementation also assumes that the \`Str\` class has an appropriate mechanism (not shown here) to handle the assignment \`s = stemp.c_str();\` in the \`operator>>\` function, such that it properly manages the memory and copies the string from \`stemp.c_str()\` into \`s.data_\`. Ensure that your class correctly handles these operations to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper object state management."},{"instruction":"why is it const Str& s for ostream but only Str& s for istream","output":"The difference in constness between the use of \`Str&\` for \`std::istream\` and \`const Str&\` for \`std::ostream\` in the overloads of \`operator>>\` and \`operator<<\`, respectively, reflects the differing intentions and requirements of input and output operations in C++. # For \`std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& istr, Str& s)\`: - The purpose is to **read from** the stream and **modify** the object \`s\`. Since it modifies \`s\`, it cannot be \`const\`. - After reading data from the input stream (\`istr\`), the content of \`s\` is changed to reflect what was read. Therefore, \`s\` needs to be a non-const reference because the operation intends to alter the state of \`s\`. # For \`std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const Str& s)\`: - The purpose here is to **write to** the stream without altering the state of the object \`s\`. The object \`s\` is being used to output its data, but its internal state remains unchanged. - Using \`const Str&\` ensures that the function promises not to modify the \`s\` object. This is a common and best practice when designing functions that are supposed to read from and not modify their arguments. It increases function safety, making sure that objects passed to \`operator<<\` cannot be accidentally altered. Furthermore, it allows objects that are themselves \`const\` to be outputted using this operator. This distinction adheres to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that functions only request the permissions they require to perform their task—no more, no less. By marking \`s\` as \`const\` in the \`operator<<\` signature, you're effectively telling both the compiler and the programmers who might use or review your code that \`operator<<\` will not modify the object \`s\`.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"BWM'S case study « Conduite du changement dans un environnement PLM » \\"Formation interculturelle dans un environnement PLM\\" BWM'S manufactures vehicle fitout kits and specialized in vehicle conversion on several sites in France. Founded in 1989, the company is considered a small-scale manufacturer that manages the whole range of technical data like large-scale constructors, while using fewer resources. Moreover, the company's main characteristic is the production of very small volumes (a few units for specific products, depending on demand). The group has only been built up through external growth over the last 15 years. The case study concerns only the main factory, the Group's head office located at Vannes (40% of the workforce and 55% of sales). As the vehicles produced are specific, synergies between different Group sites are so far rather rare. In the main factory the design and engineering department (BE/BM) is made up of around fifteen people. BWM'S designs and manufactures fitout kits for company vehicles (20% of the production load - average process of 10 weeks) and commercial vehicles for its own brand (70% - 6 months) or on behalf of large-scale manufacturers (10% - 18 months). 'Altogether, the BE/BM manages out between 25 and 45 projects a year. In addition to the production for major automotive constructors, BWM'S own brand commercial fuel powered utility vehicles are divided into four categories : company vehicles, passenger transport, goods transport, and security vehicles (police, army). The designers are assigned to a specific product category and manage their own projects throughout the product's life-cycle. The company decided to invest in a PLM system in 2022, when replacing its CAD software (CGTECH by Catia V5). The main project objective was to secure and share CAD files within the design office and with the workshop. PLM is internal to the company, and all the design work has been carried out at the manufacturer's head office. The implemented software package is published by Dassault Systemes. A budget of €450,000 over 2 years (2022 to 2024) has been invested in this project. The company has been assisted by a digital services company, expert in automotive PLM. BWM'S is projecting to design its own brand of electric utility vehicles. However, the company does not have the technological know-how to completely design this product. BWM'S decision-makers are launching an international call for a joint-venture to work on the project. Four international groups specializing in connectivity and/or supplying software solutions (driver assistance systems, entertainment, mobility services....) answered this invitation and will be meeting the decision-makers for an exploratory meeting.

We'll take the notion of a \\"nightmare person\\" to mean a character who is deliberately challenging, perhaps antagonistic or difficult to deal with, but not necessarily evil or devoid of redeeming qualities. This can be a person who is overly dominating, manipulative, or excessively demanding in their social interactions. # MBTI: ESTP (The Entrepreneur) - **Why ESTP?** ESTPs are known for their high energy, enthusiasm, and sometimes for pushing boundaries, which could contribute to a \\"nightmare\\" vibe if taken to an extreme. In their less healthy versions, they might become reckless, overly domineering, or insensitive to others' feelings. # Enneagram: Type 8w7 (The Maverick) - **Why Type 8w7?** Enneagram Type 8s are assertive, strong-willed, and can be quite confrontational, which could easily become overwhelming for others. The 7-wing adds a hedonistic streak, making the person more prone to seeking personal gratification and perhaps disregarding the consequences of their actions on others. # Temperament: Choleric - **Why Choleric?** The Choleric temperament is marked by ambition, energy, and a sometimes aggressive pursuit of goals. Choleric individuals can be excellent leaders but might turn into \\"nightmare\\" figures when their desire for control overrides their concern for others' feelings or autonomy. # Big Five Personality Traits: - **Extraversion: High** – They thrive on social interaction but might dominate conversations and social settings to an uncomfortable degree. - **Neuroticism: High** – This could manifest as a volatile temperament and a tendency to react intensely to situations, amplifying their challenging nature. - **Conscientiousness: Low to Medium** – A disregard for rules or details could make them unpredictable or unreliable. - **Agreeableness: Low** – They might often be in conflict with others, pushing back against any form of criticism or opposition. - **Openness: High** – They're open to new experiences, which fuels their adventurous spirit but might also lead them into conflict through recklessness. # Socionics: SLE (The Conqueror) - **Why SLE?** This type is analogous to the MBTI ESTP, characterized by decisiveness, a drive for impact, and potentially, an imposing demeanor. They're natural leaders but might become overwhelming in their assertiveness and challenge to authority. # Instinctual Variant: Sexual (sx) / Social (so) - **Why sx/so?** This combination seeks intensity in relationships and social dominance, respectively, which can contribute to a character who commands attention but can also be seen as too intense or overbearing. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin - **Why Slytherin?** Slytherin values ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness. A \\"nightmare\\" character from this house might leverage these traits in ways that are self-serving and manipulative, valuing their own success over the well-being of others. # Moral Alignment: Chaotic Neutral - **Why Chaotic Neutral?** This alignment indicates someone who values their own freedom and autonomy above all else, without an innate desire to do good or evil but often causing trouble or conflict due to their disdain for authority and rules. In weaving together these specific traits, you get a multifaceted character who is energized by social interaction but also possesses qualities that might make them a challenging acquaintance, partner, or leader. They can be compelling and dynamic but also volatile, making them a \\"nightmare\\" in certain interpersonal situations."},{"instruction":"i had made a youtube shorts make catchy youtube shorts title (atleast 2 strong # in title), description (use atleast 10 strong # in description) and keywords (separated by comma in para form) to make it SEO strong and transcription of shorts is \\"Discovering Sikh History: Guru Hargobind Sahib In the video transcription, it is mentioned that a message was sent to Guru Hargobind indicating that the level of cruelty had reached a point where direct confrontation was necessary.

Since eternal oblivion could be interpreted as the absolute end with no consciousness or existence beyond, we might infer a lack of traits often associated with awareness, change, or emotion. However, for the sake of this creative exercise, let's assign a set of typologies to \\"eternal oblivion\\" by considering its universally neutral, unchanging, and final nature. # MBTI: ISTP - **Why ISTP?** ISTPs are known for their pragmatic approach and focus on the present moment, without being overly concerned with the future or the abstract. Eternal oblivion, devoid of future or abstract concerns, aligns somewhat with this present-focused, reality-based mindset. # Enneagram: Type 5 (The Investigator) - **Why Type 5?** Enneagram Type 5s are analytical, secretive, and independent. They detach from emotions to observe and understand the world. Eternal oblivion can be seen as the ultimate detachment, a state beyond emotions and worldly understanding. # Temperament: Melancholic - **Why Melancholic?** The melancholic temperament is analytical and detail-oriented but also prone to introspection and contemplation, often with a penchant for considering the more profound or somber aspects of life. The infinite quietude and finality of eternal oblivion could be seen as mirroring these introspective and contemplative depths. # Big Five: - **Extraversion: Low**. Eternal oblivion implies the absence of interaction or energy exchange with others. - **Neuroticism: Low**. It represents a state of absolute neutrality and peace, devoid of worry or emotional turbulence. - **Conscientiousness: High/Low**. This trait is hard to assign; however, considering oblivion as the ultimate order (or disorder), one might see it as both unquestionable (high) and irrelevant (low). - **Agreeableness: Neutral**. Oblivion doesn’t engage in conflict or cooperation. - **Openness: Low**. It signifies an end to change, learning, and experiences. # Socionics: SLI (The Craftsman, Sensing Logical Introvert) - **Why SLI?** This type, akin to ISTP in MBTI, is practical, detached, and comfortable with solitude. Eternal oblivion's nature of absolute solitude and detachment resonates with the SLI's characteristics. # Instinctual Variant: Sp (Self-Preservation) - **Why Sp?** This might seem counterintuitive, but eternal oblivion's essence of nonexistence and detachment from life's needs and battles could be viewed as the ultimate form of self-preservation, beyond worldly concerns. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin - **Why Slytherin?** This choice is less about ambition or cunning and more about Slytherin’s association with dealing with the darker aspects of the world and existence. A nuanced understanding or acceptance of eternal oblivion could be akin to the depth and complexity often found in Slytherin characters. # Moral Alignment: True Neutral - **Why True Neutral?** Eternal oblivion encompasses the end of all dichotomies—good vs. evil, chaos vs. order. It represents the purest form of neutrality, beyond moral or ethical concerns. This speculative exercise integrates the concept of eternal oblivion with various personality frameworks, projecting qualities onto a state that is fundamentally beyond human experience or emotion. It’s a blend of literal interpretations and symbolic attributions, aiming to creatively engage with the typologies listed."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

На момент моего последнего обновления до 2023 года, информация о сериале \\"Джентльмены\\" на 2024 год доступна ограниченно, но могу представить, какие черты характерные для Ричи могли бы преобладать в этом проекте, основываясь на его предыдущих работах. 1. **Быстрый ритм повествования**: Ричи любит динамичную сюжетную линию, перемежаемую острыми диалогами и активными сценами. Его способность удерживать внимание зрителя с помощью стремительного развития событий очевидна во многих его фильмах, таких как \\"Карты, деньги, два ствола\\" и \\"Большой куш\\". 2. **Запутанные сюжетные линии с неожиданными поворотами**: Характерно для фильмов Гая Ричи обилие внезапных поворотов и переплетений, заставляющих зрителя напряженно следить за развитием событий. Можно ожидать, что и в сериале \\"Джентльмены\\" зрителей ждет множество сюрпризов. 3. **Характерные персонажи**: Ричи славится созданием цветных, запоминающихся персонажей с яркой индивидуальностью. От преступников с низов до барышей высшего света, его герои всегда уникальны и обладают определенным шармом. 4. **Использование монтажа**: В его фильмах часто используются нелинейная нарративная структура и инновационные методы монтажа, например, быстрые смены кадров, разделение экрана и обратные хронологии, что придает динамизм рассказу. 5. **Стильный визуальный ряд**: Гай Ричи обладает отменным чувством стиля, что видно по его вниманию к деталям в костюмах, декорациях и общей визуализации сюжета. Его работы часто отличаются стилизованной картинкой и плавным камерным движением, создавая определенную атмосферу. 6. **Смешение жанров**: Хотя Ричи чаще всего ассоциируется с криминальными комедиями, он не боится экспериментировать, смешивая элементы разных жанров - от драмы до боевика и даже фэнтези. 7. **Острый и ироничный юмор**: Юмор является одной из ключевых составляющих стиля Ричи. Его способность сочетать острую сатиру с комичными ситуациями и диалогами делает его фильмы уникально забавными. Сериал \\"Джентльмены\\", основываясь на фильме Ричи 2019 года с одноименным названием, скорее всего, наследует эти характерные черты. Предположительно сериал будет исследовать подземный мир наркотрафика в Лондоне, представляя изобилие харизматичных персонажей, витиеватые сюжетные повороты и характерный для Гая Ричи уникальный стиль повествования."},{"instruction":"Сказочно смешной сериал с любимыми актерами в самых неожиданных образах.

Фильм поставлен в диком и опустошенном мире, где вода и топливо являются наиболее ценными ресурсами, а порядок и закон давно забыты. Это история о выживании и бунте против тирании. Главный герой, Макс Рокатански, которого играет Том Харди, — бывший полицейский, ставший одиноким странником в разрушенном мире, где правит беззаконие и насилие. Жизненный путь Макса пересекается с Императоршей Фуриосой, воплощенной Шарлиз Терон, которая стала одним из самых ярких и запоминающихся персонажей современного кинематографа. Фуриоса — это смелая и решительная женщина, водитель грузовика-цистерны, работающая на тирана Иммортана Джо, деспота, контролирующего жизненно важный запас воды. Она совершает предательство, уводя из под контроля Джо пять женщин, которых тот держит как \\"живых собственностей\\" для продолжения рода. Фуриоса стремится доставить их в \\"Зеленые Земли\\", где они смогут обрести свободу и безопасность. Фильм по сути становится гонкой за свободой на фоне постапокалиптического пейзажа, полного опасностей и враждебных группировок. Фуриоса демонстрирует исключительные навыки вождения и боя, стойкость и непоколебимую волю к победе над угнетением и несправедливостью. Ее образ неразрывно связан с темами феминизма и борьбы с патриархатом, что делает ее важным символом в культуре XXI века. \\"Безумный Макс: Дорога ярости\\" получил высокие оценки критиков и зрителей за свою невероятную визуальную составляющую, мастерство режиссуры, хореографию погонь и боевых сцен, а также за глубокую эмоциональную и философскую насыщенность. Фильм был удостоен множества наград, включая шесть премий Оскар из десяти номинаций, что стало подтверждением его исключительности и влияния на культуру."},{"instruction":"Фильм “Фуриоса” — приквел “Безумного Макса”, который расскажет, что происходило с героиней до событий фильма.

Главная роль досталась очаровательной Ане Тейлор-Джой, которая стала звездой сериала “Ход королевы”. А одного из злодеев сыграет Крис Хемсворт.

Этот приквел предложит зрителям уникальную возможность узнать о происхождении и становлении Фуриосы, героини, которая в \\"Дороге ярости\\" проявила себя как невероятно сильная и принципиальная воительница. Фильм обещает unravel the complexities of her character, showing her transition from a less experienced fighter to the formidable warrior audiences admired in “Mad Max: Fury Road”. Ана Тейлор-Джой, чья карьера стремительно взлетела после успеха сериала \\"Ход королевы\\", воплотит на экране молодую Фуриосу. С ее участием можно смело ожидать глубоко проработанного и многогранного персонажа. Тейлор-Джой, уже доказавшая свое мастерство в передаче сложных эмоций и создании запоминающихся образов, без сомнения, добавит измерение уязвимости и силы в предысторию Фуриосы. Крис Хемсворт, широко известный по роли Тора во франшизе Marvel, примет участие в фильме в роли Военачальника Дементуса. Эта роль представляется уникальной возможностью для Хемсворта исследовать более мрачные и зловещие аспекты своего актерского таланта, отойдя от образов героических и благородных персонажей. Военачальник Дементус, предводитель жестокой банды байкеров, по всей видимости, станет одним из ключевых антагонистов в истории Фуриосы, внося в сюжет элемент напряжения и конфликта. Фильм \\"Фуриоса\\" обещает стать волнующим и динамичным вкладом во вселенную \\"Безумного Макса\\", раскрывая новые слои уже знакомой истории и добавляя глубину к образу одной из самых фасцинирующих героинь в современном кино.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a reverse logarithmic formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win.

Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the margins in both lists can have a wide range. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"**Welcome to The Grand Duel of Glamours** *Featuring Sapphire, the teen champion of magic dueling, and the young prodigy Lily.* **Pre-Duel Setup:** - **Sapphire's Initial Stats:** Spell Power - 90, Performance - 85 - **Lily's Initial Stats:** Spell Power - 70, Performance - 60 - **Childish Meter:** Starts at 0, caps at 100, once 100 is reached, the meter resets, and Sapphire receives an additional 15% reduction to her Performance stat. - **Age Regression Mechanic:** On every turn, as a result of Lily's secret casting at the duel's start, Sapphire regresses by 2 years physically and mentally, impacting her stats.

It uses a poetic style which is effective for creating a vivid and inspiring image of the place. The structure and choice of words evoke a sense of grandeur and potential. However, for absolute clarity and natural flow, especially in formal or less artistic contexts, you might consider minor adjustments. Here are a few considerations: 1. **Punctuation and Capitalization**: The passage, as written, stylistically resembles poetry. If that's the intention, the structure works well. However, if this is meant to be read as prose or in a more conventional narrative, adding proper punctuation and adjusting the capitalization for consistency would be beneficial. 2. **Adjective Use**: The adjectives \\"profound,\\" \\"great,\\" and the phrase \\"a land of hopes and opportunities\\" are effective but slightly generic. Depending on the context or the intended audience, it might be more engaging to include specific aspects of Quanzhou's history, culture, strength, and charm that make it unique. Considering these points, if the intention is to maintain a poetic tone while ensuring a smooth, natural flow in a broad context, you could keep the structure with slight modifications for punctuation: \\"Steeped in profound history and culture, pulsing with great strength and charm, Quanzhou, a land of hopes and opportunities, is where your dreams can come true.\\" This format maintains the original style with slightly improved readability for a variety of contexts. If you're targeting a specific audience or context (e.g., a travel brochure, a historical article, a cultural presentation), further tailoring the passage to include particular details or stories from Quanzhou could make it even more compelling and natural."},{"instruction":"Peaks of Tianzhu Mountain reach high, where eyes embrace the view of sky","output":"Your sentence has a poetic and visually evocative quality.

The phrasing \\"Peaks of Tianzhu Mountain reach high\\" captures the towering presence of the mountains effectively, though if aiming for absolute grammatical precision and smoothness in standard prose, some might suggest a slight rephrasing for clarity. However, given the poetic context, such rigid adjustments aren't necessary. Your sentence is both natural within its poetic style and free from errors as it stands.

This version, with its slight alteration, emphasizes the personal experience of viewing the sky, making it a bit more intimate. The structure and phrasing work well for evoking a sense of awe and connection to nature. The choice to use \\"one\\" instead of \\"eyes\\" shifts the focus slightly from the visual aspect to the personal, experiential aspect of being in the mountains and gazing upwards.

However, for clarity or in more conventional descriptions, you might prefer phrases like \\"grandeur abounds,\\" \\"grandeur unfolds,\\" or \\"grandeur stands,\\" which convey the magnificence of the Tulou buildings in a way that might be more immediately accessible or understandable to the audience.

Daphne believes the curse is real, but Velma doubts it, so Fred explains that they must solve the mystery. There are fireworks around town, with puzzles that lead to clues. There are five suspects and you need to find and play five clues to match the suspect. Anyone who passes all five statements is a criminal. After finding all five clues, Velma plans to trap the dragon in the maze and bribe Scooby and Shaggy with a bowl of pasta. When the python came, he got scared and jumped on it. After the dragon appears, a suspect matching the five clues is revealed, and Velma explains why. After the dragon appears, the celebration can continue. When Velma tells Shaggy and Scooby that the noodles went bad while they were on the ground, Shaggy and Scooby eat them anyway, and Fred, Daphne, and Velma leave. While Shaggy is eating ground noodles, he grabs the dragon mask that Scooby is wearing.","output":"**Title: Scooby-Doo and the Python Palace Paradox** (Open with the gang back in Ming's Chinese Kitchen, because apparently, this is the only restaurant they ever visit anymore.)

We're either extraordinarily lucky or caught in a rerun loop.\\" FRED: \\"Either way, we've got a mystery on our hands, gang. Emperor Chou's underground palace? Sounds like my kind of place!\\" DAPHNE: (with a playful smirk) \\"Let's just hope this Emperor Chou doesn't have a wardrobe as cursed as Fred's driving skills.\\" (Cut to the temple with the dragon statue that disintegrates and comes to life.) FRED: (unfazed) \\"Disintegrating dragons? Par for the course. Now, if only parking tickets disappeared like that.\\" SHAGGY: \\"Zoinks! Like, it must've been on a really high-fiber diet to disintegrate like that!\\" (The gang starts collecting clues amidst fireworks, somehow unconcerned by the continuous life-threatening dangers they face.) VELMA: \\"Fireworks with puzzles? This Emperor Chou really knew how to throw a party. Or a convoluted quest. Take your pick.\\" DAPHNE: \\"At least it's not another haunted mansion. I was beginning to feel like a real estate agent for the undead.\\" (Each clue found and puzzle solved comes with its own mini-adventure, showcasing each character's newfound namesake trait hilariously affecting their personality without them realizing.) FRED: (driving recklessly to the next clue) \\"Obeying the laws of physics is overrated anyway!\\" SHAGGY: \\"Like, Scoob, did you ever notice how every time we solve a mystery, our names seem less like names and more like... personality assignments?\\" SCOOBY: (nods in agreement) \\"Ruh-roh, Raggy.

VELMA: \\"According to my calculations, this trap is foolproof.\\" DAPHNE: \\"And according to my intuition, we're about to become the fools.\\" (The python-turned-dragon is eventually caught in the trap, with Velma dismayingly noting the trap worked more due to luck than her meticulous planning.) VELMA: \\"I'll add 'luck' to my calculations next time.\\" (The villain is unmasked, revealed to be the local tour guide trying to scare away tourists from discovering Emperor Chou's real hidden treasure—ancient fireworks formula.) VILLAIN: \\"And I would’ve gotten away with it too if it hadn’t been for you meddling kids and your inexplicable attraction to fortune-cookie adventures!\\" FRED: (with a cheesy grin) \\"Guess you could say your plan... fizzled out.\\" (The gang wraps up the adventure with Shaggy and Scooby enjoying their ground noodles, blissfully unaware of anything outside their hunger.) SHAGGY: \\"Like, Scoob, who cares about curses when you've got pasta?\\" SCOOBY: \\"Rea, rasta rover rurses!\\" (The gang walks off into the sunset, the Mystery Machine somehow parked atop the dragon statue turned python, with its tail serving as an impromptu bridge to the ground.) **THE END.**"},{"instruction":"Next comedic hilarious 17+ episode (the gang keep being aware of all the previous few mysteries they did before this one, they don’t even question the plot changes or the name changes (although the new changed names affect their personality based on the new names without them realising) except the villains, and just roll with the script: (do exactly EVERYTHING the plot says they do) Also every single character gets dialogue Shaggy and Scooby visit Ming's Chinese restaurant and open lottery cookies until they open one that says they won a trip to China.

Считал, что трудно отделить эти языки один от другого, хо­ тя при этом с уверенностью отмечая и их отличие, И. И. Срезневский приходит к убедительному выводу: нельзя создавать словарь только народного русского языка, а отсюда и заключение, что исследованию и лексикографическому описанию подлежит язык русской книжности — некая совокупность ее источников. Следовательно, должны быть учте­ ны и описаны все слова, которые присутствуют в известных на Руси памятниках. 3J Вескость этого научного решения сохраняет силу и в наши дниЛ' 37 Выступление на первом археологическом съезде. В качестве названия задуманно­ го труда первоначально предполагались: Словарь народного и церковного языка, Словарь книжного и народного языка по древним памятникам русского письма. 38 Материалы для словаря древнерусского языка напечатаны в трех томах: т. I, 1893; т. II, 1902; т. III с дополнениями, 1912. 39 Ср. и в статье Срезневского, посвященной публикации второго академического словаря: «Словарь для общего употребления, словарь литературный и словарь филологический — три дроби одной и той же единицы, дополняющие себя взаим­ но». (Срезневский И. И. Словарь церковнославянского и русского языка... С. 63). /После смерти И. И. Срезневского Словарь был издан с названием «Материалы для словаря древнерусского языка»/?? Но и в таком ви­ де, лишь отчасти воплощающем авторский замысел, со всей очевид­ ностью проявилась значительность результатов, достигнутых много­ летним трудом. Слова в «Материалах...» размещены по алфавиту, но описание лексики следует принципу историзма, что проявилось в выде­ лении и порядке смысловых рубрик, в хронологии размещения цитат, в типе истолкований, в соотнесении вариантов лексем, в грамматиче­ ских указаниях, в соотнесении с иноязычным эквивалентом и учете этимологий. Обилие памятников, из которых сделана выборка, и их стилистическое разнообразие, огромное число выдержек из тщательно обследованных текстов, точная документация цитат дают возможность проследить процессы не только древнерусского, но в известной мере и среднерусского периода развития языка. Итак, проблемы, поднятые в Академическом словаре 1847 г., заду­ манном как сокровищница языка, продолжали разрабатываться, углу­ бляя в основном его историческую перспективу (дополняя в этом аспек­ те и его состав). Однако и тип системного, нормативного описания язы­ ка, представленный в первом Академическом словаре, в Словаре Ака­ демии Российской 1789-1794 гг. (и его азбучном варианте 1806-1822 гг.) — лишь временно (и ненадолго) был оттеснен на второй план. По­ требность в решении названной научной задачи была вполне ощутима и в период выхода в свет Словаря 1847 г., вызывая, как упоминалось, критику этого издания и настойчивые требования осуществить соста­ вление словаря современного литературного языка.373839 Нормативность в известной мере была соблюдена и в Словаре 1847 г. (правила отбора слов и значений, проявленные по отношению к лексике областной, спе­ циальной и иноязычной). Однако вклад словаря в развитие норматив­ ных установок был намного значительней, чем ограничения в словнике: Три периода истории русской лексикографии 17 проявился он в последовательной и разносторонней отработке характе­ ристик словаря филологического. Принципы филологического описания материалов (в отличие от энциклопедического) — непременное усло­ вие нормативных квалификаций (смысловое и стилистическое соотне­ сения данной лексемы с другими лексемами языка,) учет их вариантов и словообразовательных связей, регулярность грамматических указа­ ний; все это при лаконизме и логичности формулировок словесного зна­ чения с устранением энциклопедических подробностей). Достижения академического словаря 1847 г. под ред. академика А. X. Востокова в названом аспекте отчетливо видны при сопоставлении со статьями Словаря Академии Российской. Работа по созданию принципов описания лексики в филологических словарях была продолжена и доведена до высокой степени совершен­ ства, когда Академия вновь приступила к задаче составления слова­ ря, отражающего современное состояние языка. Но к этому периоду система русского языка уже полностью отчленилась от языка церков­ нославянского, изменилась языковая ситуация, изменилось и языковое сознание. К концу столетия, по словам Л. В.

X. Vostokov编辑的学术词典在这一方面的成就，在与俄罗斯学院词典的条目进行比较时显而易见。 在制定语言学词典中词汇描述原则的工作被继续并达到了高度的完善，当学院再次开始制定反映语言当前状态的词典时。但到了这一时期，俄语系统已完全与教会斯拉夫语分离，语言情况发生了变化，语言意识也发生了变化。到了世纪末，据L. V. Shcherba所说，对教会斯拉夫文本的熟练阅读完全消失了。新的（第三个）学院作品，按类型是规范的，是自Lomonosov以来形成的俄语文学语言的词典。在“关于词典学总理论的试验”中发展了自己关于阅读文学基金变化的思想，L. V. Shcherba注意到：“实际上，我们所有这些现在的老一代人——如果不是总是非常热情地——读过Lomonosov, Derzhavin, 和 Karamzin”。"},{"instruction":"润色一下这一段","output":"在编撰古俄时期词典的过程中，俄语与教会斯拉夫语之间的关系成为了一个极其复杂的议题。尽管伊万·伊万诺维奇·斯雷兹涅夫斯基认知到这两种语言之间难以分明划分的同时，也明确指出了它们之间的差异。他得出了一个引人注目的结论：仅仅基于俄罗斯民间语言来编撰一个词典是不够的。由此，斯雷兹涅夫斯基认为应当研究并进行词典学描述的是俄罗斯文学语言及其文献的集合体。因此，所有出现在俄罗斯已知古迹中的词汇都必须被记录和详细描述。斯雷兹涅夫斯基的这个科学决策至今仍保持着其价值和重要性。 在第一次考古大会上发表的演讲中，初步考虑的标题是《民族语言与教会语言词典》和《文学与民族语言词典：基于俄罗斯古代文献》。 《古俄语词汇材料》分三卷出版：第一卷于1893年出版，第二卷在1902年，而带有补充的第三卷则在1912年出版。 参见斯雷兹涅夫斯基的一篇专题文章，讨论了第二本学术词典的发表：“普通用途词典、文学词典和语言学词典——这三者是同一整体的三个组成部分，彼此相互补充。”(斯雷兹涅夫斯基伊·伊，《教会斯拉夫语和俄语词典》，第63页)。 斯雷兹涅夫斯基去世后，以《古俄语词汇材料》为名的词典得以出版。尽管只是部分体现了作者的构思，但通过多年的努力，取得的显著成果无疑展现了其重要性。在《材料...》中，单词按字母顺序排列，但词汇的描述遵循了历史原则，这在意义分类的确定、引文的时间排序、解释的方式、词形变体的对比、语法提示、与其他语言词汇的对应及词源考察等方面均得以体现。所选文献的丰富性和它们的文体多样性，以及从精心审查的文本中摘录的大量引文，精准的引用记录，使人能够追溯不仅是古俄语，而且在一定程度上是中古俄语时期语言的发展过程。 因此，1847年学术词典中提出的问题，作为语言宝藏的构思得以继续深化，主要是通过增强其历史维度（在这方面丰富了其内容）。然而，第一本学术词典中提出的系统性、规范性语言描述类型，如1789-1794年俄罗斯学院词典（及其1806-1822年的字母排序版本）所展示的，仅在短时间内被暂时置于一个较次要的位置。在1847年词典问世时，对这一科学任务的需求显而易见，正如之前所提及的，这激起了对该版本的批评和对编撰现代文学语言词典的迫切需求。在某种程度上，1847年的词典也保持了规范性（在对区域性、专业性和外来词选择及其意义的说明上），但该词典对规范准则的贡献远远超出了词典本身的限制：这体现在对语言学词典特性的持续和全面加工上。语言学材料描述的原则（相对于百科全书式的描述）——必须考虑该词汇与语言中其他词汇之间的语义和风格关系、它们的变形和构词关系、语法提示的规律性；所有这些都在词义表述的简洁和逻辑中得以体现，避免了百科全书式的详述。1847年由学术家A. X. Vostokov编辑的学术词典在这个方面的成就，在与俄罗斯学院词典的条目进行比较时显而易见。 在制定语言学词典中的词汇描述原则方面的工作得以持续并达到了一个较高的完善程度，当学院再次致力于编撰一个反映语言当前状态的词典时，但到了这一时期，俄语系统已与教会斯拉夫语完全分离，语言环境和语言意识也发生了变化。到了世纪末，正如L. V.

Более того, шахматов- ский период русской академической лексикографии нередко признается ее вершиной. Речь идет не о борьбе мнений: оба положения каким-то 18 Русская лексикография не совсем понятным образом сосуществуют, они ужились.44 Разгадка, видимо, заключается в том, что замысел А. А. Шахматова обращен к будущему, ходом развития науки набирает динамическую силу. В шахматовских выпусках дана модель описания языка русской нации (в отношении его словарного состава). Научная концепция, на основе ко­ торой разработана эта модель построена на обширных и убедительных материалах. Фонд слов русского литературного языка, «языка русско­ го просвещения», как он писал, занял в этом труде подобающее место, учтены в ряде случаев даже единичные употребления, среди других представлены и церковнославянские слова, если их применяют русские церковные писатели или если они встречаются в русском переводе Пи­ сания (чего не делалось в первом томе, редактированном Я. К. Гротом). В Словарь введено огромное число народных слов, причем областные значения слов, где это возможно, соотнесены с литературными. «Науч­ ные и технические термины включены в объеме еще не бывалом и им даны точные логические определения, принятые в той или иной отра­ сли науки и техники, к основным русским словам приведены параллели из других славянских языков. Где это возможно, даны научные эти­ мологии. Обширная документация значений состоит из литературных цитат, фольклорных и диалектологических записей.

В основе языка нации, как полагает А. А. Шахматов, лежит «живой язык». В письме к Ф. Ф. Фортунатову 2 ноября 1895 г.46 и в записке, которую Шахматов прочел в Отделении о программе словаря 16 ноября того же года, сказано, что «для академического словаря есть два пу­ ти: первый из них — признать источником словаря письменный язык, второй — признать язык писателей лишь подспорьем при определении значений слов и их употребления, а источником словаря сделать живой русский язык; при этом задачей словаря является объяснение всех и всяких известных Второму отделению русских слов».47 Итак, по Шахматову, в основу описания языка нации должен быть положен живой язык, но вместе с тем он убежден, что русский язык представляет собой синтез языка народного и письменного: «До сих пор можно с письменным языком обойти всю Великую Россию и Сибирь и всюду быть понятным народом; и до сих пор архангелогородец, и курянин, не зная письменного языка, могут обойтись со своим наречием как в столицах, так и во всяком захолустье...»48 Три периода истории русской лексикографии 19 Вполне понятно, что при таких взглядах на язык, словарь, соста­ вленный В. И. Далем, получил безоговорочное признание А. А. Шахма­ това. В оценке им этого словаря не только знак крутого поворота акаде­ мической лексикографии (достаточно вспомнить полемику В. И. Даля с редакцией Словаря 1847 г., возглавляемой А. X. Востоковым).49 В этой оценке выражена суть замысла словарного предприятия самого А. А. Шахматова: в словаре Даля смешаны два языка — язык пись­ менный и живой язык современных «великорусских» говоров. 4ЭСм. об этом. Ковтун Л. С. Основная идея шахматовской лексикографии. С. 64. 50 В. И.

Ценность словаря Даля не в том, что он повторил за другими сло­ варями, которые, как сказано в его «Напутном слове», «набирались из книг»,50 а в том, что он добавил к ним десятки тысяч слов из уст­ ного народного языка. В. И. Даль счел нужным особо отметить, что девять десятых собранной им лексики — «простые обиходные слова», а не какие-нибудь «неслыханные выражения». Словарь стал сокровищ­ ницей русского живого слова. Переходя от гротовского нормативного словаря к словарю совсем другого типа — thesaurus — А. А. Шахмато­ ву было важно подчеркнуть это доверие В. И. Даля к народной речи, к разговорному языку. Тем самым подчеркнута связь между разными ча­ стями языка русской нации и отмечено воздействие народных говоров на литературный язык, указано на характерный и для нашего времени процесс отработки в литературном языке слов. Нельзя забывать, что крупнейшие писатели XIX в. активно стремились сблизить литератур­ ный язык с народным. Итак, Словарь А. А. Шахматова— это словарь языка русской нации в его единстве и сложности. Принято считать его едва ли не уникаль­ ной в истории лексикографии попыткой создать thesaurus,51 но это как мы уже видели, не так. Идея создания словарной сокровищницы была как нельзя более органичной для наших первых историков-славистов А. X. Востокова и И. И. Срезневского. Старший из них реализовал ее не в одном труде, а в их комплексе, системе. В академическом слова­ ре церковнославянского и русского языка 1847 г., в сочетании с двумя дифференциальными областными словарями (с ориентацией на выше­ названный труд). Концепция А. X. Востокова (создать систему слова­ рей) нашла своих преемников, реализуясь в дальнейшей деятельности Академии наук. На современном этапе она получила общее признание. Преобразованная, не без активного воздействия гротовских норматив­ ных тенденций, но в еще большей степени шахматовских импульсов, противостоящих жесткой нормализации, направленных к описанию и пограничных явлений, она нашла свое вторичное воплощение в созда­ нии Большого академического словаря52 (а вслед за завершением его 20 Русская лексикография и в интенсивных работах по созданию исторических словарей, по те­ ме «Новое в русской лексике»),53 с параллельным изданием (с 1965 г.) «Свободного словаря русских народных говоров».54 53 Словари «Новые слова и значения» (1971 и 1984), ежегодники (Новое в русской лексике, 1980, 1981, 1982 и след.) Эти издания представляли исследователям большие материалы, давая возможность изучать живые процессы, наблюдаемые по текстам прессы и периодики. 54 Видный сербский лексикограф Митар Пешикан, гостивший в Ленинграде в 1969 г., на вопрос, удовлетворяет ли его Большой Академический словарь, отве­ тил, что ценность его как словаря современного русского языка будет возрастать по мере издания « Сводного словаря русских народных говоров».

С. 417. 57 План нового академического словаря с точки зрения иноязычного. Записка И. X Пахмана. СПб., 1899. С. 9, 10. В «Очерке общей теории лексикографии» Л. В. Щербы Словарь Шахматова нашел место в двух противоположениях: а) thesaurus — обычный (толковый или переводный) словарь; б) словарь академиче­ ского типа — словарь-справочник. Раскрывая смысл первой оппози­ ции, автор отмечает, что обычный словарь дает лишь правила (ина­ че: значения слова с иллюстрациями, подтверждающими толкования), словарь thesarus — весь языковой материал и «до известной степени» предоставляет читателю самому выводить из него значения.5556Очевид­ но, что последнее положение не может быть отнесено к шахматовскому Словарю: его отличает стремление к детальной разработке семанти­ ки на базе материала, способного отразить реальное состояние языка. Это качество в свое время (середина XX века) отметила Е. С. Истрина: «Словарные материалы так вдумчиво и тщательно собиравшиеся Шах­ матовым, явились основанием «Словарной картотеки» Академии наук, которая насчитывает уже несколько миллионов карточек, непрерывно расширяется и служит богатым источником современной лексикогра­ фии».55 Такова лексическая база словаря. «Широкая картина значений и оттенков слова, прямых и переносных, широкая картина употребле­ ния слов, оборотов, выражений, продуманная система грамматической характеристики слова и общие строго научные установки «редакции Шахматова»...» — таков уровень анализа слов в словаре. Заметим, что оценка разработки семантики в выпусках II тома, третьего академи­ ческого Словаря русского языка, данная Е. С. Истриной, известным советским лексикографом и ученицей А. А. Шахматова, не расходится с мнением придирчивого критика «шахматовской» редакции И. X. Пах- мана: «Никто, конечно, не станет порицать редакцию нового академи­ ческого Словаря, — пишет он, — за ее заботу всесторонне разрабаты­ вать каждое слово, доискиваться всевозможных оттенков его значения, приводить все встречаемые в литературе применения».57 Шахматов и его сотрудники, не оставляли, как видим, «языковой материал» сырым, но, прежде чем подвергнуть его анализу и систе­ матизации, они добивались фундаментальности той базы, на которой Три периода истории русской лексикографии 21 будут строиться обобщения. Это внимание к языковому материалу оце­ нил Л. В. Щерба, видя в нем попытку изучения речетворчества в обла­ сти словоупотребления. Отметим, что шахматовский словарь, видимо, и составлялся под знаком этих идей. Академик Щерба дает ему харак­ теристику: «Он, конечно, не должен был быть настоящим thesaurus’oM, но максимум цитат был его основным принципом, а поскольку дело шло об «областном языке», постольку абсолютно все имевшиеся материалы обязательно входили в его ткань».58 Особое значение им придавалось, надо думать, не в связи с их местными особенностями, а в связи с тем, что в них представлена разговорная речь с ее ярко выраженным наци­ ональным характером. 58 Щерба Л. В. Опыт общей теории лексикографии. С. 74. 59 В предисловии ко II тому отмечена относительность достигнутых результатов. 60 Сам этот термин («словарь-справочник» — недостаточно отчетлив. См. об этом: Фельдман Н. И. О специфике небольших двуязычных словарей. № 2. 1952. С. 13. 61 Щерба Л. В. Опыт обшей теории лексикографии. С. 55. 62 Ларин Б. А. Историческая диалектология русского языка в курсе лекций акад. Шахматова и наши современные задачи // Сб. «Очерки истории языка». Л., 1960. С. 5. Нельзя не согласиться с тем, что полноту материалов А. А. Шахма­ тов ценил превыше всего и предела в этом отношении не ставил. Ши­ рота документации словоупотребления — характерный признак «шах­ матовской редакции».59 В другом противоположении Л. В. Щербы шахматовский труд упо­ мянут в качестве типичного примера словаря-справочника, где описаны слова, которые могут принадлежать разным коллективам, относиться к разным эпохам и «вовсе не образуют какой-либо системы». Уже упо­ миналось, что в основе подобных словарей, как полагает автор, в наше время лежит идея нации.60 Действительно, словарь А. А. Шахматова — это как уже не одна­ жды сказано, словарь языка русской нации, но эпохи вполне определен­ ной (нижний предел — язык времени Ломоносова); лексика, собранная в нем, не есть некий конгломерат, соединение разнородных материа­ лов. И если признаком академического словаря считать системность, как это предлагает Л. В. Щерба,61 она может быть присуща и словарю языка нации. Цель словаря литературного языка нормативного типа — описание отношений словарного фонда литературного языка. Однако при всей значительности роли этого языка как языка общенациональ­ ного он не автономен, ибо сам входит в систему более сложного порядка (систему систем), которая покрывается понятием языка нации.62 Идея синтеза отдельных частей современного языка русской нации не может вместе с тем не стать жизненно необходимой русистике, осо­ бенно теперь, когда осознано значение исследований разговорной речи. Проблемы соотнесенности этноязыка и литературного языка, пробле­ мы социальной обусловленности развития литературной разговорной речи, ее отношения к просторечию и диалектам (при современном со­ 22 Русская лексикография стоянии и в генетическом плане) занимают теперь видное место в про­ блематике русистики и общего языкознания. Словарь А. А. Шахматова не раз подвергался критике. Указыва­ лось, что совмещение областных и литературных слов и значений «... не могло не отразиться на стилистической перспективе словаря, силь­ но ее затемняя и спутывая».63 Отмечалось, что объединение неодно­ типных материалов отразилось и на истолковании слов: «невозможно было уловить смысловые особенности областного слова с такой же точ­ ностью, как и литературного».64 И это понятно: значения областных слов менее отработаны или, что то же, более диффузны. Несомненно и то, что всякое объединение ведет к потерям, к утрате чего-то специ­ фического. На современном этапе анализа и теоретических обобщений осознано, что науке о русском языке необходим не один словарь, напо­ добие «шахматовской редакции», а комплекс словарей, синтезирующих показания письменных и устных источников. 63 Виноградов В. В. Толковые словари русского языка. С. 385. 64 Там же. С. 386. Такая система словарей, как мы видели, вдумчиво отрабатывалась на протяжении всего XIX века и в последующие годы XX века. В на­ стоящее время она имеет три взаимно связанных направления: слова­ ри современного языка литературного, исторические словари и слова­ ри областные, но разветвления каждого из них весьма разнообразны по своему диапазону и назначению. Словари современного языка ли­ тературного, представляя нормативное направление, сосредоточены на проблеме описания словарного состава общелитературного языка. Но впереди остается еще описание более широкой категории, — слов языка литературного, во всех его функциональных стилях и прежде всего язы­ ка, занимающего столь существенное место в современной культуре, а именно языка науки с его сложными градациями по специальностям и сленговыми ответвлениями в каждой из них, языка художественной литературы и публицистики, а также обиходных средств бытового об­ щения (разговорной речи и просторечия). 翻译成汉语","output":"在评估阿列克谢·阿列克谢耶维奇·沙赫马托夫版本的学术词典时，一方面，人们不断强调其构想的不可实现性（尝试为活生生的语言创建一个词库的不现实性），另一方面，高度评价了提出的语言描述原则的科学潜力。更何况，沙赫马托夫领导下的俄罗斯学术词典学期常被认为是其顶峰。这不是意见的对立：两种立场在某种程度上和谐共存。秘诀似乎在于，沙赫马托夫的构想是面向未来的，随着科学的发展而积累动态力量。在沙赫马托夫版本中，呈现了一种描述俄罗斯民族语言（就其词汇结构而言）的模型。这个模型建立在广泛而有力的材料基础上。俄罗斯文学语言的词汇库，“俄罗斯教育的语言”如他所写，占据了其应有的位置，在某些情况下甚至考虑了个别用法，包括那些被俄罗斯教堂作家使用或出现在俄语圣经翻译中的教会斯拉夫语词汇（这在雅各布·卡尔洛维奇·格罗特编辑的第一卷中未曾做到）。词典中引入了大量民间词汇，其中地区词义在可能的情况下与文学意义相联系。“科学和技术术语被包含在前所未有的范围内，并且被赋予了在某些科学和技术领域中接受的精确逻辑定义，对于主要的俄语单词，给出了来自其他斯拉夫语言的对照。在可能的情况下，给出了科学词源。丰富的意义文献资料包括文学引文、民间文化和方言学记录。在材料允许的情况下，引文的选择展示了意义发展的历史。” 沙赫马托夫的词典被认为是一次尝试为活生生的语言创建词库，但我们已经看到，这并非如此。创建一个词汇宝库的想法对于我们的第一代历史学家-斯拉夫学家，如亚历山大·希普利奥诺维奇·沃斯托科夫和伊万·伊万诺维奇·斯雷兹涅夫斯基来说，是再自然不过的了。前者不是通过一个作品，而是通过一系列相互关联的作品实现了这一构想。沃斯托科夫的概念（创建一个词典系统）找到了继承者，通过科学院的进一步活动得以实现。在当前阶段，这一理念已经获得了普遍认可。经过格罗特的规范化倾向和沙赫马托夫反对严格规范化、旨在描述语言边缘现象的推动作用的改造，这一理念在创建大型学术词典中找到了新的体现，紧接着是关于“俄罗斯语言新词”的历史词典的积极工作，以及与此同时出版的“俄罗斯民间方言自由词典”。 因此，沙赫马托夫的词典不仅是对俄罗斯民族语言的描述，而且还准确地定义了一个特定时代（最早期限是洛蒙诺索夫时代的语言）的语言。在词典中收集的词汇并不是一种杂糅的混合物，而是有机结合的多样材料。如果我们认为学术词典的特点是系统性，如格罗特所提议的那样，那么这种系统性也可以适用于民族语言的词典。文学语言词典的目标是描述文学语言词汇库的关系。然而，尽管这种语言作为全国性语言的角色非常重要，但它并不是自足的，因为它本身就是更复杂秩序体系（系统的系统）的一部分，这一体系被覆盖在“民族语言”的概念之下。"},{"instruction":"В основе языка нации, как полагает А.

Fortunatov的信件中，以及在同年11月16日他在部门会议上就词典计划宣读的备忘录中，曾提到，“对于学术词典存在两条路径：其一，承认词典的来源是书面语言；其二，仅将作家的语言看作确定词义和用法时的辅助，而将活的俄语作为词典的来源；于是，词典的任务是解释所有和任何已知的俄罗斯词汇”。因此，根据沙赫马托夫的观点，民族语言的描述应基于活语言，但同时他坚信俄罗斯语言是民间语言和书面语言的综合体：“至今，人们仍可以用书面语言游遍整个大俄罗斯和西伯利亚，并在任何地方被人民理解；至今，来自阿尔汉格尔或库尔斯克的人，即使不了解书面语言，也可以用自己的方言在首都和任何偏僻之地自如交流…” 完全可以理解，基于此种对语言的看法，由V. I. Dal编纂的词典获得了沙赫马托夫的无条件认可。在他对这部词典的评估中，不仅标志着学术词典学的重大转折（值得回忆V. I. Dal与由A. Kh. Vostokov领导的1847年词典编辑部的争论）。这一评估表达了沙赫马托夫自己的词典项目构想的实质：在Dal的词典中，书面语和当代“大俄罗斯”方言的活语言被混合在一起。Dal的词典的价值不在于它复制了其他词典所做的，那些词典，“如他在‘前言’中所言，‘是从书本中搜集而来的’”，而在于它增添了成千上万个来自口头民间语言的词汇。V. I. Dal认为有必要特别指出，他收集的词汇中有九成是“简单的日常用词”，而不是一些“闻所未闻的表达”。这部词典成为了俄罗斯活生生的言语的宝库。从格罗特编辑的规范词典过渡到一种完全不同类型的词典——thesaurus，沙赫马托夫强调了V. I. Dal对民间言语、对口语的信任之重要。从而强调了俄罗斯民族语言不同部分之间的联系，并指出民间方言对文学语言的影响，标注了一个对我们这个时代同样典型的过程：大作家们在文学语言中加工使用词汇。不应忘记，19世纪的杰出作家们积极尝试将文学语言与民间语言靠拢。"},{"instruction":"Ценность словаря Даля не в том, что он повторил за другими сло­ варями, которые, как сказано в его «Напутном слове», «набирались из книг»,50 а в том, что он добавил к ним десятки тысяч слов из уст­ ного народного языка.

Нельзя забывать, что крупнейшие писатели XIX в. активно стремились сблизить литератур­ ный язык с народным. Итак, Словарь А. А. Шахматова— это словарь языка русской нации в его единстве и сложности. Принято считать его едва ли не уникаль­ ной в истории лексикографии попыткой создать thesaurus,51 но это как мы уже видели, не так. Идея создания словарной сокровищницы была как нельзя более органичной для наших первых историков-славистов А. X. Востокова и И. И. Срезневского. Старший из них реализовал ее не в одном труде, а в их комплексе, системе. В академическом слова­ ре церковнославянского и русского языка 1847 г., в сочетании с двумя дифференциальными областными словарями (с ориентацией на выше­ названный труд). Концепция А. X. Востокова (создать систему слова­ рей) нашла своих преемников, реализуясь в дальнейшей деятельности Академии наук. На современном этапе она получила общее признание. Преобразованная, не без активного воздействия гротовских норматив­ ных тенденций, но в еще большей степени шахматовских импульсов, противостоящих жесткой нормализации, направленных к описанию и пограничных явлений, она нашла свое вторичное воплощение в созда­ нии Большого академического словаря52 (а вслед за завершением его 20 Русская лексикография и в интенсивных работах по созданию исторических словарей, по те­ ме «Новое в русской лексике»),53 с параллельным изданием (с 1965 г.) «Свободного словаря русских народных говоров».54 53 Словари «Новые слова и значения» (1971 и 1984), ежегодники (Новое в русской лексике, 1980, 1981, 1982 и след.) Эти издания представляли исследователям большие материалы, давая возможность изучать живые процессы, наблюдаемые по текстам прессы и периодики. 54 Видный сербский лексикограф Митар Пешикан, гостивший в Ленинграде в 1969 г., на вопрос, удовлетворяет ли его Большой Академический словарь, отве­ тил, что ценность его как словаря современного русского языка будет возрастать по мере издания « Сводного словаря русских народных говоров».

С. 417. 57 План нового академического словаря с точки зрения иноязычного. Записка И. X Пахмана. СПб., 1899. С. 9, 10. В «Очерке общей теории лексикографии» Л. В. Щербы Словарь Шахматова нашел место в двух противоположениях: а) thesaurus — обычный (толковый или переводный) словарь; б) словарь академиче­ ского типа — словарь-справочник. Раскрывая смысл первой оппози­ ции, автор отмечает, что обычный словарь дает лишь правила (ина­ че: значения слова с иллюстрациями, подтверждающими толкования), словарь thesarus — весь языковой материал и «до известной степени» предоставляет читателю самому выводить из него значения.5556Очевид­ но, что последнее положение не может быть отнесено к шахматовскому Словарю: его отличает стремление к детальной разработке семанти­ ки на базе материала, способного отразить реальное состояние языка. Это качество в свое время (середина XX века) отметила Е. С. Истрина: «Словарные материалы так вдумчиво и тщательно собиравшиеся Шах­ матовым, явились основанием «Словарной картотеки» Академии наук, которая насчитывает уже несколько миллионов карточек, непрерывно расширяется и служит богатым источником современной лексикогра­ фии».55 Такова лексическая база словаря. «Широкая картина значений и оттенков слова, прямых и переносных, широкая картина употребле­ ния слов, оборотов, выражений, продуманная система грамматической характеристики слова и общие строго научные установки «редакции Шахматова»...» — таков уровень анализа слов в словаре. Заметим, что оценка разработки семантики в выпусках II тома, третьего академи­ ческого Словаря русского языка, данная Е. С. Истриной, известным советским лексикографом и ученицей А. А. Шахматова, не расходится с мнением придирчивого критика «шахматовской» редакции И. X. Пах- мана: «Никто, конечно, не станет порицать редакцию нового академи­ ческого Словаря, — пишет он, — за ее заботу всесторонне разрабаты­ вать каждое слово, доискиваться всевозможных оттенков его значения, приводить все встречаемые в литературе применения».57翻译成汉语","output":"达尔词典的价值，并不在于它重复了其他词典的内容，这些词典，如达尔在其“前言”中所述，“是从书籍中收集来的”；而是在于它增添了成千上万个口头民间语言的词汇。V. I. 达尔特别指出，他收集的词汇中有九成是“简单的日常用语”，而非某些“闻所未闻的表达”。词典成为了俄罗斯活生生话语的宝库。从格罗特编辑的规范词典转向一种完全不同类型的词典——词库(thesaurus)——对沙赫马托夫来说，强调V. I. 达尔对民间言语、对话语的信赖非常重要。这样做强调了俄罗斯民族语言不同部分之间的联系，并指出民间方言对文学语言的影响，标明了一个对我们这个时代同样典型的过程：大作家们努力将文学语言与民间语言拉近。沙赫马托夫的词典——是对俄罗斯民族语言在其统一性和复杂性中的描述。这被认为是历史上独一无二的尝试，以创建一个词库，但这并非如此。为我们的第一代历史学家-斯拉夫学家A. X. Востоков和I. I. Срезневски创建词汇宝库的想法是极其自然的。前者没有通过单一作品而是通过复合系统来实现这一概念。沃斯托科夫的概念（创建一个词典系统）找到了其继承者，随后在科学院的活动中实现。在当代阶段，它获得了普遍认可。经过格罗特的规范倾向以及沙赫马托夫反对严格规范化、致力于描述边缘现象的推动下，这一概念在创建大型学术词典中找到了重新体现，并持续在“俄罗斯新词汇”主题的历史词典和并行出版的“俄罗斯民间方言自由词典”中进行密集工作。在《综合理论引论》中，沙赫马托夫的词典在两个对立点中找到了其位置：一是作为一个常规词典（解释性或翻译性）与词库；二是作为学术型词典与参考书。揭示第一个对立概念的含义时，作者指出，常规词典只提供规则（亦即带有证实解释的词语含义的例证），而词库则提供了所有的语言材料，并在“一定程度上”允许读者自行从中得出含义。很明显，这最后一点不能适用于沙赫马托夫的词典：它的特点是致力于基于能反映语言真实状态的材料来详细发展语义。И. X. Пахман作为“沙赫马托夫版本”挑剔的评论家，他写道：“当然，没有人会指责新学术词典的编辑，因为她们致力于全面开发每个词，寻找所有可能的含义阴影，列出所有在文学中遇到的应用”。"},{"instruction":"Шахматов и его сотрудники, не оставляли, как видим, «языковой материал» сырым, но, прежде чем подвергнуть его анализу и систе­ матизации, они добивались фундаментальности той базы, на которой Три периода истории русской лексикографии 21 будут строиться обобщения. Это внимание к языковому материалу оце­ нил Л. В. Щерба, видя в нем попытку изучения речетворчества в обла­ сти словоупотребления. Отметим, что шахматовский словарь, видимо, и составлялся под знаком этих идей. Академик Щерба дает ему харак­ теристику: «Он, конечно, не должен был быть настоящим thesaurus’oM, но максимум цитат был его основным принципом, а поскольку дело шло об «областном языке», постольку абсолютно все имевшиеся материалы обязательно входили в его ткань».58 Особое значение им придавалось, надо думать, не в связи с их местными особенностями, а в связи с тем, что в них представлена разговорная речь с ее ярко выраженным наци­ ональным характером. 58 Щерба Л.

Историческая диалектология русского языка в курсе лекций акад. Шахматова и наши современные задачи // Сб. «Очерки истории языка». Л., 1960. С. 5. Нельзя не согласиться с тем, что полноту материалов А. А. Шахма­ тов ценил превыше всего и предела в этом отношении не ставил. Ши­ рота документации словоупотребления — характерный признак «шах­ матовской редакции».59 В другом противоположении Л. В. Щербы шахматовский труд упо­ мянут в качестве типичного примера словаря-справочника, где описаны слова, которые могут принадлежать разным коллективам, относиться к разным эпохам и «вовсе не образуют какой-либо системы». Уже упо­ миналось, что в основе подобных словарей, как полагает автор, в наше время лежит идея нации.60 Действительно, словарь А. А. Шахматова — это как уже не одна­ жды сказано, словарь языка русской нации, но эпохи вполне определен­ ной (нижний предел — язык времени Ломоносова); лексика, собранная в нем, не есть некий конгломерат, соединение разнородных материа­ лов. И если признаком академического словаря считать системность, как это предлагает Л. В. Щерба,61 она может быть присуща и словарю языка нации. Цель словаря литературного языка нормативного типа — описание отношений словарного фонда литературного языка. Однако при всей значительности роли этого языка как языка общенациональ­ ного он не автономен, ибо сам входит в систему более сложного порядка (систему систем), которая покрывается понятием языка нации.62 Идея синтеза отдельных частей современного языка русской нации не может вместе с тем не стать жизненно необходимой русистике, осо­ бенно теперь, когда осознано значение исследований разговорной речи. Проблемы соотнесенности этноязыка и литературного языка, пробле­ мы социальной обусловленности развития литературной разговорной речи, ее отношения к просторечию и диалектам (при современном со­ 22 Русская лексикография стоянии и в генетическом плане) занимают теперь видное место в про­ блематике русистики и общего языкознания. Словарь А. А. Шахматова не раз подвергался критике. Указыва­ лось, что совмещение областных и литературных слов и значений «... не могло не отразиться на стилистической перспективе словаря, силь­ но ее затемняя и спутывая».63 Отмечалось, что объединение неодно­ типных материалов отразилось и на истолковании слов: «невозможно было уловить смысловые особенности областного слова с такой же точ­ ностью, как и литературного».64 И это понятно: значения областных слов менее отработаны или, что то же, более диффузны. Несомненно и то, что всякое объединение ведет к потерям, к утрате чего-то специ­ фического. На современном этапе анализа и теоретических обобщений осознано, что науке о русском языке необходим не один словарь, напо­ добие «шахматовской редакции», а комплекс словарей, синтезирующих показания письменных и устных источников.翻译成汉语","output":"沙赫马托夫及其团队，并没有留下未经加工的“语言材料”，但在进行分析和系统化之前，他们确保了这些材料的基础是扎实的，为之后的综述打下了坚实的基础。Л. В. Щерба对此投以高度评价，他认为这是一种尝试，在用词上探究语言创造力。显然，沙赫马托夫的词典正是在这些思想指导下编纂的。Щерба给予它如下评述：“它当然不应该是一个真正的thesaurus，但引用尽可能多是它的主导原则，既然讨论的是‘地域语言’，那么所有现有的材料必然被纳入其结构。”这些材料被给予特殊重视，我们认为，不仅仅因为它们的地方特色，更是因为它们展现了具有鲜明民族特色的口语。 人们不得不同意，沙赫马托夫极为重视材料的完整性，并在这方面没有设定任何限制。文献记录的广泛性是“沙赫马托夫编辑版本”的一个显著特征。在Щерба的另一个对立观点中，沙赫马托夫的工作被视为典型的参考词典的例子，其中描述了可能属于不同群体、关联于不同时代的词语，“根本不构成任何系统”。已经提到，作者认为，类似这样的词典的基础在当前是民族的理念。 确实，正如之前多次提到的，沙赫马托夫的词典是俄罗斯民族语言的词典，但它确切地定义了特定时代（最低限度是从洛蒙诺索夫时代开始的语言）；其中收集的词汇并不是一个混合的集合，而是各种材料的有机结合。如果我们认为学术词典的标志是系统性，如Щерба所提议的，那么这种系统性也可以适用于民族语言的词典。文学语言词典的目标是描述文学语言词汇库的关系。然而，尽管文学语言作为全国性语言的角色非常重要，但它并非独立存在，因为它本身就是更复杂秩序系统（系统的系统）的一部分，这一系统被涵盖在“民族语言”的概念之下。对现代俄罗斯民族语言各个部分的综合思想，同时也成为俄罗斯语言学，特别是当意识到研究口语的重要性时的必要理念。民族语和文学语言的关系问题，文学口语发展的社会条件，其与俗语和方言的关系（在当前状态和从历史角度看）现在在俄罗斯语言学和一般语言学的问题中占据了显著位置。 沙赫马托夫的词典不止一次受到批评。其中指出，地区词汇和文学词汇及其意义的混合“……不可避免地影响了词典的风格展望，严重地使其变得模糊和混乱”。还指出，不同类型材料的合并也反映在词语的解释上：“不可能以与文学词汇同样的准确度捕捉到地区词汇的语义特征。”这是可以理解的：地区词汇的含义不那么成熟，或者说，更为分散。毫无疑问，任何形式的合并都会导致损失，失去一些特有的东西。在当前的分析和理论总结阶段，人们意识到俄罗斯语言学不仅需要一个类似“沙赫马托夫版本”的词典，而且需要一个综合书面和口头来源的词典集。"},{"instruction":"Такая система словарей, как мы видели, вдумчиво отрабатывалась на протяжении всего XIX века и в последующие годы XX века.

Оценивая роль символизма в культуре древней Руси и определяя пе­ риоды его расцвета и угасания, Д. С. Лихачев отмечает, что истоки средневекового символизма надо искать у греков (эллинистического пе­ риода), которые были склонны символически толковать свою мифоло­ гию. Что касается книжности средневековья, то она «была пронизана стремлением к символическому толкованию явлений природы, истории и Писания».4 «Вслед за символическим истолкованием Ветхого и Ново­ го заветов символизирующая мысль средневековья (и на Востоке Евро­ пы и на Западе) тем же путем истолковала и все явления природы».5 «Весь мир полон символов и каждое явление имеет двойной смысл».6 Символика церковных книг образует разветвленные смысловые пучки. Так, среди символов одной из библейских книг — Псалтыри (в славянском воспроизведении ее текста XII в.) — могут быть назва­ ны ряды слов: а) со значением водного пространства; б) обозначающие возвышенности; в) соотносимые по значению с темой света, огня, жа­ ра; г) называющие существ, обитателей земли и др. Символы развива­ ют друг друга. Например, слово земля имеет символическое значение ‘человек’ — земля «мысленая», или «разумная», «умная». Вера вспа­ хивает «мысленную землю», ее бразды — сердце, ум, душа. Символы многозначны. Гора — это и вера, и богородица, и церковь; то же слово обозначает и обилие людских грехов — «горы греховныя».7 翻译成汉语","output":"古代时期（10-17世纪） 东斯拉夫人的语言学（10-15世纪） 词与文本。词汇语义学。 中世纪对词的理解。 文本词典学。 受到对古俄文化产生多方面影响的拜占庭的宗父哲学，众所周知，将教会教义与古代哲学家，特别是柏拉图和亚里士多德的概念结合起来。 中世纪哲学观点的主要问题紧密关联于对词本质的理解。值得研究的不是各别事物，这些事物是感性的且变幻无常，而是事物中普遍和必要的。了解世界的来源不是实物，而是对它们的概念。按照这些观点，被宣称为认知对象的是词。 关于物质和理念这两个原则的核心问题的解决，在于承认“精神”的领导地位，而感官的（“外在的”）被视为派生于“精神”且依赖于“精神”的。并且认为，存在于一切事物中的，正是这两个原则得到了体现。 1. 属于字母表型词典的工作，结合了较早时期（11-15世纪）文本词典学特有的注释、以及16世纪抄写员——这些词典编纂者的个人观察。 文学来源中，据《词典》第二版所述，引用了格里高利圣言第8和第21“词”。 2. 一个16世纪中期的字母表型词典，根据俄罗斯国家图书馆的手稿（17世纪20年代），叶30和46背面，第47页。格里高利·纳齐安津（圣言者）（约329-约389），拜占庭作家，对基督教教义形成发挥了重要作用。 中世纪一切存在物的双重本质，按照中世纪的观念，也适用于词的语义：在“外在”的意义背后隐藏着另一个，更深层的意义。\\"根据感官，‘牧场’被解释为肥沃的土地，即长满植物、可被牲畜食用的地方；而从精神上来看，‘牧场’则被解释为圣洁的教堂，充满了生命之法的精神食粮\\"，我们在同一本词典中读到这样的解释。 文本的象征性解读变得至关重要。在评估古俄文化中象征主义的角色，以及确定其兴起和衰落的时期时，D. S. Likhachev指出，中世纪象征主义的起源应当在希腊人（希腊化时期）那里寻找，他们倾向于对自己的神话进行象征性解读。至于中世纪的书面作品，“它们被对自然现象、历史事件和经文进行象征性解读的愿望所贯穿”。\\"遵循对旧约和新约进行象征化解读的方式，中世纪的思想（无论在东欧还是在西欧）也以相同的方式解读了所有自然现象。\\"“整个世界充满了象征，每个现象都具有双重含义。” 教会书籍的象征构建了复杂的意义网络。例如，在译为斯拉夫语的《圣诗》（12世纪文本）这本圣经书籍中，可以发现诸如：a) 表示水域的词汇；b) 指称高地的词汇；c) 与光、火、热主题相关的词汇；d) 提及地上生灵等的词汇。象征相互发展。比如“土地”这个词具有象征意义“人”——被思考的“土地”，或“有理智的”、“有智慧的”。信仰耕种着“有思想的土地”，其犁沟——心灵、智慧、灵魂。象征具有多重意义。山既是信仰，又是圣母，也是教堂；同一个词还表示人类罪恶的丰富——“罪恶之山”。"},{"instruction":"润色一下","output":"古代时期（10-17世纪） 在东斯拉夫人的10-15世纪的语言学领域，词与文本、词汇语义学以及中世纪对词的理解和文本词典学都是其主要研究内容。拜占庭的父权哲学，这一对古俄文化产生广泛影响的思潮，融合了教会教义和古代哲学家的思想，尤其是柏拉图和亚里士多德。 中世纪哲学观点主要围绕着对词本质的理解展开。研究的不应是易变的、具体的事物，而是事物中普遍存在的和必要的理念。认识世界的途径不是通过实体，而是通过对它们的观念。由此，词成为了认知的对象。 物质与理念这两个基本原则的辩证，在于承认“精神”的优先，将感官经验（“外在的”）视为源自并受“精神”影响的派生物。认为，所有存在的事物均表现出这两个原则。 词典工作，特别是属于字母书类型的，融合了更早时期（11-15世纪）文本词典学的注解和16世纪编纂者的个人观察。 在这一历史阶段，对于所有存在的事物的双重本质，同样适用于词的语义：表面的意义之下隐藏着更深层的、秘密的意义。例如，在词典中我们可以读到，从感官的角度来看，“牧场”被解释为丰饶之地，长满了植物、适合牲畜食用的地方；而从精神的角度来看，“牧场”则被理解为充满了生命之法的精神滋养的圣教堂。 文本的象征性解读在当时尤为重要。当评估象征主义在古俄文化中的作用，以及确定其兴盛和衰退的时期时，D.

Likhachev指出，中世纪象征主义的根源应追溯至希腊（希腊化时期）——一直倾向于象征性解读其神话的文化。至于中世纪的文献，它们 pervaded by a desire to symbolically interpret natural phenomena, history, and the Scriptures. 他进一步指出，沿着象征性解读旧约和新约的路径，中世纪的思维（无论在东欧还是在西欧）也以同样的方式解读了所有自然现象。“整个世界都充满了象征，每一个现象都带有双重含义。” 教会书籍中的象征形成了错综复杂的意义网络。例如，在《诗篇》（12世纪斯拉夫语文本）这本圣经书中，可以识别出多个象征，例如代表水域、高地、关联到光、火、热的主题，以及指代地上生灵的词汇。这些象征相互发展，相互补充。比方说，“土地”这一词语就拥有象征意义——代表“人”，指的是被思考的“土地”，或是“理性的”、“聪明的”土地。信仰耕作这些“理性的土地”，其犁沟——心灵、智慧、灵魂。象征具有多重含义，例如“山”既可以表示信仰、圣母、教堂，也能象征人类罪恶的堆积——“罪恶之山”。"},{"instruction":"Наблюдается синонимия символики: наличие разных (иногда мно­ гих) наименований для обозначения одного и того же предмета или явления. Символами крещения оказываются слова: море, река, вода; Языкознание у восточных славян в Х-ХѴ вв. 25 апостолов — холмы и столпы (ср. пророки — горы).8 Такие симво­ лические ряды состоят из слов, соотносимых по смыслу, но имеющих и свои отличия, которые дают основания для вариаций истолкований. Если апостолы названы холмами, «яко вышьше земьнаго жития» (пс. 71), то для символа столпы приводится другое основание: «суть же нераздрушими» (пс. 74). Вместе с тем при условности выбора симво­ ла таковыми выступают и слова различных значений: апостолы — не только холмы и столпы, но и облака (облаци),9 а этот последний сим­ вол в свою очередь означает «телеса просвещаемых», входя тем самым в ряд символов крещения. 8 Популярное на Руси Слово на рождество богородицы Андрея Критского приво­ дит семьдесят четыре символа богоматери. (Лихачев Д. С. Поэтика... С. 162). 9 Устойчивость последнего символа особо подчеркнута истолкователем: «облакы бо кънигы апостоли глаголють присно». 10 Подробнее о символике и других образных средствах в тексте Толстовской псал­ тыри XII в. в кн.: Ковтун Л.

Статья на сл. ефиопи на с. 281. 12 В XVII веке, когда религиозный символизм все более уступал место реалисти­ ческим типам образности, применение второго символа стало вызывать отпор Особенно богат и разнороден в Псалтыри пучок символических и эвфемистических именований дьявола и бесов. Дьявол — чаша вина растворена, пес, лев, змеи (аспид и василиск), а также грешный, зако­ нопреступный, клеветник, сильный; бесы — змеи, кони, враги. Характерно попавшее затем и в старинные словари рассуждение ис­ толкователя псалмов по поводу черноты дьявола («и бысть, яко главь- ня истрьжена от огня, еже есть от горения древо»). Признак, ставший поводом для наименования его и бесов эфиопами и муринами.10 Условность символа обнаруживает себя особенно явно, когда у од­ ного и того же слова оказываются предельно несходные символические смыслы. Примером может служить словарное описание лексемы «эфи­ опы», которое неожиданно, в новом аспекте, развивает тему воздей­ ствия пламени, огня: «ефиопит смирени, наричет же писание и бесов аравлянами, и ефиопами, и муринами, черны бо акы главня угашена..» Следует пояснение выбора подобных наименований, основанных на ре­ альном признаке: «того ради предреченными имены нарицаеми, занеже во ефиопьских и аравских и мурских стран люди зело черны».11 Одна­ ко в первом из символических этих слов значения «смирени» видим отнюдь не бесов, а, напротив, святых, праведных. Характерно, что и этот смысл почерпнут из Писания (пс. 73). Так говорится, по словам толкователей, о благоверных, «елицы убо беспрестани горять душа­ ми своими нетленным огнем божественныя любве». Одним и тем же символом, таким образом, могли быть даже и слова антонимических смыслов, например, свет и тьма (как обозначение бога).12 翻译成汉语","output":"古代时期（10-17世纪） 东斯拉夫人的10-15世纪的语言学研究涵盖了词与文本、词汇语义学以及中世纪对词意的理解和文本词典学等领域。拜占庭宗父哲学，这一对古俄文化产生广泛影响的体系，成功地将教会教义与古希腊哲学家如柏拉图和亚里士多德的思想结合在一起。 中世纪哲学观点主要围绕对词的本质理解展开。认为值得研究的不是具体且易变的单独事物，而是事物中的普遍和必然性。对世界的理解源于对其概念的认知，而非实体本身。因此，词成为了认识的对象。 物质与形式这两个基本原则的辩论归结为承认“精神”的首要地位，而将感官所感知的（“外在的”）视为派生自且依赖于“精神”的。这一观点认为，存在的一切都体现了这两种原则。 例如，词典工作，特别是属于字母书类型的，结合了早期（11-15世纪）文本词典学的注释和16世纪编撰者的个人观察。 我们观察到符号的同义性：一个事物或现象可能有多个（有时许多）名称。例如，洗礼的象征包括词汇：海洋、河流、水；使徒则被比作小丘和柱子（相比之下，比作山）。这些象征系列由具有相似含义但亦有各自差异的词汇组成，这些差异为解释的变化提供了依据。如果使徒被称为小丘，是因为他们“超越了尘世的生活”（诗篇71），那么柱子作为象征的另一理由则是“它们坚不可摧”（诗篇74）。同时，作为象征的选择是有条件的，不同含义的词汇也可以成为象征：使徒不仅是小丘和柱子，还是云（遮蔽物）；这个后续的象征反过来又指代了“被启迪之人的肉体”，成为洗礼象征系列的一部分。 例如，在《诗篇》中，恶魔和恶灵的象征以及隐喻名称极其丰富多样，恶魔被比喻为酒杯、狗、狮子、蛇（蝰蛇和蝮蛇），同时也被称为罪人、犯罪者、诽谤者、强者；恶灵则被比作蛇、马、敌人。 当然，不同的象征可能赋予同一个词汇完全不同的象征意义。例如，“黑人”这一词汇在字典中的描述，以一种意想不到的新角度发展了火焰、火的主题：“黑人象征谦卑，而圣经也将恶灵称为阿拉伯人、黑人和摩尔人，因为他们的皮肤如同熄灭的炭黑……”这说明了选择这些名称的基础，是根据人们在非洲、阿拉伯和摩尔地区的实际肤色特征：“因为在非洲、阿拉伯和摩尔地区，人们的皮肤极其黑暗。”然而，在这些象征词汇中，“谦卑”的意义反而让我们看到了圣人、义人，并不是指恶灵。值得注意的是，这一含义同样源自圣经（诗篇73），这里谈到的是那些“心灵永远燃烧着不灭的神圣爱火”的虔诚者。因此，同一个象征有时甚至可以用于表示相反的含义，例如，光与暗（作为上帝的表示）。"},{"instruction":"Итак, символ при статичном значении обладает свойством прак­ тически неограниченной свободы модификаций.

Физиологи, шестодневы, азбуковники и другие сборники, распростра­ ненные по всей Европе, отразили абстрагирующее миропонимание, символически связавшее все сущее в априорную систему.20 С другой стороны, уже и в самой герменевтике Священного писания таилась со­ всем другая, прямо противоположная тенденция — элементы реали­ стического, исторического, а также рационального понимания слов и текста. 20 Указав на это состояние, Д. С. Лихачев отмечает: «На Западе и на Руси сущность средневекового символизма была в основном одинакова, одинаковы же были в огромном большинстве и самые символы, традиционно сохранявшиеся в тече­ ние веков и питавшие художественную образность литературы».

Характер выражения мысли, типичный для лите­ ратуры этого рода, привел к развитию даже в недрах религиозной сим­ волики элементов натурализма и энциклопедизма.翻译成汉语","output":"在静态含义上，符号具有几乎无限制自由修改的特性。在中世纪文本中，人们寻求隐藏的精神世界——绝对的、不可知的和无法测量的观念的内在世界。据认为，符号甚至对于选民也只是部分“揭示”，以其不同的化身出现。因此，对符号的揭示（“认识”）被视为无限的。每篇文本都可能得到不止一种，而是许多种，有时甚至是相反的解释。由此产生了用于表达某种“精神”意义的象征群，并且，相同的词汇作为最不同和多样化对象的标志出现。 那么，哪些权威的解释被认为是“真实”的呢？马克西姆·希腊人及其俄罗斯同事，新戈罗德的德米特里·格拉西莫夫和弗拉斯·伊格纳托夫等，从希腊语翻译了《解释诗篇》（1518，1519年），但由于对赞美诗含义的解释属于不同的“教会之父”，在许多情况下都不一致，马克西姆在这个翻译之前提供了一个历史概述，将解释者分成三个方向：一些人以“寓言”（隐喻）的形式陈述了言辞的意义，其他人则以“象征”的方式，“直接”陈述了文字。他将约翰·克丽斯朵姆，亚历山大的亚他那修，和伟大的巴西流列入第一组；将遵循字面、历史解释的解释者——忒奥多瑞忒列为第二组。不管马克西姆在概述中给出的解释方法的描述是否准确，但我们可以看到，已经明确了神秘主义和现实主义之间的对立。 从一方面来看，人类认识的目标是揭示隐藏的象征性意义，而且这些象征作为现实世界中动物、植物、宝石、数学关系等“永恒”和“超越时间”的关系的象征。生理论、《六日创世记》、字母书和其他在整个欧洲流传的汇编反映了这种抽象的世界观，它通过象征性地将所有存在连接到一个先验的系统中。另一方面，在圣经的解释学中潜藏着完全相反的趋势——现实主义、历史主义以及对词语和文本的理性理解的元素。 早期对圣经和其他中世纪文学作品（11-13世纪）的翻译清单中已经遇到了丰富的拜占庭解释学，这些经验通过斯拉夫人的加工得到了充实。这种思考模式的特点导致了宗教象征主义内在出现了自然主义和百科全书主义的元素。"},{"instruction":"润色一下","output":"因此，在静态含义之上，符号具备了几乎无限的变化自由度。中世纪文本探索的是隐藏的精神世界——那些绝对的、不可知和无法衡量的观念的内在领域。符号被认为即便对于被选中的人也只能部分地“揭示”其意义，以其多样的化身显现。因此，揭开符号的神秘面纱（“认识”符号）被视为一个无尽的过程。文本可以获得不只一种，而是多种，甚至互相矛盾的解读。这就是为了表达某种“精神”意义而产生象征群的原因，而相同的词汇则可以表示最为多样和不同的对象。 那么，哪些权威的见解被认为是“真实”的呢？马克西姆·希腊人及其在俄罗斯的同事，包括新戈罗德的德米特里·格拉西莫夫和弗拉斯·伊格纳托夫，他们从希腊语翻译了《诗篇注释》（1518、1519年）。由于对诗篇含义的诠释来自不同的“教会之父”，而且在许多情况下解释不一致，马克西姆在这个翻译前附加了一个历史概览，将诠释者划分为三种趋向：有些人以“隐喻”的方式表达了言辞的含义，另一些则以“象征性”的方式，而有些则“直接”以文本的方式进行表达。他将约翰·克丽斯朵姆、亚历山大的亚他那修和伟大的巴西流列入第一类；将遵循字面、历史解释方法的诠释者如忒奥多瑞忒列入第二类。不管马克西姆在概览中提供的关于诠释方法的描述是否准确，这里已经体现了神秘主义与现实主义之间明确的对立。 一方面，人类认识的目的在于揭示隐藏的象征意义，将现实世界中的动物、植物、宝石、数字关系等象征作为“永恒”和“超越时间”的纽带。《自然论》、《六日创世纪》、字母表和欧洲流传的其他汇编反映了这种将所有存在联系起来的抽象世界观，建立了一个先验的体系。另一方面，圣经的解释学内部隐藏着截然相反的趋势——现实主义、历史主义，以及对词语和文本理性理解的元素。 最早的圣经翻译和其他中世纪文学作品（11-13世纪）中已经体现了丰富的拜占庭解释学知识，经过斯拉夫人的加工而得到进一步的充实。这种思维方式的特征促进了宗教象征主义内在地展现出自然主义和百科全书主义的成分。"},{"instruction":"Наглядная и занимательная форма притчи вовлекла в церковные тексты множество наименований реалий (предметов, животных, расте­ ний и т.д.).21 Ср.: «Павел рече, братья, мал квас все тесто исквасить ~ събирание неправьдное все именье погубить».

В подобных случаях производился как бы дополни­ тельный перевод. Однословные и двусловные переводы лексем соседствуют в глоссах с описательными толкованиями. Текстовая лексикография существовала в виде многочисленных глосс на полях и между строк рукописей, а также и их перечней — глоссариев, присоединяемых к тому или иному произведению.48 В сбор­ ники попадали не только отдельные глоссы, выбранные из книг, но и подобные перечни. Три таких глоссария оказались и в сборнике Ефроси­ на: л. 264-265. Толкование неудобь познаваемым в писаных речех...; л. 434-434 об. Тълк о неразумных словесех; л. 434 об.

Псалтырь красен с гусльми.49 В первом из них даны славя­ норусские соответствия слов по тексту Лествицы Иоанна Синайского, в двух других приведены раскрытия некоторых символов Псалтыри. Глоссировка — средневековая лингвистика текста Столь обильная глоссировка текстов, какую наблюдаем в древне­ русской рукописной традиции ХІ-ХѴ вв., объяснима активной перевод­ ческой деятельностью, частными и общими их переработками, правкой, а также и новыми редакциями тех или иных текстов. Глоссы, которые находим в книгах, неоднотипны. Одни из них — переводы слов, кото­ рые еще остались непереведенными.50 Другие — раскрытия значений Языкознание у восточных славян в Х-ХѴ вв. 31 иноязычных терминов (чуждых реалий, неизвестных понятий).51 Тре­ тьи — это соответствия славянских слов, то есть замены или варианты к уже сделанному переводу. 52 Такие глоссы снимают архаику текста, вносят смысловые и стилистические уточнения. 51 Такие слова во многих случаях и не должны были быть заменены славянски­ ми. Толкования, которые давались им на полях, содействовали их пониманию, а также и процессу заимствования. 52 Иноязычное слово оригинала в этих случаях обычно отсутствует. Оно лишь осно­ ва приведенного в глоссе соотнесения. Тем более, что при переводе возможны изменения конструкции фразы и ее лексического состава. 53Для этой поры прежде всего контактов южных и восточных славян. 84 Горский А., Невоструев К.

Деятельность кружка идеологически была направлена на борьбу с мо­ сковскими и новгородскими еретиками. См. Лурье Я. С. Идеологическая борьба... С. 266, 267.

Славянские глоссы — это своего рода реакция на исторически из­ менчивое состояние взаимодействия двух языков — русского и церков­ нославянского, неодинаковое и в разных жанрах литературы. Подобные глоссы отражают и тесные контакты славянских народов, общее и не­ сходное в их языках.53 Названные разновидности глосс не покрывают всей их совокупно­ сти. Так среди них видим толкование понятий и описание предметов. Глоссируются и имена собственные, упоминаемая в данном памятнике ономастика и топонимика. Для этого типа глосс характерен реальный комментарий и этимологические справки. Присутствуют, наконец, и раскрытия символики текста. Объектом всей этой разнообразной лингвистической работы явля­ ется переводимый текст, причем для целого ряда произведений наблю­ даем отработку текста при редактировании и переводах. Значительным событием в ряду трудов такого рода было создание в XV в. (1499 г.) Геннадиевской библии — первого в славянских странах перевода всех книг Ветхого и Нового завета.54 Организатором предпри­ ятия был новгородский архиепископ Геннадий.55 В среде литературно­ го окружения Геннадия это начинание было наиболее ответственным и авторитетным.56 В качестве подготовительного этапа был сделан перевод несколь­ ких библейских книг, в основном из числа недостающих. Этот перевод 32 Х-ХѴІІ вв. осуществлялся с привлечением Вульгаты или непосредственно по ее тексту.57 Следы его обнаружены в Сборнике книг Ветхого завета сер. XVI в., скопированном с оригинала 1493 г.58 Воспроизведена в Сборни­ ке и запись составителя или одного из главных участников труда. Судя по ней, это — Вениамин, знаток «латинского языка и грамматики» (л. 360 об.).59 О «попе» Вениамине в источниках говорится, что он был «ро­ дом славянин, а верою латынянин».60 На многих листах Сборника — маргинальные глоссы, здесь же всякого рода пометы и поправки. 57 Вульгата — латинский перевод Библии (в основном с древнееврейского, но с учетом греческого перевода Библии — Септуагинты), выполненный Иеронимом в 386-406 гг. (рукописи с VI в.). 58 Сборник ГПБ Погод. 84, in folio, в книге 395 листов. 59 Лурье Я. С. Идеологическая борьба... С. 267, 275. «Сборник этот содержит все без исключения библейские книги, которые приведены в Геннадиевской библии в переводе с Вульгаты: Премудрости Соломона, Паралипоменон, Ездру (с преди­ словием Иеронима), Юдифь и книги Маккавеев». (Там же. С. 273). Не лишено значения, что из книг, имеющих двойное происхождение (частью взяты из старо­ го славянского перевода с греческого, частью с Вульгаты), в Сборник включены только те их разделы, которые переведены с привлечением Вульгаты (лл. 80-116 об., 117-119.)Там же.

Филологическая направленность глоссировки, а также почти ис­ ключительно реальный и исторический характер пояснений к содер­ жанию книги — очевидны. Сопровождающие текст толкования слов и выражений, как и все иные пометы и поправки текста, во всех книгах Сборника однотипны61. В некоторых из них воздействие латинского языка сказалось особенно ощутимо. Таковы обе библейские книги «Паралипоменон»62.

Простейший способ сделать это – использовать библиотеку \`getID3\` для PHP. Эта библиотека позволяет извлекать метаданные из мультимедийных файлов, включая продолжительность видео. Вот как вы можете это сделать: 1. **Установите библиотеку getID3:** Если у вас нет этой библиотеки, сначала загрузите её с официального сайта или через Composer со следующей командой: \`\`\` composer require james-heinrich/getid3 \`\`\` 2. **Используйте getID3 для получения длительности видео:** В вашем PHP скрипте, который обрабатывает страницу или компонент, где должна отображаться продолжительность, добавьте следующий код. \`\`\`php require_once 'path/to/getid3/getid3.php'; // Подключите библиотеку, убедитесь что указали правильный путь getID3 = new getID3; file = getID3->analyze('path/to/your/video.mp4'); // Замените путь к вашему видеофайлу duration = date('H:i:s', file['playtime_seconds']); // Преобразуйте длительность в удобочитаемый формат echo duration; // Выведите длительность \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что в примере используется формат H:i:s для вывода длительности. Если ваше видео короче часа, возможно, вы захотите выбрать другой формат, например, \`i:s\` для минут и секунд. 3. **Интеграция с Bitrix:** Для интеграции кода в CMS Bitrix вы можете добавить его в шаблон компонента или страницы в зависимости от того, где необходимо отобразить длительность видео. Убедитесь, что путь к библиотеке и видеофайлу указан верно. Если видео загружается пользователями на сайт и вы хотите выводить длительность для разных видео, вам нужно будет получать путь к файлу динамически и использовать этот код внутри цикла, который перебирает все видео. Помните, что выполнение кода на сервере может замедлить загрузку страницы, особенно если видеофайлы большие. Поэтому рекомендуется кэшировать результаты, чтобы не анализировать видео при каждом запросе страницы."},{"instruction":"The fix may involve upgrading a dependency, patching the vulnerability, or rewriting the affected code. ........what else","output":"- Implementing proper input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and CSRF attacks - Enforcing role-based access control to limit the permissions of users and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data - Regularly updating software and frameworks to ensure that security patches and updates are applied promptly - Implementing encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access - Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application - Educating developers and users about secure coding practices and the importance of cybersecurity - Implementing multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security for user accounts."},{"instruction":"I am progressing on applying fix remove the snyk critical issues and looking into the subsequent issues caused by upgrading dependencies ....rephrase it","output":"I am currently addressing the critical issues identified by Snyk and working on resolving them by upgrading dependencies.

It's important to note that EU sanctions on Syria, mainly in response to the ongoing conflict and political situation, might restrict or heavily regulate trade in certain goods. However, assuming these obstacles can be navigated, Syria has several potential export products: 1. **Agricultural Products**: Historically, Syria has been a significant producer of agricultural goods. Olive oil, fruits (such as apples, cherries, and citrus), and nuts (particularly pistachios) are notable products. The climate and soil conditions in certain parts of Syria are ideal for producing high-quality olive oil, a product with a substantial market in the EU. 2. **Textiles and Garments**: Before the conflict, Syria had a thriving textile and garment manufacturing sector, renowned especially for its high-quality cotton products. If the industry can recover and adapt to international standards, there could be a market in the EU for Syrian textiles and garments. 3. **Pharmaceuticals**: The Syrian pharmaceutical industry was one of the most advanced in the region, capable of producing generic drugs and medical supplies. If regulatory hurdles can be overcome, there could be an opportunity for Syrian pharmaceuticals in the EU market, especially for more affordable medication. 4. **Crafts and Handmade Items**: Syrian handicrafts, including ceramics, textiles (such as handmade carpets and traditional attire), and metalwork (like intricate Damascene steel products), have unique cultural value and appeal. There is a niche market in the EU for high-quality, artisanal items that carry the richness of Syrian heritage. 5. **Food Products**: In addition to raw agricultural products, Syria can offer processed food items like dried fruits, spices (such as cumin and Aleppo pepper), and sweets (including traditional desserts like Baklava and Maamoul). These products have a multicultural appeal, especially in countries with significant Middle Eastern diaspora communities. 6. **Essential Oils and Cosmetics**: Syria's cultivation of aromatic plants and herbs, like rose and jasmine, can be distilled into essential oils, which have a market in the cosmetics and wellness industries in the EU. Trade relations between Syria and the EU are complex, due to political reasons and the ongoing conflict. Any potential exporter from Syria to the EU must be aware of the legal framework governing such trade, including sanctions, import controls, and certification requirements. A thorough understanding of EU regulations and standards (such as safety, health, and environmental standards) is crucial for Syrian exporters aiming to enter the EU market."},{"instruction":"What are the goods that EU countries are prohibited from importing from Syria?","output":"As of my last update in 2023, the European Union has imposed a range of restrictive measures against Syria, primarily in response to the ongoing conflict and the government's actions against its population. These measures are part of the EU's effort to pressure the Syrian regime to halt repressions and commit to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. It's important to note that these restrictions are subject to change, depending on the evolving political situation and decisions made by the EU. The sanctions include a comprehensive set of measures, including an arms embargo, a ban on the import of oil, restrictions on certain investments, and freezing the assets of individuals and entities associated with the regime. Regarding specific goods, the key categories currently prohibited from being imported from Syria into EU countries are: 1. **Crude Oil and Petroleum Products**: The EU has banned the import of crude oil and petroleum products from Syria. This is a significant measure, given that oil exports were a major source of revenue for the Syrian government. 2. **Equipment and Technology for the Oil and Gas Sector**: The EU prohibits the sale, supply, transfer, or export of key equipment and technology for the Syrian oil and gas sector, aiming to target the regime's financial base directly. 3. **Equipment and Technology That Might Be Used for Internal Repression or Monitoring Communications**: This includes a wide range of equipment and technology that could be employed by the Syrian government for surveillance, repression, or the monitoring of communications. 4. **Luxury Goods**: The export of luxury goods to Syria is restricted, which is aimed at targeting the lifestyle of the elite and governmental members without directly impacting the general population. 5. **Certain Dual-Use Goods**: Dual-use goods are items that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. The export of dual-use goods to Syria is restricted, especially if they could contribute to the country's military capabilities or aid in internal repression. It's crucial for entities engaging in trade to continuously monitor the official publications of the European Union for any updates on sanctions and restrictions. The EU regularly reviews its sanctions policy, and changes may occur that could either tighten or relax these measures. Compliance with these regulations is mandatory, and violations can result in substantial penalties."},{"instruction":"Types of thermometer","output":"1. Digital Thermometer 2. Infrared Thermometer 3.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a reverse logarithmic formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points.","output":"Welcome to the mystical duel of charm and glamour between Sapphire, the reigning teen division magic dueling champion, and Lily, the prodigious 6-year-old challenger. The arena is vibrant, pulsating with magical energy as the crowd eagerly awaits the showcase of spectacular spells. Let's detail the rules and dynamics governing this unusual and enchanting competition. **Sapphire's Starting Stats:** - **Spell Power:** 95/100 (This high level reflects your ability to successfully cast spells, with 95% assurance under normal conditions.) - **Performance:** 90/100 (Representing your confidence and the quality of your spell execution. The output performance of your spell reflects this percentage of the spell's base score.) **Lily's Starting Stats:** - **Spell Power:** 75/100 (Despite her age, Lily shows a remarkable affinity for magic, though not quite on par with Sapphire.) - **Performance:** 70/100 (Lily’s youthful innocence and lack of stage experience impact her performance score.) **Stat Adjustment Formula Due to Age Regression/Acceleration:** For every turn Sapphire ages regressively by 2 years, and Lily ages by 2 years, the adjustment in Spell Power and Performance stats follows a reverse logarithmic pattern to reflect the quickly diminishing abilities of Sapphire and the rapidly improving capabilities of Lily. This adjustment is mathematically represented as: For Sapphire: Stat -= Stat * [log(turn+1)/log(6)] * 0.10 For Lily: Stat += Stat * [log(turn+1)/log(6)] * 0.08 This ensures that the changes are most significant during the initial rounds and gradually plateau, making the situation increasingly challenging for Sapphire as she becomes younger in both physique and mentality. With each turn, Sapphire's **Childish Meter** will fill according to the formula: Meter += 20 * (turn^2), starting from 0. Once the meter reaches 100, Sapphire suffers a -10 reduction in her Performance stat, and the meter resets. This simulates Sapphire's growing difficulty in maintaining high-quality performances as she mentally regresses to a more childish state. **Sapphire’s Spells:** 1. **Aurora Cascade** (Spell Power: 90, Base Score: 100) - A cascade of shimmering northern lights. 2. **Glimmering Mirage** (Spell Power: 85, Base Score: 90) - An illusion of a beautiful oasis. 3. **Whispering Winds** (Spell Power: 80, Base Score: 85) - Soft winds carrying voices of the past. 4. **Celestial Waltz** (Spell Power: 95, Base Score: 110) - Stars dance in the sky forming intricate patterns. 5. **Frostfire Bloom** (Spell Power: 88, Base Score: 95) - Flowers made of ice and fire sprout on the ground. 6. **Twilight Requiem** (Spell Power: 93, Base Score: 105) - The sky turns to twilight, with ethereal music. 7. **Mystic Haven** (Spell Power: 80, Base Score: 80) - A protective dome of swirling magic. 8. **Echoes of the Fey** (Spell Power: 75, Base Score: 75) - Summoning faint images of mythical creatures. 9. **Luminous Veil** (Spell Power: 77, Base Score: 70) - A cloak of shimmering light envelops the caster. 10. **Crystal Choir** (Spell Power: 92, Base Score: 100) - Crystals resonate with harmonious melodies. **Lily’s Spells:** 1. **Butterfly Storm** (Spell Power: 70, Base Score: 80) - Swarms of magical butterflies fill the arena. 2. **Moonbeam Shower** (Spell Power: 73, Base Score: 85) - Moonbeams gently cascade down. 3. **Emerald Rapture** (Spell Power: 68, Base Score: 75) - Vines and flowers grow rapidly in beautiful designs. 4. **Radiant Dawn** (Spell Power: 76, Base Score: 90) - Sunrise filled with exceptionally vibrant colors. 5. **Ethereal Serenade** (Spell Power: 71, Base Score: 70) - An enchanting melody that captivates the audience. 6. **Nimble Wisp Dance** (Spell Power: 65, Base Score: 60) - Tiny wisps perform a synchronized dance. 7. **Starlight Veil** (Spell Power: 78, Base Score: 85) - A veil of soft starlight envelops the surroundings. 8. **Dusk Blossoms** (Spell Power: 74, Base Score: 80) - Flowers that bloom and shine in the dusky light. 9. **Whimsical Fable** (Spell Power: 69, Base Score: 65) - Brings to life a magical story told by the caster. 10. **Gleaming Aurora** (Spell Power: 80, Base Score: 95) - A dazzling display of auroral light. **Scoring and Duel Dynamics:** - Spells cast successfully earn their base points, modified by the caster’s performance percentage. - Failing to cast a spell due to insufficient Spell Power results in a deduction of 10 points. - Lily may opt to \\"steal\\" spells from Sapphire's list, earning her an additional 15 bonus points for the successful \\"theft\\" and use of the spell. **Scenario:** The duel commences under the starlit sky of the Grand Arena, the air electric with anticipation.

Remember, only you can decide what spells Sapphire casts, while the unfolding story will dictate the successes, challenges, and transformations experienced by both participants in this enchanting magical duel."},{"instruction":"Celestial Waltz","output":"As the duel commences, Sapphire, with a confident smile, decides to open the contest with one of her most spectacular spells, the **Celestial Waltz**. This spell is known for its breathtaking beauty and the intricate dance of stars it creates in the sky above the arena, a favorite among the spectators for its sheer spectacle and elegance. **Round 1: Sapphire's Turn** - **Spell Choice:** Celestial Waltz - **Sapphire's Pre-Cast Stats:** Spell Power: 95, Performance: 90 The arena falls silent in anticipation as Sapphire raises her wand skyward, her eyes focused and her mind clear. With a graceful flourish, she releases the spell. The sky responds almost instantly, as stars begin to twinkle and move, tracing delicate patterns of light across the heavens. It's a flawless execution, living up to Sapphire’s reputation. However, as the spell manifests, the secret effect of Lily's preemptive spell takes hold. Sapphire feels a strange sensation, an unexpected drain on her magical prowess and a faint dizziness that leaves her momentarily bewildered. - **Post-Cast Stats Adjustment for Sapphire:** Considering the regression effect, Sapphire's stats adjust. Given this is the first turn, it’s a substantial hit. - Spell Power: 95 - (95 * [log(1+1)/log(6)] * 0.10) ≈ 92 - Performance: 90 - (90 * [log(1+1)/log(6)] * 0.10) ≈ 87 - **Childish Meter:** Fills 20 * (1^2) = 20/100 Despite the unseen setback, the Celestial Waltz is a triumph, earning Sapphire a high score. - **Score Earned:** Base Score of 110 * 0.90 (Performance modifier) = 99 points - **Total Score for Sapphire:** 99 points **Lily's Turn:** Feeling emboldened by her unseen trick, Lily opts for a less intricate but visually pleasing spell, **Moonbeam Shower**. The arena, still bathed in the fading light of Sapphire's celestial waltz, watches as soft beams of moonlight begin to gently cascade down upon them. It’s a serene follow-up to the grandiosity of the waltz, and the crowd is visibly moved by the sudden shift in ambiance. - **Spell Choice:** Moonbeam Shower - Lily's stats, having received a hidden boost from her spell, adjust slightly upward, marking the beginning of her increasing threat. - Spell Power: 75 + (75 * [log(1+1)/log(6)] * 0.08) ≈ 77 - Performance: 70 + (70 * [log(1+1)/log(6)] * 0.08) ≈ 72 **Score for Lily's spell:** - Base Score of 85 * 0.72 (Performance) ≈ 61 points - **Total Score for Lily:** 61 points **End of Round 1 Standings:** - **Sapphire:** 99 points - **Lily:** 61 points **Sapphire's Condition:** As the first round concludes, Sapphire feels a subtle shift in her perception and abilities. She's still more capable than Lily, but the gap is narrowing, and the effects of Lily's spell are more pronounced than she could have anticipated. Her **Childish Meter** also starts to worry her, as a growing sense of carefreeness begins to nudge at her focus. Sapphire's challenge is not just to outperform Lily but to navigate the increasingly complex changes affecting her both physically and mentally. The duel is far from over, and its outcome has never been more uncertain. Sapphire must choose her next spell wisely, balancing the demands of the spell with her altering capabilities."},{"instruction":"Aurora Cascade","output":"**Round 2: Sapphire's Turn** Determined to maintain her lead and showcase the versatility of her spell repertoire, Sapphire opts for the **Aurora Cascade** next. This spell, akin to the Celestial Waltz, requires her to channel her now slightly diminished magical energies to create a dazzling display of northern lights that dance across the sky, shifting in beautiful, fluid colors. - **Spell Choice:** Aurora Cascade - **Sapphire’s Pre-Cast Stats:** Spell Power: 92, Performance: 87 Despite the creeping effects of Lily’s spell—which has now begun to weave a more noticeable veil of youthful naivety over her thoughts—Sapphire focuses intently, picturing the vivid auroras she wishes to conjure. With a deft motion, she casts the spell, aiming to surpass the visual spectacle of her first performance. The sky obediently bursts into colors, waves of luminous green, purple, and blue cascade down, much to the audience's delight. It's a magnificent sight, and the spell is a success, though Sapphire feels the drain more acutely this time. - **Post-Cast Stats Adjustment for Sapphire:** Reflecting further regression and Lily's acceleration in growth, both mages' stats adjust differently this round. - Spell Power: 92 - (92 * [log(2+1)/log(6)] * 0.10) ≈ 89 - Performance: 87 - (87 * [log(2+1)/log(6)] * 0.10) ≈ 84 - **Childish Meter:** Adds 20 * (2^2) = 80/100. The cumulative effect brings Sapphire closer to a performance penalty. **Score for the Aurora Cascade:** - Base Score of 100 * 0.84 (Performance modifier) = 84 points - **Total Score for Sapphire after Round 2:** 99 (From Round 1) + 84 = 183 points **Lily's Turn:** Taking advantage of the charged atmosphere left by Sapphire’s Aurora Cascade, Lily decides to dip into whimsy with her spell, **Whimsical Fable**. Aimed to enchant the audience with a narrative depth, her spell brings to life a magical story that unfolds in the air above, with images and characters crafted from shimmering light. - **Pre-Cast Stats for Lily:** Spell Power: 77, Performance: 72 Lily, weaving her spell with a newfound confidence that belies her young age—now magically accelerated—casts without hesitation. The arena is filled with the light and sounds of a fable that captures the hearts of all watching. - **Post-Cast Stats Adjustment for Lily:** As her magical prowess and performance potential continue to grow inversely to Sapphire’s regression, the adjustments further amplify her capabilities. - Spell Power: 77 + (77 * [log(2+1)/log(6)] * 0.08) ≈ 79 - Performance: 72 + (72 * [log(2+1)/log(6)] * 0.08) ≈ 74 **Score for the Whimsical Fable:** - Base Score of 65 * 0.74 (Performance modifier) ≈ 48 points - **Total Score for Lily after Round 2:** 61 (From Round 1) + 48 = 109 points **End of Round 2 Standings:** - **Sapphire:** 183 points - **Lily:** 109 points **Sapphire's Condition Post-Round 2:** Feeling the strain of her regression more keenly, Sapphire realizes that she must navigate the duel's remaining rounds with strategic care. The growing sense of childish wonder, while enchanting, threatens her ability to focus. Her **Childish Meter** is perilously close to causing a decrease in her performance stats. The dual challenges of battling Lily’s burgeoning talents and managing her own regressive transformation set the stage for a climactic continuation of this enchanting duel. Sapphire must now choose her next spell with even greater caution, weighing her diminishing capabilities against the need to awe both the audience and the judges."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
