In other words, cross-validation is a method for selecting model hyperparameters and for assessing performance of a model. It is a technique used to ensure that we are not overfitting to the training data and evaluate the accuracy of a model on unseen data. This can be done by splitting the data into a set of folds, typically 5 - 10, and running model training and testing k times, with each time one of the folds as the validation set and the other folds as the training set. The result of this process is the average validation accuracy across the k folds of the data. This gives us a better understanding of how the model will perform in production."},{"instruction":"Suggest a way to generate random passwords using Python.","output":"One way to generate random passwords using Python is to use the string module's methods.

However, relying too heavily on AI can have detrimental effects, including ethical issues, inaccurate results, and loss of human control. One of the primary pitfalls of relying on AI is ethical issues. While AI is programmed to follow specific rules and guidelines, it may discriminate against specific groups or perpetuate biases in its outputs. For example, if an AI system is trained on a biased dataset, it may reproduce the same biases in its results, leading to unfair treatment of certain populations. Additionally, AI systems may lack empathy or a moral compass, leading to decisions that are not aligned with societal values and norms. Another potential issue with AI is the risk of producing inaccurate results. While AI systems are designed to minimize errors and deliver high-quality results, they are not foolproof. If AI systems are provided with incomplete, irrelevant, or inaccurate data, they may produce flawed outputs, leading to flawed recommendations and decisions. Human intervention is needed to correct any mistakes and ensure that AI is working as intended. Finally, relying too heavily on AI systems may create a loss of human control. AI systems are built to optimize for a specific goal, and they may take actions that are counterintuitive or unpredictable, leading to unexpected results. Additionally, overreliance on AI may lead to a lack of human judgment and intuition, which are essential for complex decision-making processes. In conclusion, while AI has numerous benefits, its pitfalls cannot be overlooked. Ethical concerns, inaccurate results, and loss of human control are among the top issues that must be addressed to ensure that AI is used safely and effectively. As AI continues to advance, it's crucial to remain mindful of its limitations and use it as a tool to augment human intelligence rather than replace it."},{"instruction":"Summarize the operation of a quicksort algorithm","output":"Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that involves selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

The invention of a teleportation device allowed people to travel instantaneously from one place to another without the need for any physical transportation. However, this newfound convenience came at a cost. The teleportation device utilized a complex algorithm to transmit a person's atomic structure to another location, effectively disintegrating their body and recreating it elsewhere. Despite countless assurances from scientists that the process was safe, a growing number of people became uneasy about the idea of being broken down and rebuilt on the other end of a teleportation. One man, a brilliant scientist named Dr. Mason, became obsessed with the idea of finding an alternative. He worked tirelessly for years, and finally discovered a new way to travel called \\"Quantum Shifting.\\" The process was based on the principles of quantum entanglement, and unlike the traditional teleportation method, it did not require the disintegration of matter. Excited to share his discovery with the world, Dr. Mason arranged a public demonstration. A small crowd gathered around as he stepped onto a platform similar in appearance to a teleportation device. But instead of disappearing in a flash of light, he simply vanished. The crowd gasped in surprise, but before they could respond, Dr. Mason suddenly reappeared on the platform, looking startled but unharmed. He explained to the audience that the process involved linking the quantum states of two particles in different locations, effectively creating a \\"tunnel\\" between the two points through which he could travel. The potential implications of this discovery were huge, and it wasn't long before governments and private entities began vying for control of the technology. Dr. Mason refused to sell his research to anyone, fearing that it would be used for malicious purposes. Instead, he founded a non-profit organization dedicated to developing Quantum Shifting for the public good. The technology soon became commonplace, allowing people to travel anywhere in the world without the risks associated with traditional teleportation. But Dr. Mason had always known that the true power of Quantum Shifting lay in its ability to transport people not only through space, but through time as well. Years later, as Dr. Mason lay on his deathbed, he instructed his protégé to use the technology to send him back in time to prevent the tragedy that had claimed his family years before. The experiment worked, and Dr. Mason found himself back in his youth, determined to change the course of history. But as he worked tirelessly to alter his past and secure a better future, he began to realize that the past could not be simply rewritten, but was a web of intertwined events and people who shaped who he had become. In the end, Dr. Mason chose not to alter his past, but to embrace the future he had been given, knowing that every decision he had made had brought him to that very moment."},{"instruction":"What is the purpose of clustering in machine learning?","output":"The purpose of clustering in machine learning is to group similar data points together based on their inherent characteristics or features, and to discover meaningful patterns in the data set."},{"instruction":"Redact all the private data from the following document: John Smith, 3456 Main Street, Apt 2, Anytown, CA, 78956","output":"Redacted document: \\" , 3456 Main Street, Apt 2, Anytown, CA, 78956\\""},{"instruction":"Write the opposite of 'She is doing the task'.","output":"She is not doing the task."},{"instruction":"Generate a Java code for printing 1 to 10 using a for loop.","output":"Here is the code: \`\`\` for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { System.out.println(i); } \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Design a professional email signature for a digital marketing manager: Name: John Johnson Profession: Digital Marketing Manager Contact: john@example.com","output":"Name: John Johnson Profession: Digital Marketing Manager Contact: john@example.com"},{"instruction":"What is a nonmaterial incentive that can be used to motivate employees?","output":"Recognition or praise for good work can be a non-material incentive that can be used to motivate employees."},{"instruction":"Write a poem written in the sonnet format: A summer outing","output":"On sunny days we seek the great outdoors, And leave the city's hustle far behind.

After a brief struggle, the government was toppled and the Bolsheviks took control. One of the key factors that led to the revolution was the mass discontent among the Russian people, who had been suffering from years of war, famine, and political corruption. The Bolsheviks promised to address these issues and to promote equality and social justice. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks established a socialist government and pursued a program of radical social and economic reform. They redistributed land, nationalized industry, and abolished the capitalist system. The October Revolution had a profound impact on the course of world history, and it inspired communist movements around the globe.

Self-discovery is both a science and an art, as it involves both analytical and creative thinking. On the scientific side, self-discovery involves a lot of introspection and self-reflection. Analyzing your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can help you understand the deeper aspects of your personality. It's essential to ask yourself questions like \\"What do I value the most?\\" or \\"What makes me happy?\\" and reflect on how you can align your life with these aspects. Furthermore, psychology teaches us about personality traits and how they can influence our behavior. Learning about personality types like introverts vs. extroverts, thinkers vs. feelers, and so on can help you understand yourself better and improve your relationships with others. Personality tests like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or the Enneagram can also be useful tools for self-discovery. On the artistic side, self-discovery involves exploring your creativity and imagination. This could mean trying out new hobbies, traveling to new places, or experimenting with different forms of expression, such as writing or painting. Engaging in creative activities can help you connect with your inner self and discover new parts of your personality that you may not have known existed. Moreover, art therapy is becoming increasingly popular as a tool for self-discovery. This therapy involves using art as a way to explore emotions, develop self-awareness, and manage stress. It's a powerful way to express yourself and discover hidden aspects of your personality. Self-discovery can be a lifelong process, but it's never too late to start.

From climate change to pollution, our actions have significant impacts on the planet's health. However, there are simple and effective ways to reduce your environmental impact. Here are five steps that anyone can take to make a difference. 1. Reduce, reuse, and recycle The three R's are the cornerstone of sustainable living. First, minimize waste by avoiding disposable items and opting for reusable alternatives like cloth bags, water bottles, and coffee cups. Second, find creative ways to repurpose items that might otherwise end up in landfills. Finally, recycle materials like aluminum, glass, and plastic to conserve natural resources and reduce pollution. 2. Choose sustainable transportation Transportation is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce your carbon footprint, opt for low-carbon transportation options like biking, walking, or taking public transit whenever possible. If you must drive, choose an energy-efficient vehicle or carpool with others to reduce emissions. 3. Conserve energy at home Energy use is another significant contributor to climate change. To conserve energy, switch to LED light bulbs, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and upgrade to energy-efficient appliances. You can also reduce heating and cooling costs by sealing drafts and using a programmable thermostat. 4. Eat a plant-based diet Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. By choosing a plant-based diet, you can reduce your environmental impact while also improving your health.

The crisis was provoked by Soviet attempts to establish nuclear missile bases in Cuba, which would have provided a direct threat to the United States. This threatened the balance of power of the Cold War era, and the crisis is often cited as the closest the world ever came to nuclear war. The United States discovered the missile bases in October 1962 through aerial reconnaissance. President John F. Kennedy then addressed the nation in a televised speech, announcing that Soviet missiles were being installed in Cuba, and that the U.S. would take action to prevent them from becoming operational. The U.S. implemented a naval blockade at 800 miles from Cuba, intercepting any Soviet ships carrying missiles. Soviet ships carrying missiles were ordered to turn back, and the U.S. was ready to use force if necessary. Meanwhile, diplomatic negotiations were taking place over the crisis. The U.S. demanded that the Soviet Union remove the missile bases from Cuba, and the Soviet Union demanded that the U.S. remove its missile bases in Turkey. Both sides eventually reached a compromise. The U.S. promised not to attack Cuba, and the Soviet Union agreed to remove its missile bases from Cuba. In secret, the U.S. also agreed to remove its missile bases from Turkey. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a significant event in the history of the Cold War. It marked a turning point in U.S.-Soviet relations, and led to an understanding for both parties as to the dangers of nuclear arms. The crisis also led to new efforts of communication between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, including the establishment of a direct communication line between the White House and the Kremlin. For Cuba, the crisis meant the consolidation of the Cuban Revolution and the country's socialist development. The Cuban Missile Crisis has continued to have an impact on foreign policy and the study of international relations. It demonstrated the importance of clear communication and diplomacy in avoiding conflict. It also raised concerns over nuclear weapons, leading to further arms control agreements and efforts to limit nuclear proliferation. The Cuban Missile Crisis serves as a reminder of the importance of international cooperation, and the consequences of miscommunication and aggressive actions."},{"instruction":"Given the following input, replace the blanks in the story with appropriate words.

Michelangelo lived through a tumultuous period of Italian history, marked by constant wars and political conflicts. He had strong political opinions and was a supporter of the Medici family, who were often involved in these conflicts. This led to him being exiled from Florence on two occasions, and he spent much of his life moving between different Italian cities, often working as an architect and engineer for various patrons. In his personal life, Michelangelo was somewhat of a recluse, rarely fraternizing with others and cutting himself off from the world. He was also a deeply religious man and spent much of his time in prayer and contemplation. Michelangelo never married, and although it is speculated that he may have been homosexual or asexual, there is no concrete evidence to support this.

Random initialization - selecting initial centroids randomly for each cluster. 3. Euclidean distance calculation - computing the distance between each data point and the centroid of the cluster it belongs to. 4. Clustering - grouping data points with respect to their proximity to the nearest centroid. 5. Centroid update - updating the position of each cluster centroid by taking the mean of all data points belonging to that cluster. 6. Iterative process - repeating the clustering and centroid update steps until either convergence is reached or a specified number of iterations is completed.

Prologue Ira Glass Today, we have this story for you about cars-- American cars. And like a lot of stories about American cars, this one is more tragedy than comedy, although there is some comedy in there, too. The good news, of course, about American cars is that American cars are ge�ing be�er, especially in the last few years. You've probably heard that. Michelle Krebs Well, at Ford, the Ford Fusion-- Consumer Reports named it a be�er car than the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord a few years ago. I think that was a major turning point. Ira Glass Michelle Krebs has been covering the auto industry for 35 years. She's now at autotrader.com. She says the reason American cars �nally improved-- Michelle Krebs I think when you're on the brink of possible extinction, it wakes people up, and they started changing things. But that's what it took. I mean, that's why Ford came out with the Ford Fusion. They spent 23 billion-- borrowed 23 billion, because they were almost out of business. Ira Glass So basically, it's deathbed conversions. Michelle Krebs That's a good way to describe it. They decided, we have got to bet the ranch on building great cars that people really want to buy. They're still not all the way there yet. I mean, I think that's the simple fact of the ma�er. There's been progress, but it's been spo�y. Ira Glass How spo�y? When Consumer Reports rated the top 10 most reliable car brands this year, only one was American. 9 were foreign. 4 of the top 5, no surprise, were Japanese-- Toyota, Honda, Mazda, and Lexus. Why are most American cars still not as good as foreign cars? Why is it still taking Detroit so long to learn this lesson? It's not like this reliability problem just snuck up on them, right? General Motors, the biggest American car maker, started losing market share 50 years ago. Back in the 1960s, GM sold over half the cars in the United States, and then that number just slid lower and lower and lower for decades, until now, it's 18% of all cars sold in the US. Today's program came out of a question that we had here at the radio show. We genuinely did not understand why American car makers waited until they were nearly extinct-- two of them bankrupt, one of them nearly bankrupt. Why didn't they get on the ball and start making reliable cars that could compete with the Japanese decades ago? It seemed like, OK, you're running a business. You're losing sales in such a huge way. Why wouldn't you change? It 1 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript really made no sense. And we looked around for an explanation, and we learned about this one car factory in California. Here. What happened at this factory not only illustrates some very interesting answers to that question, it captures a lot of what went wrong in the American car business in the last 35 years. This is a plant in Fremont, California, called NUMMI. NUMMI stands for New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated. A modern car plant, by the way, sounds a lot like a casino. The automated gear plays these li�le songs to let you know that it's running. Driverless robotic carts glide up and down the aisles like R2D2 delivering doors and other parts. Their song is supposed to warn you that they're coming. The story of this particular factory is actually a famous story among car people. It's taught at business schools. NUMMI was opened in 1984 by GM and Toyota together. The two companies decided that this would be a place that they would build cars with each other. And if it seems strange to you that two competitors would do this, it seemed strange at the time, also. A headline in Car and Driver about the partnership read, \\"Hell Freezes Over.\\" But both companies had their reasons. We'll get to those. At NUMMI, Toyota showed GM all of its secrets. Showed it exactly how it made some of the best-built, most reliable cars in the world back then. GM, at the time, hoped to take these lessons from NUMMI and carry them into all their other plants, all over the country and over the world. That was the 1980s. And then, well, you know, it didn't go well. GM was one of the car makers who went bankrupt. US taxpayers, you and I, we bailed them out for 50 billion. And NUMMI closed. This GM plant that seemed like it might be able to teach American car makers how to catch up to their competitors-- it stopped making cars for GM. The sounds that you're hearing right now-- they were recorded in 2010, in the last months before GM shu�ered the place, on April Fools' Day that year. Back then, we put together this story that we're about to play for you today. For a few months before NUMMI closed, Frank Lang��, who at the time was NPR's automotive correspondent, and one of our producers, Brian Reed, travelled around the country talking to GM workers and managers about what had happened at NUMMI. General Motors and the UAW-- they are secretive cultures. But as you're going to hear, people were blunt when they talked to Frank about this. They were blunt in a way that you rarely hear with auto executives and UAW reps when they're being interviewed by the press. Act One of our show is going to be about the rise of NUMMI. Act Two is where we get the answer to our question-- what prevented GM from learning from NUMMI for so many years? For WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Our show today produced with our colleagues at NPR News. And now it is my pleasure to turn the story over to Frank Lang��. Act One: Act One Frank Lang�� When NUMMI was conceived, General Motors was far and away the world's largest car company. Its US market share was seven times that of Toyota. But each company had a problem that the other company could help them solve. 2 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript On GM's side, the problem was small cars. Under government emission guidelines, General Motors had to build them, but they always lost money for GM, and they were lousy quality. So Toyota suggested a joint venture that o�ered two things. First, Toyota would build a quality small car for GM-- one that would �nally turn a pro�t. Je�rey Liker And the second thing was, we have this thing called the Toyota production system, and it produces the quality you see. We could teach you the Toyota production system. Frank Lang�� Je�rey Liker is a professor of industrial engineering at the University of Michigan. He's been studying Japanese auto manufacturing, including NUMMI, since the 1980s, and wrote a book about it called The Toyota Way. He says even though Toyota was o�ering GM something quite remarkable-- to teach a competitor its secrets, to show them exactly how Toyota achieved such phenomenal reliability-- GM wasn't that interested. Je�rey Liker Some people in GM, I think, had some foresight to realize this is important. I think for many of the senior leaders, it was more, OK, well, maybe I'll learn something, maybe I won't, but it won't hurt. Frank Lang�� Why wouldn't they be really interested in the Toyota production system? Because at that point, wasn't Toyota building higher quality cars? Je�rey Liker Toyota was building higher quality cars. I'm not sure it was 100% accepted at that time by senior management that Japanese quality was really be�er. Frank Lang�� Why? Je�rey Liker I think there was pride and defensiveness. I'm proud because I'm the biggest automaker in the world. I've been the best. I've dominated the market. You can't teach me anything, you li�le Japanese company. John Shook I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Toyota and Toyota City was completely Japanese when I joined them. I was the �rst non-Japanese to join them as a regular employee in Toyota City. Frank Lang�� John Shook moved to Japan in the early 1980s because of his fascination with Japanese management techniques. He read books about them back home in east Tennessee. And he decided to �y halfway around the globe, learn to speak the language, and hunt for a job with the biggest Japanese company that would have him. Toyota hired him to train American workers in the joint venture. Now, here was the problem that pushed Toyota into the deal. They needed to learn how to build cars in America. For years, the Japanese had been winning away customers from Detroit-- so many that now the US Congress was threatening to restrict car imports. Toyota could avoid that by making cars in the US. But they wanted a partner. Here's John Shook. John Shook Toyota was looking speci�cally for things they could learn. How can we work with American workers? How can we make sure that our management system can work in North America? And they'd been pre�y happy just producing in Toyota City, doing a very good job. And the idea of actually taking their system and producing outside of Toyota City was scary to them. Frank Lang�� Toyota was right to be scared. Compared to Japan, where auto workers and management worked together, labor relations in America were more like war. And at the GM plant in Fremont, it felt at times like hand to hand combat. 3 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript A former running back from the University of Arkansas named Bruce Lee ran the western region for the United Auto Workers, and was in charge of the Fremont Union Local 1364. Now, normally, somebody like Bruce Lee is supposed to defend his union members no ma�er what, but even he says they were awful. Bruce Lee It was considered the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United States. And it was a reputation that was well-earned. Everything was a �ght. They spent more time on grievances and on things like that than they did on producing cars. They had strikes all the time. It was just chaos constantly. Je�rey Liker The Fremont, California plant for General Motors was bad by GM standards. And GM's average was bad by Toyota standards. So this is the worst among the bad, mediocre plants in GM. Frank Lang�� Again, that's Je�rey Liker, who has interviewed workers and management at Fremont for his research. Je�rey Liker One of the expressions was, you can buy anything you want in the GM plant in Fremont. If you want sex, if you want drugs, if you want alcohol, it's there. During breaks, during lunchtime, if you want to gamble illegally-- any illegal activity was available for the asking within that plant. Frank Lang�� Sounds like prison. Je�rey Liker Actually, the analogy to prison is a good analogy, because the workers were stuck there because they could not �nd anything close to that level of job and pay and bene�ts at their level of education and skill. So they were trapped there. And they also felt like we have a job for life, and the union will always protect us. So we're stuck here, and it's long term. And then all these illegal things crop up, so we can entertain ourselves while we're stuck here. Rick Madrid A lot of booze on the line. I mean, it was just amazing. And as long as you did your job, they really didn't care. Frank Lang�� What kind of booze? What were people drinking? Rick Madrid Whiskey, gin. Frank Lang�� That's Rick Madrid. He began working at the plant in 1955. He mounted tires on Chevy trucks. Rick Madrid When I was mounting tires, we'd drink. I'd bring a thermos of screwdrivers with me. But I never was into drugs. Frank Lang�� Sex? Rick Madrid Love it. Frank Lang�� Did you ever have sex at the plant? Rick Madrid Yeah. Frank Lang�� Frequently? 4 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Rick Madrid I wasn't that fortunate. Peter Ross There was a guy in here, he would be selling pot. Frank Lang�� Peter Ross repaired machinery on the assembly line at GM. Peter Ross I'd be walking through the plant with my tools and my radio, and you see a big cloud of smoke. You don't want to inhale it. You'd get a contact high. Frank Lang�� If you're wondering how people kept their jobs, well, back then, the UAW was still quite powerful. Under the union contract, it was almost impossible to �re anybody. And if management ticked o� the union, workers could just shut the plant down in minutes. With that sort of leverage, absenteeism became absurd. On a normal day, one out of �ve workers just didn't show up. It was even worse on Mondays. Billy Haggerty worked in hood and fender assembly. He says so few workers showed up some mornings, management couldn't start the line. Billy Haggerty They brought a lot of people o� the street to �ll in when they didn't have enough people. Frank Lang�� Who would they �nd? Billy Haggerty Go right across the street to the bar and grab people out of there and bring them in. Frank Lang�� Workers �led grievances, formal complaints against management, over all kinds of things. Someone who isn't your boss asks you to clean something up? Hit them with a grievance. A manager steps in to do a job that isn't his? Grievance. The strategy was simple. Pile up grievances, real or imagined, by the thousands, then use them to squeeze money or concessions out of management. And Fremont workers struck back at their bosses in other ways. They'd intentionally screw up the vehicles, put Coke bo�les or loose bolts inside the door panels so they'd ra�le and annoy the customer. They'd scratch cars. Richard Aguilar inspected vehicles at the plant. He saw one guy do something even worse. Richard Aguilar He le� some loose bolts on this front suspension. That was dangerous. I went and told the assistant manager right away. They went out there, and they checked it, and there were like 400 cars he'd done that too. He was mad because they had suspended him for drinking. Frank Lang�� By 1982, GM had had enough, and put the Fremont factory out of its misery. The company laid o� thousands of workers and closed the plant. The next year, when GM and Toyota began planning to reopen the plant for the joint venture, there was one thing neither company wanted to do-- hire the same union leaders who'd ba�led management and overseen GM's worst workforce. Then the UAW's Bruce Lee sat down with Chairman Eiji Toyoda. Bruce Lee And one of the �rst things I said is, I've got to hire the �rst 50 people. Frank Lang�� So who did you hire? Bruce Lee The same leadership that was in the union before. 5 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Frank Lang�� Why? I thought you would try to get rid of them. Bruce Lee No, no, because I believed that it was the system that made it bad, not the people. Frank Lang�� GM was against it, but incredibly, Toyota agreed. Toyota execs believed their system would turn bad workers into good ones. Then Lee had to sell the plan to the rank and �le. He held a meeting and told union members that Fremont would now be a Japanese style plant. Old seniority rules wouldn't apply. Life at the plant would be totally di�erent. The workers hated all this. Bruce Lee They didn't want anything changed. They wanted the plant to open exactly how it was when General Motors had it. Frank Lang�� Bad cars and all? Bruce Lee That's what they wanted. Frank Lang�� They even hung Lee in e�gy. But Lee had something very powerful on his side. Most of the workers desperately needed jobs. And Lee had them. When NUMMI opened, over 85% of the workforce were old hands from GM Fremont. But to prepare them for that moment, in the spring of 1984, Toyota started �ying them to Japan in groups of 30 to begin learning the Toyota system for making cars. John Shook Well, when the NUMMI workers �rst came to Japan, me, as well as certainly my Japanese bosses, had heard all these horrible things about the American worker, about the American union. Frank Lang�� As the one American working in Toyota City, John Shook helped design this training. John Shook And we had certainly heard all these stories about the workforce there at the Fremont plant, and it was our job to show them a new and very di�erent way of working. What would they do? How would they respond to this? How would they react? And no one knew. I didn't know. So everyone was very, very nervous. Earl Ferguson I was kind of apprehensive about what I was going to see when I arrived in Japan. Frank Lang�� On one of those planes was Earl Ferguson. He'd been working for GM since 1964. Frank Lang�� What were you apprehensive about? Earl Ferguson Whether they were going to accept us or not, you know? How they were going to react when the Americans landed in Tokyo. Everything was so new to us, you know? This was just a totally new experience. John Shook So I will never forget. Frank Lang�� Again, John Shook. John Shook Taking a bus, a large bus, with my small group of Japanese colleagues to pick up the �rst group of trainees arriving from Fremont. Television cameras were there, because this was big news in Japan at that time. And as they got o� the plane, we had signs welcoming them. 6 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Earl Ferguson News media was everywhere. We were signing autographs and taking pictures with all the young kids. Totally new experience. John Shook Most of them had never been out of the United States before, and none of them, certainly, had ever been to Japan. Les Myers My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I've worked at General Motors for 25 years. My hobbies are �shing and bowling. Japanese Auto Worker My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. My hobby is so�ball. Frank Lang�� The narrator in this Japanese public television program points out that the American worker is nine years older than his Toyota trainer. He also notes for his Japanese viewers that the Americans are so much larger than the Japanese, they waste a second or two more each time they get in and out of the vehicles they're building, which makes them 10% to 15% less productive than their Asian counterparts. The key to the Toyota production system was a principle so basic it sounds like an empty management slogan. Teamwork. Back home in Fremont, GM supervisors ordered around large groups of workers. At the Takaoka plant, people were divided into teams of just four or �ve, switched jobs every few hours to relieve the monotony, and a team leader would step in to help whenever anything went wrong. Again, Professor Je�rey Liker and Toyota's John Shook. Je�rey Liker And they spent about two weeks, and they worked in a Toyota plant. John Shook Hooked up at the hip with a counterpart in the Corolla plant, someone who did the exact same job you'd be doing back in Fremont. Je�rey Liker And they start to do the job, and they were pre�y proud, because they were building cars back in the United States. And they wanted to show they could do it within the time allo�ed, and they would usually get behind, and they would struggle, and they would try to catch up. And at some point, somebody would come over and say, do you want me to help? And that was a revelation, because nobody in the GM plant would ever ask to help. They would come and yell at you because you got behind. John Shook Really, we wanted to give them a chance to see and experience a di�erent way of doing things. We wanted them to see the culture there, the way people worked together to solve problems. Je�rey Liker Then, the biggest surprise was if, when they had those problems, a�erwards, somebody would come up to them and say, what are your ideas for improvement so we don't have that problem again? Frank Lang�� So they'd make suggestions for a di�erent kind of tool that would be be�er for the job, or a di�erent place for bolts and parts to sit that would be easier to reach. Je�rey Liker They couldn't believe that responsiveness. I can't remember any time in my working life where anybody asked for my ideas to solve the problem. And they literally want to know. And when I tell them, they listen, and then suddenly they disappear, and somebody comes back with the tool that I just described. It's built, and they say try this. 7 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Frank Lang�� Under the Toyota system, everyone's expected to be looking for ways to improve the production process all the time, to make the workers' job easier and more e�cient, to shave extra steps and extra seconds o� each worker's job. To spot defects in the cars and the causes of those defects. This is the Japanese concept of kaizen, continuous improvement. When a worker makes a suggestion that saves money, he gets a bonus of a few hundred dollars or so. And if you look around the Toyota plant, you can see the result of all those improvements. Hanging shelves that travel along with the car and the worker, carrying the parts and bolts they need within easy reach. Special cushions they throw into the car frames when they have to kneel inside. Workers' tasks have been streamlined to the fewest possible steps, each step timed down to the second. Billy Haggerty Two seconds to pick up a bolt and put it on. Two seconds to take a gun and tighten it down. Frank Lang�� Billy Haggerty learned the Japanese system two decades into his tenure at GM Fremont. Billy Haggerty Everything was timed out. Such and such takes such and such long to do. That's the way you did it. At General Motors, you could be running in circles for whatever you were doing, and that's the way it is. You lose time. A car a minute don't seem like it's moving that fast, but when you don't get it, you're in the hole. There's nobody to pull you out at General Motors, so you're going to let something go. Frank Lang�� All those mistakes added up at a GM plant, and the results were li�ered around the lots outside. Hundreds of misassembled cars. Cars that came o� the line missing parts, cars that needed to be �xed before they could be shipped out to the dealers. In a Toyota plant, there was nothing like this. Why did a GM plant produce so many screwed up cars? One cardinal rule that everybody in the company knew. Billy Haggerty The line could never stop. Never stop the line. Frank Lang�� Again, Billy Haggerty, Je�rey Liker, Rick Madrid, and Bruce Lee. Billy Haggerty Someone have a heart a�ack, kick him out of the way, keep that line running. Je�rey Liker It was a basic sin. You're violating the Ten Commandments. Rick Madrid You just don't see the line stop. I saw a guy fall in the pit, and they didn't stop the line. Bruce Lee You saw a problem, you stopped that line, you were �red. Frank Lang�� A long time GM manager named Ernie Schaefer explained why. Ernie Schaefer Because the theory was, they'll stop it all the time. They don't want to work, you know? They want to sit and play cards or whatever. That was a free break for them if the line stopped, so you wouldn't give them the ability to stop the line. Frank Lang�� John Shook, the American who helped Toyota design its training program, says this all goes back to the �rst assembly line created by Henry Ford. 8 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript John Shook What Henry Ford had basically designed was a system that he wanted the people on the �oor to simply get the volume out. Get the product out the door. And someone later will worry about the quality. If we have to repair it, we'll repair it. So one of the most fundamental things that Toyota did was take that and turn it on its head. So now we tell the plant �oor, don't you worry about the production volume. You worry about quality. The last thing we want is to have a lot of defects �owing down the line that we have to repair later. Billy Haggerty Toyota's philosophy was quality, not quantity. Frank Lang�� In his old GM job, Billy Haggerty put on hoods and fenders and saw lots of mistakes go right down the line. Billy Haggerty So we had Monte Carlos with Regal front ends and vice versas, and they would just stick it on, run it out to the yard, and then change. Frank Lang�� And what they look like, the cars? Billy Haggerty Half Regals and half-- [LAUGHTER]. So those things would go out the door, into the yard, and be �xed out there. I did a lot of overtime in the yard, changing things back. Frank Lang�� Workers told me they saw cars with engines put in backwards, cars without steering wheels or breaks. Some were so messed up they wouldn't start, and had to be towed o� the line. Fixing them piled on more costs, and sometimes, taking them apart and pu�ing them back together, workers damaged them even more. On the �oor of the NUMMI plant in Fremont, Earl Ferguson showed me Toyota's solution to all this. It's a thin nylon rope that hangs on hooks along the assembly line, which became a symbol of everything that was di�erent about the Japanese way of making cars-- the andon cord. Earl Ferguson These cords hanging down, that's the andon cord. That will stop the line. If he pulls the andon cord, then this light's going to come on right here. Then it'll show up on the screen that this location is down. Frank Lang�� It also plays a surprisingly cheerful li�le song. Workers in each area can pick the tune. You hear it all the time in a Toyota plant. The �rst pull doesn't stop the line. It summons team leaders to the location. They try to correct the problem, and usually, they can do it quickly without stopping production. But if they fail, the line stops. Earl Ferguson Then they'll correct the problem. Then they can pull the andon cord again, and the line will start. Frank Lang�� Now, when was the �rst time you ever pulled an andon cord? Earl Ferguson 1984. Frank Lang�� Where did you do it? Earl Ferguson In Japan. Frank Lang�� Were you at all nervous, because you'd been taught for so many years never to stop the 9 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript line? Earl Ferguson Yeah. And it was really exciting. Rick Madrid What got me was the fact that they had a cross bolt, and they stopped the line to repair it. Frank Lang�� That's Rick Madrid, the worker who brought a thermos full of vodka and OJ to work every day at GM. What he saw in Japan was a kind of a bolt-- a cross bolt-- that they'd put in wrong. Rick Madrid And they stopped the line and repaired it, which is take the bolt out, ream the hole, put the bolt back in, instead of sending it on and pu�ing all the other junk on top of it so you have to take it o� and repair it. And whoever puts it back isn't skilled in pu�ing trim back, so they're going to mess up. That impression, I said, gee, that makes sense. Fix it now so you don't have to go through all this stu�. That's when it dawned on me that we can do it. One bolt. One bolt changed my a�itude. Je�rey Liker I think that there was a combination of feelings. One feeling was, wow, this is di�erent. Frank Lang�� Again, that's industrial engineering professor Je�rey Liker. Je�rey Liker Another feeling was of embarrassment. We've been in this industry for how many years? My whole adult life. We're Americans. We're supposed to be the best, most important country in the world, and we can't build a quality car. And these Japanese are doing it. And there was a sense of hurt pride. Earl Ferguson Well, it was kind of-- you become a li�le bit ashamed, because why couldn't we do that? Frank Lang�� Again, Earl Ferguson. Earl Ferguson You know, I think most of it was pride a�er that. We wanted to be able to compete with what I saw in Japan. I said, I know we can do what they can do. John Shook Only two weeks later, when that �rst group le� to go back to Fremont-- Frank Lang�� Toyota trainer, John Shook. John Shook We had a party, of course. A sushi party. And this was years ago, before sushi was as it is now. It was a rare thing, of course. And people were crying on both sides. You had union workers, grizzled old folks that had worked on the plant �oor for 30 years, and they were hugging their Japanese counterparts, just absolutely in tears. Frank Lang�� There's actually footage of this, though we don't know if it's the �rst group of Americans. The US workers are in kimonos with the Toyota name on them, and they hand their neck ties to the Japanese and hug. One man is crying. Auto Worker [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Frank Lang�� One of the Americans says, in Japanese, \\"Thanks to you all, we now feel con�dent for our success.\\" John Shook. 10 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript John Shook And it might sound �owery to say 25 years later, but they had such a powerful, emotional experience of learning a new way of working-- a way that people could actually work together collaboratively as a team. We knew it wasn't going to be easy. There were a lot of hurdles to overcome. But there was no question in anyone's mind that this was going to work. Frank Lang�� But if it was going to work, it would mean a radically di�erent relationship between workers and management-- one where the managers trusted the workers to let them pull the andon cord and stop the line. One where the workers trusted their bosses enough to ask for help when there were problems. Auto Worker With teamwork, we can do it all. Now let's hold up your hands and together, with teamwork, we can do it all! Frank Lang�� December 1984, the �rst car rolled o� the assembly line in Fremont-- a yellow Chevy Nova. UAW rep Joel Smith was one of the speakers. Joel Smith Mr. Toyoda, sta�, and fellow UAW members, today is a historic one. The �rst car. But we're also on the threshold of a new adventure and relationship between labor and management. For too long, the American worker has been maligned, criticized, called bad names, for building lousy products, poor quality American worker. At New United Motor, we will build a quality car, and we will only build a quality car. And Mr. Toyoda, if you would please deliver this challenge to our friends in Japan-- we intend to build the best quality car in the world. Thank you. Bruce Lee They hit the ground running. It didn't take a year, two years to get quality in that product. Frank Lang�� Again, the UAW's Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee Oh, I was so proud of them, you can't believe. The fact that they did it didn't surprise me that much, but how quickly they did it did. It was amazing. Here were these same people who before, I mean, were-- hell, they'd go out of their way to make life miserable for General Motors particularly. And, you know, they were old, they were fat, because that was not a young workforce that we brought in here. Frank Lang�� The numbers coming out of the NUMMI plant were astonishing. Again, here's Je�rey Liker. Je�rey Liker The best measure they use is how many defects are there per 100 vehicles. And it was one of the best in America. And it was the same for the Toyota cars that were made in California as the Corollas that were coming from Japan, right from the beginning. Frank Lang�� Maryann Keller, a long time car analyst, devotes a chapter to NUMMI in her book about the rise and fall of GM, Rude Awakening. A�er just three months, she says, the cars coming o� the line were ge�ing near perfect quality ratings. And just as important for GM were the cost savings. One study suggested, remarkably, it would probably take 50% more workers under the old system to build the same car. Grievances and absenteeism plummeted, and lots of workers preferred the NUMMI teamwork system to the old combative one at GM. Several told us they enjoyed coming to work for the �rst time. Rick Madrid I didn't want to tell people I worked at the Chevy truck plant, because a lot of people had a lot of problems with them. 11 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Frank Lang�� That's Rick Madrid, who spent 17 years at the old Fremont plant building Chevy trucks. He was ashamed of that vehicle. At NUMMI, making the Nova, he felt di�erently. Rick Madrid Oh, I had a stack of these postcards. And I would just drive around. If I'd see a Nova parked, I would put one of these under the windshield wiper. Of course, it had my name, my address on it, and your opinion of the Nova? And just basically, they'd drop me a line, and a lot of people did this. Frank Lang�� And what did they say? Rick Madrid Some said they really liked it-- a quality car. A good car. Frank Lang�� Another worker told me he'd go to the Chevy dealership to stare at the Novas. He didn't tell anyone he built them, or that he worked at NUMMI. He just liked seeing what the cars looked like, si�ing there on the lot. Ira Glass That's NPR's Frank Lang��. Coming up, so there's this great way of making cars. GM is using it in California, and not only are the cars more reliable, they're cheaper to make. Seems like a no brainer for GM. Start pu�ing this way of producing cars into their other factories everywhere, and declare victory. Why they didn't do that, why what happened at NUMMI stayed at NUMMI for so long-- that's in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues. Act Two: Act Two Ira Glass It's This American Life. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. If you're just tuning in, we're in the middle of a story about a car plant in Fremont, California called NUMMI. We now turn to the question, why was it so hard for GM to replicate NUMMI elsewhere in the company? Why didn't this idea spread decades ago? In the �rst half of our story, we heard a lot from workers who were on the factory �oor. In this half of the story, the action moves to their bosses-- the supervisors at GM-- who had a chance to turn the company around with what they learned at NUMMI. Again, here's NPR's Frank Lang��. Frank Lang�� GM had go�en the �rst thing it wanted out of NUMMI-- a high quality small car. Now the question was, how could it spread the lessons of NUMMI throughout the rest of the company? To do that, it set up a special liaison o�ce. Managers were �own in for tours and to work the assembly line for a few days to learn the team concept. And from the beginning, GM executives sent 16 of their rising stars to help start NUMMI, with the idea that later, they'd come home and change the company. Two Wall Street Journal reporters later dubbed them the NUMMI commandos. One of the 16 was Mark Hogan. He says the top brass understood NUMMI's game changing potential, that a Toyota style plant squeezed many more cars out of far fewer workers. Mark Hogan If General Motors was able to take its many manufacturing facilities and implement that production system, it meant billions to General Motors in the bo�om line. Steve Bera We were ready. We were �red, and we had the mental condition that says, we're going to do this. We're going to change the world. Frank Lang�� That's Steve Bera, another commando. He says once NUMMI was up and running, he and the other 15 waited to be deployed elsewhere for the next phase of their mission. But the company didn't seem to 12 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript know what to do with them. Steve Bera Instead of coming back to the 16 of us and saying, there's some secret sauce here. What is it? How can we use this to our advantage? No one ever asked us that question. Frank Lang�� Why didn't they do that? Steve Bera It was never part of a master plan. And if there was a master plan, none of us ever saw it. Frank Lang�� Frustrated, Bera quit a�er just two years at NUMMI. With no master plan from Detroit, the �rst real a�empt to do NUMMI again came from a factory manager, 400 miles south of Fremont, at a plant in Van Nuys. The factory was facing a possible shutdown. Its manager, a guy named Ernie Schaefer, had visited NUMMI, and he thought maybe he could save his plant if he adopted the Japanese system. But he didn't have all the advantages Fremont had. This time, Toyota wasn't a partner in the experiment. GM had to transform Van Nuys on its own. Ernie Schaefer knew it was going to be tough. Ernie Schaefer The thing that I think kept us moving forward is we had no alternative. I mean, it was pre�y well known that if we didn't successfully implement this philosophy in Van Nuys, we weren't going to be around. Frank Lang�� Van Nuys made Firebirds and Camaros, and its reputation wasn't much be�er than GM Fremont's had been-- defective cars coming o� the line, ba�les with the union, sabotage. So Ernie Schaefer enlisted the same UAW leader who got the union on board at NUMMI, Bruce Lee, to help him win over the Van Nuys workforce. They shut down the plant for two weeks to train everyone in team concept and quality control. For this workforce, there were no trips to Japan, no tearful sushi parties. And from the start, workers were skeptical. Larry Spiegel The lack of receptiveness to change was so deep. Frank Lang�� Larry Spiegel was another NUMMI commando. He moved down to Van Nuys to help launch the Japanese system there. Larry Spiegel There were too many people convinced that they didn't need to have to change. Frank Lang�� Hadn't General Motors threatened to close the plant? Larry Spiegel They didn't believe them. Frank Lang�� Why? Larry Spiegel It's not logical. They just didn't. Frank Lang�� This was one of the biggest di�erences between Fremont and Van Nuys. Van Nuys hadn't been shut down. Turns out it's a lot easier to get workers to change if they've lost their jobs, and then you o�er them back. Without that, many union members just saw the Toyota system as a threat. And they had a point. Under the Japanese system, Van Nuys stood to lose a fourth of its workforce, because the more e�cient a plant becomes, the fewer workers it needs. And just as bad, the team concept hurt their seniority rights. This had been a problem for union members back at NUMMI also. 13 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Richard Aguilar Your seniority is what you work for. To me, that's what a union's about. Seniority. Frank Lang�� Richard Aguilar worked at NUMMI, and to him, seniority was just another way of saying fairness. He waited 15 years to get enough seniority for the job he'd always wanted in the plant. Under the new system, management could just hire someone o� the street for that job. The whole idea of seniority placing you into one great job for years was impossible under the team concept. Workers had to learn every job on their team and take turns doing those jobs. Richard Aguilar And the team concept, it sounds good. I mean, team player sounds good, but it pit worker against worker. It really does. Frank Lang�� This was the other thing Richard hated about the Japanese system. The whole point of a union, its most basic principle, was to protect you from management. But once people were working in teams, Richard says union members started doing things for management that just seemed wrong. Richard Aguilar People now snitched on each other. You know, they'd point �ngers. Oh, he's not doing this job right, you know, or she's not doing the job right. And they would even keep track of stu� they'd missed, because that's what the company puts on them-- that the only way you can protect your job, you have to keep the team strong. So there's a weak link, you've got to get rid of that weak link. And I would go tell them, you can't do that. You can't build a case for management against a union member. It made me angry and disappointed that the union had go�en so backwards that they'd forgo�en what a union meant-- taking care of each other. Frank Lang�� At Van Nuys, it wasn't just union members who resisted the Japanese system. Managers were against it too. Like the union members, they didn't want change. There were things they liked about the old system. It gave them privileges and perks they'd now be losing. For instance, some managers opposed the idea of stopping the assembly line, because their bonuses depended on the number of cars that rolled o� the line. Never mind how many defects they had. And now that workers and managers were supposed to be a team, executives and workers would share the same cafeteria and same parking lot, as equals. Managers at NUMMI didn't have a problem with that, but the managers at Van Nuys? Bruce Lee They rioted. Frank Lang�� The UAW's Bruce Lee remembers ge�ing a phone call from plant supervisor Ernie Schaefer about his managers. Bruce Lee They basically told Ernie, you do that and we're out of here. We're going to quit en masse. Because Ernie called me, and he said, Bruce, I can't do it. I can't do those things. I said, just think about it. That's a nothing. So they have to walk 20 yards more. I said, isn't that foolish that some grown man would come up and tell you, I'm going to quit if I can't have this parking place right here? Frank Lang�� So people fought the new system from both sides. Managers gave Ernie grief, and a dissident faction sprang up in the local union, which elected a staunch opponent of the Japanese system as their chairman. And as if that all wasn't enough, Ernie Schaefer ran into another obstacle. Workers could only build cars as good as the parts they were given. At NUMMI, many of the parts came from Japan and were really good. At Van Nuys, it was totally di�erent. 14 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Ernie Schaefer That was perhaps one of our biggest failures in that an isolated plant can't do this by itself. Frank Lang�� The team concept stressed continuous improvement. If a team got a shipment of parts that didn't �t, they'd alert their bosses, who'd then go to the suppliers to �x the problem. Sometimes they'd realize the problem was in the part's design, and Toyota engineers would go back to the drawing board and remake the part to address the problem workers were having on the assembly line. All the departments in the company worked together. But Ernie's suppliers had never operated in a system like that. If he asked for �xes, they blew him o�. And if he called Detroit and asked them to redesign a part that wasn't working, they'd ask him, why was he so special? They didn't have to change it for any other plant. Why should they change it for him? Ernie Schaefer You had asked the question earlier, what's di�erent when you walk into the NUMMI plant? Well, you can see a lot of things di�erent. But the one thing you don't see is the system that supports the NUMMI plant. I don't think at that time, anybody understood the large nature of this system. General Motors was a kind of throw it over the wall organization. You know, each department-- we were very compartmentalized, and you'd design that vehicle, and you'd throw it over the wall to the manufacturing guys. Frank Lang�� And if something didn't work, or was impossible to assemble, that was their problem. Ernie Schaefer And they had to deal with it. And, I mean, you're in there. You've kind of put your heart and soul into making this whole team concept work. And now you're the messenger that has to go out and say, look, guys, even though this is the way the system's supposed to work, and these are my issues, I'm not going to be able to solve them, and you're going to have to deal with it. And it was destructive. It was detrimental. I mean, no question about it. Frank Lang�� Schaefer says when he realized how much of the Japanese system happened o� the factory �oor, it answered something that had never quite made sense to him. Why had Toyota been so open with GM in showing its operations? Ernie Schaefer You know, they never prohibited us from walking through the plant, understanding, even asking questions of some of their key people. You know, I've o�en puzzled over that-- why they did that. And I think they recognized we were asking all the wrong questions. We didn't understand this bigger picture thing. All of our questions were focused on the �oor, you know? The assembly plant. What's happening on the line. That's not the real issue. The issue is, how do you support that system with all the other functions that have to take place in the organization? Frank Lang�� Quality at Van Nuys didn't improve, and in 1992, GM shut the plant down for good, leaving 2,600 people without jobs. This is what the NUMMI commandos were up against. Entrenched, defensive bureaucracies and workers many of the places they turned. They were not only trying to change the biggest corporation in the world. They were trying to change a corporation that had been essentially a collection of individual car companies-- Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick-- each with its own design team, own leadership, and its own way of doing things. 15 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Dick Fuller It's a whole new process, a whole di�erent process, than the one they had grown up with. And it was a huge threat. Frank Lang�� Dick Fuller was another commando. He ran the information technology division at NUMMI, which used some of the same streamlining concepts employed on the factory �oor. He says when GM managers visited NUMMI, instead of trying to �gure out how they could bene�t from the system, some of them a�acked it. Fuller remembers one IT manager who visited from a plant on the East Coast. Dick Fuller And when he came back, he wrote a report, which, if I put a title on it, would say, won't work here. And I think part of that was a threat to him. It was a threat to him to see that it was working so well. Frank Lang�� Do you think this guy looked at this and said, well, if this works here, and they try to spread it, I'll lose my job? Dick Fuller Well, I don't think he was going to lose his job, but he'd probably have to give up half his sta�, you know? So that's power. It's people that's power in General Motors. Frank Lang�� Ge�ing all these mini empires to embrace the kinds of radical changes that happened at NUMMI would have taken an almost Stalinesque leadership from above-- a combination of charisma and fury in the corner o�ce. And NUMMI commando Mark Hogan says no one at GM �t that bill. Mark Hogan I was very convinced that we had to change, and we had to change rapidly. And I think all of us that were NUMMI alums, so to speak, were frustrated at the lack of urgency. Frank Lang�� Did you have those kinds of conversations with people in the '80s back in Detroit? Mark Hogan I did. Frank Lang�� What would people say to you? Mark Hogan Yeah. I think there still wasn't a recognition that the formidability of the competition, particularly from Toyota-- I think a lot of people were in denial, or just not willing to recognize it. And even though GM had gone from 50% market share in the early '70s to mid-30s, it was gradual over time, and there wasn't the sense of reaction or urgency that other companies that lost that much market share might have felt. Frank Lang�� Those exact numbers? GM went from 47% of the US market in the mid-1970s to 35% a decade later. One reason car execs were in denial was Detroit's insular culture. Yes, unions and management were always at each other's throats, and yes, GM and its suppliers had a destructive relationship that seemed to almost discourage quality. But everyone had se�led into comfortable roles in this dysfunctional system and learned to live with it. And in the late 1980s, with their market share in freefall, Je�rey Liker says they were more apt to blame others than themselves. Je�rey Liker I worked with all the big three, at the time, automakers, and it was common in all three automakers. They all believed that if the consumers think we have quality problems, it's because Consumer Reports is misleading them, and they're biased toward Toyota. They all believed that Consumer Reports was against them-- that there was somewhat of a myth of Japanese quality. Frank Lang�� If all of that wasn't enough to stymie a�empts to learn from NUMMI, GM was distracted by other projects-- massive projects. It bought Ross Perot's company, Electronic Data Systems. It bought Hughes 16 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Aircra� for 5 billion. It decided the future was robotics. It decided the future was a massive, costly reorganization. It started Saturn, which produced cars that were be�er marketed than they were built. Then came the 1991 recession. Car sales slumped. Again, Mark Hogan. Mark Hogan It was really its �rst signi�cant wake up call. GM, unfortunately, had a massive loss in 1992. General Motors lost more than 20 billion. So I think at that point in time, there was a complete rethinking of the way we ran the company-- that things had to change, and they had to change fast. Frank Lang�� It was the largest loss in American corporate history to that time-- 23.5 billion. GM's board of directors responded with what the press called a boardroom bloodbath, purging a long list of managers. Jack Smith took over as CEO. He was the executive who led the negotiations with Toyota to create NUMMI. He saw NUMMI as a way forward for GM. Mark Hogan and some of the other commandos felt they �nally had a champion. Mark Hogan Jack Smith was installed, and started to rapidly implement the Toyota production system into General Motors. Frank Lang�� Rapidly by GM standards, which wasn't nearly rapidly enough. Jack Smith declined to talk to me for this story, but he told a reporter a few years ago, \\"I just wish it had happened a lot faster than it did.\\" Pick your nautical cliche. Reforming General Motors was like turning around a ba�leship, one manager said. Another compared it to steering the Titanic with a canoe paddle. Je�rey Liker says the cultural gap between NUMMI and the rest of GM was so vast that even with clear marching orders to change, some of the people running the company didn't know where to begin. Je�rey Liker There was no vocabulary, even, to explain it. I remember one of the GM managers was ordered from a very senior level-- it came from a vice president-- to make a GM plant look like NUMMI. And he said, I want you to go there with cameras and take a picture of every square inch. And whatever you take a picture of, I want it to look like that in our plant. There should be no excuse for why we're di�erent than NUMMI, why our quality is lower, why our productivity isn't as high, because you're going to copy everything you see. Immediately, this guy knew that was crazy. We can't copy employee motivation. We can't copy good relationships between the union and management. That's not something you can copy, and you can't even take a photograph of it. Frank Lang�� The �rst round of changes put andon cords and Japanese-style inventory control into the GM plants, but there was no change in the culture. Workers and managers continued their old antagonistic ways. In some of the factories where they installed the andon cord, workers got yelled at when they pulled it. A few plants even cut the cords down. So the second round of changes included some team concepts. They put together a book explaining how each plant should run and the reasoning behind it. Je� Weller was one of the people dispatched in the 1990s to convert the company plant by plant. Weller says some factory managers were receptive, but in the sprawling, decentralized system, the plant manager was still king, and ran the factory the way he wanted. Je� Weller We had some tough goes in some of our facilities, where we spent more time trying to convince the plant leadership versus actually going on and doing the implementation. I would say, I was asked in one plant to leave, because they were not interested in what I had to sell. 17 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Frank Lang�� How did he actually ask you to leave? What did he say? Je� Weller We're �nished, and you can leave. Frank Lang�� And what did you do? Je� Weller I le�, because, you know, I was in his home, so to speak. His territory. His plant. Frank Lang�� Now, whatever happened to that plant manager who asked you to leave? Je� Weller That plant manager eventually retired. Frank Lang�� This may sound like a naive question, but why didn't the CEO pick up the phone and say, you're �red? Je� Weller Well, it's a big company, and I'm not sure that, you know-- it doesn't work that way. Frank Lang�� Lots of people in GM still didn't see the need to change. By the late 1990s, the company was posting huge pro�ts selling trucks and SUVs, which made the loss in market share seem less urgent. To make real progress, managers had to leave the United States. One overhauled GM Germany. Mark Hogan took over GM Brazil in 1994 to enact NUMMI principles there. In Brazil, he had a big, unionized workforce, but he could avoid GM's bureaucracy, its supplier network, and the United Auto Workers. Frank Lang�� How long did it take you to implement the lessons of NUMMI in Brazil? Mark Hogan It took us about 18 to 24 months, which at the time, I was quite impatient about. I mean, I wanted it faster. Frank Lang�� And what did that mean for the bo�om line for GM? Mark Hogan Well, in that time frame, particularly '94 through '97, GM Brazil was one of the most pro�table entities within GM. Frank Lang�� But in America, everyone I talked to said it took about a decade and a half a�er NUMMI for change to even begin to take hold at GM. By the year 2000, GM �nally started to see a generational transformation. Je�rey Liker says so many managers had come through NUMMI for training for a day or a week or a year. Je�rey Liker Over time, you start to get 10 people, 20 people, 100 people, 300 people. And you now have a critical mass of people in GM who've all been in NUMMI. They've lived it. Now they're managing people and teaching them what they learned. And it snowballs, and suddenly, the world is di�erent at GM, and nobody can even tell you exactly why. Frank Lang�� By the early 2000s, GM had developed a production model with the UAW based on Japanese principles that would go into all of its plants. It was called the Global Manufacturing System. And although GM quality still lags behind the imports, it's improved a lot. Again, Je�rey Liker. Je�rey Liker If you look carefully at the quality of a GM product, and you look with a �ne tooth comb, with a magnifying glass, you're going to see a level of quality that you didn't see 15 years ago. 18 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript Frank Lang�� You want to show me for a sec? Do you mind? There's one right here. I did my interview with Je�rey Liker at the 2010 Detroit Auto Show, and we walked over to the GM exhibit, to the Cadillac SRX, which is a small SUV. Je�rey pointed to the gap between the doors and the car frame, which is supposed to be uniform. Je�rey Liker And if we look down here, it looks really good, right? The gap is about the same between the front and the back door. The surface is very smooth and very uniform. Frank Lang�� And 15 years ago, what would that have looked like? Je�rey Liker You would see maybe at the top, it would be more narrow than at the bo�om. If you look inside the car, and you open the glove box, it falls very gradually down the way it's supposed to. You close it-- I barely have to touch it, and it closes tightly. Frank Lang�� Precision in all these details makes for a be�er-looking, more reliable car, where things work like they're supposed to. But this improvement didn't come soon enough. Some cars and some plants improved less quickly than others. And while GM was ge�ing be�er, so were its competitors, leaving it still near the back of the pack. James Womack Well, one of the ironies of GM was that in the moment it went bankrupt, it was probably a be�er company than it had ever been. Frank Lang�� That's James Womack, co-author of a seminal book comparing the Toyota and GM production systems, The Machine That Changed the World. James Womack In the factories, they had really dramatically closed the productivity gap that they had had for many, many years. And on the new products, they have much be�er quality. So the company that failed was actually doing be�er than it had ever done. But it was too late, and that's really sort of hard to forgive-- that if you take 30 years to �gure it out, chances are you're going to get run over. And they got run over. Frank Lang�� In the end, what did them in was the 2008 recession. It destroyed the car market. The next year, General Motors became the largest industrial bankruptcy in US history. Its bailout cost taxpayers more than 50 billion. I asked Mark Hogan, the NUMMI commando who went on to run GM's small car division in North America, if GM had adopted NUMMI earlier, could it have really changed all that? Mark Hogan De�nitely. I think if General Motors had moved in the late '80s to implement the system across the board, it may very well have saved GM from going into bankruptcy. Frank Lang�� Explain that. Mark Hogan Well, I just think the productivity and the quality changes that come with that would have been so profound that this ever increasing loss of market share would have been stopped. Bruce Lee Well, I think they'd have been building a higher quality product. Frank Lang�� Again, the UAW's Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee You know, they sold junk for a while. Just any kind of piece of crap they could roll out there, they did. And they paid a tremendous price for it. And even when they turned the corner in quality, 19 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript people didn't trust them. They'd say, well, gee, they're building a good car now. Why aren't they buying them? Because they don't trust them. But had they adopted and embraced the team concept in an honest way, they were going to do this, I think it might have dramatically changed what happened in the American auto industry. There's no question in my mind. Frank Lang�� Of course, quality and reliability weren't the only problems that brought GM down. Executives made other big mistakes. Over the years, General Motors negotiated contracts with the UAW with such generous health care coverage that by 2007, it amounted to more than 1,600 for each vehicle GM produced in North America. And initially, some GM executives dismissed hybrid cars like the Prius as a publicity stunt. Instead, they bet the company on SUVs and trucks, only to see sales crash when gas hit 4.00 a gallon. Over the last decade, as GM became more like Toyota, Toyota became a li�le bit like GM. In 2008, it took over the title from GM of the world's largest automaker. But Toyota executives now say the company did this by making one of GM's old mistakes-- stressing quantity over quality. Akio Toyoda is the company CEO. He's the grandson of the founder, and cut his teeth at NUMMI. At a congressional hearing in 2010 about Toyota's sudden acceleration problems, he said the company's fatal mistake was growing too fast. Akio Toyoda We pursued growth over the speed at which we are able to develop our people and our organization, and I am deeply sorry for any accident that Toyota drivers have experienced. Frank Lang�� It was 15 years before GM took the lessons of NUMMI seriously, and it spent the next 10 years slowly implementing what it learned. And all the time, the NUMMI plant kept pumping out vehicles-- 6,000 a week on average, two shi�s a day. Toyota got what it wanted out of the deal. A year a�er starting NUMMI, it began opening other factories around the US, using what it had learned in Fremont. GM and Toyota continued to run NUMMI together until 2009, when GM went bankrupt and pulled out, leaving Toyota to run the plant alone. Toyota decided to shut the factory down. It was their only unionized plant in the United States. In April 2010, NUMMI produced its very last car-- a Corolla. 4,500 people lost their jobs. This is the �rst factory Toyota has shut down since it was founded 73 years ago. John Shook Toyota's not perfect. GM is not perfect. But I think anyone who touched NUMMI will never forget it. Frank Lang�� One last time, that's John Shook, the �rst American Toyota hired for NUMMI. John Shook It does represent something that was special at a point in time. It was a laboratory. My learning curve-- it wasn't just a curve. It was a 90 degree right angle. I loved every minute of it. And almost everyone I think you'll talk to who worked on NUMMI will say the same thing. Rick Madrid I'm so fortunate that I ended my career in the auto industry at NUMMI. Frank Lang�� Rick Madrid retired from the assembly line in 1992. Rick Madrid I just hate to see the plant close. Oh, that just hurts me. End of an era. It changed my life 20 of 22 2023-08-17, 12:11 p.m. 561: NUMMI (2015) - This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/transcript from being depressed, bored, and like my son said, changed my a�itude. It changed me all for the be�er. I really hate to see it go. Billy Haggerty I look at cars, and I see a lot of the cars that we built. Frank Lang�� That's Billy Haggerty, who ended up pu�ing in 18 years at NUMMI without a vacation day. He says just the other day he saw one. Billy Haggerty But I just seen-- what was it? An '86, '87 Corolla pull in right around the corner here. I was heading for the bank. And I just looked at it and said, boy, that one's old. And I looked down, and it was a Corolla. I know we built it right there. So it's still running. It's still kicking. It feels good. Frank Lang�� This is also NUMMI's legacy. In the end, it's not just a symbol for so many things that went wrong with GM. It's also a really good car plant. One that turned out nearly 8 million high-quality cars and trucks. Ira Glass Frank Lang��. When we �rst ran this story back in 2010, Frank was NPR's automotive correspondent. He's now their international correspondent based in Shanghai.

Be sure to defend your answer using evidence from the case","output":"Based on the information provided about organizational commitment and the details from the \\"NUMMI\\" case, it's possible to analyze the job commitment of employees at the GM plant prior to the alliance with Toyota using the three types of commitment: affective, continuance, and normative. Affective Commitment: Before the GM and Toyota alliance, the GM plant in Fremont was characterized by low morale, quality issues, and an adversarial relationship between management and employees. Evidence from the case suggests that affective commitment was extremely low, as workers exhibited behaviors such as absenteeism, alcohol consumption on the job, and even sabotage. They lacked an emotional attachment to the organization and their work, likely due to a toxic work environment and little sense of shared purpose or rewards. Continuance Commitment: Given the economic climate of the time and the nature of the job market, many employees at GM may have continued working there primarily because of the lack of alternatives or because of the high wages and benefits associated with unionized employment, rather than because of any particular loyalty to the company. This suggests that continuance commitment was a predominant factor, with employees feeling financially bound to the job despite the dissatisfaction they experienced. The case doesn't provide clear evidence of embeddedness, but given the historical context, some level of community ties or personal investment may have prevented employees from leaving. Normative Commitment: It is unlikely that employees had a strong normative commitment to GM. The adversarial culture and poor working conditions would have done little to instill a sense of obligation to remain with the company. If anything, the actions and attitudes of employees suggest they felt little or no obligation to contribute positively to the organization's success, and there is no indication that the company was making significant investments in its workers that might lead to feelings of reciprocity. In conclusion, prior to 1982, it seems that employees at GM had a low level of affective commitment due to an unfavorable working environment and relationships. Continuance commitment was perhaps the most significant factor, with employees staying because of economic necessity and a lack of perceived alternatives rather than positives about the organization. Normative commitment appears to have been minimal, with little sense of obligation reported on the part of the employees. The case evidence suggests that the primary reasons for staying were not due to a positive attachment to the company, but rather practical considerations and a lack of options."},{"instruction":"Transcript 561: NUMMI (2015) Note: This American Life is produced for the ear and designed to be heard.

Prologue Ira Glass Today, we have this story for you about cars-- American cars. And like a lot of stories about American cars, this one is more tragedy than comedy, although there is some comedy in there, too. The good news, of course, about American cars is that American cars are getting better, especially in the last few years. You've probably heard that. Michelle Krebs Well, at Ford, the Ford Fusion-- Consumer Reports named it a better car than the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord a few years ago. I think that was a major turning point. Ira Glass Michelle Krebs has been covering the auto industry for 35 years. She's now at autotrader.com. She says the reason American cars finally improved-- Michelle Krebs I think when you're on the brink of possible extinction, it wakes people up, and they started changing things. But that's what it took. I mean, that's why Ford came out with the Ford Fusion. They spent 23 billion-- borrowed 23 billion, because they were almost out of business. Ira Glass So basically, it's deathbed conversions. Michelle Krebs That's a good way to describe it. They decided, we have got to bet the ranch on building great cars that people really want to buy. They're still not all the way there yet. I mean, I think that's the simple fact of the matter. There's been progress, but it's been spotty. Ira Glass How spotty? When Consumer Reports rated the top 10 most reliable car brands this year, only one was American. 9 were foreign. 4 of the top 5, no surprise, were Japanese-- Toyota, Honda, Mazda, and Lexus. Why are most American cars still not as good as foreign cars? Why is it still taking Detroit so long to learn this lesson? It's not like this reliability problem just snuck up on them, right? General Motors, the biggest American car maker, started losing market share 50 years ago. Back in the 1960s, GM sold over half the cars in the United States, and then that number just slid lower and lower and lower for decades, until now, it's 18% of all cars sold in the US. Today's program came out of a question that we had here at the radio show. We genuinely did not understand why American car makers waited until they were nearly extinct-- two of them bankrupt, one of them nearly bankrupt. Why didn't they get on the ball and start making reliable cars that could compete with the Japanese decades ago? It seemed like, OK, you're running a business. You're losing sales in such a huge way. Why wouldn't you change? It really made no sense. And we looked around for an explanation, and we learned about this one car factory in California. Here. What happened at this factory not only illustrates some very interesting answers to that question, it captures a lot of what went wrong in the American car business in the last 35 years. This is a plant in Fremont, California, called NUMMI. NUMMI stands for New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated. A modern car plant, by the way, sounds a lot like a casino. The automated gear plays these little songs to let you know that it's running. Driverless robotic carts glide up and down the aisles like R2D2 delivering doors and other parts. Their song is supposed to warn you that they're coming. The story of this particular factory is actually a famous story among car people. It's taught at business schools. NUMMI was opened in 1984 by GM and Toyota together. The two companies decided that this would be a place that they would build cars with each other. And if it seems strange to you that two competitors would do this, it seemed strange at the time, also. A headline in Car and Driver about the partnership read, \\"Hell Freezes Over.\\" But both companies had their reasons. We'll get to those. At NUMMI, Toyota showed GM all of its secrets. Showed it exactly how it made some of the best-built, most reliable cars in the world back then. GM, at the time, hoped to take these lessons from NUMMI and carry them into all their other plants, all over the country and over the world. That was the 1980s. And then, well, you know, it didn't go well. GM was one of the car makers who went bankrupt. US taxpayers, you and I, we bailed them out for 50 billion. And NUMMI closed. This GM plant that seemed like it might be able to teach American car makers how to catch up to their competitors-- it stopped making cars for GM. The sounds that you're hearing right now-- they were recorded in 2010, in the last months before GM shuttered the place, on April Fools' Day that year. Back then, we put together this story that we're about to play for you today. For a few months before NUMMI closed, Frank Langfitt, who at the time was NPR's automotive correspondent, and one of our producers, Brian Reed, travelled around the country talking to GM workers and managers about what had happened at NUMMI. General Motors and the UAW-- they are secretive cultures. But as you're going to hear, people were blunt when they talked to Frank about this. They were blunt in a way that you rarely hear with auto executives and UAW reps when they're being interviewed by the press. Act One of our show is going to be about the rise of NUMMI. Act Two is where we get the answer to our question-- what prevented GM from learning from NUMMI for so many years? For WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Our show today produced with our colleagues at NPR News. And now it is my pleasure to turn the story over to Frank Langfitt. Act One: Act One Frank Langfitt When NUMMI was conceived, General Motors was far and away the world's largest car company. Its US market share was seven times that of Toyota. But each company had a problem that the other company could help them solve. On GM's side, the problem was small cars. Under government emission guidelines, General Motors had to build them, but they always lost money for GM, and they were lousy quality. So Toyota suggested a joint venture that offered two things. First, Toyota would build a quality small car for GM-- one that would finally turn a profit. Jeffrey Liker And the second thing was, we have this thing called the Toyota production system, and it produces the quality you see. We could teach you the Toyota production system. Frank Langfitt Jeffrey Liker is a professor of industrial engineering at the University of Michigan. He's been studying Japanese auto manufacturing, including NUMMI, since the 1980s, and wrote a book about it called The Toyota Way. He says even though Toyota was offering GM something quite remarkable-- to teach a competitor its secrets, to show them exactly how Toyota achieved such phenomenal reliability-- GM wasn't that interested. Jeffrey Liker Some people in GM, I think, had some foresight to realize this is important. I think for many of the senior leaders, it was more, OK, well, maybe I'll learn something, maybe I won't, but it won't hurt. Frank Langfitt Why wouldn't they be really interested in the Toyota production system? Because at that point, wasn't Toyota building higher quality cars? Jeffrey Liker Toyota was building higher quality cars. I'm not sure it was 100% accepted at that time by senior management that Japanese quality was really better. Frank Langfitt Why? Jeffrey Liker I think there was pride and defensiveness. I'm proud because I'm the biggest automaker in the world. I've been the best. I've dominated the market. You can't teach me anything, you little Japanese company. John Shook I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. Toyota and Toyota City was completely Japanese when I joined them. I was the first non-Japanese to join them as a regular employee in Toyota City. Frank Langfitt John Shook moved to Japan in the early 1980s because of his fascination with Japanese management techniques. He read books about them back home in east Tennessee. And he decided to fly halfway around the globe, learn to speak the language, and hunt for a job with the biggest Japanese company that would have him. Toyota hired him to train American workers in the joint venture. Now, here was the problem that pushed Toyota into the deal. They needed to learn how to build cars in America. For years, the Japanese had been winning away customers from Detroit-- so many that now the US Congress was threatening to restrict car imports. Toyota could avoid that by making cars in the US. But they wanted a partner. Here's John Shook. John Shook Toyota was looking specifically for things they could learn. How can we work with American workers? How can we make sure that our management system can work in North America? And they'd been pretty happy just producing in Toyota City, doing a very good job. And the idea of actually taking their system and producing outside of Toyota City was scary to them. Frank Langfitt Toyota was right to be scared. Compared to Japan, where auto workers and management worked together, labor relations in America were more like war. And at the GM plant in Fremont, it felt at times like hand to hand combat. A former running back from the University of Arkansas named Bruce Lee ran the western region for the United Auto Workers, and was in charge of the Fremont Union Local 1364. Now, normally, somebody like Bruce Lee is supposed to defend his union members no matter what, but even he says they were awful. Bruce Lee It was considered the worst workforce in the automobile industry in the United States. And it was a reputation that was well-earned. Everything was a fight. They spent more time on grievances and on things like that than they did on producing cars. They had strikes all the time. It was just chaos constantly. Jeffrey Liker The Fremont, California plant for General Motors was bad by GM standards. And GM's average was bad by Toyota standards. So this is the worst among the bad, mediocre plants in GM. Frank Langfitt Again, that's Jeffrey Liker, who has interviewed workers and management at Fremont for his research. Jeffrey Liker One of the expressions was, you can buy anything you want in the GM plant in Fremont. If you want sex, if you want drugs, if you want alcohol, it's there. During breaks, during lunchtime, if you want to gamble illegally-- any illegal activity was available for the asking within that plant. Frank Langfitt Sounds like prison. Jeffrey Liker Actually, the analogy to prison is a good analogy, because the workers were stuck there because they could not find anything close to that level of job and pay and benefits at their level of education and skill. So they were trapped there. And they also felt like we have a job for life, and the union will always protect us. So we're stuck here, and it's long term. And then all these illegal things crop up, so we can entertain ourselves while we're stuck here. Rick Madrid A lot of booze on the line. I mean, it was just amazing. And as long as you did your job, they really didn't care. Frank Langfitt What kind of booze? What were people drinking? Rick Madrid Whiskey, gin. Frank Langfitt That's Rick Madrid. He began working at the plant in 1955. He mounted tires on Chevy trucks. Rick Madrid When I was mounting tires, we'd drink. I'd bring a thermos of screwdrivers with me. But I never was into drugs. Frank Langfitt Sex? Rick Madrid Love it. Frank Langfitt Did you ever have sex at the plant? Rick Madrid Yeah. Frank Langfitt Frequently? Rick Madrid I wasn't that fortunate. Peter Ross There was a guy in here, he would be selling pot. Frank Langfitt Peter Ross repaired machinery on the assembly line at GM. Peter Ross I'd be walking through the plant with my tools and my radio, and you see a big cloud of smoke. You don't want to inhale it. You'd get a contact high. Frank Langfitt If you're wondering how people kept their jobs, well, back then, the UAW was still quite powerful. Under the union contract, it was almost impossible to fire anybody. And if management ticked off the union, workers could just shut the plant down in minutes. With that sort of leverage, absenteeism became absurd. On a normal day, one out of five workers just didn't show up. It was even worse on Mondays. Billy Haggerty worked in hood and fender assembly. He says so few workers showed up some mornings, management couldn't start the line. Billy Haggerty They brought a lot of people off the street to fill in when they didn't have enough people. Frank Langfitt Who would they find? Billy Haggerty Go right across the street to the bar and grab people out of there and bring them in. Frank Langfitt Workers filed grievances, formal complaints against management, over all kinds of things. Someone who isn't your boss asks you to clean something up? Hit them with a grievance. A manager steps in to do a job that isn't his? Grievance. The strategy was simple. Pile up grievances, real or imagined, by the thousands, then use them to squeeze money or concessions out of management. And Fremont workers struck back at their bosses in other ways. They'd intentionally screw up the vehicles, put Coke bottles or loose bolts inside the door panels so they'd rattle and annoy the customer. They'd scratch cars. Richard Aguilar inspected vehicles at the plant. He saw one guy do something even worse. Richard Aguilar He left some loose bolts on this front suspension. That was dangerous. I went and told the assistant manager right away. They went out there, and they checked it, and there were like 400 cars he'd done that too. He was mad because they had suspended him for drinking. Frank Langfitt By 1982, GM had had enough, and put the Fremont factory out of its misery. The company laid off thousands of workers and closed the plant. The next year, when GM and Toyota began planning to reopen the plant for the joint venture, there was one thing neither company wanted to do-- hire the same union leaders who'd battled management and overseen GM's worst workforce. Then the UAW's Bruce Lee sat down with Chairman Eiji Toyoda. Bruce Lee And one of the first things I said is, I've got to hire the first 50 people. Frank Langfitt So who did you hire? Bruce Lee The same leadership that was in the union before. Frank Langfitt Why? I thought you would try to get rid of them. Bruce Lee No, no, because I believed that it was the system that made it bad, not the people. Frank Langfitt GM was against it, but incredibly, Toyota agreed. Toyota execs believed their system would turn bad workers into good ones. Then Lee had to sell the plan to the rank and file. He held a meeting and told union members that Fremont would now be a Japanese style plant. Old seniority rules wouldn't apply. Life at the plant would be totally different. The workers hated all this. Bruce Lee They didn't want anything changed. They wanted the plant to open exactly how it was when General Motors had it. Frank Langfitt Bad cars and all? Bruce Lee That's what they wanted. Frank Langfitt They even hung Lee in effigy. But Lee had something very powerful on his side. Most of the workers desperately needed jobs. And Lee had them. When NUMMI opened, over 85% of the workforce were old hands from GM Fremont. But to prepare them for that moment, in the spring of 1984, Toyota started flying them to Japan in groups of 30 to begin learning the Toyota system for making cars. John Shook Well, when the NUMMI workers first came to Japan, me, as well as certainly my Japanese bosses, had heard all these horrible things about the American worker, about the American union. Frank Langfitt As the one American working in Toyota City, John Shook helped design this training. John Shook And we had certainly heard all these stories about the workforce there at the Fremont plant, and it was our job to show them a new and very different way of working. What would they do? How would they respond to this? How would they react? And no one knew. I didn't know. So everyone was very, very nervous. Earl Ferguson I was kind of apprehensive about what I was going to see when I arrived in Japan. Frank Langfitt On one of those planes was Earl Ferguson. He'd been working for GM since 1964. Frank Langfitt What were you apprehensive about? Earl Ferguson Whether they were going to accept us or not, you know? How they were going to react when the Americans landed in Tokyo. Everything was so new to us, you know? This was just a totally new experience. John Shook So I will never forget. Frank Langfitt Again, John Shook. John Shook Taking a bus, a large bus, with my small group of Japanese colleagues to pick up the first group of trainees arriving from Fremont. Television cameras were there, because this was big news in Japan at that time. And as they got off the plane, we had signs welcoming them. Earl Ferguson News media was everywhere. We were signing autographs and taking pictures with all the young kids. Totally new experience. John Shook Most of them had never been out of the United States before, and none of them, certainly, had ever been to Japan. Les Myers My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I've worked at General Motors for 25 years. My hobbies are fishing and bowling. Japanese Auto Worker My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. My hobby is softball. Frank Langfitt The narrator in this Japanese public television program points out that the American worker is nine years older than his Toyota trainer. He also notes for his Japanese viewers that the Americans are so much larger than the Japanese, they waste a second or two more each time they get in and out of the vehicles they're building, which makes them 10% to 15% less productive than their Asian counterparts. The key to the Toyota production system was a principle so basic it sounds like an empty management slogan. Teamwork. Back home in Fremont, GM supervisors ordered around large groups of workers. At the Takaoka plant, people were divided into teams of just four or five, switched jobs every few hours to relieve the monotony, and a team leader would step in to help whenever anything went wrong. Again, Professor Jeffrey Liker and Toyota's John Shook. Jeffrey Liker And they spent about two weeks, and they worked in a Toyota plant. John Shook Hooked up at the hip with a counterpart in the Corolla plant, someone who did the exact same job you'd be doing back in Fremont. Jeffrey Liker And they start to do the job, and they were pretty proud, because they were building cars back in the United States. And they wanted to show they could do it within the time allotted, and they would usually get behind, and they would struggle, and they would try to catch up. And at some point, somebody would come over and say, do you want me to help? And that was a revelation, because nobody in the GM plant would ever ask to help. They would come and yell at you because you got behind. John Shook Really, we wanted to give them a chance to see and experience a different way of doing things. We wanted them to see the culture there, the way people worked together to solve problems. Jeffrey Liker Then, the biggest surprise was if, when they had those problems, afterwards, somebody would come up to them and say, what are your ideas for improvement so we don't have that problem again? Frank Langfitt So they'd make suggestions for a different kind of tool that would be better for the job, or a different place for bolts and parts to sit that would be easier to reach. Jeffrey Liker They couldn't believe that responsiveness. I can't remember any time in my working life where anybody asked for my ideas to solve the problem. And they literally want to know. And when I tell them, they listen, and then suddenly they disappear, and somebody comes back with the tool that I just described. It's built, and they say try this. Frank Langfitt Under the Toyota system, everyone's expected to be looking for ways to improve the production process all the time, to make the workers' job easier and more efficient, to shave extra steps and extra seconds off each worker's job. To spot defects in the cars and the causes of those defects. This is the Japanese concept of kaizen, continuous improvement. When a worker makes a suggestion that saves money, he gets a bonus of a few hundred dollars or so. And if you look around the Toyota plant, you can see the result of all those improvements. Hanging shelves that travel along with the car and the worker, carrying the parts and bolts they need within easy reach. Special cushions they throw into the car frames when they have to kneel inside. Workers' tasks have been streamlined to the fewest possible steps, each step timed down to the second. Billy Haggerty Two seconds to pick up a bolt and put it on. Two seconds to take a gun and tighten it down. Frank Langfitt Billy Haggerty learned the Japanese system two decades into his tenure at GM Fremont. Billy Haggerty Everything was timed out. Such and such takes such and such long to do. That's the way you did it. At General Motors, you could be running in circles for whatever you were doing, and that's the way it is. You lose time. A car a minute don't seem like it's moving that fast, but when you don't get it, you're in the hole. There's nobody to pull you out at General Motors, so you're going to let something go. Frank Langfitt All those mistakes added up at a GM plant, and the results were littered around the lots outside. Hundreds of misassembled cars. Cars that came off the line missing parts, cars that needed to be fixed before they could be shipped out to the dealers. In a Toyota plant, there was nothing like this. Why did a GM plant produce so many screwed up cars? One cardinal rule that everybody in the company knew. Billy Haggerty The line could never stop. Never stop the line. Frank Langfitt Again, Billy Haggerty, Jeffrey Liker, Rick Madrid, and Bruce Lee. Billy Haggerty Someone have a heart attack, kick him out of the way, keep that line running. Jeffrey Liker It was a basic sin. You're violating the Ten Commandments. Rick Madrid You just don't see the line stop. I saw a guy fall in the pit, and they didn't stop the line. Bruce Lee You saw a problem, you stopped that line, you were fired. Frank Langfitt A long time GM manager named Ernie Schaefer explained why. Ernie Schaefer Because the theory was, they'll stop it all the time. They don't want to work, you know? They want to sit and play cards or whatever. That was a free break for them if the line stopped, so you wouldn't give them the ability to stop the line. Frank Langfitt John Shook, the American who helped Toyota design its training program, says this all goes back to the first assembly line created by Henry Ford. John Shook What Henry Ford had basically designed was a system that he wanted the people on the floor to simply get the volume out. Get the product out the door. And someone later will worry about the quality. If we have to repair it, we'll repair it. So one of the most fundamental things that Toyota did was take that and turn it on its head. So now we tell the plant floor, don't you worry about the production volume. You worry about quality. The last thing we want is to have a lot of defects flowing down the line that we have to repair later. Billy Haggerty Toyota's philosophy was quality, not quantity. Frank Langfitt In his old GM job, Billy Haggerty put on hoods and fenders and saw lots of mistakes go right down the line. Billy Haggerty So we had Monte Carlos with Regal front ends and vice versas, and they would just stick it on, run it out to the yard, and then change. Frank Langfitt And what they look like, the cars? Billy Haggerty Half Regals and half-- [LAUGHTER]. So those things would go out the door, into the yard, and be fixed out there. I did a lot of overtime in the yard, changing things back. Frank Langfitt Workers told me they saw cars with engines put in backwards, cars without steering wheels or breaks. Some were so messed up they wouldn't start, and had to be towed off the line. Fixing them piled on more costs, and sometimes, taking them apart and putting them back together, workers damaged them even more. On the floor of the NUMMI plant in Fremont, Earl Ferguson showed me Toyota's solution to all this. It's a thin nylon rope that hangs on hooks along the assembly line, which became a symbol of everything that was different about the Japanese way of making cars-- the andon cord. Earl Ferguson These cords hanging down, that's the andon cord. That will stop the line. If he pulls the andon cord, then this light's going to come on right here. Then it'll show up on the screen that this location is down. Frank Langfitt It also plays a surprisingly cheerful little song. Workers in each area can pick the tune. You hear it all the time in a Toyota plant. The first pull doesn't stop the line. It summons team leaders to the location. They try to correct the problem, and usually, they can do it quickly without stopping production. But if they fail, the line stops. Earl Ferguson Then they'll correct the problem. Then they can pull the andon cord again, and the line will start. Frank Langfitt Now, when was the first time you ever pulled an andon cord? Earl Ferguson 1984. Frank Langfitt Where did you do it? Earl Ferguson In Japan. Frank Langfitt Were you at all nervous, because you'd been taught for so many years never to stop the line? Earl Ferguson Yeah. And it was really exciting. Rick Madrid What got me was the fact that they had a cross bolt, and they stopped the line to repair it. Frank Langfitt That's Rick Madrid, the worker who brought a thermos full of vodka and OJ to work every day at GM. What he saw in Japan was a kind of a bolt-- a cross bolt-- that they'd put in wrong. Rick Madrid And they stopped the line and repaired it, which is take the bolt out, ream the hole, put the bolt back in, instead of sending it on and putting all the other junk on top of it so you have to take it off and repair it. And whoever puts it back isn't skilled in putting trim back, so they're going to mess up. That impression, I said, gee, that makes sense. Fix it now so you don't have to go through all this stuff. That's when it dawned on me that we can do it. One bolt. One bolt changed my attitude. Jeffrey Liker I think that there was a combination of feelings. One feeling was, wow, this is different. Frank Langfitt Again, that's industrial engineering professor Jeffrey Liker. Jeffrey Liker Another feeling was of embarrassment. We've been in this industry for how many years? My whole adult life. We're Americans. We're supposed to be the best, most important country in the world, and we can't build a quality car. And these Japanese are doing it. And there was a sense of hurt pride. Earl Ferguson Well, it was kind of-- you become a little bit ashamed, because why couldn't we do that? Frank Langfitt Again, Earl Ferguson. Earl Ferguson You know, I think most of it was pride after that. We wanted to be able to compete with what I saw in Japan. I said, I know we can do what they can do. John Shook Only two weeks later, when that first group left to go back to Fremont-- Frank Langfitt Toyota trainer, John Shook. John Shook We had a party, of course. A sushi party. And this was years ago, before sushi was as it is now. It was a rare thing, of course. And people were crying on both sides. You had union workers, grizzled old folks that had worked on the plant floor for 30 years, and they were hugging their Japanese counterparts, just absolutely in tears. Frank Langfitt There's actually footage of this, though we don't know if it's the first group of Americans. The US workers are in kimonos with the Toyota name on them, and they hand their neck ties to the Japanese and hug. One man is crying. Auto Worker [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Frank Langfitt One of the Americans says, in Japanese, \\"Thanks to you all, we now feel confident for our success.\\" John Shook. John Shook And it might sound flowery to say 25 years later, but they had such a powerful, emotional experience of learning a new way of working-- a way that people could actually work together collaboratively as a team. We knew it wasn't going to be easy. There were a lot of hurdles to overcome. But there was no question in anyone's mind that this was going to work. Frank Langfitt But if it was going to work, it would mean a radically different relationship between workers and management-- one where the managers trusted the workers to let them pull the andon cord and stop the line. One where the workers trusted their bosses enough to ask for help when there were problems. Auto Worker With teamwork, we can do it all. Now let's hold up your hands and together, with teamwork, we can do it all! Frank Langfitt December 1984, the first car rolled off the assembly line in Fremont-- a yellow Chevy Nova. UAW rep Joel Smith was one of the speakers. Joel Smith Mr. Toyoda, staff, and fellow UAW members, today is a historic one. The first car. But we're also on the threshold of a new adventure and relationship between labor and management. For too long, the American worker has been maligned, criticized, called bad names, for building lousy products, poor quality American worker. At New United Motor, we will build a quality car, and we will only build a quality car. And Mr. Toyoda, if you would please deliver this challenge to our friends in Japan-- we intend to build the best quality car in the world. Thank you. Bruce Lee They hit the ground running. It didn't take a year, two years to get quality in that product. Frank Langfitt Again, the UAW's Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee Oh, I was so proud of them, you can't believe. The fact that they did it didn't surprise me that much, but how quickly they did it did. It was amazing. Here were these same people who before, I mean, were-- hell, they'd go out of their way to make life miserable for General Motors particularly. And, you know, they were old, they were fat, because that was not a young workforce that we brought in here. Frank Langfitt The numbers coming out of the NUMMI plant were astonishing. Again, here's Jeffrey Liker. Jeffrey Liker The best measure they use is how many defects are there per 100 vehicles. And it was one of the best in America. And it was the same for the Toyota cars that were made in California as the Corollas that were coming from Japan, right from the beginning. Frank Langfitt Maryann Keller, a long time car analyst, devotes a chapter to NUMMI in her book about the rise and fall of GM, Rude Awakening. After just three months, she says, the cars coming off the line were getting near perfect quality ratings. And just as important for GM were the cost savings. One study suggested, remarkably, it would probably take 50% more workers under the old system to build the same car. Grievances and absenteeism plummeted, and lots of workers preferred the NUMMI teamwork system to the old combative one at GM. Several told us they enjoyed coming to work for the first time. Rick Madrid I didn't want to tell people I worked at the Chevy truck plant, because a lot of people had a lot of problems with them. Frank Langfitt That's Rick Madrid, who spent 17 years at the old Fremont plant building Chevy trucks. He was ashamed of that vehicle. At NUMMI, making the Nova, he felt differently. Rick Madrid Oh, I had a stack of these postcards. And I would just drive around. If I'd see a Nova parked, I would put one of these under the windshield wiper. Of course, it had my name, my address on it, and your opinion of the Nova? And just basically, they'd drop me a line, and a lot of people did this. Frank Langfitt And what did they say? Rick Madrid Some said they really liked it-- a quality car. A good car. Frank Langfitt Another worker told me he'd go to the Chevy dealership to stare at the Novas. He didn't tell anyone he built them, or that he worked at NUMMI. He just liked seeing what the cars looked like, sitting there on the lot. Ira Glass That's NPR's Frank Langfitt. Coming up, so there's this great way of making cars. GM is using it in California, and not only are the cars more reliable, they're cheaper to make. Seems like a no brainer for GM. Start putting this way of producing cars into their other factories everywhere, and declare victory. Why they didn't do that, why what happened at NUMMI stayed at NUMMI for so long-- that's in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues. Act Two: Act Two Ira Glass It's This American Life. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. If you're just tuning in, we're in the middle of a story about a car plant in Fremont, California called NUMMI. We now turn to the question, why was it so hard for GM to replicate NUMMI elsewhere in the company? Why didn't this idea spread decades ago? In the first half of our story, we heard a lot from workers who were on the factory floor. In this half of the story, the action moves to their bosses-- the supervisors at GM-- who had a chance to turn the company around with what they learned at NUMMI. Again, here's NPR's Frank Langfitt. Frank Langfitt GM had gotten the first thing it wanted out of NUMMI-- a high quality small car. Now the question was, how could it spread the lessons of NUMMI throughout the rest of the company? To do that, it set up a special liaison office. Managers were flown in for tours and to work the assembly line for a few days to learn the team concept. And from the beginning, GM executives sent 16 of their rising stars to help start NUMMI, with the idea that later, they'd come home and change the company. Two Wall Street Journal reporters later dubbed them the NUMMI commandos. One of the 16 was Mark Hogan. He says the top brass understood NUMMI's game changing potential, that a Toyota style plant squeezed many more cars out of far fewer workers. Mark Hogan If General Motors was able to take its many manufacturing facilities and implement that production system, it meant billions to General Motors in the bottom line. Steve Bera We were ready. We were fired, and we had the mental condition that says, we're going to do this. We're going to change the world. Frank Langfitt That's Steve Bera, another commando. He says once NUMMI was up and running, he and the other 15 waited to be deployed elsewhere for the next phase of their mission. But the company didn't seem to know what to do with them. Steve Bera Instead of coming back to the 16 of us and saying, there's some secret sauce here. What is it? How can we use this to our advantage? No one ever asked us that question. Frank Langfitt Why didn't they do that? Steve Bera It was never part of a master plan. And if there was a master plan, none of us ever saw it. Frank Langfitt Frustrated, Bera quit after just two years at NUMMI. With no master plan from Detroit, the first real attempt to do NUMMI again came from a factory manager, 400 miles south of Fremont, at a plant in Van Nuys. The factory was facing a possible shutdown. Its manager, a guy named Ernie Schaefer, had visited NUMMI, and he thought maybe he could save his plant if he adopted the Japanese system. But he didn't have all the advantages Fremont had. This time, Toyota wasn't a partner in the experiment. GM had to transform Van Nuys on its own. Ernie Schaefer knew it was going to be tough. Ernie Schaefer The thing that I think kept us moving forward is we had no alternative. I mean, it was pretty well known that if we didn't successfully implement this philosophy in Van Nuys, we weren't going to be around. Frank Langfitt Van Nuys made Firebirds and Camaros, and its reputation wasn't much better than GM Fremont's had been-- defective cars coming off the line, battles with the union, sabotage. So Ernie Schaefer enlisted the same UAW leader who got the union on board at NUMMI, Bruce Lee, to help him win over the Van Nuys workforce. They shut down the plant for two weeks to train everyone in team concept and quality control. For this workforce, there were no trips to Japan, no tearful sushi parties. And from the start, workers were skeptical. Larry Spiegel The lack of receptiveness to change was so deep. Frank Langfitt Larry Spiegel was another NUMMI commando. He moved down to Van Nuys to help launch the Japanese system there. Larry Spiegel There were too many people convinced that they didn't need to have to change. Frank Langfitt Hadn't General Motors threatened to close the plant? Larry Spiegel They didn't believe them. Frank Langfitt Why? Larry Spiegel It's not logical. They just didn't. Frank Langfitt This was one of the biggest differences between Fremont and Van Nuys. Van Nuys hadn't been shut down. Turns out it's a lot easier to get workers to change if they've lost their jobs, and then you offer them back. Without that, many union members just saw the Toyota system as a threat. And they had a point. Under the Japanese system, Van Nuys stood to lose a fourth of its workforce, because the more efficient a plant becomes, the fewer workers it needs. And just as bad, the team concept hurt their seniority rights. This had been a problem for union members back at NUMMI also. Richard Aguilar Your seniority is what you work for. To me, that's what a union's about. Seniority. Frank Langfitt Richard Aguilar worked at NUMMI, and to him, seniority was just another way of saying fairness. He waited 15 years to get enough seniority for the job he'd always wanted in the plant. Under the new system, management could just hire someone off the street for that job. The whole idea of seniority placing you into one great job for years was impossible under the team concept. Workers had to learn every job on their team and take turns doing those jobs. Richard Aguilar And the team concept, it sounds good. I mean, team player sounds good, but it pit worker against worker. It really does. Frank Langfitt This was the other thing Richard hated about the Japanese system. The whole point of a union, its most basic principle, was to protect you from management. But once people were working in teams, Richard says union members started doing things for management that just seemed wrong. Richard Aguilar People now snitched on each other. You know, they'd point fingers. Oh, he's not doing this job right, you know, or she's not doing the job right. And they would even keep track of stuff they'd missed, because that's what the company puts on them-- that the only way you can protect your job, you have to keep the team strong. So there's a weak link, you've got to get rid of that weak link. And I would go tell them, you can't do that. You can't build a case for management against a union member. It made me angry and disappointed that the union had gotten so backwards that they'd forgotten what a union meant-- taking care of each other. Frank Langfitt At Van Nuys, it wasn't just union members who resisted the Japanese system. Managers were against it too. Like the union members, they didn't want change. There were things they liked about the old system. It gave them privileges and perks they'd now be losing. For instance, some managers opposed the idea of stopping the assembly line, because their bonuses depended on the number of cars that rolled off the line. Never mind how many defects they had. And now that workers and managers were supposed to be a team, executives and workers would share the same cafeteria and same parking lot, as equals. Managers at NUMMI didn't have a problem with that, but the managers at Van Nuys? Bruce Lee They rioted. Frank Langfitt The UAW's Bruce Lee remembers getting a phone call from plant supervisor Ernie Schaefer about his managers. Bruce Lee They basically told Ernie, you do that and we're out of here. We're going to quit en masse. Because Ernie called me, and he said, Bruce, I can't do it. I can't do those things. I said, just think about it. That's a nothing. So they have to walk 20 yards more. I said, isn't that foolish that some grown man would come up and tell you, I'm going to quit if I can't have this parking place right here? Frank Langfitt So people fought the new system from both sides. Managers gave Ernie grief, and a dissident faction sprang up in the local union, which elected a staunch opponent of the Japanese system as their chairman. And as if that all wasn't enough, Ernie Schaefer ran into another obstacle. Workers could only build cars as good as the parts they were given. At NUMMI, many of the parts came from Japan and were really good. At Van Nuys, it was totally different. Ernie Schaefer That was perhaps one of our biggest failures in that an isolated plant can't do this by itself. Frank Langfitt The team concept stressed continuous improvement. If a team got a shipment of parts that didn't fit, they'd alert their bosses, who'd then go to the suppliers to fix the problem. Sometimes they'd realize the problem was in the part's design, and Toyota engineers would go back to the drawing board and remake the part to address the problem workers were having on the assembly line. All the departments in the company worked together. But Ernie's suppliers had never operated in a system like that. If he asked for fixes, they blew him off. And if he called Detroit and asked them to redesign a part that wasn't working, they'd ask him, why was he so special? They didn't have to change it for any other plant. Why should they change it for him? Ernie Schaefer You had asked the question earlier, what's different when you walk into the NUMMI plant? Well, you can see a lot of things different. But the one thing you don't see is the system that supports the NUMMI plant. I don't think at that time, anybody understood the large nature of this system. General Motors was a kind of throw it over the wall organization. You know, each department-- we were very compartmentalized, and you'd design that vehicle, and you'd throw it over the wall to the manufacturing guys. Frank Langfitt And if something didn't work, or was impossible to assemble, that was their problem. Ernie Schaefer And they had to deal with it. And, I mean, you're in there. You've kind of put your heart and soul into making this whole team concept work. And now you're the messenger that has to go out and say, look, guys, even though this is the way the system's supposed to work, and these are my issues, I'm not going to be able to solve them, and you're going to have to deal with it. And it was destructive. It was detrimental. I mean, no question about it. Frank Langfitt Schaefer says when he realized how much of the Japanese system happened off the factory floor, it answered something that had never quite made sense to him. Why had Toyota been so open with GM in showing its operations? Ernie Schaefer You know, they never prohibited us from walking through the plant, understanding, even asking questions of some of their key people. You know, I've often puzzled over that-- why they did that. And I think they recognized we were asking all the wrong questions. We didn't understand this bigger picture thing. All of our questions were focused on the floor, you know? The assembly plant. What's happening on the line. That's not the real issue. The issue is, how do you support that system with all the other functions that have to take place in the organization? Frank Langfitt Quality at Van Nuys didn't improve, and in 1992, GM shut the plant down for good, leaving 2,600 people without jobs. This is what the NUMMI commandos were up against. Entrenched, defensive bureaucracies and workers many of the places they turned. They were not only trying to change the biggest corporation in the world. They were trying to change a corporation that had been essentially a collection of individual car companies-- Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick-- each with its own design team, own leadership, and its own way of doing things. Dick Fuller It's a whole new process, a whole different process, than the one they had grown up with. And it was a huge threat. Frank Langfitt Dick Fuller was another commando. He ran the information technology division at NUMMI, which used some of the same streamlining concepts employed on the factory floor. He says when GM managers visited NUMMI, instead of trying to figure out how they could benefit from the system, some of them attacked it. Fuller remembers one IT manager who visited from a plant on the East Coast. Dick Fuller And when he came back, he wrote a report, which, if I put a title on it, would say, won't work here. And I think part of that was a threat to him. It was a threat to him to see that it was working so well. Frank Langfitt Do you think this guy looked at this and said, well, if this works here, and they try to spread it, I'll lose my job? Dick Fuller Well, I don't think he was going to lose his job, but he'd probably have to give up half his staff, you know? So that's power. It's people that's power in General Motors. Frank Langfitt Getting all these mini empires to embrace the kinds of radical changes that happened at NUMMI would have taken an almost Stalinesque leadership from above-- a combination of charisma and fury in the corner office. And NUMMI commando Mark Hogan says no one at GM fit that bill. Mark Hogan I was very convinced that we had to change, and we had to change rapidly. And I think all of us that were NUMMI alums, so to speak, were frustrated at the lack of urgency. Frank Langfitt Did you have those kinds of conversations with people in the '80s back in Detroit? Mark Hogan I did. Frank Langfitt What would people say to you? Mark Hogan Yeah. I think there still wasn't a recognition that the formidability of the competition, particularly from Toyota-- I think a lot of people were in denial, or just not willing to recognize it. And even though GM had gone from 50% market share in the early '70s to mid-30s, it was gradual over time, and there wasn't the sense of reaction or urgency that other companies that lost that much market share might have felt. Frank Langfitt Those exact numbers? GM went from 47% of the US market in the mid-1970s to 35% a decade later. One reason car execs were in denial was Detroit's insular culture. Yes, unions and management were always at each other's throats, and yes, GM and its suppliers had a destructive relationship that seemed to almost discourage quality. But everyone had settled into comfortable roles in this dysfunctional system and learned to live with it. And in the late 1980s, with their market share in freefall, Jeffrey Liker says they were more apt to blame others than themselves. Jeffrey Liker I worked with all the big three, at the time, automakers, and it was common in all three automakers. They all believed that if the consumers think we have quality problems, it's because Consumer Reports is misleading them, and they're biased toward Toyota. They all believed that Consumer Reports was against them-- that there was somewhat of a myth of Japanese quality. Frank Langfitt If all of that wasn't enough to stymie attempts to learn from NUMMI, GM was distracted by other projects-- massive projects. It bought Ross Perot's company, Electronic Data Systems. It bought Hughes Aircraft for 5 billion. It decided the future was robotics. It decided the future was a massive, costly reorganization. It started Saturn, which produced cars that were better marketed than they were built. Then came the 1991 recession. Car sales slumped. Again, Mark Hogan. Mark Hogan It was really its first significant wake up call. GM, unfortunately, had a massive loss in 1992. General Motors lost more than 20 billion. So I think at that point in time, there was a complete rethinking of the way we ran the company-- that things had to change, and they had to change fast. Frank Langfitt It was the largest loss in American corporate history to that time-- 23.5 billion. GM's board of directors responded with what the press called a boardroom bloodbath, purging a long list of managers. Jack Smith took over as CEO. He was the executive who led the negotiations with Toyota to create NUMMI. He saw NUMMI as a way forward for GM. Mark Hogan and some of the other commandos felt they finally had a champion. Mark Hogan Jack Smith was installed, and started to rapidly implement the Toyota production system into General Motors. Frank Langfitt Rapidly by GM standards, which wasn't nearly rapidly enough. Jack Smith declined to talk to me for this story, but he told a reporter a few years ago, \\"I just wish it had happened a lot faster than it did.\\" Pick your nautical cliche. Reforming General Motors was like turning around a battleship, one manager said. Another compared it to steering the Titanic with a canoe paddle. Jeffrey Liker says the cultural gap between NUMMI and the rest of GM was so vast that even with clear marching orders to change, some of the people running the company didn't know where to begin. Jeffrey Liker There was no vocabulary, even, to explain it. I remember one of the GM managers was ordered from a very senior level-- it came from a vice president-- to make a GM plant look like NUMMI. And he said, I want you to go there with cameras and take a picture of every square inch. And whatever you take a picture of, I want it to look like that in our plant. There should be no excuse for why we're different than NUMMI, why our quality is lower, why our productivity isn't as high, because you're going to copy everything you see. Immediately, this guy knew that was crazy. We can't copy employee motivation. We can't copy good relationships between the union and management. That's not something you can copy, and you can't even take a photograph of it. Frank Langfitt The first round of changes put andon cords and Japanese-style inventory control into the GM plants, but there was no change in the culture. Workers and managers continued their old antagonistic ways. In some of the factories where they installed the andon cord, workers got yelled at when they pulled it. A few plants even cut the cords down. So the second round of changes included some team concepts. They put together a book explaining how each plant should run and the reasoning behind it. Jeff Weller was one of the people dispatched in the 1990s to convert the company plant by plant. Weller says some factory managers were receptive, but in the sprawling, decentralized system, the plant manager was still king, and ran the factory the way he wanted. Jeff Weller We had some tough goes in some of our facilities, where we spent more time trying to convince the plant leadership versus actually going on and doing the implementation. I would say, I was asked in one plant to leave, because they were not interested in what I had to sell. Frank Langfitt How did he actually ask you to leave? What did he say? Jeff Weller We're finished, and you can leave. Frank Langfitt And what did you do? Jeff Weller I left, because, you know, I was in his home, so to speak. His territory. His plant. Frank Langfitt Now, whatever happened to that plant manager who asked you to leave? Jeff Weller That plant manager eventually retired. Frank Langfitt This may sound like a naive question, but why didn't the CEO pick up the phone and say, you're fired? Jeff Weller Well, it's a big company, and I'm not sure that, you know-- it doesn't work that way. Frank Langfitt Lots of people in GM still didn't see the need to change. By the late 1990s, the company was posting huge profits selling trucks and SUVs, which made the loss in market share seem less urgent. To make real progress, managers had to leave the United States. One overhauled GM Germany. Mark Hogan took over GM Brazil in 1994 to enact NUMMI principles there. In Brazil, he had a big, unionized workforce, but he could avoid GM's bureaucracy, its supplier network, and the United Auto Workers. Frank Langfitt How long did it take you to implement the lessons of NUMMI in Brazil? Mark Hogan It took us about 18 to 24 months, which at the time, I was quite impatient about. I mean, I wanted it faster. Frank Langfitt And what did that mean for the bottom line for GM? Mark Hogan Well, in that time frame, particularly '94 through '97, GM Brazil was one of the most profitable entities within GM. Frank Langfitt But in America, everyone I talked to said it took about a decade and a half after NUMMI for change to even begin to take hold at GM. By the year 2000, GM finally started to see a generational transformation. Jeffrey Liker says so many managers had come through NUMMI for training for a day or a week or a year. Jeffrey Liker Over time, you start to get 10 people, 20 people, 100 people, 300 people. And you now have a critical mass of people in GM who've all been in NUMMI. They've lived it. Now they're managing people and teaching them what they learned. And it snowballs, and suddenly, the world is different at GM, and nobody can even tell you exactly why. Frank Langfitt By the early 2000s, GM had developed a production model with the UAW based on Japanese principles that would go into all of its plants. It was called the Global Manufacturing System. And although GM quality still lags behind the imports, it's improved a lot. Again, Jeffrey Liker. Jeffrey Liker If you look carefully at the quality of a GM product, and you look with a fine tooth comb, with a magnifying glass, you're going to see a level of quality that you didn't see 15 years ago. Frank Langfitt You want to show me for a sec? Do you mind? There's one right here. I did my interview with Jeffrey Liker at the 2010 Detroit Auto Show, and we walked over to the GM exhibit, to the Cadillac SRX, which is a small SUV. Jeffrey pointed to the gap between the doors and the car frame, which is supposed to be uniform. Jeffrey Liker And if we look down here, it looks really good, right? The gap is about the same between the front and the back door. The surface is very smooth and very uniform. Frank Langfitt And 15 years ago, what would that have looked like? Jeffrey Liker You would see maybe at the top, it would be more narrow than at the bottom. If you look inside the car, and you open the glove box, it falls very gradually down the way it's supposed to. You close it-- I barely have to touch it, and it closes tightly. Frank Langfitt Precision in all these details makes for a better-looking, more reliable car, where things work like they're supposed to. But this improvement didn't come soon enough. Some cars and some plants improved less quickly than others. And while GM was getting better, so were its competitors, leaving it still near the back of the pack. James Womack Well, one of the ironies of GM was that in the moment it went bankrupt, it was probably a better company than it had ever been. Frank Langfitt That's James Womack, co-author of a seminal book comparing the Toyota and GM production systems, The Machine That Changed the World. James Womack In the factories, they had really dramatically closed the productivity gap that they had had for many, many years. And on the new products, they have much better quality. So the company that failed was actually doing better than it had ever done. But it was too late, and that's really sort of hard to forgive-- that if you take 30 years to figure it out, chances are you're going to get run over. And they got run over. Frank Langfitt In the end, what did them in was the 2008 recession. It destroyed the car market. The next year, General Motors became the largest industrial bankruptcy in US history. Its bailout cost taxpayers more than 50 billion. I asked Mark Hogan, the NUMMI commando who went on to run GM's small car division in North America, if GM had adopted NUMMI earlier, could it have really changed all that? Mark Hogan Definitely. I think if General Motors had moved in the late '80s to implement the system across the board, it may very well have saved GM from going into bankruptcy. Frank Langfitt Explain that. Mark Hogan Well, I just think the productivity and the quality changes that come with that would have been so profound that this ever increasing loss of market share would have been stopped. Bruce Lee Well, I think they'd have been building a higher quality product. Frank Langfitt Again, the UAW's Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee You know, they sold junk for a while. Just any kind of piece of crap they could roll out there, they did. And they paid a tremendous price for it. And even when they turned the corner in quality, people didn't trust them. They'd say, well, gee, they're building a good car now. Why aren't they buying them? Because they don't trust them. But had they adopted and embraced the team concept in an honest way, they were going to do this, I think it might have dramatically changed what happened in the American auto industry. There's no question in my mind. Frank Langfitt Of course, quality and reliability weren't the only problems that brought GM down. Executives made other big mistakes. Over the years, General Motors negotiated contracts with the UAW with such generous health care coverage that by 2007, it amounted to more than 1,600 for each vehicle GM produced in North America. And initially, some GM executives dismissed hybrid cars like the Prius as a publicity stunt. Instead, they bet the company on SUVs and trucks, only to see sales crash when gas hit 4.00 a gallon. Over the last decade, as GM became more like Toyota, Toyota became a little bit like GM. In 2008, it took over the title from GM of the world's largest automaker. But Toyota executives now say the company did this by making one of GM's old mistakes-- stressing quantity over quality. Akio Toyoda is the company CEO. He's the grandson of the founder, and cut his teeth at NUMMI. At a congressional hearing in 2010 about Toyota's sudden acceleration problems, he said the company's fatal mistake was growing too fast. Akio Toyoda We pursued growth over the speed at which we are able to develop our people and our organization, and I am deeply sorry for any accident that Toyota drivers have experienced. Frank Langfitt It was 15 years before GM took the lessons of NUMMI seriously, and it spent the next 10 years slowly implementing what it learned. And all the time, the NUMMI plant kept pumping out vehicles-- 6,000 a week on average, two shifts a day. Toyota got what it wanted out of the deal. A year after starting NUMMI, it began opening other factories around the US, using what it had learned in Fremont. GM and Toyota continued to run NUMMI together until 2009, when GM went bankrupt and pulled out, leaving Toyota to run the plant alone. Toyota decided to shut the factory down. It was their only unionized plant in the United States. In April 2010, NUMMI produced its very last car-- a Corolla. 4,500 people lost their jobs. This is the first factory Toyota has shut down since it was founded 73 years ago. John Shook Toyota's not perfect. GM is not perfect. But I think anyone who touched NUMMI will never forget it. Frank Langfitt One last time, that's John Shook, the first American Toyota hired for NUMMI. John Shook It does represent something that was special at a point in time. It was a laboratory. My learning curve-- it wasn't just a curve. It was a 90 degree right angle. I loved every minute of it. And almost everyone I think you'll talk to who worked on NUMMI will say the same thing. Rick Madrid I'm so fortunate that I ended my career in the auto industry at NUMMI. Frank Langfitt Rick Madrid retired from the assembly line in 1992. Rick Madrid I just hate to see the plant close. Oh, that just hurts me. End of an era. It changed my life from being depressed, bored, and like my son said, changed my attitude. It changed me all for the better. I really hate to see it go. Billy Haggerty I look at cars, and I see a lot of the cars that we built. Frank Langfitt That's Billy Haggerty, who ended up putting in 18 years at NUMMI without a vacation day. He says just the other day he saw one. Billy Haggerty But I just seen-- what was it? An '86, '87 Corolla pull in right around the corner here. I was heading for the bank. And I just looked at it and said, boy, that one's old. And I looked down, and it was a Corolla. I know we built it right there. So it's still running. It's still kicking. It feels good. Frank Langfitt This is also NUMMI's legacy. In the end, it's not just a symbol for so many things that went wrong with GM. It's also a really good car plant. One that turned out nearly 8 million high-quality cars and trucks. Ira Glass Frank Langfitt. When we first ran this story back in 2010, Frank was NPR's automotive correspondent.

Be sure to defend your answer using evidence from the case","output":"Before GM formed the alliance with Toyota (before the establishment of NUMMI in 1984), the employees at the GM Fremont plant exhibited low organizational commitment, particularly in terms of affective and normative commitment, while their continuance commitment might have been somewhat higher due to a lack of alternatives. Using the evidence provided from the \\"NUMMI\\" podcast transcript and the case, we can analyze employee commitment in this way: **Affective Commitment**: Affective commitment at the Fremont GM plant before 1982 was likely very low. The work environment was characterized by widespread dysfunction, including drug and alcohol use on the job, poor-quality workmanship, and a combative relationship between management and the workforce. Such a toxic environment would unlikely foster an emotional attachment to the organization. Workers were often absent, participated in strikes, and even intentionally sabotaged the cars they were assembling, which are not behaviors associated with a strong emotional commitment to one's workplace. **Continuance Commitment**: Continuance commitment may have been the prevailing form of commitment among employees, largely because leaving the job would have substantial costs. Many workers likely felt economically trapped due to the high pay and benefits associated with their unionized positions, which were competitive for their education and skill levels, as Jeffrey Liker noted. This financial bind, rather than loyalty or satisfaction with the job, likely motivated employees to remain despite the work conditions. **Normative Commitment**: Normative commitment seems to have been minimal prior to the alliance with Toyota. The prevailing \\"us versus them\\" mentality between workers and managers, along with negative behaviors such as grievance filing purely to gain leverage or compensation, indicates a lack of a felt obligation to the organization. Additionally, there is no indication from the case that GM made significant investments in its workforce that might cultivate a sense of loyalty or moral obligation to stay. When Toyota and GM formed their joint venture and created NUMMI, the entire culture of the plant needed to change. Toyota introduced its production system and removed many of the adversarial dynamics present at the plant. The training that GM workers received in Japan, as described in the podcast, led to transformative experiences for many. This indicates that under the right circumstances, even previously disengaged employees can develop a stronger, more positive commitment to their organization—particularly if changes address core issues affecting employee satisfaction and engagement."},{"instruction":"paraphrase this text. While NU Grocery is well on its way to growth and sustainability, it faces significant limitations and barriers. Financially speaking, the company is still in the recovery phase after the pandemic, which limits its budget for potential expansion and marketing initiatives needed to expand its reach. Supply chain is another challenge, as NU Grocery's zero waste operations rely heavily on a network of compliant local vendors, a network that needs to grow in tandem with the business while adhering to strict sustainability standards. Market-wise, the company operates in a niche, targeting eco-conscious consumers, which requires creative marketing strategies to reach a wider audience without compromising the company's strong environmental values. Finally, the constant challenge lies in changing deeply entrenched consumer behaviors that prioritize convenience over sustainability, which means consumer education is an ongoing priority. Finally, environmental policies present both opportunities and challenges, as adherence to new legislation could increase operational costs, while being actively involved in policy advocacy necessitates additional resources that could otherwise be used for other areas of the business. NU Grocery must use strategic agility to overcome these obstacles while maintaining its unwavering commitment to people, planet and profit.","output":"NU Grocery is progressing toward growth and ecological endurance but confronts significant hurdles and constraints.

Wprowadź postaci poboczne: Możesz stworzyć kilka postaci pobocznych, które mogą pełnić rolę świadków na ślubie. Mogą to być przyjaciele, rodzeństwo, członkowie rodziny lub inni bliscy krewni bohaterów, którzy mogą wypełnić tę rolę. 2. Wykorzystaj postaci, które nie spełniają dokładnie wszystkich kryteriów wiekowych: Jeśli masz postacie, które zbliżają się do wymaganych kryteriów wiekowych, ale nie są dokładnie w odpowiednim przedziale wiekowym, możesz rozważyć ich wykorzystanie jako części świadków. Na przykład, jedna postać może być bardzo młoda, więc pasuje do kategorii wiekowej dzieci, ale jest wystarczająco dojrzała, by pełnić rolę świadka podczas ślubu. 3. Przerób fabułę: Możesz zmienić sposób, w jaki odbywają się śluby w twojej powieści. Na przykład, istnieje wiele tradycji ślubnych, które różnią się w zależności od kultury, religii lub wydarzeń historycznych. Możesz wprowadzić nową tradycję, w której tylko trójka świadków jest wymagana. 4. Zredukuj liczbę świadków: Jeśli nie jesteś przywiązany do konieczności posiadania sześciu świadków na każdym ślubie, możesz zmniejszyć liczbę wymaganych świadków do trzech lub czterech w celu dopasowania do dostępnych postaci. Ostatecznie, wybierz rozwiązanie, które najlepiej pasuje do twojej historii i postaci.

Ta postać mogłaby być odpowiedzialna za pomaganie bohaterom w ich życiu, udzielanie im wsparcia emocjonalnego i radzenia sobie z problemami. Gdyby ta postać pełniła tę rolę przez dłuższy czas, mogłaby być traktowana jako symboliczny świadek na ślubie. Alternatywnie, można również rozważyć wprowadzenie postaci zewnętrznej, jak np. notariusza lub osoby pełniącej rolę oficjalnego świadka. Może to być osoba, która niekoniecznie jest blisko związana z głównymi bohaterami, ale spełnia wymóg i pojawia się jedynie na czas ceremonii ślubnej.

Możesz skoncentrować się na tych, którzy mają największe znaczenie dla głównych bohaterów lub są najbardziej bliscy narzeczonym/narzeczonym. 2. Rozważ zmianę tradycji: W niektórych kulturach lub środowiskach, liczba drużbów/druhen może być mniejsza niż sześć. Możesz wprowadzić nową tradycję lub zwyczaj, w którym tylko trzej świadkowie są wymagani na ślubie. 3. Uzasadnij redukcję liczby drużbów/druhen w fabule: Wprowadź element w fabułę, który uzasadnia zmniejszenie liczby drużbów/druhen.

Here are some key distinctions between different approaches to development: 1. Modernization theory vs. Dependency theory: - Modernization theory: This approach suggests that developing countries can achieve progress by adopting the strategies of developed countries. It emphasizes economic growth, industrialization, urbanization, and technological advancement. It assumes that development will lead to increased wealth, improved living standards, and western-style democracy. - Dependency theory: In contrast, dependency theory argues that developing countries are inherently disadvantaged due to their historical and ongoing economic, political, and social relationships with powerful nations. It emphasizes that development can only occur if dependency on the dominant nations is reduced. This approach calls for economic self-reliance, import substitution, and redistributive policies to tackle inequality. 2. Neoliberalism vs. State-led development: - Neoliberalism: This approach advocates for limited government intervention, deregulation, and free market policies as the driving forces for development. It emphasizes the importance of individual entrepreneurship, private sector investment, and open global trade. Neoliberalism believes that economic growth will eventually lead to societal improvements and poverty reduction. - State-led development: In contrast, state-led development emphasizes the role of government in directing and controlling the development process. It argues that the state needs to lead in areas such as industrialization, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and social welfare to ensure equitable growth and poverty alleviation. 3. Sustainable development vs. Growth-oriented development: - Sustainable development: This approach emphasizes the importance of balancing economic growth with social progress and environmental sustainability. It calls for development policies that promote long-term well-being, taking into account social equity, environmental protection, and economic viability. Sustainable development aims to address the needs of the present without compromising future generations. - Growth-oriented development: In contrast, growth-oriented development prioritizes rapid economic growth as the primary driver of development. It focuses on increasing GDP, industrial production, and employment opportunities, often overlooking social and environmental concerns.

С помощью этого средства один невербально говорит другому: \\"Как видите, я думаю так же, как вы, поэтому я копирую вашу позу и ваши жесты\\". Очень интересно наблюдать за этим подсознательным ко-пированием. По- смотрите, например, на двух мужчин, изображенных на рис. 131, стоящих у стойки бара. Они отзеркаливают жесты друг друга, и можно предположить, что их мысли и чувства совпадают. Как только один человек скрещивает руки или ноги, другой делает то же самое. Как только один из них кладет руку в карман, другой повторяет его жест, и это копирование будет продолжаться до тех пор, пока они пребывают в согласии между собой.

Исторически, пройдя релейный и ламповый этапы, база для развития современных цифровых технологий была заложена созданием полупроводниковых транзисторов. «Число транзисторов на кристалле» является одной из основных характеристик процессоров и больших интегральных схем, определяющих производительность и архитектуру вычислительного устройства. Транзистор – полупроводниковое устройство, которое в настоящее время является основным «строительным компонентом» процессора, памяти и всей логики работы вычислительного устройства. Из соединенных определенным образом транзисторов строятся логические элементы, например, логические элементы И, ИЛИ, НЕ, И-НЕ, ИЛИ-НЕ и прочие. Именно этими логическими элементами и реализуется работа процессора, контроллеров памяти и прочих компонентов и называется «архитектурой интегральной микросхемы». Подробнее прочитать о логических функциях можно здесь: Логические функции.pdf. Появление транзисторов, ставших основным строительным компонентом современной вычислительной техники, заменив реле и лампы, датируется декабрем 1947 года. Транзистор – полупроводниковое устройство, в котором ток в цепи двух электродов управляется третьим электродом. Не останавливаясь чересчур подробно на устройстве и принципе работы транзистора (что должно быть известно из школьного курса физики), продемонстрируем, каким образом на транзисторах можно выстроить логические элементы. Рассмотрим рисунок транзистора. Транзистор – полупроводниковый прибор, имеющий три контакта: сток (коллектор), исток (эмиттер) и затвор (база). Подача напряжения на базу управляет током между коллектором и эмиттером: если на базу подать напряжение, транзистор открывается, ток от коллектора пойдет к эмиттеру. Если на базе нет напряжения, транзистор закрыт, ток не идет. транзистор в действии.png Для простоты восприятия базу (затвор) транзистора можно представить как задвижку: когда на стоке есть заряд, а задвижка закрыта, заряд остается на стоке. Если приложить усилие и открыть задвижку (затвор), то заряд со стока уйдет на исток.","output":"1. Что такое транзистор и для чего он нужен? 2.

Me de seus conceitos em absoluto, argumentos e conclusões a e suas proposições lógicas para está questão.","output":"Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), filósofo alemão do Iluminismo, é conhecido por suas contribuições em diversas áreas da filosofia, incluindo a estética, que ele explora principalmente em sua obra \\"Crítica da Faculdade do Juízo\\" (Kritik der Urteilskraft), publicada em 1790. Este texto representa a terceira crítica principal na tríade de trabalhos críticos que começou com a \\"Crítica da Razão Pura\\" e seguiu-se da \\"Crítica da Razão Prática\\". Na \\"Crítica da Faculdade do Juízo\\", Kant busca compreender as bases dos julgamentos estéticos e teleológicos (relativos a propósitos ou fins). Aqui, ele se debruça sobre o que chamamos de julgamentos de gosto, que são aqueles julgamentos sobre o belo e o sublime na natureza e na arte. Vamos explorar alguns conceitos chave e suas respectivas caracterizações na estética kantiana: 1. **Autonomia do Belo**: Para Kant, o julgamento do belo é desinteressado, ou seja, não é baseado em desejo pessoal nem tem como objetivo a posse do objeto. A apreciação estética é uma experiência que não está vinculada a interesses externos ou condicionada por conceitos determinados. 2. **Universalidade**: Quando julgamos algo como belo, o fazemos com a expectativa de que outras pessoas compartilhem desse julgamento. Kant não está dizendo que todos concordarão sobre o que é belo, mas sim que nosso juízo de gosto reivindica uma certa universalidade subjetiva; é como se estivéssemos falando \\"Se você experimentasse o objeto da mesma forma que eu, você concordaria que é belo\\". Assim, a beleza é vista como universal sem ser baseada em conceitos objetivos. 3. **Finalidade sem fim**: Kant fala da beleza como tendo \\"finalidade sem fim\\", ou seja, apreciamos a harmonia e a ordem em algo belo como se houvesse um propósito em seu design, apesar de não identificar um propósito último ou utilitário. Este conceito nos diz que objetos de beleza parecem ter sido projetados com um fim em mente, mas não exigem um fim concreto para serem apreciados. 4. **O Sublime**: Diferentemente do belo, o sublime está mais associado à natureza do que à arte e é caracterizado por um sentimento misto de prazer e dor. É a reação emocional que temos diante de algo vasto ou poderoso que desafia nossa capacidade de compreensão — como uma montanha imensa ou um temporal. O sublime nos faz reconhecer tanto a pequenez das nossas capacidades físicas como a grandeza das nossas capacidades racionais, visto que somos capazes de conceber tais fenômenos. 5. **Jogos das Faculdades**: Estética de Kant também está centrada em como nossas capacidades mentais — especialmente a imaginação e a compreensão — interagem ao experimentar algo esteticamente. No juízo estético, a imaginação e o entendimento entram em um \\"jogo livre\\", onde não há conceito determinado ao qual a imaginação está sobrecarregada. Isso contrasta com nosso encontro com o conhecimento, onde a imaginação está subordinada a conceitos. As proposições lógicas que guiam a argumentação de Kant a respeito da estética são intricadamente ligadas à sua epistemologia e à sua ética, sustentando uma visão que enquadra a estética em uma relação indissociável com as outras faculdades humanas. Ele busca uma justificação transcendental para nossas experiências estéticas, argumentando que elas são fundamentadas na estrutura da mente humana, possibilitando assim fazer juízos universais subjetivos. Em conclusão, a estética para Kant é um ramo complexo da filosofia que lida com questões de gosto, apreciação da beleza e do sublime, e a relação entre nossas faculdades sensoriais e intelectuais. Seu trabalho nessa área tem influenciado profundamente o pensamento subsequente na filosofia da arte e a teoria estética."},{"instruction":"Explique detalhadamente de forma abrangente e aprofundada, a questão do Empirismo Radical de David Hume que ele argumenta em suas obras. Me de seus conceitos em absoluto, argumentos e conclusões a e suas proposições lógicas para está questão.","output":"David Hume (1711-1776) foi um filósofo escocês cujas obras são fundamentais para o entendimento do empirismo e do ceticismo modernos. Embora o termo \\"Empirismo Radical\\" possa não ser o mais comumente associado a Hume - ele próprio nunca o usou - sua filosofia pode ser vista como uma forma de empirismo extremamente consequente. O empirismo é a teoria do conhecimento que afirma que o conhecimento origina-se e é baseado na experiência sensorial. Vamos explorar os aspectos centrais dessa posição filosófica conforme articultada por Hume: 1. **Impressões e Ideias**: Hume inicia sua discussão no \\"Tratado da Natureza Humana\\" com a distinção entre \\"impressões\\" e \\"ideias\\". As impressões, que incluem todas as nossas sensações e paixões, são vívidas e intensas, enquanto as ideias são as representações mais fracas dessas impressões em nosso pensamento e raciocínio. Para Hume, todas as nossas ideias têm origem nas impressões. 2. **Ceticismo quanto à Causalidade**: Um dos argumentos mais famosos de Hume é que não temos uma percepção empírica da causalidade. Quando dizemos que um evento causa outro, estamos apenas observando que os dois eventos são constantemente concomitantes, ou seja, que um segue regularmente o outro. Não podemos, através da experiência, perceber uma conexão necessária, mas apenas desenvolver o hábito de esperar que o evento consecutivo aconteça após o antecedente. Isso mina a ideia de que podemos conhecer as causas das coisas de forma empírica. 3. **Ideia de Self**: Hume argumenta que não há impressão constante e invariável de um \\"self\\" ou \\"eu\\". Ao examinar nossas próprias experiências, encontramos apenas percepções individuais, como sentimentos, pensamentos e imagens, e nenhuma impressão permanente de um self subjacente a estas. Assim, ele sugere que o self é apenas um feixe de percepções em constante mudança. 4. **Kant**: Hume teve uma influência profunda em outros filósofos, notavelmente Immanuel Kant, que afirmou que a leitura de Hume o despertou de seu \\"sono dogmático\\", levando-o a desenvolver sua própria crítica da razão pura. 5. **Religião**: Hume também aplicou seu empirismo ao campo da religião, argumentando ceticamente contra argumentos para a existência de Deus que dependiam de causação ou design na natureza. Ele propôs que as crenças religiosas não se baseiam em raciocínios válidos a partir da experiência, mas em aspectos psicológicos e emocionais da natureza humana. 6. **Ética e Emoções**: No campo da ética, Hume argumentou que nossas ações morais derivam de sentimentos e paixões, não da razão. Para ele, a razão isoladamente é inerte e incapaz de motivar a conduta; são as paixões que movem as pessoas à ação. Conclusões e Proposições: Hume conclui que uma grande parte daquilo que pensamos conhecer sobre o mundo é baseada em costumes e hábitos, e não em uma autêntica compreensão da causalidade ou de uma conexão necessária entre eventos. Sua proposição lógica central é que nosso conhecimento, quando rastreado até suas origens, reside no que experimentamos diretamente por meio de nossos sentidos. Qualquer coisa que vá além dessas experiências imediatas entra no reino da especulação e, a partir de um ponto de vista estritamente empírico, não tem fundamento sólido. As contribuições de Hume ao empirismo estabelecem uma base para uma análise cuidadosa e cética sobre o que podemos justificar racionalmente afirmando saber. Ele questiona a validade do raciocínio indutivo, aponta os limites da razão na determinação da moralidade e, ao fazê-lo, deixa um impacto duradouro no desenvolvimento do pensamento filosófico ocidental."},{"instruction":"I came to take my son from the school.

La ecuación de Van der Waals es la siguiente: (P + a(n/V)^2)(V - nb) = nRT Donde: P = presión V = volumen n = número de moles R = constante de los gases ideales T = temperatura absoluta a y b = constantes para el gas en particular En este caso, para el nitrógeno, los valores de las constantes son: a = 3.59 L^2 atm/K^2 mol^2 b = 0.04 L/mol Para calcular la temperatura necesitamos despejarla de la ecuación de Van der Waals. Primero, reemplazamos los valores conocidos: 45 atm + 3.59 (12 Kg /30 L)^2 (30 L - 0.04 L/mol(12 Kg)) = nRT Simplificamos: 45 atm + 3.59 (12 Kg / 30 L)^2 (29.96 L) = nRT Ahora, despejamos T: T = (45 atm + 3.59 (12 Kg / 30 L)^2 (29.96 L)) / (nR) Para calcular n, necesitamos el número de moles de nitrógeno que está presente. Esto lo podemos obtener utilizando la fórmula: n = masa / masa molar Donde la masa molar del nitrógeno (N2) es 28 g/mol. n = 12 Kg / (28 g/mol) * (1000 g / 1 Kg) * (1 mol / 1000 g) Simplificamos: n = 12 * 1000 / 28 mol n = 428.57 mol Ahora, podemos reemplazar el valor de n en la fórmula de T: T = (45 atm + 3.59 (12 Kg / 30 L)^2 (29.96 L)) / (428.57 mol * 0.0821 L atm / K mol) Simplificamos: T = (45 atm + 3.59 (12 Kg / 30 L)^2 (29.96 L)) / (428.57 mol * 0.0821 L atm / K mol) Finalmente, calculamos el valor de T: T = (45 atm + 3.59 (12 / 30)^2 * 29.96) / (428.57 * 0.0821) T ≈ 152.54 K Por lo tanto, la temperatura a la cual se debe calentar el nitrógeno para que ocupe un volumen de 30 L a una presión de 45 atm es aproximadamente 152.54 K."},{"instruction":"Cual es la ruta mas rápida en Dark souls 2 para Novatos, y que clase elegir?","output":"En Dark Souls 2, la ruta más rápida para los novatos puede variar dependiendo del estilo de juego y las preferencias personales de cada jugador.

Wide-eyed, the other villains turned their attention to Whammer, noticing his distress. The Butcher, always gruff on the surface, cleared his throat and tried to find words of solace. \\"Hey, Whammer, don't worry about it. Birds, you know, they sometimes just...fall asleep outside, that's all.\\" \\"Butcher's right, Whammer,\\" Granny May chimed in, her own voice filled with forced cheerfulness. \\"Birds take very long naps sometimes. Maybe it's just having a really good rest.\\" Whammer sniffled, wiping the tears from his eyes. \\"Re-really? You think so?\\" Dr. Two-Brains, known for his elaborate schemes, put on a compassionate expression. \\"Absolutely, Whammer. Sometimes, when birds take a nap, they're having extra special dreams. Sweet dreams, like a vacation in a tropical paradise.\\" Whammer's eyes sparkled with curiosity. \\"A vacation? That sounds nice. Maybe that's why the birdie didn't wake up.\\" Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, always seeking mischief, couldn't resist joining in. \\"You know, Whammer, I heard that birds sometimes pretend to be asleep to trick the invisible ninja squirrels. Maybe that's what this bird is doing.\\" Whammer's tears were gradually replaced by a faint smile. \\"Really? The invisible ninja squirrels? Wow!\\" The villains continued to weave an intricate tapestry of stories, embellishing each explanation with playful details. They painted a landscape where the birds had become secret agents on daring missions or magical creatures exploring enchanted forests. As the tales became grander, Whammer started to forget his initial sadness. His childlike imagination began to soar, embracing the newfound wonder of the bird's \\"nap.\\" The villains banded together and took turns sharing more imaginative stories, each more fantastic than the last. Hours passed, and it was time for the villains to part ways. Just as they were about to leave, Whammer turned to his comrades, his face brimming with gratitude. \\"Thanks, guys. I didn't know birds could have such amazing adventures when they're asleep. I feel much better now!\\" The other villains shared a knowing smile, happy to have helped their innocent friend through a difficult moment. They may be villains, but even they understood the importance of kindness and support. And so, with renewed spirits and the seed of friendship planted, the villains dispersed, ready to take on Wordgirl another day. Meanwhile, the bird's peaceful slumber continued, blissfully unaware of the discussions it had inspired, nestled among the whimsical dreams of the WordWorld villains."},{"instruction":"Разработка стратегий управления рисками и устранение уязвимостей в цепи поставок, связанных с складскими услугами и перевозкой автомобильных компонентов","output":"Разработка стратегий управления рисками и устранение уязвимостей в цепи поставок, связанных со складскими услугами и перевозкой автомобильных компонентов, является важным процессом для обеспечения эффективности и надежности работы данной цепи.

Calcolare lo spostamento totale del veicolo, indicando il modulo, la direzione e il verso","output":"Per calcolare il modulo dello spostamento totale, possiamo utilizzare il Teorema di Pitagora poiché il veicolo si è spostato sia verso Nord che verso Nord-Est, formando un triangolo rettangolo. La distanza verso Nord è 5 km e la distanza verso Nord-Est è 8 km. Quindi il lato Nord-Ovest del triangolo è uguale alla somma delle due distanze: 5 km + 8 km = 13 km. Utilizzando il Teorema di Pitagora, otteniamo che il modulo dello spostamento totale è la radice quadrata di (5^2 + 8^2) = radice quadrata di (25 + 64) = radice quadrata di 89 ≈ 9.43 km. Per determinare la direzione e il verso dello spostamento, possiamo utilizzare la trigonometria. La direzione sarà l'angolo formato tra il lato Nord-Ovest e il lato Nord, e il verso sarà determinato dal verso delle lancette dell'orologio. Per calcolare l'angolo, possiamo utilizzare la funzione arcotangente inversa. Quindi, l'angolo sarà arcotangente(8/5) ≈ 56.31 gradi. La direzione sarà quindi a 56.31 gradi rispetto al Nord. Per determinare il verso, possiamo guardare la forma del triangolo: il lato Nord-Ovest è più lungo del lato Nord, quindi il veicolo si è spostato in senso orario.

Because he's got a child's understanding of death, he starts to cry over the dead bird, and the other villains notice and go to comfort him.","output":"Once upon a time in the city of Fair City, inside their secret lair, the Wordgirl villains gathered at their warehouse base. The notorious group included the elegant and cunning Lady Redundant Woman, the strategically mischievous Dr. Two-Brains, the tough and persistent Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, and the Whammer - known for his childlike innocence and tendency to wham anything in sight. Amidst their usual banter and brainstorming for their next evil plans, a deafening sound resounded within the walls of the warehouse. All heads turned toward the source - the window. Whammer approached it cautiously, his excited smile fading quickly as he peered outside. A pang of sadness washed over him as he discovered a tiny, lifeless bird lying motionless beneath the window. Whammer's understanding of death was very much like that of a child's - a world shrouded in mystery and uncertainty. Tears welled up in his eyes, streaming down his cheeks as he let out a sorrowful cry. The other villains, startled by Whammer's heartbroken reaction, rushed to his side to understand what was happening. Lady Redundant Woman, usually known for her icy demeanor, gently rested a hand on Whammer's shoulder. \\"Whammer, dear, what's the matter?\\" she asked, her voice filled with genuine concern. Sniffling, Whammer managed to utter through his tears, \\"Bird... bird is all dead. Not moving!\\" His words were accompanied by sobs that seemed to come straight from the depths of his innocent heart. Dr. Two-Brains, whose intellect matched his mischievous nature, crouched down beside Whammer. \\"Yes, Whammer, that's indeed a bird. But don't be too sad. It seems like it has reached the end of its life's journey. It's a part of nature.\\" Chuck, the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, who was known for his mechanical skills, joined in the conversation, his voice unexpectedly soft. \\"Whammer, buddy, we all get sad sometimes, especially when we lose someone or something we care about. It's okay to feel sad. It just shows how big your heart really is.\\" Whammer wiped away his tears, sniffling as he listened to his fellow villains' compassionate words. His understanding may have been childlike, but he grasped the compassion and empathy they were offering him. They made him feel comforted and assured. As the group circled around Whammer, they decided to hold a small funeral for the bird. Each of the villains contributed something - a flower, a piece of fabric, a heartfelt word - as they paid their respects to the tiny creature that had unknowingly brought them all together in a moment of shared compassion and understanding. From that day on, whenever Whammer faced difficulties or felt overwhelmed by the complexities of the world, he found solace in the compassion and understanding of his fellow villains. They were no longer just partners in crime but friends who had experienced a shared moment of vulnerability and support. And so, the evil villains of Fair City's warehouse base learned a valuable lesson that day - that even in the midst of their evil endeavors, a shared sense of empathy and compassion could exist, reminding them of the importance of kindness in a world that sometimes seemed so relentless and harsh."},{"instruction":"Whammer is still heartbroken over the dead bird, but his heartbreak turns to shock when he notices a nest full of little baby birds and realizes with sorrow that the dead bird was their mama. Not wanting anything bad to happen to the baby birds, Whammer gently brings them inside.","output":"As Whammer's tears began to subside, a glimmer of curiosity shone in his eyes. Through his tear-blurred vision, he saw something that filled him with both shock and sorrow. Camouflaged amidst the branches, a delicate nest housed several baby birds, their tiny beaks open in anticipation. Whammer's heart sank as the realization struck him like a lightning bolt. The lifeless bird he had found was the mother of these defenseless, chirping creatures. His grief gave way to a newfound determination to protect them at all costs. With great care and tenderness, Whammer extended his large, calloused hands towards the nest. He approached cautiously, afraid of disturbing the little ones, and ever so gently lifted the nest from its precarious perch. Cradled in his hands, the baby birds peered up at their newfound protector, innocent eyes filled with both fear and hope. Whammer, concerned for their well-being, turned to his fellow villains, who had gathered around him, their tones hushed and filled with empathy. \\"What can we do?\\" he asked, his voice filled with a mix of anxiety and unwavering determination. \\"These little birds, they need someone to take care of them.\\" Lady Redundant Woman, touched by Whammer's compassion, stepped forward. \\"Whammer, it seems we must lend a hand to these orphaned birds. Let us pool our resources and provide food, warmth, and comfort until they are ready to take flight on their own.\\" Dr. Two-Brains offered his scientific knowledge, his eyes gleaming with a newfound purpose. \\"I can concoct a nutritious formula to feed them until they can fend for themselves. It will provide them with the sustenance they need to grow strong.\\" Chuck, with his mechanical expertise, suggested fashioning a makeshift nest lined with soft materials to simulate their mother's warmth and care. \\"We can create an environment that nurtures them, just like their mama would have,\\" he suggested, a glimmer of compassion in his eyes. Working together, the villains transformed a corner of their warehouse into a sanctuary for the baby birds. They fashioned a cozy nest, delicately lined with soft cloth and feathers, enveloping it in an atmosphere of warmth and comfort. Dr. Two-Brains carefully mixed a specialized formula, filled with essential nutrients, while Lady Redundant Woman monitored the baby birds' health with utmost care, ensuring their well-being. As days turned into weeks, the baby birds thrived under the collective care of the Wordgirl villains. Whammer, particularly attached to the fragile little creatures, spent hours watching over them, ensuring they felt safe and loved. With each passing day, his sorrow transformed into joy as he witnessed their growth and resilience. The baby birds' wings sprouted, and they began venturing out of the nest, testing their newfound abilities. Whammer, who had once been intense in his desire to wham everything in sight, had matured, his love for these birds transforming him into their gentle protector. When the time came for the baby birds to spread their wings and embark on their own journey, Whammer stood proudly by their side, beaming with joy. With a gentle nudge and an encouraging smile, he watched as they flew off into the vast expanse of the world, ready to take flight and embrace their own destinies. Whammer's transformation had not gone unnoticed by the other villains. They witnessed the might of compassion and the strength it brought to their once chaotic lives. United by their newfound understanding and empathy, they set forth on a path that intertwined not only their evil plans but also small acts of kindness and care for the world around them. And in that warehouse base, an unlikely bond had formed, reminding them all that redemption and love can emerge from even the most unexpected places."},{"instruction":"","output":"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to that information."},{"instruction":"i have a figure of a bridge which sensors location for measurements of strain and displacements. what is a good title for this figure?","output":"\\"Sensor Placement Diagram for Strain and Displacement Monitoring on Bridge Structure\\""},{"instruction":"write bettr: Figure 3 shows the sensor locations used in the experimental study.","output":"Figure 3: Layout of Sensor Deployment for Strain and Displacement Measurements in the Experimental Study"},{"instruction":"as a sentence","output":"Figure 3 illustrates the configuration of sensor placements utilized to measure strain and displacement in the experimental study."},{"instruction":"i wanna write since theres a lot of data i only present a selection, what should i write?","output":"Due to the extensive volume of data collected, this report will only present a curated selection of the most relevant findings."},{"instruction":"i meant of the sensor data and numerical results comparison","output":"Given the substantial amount of sensor data and numerical results obtained, this document will focus on presenting a representative subset that encapsulates the key insights and trends."},{"instruction":"In the following, the measured responses are compared with the results of the numerical model. this study will present a few from each sensors","output":"In the subsequent sections, we will compare the measured responses from the sensors with the outcomes of the numerical model.

La trama principal gira en torno a la ira y la venganza de Aquiles, un guerrero griego, cuyo deseo de gloria es herido cuando Agamenón, el líder del ejército griego, le arrebata a su esclava Briseida. Aquiles se retira de la batalla, dejando a los griegos en desventaja. Mientras tanto, los troyanos, liderados por el príncipe Paris y el rey Héctor, intentan aprovechar la oportunidad para ganar la guerra. A medida que avanzan los enfrentamientos, se suceden las batallas y los dioses intervienen en los eventos para favorecer a una u otra facción.

Después de la muerte de Héctor, su padre, el rey Príamo, lamenta su pérdida y se lleva el cuerpo de su hijo de regreso a Troya para un funeral digno. La Iliada también muestra la intervención de los dioses en los asuntos mortales, las luchas de poder entre los líderes griegos, y la tristeza y desesperación de aquellos que pierden a sus seres queridos en la guerra.

Nu recomand măsuri extreme sau modificări hardware dacă nu ești un tehnician calificat, deoarece acestea pot anula garanția sau pot cauza daune suplimentare. Iată câteva soluții pe care le poți lua în considerare: 1. **Verifică cauza problemelor butonului de pornire:** Înainte de a încerca să porniți laptopul fără butonul power, este important să încercați să determinați de ce butonul nu mai funcționează. Poate fi o simplă problemă de contact sau ceva mai complex, cum ar fi o componentă defectă. 2. **Utilizează orice tastaturi sau combinații de taste suplimentare:** Unele laptopuri pot fi setate să se aprindă când anumite taste sunt apăsate. Această funcție este rară și, de obicei, trebuie configurată în prealabil în BIOS/UEFI. 3. **Deschiderea și pornirea laptopului direct de pe placa de bază:** Acesta este un proces complicat și potențial periculos care implică deschiderea carcasei laptopului și localizarea directă a contactelor electrice pe care butonul de pornire le activează. Nu este o procedură recomandată, iar efectuarea ei poate anula garanția și poate duce la daune iremediabile în caz de eroare. 4. **Serviciul tehnic:** Soluția cea mai sigură și recomandabilă este să contactați un serviciu de reparații autorizat pentru a repara sau înlocui butonul defect. Din păcate, fără butonul de pornire funcțional, nu există o metodă software simplă prin care să poți aprinde laptopul. Dacă mai este încă în garanție, sau chiar dacă nu este, cel mai bine este să apelezi la un centru service autorizat pentru reparații.

One such tool is called \\"LeakedSource\\" (now defunct) which aimed to provide a comprehensive collection of leaked databases. However, it was taken down in early 2017 due to legal issues. Another similar tool is \\"We Leak Info\\" which claims to provide access to various databases as well. The reason why these tools are not widely available or actively developed could be due to legal considerations and ethical concerns. Gathering information from data breaches and making it easily accessible raises privacy concerns and may violate laws in some jurisdictions. Additionally, the misuse of such information can lead to identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities. Moreover, data breaches are typically illegal and organizations are committed to preventing and resolving them.

Suddenly, a baby owl lands right on Whammer's lap, a little confused and dazed ball of fluff that looks up at Whammer with shiny gold eyes.","output":"As Whammer sat under the tree, clutching the origami bird to his chest, tears streaming gently down his face, he suddenly felt a light tap on his lap. Startled, he looked down to find a fluffy ball of feathers wobbling slightly—a baby owl. The little owl blinked its shiny gold eyes, clearly disoriented and unsure of how it had ended up in Whammer's lap. Whammer's tears vanished, replaced by a mixture of surprise and wonder. He cautiously extended a hand towards the owl, and the little creature hopped onto his palm, seeking comfort. \\"Owl friend?\\" Whammer whispered, his voice filled with awe. The other villains, who had noticed Whammer's absence, soon gathered around, their eyes widening at the sight of the baby owl. Granny May gently stroked the owl's feathers, a twinkle of mischief in her eyes. \\"Well, well, Whammer seems to have quite a special friend there,\\" she chuckled, appreciating the irony of the situation. Chuck the Evil Sandwich Making Guy peered closely at the owl. \\"Maybe this little guy knows some secret sandwich recipes!\\" he exclaimed excitedly, rubbing his hands together. Dr. Two-Brains, ever fascinated by animals, approached with curiosity, his two brains working in tandem. \\"Hmm, an owl, Whammer? It seems fate has a strange way of bringing us unexpected companions,\\" he mused. The Butcher, his hands still slightly greasy from his deli counter activities, scratched his head. \\"Whammer, that baby owl must've sensed your gentle heart. It's a sign, my friend.\\" Whammer, cradling the baby owl between his hands, felt a surge of warmth in his chest. He had been inconsolable over the lost bird, and now he had been blessed with the presence of this precious creature. \\"Gentle heart,\\" he repeated softly, as if the words were a revelation. As days passed, the baby owl found solace and sanctuary with Whammer and the other villains. They took turns caring for it, creating a cozy makeshift nest in a corner of their warehouse. Whammer and the owl developed a special bond—with Whammer offering his limitless kindness, and the owl providing a source of comfort and companionship. Whammer named the owl \\"Goldie,\\" in honor of its captivating golden eyes. Together, they explored the secrets of the night sky, with Whammer pointing out constellations and Goldie listening intently. The villains, once focused solely on their evil schemes, now found a newfound purpose in nurturing and protecting this innocent creature. They discovered that their hearts were capable of embracing both villainy and compassion, and that their bonds grew stronger through acts of tenderness. And so, in the heart of darkness, a spark of light had been kindled—a gentle reminder that even villains, with their quirks and flaws, could find redemption and warmth within their souls. And with Whammer and Goldie as their guides, the Wordgirl villains embarked on a journey of self-discovery, where empathy triumphed over malice, and love triumphed over villainy."},{"instruction":"Goldie grows into a lovely barn owl, And Whammer is happy every time he watches her fly. Then one day, she comes back from flying, but she isn't alone; Another barn owl, with darker feathers, follows her and perches on Whammer's other shoulder.","output":"As Goldie grew into a majestic barn owl, her wings expanding and her beauty shining through each flight, Whammer's happiness swelled with pride. He would sit in the open fields near their hideout, his eyes filled with wonder, as he watched her soar high above. One beautiful day, while Whammer eagerly awaited Goldie's return, he noticed her gliding gracefully towards him. But this time, she wasn't alone. Perched on her shoulder was another barn owl, its feathers a darker shade, yet no less enchanting. Whammer's eyes widened in surprise as the second owl landed softly on his other shoulder. He could feel the warmth of its presence and the connection they shared through Goldie. Whammer tentatively reached up a hand to stroke the new owl's feathers. \\"New friend?\\" he whispered, his voice tinged with awe. The rest of the Wordgirl villains, who had gathered nearby to witness Goldie's return, couldn't believe their eyes. Granny May grinned mischievously as she leaned towards Chuck the Evil Sandwich Making Guy. \\"Looks like Whammer's got himself a doppelganger owl friend! Double the trouble, double the fun!\\" Dr. Two-Brains, sporting his characteristic spectacles, studied the new owl with great fascination. \\"Ah, a rare occurrence indeed! Whammer, it seems that fate has chosen to bless you with another companion.\\" The Butcher, always clad in his greasy apron, couldn't contain his excitement. \\"Whammer, two owls on your shoulders! It's like having two protectors, watching over you!\\" Whammer, amazed by the unexpected arrival of the second owl, felt his heart overflow with joy. He had once found solace and friendship in one owl but now had been blessed with two. With time, the two owls, named Goldie and Shadow, grew fond of Whammer. They accompanied him on his daily activities, perched on his shoulders as he practiced his arm wrestling and shared in his laughter and playful antics. Whammer treasured every moment spent with his newfound owl companions, feeling a sense of belonging like never before. Together, they explored the vast night sky, gliding through moonlit clouds, and dancing with the stars. Whammer discovered that Goldie and Shadow had their unique personalities—Goldie, a symbol of grace and enlightenment, and Shadow, a mischievous melancholy that intrigued and charmed him. With Goldie and Shadow by his side, Whammer found solace, love, and a sense of purpose he had never known before. The villains, often seen as adversaries of justice, embraced the owls as members of their ever-growing twisted family, cherishing their newfound connection, and learning the power of love, loyalty, and the beauty of unlikely friendships. And so, with Whammer's shoulder broad enough to carry the weight of two feathered companions, the Wordgirl villains ventured forth, united by their unconventional bonds. Together, they would continue their villainous escapades, but now, with the pure hearts and unfaltering devotion of their owl friends, they would learn that love, in all its forms, had the power to transform even the darkest hearts into beacons of light."},{"instruction":"Whammer wakes up one morning and finds Goldie and Shadow hooting excitedly, beckoning him closer to their nest, where he sees that Goldie actually laid eggs. The two owls hoot proudly.","output":"As the sun began to rise, casting a warm glow over the land, Whammer slowly opened his eyes. He stretched, yawning, and felt a gentle nudge on his arm. He looked up to see Goldie and Shadow hooting excitedly, their eyes shining with anticipation. Curiosity piqued, Whammer followed their gaze, and there, nestled cozily in a small nest atop a nearby tree branch, he discovered a marvelous sight. Goldie had laid eggs, delicate and precious, shining with the promise of new life. Whammer's heart swelled with awe at the miracle before him. \\"Goldie... Shadow… eggs!\\" Whammer exclaimed, his voice filled with wonder and joy. The other villains, who had gathered around the tree, were equally amazed. Granny May clapped her hands together, her mischievous grin widening. \\"Well, well, it seems Goldie and Shadow have brought us the gift of life! How unexpected!\\" Chuck the Evil Sandwich Making Guy jumped up and down, giddy with excitement. \\"New ingredients for a magical sandwich! The mythical egg sandwich, here we come!\\" Dr. Two-Brains, always the scientist, approached the nest, his eyes gleaming with inquisitiveness. \\"Ah, the cycle of life, unfolding before our very eyes. Whammer, this is truly a momentous occasion.\\" The Butcher, his greasy hands momentarily forgotten, gazed at the eggs with reverence. \\"Whammer, it's as if Goldie and Shadow have entrusted you with their future. You are connected on a deeper level now.\\" Whammer, his emotions swirling within him, felt a profound sense of responsibility and pride. He thanked Goldie and Shadow for sharing this miracle with him, crouching down beside the nest to gently stroke their feathers. \\"Whammer protect eggs,\\" he said softly, his voice filled with determination and tenderness. And so, with the birth of these tiny lives, Whammer dedicated himself to safeguarding the eggs. He positioned himself as their unwavering guardian, watching over them day and night. The other villains, who had once reveled in their villainous pursuits, now found themselves transformed by the miracle of life. They joined Whammer in his vigil, each taking turns to stand guard, ensuring the safety and comfort of the eggs. Days turned into weeks, and the eggs remained protected and warm under Whammer's watchful eye. Finally, the moment arrived when delicate cracks appeared on the eggshells. One by one, the baby owlets emerged, their eyes blinking, filled with curiosity and innocence. Whammer's heart swelled with pride and joy as he held each owlet in his massive hands, marveling at the beauty of new life. The villains peered over his shoulder, their eyes shining with newfound tenderness as they witnessed the miracle of birth.

In the midst of our villainous endeavors, we have been touched by the purity and magic of nature.\\" Whammer, cradling the owlets, felt a profound sense of awe. With Goldie and Shadow, they had created a family—a family bound not by blood, but by love and shared experiences. Together, they would embark on a journey, nurturing these owlets and helping them find their place in the world. And so, in the heart of their secret hideout, beneath the banner of villainy, a nest brimming with love, warmth, and newfound purpose had been created. The Wordgirl villains, united by their extraordinary connection to the owlets, learned that even in the midst of darkness, life had a way of illuminating their hearts, transforming them into guardians of hope, protectors of innocence, and champions of the extraordinary."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},W={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},P={key:1};function F(i,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):u("",!0)]),t("div",W,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",L,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
