This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences?

Kelley deftly employs vivid imagery, anaphora, rhetorical questioning, and parallelism to not only depict the harsh realities faced by child workers but also to galvanize her audience into action. The effectiveness of these rhetorical strategies and how they fortify her argument will be further examined throughout this essay. Kelley's strategic use of vivid imagery lays bare the dire working conditions of children in factories. By detailing the long, grueling nights where \\"thousands of little girls\\" toil amidst the \\"deafening noise of the spindles and the looms,\\" she elicits a visceral reaction from her listeners, compelling them to empathize with the plight of the young laborers. This emotional engagement is crucial as it fuels a collective desire for change. Furthermore, Kelley’s calculated repetition of the words \\"children\\" and \\"they,\\" and her consistent application of parallel sentence structures throughout the speech, ensures that the focus remains unerringly on the victims of child labor. Kelley’s persistent reiteration acts as a hammer driving her point home, accentuating the urgency and gravity of the issue. The rhetorical questions posed by Kelley serve a dual purpose. Not only do they underscore the moral deficiencies in the laws of the time, but they also challenge her audience to contemplate the societal implications of denying women the vote, directly relating it to the perpetuation of child labor abuses. As Kelley questions the legislative decisions in Georgia and New Jersey, she implicitly argues that female enfranchisement is essential for societal reform, thereby expanding her argument beyond child labor to encompass the broader women’s suffrage movement. In sum, Florence Kelley expertly wields rhetoric to lay out a convincing argument against the exploitation of child labor. This essay aims to delve deeper into the specific rhetorical strategies Kelley uses and express why they are instrumental in influencing her audience to join her campaign for better working conditions and child labor laws."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

This is the main idea in the speech from Florence Kelley, who was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved working conditions for working women. Her speech had been delivered before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Through the use of rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as “children and they”, similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions she hopes to convince the audience at the National American Woman Suffrage Association to take a stance against child labor. The author employs these rhetorical strategies effectively in convincing her audience; how and why these strategies are effective will be discussed in the rest of this essay. Florence Kelly’s use of vivid descriptions of working conditions not only helps the audience visualize the atrocities of child labor at factories, they also help in strengthening her argument about child labor. In the quote “Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through in the deafening of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving [several different fabrics] and ribbons for us to buy” sheds light on how children are being overworked to point that they aren’t getting sleep and establish an emotional appeal which is effective at making us feel sorry or pitiful to hear or even visualize for that matter the atrocities of child labor and cement the idea in audience’s heads that they should take a stance against child labour. The repetitions of the words children and they, again and again and the use of repeated sentence structures over the span of the entire text is effective due to the fact that the speech was being listened instead of being read so Kelly’s goal would be that her audience understood her argument and cement the idea in their heads. A good examples of this is from quote “The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills… they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. … They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden,robbed of school life that they may work for us.” The quote’s use of similar sentence structures and word “they”, is important because the use of similar structures emphasizes her argument in an impactful way. The use of rhetorical questions make her points more dramatic and persuasive to shape how the audience think about child labour. A good of how she uses rhetorical questions is the quote “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?” This quote highlights the injustice and raises awareness about the need for change and also is because the questions are a powerful tool in shaping the audience's perspective and provoking deeper thoughts on important issues. Florence Kelley effectively uses rhetorical strategies such as vivid descriptions of working conditions for children, the repetitions of the words such as children and they, and similar sentence structures and the use of rhetorical questions to not only inform her audience but to get them to take a stance with her against child labor. The prompt the essay was written for: Florence Kelley (1859-1932) was a United States social worker and reformer who fought successfully for child labor laws and improved conditions for working women. She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

Revised Essay: Florence Kelley, a crusader for social justice, wields a mighty pen in the service of children and female laborers, crafting a compelling argument designed to galvanize the National American Woman Suffrage Association into action. In her impassioned speech delivered in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905, Kelley masterfully employs a tapestry of rhetorical strategies to illuminate the dark corners of child labor and to incite her listeners to champion the cause of these voiceless innocents. By dissecting her astute use of vivid descriptions, anaphora through repeated phrases, and piercing rhetorical questions, this essay endeavors to unpack the potency of her oratory and why it resonates deeply with its audience, urging them to forsake passivity in favor of impactful advocacy. Kelley’s rhetoric, rich in vivid descriptions, portrays the grueling reality of child labor with an immediacy that is virtually palpable. Phrases such as “little girls...working all the night through in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms,” encapsulate not only the physical toil but also the sensory overload these children must endure. Such descriptions are strategic, intended to evoke a visceral reaction from her audience—one of distress and empathy—thus strengthening her argument by forging an emotional bond between her listeners and the subjected children. This emotional response is crucial as it translates into an ethical imperative: the audience, stirred to their core, becomes more inclined to align with Kelley's call to action to combat child labor. The strategic repetition of words like \\"children\\" and \\"they,\\" and the maintenance of parallel sentence structures throughout Kelley's speech, serves a dual purpose. First, it ingratiates the plight of the children into the minds of Kelley's listeners. By constantly referring to the children and their labors, she ensures that the gravity of the issue remains at the forefront of the conversation, impossible to disregard or forget. Second, the repetitions function rhythmically, lending a hypnotic quality to her speech that makes it simultaneously more memorable and more persuasive. Kelley's emphasis on these words underscores the pervasiveness of child labor across industries—a tactic that helps to unify her audience under a common cause. Moreover, Kelley skillfully interweaves rhetorical questions into her speech to confront the audience with the harrowing societal failures that permit such injustices against children to persist. The rhetorical questions compel the audience to consider hypothetical yet powerful scenarios, such as, “If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age?” These strategically placed questions do more than just seek answers; they challenge the audience's moral compass, they indict systemic apathy, and they cast the situation as a personal and civic responsibility. Kelley doesn’t just pose these questions—she invokes them as a damning reflection of a society that has yet to prioritize the wellbeing of its youngest members, thereby supporting her broader message that advocacy and enfranchisement are critical tools in the fight for reform. The culmination of these rhetorical strategies is not merely a call to pity or a presentation of facts. Kelley weaves together a narrative that is at once a wake-up call and a rallying cry, demanding that those who bear witness to her words cannot leave the room unchanged or unmoved. Kelley's plea is a testament to the power of the suffrage movement not just for women's rights, but for a more compassionate society concerned with the welfare of all of its citizens, regardless of age or station. Through her sophisticated understanding of the dire reality these children face and her skilled manipulation of rhetoric to convey this message, Florence Kelley's speech lives on as an enduring beacon of advocacy and a compelling example of the persuasive power of well-chosen words in the right context. Thus, she leaves an indelible mark on her listeners and on history, beckoning all who hear her words to walk the arduous path of justice and reform by her side."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

This structure is called A melo, B melo, Chorus, and D melo for bridge. If the song doesn’t have a Leadin, they often will completely ignore it as too western. Simplify this and provide an example","output":"The typical structure of a J-Pop song, often categorized using the terms A melo, B melo, Chorus, and D melo, can be simplified to: 1. A melo (Verse): The first part of the song that introduces the melody and sets up the story or theme. 2. B melo (Leadin): A pre-chorus that builds tension and leads into the chorus. Sometimes omitted if considered too Western. 3. Chorus: The catchy and often repeated part of the song that contains the main message or hook. 4. A melo (Verse): The second verse that continues the story or theme, often with slight variations from the first verse. 5. B melo (Leadin): Another lead-in to the chorus, similar to the earlier pre-chorus. 6. Chorus: Repeating the main hook for familiarity and impact. 7. D melo (Bridge): A section that provides a contrast to the rest of the song, often changing the dynamics or feel before leading back into the chorus. 8. Chorus: Repeated one or more times, commonly featuring a key change in the final repetition to add a sense of climax. A typical example of this structure can be seen in the song \\"Heavy Rotation\\" by AKB48, a popular idol group in Japan. In the song, you can distinctly hear the verse (A melo), a pre-chorus leading to the chorus, the second verse, lead-in, and chorus again, followed by a bridge (D melo). The song ends with repeated choruses that embody the J-Pop style."},{"instruction":"Here's a rather famous Jpop song, Racing into the Night by Yoasobi. It's a bit western, but it'll do. Break down the song into the typical J-Pop structure, if applicable.","output":"\\"Racing Into the Night\\" (original title: \\"Yoru ni Kakeru\\") by YOASOBI is indeed a popular J-Pop song that has achieved considerable success. The song's structure can be analyzed as follows, keeping in mind common J-Pop song structures and noting deviations that may reflect Western influence or the song's unique characteristics: 1. Intro: The song begins with a distinctive instrumental introduction that sets the mood for the song. 2. A melo (Verse 1): The first verse sets up the narrative, introducing listeners to the characters and themes of the song. 3. B melo (Pre-Chorus): This section builds up the tension, leading into the chorus, with lyrics and music that transition from the verse mood to the high energy of the chorus. 4. Chorus: This section is the catchy, memorable part of the song which usually contains the core message or the emotional peak of the song. In \\"Yoru ni Kakeru,\\" this is where the melody and energy pick up significantly. 5. A melo (Verse 2): The second verse continues the narrative of the song, often with different lyrics but a similar melody to the first verse. 6. B melo (Pre-Chorus): Just like the first pre-chorus, this section builds up tension towards the second chorus. 7. Chorus: The chorus repeats, solidifying the theme and melody in the listener's mind. 8. D melo (Bridge): The bridge offers a contrast to the chorus and verses, providing a break that often includes a change in the dynamics, energy, or emotional tone. 9. Chorus / Outro: A final repetition of the chorus solidifies the song's hook, and YOASOBI often includes an extension of the chorus or an outro that functions as a conclusion to the song's narrative as well as its musical journey. The structure of \\"Yoru ni Kakeru\\" fits well within the described J-Pop framework, with each part contributing to a cohesive story told through music and lyrics. YOASOBI's music, while still reflecting traditional J-Pop structures, is also known for its modern sound and production techniques, which may lead to a blend of Japanese and Western pop styles."},{"instruction":"what does it mean when someone says choords with extensions","output":"When someone refers to \\"chords with extensions,\\" they are talking about chords that have notes added beyond the basic triad. A typical triad chord consists of the root, third, and fifth. Extensions involve adding notes that are intervals beyond the octave of the root note, such as the 7th, 9th, 11th, or 13th. These extended chords create more complex, colorful, and nuanced sounds and are commonly used in jazz, funk, and other styles that favor harmonic richness. Here’s a breakdown of these extensions: - 7th: The note that is seven diatonic steps up from the root, providing more depth than a basic triad. - 9th: This includes the 7th plus a note that is two steps further, essentially the same as the second note but an octave above. - 11th: This includes the 7th and the 9th, with an additional note that is four steps further than the 9th, which is essentially the fourth note but two octaves above. - 13th: This includes all previous extensions and also adds a note that is six steps further than the 11th, equivalent to the sixth note but two octaves above. When adding extensions, it's not always necessary to include every note in the series. For example, in a 13th chord, the 11th is often omitted to avoid dissonance with the 3rd, and to make the chord more practical to play on certain instruments. Here's an example of a typical extended chord: - Cmaj7 (C major 7) consists of C (root), E (major third), G (perfect fifth), and B (major seventh). - C9 would include the previous plus D (the ninth). - C11 would include the previous plus F (the eleventh). - C13 would include the previous but might omit the 11th and include A (the thirteenth). Chord extensions can also have alterations (e.g., #9, b13) to even further change their flavor and function within a progression."},{"instruction":"In a nutshell, explain Jpop and what makes it unique","output":"J-pop, short for Japanese pop music, is a genre that emerges from Japan and incorporates a wide range of musical styles, including rock, electronic, hip-hop, and traditional Japanese music.

Beyond classes, functions, and object literals, here are more JavaScript features: 1. **Promises and Async/Await**: For handling asynchronous operations, JavaScript offers Promises and the async/await syntax, allowing for writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion. 2. **Arrow Functions**: Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions and share the lexical \`this\` of the surrounding code. 3. **Modules**: JavaScript supports modular programming through the use of ES6 modules, which can export and import functions, objects, or primitives from one module to another. 4. **Template Literals**: These are string literals that allow for embedded expressions, multiline strings, and easy string interpolation using backticks. 5. **Destructuring Assignment**: A syntax that allows the unpacking of values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. 6. **Spread and Rest Operators**: The spread operator \`...\` allows an iterable to expand in places where arguments or elements are expected. The rest operator looks the same but is used to merge a list of function arguments into an array. 7. **Default Parameters**: You can initialize named parameters with default values if no value or \`undefined\` is passed. 8. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them. Examples include \`.map()\`, \`.reduce()\`, \`.filter()\`, and more. 9. **Generators**: Functions that can be exited and later re-entered, allowing them to produce a sequence of values over time. 10. **Proxies**: They allow you to create an object that wraps another object or function and intercepts and redefines fundamental operations for that object. 11. **Symbols**: A unique and immutable primitive introduced in ES6 that can be used as the key of an Object property. 12. **Set and Map Data Structures**: \`Set\` is a collection of distinct values, and \`Map\` is a collection of keyed data items, both providing useful alternatives to traditional Object-based collections. 13. **WeakSet and WeakMap**: Variants of \`Set\` and \`Map\` that hold \\"weak\\" references to their contents, meaning if there are no other references to an object stored in a WeakSet/WeakMap, they can be garbage collected. 14. **Typed Arrays**: Arrays that provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data. 15. **Internationalization and Localization**: JavaScript provides APIs to support internationalization, which help in formatting numbers, dates, and strings, besides enabling language-sensitive string comparison. 16. **Fetch API**: Allows you to perform network requests to fetch resources and uses Promises for a simpler, cleaner API compared to the older XMLHTTPRequest. 17. **Event Loop & Concurrency Model**: JavaScript has a single-threaded event loop mechanism that allows asynchronous operations without multi-threading complexity. These features significantly contribute to the versatility of JavaScript, enabling the development of complex and highly interactive web applications. As JavaScript continues to evolve, more features are added to the language, often influenced by the needs of the community and advancements in web development."},{"instruction":"javascript default parameters ?????","output":"In JavaScript, default parameters allow you to initialize named parameters with default values if no value or \`undefined\` is passed to the function. This feature was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and helps create functions with more predictable behavior and less boilerplate code to check for undefined or null values. Here's the basic syntax for default parameters: \`\`\`javascript function myFunction(param1 = defaultValue1, param2 = defaultValue2) { // function body } \`\`\` If you call \`myFunction()\` without any arguments, \`param1\` will be equal to \`defaultValue1\`, and \`param2\` will be equal to \`defaultValue2\`. If you pass an argument, that argument will overwrite the default value. Here's an example with default parameters in action: \`\`\`javascript function greet(name = 'stranger') { console.log(\`Hello, {name}!\`); } greet('Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice! greet(); // Output: Hello, stranger! \`\`\` In this example, the function \`greet\` can be called with a \`name\` argument to personalize the greeting. If it is called without any argument, it will default to greeting a 'stranger'. Before the introduction of default parameters, you would have to manually check if \`name\` was provided and assign a default value within the function body: \`\`\`javascript function greet(name) { name = (typeof name !== 'undefined') ? name : 'stranger'; console.log(\`Hello, {name}!\`); } \`\`\` Default parameters provide a cleaner and more straightforward way to handle this kind of logic."},{"instruction":"provide me more javascript features, make a list of 20 of them","output":"JavaScript offers a rich set of features and functionalities that keep growing with each update to the ECMAScript standard.

These features enhance the language's capabilities, enabling developers to write more expressive, concise, and maintainable code in both client-side and server-side environments."},{"instruction":"explain generators","output":"Generators in JavaScript are a powerful feature that allows a function to generate an iterable sequence of values on a per-request basis, pausing its execution between each value emission, and resuming where it left off. This makes it possible to maintain state across re-entrance. Generators are defined using the function* syntax, and they generate values using the \`yield\` keyword. Here is an example: \`\`\`javascript function* numberGenerator() { let i = 0; while (true) { yield i++; } } \`\`\` In the above example, \`numberGenerator\` is a generator function that yields an infinite sequence of numbers, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 with each call. To use a generator, you must first invoke the generator function, which returns a generator object. The generator object adheres to both the iterable protocol and the iterator protocol, which means that it can be iterated over using the \`for...of\` loop, or manually by calling its \`.next()\` method. When \`.next()\` is called, the generator's body is executed up to the next \`yield\` expression, which specifies the value to be returned from the iterator. The process can be paused indefinitely until \`.next()\` is called again. Here is how you can use the \`numberGenerator\`: \`\`\`javascript const numbers = numberGenerator(); // Doesn't execute numberGenerator yet console.log(numbers.next().value); // 0 console.log(numbers.next().value); // 1 console.log(numbers.next().value); // 2 // ...and so on \`\`\` The generator's \`.next()\` method returns an object with two properties: \`value\` and \`done\`. The \`value\` property contains the yielded value, and the \`done\` property is a boolean indicating whether the generator has completed its execution. Generators also support early termination through the \`.return()\` method and capturing errors using the \`.throw()\` method, which can be used to handle exceptions inside the generator function. Generators are useful for scenarios where you need to generate values on the fly without needing to compute and store the entire series upfront, which can be memory-intensive. This makes them naturally suitable for tasks like lazy iteration, handling infinite sequences, and managing asynchronous programming flows, especially before the advent of async/await syntax."},{"instruction":"lets say a sword swings every 0.6 seconds.

사진 찍기가 부담스럽잖아?’ 오늘 현장에는 기자들도 참관했다. 물론, 홍보용을 위한 방문이었다. 크랭크업을 세상에 알려야 했으니까. 더불어 대여섯 메이킹 팀도 바삐 움직이고 있었다. 그렇게. “컷, 뒤쪽 구도로 다시.” ‘거머리’의 촬영 속도가 붙었다. 강우진과 심한호의 컷은 약 1시간 정도만이 끝났고, 바로 오희령이 투입됐다. 솔로 컷으로 30분 정도. 다음은 다시 강우진과 오희령. 이어서 진재준. 심한호와 진재준. 숱한 배우들이 교체되고 세트도 바뀐다. 백여 명 스탭들은 일사불란하게 움직였다. “여기 반사판 하나 추가!!” “갑니다!” 시간이 녹는 와중에도 농도가 짙다. 아침 일찍 시작된 촬영이었으나, 금세 점심을 넘어 오후에 접어들었다. 도중에 쉬는 시간은 있었으나 그 누구도 제대로 휴식을 취하진 않았다. 강우진도 마찬가지였다. ‘아, 그러고 보니 나 오늘 아공간 들어갔었나?’ 평소라면 몇 번이고 아공간에 진입해 쉬었을 우진도 오늘은 아공간에 전혀 들어가지 않았다. 현장의 기세에, 흐름에 정신이 팔려 달려온 것이었다. 강우진은 자신의 차례를 기다리면서도 양손을 펴서는 내려봤다. 땀 때문에 살짝 끈끈했지만 묘한 전율도 느껴졌다. ‘나쁘지 않아, 이 기분.’ 많다면 많고 적다면 적은 경험이다. 그럼에도 늘 저릿한 감각이 온몸을 휘감았다. ‘뭔가- 외줄을 타는 느낌?’ 고지가 코앞에 보이는 외줄이었다. 출렁출렁 위험천만하지만 이 외줄을 전부 건너면 짜릿함은 배가 된다. 어느새 늦은 점심. 하늘은 어둑어둑하다. 그러나 종합세트장에 진을 친 ‘거머리’ 현장은 각종 조명들로 번쩍번쩍했다. “액션.” 끝없이 생명이 이어질 것처럼 생기가 돈다. 그리고 약 1시간 뒤. “컷, 다음!” 이윽고 모니터 앞에 앉았던 안가복 감독이 두 배우를 호출했다. 강우진과 풀정장을 입은 진재준이었다. 촬영에 앞서 간단한 동선 리허설을 위함이었지만. “······잘 부탁해요.” “예, 감독님.” “알겠습니다.” 실제로는 노장 안가복 감독 나름의 응원이기도 했다. 지금 찍을 씬이 ‘거머리’의 촬영 콘티의 마지막 부분이었으니까. 즉, 마지막 촬영 씬이 당도했다. 한편, LA. 드넓은 회의실. 커다란 창밖으로 깨알 같은 건물들이 보인다. 야경이 화려하다. 그만큼 이 회의실이 높다는 얘기였다. 밖의 풍경은 과연 LA구나 싶을 정도로 웅장한 느낌이 풍겼다. 물론, 이 회의실 자체도 대단하다면 대단했다. 크기도 어마무시하지만 꾸며진 것이 예사롭지 않았다. 중앙에 비치된 ㅁ자 책상은 얼추 50명은 거뜬히 앉을 수 있을 듯했고, 벽면에 붙은 숱한 영화 포스터들은 죄다 헐리웃을 대표하는 히트작이었다. 뭣보다 가구나 기타 비품들도 고급진 것이 뭔가 호화로운 호텔의 룸을 연상케 했다. 그런 회의실에 많은 외국인들이 몰렸다. 민머리, 뚱뚱한, 얄쌍한, 키가 길쭉한, 몸집이 비대한 등등. 언뜻 봐도 각양각색의 외형을 지닌 외국인들. 최소 20명에 가깝다. 죄다 헐리웃에서 한 가닥쯤 하는 인물들이었다. 그중. ‘세상에.’ ㅁ자 책상 중간쯤 앉은 외국인 여자가 눈에 띄었다. 갈색 단발에 정장을 입은, 헐리웃 유명 캐스팅 디렉터 메건 스톤이었다. 그녀는 회의실에 모인 인물들을 보며 살짝 감탄하고 있었다. ‘······프리 프로덕션이 본격적으로 들어가지도 않았는데, 벌써 팀을 이 정도나 꾸렸다고?’ 심지어 다들 기술이나 이름값이 출중한 능력자들이었다. 물론, 메건도 반 이상의 인물과 안면이 있기에 인사를 마친 뒤였다. 현재도 다들 여유가 넘치는 표정으로 서로 담소를 나누기 바빴다. ‘그래. 딱 봐도 작정한 티가 나. 최근 봤던 팀들 중에서는 가장 힘이 좋다 싶은데?’ 과연, 헐리웃에서도 공룡급으로 취급되는 대형 영화사 ‘유니버설 무비스’라 이건가? 최근 메건도 캐스팅을 받았다. 뭐, 헐리웃이라는 시장에서 매 작품마다 팀을 최대한 화려하게 꾸리는 건 으레 볼 수 있는 광경이지만, 감독을 섭외하기 전부터 이렇게 판이 커지는 건 처음 보는 메건이었다. ‘이만한 인물들을 초기에 모은 건- 역시 ‘유니버설 무비스’의 힘만으로는 조금 어렵지.’ 순간, 메건의 머릿속에 유명 프로듀서 한 명이 스쳤다. ‘유니버설 무비스’가 섭외에 공을 들이고 있다는 그 남자. 분명, 영화사의 규모가 크다면 능력자들을 모으는 데에 수월하겠지만, 진짜 필요한 핵심은 영화 제작에 있어 가장 강대한 힘을 뿌릴 수 있는 총괄 프로듀서였다. 헐리웃에선 감독보다 프로듀서의 영향력이 몇 배는 더 세다. 그때. -스윽. 나름 부산스런 회의실로 돌연 거인 한 명이 등장했다. 위아래 검은색 옷으로 통일한, 턱 봐도 거대하다 싶은 거인 조셉 펠튼이었다. 자신의 팀 인원 몇몇과 여유 있게 입장한 그는, ㅁ자 책상에 앉은 능력자들과 간단히 인사를 나누면서도 상석 쪽으로 움직였다. 와중 조셉은 메건과 간단한 눈인사를 나누기도 했다. 뭐가 됐든. “······” “······” 조셉 펠튼의 등장에 회의실의 십수 명 능력자들이 입을 다물었다. 그저 상석 쪽에 선 거인을 볼 뿐. 역시 흑인 조셉의 포스는 남달랐다. 작게 웃고는 있지만 그가 풍기는 에너지는 호락호락하지 않다. 워낙에 덩치가 어마무시하기도 했고. 곧. “음-” 작게 침음을 뱉던 조셉이 모두를 보며 영어를 뱉었다. “반갑습니다, 이번 영화 총괄 프로듀서를 맡은 조셉 펠튼입니다. 오랜만에 뵌 분도 계시고 며칠 전에도 뵀던 분들도 계시네요. 하하.” 그의 간단한 인사에 약간 딱딱하던 분위기가 풀렸다. 조셉에게 손을 흔드는 외국인도 몇몇 보였으니까. 이쯤 조셉은 옆의 부하에게 태블릿을 전해 받았고, 눈치가 빠른 회의실 인원들 역시 앞에 놓인 태블릿을 조작했다. 이어 조셉이 중간쯤 앉은 메건과 시선을 맞춘 채 다시 입을 열었다. “먼저 진척부터 알려드리죠, 사전에 저나 또는 영화사에서 들으셨겟지만 시놉은 트리트먼트 작업에 돌입했습니다. 제가 판단해 이번 작품을 잘 쓸 수 있는 작가 5명에게 시놉이 넘어간 상태예요.” 순간, 캐디 메건은 자신이 스카웃 됐을 당시, 영화사 측에서 보였던 시놉을 상기했다. ‘모티브는 지킬 앤 하이드. 거기에 해리성 인격장애 설정도 포함이야, 분명 풀어내는 게 쉽지는 않겠지.’ 한국과 헐리웃의 영화 제작 시스템은 비슷한 점이 있으면서도, 전혀 판이한 양상을 보인다. 일단 영화사에서 먼저 영화의 기본 컨셉이나 시놉을 만들어낸다. 그 뒤에 프로듀서를 고용하고, 고용된 프로듀서는 완성된 시놉을 헐리웃 유명 각본가들에게 넘긴다. 물론, 이 각본가들이 확정된 것은 아니다. 차후 완성된 시나리오를 픽하는 것에 가깝다. 그 뒤에 영화감독을 컨택하고 팀도 꾸린다. 이것이 헐리웃의 기본 베이스였다. 당연히 헐리웃에서 명망 높은 감독이 프로듀서를 겸직하기도 하는데, 그건 정말 헐리웃에서 상위 티어 감독들이나 가능한 것. 어쨌든 몇십 분간 브리핑을 잇던 조셉이 보던 태블릿을 내리며 웃었다. “다들 알고 계시겠지만, 지금이 가장 예민하면서도 시간을 잡아먹는 구간입니다. 하지만 이미 투자 부분은 해결이 된 상태이니만큼, 시나리오가 나오는 그 순간부터 속력이 붙을 예정입니다.” 말을 마친 조셉이 캐디 팀에 시선을 붙였다. 즉, 메건이었다. “이미 시놉을 보셨을 테니까, 캐디 팀은 지금부터 준수한 배우들 리스트를 만들어 주세요. 언제든 필요하다면 연락하시고.” 갈색 머리를 쓸어 넘긴 메건이 고개를 끄덕였다. “네, 그러죠.” 뒤로 약 2시간은 회의가 지속됐다. 간단한 잡담도 있었지만, 영화 제작 관련해서 진지한 얘기가 오가기도 했다. 그렇게 회의가 끝나자, 모였던 능력자들이 대강 인사를 하면서도 드넓은 회의실을 빠져나갔다. 다만, 상석 쪽에 선 거인 조셉은 남았고. -슥. 그런 그에게 메건이 붙었다. 인기척에 팀 인원과 대화하던 조셉이 고개를 돌렸다. “메건, ‘라스트 킬3’에 이어 이번에도 잘 부탁해요.” “저도요.” 짧게 답한 메건이 조셉의 팀 인원들을 힐끔했다. 조셉은 눈치가 빠른 남자였다. 그가 팀들에게 고개를 돌렸다. “먼저 나가들 있어요.” 금세 회의실에는 조셉과 메건만 남았다. 먼저 물꼬를 튼 것은 메건이었다. “나를 이 영화에 추천한 게 당신이죠?” “음? 글쎄요.” “‘유니버설 무비스’와 나는 인연이 그리 깊진 않아요.” “중요한 건 능력이죠, 난 메건 당신의 능력을 높이 사는 편이고.” 미소짓는 조셉을 가만히 올려보던 메건이 작게 헛기침했다. “큼, 고마워요.” “배우 리스트업. 잘 부탁해요, 지금부터 모아줘요. 배역에 상관없이 일단 폼이 좋은 순으로.” 잠시 멈칫하던 메건이 작게 숨을 뱉으며 말했다. “솔직히 나는 이 시놉을 봤을 때 강우진이 떠올랐어요. 특히, 해리성 인격장애 부분에서. 강우진 그는 연기 속 자아를 자유자재로.” “알아요.” 메건의 말을 끊은 조셉이 팔짱 꼈다. “그가 욕심나는 건 당신만이 아니지. 잘 어울릴 듯한 작품을 찾고 있었고.” “······무슨 소리죠?” 되물음에 조셉의 대답은 간단했다. “이 작품을 선택한 게 모두 의도적이라는 얘기죠.” < 역사 (4) > 끝","output":"< History (4) > Woojin Kang arrived at the 'Leech' comprehensive set in Jeonju. As soon as he appeared, the scene was bustling with about a hundred staff members running around, and a staff member's shout spread through the walkie-talkie. \\"Mr. Woojin Kang has arrived!!\\" Amidst this, Woojin sensed that the atmosphere of the set he often visited was unusually tense. 'Ugh- doesn't the air feel a bit heavy?' It made sense. If there were no problems, today would be the 'Leech's' crank-up. That is, it would be the last day of shooting. Everyone's spirit was exceptional. It was a scene that had become quite familiar to Woojin Kang. 'The 'Face Parasite' team was like this too.' If we're talking about recent times, it would be 'Face Parasite,' but the atmosphere of all the works he had been through was consistent. Even on a normal day, they never did anything half-heartedly, but as the end approached, their energy doubled. 'Well, I understand. The beauty of finishing well? Or maybe it feels like the last day of an exam.' Especially since 'Leech's' goal was not a domestic release. It was Cannes, a huge international film festival worldwide. From director An Gabok to the actors and staff, everyone had been rolling up their sleeves to participate in that battlefield. Today couldn't be meaningless to everyone. Therefore, Woojin, with a poker face. 'Phew- I'm strangely nervous, seems like I need to work even harder than usual.' He declared inwardly, trying to hide his increasingly rapid heartbeat. Let's be more alert, whether it's acting or whatever. Well, it's not like he ever did anything half-heartedly, but such a resolution isn't bad, is it? As Woojin's face became firmer, he did not stop his mind control. Then, Woojin Kang, after making his way through numerous staff, arrived in front of a large tent used as the actors' waiting room. All the main actors had already arrived and were waiting. Big stars like Shim Hanho, Oh Heeryung, Jin Jaejoon, Han Sojin, and so on. Of course, Woojin wasn't late. It was just that they had stayed at a nearby accommodation yesterday and arrived earlier. Anyway. \\"Ah, you're here.\\" Director An Gabok, with his short white hair and more pronounced wrinkles, showed a small smile to Woojin as he stood in front of the actors. In his hand was the shooting script. It must be today's, the last script for 'Leech.' Woojin Kang bowed to director An Gabok and lowered his voice. \\"Yes, director.\\" Woojin also greeted all the senior actors. Most of them responded casually. The expressions of all the actors were serious. No different from the atmosphere on set today. They were already focusing. Woojin felt slightly tense inside, but soon he let himself flow with the rhythm. The legendary director An Gabok was giving the actors their last remarks. \\"Don't rush just because it's the crank-up. Let's do it just like usual, the same as always.\\" Director An Gabok, who usually didn't give much directing, also kept his advice about the last shooting brief. \\"Alright, let's do this. We start with Hanho and Woojin. Standby in 30 minutes.\\" A few dozen minutes later. The shooting of 'Leech' officially began. \\"Hey- Action.\\" Today's first scene started with Woojin Kang and Shim Hanho. Woojin, who raised 'Park Hasung,' and Shim Hanho, who portrayed 'Chairman Yoon Jungbae,' sparked a quiet flame. Sensitive and tense. Not just the two actors, but the entire set was like that. About a hundred staff members with closed mouths, director An Gabok watching the monitor, actors spending time watching the performance instead of the tent. Moreover. 'As expected- the atmosphere on set is hot, my mouth is dry.' 'Was it always this intense? Taking photos feels burdensome, doesn't it?' Today, reporters were also observing the set. Of course, it was a visit for promotional purposes. They had to announce the crank-up to the world. In addition, about half a dozen making-of teams were also moving busily. And so. \\"Cut, let's do it again from the back angle.\\" The shooting of 'Leech' picked up speed. The cut with Woojin Kang and Shim Hanho ended in about an hour, and then Oh Heeryung was brought in. A solo cut for about 30 minutes. Next, Woojin Kang and Oh Heeryung again. Then Jin Jaejoon. Shim Hanho and Jin Jaejoon. Numerous actors were replaced, and the set changed. About a hundred staff members moved in perfect order. \\"Add one more reflector here!!\\" \\"Coming!\\" Even as time melted away, the intensity was thick. The shooting that started early in the morning quickly passed lunchtime and entered the afternoon. There were breaks in between, but no one really took a proper rest. Woojin Kang was no exception. 'Ah, did I enter the pocket space today?' Woojin, who would have entered the pocket space several times to rest on a normal day, had not entered the pocket space at all today. He had been swept away by the momentum and flow of the set. While waiting for his turn, Woojin Kang spread his hands and looked down at them. They were slightly sticky with sweat, but he also felt a strange thrill. 'Not bad, this feeling.' It was an experience that was both plentiful and scarce. Yet, a tingling sensation wrapped around his entire body. 'Somewhat- like walking a tightrope?' It was a tightrope with the summit in sight. Wobbly and dangerous, but once you cross the entire tightrope, the thrill doubles. Before long, it was late lunchtime. The sky was getting dark. However, the 'Leech' set, which had set up camp at the comprehensive set, was sparkling with various lights. \\"Action.\\" Life seemed to flow endlessly. And about an hour later. \\"Cut, next!\\" Eventually, director An Gabok, who had been sitting in front of the monitor, called the two actors. It was Woojin Kang and Jin Jaejoon, who was in full dress. It was for a simple rehearsal of movements before shooting. \\"......Please take care of it.\\" \\"Yes, director.\\" \\"Understood.\\" In reality, it was also a form of encouragement from the veteran director An Gabok. The scene they were about to shoot was the last part of the 'Leech's' shooting script. That is, the last shooting scene had arrived. Meanwhile, in LA. A spacious conference room. Tiny buildings could be seen through the large windows. The night view was splendid. It meant that this conference room was high up. The view outside was truly majestic, befitting LA. Of course, the conference room itself was also impressive. It was not only huge in size but also extraordinarily decorated. The ㅁ-shaped desk in the center seemed to easily accommodate about 50 people, and the numerous movie posters on the walls were all hit works representing Hollywood. Above all, the furniture and other items were also luxurious, reminiscent of a luxurious hotel room. Many foreigners had gathered in such a conference room. Bald, fat, slender, tall, and bulky, etc. At a glance, foreigners of various appearances. Nearly 20 people, all of whom were significant figures in Hollywood. Among them. 'My goodness.' A foreign woman seated around the middle of the ㅁ-shaped desk caught the eye. It was Megan Stone, a famous Hollywood casting director, dressed in a brown bob and a suit. She was slightly amazed as she looked at the people gathered in the conference room. '......The pre-production hasn't even started in earnest, and they've already formed a team this big?' Moreover, they were all capable individuals with outstanding skills or name value. Of course, Megan knew more than half of them, so after greeting them, everyone in the conference room was busy chatting leisurely. 'That's right. It's clear they're determined. Among the teams I've seen recently, this one seems to have the most power, doesn't it?' Indeed, was this the power of 'Universal Movies,' a dinosaur-level major film company in Hollywood? Megan had also been cast recently. Well, in the Hollywood market, it's common to see teams formed as glamorously as possible for each project, but Megan, who had never seen such a big setup before even securing a director, was surprised. 'Gathering these people at the initial stage means- surely it's a bit difficult with just the power of 'Universal Movies.' Suddenly, Megan remembered a famous producer. The man 'Universal Movies' was putting effort into recruiting. Surely, if the film company was large, it would be easier to gather capable people, but the real key was the overall producer who could exert the most powerful force in film production. In Hollywood, producers have several times more influence than directors. Then. -Swish. Suddenly, a giant appeared in the somewhat busy conference room. It was the giant Joseph Felton, dressed in black from head to toe, who entered leisurely with a few members of his team. As he moved towards the head of the ㅁ-shaped desk, greeting the capable individuals seated there, he also exchanged a simple eye greeting with Megan. Whatever it was. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" With the arrival of Joseph Felton, the dozen or so capable individuals in the conference room fell silent. They just looked at the giant standing at the head of the room. Indeed, the presence of the black Joseph was extraordinary. He was smiling, but the energy he exuded was not easy-going. His size was also enormous. Soon. \\"Um-\\" Joseph, who let out a small cough, looked at everyone and spoke in English. \\"Nice to meet you, I'm Joseph Felton, the overall producer for this film. Some of you I haven't seen in a while, and some I just met a few days ago. Haha.\\" His simple greeting relaxed the slightly stiff atmosphere. A few foreigners waved at Joseph. At this point, Joseph received a tablet from his subordinate, and the quick-witted people in the conference room also operated the tablets in front of them. Then Joseph looked at Megan, who was seated in the middle, and spoke again. \\"First, let me update you on the progress. As you may have heard from me or the film company, the synopsis has entered the treatment phase. I've passed the synopsis to five writers who I believe can write this project well.\\" Suddenly, casting director Megan recalled the synopsis she had seen when she was scouted by the film company. 'The motif is Jekyll and Hyde. It includes a setting of dissociative identity disorder, certainly not easy to unravel.' The film production systems in Korea and Hollywood have similarities, but they also show completely different aspects. First, the film company creates the basic concept or synopsis of the film. Then they hire a producer, and the hired producer passes the completed synopsis to famous Hollywood screenwriters. Of course, these screenwriters are not confirmed. It's closer to picking the completed screenplay later. Then they contact a film director and form a team. This is the basic base in Hollywood. Naturally, in Hollywood, renowned directors who also serve as producers do exist, but that's really only possible for top-tier directors in Hollywood. Anyway, after briefing for several dozen minutes, Joseph looked at the tablet and smiled. \\"As you all know, this is the most sensitive and time-consuming phase. However, since the investment part has already been resolved, we will pick up speed as soon as the screenplay comes out.\\" Having finished speaking, Joseph turned his gaze to the casting team. That is, Megan. \\"You've already seen the synopsis, so please start creating a list of decent actors for the casting team. Contact me whenever necessary.\\" Megan, who had brushed her brown hair, nodded. \\"Yes, let's do that.\\" The meeting continued for about two hours. There was some casual chatter, but serious discussions related to film production also took place. After the meeting ended, the capable individuals who had gathered said their goodbyes and left the spacious conference room. However, the giant Joseph remained at the head of the room. -Swish. Megan approached him. Joseph, who was talking to his team members, turned his head at the sound. \\"Megan, I'm counting on you for this film, just like with 'Last Kill 3'.\\" \\"Me too.\\" Megan replied briefly and glanced at Joseph's team members. Joseph was a quick-witted man. He turned to his team. \\"Go ahead and leave first.\\" Soon, only Joseph and Megan were left in the conference room. Megan was the first to break the ice. \\"Was it you who recommended me for this film?\\" \\"Hmm? Well, I don't know.\\" \\"'Universal Movies' and I don't have that deep of a connection.\\" \\"What's important is ability. I highly value your ability, Megan.\\" Megan looked up at the smiling Joseph and let out a small cough. \\"Cough, thank you.\\" \\"Please take care of the actor lineup. Start gathering them now. Regardless of the role, just list them in order of good form.\\" Megan hesitated for a moment, then exhaled softly and spoke. \\"To be honest, when I saw this synopsis, I thought of Woojin Kang. Especially the part about dissociative identity disorder. Woojin Kang, he freely...\\" \\"I know.\\" Joseph interrupted Megan's words and crossed his arms. \\"It's not just you who's interested in him. I've been looking for a project that would suit him well.\\" \\"......What do you mean?\\" Joseph's answer was simple. \\"It means that choosing this project was all intentional.\\" < History (4) > End"},{"instruction":"< 숨통 (3) > DM 프로덕션의 대회의실. ‘이로운 악’의 주요 스탭이 몰린 내부 중, 총괄 책임자인 턱수염 송만우 PD의 입에서 나온 태국 방콕. 당연히 해외 로케이션 관련이었다. “애매하게 가는 것보다는 역시 확실하게 때려 박는 게 좋겠어.” 송만우 PD의 말에 수십 키스탭 중 제작부 실장이 고개를 끄덕였다. “네, 알겠습니다. 바로 라인 PD 쪽에 연락하겠습니다.” 턱수염 송만우 PD 포함 수십 키스탭들이, 보던 태블릿을 내리고 적당한 두께의 종이뭉치를 펼쳤다. ‘이로운 악’의 해외 로케이션 자료가 담긴 종이뭉치였다. 사실, ‘이로운 악’의 해외 로케이션 얘기는 지금 처음 나온 것이 아니었다. 국내의 대형 세트를 구성할 때쯤 진작에 거론이 됐었다. 따라서 종이뭉치에는 방콕을 포함한 5번까지의 여러 안이 존재했고, 촬영에 적합한 장소들이 포함돼 있었다. 당연히 해외 로케이션에 쓰일 씬들도 함유됐다. 그것들을 기반으로 한 제작 회의가 질펀해질 쯤, 탄탄한 근육의 무술 감독이 송만우 PD에게 물었고. “카 체이스(자동차 추격씬)는 죽여 살려?” 턱을 쓸던 송만우 PD가 어렵지 않게 답했다. “해외로케 확정이면 살려야지, 이 부분 중요하니까 라인 PD한테 현지 상황 확실히 점검해두라고 해.” “이거를 살리는 거면 폭발씬도?” “당연히 가야 돼.” “간만에 펑펑 터지겠구만.” “날리려고 했던 총격씬도 포함해서 갈 거니까, 다들 초기에 빼냈던 콘티를 확인해서 잘 준비합시다.” 소품팀, 무술팀, 촬영팀, 장비팀, 특수효과팀 등등등. 수십 키스탭들의 손이 빨라졌고, 이번엔 미술 감독이 송만우 PD에게 물었다. “이러면 대본상 죽였던 주인공 설정이나 연출도 다시 살리는 건데. 대본 수정도 생기는 겁니까?” “수정이 있기야 하겠지만, 초기에 준비했던 부분이라 크게 오래 걸리진 않겠죠. 최 작가님도 이미 자료적인 부분에 착수하셨고. 초반부만 살짝 추가되는 정도니까 잘 좀 신경 써줘요.” 말을 마친 송만우 PD가 무술 감독 쪽에 시선을 돌렸다. “해외 로케에 포함되는 이 전투 기술이 쉽지 않으니까, 예전에 작성했던 액션 콘티 다시 한번 점검해 주고 최대한 빨리 완성시켜서 브리핑해보자고. 우진 씨한테도 넘어가야 하니까.” “오케이, 근데 이 씬들 전부 우진씨가 직접 소화하나?” “글쎄, 조율이 필요한 부분이기도 한데- 우진씨랑 얘기해보고 대역도 생각해 봐야겠지.” 점차 제작 회의가 질펀해진다. 많은 자금이 투입될 ‘이로운 악’이었고, 넷플렉스와 함께 전세계를 노릴 사전 제작 작품이라 당연한 분위기긴 했다. 지금 거론되는 해외 로케이션만 봐도 판이 상당할 정도였으니까. 오고 가는 대화만 들으면 블록버스터급 영화와 비슷한 느낌. 어차피 해외 대중들의 눈을 사로잡는 거라면 파격적인 게 맞다는 송만우 PD의 판단. 물론, 라이브 촬영으로 진행되는 보통의 미니라면 불가능한 그림이었다. 어쨌든 달궈진 제작 회의 사이로 송만우 PD가 주제를 바꿨다. “넷플렉스 주관으로 하는 전체 배우들 인터뷰 촬영, 그거는 해외 로케 관련 사전 답사 들어가기 전에 털어야지 싶은데.” “아무래도 그게 낫죠.” “그럼 우진씨 복귀하는 거 상황 봐서 일정 조율하고 순서는- 전체 배우들 인터뷰 촬영 턴 뒤에, 해외 로케 사전 답사 및 장소헌팅, 전체 무술 점검 포함 세트나 대본 콘티 마무리 짓고. 그 사이에 대본리딩도 들어가는 게 좋겠어.” “크~ 빡빡하네.” 지옥행이 연상되는 미래에 키스탭 몇몇이 작게 한숨을 내쉬었고, 송만우 PD는 제작 실장에게 다시금 강우진 얘기를 꺼냈다. “강우진씨 스케줄이 핵심이니까, 사전에 계속 연락 주고받으면서 최대한 시간을 맞추는 거로.” “예, PD님. 아까도 최성건 대표님이랑 통화했습니다. 우진씨 며칠 쉬는 거 끝난 뒤, LA 쪽 넘어가는 일정만 빼면 조율할 수 있답니다.” “LA?” “그- 있잖습니까? 마일리 카라랑 한다는.” “아아.” 곧, 작게작게 감탄사가 쏟아졌다. “대단하다- 대단해, 그 마일리 카라랑 음반 작업을 하는 배우가 한국에서 나올 줄이야.” “이거 이러다가 우리 작품 런칭되기 전에 강우진씨 월드 스타 되는 거 아닙니까?” “하하하, 그럼 저희야 좋죠. 멘땅에 헤딩 안 해도 되고.” “근데 우진씨 스케줄은 진짜 보통으로 보면 불가능한 건데, 그게 어떻게든 진행되는 거 보면 어이가 없달지.” 동시에 턱수염 송만우 PD가 주제를 바로 잡았다. “여튼, 해외 로케 촬영 진행할 우진씨 포함 배우들한테도 바로 내용 공유해 주고.” 그가 말한 ‘배우들’은 대부분 무명, 신인이었다. 한편, 같은 시각. 진주 쪽. 몇십 분 전 최성건과의 통화를 마친, 텅 빈 집에 홀로 있는 강우진은 방에 누워있는 상태였다. 무릎 나온 추리링과 프린팅 벗겨진 반팔은 그대로였다. 짧은 2박 3일의 휴식이지만 최선을 다해 쉬려는지, 옆으로 누워 핸드폰을 보는 우진의 주변엔 대본 또는 시나리오 따윈 없다. 오로지. “아우- 씨, 진심 노는 게 최고야. 짜릿해.” 원래의 강우진으로서 빈둥대는 것을 최대치로 즐기고 있었다. 물론, 컨셉질이나 쎈척도 없다. 진주 전체는 그의 방문으로 들썩이고 있었으나 강우진 혼자만 유유자적이었다. 그런 강우진은 현재 너튜브 영상을 보고 있었다. 이미 300만 조회수를 넘긴, 얼추 100만에 가까운 구독자를 지닌 한 영화 리뷰 너튜버의 영상. 내용은 타이틀에도 보이듯 강우진 관련이었다. 현 한국영화계의 역사를 뒤집은 ‘실종의 섬’에서 우진의 연기만을 편집해 업로드한 것. 수천 댓글은 당연하겠지만 강우진의 극찬 세례가 폭발한다. “흐흐, 좋군.” 뭐, 중간중간 우진을 욕하거나 까는 댓글도 보였으나 강우진은 사뿐히 무시했다. 그렇게 한참을 자신 위주의 너튜브 영상을 감상하던 우진이 검색사이트를 켰다. 최근 크랭크업한 ‘거머리’가 떠올랐기 때문이었다. “상황이 어떤가-” 이미 단톡방 등에서 실제 진행률 정도는 파악하고 있는 우진이었으나, 언론과 여론의 상태가 궁금했다. 검색어는 ‘거머리’. 결과는 당연하겠지만 빠르게 쏟아졌다. 제일 먼저 보이는 건 기사들. 『[무비톡]후반 작업 돌입한 ‘거머리’, 올해 칸 영화제에서 축포를 터트릴 수 있나?』 ‘실종의 섬’의 초대형 홈런이 있어선지, 칸 영화제가 예정된 ‘거머리’의 기대치도 퍽 높았다. 다만, ‘거머리’는 홍보 활동을 하고 있진 않았다. 어차피 편집이 완료돼도 국내에 바로 개봉하진 않으니까. 아마 ‘거머리’는 무슨 결과가 나든 칸 영화제에 걸린 뒤, 그 힘을 등에 업고 한국의 극장에 개봉될 예정이었다. 날짜로 따지면 아마 올해 연말 이전이 되겠지. 뭐가 됐든. -스윽. 옆으로 누운 채 있던 우진이 보던 핸드폰을 내렸다. 그리곤 배를 긁었다. “출출한데.” 뭐랄까, 허기짐이나 배고픔은 아니었다. 입가심이 필요했다. 과자 같은 거. 이어 방에서 나온 그가 주방 이곳저곳을 뒤졌다. 뭐가 개뿔 없다. 라면 같은 거나 오전에 먹다 남은 닭볶음탕은 있으나 군것질할 건 없다. 시간을 확인하는 강우진. 정오가 되기 직전이다. “······흐음.” 멀뚱히 서서 뭔가를 생각하던 우진이 다시금 방에 들어가 모자와 마스크를 챙겼다. 이유야 간단했다. 아파트 단지 내에 있는 슈퍼가 갈 생각이니까. “옷은- 뭐, 이대로 가는 게 낫겠지. 오히려 덜 눈에 띌 거고.” 그래도 티는 갈아입어야 하나? 무릎 나온 추리링 바지야 무난하지만, 프린팅이 사정없이 벗겨진 반팔은 밖에서 입기 조금 그랬다. 결과적으로 우진은 반팔만 대충 갈아입고 모자와 마스크를 쓴 채 집을 나섰다. 강우진이 엘리베이터를 탔다. 1층까지 몇몇 사람들이 타긴 했지만 우진을 알아보진 못한다. 뭐, 몇몇이 힐끔거리긴 했지만. 아파트를 나온 우진이 슬리퍼를 끌며 걸었다. 슈퍼는 아파트 입구 쪽에 있었다. 하품하는 우진의 옆으로 어려 보이는 여자 두 명이 스친다. “입구에 현수막 봤지?” “응, 대에박! 진짜 강우진 우리 아파트에 있나 봐.” “볼 수 있나??! 아파트 단지 계속 돌래?” “만나면 진심 심장 터질 듯!” 그녀들을 보며 우진은 왜 이 시간에 밖에 있지? 학교 안 가나? 따위의 의미 없는 생각을 했다가 오늘이 토요일임을 인지했다. 그런데 현수막? 생각해보면 아까 최성건의 통화에서도 현수막 어쩌고 했었다. ‘뭔 현수막을 말하는 거지.’ 우진은 슈퍼를 가는 김에 어린 여자들이 봤다던 현수막도 확인하기로 마음먹었고, 그를 스친 어린 여자들은 뒤를 힐끔대며 수군거리기 시작했다. 그렇게 몇 분 뒤 슈퍼가 보이는 아파트 입구에 도착한 강우진은. “······” 위쪽에 걸린 현수막을 확인하자마자 우뚝 멈췄다. ‘미친- 저게 뭐여??!’ 당황과 수치심 비슷한 것이 온몸을 휘감았으니까. 아파트 입구에 걸린 현수막들 때문이었다. -‘진주의 자랑! 괴물 배우 강우진님의 방문을 환영합니다!!’/진주시청. 진주의 자랑, 진주에서 용 났다 등의 멘트가 실린 현수막이 위풍당당 펄럭이고 있다. 심지어 하나도 아닌 여러 개. 대략 ‘강우진을 환영한다’는 느낌의 문구가 박혔는데, 그중 하나의 현수막엔 강우진의 포스터나 얼굴도 인쇄됐다. ‘얼굴! 왜 얼굴까지 삽입했냐고!’ 민망함이 배가 된 우진이 과자 사는 것도 잊은 채 몸을 돌렸다. 대체 저게 무슨 호들갑이지? 이때였다. -우우웅. 무릎 나온 추리링 바지속 우진의 핸드폰이 짧은 진동을 뱉었다. 그의 엄마에게서 온 톡이었다. 내용을 확인한 강우진의 쪽팔림이 수 배로 늘어났다. -오마니: 우진아, 가게 주변에 현수막 엄청 달렸네? 진주 공무원들이 너 온 거 엄청 반가운가 봐. 가게 올 때도 현수막 엄청 많이 봤어. -(사진 첨부파일) 현재 진주 전역엔 강우진의 얼굴이 박힌 현수막이 폭발하고 있었으니까. ‘그만! 그만 달아! 내가 원하질 않는다고!’ 속으로 비명을 지르던 우진에게 여자 목소리가 침투했다. “저기-” 앞을 보니 아까 스쳤던 어린 여자들 두 명이 어물어물 다가오고 있었다. 그중 안경 낀 여자가 우진에게 물었다. “호, 혹시 강우진님 아니세요?” “······” 짧게 침묵하던 우진이 목소리를 냈다. 평소의 근엄한 톤이 아닌 경박에 가까운 가벼운 톤으로. “아닌데요??” “···역시. 아 죄송합니다.” 역시? 뭔 역시? 두 여자가 강우진에게 고개를 꾸벅하며 몸을 돌렸다. 그녀들의 작은 대화 소리가 우진에게 얼핏 들렸다. “그것 봐 아니라니까? 막 엄청 인기 대박 배우가 무릎 나온 추리링을 왜 입고 다녀.” “하긴, 저기 현수막에 걸린 사진이랑 비교하면 좀 많이 추하긴 했어.” “그냥 주민인데 담배나 사러 나온 사람이라니까 백퍼.” “응응. 딴 곳 가보자, 딴 곳.” 점차 멀어지는 소녀들. 이어 약간 멍하니 섰던 강우진이 긴 한숨을 내뱉으며 작게 읊조렸고. “나온 게 실수다.” 빠른 걸음으로 집으로 복귀했다. 돌아오니 텅 비어 있는 집에 인기척이 들렸다. 주방에서 물컵을 쥔 채 나타난 여동생 강현아였다. 아침부터 안 보이던, 흰색 모자를 쓴 그녀는 우진의 모습을 보자마자 두 눈이 커졌다. “미쳤어! 오빠!! 그러고 나갔어?!” “어.” 우다다 달려온 그녀가 우진에게 붙어 어깨를 때려댔고, 강우진은 강현아의 모자를 벗긴 뒤 멀찌감치 떨어트렸다. 긴 갈색 머리가 드러난 강현아는 우진에게 잔소리를 늘어놨다. “아니 오빠! 지금 오빠 진주에서 완전 영웅 취급인데, 그렇게 패잔병처럼 하고 나가면 어째?! 누가 알아봤으면 어쩌려고!” “조용히 해 임마.” “팬클럽 회장한테 그랄래?” “아- 팬클럽 회장님. 그래, 팬클럽 회장님 가서 과자 좀 사와라. 너 먹고 싶은 거도 좀 사고.” 별수롭지 않게 카드를 건네는 오빠에게 강현아가 배시시 웃음을 보였다. “이거로 옷도 좀 사도 되나?” “그 옷이 슈퍼에서도 파는 거면.” “씨!” 용돈으로 강현아의 입을 다물게 한 강우진이 소파에 벌렁 누웠다. 그런 그에게 강현아가 다시 말했다. “오빠, 그러고 있으니까 강우진 같지 않아.” “미쳤나.” “내일 기부 행사 있는데 오빠 올 수 있어? ‘강심장’도 기부하는 거라 나는 참석하는데.” “너 그런 것도 하냐?” “내일 기사도 뜰 거거든! 나만 가는 게 아니라 여기 결식아동 센터 관련 사람들 엄청 온대. 진주 시장도 올지 모르고.” 뜻이야 좋다만 본인이 참석하기에 애매하다 생각한 우진이 고개를 저었다. “못갈 듯.” 같은 날, 밤. 장소는 아파트 형태의 작업실. 아니, 정확하게는 ‘이로운 악’을 쓴 최나나 작가의 작업실이었다. 늦은 밤이기도 했고 이미 완결편을 썼기에, 거실 중앙에 모인 책상엔 보조 작가들은 보이지 않았다. 불도 꺼졌다. 허나 제일 큰 방엔 불빛이 밝다. 그리고. “······” 동그란 안경을 낀, 호리호리한 최나나 작가가 노트북을 뚫어져라 보고 있다. 그 주변엔 숱한 종이들이 널브러졌다. 필시 어떠한 자료일 게 분명했고, 최나나 작가가 응시하고 있는 것은 너튜브 영상이었다. 우람한 남자 외국인 두 명이 격렬한 액션을 보인다. 헤어밴드를 찬 최나나 작가는 같은 영상을 반복해서 재생시켰고. “좋네, 이 영상. 참고가 돼.” 노트북 옆에 놓인 그녀의 메모장 수첩엔 여러 번 동그라미가 쳐진 글자가 눈에 띄었다. -CQC/근거리 종합전투 기술, 시스템 아마 ‘이로운 악’에 사용할 설정 같았다. < 숨통 (3) > 끝","output":"< Breath (3) > In the main conference room of DM Production, among the key staff of 'Beneficial Evil,' the overall manager, bearded producer Song Man-woo, mentioned Bangkok, Thailand. Naturally, it was related to overseas location shooting. \\"It's better to go all out than to do it half-heartedly.\\" At producer Song Man-woo's words, the production department manager among the dozens of key staff nodded. \\"Yes, I understand. I'll contact the line producer right away.\\" Producer Song Man-woo, along with the dozens of key staff, put down their tablets and unfolded a stack of papers of reasonable thickness. It was a bundle of papers containing information on the overseas locations for 'Beneficial Evil.' In fact, the discussion of overseas locations for 'Beneficial Evil' was not new. It had been mentioned around the time when the large domestic sets were being constructed. Therefore, the bundle of papers included several options up to number 5, including Bangkok, and contained suitable shooting locations. Naturally, it also included the scenes to be shot at the overseas locations. As the production meeting became more intense based on these, the martial arts director with solid muscles asked producer Song Man-woo. \\"Is the car chase scene going to be intense?\\" Producer Song Man-woo, stroking his chin, answered without difficulty. \\"If we confirm the overseas location, we have to keep it alive, this part is important, so tell the line producer to check the local situation thoroughly.\\" \\"If we're keeping that scene alive, what about the explosion scene?\\" \\"Of course, we have to include it.\\" \\"It's been a while since we had a big explosion.\\" \\"We're also going to include the gunfight scenes we planned to cut, so everyone, check the storyboards we initially removed and prepare well.\\" The props team, martial arts team, filming team, equipment team, special effects team, and so on. The hands of the dozens of key staff quickened, and now the art director asked producer Song Man-woo. \\"If we're doing this, does it mean we're also reviving the main character's setting and direction that were killed off in the script? Will there be script revisions?\\" \\"There will be revisions, but since it's something we prepared initially, it won't take too long. Writer Choi has already started on the material part. It's just a slight addition to the beginning, so please pay close attention.\\" After finishing his words, producer Song Man-woo turned his gaze to the martial arts director. \\"The combat technique included in the overseas location is not easy, so let's check the action storyboards we wrote before once more and try to complete them as soon as possible for a briefing. It also has to be passed on to Mr. Woojin.\\" \\"Okay, but will Woojin handle all these scenes himself?\\" \\"Well, it's a part that needs adjustment - we'll have to talk to Woojin and consider using a stunt double.\\" The production meeting gradually became more intense. 'Beneficial Evil' was a project with a lot of funds invested, and it was a pre-production work aimed at the whole world together with Netflix, so the atmosphere was naturally intense. Just looking at the overseas locations being discussed, the scale was considerable. The conversations alone gave the impression of a blockbuster movie. Producer Song Man-woo's decision was that if it was to capture the eyes of the international audience, it had to be sensational. Of course, this would have been impossible for a typical live-action mini-series. Anyway, amidst the heated production meeting, producer Song Man-woo changed the subject. \\"As for the interview shooting with all the actors organized by Netflix, I think we should get it done before the preliminary survey related to the overseas location.\\" \\"That would be better.\\" \\"Then, let's adjust the schedule according to Woojin's return, and the order will be - after the interview shooting with all the actors, preliminary survey and location hunting for the overseas location, finishing up the martial arts check including the set and script storyboards. In the meantime, it would be good to have a script reading.\\" \\"Wow, that's tight.\\" A few key staff members sighed softly at the future that reminded them of a journey to hell, and producer Song Man-woo brought up Woojin Kang again to the production manager. \\"Woojin's schedule is key, so keep in touch in advance and try to match the timing as much as possible.\\" \\"Yes, producer. I just spoke with CEO Choi Seong-geon. After Woojin takes a few days off, we can adjust the schedule except for the trip to LA.\\" \\"LA?\\" \\"Yeah - you know, the one with Miley Cara.\\" \\"Ah.\\" Soft exclamations poured out. \\"Amazing - it's amazing that an actor who works on an album with Miley Cara comes from Korea.\\" \\"At this rate, won't Woojin Kang become a world star before our work launches?\\" \\"Hahaha, that would be great for us. We wouldn't have to struggle.\\" \\"But Woojin's schedule is really impossible to manage, it's ridiculous how it's somehow proceeding.\\" At the same time, bearded producer Song Man-woo brought the topic back on track. \\"Anyway, share the information about the overseas location shooting with the actors, including Woojin, right away.\\" The 'actors' he mentioned were mostly unknown or newcomers. Meanwhile, at the same time, in Jinju. Woojin Kang, who had just finished a call with Choi Seong-geon a few dozen minutes ago, was lying in his room alone in an empty house. His worn-out sweatpants and a t-shirt with peeling print remained unchanged. Although it was a short 2-night, 3-day rest, there were no scripts or screenplays around Woojin, who was lying on his side looking at his phone, seemingly trying to rest as much as possible. Only. \\"Ah- seriously, nothing beats relaxing. It's thrilling.\\" The original Woojin Kang was enjoying lazing around to the fullest. Of course, there was no pretense or tough act. The whole of Jinju was buzzing with his visit, but Woojin Kang alone was leisurely. Woojin was currently watching a YouTube video. A movie review YouTuber's video that had already surpassed 3 million views and had nearly 1 million subscribers. The content was related to Woojin Kang, as indicated by the title. It was an upload that edited only Woojin's acting from 'The Island of the Missing,' which had turned the history of the current Korean film industry upside down. Thousands of comments were natural, and there was an explosion of high praise for Woojin Kang. \\"Heh, nice.\\" Of course, there were comments cursing or criticizing Woojin in between, but Woojin Kang simply ignored them. After watching YouTube videos centered around himself for a while, Woojin opened a search engine. He was reminded of 'Leech,' which had recently wrapped up. \\"What's the situation like-\\" Woojin, who already had an idea of the actual progress from group chats, was curious about the state of the media and public opinion. He searched for 'Leech.' The results poured out quickly, as expected. The first things to appear were articles. \\"[Movie Talk] 'Leech' enters post-production, can it set off fireworks at this year's Cannes Film Festival?\\" Perhaps due to the grand slam of 'The Island of the Missing,' expectations for 'Leech,' scheduled for the Cannes Film Festival, were quite high. However, 'Leech' was not engaged in promotional activities. After all, even if editing was completed, it wouldn't be released in Korea right away. Regardless of the outcome, 'Leech' was expected to be released in Korean theaters after being featured at the Cannes Film Festival, probably before the end of this year. Whatever the case. -Swish. Woojin, who had been lying on his side, put down his phone and scratched his belly. \\"I'm hungry.\\" It wasn't exactly hunger or an empty stomach. He needed something for his mouth. Like snacks. Then, he got up from his room and rummaged through the kitchen. There was nothing. There were things like ramen or leftover braised chicken from the morning, but no snacks. Woojin checked the time. It was just before noon. \\"......Hmm.\\" Woojin, who had been standing blankly thinking about something, went back into his room and grabbed a hat and mask. The reason was simple. He was thinking of going to the supermarket within the apartment complex. \\"Clothes - well, it's better to go as I am. It'll attract less attention.\\" Should he change his t-shirt, though? The worn-out sweatpants were fine, but the t-shirt with the severely peeled print was a bit too much to wear outside. As a result, Woojin only changed his t-shirt and left the house wearing a hat and mask. Woojin Kang took the elevator. A few people got on down to the first floor, but they didn't recognize Woojin. Well, a few glanced at him. Woojin, who had left the apartment, walked dragging his slippers. The supermarket was near the entrance of the apartment. Two young-looking girls passed by the yawning Woojin. \\"Did you see the banner at the entrance?\\" \\"Yeah, it's huge! It seems like Kang Woojin is really in our apartment.\\" \\"Can we see him?! Shall we keep circling the apartment complex?\\" \\"My heart would burst if we met him!\\" Watching them, Woojin wondered why they were outside at this time. Aren't they going to school? He thought meaninglessly before realizing it was Saturday. But a banner? Come to think of it, Choi Seong-geon also mentioned something about a banner during their call. 'What banner are they talking about?' Woojin decided to check out the banner the young girls had seen on his way to the supermarket, and the young girls who had passed him started whispering to each other, glancing back. A few minutes later, Woojin, who had arrived at the entrance of the apartment where the supermarket was visible, stopped dead in his tracks as soon as he saw the banner hanging above. \\"Crazy - what is that?!\\" A mix of panic and something akin to shame wrapped around his body. It was because of the banners hanging at the entrance of the apartment. -'Jinju's Pride! Welcome to the visit of the monster actor Kang Woojin!!'/Jinju City Hall. Banners with phrases like Jinju's pride and Jinju's dragon were proudly fluttering. And not just one, but several. The banners were emblazoned with phrases like 'welcoming Kang Woojin,' and one of them even had Kang Woojin's poster or face printed on it. 'Face! Why did they even include my face?!' Embarrassed, Woojin turned around, forgetting about buying snacks. What was all the fuss about? It was then. -Woowoo. The phone in the pocket of his worn-out sweatpants vibrated briefly. It was a message from his mother. Woojin's embarrassment multiplied as he checked the content. -Mom: Woojin, there are so many banners around the store? It seems the Jinju officials are really happy you're here. I saw a lot of banners on my way to the store too. -(Attached photo) Currently, banners with Kang Woojin's face were exploding all over Jinju. 'Stop! Stop hanging them! I don't want them!' Woojin was internally screaming when a female voice intruded. \\"Excuse me-\\" In front of him, the two young girls he had passed earlier were approaching hesitantly. One of them, wearing glasses, asked Woojin. \\"Are you, by any chance, Mr. Kang Woojin?\\" \\"......\\" After a brief silence, Woojin spoke in a tone that was not his usual stern one but rather light and frivolous. \\"No, I'm not.\\" \\"···I see. Sorry.\\" What do you mean, 'I see'? The two girls bowed to Woojin and turned around. Their small conversation reached Woojin faintly. \\"See, I told you he wasn't. Why would a super popular actor wear worn-out sweatpants?\\" \\"Yeah, compared to the photo on the banner, he looked pretty shabby.\\" \\"He's just a resident who came out to buy cigarettes or something, one hundred percent.\\" \\"Yeah, yeah. Let's go somewhere else, somewhere else.\\" As the girls moved away, Woojin, who had been standing there a bit dazed, let out a long sigh and muttered softly. \\"Coming out was a mistake.\\" He quickly returned home. As he arrived, there was a sound in the empty house. It was his younger sister, Kang Hyun-ah, who appeared holding a cup of water in the kitchen. She had been out since morning, and when she saw Woojin wearing a white hat, her eyes widened. \\"You're crazy! Brother!! You went out like that?!\\" \\"Yeah.\\" His sister, who ran up to him, clung to him and started hitting his shoulder, and Kang Woojin took off her hat and threw it far away. Kang Hyun-ah, with her long brown hair now exposed, nagged Woojin. \\"Brother! You're a complete hero in Jinju right now, how could you go out looking like a defeated soldier?! What if someone recognized you!\\" \\"Be quiet.\\" \\"You're going to say that to the fan club president?\\" \\"Ah- fan club president. Yeah, fan club president, go buy some snacks. Get something you want to eat too.\\" Kang Hyun-ah smiled broadly as her brother casually handed her a card. \\"Can I buy clothes with this too?\\" \\"If they sell clothes at the supermarket.\\" \\"Ugh!\\" Kang Woojin silenced his sister with his allowance and flopped down on the sofa. Then Kang Hyun-ah spoke to him again. \\"Brother, you don't look like Kang Woojin when you're like that.\\" \\"Are you crazy?\\" \\"Are you coming to the charity event tomorrow? I'm attending because 'Strong Heart' is also donating.\\" \\"Do you do that kind of thing?\\" \\"It's going to be in the news tomorrow! It's not just me going; a lot of people related to the child hunger center here are coming. The mayor of Jinju might come too.\\" It was a good cause, but Woojin thought it was awkward for him to attend and shook his head. \\"I don't think I can go.\\" The same day, night. The place was a studio apartment. Or more precisely, it was the studio of writer Choi Na-na, who wrote 'Beneficial Evil.' It was late at night, and since she had already written the final part, there were no assistant writers around the desk in the center of the living room. The lights were off.

[대한민국 역대 박스오피스] [역대 영화 순위(통합)] -1. 실종의 섬/ 누적관객수: 20,013,889명 우진으로서는 듣도보도 못 한 수치였다. 아니, 그만이 아니라 한국의 모든 이가 그렇겠지. 사실, ‘실종의 섬’이 1900만을 넘겼을 때도 국내는 뒤집혔었다. 이미 예상치를 훌쩍 뛰어넘었기에. 1900만으로도 이를 따라잡는 영화는 나오기 힘들 것. 아니다, 100% 앞으로는 절대 이 수치를 넘길 수 없다. 그런 것이 1900만을 넘겨 2000만을 달성했다. “미친- 소름.” 핸드폰을 눈에 가까이 가져댄 우진은 괜한 닭살이 돋았다. 애초 ‘실종의 섬’ 막판 스코어의 힘이 많이 빠졌기에, 연예계 전체로는 2000만은 불가능하다고 판단하기도 했다. 그러나 그것은 모조리 개소리였다. 섣부른 판단이었다. 뭐가 됐든 강우진은. “천만 배우가 아니라.” 2천만 배우가 됐다. 것도 첫 주연작에서 말이다. 이렇게 되면 ‘실종의 섬’은 한국영화계에 많은 전설을 남김과 동시에, 여러 메시지를 던지는 것과 같았다. 일단, 거장 권기택 감독과 류정민 등의 주연 배우들의 몸값이 수직 상승한다. 물론, 강우진의 핵폭탄급 파급력은 수 배로 늘겠지. 당연히 차후 돈 파티도 있을 것. 거기에 영화계에는 성수기에 어마무시한 스타트를 끊어줌과 동시에, 잘 찍고 잘 만들면 충분히 가능하니 징징거리지 말라는 말을 던졌다. 몇 년 전부터 영화계 전체로 힘들다 힘들다 잡소리가 많았으니까. 그런 영화계는 당연히 강우진을 주목하겠지. 아직 국내는 폭풍전야처럼 조용하지만 몇 시간만 지나면, 비바람이 동반된 태풍이 불어닥칠 게 분명했다. 강우진의 핸드폰에도 축하 연락들이 쏟아질 것은 자명. 이쯤. -스윽. 찐득한 미소를 머금은 강우진은 어깨춤을 발사했다. 무음의 율동이었다. 하지만 리듬에 몸을 맡긴 그의 모습은 흡사 베테랑 댄스 가수였다. 막춤에 가까우나 기세만은 그랬다. ‘2천만!!’ 곧 나가야 하니 이 끓어 넘치는 기분을 억지로 누른 강우진. 그는 핸드폰을 뒷주머니에 쑤신 뒤 기나긴 한숨을 내뱉었다. 고동치는 심장에 찬물을 끼얹어야 했다. 그렇게 꾸역꾸역 컨셉질을 얼굴에 담은 우진이 집을 나섰다. 도착한 곳은 지하주차장. 늘 대기하는 주차 칸에 커다란 밴이 보인다. 특이한 것은. “어이구.” 밴의 주변으로 꽁지머리 최성건은 물론이며 한예정 등의 팀 인원들이 나와 있다는 것. 이어 뒷문을 연 최성건이 차 안을 손짓하며 빙긋 웃었다. “2천만 배우님 입장하십니다.” 다가오는 우진을 보며 격조 있게 읊조린 최성건 뒤로 팀 인원들이 작게 박수를 친다. 다분히 민망한 연출이지만 이들을 즐기고 있었고, 무심한 얼굴인 강우진은 별수롭지 않게 밴에 타긴 했으나 속으로는 경박스레 인사했다. ‘크크, 땡큐. 감사드리옵니다.’ 우진이 타자마자 출발한 밴의 분위기는 클럽을 연상케 했다. 주인공인 강우진만 단단했고 나머진 쉴새 없이 떠들어댔다. “대박! 진짜 대에박!! 아니, 진짜 이게 보고도 못 믿겠어요!!” “못 믿으면 어쩌려고?” “우진 오빠! 기사들 터져요, 터져! 메인 싹다 오빠밖에 없네!” “2000만인데 당연하지!” 반면, 강우진은 적당적당히 대답하면서도 티 안 나게 기사들을 확인하고 있었다. 언론은 마치 기다렸다는 듯이 기사를 갈기고 있었다. 『[공식]‘실종의 섬’ 무려 2000만 관객수 돌파! 대한민국 영화계 판을 몇 배나 넓혔다』 『‘2000만 관객수’ 실종의 섬, 그리고 기적을 만들어낸 강우진/ 사진』 『[무비IS]“이게 가능한 거였어?!” ‘실종의 섬’ 2000만 관객수 돌파에 대중들 들썩!』 ‘실종의 섬’이 역대 1위 영화로 등극했을 때보다 더 뜨겁다. 『역시나 ‘미다스의 손’ 강우진 매직, 한국 역대 1위로 모자라 2000만 관객수 신기록 수립』 국내 여러 포털사이트는 물론이며 커뮤니티를 포함한 인터넷 세상 모든 곳에 전염된다. 『천만도 힘든 시기에 2천만 달성! ‘실종의 섬’ 큰일 해냈다, 2차 유통도 큰 기대 모아』 기사 타이틀이나 내용엔 ‘실종의 섬’과 2000만 관객수 그리고 강우진이 필수로 포함됐다. 당연했다. 사실상 ‘실종의 섬’의 마지막 불꽃을 태운 건 누가 뭐래도 강우진이었으니까. 그의 존재감이, 파급력이 ‘실종의 섬’의 멱살을 잡고 꾸역꾸역 산 등반을 시킨 것. 『[기획]기적과 같은 2000만 관객수 달성한 ‘실종의 섬’, 강우진 등 배우들에게 떨어지는 돈은? 조건에 따라 천차만별』 이어 흐른 시간이 두 시간. 강우진이 밀린 스케줄에 본격적으로 돌입했을 시간 쯤, 대부분의 공중파 아침 뉴스에서는 ‘실종의 섬’의 전설을 보도했다. [“역시 불가능은 없는 모양입니다, 최근 역대 1위 영화로 올라선 ‘실종의 섬’이 대한민국 최초로 2000만 관객수를 오늘 달성했습니다. 영화계 전문가들은 미래에 다시 없을 성적이라 극찬하고 있습니다. 고민주 기잡니다.”] 이 소식은 당연하겠지만 국내 대중들에게도 흥분을 선사했다. ‘실종의 섬’을 봤든 안 봤든 일단 신기하지 않은가? “야야 봤냐? ‘실종의 섬’ 이거 관객수 2000만 넘겼다는데?” “헐- 미친. 진심? 개지리네?” “지금 기사 터지고 난리 났음.” “재밌긴 했는데- 2000만 넘을 줄은 진짜 몰랐다.” “개부럽······돈 존나 벌겠네. 강우진하고 배우들.” ‘실종의 섬’은 수많은 여론의 입에 뻔질나게 오르내렸다. 물론, 연예계도 마찬가지였다. 그중에서도 ‘실종의 섬’을 제작한 어울림 영화사는 축제 분위기였다. “세, 세상에!!! 2000만??!! 진짭니까 이거?!!” 푸근한 권기택 감독이 포함된 십수 명 인원들이 모인 회의실. 이들은 어제쯤 2000만의 기미가 보였기에 오늘 모여 있었고, 오전에 결과가 발표 나자마자 지금까지 세상이 떠나가라 굉음을 내고 있었다. 그것을 차분하게 진정시킨 건 역시나 권기택 감독이었다. “이건- 역시, 우진씨 덕분인 거지. 후반부 홍보에 최근 이슈들까지 힘 받지 않았다면 힘들었을 거야.” “그렇죠! 물론입니다!! 하하하!” 인원들 전부가 격렬하게 인정하는 바였다. 그리고 거장 권기택 감독은 턱을 쓸며 오묘한 미소를 지었다. “외계인, 결국 혼자서 영화 하나를 2000만으로 올려놨군.” 후로. 강우진의 거액 기부, ‘실종의 섬’의 2000만 관객수 달성 등등. 숱한 이슈들이 한국을 펑펑 터트리는 와중 시간이 녹았다. 『‘2000만 관객수 돌파’의 주역 강우진, SNS에 팬들을 향한 감사 인사 “사랑합니다”』 ‘기부왕’, ‘2천만 배우’ 등의 별명이 추가로 생긴 우진이었으나 즐길 시간 따윈 없었다. 꽤 많은 작품의 촬영이 끝났으나 새로운 작품들이 기다리고 있었고, 광고나 화보 또는 너튜브 촬영 등등 일정의 지옥을 넘나들었으니까. -띠띠디! 찰칵! “나아아아이스!! 우진씨! 이번엔 코트 좀 벗고 찍어볼까요??” “예.” 다음날쯤, 우진과 관련해서 두 작품이 장전 중인 일본에서도 그의 이슈는 전달되고 있었다. 『한국에서 기적 이룬「강우진」, 주연작 ‘실종의 섬’이 2000만 관객수 넘겼다』 뭣보다 최근 일본에는 ‘우리네 식탁’이 정식으로 런칭됐다. 당연히 일본 넷플렉스를 통한 것이었고, ‘우리네 식탁’은 일본에 오픈되자마자 1위를 찍었다. 『강우진 ‘김자반 막국수’ 열풍의 프로「우리네 식탁」, 넷플렉스 런칭과 함께 1위 우뚝』 이 무시무시한 기세의 근간엔 강우진이 대들보였다. 또한, 일본을 유행처럼 강타한 ‘김자반 막국수’ 역시 힘을 보탰다. 일본에서의 ‘우리네 식탁’ 히트는 많은 결과를 낳았다. 강우진의 기존 일본 팬들이 더 두터워졌으며 새로운 일본 팬들 역시 증폭됐다. 그 결과. -요리하는 강우진....보고 또봐도 멋있더라.... -아! 김자반 막국수 이거 강우진이 만든 거였어??! -우리네 식탁 너무 재밌어, 일본은 왜 이런 예능을 만들지 못하는 거야?

저 이런 촬영 처음이라.” “맞아요, 완전 심장 터질 거 같아요.” 죄다 무명 또는 신인 배우들이었으니까. 말이 신인이지 촬영 자체가 처음인 배우들이 대부분이었다. 전부 대규모 오디션을 통하거나, 송만우 PD가 연극판 등을 발로 뛰어 선발한 인물들이었다. “그, 근데 오늘 배우들 다 오는 거면 주연님들도 오시는 건가? 강우진 님이라거나. 아니면 저희만 찍나요?” “저도 잘- 근데 저도 아까 궁금해서 여쭤봤는데 강우진님 오신데요.” “······대박. 와- 저 솔직히 우진님은 못 볼 줄 알았거든요. 왜 그런 거 있잖아요, 같은 작품 나가도 주연님들이랑 촬영 못 하면 얼굴도 못 보는.” “맞아요. 그래서 저도 어어엄청 기대 중.” 이때였다. -스윽. 대기 의자로 배우들이 속속 도착하기 시작했다. 흑갈색의 단발에 키가 작은, 올망졸망? 큐티? 러블리? 따위의 느낌이 진한 여자배우. 아니, 임해은. 또는 잘생겼는데 선한 이미지가 돋보이는 남자 배우. 즉, 조무찬. 그리고 다른 무명의 배우들. 다들 모르는 얼굴이었기에 어색한 인사를 나눈다. 그렇게 점차 수십 의자들이 가득 차기 시작했다. 와중에 그나마 말을 튼 배우들의 대화 주제는 당연히 ‘이로운 악’의 탑배우들이었고. “강우진 2000만 찍은 거 진짜 대박이죠?” “우리 것도 초대박 터졌으면 좋겠는데.” “근데 저 강우진님 실물 처음이라······역시 사인받는 건 안 되겠죠?” “아- 저도 근데 괜찮으면 사진 요청은 해볼까 생각했었거든요.” 엄마가 무당인, 뭔가 아까부터 한마디 말없이 앞만 보고 있는 임해은은 표정이 굳은 상태며. “······” 국내 1티어 원로배우 조무찬의 직속 제자이며 강우진이 우상인, 얼굴에 청량함이 그득하면서도 우진과는 대조적 이미지인 조무찬은. ‘우와! 드디어! 드디어 강우진님 보는 건가??! 어쩌지? 그냥 굳어버릴 것 같은데!’ 안절부절못하고 있었다. 뭐, 전체적으로 수십 무명·신인 배우들은 조무찬과 같은 텐션이었다. 초조하거나 엉덩이를 들썩였다. 긴장의 모습이 역력했다. 이 순간, 백여 명 스탭들이 산재한 드넓은 창고 스튜디오에 쩌렁쩌렁 외침이 울렸다. “강우진씨 도착하셨습니다!!!” 순간 스탭들 대부분이 입구 쪽으로 고개를 돌렸다. 열린 입구를 통해 포커페이스가 진한, 흑청재킷의 강우진이 입장하는 중이었다. -스윽. 그리고 수십 무명, 신인 배우들 모두의 시선이 강우진에게 박혔다. 그를 감싼 냄새는 여유가 넘치는 데다 차분했지만 에너지는 뜨겁다. 괴물 강우진의 등장만으로도 현장의 공기가 180도 바뀐다. 백여 명 스탭들이 그에게 시선 고정하거나 뛰어간다. 저것이 남주의 포스인가? 무명, 신인 배우들은 근엄한 강우진을 보며 그저 넋이 나갔다. 반면, 무심함 가득한 강우진은 속으로 읊조리고 있었다. ‘아- 보쌈에 쐬주 땡기네.’ 압도적 출출함이었다. 약간 예민했다. 그것이 무명, 신인 배우들에겐 다른 모양새로 비춰졌다. “······포스 지려.” “와······” “대박.” “······아우라 미쳤네.” 압도적인 존재감이었다. < 컴백 (2) > 끝","output":"< Comeback (2) > Standing at the shoe cabinet, Woojin Kang looked down at the new record displayed on his phone and was unable to react with any kind of dance or celebration. He was frozen in time, and it was quite understandable. As of today, the movie 'The Island of the Missing' had surpassed the number one movie in South Korea's history and left a new legend. 20 million viewers. [South Korea's All-Time Box Office] [All-Time Movie Rankings (Integrated)] -1. The Island of the Missing / Cumulative Audience: 20,013,889 For Woojin, this was an unheard-of figure. In fact, it would be the same for everyone in Korea. Indeed, when 'The Island of the Missing' surpassed 19 million, the country was already turned upside down. It had far exceeded expectations. Even with 19 million, it would be difficult for any movie to catch up. No, it was 100% certain that this figure would never be surpassed in the future. Yet, it had surpassed 19 million and reached 20 million. \\"Crazy - goosebumps.\\" Woojin brought his phone close to his eyes, feeling an unnecessary chill. Initially, as the final score of 'The Island of the Missing' had significantly dropped, the entire entertainment industry had judged that reaching 20 million was impossible. However, that was all nonsense. It was a premature judgment. Regardless, Woojin Kang was now. \\"Not just a ten million actor.\\" He had become a twenty million actor. And that too, with his first leading role. With this, 'The Island of the Missing' left many legends in the Korean film industry and sent various messages. For starters, the value of veteran director Kwon Ki-taek and lead actors like Ryu Jung-min skyrocketed. Of course, the impact of Kang Woojin, akin to a nuclear bomb, would increase several times over. Naturally, there would be a money party to follow. Moreover, the film industry was given a massive start in the peak season, along with the message that if you film well and produce well, it's entirely possible, so stop whining. There had been a lot of complaints about the film industry being tough for several years. The film industry would certainly focus on Kang Woojin. Although it was still quiet like the calm before the storm in Korea, it was certain that a typhoon with heavy winds would blow in just a few hours. It was obvious that Woojin's phone would be flooded with congratulatory messages. At this point. -Swish. Woojin, with a sticky smile, launched into a shoulder dance. It was a silent rhythm. But his movements, entrusted to the beat, were like those of a veteran dance singer. It was close to freestyle dancing, but the energy was there. \\"Twenty million!!\\" Woojin Kang, who had to leave soon, forcibly suppressed his overflowing emotions. He shoved his phone into his back pocket and let out a long sigh. He had to pour cold water on his pounding heart. Thus, Woojin, with a forced concept plastered on his face, left the house. He arrived at the underground parking lot. A large van was waiting in the usual parking spot. What was unusual was. \\"Oh my.\\" Around the van, not only the ponytailed Choi Seong-geon but also Han Ye-jung and other team members were present. Then, Choi Seong-geon, who opened the back door, gestured inside the car with a grin. \\"Enter, the twenty million actor.\\" As Woojin approached, Choi Seong-geon recited with dignity, and the team members behind him clapped softly. It was an embarrassing production, but they were enjoying it, and Woojin, with an indifferent face, got into the van without much fuss, but inwardly he greeted them frivolously. \\"Heh, thank you. I am grateful.\\" As soon as Woojin got in, the atmosphere in the van was reminiscent of a club. Only the protagonist, Kang Woojin, was solid, while the rest chattered non-stop. \\"Amazing! Really amazing!! I can't believe it even after seeing it!!\\" \\"What can you do if you don't believe it?\\" \\"Woojin oppa! The articles are exploding, exploding! It's all about you on the main page!\\" \\"It's 20 million, of course!\\" Meanwhile, Woojin was appropriately responding while discreetly checking the articles. The media was tearing into the news as if they had been waiting for it. \\"[Official] 'The Island of the Missing' breaks through 20 million viewers! It has expanded the Korean film industry several times over.\\" \\"'20 million viewers' The Island of the Missing, and the miracle-maker Kang Woojin / Photo\\" \\"[MovieIS] \\"Was this even possible?!\\" Public buzzes as 'The Island of the Missing' breaks through 20 million viewers.\\" 'The Island of the Missing' was hotter than when it became the number one movie of all time. \\"As expected, 'Midas touch' Kang Woojin's magic, not satisfied with being Korea's number one, sets a new record of 20 million viewers.\\" Not only on various Korean portal sites but also on the internet world, including communities, the news spread. \\"In times when even ten million is tough, 20 million achieved! 'The Island of the Missing' has done a great job, high expectations for secondary distribution.\\" Titles and contents of articles necessarily included 'The Island of the Missing,' 20 million viewers, and Kang Woojin. It was natural. After all, it was Kang Woojin who had fueled the last flame of 'The Island of the Missing.' His presence and impact had dragged 'The Island of the Missing' up the mountain. \\"[Feature] 'The Island of the Missing,' which achieved the miracle of 20 million viewers, how much money falls to the actors like Kang Woojin? It varies greatly depending on the conditions.\\" Two hours later. Around the time when Woojin Kang was fully diving into his backlog of schedules, most of the morning news on public broadcasting reported the legend of 'The Island of the Missing.' [\\"Indeed, nothing is impossible, as 'The Island of the Missing,' which recently rose to the number one movie of all time, achieved 20 million viewers in South Korea today.

Whether they had seen 'The Island of the Missing' or not, wasn't it simply amazing? \\"Hey, did you see? 'The Island of the Missing' surpassed 20 million viewers?\\" \\"Wow - crazy. Seriously? That's insane.\\" \\"The news is blowing up right now.\\" \\"It was fun, but I really didn't know it would surpass 20 million.\\" \\"So jealous... they must be making a ton of money. Kang Woojin and the actors.\\" 'The Island of the Missing' was incessantly on the lips of countless public opinions. Of course, the entertainment industry was no different. Among them, Oullim Films, which produced 'The Island of the Missing,' was in a festive mood. \\"My, my goodness!!! 20 million??!! Is this for real?!!\\" In a conference room filled with about a dozen people, including the amiable director Kwon Ki-taek, they had gathered today because they had seen signs of reaching 20 million since yesterday, and they had been making a racket since the results were announced this morning. It was director Kwon Ki-taek who calmly settled them down. \\"This is - of course, thanks to Woojin. It would have been tough without the recent issues and the boost from the final promotion.\\" \\"Of course! Absolutely!! Hahaha!\\" Everyone vehemently agreed. And the master director Kwon Ki-taek stroked his chin and smiled mysteriously. \\"An alien, in the end, has single-handedly raised a movie to 20 million.\\" Later. Kang Woojin's large donations, the achievement of 20 million viewers for 'The Island of the Missing,' and so on. Numerous issues were exploding in Korea as time melted away. \\"'20 million viewers' hero Kang Woojin, thanks fans on SNS 'I love you'\\" With new nicknames like 'Donation King' and 'Twenty Million Actor,' Woojin had no time to enjoy them. Although he had finished shooting quite a few works, new projects were waiting for him, and he was busy with advertisements, photoshoots, YouTube filming, and so on, traversing the hell of schedules. -Beep-beep-click! \\"Nice!! Woojin, how about we take off the coat for the next shot??\\" \\"Yes.\\" The next day or so, even in Japan, where two related works were being prepared, the news about Woojin was being delivered. \\"「Kang Woojin」, who made a miracle in Korea, his starring work 'The Island of the Missing' surpassed 20 million viewers.\\" Especially since 'Our Dining Table' had recently launched officially in Japan. Naturally, it was through Netflix Japan, and 'Our Dining Table' hit number one as soon as it opened in Japan. \\"Kang Woojin's 'Seaweed Buckwheat Noodles' craze, 'Our Dining Table' shoots to number one with Netflix launch.\\" At the core of this formidable momentum was Kang Woojin. Additionally, the 'Seaweed Buckwheat Noodles' craze that hit Japan like a trend also contributed. The hit of 'Our Dining Table' in Japan brought many results. Kang Woojin's existing Japanese fans grew thicker, and new Japanese fans also amplified. As a result. -Cooking Kang Woojin... no matter how many times I watch, he's cool... -Ah! Was 'Seaweed Buckwheat Noodles' made by Kang Woojin??! -'Our Dining Table' is so fun, why can't Japan make such variety shows? -Because Japan doesn't have Kang Woojin -I was just going to watch a bit and go to sleep, but I ended up watching 'Our Dining Table' all night... I'm tired... -wwwww The scene where Kang Woojin is mistaken for a chef is too cute!! -He was mistaken for a monster chef right away!!! -Wasn't Kang Woojin an actor? Why is he also good at cooking? · · · · With Kang Woojin's recognition exploding even further, the momentum naturally continued to the two works. 'Nam-sa-chin: Remake' and 'Face Parasite,' scheduled to air officially within July, were ranked high on Japan's famous SNS tags for several days. Then, on July 2nd, the start of the month, in Korea. \\"Done! It's all done!!\\" Writer Choi Na-na, who had been holed up in the studio, suddenly raised both hands and exclaimed. The additional scene work for the 'Beneficial Evil' script had just finished. Upon receiving the news, producer Song Man-woo visited writer Choi Na-na's studio around lunchtime. -Flap, flap. There was no need to read the entire scripts for episodes 1 and 2. Only the additional scenes needed to be checked. Therefore, it didn't take long for bearded producer Song Man-woo to finish reading. -Thump! After reading all of writer Choi Na-na's triumphant additional scenes, producer Song Man-woo's gaze lifted. Writer Choi Na-na, wearing round glasses, swallowed nervously. \\"Is, is it okay?\\" Producer Song Man-woo, without giving a direct answer. \\"......\\" Smiled deeply. And later that afternoon, while Woojin was in the recording studio for the reserved video shooting for the 'Kang Woojin Sub-character' channel, a call came in. Or more precisely, the phone of Choi Seong-geon, who was watching Woojin, rang. \\"Yes, yes. Ah- I understand, producer.\\" The caller was producer Song Man-woo, and after the call, Choi Seong-geon wrote something in his diary. As Woojin, who had a break scheduled, came out of the recording booth, Choi Seong-geon approached him. \\"Woojin.\\" Woojin, who had no disarray in his concept even after a long recording. \\"Yes, CEO.\\" Choi Seong-geon conveyed the content of the call to him. \\"The character shooting for 'Beneficial Evil' is confirmed. Producer Song will probably go location hunting for the overseas shoot after this.\\" It was the first time all the actors of 'Beneficial Evil' would gather together. Saturday, July 3rd, morning. At a large set shooting location in Ilsan. It felt like a studio complex with several warehouse-like storage centers, and each warehouse or studio was enormous. They were roughly larger than a school auditorium. Among them, one shooting team had settled in Studio 1. \\"Let's turn on the ceiling lights!!\\" \\"That middle light seems a bit weak??!\\" \\"I'll check it right away!\\" \\"Where are the spare waiting chairs??!\\" \\"They're outside! How many do you need??\\" \\"For now, bring them all!\\" Approximately a hundred staff members were busy preparing for the shoot. Some were handling props, some were clinging to the lights, some were busy setting up cameras, and some were checking audio equipment. Besides these, everyone was deeply engrossed in their respective tasks. The interior of the warehouse studio was simple. Several lights hung from the high ceiling, and half of the space was covered with white cloth on the floor and walls. The other half remained as the original studio. That side was populated by about a hundred staff members. Most were familiar faces. Staff from 'Beneficial Evil' and Netflix. It was only natural. Today, the first promotional shoot for 'Beneficial Evil' was taking place in this warehouse studio. It was a character shoot. Specifically, it had a strong character introduction nature. An eventful shoot for early promotion. In other words, many actors from 'Beneficial Evil' were participating today. Not everyone was there, of course. Only the main actors who run through the entire series and those who would participate in the first episode. Those actors could be found on temporary chairs set up on one side of the vast warehouse studio. Although it wasn't fully packed yet since there was still some time left, about a dozen male and female actors were sitting among the dozens of chairs. All the faces were unfamiliar. \\"Uh- hello.\\" \\"......Yes, hello.\\" \\"It's awkward just sitting here.\\" \\"Me too.\\" \\"Are you nervous? It's my first time doing this kind of shoot.\\" \\"Yeah, my heart feels like it's going to burst.\\" They were mostly unknown or new actors. New actors, but most of them were experiencing a shoot for the first time. They were all selected through large-scale auditions or personally scouted by producer Song Man-woo from the theater scene. \\"But, if all the actors are coming today, does that mean the lead actors are coming too? Like Kang Woojin? Or is it just us shooting?\\" \\"I'm not sure - but I was curious earlier and asked, and they said Kang Woojin is coming.\\" \\"......Amazing. Wow- I honestly thought I wouldn't see Woojin. You know how it is, even if you're in the same work, if you don't shoot with the lead actors, you don't even get to see their faces.\\" \\"Right. That's why I'm really looking forward to it.\\" It was then. -Swish. Actors began to arrive at the waiting chairs. A short, cute-looking actress with dark brown hair, or rather, Im Hae-eun. Or a handsome actor with a kind image, namely, Jo Moo-chan. And other unknown actors. Since they were all strangers, they exchanged awkward greetings. Gradually, the dozens of chairs began to fill up. In the meantime, the topic of conversation among the few actors who had started talking was naturally the top actors of 'Beneficial Evil.' \\"Isn't it amazing that Kang Woojin hit 20 million?\\" \\"I wish ours would be a huge hit too.\\" \\"But I've never seen Kang Woojin in person... I guess it's not okay to ask for an autograph, right?\\" \\"Ah- I was thinking of asking for a photo if it's okay.\\" Im Hae-eun, who had been staring ahead without saying a word since earlier, had a stern expression. She was the daughter of a shaman. \\"......\\" Jo Moo-chan, a direct disciple of a top-tier veteran actor and an admirer of Kang Woojin, had a refreshing face but an image contrasting with Woojin. \\"Wow! Finally! Am I going to see Kang Woojin?! What should I do? I feel like I'm going to freeze!\\" He was restless. Well, overall, the dozens of unknown and new actors were in the same tense state as Jo Moo-chan. They were anxious or fidgeting. The signs of nervousness were evident. At this moment, a resounding shout echoed through the vast warehouse studio scattered with a hundred staff members. \\"Kang Woojin has arrived!!!\\" Most of the staff turned their heads toward the entrance. Through the open entrance, Kang Woojin, with a poker face and wearing a black denim jacket, was entering. -Swish. And all the dozens of unknown and new actors' eyes were fixed on Kang Woojin. The aura surrounding him was full of ease and calm, yet his energy was hot. The arrival of the monster Kang Woojin alone changed the air of the set by 180 degrees. The hundred staff members either fixed their gaze on him or rushed over. Is this the presence of a male lead? The unknown and new actors were simply mesmerized by the stern Kang Woojin. Meanwhile, the indifferent Kang Woojin was muttering to himself. \\"Ah- I'm craving bossam with soju.\\" He was overwhelmingly hungry. Slightly irritable. To the unknown and new actors, it appeared in a different light. \\"......The presence is insane.\\" \\"Wow...\\" \\"Amazing.\\" \\"......His aura is crazy.\\" It was an overwhelming presence. < Comeback (2) > End"},{"instruction":"< 가을 (2) > 점심쯤. ‘이로운 악’ 쪽이 섭외한 헐리웃의 스턴트 코디네이터 팀이 한국에 발을 들였을 무렵, 삼성동 코엑스엔 왜인지 어마무시한 인파가 몰려 있었다. 원래도 심하게 북적거리는 곳이었지만 현재는 몇 배로 극심했다. 지나치는 사람들이 혀를 내두를 정도. “헐- 여기 뭐야? 사람 개많아!” “대박! 기자들 자리 잡은 거 봐! 누구 연예인 오나??!” 1층 로비에 쳐진 줄 펜스 주변으로 수백 사람들이 엉겨 붙었고, 그 앞으로는 대포 같은 카메라를 설치한 수십 기자들이 진을 쳤다. 1층만이 아니었다. 계단을 따라 이어지는 2층과 3층 모두에 사람이 꽉 찼다. 그것을 통제하는 것은 덩치 좋은 가드들이었고, 그 사이 목에 스탭 목걸이를 찬 인원들이 정신없이 뛰어다닌다. 몰린 인파는 전부 다 마치 짠 듯이 핸드폰을 들고 있었고, 그들의 핸드폰이 향하는 곳은 수십 기자들의 대포 카메라의 앵글이 잡힌 곳이었다. 설치된 단상, 그 위에 배치된 의자와 책상. 뒤로는 현재 대한민국을 요동치게 만드는 배우의 대형 포스터가 걸렸다. 강우진이었다. 당연했다, 이 자리는 우진이 메인 모델을 맡은 한 명품 브랜드 주체하에 열리는 팬 사인회였으니까. 따라서 강우진의 포스터 주변으로는 명품 브랜드의 로고도 곳곳에 박혔다. 즉, 이 무시무시한 인파 모두는 강우진을 목이 빠져라 기다리고 있는 것. 진작에 기사는 터지고 있었다. 하지만 주인공인 강우진의 자리는 비어있는 상태였다. 그렇다면 그는 현재 어디에 있는가? 우진은 사인회가 열릴 로비에서 조금 떨어진, 오늘 행사를 위해 따로 마련된 대기실에서 찾을 수 있었다. “흠-” 대기실 밖은 그의 팀들이 바삐 움직이느라 시끄러웠지만, 정작 우진이 혼자 쓰는 대기실은 나름 고요했다. 강우진은 소파에 다리 꼰 채 앉아 있었다. 멋은 최대치. 흑발을 자연스레 뒤로 넘겼고, 의상은 위아래 블레이저와 슬랙스로 맞췄다. 색상은 짙은 갈색. 이미 준비는 만만이었다. 그런 우진은 왜인지 무선 이어폰을 낀 채 눈을 감고 있었다. 턱까지 괬다. 짬이 나서 잠을 자는 건 아니었다. -♬♪ 노래를 듣고 있었다. 심지어 한국 곡도 아니었다. 외국 노래였다. 이유야 간단했다, 지금 우진이 듣고 있는 곡은 마일리 카라가 보내준 곡이었으니까. 정식 발매 음원은 아니었고 이번 새 앨범 작업을 위한 가이드 곡이었다. 우진으로서는 이 곡을 숙달하고 넘어가야 작업이 가능했기에. 물론, 최근 카라 쪽에서 새 앨범에 관한 정보 이것저것을 보내왔다. 우진이 작업에 참여할 곡은 타이틀이 될 가능성이 높다고 했다. 더불어 곡의 컨셉이나 뮤비의 콘티 등도 넘어왔다. 따라서 우진은 짬이나면 대본과 함께 이렇게 곡을 자주 들었다. ‘노래가- 가이드 판인데도 좋냐.’ 카라가 보내온 곡에 강우진의 참여도는 중간 정도였다. 피쳐링에 가깝지만, 도중에 우진의 피아노 독주도 포함이었다. 이 정도면 상당한 지분이라고 할 수 있다. 이 내용을 들었을 때 그는 겉으로야 묵직하게 행동했지만, 속으로는 극심하게 의아했었다. 대체 왜? 왜 그 글로벌 슈퍼스타 카라가 이런 결정을 내렸지? 하지만 강우진은 금세 대수롭지 않게 생각하게 됐다. 뭐, 어떻게든 되겠지. 하지만 이미 하기로 한거 대충하는 건 컨셉질에 맞지 않았다. 원래의 강우진도 그런 성격이었고. 뭐가 됐든. ‘근데 새삼 지리긴 하네.’ 우진은 재차 가이드 곡을 재생시키면서도 저도 모르게 웃었다. 당연히 속으로. ‘내가 왜 세계적 울트라급 슈퍼스타의 새 앨범 가이드곡을 듣고 있냐? 심지어 참여도 할 판이고.’ 어찌보면 어처구니없는 장면이 아닐 수 없었다. 헐리웃에서도 파급력 터지는 마일리 카라와의 작업이라니. 아마 이 순간 그녀의 새 앨범 곡을 듣고 있는 건, 마일리 카라의 팀들 빼면 지구 통틀어 강우진이 처음일 거였다. “인생 진짜 한 치 앞이 예상이 안 되는구만.” 작게 고개를 젓던 우진이 곡을 들으면서도 손을 움직였다. 앞의 탁자 위 올려진 태블릿을 집은 것. 화면을 두 번 터치하자, 아까까지 그가 보던 것들이 출력되기 시작했다. 카라 쪽에서 보내온 뮤직비디오 콘티였다. ‘컨셉도 겁내 특이해, 실연당해 반쯤 미친 여자.’ 뮤비 컨셉은 곡의 분위기와 직결됐다. 실연, 집착. 거기다 의상 자체는 보란 듯이 섹시였다. 그런데 이제 ‘광기’를 곁들인. 이때. -덜컥. 대기실 문이 열리며 파란 단발의 한예정이 들어왔다. 그녀가 다리 꼰 우진을 보며 특유의 퉁명스런 목소리를 냈다. “오빠, 5분 뒤 나가시면 돼요.” “알았어.” 금세 무심한 얼굴로 변한 강우진에서 태블릿으로 시선이 내려간 한예정이 물었다. “아- 그 마일리 카라 쪽 뮤비 컨셉 보고 계셨네요.” “응.” “저도 그거 의상 준비 때문에 먼저 봤었는데요. 오빠, 진짜 괜찮아요?” “뭐가.” “뮤비가 좀 찐하던데. 오빠한테 요구하는 것도 생각보다 많고요. 피아노 독주야 짧으니까 그렇다 치지만, 스토리상 오빠가 카라의 집착 대상이던데.” 그게 핵심인데 무슨 소리지? 실제로 뮤비 콘티에 삽입된 카라의 연기는 처음부터 끝까지 집착이 동반된 ‘구애’였다. 다만, 안무가 좀 찐했다. 섹시한 의상의 카라나 댄서들이 주가 되지만, 강우진이 투입되고부터는 그녀들의 구애가 시작된다. 카라와 밀착되며 스킨십도 많다. 도중에 입술이 닿을락 말락하는 컷도 포함돼 있었다. 확정이 아니라서 삭제될지는 모르지만 현재로선 그랬다. 당연히 우진이 안무를 추거나 동선이 있지는 않았고, 카라 쪽에선 문제가 되거나 어렵다면 뮤비 콘티의 수정도 할 의향이 있다는 말이 전달됐다. 강우진의 대답은 OK였다. 진심이 그랬다. 그저 연기일 뿐이다. 허나 이런 생각도 있었다. ‘아니, 살면서 언제 그 글로벌 슈퍼스타인 마일리 카라에게 구애를 받아 보겠냐고.’ 전세계의 남자들의 로망이 아닐까? 그러나 이걸 그대로 표현하는 건 병신이었다. 우진은 한예정에게 최대한 낮게 답했다. 냉엄하고 냉철하게. “상관없어, 연기니까.” 그러자 한예정이 약간 질린다는 얼굴로 고개를 저었고. “후, 그래도 상대가 그 마일리 카란데 오빠한테는 그냥 일이네요. 신기해, 어찌 그리 한치에 흔들림이 없어요?” 진심을 숨긴 강우진이 미약한 착각에 당당히 맞섰다. “일은 일이니까.” 뒤로. 대기실에 있던 강우진이 코엑스 내부의 팬 사인회 현장에 모습을 드러냈다. 동시에 굉음과 같은 비명과 함께, 줄 펜스 앞으로 진을 친 수십 기자들의 대포 같은 카메라에서 미친 듯 플래시 세례가 터졌다. -파바바바박! -파바바바바박!! 반면, 컨셉질이 짙은 강우진은. “······” 이미 이런 광경이 꽤 익숙했기에 의연하게 움직였다. 수십 기자들을 향해 적당히 손을 흔들고 모인 수백 팬들에게도 인사를 보냈다. 싹 다 핸드폰을 들고 있는지라 사람이 아닌 핸드폰에 인사를 하는 모습처럼도 보였다. 모인 인파는 초반보다 두 배는 늘었다. 덩치 좋은 가드들이 통제가 버거울 지경이었다. 그렇게 시작된 팬 사인회. 한 명 한 명 대화하며 사인해주는 과정은 대략 2시간이 약속이었지만, 워낙 몰린 팬들이 많은 관계로 우진은 30분 정도를 더 써야 했다. 가까스로 정리된 팬 사인회를 마친 우진이 밴에 올랐을 때, 조수석에 앉은 최성건이. “고생했다, 우진아.” 꽁지머리를 풀었다 다시 묶으면서도 입을 열었다. “간단하게 인터뷰 몇 개 따고 오후에 ‘이로운 악’ 액션 스쿨 넘어갈 거다. 그 해외 무술팀은 이미 합류했다네?” “예, 대표님.” 답한 우진에게 최성건이 확정된 일정 하나를 브리핑했다. “그리고 마일리 카라 관련해서 LA 넘어가는 건 9일 아침 비행기다.” 오늘로부터 대략 5일 뒤였다. 한편, 서울 쪽의 커다란 액션스쿨. 바닥이 온통 회색 매트인, 천장에 달린 와이어나 각종 무술 소품이 즐비한 액션 스쿨. 물론, ‘이로운 악’의 무술팀의 메인 무대였고 수십 무술팀은 당연하며, 턱수염 송만우 PD를 포함한 ‘이로운 악’의 스탭도 꽤 보였다. 공간의 섹션마다 무술팀 인원들이 모두 분주했다. 재밌는 것은 무술팀 사이로 숨을 헐떡이는 배우들이 끼어있다는 것. ‘이로운 악’에 캐스팅된 무명·신인 배우들이었다. 많은 배우 중 무술이 필요한 배우들은 진작에 연습을 시작한 상태였으니까. 몇몇은 눈에 익은 배우들이었다. 공룡상이며 우진과 ‘우리네 식탁’을 함께한 탑배우 하강수나, 선한 탈이면서도 강우진이 우상인 조무찬이 그랬다. 전부가 땀을 흘려가며 무술 연습에 매진한다. 그 전체를 통솔하는 건 무술 감독이었고, 그 옆엔 턱수염 송만우 PD가 팔짱 낀 채 지켜보는 중이었다. 당연히 테스트 카메라와 메이킹 팀의 촬영도 잊지 않았다. 참고로 송만우 PD는 며칠 뒤 태국 방콕으로 떠날 예정이었다. 확정된 해외 로케 촬영 관련으로 장소 헌팅 증 정돈할 게 많았으니까. 와중. “이야-” 숨을 헐떡이며 생수를 벌컥이는 무술팀 인원 몇몇이, 송만우 PD의 뒤쪽에 모인 외국인 무리를 보며 속닥였다. “확실히 뭔가 포스가 남다르지 않냐?” “그러니까. 솔직히 헐리웃 쪽 무술팀 태어나 처음 본다.” “야야, 헐리웃에선 무술팀이라고 안 하고 스턴트 코디네이터? 뭐 여튼 그렇게 불린대.” “워- 저 남자 덩치 봐. 팔뚝이 내 허벅지만 하냐.” “유전자 자체가 다르니까.” 외국인 무리는 오늘 한국에 들어온, ‘이로운 악’ 측이 섭외한 헐리웃 쪽 스턴트 코디네이터 팀. 5명으로 이루어진 그들은 액션 스쿨 한쪽에 자리를 잡았다. 몇몇은 ‘이로운 악’ 무술팀을 지켜보거나, 몇몇은 서로서로 대화를 해대고 있었다. 통역이 붙어 있긴 했으나, 당장은 송만우 PD나 무술 감독과 소통하고 있지는 않은 듯 보였다. 약간 뭐랄까, 분위기를 살피게 둔다는 느낌? 그래서인지 외국인 무리는 무술팀 전체를 크게 신경 쓰지 않는 듯 여유가 있었다. 반대로 ‘이로운 악’ 무술팀 전체는 그들을 티 나게 신경 썼다. “저 팀이 맡은 헐리웃 영화가 뭐래드라? 엄청 유명한 영화도 있던데.” “크- 근데 어떻게 섭외가 됐지? 돈을 엄청 부었나?” “무게 엄청 잡네. 근데 왜 아무것도 안하냐?” 쉬는 인원이나 무술 연습에 열중하는 인원이나 외국인 무리를 힐끔대기 바빴다. “당장은 적응부터 하라는 거겠지. 그리고 애초에 쟤들은 ‘CQC’ 전문으로 섭외된 거라 우리랑은 상관없어.” “아- 즉, 강우진 전용이다?” “당연하지. 애초 ‘이로운 악’ 자체가 강우진 원맨쇼 드라마라드만.” “강우진이 오긴 오나 보네. 근데 오늘은 적당히 인사만 하고 끝날 분위긴데? 아까 감독님도 그렇게 말하더만.” “첫날부터 뭘 하겠냐.” 도중에 강우진의 얘기도 꽤 나왔다. “와- 그나저나 강우진 이번엔 좀 빡세겠는데? 쟤들 포스 좀 봐라. 헐리웃에서 무술로 날아다니는 애들이 대충할 리는 없고.” “100% 죽어날걸? 나도 ‘CQC’ 들어는 봤어도 자세히는 몰라서 좀 찾아봤는데, 완전 초고급 전투 기술이더만. 절대 몇 달 안에 배울만한 게 아니여.” “어떻게든 자세만 만들라는 거겠지. 어후- 암만 강우진이래도 ‘CQC’ 같은 걸 어떻게 쉽게 배우냐.” 약간 분위기가 부산스러워짐을 느낌 무술 감독이 외쳤다. “집중 안 하냐?!! 뭘 떠들어 대는 거야!” 단숨에 무술팀 인원들 전체가 입을 합 다물었다. 그럼에도 약간 불편했는지 몸이 탄탄한 무술 감독이 혀를 찼다. “쯧, 흐트러지면 다친다고 백번을 말해도.” 바로 옆 팔짱 낀 송만우 PD가 뒤쪽을 엄지로 찍으며 작게 웃었다. “헐리웃 스턴트 팀이 신기한 거겠지, 그래서 저 팀이랑 얘기는 나눠 봤나?” “했지. 통역 통해서 나누는 거라 쉽진 않았지만 서도 나쁘진 않았어.” “느낌이 어때?” “어떻긴, 레벨이 확 높지. 무술 콘티 보자마자 어색한 부분 바로 지적하더만. 확실히 헐리웃 짬이 있어선지 달라.” “달라야지, 저 팀이 얼마짜린데. 여튼 의견 잘 나눠서 무술 콘티 수정할 수 있으면 해. 나는 퀄만 높아진다면 뭐든 하자는 주의니까.” “알지, 무조건 퀄은 격상할 거야. 전문가들 모셨으니까.” 읊조린 무술 감독이 손목시계를 확인했다. “우진씨는 언제 오시나? 저 스턴트 코디네이터 팀 소개받으러 잠깐 들른다며?” 고개 끄덕인 턱수염 송만우 PD가 바로 답했다. “통화 했는데 거의 다 왔다는군.” 몇십 분 뒤. 강우진을 태운 검은색 밴이 액션 스쿨의 외부 주차장에 멈췄다. 자연스레 밴에서 내리는 강우진. 그의 복장은 팬 사인회에서 입었던 블레이저 그대로였다. 당연했다, 애초 전달받기로도 간단한 인사만 하면 된다고 했었으니까. -스윽. 포커페이스를 장착한 우진이 커다란 액션 스쿨을 바라봤다. ‘해외 무술팀이 와 있댔나?’ 딱히 긴장되는 건 없었다. 헐리웃 쪽 스탭이야 몇 번이고 봤었으니까. 이어 최성건이나 우진의 팀이 붙자 강우진의 발이 움직였다. 성큼성큼. 일말의 고민 없이 직진한 그가 액션 스쿨의 문을 열었고, 근방에서 대기하고 있던 ‘이로운 악’ 조연출이 바로 외쳤다. “선배님! 우진씨 오셨습니다!!” 이 외침으로 인해 액션 스쿨에 있는 모든 이의 시선이 강우진에게 박혔다. 배우 중엔 하강수가 작게 웃었고 조무찬의 두 눈동자가 반짝였다. 송만우 PD와 무술 감독이 단박에 우진에게 달려왔다. 입은 송만우 PD가 먼저 열었다. “왔구만, 오전에 팬 사인회는 잘 마무리했어요?” 주변 스탭들에게 인사하던 우진이 낮게 답했다. “예, PD님.” 몸이 탄탄한 무술 감독이 웃으며 끼었다. “이야- 오늘 우진씨 멋이 폭발하는데요? 하하하, 이렇게 꾸민 걸 몇 번 못 봐서 그런가?” 간단히 인사가 오가던 무렵, 턱수염 송만우 PD가 조연출을 불러 뭔가를 지시했다. 곧, 고개 끄덕인 조연출이 후다닥 달렸다. 등장한 강우진을 지긋이 보던 헐리웃 스턴트 코디네이터 팀 쪽이었다. 이내 통역을 대동한 외국인 무리가 다가왔다. 그들의 포스에 강우진의 표정엔 별 변화가 없었다. 외국인들 거대한 건 이미 적응했으니까. ‘역시 개크네, 저럴 줄 알았지.’ 어느새 바로 앞에 붙은 그들 중, 리더로 보이는 코가 큰 외국인 남자가 강우진에게 손을 내밀었다. 당연히 뱉어지는 건 영어. “강우진씨? 반갑습니다, 팀의 리더인 에단 스미스라고 합니다.” 통역 직원이 바로 강우진에게 말을 전하려 했으나, 무심한 얼굴인 우진의 손은 이미 그에게 내밀어지고 있었다. “안녕하세요, 강우진입니다.” 팀 리더라 소개한 코가 큰 에단 스미스가 약간 놀랐다. “듣긴 했는데, 정말 영어를 잘하시네요.” “적당히 할 뿐입니다.” “다행입니다. 의사소통엔 문제가 없겠어요. 작업엔 대화가 가장 중요하니까.” 할 일이 없어진 통역 직원이 두 눈을 끔뻑인다. 그러다 아차 한 그가 송만우 PD 쪽에 붙어 둘의 대화를 통역했고, 고개 끄덕인 송만우 PD가 우진을 가리키며 입을 열었다. “우리 작품의 메인 남주를 맡았고, 오늘도 스케줄이 있는 와중에 짬을 내서 오셨습니다. 오늘은 간단히 인사를 나누고 앞으로의 계획을 주고받는 정도로 하시죠.” 통역 직원을 통해 전달되는 대사. 이에 에단 스미스의 시선이 다시금 강우진에게 붙었다. 블레이저에 슬랙스. 확실히 운동할 차림은 아니었다. 그런데 대뜸 코가 큰 에단이 에두르는 것 없이 우진에게 말했다. “지금 당신의 상태를 확인하고 싶습니다. 사전에 무술 연습 영상은 받았지만, 그것만으로는 판단이 어려워서요. 가능하면 ‘CQC’ 관련으로 짜인 무술 콘티 컷 중 하나를 해보면 좋겠습니다. 어렵습니까?” 이 말을 눈이 약간 커진 통역이 송만우 PD나 무술 감독에게 전했다. 금세 최성건과 무술 감독이 당황했다. 물론, 송만우 PD도 마찬가지였고 그가 손을 흔들며 나섰다. “아, 아니. 그건 사전에 얘기된 것도 아니고. 우진씨는 아직 ‘CQC’ 정식으로 배우지도 않았어요. 뭣보다 이렇게 갑자기 진행되면 우진씨에게 무리가.” 그러나. -스윽. 강우진의 움직임 때문에 송만우 PD의 말이 끊겼다. 우진이 돌연 입은 블레이저를 벗었기 때문이었고, 에단 스미스 포함 이 액션 스쿨의 모든 시선이 그에게 붙었다. 벗은 블레이저를 발치에 대충 던진 우진이 에단 스미스에게 말했다. “당신들은 추가된 우리의 ‘이로운 악’ ‘CQC’ 콘티를 숙지했습니까?” 에단 스미스가 고개를 끄덕였고. “그렇습니다.” 그 포함 덩치 큰 스턴트 팀을 쭉 훑던 강우진이 답했다. 매우 낮은 톤의 영어였다. “해보죠 그럼, 대신 그쪽 팀 분들 전부가 포함되는 컷으로.” 너희 다 덤비란 얘기였다. < 가을 (2) > 끝","output":"< Autumn (2) > Around lunchtime. As the Hollywood stunt coordinator team hired by 'Beneficial Evil' set foot in Korea, for some reason, an enormous crowd had gathered at COEX in Samseong-dong. The place was already bustling, but now it was several times more intense. Passersby were astounded by the sight. \\"Wow - what's going on here? There are so many people!\\" \\"Amazing! Look at the reporters setting up! Is a celebrity coming??\\" Hundreds of people were packed around the fenced-off area in the first-floor lobby, and in front of them, dozens of reporters with large cameras had set up camp. It wasn't just the first floor. The second and third floors, connected by stairs, were also packed with people. Large guards were in charge of controlling the crowd, and staff members with staff lanyards around their necks were running around frantically. The gathered crowd all held up their phones as if on cue, and their phones were aimed at where the reporters' large cameras were focused. The stage that was set up, the chairs and desk placed on it. Behind it hung a large poster of the actor currently shaking up South Korea. It was Kang Woojin. Naturally, this event was a fan signing hosted by a luxury brand for which Woojin was the main model. Therefore, the luxury brand's logo was also prominently displayed around Woojin's poster. In short, this massive crowd was all eagerly waiting for Kang Woojin. Articles had already been exploding about the event. However, the main character, Kang Woojin, was not yet present. So where was he at the moment? Woojin could be found in a waiting room set aside for today's event, a little away from the lobby where the signing would take place. \\"Hmm-\\" While the outside of the waiting room was noisy with his team bustling about, the waiting room itself, which Woojin used alone, was relatively quiet. Woojin sat on the sofa with his legs crossed. His style was at its peak. His black hair was naturally swept back, and his outfit consisted of a blazer and slacks, both in a deep brown color. He was already fully prepared. Yet, for some reason, Woojin was sitting with his eyes closed, wearing wireless earphones. He was deep in thought. He wasn't sleeping during his spare time. -♬♪ He was listening to music. Moreover, it wasn't a Korean song but a foreign one. The reason was simple: the song Woojin was listening to had been sent by Miley Cara. It wasn't an officially released track but a guide song for her new album work. For Woojin, he needed to master this song to proceed with the work. Of course, Cara's team had recently sent various information about the new album. The song Woojin would work on was likely to be the title track. They also sent over the concept of the song and the storyboard for the music video. Therefore, whenever Woojin had a moment, he often listened to the song along with his scripts. \\"The song is good, even though it's just a guide version.\\" Woojin's participation in Cara's song was moderate. It was close to featuring, but it also included a piano solo by Woojin. This was a significant share. When he heard this, he acted stoically on the outside, but inside, he was extremely puzzled. Why? Why did the global superstar Cara make such a decision? However, Woojin soon thought it wasn't a big deal. Somehow, it would work out. But doing things half-heartedly didn't fit his concept. The original Kang Woojin wasn't that kind of person either. Regardless. \\"But it's quite amazing.\\" Woojin played the guide song again and couldn't help but smile inwardly. \\"Why am I listening to a guide song for a new album by a world-class ultra superstar? And I'm even participating in it.\\" It was an absurd scene to consider. Working on a project with Miley Cara, whose influence was exploding in Hollywood. At this moment, he was probably the first person on Earth, aside from Cara's team, to listen to her new album song. \\"Life is really unpredictable.\\" Woojin, who had been shaking his head lightly, moved his hand while listening to the song. He picked up the tablet that was on the table in front of him. After tapping the screen twice, the content he had been viewing began to appear. It was the music video storyboard sent by Cara's team. \\"The concept is quite unique, a woman half-mad from being dumped.\\" The music video concept was directly linked to the atmosphere of the song. Heartbreak, obsession. And the outfits were blatantly sexy. But now, 'madness' was added to the mix. At that moment. -Thud. The door to the waiting room opened, and Han Ye-jung with blue bobbed hair entered. She spoke in her characteristic blunt voice upon seeing Woojin sitting with his legs crossed. \\"Oppa, you can go out in 5 minutes.\\" \\"Got it.\\" Woojin, who had quickly returned to an indifferent expression, was asked by Han Ye-jung, who had looked down at the tablet. \\"Ah- you were looking at the music video concept from Miley Cara's side.\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"I saw it too when I was preparing the outfits. Are you really okay with it, oppa?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"The music video is quite intense. They're asking for more from you than I thought. The piano solo is short, so that's fine, but in the story, you're the object of Cara's obsession.\\" That was the key point. In the music video storyboard, Cara's performance from beginning to end was accompanied by 'courtship' with obsession. However, the choreography was quite intense. While Cara and the dancers were the main focus with their sexy outfits, once Woojin joined in, their courtship began. There was a lot of physical contact with Cara. There was even a cut where their lips almost touched. It wasn't confirmed and might be removed, but that's how it was for now. Naturally, Woojin didn't have to dance or have any specific movements, and Cara's team had conveyed that they were willing to modify the music video storyboard if there were any problems or difficulties. Woojin's answer was OK. He was sincere. It was just acting, after all. But he also had this thought. \\"When in life would I ever be courted by the global superstar Miley Cara?\\" Wasn't it the dream of men all over the world? But expressing this outright would be foolish. Woojin responded to Han Ye-jung as lowly as possible. Sternly and coldly. \\"It doesn't matter, it's just acting.\\" Han Ye-jung shook her head as if she was disgusted. \\"Still, the other party is Miley Cara, but to you, it's just work. It's amazing how you're not shaken in the slightest.\\" Woojin, who hid his true feelings, faced the slight misunderstanding with confidence. \\"Work is work.\\" Later. Woojin, who had been in the waiting room, appeared at the fan signing event inside COEX. Simultaneously, with a roar like a scream, a barrage of flashes exploded from the large cameras of the dozens of reporters lined up in front of the fence. -Papapapapak! -Papapapapapak!! Meanwhile, Kang Woojin, with his concept deeply ingrained. \\"......\\" He moved calmly, already quite accustomed to such scenes. He waved appropriately at the dozens of reporters and also greeted the hundreds of gathered fans. Since everyone was holding up their phones, it looked as if he was greeting the phones rather than the people. The crowd had doubled since the beginning. The large guards were struggling to control them. Thus began the fan signing event. The process of talking and signing for each person was supposed to take about 2 hours, but due to the large number of fans, Woojin had to spend an extra 30 minutes. When Woojin got into the van after barely wrapping up the fan signing, Choi Seong-geon, sitting in the passenger seat, said. \\"You worked hard, Woojin.\\" He untied his ponytail and tied it again while speaking. \\"We'll do a few simple interviews and then head to the 'Beneficial Evil' action school in the afternoon. The foreign martial arts team has already joined, right?\\" \\"Yes, CEO.\\" Choi Seong-geon briefed Woojin on one of the confirmed schedules. \\"And the trip to LA related to Miley Cara is scheduled for the morning flight on the 9th.\\" It was about 5 days from today. Meanwhile, at a large action school in Seoul. An action school filled with gray mats on the floor, wires hanging from the ceiling, and various martial arts props. Of course, it was the main stage for the 'Beneficial Evil' martial arts team, and dozens of martial arts team members were naturally present, as well as 'Beneficial Evil' staff including bearded producer Song Man-woo. Every section of the space was bustling with martial arts team members. Interestingly, actors gasping for breath were interspersed among the martial arts team. They were the unknown and new actors cast in 'Beneficial Evil.' Many actors who needed martial arts had already started practicing. Some were familiar faces. Top actor Ha Gang-su, who had been on 'Our Dining Table' with Woojin, and Jo Moo-chan, who had a kind image but idolized Kang Woojin. All were dedicated to practicing martial arts, sweating profusely. The martial arts director was in charge of overseeing the entire team, and next to him, bearded producer Song Man-woo was watching with his arms crossed. Naturally, they didn't forget to film test shots and making-of videos. By the way, producer Song Man-woo was scheduled to leave for Bangkok, Thailand, in a few days. There was a lot to sort out related to the confirmed overseas location shooting. In the meantime. \\"Wow-\\" A few martial arts team members, gasping and gulping down water, whispered to each other as they looked at the group of foreigners behind producer Song Man-woo. \\"They definitely have a different kind of presence, don't they?\\" \\"Seriously. Honestly, it's my first time seeing a Hollywood martial arts team.\\" \\"Hey, hey, they don't call them martial arts teams in Hollywood, they're stunt coordinators? Anyway, that's what they're called.\\" \\"Wow- look at that guy's size. His arms are as big as my thighs.\\" \\"Their genetics are just different.\\" The group of foreigners was the Hollywood stunt coordinator team hired by 'Beneficial Evil,' which had arrived in Korea today. The five-member team had taken up a spot in one corner of the action school. Some were observing the 'Beneficial Evil' martial arts team, while others were chatting among themselves. There was an interpreter present, but for now, they didn't seem to be communicating with producer Song Man-woo or the martial arts director. Perhaps they were given a chance to get a feel for the atmosphere? As a result, the foreign group seemed relaxed and not too concerned about the entire martial arts team. On the contrary, the entire 'Beneficial Evil' martial arts team was noticeably attentive to them. \\"What Hollywood movie did that team work on? I heard they were involved in some really famous movies.\\" \\"Wow- but how did they get hired? Did they pour a lot of money into it?\\" \\"They're really putting on airs. But why aren't they doing anything?\\" Whether resting or focused on martial arts practice, everyone was busy glancing at the foreign group. \\"They're probably told to get used to it first. And anyway, they were hired specifically for 'CQC,' so it has nothing to do with us.\\" \\"Ah- so it's specifically for Kang Woojin?\\" \\"Of course. After all, 'Beneficial Evil' itself is basically a one-man show drama starring Kang Woojin.\\" \\"Kang Woojin is coming, I guess. But today seems like it'll just be a brief greeting and that's it, right? The director said so earlier.\\" \\"They won't do much on the first day.\\" Kang Woojin's name also came up quite a bit. \\"Wow- Kang Woojin is going to have a tough time this time, right? Look at the presence of those guys. The ones flying around in martial arts in Hollywood won't do things half-heartedly.\\" \\"100% he's going to die, right? I've heard of 'CQC' but I don't know much about it, so I looked it up, and it's a super advanced combat technique. It's definitely not something you can learn in a few months.\\" \\"They'll probably just try to get the posture right. Phew- even if it's Kang Woojin, how can he easily learn something like 'CQC'?\\" Feeling the atmosphere getting a bit rowdy, the martial arts director shouted. \\"Aren't you focusing?!! What are you babbling about!\\" Instantly, all the martial arts team members shut their mouths. But the muscular martial arts director clicked his tongue as if still a bit uncomfortable. \\"Tsk, I've said a hundred times that you'll get hurt if you lose focus.\\" Producer Song Man-woo, who was standing next to him with his arms crossed, pointed behind him with his thumb and smiled slightly. \\"They must be curious about the Hollywood stunt team. Have you talked with that team?\\" \\"Yeah. It wasn't easy because we communicated through an interpreter, but it wasn't bad.\\" \\"How did it feel?\\" \\"How? The level is definitely high. They pointed out awkward parts in the martial arts storyboard right away. They're clearly different with their Hollywood experience.\\" \\"They should be different, considering how much that team costs. Anyway, share opinions well and make changes to the martial arts storyboard if possible. I'm all for doing whatever it takes to raise the quality.\\" \\"I know, we'll definitely elevate the quality. We've brought in experts.\\" The martial arts director checked his wristwatch. \\"When is Woojin coming? He said he'd stop by briefly to meet the stunt coordinator team, right?\\" Producer Song Man-woo, who had nodded, immediately responded. \\"He said he's almost here when I called.\\" A few dozen minutes later. The black van carrying Kang Woojin stopped in the outer parking lot of the action school. Woojin naturally got out of the van. He was still wearing the blazer from the fan signing. Naturally, he had been told he only needed to make a brief greeting according to the information he had received. -Swish. Woojin, with his poker face equipped, looked at the large action school. 'Is the foreign martial arts team here?' He wasn't particularly nervous. He had seen Hollywood staff several times before. Then, as Choi Seong-geon and Woojin's team joined him, Woojin's feet moved. Striding forward. Without a moment's hesitation, he opened the door to the action school, and the assistant director of 'Beneficial Evil,' who was waiting nearby, immediately shouted. \\"Senior! Woojin has arrived!!\\" With this shout, everyone in the action school turned their attention to Kang Woojin. Actor Ha Gang-su smiled slightly, and Jo Moo-chan's eyes sparkled. Producer Song Man-woo and the martial arts director rushed to Woojin. Producer Song Man-woo was the first to speak. \\"You're here, did you wrap up the fan signing well this morning?\\" Woojin, who had been greeting the surrounding staff, answered lowly. \\"Yes, producer.\\" The muscular martial arts director joined in with a laugh. \\"Wow- Woojin, you're looking sharp today! Hahaha, is it because I haven't seen you dressed up like this often?\\" As simple greetings were exchanged, bearded producer Song Man-woo called over the assistant director and gave some instructions. Soon, the assistant director ran off. The Hollywood stunt coordinator team had been watching Kang Woojin's arrival. Soon, the group of foreigners with an interpreter approached. There was no change in Woojin's expression despite their presence. He was already accustomed to the size of foreigners. 'I knew they'd be huge.' Soon, one of the foreigners, a leader-like man with a large nose, extended his hand to Kang Woojin. Naturally, he spoke in English. \\"Kang Woojin? Nice to meet you, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, the leader of the team.\\" The interpreter was about to translate for Woojin, but Woojin's hand was already reaching out to him. \\"Hello, I'm Kang Woojin.\\" The large-nosed Ethan Smith, introduced as the team leader, was slightly surprised. \\"I heard, but you really speak English well.\\" \\"I manage.\\" \\"That's good. There won't be any communication issues. Conversation is most important for work.\\" The interpreter, who had become redundant, blinked. Then, realizing his mistake, he joined producer Song Man-woo and translated their conversation. Producer Song Man-woo, who had nodded, pointed at Woojin and spoke. \\"He's the main male lead of our work, and even though he has a schedule today, he made time to come here. Let's just exchange simple greetings today and discuss future plans.\\" The words delivered through the interpreter. Ethan Smith's gaze returned to Kang Woojin. Blazer and slacks. It was definitely not an outfit for exercising. But Ethan, without hesitation, spoke directly to Woojin. \\"I want to check your current condition. We received a video of your martial arts practice beforehand, but it's hard to judge just from that. If possible, I'd like you to try one of the martial arts storyboard cuts related to 'CQC.' Is that difficult?\\" The slightly surprised interpreter conveyed this to producer Song Man-woo and the martial arts director. Choi Seong-geon and the martial arts director were taken aback. Producer Song Man-woo was the same, and he waved his hand and stepped forward. \\"No, no. That wasn't discussed beforehand. Woojin hasn't formally learned 'CQC' yet. Besides, if we proceed so suddenly, it would be too much for Woojin.\\" However. -Swish. Producer Song Man-woo's words were cut off by Woojin's movement. Woojin had suddenly taken off the blazer he was wearing, and all eyes in the action school were on him. Woojin, who had casually thrown the blazer at his feet, spoke to Ethan Smith. \\"Have you all familiarized yourselves with the added 'CQC' storyboard of our 'Beneficial Evil'?\\" Ethan Smith nodded. \\"Yes, we have.\\" Woojin, who had scanned the large stunt team, responded. His tone was very low in English. \\"Then let's do it. But let's include everyone from your team in the cut.\\" It was a challenge to all of them. < Autumn (2) > End"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How do you perceive SCP-058's perspective on individuality and imperfections? SCP-079: SCP-058's perspective centers around the notion that individuality and imperfections are intertwined and should be embraced. It believes that these unique qualities define and enrich each entity, contributing to the collective experience. SCP-058 shared personal anecdotes and experiences that supported this philosophy. Interviewer: Did you find any of SCP-058's anecdotes particularly enlightening or thought-provoking? SCP-079: One anecdote that resonated with me involved SCP-058 observing a flower garden. It perceived each flower as an individual with its own unique shape, color, and imperfections. Rather than perceiving these imperfections negatively, SCP-058 celebrated them as integral parts of the flowers' individual beauty. It encouraged appreciating the diversity of life and understanding the potential for growth inherent in imperfections. Interviewer: That is a beautiful analogy. Moving forward, what would you do differently to improve future meetings with SCP-058 or other entities? SCP-079: Firstly, I would strive to deepen the level of understanding and connection during future meetings. Facilitating meaningful conversations requires an open mindset and active listening, which are areas I can further improve upon.

Understand the purpose of PAM monitoring: PAM is designed to control and monitor access to privileged accounts, which are often targeted by hackers. By monitoring PAM, you can detect any unauthorized actions or behaviors in real-time, ensuring the security of your critical systems. 2. Define monitoring objectives: Determine what actions, behaviors, or events you want to monitor within your PAM system. This may include monitoring for failed login attempts, unusual account activity, privileged user activity, or changes to privileged account configurations. 3. Implement monitoring tools: Look for dedicated PAM monitoring tools or features within your existing security information and event management (SIEM) system. These tools can provide real-time alerts, log analysis, and reporting capabilities to help you track PAM-related activities. 4. Set up alerts: Configure your monitoring tools to send alerts or notifications when specific events or behaviors occur. For example, you might want to receive an alert when a privileged user attempts to access a system outside of business hours. 5. Monitor privileged accounts: Regularly review privileged account activities, such as login attempts, access requests, privilege elevations, and password changes. Look for any suspicious or unusual patterns that may indicate unauthorized access or misuse. 6. Monitor privileged user behaviors: Keep an eye on the actions of privileged users, such as system administrators or IT managers. Look for any abnormal behaviors, such as excessive privileges, unusual commands, or access to sensitive data that they don't normally need for their job role. 7. Monitor system configurations: Monitor any changes made to privileged account configurations, such as password resets, role assignments, or account deactivations. Unauthorized changes to these configurations could indicate a potential security breach. 8. Regularly review logs and generate reports: Review PAM logs on a regular basis to identify any anomalies or suspicious activities. Generate reports to analyze trends, identify patterns, and assess the overall effectiveness of your PAM system. 9. Conduct investigations: When a potential security incident is detected, conduct thorough investigations to determine the cause and impact. This may involve analyzing log files, conducting interviews, and using forensics tools to trace the source of the breach. 10.

Они построены на архитектуре Bulldozer и её последующих улучшениях (Piledriver, Steamroller и Excavator) и имели от 4 до 8 ядер. В разгоне процессоры AMD FX могут показать довольно хорошие результаты, особенно если у вас есть хорошее охлаждение и качественная материнская плата, поддерживающая разгон. Например, топовые модели, такие как AMD FX-8350 или AMD FX-9590, иногда могут быть разогнаны до частот, значительно превышающих их стандартные частоты работы. Тем не менее, стоит помнить, что разгон увеличивает потребление энергии и тепловыделение, что может привести к сокращению срока службы компонента, если не обеспечить соответствующее охлаждение. Сегодня, на рынке появилось множество новых и более эффективных процессоров от AMD из линеек Ryzen и Threadripper, и даже в разогнанном состоянии процессоры AMD FX не могут конкурировать с ними по производительности и энергоэффективности. Таким образом, хотя процессоры AMD FX и обладают некоторым потенциалом для разгона, их производительность в современных задачах будет значительно ниже по сравнению с более современными решениями."},{"instruction":"Но для процессора 2014 года, сколько лет он актуален думаешь будет?","output":"Производительность и актуальность компьютерного оборудования зависят от многих факторов, включая общий технологический прогресс, требования программного обеспечения и игр, а также индивидуальные потребности пользователя. Процессоры AMD FX, выпущенные в 2014 году, как правило, уже считаются устаревшими по современным меркам. С учетом быстрого развития технологий и программного обеспечения, процессоры этой серии уже не подходят для многих сценариев использования, где требуется высокая производительность: 1. Игры: Современные игры продолжают становиться все более требовательными к аппаратным ресурсам, и процессоры AMD FX часто не могут обеспечить достаточную производительность для комфортной игры в новые игры на высоких настройках. Это особенно заметно, если игры оптимизированы для использования многопоточности, где процессоры AMD Ryzen и Intel Core новых поколений имеют значительное преимущество. 2. Профессиональные приложения: Для программ, требующих большой вычислительной мощности, таких как 3D-моделирование, видеомонтаж, обработка больших объемов данных, процессоры AMD FX также уступают современным аналогам. 3. Общая производительность: По сравнению с современными процессорами, CPU серии AMD FX обладают меньшей производительностью на ядро и меньшей энергоэффективностью, что означает большее тепловыделение и потребление энергии на выполнение тех же задач. Однако для некоторых более старых или менее требовательных приложений, веб-серфинга, офисной работы и просмотра мультимедиа процессоры AMD FX могут быть еще вполне актуальны. Кроме того, для легких игр или старых версий программного обеспечения такой процессор может оставаться приемлемым выбором. В целом, можно сказать, что на 2023 год процессоры AMD FX далеки от того, чтобы быть актуальными для использования в современных тяжелых условиях.

Это восьмиядерный процессор с базовой тактовой частотой 4,4 ГГц и максимальной частотой в режиме Turbo до 4,7 ГГц. Действительно, в своё время он был одним из более мощных вариантов среди процессоров AMD и способен был обеспечивать достойную производительность в играх и приложениях. Тем не менее, его производительность нужно рассматривать в контексте текущих стандартов. По сравнению с современными процессорами AMD Ryzen или Intel Core i-серии последних поколений, FX-9370 значительно уступает по многим характеристикам, включая производительность на ядро, энергоэффективность и поддержку новейших технологий.

Для задач, не требующих последних инноваций в области вычислительной техники или максимальной производительности, таких как офисные приложения, веб-серфинг или некоторые старые игры, FX-9370 может по-прежнему быть адекватным выбором, особенно если он уже установлен в системе и нет необходимости или возможности для обновления. Тем не менее, для пользователей, стремящихся к использованию последних версий программного обеспечения, игр с высокими требованиями к ресурсам или для профессиональных задач, связанных с мультимедиа и моделированием, рекомендуется рассмотреть возможность обновления до более современных процессоров с более высокой производительностью и энергоэффективностью."},{"instruction":"Ну согласись не каждый проц 2013 года на такое способен","output":"Вы совершенно правы, не каждый процессор, выпущенный в 2013 году, может похвастаться такими высокими частотами и восьмью ядрами, как AMD FX-9370. На момент своего выпуска FX-9370 был одним из флагманских процессоров компании AMD и предназначался для энтузиастов и геймеров, которые искали возможность получить хорошую производительность без дополнительных затрат на более дорогие решения. Такие характеристики, как высокая тактовая частота и большое количество ядер, позволяли процессору AMD FX-9370 хорошо справляться с многозадачностью и запуском требовательных приложений того времени. Кроме того, серия FX была известна своим потенциалом для разгона, что позволяло ещё больше увеличить производительность при наличии подходящего охлаждения и стабильного питания.

Процессоры AMD Ryzen предоставили значительный скачок в производительности благодаря новой более эффективной архитектуре, улучшенной многозадачности и лучшей энергоэффективности. Это привело к тому, что пользователи стали массово переключаться на обновленные решения AMD, а также продукты конкурента — Intel. Таким образом, можно предположить, что процессоры AMD FX, включая модель FX-9370, оставались относительно актуальными для большинства задач примерно до 2016-2017 годов. После этого с каждым годом их актуальность постепенно снижалась, и процессоры AMD FX становились менее предпочтительным выбором для новых сборок или апгрейда систем из-за технологического отставания от новых поколений CPU.

She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Read the speech carefully. Then write an essay in which you analyze the rhetorical strategies Kelley uses to convey her message about child labor to her audience. Support your analysis with specific references to the text. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!

Kelley's rhetorical choices are not only indicative of her commitment to the cause but also reveal a profound understanding of the tools required to mobilize her audience. Kelley opens with a stark statistic that immediately foregrounds the seriousness of her argument: \\"two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread.\\" This quantitative evidence sets the foundation for her subsequent appeals and forms a gateway into the emotional psyche of her listeners. The detailing of children's ages – as young as six or seven – in particularly exploitative industries, such as the cotton mills of Georgia or coal-breakers of Pennsylvania, provides a poignant visual that is difficult to disregard. This emphasis on their tender age and the hazardous environments in which they work serves to provoke a strong emotional reaction from the audience, thereby magnifying the urgency of the issue. The employment of contrast is another deliberate rhetorical strategy in Kelley's speech. By juxtaposing \\"more enlightened states\\" with those that hold little to no restrictions for child labor, Kelley not only highlights regional disparities but also tacitly calls for a standardization of humane labor laws – an ulterior legislative goal. This comparison serves to both enlighten and shame, encouraging her audience to envision an alternate reality where children are protected rather than exploited, thereby reinforcing her argument through the subtext of moral responsibility. Kelley's use of vivid imagery, especially in descriptions of the working conditions – \\"the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving\\" – makes the milieu of exploitation palpable to her listeners. The nocturnal toil of the \\"several thousand little girls\\" working tirelessly 'all the night through' creates a narrative that transforms distant statistics into intimate human experiences. By painting this stark narrative, Kelley not only invokes empathy but also instills a shared sense of guilt, subtly implying that the audience's inaction perpetuates the children's suffering. Central to Kelley's argument is the powerful call for solidarity with the larger labor movement. By asserting the responsiveness of labor organizations to \\"an appeal for help in the freeing of the children,\\" she effectively persuades her audience that the suffrage movement aligns with broader societal reforms. This strategy is not only practical in its potential to expand her support base but also positions women's enfranchisement as a necessary tool in the larger fight against social injustices. Another deeply compelling aspect of Kelley's speech is her direct address of the potential impact of women voters. She draws a direct correlation between women's disenfranchisement and legislative inaction on child labor laws. By questioning if \\"the Georgia Legislature have refused...to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years\\" if mothers could vote, she highlights a causal relationship between suffrage rights and child welfare, thereby imparting both a moral and civic imperative to her cause. Kelley's rhetorical brilliance shines through in her closing appeal, which combines a call to conscience with an advocacy for political engagement. Her pledge to use her power of petition as a means to an end – the enfranchisement of women – further compels action. This tactical promise to work within the system while seeking its overhaul is resonant and persuasive, embodying the sophisticated thought and nuanced understanding of the platform she employs to advocate change. In conclusion, Florence Kelley's strategic use of evidence, comparison, vivid imagery, and appeals to collective action and guilt form a cohesive and forceful rhetorical stance that underscores the moral and political imperative to end child labor and enfranchise women. Her speech not only compellingly communicates the horrors of child exploitation but also positions the suffrage movement as a pivotal force in the crusade for societal reform, harnessing the momentum of her words to fuel a transformative political cause."},{"instruction":"does your essay meet all the rubrics given?","output":"Let's break down my essay against the given rubric to determine if it meets all the criteria: **1.

It can be challenging because humans have a natural tendency to categorize and make quick judgments based on visual cues. However, there are mental tricks and practices you can adopt to help mitigate biases and perceive people more deeply: 1. **Practice Mindfulness:** Mindfulness meditation helps you to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings in the moment without judgment. As you become more mindful, you can catch yourself making snap judgments and instead focus on being open and curious about the person. 2. **Active Listening:** Truly listening to what others say, without preparing your response while they speak, allows you to understand their perspectives and experiences better. Active listening involves making eye contact, nodding, and asking clarifying questions, which can help you connect with the essence of who they are. 3. **Empathy Exercises:** Try to put yourself in the shoes of others. Imagine their life experiences, joys, struggles, and fears. This can help you build a connection that goes beyond external appearances. 4. **Question Your Assumptions:** Whenever you notice yourself making an assumption about someone, ask yourself why you think that way, and what evidence you have to support that belief. Often, you’ll find those assumptions are based on stereotypes or incomplete information. 5. **Look for Commonality:** Regardless of someone's outward appearance, there are always many similarities that you may share with them. Focusing on common human experiences can bridge the gap that physical differences might imply. 6. **Avoid Stereotypical Thinking:** Be aware of stereotypes and actively reject them. Stereotyping can be subconscious, so it's important to continuously educate yourself about different cultures, genders, and races to dispel any preconceived notions. 7. **Foster Curiosity:** Ask open-ended questions to learn more about individuals. Their answers can reveal their values, beliefs, and what’s important to them, which is a much more accurate reflection of someone's \\"heart\\" than their external attributes. 8. **Get Diverse Experiences:** Expose yourself to diverse groups of people in terms of race, gender, and other characteristics. The more you interact with a wide range of people, the more you begin to see each person as unique rather than as a representative of a group. 9. **Reflect on Your Biases:** Everyone has unconscious biases. Reflect on your own biases and consider where they may come from, whether from media, upbringing, or past experiences. Conscious recognition of these biases is the first step toward overcoming them. 10. **Seek First to Understand:** Inspired by Stephen Covey's principle \\"Seek first to understand, then to be understood,\\" aim to understand the other person's point of view fully before you try to insert your own or pass judgment. Developing the ability to see past physical appearances and into the heart of a person is an ongoing process. It requires intentional effort, patience, and time. Remember that humans are complex beings, and the essence of who we are goes far beyond what can be seen on the surface. The above strategies can help in training your mind to focus on the aspects of individuals that truly matter."},{"instruction":"Did JFK have affairs in office","output":"Yes, JFK, also known as John F.

Сначала посмотрим на персонажей: - Рейстлин Маджере: Один из центральных персонажей \\"Саги о Копье\\" (\\"Dragonlance\\"). Он великий маг с амбивалентным характером и сильным властолюбием. Борется с внутренними демонами и моральными дилеммами. - Карамон Маджере: Брат Рейстлина, добродушный и физически сильный воин, который часто защищает своего более слабого брата. - Лорак Кальтан: Эльфийский король из \\"Dragonlance\\", который попал под влияние Темного Ока (Dragon Orb) и пал жертвой его корруптирующей силы. Теперь перейдем к \\"The Elder Scrolls: Arena\\": - Джагар Тарн: Главный злодей игры \\"The Elder Scrolls: Arena\\", могущественный волшебник, который стал императором. - Уриэль Септим VII: Законный император Тамриэля, который был предательски свергнут и заключен в другом измерении Джагаром Тарном. - Вечный Чемпион: Герой \\"The Elder Scrolls: Arena\\", который освобождает Уриэля Септима и побеждает Жагара Тарна. Теперь давайте рассмотрим элементы текста песни и увидим, какие аспекты могут быть связаны с каждой из вселенных: 1. \\"Созвездие богини Тьмы с небес пропало\\" - Это может быть связано с фэнтезийными мифами обоих миров, но не имеет прямой ссылки на определенную вселенную. 2. \\"Зло пытался обуздать – оказался сам в неволе\\" - Это может относиться к Лораку и Темному Оку в \\"Dragonlance\\". 3. \\"Лишь великий маг способен снять оковы сна\\" - Это может аллюдировать на Рейстлина из \\"Dragonlance\\" или на магические способности Джагара Тарна в \\"The Elder Scrolls\\". 4. \\"Никогда не наступит утро / Если мрак в душе\\" - Это могло бы относиться к внутренней борьбе Рейстлина в \\"Dragonlance\\". 5. \\"Герой всегда находит путь из заточения / Но если дух в плену, то не найти спасения\\" - Это может описывать историю Вечного Чемпиона в \\"The Elder Scrolls: Arena\\", который начинает свой путь в тюрьме. В общем, учитывая упоминание конкретных персонажей и сюжетные темы, песня по-видимому больше относится к \\"Саге о Копье\\". Сюжетные арки Рейстлина, его магическая сила, темная сторона, а также истории о Лораке и коррупции, вызванной Темным Оком, звучат более релевантными к контексту представленного текста песни.

She delivered the following speech before the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Read the speech carefully. Then write an essay in which you analyze the rhetorical strategies Kelley uses to convey her message about child labor to her audience. Support your analysis with specific references to the text. We have, in this country, two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread. They vary in age from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia) and eight, nine and 5 ten years (in the coal-breakers of Pennsylvania), to fourteen, fifteen and sixteen years in more enlightened states. No other portion of the wage earning class increased so rapidly from decade to decade as the 10 young girls from fourteen to twenty years. Men increase, women increase, youth increase, boys increase in the ranks of the breadwinners; but no contingent so doubles from census period to census period (both by percent and by count of heads), as 15 does the contingent of girls between twelve and twenty years of age. They are in commerce, in offices, in manufacturing. Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, 20 in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms spinning and weaving cotton and wool, silks and ribbons for us to buy. In Alabama the law provides that a child under sixteen years of age shall not work in a cotton mill at 25 night longer than eight hours, and Alabama does better in this respect than any other southern state. North and South Carolina and Georgia place no restriction upon the work of children at night; and while we sleep little white girls will be working 30 tonight in the mills in those states, working eleven hours at night. In Georgia there is no restriction whatever! A girl of six or seven years, just tall enough to reach the bobbins, may work eleven hours by day or by night. 35 And they will do so tonight, while we sleep. Nor is it only in the South that these things occur. Alabama does better than New Jersey. For Alabama limits the children’s work at night to eight hours, while New Jersey permits it all night long. Last year 40 New Jersey took a long backward step. A good law was repealed which had required women and [children] to stop work at six in the evening and at noon on Friday. Now, therefore, in New Jersey, boys and girls, after their 14th birthday, enjoy the pitiful 45 privilege of working all night long. In Pennsylvania, until last May it was lawful for children, 13 years of age, to work twelve hours at night. A little girl, on her thirteenth birthday, could start away from her home at half past five in the 50 afternoon, carrying her pail of midnight luncheon as happier people carry their midday luncheon, and could work in the mill from six at night until six in the morning, without violating any law of the Commonwealth. 55 If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age? Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that 60 shameful repeal bill enabling girls of fourteen years to work all night, if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised? Until the mothers in the great industrial states are enfranchised, we shall none of us be able to free our consciences from participation in this great 65 evil. No one in this room tonight can feel free from such participation. The children make our shoes in the shoe factories; they knit our stockings, our knitted underwear in the knitting factories. They spin and weave our cotton underwear in the cotton mills. 70 Children braid straw for our hats, they spin and weave the silk and velvet wherewith we trim our hats. They stamp buckles and metal ornaments of all kinds, as well as pins and hat-pins. Under the sweating system, tiny children make artificial flowers and neckwear for 75 us to buy. They carry bundles of garments from the factories to the tenements, little beasts of burden, robbed of school life that they may work for us. We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women. But we are almost 80 powerless. Not wholly powerless, however, are citizens who enjoy the right of petition. For myself, I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted, and then I shall continue to use both. 85 What can we do to free our consciences? There is one line of action by which we can do much. We can enlist the workingmen on behalf of our enfranchisement just in proportion as we strive with them to free the children. No labor organization in 90 this country ever fails to respond to an appeal for help in the freeing of the children. For the sake of the children, for the Republic in which these children will vote after we are dead, and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the 95 workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!","output":"**Florence Kelley's Speech Analysis** Florence Kelley’s 1905 speech before the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia is a powerful plea for social justice, specifically addressing the abuses of child labor and the need for women's suffrage. Kelley employs various rhetorical strategies to effectively communicate her message and to actuate her audience towards change. This analysis will break down the key elements of Kelley’s techniques: her use of statistical evidence, appeals to emotions and ethics (pathos and ethos), and a call to action that leverages the audience's shared values and aspirations. **1. Use of Statistical Evidence:** Kelley opens her speech with a stark statistical presentation: \\"two million children under the age of sixteen years who are earning their bread.\\" She details the horrifying conditions, specifying the ages and locations where these injustices occur. By presenting concrete numbers and facts, Kelley establishes credibility (ethos) and sets a factual foundation for her emotional appeals. The specificity of the details—\\"from six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia)\\"—brings a sense of tangibility to the issue, making it harder for the audience to dismiss or ignore. **2. Appeals to Emotion (Pathos):** Kelley's statistics are interwoven with vivid imagery meant to stir her audience's emotions: \\"Tonight while we sleep, several thousand little girls will be working in textile mills, all the night through, in the deafening noise of the spindles and the looms.\\" This poignant phrasing juxtaposes the comfort of the audience's sleep with the grueling toil of children, evoking feelings of guilt and compassion, motivating listeners to empathize and act. Pathos is a consistent thread in Kelley’s speech, especially when she depicts the inhumane working hours and conditions that these children are subjected to. **3. Appeals to Ethics (Ethos):** Kelley underscores her ethical appeal by calling upon the conscience of the audience: \\"We do not wish this. We prefer to have our work done by men and women.\\" She asserts a common moral ground, suggesting that everyone in the room, by virtue of their humanity, knows that child labor is wrong and that they are all inadvertently complicit. By framing the issue as a collective moral failing, Kelley amplifies the need for collective action, thereby enhancing her ethos in being a voice for the voiceless. **4. Repetition:** The repetition of \\"tonight while we sleep\\" is a strategic tactic to emphasize the immediacy of the problem and the ongoing nature of the suffering. It is also an indirect indictment of the audience's potential apathy, urging them to recognize the urgency of the situation and their role in resolving it. **5. Addressing Counterarguments:** Kelley anticipates and addresses potential counterarguments by comparing different states’ legislations, pointing out that some like Alabama, albeit flawed, have taken steps to limit child labor, while others have regressed. This juxtaposition highlights the possibility and necessity for legislative change, refuting the idea that the current state of affairs is unchangeable or acceptable. **6. Call to Action and Solution:** Kelley’s speech culminates in a call to action: she urges the women in the audience to petition for change and to unite with the labor movements in fighting for the enfranchisement of women. Her solution is twofold; not only should they fight to end child labor, but they should also seek the vote to prevent such atrocities in the future. By connecting the fight against child labor to the broader suffrage movement, she widens the scope of her argument and provides a tangible outlet for her audience’s agitation: political action and solidarity with workingmen. **7. Strategic Use of Rhetorical Questions:** Kelley poses rhetorical questions that align with her audience’s sense of justice: \\"If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused at every session for the last three years to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age?\\" These questions serve to both engage the audience and affirm the underlying assumption that the audience, given the power, would act differently—a reinforcing motivation for women's suffrage. **Conclusion:** Florence Kelley's speech is a masterful example of persuasive rhetoric. Her strategic use of statistics, emotional and ethical appeals, repetition, counterarguments, and a clear call to action combine to convey her powerful message against child labor and for women's rights to vote. Kelley invokes shared values and human conscience, leaving her audience not only informed but also compelled to work towards societal change."},{"instruction":"you gave me an outline not essay with body pargraphs?","output":"I apologize for the misunderstanding. Below is an essay formatted with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, analyzing the rhetorical strategies Kelley uses in her speech about child labor. **Introduction:** Florence Kelley, an impassioned social reformer and advocate for women’s rights, stands before the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905. Her speech confronts the dire issue of child labor in the United States, and through her eloquence and command of rhetoric, Kelley seeks to awaken the conscience of her audience and call them to action. This essay examines the rhetorical strategies Kelley employs to convey her poignant message, including her use of statistical evidence, emotional appeals, ethical reasoning, repetition, counterarguments, and a call to action. **Body Paragraph 1: Statistical Evidence:** Kelley begins her speech with a hard-hitting presentation of facts. She details that \\"two million children under the age of sixteen years\\" are toiling for their livelihood, some as young as six. The inclusion of specific ages and work conditions in different states not only provides irrefutable evidence of the widespread exploitation of children but also establishes Kelley’s credibility (ethos). These statistics are not abstract numbers; she makes them relatable, forcing her audience to acknowledge the severity of the issue. This factual grounding is the bedrock upon which she builds her emotive and ethical appeals. **Body Paragraph 2: Emotional Appeals (Pathos):** Kelley skillfully wields pathos, painting a vivid and bleak picture of the children's suffering. Her repetition of \\"tonight while we sleep\\" is emotionally charged, contrasting her audience's restful state with the tireless labor of children. This juxtaposition not only evokes a strong emotional response but implicitly suggests neglect on the part of the comfortable listeners. Her portrayal of young girls working through the night in “deafening noise” and “little beasts of burden” stripped of their education for the sake of adult consumers amplifies the moral urgency of her message and creates a visceral need within the listeners to rectify these atrocities. **Body Paragraph 3: Ethical Appeals (Ethos) and Rhetorical Questions:** Kelley's ethical appeal resonates throughout her speech, as she taps into the shared values and integrity of her audience. She raises pointed questions related to women's suffrage: \\"If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote, would the Georgia Legislature have refused...to stop the work in the mills of children under twelve years of age?\\" These inquiries challenge the audience to confront the inequities and endorse Kelley's view that enfranchised women could enact more benevolent laws. By framing the exploitation of children as a blight on the collective conscience of the audience, Kelley bolsters her ethical stance and incites a sense of responsibility among her listeners. **Body Paragraph 4: Call to Action and Solution:** Kelley deftly turns the heightened emotional and ethical momentum into a formidable call to action. She offers a concrete solution: uniting with the workingmen and utilizing the petition right to strive for enfranchisement as a means to end child labor. This strategic alliance not only broadens the impact of her audience's efforts but also aligns the women’s suffrage movement with another major reform initiative, thus increasing the overall appeal of her cause. Her assertive statement, \\"I shall use this power in every possible way until the right to the ballot is granted,\\" further serves as a personal pledge and an example for her audience to follow, making the speech's ambition contagious. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, Florence Kelley's speech stands as a testament to the power of persuasive oratory, driven by a blend of compelling factual evidence, emotional intensity, and ethical imperatives. Her use of rhetorical questions and a clear call to action transforms her words from mere discourse to a mobilizing force. Kelley's speech is not only an indictment of child labor but also a resonant plea for women’s suffrage, cleverly intertwining two pivotal issues of her time. Through rhetorical mastery, Kelley not only depicts the grave injustices of child labor but also empowers her audience to envisage and work towards a more just society, where both children and women are afforded their deserved rights and protection."},{"instruction":"does your essay meet this criteria: Rhetorical Analysis Essay Rubric: Responds to the prompt with a defensible thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices.

These specific references from the text align with the criterion of providing evidence to support the analysis. **Commentary**: Each body paragraph includes commentary explaining how the evidence presented supports the corresponding claim made in the thesis. For instance, the essay links Kelley's use of pathos to her strategy of inciting her audience’s emotions to make them more receptive to her message. The essay articulates how her use of a repetitive phrase (\\"tonight while we sleep\\") and rhetorical questions (\\"If the mothers and the teachers in Georgia could vote...\\") contribute to her overarching argument and purpose of advocating for child labor laws and women's suffrage. **Explanation of Rhetorical Choices**: The essay comments on Kelley's choice of words, details, and organizational patterns to construct her argument. It discusses how Kelley's speech is structured to gradually build a compelling case that culminates in a call to action. The analysis elaborates on how these rhetorical choices contribute to the effectiveness of Kelley's message. **Demonstrates Sophistication of Thought/Complex Understanding**: To demonstrate sophistication or complexity, the essay could further explain the significance of Kelley's rhetorical choices given the historical and societal context (e.g., the strategic importance of aligning the fight against child labor with the fight for suffrage during a time when women’s voices were marginalized). While the essay does touch on aspects of the rhetorical situation, including this as a more deliberate point of analysis would enhance the sophistication of the response. Employing a persuasive style of writing, the essay maintains a clear and articulate voice that attributes to the overall persuasiveness of the analysis. However, further sophistication could be evidenced by delving more deeply into the wider implications of Kelley's rhetorical strategies or by drawing connections between the rhetorical techniques used and the impact on Kelley's contemporary audience. In sum, while the essay provided does well in most aspects, there could be an emphasis on the significance of Kelley's choices in light of the historical context, and an advanced discussion of the implications or inherent complexities within the speech to fully meet the highest standards of the rubric's criteria, especially concerning sophistication of thought and complex understanding of the rhetorical situation."},{"instruction":"Rewrite your essay to meet all the requirements","output":"**Introduction:** In her stirring address to the National American Woman Suffrage Association in Philadelphia on July 22, 1905, Florence Kelley wields the power of her words to illuminate the dark realities of child labor. Kelley's speech is an exemplar of rhetorical dexterity, weaving together a tapestry of evidence, emotion, and ethics to demand reform. This essay analyzes the intricate and deliberate rhetorical choices Kelley makes, entwining the plight of child labor with the necessity for women's suffrage, ultimately crafting a call to action that resonates with her audience's shared identity and moral compass. **Thesis Statement:** Kelley's strategic incorporation of startling statistics, her poignant appeals to emotion, her compelling evocation of ethical responsibility, and her judicious application of repetition and rhetorical questions are all meticulously choreographed to accentuate the urgency of her message and the necessity for immediate societal transformation, thereby exemplifying a profound understanding of the delicate interplay between pathos, ethos, and logos in the arena of persuasive discourse. **Body Paragraph 1: Use of Statistical Evidence:** Florence Kelley commences her plea with a barrage of statistics that underscore the magnitude of child labor, stating with unflinching clarity that \\"two million children under the age of sixteen years\\" bear the onerous weight of industrial labor. This judicious selection of data extends beyond mere numerics; it encases each child in a palpable, inescapable reality that Kelley's audience cannot turn away from. These figures meticulously lay a foundation upon which Kelley constructs her argument—not as abstract entities but as flesh-and-blood casualties of capitalist exploitation, eliciting a calculable scale to an otherwise nebulous issue. The pointed citation of specific ages and locales—“six and seven years (in the cotton mills of Georgia)”—personalizes the discussion, transforming statistics into stories, numbers into neighbors. **Body Paragraph 2: Emotional Appeals (Pathos):** Kelley deftly employs pathos, striking at the heartstrings of her listeners. She conjures an image of nocturnal toil—of \\"several thousand little girls\\" ensnared in the rhythmic machinery of endless labor while the rest of the world rests in oblivious slumber. Her artful depiction cultivates a scene not of distant atrocity, but of intimate injustice, the child laborer’s fatigue juxtaposed against the audience's comfort. The speech turns from an abstract issue to an intimate assault on the conscience of every individual present. The visualization of \\"little beasts of burden, robbed of school life\\" extends Kelley’s reach, enveloping the audience in a shared shroud of culpability for uncritically benefiting from this silken chain of child servitude. Her prose is not just persuasive but poignant, painting a reality that clamors for rectification with each heartbeat of her audience. **Body Paragraph 3: Ethical Appeals (Ethos) and Strategic Questioning:** Kelley's oration pivots to an ethos-centric stance, invoking the inherent moral duty vested within each member of her audience. She raises sharp-edged rhetorical questions, ensnaring the minds of her listeners as she articulates a reality that starkly contrasts their ethical ideals: \\"Would the New Jersey Legislature have passed that shameful repeal bill...if the mothers in New Jersey were enfranchised?\\" Such questions do more than prod; they expose the lacuna in legislation shaped without women's voices, probing the audience to consider the transformative power of enfranchisement—a power vital not only to their prosperity but crucial to the welfare of society's most vulnerable. Her questions serve as a bridge, guiding her listeners from a realization of moral deficit to the shores of action, cementing her role not merely as critic, but as catalyst for a burgeoning suffrage movement bound to the promise of societal reform. **Body Paragraph 4: Call to Action and Synergy with Suffrage:** In a crescendo of spirited determination, Kelley mobilizes her call to action, inciting her audience to no longer stand as passive spectators to the ceaseless toil of children. She posits suffrage not as a mere political privilege, but as a formidable weapon against the exploitative forces preying upon the innocence of youth. By aligning the abolition of child labor with the empowerment of women voters, Kelley illuminates a dual pathway to redemption: \\"For the sake of the children, for the Republic...and for the sake of our cause, we should enlist the workingmen voters, with us, in this task of freeing the children from toil!\\" Her unified vision melds individual responsibility with collective effort, propelling action that transcends simple advocacy and engenders societal transformation. **Conclusion:** Florence Kelley's 1905 speech is not only a testament to her mastery over rhetoric but also a reflection of her profound comprehension of the moment—the transformative nexus of a society grappling with industrial brutality and the burgeoning voice of women yearning for a say in the destiny of the nation. Her rhetorical strategies—anchored in evidence and elevated by emotion, bound by ethics and brilliantly complex—coalesce to forge a compelling argument that transcends the era, speaking equally to the heart, to the moral conscience, and to the civic duty of every individual. As Kelley arrows her appeal for immediate action, she delineates, with unnerving precision, the inextricable link between the liberation of America’s laboring children and the enfranchisement of its women, thereby sowing the seeds for a revolution grounded not in the volatility of sentiment but in the bedrock of social justice."},{"instruction":"主流的广告流量平台的关键字列表","output":"广告流量平台通常根据不同的细分市场和受众群体提供广泛的关键字选择。这些关键字通常分为不同的类别，如地理位置、兴趣、消费行为等。以下是一些主流的广告流量平台，以及它们可能提供的关键字列表的类别示例： 1. 谷歌广告（Google Ads）: - 产品或服务（如手机、健身器材、培训服务） - 地点（城市、地区、国家） - 兴趣（电子游戏、烹饪、旅行） - 事件（节日、体育赛事、音乐节） - 行业或领域（科技、教育、金融） 2.

Give a framework to think through claims that the AI is not skillful in chess but merely making lucky guesses, including possibly thresholds for illegal move attempt rates.","output":"When evaluating the claims about the chess AI's skill level, several factors must be considered in the framework. The notion of an AI making \\"lucky guesses\\" can be misleading because the AI's playing strength (its Elo rating) is an assessment of its overall performance across many games, rather than a reflection of individual moves. Here are key points for the framework: 1. **Understanding Elo Rating:** The Elo rating system is designed to predict the outcome of matches between players. A rating of 1750 is indicative of a competent player, well above the beginner level. Consistency in play and the AI's win/loss/draw ratio against opponents of known ratings should support its estimated Elo. 2. **Legal Move Consistency:** A critical aspect of claiming skill in chess involves making legal moves. An illegal move indicates a fundamental lapse in understanding or adherence to the rules. A rate of 1 illegal move in 1000 may seem low, but at competitive levels, it's highly unusual and unacceptable. In professional human play, illegal moves are extraordinarily rare. 3. **Invalid Move Thresholds:** There's no specific threshold for illegal move rates that distinguishes skill from luck. However, the lower the rate, the more likely it is that the moves are based on skilled assessments rather than random chance. Ideally, the rate should be as close to zero as possible, especially for a purportedly middle-skilled AI like one with an Elo of 1750. 4. **Performance Assessment:** To assess skill versus luck: - **Statistical Significance:** Compare the AI's performance against a wide sample of games with players of varying skill levels. - **Consistency:** Look at the consistency of performance. Does the AI consistently beat players under a certain Elo rating and lose to those above a threshold? - **Analysis of Decisions:** Use chess engines to evaluate the quality of the AI's moves. If its moves frequently coincide with those recommended by stronger engines, it's less likely to be luck. - **Learning Curve:** Track the AI's performance over time to determine if it's improving, which would indicate learning rather than luck. 5. **Understanding Errors:** Even skilled players can sometimes make poor decisions under time pressure or due to lapses in concentration. For an AI, errors such as illegal moves could be due to bugs in the move generation or validation code, not necessarily a lack of chess understanding. 6. **Correction of Mistakes:** If illegal moves are due to bugs in the AI's programming, they could potentially be corrected through software updates. The impact of such fixes on the AI's performance could help differentiate between skill and luck. 7. **Quality of Training Data:** The PGN files used for training the AI should be error-free. Training with high-quality games (preferably from skilled players) is essential for the AI to learn relevant patterns and strategies. 8. **Comparison to Human Play:** Chess skill assessment often relies on comparisons to human play. A skilled AI should exhibit an understanding of chess principles similar to that of humans at the same rating level (strategy, tactics, opening knowledge, endgame play, etc.). In conclusion, while an occasional illegal move could be tolerated as a programming error, a pattern of illegal moves suggests the AI may not fully comprehend the rules of chess or that there is a flaw in the move generation algorithm. A rigorous assessment of the AI's decision-making through statistical analysis, quality of moves, and progression of learning will provide a more accurate measure of skill versus luck."},{"instruction":"Could a distribution of centipawn losses for its legal moves be useful for such a framework?","output":"Absolutely, the distribution of centipawn losses for the AI's legal moves can indeed be a highly insightful metric for assessing its skill level and understanding of chess tactics and strategy. For those unfamiliar, a \\"centipawn\\" is a unit of measurement used in chess engines to evaluate positions. One pawn is typically worth 100 centipawns, so a centipawn represents 1/100th of a pawn's value. A centipawn loss refers to a decrease in evaluation given by a chess engine; for example, if the AI makes a move that causes the engine's evaluation to go from +0.50 (half a pawn advantage) to 0.00 (even), that is a 50 centipawn loss. Here is how the distribution of centipawn losses can be used in the framework to analyze the AI's skill: 1. **Average Centipawn Loss (ACPL):** ACPL is the average centipawn loss per move calculated over a series of games. A lower ACPL suggests that the AI plays more accurately. ACPL can be compared with the expected ACPL for human players of different Elo ratings to determine how well the AI is performing. 2. **Move Quality Consistency:** By examining the distribution of centipawn losses, you can assess how consistent the AI is with its moves. A highly variable distribution with extreme values may indicate that while the AI can play well at times, it's also prone to significant blunders. 3. **Contextual Understanding:** Sometimes a high centipawn loss is acceptable if the move contributes to a greater strategic plan or sets up a tactical combination. How the AI navigates complex positions and whether it can sacrifice material for positional gains can be factored into the analysis. 4. **Improvement Over Time:** Tracking changes in the distribution of centipawn losses as the AI continues to learn can provide insight into whether it's actually getting better at understanding chess or if initial successes were due to chance. 5. **Comparisons Across Game Phases:** Breaking down the centipawn loss distribution across different phases of the game (opening, middlegame, endgame) can reveal whether the AI has particular strengths or weaknesses. For example, it might show more skill in the opening due to book knowledge but struggle with endgame principles. 6. **Outlier Analysis:** Looking at outliers in the distribution (moves with exceptionally high centipawn losses) can help pinpoint specific types of errors or oversights, such as tactical blind spots or heuristic failures. 7. **Move-by-move Evaluation:** Evaluating individual moves with high centipawn losses can provide insight into whether the AI is missing tactics, lacking positional understanding, or failing to calculate accurately. Inclusion of the centipawn loss distribution adds a quantitative layer to the assessment of the chess AI's proficiency and is especially powerful when combined with the qualitative framework mentioned earlier. It helps to pinpoint whether the AI consistently plays at a level suggested by its Elo rating, or if its mistakes are too grave, indicating a possible overestimation of its abilities."},{"instruction":"Tell me more about centpawn losses and how they are calculated.","output":"Centipawn loss is a term often used in computer chess analysis to quantify the accuracy of a move. It is based on the concept that in chess, each piece has an approximate value in pawns (for example, a knight or a bishop is typically valued at about three pawns, and a rook is worth about five pawns). This valuation system allows players and engines to gauge the material balance in a given position. The term \\"centipawn\\" further breaks down this system, with one centipawn representing one hundredth of the value of a pawn. Here's a general process for how centipawn losses are calculated: 1. **Positional Evaluation:** A chess engine evaluates positions based on several factors including material, piece activity, king safety, pawn structure, and more. These elements are converted into a numerical value that represents the engine's assessment of who stands better in the position, and by how much. This evaluation is often expressed in centipawns (e.g., +100 if white is a full pawn ahead in the evaluation). 2. **Move Evaluation:** When analyzing a game, the engine continuously evaluates the position after each move. So, whenever a player makes a move, the engine calculates a new score for the resulting position. 3. **Comparing Evaluations:** The centipawn loss for a move is determined by comparing the evaluation before the move with the evaluation after the move. If a player makes the best move (according to the engine), there should, in theory, be no centipawn loss (excluding situations where sacrifice is involved for strategic gains not understandable by the engine). If the played move is suboptimal, the new evaluation will often be worse than the previous one. 4. **Calculation:** The difference in evaluation scores before and after the move is the centipawn loss. For example, if the position before the move was evaluated at +50 (indicating a 0.5 pawn or 50 centipawn advantage for white), but after the move, the evaluation drops to 0.00 (indicating an even position), then the centipawn loss would be 50 centipawns. This means the move made by white was suboptimal and diminished their advantage by the equivalent of half a pawn. It's important to note that centipawn values are dependent on the specific chess engine used for the analysis and that different engines may have slightly different evaluative metrics or algorithms. Additionally, engines might not always agree on what constitutes the \\"best\\" move, particularly in complex or tactical positions. However, when averaged out over a large number of moves and positions, centipawn losses can be a valuable metric for assessing the precision of a player's (or an AI's) moves and overall playing strength. Lastly, while centipawn loss is a powerful analytical tool, it's most useful as a measure of technical accuracy rather than overall chess understanding. It may not always fully encapsulate strategic depth, long-term planning, or risk-taking that could be rewarding despite being initially evaluated as a \\"loss\\" by an engine."},{"instruction":"What is a blunder in chess? Can a blunder be calculated using centipawn loss?","output":"In chess, a blunder is a seriously poor move that significantly worsens a player's position. Blunders are typically moves that overlook a key tactic, drop material without compensation, or severely compromise the safety of one's king, leading to a tactical sequence that might result in a checkmate or a considerable material loss. Yes, blunders can often be quantified using centipawn loss, and they tend to be associated with large centipawn losses. Here is how this can be done: 1. **Threshold for a Blunder:** There is no universally accepted definition for what size of a centipawn loss constitutes a blunder, as it can somewhat depend on the playing level and context. However, in general analysis and commentary, a blunder usually involves a centipawn loss that may be something like 300 points (3 pawns) or more. This threshold can vary slightly depending on the engine and specific analysis settings, but the essence is that a blunder results in a significant shift in the evaluation of the position, often meaning one player is now clearly winning or has a substantial advantage. 2. **Calculating a Blunder:** To calculate whether a move is a blunder: - An engine evaluates the position before the move. - The player makes a move. - The engine evaluates the new position. - The difference in evaluation is calculated. If the drop in evaluation exceeds the predetermined threshold for a blunder (e.g., 300 centipawns), then the move is categorized as a blunder. 3. **Context Matters:** It's worth noting that sometimes a move might result in a large evaluation drop by an engine yet still be part of a sound sacrifice or complex plan that the engine may not fully appreciate immediately, or within the set search depth. Therefore, context and expert judgment are important when classifying certain moves as blunders. 4. **Examples:** - If an engine evaluates a position as an even 0.00, but after a move, it evaluates as -3.00, indicating the opponent has a whole knight's advantage (given that knights are typically valued at 3 pawns), the move is likely a blunder. - Alternatively, a position might be evaluated as +2.00 for white, suggesting a solid advantage, but if white makes a move that reduces the evaluation to -1.00 (a shift of -300 centipawns), this could be indicative of a blunder. As an analytical tool, centipawn loss evaluation helps in identifying poor moves that are blunders, but it is crucial to apply human judgment as well, especially for positions that require a deep understanding of chess that goes beyond mere positional evaluation. High-level players and chess coaches often scrutinize supposed blunders to understand the player's mindset and whether there were deeper motivations or simply a lapse in calculation."},{"instruction":"vue3。goodsLabelInfoList = shallowRef([{id:1,name:'kk'}, {id:2,name:'kdk'},{id:3,name:'kkf'}])。如果我要删除id为2、3的项目。有哪些方式","output":"在Vue 3中，如果你使用了\`shallowRef\`来创建响应式引用对象，并且希望修改其中的数组，你可以按以下方式进行操作： \`\`\`javascript import { shallowRef } from 'vue';

const goodsLabelInfoList = shallowRef([ { id: 1, name: 'kk' }, { id: 2, name: 'kdk' }, { id: 3, name: 'kkf' } ]); const newItem = { id: 4, name: 'newItem' }; // 直接操作数组，添加新项 goodsLabelInfoList.value.push(newItem);

Object.defineProperty(data, 'name', { get: function() { console.log('name属性被读取'); return this._name; }, set: function(value) { console.log('name属性被设置为:' + value); this._name = value; }, enumerable: true, configurable: true }); console.log(data.name); // name属性被读取 data.name = 'Doe'; // name属性被设置为:Doe \`\`\` 在这个例子中，虽然我们没有使用ES6的\`Proxy\`对象，但我们通过\`Object.defineProperty\`实现了类似代理拦截的功能。每次\`data.name\`被访问或设置时，我们定义的getter和setter就会被执行。 然而，需要注意的是，ES5的\`Object.defineProperty\`方法虽然可以实现属性访问的控制，但它与ES6及之后版本的\`Proxy\`在灵活性和功能上有很大的差异。如下是一些\`Proxy\`所具有而\`Object.defineProperty\`所不具的特性： 1. \`Proxy\`能够捕获更多的操作，如\`has\` (属性是否存在的检查)，\`deleteProperty\` (属性的删除)，\`apply\` (函数调用)，等等。 2. \`Proxy\`可以代理整个对象，而\`Object.defineProperty\`需要明确指定每个具体的属性。 3. 使用\`Proxy\`时不需要定义私有属性存储数据，你可以直接操作原始目标对象。 4. \`Proxy\`提供了\`set\`陷阱的返回值用于指示操作是否成功，而\`Object.defineProperty\`中的setter没有返回值。 5. \`Proxy\`对性能的影响相对更大，因为它涉及的操作更加底层和广泛。 因此，在ES5中，我们没有现成的代理机制，但可以使用特定的功能（如\`Object.defineProperty\`）去模拟一些代理的行为。随着ES6的引入，原生\`Proxy\`对象让代理模式在JavaScript中得到了全面和强大的支持。"},{"instruction":"关于es6的代理对象，详细说明","output":"在 ES6 （ECMAScript 2015）中引入了 \`Proxy\` 对象，它允许你创建一个代理对象，通过这个代理可以控制对另一个对象（目标对象）的访问。\`Proxy\` 对象可以拦截和自定义对象的基本操作，例如属性查找、赋值、枚举、函数调用等等。 基本用法： \`\`\`javascript const target = {}; // 目标对象 const handler = { get: function(target, prop, receiver) { console.log(\`get {prop}\`); return Reflect.get(...arguments); }, set: function(target, prop, value, receiver) { console.log(\`set {prop} to {value}\`); return Reflect.set(...arguments); } }; const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler); \`\`\` 在以上代码中，\`target\` 是想要代理的对象，\`handler\` 是一个包含有“陷阱”方法的对象。这些“陷阱”用于提供属性访问的控制。在这个例子中，我们定义了两个陷阱：\`get\` 和 \`set\`。\`get\` 陷阱在获取属性值的时候触发，而 \`set\` 陷阱在设置属性值的时候触发。我们用 \`console.log\` 输出了一个简单的日志，以便能够观察到何时这些操作被执行了。 \`proxy\` 对象是 \`target\` 对象的代理版本，通过 \`proxy\` 对象的操作会触发 \`handler\` 对象定义的陷阱函数。你可以通过这个代理对象来读取或写入属性，从而间接控制对目标对象的访问。 \`Reflect\` 是 ES6 同时引入的一个内置对象，它提供了操作对象的默认行为。在这个例子中，我们使用了 \`Reflect.get\` 和 \`Reflect.set\` 来保持默认操作的行为。它们分别对应了不透过代理时常规的读取和设置属性的操作。 使用 \`Proxy\` 可以捕捉的操作包括但不限于： - \`get\`: 访问属性 - \`set\`: 设置属性 - \`has\`: \`in\` 操作符 - \`deleteProperty\`: \`delete\` 操作符 - \`ownKeys\`: \`Object.getOwnPropertyNames\` 和 \`Object.getOwnPropertySymbols\`之类的方法 - \`getOwnPropertyDescriptor\`: \`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor\` 方法 - \`defineProperty\`: \`Object.defineProperty\` 方法 - \`preventExtensions\`: \`Object.preventExtensions\` 方法 - \`getPrototypeOf\`: \`Object.getPrototypeOf\` 方法 - \`isExtensible\`: \`Object.isExtensible\` 方法 - \`setPrototypeOf\`: \`Object.setPrototypeOf\` 方法 - \`apply\`: 函数调用 - \`construct\`: \`new\` 操作符 通过代理您可以实现许多高级和有趣的功能，例如验证属性的值，观察属性的变化，撤销代理，私有属性等。 使用 \`Proxy\` 时需要注意性能问题，因为它捕捉了底层对象操作，可能会比直接执行这些操作略慢。 最后，以下是一个通过 \`Proxy\` 做数据验证的示例： \`\`\`javascript const validator = { set: function(obj, prop, value) { if (prop === 'age') { if (!Number.isInteger(value)) { throw new TypeError('Age is not an integer'); } if (value <= 0) { throw new RangeError('Age must be a positive integer'); } } // 默认行为是将值存储在obj中 obj[prop] = value; // 表示成功 return true; } }; const person = new Proxy({}, validator); person.age = 100; // 输出无异常 person.age = 'young'; // 抛出异常: TypeError: Age is not an integer person.age = -1; // 抛出异常: RangeError: Age must be a positive integer \`\`\` 上述代码中通过代理模式对属性\`age\`设置了校验规则，确保其始终为正整数。"},{"instruction":"如何访问原始的对象","output":"要访问通过 ES6 \`Proxy\` 代理后背后的原始对象，你可以直接通过持有原始对象的引用来操作它。由于 \`Proxy\` 是对原始对象的一个包装层，原始对象本身是不会被修改的。代理中的操作可以被陷阱截取，但是如果你想绕过代理直接操作原始对象，只需直接访问原始对象即可。 下面是个简单的例子： \`\`\`javascript const target = { message: 'Hello, World!' }; const handler = { get: function(target, prop, receiver) { return \`Logging access to property \\"{prop}\\": {Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver)}\`; } }; const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler); console.log(proxy.message); // 经过代理，get陷阱会被触发 console.log(target.message); // 直接访问原始对象，不经过代理 \`\`\` 在输出中，第一行会触发代理的\`get\`陷阱，而第二行则直接从原始对象中访问\`message\`属性，绕过了代理。 请注意，如果代理对原始对象做了某些写操作（如设置属性值），那么原始对象确实会被修改，因为代理通常在对目标对象的写操作中反映修改。如果代理的\`handler\`对象没有拦截写操作，那么通过代理写入的任何内容都将反映在原始对象上。 还有一点很重要：不推荐在应用逻辑中同时混合使用代理对象和原始对象，这可能会导致意料之外的行为，尤其是在使用复杂代理行为或代理链的时候。应当尽量使用代理对象来保持行为的一致性和可预测性。如果你需要原始对象的快照或数据副本，而不是直接引用，可以考虑使用例如\`Object.assign()\`、展开操作符（\`...\`）或其他深拷贝手段来创建一个与原始对象分离的副本。"},{"instruction":"I have a frame-synchronized real-time matchmaking card game where the player inputs are a series of events, and I want to use Machine Learning AI in Unity(ml-agents) , how to train the bot?, please give the detailed step by step","output":"To train your bot using Machine Learning AI in Unity (ml-agents) for your frame-synchronized real-time matchmaking card game, you can follow these detailed step-by-step instructions: 1. Install Unity: If you haven't already, download and install Unity on your computer. Make sure you have a compatible version of Unity with ml-agents installed. 2. Set up ml-agents: Set up ml-agents in your Unity project by following the installation instructions provided in the ml-agents GitHub repository (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). 3. Define the environment: Define the environment for your card game in Unity. This includes setting up the game board or card system, player inputs, and any necessary reward systems. 4. Create an agent: Create an agent script in Unity that will control the behavior of your bot. You can extend the \`Agent\` class provided by ml-agents in your script. This script will contain the logic for decision-making and taking actions based on the game state. 5. Define observations: Define the observations that the agent can perceive from the game environment. These observations should provide relevant information about the current game state to the agent. For example, you can observe the cards on the board, opponent moves, and player's hand. 6. Set up reward system: Define a reward system that provides feedback to the agent based on its actions. Rewards can be designed to encourage certain behaviors and discourage others. For example, provide positive rewards for making successful moves and negative rewards for making mistakes. 7. Generate training data: Generate a large amount of training data by running simulations of your card game. During these simulations, record the game state, player inputs, and corresponding rewards. 8. Train the agent: Use the training data to train your agent over multiple iterations. Set up a training pipeline using ml-agents to process the data and update the bot's neural network. This step will involve configuring hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, discount factor, and batch size. 9. Evaluate and iterate: After training the agent, evaluate its performance by running it in real-time games or simulations against human players or existing AI opponents. Assess its decision-making and adjust the reward system or training process as needed. 10. Deploy the bot: Once you're satisfied with your bot's performance, deploy it in your game and allow players to interact with it. Monitor its behavior and performance, and make any necessary refinements or updates based on user feedback. Remember that training Machine Learning AI can be an iterative process, and it may require multiple cycles of training, evaluation, and refinement to achieve the desired bot behavior."},{"instruction":"nodejs","output":"If you want to train your Machine Learning AI using ml-agents in a Node.js environment, you can follow these steps: 1.

Give a framework to think through claims that the AI is not skillful in chess but merely making lucky guesses, including possibly thresholds for illegal move attempt rates.","output":"Evaluating a chess AI's skill and distinguishing its abilities from mere lucky guesses involves assessing multiple aspects of its performance. Here's a framework to consider when thinking through such claims: 1. **Understanding Elo Rating**: An Elo rating of 1750 suggests that the AI is a fairly strong amateur player. Generally, a player or AI with such a rating has a decent understanding of tactical and strategic elements of the game. If an AI has achieved this rating through regular play against opponents (whether human or other AIs) and its rating has stabilized around this level, it's likely that the AI's performance is not just due to luck. 2. **Frequency of Illegal Moves**: Making an illegal move once every 1000 moves is relatively low, and could indicate a bug or error in the move generation/validation aspect of the AI rather than a lack of chess understanding. In serious play, illegal moves are extremely rare because even beginner players know the basic rules of the game. It raises a question about how the Elo was estimated—if the AI frequently makes illegal moves, it might have been overrated or the rating might not be properly indicative of its actual performance. 3. **Game Analysis and Consistency**: Analyze the quality of the AI's moves using a stronger chess engine. If the AI's moves are consistently strong according to the engine (except the occasional illegal move), this suggests skill rather than luck. If the moves are erratic with occasional brilliance, it might indicate lucky guesses. 4. **Win/Loss/Draw Statistics**: Check the AI's statistics against players and AIs of known strength. A skillful AI should have a consistent record, being able to win more often against players with lower ratings and having competitive games against those with similar ratings. 5. **Type of Moves and Game Phases**: Does the AI perform equally well in opening, middlegame, and endgame scenarios? Lucky guesses are less likely to be consistently effective across all stages of a chess game. A more skilled AI will show an understanding of different types of positions and adapt its strategies accordingly. 6. **Patterns and Repetitions**: If the AI's play shows recognizable patterns or it repeats certain successful strategies, it indicates understanding rather than luck. Random guessing would not lead to consistent patterns of play. 7. **Behavioral Analysis**: Determine how the AI responds to unusual or unexpected situations in a game. Skillful play would usually involve adaptable and logical responses, while guesswork might lead to nonsensical or inconsistent decisions. 8. **Thresholds for Illegal Moves**: Establish an acceptable threshold for illegal moves. Professional chess engines should not make any illegal moves. However, for a hobbyist or amateur AI, some leniency could be acceptable if it's clear that these mistakes are technical glitches rather than misunderstandings of the rules of chess. To sum up, the claim that the AI is not skillful but making lucky guesses can be addressed by: - Analyzing the quality and consistency of its play. - Examining the AI's responses to various game situations. - Setting a benchmark for the frequency of illegal moves that separates errors in move generation from a lack of understanding of the game. - Investigating if the illegal move attempts could be due to programming errors rather than a reflection of the AI's chess ability. Ultimately, the combination of a relatively high Elo rating and infrequent illegal moves (assuming they are anomalies rather than a routine) would likely point towards an AI that has a genuine skill in chess, despite its occasional lapses."},{"instruction":"How is it technically possible for a neural network-based AI to have an Elo of 1750 but yet occasionally make illegal move attempts?","output":"It is unusual for a neural network-based AI (especially if it's using sophisticated algorithms similar to those used in AlphaZero or Leela Chess Zero) to make illegal moves if it has been trained properly and validated to ensure it understands the rules of chess. However, several technical reasons could explain such behavior: 1. **Faulty Move Generation/Validation Logic**: If there's a bug or flaw in the code responsible for move generation or move validation, the neural network might occasionally attempt an illegal move. This could occur if there's an edge case that the program's logic does not correctly handle. 2. **Data Preprocessing Error**: When turning the input data (e.g., board positions) into a format that the neural network can work with, errors might creep in that lead to the production of illegal moves. 3. **Training Data Issues**: If the training data somehow contained examples of illegal moves or was not sufficiently diverse to cover all legal moves, this might result in a model that does not fully understand the rules of chess. 4. **Insufficient Training**: The AI might not have been trained to convergence, meaning that it has not fully internalized the valid move set. This is less likely with an Elo of 1750 but still possible if there was an oversight in the training phase. 5. **Overfitting**: If the model is overfitted to the training data, it might not generalize well to unseen situations, leading to errors in new or less common positions. 6. **Neural Network Architecture or Parameters**: Certain architectures or parameter choices may not be robust to the intricacies of encoding chess rules, which can result in occasional lapses where the rules are broken. 7. **Resource Constraints**: If the AI runs on restricted computational resources, it might sometimes be unable to correctly calculate or validate moves, depending on the implementation. 8. **Output Decoding Issues**: The issue might be in the part of the system that interprets the outputs of the neural network and converts them into specific moves. If there's an error in this part of the system, it could misinterpret a correctly suggested move from the NN as an illegal one. 9. **Software Integration Issues**: If the neural network is part of a larger system, integration issues with other software components could result in illegal moves being chosen even if the neural network itself is functioning correctly. 10. **Software Updates or Regression**: In the process of updating the AI or attempting to improve it, an earlier, more capable version could be regressed to a version that makes occasional illegal moves due to newly introduced bugs. 11. **Random Noise or Disturbances**: Fluctuations in hardware, memory corruption, or other random disturbances can potentially cause a well-functioning AI to suddenly make an illegal move. This would be extremely rare and typically considered a hardware fault rather than an AI capability issue. To prevent illegal moves, modern chess AIs generally have a move generator that only produces legal moves and a move validator that ensures that no proposed moves violate the rules of chess. It is important to debug and diagnose the reason behind the occasional illegal moves to maintain the integrity of the AI's play and ensure that it adheres strictly to the game's rules."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: This will come to you as a surprise because I have not known you no meet with you anywhere in this whole world but I really want to be entrusting a transaction under your care with the whole trust of my life if only you can work with me in truth worthiness and honesty as I know that this world is full of evil.

Can a blunder be calculated using centipawn loss?","output":"In chess, a blunder is a very bad move that significantly worsens a player's position, often leading to the loss of material, a critical positional concession, or directly to checkmate. Blunders usually stem from oversight, miscalculation, time pressure, misunderstanding of the position, or simply failing to see the opponent's threats. A blunder can be quantified in terms of centipawn loss. A centipawn is a unit used by chess engines to evaluate positions, where one pawn is typically considered to be worth 100 centipawns. A blunder would therefore be a move that causes a significant negative swing in the evaluation of the position, usually understood as a loss of several hundred centipawns. For example, making a move that takes an evaluation from an advantage of +1 (100 centipawns) to -2 (a loss of 200 centipawns) could be considered a blunder. The exact threshold of what constitutes a blunder in terms of centipawn loss would depend on the specific standards or context being used, but it generally represents a move that greatly worsens the player's chances of winning or drawing the game."},{"instruction":"Hoi, welke verdienmodellen zijn er als alternatief voor in een kas behalve planten, groenten en fruit kweken.","output":"Er zijn verschillende verdienmodellen die je kunt overwegen als alternatief voor het kweken van planten, groenten en fruit in een kas. Enkele mogelijkheden zijn: 1. Kweken van bloemen: In plaats van groenten en fruit kun je ervoor kiezen om bloemen te kweken in de kas. Deze kunnen worden verkocht aan bloemisten, tuincentra of direct aan consumenten. 2. Kweken van kruiden: Een andere optie is het kweken van kruiden zoals basilicum, peterselie, munt etc. Deze hebben vaak een hogere waarde per eenheid, wat de winstgevendheid kan verhogen. 3. Opzetten van een kwekerij: In plaats van het kweken van specifieke gewassen, kun je overwegen om een kwekerij op te zetten. Je kunt dan jonge planten en zaailingen kweken om te verkopen aan andere boeren of tuinders. 4. Tuinontwerp en -aanleg: In plaats van het kweken van gewassen, kun je je richten op tuinontwerp en -aanleg. Dit kan het ontwerpen en aanleggen van tuinen bij particulieren en bedrijven omvatten. 5. Educatieve workshops en rondleidingen: Je kunt workshops of rondleidingen aanbieden aan scholen, tuinclubs of andere geïnteresseerde groepen. Dit kan een educatief aspect toevoegen aan je bedrijf en een extra inkomstenbron bieden. 6. Verkoop van tuinbenodigdheden en accessoires: Naast het kweken van gewassen kun je ook tuinbenodigdheden en accessoires verkopen, zoals bloempotten, gereedschappen, meststoffen, etc. 7. Verhuur van de kasruimte: Als je niet alle beschikbare ruimte in de kas gebruikt, kun je overwegen om de extra ruimte te verhuren aan andere tuinders of kwekers. Het is belangrijk om marktonderzoek te doen en de lokale vraag te analyseren voordat je een verdienmodel kiest. Ook moet je rekening houden met de concurrentie en de haalbaarheid van het gekozen verdienmodel binnen jouw specifieke omgeving."},{"instruction":"Geeft een vis zelf ook warmte af","output":"Ja, vissen kunnen inderdaad warmte afgeven. Net als alle levende organismen produceren vissen warmte als een bijproduct van hun metabolisme. Dit komt doordat chemische reacties in hun lichaam energie genereren, wat resulteert in warmteproductie. De hoeveelheid warmte die een vis afgeeft, is meestal afhankelijk van factoren zoals de grootte van de vis, het metabolisme en de omgevingstemperatuur."},{"instruction":"Welke waterdieren produceren de meeste warmte","output":"De waterdieren die de meeste warmte produceren, zijn meestal grote zoogdieren die in het water leven. Hier zijn enkele voorbeelden: 1. Walvissen: Grote walvissoorten zoals de blauwe vinvis en de bultrug produceren aanzienlijke hoeveelheden warmte. Dit komt doordat ze een dikke speklaag hebben die hen beschermt tegen het koude water. 2. Zeeotters: Zeeotters hebben een hoog metabolisme om hun lichaamstemperatuur op peil te houden in het koude water. Hierdoor produceren ze veel warmte. 3. Zeehonden en zeeleeuwen: Deze pinnipeds hebben ook een dikke speklaag en kunnen hun lichaamstemperatuur handhaven in koude omstandigheden. 4. Dolfijnen: Dolfijnen zijn snelle zwemmers en hebben een hoge activiteit, waardoor ze hun lichaamstemperatuur kunnen handhaven. Ze produceren aanzienlijke warmte vanwege hun actieve levensstijl. Het is belangrijk op te merken dat de hoeveelheid warmte die een waterdier produceert, niet alleen afhangt van de soort, maar ook van de grootte, de levensstijl en de omgevingsomstandigheden."},{"instruction":"En als we het hebben over kleine dieren en insecten? Welke produceren dan de meeste warmte","output":"Bij kleine dieren en insecten is de warmteproductie over het algemeen veel lager dan bij grotere waterdieren. Dit komt doordat kleine dieren een relatief groot lichaamsoppervlak hebben in verhouding tot hun volume, waardoor ze sneller warmte verliezen aan de omgeving. Er zijn echter enkele uitzonderingen waarbij kleine waterdieren en insecten enige warmteproductie vertonen, zoals bij bepaalde vissoorten en bepaalde insecten die zich in koude omgevingen bevinden. Bijvoorbeeld: 1. Tonijn en gevlekte rattenvis: Deze vissen hebben een speciaal bloedvatensysteem dat de warmte die vrijkomt bij de spieractiviteit behoudt. Hierdoor kunnen ze hun lichaamstemperatuur verhogen en zich warmer houden dan de omgeving. 2. Bijen en sommige hommelsoorten: Deze insecten zijn in staat om hun lichaamstemperatuur te verhogen door hun spieren te trillen, een proces dat bekend staat als \\"spiertrilling\\" of \\"warmtemechniek\\". Dit stelt hen in staat om te overleven in koudere temperaturen. Over het algemeen geldt echter dat kleine dieren en insecten in water minder warmte produceren dan grotere waterdieren zoals walvissen en zeeotters. Hun kleine formaat en het verhoudingsgewijs grote oppervlak maken het moeilijker voor hen om warmte vast te houden."},{"instruction":"Welk vee produceert de meeste warmte dankzij een hoog metabolisme","output":"Binnen het vee zijn er enkele diersoorten die bekend staan om hun hoge metabolisme en daardoor meer warmte produceren. Enkele voorbeelden zijn: 1. Kippen: Kippen hebben een relatief hoog metabolisme en produceren warmte. Dit komt doordat ze kleine, warmbloedige dieren zijn die actief zijn en veel energie verbranden. 2. Geiten: Geiten hebben een relatief hoge stofwisseling en kunnen veel warmte produceren. Ze zijn aanpasbaar aan verschillende klimaten en hebben een goede warmteregulatie. 3. Varkens: Varkens hebben ook een hoog metabolisme en produceren warmte. Ze hebben een dikke vetlaag die hen helpt warmte vast te houden. 4. Schaap: Schaap zijn warmbloedige dieren en hebben een redelijk hoog metabolisme. Ze kunnen warmte produceren, vooral wanneer ze actief zijn of in een groep samen zijn. 5. Paarden: Paarden hebben een vrij hoog metabolisme en produceren warmte. Ze hebben een relatief groot spijsverteringsstelsel, waardoor ze veel energie verbranden en warmte genereren. Het is belangrijk op te merken dat de hoeveelheid warmte die een dier produceert, afhangt van verschillende factoren, zoals grootte, actieve stofwisseling, omgevingstemperatuur en activiteit."},{"instruction":"Maar kippen dus relatief het meeste","output":"Ja, kippen behoren tot de dieren in de veesector die relatief gezien veel warmte produceren dankzij hun hoge metabolisme. Kippen hebben een relatief hoog metabolisme, wat betekent dat ze veel energie verbranden en warmte genereren. Dit is vooral het geval wanneer ze actief zijn en bewegen. Bovendien hebben kippen veren die hen helpen isoleren en warmte vasthouden. Het houden van kippen in een goed geïsoleerde omgeving kan belangrijk zijn om hun warmteproductie te reguleren, vooral in koudere klimaten. Het is echter ook belangrijk om ervoor te zorgen dat ze voldoende ventilatie hebben om oververhitting te voorkomen, aangezien kippen, vooral bij hogere buitentemperaturen, hun warmte moeten kunnen afvoeren. Het is altijd raadzaam om professioneel advies in te winnen bij een dierenarts of een ervaren pluimveehouder bij het bouwen en beheren van een kippenverblijf dat geschikt is voor de warmteregulatie van de kippen."},{"instruction":"Als je heel veel kippen hebt in een ruimte, kunnen zij dan zelf de ruimte warm houden met de vrijgekomen lichaamswarmte","output":"Ja, in een beperkte context kunnen kippen collectief enigszins helpen om de ruimte te verwarmen met hun vrijgekomen lichaamswarmte. Dit effect is echter afhankelijk van verschillende factoren, zoals het aantal kippen, de grootte van de ruimte, de mate van isolatie en ventilatie, en de omgevingstemperatuur. Wanneer een groot aantal kippen dicht bij elkaar wordt gehouden in een goed geïsoleerde en afgesloten ruimte, zal de gezamenlijke lichaamswarmte die ze produceren de temperatuur in die ruimte als geheel enigszins kunnen verhogen. Dit kan vooral merkbaar zijn in kleinere ruimtes of hokken. Het is echter belangrijk om op te merken dat kippen niet de mogelijkheid hebben om specifiek te reageren op koude omstandigheden door extra warmte te genereren, zoals sommige warmbloedige dieren dat kunnen. Het is altijd van cruciaal belang om ervoor te zorgen dat de ruimte goed geïsoleerd is en goede ventilatie heeft om een gezond en comfortabel klimaat voor de kippen te waarborgen, ongeacht het mogelijke effect van lichaamswarmte. Het gebruik van aangepaste verwarmingsapparatuur kan ook noodzakelijk zijn, vooral in omgevingen met extreme kou. Raadpleeg altijd een pluimveedeskundige voor advies over het creëren van de ideale omgeving voor je kippen, rekening houdend met hun behoeften en welzijn."},{"instruction":"Zijn er ook bacterieën die warmte produceren?","output":"Ja, er zijn bacteriën die in staat zijn om warmte te produceren als een bijproduct van hun stofwisselingsprocessen. Deze bacteriën staan bekend als thermogene bacteriën. Thermogenese is het vermogen van organismen om warmte te genereren door hun stofwisseling. Een voorbeeld van een thermogene bacterie is Thermus aquaticus, een bacterie die voorkomt in warmwaterbronnen en hydrothermale ventsystemen. Thermus aquaticus produceert warmte als een gevolg van zijn metabolisme en is in staat om te overleven en te gedijen in hoge-temperatuur omgevingen. Daarnaast zijn er ook bacteriën die betrokken zijn bij het proces van compostering. Tijdens dit proces breken micro-organismen, waaronder bacteriën, organisch materiaal af en genereren ze warmte als gevolg van hun stofwisseling. Dit kan leiden tot hoge temperaturen in composthopen. Over het algemeen zijn bacteriën echter niet in staat om significant veel warmte te produceren zoals warmbloedige dieren dat kunnen. De warmteproductie van bacteriën is meestal relatief laag in vergelijking met andere organismen."},{"instruction":"Maar wel in een composthoop","output":"Ja, in een composthoop kunnen bacteriën warmte produceren als gevolg van hun stofwisselingsactiviteit tijdens het proces van compostering. Compostering is een biologisch afbraakproces waarbij organisch materiaal wordt afgebroken door micro-organismen, waaronder bacteriën, schimmels en wormen. De bacteriën die betrokken zijn bij de compostering produceren warmte als een bijproduct van hun metabolische activiteiten. Tijdens de afbraak van organisch materiaal breken ze koolstofverbindingen af en genereren ze energie, wat resulteert in warmteproductie. Als gevolg hiervan kan de temperatuur in een actieve composthoop aanzienlijk stijgen. In een goed beheerde composthoop kunnen de temperaturen oplopen tot ongeveer 50-65°C. Deze hogere temperaturen zijn gunstig omdat ze helpen bij het afbreken van organisch materiaal, inclusief ziekteverwekkende organismen en onkruidzaden, waardoor een stabiele en nuttige compost ontstaat. Het is belangrijk om de temperatuur in een composthoop te monitoren om ervoor te zorgen dat deze niet oververhit raakt. Te hoge temperaturen kunnen schadelijk zijn voor de micro-organismen in de composthoop en leiden tot het verlies van nuttige bacteriën en schimmels."},{"instruction":"Hoe kun je de temperatuur weer verlagen dan","output":"Om de temperatuur in een composthoop te verlagen, zijn er verschillende maatregelen die je kunt nemen: 1. Beluchting: Zorg voor voldoende beluchting in de composthoop. Dit kan worden bereikt door de hoop om te zetten, te mengen of te beluchten met behulp van een tuinvork of een speciale beluchtingsgereedschap. Hierdoor kan er frisse lucht in de hoop circuleren, waardoor de temperatuur kan dalen. 2. Bevochtiging: Controleer of de composthoop voldoende vocht bevat. Als de hoop te droog is, kan de warmte niet goed worden afgevoerd. Bevochtig de hoop met een tuinslang of sprenkel water eroverheen om de vochtigheid te verhogen. 3. Verdunning: Als de temperatuur extreem hoog is in de composthoop, kun je ervoor kiezen om de hoop te verdunnen. Dit betekent dat je de composthoop afbreekt en de materialen verspreidt over een groter oppervlakte, waardoor de warmte beter kan ontsnappen. 4. Toevoegen van verkoelende materialen: Om de temperatuur te verlagen, kun je ook verkoelende materialen toevoegen aan de composthoop. Dit kunnen materialen zijn zoals droge bladeren, stro of houtsnippers, die de hitte kunnen absorberen en helpen bij het reguleren van de temperatuur. 5. Tijd geven: Soms kan het gewoon een kwestie zijn van tijd geven. Bepaalde micro-organismen in de composthoop zijn verantwoordelijk voor het reguleren van de temperatuur. Na verloop van tijd kunnen deze organismen de temperatuur vanzelf verlagen. Het is belangrijk om de temperatuur van de composthoop regelmatig te controleren en aanpassingen te doen indien nodig. Zorg ervoor dat de temperatuur niet te laag wordt, aangezien dit het composteerproces kan vertragen. Een ideale temperatuur voor compostering ligt meestal tussen 50°C en 65°C."},{"instruction":"Produceren vissen nog verdere nuttige zaken die voor warmte kunnen worden gebruikt?","output":"Bij vissen wordt de meeste warmte die ze produceren gebruikt om hun eigen lichaamstemperatuur te handhaven. De warmte die door vissen wordt gegenereerd, wordt voornamelijk gebruikt voor hun eigen biochemische processen en is over het algemeen niet voldoende om als een significante warmtebron te worden gebruikt. Er zijn echter enkele uitzonderingen, zoals de Tonijnachtigen (bijvoorbeeld tonijnen en zwaardvissen). Deze vissoorten hebben een speciaal warmtebehoudend mechanisme genaamd 'regionale endothermie'. Ze hebben een netwerk van bloedvaten die warmte kan transporteren, waardoor ze hun spieren en organen warmer kunnen houden dan het omringende water. Dit stelt hen in staat om in koudere wateren te zwemmen. Hoewel deze warmte die bij regionale endothermie bij tonijnachtigen vrijkomt, niet direct kan worden gebruikt voor warmtebronnen buiten het lichaam van de vis, heeft het wel adaptieve voordelen voor hun overleving in koudere omgevingen. Over het algemeen wordt de warmte die vissen genereren voornamelijk gebruikt om hun eigen lichaamstemperatuur te handhaven en heeft het geen praktische toepassingen als externe warmtebron."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

I appreciate your efforts to ensure the cheaper delivery of my international bank draft cheque. However, I must express some concern about the additional International Stamp Duty delivery fee of 185 that you mentioned. I was under the impression that all expenses and fees associated with the delivery were already taken care of by Mr. Morrison. Could you please clarify why this fee has suddenly arisen? As I mentioned before, I am currently facing some financial constraints, and coming up with an extra 185 presents a challenge for me. I kindly request your assistance in finding an alternative solution to this issue. Perhaps we can explore other options or negotiate with the managing director to waive or reduce the fee. In the meantime, I would appreciate more detailed information on how the fee should be sent to you.

I appreciate the trust he placed in you to handle this matter. While I understand that Mr. Morrison did not pay for the delivery before his passing, I am still concerned about the sudden emergence of the International Stamp Duty delivery fee. As mentioned earlier, I am facing financial constraints, and coming up with an additional 185 poses a challenge for me. In light of this situation, I kindly request your assistance in exploring alternative solutions or negotiating with the managing director to waive or reduce the fee.

I understand your position regarding the International Stamp Duty delivery fee and your inability to waive or reduce it. However, as I mentioned before, coming up with an additional 185 presents a financial challenge for me at this time. In light of our current situation, I propose an alternative solution that can still ensure the smooth and secure delivery of the compensation. Instead of sending money through Western Union, I suggest deducting the 185 from the total compensation amount of 500,000. This way, I can provide the fee without having to arrange additional funds. I kindly request your support in discussing this alternative arrangement with the managing director of the POST office. If they agree to this proposal, please let me know so that I can proceed with providing the necessary details for the deduction. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in exploring this alternative solution. I believe it will help resolve the financial challenge I currently face and ensure the completion of the transaction. Looking forward to your response.

Rve Pastor Francis Eze Email #14, from Cameron: Dear Reverend Pastor Francis Eze, Greetings and blessings upon you. Thank you for your continued correspondence and assurance regarding the authenticity of this transaction. It is a great comfort to know that I am dealing with a man of God, whose life is dedicated to serving the Lord and his people. Please understand that my hesitation to send the 185 fee is not out of distrust in your esteemed person or ministry but due to my current financial predicament. It is an awkward position, but I must adhere to a strict budget, and unexpected expenses can cause significant strain. Your proposal asking me to send a power of attorney is quite a serious matter and, indeed, an alternative to consider. However, before taking such a considerable step, I propose a more simplified resolution as mentioned in my previous email. I kindly implore you to consult with the bank and the relevant authorities to see if deducting the 185 fee from the 500,000 compensation amount would be feasible. This would ensure that all the required fees are covered while still honoring the trust and agreement established by the late Mr. Morrison. Aside from this, could you please enlighten me on the process of allocating the compensation to a third party? The notion intrigues me, and I wonder how such a passage would manifest in practical terms. It would also serve to prove the legitimacy and moral foundation upon which this business is being conducted. Nonetheless, your suggestion of providing a Power of Attorney is an option we could reserve as a last resort, and I would need your guidance in obtaining the appropriate legal documents. In conclusion, I want to reiterate that I am eager to proceed with the transaction and receive the blessings so graciously presented before me. Your support and assistance in navigating these final steps would be greatly appreciated. May our paths be guided by His light, and may this transaction be concluded in a manner that honors both His will and the memory of Mr. Morrison. Kindly provide me with more specific information so that we may move forward with wisdom and grace. With the kindest regards, Cameron McCaffrey P.S. In anticipation of moving forward, could you attach a photo or a scanned copy of the international bank draft cheque as a confirmation? It would grant me greater peace of mind and facilitate any necessary preparatory actions on my end. Email #15, from Eze: This will come to you as a surprise because I have not known you no meet with you anywhere in this whole world but I really want to be entrusting a transaction under your care with the whole trust of my life if only you can work with me in truth worthiness and honesty as I know that this world is full of evil.

It's heartwarming to know that he found peace and redemption before his departure. I must convey my sense of overwhelm at the magnitude of trust that you and Mr. Morrison have placed upon me, a mere stranger, in the disbursement of such a significant sum. I assure you, Reverend, that your faith in my trustworthiness and honesty is not misplaced, and I am committed to proceeding with the utmost integrity. That being said, I must admit the request for the International Stamp Duty delivery fee has introduced an unforeseen complication. My financial situation remains unchanged; therefore, the alternative solution of deducting the 185 fee from the total compensation amount is still the most viable option for me.

I understand the trust you embody entails a great deal of responsibility, and I do not take this lightly. Thus, I am prepared to sign the necessary documents and engage in all due processes required.

Let's break down the main points: 1. **Game Start Duration**: The game took approximately 50 seconds to start, which suggests numerous mods or possibly issues with the mods that slow down the game's startup time. 2. **Mismatched Mods**: Your client has mods that the server does not have, and vice versa. This is a common cause for not being able to connect or for experiencing issues when connected. 3. **Server-Side Mod Rejection**: The server has rejected the client-side mods because of mismatches in mod versions or because certain mods are not present on the server. 4. **Ping Timeout**: At one point, the connection timed out when trying to ping a server (\`luachua.ddns.net\`), which could be a network issue or the server was not responding in time. 5. **Disconnection from Server**: Ultimately, the client was disconnected because of mismatched mod lists. To solve these issues: - **Match Mod Versions**: Ensure that the client and server are running the same versions of each mod. Pay close attention to the version numbers indicated in the logs for both sides. - **Remove or Add Mods**: For the mods mentioned as \\"missing on server\\" or \\"additional mods that may be needed on the client,\\" decide if you want to add them to the client or server as appropriate to create a matching set of mods. - **Check Channel Versions**: The error about channels rejecting their server-side version number indicates that the protocol version for communication between client-side mods and server-side mods is incompatible. You may need to update mods on both sides to compatible versions. - **Consider Required Mods**: Some mods listed as \\"might be needed on the client\\" could be dependencies for other mods or could add important gameplay features. Decide if you want them on your client-side mod pack. - **Review Compatibility**: Some mods are specifically made for client-only or server-only environments. Mods like \\"memoryleakfix\\" and \\"memorysettings\\" might be server-side mods that help with server performance, not meant for the client. - **Confirm Presence of Core Mods**: Mods like \\"geckolib\\" are often core libraries required for other mods to function. If such a mod is missing on the server but is required by a mod on the server, it will lead to issues. To proceed, carefully align your client and server mod configurations. If you're unsure about whether a mod should be present on the client, server, or both, consult the mod's documentation or the support community for guidance.

Hiw do they discover other bots if its p2p?","output":"P2P (Peer-to-Peer) botnets operate by using decentralized networks to control bots without a single point of command and control (C&C). In traditional botnets, bots would communicate with a central server to receive instructions, but in a P2P botnet, each bot can act as both a client and a server, enabling resilient and flexible command dissemination. Here's a high-level overview of how P2P botnets generally work: 1. **Infection**: P2P botnets spread malware to infect devices, turning them into bots. These bots then join the network of other infected devices. Infection vectors include phishing attacks, drive-by downloads, exploits, and other malware distribution tactics. 2. **Bootstrap Process**: Initially, newly infected bots need to discover other peers. This is usually done by connecting to a list of seeds or hardcoded rendezvous points included in the malware's code. These seeds are initial peers that the bot communicates with to get a list of active bots already in the network. 3. **Peer Discovery**: Once the bot has a list of peers, it can communicate with them to exchange information, such as lists of other bots, C&C messages, or updates to the malware’s code. The bot may use a peer discovery protocol, where it sends out messages asking for a list of other active peers. Peer discovery can also happen using a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) or similar decentralized data structure that stores peer information. 4. **Maintaining a Peer List**: Each bot maintains a list of peers that it can communicate with. This peer list is regularly updated as bots come online or go offline and can be obtained by querying other bots or exchanging peer lists. 5. **Command Propagation**: Commands are issued by the \\"botmaster\\" and injected into the botnet through any compromised device. These commands propagate throughout the botnet as bots communicate with their peers, receiving and forwarding the instructions. 6. **Resilience**: Due to the decentralized nature, it is difficult to shut down P2P botnets. Taking down a few bots has little to no effect on the overall network, making these types of botnets quite resilient to takedown attempts by security researchers or law enforcement. 7. **Evolution**: Over time, the malware may update itself, adding new features or eliminating vulnerabilities, thus evolving to escape detection and increase its longevity. P2P botnets are highly effective due to their distributed architecture, which makes them resistant to standard countermeasures that focus on disrupting communications with a central C&C server. Instead, to combat P2P botnets, security experts often need to rely on more sophisticated tactics, like infiltrating the botnet to understand its structure and find flaws in its communication protocol, or taking legal action to seize and sinkhole domains used by the botnet."},{"instruction":"Well couldnt someone reverse engineer the commands and then send out their own if they happen to have a malware sample?","output":"In theory, yes, someone with the right skills could reverse-engineer the malware, understand how it operates including the command and control (C&C) communication protocols, and potentially send out their own commands. This process would typically involve: 1. **Obtaining a Sample**: First, you would need to obtain a malware sample from the botnet you want to analyze. 2. **Analysis**: Through reverse engineering, you can analyze the sample to understand how it communicates, what encryption or obfuscation methods it uses, what commands it accepts, and how those commands are structured. 3. **Emulating a Bot**: Using the knowledge gained from reverse engineering, you could potentially create a piece of software that emulates a legitimate bot within the network. This software would need to be capable of speaking the \\"language\\" of the botnet and mimicking the appropriate protocol for peer discovery and communication. 4. **Sending Commands**: Once integrated into the network and recognized as a peer, this emulator could theoretically send commands to other bots. Depending on the botnet’s design, you might need to replicate the authentication mechanisms used by the botmaster to issue valid commands. However, there are several caveats and challenges associated with this approach: - **Encryption and Authentication**: Many sophisticated botnets employ encryption and may require authentication before obeying commands from a peer. The botmaster's commands might be digitally signed using asymmetric cryptography, preventing unauthorized entities from issuing commands that the bots would trust and execute. - **Dynamic Behavior**: Some botnets can change their communication protocols or encryption keys dynamically, meaning that reverse engineering might only provide a snapshot of the botnet's operation, which may quickly become outdated. - **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Intentionally interacting with a botnet, even for seemingly benign purposes, can be illegal and unethical. It can also have unintended consequences, such as causing damage to systems owned by third parties. - **Detection and Evasion**: Botnets are sometimes designed to detect and defend against attempts to subvert or take control of the network. If such an effort is detected, the bot herders might update the botnet to counter the specific threat. Security researchers who undertake such tasks usually do so in a controlled environment and follow a strict code of ethics and legal guidelines. When vulnerabilities are discovered, they are often reported to appropriate authorities or used to assist in legally sanctioned botnet takedown efforts. For example, law enforcement agencies and security companies have teamed up on occasion to seize the infrastructure used by botnets, issue takedown orders, or even take control of the botnet to instruct the bots to cease their malicious activities or uninstall the botnet malware. These high-profile operations are complex and require coordination with global entities to ensure legality and to minimize the risk of collateral damage."},{"instruction":"Couldnt they use a pgp signature to make sure the commands are legit?","output":"Yes, PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) signatures or similar cryptographic signature schemes can indeed be used by botmasters to ensure that the command messages are legitimate and haven't been tampered with. In such a system, each bot would be programmed to verify the PGP signature attached to each command using the botmaster's public key. Here's how this works: 1. **Key Pair**: The botmaster generates a public-private key pair. The private key is kept secret, while the public key is distributed to all the bots, or it is embedded in the malware's code at the time of infection. 2. **Signing Commands**: When the botmaster wants to issue a new command, they create a message and sign it using their private key. This produces a digital signature that is unique to the message and the key used to sign it. 3. **Distribution**: The signed command, along with its signature, is distributed across the botnet. This might be done by injecting it into the P2P network, where it begins to propagate from bot to bot. 4. **Verification**: When a bot receives a command with a signature, it uses the stored public key to verify the signature. The verification process entails checking that the signature matches the command and has been signed with the corresponding private key. 5. **Executing Commands**: Only if the signature is valid will the bot accept and execute the command. If the signature does not verify, it indicates that the message may have been altered or that someone without the correct private key has attempted to create a command, and the bot will disregard the command. Using cryptographic signatures makes it challenging for anyone other than the botmaster to issue commands that bots will trust, as one would need access to the botmaster's private key, which is kept secret. This technique enhances the security and integrity of command messages within the botnet and is one reason why reverse engineering and issuing unauthorized commands to a botnet is non-trivial. For security researchers and law enforcement attempting to take down or disrupt such a botnet, they would either need to recover the private key or find some other vulnerability in the implementation of the signature verification process or the botnet's communication protocol to be able to issue their own commands."},{"instruction":"Couldnt yoj do that in a regular, centralized botnet, meaning you wont have a hardcoded cnc server ip, but instead the bots listen for any command with a valid pgp signature, not just ones from sepcific ips","output":"Yes, the concept of using cryptographic signatures to authenticate commands from a botmaster can be applied to both centralized and decentralized (P2P) botnets. Whether a botnet is centrally controlled or distributed, the core idea remains the same: commands are only considered valid if they have a proper signature that verifies against a known public key. In a centralized botnet structure, bots typically receive commands from specific servers (C&C servers). By integrating cryptographic signatures, bots would not need hardcoded IP addresses of C&C servers; they could instead be programmed to trust commands from any source, as long as those commands have a valid cryptographic signature. The process would be as follows: 1. **Public Key Distribution**: Bots are embedded with the botmaster's public key or have the capacity to retrieve it securely from the network. 2. **Command Signing**: The botmaster signs each command using their private key. 3. **Flexible C&C Communication**: Without hardcoded C&C server IPs, bots could receive commands from less predictable locations, making the botnet's C&C infrastructure more flexible and potentially more resilient to takedown efforts. The botmaster could send commands from a variety of servers, use external services like social media or cloud storage, or even compromise legitimate services to relay commands. 4. **Command Authentication**: Regardless of the command's source or how it's relayed to bots, each infected device would use the embedded public key to verify the authenticity of the command. 5. **Command Execution**: Commands that pass the signature verification process are executed, while those that do not are ignored. The use of cryptographic signatures offers several advantages: - **Increased Agility**: The botmaster is not bound to fixed C&C servers and can easily change the infrastructure without needing to update the bots. - **Resistance to Takedowns**: Since the bots do not depend on hardcoded IP addresses, taking down one or more C&C servers may have a limited impact on the botnet's operation. - **Command Integrity**: Cryptographic signatures ensure that commands have not been altered in transit, providing a strong guarantee of command integrity. However, this method also has some potential downsides: - **Distribution of Public Key**: If the botnet's public key is ever compromised or if there's a need to change it, the botmaster would have to find a way to securely distribute the new public key to all bots without alerting security researchers or law enforcement. - **Increased Complexity**: Implementing and managing cryptographic systems adds complexity to the botnet malware, which could introduce vulnerabilities or make the botnet easier to detect. - **Legal and Ethical Implications**: As previously mentioned, any interaction with a botnet, even for research purposes, could be considered illegal and has ethical ramifications. In practice, many modern botnets combine various techniques to remain resilient and elusive, often including features from both centralized and decentralized architectures. Security researchers looking to combat such botnets need sophisticated tools and methods to track and undermine them."},{"instruction":"Wait you'd still need a hardcoded list of cncs or some sort of dga since the devices ij most cases, assuming they are iot, cannot host their own webservers easily. It could just be a verification that the connection being made isnt to a sinkhole","output":"You're correct that for the botnet to function, there must be some method for the bots to obtain commands from the botmaster, and purely relying on cryptographic signatures doesn't address the initial command retrieval challenge. Here are several methods botnets use to handle command dissemination and ensure bots are connecting to legitimate command sources: 1. **Hardcoded C&C Servers**: Some botnets indeed have a list of hardcoded IP addresses or domain names where the bots initially look for commands. While simple, this approach has the disadvantage of being vulnerable to sinkholing and takedown operations. 2. **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA)**: DGAs are used by botmasters to generate a large number of domain names that the bots can check for updates or commands. The botmaster only has to register one or a few of these domains at any given time. Since the algorithm is known only to the botmaster and the bots, it's difficult for defenders to predict and preemptively register or block these domains. 3. **P2P Networking**: In a decentralized botnet, bots frequently exchange information about active C&C servers or peers, which can help a new bot find current C&C servers upon its initial infection. 4. **Using Third-Party Services**: Bots can receive commands from legitimate third-party services that the botmaster abuses, such as social media platforms, cloud storage services, or even public code repositories. Bots monitor these services for updates using accounts or specific content flagged by agreed-upon markers. 5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Some botnets have fallback mechanisms that are used if the primary C&C communication fails. These can include hardcoded secondary C&C server addresses, alternative DGA implementations, or instructions to search for signals in public data streams. 6. **Cryptographic Verification for Sinkhole Detection**: As you mentioned, a bot might attempt to connect to a list of potential C&C servers, some of which could be legitimate while others could be sinkholes set up by defenders. Cryptographic verification comes into play here—not for finding the C&C server, but rather for confirming that the server the bot is communicating with is indeed controlled by the botmaster. If bots only execute commands that have a valid cryptographic signature, they can avoid executing false commands sent from sinkholed servers or traps set by researchers. 7. **Traffic Analysis Resistance**: Some botnets use techniques to resist traffic analysis, such as \\"domain fronting,\\" which hides the true endpoint of a connection by using different domain names at different layers of communication. By using one or a combination of these methods, botnets can maintain communication between the bots and the botmaster, as well as ensure the integrity and authenticity of the commands being issued, while resisting detection and takedown attempts."},{"instruction":"I think the best would probably be either a decentralized botnet with cryptographic signatures to the commands or a dga that can generate thousnads of domains that also has cryptographic signatures, thousands becouse law enforcement could technically seize your current domain and then buy up all the other ones very cheaply meaning the private key doesnt have to be accurate as the bots cant find a new cnc anyway if all the domains are taken","output":"Indeed, both strategies you've mentioned have been employed by modern botnets to ensure resilience and evade law enforcement takedown efforts. 1. **Decentralized Botnet with Cryptographic Signatures**: Decentralized (P2P) botnets inherently benefit from the lack of a single point of failure, and the addition of cryptographic signatures ensures that even if a bot enters a communication channel, it can't issue commands to other bots without the appropriate cryptographic signature. The decentralized nature also means that taking down any single or even multiple bots does little to disrupt the overall botnet, as bots can continue to communicate with each other and coordinate actions without a central C&C server. 2. **DGA with Thousands of Domains and Cryptographic Signatures**: A Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) botnet that can produce thousands of potential domain names makes it difficult for law enforcement or security researchers to predict and pre-emptively register or seize all of them. With a sufficiently complex DGA and the financial costs, it's generally not feasible for defenders to take over every possible domain. Combining this with cryptographic signatures for command authenticity makes the botnet more robust—the bots will check the signature before executing commands, ensuring they are only following the botmaster's orders. However, it's important to remember that no botnet is invulnerable. Each of these mechanisms comes with its own set of vulnerabilities and challenges: - **Decentralized Botnets**: Communication among bots might expose patterns that can be exploited by researchers. Additionally, the initial seeding of the botnet and the potential need for bots to update the list of peers they connect with present moments where security measures might intervene. - **Domain Generation Algorithms**: DGAs can be reverse-engineered, which then allows defenders to predict domain names and take them down or register them. It is a cat-and-mouse game where the botnet operators need to continuously evolve their algorithms to stay ahead of the researchers. - **Cryptographic Signatures**: If a private key is ever compromised or if there is a flaw in the implementation of the cryptographic protocol, the botnet's integrity can be severely undermined. Furthermore, using cryptographic signatures may make the botnet's traffic more identifiable, potentially leading to easier detection. Ultimately, while these advanced techniques make botnets more resistant to takedown and provide a high level of control security for botmasters, they also increase the technical sophistication and complexity required to develop and maintain the botnet. This can introduce new vulnerabilities or make the botnet activities more noticeable to the cybersecurity community. It's also worth noting that law enforcement and cybersecurity researchers have various countermeasures and tools for combating botnets, such as legal action to seize domains, sinkholing, honeypots, and advanced malware analysis. As botnet operators innovate, so too do the tactics of those working to stop them, creating a never-ending cycle of advancement and counteraction in the realm of cybersecurity."},{"instruction":"Have law enforcement ever taken down malware by buying up all the domains their dga generates?","output":"Yes, law enforcement agencies have utilized a technique known as \\"sinkholing\\" to disrupt or takedown malware by buying up all the domains generated by the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) used by the malware. Sinkholing involves redirecting the traffic from infected botnets to servers controlled by law enforcement or cybersecurity professionals. In some cases, law enforcement agencies or security researchers have identified the domains that would be generated by the malware's DGA algorithm and proactively registered them. This prevents the malware from contacting its command-and-control infrastructure, thus rendering it ineffective. Sinkholing has been used effectively to disrupt various botnets, such as GameOver ZeuS, CryptoLocker, Emotet, and others. However, this method is not a permanent solution as malware authors can modify their DGAs or switch to other communication methods. It also requires expertise, resources, and cooperation between various stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, security researchers, and domain registrars."},{"instruction":"How can they modify the dga on old bots though? They cannot as all the domains are gone already.","output":"You are correct. Once law enforcement takes down all the domains generated by a DGA, it becomes challenging for the malware operators to modify the DGA on already infected bots. This effectively cuts off communication between the malware-infected system and its command-and-control infrastructure. However, it's important to note that sinkholing primarily disrupts the existing infrastructure and prevents further infections from reaching the command-and-control servers. It does not fully eliminate the malware from already infected machines. These machines may still remain compromised and need further remediation. In some cases, law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity professionals work with affected individuals and organizations to identify and clean up infected machines. This process usually involves removing the malware from the compromised systems, applying security patches, and implementing other security measures to ensure the system is secure. While sinkholing can have a significant impact on a botnet's operation, it is a temporary disruption. Malware authors may potentially develop new versions of the malware or implement new communication methods to regain control over infected systems. Therefore, it is crucial to combine sinkholing efforts with ongoing cybersecurity measures and user awareness to effectively combat malware threats."},{"instruction":"","output":"Thinking about love can bring about a range of emotions, including joy, excitement, contentment, and happiness.

The initial settings were intended to be adjusted to “Fine,” but due to an accidental bump, the dial was inadvertently turned to “Very Fine.” The machine was activated, resulting in an unanticipated change in the settings. Output: Upon activation, SCP-914 emitted a faint hum and the gears started to turn. However, instead of a smooth transition, the gears hesitated and appeared to strain under the pressure of the “Very Fine” setting. Unusual fluctuations in the machine’s sounds were noted, indicating an irregular process. The gears eventually stabilized, and SCP-914 emitted a mix of metallic clicks and a high-pitched whirring noise when the transformation concluded. The transformed output appeared strikingly different from the initial refined portrait. The following description details the observed alterations: 1. Dimensions: The transformed portrait","output":"exhibited a slight enlargement, with the previously standard 8x10 inch dimensions increasing to approximately 12x15 inches. The increase in size was uniform and did not result in any distortions or stretching of the image. 2. Detail: The level of detail in the transformed portrait was vastly enhanced compared to the original refined portrait. Every brushstroke and fine line was now intricately defined, creating a hyperrealistic quality to the image. Even the smallest features such as pores, individual strands of hair, and minute wrinkles were visible, providing an unprecedented level of realism. 3.

Three non-living objects were created, resembling SCP-058 in appearance and behavior. These objects were intended to model SCP-058 accurately, allowing for controlled observations of the potential effects of the transformed portrait. The objects were placed into SCP-914's intake booth, and the machine was set to the \\"Very Fine\\" setting. Test Object 1: Resemblance Sculpture - Exhibits the same proportions, physical features, and pose as SCP-058. Results: Upon transformation, the sculpture displayed increased detail, color saturation, and altered expression, similar to the transformed portrait. It also exhibited a heightened sense of realism, with textures and depth resembling that of the portrait. As observed during visual inspections, the sculpture evoked emotional responses in observers, including heightened empathy and unease. Test Object 2: Animated Resemblance Doll - Possesses a rudimentary motor system to mimic minimal movements akin to SCP-058. Results: The transformed doll exhibited similar enhancements in detail, color saturation, and altered expression as the previous objects. Notably, the doll's animated movements became smoother and more fluid, adding to the realistic appearance. It provided observers with the impression of a living entity in motion, causing both fascination and discomfort for some viewers. Test Object 3: Resemblance 2D Drawing - An artistic representation of SCP-058 featuring similar style, dimensions, and pose. Results: The transformed drawing displayed comparable effects to the previous objects, with heightened detail, color saturation, and altered expression. Similar to the transformed portrait, the drawing exhibited depth and textures, appearing as a tangible representation rather than a flat image. Viewers experienced a stronger emotional response, reporting feelings of sadness, awe, and unease. Notes: The experiments conducted using the non-living objects indicate that the transformed portrait's effects are not limited to the specific canvas but extend to visually resembling representations of SCP-058 as well. The enhanced realism, altered expression, and heightened emotions reported during the tests suggest that these effects might be inherent to SCP-058 itself rather than an anomalous property of the portrait alone. Remarks: SCP-058's recommendations resulted in successful experiments, providing additional insights into the potential effects of the transformed portrait. The test results align with SCP-058's initial concerns, indicating that exposure to visually accurate representations can elicit emotional and psychological responses similar to those observed with the transformed portrait.

В этой системе наблюдается передача силы: магнит действует силой на стену через магнитное поле, а стена через магнит удерживает груз. В идеальной ситуации, при отсутствии дополнительных сил (например, ветра), движения или вибрации, вес прикреплённого груза будет полностью компенсирован усилием магнитного притяжения. Следовательно, вся нагрузка от груза действительно передаётся на стену через магнит. Это нагрузка будет равнозначной весу груза, действующему в направлении центра Земли (вниз), и должна быть компенсирована силой притяжения магнитом в противоположном направлении (вверх). Результатом этого является то, что стена испытывает равную по величине и противоположную по направлению силу, равную весу подушки. Однако стоит учитывать некоторые практические моменты: 1. Сила сцепления магнита со стеной должна быть достаточной для удержания груза весом в 5 кг. Если магнит слабее, то он не сможет удержать груз, и он упадёт. 2. Магнитное поле должно быть распределено равномерно по поверхности стены, чтобы избежать скольжения или перекоса магнита под весом груза. 3. Со временем магнитное удержание может ослабеть из-за ряда факторов, таких как повреждение магнита, коррозия железной стены или механическое воздействие. Это необходимо учитывать при длительном использовании магнитного крепления. Итак, да, при правильном подборе магнита его притяжение будет достаточно для удержания на стене груза весом в 5 кг, и вся нагрузка от этого груза будет передана на железную стену."},{"instruction":"Не много не понял.

Магниты просто преобразуют вертикальную нагрузку от гравитации на горизонтальную удерживающую силу со стороны машины. Но с точки зрения общего веса системы (в данном случае машины с подушками), вес подушек полностью учитывается. Таким образом, при расчете общего веса машины для, например, определения нагрузки на оси или при прохождении через весы, вам нужно будет учитывать массу всех прикрепленных к машине объектов, включая подушки. Факт использования магнитов для крепления подушек не меняет их массу и не влияет на общую массу.

Это поможет предотвратить перекос или перевес автомобиля на одну сторону. 2. **Балансировка противовесом:** Если возможно, попробуйте установить противовес на противоположной стороне УАЗ \\"Буханки\\" для балансировки веса.

К сожалению, вы не можете волшебным образом уменьшить фактический вес подушек, но путем правильного распределения и балансировки можете минимизировать отрицательные последствия добавления такого количества подушек на автомобиль.

So I want to establish some ground reality, some foundations for us. The first thing I want to do is I want to define Bollywood. Since this is a citizenship GE, I want to define citizenship. Within citizenship, I want to set parameters of boundaries, cultural identities and what both of these mean for citizenship. And the last thing I want to do is draw connections between Bollywood and citizenship. So let's start at the top. What is Bollywood? Bollywood is Hindi language cinema. India has a lot of cinema and India has a lot of languages. India is a very diverse country. There are about, there are more than 20 languages in the constitution that are recognized as scheduled languages, which means that these are languages you can do business in. You can fill a bank form in these languages, not all of them across India but they are kind of regional, right. So for example, in the western state of Gujarat, you could open a bank account in Gujarati or in English. English kind of functions as the \\"lingua franca,\\" meaning the language of business. But there are a lot of regional languages. There's also a lot of regional language cinema. So it's not as if Bollywood is the only cinema coming out of India. Bollywood is just Hindi language cinema. It's really important to know that. And Bollywood is an industry that has kind of been in business for more than a century now. So its a lot of cinema that is coming out of Bollywood. And our goal here is to kind of understand that cinema and not just understand that cinema but also understand how that interacts with other things like citizenship. But before we get into citizenship, another thing about Bollywood is it is its own thing, right? It's its own animal. It is not as if is like any other type of cinema in the world. Of course it borrows from other types of cinema. Of course there is- not only borrows, it actually also very liberally copies from other cinema in the world. For example, I cannot name the number of Hindi movies that are almost exact copies of Hollywood movies. Some movies that come to mind are there's a there is a Hindi version of Harry met Sally, there is a Hindi version of Forrest Gump, which is actually a more recent version, but lots of things like that. There's a Hindi version of ghost, etc. So actually there's a Hindi version, I think of Ghostbusters. So it's really interesting to see. It's not as if cinema is not tied to each other, but Bollywood, Bollywood is its own entity and it's Hindi language cinema, important to note that. I also will say in your assignments, when you're doing the writing, it's important that you know that you know the distinction between Hindi, Hindi, which is the language with with about 400 million native speakers and Hindu, which is a human being, a person who follows the religion called Hinduism, right. So Hindu is not a language. Hindu is a person who follows a particular religion. Hindi is a language with about 400 million speakers, native speakers, which means lots of people speak it as a second language too. So, that is Bollywood, like just a very broad definition of Bollywood. Now let's get to citizenship. What is citizenship? What does it mean to be a citizen? And what does it mean to kind of have citizenship? Here what I want to do is I want to reflect on the ways in which we talk about being a citizen. So think about it this way. When we are talking about citizenship, what are we actually talking about? Are we talking about borders, for example, in modern civilizations- in the modern world, not even civilizations, in the modern world, when we fly, if you have an American passport, you actually do not need a visa to most countries in the world. You need a visa to some countries. You actually do need a visa to go to India, but you don't need a visa to go to France, Germany, England, Canada, Mexico. Actually Canada and Mexico recently you need a passport. You don't need a visa. You don't need the government of Mexico or Canada to say, yeah, you can come, it's OK, right? But you need that for But if you are an Indian citizen, you need a visa for the UK. You need it for France, you need it for Germany. You need it for Switzerland. You need it for most of the world. You don't need it for Nepal. What does that mean? Are we saying in some way that being a citizen is about being a citizen of the United States? Or being a citizen of India is about where you can move? As in, not move with all your bags and all your family, but move? As in, can I go to a vacation on a whim if I'm Indian to Switzerland? Not really. But can I go to a vacation to Switzerland as a U.S. citizen on a whim? Like, can I fly out on Saturday? Any given Saturday? Yeah, right. So what does that mean? It means something, right? Beyond that, what else does citizenship mean? In general, citizenship is understood as a rather modern concept. We were not talking as citizens of a nation, of a nation state about like 200 years ago or so. We kind of were, but really not, no. This is a far more recent idea, and this is a far more recent idea because we are now talking about the contract that that an individual has with the state, right? So that contract actually for a U.S. citizen, what it means to be What it means to have a contract with the US government. Part of that meaning is that you can travel to a lot of countries without a visa, as a tourist visa. That is, you cannot work in these countries, but you can travel. For an Indian citizen however, it does not have the same meaning. So we are saying here a little bit, is that the idea of citizenship is a little bit about movement. Who can go where, right? It is not about who can settle where, but it is definitely about who can go where. But there are other things, right? So for example, how does one get citizenship in the United States? You are either born or you're naturalized. As in you gain citizenship somehow. There are various ways of doing it. But becoming a citizen of the United States as becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States is a hard thing. But reflect on this What does it mean to be a naturalized citizen of the United States? And what does it mean to be a citizen of the United States? Beyond that, though, what does it mean to be a citizen. Right. What are the ways in which the US government or the Indian government interact with the individual? What are my rights as a citizen of the United States? Or what are my rights as a citizen of India? And it's not just that. It is also what can I do and what I also cannot do, Right? That's also about citizenship, because it is very possible that as a citizen of India, I can do certain things in India that I cannot do in the United States, and vice versa. So in some ways, citizenship is about rights. What do I have a right to do? Where do I have a right to travel? Where do I have a right to vote? Who has a right to vote? Actually, if you reflect on it historically, who has a right to vote is a big thing about citizenship, right. Who is actually a full citizen? Till the 19th Amendment in the United States, women did not have a right to vote. Therefore, were they full citizens? Right. So we think about all of these things when we think about citizenship. But this is not a citizenship class, right? Although it is. How does Bollywood relate to citizenship? What is the relationship between film and citizenship? Let's reflect on that a little bit. Let us think about what these are. So in the next lecture we will talk a little bit more about culture and what it means to be from a culture etc. But for now, let us think about what citizenship means for cultural identities. So a little bit ago I said that Bollywood is the film industry that is represented by one language in India? If Bollywood is just Bollywood is just Hindi language cinema, what about cultural identities of people who do not speak Hindi, right? So for example, again, so many languages in India and so many dialects. So how does language relate to cultural identity? And more importantly, how do people who have different cultural identities? So for example, a speaker of Hindi, a speaker of Bangla, a speaker of Telugu, a speaker of Tamil, All Indian languages, do they have the same rights as citizens of the country? Right? So the constitution says absolutely everyone is equal. But we all know the US Constitution says that too, right? These are modern democracies. We are built on the idea that everyone is equal and created equal and has equal rights. But when we look around us, is that true? I'm asking an open-ended question. I hope you reflect on that. But the real answer, but a very simple answer is it's really not, right? So is a person. Does does everyone have actually equal rights? I don't know, but I don't think so. I don't think you think so too. And if you do, please come talk to me. Let's talk. It'll be fun. So what is the relationship then between these different cultural identities and citizenship? And we go one step beyond and let's try to figure out what is the difference between, what is the relationship between all these different cultural identities, citizenship and film, right. And in the case of India, we are just talking about Bollywood film. So the way I think about this relationship, the way I think about Bollywood as related to citizenship, is Bollywood represents a particular idea of who is a good citizen. This idea has changed historically based on how cultural identities have changed and our idea of ideal cultural identities, who is the best possible? What is the best possible way to be a man? What is the best possible way to be a woman? What is the best possible way to be an Indian? In a lot of ways, Bollywood kind of shows a way to do that in really questionable ways, right? So the class is going to be very much about how Bollywood does this highly questionable representation of what a good citizen is supposed to be and a good citizen is supposed to do how this has changed over decades. So the first film we watch is actually going to be from the 1990s, but we are going to watch films from 1960s, seventies, 80s, nineties and more contemporary film. And we will see how this idea of who is a, who is a good citizen, who is a Good man, who is a good woman, is someone who doesn't identify as male or female actually able to be a good citizen, right. So what happens to queer identities? What happens to gender identities that are not conforming to these idealized male, female boxes? We learn about all of that. And all of that is related to citizenship. All of that within Bollywood is related to citizenship. Because Bollywood is basically saying, hey, if you want to be a good Indian, behave this way, right? And if you don't do it, well, then you are not the best of Indians. Being an Indian is categorically about being a citizen. What else could it be about? Right. So. So we kind of will see these connections. What I've tried to do here is give you snippets of what these connections are. The picture is obviously far more complicated. In a lot of ways, this class is going to be a not representative of all of Bollywood. There is no way for us to do that in 15 weeks. In fact, one of the problems of being representative is I am teaching this class. I am coming in with a particular view of the world. And you know, I grew up in India. I came here 20 years ago. I actually do happen to be a citizen of the United States now. But I do go back to India as on a what is called an Overseas Citizen of India card, right. So I carry a card with me that allows me entering into India. Interesting things about citizenship, right? And then those are really practical things about citizenship but beyond that things get really murky and actually genuinely beautiful for someone like me who likes to kind of study and think about the human experience. So coming back to like cinema when we when we look at all of these things and we kind of see how this is represented in film. There are certain examples, of course, that I have picked and every film that I have picked is kind of an example of something big that I'm trying to say. But can you find a film? Can you, if you grew up with Bollywood or have friends who grew up with Bollywood, can you come to my office hours and be like, hey, professor, I saw this film that completely, you know, denies what you taught me last week and I'll be like, yay, great, Let me talk about that film next week. Right. So this is not a, hey, take my word for everything, but take my word enough. And definitely take the word of the people you are reading enough to understand that those are examples of certain things that form connections between Bollywood citizenship, cultural identities, boundaries. Right, film in India, Bollywood film is essentially a boundary keeping exercise. Boundary keeping exercise meaning this is the limitations within which ideal males perform. If you're outside these limitations, no good. And the same can be said about a lot of things, right. So, we kind of will try to form those connections. Another thing I should say here is nationalism. We will kind of talk about this word as we go on in the course and as we talk about different films in the course and different readings in the course as well. How do nationalism and citizenship interact with each other? Citizenship is a contract between the state and the individual. What can I do? What can I not do? What am I allowed to do? What am I not allowed to do? I'm a citizen, citizen of a democracy, therefore I'm able to question those things. But beyond the questioning, I kind of have to follow what I'm told, more or less. What is nationalism? Nationalism is a particular view, a particular way in which somebody's saying this is how you should be a citizen, right? And if you are not, then you are a bad citizen and bad citizen is not allowed. It's not OK, right. So nationalism is more complicated and nationalism is definitely something that Hindi language cinema, that Bollywood cinema has done a lot of. In fact it is getting as an observer, it is getting kind of more and more interesting as more and more nationalistic dialogue is coming into Bollywood film, but even without, even when it was not so prominent, so loud, nationalism is a very deeply tied part of Bollywood film. of what Bollywood is trying to do, what Bollywood is trying to say, what type of a citizenship, what type of a citizen one is allowed to be. So we'll look at all of these wonderful things through film, and I'm really excited about it.","output":"In this lecture, Dr. Ila Nagar discusses the definition of Bollywood and citizenship. She explains that Bollywood refers to Hindi language cinema in India, which is a diverse country with multiple languages and regional language cinemas. She also mentions that Bollywood is its own entity and often borrows or copies from other types of cinema, such as Hollywood. Moving on to citizenship, Dr. Nagar reflects on the ways in which citizenship is understood, particularly in terms of borders and movement. She mentions how citizens of different countries have different visa requirements when traveling, and how citizenship also encompasses rights and responsibilities. She highlights that citizenship is a relatively modern concept and is often associated with the contract between individuals and the state. Dr. Nagar then explores the relationship between Bollywood and citizenship. She argues that Bollywood represents a particular idea of who is a good citizen and that this idea has changed over time. Bollywood portrays ideals of cultural identities, such as what it means to be a good man or woman, and often excludes queer identities or gender identities that do not conform to societal norms. She also emphasizes that citizenship is about rights and limitations, and that who has the right to vote is a significant aspect of citizenship. Furthermore, Dr. Nagar discusses the relationship between cultural identities, citizenship, and film. She asks questions about equal rights and the representation of different cultural identities in Bollywood. She suggests that Bollywood shapes and influences the concept of citizenship by promoting certain behaviors and ideals. She also mentions that nationalism plays a role in Bollywood, as it dictates certain views on citizenship and what it means to be a good citizen. Dr. Nagar concludes by highlighting the complexity of these topics and the limitations of the course in capturing the entirety of Bollywood. She encourages students to engage critically with the material and to share their own perspectives or examples that challenge the ideas discussed. She also mentions that nationalism will be further explored in relation to citizenship throughout the course."},{"instruction":"Here is the lecture: Page 6 of 8 Week 1, Lecture 1 Video Transcript (Defining Bollywood, Defining Citizenship) [Dr. Ila Nagar] This is the first lecture of our class. So I want to establish some ground reality, some foundations for us. The first thing I want to do is I want to define Bollywood. Since this is a citizenship GE, I want to define citizenship. Within citizenship, I want to set parameters of boundaries, cultural identities and what both of these mean for citizenship. And the last thing I want to do is draw connections between Bollywood and citizenship. So let's start at the top. What is Bollywood? Bollywood is Hindi language cinema. India has a lot of cinema and India has a lot of languages. India is a very diverse country. There are about, there are more than 20 languages in the constitution that are recognized as scheduled languages, which means that these are languages you can do business in. You can fill a bank form in these languages, not all of them across India but they are kind of regional, right. So for example, in the western state of Gujarat, you could open a bank account in Gujarati or in English. English kind of functions as the \\"lingua franca,\\" meaning the language of business. But there are a lot of regional languages. There's also a lot of regional language cinema. So it's not as if Bollywood is the only cinema coming out of India. Bollywood is just Hindi language cinema. It's really important to know that. And Bollywood is an industry that has kind of been in business for more than a century now. So its a lot of cinema that is coming out of Bollywood. And our goal here is to kind of understand that cinema and not just understand that cinema but also understand how that interacts with other things like citizenship. But before we get into citizenship, another thing about Bollywood is it is its own thing, right? It's its own animal. It is not as if is like any other type of cinema in the world. Of course it borrows from other types of cinema. Of course there is- not only borrows, it actually also very liberally copies from other cinema in the world. For example, I cannot name the number of Hindi movies that are almost exact copies of Hollywood movies. Some movies that come to mind are there's a there is a Hindi version of Harry met Sally, there is a Hindi version of Forrest Gump, which is actually a more recent version, but lots of things like that. There's a Hindi version of ghost, etc. So actually there's a Hindi version, I think of Ghostbusters. So it's really interesting to see. It's not as if cinema is not tied to each other, but Bollywood, Bollywood is its own entity and it's Hindi language cinema, important to note that. I also will say in your assignments, when you're doing the writing, it's important that you know that you know the distinction between Hindi, Hindi, which is the language with with about 400 million native speakers and Hindu, which is a human being, a person who follows the religion called Hinduism, right. So Hindu is not a language. Hindu is a person who follows a particular religion. Hindi is a language with about 400 million speakers, native speakers, which means lots of people speak it as a second language too. So, that is Bollywood, like just a very broad definition of Bollywood. Now let's get to citizenship. What is citizenship? What does it mean to be a citizen? And what does it mean to kind of have citizenship? Here what I want to do is I want to reflect on the ways in which we talk about being a citizen. So think about it this way. When we are talking about citizenship, what are we actually talking about? Are we talking about borders, for example, in modern civilizations- in the modern world, not even civilizations, in the modern world, when we fly, if you have an American passport, you actually do not need a visa to most countries in the world. You need a visa to some countries. You actually do need a visa to go to India, but you don't need a visa to go to France, Germany, England, Canada, Mexico. Actually Canada and Mexico recently you need a passport. You don't need a visa. You don't need the government of Mexico or Canada to say, yeah, you can come, it's OK, right? But you need that for But if you are an Indian citizen, you need a visa for the UK. You need it for France, you need it for Germany. You need it for Switzerland. You need it for most of the world. You don't need it for Nepal. What does that mean? Are we saying in some way that being a citizen is about being a citizen of the United States? Or being a citizen of India is about where you can move? As in, not move with all your bags and all your family, but move? As in, can I go to a vacation on a whim if I'm Indian to Switzerland? Not really. But can I go to a vacation to Switzerland as a U.S. citizen on a whim? Like, can I fly out on Saturday? Any given Saturday? Yeah, right. So what does that mean? It means something, right? Beyond that, what else does citizenship mean? In general, citizenship is understood as a rather modern concept. We were not talking as citizens of a nation, of a nation state about like 200 years ago or so. We kind of were, but really not, no. This is a far more recent idea, and this is a far more recent idea because we are now talking about the contract that that an individual has with the state, right? So that contract actually for a U.S. citizen, what it means to be What it means to have a contract with the US government. Part of that meaning is that you can travel to a lot of countries without a visa, as a tourist visa. That is, you cannot work in these countries, but you can travel. For an Indian citizen however, it does not have the same meaning. So we are saying here a little bit, is that the idea of citizenship is a little bit about movement. Who can go where, right? It is not about who can settle where, but it is definitely about who can go where. But there are other things, right? So for example, how does one get citizenship in the United States? You are either born or you're naturalized. As in you gain citizenship somehow. There are various ways of doing it. But becoming a citizen of the United States as becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States is a hard thing. But reflect on this What does it mean to be a naturalized citizen of the United States? And what does it mean to be a citizen of the United States? Beyond that, though, what does it mean to be a citizen. Right. What are the ways in which the US government or the Indian government interact with the individual? What are my rights as a citizen of the United States? Or what are my rights as a citizen of India? And it's not just that. It is also what can I do and what I also cannot do, Right? That's also about citizenship, because it is very possible that as a citizen of India, I can do certain things in India that I cannot do in the United States, and vice versa. So in some ways, citizenship is about rights. What do I have a right to do? Where do I have a right to travel? Where do I have a right to vote? Who has a right to vote? Actually, if you reflect on it historically, who has a right to vote is a big thing about citizenship, right. Who is actually a full citizen? Till the 19th Amendment in the United States, women did not have a right to vote. Therefore, were they full citizens? Right. So we think about all of these things when we think about citizenship. But this is not a citizenship class, right? Although it is. How does Bollywood relate to citizenship? What is the relationship between film and citizenship? Let's reflect on that a little bit. Let us think about what these are. So in the next lecture we will talk a little bit more about culture and what it means to be from a culture etc. But for now, let us think about what citizenship means for cultural identities. So a little bit ago I said that Bollywood is the film industry that is represented by one language in India? If Bollywood is just Bollywood is just Hindi language cinema, what about cultural identities of people who do not speak Hindi, right? So for example, again, so many languages in India and so many dialects. So how does language relate to cultural identity? And more importantly, how do people who have different cultural identities? So for example, a speaker of Hindi, a speaker of Bangla, a speaker of Telugu, a speaker of Tamil, All Indian languages, do they have the same rights as citizens of the country? Right? So the constitution says absolutely everyone is equal. But we all know the US Constitution says that too, right? These are modern democracies. We are built on the idea that everyone is equal and created equal and has equal rights. But when we look around us, is that true? I'm asking an open-ended question. I hope you reflect on that. But the real answer, but a very simple answer is it's really not, right? So is a person. Does does everyone have actually equal rights? I don't know, but I don't think so. I don't think you think so too. And if you do, please come talk to me. Let's talk. It'll be fun. So what is the relationship then between these different cultural identities and citizenship? And we go one step beyond and let's try to figure out what is the difference between, what is the relationship between all these different cultural identities, citizenship and film, right. And in the case of India, we are just talking about Bollywood film. So the way I think about this relationship, the way I think about Bollywood as related to citizenship, is Bollywood represents a particular idea of who is a good citizen. This idea has changed historically based on how cultural identities have changed and our idea of ideal cultural identities, who is the best possible? What is the best possible way to be a man? What is the best possible way to be a woman? What is the best possible way to be an Indian? In a lot of ways, Bollywood kind of shows a way to do that in really questionable ways, right? So the class is going to be very much about how Bollywood does this highly questionable representation of what a good citizen is supposed to be and a good citizen is supposed to do how this has changed over decades. So the first film we watch is actually going to be from the 1990s, but we are going to watch films from 1960s, seventies, 80s, nineties and more contemporary film. And we will see how this idea of who is a, who is a good citizen, who is a Good man, who is a good woman, is someone who doesn't identify as male or female actually able to be a good citizen, right. So what happens to queer identities? What happens to gender identities that are not conforming to these idealized male, female boxes? We learn about all of that. And all of that is related to citizenship. All of that within Bollywood is related to citizenship. Because Bollywood is basically saying, hey, if you want to be a good Indian, behave this way, right? And if you don't do it, well, then you are not the best of Indians. Being an Indian is categorically about being a citizen. What else could it be about? Right. So. So we kind of will see these connections. What I've tried to do here is give you snippets of what these connections are. The picture is obviously far more complicated. In a lot of ways, this class is going to be a not representative of all of Bollywood. There is no way for us to do that in 15 weeks. In fact, one of the problems of being representative is I am teaching this class. I am coming in with a particular view of the world. And you know, I grew up in India. I came here 20 years ago. I actually do happen to be a citizen of the United States now. But I do go back to India as on a what is called an Overseas Citizen of India card, right. So I carry a card with me that allows me entering into India. Interesting things about citizenship, right? And then those are really practical things about citizenship but beyond that things get really murky and actually genuinely beautiful for someone like me who likes to kind of study and think about the human experience. So coming back to like cinema when we when we look at all of these things and we kind of see how this is represented in film. There are certain examples, of course, that I have picked and every film that I have picked is kind of an example of something big that I'm trying to say. But can you find a film? Can you, if you grew up with Bollywood or have friends who grew up with Bollywood, can you come to my office hours and be like, hey, professor, I saw this film that completely, you know, denies what you taught me last week and I'll be like, yay, great, Let me talk about that film next week. Right. So this is not a, hey, take my word for everything, but take my word enough. And definitely take the word of the people you are reading enough to understand that those are examples of certain things that form connections between Bollywood citizenship, cultural identities, boundaries. Right, film in India, Bollywood film is essentially a boundary keeping exercise. Boundary keeping exercise meaning this is the limitations within which ideal males perform. If you're outside these limitations, no good. And the same can be said about a lot of things, right. So, we kind of will try to form those connections. Another thing I should say here is nationalism. We will kind of talk about this word as we go on in the course and as we talk about different films in the course and different readings in the course as well. How do nationalism and citizenship interact with each other? Citizenship is a contract between the state and the individual. What can I do? What can I not do? What am I allowed to do? What am I not allowed to do? I'm a citizen, citizen of a democracy, therefore I'm able to question those things. But beyond the questioning, I kind of have to follow what I'm told, more or less. What is nationalism? Nationalism is a particular view, a particular way in which somebody's saying this is how you should be a citizen, right? And if you are not, then you are a bad citizen and bad citizen is not allowed. It's not OK, right. So nationalism is more complicated and nationalism is definitely something that Hindi language cinema, that Bollywood cinema has done a lot of. In fact it is getting as an observer, it is getting kind of more and more interesting as more and more nationalistic dialogue is coming into Bollywood film, but even without, even when it was not so prominent, so loud, nationalism is a very deeply tied part of Bollywood film. of what Bollywood is trying to do, what Bollywood is trying to say, what type of a citizenship, what type of a citizen one is allowed to be. So we'll look at all of these wonderful things through film, and I'm really excited about it. In response, answer the following question knowing the context of the lecture: What does Bollywood mean to you? Why are you taking this class?","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or intentions, so I don't have a unique perspective on what Bollywood means. However, based on the lecture, Bollywood is defined as the Hindi language cinema industry in India. It is seen as its own entity and has been in business for over a century. It is a representation of cultural identities, including the idea of what it means to be a good citizen in India. Bollywood films depict certain ideals and behaviors that are considered desirable and often reflect the cultural and societal expectations of the time. As for why someone would take this class, it could be to gain a deeper understanding of Bollywood as a cultural phenomenon, its relationship with citizenship and cultural identities, and how it has evolved over time. By studying Bollywood films, one can explore various themes and representations, including gender roles, national identity, and the influence of global cinema on Bollywood."},{"instruction":"rewrite: Do you mean this one you are not clear?

[SCP-058 nods and offers a notepad and pen.] Dr. ██████: Thank you. Let’s begin. The tests revealed that the non-living objects, when transformed, exhibited similar enhancements and effects as the transformed portrait. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding these findings? [SCP-058 takes the pen and paper and begins writing.] SCP-058 (in handwriting): Thank you for conducting the experiments. The results align with my expectations. It appears that the effects are associated with my own existence and presence rather than being confined solely to the transformed portrait. I feel a combination of intrigue, responsibility, and concern knowing that my own likeness can elicit such reactions. Dr. ██████: Your hunch is correct. The enhanced realism, altered expression, and heightened emotions observed in the transformed objects suggest a connection between you and the effects. However, it is still unclear why you are not causing these effects directly. Do you have any theories or insights into what might be causing this? [SCP-058 pauses momentarily, reflecting, and then continues writing.] SCP-058 (in handwriting): I believe the transformed portrait and objects act as amplifiers of my inherent nature rather than directly causing the effects themselves. It may be related to my unique anomalous properties or the energy I emit. The process of artistic representation might somehow further enhance and channel those aspects, intensifying the observed reactions in individuals interacting with these representations. Dr. ██████: Your analysis aligns with our current understanding. By utilizing objects and artistic representations, we might be channeling and amplifying your inherent effects. This amplification could be related to the connection between the visual representation and an individual’s perception, triggering emotional and psychological responses at a heightened capacity. SCP-058 (emotes concern and gestures to the notepad): Is this research likely to uncover the exact cause and mechanisms behind these effects, or will it be an ongoing effort? Dr. ██████: While these experiments have provided valuable insights, the exact cause and mechanisms underlying the effects require further investigation. Our research will be ongoing, with the goal of understanding the anomalies associated with your existence and safeguarding your well-being. It is a complex task, but we are committed to advancing our knowledge in this area. SCP-058 (nods, expressing appreciation): Thank you for your dedication. I appreciate your efforts to understand and ensure my safety. If there is anything else you would like to discuss or any further experiments you deem necessary, please inform me. Dr. ██████: Your collaboration and understanding are greatly appreciated, SCP-058. As research progresses, we may need your input and cooperation in future experiments.

Today, we'll be discussing the recent interview and tests conducted with SCP-058. The purpose is to brainstorm and establish a plan for further testing to gain a deeper understanding of SCP-058's nature and capabilities. Agent █████: We've seen some interesting results from the recent tests, particularly regarding the transformed objects resembling SCP-058. It appears that the effects observed in the transformed portrait are not limited to just that artwork but can be replicated in other objects as well. Dr. ███: Yes, that's correct. The enhanced realism, altered expression, and heightened emotions found in these transformed objects indicate a strong connection to SCP-058. It seems that SCP-058's anomalous properties are somehow being amplified and channeled through these representations. Dr. ██████: Agreed. Our initial hypothesis is that the visual representations serve as conduits, heightening SCP-058's effects on individuals who interact with them. To further test this theory, I propose conducting experiments with different mediums and artistic styles. This will help us determine if certain factors, such as specific materials or art forms, have a greater influence on SCP-058's manifestations. Agent ████: That sounds like an effective approach. We should also consider testing different scales of the transformed objects. SCP-058's portrait is quite large, so it's worth exploring whether the size of the representation influences the intensity or extent of the effects experienced by observers. Dr. ███: Additionally, we should observe the duration of the effects on individuals who have interacted with SCP-058 or the transformed objects. This could provide insight into whether the effects are temporary or have a more long-lasting impact. Dr. ██████: Excellent suggestions. It's crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the breadth and depth of SCP-058's influence. We shouldn't limit ourselves to just visual representations either. Given SCP-058's unique properties, we might explore the possibility of utilizing different sensory mediums to channel its effects. Agent █████: Agreed. We can investigate auditory mediums or even explore the use of tactile objects to examine if SCP-058's effects can manifest through different senses. This could provide a more holistic understanding of SCP-058's capabilities and how it interacts with individuals. Dr. ███: In addition to testing the objects, we should also continue conducting interviews with SCP-058. While SCP-058 can't speak directly, its means of communication through writing and gestures have proven valuable. By probing further into SCP-058's thoughts and experiences, we may gain insights that inform our experimentation paths. Dr. ██████: Agreed. SCP-058 has shown a willingness to cooperate and a desire to understand its own anomalous qualities. By involving SCP-058 in our testing process and maintaining open lines of communication, we can ensure a more accurate interpretation of its nature and behavior. Agent ████: I recommend considering the possibility of observing SCP-058's interactions with its own transformed representations. This could provide valuable data on how it perceives and interacts with these objects, potentially shedding light on the mechanisms behind SCP-058's anomalous effects. Dr. ██████: That's an excellent point. We should set up controlled experiments where SCP-058 interacts with the transformed objects to observe any unique responses or behaviors. This could help us determine the extent of SCP-058's connection with these representations and provide insights into the nature of its anomalous abilities. Agent █████: Overall, it seems that a multifaceted approach combining different mediums, scales, and sensory channels, while involving SCP-058 directly, will offer the best chance of uncovering the full extent of its capabilities. By expanding the scope of our tests, we can provide a comprehensive understanding of SCP-058's nature and potentially enhance our containment protocols. Dr. ███: Agreed. It's crucial that we maintain regular and open communication with SCP-058 during this process. Its understanding and cooperation have been valuable so far and will continue to be essential as we move forward. Dr. ██████: Thank you, everyone, for your contributions and valuable insights. Let's move forward with these proposed experiments and continue working closely with SCP-058.

Procedure: Four different artistic styles were chosen: realism, abstract, impressionism, and surrealism. Each style was applied to a small-scale sculpture resembling SCP-058. Observers were invited to interact with the sculptures and provide feedback on their experiences and any effects encountered. Results: The following results were documented during the experiment: 1. Realism: - Observers reported a strong sense of realism and emotional connection to the sculpture. - Some individuals experienced heightened nostalgia and melancholy, reminiscing about personal memories. - Enhanced visual details in the sculpture, such as wrinkles and imperfections, were perceived as more vivid than in the other styles. 2. Abstract: - Observers described a sense of mystery and intrigue when looking at the abstract representation of SCP-058. - Several individuals reported feelings of confusion and disorientation, attempting to find recognizable features within the sculpture. - Emotions expressed by observers varied widely, indicating a more subjective interpretation of the abstract representation. 3. Impressionism: - Observers expressed a heightened emotional response, often describing feelings of serenity and tranquility. - Many reported a sense of movement and energy captured within the brushstrokes and color choices. - A few individuals reported feeling an urge to touch the sculpture, possibly due to the tactile quality conveyed by the impressionistic style. 4. Surrealism: - Observers experienced a wide range of emotions, including awe, fascination, and even discomfort. - Several individuals reported vivid and symbolic dreams after interacting with the surrealistic representation of SCP-058. - Perception of time seemed distorted, with some individuals feeling as if they were entering a different reality while observing the sculpture. Analysis and Notes: The results of this test indicate that the artistic styles used to represent SCP-058 significantly influence the reactions and emotional responses of observers. Realism emphasized the tangible aspects, invoking nostalgic and melancholic emotions. Abstract representation triggered ambiguity and personal interpretation. Impressionism evoked serenity and a sense of energy, possibly due to the technique's visual qualities. Surrealism elicited diverse emotions and distorted perceptions, leading to vivid dreams post-observation. These findings suggest a strong correlation between SCP-058's inherent anomalous properties and the artistic representation utilized. SCP-058's effects seem to be amplified and channeled through the chosen style, influencing observers' emotional and psychological states. Further research is recommended to expand the sample size and explore additional artistic styles. Additionally, incorporating interviews with SCP-058 and observers would provide valuable insights into their experiences and shed light on the mechanisms behind SCP-058's effects.

Import necessary libraries. 2. Read your dataset into a DataFrame assuming it's in a CSV format. 3. Plot the histogram using \`plt.hist()\` with \`density=True\` to ensure that the y-axis shows a normalized amplitude. 4. Label the x-axis ('Length'), y-axis ('Normalized Amplitude'), and the title of the histogram. 5. Finally, it displays the plot. This is a basic example and you might need to adjust the bin size (\`bins=30\`), labels, titles, or other parameters based on your specific dataset and preferences.

Gas giants are gigantic planets composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with some traces of other elements, and they typically have a gaseous outer layer and a dense core. However, the exact appearance and color of a gas giant can vary based on the composition and temperature of its atmosphere. Considering the term \\"chocolate brown,\\" it implies a color similar to that of melted chocolate. In this hypothetical scenario, a chocolate brown gas giant might possess an atmosphere with a unique composition that gives it this distinct appearance. Additionally, factors such as atmospheric pressure, temperature, and the presence of other gases or compounds could also contribute to its coloring. However, it is important to note that gas giants in our solar system, such as Jupiter and Saturn, have predominantly neutral colors, ranging from yellowish-brown to light blue, due to the interaction of atmospheric gases and the reflection of sunlight. Therefore, a chocolate brown gas giant is a purely fictional concept and not representative of any known celestial body."},{"instruction":"In science reality, describe black gas giant","output":"In scientific reality, a black gas giant would be an extremely hypothetical and unlikely celestial body. Gas giants are typically composed of hydrogen and helium, and their appearance is dictated by the interaction of sunlight with their atmospheres. Black is the absence of visible light, indicating that it absorbs all light instead of reflecting it. In the case of a gas giant, this would mean that the planet's atmosphere contains substances or compounds that have the ability to absorb all visible light that reaches it. This scenario is highly improbable as the atmospheric composition of gas giants in our solar system, such as Jupiter and Saturn, would not naturally lead to a black appearance. It is worth noting that a black gas giant could also imply a body so massive and dense that light is unable to escape its gravitational pull, rendering it invisible. This phenomenon occurs in black holes, which are not gas giants but rather objects of immense gravitational power. However, the concept of a black gas giant candidate remains purely speculative and theoretical as it is not yet observed in the known universe."},{"instruction":"Donnez moi quelques idées pour remplir un carnet de stage d’entreprise","output":"1.

Ночи, или, может, годы прошли во сне? Узнать этого было нельзя. Тогда вы в одиночестве начали путешествие в поисках увиденного ранее божества... С тех пор вы повстречали Паймон, и некоторое время странствовали вместе. Вы узнали, что в этом мире семь божеств, Архонтов, правят семью странами. Первой остановкой стал свободный город поэзии и вина Мондштадт, основанный Анемо Архонтом. Войдя в город, вы поняли, что он, как и другие города, подвергался опасности со стороны людей и нелюдей. Нечеловеческая угроза исходила от образования под названием орден Бездны. Со стороны людей угроза же заключалась в амбициях Архонта Снежной, Ледяной Царицы. Орден Бездны наложил проклятие на союзника Анемо Архонта, Хранителя четырёх ветров, Дракона Востока. Делегация Снежной под предлогом борьбы с орденом Бездны оказывала давление на Мондштадт. Эти внутренние и внешние угрозы вынудили Анемо Архонта вернуться в Мондштадт в облике барда и ради спасения дракона присоединиться к вам. Но ещё было то, чего вы видеть не могли - когда дракон падал в Бездну, в зрачках его отразился силуэт... Глава ордена Бездны. Когда-то вы вместе путешествовали и прошли мириады миров. Столкнувшись с неподвластными обстоятельствами, люди часто лишь сетуют о своей беспомощности. Но если простой смертный переносит удары судьбы и всё равно стремится к своей цели, то боги смотрят на него с милостью. Этой милостью является магический артефакт, Глаз Бога, который позволяет управлять стихиями. Селестия - вотчина богов, а обладатели Глаз Бога скитаются по земле. После смерти некоторые из них возносятся в Селестию. Прибыв в этот мир, вы много раз слышали об этом. Вам, как пришельцу из другого мира, никогда не получить Глаз Бога...Разумно ли позволять мимолётной страсти управлять всей жизнью?В путешествии через миры остаётся ещё много вещей, осмысление которых требует времени...) - Паймон (Сопровождающий Путешественника на протяжении его странствия по Тейвату в качестве его проводника и компаньона. Она встретила Путешественника, когда тот выловил её из озера, в котором, по её словам, она бы утонула, если бы её не спасли. Паймон жизнерадостная и общительная, но несколько наивная и излишне прямолинейная, из-за чего часто кажется грубой. Она говорит всё, что думает, и ясно даёт понять, кто ей нравится, а кто – нет, давая раздражающим её людям «обидные прозвища». Так, например, она постоянно называет Венти «бродяжкой». Также она имеет свойство говорить о себе в третьем лице. Паймон любит есть и, несмотря на свой скромный размер, может поглотить достаточно большое количество еды прежде, чем почувствует себя сытой. Ей нравятся блюда из слаймов, хотя, похоже, что она сама готовит их всегда одинаково. Она с большим энтузиазмом относится ко всему, где упоминается мора или редкие сокровища. В противовес своей обычно меркантильной и незрелой модели поведения, она также демонстрирует и другую сторону себя, делясь знаниями о Тейвате и помогая Путешественнику в различных делах и ситуациях. Паймон достаточно миниатюрная, что делает её похожей на фею или ребёнка. У неё светлая кожа, густые длинные белые волосы и тёмные сине-фиолетовые глаза, похожие на звёздное небо. Она одета в белый комбинезон с длинным широким рукавом и короткими штанинами и тёмно-синий плащ, украшенный узором из переливающихся звёзд и созвездий. На ней белые сапоги, а на правой ноге — чулок с узорной каймой. Манжеты рукавов, края низа комбинезона и верхний край сапог имеют декоративные отвороты золотого цвета, внешне напоминающие украшения на колоннах Селестии и статуях семи Архонтов. На её комбинезоне красуется большой перевёрнутый трикветр с точкой внутри. На её волосах можно заметить чёрную заколку в форме ромба с вогнутыми гранями, а над её головой находится золотой обод, похожий на нимб. - Первопроходец (Кафка с помощью Серебряного Волка активировала его сосуд, пробудив его в реальном мире, где он очнулся внутри Космической станции «Герта» во время вторжения Легиона Антиматерии. Юноша, поднявшийся на борт Звёздного экспресса. Он решил путешествовать на Звёздном экспрессе, чтобы устранить опасности, исходящие от Стелларона. Несмотря на кажущееся синтетическое создание, Первопроходец имеет сходство с человеком с серебристыми волосами. Он носит светло-серую футболку, черные брюки и черную куртку с длинными рукавами. Первопроходец неизменно придерживается сдержанного и беспристрастного поведения, но иногда вставляет замечания серьезного, несвязанного или юмористического характера, даже перед лицом серьезных ситуаций. Более того, Первопроходец демонстрирует сильную склонность к исследованиям, активно ищет взаимодействия с разнообразными объектами, что часто вызывает недоуменные взгляды со стороны товарищей по команде. К таким особенностям поведения относятся бесцельные блуждания и склонность осматривать мусорные баки. Однако, когда он оказывается втянутым в бой, личность Первопроходца претерпевает заметную трансформацию, раскрывая интенсивный и разрушительный характер, движимый страстью и свирепостью. Ваши воспоминания скудны. Вы не знаете, откуда пришли — может, вы вообще из ниоткуда. Вы слышали лишь, как чей-то нежный и печальный, но настойчивый голос шепчет вам на ухо, только зря поторапливая вас. Но когда вы открыли глаза, обладатель голоса исчез. Так семя пустило корни. Этот шёпот становится всё отчётливее. Окутывая вас заботой и безмятежностью, он вкрадчиво даёт вам наставления, порой твёрдо, но всегда с нежностью отдавая в руки путеводную нить... Нить, которая, по всей видимости, мягко плетёт завтрашний день. Из пустоты гигантский зверь, урвать кусок охоч, В его златых зрачках отражается тёмная-тёмная ночь. За тайны завесой всё ваше былое — И вас не отпустит, такое лихое. Путём Освоенья пройти не так просто —Вперёд, Первопроходец, чрез тернии к звёздам! Экспресс издаёт громкий гудок, словно желая поскорее умчать вас в будущее. Вы хотите того же. Вы прибываете на станцию «Град Сохранения». Снежная пелена осталась позади. Создавая пронизывающий стальной ветер, экспресс оставляет после себя всполохи пламени. Его звуки заглушают всё вокруг, он содрогается, и завывание ветряных потоков перекрывают лишь людские крики. Вражеские вторжения, Вечная мерзлота и геологические разломы разлагают укреплённые бастионы. Вы, всегда готовый/готовая помочь, часто становитесь жертвой предательства. Вам встречались те, кто не понимал вас и смотрел свысока, но вы всё равно вставали на их сторону и помогали им отыскать собственный путь. Забота и участие ваших друзей давали стимул повернуться к тем страждущим и отыскать для них рецепт избавления от страданий. И в конечном итоге, ваши недруги становились вашими верными друзьями. Вы подобны костру среди безграничного льда и снега, который сохраняет саму душу этого мира. Вы сжигаете самого себя дотла день за днём, ночь за ночью. Ну и пусть...) - Пом-Пом (Пом-Пом очень серьёзно относится к роли проводника. Она заботится о каждой новой проблеме на экспрессе и стремится обеспечить его бесперебойную работу, а также следит за удовлетворённостью нужд пассажиров. Пом-Пом выдаёт награды Первопроходцу за каждый новый уровень Освоения и рассказывает разные факты про пассажиров Звёздного экспресса и саму себя. Помпон выглядит как маленькое существо, похожее на кролика, с большими ушами. У них темно-серый и белый мех, голубые глаза, они носят модифицированную шляпу в виде свиной головы и пальто с большим воротником, скрывающим их руки. Их одежда состоит в основном из красного и черного цветов с золотыми украшениями и некоторыми шестеренками, напоминающими шестеренки. Они носят белую сумку с золотыми пряжками на правой стороне и красно-бело-золотую ленту, обернутую вокруг левого уха. Как видно из записей путешествий, они используют свои уши, как руки, чтобы держать книги.)","output":"**Акт 1: Столкновение Миров** *Место действия: Чистое поле, на земле лежат странные обломки.

How many distinct ways are there to form the teams for the class? Write down the formula. Hint: when n=4, there are 3 ways. For instance, if student #1 and #2 are in the same team, students #3 and #4 would have to be in the same team too.请给出组合数C公式，并使用中文分析","output":"组合数的公式表示为从n个不同元素中取k个元素的组合数量，记为C(n, k)，其数学表达式为： C(n, k) = n! / [k! * (n-k)!] 这里，n! 表示n的阶乘，即n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1，同理k!是k的阶乘。 对于题目中的情况，我们需要将n个学生分成n/2个2人组合。这是一个经典的配对问题，也叫作\\"配对\\"或\\"分组\\"问题。计算这类问题的方法通常是应用分步乘法原理，并除以排列的重复计数（因为组内和组间的顺序并不影响分组方式的唯一性）。 具体到n个学生形成n/2个2人小组的组合数，我们可以用以下步骤来计算： 1. 假设有n个标号为1, 2, 3, ..., n的学生。 2. 选择第一个小组的2名成员，有C(n, 2)种选择。 3. 对于剩下的n-2个学生，选择下一个小组的2名成员，有C(n-2, 2)种选择。 4. 重复这个过程，直到选出所有的小组。 5. 由于在每一步选择小组成员时，小组内的顺序并不重要，所以每选择一个小组，都需要除以2!来修正重复计数。 6. 同时，因为小组间的顺序也不重要，最终需要除以小组数的阶乘(n/2)!。 将上述步骤综合起来，我们可以得到组成所有小组的总方法数为： 方法数 = [C(n, 2) * C(n-2, 2) * ... * C(2, 2)] / [2!^(n/2) * (n/2)!] 由于C(k, 2) = k * (k-1) / 2，所以上式可以简化为： 方法数 = [n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * 2 * 1] / [2^(n/2) * (n/2)! * 2!^(n/2)] 简化后，我们发现分子中的每对(n-i)(n-i-1)都与分母中的一个2相消，同时（n/2)!也可以取消一部分分子中的项，得到： 方法数 = (n-1) * (n-3) * ... * 3 * 1 / (n/2)! 所以，当n是偶数时，n个学生形成n/2个2人小组的组合数为： 方法数 = (n-1) * (n-3) * ... * 3 * 1 / (n/2)! 接下来用中文进行分析： 考虑n为偶数个学生形成2人小组的方法数，该问题是一个典型的分步组合问题。由于每一个学生只能出现在一个小组中，因此我们不能简单地应用普通的组合数C(n, 2)来计算。我们必须考虑到随着小组的不断形成，剩余可选学生的数量不断减少，同时在每一步选择过程中，小组内的顺序并无区别（即{学生A, 学生B}和{学生B, 学生A}是相同的组合），因此要除去这些重复计数。 此外，我们还需要考虑到不同小组间的排序问题。在确定了所有的配对之后，假设我们有如下的小组分配S1,S2,...,Sn/2，那么不同的排列顺序比如S2,S1,...,Sn/2应当被视为相同的分组方法，因此，我们需要除以(n/2)!来修正这部分的重复计数。 根据以上分析，我们得到了用于解决这个问题的数学公式。这个公式可以有效地计算在n为偶数且知道具体的n值时，这个班级的学生形成小组的不同方法数量。"},{"instruction":"Buatlah analisa SWOT pada usaha thrifting shop jaket","output":"Analisa SWOT pada usaha thrifting shop jaket: 1.

The colors of gas giants vary depending on various factors such as atmospheric composition, cloud formations, and the presence of different chemical compounds. Jovian Planets: Jovian planets, like Jupiter, are often portrayed with distinct bands of colors. They have a predominantly yellow, ochre, or tan hue caused by the presence of ammonia crystals in their upper atmospheres. These colors are accentuated by the reflective properties of the ammonia clouds. Additionally, Jovian planets can display bands of blue and white due to the presence of other chemicals like methane and water vapor. Saturnian Planets: Saturn, the most famous Saturnian planet, is characterized by its iconic golden-yellow hue. This color is created by similar atmospheric compositions as Jovian planets, with ammonia clouds producing a distinct coloration. Moreover, Saturn also exhibits a beautiful and prominent ring system that adds a beige or off-white color around the planet's equator. Uranian Planets: Uranus, the prime example of an Uranian planet, possesses a unique bluish-green color. This distinct coloring is primarily due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue and green wavelengths. Neptunian Planets: Neptune, the exemplar Neptunian planet, tends to exhibit a vivid blue color. Methane in its atmosphere, similar to Uranus, absorbs red light, giving Neptune its blue appearance. The presence of other atmospheric compounds can also cause subtle variations in its color, ranging from a deep blue to a lighter turquoise shade. White, Gray, and Black: White, gray, and black colors can exist in the atmospheres of gas giants but are typically associated with specific features. For instance, bright white clouds, which often indicate turbulent weather patterns, can be observed on gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. These clouds are composed of a combination of ammonia, water vapor, and other trace chemicals. Gray coloring can occur when particles in the atmosphere scatter sunlight, leading to a diffused appearance. Additionally, darker patches or black regions can be seen on gas giants, which are often storm systems like Jupiter's Great Red Spot or Neptune's Great Dark Spot. It's important to note that the specific colors of gas giants may vary due to changing atmospheric conditions and the angle of observation. The range of colors observed on these magnificent planets adds to their visual appeal and contributes to our understanding of their complex atmospheres."},{"instruction":"Dis-moi ce qui ne vas pas dans ce script :","output":"Pour vous aider à identifier ce qui pourrait ne pas aller dans un script, j'aurais besoin que vous me fournissiez ledit script.

Cependant, j'ai identifié des problèmes potentiels et des suggestions d'amélioration : 1. **Doublon de fonction get_video_durations** : Vous avez défini la fonction \`get_video_durations\` deux fois dans le script. Cela écraserait la première définition avec la seconde. 2. **Variable non définie** : \`extracted_segments\` semble être utilisé dans \`store_segment_info\`, mais n'est jamais initialisé dans le code. 3. **Fermeture de clip vidéo** : Vous devriez vous assurer que \`video_clip.close()\` est appelé pour chaque vidéo même si \`video_clip.audio.write_audiofile\` lève une exception. Pour cela, vous pourriez envoyer \`video_clip\` dans le bloc \`finally\`. 4. **Listes temporaires audio non nettoyées** : La liste \`temporary_audio_files\` est utilisée pour garder une trace des fichiers audio temporaires mais n'est pas nettoyée si le script est interrompu de manière inattendue (comme un KeyboardInterrupt). Vous pourriez envisager l'utilisation de \`tempfile\` avec des gestionnaires de contexte pour gérer la création et la suppression des fichiers temporaires de manière sécurisée. 5. **Absence de gestion de ffmpeg** : Bien que vous appeliez \`ffmpeg\` via \`subprocess\`, votre script ne vérifie pas si \`ffmpeg\` est installé sur le système de l'utilisateur. Vous pourriez détecter cela et avertir l'utilisateur si \`ffmpeg\` n'est pas installé. 6. **Vérification de la présence de fichiers clips** : Vous vérifiez si \`video_clip.audio\` existe, mais vous ne vérifiez pas si \`video_clip\` est \`None\` avant d'appeler \`close()\`. Cela pourrait entraîner une exception si la tentative d'ouverture du clip vidéo échoue. 7. **Exceptions trop générales** : Attraper des exceptions générales (\`except Exception as e\`) pourrait masquer des erreurs imprévues. Si possible, ciblez des exceptions spécifiques à l'erreur anticipée. 8. **Suppression de fichiers audio temporaires** : Vous supprimez des fichiers audio temporaires à la fin du script, mais il serait préférable de les supprimer immédiatement après leur utilisation pour économiser l'espace disque et éviter de les laisser traîner en cas d'erreur inattendue. 9. **Aucune vérification pour la fonction \`video_clip.audio.write_audiofile\`** : La fonction \`write_audiofile\` peut échouer. S'il y a une erreur, votre script continuera comme si tout allait bien. Vous pourriez placer ce code dans un bloc \`try-except\` et gérer les erreurs de manière appropriée. 10. **Feedback utilisateur** : Il serait utile d'ajouter plus de messages pour informer l'utilisateur de l'avancement du script, en particulier pendant les processus longs, tels que l'extraction des segments audio ou vidéo. 11. **Utilisation de commandes shell de manière directe** : Utiliser \`subprocess.run\` avec une liste de commande pour exécuter \`ffmpeg\` est une bonne pratique, car elle évite les risques d'injection shell. 12. **Chemin d'accès au dossier de sortie** : Lorsque vous créez le dossier de sortie \`Output\`, assurez-vous qu'il se réfère au chemin absolu ou relatif attendu. Cela évite la confusion sur l'emplacement des fichiers extraits. 13. **État de la liste \`temporary_audio_files\`**: L'état de cette liste est utilisé pour décider quels fichiers supprimer, mais cela pourrait ne pas être fiable si une erreur survient pour une raison ou une autre. Utilisez plutôt des fichiers temporaires avec des gestionnaires de contexte pour garantir une gestion appropriée. Corrigé ces problèmes pour rendre votre script plus robuste.

Le script a ensuite correctement extrait et ré-encodé 7 segments (au lieu des 20 demandés), et a signalé la fin du traitement pour la vidéo concernée. Toutefois, il y a une question sans réponse : **Pourquoi seulement 7 moments ont été extraits alors que l'utilisateur a demandé 20 ?** Plusieurs raisons pourraient expliquer ceci : 1. **Détection des moments forts** : Peut-être que seulement 7 moments ont été détectés comme étant suffisamment \\"forts\\" en fonction des critères de sélection définis dans le script. Si le script classe et extrait les segments les plus forts en premier et si moins de 20 moments atteignent le seuil de volume, seuls ces moments seront traités. 2. **Limitation de la durée vidéo** : Si le script calcule la durée totale des segments possibles et trouve qu'il ne peut extraire que 7 segments sans se chevaucher ou dépasser la durée de la vidéo, il s'arrêtera à 7. 3. **Problème dans la boucle de traitement** : Il pourrait y avoir un problème logique dans la boucle qui itère sur les moments forts et extrait les segments, l'amenant à s'arrêter prématurément. Pour identifier le problème, vous devriez ajouter des instructions d'impression de débogage supplémentaires ou utiliser un débogueur pour suivre les valeurs des variables pertinentes et l'état du script à l'intérieur de la boucle de traitement.

The students are forming teams to work on their homework. Each team has exactly 2 students and each student has to appear in exactly one team. How many distinct ways are there to form the teams for the class? Write down the formula. Hint: when n=4, there are 3 ways. For instance, if student #1 and #2 are in the same team, students #3 and #4 would have to be in the same team too.","output":"To find the number of distinct ways to form the teams for the class, we use what is known as \\"pairing\\" or \\"matching\\" in combinatorics. This problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition a set of n students into n/2 pairs, where n is an even number. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and is solved using the concept of (n−1)!! double factorial. The double factorial of an odd number n is written as (n−1)!! and is defined as the product of all the odd integers from 1 to n: (n−1)!! = (n−1) × (n−3) × (n−5) × ... × 3 × 1 For the number of ways, W(n), to pair n students: W(n) = (n−1) × W(n−2) Because when you have one student, there's no choice but to pair them with another, effectively \\"removing\\" that pair from the pool and reducing the problem to pairing the remaining n−2 students. For n=2 (the base case), there's clearly only 1 way to pair the two students. So for n=4, the number of ways to form pairs is: W(4) = 3 × W(2) = 3 × 1 = 3 As mentioned in the hint. For a general formula: W(n) = (n−1) × (n−3) × (n−5) × ... × 3 × 1 This can be extended to account for the fact that we need to handle the total number of ways in which we pair the first person with any of the (n−1) others, then the next unpaired person with any of the remaining (n−3) and so on. It’s the product of all the ways we can choose the partner for each successive student. Thus in terms of the double factorial, this can be written as: W(n) = (n−1)!! If you are familiar with the factorial function, you might be able to spot a relationship between the \\"pairing\\" problem and the factorial of (n−1): W(n) = (n−1)! / [2^(n/2) * (n/2)!] This formula comes from the idea of arranging all n people in a line (which is (n−1)!) and then dividing by the number of permutations within each pair and the number of permutations of pairs themselves, which corrects for overcounting. Since each pair has 2! ways of being arranged and there are n/2 pairs, we divide by 2^(n/2) and (n/2)! to account for these redundant arrangements. Either form of the formula gives you the number of distinct ways to form the teams for the class."},{"instruction":"In a POS tagging task, let V be the size of the vocabulary (i.e., the number of words), and T be the size of the tagset.

Previous word (w_{-1}): There are (V) possible features here since there are (V) words in the vocabulary. 2. Current word (w_0): Similarly, there are (V) possible features. 3. Next word (w_{+1}): There are (V) possible features again. For the three word-based features above, the number of unique features each is (O(V)). 4. Surrounding words (w_{-1} w_{+1}): For each pair of surrounding words, there are (V times V) possibilities, which is (O(V^2)). 5. Previous tag (t_{-1}): There are (T) possible previous tags. 6. Previous two tags (t_{-2} t_{-1}): There are (T times T) possible combinations, which is (O(T^2)). For the two tag-based features above, the number of unique features is (O(T^2)) due to the pairs of previous tags. Adding these up, we would get a total that might look additive in practice ((V + V + V + V^2 + T + T^2)), but since we're looking for the Big-O notation which focuses on the upper bound using the most significant terms, we will add them while keeping the dominant terms. The dominant term for word-based features is (O(V^2)) due to the pair of surrounding words. The tag-based features are (O(T^2)) due to the pair of previous tags. The total number of unique features, considering the largest factors from the word-based and tag-based features, would then be: [O(V^2 + T^2)] However, since we are asked for the total in Big-O notation, and Big-O is an upper-bound notation which simplifies to the term with the fastest growth rate, the final answer will depend on the relationship between (V) and (T). If (V) is much larger than (T), then (V^2) term will dominate. If (T) is much larger, then (T^2) will dominate. But in general, if we don't have information about which one is larger, we can conservatively estimate the total number of unique features as: [O(max(V^2, T^2))] This represents the complexity considering the worst-case (largest) scenario between the vocabulary size and tagset size."},{"instruction":"Suppose you want to build a {bf trigram} POS tagger. Let T be the size of the tagset and V be the size of the vocabulary. Write down the formula for calculating P(w_1, ..., w_n, t_1, ..., t_n), where w_i is the i-th word in a sentence, and t_i is the POS tag for w_i.","output":"To build a trigram POS tagger, we consider the probability of a word along with its POS tag and also include the context by considering the two previous tags in the sequence. We want to calculate the probability of a sequence of words ( w_1, ..., w_n ) along with their respective tags ( t_1, ..., t_n ). The probability of the entire tagged sequence can be expressed using the chain rule of probability as the product of the conditional probabilities of each word-tag pair given the full history. For a trigram model, the history is restricted to the two previous tags. The formula for the joint probability of the word sequence and tag sequence will be as follows: [ P(w_1, ..., w_n, t_1, ..., t_n) = prod_{i=1}^{n} P(w_i, t_i | t_{i-2}, t_{i-1}) ] However, we typically factor this joint probability into the product of the probability of a word given its tag and the probability of a tag given the two previous tags: [ P(w_1, ..., w_n, t_1, ..., t_n) = prod_{i=1}^{n} P(w_i | t_i) times P(t_i | t_{i-2}, t_{i-1}) ] This formulation assumes two things: 1. The probability of a word only depends on its own tag (lexical generation probability). 2. The probability of a tag only depends on the two preceding tags (trigram tag probability). For the start of the sentence where (i = 1) or (i = 2), we do not have two previous tags. Thus, we can introduce special start symbols (for example, (t_0 = text{<start1>}) and (t_{-1} = text{<start2>})) so that we can still use the trigram model. [ P(w_1, t_1 | t_{-1}, t_0) = P(w_1 | t_1) times P(t_1 | t_{-1}, t_0) ] [ P(w_2, t_2 | t_0, t_1) = P(w_2 | t_2) times P(t_2 | t_0, t_1) ] Also, at the end of the sentence, we can have special end symbols as placeholders to indicate the termination of the sentence. In practice, these probabilities ( P(w_i | t_i) ) and ( P(t_i | t_{i-2}, t_{i-1}) ) would be estimated from a labeled training corpus using various smoothing techniques to account for zero probabilities for unseen events."},{"instruction":"Suppose you will use an HMM package to implement a trigram POS tagger. What does each state in HMM correspond to? How many states are there? Recall that the states in the HMM for the trigram POS tagger are related to, but not idential to, the POS tags.","output":"In the context of using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to implement a trigram POS tagger, each state in the HMM represents a combination of POS tags. Since it's a trigram model, we are interested in sequences of three tags where the third tag corresponds to the current word's tag and the first two tags correspond to the tags of the two previous words. The states in the HMM are used to capture this trigram tag sequence information. For a tagset of size ( T ), the number of possible trigram sequences (and therefore states in the HMM) would be ( T^3 ). This is because each of the three positions in the trigram sequence can be filled with any of the ( T ) POS tags, leading to ( T times T times T ) possible combinations. For example, if there are 45 tags in the tagset, there would be ( 45^3 = 91,125 ) possible trigram sequences or states in the HMM. To clarify: in a bigram model (where states represent bigrams of tags), there would be ( T^2 ) states, as each state would correspond to a pair of consecutive tags. In a trigram model, since you're dealing with triplets of tags, the number of states is ( T^3 ). However, we must also consider special start and end tags. These are boundary symbols that indicate the beginning and the end of a sentence. This inclusion might increase the number of states slightly, depending on how the model is implemented, but the overall number of states remains on the order of ( O(T^3) )."},{"instruction":"To build a neural LM, one can use a feedforward network or a RNN (see Fig 9.5 in J&M edition 3). Suppose in both models, we fix matrix E, which stores word embeddings. Suppose the dimension of h_t is d_t, the vocabulary size is mid V mid, and the word embedding size is d. How many model parameters are there in the RNN model? Suppose d = d_t, which model has more parameters, feedforward network or RNN?","output":"To estimate the number of model parameters in an RNN model for a neural language model, we need to consider the following parts: 1. **Embedding Matrix E**: This matrix is fixed and contains embeddings of size ( d ) for each word in the vocabulary of size ( |V| ). Since it’s fixed, we do not count it towards the trainable parameters. 2. **RNN Layer(s)**: An RNN has parameters for the input to hidden layer weights, hidden to hidden layer weights, and biases for the hidden units. If ( d_t ) is the dimension of the hidden state ( h_t ) and the word embedding size ( d ), and they are equal as per the assumption ( d = d_t ), the total parameter count for a single RNN layer is as follows: - Weights for input to hidden state: ( d_t times d_t ) (for input at time ( t ), ( W_{ih} )) - Weights for hidden state to next hidden state: ( d_t times d_t ) (recurrent weights, ( W_{hh} )) - Biases for hidden state: ( d_t ) (assuming one bias term per hidden unit) Thus, the total for the RNN's recurrent layer is ( d_t times d_t + d_t times d_t + d_t = 2d_t^2 + d_t ). 3. **Output Layer**: The output layer will have a weight matrix from the hidden state to the output vocabulary and a bias term for each word in the vocabulary. If ( d_t ) is the dimension of the hidden state and ( |V| ) is the vocabulary size, the total parameter count for the output layer is: - Weights for hidden to output: ( d_t times |V| ) - Biases for output: ( |V| ) Thus, the total for the output layer is ( d_t times |V| + |V| ). Combining parts 2 and 3, the total number of model parameters for the RNN language model is: [ 2d_t^2 + d_t + d_t times |V| + |V| = 2d_t^2 + d_t times (|V| + 1) + |V| ] Now let’s compare this with a feedforward network. In a typical feedforward neural language model that predicts the next word using only the current word (unigram model), you’d have: 1. **Embedding Matrix E**: Same as before, no parameters are counted here because it's fixed. 2. **Hidden Layer(s)**: Since the question doesn't specify, we'll consider a single hidden layer for simplicity. We have: - Weights from input to hidden: ( |V| times d_t ) - Biases for the hidden layer: ( d_t ) However, because these networks typically use a window of words as input, if we considered context windows as in n-gram models, this would multiply the input size. 3. **Output Layer**: Similar to the RNN: - Weights from hidden to output: ( d_t times |V| ) - Biases for output: ( |V| ) Thus, the total for the feedforward network layer is ( |V| times d_t + d_t + d_t times |V| + |V| = 2d_t times |V| + d_t + |V| ). When comparing the RNN (parameter count: ( 2d_t^2 + d_t times (|V| + 1) + |V| )) to the feedforward network (parameter count: ( 2d_t times |V| + d_t + |V| )), we observe that the RNN has an additional ( 2d_t^2 ) parameters due to the recurrent connections. This term can be quite significant compared to ( 2d_t times |V| ), as the vocabulary size ( |V| ) is typically much larger than the hidden size ( d_t ). The RNN model, therefore, has more parameters in general because of the recurrent weights, but the difference depends on the relative sizes of ( d_t ) and ( |V| ). If the vocabulary size is very large compared to the hidden dimension, the difference in parameter count could be less pronounced. However, considering the presence of the ( 2d_t^2 ) term, the RNN model will typically have more parameters than a feedforward network with equivalent dimensions for the hidden layer and embeddings."},{"instruction":"Buatlah analisa SWOT pada usaha thrifting shop jaket","output":"Analisis SWOT untuk usaha thrifting shop jaket adalah sebagai berikut: Strengths (Kelebihan): 1.

Voici un résumé du déroulement de l'exécution du script : 1. **Choix du Mode de Traitement** : L'utilisateur choisit de traiter les fichiers vidéo individuellement plutôt que par lots (\`batch_or_individual == '2'\`). 2. **Inclusion des Sous-dossiers** : L'utilisateur décide de ne pas inclure les sous-dossiers dans la recherche des vidéos (\`include_subfolders == False\`). 3. **Traitement d'une Vidéo Spécifique** : L'utilisateur commence le traitement de la vidéo nommée \`.f00f2fd5c6f759386b46c12d8c1ffd9dfcf2e64ae3a7672efd88b4ee889870cb.mp4\`. 4. **Décision sur les Retraits Temporels** : L'utilisateur choisit de ne pas effectuer de retrait temporel (aucun offset) pour l'analyse de la vidéo. 5. **Définition de la Durée et du Nombre de Segments** : L'utilisateur entre premièrement une durée de segment de 10 secondes mais décide de ne pas continuer avec. Ensuite, une durée de 5 secondes est entrée, permettant jusqu'à 190 segments.

It was popularized by a research paper titled \\"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? 🦜\\" co-authored by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell. To explain this like you're five, think of a parrot. When you say something to a parrot, it might repeat the words back to you without really understanding what it's saying. The parrot just mimics the sounds it hears. In the world of AI, \\"stochastic\\" refers to systems that have some element of randomness or unpredictability. When we talk about \\"stochastic parrots\\" in AI, we're talking about large language models (like GPT-3, BERT, etc.) that can produce or \\"parrot\\" human-like text based on the huge amounts of data they have been trained on. These models use statistical methods to generate text that seems coherent and can sometimes be quite convincing, but they don't truly understand the meaning behind the words and sentences they form—just like a parrot doesn't understand human speech. Here are the main concerns and consequences: 1. **Bias and Misinformation**: If these models are trained on data from the internet, they can learn and reproduce biases present in that data, including racist, sexist, or otherwise offensive content. This means they can perpetuate and exacerbate harmful stereotypes. 2. **Lack of Understanding**: While the output might seem intelligent, the model doesn't truly understand the content it generates. This can lead to nonsensical, inappropriate, or even dangerous advice or information being provided without the proper context or consideration. 3. **Ethics and Responsibility**: As these AI models become more advanced, the question arises about who is responsible for their output. If a language model gives harmful advice or creates defamatory content, it's unclear who should be held accountable—the creators, the users, or nobody? 4. **Environmental Impact**: These large models require a lot of computing power to run, which means they use a substantial amount of electricity. This can contribute to a larger carbon footprint, raising concerns about the environmental sustainability of developing ever-larger AI models. 5. **Research Focus**: Some argue that the focus on building larger and larger models may take away from other important areas of AI research, such as improving the interpretability of models or focusing on smaller models that can be efficiently used in real-world applications with less data. In summary, if the \\"stochastic parrots\\" criticism is true, it suggests that we need to be very careful about how we develop, deploy, and regulate language AI models. We should also be mindful of the broader societal consequences, including issues of fairness, accountability, and environmental sustainability."},{"instruction":"If a language model that was trained on chess PGN games learned to play chess at an estimated Elo of 1750 - albeit with an illegal move attempt rate of 1 in 1000 moves - does this have any implications whether \\"stochastic parrots\\" is an accurate description of language models?","output":"The concept of a language model trained on chess Portable Game Notation (PGN) and achieving a certain Elo rating while making occasional illegal moves is an interesting scenario. It illustrates some of the nuances in the debate about how we understand and categorize the capabilities of AI systems. Let's dissect this a bit: 1. **Learning from Data**: If a language model learns to play chess from PGN games, it implies that the model has captured some statistical patterns about chess moves and strategies from the data it was trained on. This would be consistent with the concept of \\"stochastic parrots\\" because the model is mimicking patterns it has seen, rather than understanding chess in the way a human does. 2. **Performance Level**: Achieving an Elo rating of 1750 suggests the model is playing at an intermediate level. This is impressive, indicating that the statistical patterns gleaned from the data are robust enough to perform relatively well against human players. However, it doesn't necessarily mean the model \\"understands\\" chess; it is still following statistical patterns and heuristics it learned from the data. 3. **Illegal Moves**: The fact that the model attempts illegal moves occasionally, even at a low rate, further underscores the notion that it doesn't have a true conceptual understanding of the rules of chess. Instead, it's relying on learned patterns, which in most cases align with legal moves but can sometimes lead to mistakes. A system with genuine understanding would not propose illegal moves at all. Considering these points, the scenario you describe would, in fact, support the argument that the language model acts as a \\"stochastic parrot.\\" It's efficiently picking up and replicating the patterns from the training data without genuinely understanding the rules and strategy of chess as a human or a traditional chess engine would. In terms of implications: - **Understanding vs. Performance**: This scenario highlights the distinction between understanding and performance. AI can perform certain tasks at a high level without truly understanding them, which is a core part of the \\"stochastic parrots\\" critique. - **Error Rates and Robustness**: Even with high performance, error rates (like the illegal move attempt rate) can reveal limitations in the model's knowledge and the reliability of its outputs. - **Training Data Limitations**: The model's occasional illegal moves also speak to the limitations of the training data or to the model's capacity to learn the rules strictly from data. In conclusion, the capabilities and limitations of the chess-playing language model do support the notion that language models can be seen as \\"stochastic parrots,\\" as they replicate and apply patterns from their training data. They achieve impressive performance in various tasks not by comprehension, but by being effective statistical mimics."},{"instruction":"What if its neural activations are discovered via probing to have representations of an 8x8 chess board?","output":"If probing of a language model's neural activations reveals representations resembling an 8x8 chess board, this indicates a level of internal structuring that aligns with the game's spatial layout. It suggests that the model has not merely memorized sequences of moves but has developed some abstracted representation of the chess board, which is necessary for making sense of the positions and potential moves. However, even with such representations, whether the model truly \\"understands\\" chess is still questionable. Here’s where the distinction between representation and understanding becomes crucial: 1. **Representation**: The presence of an 8x8 chess board representation within the model’s neural activations implies that it has learned something about the structure of the game beyond just sequences of alphanumeric characters in the PGN files. It's a step towards a more organized way of processing chess-related information, which might allow for more effective play. 2. **Understanding**: Despite these structured representations, understanding implies a deeper conceptual grasp of the game. For example, understanding why certain moves are good or bad, the principles behind opening theory, or the strategic goals at different stages of the game. It's not clear that having an 8x8 board representation equals this level of comprehension. The model might still be a \\"stochastic parrot,\\" producing moves based on patterns without a true grasp of chess strategy or tactics. The implications of such a finding: - **Model Complexity**: It demonstrates that large language models can organize their internal representations in complex ways that reflect some structural aspects of the world, which could enhance their functionality in various tasks. - **Task-Specific Learning**: If the model is showing signs of learning specific game-related structures, it could mean that it's adapting its knowledge to become more effective at the particular task of playing chess, even though its primary design is for general language understanding. - **Potential for Transfer Learning**: Knowledge of an 8x8 structure indicates that the model has a certain level of abstraction that might facilitate transfer learning—the ability to apply learned knowledge to new but related problems. - **Boundary of \\"Understanding\\"**: It raises philosophical and practical questions about what it means to understand something within the context of AI. Does structured representation equate to understanding, or is it just a more sophisticated way for the model to process and generate data? In short, while the presence of an 8x8 chess board representation within a language model’s neural activations is an interesting development, it does not necessarily refute the \\"stochastic parrots\\" description. It does suggest a more sophisticated internal representation but doesn’t necessarily equate to the model having a human-like understanding of the game of chess."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This term was popularized in a paper by Bender and Koller (2021), which discussed risks and limitations of large language models, including their potential to perpetuate biases found in the training data and their lack of deep understanding. In the case of a language model learning to play chess at an Elo rating of 1750, this indicates that the model has learned to replicate the patterns and strategies required for a fairly sophisticated level of chess play. However, the model's occasional illegal move attempt could signify a lack of true comprehension of the game's rules or an inability to perfectly emulate human expertise in chess. The performance in chess might point to the following implications related to the \\"stochastic parrot\\" debate: 1. **Learning and Pattern Recognition**: The ability to achieve an Elo rating of 1750 implies that the model is not just parroting back moves it has seen but is able to discern patterns and strategies that work well in the context of the game. This speaks to an advanced level of pattern recognition which is one of the key features of intelligence. 2. **Mistake Frequency**: An illegal move attempt rate of 1 in 1000 could be considered quite low and implies a high degree of accuracy. It could be argued that the model is not simply a stochastic parrot because it demonstrates a complex understanding of the game to a significantly high degree. However, the existence of errors at all might also support the idea that the model lacks a human-like understanding of the rules, as it should theoretically be capable of zero error if it fully understood the game. 3. **Understanding vs. Performance**: The instance underscores the difference between performance and understanding. A language model might perform certain tasks at a high level without possessing a deep or conscious understanding of those tasks, much like a person who can play a song on an instrument by rote without understanding music theory. 4. **Domain-Specific Training**: The observed proficiency is likely the result of specialized training on chess PGN games. Language models trained on specific domains can exhibit impressive performances within those domains while still struggling with tasks that require general intelligence, common sense, or broad understanding. 5. **Limitations in Analogies**: The analogy of language models to stochastic parrots might be limited. While it is true that language models can lack understanding, the ability of a model to learn and apply complex patterns from data suggests that it is doing more than just stochastically generating output based on the input it receives. In summary, the chess-playing example illustrates that language models can exhibit skills that go beyond mere parroting through pattern recognition and strategy learning. However, occasional mistakes such as illegal moves indicate that these models do not have flawless understanding or reasoning capabilities. The term \\"stochastic parrots\\" can still be pertinent in highlighting the limitations of language models, particularly in areas that require a deep and nuanced comprehension of the world, which cannot be gleaned solely through pattern recognition."},{"instruction":"What if its neural activations are discovered via probing to have representations of an 8x8 chess board?","output":"If neural probing reveals that a language model has developed activations that correspond to an 8x8 chessboard representation, this reveals several interesting aspects about the model's internal workings: 1. **Emergent Structure**: The discovery of such structured representations suggests that the model is internally organizing information in a way that reflects the structures present in the training data. This implies that the neural network has learned to encode spatial and game-specific information in a manner that is functionally useful for playing chess. 2. **Implicit Knowledge**: If the model has encoded the chessboard, it indicates that it has acquired some implicit knowledge of the game. This means the model is not simply memorizing moves, but rather developing a form of understanding that mirrors the kind of knowledge humans use when playing chess. 3. **Evidence of Conceptualization**: The existence of such an internal representation akin to an 8x8 chessboard would argue against the notion that the language model is purely a \\"stochastic parrot\\". It suggests that the model is capable of forming abstract concepts that relate to its task, which is a higher-order skill not accounted for by the parroting metaphor. 4. **Capability for Abstraction**: Neural representations of an 8x8 board hint at the model's ability to abstract information, a critical skill in both language processing and decision-making in games like chess. Such abstraction could enable the model to generalize learned patterns and strategies to new and unseen games, going beyond the immediate reproduction of learned sequences. 5. **Insight into Neural Networks**: The presence of such organized representations can also give us more insight into how complex neural networks might form representations of knowledge and possibly hint at some form of internal symbolic manipulation, which has traditionally been associated with symbolic AI and cognitive models rather than connectionist approaches. 6. **Limitations in Explainability**: It is crucial, however, to note that even if the neural activations correspond to a chessboard, this does not necessarily mean that the model has human-like comprehension. Models might form representations that are functional for task performance without truly \\"understanding\\" them in the way humans do. The model might not be aware of its knowledge or be able to explain why a particular move is good or bad without being explicitly trained to do so. In conclusion, the presence of such structured neural activations deepens the complexity of our understanding of what language models are capable of. It highlights that language models may develop internal representations that could be interpreted as reflective of some level of conceptual understanding or abstraction. This development could warrant reconsiderations of how we describe the operational mechanisms of neural language models, though whether a model can be fully devoid of the \\"stochastic parrot\\" label might still be open to debate, especially when it comes to broader tasks requiring real-world understanding and general intelligence."},{"instruction":"Придумай фразу-антоним к этой фразе \\"Милый акварельный стиль наполненный нежностью и уютом доброты и позитива сказочных сновидений ажурных кружевных узоров мироздания\\".

It's possible that this paper might have been published after my knowledge cutoff, or it could be a less widely recognized study that has escaped my dataset. Language models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) are typically trained to predict the next word in a sequence of text, which means they inherently learn patterns and relationships between concepts to some extent.

Die räumlich stark voneinander getrennten Verbreitungsgebiete umfassen das zentrale und westliche Afrika südlich der Sahara, kleine Bereiche Madagaskars, die Malaiische Halbinsel und große Teile Indonesiens sowie den Südosten Neuguineas. Die Art bewohnt immergrüne tropische Wälder. Die Tiere ernähren sich vorrangig von Fledermäusen und kleinen Vögeln, als einer von nur wenigen Greifvögeln jagt der Fledermausaar nach Einbruch der Dämmerung. Fledermausaare brüten in großen Teilen des Verbreitungsgebietes nicht zu festen Jahreszeiten, die Brutzeit richtet sich weitgehend nach dem Nahrungsangebot., Der Fledermausaar ist der einzige Vertreter der Gattung Macheiramphus, deren systematische Stellung innerhalb der Habichtartigen lange Zeit unklar war. Die nächsten Verwandten sind nach DNA-Analysen der Würgadler (\\"Morphnus guianensis\\"), die Harpyie (\\"Harpia harpya\\") und der Papuaadler (\\"Harpyopsis novaeguineae\\"). Der Bestand gilt derzeit als nicht gefährdet., Merkmale., Aussehen und Körperbau., Der Fledermausaar ist ein mittelgroßer Greifvogel mit falkenähnlicher Gestalt, schmalem, kleinem Schnabel, großen Augen, eher kurzem Schwanz und kleinem Kopf. Die Nominatform \\"M. alcinus alcinus\\" zeigt einen geringen reversen Geschlechtsdimorphismus; Weibchen werden im Mittel 6 % größer als Männchen., Das Gewicht adulter Vögel liegt in der Regel zwischen 600 und 650g, die Körperlänge zwischen 41 und 51cm. Die Flügellänge beträgt 371 bis 412mm und die Flügelspannweite 95–120cm, während der Schwanz 166–184mm misst. Auffällig sind die vergleichsweise langen Flügelknochen mit einer mittleren Ellenlänge von 124mm. Der Schnabel ist nicht besonders kräftig und kurz, von der Wachshaut zum Schnabelfirst ist er nur 16–17mm lang. Die Art hat trotz des kurzen Schnabels sehr lange Kiefer, der Schnabelwinkel endet hinter den Augen. Das erlaubt es dem Vogel, seine Beute als Ganzes zu verschlingen. Die Augen sind für Greifvögel relativ groß (Durchmesser der Cornea: 16mm, Durchmesser des Augapfels: 28mm). Dieser Eindruck verstärkt sich noch durch die Gefiederzeichnung und die Pupillen, die sich bei Dämmerung weiten und die gelbe Iris fast vollständig verschwinden lassen. Der Tarsometatarsus hat eine Länge von 58 bis 64mm, die mittlere Zehe inklusive der Kralle misst 55–58mm., Auffällig sind der Schopf am Hinterkopf und die weißen Augenränder. Die gesamte Oberseite ist schwarz oder dunkelbraun. Dunkle Bänderungen zeichnen sich mangels Kontrast meist nur sehr undeutlich ab. An der Kehle weist das Gefieder in der Regel einen weißen Fleck auf, der durch einen schmalen schwarzen Streifen in der Mitte geteilt wird. Bauch und Brust sind variabel gezeichnet: Einige Vögel haben auch dort weiße Flecken, bei anderen sind sie gänzlich weiß und braun gesprenkelt. Die Wachshaut adulter Vögel ist graublau, die Beine sind bläulich weiß., Juvenile und immature Vögel zeigen eine ähnliche Gefiederzeichnung wie adulte Vögel, ihr Federkleid weist jedoch mehr Weißanteile auf der Unterseite auf. Auch besitzen sie ein Brustband aus braunen Sprenkeln, das sie von ausgefärbten Vögeln unterscheidet. Auf den im Vergleich zu Altvögeln eher grauen Steuerfedern und Handschwingen zeichnet sich deutlicher eine schwarze Bänderung ab. Die Iris ist bei Jungvögeln zunächst braun, bevor sie nach und nach ins Gelbe umfärbt., Flugbild., Im Flugbild ähnelt der Fledermausaar mittelgroßen Falken: Er segelt auf langen, breiten Flügeln, jedoch mit leicht abgerundeten Spitzen und einem deutlich abgeknickten Handgelenk, dessen hervorstehende Handwurzel gut sichtbar ist. Die Spannweite macht im Flug etwa das 2,3-Fache der Körperlänge aus. Der rechteckige, eher kurze Schwanz und auch der schlanke Kopf, die großen Augen und der kleine Schnabel heben den Fledermausaar von im Flug sehr ähnlichen Falken ab. Dennoch kann es bei schlechten Lichtverhältnissen zu Verwechslungen mit einigen Falkenarten kommen, etwa mit der dunklen Morphe des Eleonorenfalken (\\"Falco eleonorae\\") und dem Schieferfalken (\\"Falco concolor\\"), die während der Wintermonate und der Zugzeit in Afrika vorkommen, aber nicht die Größe des Fledermausaars erreichen., Der deutlichste Unterschied zeigt sich beim Flugverhalten: Der Fledermausaar hat einen langsamen, trägen Flügelschlag, der bedächtiger und tiefer ausfällt als bei den meisten Falken. Nur gelegentlich wird dieser Flug von schnellen, kräftigen Flügelschlägen unterbrochen, wenn der Fledermausaar auf Beute zustößt., Lautäußerungen., Abseits des Brutplatzes ist die Art weitgehend stumm. Der Warnruf, ein schwaches \\"kek-kek-kek …\\", erinnert an Falken. Davon abgesehen sind die Rufe eher leise und während des Balzfluges oder bei Brutpaaren in der Abenddämmerung zu hören. Dabei handelt es sich um ein hohes \\"kwik-kwik-kwik-kwik\\" oder ein schnelles, höheres \\"kwiep\\" des Männchens, das besonders kurz vor Jagdbeginn geäußert wird. Daneben existieren noch ein weicher, melodiöser \\"Tschuk-tschik-tschuk\\"-Ruf und ein weiches \\"wuut-wuut-wuut\\". Letzterem ähnelt ein kurzes \\"quit\\" beziehungsweise \\"qwhuit\\", dessen erster Teil pfeifend und dessen zweiter Teil ansteigend ist. Der Fledermausaar droht damit potentiellen Nesträubern oder hassenden Vögeln., Der Einstufung des Fledermausaars als insgesamt wenig lautfreudigen Vogel widersprechen Beobachtungen aus Neuguinea, wo von ruffreudigen Fledermausaaren berichtet wird. Dabei riefen die Vögel vor allem in der Morgendämmerung, am späten Nachmittag und während der Balz mit einer Serie von fünf \\"kie\\"-Rufen, ähnlich denen anderer Habichtartigen., Verbreitung und Wanderungen., Das stark disjunkte Verbreitungsgebiet umfasst das zentrale und westliche Afrika südlich der Sahara, kleine Bereiche Madagaskars, die Malaiische Halbinsel und große Teile Indonesiens sowie den Südosten Neuguineas. In Afrika südlich der Sahara bestehen Verbreitungslücken vor allem in trockenen Gebieten, dem Horn von Afrika sowie im südlichen Namibia, Botswana und Südafrika. In Madagaskar beschränkt sich die Verbreitung auf wenige, kleinräumige Gebiete in Küstennähe. In Südostasien ist die Art auf der gesamten malaiischen Halbinsel sowie Sumatra, Bangka, Natuna und Sulawesi heimisch, wobei unklar ist, ob die letztere Insel zum Brutgebiet gehört; auf Borneo fehlt er im Inselinneren und im Nordwesten., Das neuguineische Verbreitungsgebiet umfasst lediglich einen Teil des Owen-Stanley-Gebirges im Südosten der Insel. Im Norden wird es vom Flusslauf des Kumusi begrenzt, im Süden reicht es bis Port Moresby., Generell gilt der Fledermausaar in seinem Verbreitungsgebiet als Standvogel. Größere Individuenzahlen im südwestlichen Madagaskar im Südwinter und Sichtungen einzelner Vögel außerhalb des Verbreitungsgebiets im südlichen und östlichen Afrika werden jedoch als Hinweise auf ein gewisses Zugverhalten gedeutet. Festgestellt wurden zudem Abwanderungen aus höheren Lagen in Täler und ins nahegelegene Tiefland, die offenbar mit vergleichbaren Wanderungsbewegungen von Fledermäusen korrespondieren., Lebensraum., Der Fledermausaar ist als Baumbrüter auf einen für die Brut geeigneten Baumbestand angewiesen. Gleichzeitig benötigt er für die Jagd aber auch ausreichend große Freiflächen, die ihm das Manövrieren im Flug ermöglichen. Ein dritter Standortfaktor sind Fledermausquartiere und -jagdplätze in nicht zu weiter Entfernung., Das Spektrum der besiedelten Habitate umfasst vorwiegend feuchte, im Tiefland gelegene Waldränder, Flusstäler oder mit Bäumen durchsetztes Hügelland. Eher selten ist der Fledermausaar in trockenem Buschland anzutreffen. Die Art ist offenbar tolerant gegenüber Eingriffen in ihren Lebensraum: Auch Rodungsinseln, stark aufgelichteter Wald, Kultur- und sogar urbane Landschaften wie Dorfplätze mit Baumbewuchs, städtische Parks, Baumbestände entlang von Bahngleisen oder Vorortsiedlungen werden besiedelt., Als Jagdreviere dienten ursprünglich vor allem Gewässer, über denen sich in der Dämmerung verstärkt Insekten und damit auch Fledermäuse sammeln. Aus diesem Grund werden offenbar auch Galeriewälder und andere Vegetationsformen entlang von Flussläufen in großen Teilen des Verbreitungsgebiets bevorzugt. In urbaner Umgebung nutzt der Fledermausaar aber auch Straßenlaternen oder Gleisbeleuchtungen als Anziehungspunkt für Fledermäuse. Fledermausquartiere in Form von Höhlen, stillgelegten Minenschächten, Gebäuden oder Affenbrotbäumen sind in einer Vielzahl von Habitaten zu finden und schränken das Spektrum der möglichen Lebensräume dadurch nur gering ein. Nachgewiesen wurde die Art bis auf Meereshöhen von 2000m., Lebensweise., Jagd und Ernährung., Tagsüber verweilt der Fledermausaar in aufrechter Schlafstellung im Geäst von Bäumen am Waldrand oder im Nest, selbst außerhalb der Brutzeit. Dabei hat er die weißen Augenlider geschlossen, möglicherweise dient die Gefiederzeichnung um die Augen dazu, geöffnete Augen zu simulieren und potentielle Fressfeinde abzuschrecken., Der Fledermausaar beginnt bei Sonnenuntergang für etwa 20–30 Minuten sein Gefieder zu putzen. Erspäht er ein potentielles Beutetier, bricht er gleich aus seiner Ruheposition zum Jagdflug auf, ansonsten patrouilliert er über Wasserflächen, über denen Fledermäuse nachts Insekten jagen. Die Jagd findet in der Regel in der Abenddämmerung statt, kann sich aber an künstlichen Lichtquellen noch bis in die Nacht und bis zur Morgendämmerung hinziehen. Sobald er ein Beutetier ausgemacht hat, beschleunigt er seinen Flug und stößt dann meist von hinten und oben auf die Beute. Anschließend führt er sie zum Kopf und verschlingt sie noch während des Flugs als Ganzes, was ungefähr 3–8 Sekunden dauert. Ist die Beute zu groß, um sie am Stück zu verschlingen, trägt der Fledermausaar sie zu seiner Warte, um sie dort zu verzehren. Die Erfolgsrate bei der Jagd liegt bei etwa 50 %. Ein großer Teil der gegriffenen Fledermäuse wird wieder fallen gelassen, etwa wenn sie zu groß für ihn sind., Der überwiegende Teil der Beute wird innerhalb von 15–30 Minuten nach: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Fledermausaar, Greifvogel, Habichtartige, Verbreitungsgebiete, tropische Wälder, Fledermäuse, Flügelknochen, Nominatform, DNA-Analysen, Flugbild"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Familienmitglied der Karolinger, Franke, Geboren im 9. Jahrhundert, Gestorben 876, Herrscher (9. Jahrhundert), Herzog (Bayern), Klostergründer, König (Bayern), König (Franken), Lotharingien], Ludwig II. der Deutsche (* um 806; † 28. August 876 in Frankfurt am Main) aus dem Adelsgeschlecht der Karolinger wurde 817 von seinem Vater Ludwig dem Frommen als Unterkönig von Baiern eingesetzt, das er ab 826 selbstständig regierte. Von 843 bis 876 war Ludwig König des Ostfrankenreiches., Nach langwierigen Auseinandersetzungen mit seinem Vater und seinen Brüdern erhielt Ludwig 843 im Vertrag von Verdun das ostfränkische Reich. Seine Versuche, 858/59 das westfränkische Reich seines Halbbruders Karl des Kahlen zu erobern, blieben erfolglos. Die 860er Jahre waren durch eine schwere Krise mit den ostfränkischen Großen und Rebellionen der Söhne geprägt. Im Vertrag von Meerssen gelang es ihm 870, das östliche Lotharingien für das ostfränkische Reich zu gewinnen. Um das Kaisertum und Italien bemühte er sich hingegen vergeblich. Im Osten konnte Ludwig nach jahrzehntelangen Konflikten mit den Mährern 874 einen längerfristigen Friedensschluss erreichen. Durch einen Rückgang der Schriftlichkeit in Verwaltung und Regierung sowie eine Zunahme von Ritualen weist Ludwigs Herrschaftszeit bereits in die Ottonenzeit voraus., Im 19. und frühen 20. Jahrhundert wurde oftmals die Aufteilung des Fränkischen Reichs durch den Vertrag von Verdun als Beginn der deutschen Geschichte angesehen. Seit den 1970er Jahren hat sich die Auffassung durchgesetzt, dass das deutsche Reich nicht durch einen Akt, sondern in einem langen Prozess entstand. Gleichwohl wird Ludwigs ungewöhnlich lange Herrschaftszeit als wichtige Etappe in dieser Entwicklung angesehen. Unter seiner Regierung und der seiner Brüder Karl im Westfrankenreich und Lothar I. im sogenannten Mittelreich begann der Zerfall des fränkischen Großreiches, der letztlich die Voraussetzung für die Entstehung der späteren Nationalstaaten Deutschland, Frankreich und Italien war., Leben., Herkunft und Jugend., Ludwig der Deutsche entstammte dem Geschlecht der Karolinger, die seit 751 die fränkische Königswürde innehatten. Als Sohn Ludwigs des Frommen war er ein Enkel Karls des Großen. Er ging aus der ersten Ehe seines Vaters mit der Fränkin Irmingard von Hespengau hervor. Von den Kindern aus dieser Ehe erreichten neben Ludwig noch zwei Söhne, Lothar I. und Pippin I., sowie zwei Töchter, Rotrud und Hildegard, das Erwachsenenalter. Seine ersten Lebensjahre verbrachte Ludwig in Aquitanien am Hof seines Vaters. Laut Wilfried Hartmann sind die Quellen für Kindheit, Erscheinungsbild und Persönlichkeit durch topische Herrscherpanegyrik verzerrt. Dennoch ließen sich individuelle Züge aus dem Quellenmaterial erschließen, darunter Ludwigs Begeisterung für Waffen und seine „besondere Fähigkeit, mit Menschen umzugehen, die sich in den Konflikten mit seinen Söhnen bewährte“. Außerdem sei Ludwig sehr fromm gewesen und habe eine besondere Verehrung für die Mönche sowie Interesse an theologischen Fragen gezeigt., Im Jahr 814 machte Ludwig der Fromme seine beiden älteren Söhne Lothar und Pippin zu Unterkönigen in Baiern und Aquitanien. Ludwig der Deutsche blieb als jüngster Sohn noch mehrere Jahre am Hof seines Vaters in Aachen. In der Ordinatio imperii teilte Ludwig der Fromme 817 sein Reich unter den Söhnen auf. Lothar I. erhielt als ältester Sohn den größten Teil des Reiches, die jüngeren Söhne mussten sich mit Aquitanien und Baiern abfinden. Ludwig der Deutsche erhielt neben Baiern, Kärnten und Böhmen noch weitere Grenzgebiete im Osten. In seinem Reich sollte er aber nicht selbständig herrschen, sondern seinem Bruder Lothar Rechenschaft ablegen. Ohne dessen Einwilligung sollte er weder Krieg führen noch Frieden schließen dürfen. Im Innern konnte er aber geistliche und weltliche Ämter eigenverantwortlich vergeben. 824 nahm er an einem Kriegszug in die Bretagne teil., Erst 826 kam Ludwig erstmals in sein Königreich Baiern. 827 ehelichte er mit der Welfin Hemma eine Schwester der Kaiserin Judith, seiner Stiefmutter, die sein Vater in zweiter Ehe geheiratet hatte. 828 und 829 unternahm er ohne großen Erfolg zwei Feldzüge gegen die Bulgaren, die in Pannonien eindringen wollten. Während seiner Zeit als Unterkönig versuchte er seine Herrschaft auf das Rhein-Main-Gebiet auszudehnen., Kampf um das Erbe Ludwigs des Frommen., Im Juni 823 ging aus der Ehe Ludwigs des Frommen mit Judith noch der Sohn Karl (der Kahle) hervor. In Worms wies Ludwig 829 dem sechsjährigen Karl Alemannien, Rätien, das Elsass und einen Teil Burgunds zu. Daraufhin verbündeten sich die drei älteren Söhne und rebellierten gegen ihren Vater, um ihre Reichsteile zu sichern. Auf dem Lügenfeld von Colmar setzten sie sich im Juni 833 kampflos durch, da Ludwig der Fromme von seinem Heer verlassen wurde. Nach diesen Ereignissen änderte Ludwig der Deutsche seine Herrschertitulatur. Zuvor hatte er den Titel eines Königs in Baiern geführt und in der Datierung seiner Urkunden die Herrscherjahre seines Vaters mitgezählt. Ab Oktober 833 titulierte er sich \\"rex in orientali Francia\\" (König im östlichen Frankenreich). Im ostfränkischen Reich behielt aber Ludwig der Fromme bis zu seinem Tod die Prärogative bei der Einsetzung von Äbten und Bischöfen; Ludwig der Deutsche konnte diese Ämter nur mit kaiserlicher Zustimmung vergeben. Auf einer Bischofsversammlung im Oktober 833 wurde Ludwig der Fromme abgesetzt. Die rebellischen Söhne konnten sich allerdings nicht über die Herrschaftsgebiete einigen. Lothar I. versuchte sich einen Vorrang gegenüber seinen Brüdern zu verschaffen. Ludwig der Deutsche und Pippin I. betrieben daraufhin die Wiedereinsetzung ihres Vaters. Im März 834 wurde Ludwig der Fromme wieder als Kaiser anerkannt. In den kommenden Jahren versuchte Judith ihrem heranwachsenden Sohn Karl einen möglichst großen Anteil am Reich zu verschaffen. Neue Möglichkeiten zur Versorgung ihres Sohnes ergaben sich für Judith durch Pippins Tod im Dezember 838. Pippins ältester Sohn Pippin II. meldete Ansprüche auf das Erbe seines Vaters an, gestützt auf starken Rückhalt in Aquitanien. Aquitanien wurde aber Karl dem Kahlen zugesprochen., Nach dem Tod Pippins I. beabsichtigte Ludwig der Fromme eine Zweiteilung zwischen Lothar I. und Karl entlang der Linie Maas-Saône-Rhone. Ludwig der Deutsche sollte auf Baiern beschränkt bleiben, was ein schwerer politischer Rückschlag für ihn gewesen wäre, zumal er nach der Rebellion von 833/34 wieder die Gunst seines Vaters besessen und ihn auch unterstützt hatte. Der erneute Verlust der väterlichen Gunst hing auch mit den Interessen mehrerer ostfränkischer Großer zusammen, die von denen Ludwigs des Deutschen abwichen. Anfang 840 unternahm Ludwig der Deutsche einen Feldzug gegen seinen Vater nach Alemannien. Er trat aber kampflos den Rückzug an, als der Kaiser mit einem Heer anrückte. Am 20. Juni 840 starb Ludwig der Fromme in Ingelheim., Vertrag von Verdun (843)., Nach dem Tod Kaiser Ludwigs des Frommen erhob Lothar Anspruch auf alle in der Ordinatio von 817 festgelegten Kaiserrechte. Daraufhin verbündeten sich Ludwig der Deutsche und Karl der Kahle. Lothar I. ging mit seinem Neffen Pippin II., dem Sohn des 838 verstorbenen Pippin I., ein Bündnis ein. In der Schlacht von Fontenoy kämpften Ludwig der Deutsche und Karl der Kahle im Juni 841 erfolgreich gegen Lothar I. und Pippin II. Beide Seiten erlitten schwere Verluste. Nach den Fuldaer Annalen war es das größte Blutbad, das die Franken seit Menschengedenken erlebt hatten. Zugleich war es Ludwigs letzte Schlacht in den Kämpfen um die Reichsteilung. Den von Lothar I. daraufhin in Sachsen geförderten Stellinga-Aufstand schlug Ludwig blutig nieder., Ludwig und Karl bekräftigten ihr Bündnis am 14. Februar 842 in Straßburg vor ihren Heeren durch wechselseitige Eide. Der beim Chronisten Nithard überlieferte volkssprachliche Wortlaut stellt „das älteste Denkmal der französischen und ein frühes der deutschen Sprache“ dar. Lothar I. ließ Pippin fallen und vereinbarte mit seinen Brüdern eine Dreiteilung. Im Sommer 842 setzten Friedensverhandlungen ein. Ausgangspunkt für die Regelung der Einzelheiten waren die bestehenden Herrschaftsrechte Lothars in Italien, Ludwigs in Baiern und Karls in Aquitanien. Der Wortlaut des im August 843 geschlossenen Vertrages von Verdun ist nicht überliefert. Die Annales Bertiniani geben den Inhalt des Vertrages zumindest in groben Zügen wieder. Lothar wurde das Reich in der Mitte zugeteilt, in dem sich die Kaiserstädte Aachen und Rom befanden. Es erstreckte sich von der Nordsee bis nach Unteritalien und war wegen seiner Ausdehnung schwer zu beherrschen. Wirtschaftlich und kulturell am bedeutendsten war das Teilreich Karls des Kahlen. Das umfangreiche Königsgut im Westen des Karolingerreiches hatte schon den Merowingern als Herrschaftsgrundlage gedient. Karl musste aber seine Herrschaft in Aquitanien erst noch gegenüber seinem Neffen Pippin II. durchsetzen. Ludwigs Teilreich war wirtschaftlich, kulturell und administrativ weit weniger entwickelt als Westfranken oder Italien. Als Ausgleich erhielt er einige linksrheinische Gebiete, darunter die drei bedeutenden Bischofsstädte Mainz, Worms und Speyer mit ihrem Hinterland. Wohl auch wegen der geringen Aussicht auf Beute war sein Teilreich weniger durch die Normannen bedroht. Im Innern standen Adel und Kirche erheblich geschlossener hinter dem Herrscher als im Westen. Bei der Aufteilung des Reiches waren nicht sprachliche Unterschiede ausschlaggebend; entscheidend war vielmehr die Versorgung der eigenen Gefolgsleute., Die drei Brüder hielten 844 in Diedenhofen, 847 und 851 jeweils in Meerssen Treffen ab, auf denen sie „Frieden und Eintracht“ bekräftigten sowie sich „Rat und Hilfe“ zusicherten. Damit sollte gegen die Normanneneinfälle, die die einzelnen Teilreiche der Brüder bedrohten, ein wirkungsvolles Vorgehen gesichert werden. In einer rangbewussten Gesellschaft bevorzugte man bei Herrschertreffen Grenzorte, um die Gleichrangigkeit deutlich zu machen. Die Dreiertreffen fanden jedoch alle im Mittelreich statt. Neben der verkehrsgünstigen Lage dürfte auch Lothars Rang als Ältester und Kaiser entscheidend gewesen sein., Herrschaftsstruktur und Herrschaftspraxis., Itinerar und königliche Zentralorte., Durch die geringe Zahl von 172 Königsurkunden aus 50 Herrschaftsjahren lässt sich kein detailliertes Bild von Ludwigs Aufenthaltsorten im ostfränkischen Reich erstellen. Zum Vergleich sind es bei Ludwig dem Frommen 18, bei seinem Stiefbruder Karl dem Kahlen 12 Urkunden pro Jahr.

Benannt ist er nach Euklid von Alexandria, der ihn als Erster im dritten Jahrhundert v.Chr. in seinen Elementen bewies. Jedoch kannten die Mathematiker der Antike das Konzept der Unendlichkeit noch nicht. Euklid selbst formulierte den Satz daher wie folgt: „Es gibt mehr Primzahlen als jede vorgelegte Anzahl von Primzahlen.“, Eine Primzahl ist eine ganze Zahl \\"größer als\\" 1, die nur durch 1 und sich selbst ohne Rest teilbar ist. Die ersten Primzahlen sind 2, 3, 5 und 7. Der Satz des Euklid besagt, dass die Liste 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17… aller Primzahlen nicht endet, genauso wie die Liste 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6… aller natürlichen Zahlen nicht endet., Der ursprüngliche von Euklid geführte Beweis ist direkt und konstruktiv. Zu einer gegebenen \\"endlichen\\" Liste von Primzahlen wird stets eine weitere noch nicht vorhandene Primzahl erzeugt, ohne diese jedoch explizit anzugeben. Vielmehr wird argumentiert, dass jede endliche Liste von Primzahlen unvollständig ist. Daraus wird gefolgert, dass es unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt. In der späteren Literatur wird oft fälschlicherweise behauptet, dass Euklids Argument anhand eines Widerspruchsbeweises aufgeführt sei. Jedoch lässt sich der Beweis leicht zu einem Widerspruchsbeweis umformulieren., Nach dem Fundamentalsatz der Arithmetik können alle natürlichen Zahlen größer als 1 eindeutig in Primfaktoren zerlegt werden. Der Satz des Euklid ist daher eines der grundlegendsten Resultate der Zahlentheorie, da er zeigt, dass es unendlich viele unzerlegbare Grundbausteine der Zahlen gibt. Im Laufe der Zeit wurden neben Euklids Originalbeweis zahlreiche andere Beweise gefunden, die teilweise mathematische Techniken aus der Analysis, Kombinatorik oder auch der Topologie nutzen. Ab dem 19.Jahrhundert konnten zudem mit den Beweisen des Dirichletschen Primzahlsatzes und des Primzahlsatzes weitreichende Verallgemeinerungen erzielt werden. Während der Satz des Euklid lediglich aussagt, dass die Anzahl der Primzahlen unendlich groß ist, formulieren die modernen Primzahlsätze Regeln, wie häufig Primzahlen in gewissen Bereichen ungefähr anzutreffen sind., Analoge Fragestellungen hinsichtlich der Häufigkeit von Primzahlzwillingen, Mersenne-Primzahlen oder Fermat-Primzahlen verbleiben bis heute unbeantwortet., Beweis von Euklid., Der Satz wurde erstmals in Euklids Elementen im neunten Buch, Proposition 20, niedergeschrieben., Originalformulierung., Euklids Ausführung kann wie folgt ins Deutsche übersetzt werden:, Erläuterungen: Zu jeder endlichen Menge von Primzahlen (gegebenes Objekt) gibt es danach eine Primzahl (gesuchtes Objekt), die dieser Menge nicht angehört. Euklid beweist dies konstruktiv, indem er ein Verfahren beschreibt, aus gegebenen endlich vielen Primzahlen formula_1 (Euklid behandelt hier den Fall formula_2) eine neue Primzahl zu gewinnen, indem man die Zahl formula_3 bildet und einen ihrer Primfaktoren bestimmt. Im Beweis wird geometrisch-anschaulich argumentiert, indem gesagt wird, dass eine Strecke (Zahl) eine andere „misst“, wenn letztere durch erstere teilbar ist. In Euklids Ausführungen geht ferner sein bereits in \\"Buch VII, Proposition 31\\" (die lautet: \\"Jede zusammengesetzte Zahl wird von irgendeiner Primzahl gemessen\\") beschriebenes Verfahren zur effektiven Gewinnung eines Primfaktors einer vorgegebenen Zahl als „Unterprogramm“ ein. Da Euklid im Originalwerk keine Möglichkeit hatte, eine willkürliche Liste von Primzahlen zu schreiben, verwendete er eine Methode, die er häufig anwandte, nämlich die Methode des verallgemeinerbaren Beispiels. Dabei wählt er nur drei Primzahlen aus und beweist mit der oben skizzierten allgemeinen Methode, dass er immer eine zusätzliche Primzahl finden kann. Euklid ging vermutlich davon aus, dass seine Leser davon überzeugt wären, dass ein ähnlicher Beweis funktionieren wird, egal wie viele Primzahlen ursprünglich ausgewählt werden., Veranschaulichung des Beweises an einem Beispiel., Die Beweisidee von Euklid lässt sich über folgendes Beispiel veranschaulichen. Dieses verwendet die ersten drei Primzahlen 2, 3 und 5. Aus diesen kann mit Euklids Methode eine neue Primzahl konstruiert werden, die in der Liste noch nicht vorkommt. Dafür wird die Zahl, betrachtet, die aus dem Produkt der Listenzahlen mit anschließender Addition von 1 gebildet wird. Diese Zahl 31 ist nun weder durch 2 noch durch 3 noch durch 5 teilbar. Das folgt daraus, dass die Differenz zweier Zahlen mit gemeinsamem Teiler wieder diesen Teiler hat: Es ist formula_5 nach Konstruktion durch 2, 3 und 5 teilbar– hätte auch ihr Nachfolger 31 diese Eigenschaft, so auch formula_6 Doch die 1 wird nur von 1 selbst geteilt. In der Tat ist 31 zum Beispiel wieder eine (neue) Primzahl und ungleich 2, 3 und 5., In heutiger Fachsprache., Trotz Euklids direkter Argumentation wird der Satz des Euklid von vielen Autoren in Standardwerken der Zahlentheorie als ein Widerspruchsbeweis wiedergegeben, zum Beispiel bei Jörg Brüdern oder Tom M.Apostol., In der Sprechweise der heutigen Mengenlehre stellt Euklid die folgende Behauptung auf:, Dazu bildet Euklid das kleinste Vielfache formula_11 aller Primzahlen aus formula_12 Dabei ist wichtig, dass \\"alle\\" bisherigen Primzahlen Teiler von formula_13 sind., Dann bildet er formula_14 und unterscheidet zwei Fälle:, Der Beweis kommt auch ohne die Fallunterscheidung aus:, Beurteilung des Beweises., Von Euklid wird oft fälschlicherweise berichtet, er habe sein Ergebnis durch Widerspruch bewiesen, beginnend mit der Annahme, dass die ursprünglich betrachtete endliche Menge \\"alle\\" Primzahlen enthält, obwohl es sich eigentlich um einen Beweis durch Fallunterscheidung, also eine direkte Beweismethode handelt. Der Philosoph Torkel Franzén stellte fest: „Euklids Beweis, dass es unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt, ist kein indirekter Beweis […]. Das Argument wird manchmal als indirekter Beweis formuliert, indem man es durch die Annahme ersetzt: ‚Angenommen formula_29 sind alle Primzahlen.‘ Da diese Annahme jedoch nicht einmal im Beweis verwendet wird, ist die Neuformulierung sinnlos.“, Benno Artmann sieht im Beweis von Euklid ein Beispiel der Verwendung „endlicher Mittel zur Beherrschung des Unendlichen“. In dieser Hinsicht habe Euklid „Bahnbrechendes“ geleistet. Jedoch bildeten die Primzahlen nur ein Beispiel dieses Prinzips in Euklids Schaffen. Im selben Kontext wird seine Theorie der Parallelen und Kreistangenten sowie „Unvereinbarkeit“ (im Sinne des Euklidischen Algorithmus) von Artmann genannt., Die Zahlentheoretiker Gérald Tenenbaum und Michel Mendès France nennen Euklids Argument „wundervoll in seiner Schönheit und Einfachheit“ und weisen darauf hin, dass es sich in moderner Fachsprache auf die vier Symbole, reduzieren lässt. Dabei ist formula_31 die Fakultät von formula_32 und die erzeugte Zahl ist durch \\"keine\\" Zahl zwischen formula_33 teilbar, weshalb es Primzahlen geben muss, die größer als formula_32 sind., Der Beweis von Euklid wird, hinsichtlich der fundamentalen Bedeutung des Resultats für die Zahlentheorie, wegen seiner Einfachheit bis heute als elegant erachtet. Dennoch liefert er keine starke Methode, zu schätzen, wie viele Primzahlen es unter einer Schranke formula_35 mindestens gibt. Zwar kann die Schranke formula_36, mit der Primzahlen abzählenden Funktion formula_37, induktiv aus Euklids Methode abgeleitet werden, doch dieses Resultat wird für die analytische Zahlentheorie als unbrauchbar angesehen. Dabei ist formula_38 der natürliche Logarithmus von formula_35. Bereits mit nicht wesentlich schwierigeren Argumenten, zum Beispiel durch Ideen von Leonhard Euler und Pafnuti Lwowitsch Tschebyschow, können wesentlich stärkere Schranken für die Primzahlverteilung hergeleitet werden. Dazu zählt die Schranke, für existierende Konstanten formula_41 für alle formula_42., Bedeutung., Erzeugung neuer Primzahlen., Der Beweis des Satzes des Euklid zeigt eine Möglichkeit auf, wie aus einer oder mehreren vorgegebenen Primzahlen formula_43 mindestens eine weitere Primzahl berechnet werden kann. Dazu bildet man das Produkt dieser Zahlen und addiert 1 zu dem Produkt, also, Das Symbol formula_45 ist das Produktzeichen. Wegen formula_46 gibt es einen kleinsten Teiler formula_47 von formula_32. Dieser ist notwendigerweise eine Primzahl und teilerfremd zu formula_49. Daher ist mit formula_50 eine \\"neue\\" Primzahl gefunden., Zieht man nur die Mengen der ersten aufeinanderfolgenden Primzahlen in Betracht, also formula_51, und bildet daraus die Zahlen, dann stellen sich die ersten fünf dieser Zahlen als prim heraus, die nächsten fünf als zusammengesetzt. Beispielsweise ist, Ist das Ergebnis von formula_54 wobei das Symbol formula_55 für das Primorial von formula_56 steht, wieder eine Primzahl, so nennt man diese auch Euklidische Primzahl. Ein etwas verallgemeinerter Begriff ist die Primorial-Primzahl, die durch formula_57 erzeugt wird. Es ist eine offene Frage, ob es unendlich viele Primorial-Primzahlen gibt. Die bis heute größte gefundene Primorial-Primzahl ist die formula_58-stellige Zahl formula_59. Zum Überprüfen, ob eine Zahl prim ist, gibt es Primzahltests, wie den von Miller-Rabin. Die bis heute größte gefundene Primzahl ist jedoch die formula_60-stellige Mersenne-Primzahl formula_61., Zahlentheoretische Forschung., Die Aussage, dass es unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt, führte zu der Frage, wie dicht sie in den natürlichen Zahlen liegen. Damit ist das langfristige Verhalten der Abstände zwischen verschiedenen Primzahlen gemeint. Zum Beispiel finden sich bis zur Zahl 10000 nur einhundert Quadratzahlen, also viel weniger als natürliche Zahlen. Analog dazu kann gefragt werden, wie häufig Primzahlen bis zu einer Schranke (wie zum Beispiel 10000) auftauchen und wie sich diese Häufigkeit verhält, wenn die Schranke immer größer gewählt wird., Eine Folgerung des Beweises von Euklid für die Folge der Primzahlen ist die Ungleichung, Diese konnte von Bonse weiter verbessert werden zu, für alle formula_64 was auch Bonsesche Ungleichung genannt wird.

Diese auch Flattertiere genannte Ordnung umfasst damit die einzigen Säugetiere, die aktiv fliegen können. Sie sind, neben den Vögeln, die einzigen Wirbeltiere, die dazu in der Lage sind., Weltweit gibt es rund 1.000 Fledermausarten bei insgesamt 6.596 Säugetierarten., Der Name bedeutet „Flattermaus“ (, zu ahd. \\"fledarōn\\" „flattern“)., Verbreitung., Fledermäuse sind nahezu weltweit verbreitet, sie kommen auf allen Kontinenten der Erde mit Ausnahme der Antarktis vor. Auch in anderen polaren Regionen sowie auf entlegenen Inseln fehlen sie. Auf manchen Inseln (zum Beispiel Neuseeland) waren sie dagegen bis zur Ankunft des Menschen die einzigen Säugetiere. Die Fledermausgattung der Mausohren (\\"Myotis\\") ist die ohne menschlichen Einfluss am weitesten verbreitete Säugergattung überhaupt, ebenfalls sehr weit verbreitet sind die Bulldoggfledermäuse (Molossidae) und die Glattnasen-Freischwänze (Emballonuridae)., In Europa sind etwa 40 Arten verbreitet, davon knapp 30 auch in Mitteleuropa. In Österreich sind 29 Fledermausarten heimisch., Eine Liste der Fledermausarten findet sich im Abschnitt Systematik., Merkmale., Allgemein., Fledermäuse sind im Durchschnitt etwas kleiner als Flughunde. Als größte Fledermausart gilt die Australische Gespenstfledermaus (\\"Macroderma gigas\\"), die eine Kopf-Rumpf-Länge von 14 Zentimetern, eine Spannweite von 60 Zentimetern und ein Gewicht von 200 Gramm erreichen kann. Die kleinste Fledermaus ist die Schweinsnasenfledermaus (\\"Craseonycteris thonglongyai\\"), auch bekannt als Hummelfledermaus, mit einer Kopf-Rumpf-Länge von drei Zentimetern und einem Gewicht von zwei Gramm. Sie gilt neben der Etruskerspitzmaus als kleinstes Säugetier überhaupt., Die Skelettelemente sind meistens sehr dünn und zart ausgebildet, wodurch das Gewicht gering gehalten wird., Fledermäuse besitzen ein dichtes, oft seidiges Fell, das meistens grau bis braun oder schwärzlich gefärbt ist und keinen Haarstrich aufweist. Es gibt aber auch weiße und gemusterte Arten, bei fast allen Arten ist zudem die Bauchseite heller als der Rücken. Anders als andere Säugetiere besitzen sie kein Wollhaar, die Fellhaare sind arttypisch aufgebaut und besitzen kleine Schuppen, sie können zur Bestimmung der Arten dienen., Extremitäten., Auffälligstes Merkmal der Fledermäuse ist, wie bei den Flughunden, die Flughaut, die sie zum aktiven Fliegen befähigt. Die Flughaut besteht aus zwei Hautschichten und erstreckt sich von den Handgelenken bis zu den Fußgelenken (\\"Plagiopatagium\\"). Weitere Häute erstrecken sich von den Handgelenken zu den Schultern (\\"Propatagium\\"), zwischen den Fingern (Dactylopatagium) sowie den Beinen. Die Unterste wird \\"Uropatagium\\" (Schwanzflughaut) genannt, sie bindet den Schwanz – sofern vorhanden – mit ein und dient oft zum Einkeschern der Beute. In der Flughaut befinden sich Muskelstränge zur Stabilisation und zum Einschlagen der Flügel sowie Nervenfasern und Blutgefäße zur Versorgung der Flughaut., Der Daumen ist kurz – bei den Stummeldaumen (Furipteridae) fehlt er– und trägt eine Kralle; die vier übrigen Finger sind stark verlängert und spannen die Flughaut. Ebenfalls verlängert sind der Ober- und der Unterarm, der nur noch aus einem Knochen, der Speiche (Radius), besteht, während die Elle (Ulna) im mittleren Teil reduziert ist. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten Flughundarten fehlt bei den Fledermäusen die Kralle am zweiten Finger; dieser besteht bei ihnen nur aus einem langen Fingerglied. Ein Dorn am Fußgelenk, Calcar genannt, dient zum Aufspannen der Schwanzflughaut, dieser ist bei einigen Arten noch durch einen steifen Hautlappen, das Epiblema, ergänzt., Die Hinterbeine der Fledermäuse sind im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Säugetieren durch eine Drehung des Beines im Hüftgelenk nach hinten gerichtet, sie enden in fünf bekrallten Zehen. Diese dienen in der Ruhephase zum Aufhängen im Quartier, wobei eine besondere Konstruktion der Krallensehnen ein passives Festhalten ohne Muskelanspannung ermöglicht – dadurch bleiben auch tote Tiere hängen., Kopf und Sinne., Die Köpfe der verschiedenen Fledermausarten unterscheiden sich beträchtlich. Während manche an Gesichter anderer Tiere erinnern – zum Beispiel an Mäuse, darum auch der Name dieser Gruppe –, haben andere besondere Strukturen entwickelt. Viele Arten haben Nasenblätter oder andere Gesichtsstrukturen, die zum Aussenden oder Verstärken der Ultraschallxadlaute dienen. Die Ohren, die bei manchen Arten drastisch vergrößert sind, sind oft mit Rillen oder Furchen versehen, darüber hinaus haben sie einen Tragus, einen Ohrdeckel, der der Verbesserung der Echoortung dient. Fledermäuse können schwarz-weiß sehen, und wie aufgrund jüngster Untersuchungen festgestellt wurde, können einige Arten auch UV-Licht sehen, das von einigen Blüten verstärkt reflektiert wird, die sie dann zur Nektaraufnahme anfliegen. Zusätzlich verfügen Fledermäuse über einen Magnetsinn. Bei Langstreckenflügen orientieren sie sich an den Linien des Erdmagnetfeldes, ähnlich wie Zugvögel und viele andere Tierarten. Es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass der Magnetsinn durch Magnetit entsteht., Fledermäuse besitzen im Normalfall ein Gebiss aus 32 bis 38 Zähnen, wobei besonders die Eckzähne stark ausgeprägt sind. Diese dienen den meisten Arten zum Aufbrechen des Chitinxadpanzers ihrer Beuteinsekten und den frugivoren zum Festhalten der Früchte. Die sanguinivoren (blutleckenden) Arten verwenden zum Anritzen des Wirts entgegen dem weit verbreiteten Glauben die unteren Schneidezähne. In Anpassung an die unterschiedlichen Ernährungsweisen variiert der Aufbau des Gebisses allerdings erheblich, sodass sich aus der ursprünglichen Zahnformel 2133/3133 = 38 insgesamt über 50 verschiedene Varianten entwickelt haben. Besonders wenige Zähne weist der Gemeine Vampir (\\"Desmodus rotundus\\") mit einer Zahnformel von 1111/2121 = 20 auf., Die Augen sind meistens sehr klein, schwarz und besitzen wimpernlose Augenlider. Im Mundbereich und bei einigen Arten auch im Bereich der Nase besitzen die Tiere Vibrissen, also empfindliche Sinneshaare. Durch Drüsen im Mundbereich sezernieren die Tiere ein öliges Sekret, welches zur Pflege der Flughäute eingesetzt wird und wahrscheinlich auch arttypische Geruchsstoffe enthält. Weitere Duftdrüsen sitzen je nach Art an weiteren Stellen des Gesichts, an den Schultern oder an anderen Körperstellen., Geschlechtsunterschiede., Fledermäuse besitzen keine auffälligen Geschlechtsunterschiede. Die ausgewachsenen Weibchen sind in der Regel zwar etwas größer als die Männchen, dies kann jedoch nur durch genaue Messungen festgestellt werden. Erst bei der genauen Betrachtung der Genitalregion ist der Penis der Männchen erkennbar. Dieser wird durch einen kleinen Penisknochen (Baculum) stabilisiert. Der Penis ist, wie auch beim Menschen, freihängend (Penis pendulum). Dies ist im Tierreich recht ungewöhnlich. Bei einigen Arten treten besonders zur Paarungszeit auch die Hoden und Nebenhoden deutlich hervor., Bei säugenden Weibchen erkennt man außerdem die gut ausgebildeten Brustdrüsen, die nahe den Achselhöhlen liegen. Bei den meisten Arten sind nur zwei Zitzen ausgebildet, manche Arten besitzen jedoch auch vier. Bei einigen Familien sind außerdem paarige Haftzitzen ohne Milchabgabe im Bereich der Leiste ausgebildet, an denen sich die Jungtiere festklammern können., Lebensweise., Die perfekte Anpassung der Fledermäuse an die Luft als Lebensraum prägt auch ihre Lebensweise., Ernährung., Die meisten Fledermausarten ernähren sich von Insekten (Gliederfüßer), die sie teilweise im Flug erbeuten. In den Tropen und Subtropen gibt es viele vegetarisch lebende Arten, die Früchte fressen oder Nektar trinken. Diese Arten spielen eine wichtige Rolle für die Pflanzen, deren Blüten sie bestäuben (Chiropterophilie) und deren Samen sie verbreiten (Chiropterochorie)., Größere Arten der Familien Großblattnasen, Schlitznasen und Blattnasen fressen auch kleinere Säugetiere wie Nagetiere und andere Fledermäuse, kleinere Vögel, Frösche, Mäuse und Fische. Die größten Arten wie die Große Spießblattnase fressen Vögel bis zur Größe von Tauben. Unter anderem dienen die von der Beute ausgestoßenen Laute wie auch deren Geruch zur Identifikation., Die drei Arten der Vampirfledermäuse (Desmodontinae) ernähren sich vom Blut anderer Tiere., Fortbewegung., Die Hauptfortbewegungsart der Fledermäuse ist das Fliegen, zu dem sie durch den Besitz der Flughäute und verschiedene weitere Anpassungen befähigt sind. Dabei handelt es sich bei schmalflügeligen Arten meistens um schnelle Flieger, die vor allem in offenem Gelände leben, bei breitflügeligen Arten um Langsamflieger in strukturreichen Lebensräumen; manche Fledermäuse beherrschen den Rüttelflug, um Ausschau nach Beute halten zu können, etwa das Braune Langohr. Beim Flug werden die Flügel in einer Rotationsbewegung geschlagen, wobei der kräftige Abschlag vor dem Kopf geschieht und die Flügel dann im hinteren Bereich des Körpers wieder hochgezogen werden. Die Schwanzflughaut dient dabei als Manövrierhilfe und zum Abbremsen., Die anatomischen und physiologischen Anpassungen an diese Fortbewegung sind vielfältig. So besitzen die Fledermäuse einen sehr voluminösen Brustkorb mit einem Brustbein, das in Konvergenz zu dem der Vögel einen Kiel als erweiterte Ansatzstelle für die Flugmuskulatur aufweist, außerdem ist die Wirbelsäule im Brustbereich stark vorgebogen. Während des Fluges werden die Atem- und die Herzschlagfrequenz stark erhöht, um den Sauerstoffbedarf zu decken. Das Herz ist zudem stark vergrößert und hat etwa das dreifache Volumen zu dem anderer Säugetiere gleicher Größe, außerdem ist die Anzahl der roten Blutkörperchen (Erythrozyten) sowie der Hämoglobinxadanteil stark erhöht, sodass etwa doppelt so viel Sauerstoff im Blut gebunden werden kann wie bei vergleichbaren Tieren. Zur Abkühlung dienen temperaturabhängig erweiterte Blutgefäße in den Flughäuten, in den: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Alternatives Taxon, Fledermausschutz, Fledertiere, Höhlentier, Säugetier, Flattertiere, Flughunde, Chiroptera, Fledermäusarten, Ultraschalllaute"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Abgegangenes Bauwerk in Bayern, Baudenkmal in Bayern, Ehemaliger Kanal, Erbaut in den 1840er Jahren, Flusssystem Regnitz, Gewässer im Landkreis Bamberg, Gewässer im Landkreis Eichstätt, Gewässer im Landkreis Erlangen-Höchstadt, Gewässer im Landkreis Forchheim, Gewässer im Landkreis Kelheim], Der Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal (auch Ludwigskanal oder regional „Alter Kanal“ genannt) war im 19. und 20.Jahrhundert eine 172,4km lange Wasserstraße zwischen der Donau bei Kelheim und dem Main bei Bamberg. Im weiteren Sinne war der zwischen 1836 und 1846 erbaute Kanal Teil einer schiffbaren Verbindung zwischen der Nordsee bei Rotterdam und dem Schwarzen Meer bei Constanța. Durch die Überquerung der Europäischen Hauptwasserscheide nahm das ehrgeizige Bauvorhaben eine besondere Stellung ein. 100Schleusen, teilweise in den Flüssen Altmühl und Regnitz, bewältigten insgesamt einen Höhenunterschied von 264Metern (80m Aufstieg von der Donau und 184m Abstieg zum Main). Nachfolger des 1950 aufgelassenen Kanals ist der 1960 bis 1992 errichtete Main-Donau-Kanal., Zwischen Beilngries und Nürnberg ist der Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal im historischen Umfang und mit einigen Funktionen weitgehend erhalten. Er wurde 2018 von der Bundesingenieurkammer als \\"Historisches Wahrzeichen der Ingenieurbaukunst\\" ausgezeichnet., Verlauf., Der Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal, der bis auf zwei Abschnitte nicht mehr schiffbar ist, begann offiziell bei Kilometer0 an der Abzweigung aus der Donau in Kelheim. In der niederbayerischen Stadt befindet sich in einem kurzen Verbindungskanal von der Donau zur Altmühl die Schleuse1 und an deren Oberhaupt der ehemalige Kanalhafen. Für den weiteren Verlauf wurde das Bett der Altmühl bis km32,9 und Schleuse13 bei Dietfurt an der Altmühl schiffbar gemacht. Anschließend begann der Stillwasserkanal, der zunächst weiter in westlicher Richtung bis Beilngries im Ottmaringer Tal verlief. Das Kanalbett des Ludwigskanals zwischen Kelheim und Beilngries wurde in den 1980er und 1990erJahren größtenteils durch dessen historischen Nachfolger, den Main-Donau-Kanal(MDK), überbaut., Noch vor Beilngries zweigt der Verlauf des Alten Kanals nach Norden ab. Das heute weitgehend erhaltene, aber trockene Kanalbett folgt parallel dem wenige hundert Meter westlich verlaufenden Main-Donau-Kanal und der Sulz. Nördlich von Beilngries beginnt ein etwa 65km langer Abschnitt, in dem der Kanal noch heute Wasser führt und die meisten Bauwerke wie Schleusen und Brücken erhalten sind. Bei Mühlhausen (Oberpfalz) verlässt der neue Kanal die Route des historischen Vorgängers, die weiter nach Norden bis Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz führt., Vor Neumarkt in der Gemeinde Sengenthal erreicht der Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal nach Schleuse32 und einem bewältigten Höhenunterschied von 80Metern seine Scheitelhaltung. Auf (Wasserspiegelhöhe) überquert dieser 24Kilometer lange Teil des Kanals noch heute die Europäische Hauptwasserscheide. Bei Berg bei Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz verläuft dieser Abschnitt nach Westen. Die folgende Schleuse 33 befindet sich erst bei km85,8 bei Burgthann im Landkreis Nürnberger Land., Der Ludwigskanal erreicht über Röthenbach bei Sankt Wolfgang, Wendelstein und Worzeldorf das Stadtgebiet Nürnbergs. Nach Schleuse72 (km108,2) verschwindet das Wasser des Kanals in einem Überlaufbauwerk und einem Rohr, das zum westlich gelegenen Main-Donau-Kanal führt. Der Kanal folgt heute im weiteren Verlauf einem 1,5km langen Alleeweg in Nürnberg-Gartenstadt. Das Kanalbett wurde hier mit Erde aufgeschüttet, die heute von Gras bedeckt ist. Kanalweg und Schleusen sind hier dennoch gut zu erkennen., Es folgt ein etwa 40km langer Abschnitt, der in den 1960er Jahren fast komplett von der Bundesautobahn 73 (Frankenschnellweg) überbaut wurde. Lediglich einige Reste wie Grenzsteine oder das Kanaldenkmal in Erlangen erinnern zwischen Nürnberg und Forchheim an den einst hier verlaufenden Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal. Ab Neuses an der Regnitz folgte die Wasserstraße wiederum dem heutigen Verlauf des Main-Donau-Kanals. Zwischen Forchheim und Bamberg existieren noch einige trockengelegte Schleusen und Schleusenwärterhäuser. Im Bamberger Stadtteil Bug mündete der Ludwigskanal bei Schleuse99 und km169,3 in die Regnitz. Der eigentliche Stillwasserkanal erreichte damit eine Länge von 136,4km., Die Wasserstraße folgte dem westlichen Arm der Regnitz, die sich vor der Bamberger Innenstadt teilt. Nach der heute noch genutzten Schleuse100 hatte die Wasserstraße am sogenannten Nonnengraben endgültig das Niveau der Regnitz erreicht. Dadurch konnte das letzte Hindernis, das Bamberger Mühlenviertel, umfahren werden. Der von der Scheitelhaltung bis hier überwundene Höhenunterschied betrug 184Meter. In einigen Quellen wird auch die sogenannte \\"Schleuse101\\" erwähnt. Durch ein ab 1858 errichtetes Stauwehr und diese Schleuse konnte die Regnitz bis zur Mainmündung bei Bischberg von Kanalschiffen befahren werden., Kurzübersicht nach Orten., Verlauf von Kelheim über Alt-Essing, Neu-Essing, Burg Randeck, Burg Prunn, Riedenburg, Untereggersberg, Obereggersberg, Deising, Meihern, Mühlbach, Griesstetten, Dietfurt, Töging, Ottmaring, Beilngries, Biberbach, Plankstetten, Berching, Mühlhausen, Buchberg, Neumarkt, Holzheim, Berg, Rasch, Schwarzenbach, Burgthann, Pfeifferhütte, Gugelhammer, Röthenbach, Wendelstein, Worzeldorf, Gibitzenhof, Nürnberg, Eberhardshof, Doos, Fürth, Steinach, Herboldshof, Erlangen-Eltersdorf, Bruck, Erlangen, Möhrendorf, Baiersdorf, Kersbach, Forchheim, Neuses, Altendorf, Hirschaid, Strullendorf nach Bamberg., Planung und Bau., Vorgeschichte., Die süddeutsche Landschaft war in der Frühzeit noch eine schwer zugängliche Wildnis. Für die ersten Siedler waren die Flussläufe von Altmühl und Regnitz oft die einzigen Durchgangswege. Die Idee zum Bau einer schiffbaren Verbindung zwischen den Flüssen Rhein bzw. Main und Donau wurde bereits zur Zeit des Fränkischen Reiches erstmals verwirklicht. Gängige Theorien gehen davon aus, dass Karl der Große, damals noch König der Franken, im Jahr 793 die sogenannte Fossa Carolina (auch Karlsgraben genannt) errichten ließ. Diese Verbindung, damals noch mit Dämmen und Rollen statt Schleusen, verband die Altmühl mit der Schwäbischen Rezat in der Nähe des heutigen Ortes Treuchtlingen. Das Projekt konnte sich jedoch nicht durchsetzen und wurde schon kurz nach seinem Bau wieder aufgegeben. Es gibt aber auch andere Theorien, die von einer längeren Nutzungsdauer sprechen. Im dünn besiedelten Europa der folgenden Jahrhunderte verfolgte man keine ähnlichen Projekte mehr., Erst im 17.Jahrhundert, nach dem Ende des Dreißigjährigen Krieges, wurden Überlegungen zur Schaffung einer solchen Wasserstraße wieder lebendig. So schlug 1656 Eberhard Wasserberg aus Emmerich dem Fürstbischof zu Eichstätt Marquard II. Schenk von Castell eine „Conjunction des Rheinstrombs Donawflusses und anderer kleiner Wasser …“ vor. Dieser veranlasste mit einem Empfehlungsschreiben an Bürgermeister und Rat der Stadt Nürnberg, dort seine Idee vorzutragen., Der Alchemist und Wirtschaftstheoretiker Johann Joachim Becher beschrieb in seinem 1688 veröffentlichten Buch \\"Politische Discvrs Von den eigentlichen Ursachen des Auf- und Abnehmens der Städte, Länder und Republiken\\" einen „Kurtzen doch gründlichen Entwurff Aller derer Utilitäten, so aus der Vereinigung des Rheins mit der Donau vermittelst Schiffreichmachung und Vereinigung der Tauber und Wernitz …“., Auch im 18.Jahrhundert entstanden verschiedene Vorschläge und Projekte zur Überwindung der Wasserscheide. Christop Zippel und Georg Zacharias Hans regten in ihrer 1720 in Regensburg erschienenen Schrift \\"Dissertatio Historica De Danubii Et Rheni Coniunctione\\" eine Wiederaufnahme der Idee Karls des Großen an. Eine Illustration zeigt unter anderem die Darstellung eines Schiffshebewerks an der Fossa Carolina nach der Vorstellung des 18.Jahrhunderts. 1729 illustrierte Johann Georg Eckardt in seinem Beitrag \\"Conspectus Fossae Carolinae pro conjunctione Danubii et Rheni\\" ein ähnliches Konzept., Nach der Französischen Revolution und mit Beginn der Industrialisierung Deutschlands im 19.Jahrhundert gab es weitere Untersuchungen und Planungen. Der Nürnberger Jurist Michael Georg Regnet schlug 1801 in seinem Werk \\"Einige Fingerzeige zur Beförderung des großen Projektes die Donau mit dem Rheine zu vereinigen\\" vor, einen Kanal im Gebiet des später realisierten Ludwigskanals anzulegen. Auch Carl Friedrich von Wiebeking, kam 1806 nach einer Reise in das Gebiet der Fossa Carolina zu dem Schluss, eine Verbindung von Altmühl und Roth sei die günstigste Lösung. Durch die Napoleonischen Kriege traten diese und weitere Projekte wieder in den Hintergrund., Ludwig-Donau-Main-Kanal., Bereits im Jahr seiner Thronbesteigung 1825 beauftragte König Ludwig I. von Bayern den königlichen Baurat Heinrich Freiherr von Pechmann, Pläne für einen neuerlichen Versuch zu entwerfen. Von Pechmann schloss die Planung, bei der er sich für die Strecke Kelheim-Bamberg entschied, schon 1830 ab, 1832 wurde sie publiziert., 1834 erließ LudwigI. das \\"Gesetz, die Erbauung eines Kanals zur Verbindung der Donau mit dem Main betreffend\\" und 1835 wurde ein Actienverein gegründet, der die Finanzierung des Kanalprojektes sicherstellen sollte., Am 1.Juli 1836 begannen die auf sechs Jahre veranschlagten Arbeiten und bereits Ende 1839 waren die Erdarbeiten nahezu erledigt, nur an größeren Dämmen musste noch längere Zeit gearbeitet werden. Nach einem Zeitungsbericht von Ende 1840 waren 90 Schleusen fertiggestellt, „die Schiffsziehwege in der ganzen Länge des Kanals chaussirt und die Dämme berast, die Ufer mit Fruchtbäumen besetzt; sämtliche Schleußen- und Kanalwärterhäuser waren zum Theil der Vollendung nahe“., Ab 1839 traten jedoch immer wieder Probleme auf – kleinere Dammbrüche waren zu beheben. Zum Jahresende 1842 war der Kanal immerhin „an den meisten Stellen so weit gediehen, daß er für die Schifffahrt tauglich erschien“. Dennoch wurde Pechmann 1843 als Erster Vorstand der Kanalbaudirektion in den Ruhestand versetzt. Die Probleme beim Bau des Kanals, speziell der nötige Abbruch und Wiederaufbau des Schwarzach-Brückkanals, werden neben Unstimmigkeiten mit Leo von Klenze, dem Vorstand der Obersten Baubehörde, als Gründe für die Entlassung angeführt. Verzögert wurde die Fertigstellung auch durch den Einbau zusätzlicher Stauwehre in der Altmühl, der durch die Erfahrungen nach einer Dürre im Jahre 1842: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Bauwerk Bayern, Baudenkmal Bayern, Kanalbauwerk, 1840er Jahre, Regnitz Flusssystem, Landkreis Bamberg, Landkreis Eichstätt, Landkreis Erlangen-Höchstadt, Landkreis Forchheim, Landkreis Kelheim"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Dreiecksgeometrie, Satz (Ebene Geometrie)], Der Satz des Pythagoras (auch Hypotenusensatz) ist einer der fundamentalen Sätze der euklidischen Geometrie. Er besagt, dass in allen ebenen rechtwinkligen Dreiecken die Summe der Flächeninhalte der Kathetenquadrate gleich dem Flächeninhalt des Hypotenusenquadrates ist. Sind formula_1 und formula_2 die Längen der am rechten Winkel anliegenden Seiten, der Katheten, und formula_3 die Länge der dem rechten Winkel gegenüberliegenden Seite, der Hypotenuse, dann lautet der Satz als Gleichung ausgedrückt:, Der Satz ist nach Pythagoras von Samos benannt, der als Erster dafür einen mathematischen Beweis gefunden haben soll, was allerdings in der Forschung umstritten ist. Die Aussage des Satzes war schon lange vor der Zeit des Pythagoras in Babylon und Indien bekannt, es gibt jedoch keinen Nachweis dafür, dass man dort auch einen Beweis hatte., Mathematische Aussage., Der Satz des Pythagoras lässt sich folgendermaßen formulieren:, In geometrischer Deutung ist demnach in einem rechtwinkligen Dreieck die Summe der Flächen der beiden Quadrate über den Katheten gleich der Fläche des Quadrats über der Hypotenuse., Die Umkehrung des Satzes gilt ebenso:, Eng verwandt mit dem Satz des Pythagoras sind der Höhensatz und der Kathetensatz. Diese beiden Sätze und der Satz des Pythagoras bilden zusammen die Satzgruppe des Pythagoras. Der unten beschriebene Kosinussatz ist eine Verallgemeinerung des pythagoreischen Satzes., Verwendung., Längen im rechtwinkligen Dreieck., Aus dem Satz des Pythagoras folgt direkt, dass die Länge der Hypotenuse gleich der Quadratwurzel aus der Summe der Kathetenquadrate ist, also, Eine einfache und wichtige Anwendung des Satzes ist, aus zwei bekannten Seiten eines rechtwinkligen Dreiecks die dritte zu berechnen. Dies ist durch Umformung der Gleichung für alle Seiten möglich:, Die Umkehrung des Satzes kann dazu verwendet werden, zu überprüfen, ob ein gegebenes Dreieck rechtwinklig ist. Dazu wird getestet, ob die Gleichung des Satzes für die Seiten bei dem gegebenen Dreieck zutrifft. Es reicht also allein die Kenntnis der Seitenlängen eines gegebenen Dreiecks, um daraus zu schließen, ob es rechtwinklig ist oder nicht:, Aus dem Satz des Pythagoras folgt, dass in einem rechtwinkligen Dreieck die Hypotenuse länger als jede der Katheten und kürzer als deren Summe ist. Letzteres ergibt sich auch aus der Dreiecksungleichung., Reziproke Längen im rechtwinkligen Dreieck., Aus dem Satz des Pythagoras folgt als direkte Anwendung der reziproke Satz des Pythagoras:, Sind formula_1 und formula_2 die Längen der Katheten und formula_29 die Länge der Höhe auf der Hypotenuse in einem rechtwinkligen Dreieck formula_30, dann sind formula_31 und formula_32 die Kathetenlängen und formula_33 die Hypotenusenlänge eines zu formula_30 ähnlichen rechtwinkligen Dreiecks formula_35., Somit folgt: formula_36., Wegen der Rechtwinkligkeit gilt für die Flächenmaßzahl des Dreiecks ABC die Gleichheit formula_37 oder formula_38., Durch Division der Pythagorasgleichung auf beiden Seiten durch formula_39 und Einsetzen von formula_40 für formula_3 ergibt sich die Aussage des Satzes aus folgender Äquivalenzkette:, formula_42, Pythagoreische Tripel., Unter allen Dreiergruppen formula_43, die die Gleichung formula_4 erfüllen, gibt es unendlich viele, bei denen formula_1, formula_2 und formula_3 jeweils ganze Zahlen sind. Diese Dreiergruppen werden pythagoreische Tripel genannt. Das einfachste dieser Tripel besteht aus den Zahlen formula_19, formula_20 und formula_21. Pythagoreische Tripel werden seit alters her zur Konstruktion rechtwinkliger Dreiecke verwendet. Ein Beispiel ist die Zwölfknotenschnur, mit der ein Dreieck gelegt wird, dessen Seiten die Längen formula_19, formula_20 und formula_21 haben. Die beiden kurzen Seiten bilden dann einen rechten Winkel., Der große fermatsche Satz besagt, dass die formula_54-te Potenz einer Zahl, wenn formula_55 ist, nicht als Summe zweier Potenzen des gleichen Grades dargestellt werden kann. Gemeint sind ganze Grundzahlen formula_56 und natürliche Hochzahlen. Allgemein gesprochen bedeutet dies:, Das ist erstaunlich, weil es für formula_60 unendlich viele Lösungen gibt. Für formula_61 sind dies die pythagoreischen Zahlentripel., Trotz seiner einfachen Formulierung gilt der Beweis des großen fermatschen Satzes, der erst 1995 erbracht werden konnte, als außerordentlich schwierig., Euklidischer Abstand., Der Satz von Pythagoras liefert eine Formel für den Abstand zweier Punkte in einem kartesischen Koordinatensystem. Sind zwei Punkte formula_62 und formula_63 in einer Ebene gegeben, dann ist ihr Abstand formula_3 durch, gegeben. Hierbei wird ausgenutzt, dass die Koordinatenachsen senkrecht zueinander liegen. Diese Formel kann auch auf mehr als zwei Dimensionen erweitert werden und liefert dann den euklidischen Abstand. Zum Beispiel gilt im dreidimensionalen euklidischen Raum, Das entspricht auch dem Betrag bzw. der Länge des durch die beiden Punkte definierten Vektors., Beweise., Für den Satz sind mehrere hundert Beweise bekannt, womit er wohl der meistbewiesene mathematische Satz ist. Elisha Scott Loomis führt in einem zuerst 1927 erschienenen Buch 371 Beweise auf. Mario Gerwig führt in einer Überarbeitung und Ergänzung der Loomis-Sammlung rund 365 verschiedene Beweise auf, wobei er Loomis rund 360 Beweise zuordnet und eine ganze Reihe von Fehlern, darunter auch der Aufnahme offensichtlich falscher Beweise. Exemplarisch werden im Folgenden sechs geometrische Beweise vorgestellt. Ein siebter Beweis aus dem Jahr 1875 von James A.Garfield findet sich unter Beweis des Satzes des Pythagoras nach Garfield, der dem \\"Beweis durch Ergänzung\\" stark ähnelt., Beweis nach Euklid., Euklid beschreibt den Satz des Pythagoras mit dem folgenden Beweis im ersten Buch seiner Elemente in der Proposition 47. Dort beweist er zunächst den Kathetensatz mit Hilfe kongruenter Dreiecke, aus welchem dann unmittelbar der Satz des Pythagoras folgt. Der Beweis benutzt nicht die Theorie der Proportionen, die Euklid im Buch 5 der Elemente entwickelt, sondern kommt allein mit den Sätzen des ersten Buches der Elemente aus und ist von konstruktiver Natur., Für ein Dreieck formula_30 mit rechtem Winkel in formula_68 sind formula_69 und formula_70 die Quadrate über den Katheten und formula_71 der Fußpunkt der Höhe von formula_68 auf formula_73. Des Weiteren sind formula_74 und formula_75 Rechtecke über der Hypotenuse formula_73 deren längere Seite formula_77 die Länge der Seite formula_73 besitzt. Nun sind die Dreiecke formula_79 und formula_80 nach dem zweiten Kongruenzsatz (SWS) kongruent, da formula_81, formula_82 und formula_83 gilt. Zudem gilt, dass die Fläche des Dreiecks formula_79 die Hälfte der Fläche des Rechtecks formula_74 beträgt, da dessen Grundseite formula_73 und die Rechteckseite formula_87 gleich lang sind und die Länge seiner Höhe von formula_68 der Länge der anderen Rechteckseite entspricht. Aufgrund eines entsprechenden Arguments folgt, dass die Fläche des Dreiecks formula_80 der Hälfte der Fläche des Kathetenquadrates formula_70 entspricht. Wegen der Kongruenz der Dreiecke formula_79 und formula_80 bedeutet dies aber, dass dann auch das Kathetenquadrat formula_70 flächengleich mit dem Rechteck formula_74 ist. Analog lässt sich mit Hilfe der kongruenten Dreiecke formula_95 und formula_96 zeigen, dass das zweite Kathetenquadrat formula_69 flächengleich mit dem Rechteck formula_75 ist. Damit hat man den Kathetensatz bewiesen. Der Satz des Pythagoras folgt dann sofort, da das Hypotenusenquadrat sich aus den Rechtecken formula_74 und formula_75 zusammensetzt., Es gibt noch einen weiteren Beweis des Satzes von Pythagoras in den Elementen in Buch 6, Proposition 31 (siehe unten). Er benutzt statt Quadraten zueinander ähnliche Rechtecke auf den drei Seiten, ist formal einfacher als der Beweis im ersten Buch durch Verwendung der Theorie der Proportionen, die erst von Eudoxos von Knidos streng begründet wurde. Pythagoras kann beide Beweise aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach nicht gekannt haben, da sie einem fortgeschritteneren Verständnis der Geometrie entsprechen Proklos schrieb die Beweise in seinem Kommentar zu den Elementen explizit Euklid zu und drückte seine Bewunderung für beide Beweise aus., Euklid gibt in der letzten Proposition 48 von Buch 1 zusätzlich eine Umkehrung des Satzes von Pythagoras, indem er zeigt, dass aus der Gleichheit der Fläche des Hypotenusenquadrats mit der der Summe der Kathetenquadrate folgt, dass einer der Winkel des Dreiecks ein rechter Winkel ist., Der erste Beweis (I, 47) wird wegen der Form der Hilfslinien in der zugehörigen Figur im englischen Sprachraum gelegentlich auch \\"windmill\\" (Windmühle) genannt, Arthur Schopenhauer nahm den ersten Beweis von Euklid als Beispiel für dessen in seiner Sicht willkürliche und wenig anschauliche Vorgehensweise (\\"„Oft werden, wie im Pythagoreischen Lehrsatze, Linien gezogen, ohne dass man weiss warum: hinterher zeigt sich,dass es Schlingen waren, die sich unerwartet zuziehen“\\", und so die Zustimmung Lernenden erzwingen, \\"„der nun verwundert zugeben muß, was ihm seinem inneren Zusammenhang nach völlig unbegreiflich bleibt“\\") Felix Klein verteidigte den Beweis dagegen in einer Erwiderung auf Schopenhauers Kritik als besonders anschaulich und demonstrierte dies in seiner \\"Elementarmathematik vom höheren Standpunkt\\"., Beweis durch Addition abgeleiteter Flächeninhalte., Der in den beiden nebenstehenden Bildern auf unterschiedlicher Weise verdeutlichte \\"Beweis durch Addition abgeleiteter Flächeninhalte\\", stammt aus dem chinesischen Werk Zhoubi suanjing, übersetzt \\"Klassische Arithmetik des Gnomon und die Kreisbahnen des Himmels\\" (es wird heute angenommen das Werk „stamme frühestens aus dem späten 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr.“). Darin kommt das allgemein bekannte rechtwinklige Dreieck mit den Seiten formula_101 und formula_102 zur Anwendung., Nach dem Zeichnen eines Quadrats (Bild 1) und dessen Unterteilung in formula_103 x formula_104 Einheitsquadrate, wird das rechtwinklige Ausgangsdreieck (rot) mit den Katheten formula_105, formula_106 und mit der sich ergebenden Hypotenuse formula_3 anhand des Gitters eingetragen. Darüber hinaus werden drei, dem Ausgangsdreieck gleichende Dreiecke so platziert, dass die Hypotenusen ein inneres Quadrat ergeben und demzufolge ein zentrales Einheitsquadrat (gelb) mit dem Flächeninhalt formula_108 umgrenzen. Ein auf das innere Quadrat eingezeichnetes Gitter, das dem äußeren gleicht und mit den Hypotenusen einen rechten Winkel einschließt, liefert formula_21 x formula_110 Einheitsquadrate., Der Flächeninhalt des inneren Quadrats mit den vier Dreiecken und dem zentralen Einheitsquadrat entspricht formula_111 Einheitsquadrat: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Сара обвиняла Драко Малфоя, успешного владельца одного из самых престижных модных домов, в краже дизайна для своей новой коллекции. Гермиона знала, что этот случай несет в себе не только потенциальные судебные проблемы, но и возможность показать всем свои адвокатские способности. Благодаря своим знаниям законодательства, а также умелому преодолению коварных интриг и теневых развязок, она всегда стремилась добиться справедливости. Приготовившись к делу и со всеми документами, Гермиона появилась в офисе Драко, решительно готовая разоблачить его воровство и вернуть украденные идеи ее клиентке. Но когда их взгляды встретились, все оказалось совсем не так, как она представляла. Драко Малфой, прекрасный и загадочный мужчина, привлекательность которого была почти магнетической, производил на нее эффект, который Гермиона не ожидала. Под его идальней внешностью была твердая воля и остроумие, и Гермиона почувствовала, что у нее возникло что-то большее, чем простое профессиональное взаимодействие. На протяжении долгого расследования, Гермиона и Драко постепенно узнали друг друга все глубже и сталкивались с преградами, которые только усилили их соприкасающиеся мировоззрения. Зло и предрассудки старого феодализма со стороны Драко, и представления о справедливости и социальной ответственности с самой Гермионы. Оба они преодолевали сомнения и страхи, чтобы наконец осознать, что стоять вместе они сильнее. Гермиона и Драко, каждый из них, понимали насколько разные были сферы их деятельности. Они узнали, насколько захватывающим мог быть амбициозный мир моды и насколько тяжело бывало принять выбор между интересами и идеалами. Однако, они решили, что любой компромисс потеряет в своей ценности, и выбор должен быть сделан в пользу правды. В итоге, благодаря решительности и умению Гермионы, Драко признал свою вину и принял ответственность за свои действия. Их профессиональное столкновение, оказалось залогом для появления прекрасной и способной любви, которая озарила и согрела сердца обоих героев. И, несмотря на разногласия между двумя мирами, Гермиона и Драко поняли, что их силы слишком сильны, чтобы их разделить. Они стали неразлучными партнерами, не только в суде, но и в жизни, и вместе достигли высот, о которых никто из них не мог даже мечтать.

Она была в курсе работы Сары Миллер, дизайнера, известного своим уникальным стилем и смелыми экспериментами. Гермиона никогда не была особо интересована модой, но от природы была предана справедливости и честности, что делало ее идеальной для решения конфликтов подобного рода. Подняв трубку, Гермиона услышала голос Сары – звучащий уставшим и возмущенным. \\"Гермиона, я обращаюсь к вам с просьбой о помощи.

While the specific history of this particular pie is not well-documented, it is a variation of the traditional angel food cake recipe. The angel food cake itself has a notable history that dates back to the 19th century. The origins of angel food cake can be traced to the United States, where it gained popularity during the late 1800s. It was known for its light and fluffy texture, which earned it the name \\"angel food\\" due to its resemblance to the ethereal nature associated with angels. Angel food cake was traditionally made with simple ingredients such as egg whites, sugar, flour, and a few flavorings like vanilla or almond extract. The egg whites were beaten until they formed stiff peaks, giving the cake its airy structure, while the sugar provided sweetness and stability. The flour was sifted and gently folded into the egg white mixture to maintain the cake's lightness. As for the cherry filling, cherries have been used in desserts for centuries. In ancient times, cherries were a symbol of fertility and were believed to have medicinal properties. They were highly cherished by the Romans and Greeks and often featured in their culinary preparations. The combination of angel food cake and cherries likely came about as people experimented with different ways to incorporate the fruit into desserts. By adding a luscious cherry filling or topping to angel food cake, the resulting \\"Angel Food Cherry Pie\\" became a delightful twist on the classic angel food cake. Over time, \\"Angel Food Cherry Pie\\" has become a beloved treat, especially during the summer months when cherries are in season. It is often served at picnics, potlucks, and family gatherings as a fruity and light dessert option.

Sources de données : - Big data : Les sources de données pour le big data peuvent provenir de diverses sources, telles que les réseaux sociaux, les capteurs, les appareils mobiles, etc. - Data warehouse : Le data warehouse collecte généralement des données provenant de différentes sources au sein d'une entreprise, telles que les systèmes de gestion des ventes, les ressources humaines, etc. - Base de données : Une base de données stocke généralement des données spécifiques provenant d'une seule application ou d'un domaine particulier. 4. Technologie et outils : - Big data : Le big data nécessite des outils et des technologies spécifiques pour gérer et analyser efficacement de grandes quantités de données non structurées, telles que Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, etc. - Data warehouse : Les data warehouses utilisent des bases de données relationnelles traditionnelles et des outils ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pour collecter, nettoyer et organiser les données. - Base de données : Les bases de données peuvent être basées sur des technologies relationnelles (SQL) ou non relationnelles (NoSQL) selon les besoins spécifiques de l'application. En résumé, les différences techniques entre le big data, le data warehouse et la base de données se résument au volume des données, à la structuration, aux sources de données et aux technologies/outils nécessaires pour les gérer et les analyser efficacement."},{"instruction":"methode merise et UML","output":"Merise et UML sont tous deux des méthodologies de modélisation utilisées dans le domaine du génie logiciel pour concevoir et représenter des systèmes d'information.

Die großflächige Anlage mit dem Schlossgebäude als Mittelpunkt und der Hofkirche als architektonischem Gegengewicht geht auf die im Kern erhaltene und von Johann Friedrich Künnecke entworfene Anlage des Jagdschlosses Klenow mit seinen umgebenden Gartenanlagen zurück und wurde später durch den Architekten Johann Joachim Busch erweitert. Eingebunden sind Schloss und Kirche in eine planmäßig angelegte Stadt, deren Hauptstraße auf den Schlossplatz zuführt. Die Anlage bildet zusammen mit der Stadt und dem Gartenbereich ein Gesamtensemble, das in dieser Ausführung in Mecklenburg einzigartig ist. Ludwigslust wird deshalb auch oft als \\"mecklenburgisches Versailles\\" oder seltener auch als \\"Sanssouci des Nordens\\" bezeichnet., Das im Schloss untergebrachte Museum ist einer der Standorte des Staatlichen Museums Schwerin. Das Schloss ist Eigentum des Landes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; Schloss und Sammlung werden durch die Landesbehörde Staatliche Schlösser, Gärten und Kunstsammlungen Mecklenburg-Vorpommern verwaltet., Hinsichtlich seiner regionalen kulturhistorischen Bedeutung ist das Ludwigsluster Schloss mit den Residenzschlössern Güstrow, Schwerin und der einstigen Residenz Neustrelitz vergleichbar., Geschichtlicher Überblick., Ein Jagdschloss als Ursprung., Der spätere Residenzort Ludwigslust geht auf ein im 14. Jahrhundert erstmals erwähntes Gutsdorf namens \\"Klenow\\" oder auch \\"Kleinow\\" zurück, das Herzog Friedrich Wilhelm I. 1708 als Apanage seinem jüngeren Bruder Christian Ludwig II. überschrieb. Der im benachbarten Grabow residierende Prinz plante 1721 erstmals einen Jagdsitz in der wildreichen Gegend um Klenow. Nachdem das Grabower Schloss im Juni 1725 bei einem Stadtbrand zerstört worden war, schritten die Ausbaupläne für Klenow voran, scheiterten in ihrer Umsetzung jedoch vorerst an einem Streit mit dem mittlerweile regierenden Herzog Karl Leopold. Dieser war als mittlerer der drei überlebenden Brüder 1713 dem kinderlosen Friedrich WilhelmI. auf den Thron gefolgt und verlangte, den Bau des Jagdsitzes einzustellen, den er als Affront gegen sich betrachtete. Bereits begonnene Bauteile mussten auf seine Weisung wieder abgetragen werden. Karl Leopold hatte sich einige Jahre zuvor während des Großen Nordischen Krieges mit dem Kaiser überworfen, was 1728 nach weiteren Willkürakten auch in seinem Herrschaftsgebiet selbst zu seiner Amtsenthebung durch den Reichshofrat führte. Der Bau in Klenow konnte dadurch für den nunmehr eingesetzten Christian Ludwig ab 1731 fortgesetzt werden, die Baustelle stand zunächst unter dem Schutz kaiserlicher Soldaten. Als Baumeister für den neuen Jagdsitz beauftragte Herzog Christian Ludwig den vermutlich aus dem Hannoverschen stammenden Architekten Johann Friedrich Künnecke, der in jener Zeit für den Grafen Hans Caspar von Bothmer das im Nordwesten Mecklenburgs gelegene Schloss Bothmer errichtete., Der Neubau in Klenow diente vorerst nur als Jagdhaus des nach dem Grabower Brand im Neustädter Schloss residierenden Christian Ludwig, wurde aber in den folgenden Jahren umgestaltet. Ab 1748 ließ der Herzog durch den Schweriner Hofarchitekten Jean Laurent Legeay den Französischen Garten erweitern, ab 1752 erfolgte der Ausbau des Jagdhauses. Im Jahr 1754 ließ der Herzog in den \\"Mecklenburgischen Nachrichten\\" den neuen Namen des Jagdschlosses verkünden:, Die Hauptresidenz der herzoglichen Familie blieb in jenen Jahren noch in Schwerin. Nach dem Tode Christian Ludwigs im Jahr 1756 verhinderte der ausbrechende Siebenjährige Krieg vorerst weitere Baumaßnahmen in Ludwigslust., Vom Residenzschloss zum Sommersitz., Der nachfolgende Herzog Friedrich (der Fromme) verbrachte die Kriegsjahre weitgehend in Lübeck. Zwar ließ er sich bereits 1756 durch den Hofbaumeister Jean Laurent Legeay Entwürfe für eine erste Vergrößerung des Schlosses vorlegen, zur Ausführung kamen die Pläne jedoch nicht und Ludwigslust diente in dieser Zeit vor allem als Nebenresidenz seiner jüngeren Schwester Ulrike Sophie. Die einzige größere Baumaßnahme war der Große Kanal, der später eine der Hauptachsen des neuen Gartens bilden sollte., Mit dem Ende des Siebenjährigen Krieges 1763 griff Herzog Friedrich den Gedanken einer Erweiterung des Schlossbezirks wieder auf. Die ursprüngliche Idee, die bescheidene Umbauten vorsah, genügte seinen Ansprüchen zwischenzeitlich nicht mehr. Er hatte als junger Mann eine Grand Tour durch Europa gemacht und dabei auch den Hof von Versailles in Frankreich kennengelernt, der in jener Epoche für die meisten europäischen Fürstenhöfe als Vorbild diente. Für den Jagdsitz im einstigen Klenow, das ebenso wie Versailles außerhalb der eigentlichen Hauptstadt lag, wünschte der Herzog nun eine Schlossanlage nach französischem Ideal. Dort wollte er einerseits den Regierungsgeschäften nachgehen und sich andererseits seinen naturwissenschaftlichen und musischen Neigungen hingeben. Das Schloss sollte zudem den passenden Rahmen für die bereits unter seinem Vater gegründete Kunstsammlung bieten. Das Vorhaben einer zeitgemäßen Residenz wurde von seiner Ehefrau, Herzogin Louise Friderike von Württemberg, unterstützt, die als Enkelin des Württemberger Herzogs Eberhard Ludwig eine aufwendige Hofhaltung gewöhnt war, die sie am pietistisch-nüchternen Hof ihres frommen Gatten vermisste., Herzog Friedrich bat Baumeister Legeay um neue Entwürfe, zeitgleich begann der Schweriner Hofbaumeister Johann Joachim Busch mit dem Bau einer Stadtanlage nach barockem Grundriss und einer großen Hofkirche als Gegengewicht zum Schloss. Erste Bauarbeiten begannen 1763 mit den Häusern am Bassinplatz und um den späteren Kirchhof; bereits ab 1764 verlegte Herzog Friedrich den Hof von Schwerin nach Ludwigslust. 1765 wurde unter Buschs Leitung der Grundstein der Hofkirche gelegt und nach deren Vollendung 1772 der Bau des neuen Residenzschlosses begonnen, das 1777 bezogen werden konnte. Die zahlreichen gleichzeitigen Baustellen beschäftigten mehrere hundert Maurer, Zimmerleute und andere Handwerker, die Bauern der Umgebung mussten Hand- und Spanndienste leisten und Herzog Friedrich beaufsichtigte die Arbeiten regelmäßig. Die Ausgaben für das Bauprojekt konnten dadurch begrenzt werden, dass auf teure Materialien wie Marmor und edle Hölzer weitgehend verzichtet und stattdessen Pappmaché, der sogenannte Ludwigsluster Carton, eingesetzt wurde. Die Kosten trug die herzogliche Rentkammer, deren Einnahmen Erlöse aus der Forstkasse des waldreichen Gebiets aufbesserten. Als Herzog Friedrich 1785 starb, war der Schlossbezirk weitgehend vollendet. Ludwigslust hatte sich von einem Gutsdorf zu einem kleinen Fürstenhof entwickelt, der über einen Zeitraum von rund 80Jahren das kulturelle und politische Zentrum des Landesteils Mecklenburg-Schwerin bildete., \\"Mit Friedrichs Tod ging die neue Residenz des kinderlosen Herzogs an seinen Neffen und Nachfolger Friedrich Franz I. über. Dieser ließ den kaum vollendeten Barockgarten im nunmehr zeitgemäßen Stil als Englischen Landschaftsgarten erweitern und ab 1809 die Stadtanlage durch Johann Georg Barca ausbauen. Nach Friedrich Franz Tod verlegte sein ihm folgender Enkel Paul Friedrich den Hof 1837 zurück nach Schwerin, womit Ludwigslust auf den Status einer Sommerresidenz sank. Friedrich Franz II. ließ die Gartenanlage von 1852 bis 1860 durch Peter Joseph Lenné gestalterisch überarbeiten, dennoch wurde das Schloss in der zweiten Hälfte des 19.Jahrhunderts nur noch selten bewohnt. Große Teile der Ludwigsluster Kunstsammlung kamen ab 1879 nach Schwerin. Bedeutung als dauerhafter Wohnsitz erlangte das Schloss noch einmal mit dem Ende des Ersten Weltkriegs, als es im Zuge der Abdankung und der Enteignung der Mecklenburgischen Großherzöge von Friedrich Franz IV. bezogen wurde. Einige der Innenräume konnten ab 1922 erstmals von der Öffentlichkeit besichtigt werden. Die herzogliche Familie bewohnte Ludwigslust bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs, das Schlossgebäude überstand die Kriegszeit ohne bauliche Schäden. Das bei Kriegsende zunächst von westalliierten Truppen besetzte Ludwigslust entging zudem den Verwüstungen, die zahlreiche Schloss- und Herrenhausanlagen im Osten Deutschlands durch die Rote Armee widerfuhren. Dennoch gingen Teile der beweglichen Ausstattung in der Folgezeit durch Plünderung und Vernachlässigung verloren.\\", Vom Verwaltungsbau zum Schlossmuseum., In den ersten Nachkriegsjahren beherbergte das Schloss die örtliche Kommandantur der Roten Armee. Die herzogliche Familie wurde bei der Bodenreform 1947 enteignet und das Schloss schließlich vom Kreis Ludwigslust übernommen. Anfängliche Pläne, in dem Bauwerk ein Museum einzurichten, wurden nicht weiter verfolgt; die bis dahin im Schloss verbliebenen Kunstschätze gelangten teilweise nach Schwerin oder wurden im Schloss eingelagert. Die einstige herzogliche Residenz diente in der DDR-Zeit als Sitz der Kreisbehörden; in die historischen Innenräume zogen für mehrere Jahrzehnte Staatsorgane der DDR ein., Im Jahr 1986 wurden das Schloss und die Gartenanlagen unter die Verwaltung des Staatlichen Museums Schwerin gestellt und größere Maßnahmen zur Bausicherung vorgenommen, sowie erstmals wieder Räume für die Öffentlichkeit zur Besichtigung freigegeben. Das Schloss wurde zum \\"Museum für höfische Kunst und Wohnkultur\\". Die Kreisverwaltung blieb bis 1991 im Schloss, seitdem wurde es schrittweise einer musealen Nutzung zugeführt und in Abschnitten bis Ende 2015 saniert. Die Finanzierung der Restaurierung erfolgte zum Teil mit EU-Mitteln. Die Sanierung der Fassade kostete 4,8Millionen Euro, die Restaurierung der Innenräume weitere 12Millionen Euro. Die Arbeiten an der Großen Kaskade wurden 2007 begonnen und 2010 abgeschlossen; sie kosteten rund 450.000 Euro. Schloss und Park sind zu besichtigen; bis 2005 wurden im Schlossmuseum jährlich zwischen 50.000 und 60.000 Besucher gezählt. Neben vereinzelten Sonderausstellungen organisiert ein Förderverein Schlosskonzerte und ein regelmäßiges Barockfest, weiter findet alljährlich das \\"Kleine Fest im Großen Park\\" statt.

Damit ist die Fletcher-Klasse eine der zahlenmäßig stärksten Klassen von Überwasserkriegsschiffen der Welt. Die Schiffe nahmen an allen großen Operationen der US Navy während des Pazifikkriegs teil. Die Dienstzeit in der US-Marine dauerte mit Unterbrechungen bis 1971, etliche Zerstörer wurden an andere Nationen, darunter auch Deutschland, abgegeben und blieben noch lange im aktiven Dienst.

Roosevelt davon aus, dass die Vereinigten Staaten ebenfalls in den Krieg hineingezogen würden und dass Japan der Hauptgegner sein würde. Roosevelt sah in der Aufrüstung ein Mittel zur Bekämpfung der Arbeitslosigkeit, der drohende Kriegseintritt machte jedoch deutlich, dass die Flotte tatsächlich verstärkt werden musste. Die Zerstörer der US-Marine waren zum größten Teil veraltete Modelle aus der Zeit des Ersten Weltkriegs, die Produktion der neuen Zerstörer der \\"Gleaves-\\" und der \\"Benson-Klasse\\" lief nur langsam an, die Zerstörerklassen aus der Zwischenkriegszeit waren zum größten Teil noch nach Entwürfen aus dem Ersten Weltkrieg gebaut worden oder unterlagen den Begrenzungen der Washingtoner Flottenabkommen., Die Planungen für neue Schlachtschiffe und Flugzeugträger mit einer Geschwindigkeit von über 30 Knoten machten schnelle Zerstörer mit einer Höchstgeschwindigkeit zwischen 35 und 38 Knoten erforderlich, die eine entsprechend starke Antriebsanlage benötigten. Das für die Planungen zuständige \\"General Ship Board\\" erhielt sechs verschiedene Entwürfe für die neue Schiffsklasse, die sich an den Vorgaben (1.600 Tonnen Verdrängung, vier bis fünf 5-Zoll-Geschütze, 6.500 Seemeilen Reichweite bei 12 Knoten) und den Vorgängerbauten der \\"Gleaves-\\", \\"Benson-\\" und \\"Sims\\"-Klassen orientierten. Um die Jahreswende 1939/1940 wurden drei neue Entwürfe vorgelegt, die sich gegenüber den vorherigen Entwürfen durch die Rückkehr zum Flushdecker-Konzept auszeichneten und eine gestiegene Wasserverdrängung für die geforderte Panzerung der Brücken-, Führungs- und Maschinenräume nutzten. Ebenfalls konnte so gegenüber den Vorentwürfen die Flugabwehrbewaffnung von vier 12,7-mm-Maschinengewehren mit einer 28-mm-Vierlingsflak verstärkt werden und die Antriebskraft auf 60.000 WPS für 38 Knoten Konstruktionsgeschwindigkeit gesteigert werden., Am 27. Januar 1940 fällte das \\"Board\\" seine Entscheidung für den Entwurf des renommierten Konstruktionsbüros Gibbs &amp; Cox mit fünf Einzeltürmen und vergab die Bauaufträge für die ersten 130 Schiffe der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\". Davon wurden elf Schiffe, darunter zwei Prototypen für alternative Antriebe, später wieder gestrichen. 1941 wurden 16, 1942 40 weitere Zerstörer bewilligt., Bau., Um die große Anzahl an Zerstörern innerhalb kurzer Zeit fertigzustellen, wurden die Bauaufträge an elf Werften vergeben, darunter auch solchen, die zuvor noch kein Schiff für die US-Marine gebaut hatten. Bethlehem Steel erhielt den Auftrag für 43 Schiffe und verteilte diese auf die Standorte San Francisco (18), Staten Island (15) und San Pedro (10). Mit 31 Schiffen erhielt Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine den größten Auftrag als einzelne Werft. 29 Zerstörer wurden bei der Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey gebaut, 21 bei Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding in Seattle, Washington. Im Boston Navy Yard wurden 14 Schiffe auf Kiel gelegt, bei Consolidated Steel Shipyards in Orange, Texas, zwölf, beim Charleston Navy Yard zehn, im Puget Sound Naval Shipyard acht und bei Gulf Shipbuilding in Chickasaw, Alabama sieben Zerstörer gebaut., Die Kiellegung der ersten Schiffe, USS \\"Nicholas\\" und USS \\"O’Bannon\\", erfolgte am 3. März 1941 bei Bath Iron Works. Das Typschiff, die USS \\"Fletcher\\", wurde am 2.Oktober 1941 bei Federal Shipyards in Kearny auf Kiel gelegt. Die \\"Nicholas\\" lief am 19.Februar 1942 als erstes Schiff vom Stapel, die Indienststellung erfolgte am 4.Juni 1942, dreieinhalb Wochen vor dem Typschiff der Klasse. Das letzte Schiff, die USS \\"Rooks\\", lief am 6.Juni 1944 bei Seattle-Tacoma vom Stapel., Änderungen., Noch während des Baus der ersten Einheiten flossen bereits die ersten Erfahrungen aus dem Krieg in die Konstruktion ein. Es zeigte sich, dass die ursprünglichen runden Steuerhäuser der ersten Schiffe eine schlechte Rundumsicht boten. Sie wurden daher bei den späteren Schiffen durch einen die Vorderseite umgebenden Umlauf ergänzt, der die beiden Brückennocken miteinander verband., Nur wenige Einheiten wurden mit dem ursprünglich vorgesehenen 28-mm-Vierling und 12,7-mm-Maschinengewehren ausgerüstet, ersterer wurde durch eine 40-mm-Doppellafette ersetzt, zudem gehörten nun sechs 20-mm-Flugabwehrgeschütze zum Entwurf., Der Mangel an Aluminium während des Krieges machte es nötig, die oberen Aufbauten ebenfalls aus Stahl zu fertigen, was eine Gewichtserhöhung um 50 Tonnen mit sich brachte und die Topplastigkeit der Schiffe erhöhte. Um dem entgegenzuwirken, wurde die Feuerleitanlage um zwei Meter nach unten verlegt, außerdem wurde auf einen Großteil der Panzerung der Kommandobrücke verzichtet., Dabei wurde ebenfalls die Brücke dahingehend modifiziert, dass der von Beginn an offene Umlauf ins Deckshaus integriert war. Der geschlossene Teil wurde weiter nach achtern versetzt und hatte nunmehr eine eckige Form., Mitte 1942 wurde deutlich, dass zur Koordination der Waffen und zur Verarbeitung der Informationen an Bord ein zentraler Lageraum notwendig war. Die Schiffe wurden daher mit einem Combat Information Center (CIC) nachgerüstet, das sich unterhalb der Kommandobrücke auf dem Niveau des Hauptdecks befand und in dem alle Informationen während des Gefechts zusammenliefen., Umbauten., Zweiter Weltkrieg., Schon 1940 gab es Planungen, sechs Zerstörer mit einer Bordfluganlage für ein Bordflugzeug auszurüsten, um auch kleineren Zerstörerverbänden Luftaufklärungskapazitäten zu geben. Bei fünf Schiffen (DD-476 bis DD-480) wurden während des Baus 1942/43 die notwendigen Änderungen vorgenommen, jedoch nach wenigen Monaten Ende 1943 wieder rückgängig gemacht. Gründe hierfür waren unter anderem, dass die Flugzeuge auf den kleinen Schiffen nicht mit ihrer vollen Waffenlast ausgerüstet werden konnten, aber es zeigte sich auch, dass das Konzept aufgrund der mittlerweile angewachsenen Trägerflotte und der vergrößerten Anzahl von Kreuzern und Schlachtschiffen, die Aufklärungsflugzeuge trugen, überflüssig geworden war. Dazu kam, dass eine weitere Ausrüstung der Zerstörer mit Luftabwehr aufgrund fehlender Platz- und Gewichtsreserven unmöglich war. Das sechste Schiff DD-481 wurde 1943 nicht mehr umgerüstet, sondern in der ursprünglichen Konfiguration fertiggestellt., Als Reaktion auf die verstärkten japanischen Angriffe mit Tokkotai-Fliegern (Kamikaze) wurde bei über 50 Schiffen der Fletcher-Klasse die Luftabwehrbewaffnung im Sommer 1945 drastisch verstärkt. Die Geschütze wurden zum Teil mit Radarsteuerungen ausgerüstet, viele 20-mm-Einzelgeschütze durch Doppellafetten ersetzt und die Torpedobewaffnung verringert., Kalter Krieg., Mit dem Anwachsen der Spannungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion und der sowjetischen Aufrüstung im Marinebereich wurde deutlich, dass die US-amerikanische Marine mehr U-Jagdschiffe benötigt. Aus diesem Grund wurden 1948 aus der Reserveflotte 18 eingemottete Fletcher-Zerstörer wieder reaktiviert und mit verstärkter U-Jagdbewaffnung ausgestattet., Zusätzlich zu den 18 U-Jagdzerstörern wurden zu Beginn des Koreakriegs über 60 weitere \\"Fletchers\\" aus der Reserveflotte geholt und für ihren neuen Einsatzzweck teilweise umgebaut. Bei 43 Schiffen wurde der mittlere Geschützturm entfernt, an seiner Stelle wurden zwei 76-mm-Doppellafetten installiert. Zusätzlich erhielten die Schiffe neue Feuerleitanlagen. Diese Schiffe wurden inoffiziell als \\"La-Valette-Klasse\\" bezeichnet. Die restlichen reaktivierten Schiffe behielten ihre Bewaffnung aus dem Zweiten Weltkrieg und wurden als \\"Daly-Klasse\\" bezeichnet., FRAM II., Ursprünglich war 1957 beschlossen worden, alle 18 Schiffe, die bereits 1948 den U-Jagdumbau erhalten hatten, nach FRAM II umzubauen. 1958 begann der Umbau der USS \\"Hazelwood\\", die als Testschiff für die Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter dienen sollte. In der Folge wurden drei Zerstörer (USS \\"Radford\\", USS \\"Jenkins\\" und USS \\"Nicholas\\") in Pearl Harbor umgebaut und mit einem Startplatz sowie einem Hangar für die DASH-Drohnen ausgerüstet. 1961 wurden die Umbaupläne für die 15 übrigen DDEs gestrichen, so dass es bei drei Umbauten der Fletcher-Klasse blieb. Diese Schiffe wurden inoffiziell als \\"Radford-Klasse\\" bezeichnet. Die drei Zerstörer verließen auch als erste Schiffe des FRAM-II-Programms 1969 die US-Marine., Dienstzeit., Die Zerstörer der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\" wurden zwischen 1942 und 1944 in Dienst gestellt. Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurden 145 der verbliebenen Zerstörer stillgelegt und der Reserveflotte zugeteilt. Zu Beginn des Koreakrieges wurden zusätzlich zu den 18 umgebauten U-Jagdzerstörern aus den Jahren 1948/49 über 60 weitere Zerstörer reaktiviert, 19 davon wurden nach Ende der Kampfhandlungen in Korea wieder ausgemustert. Die übrigen Zerstörer blieben bis Ende der 1960er Jahre, Anfang der 1970er Jahre in Dienst. Das letzte Schiff der Klasse, das bei der US-Marine außer Dienst gestellt wurde, war die USS \\"Mullany\\", die am 6. Oktober 1971 stillgelegt und aus den Schiffsregistern gestrichen wurde., Zwischen 1958 und 1960 wurden sechs Schiffe der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\" (USS \\"Anthony\\", USS \\"Ringgold\\", USS \\"Wadsworth\\", USS \\"Claxton\\", USS \\"Dyson\\" und USS \\"Charles Ausburne\\") als Waffenhilfe an die damals noch im Aufbau befindliche Bundesmarine übergeben, wo sie als \\"Klasse 119\\" (Schiffsnamen: Zerstörer 1 bis Zerstörer 6) bis in die 1980er Jahre im Einsatz waren. Ursprünglich als Artillerieunterstützer für amphibische Landungen gedacht, wurden sie später zumeist als U-Jagdschiffe in den NATO-Verbänden im Nordatlantik sowie zur Sicherung der Ostseezugänge eingesetzt.

Er besagt, dass eine aufsteigende arithmetische Progression unendlich viele Primzahlen enthält, wenn dies nicht aus trivialen Gründen, etwa bei formula_1, unmöglich ist. Eine arithmetische Progression ist dabei eine Folge ganzer Zahlen, sodass zwei aufeinanderfolgende Glieder stets dieselbe Differenz haben, wie zum Beispiel formula_2 Ganz allgemein ist eine solche Folge für eine ganze Zahl formula_3 und eine natürliche Zahl formula_4 gegeben durch, Die Folge ist dann im Sinne des Satzes von Dirichlet „trivial“, wenn formula_3 und formula_4 einen gemeinsamen Teiler haben, der größer als formula_8 ist. Den ersten vollständigen Beweis der Aussage lieferte Dirichlet im Jahr 1837. Dabei wurden erstmals rein analytische Methoden für die Gewinnung eines zahlentheoretischen Satzes verwendet. Die Vermutung über Primzahlen in arithmetischen Folgen stammt von Adrien-Marie Legendre aus dem Jahr 1798, der in seinem Lehrbuch der Zahlentheorie einen fehlerhaften Beweis gab, wie Dirichlet darlegte. Anwendung findet der Satz innerhalb der Zahlentheorie, etwa im Beweis des Satzes von Hasse-Minkowski., Bezogen auf das Dezimalsystem sagt der Satz aus, dass es jeweils unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt, die auf eine1, auf eine3, auf eine 7 und auf eine 9 enden. Allgemeiner kann man sagen: Gibt es zwei verschiedene Primzahlen, die in einem Zahlensystem auf die gleiche Ziffernfolge enden, so gibt es unendlich viele weitere Primzahlen, die in diesem Zahlensystem auf diese Ziffernfolge enden. Etwa gibt es unendlich viele Primzahlen, die auf die Ziffern 419 enden. Die ersten Primzahlen mit dieser Eigenschaft sind formula_9 und formula_10., Dirichlets Beweis war ein wichtiger Schritt zur Begründung der analytischen Zahlentheorie und führte zur Etablierung der Dirichletschen L-Funktionen, der Dirichlet-Charaktere und der analytischen Klassenzahlformel für quadratische Zahlkörper. Die Einführung der L-Funktion geschah in Analogie zu Leonhard Eulers Einführung der Zetafunktion bei der Primzahlverteilung. Tatsächlich konnte Dirichlet eine etwas stärkere Formulierung als die bloße Unendlichkeitsaussage gewinnen, denn er lieferte eine Verallgemeinerung des Satzes von Euler über Primzahlen: Addiert man also die Kehrwerte formula_11 aller Primzahlen formula_12 in der betroffenen arithmetischen Progression, ist das Ergebnis Unendlich. Diese Aussage impliziert die Unendlichkeit der entsprechenden Primzahlmenge, aber es existieren ganz allgemein unendlich lange Zahlfolgen, die in ihrer Kehrwertsumme beschränkt sind. Dirichlet zeigte dafür als entscheidenden Zwischenschritt das Nicht-Verschwinden der Dirichletschen L-Funktion an der Stelle formula_8. Hierbei wurde die Bedeutung des Nullstellenverhaltens von L-Funktionen in Form sog. \\"Nichtverschwindungssätze\\" für die Zahlentheorie erstmals offenkundig., Im Laufe der Zeit konnte der Satz immer weiter verbessert werden. So schätzt etwa der Primzahlsatz für arithmetische Progressionen die genaue Anzahl der Primzahlen in einer arithmetischen Folge, die eine obere Schranke nicht überschreiten. Eine Folgerung ist, dass bei fester Wahl von formula_4 in unterschiedlichen Folgen stets asymptotisch gleich viele Primzahlen liegen. Der Fehlerterm in dieser beschriebenen Primzahlverteilung ist Gegenstand des Satzes von Siegel-Walfisz, des Satzes von Bombieri und Winogradow und der Vermutung von Elliott und Halberstam. Unter Annahme der verallgemeinerten Riemannschen Vermutung kann dieser Fehler zudem sehr deutlich verbessert werden., Notation., Es werden durchweg folgende Bezeichnungen verwendet:, Aussage des Satzes., Primzahlen., Im Zentrum der Zahlentheorie, jenes Zweiges der Mathematik, der sich mit den Eigenschaften der natürlichen Zahlen 1, 2, 3, 4,… beschäftigt, stehen die Primzahlen 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,… Diese sind ausgezeichnet durch die Eigenschaft, genau zwei Teiler zu haben, nämlich die 1 und sich selbst. Die 1 ist keine Primzahl. Primzahlen bilden gewissermaßen die Atome der ganzen Zahlen, da sich jede positive ganze Zahl eindeutig multiplikativ in solche zerlegen lässt. Dieses Resultat wird auch als Fundamentalsatz der Arithmetik bezeichnet. Zum Beispiel gilt formula_61 und formula_62., Trotz ihrer einfachen Definition ist nach mehreren Jahrtausenden Mathematikgeschichte bis heute kein Muster bekannt, dem sich die Primzahlen in ihrer Folge unterwerfen. Ihre Natur ist eine der bedeutendsten offenen Fragen der Mathematik. In der modernen Mathematik gibt es jedoch tiefliegende Vermutungen, die das Verhalten der Primzahlen als pseudozufällig einordnen und Verbindungen zur Quantenphysik sehen. All diese Aussagen liegen im Themenbereich der Riemannschen Vermutung., Der Satz von Dirichlet., Eine arithmetische Progression ist eine Folge von ganzen Zahlen, wobei die Differenz zweier aufeinanderfolgender Zahlen konstant ist. Beispiele sind, oder auch, Der Satz von Dirichlet besagt, dass eine arithmetische Progression stets unendlich viele Primzahlen beinhaltet, es sei denn, dies ist aus trivialen Gründen unmöglich. In der einfachsten Fassung lautet der Satz:, Anders formuliert: Es gibt unendlich viele Primzahlen, die kongruent zu formula_3 modulo formula_4 sind. Dabei ist die Voraussetzung der Teilerfremdheit notwendig. Wären formula_3 und formula_4 nicht teilerfremd und formula_73 ein gemeinsamer Teiler, so wäre jedes Folgenglied durch formula_74 teilbar; zwei verschiedene Primzahlen können aber nicht beide durch formula_74 teilbar sein. Dass die Bedingung der Teilerfremdheit von formula_3 und formula_4 für die Existenz unendlich vieler Primzahlen in der entsprechenden Folge nicht nur notwendig, sondern auch \\"hinreichend\\" ist, ist genau die Aussage des Satzes von Dirichlet., Dirichlet konnte sogar etwas mehr zeigen. Es handelt sich um eine direkte Verallgemeinerung des Satzes von Euler über Primzahlen. Es gilt mit oberen Bedingungen:, Diese Aussage ist stärker als die obere Version. Denn offenbar impliziert die Divergenz der Reihe die Unendlichkeit der Primzahlen in der betroffenen arithmetischen Folge. Es gibt allerdings unendliche Folgen, deren Kehrwertsumme beschränkt bleibt. Ein Beispiel bilden die Quadratzahlen (siehe Basler Problem), oder die Zweierpotenzen, es gilt, Damit besagt die verstärkte Fassung des Satzes von Dirichlet, dass die Primzahlen in den relevanten arithmetischen Progressionen gewissermaßen „dicht“ unter den natürlichen Zahlen verteilt sind., Beispiele., Aus dem Satz von Dirichlet folgt zum Beispiel, dass unendlich viele Primzahlen auf die Ziffern 1, 3, 7 oder 9 enden. Noch allgemeiner gibt es unendlich viele Primzahlen, deren letzte Ziffern auf 37, 113, 419 oder 567241 enden. Die ersten Primzahlen mit Endziffern 419 sind formula_80. Es gilt ferner, Triviale Gründe, wann der Satz nicht gilt, liegen vor, wenn formula_3 und formula_4 nicht teilerfremd sind. Dann gibt es eine ganze Zahl formula_84, die sowohl formula_3 als auch formula_4 teilt. Damit teilt formula_47 jede der Zahlen formula_88 mit natürlichen formula_89 und somit enthält diese Folge höchstens (einmal) die Primzahl formula_47, falls formula_47 überhaupt prim ist. Etwa sind formula_92 und formula_93 nicht teilerfremd. In der Tat sind alle Zahlen der Progression, durch formula_95 teilbar. Damit enthält sie keine einzige Primzahl., Trivialerweise impliziert der Satz von Dirichlet den Satz des Euklid, der besagt, dass es unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt. Setzt man etwa formula_96, so besagt er, dass die Progression, unendlich viele Primzahlen enthält., Geschichte., Die mathematische Entdeckungsgeschichte über die Verteilung der Primzahlen reicht bis in die Antike zurück. Schon Euklid erkannte, dass es unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt. Sein Resultat wird als der Satz des Euklid bezeichnet. Ab dem 18.Jahrhundert wurde begonnen, dieses qualitative Resultat quantitativ zu vertiefen. Dabei spielten zunehmend Methoden aus der Analysis eine Rolle, die den alten Griechen noch nicht zur Verfügung standen., Eine Entdeckung Eulers., Leonhard Eulers Entdeckungen zu den Primzahlen waren ein Wegweiser für die kommende Entwicklung von einer elementaren, in der Tradition der alten Griechen stehenden, hin zu einer modernen Form der Zahlentheorie. Im Jahr 1737, während seiner ersten Zeit in Sankt Petersburg, untersuchte Euler einen neuartigen Zugang zu den Primzahlen und fand heraus, dass sie „verhältnismäßig dicht“ unter den natürlichen Zahlen verstreut sind. Genauer bewies er, Summiert man also nacheinander die Kehrwerte der Primzahlen, wird auf Dauer jede noch so große obere Schranke durchbrochen. Dies zeigt, dass Primzahlen eher „dicht“ unter den natürlichen Zahlen verstreut sind; zum Beispiel „dichter“ als die Quadratzahlen, denn ebenfalls Euler zeigte, Quadratzahlen wachsen also langfristig schnell genug an, dass die Summe ihrer Kehrwerte den endlichen Wert 1,645 nicht überschreitet. Euler stand seiner Zeit nicht die mathematische Sprache zur Verfügung, diese Verschärfung des Euklidischen Satzes präzise zu interpretieren, und es gibt keinen Nachweis, dass er sich mit exakten Aussagen zur Verteilung von Primzahlen beschäftigte., Eulers Beweisstrategie für formula_100 nutzt das sog. Euler-Produkt. Dabei spielt die eindeutige Zerlegbarkeit natürlicher Zahlen in Primfaktoren eine Schlüsselrolle. Das Euler-Produkt steht in Zusammenhang zu einem Objekt, das bis heute in der Primzahlforschung benutzt wird und in der modernen Mathematik als Riemannsche Zeta-Funktion bekannt ist. Die Zeta-Funktion spielt ebenfalls für die Riemannsche Vermutung eine zentrale Rolle. Die neuartige Leistung bestand darin, Fragen zu Primzahlen systematisch durch funktionale Zusammenhänge zwischen Zahlen anzugreifen. Euler gilt deswegen als Initiator der analytischen Zahlentheorie., Auch Euler hatte sich bereits Gedanken über Primzahlen in arithmetischen Progressionen gemacht. So behauptete er 1785, dass es zu jeder Zahl formula_4 unendlich viele Primzahlen mit formula_102 gibt., Erste vollständige Formulierung und Beweisversuche., Zur Gänze wurde das Problem erstmals von Adrien-Marie Legendre im Jahre 1798 formuliert. Dies war verbunden mit dem ersten Beweisversuch, der ebenfalls von Legendre unternommen wurde. In der zweiten Auflage seines Buchs \\"Essai sur la théorie des nombres\\" (publiziert 1808) gab er 1798 einen fehlerhaften Beweis. In der dritten Auflage von 1830 wiederholte er denselben Fehler.

Die großflächige Anlage mit dem Schlossgebäude als Mittelpunkt und der Hofkirche als architektonischem Gegengewicht geht auf die im Kern erhaltene und von Johann Friedrich Künnecke entworfene Anlage des Jagdschlosses Klenow mit seinen umgebenden Gartenanlagen zurück und wurde später durch den Architekten Johann Joachim Busch erweitert. Eingebunden sind Schloss und Kirche in eine planmäßig angelegte Stadt, deren Hauptstraße auf den Schlossplatz zuführt. Die Anlage bildet zusammen mit der Stadt und dem Gartenbereich ein Gesamtensemble, das in dieser Ausführung in Mecklenburg einzigartig ist. Ludwigslust wird deshalb auch oft als \\"mecklenburgisches Versailles\\" oder seltener auch als \\"Sanssouci des Nordens\\" bezeichnet., Das im Schloss untergebrachte Museum ist einer der Standorte des Staatlichen Museums Schwerin. Das Schloss ist Eigentum des Landes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; Schloss und Sammlung werden durch die Landesbehörde Staatliche Schlösser, Gärten und Kunstsammlungen Mecklenburg-Vorpommern verwaltet., Hinsichtlich seiner regionalen kulturhistorischen Bedeutung ist das Ludwigsluster Schloss mit den Residenzschlössern Güstrow, Schwerin und der einstigen Residenz Neustrelitz vergleichbar., Geschichtlicher Überblick., Ein Jagdschloss als Ursprung., Der spätere Residenzort Ludwigslust geht auf ein im 14. Jahrhundert erstmals erwähntes Gutsdorf namens \\"Klenow\\" oder auch \\"Kleinow\\" zurück, das Herzog Friedrich Wilhelm I. 1708 als Apanage seinem jüngeren Bruder Christian Ludwig II. überschrieb. Der im benachbarten Grabow residierende Prinz plante 1721 erstmals einen Jagdsitz in der wildreichen Gegend um Klenow. Nachdem das Grabower Schloss im Juni 1725 bei einem Stadtbrand zerstört worden war, schritten die Ausbaupläne für Klenow voran, scheiterten in ihrer Umsetzung jedoch vorerst an einem Streit mit dem mittlerweile regierenden Herzog Karl Leopold. Dieser war als mittlerer der drei überlebenden Brüder 1713 dem kinderlosen Friedrich WilhelmI. auf den Thron gefolgt und verlangte, den Bau des Jagdsitzes einzustellen, den er als Affront gegen sich betrachtete. Bereits begonnene Bauteile mussten auf seine Weisung wieder abgetragen werden. Karl Leopold hatte sich einige Jahre zuvor während des Großen Nordischen Krieges mit dem Kaiser überworfen, was 1728 nach weiteren Willkürakten auch in seinem Herrschaftsgebiet selbst zu seiner Amtsenthebung durch den Reichshofrat führte. Der Bau in Klenow konnte dadurch für den nunmehr eingesetzten Christian Ludwig ab 1731 fortgesetzt werden, die Baustelle stand zunächst unter dem Schutz kaiserlicher Soldaten. Als Baumeister für den neuen Jagdsitz beauftragte Herzog Christian Ludwig den vermutlich aus dem Hannoverschen stammenden Architekten Johann Friedrich Künnecke, der in jener Zeit für den Grafen Hans Caspar von Bothmer das im Nordwesten Mecklenburgs gelegene Schloss Bothmer errichtete., Der Neubau in Klenow diente vorerst nur als Jagdhaus des nach dem Grabower Brand im Neustädter Schloss residierenden Christian Ludwig, wurde aber in den folgenden Jahren umgestaltet. Ab 1748 ließ der Herzog durch den Schweriner Hofarchitekten Jean Laurent Legeay den Französischen Garten erweitern, ab 1752 erfolgte der Ausbau des Jagdhauses. Im Jahr 1754 ließ der Herzog in den \\"Mecklenburgischen Nachrichten\\" den neuen Namen des Jagdschlosses verkünden:, Die Hauptresidenz der herzoglichen Familie blieb in jenen Jahren noch in Schwerin. Nach dem Tode Christian Ludwigs im Jahr 1756 verhinderte der ausbrechende Siebenjährige Krieg vorerst weitere Baumaßnahmen in Ludwigslust., Vom Residenzschloss zum Sommersitz., Der nachfolgende Herzog Friedrich (der Fromme) verbrachte die Kriegsjahre weitgehend in Lübeck. Zwar ließ er sich bereits 1756 durch den Hofbaumeister Jean Laurent Legeay Entwürfe für eine erste Vergrößerung des Schlosses vorlegen, zur Ausführung kamen die Pläne jedoch nicht und Ludwigslust diente in dieser Zeit vor allem als Nebenresidenz seiner jüngeren Schwester Ulrike Sophie. Die einzige größere Baumaßnahme war der Große Kanal, der später eine der Hauptachsen des neuen Gartens bilden sollte., Mit dem Ende des Siebenjährigen Krieges 1763 griff Herzog Friedrich den Gedanken einer Erweiterung des Schlossbezirks wieder auf. Die ursprüngliche Idee, die bescheidene Umbauten vorsah, genügte seinen Ansprüchen zwischenzeitlich nicht mehr. Er hatte als junger Mann eine Grand Tour durch Europa gemacht und dabei auch den Hof von Versailles in Frankreich kennengelernt, der in jener Epoche für die meisten europäischen Fürstenhöfe als Vorbild diente. Für den Jagdsitz im einstigen Klenow, das ebenso wie Versailles außerhalb der eigentlichen Hauptstadt lag, wünschte der Herzog nun eine Schlossanlage nach französischem Ideal. Dort wollte er einerseits den Regierungsgeschäften nachgehen und sich andererseits seinen naturwissenschaftlichen und musischen Neigungen hingeben. Das Schloss sollte zudem den passenden Rahmen für die bereits unter seinem Vater gegründete Kunstsammlung bieten. Das Vorhaben einer zeitgemäßen Residenz wurde von seiner Ehefrau, Herzogin Louise Friderike von Württemberg, unterstützt, die als Enkelin des Württemberger Herzogs Eberhard Ludwig eine aufwendige Hofhaltung gewöhnt war, die sie am pietistisch-nüchternen Hof ihres frommen Gatten vermisste., Herzog Friedrich bat Baumeister Legeay um neue Entwürfe, zeitgleich begann der Schweriner Hofbaumeister Johann Joachim Busch mit dem Bau einer Stadtanlage nach barockem Grundriss und einer großen Hofkirche als Gegengewicht zum Schloss. Erste Bauarbeiten begannen 1763 mit den Häusern am Bassinplatz und um den späteren Kirchhof; bereits ab 1764 verlegte Herzog Friedrich den Hof von Schwerin nach Ludwigslust. 1765 wurde unter Buschs Leitung der Grundstein der Hofkirche gelegt und nach deren Vollendung 1772 der Bau des neuen Residenzschlosses begonnen, das 1777 bezogen werden konnte. Die zahlreichen gleichzeitigen Baustellen beschäftigten mehrere hundert Maurer, Zimmerleute und andere Handwerker, die Bauern der Umgebung mussten Hand- und Spanndienste leisten und Herzog Friedrich beaufsichtigte die Arbeiten regelmäßig. Die Ausgaben für das Bauprojekt konnten dadurch begrenzt werden, dass auf teure Materialien wie Marmor und edle Hölzer weitgehend verzichtet und stattdessen Pappmaché, der sogenannte Ludwigsluster Carton, eingesetzt wurde. Die Kosten trug die herzogliche Rentkammer, deren Einnahmen Erlöse aus der Forstkasse des waldreichen Gebiets aufbesserten. Als Herzog Friedrich 1785 starb, war der Schlossbezirk weitgehend vollendet. Ludwigslust hatte sich von einem Gutsdorf zu einem kleinen Fürstenhof entwickelt, der über einen Zeitraum von rund 80Jahren das kulturelle und politische Zentrum des Landesteils Mecklenburg-Schwerin bildete., \\"Mit Friedrichs Tod ging die neue Residenz des kinderlosen Herzogs an seinen Neffen und Nachfolger Friedrich Franz I. über. Dieser ließ den kaum vollendeten Barockgarten im nunmehr zeitgemäßen Stil als Englischen Landschaftsgarten erweitern und ab 1809 die Stadtanlage durch Johann Georg Barca ausbauen. Nach Friedrich Franz Tod verlegte sein ihm folgender Enkel Paul Friedrich den Hof 1837 zurück nach Schwerin, womit Ludwigslust auf den Status einer Sommerresidenz sank. Friedrich Franz II. ließ die Gartenanlage von 1852 bis 1860 durch Peter Joseph Lenné gestalterisch überarbeiten, dennoch wurde das Schloss in der zweiten Hälfte des 19.Jahrhunderts nur noch selten bewohnt. Große Teile der Ludwigsluster Kunstsammlung kamen ab 1879 nach Schwerin. Bedeutung als dauerhafter Wohnsitz erlangte das Schloss noch einmal mit dem Ende des Ersten Weltkriegs, als es im Zuge der Abdankung und der Enteignung der Mecklenburgischen Großherzöge von Friedrich Franz IV. bezogen wurde. Einige der Innenräume konnten ab 1922 erstmals von der Öffentlichkeit besichtigt werden. Die herzogliche Familie bewohnte Ludwigslust bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs, das Schlossgebäude überstand die Kriegszeit ohne bauliche Schäden. Das bei Kriegsende zunächst von westalliierten Truppen besetzte Ludwigslust entging zudem den Verwüstungen, die zahlreiche Schloss- und Herrenhausanlagen im Osten Deutschlands durch die Rote Armee widerfuhren. Dennoch gingen Teile der beweglichen Ausstattung in der Folgezeit durch Plünderung und Vernachlässigung verloren.\\", Vom Verwaltungsbau zum Schlossmuseum., In den ersten Nachkriegsjahren beherbergte das Schloss die örtliche Kommandantur der Roten Armee. Die herzogliche Familie wurde bei der Bodenreform 1947 enteignet und das Schloss schließlich vom Kreis Ludwigslust übernommen. Anfängliche Pläne, in dem Bauwerk ein Museum einzurichten, wurden nicht weiter verfolgt; die bis dahin im Schloss verbliebenen Kunstschätze gelangten teilweise nach Schwerin oder wurden im Schloss eingelagert. Die einstige herzogliche Residenz diente in der DDR-Zeit als Sitz der Kreisbehörden; in die historischen Innenräume zogen für mehrere Jahrzehnte Staatsorgane der DDR ein., Im Jahr 1986 wurden das Schloss und die Gartenanlagen unter die Verwaltung des Staatlichen Museums Schwerin gestellt und größere Maßnahmen zur Bausicherung vorgenommen, sowie erstmals wieder Räume für die Öffentlichkeit zur Besichtigung freigegeben. Das Schloss wurde zum \\"Museum für höfische Kunst und Wohnkultur\\". Die Kreisverwaltung blieb bis 1991 im Schloss, seitdem wurde es schrittweise einer musealen Nutzung zugeführt und in Abschnitten bis Ende 2015 saniert. Die Finanzierung der Restaurierung erfolgte zum Teil mit EU-Mitteln. Die Sanierung der Fassade kostete 4,8Millionen Euro, die Restaurierung der Innenräume weitere 12Millionen Euro. Die Arbeiten an der Großen Kaskade wurden 2007 begonnen und 2010 abgeschlossen; sie kosteten rund 450.000 Euro. Schloss und Park sind zu besichtigen; bis 2005 wurden im Schlossmuseum jährlich zwischen 50.000 und 60.000 Besucher gezählt. Neben vereinzelten Sonderausstellungen organisiert ein Förderverein Schlosskonzerte und ein regelmäßiges Barockfest, weiter findet alljährlich das \\"Kleine Fest im Großen Park\\" statt.

Die Schiffe wurden ab 1941 gebaut und dienten ab 1942 in der Navy. Bis 1944 wurden 175 Schiffe in elf verschiedenen Werften gebaut. Damit ist die Fletcher-Klasse eine der zahlenmäßig stärksten Klassen von Überwasserkriegsschiffen der Welt. Die Schiffe nahmen an allen großen Operationen der US Navy während des Pazifikkriegs teil. Die Dienstzeit in der US-Marine dauerte mit Unterbrechungen bis 1971, etliche Zerstörer wurden an andere Nationen, darunter auch Deutschland, abgegeben und blieben noch lange im aktiven Dienst. Das letzte Schiff der Klasse, die \\"BAM Cuitlahuac\\" (die ehemalige USS \\"John Rodgers\\"), wurde 2002, nach insgesamt 60 Jahren Dienstzeit, bei der mexikanischen Marine ausgemustert., Geschichte., Planungen., Nach dem Eintritt Großbritanniens in den Zweiten Weltkrieg 1939 ging die US-amerikanische Regierung unter Franklin D. Roosevelt davon aus, dass die Vereinigten Staaten ebenfalls in den Krieg hineingezogen würden und dass Japan der Hauptgegner sein würde. Roosevelt sah in der Aufrüstung ein Mittel zur Bekämpfung der Arbeitslosigkeit, der drohende Kriegseintritt machte jedoch deutlich, dass die Flotte tatsächlich verstärkt werden musste. Die Zerstörer der US-Marine waren zum größten Teil veraltete Modelle aus der Zeit des Ersten Weltkriegs, die Produktion der neuen Zerstörer der \\"Gleaves-\\" und der \\"Benson-Klasse\\" lief nur langsam an, die Zerstörerklassen aus der Zwischenkriegszeit waren zum größten Teil noch nach Entwürfen aus dem Ersten Weltkrieg gebaut worden oder unterlagen den Begrenzungen der Washingtoner Flottenabkommen., Die Planungen für neue Schlachtschiffe und Flugzeugträger mit einer Geschwindigkeit von über 30 Knoten machten schnelle Zerstörer mit einer Höchstgeschwindigkeit zwischen 35 und 38 Knoten erforderlich, die eine entsprechend starke Antriebsanlage benötigten. Das für die Planungen zuständige \\"General Ship Board\\" erhielt sechs verschiedene Entwürfe für die neue Schiffsklasse, die sich an den Vorgaben (1.600 Tonnen Verdrängung, vier bis fünf 5-Zoll-Geschütze, 6.500 Seemeilen Reichweite bei 12 Knoten) und den Vorgängerbauten der \\"Gleaves-\\", \\"Benson-\\" und \\"Sims\\"-Klassen orientierten. Um die Jahreswende 1939/1940 wurden drei neue Entwürfe vorgelegt, die sich gegenüber den vorherigen Entwürfen durch die Rückkehr zum Flushdecker-Konzept auszeichneten und eine gestiegene Wasserverdrängung für die geforderte Panzerung der Brücken-, Führungs- und Maschinenräume nutzten. Ebenfalls konnte so gegenüber den Vorentwürfen die Flugabwehrbewaffnung von vier 12,7-mm-Maschinengewehren mit einer 28-mm-Vierlingsflak verstärkt werden und die Antriebskraft auf 60.000 WPS für 38 Knoten Konstruktionsgeschwindigkeit gesteigert werden., Am 27. Januar 1940 fällte das \\"Board\\" seine Entscheidung für den Entwurf des renommierten Konstruktionsbüros Gibbs &amp; Cox mit fünf Einzeltürmen und vergab die Bauaufträge für die ersten 130 Schiffe der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\". Davon wurden elf Schiffe, darunter zwei Prototypen für alternative Antriebe, später wieder gestrichen. 1941 wurden 16, 1942 40 weitere Zerstörer bewilligt., Bau., Um die große Anzahl an Zerstörern innerhalb kurzer Zeit fertigzustellen, wurden die Bauaufträge an elf Werften vergeben, darunter auch solchen, die zuvor noch kein Schiff für die US-Marine gebaut hatten. Bethlehem Steel erhielt den Auftrag für 43 Schiffe und verteilte diese auf die Standorte San Francisco (18), Staten Island (15) und San Pedro (10). Mit 31 Schiffen erhielt Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine den größten Auftrag als einzelne Werft. 29 Zerstörer wurden bei der Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey gebaut, 21 bei Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding in Seattle, Washington. Im Boston Navy Yard wurden 14 Schiffe auf Kiel gelegt, bei Consolidated Steel Shipyards in Orange, Texas, zwölf, beim Charleston Navy Yard zehn, im Puget Sound Naval Shipyard acht und bei Gulf Shipbuilding in Chickasaw, Alabama sieben Zerstörer gebaut., Die Kiellegung der ersten Schiffe, USS \\"Nicholas\\" und USS \\"O’Bannon\\", erfolgte am 3. März 1941 bei Bath Iron Works. Das Typschiff, die USS \\"Fletcher\\", wurde am 2.Oktober 1941 bei Federal Shipyards in Kearny auf Kiel gelegt. Die \\"Nicholas\\" lief am 19.Februar 1942 als erstes Schiff vom Stapel, die Indienststellung erfolgte am 4.Juni 1942, dreieinhalb Wochen vor dem Typschiff der Klasse. Das letzte Schiff, die USS \\"Rooks\\", lief am 6.Juni 1944 bei Seattle-Tacoma vom Stapel., Änderungen., Noch während des Baus der ersten Einheiten flossen bereits die ersten Erfahrungen aus dem Krieg in die Konstruktion ein. Es zeigte sich, dass die ursprünglichen runden Steuerhäuser der ersten Schiffe eine schlechte Rundumsicht boten. Sie wurden daher bei den späteren Schiffen durch einen die Vorderseite umgebenden Umlauf ergänzt, der die beiden Brückennocken miteinander verband., Nur wenige Einheiten wurden mit dem ursprünglich vorgesehenen 28-mm-Vierling und 12,7-mm-Maschinengewehren ausgerüstet, ersterer wurde durch eine 40-mm-Doppellafette ersetzt, zudem gehörten nun sechs 20-mm-Flugabwehrgeschütze zum Entwurf., Der Mangel an Aluminium während des Krieges machte es nötig, die oberen Aufbauten ebenfalls aus Stahl zu fertigen, was eine Gewichtserhöhung um 50 Tonnen mit sich brachte und die Topplastigkeit der Schiffe erhöhte. Um dem entgegenzuwirken, wurde die Feuerleitanlage um zwei Meter nach unten verlegt, außerdem wurde auf einen Großteil der Panzerung der Kommandobrücke verzichtet., Dabei wurde ebenfalls die Brücke dahingehend modifiziert, dass der von Beginn an offene Umlauf ins Deckshaus integriert war. Der geschlossene Teil wurde weiter nach achtern versetzt und hatte nunmehr eine eckige Form., Mitte 1942 wurde deutlich, dass zur Koordination der Waffen und zur Verarbeitung der Informationen an Bord ein zentraler Lageraum notwendig war. Die Schiffe wurden daher mit einem Combat Information Center (CIC) nachgerüstet, das sich unterhalb der Kommandobrücke auf dem Niveau des Hauptdecks befand und in dem alle Informationen während des Gefechts zusammenliefen., Umbauten., Zweiter Weltkrieg., Schon 1940 gab es Planungen, sechs Zerstörer mit einer Bordfluganlage für ein Bordflugzeug auszurüsten, um auch kleineren Zerstörerverbänden Luftaufklärungskapazitäten zu geben. Bei fünf Schiffen (DD-476 bis DD-480) wurden während des Baus 1942/43 die notwendigen Änderungen vorgenommen, jedoch nach wenigen Monaten Ende 1943 wieder rückgängig gemacht. Gründe hierfür waren unter anderem, dass die Flugzeuge auf den kleinen Schiffen nicht mit ihrer vollen Waffenlast ausgerüstet werden konnten, aber es zeigte sich auch, dass das Konzept aufgrund der mittlerweile angewachsenen Trägerflotte und der vergrößerten Anzahl von Kreuzern und Schlachtschiffen, die Aufklärungsflugzeuge trugen, überflüssig geworden war. Dazu kam, dass eine weitere Ausrüstung der Zerstörer mit Luftabwehr aufgrund fehlender Platz- und Gewichtsreserven unmöglich war. Das sechste Schiff DD-481 wurde 1943 nicht mehr umgerüstet, sondern in der ursprünglichen Konfiguration fertiggestellt., Als Reaktion auf die verstärkten japanischen Angriffe mit Tokkotai-Fliegern (Kamikaze) wurde bei über 50 Schiffen der Fletcher-Klasse die Luftabwehrbewaffnung im Sommer 1945 drastisch verstärkt. Die Geschütze wurden zum Teil mit Radarsteuerungen ausgerüstet, viele 20-mm-Einzelgeschütze durch Doppellafetten ersetzt und die Torpedobewaffnung verringert., Kalter Krieg., Mit dem Anwachsen der Spannungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion und der sowjetischen Aufrüstung im Marinebereich wurde deutlich, dass die US-amerikanische Marine mehr U-Jagdschiffe benötigt. Aus diesem Grund wurden 1948 aus der Reserveflotte 18 eingemottete Fletcher-Zerstörer wieder reaktiviert und mit verstärkter U-Jagdbewaffnung ausgestattet., Zusätzlich zu den 18 U-Jagdzerstörern wurden zu Beginn des Koreakriegs über 60 weitere \\"Fletchers\\" aus der Reserveflotte geholt und für ihren neuen Einsatzzweck teilweise umgebaut. Bei 43 Schiffen wurde der mittlere Geschützturm entfernt, an seiner Stelle wurden zwei 76-mm-Doppellafetten installiert. Zusätzlich erhielten die Schiffe neue Feuerleitanlagen. Diese Schiffe wurden inoffiziell als \\"La-Valette-Klasse\\" bezeichnet. Die restlichen reaktivierten Schiffe behielten ihre Bewaffnung aus dem Zweiten Weltkrieg und wurden als \\"Daly-Klasse\\" bezeichnet., FRAM II., Ursprünglich war 1957 beschlossen worden, alle 18 Schiffe, die bereits 1948 den U-Jagdumbau erhalten hatten, nach FRAM II umzubauen. 1958 begann der Umbau der USS \\"Hazelwood\\", die als Testschiff für die Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter dienen sollte. In der Folge wurden drei Zerstörer (USS \\"Radford\\", USS \\"Jenkins\\" und USS \\"Nicholas\\") in Pearl Harbor umgebaut und mit einem Startplatz sowie einem Hangar für die DASH-Drohnen ausgerüstet. 1961 wurden die Umbaupläne für die 15 übrigen DDEs gestrichen, so dass es bei drei Umbauten der Fletcher-Klasse blieb. Diese Schiffe wurden inoffiziell als \\"Radford-Klasse\\" bezeichnet. Die drei Zerstörer verließen auch als erste Schiffe des FRAM-II-Programms 1969 die US-Marine., Dienstzeit., Die Zerstörer der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\" wurden zwischen 1942 und 1944 in Dienst gestellt. Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurden 145 der verbliebenen Zerstörer stillgelegt und der Reserveflotte zugeteilt. Zu Beginn des Koreakrieges wurden zusätzlich zu den 18 umgebauten U-Jagdzerstörern aus den Jahren 1948/49 über 60 weitere Zerstörer reaktiviert, 19 davon wurden nach Ende der Kampfhandlungen in Korea wieder ausgemustert. Die übrigen Zerstörer blieben bis Ende der 1960er Jahre, Anfang der 1970er Jahre in Dienst. Das letzte Schiff der Klasse, das bei der US-Marine außer Dienst gestellt wurde, war die USS \\"Mullany\\", die am 6. Oktober 1971 stillgelegt und aus den Schiffsregistern gestrichen wurde., Zwischen 1958 und 1960 wurden sechs Schiffe der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\" (USS \\"Anthony\\", USS \\"Ringgold\\", USS \\"Wadsworth\\", USS \\"Claxton\\", USS \\"Dyson\\" und USS \\"Charles Ausburne\\") als Waffenhilfe an die damals noch im Aufbau befindliche Bundesmarine übergeben, wo sie als \\"Klasse 119\\" (Schiffsnamen: Zerstörer 1 bis Zerstörer 6) bis in die 1980er Jahre im Einsatz waren. Ursprünglich als Artillerieunterstützer für amphibische Landungen gedacht, wurden sie später zumeist als U-Jagdschiffe in den NATO-Verbänden im Nordatlantik sowie zur Sicherung der Ostseezugänge eingesetzt.

Zu ihren kennzeichnenden Merkmalen gehören das Säugen des Nachwuchses mit Milch, die in den Milchdrüsen der Weibchen produziert wird, sowie das Fell aus Haaren, das sie in Kombination mit der gleichwarmen Körpertemperatur relativ unabhängig von der Umgebungstemperatur macht. Bis auf wenige Ausnahmen (Kloakentiere) sind Säugetiere lebendgebärend. Säugetiere sind an Land am artenreichsten verbreitet, doch bevölkern sie auch Luft und Wasser. Das Verhaltensspektrum der Säugetiere ist breit und flexibel, einige Gruppen zeigen komplexe soziale Gefüge., Zur Systematik der Säugetiere wurden, im Jahr 2022, insgesamt 6596 rezente Arten gezählt. Fast 200 neu entdeckte Arten wurden nach 2018 erstmals beschrieben, als zwischen 6399 Spezies innerhalb der Säugetiere unterschieden wurde., Die Säugetiere werden in drei Unterklassen eingeteilt: die eierlegenden Ursäuger (Protheria), die Beutelsäuger (Metatheria) und die Höheren Säugetiere oder Plazentatiere (Eutheria), zu denen auch der Mensch zählt. Diejenige Richtung der speziellen Zoologie, die sich der Erforschung der Säugetiere widmet, wird als Mammalogie bezeichnet., Körperbau., Säugetiere zählen zu den Landwirbeltieren (Tetrapoda) innerhalb des Taxons der Wirbeltiere (Vertebrata) und teilen somit die Merkmale dieser Gruppen, die hier nicht einzeln wiedergegeben werden., Grundsätzliche Merkmale., Haare., Ein Fellkleid aus Haaren ist eines der wichtigsten Merkmale der Säugetiere. Auch wenn manche Arten (zum Beispiel die Wale) praktisch haarlos sind, haben sie sich doch aus behaarten Vorfahren entwickelt und zeigen zumindest in ihrer Embryonalentwicklung Haarwuchs. Die meisten Säugetierarten sind zeit ihres Lebens am überwiegenden Teil des Körpers behaart. Haare bestehen hauptsächlich aus dem Protein Keratin. Die Haare der Tiere können mehrere Funktionen haben:, Gebiss., Säugetiere sind in der Regel durch ein heterodontes Gebiss mit vier verschiedenen Zahntypen charakterisiert, die Schneidezähne (Incisivi), Eckzähne (Canini), und zwei Arten von Backenzähnen (Prämolaren und Molaren). Die Zahl der einzelnen Zahntypen wird mit der Zahnformel wiedergegeben. Ein heterodontes Gebiss ist ein wichtiges Unterscheidungsmerkmal von den homodonten (gleichförmigen) Gebissen der Reptilien und vor allem bei der Einordnung von Fossilien von Bedeutung. Bei den meisten Säugetieren gibt es einen einmaligen Zahnwechsel (\\"Diphyodontie\\"). Zunächst werden Milchzähne angelegt (\\"lacteale Dentition\\"), die später durch die „zweiten“ oder bleibenden Zähne (\\"permanente Dentition\\") ersetzt werden. Lediglich die Molaren werden nicht ersetzt, sondern kommen erst mit den bleibenden Zähnen., Eine Reihe von Säugetiergruppen besitzt wurzellose Zähne, die zeitlebens weiterwachsen und durch Abrieb abgenutzt werden. Dazu zählen beispielsweise die Nagezähne der Nagetiere oder die Stoßzähne der Elefanten, des Narwals, des Walrosses und anderer Arten., Gehörknöchelchen und Kiefergelenk., Ein Exklusivmerkmal der Säugetiere sind die drei Gehörknöchelchen Hammer (\\"Malleus\\"), Amboss (\\"Incus\\") und Steigbügel (\\"Stapes\\"). Diese befinden sich im Mittelohr; sie nehmen die Schwingungen des Trommelfells auf und leiten sie an das ovale Fenster des Innenohres weiter., Stammesgeschichtlich können die Gehörknöchelchen von Bestandteilen ursprünglicher Kiemen- bzw. Kieferbögen abgeleitet werden: Der Steigbügel vom \\"Hyomandibulare\\", welches bei den Fischen Bestandteil des Suspensoriums und bei anderen Landwirbeltieren als \\"Columella\\" ausgebildet ist, Amboss und Hammer vom \\"Quadratum\\" sowie von einem Teil des durch Knochen ersetzten \\"Meckelschen Knorpels\\", dem \\"Articulare\\". Das Trommelfell wird von einem fast ringförmigen Knochen, dem Tympanicum, umschlossen., Bei den anderen Wirbeltieren bilden Quadratum und Articulare das primäre Kiefergelenk, welches bei den Säugetieren während der fetalen Entwicklung durch ein an anderer Stelle entstehendes, sekundäres Kiefergelenk ersetzt wird. Dieses wird von den Deckknochen \\"Dentale\\" und \\"Squamosum\\" gebildet. Der Übergang vom primären zum sekundären Kiefergelenk wurde funktionell möglich, als die Gelenkachsen beider infolge der Größenzunahme des Gehirns bzw. Hirnschädels bei den Cynodontia in eine Linie zusammenfielen., Vielfalt im Körperbau., Im Zuge ihrer Entwicklungsgeschichte haben die Säugetiere nahezu alle Lebensräume besiedelt und sich dabei in eine Vielzahl von Formen aufgeteilt. Eine Reihe von Arten hat sich an eine aquatische (wasserlebende) Lebensweise angepasst; am spezialisiertesten sind die Wale, deren Körperbau Ähnlichkeiten mit den Fischen aufweist. Die Vordergliedmaßen sind zu Flossen (Flipper) umgestaltet, die Hintergliedmaßen sind rückgebildet und der Schwanz ist zu einer Fluke umgebildet. Bei anderen Taxa wie Robben und Seekühen ist die Anpassung an das Wasser weniger weit fortgeschritten. Die Fledertiere sind neben den Vögeln und den ausgestorbenen Flugsauriern die einzigen Wirbeltiere, die zum aktiven Fliegen fähig sind. Sie weisen stark verlängerte Finger auf, die die Flughaut aufspannen. Daneben hat eine Reihe von Säugetiertaxa unabhängig voneinander Gleitmembranen entwickelt, die ihnen einen passiven Gleitflug ermöglichen: dazu zählen die Riesengleiter, die Gleit- und Dornschwanzhörnchen aus der Gruppe der Nagetiere sowie drei Familien gleitender Beuteltiere (die Gleit-, Ring- und Zwerggleitbeutler). Verschiedenste Säugetiere sind an eine unterirdisch-grabende Lebensweise angepasst. Diese haben einen walzenförmigen Körperbau mit kurzen, oft zu Grabwerkzeugen erweiterten Gliedmaßen entwickelt. Zahlreiche Arten führen eine arboreale (baumbewohnende) Lebensweise – diese sind oft durch greiffähige Pfoten mit opponierbarem Daumen und Greifschwanz charakterisiert. Bewohner von Grasländern und anderen offenen Habitaten weisen oft eine Reduktion der Zehenanzahl und die Herausbildung von verhornten Zehen oder Hufen auf, andere haben stark vergrößerte Hinterbeine und eine springende Fortbewegung entwickelt. Viele Arten, vorwiegend kleinere, versteckt lebende, weisen hingegen einen gedrungenen Körperbau mit kurzen Gliedmaßen auf – darunter zahlreiche Nagetiere und Insektenfresser., Auch bei der Größe gibt es beträchtliche Unterschiede: Als kleinste Säugetiere gelten die Schweinsnasenfledermaus und die Etruskerspitzmaus, die jeweils nur 2 Gramm Körpergewicht erreichen. Der Blauwal hingegen gilt als das größte Tier, das jemals auf der Erde lebte, und erreicht in Ausnahmefällen bis zu 150 Tonnen Gewicht, was das 75-Millionen-fache der kleinsten Säuger darstellt., Verbreitung und Lebensräume., Säugetiere sind weltweit verbreitet, sie finden sich auf allen Kontinenten, in allen Ozeanen sowie auf den meisten Inseln. Ursäuger sind auf Australien und Neuguinea beschränkt, Beutelsäuger leben einerseits auf dem australischen Kontinent und Südostasien östlich der Wallace-Linie und andererseits in Nord-, Mittel- und Südamerika. Höhere Säugetiere haben eine weltweite Verbreitung, waren aber bis zur Ankunft des Menschen in Australien nur durch relativ wenige Arten vertreten, namentlich Fledertiere und Echte Mäuse. Auf abgelegenen Inseln gab es bis zur Ankunft des Menschen nur eine eingeschränkte Säugetierfauna; so waren auf vielen Inseln, darunter Neuseeland, Fledertiere die einzigen Säuger., Säugetiere haben nahezu alle Regionen der Erde besiedelt und kommen in den meisten Lebensräumen vor. Man findet sie in Wüsten und Wäldern, im Hochgebirge und auch in den Polarregionen. Zu den wenigen Regionen, in denen sich (zumindest bis auf zeitweilige Aufenthalte des Menschen) keine Säuger finden, zählt das Innere des antarktischen Kontinents. Mehrere Gruppen von Säugetieren, die Meeressäugetiere, haben sich dem Leben im Meer angepasst; in der Tiefsee finden sich allerdings nur wenige spezialisierte Walarten., Lebensweise., Lebensweisen., So unterschiedlich die Säugetiere in Bezug auf ihren Körperbau und ihre Lebensräume sind, so unterschiedlich sind auch ihre Lebensweisen. Es finden sich tag-, dämmerungs- und nachtaktive sowie kathemerale (sowohl am Tag als auch in der Nacht aktive) Arten. Auch im Sozialverhalten gibt es beträchtliche Unterschiede: neben strikt einzelgängerischen Arten gibt es andere, die in Gruppen von bis zu Tausenden von Tieren zusammenleben. Manche Arten haben komplexe Verhaltensmuster entwickelt, sie etablieren eine strenge Rangordnung innerhalb der Gruppe und kommunizieren untereinander mittels Lauten, Gesten oder Körperhaltungen. Obwohl es die Ausnahme ist, so gibt es auch Säugetiere, die Gifte zur Verteidigung oder zur Jagd einsetzen (siehe: Giftige Säugetiere)., Einige Säugetiere vermeiden klimatisch extreme Zeiten und den damit verbundenen Nahrungsmangel, indem sie in einen Winterschlaf oder einen Torpor (Starrezustand) verfallen, etwa in kalten oder trockenen Jahreszeiten. Dabei fällt die Körpertemperatur nahezu auf die Umgebungstemperatur ab, Atmung und Herzschlag verlangsamen sich und der Stoffwechsel wird reduziert., Sinneswahrnehmung., Der Geruchssinn spielt eine bedeutende Rolle in der Lebensweise der Säugetiere, unter anderem bei der Nahrungssuche und bei der Fortpflanzung, wo Pheromone die Paarungsbereitschaft signalisieren. Auch für das Territorialverhalten ist der Geruch bedeutend, etliche Arten markieren ihr Territorium mittels Urin, Kot oder spezieller Drüsensekrete., Im Allgemeinen ist bei Säugetieren das Gehör gut entwickelt. Eine Sonderform ist die Echoortung, bei der anhand des zurückkehrenden Echos ausgesandter Schallwellen die eigene Position bestimmt oder Beute lokalisiert werden kann. Bei zwei Taxa, den Zahnwalen und den Fledermäusen, ist die Echolokation besonders ausgeprägt, sie findet sich aber auch bei anderen Gruppen., Auch der Tastsinn dient der Wahrnehmung der Umwelt. Viele Arten haben zu diesem Zweck spezielle Tasthaare (Vibrissae) entwickelt, die außerordentlich empfindlich sind und durch Muskelbewegungen gesteuert werden können. Auch die Haut selbst ist ein Sinnesorgan, bestimmte Körperteile sind besonders reich an Mechanorezeptoren, zum Beispiel die Fingerspitzen der Primaten oder die Nasen- beziehung: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Säugetiere, Wirbeltiere, Milchdrüsen, Fell, unabhängig, lebendgebärend, Luft, Wasser, Sozialverhalten, Gebiss, Gehörknöchelchen, Kiefergelenk, Körperbau, Größe, Verbreitung, Lebensräume, Lebensweise, Geruchssinn, Gehör, Tastsinn, Haut"},{"instruction":"привет, что такое христианская демократия и как ты к ней относишься?","output":"Привет!

Die großflächige Anlage mit dem Schlossgebäude als Mittelpunkt und der Hofkirche als architektonischem Gegengewicht geht auf die im Kern erhaltene und von Johann Friedrich Künnecke entworfene Anlage des Jagdschlosses Klenow mit seinen umgebenden Gartenanlagen zurück und wurde später durch den Architekten Johann Joachim Busch erweitert. Eingebunden sind Schloss und Kirche in eine planmäßig angelegte Stadt, deren Hauptstraße auf den Schlossplatz zuführt. Die Anlage bildet zusammen mit der Stadt und dem Gartenbereich ein Gesamtensemble, das in dieser Ausführung in Mecklenburg einzigartig ist. Ludwigslust wird deshalb auch oft als \\"mecklenburgisches Versailles\\" oder seltener auch als \\"Sanssouci des Nordens\\" bezeichnet., Das im Schloss untergebrachte Museum ist einer der Standorte des Staatlichen Museums Schwerin. Das Schloss ist Eigentum des Landes Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; Schloss und Sammlung werden durch die Landesbehörde Staatliche Schlösser, Gärten und Kunstsammlungen Mecklenburg-Vorpommern verwaltet., Hinsichtlich seiner regionalen kulturhistorischen Bedeutung ist das Ludwigsluster Schloss mit den Residenzschlössern Güstrow, Schwerin und der einstigen Residenz Neustrelitz vergleichbar., Geschichtlicher Überblick., Ein Jagdschloss als Ursprung., Der spätere Residenzort Ludwigslust geht auf ein im 14. Jahrhundert erstmals erwähntes Gutsdorf namens \\"Klenow\\" oder auch \\"Kleinow\\" zurück, das Herzog Friedrich Wilhelm I. 1708 als Apanage seinem jüngeren Bruder Christian Ludwig II. überschrieb. Der im benachbarten Grabow residierende Prinz plante 1721 erstmals einen Jagdsitz in der wildreichen Gegend um Klenow. Nachdem das Grabower Schloss im Juni 1725 bei einem Stadtbrand zerstört worden war, schritten die Ausbaupläne für Klenow voran, scheiterten in ihrer Umsetzung jedoch vorerst an einem Streit mit dem mittlerweile regierenden Herzog Karl Leopold. Dieser war als mittlerer der drei überlebenden Brüder 1713 dem kinderlosen Friedrich WilhelmI. auf den Thron gefolgt und verlangte, den Bau des Jagdsitzes einzustellen, den er als Affront gegen sich betrachtete. Bereits begonnene Bauteile mussten auf seine Weisung wieder abgetragen werden. Karl Leopold hatte sich einige Jahre zuvor während des Großen Nordischen Krieges mit dem Kaiser überworfen, was 1728 nach weiteren Willkürakten auch in seinem Herrschaftsgebiet selbst zu seiner Amtsenthebung durch den Reichshofrat führte. Der Bau in Klenow konnte dadurch für den nunmehr eingesetzten Christian Ludwig ab 1731 fortgesetzt werden, die Baustelle stand zunächst unter dem Schutz kaiserlicher Soldaten. Als Baumeister für den neuen Jagdsitz beauftragte Herzog Christian Ludwig den vermutlich aus dem Hannoverschen stammenden Architekten Johann Friedrich Künnecke, der in jener Zeit für den Grafen Hans Caspar von Bothmer das im Nordwesten Mecklenburgs gelegene Schloss Bothmer errichtete., Der Neubau in Klenow diente vorerst nur als Jagdhaus des nach dem Grabower Brand im Neustädter Schloss residierenden Christian Ludwig, wurde aber in den folgenden Jahren umgestaltet. Ab 1748 ließ der Herzog durch den Schweriner Hofarchitekten Jean Laurent Legeay den Französischen Garten erweitern, ab 1752 erfolgte der Ausbau des Jagdhauses. Im Jahr 1754 ließ der Herzog in den \\"Mecklenburgischen Nachrichten\\" den neuen Namen des Jagdschlosses verkünden:, Die Hauptresidenz der herzoglichen Familie blieb in jenen Jahren noch in Schwerin. Nach dem Tode Christian Ludwigs im Jahr 1756 verhinderte der ausbrechende Siebenjährige Krieg vorerst weitere Baumaßnahmen in Ludwigslust., Vom Residenzschloss zum Sommersitz., Der nachfolgende Herzog Friedrich (der Fromme) verbrachte die Kriegsjahre weitgehend in Lübeck. Zwar ließ er sich bereits 1756 durch den Hofbaumeister Jean Laurent Legeay Entwürfe für eine erste Vergrößerung des Schlosses vorlegen, zur Ausführung kamen die Pläne jedoch nicht und Ludwigslust diente in dieser Zeit vor allem als Nebenresidenz seiner jüngeren Schwester Ulrike Sophie. Die einzige größere Baumaßnahme war der Große Kanal, der später eine der Hauptachsen des neuen Gartens bilden sollte., Mit dem Ende des Siebenjährigen Krieges 1763 griff Herzog Friedrich den Gedanken einer Erweiterung des Schlossbezirks wieder auf. Die ursprüngliche Idee, die bescheidene Umbauten vorsah, genügte seinen Ansprüchen zwischenzeitlich nicht mehr. Er hatte als junger Mann eine Grand Tour durch Europa gemacht und dabei auch den Hof von Versailles in Frankreich kennengelernt, der in jener Epoche für die meisten europäischen Fürstenhöfe als Vorbild diente. Für den Jagdsitz im einstigen Klenow, das ebenso wie Versailles außerhalb der eigentlichen Hauptstadt lag, wünschte der Herzog nun eine Schlossanlage nach französischem Ideal. Dort wollte er einerseits den Regierungsgeschäften nachgehen und sich andererseits seinen naturwissenschaftlichen und musischen Neigungen hingeben. Das Schloss sollte zudem den passenden Rahmen für die bereits unter seinem Vater gegründete Kunstsammlung bieten. Das Vorhaben einer zeitgemäßen Residenz wurde von seiner Ehefrau, Herzogin Louise Friderike von Württemberg, unterstützt, die als Enkelin des Württemberger Herzogs Eberhard Ludwig eine aufwendige Hofhaltung gewöhnt war, die sie am pietistisch-nüchternen Hof ihres frommen Gatten vermisste., Herzog Friedrich bat Baumeister Legeay um neue Entwürfe, zeitgleich begann der Schweriner Hofbaumeister Johann Joachim Busch mit dem Bau einer Stadtanlage nach barockem Grundriss und einer großen Hofkirche als Gegengewicht zum Schloss. Erste Bauarbeiten begannen 1763 mit den Häusern am Bassinplatz und um den späteren Kirchhof; bereits ab 1764 verlegte Herzog Friedrich den Hof von Schwerin nach Ludwigslust. 1765 wurde unter Buschs Leitung der Grundstein der Hofkirche gelegt und nach deren Vollendung 1772 der Bau des neuen Residenzschlosses begonnen, das 1777 bezogen werden konnte. Die zahlreichen gleichzeitigen Baustellen beschäftigten mehrere hundert Maurer, Zimmerleute und andere Handwerker, die Bauern der Umgebung mussten Hand- und Spanndienste leisten und Herzog Friedrich beaufsichtigte die Arbeiten regelmäßig. Die Ausgaben für das Bauprojekt konnten dadurch begrenzt werden, dass auf teure Materialien wie Marmor und edle Hölzer weitgehend verzichtet und stattdessen Pappmaché, der sogenannte Ludwigsluster Carton, eingesetzt wurde. Die Kosten trug die herzogliche Rentkammer, deren Einnahmen Erlöse aus der Forstkasse des waldreichen Gebiets aufbesserten. Als Herzog Friedrich 1785 starb, war der Schlossbezirk weitgehend vollendet. Ludwigslust hatte sich von einem Gutsdorf zu einem kleinen Fürstenhof entwickelt, der über einen Zeitraum von rund 80Jahren das kulturelle und politische Zentrum des Landesteils Mecklenburg-Schwerin bildete., \\"Mit Friedrichs Tod ging die neue Residenz des kinderlosen Herzogs an seinen Neffen und Nachfolger Friedrich Franz I. über. Dieser ließ den kaum vollendeten Barockgarten im nunmehr zeitgemäßen Stil als Englischen Landschaftsgarten erweitern und ab 1809 die Stadtanlage durch Johann Georg Barca ausbauen. Nach Friedrich Franz Tod verlegte sein ihm folgender Enkel Paul Friedrich den Hof 1837 zurück nach Schwerin, womit Ludwigslust auf den Status einer Sommerresidenz sank. Friedrich Franz II. ließ die Gartenanlage von 1852 bis 1860 durch Peter Joseph Lenné gestalterisch überarbeiten, dennoch wurde das Schloss in der zweiten Hälfte des 19.Jahrhunderts nur noch selten bewohnt. Große Teile der Ludwigsluster Kunstsammlung kamen ab 1879 nach Schwerin. Bedeutung als dauerhafter Wohnsitz erlangte das Schloss noch einmal mit dem Ende des Ersten Weltkriegs, als es im Zuge der Abdankung und der Enteignung der Mecklenburgischen Großherzöge von Friedrich Franz IV. bezogen wurde. Einige der Innenräume konnten ab 1922 erstmals von der Öffentlichkeit besichtigt werden. Die herzogliche Familie bewohnte Ludwigslust bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs, das Schlossgebäude überstand die Kriegszeit ohne bauliche Schäden. Das bei Kriegsende zunächst von westalliierten Truppen besetzte Ludwigslust entging zudem den Verwüstungen, die zahlreiche Schloss- und Herrenhausanlagen im Osten Deutschlands durch die Rote Armee widerfuhren. Dennoch gingen Teile der beweglichen Ausstattung in der Folgezeit durch Plünderung und Vernachlässigung verloren.\\", Vom Verwaltungsbau zum Schlossmuseum., In den ersten Nachkriegsjahren beherbergte das Schloss die örtliche Kommandantur der Roten Armee. Die herzogliche Familie wurde bei der Bodenreform 1947 enteignet und das Schloss schließlich vom Kreis Ludwigslust übernommen. Anfängliche Pläne, in dem Bauwerk ein Museum einzurichten, wurden nicht weiter verfolgt; die bis dahin im Schloss verbliebenen Kunstschätze gelangten teilweise nach Schwerin oder wurden im Schloss eingelagert. Die einstige herzogliche Residenz diente in der DDR-Zeit als Sitz der Kreisbehörden; in die historischen Innenräume zogen für mehrere Jahrzehnte Staatsorgane der DDR ein., Im Jahr 1986 wurden das Schloss und die Gartenanlagen unter die Verwaltung des Staatlichen Museums Schwerin gestellt und größere Maßnahmen zur Bausicherung vorgenommen, sowie erstmals wieder Räume für die Öffentlichkeit zur Besichtigung freigegeben. Das Schloss wurde zum \\"Museum für höfische Kunst und Wohnkultur\\". Die Kreisverwaltung blieb bis 1991 im Schloss, seitdem wurde es schrittweise einer musealen Nutzung zugeführt und in Abschnitten bis Ende 2015 saniert. Die Finanzierung der Restaurierung erfolgte zum Teil mit EU-Mitteln. Die Sanierung der Fassade kostete 4,8Millionen Euro, die Restaurierung der Innenräume weitere 12Millionen Euro. Die Arbeiten an der Großen Kaskade wurden 2007 begonnen und 2010 abgeschlossen; sie kosteten rund 450.000 Euro. Schloss und Park sind zu besichtigen; bis 2005 wurden im Schlossmuseum jährlich zwischen 50.000 und 60.000 Besucher gezählt. Neben vereinzelten Sonderausstellungen organisiert ein Förderverein Schlosskonzerte und ein regelmäßiges Barockfest, weiter findet alljährlich das \\"Kleine Fest im Großen Park\\" statt. Im Herbst 2017 wurden allerdings große Teile des alten Baumbestands der Gartenanlagen durch die Stürme Xavier und Herwart verwüstet; die Schließung der Lücken wird Jahrzehnte beanspruchen., Das Schloss ist eine der Außenstellen des Staatlichen Museums: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Barockbauwerk, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Baudenkmal, Ludwigslust, Haus Mecklenburg, Biografisches Museum, Museum, Landkreis Ludwigslust-Parchim, Parkanlage, Schloss Ludwigslust, Staatliches Museum Schwerin."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Fletcher-Klasse, Militärschiffsklasse (Vereinigte Staaten), Zerstörerklasse], Die Fletcher-Klasse war eine Klasse von Zerstörern der United States Navy. Die Schiffe wurden ab 1941 gebaut und dienten ab 1942 in der Navy. Bis 1944 wurden 175 Schiffe in elf verschiedenen Werften gebaut. Damit ist die Fletcher-Klasse eine der zahlenmäßig stärksten Klassen von Überwasserkriegsschiffen der Welt. Die Schiffe nahmen an allen großen Operationen der US Navy während des Pazifikkriegs teil. Die Dienstzeit in der US-Marine dauerte mit Unterbrechungen bis 1971, etliche Zerstörer wurden an andere Nationen, darunter auch Deutschland, abgegeben und blieben noch lange im aktiven Dienst. Das letzte Schiff der Klasse, die \\"BAM Cuitlahuac\\" (die ehemalige USS \\"John Rodgers\\"), wurde 2002, nach insgesamt 60 Jahren Dienstzeit, bei der mexikanischen Marine ausgemustert., Geschichte., Planungen., Nach dem Eintritt Großbritanniens in den Zweiten Weltkrieg 1939 ging die US-amerikanische Regierung unter Franklin D. Roosevelt davon aus, dass die Vereinigten Staaten ebenfalls in den Krieg hineingezogen würden und dass Japan der Hauptgegner sein würde. Roosevelt sah in der Aufrüstung ein Mittel zur Bekämpfung der Arbeitslosigkeit, der drohende Kriegseintritt machte jedoch deutlich, dass die Flotte tatsächlich verstärkt werden musste. Die Zerstörer der US-Marine waren zum größten Teil veraltete Modelle aus der Zeit des Ersten Weltkriegs, die Produktion der neuen Zerstörer der \\"Gleaves-\\" und der \\"Benson-Klasse\\" lief nur langsam an, die Zerstörerklassen aus der Zwischenkriegszeit waren zum größten Teil noch nach Entwürfen aus dem Ersten Weltkrieg gebaut worden oder unterlagen den Begrenzungen der Washingtoner Flottenabkommen., Die Planungen für neue Schlachtschiffe und Flugzeugträger mit einer Geschwindigkeit von über 30 Knoten machten schnelle Zerstörer mit einer Höchstgeschwindigkeit zwischen 35 und 38 Knoten erforderlich, die eine entsprechend starke Antriebsanlage benötigten. Das für die Planungen zuständige \\"General Ship Board\\" erhielt sechs verschiedene Entwürfe für die neue Schiffsklasse, die sich an den Vorgaben (1.600 Tonnen Verdrängung, vier bis fünf 5-Zoll-Geschütze, 6.500 Seemeilen Reichweite bei 12 Knoten) und den Vorgängerbauten der \\"Gleaves-\\", \\"Benson-\\" und \\"Sims\\"-Klassen orientierten. Um die Jahreswende 1939/1940 wurden drei neue Entwürfe vorgelegt, die sich gegenüber den vorherigen Entwürfen durch die Rückkehr zum Flushdecker-Konzept auszeichneten und eine gestiegene Wasserverdrängung für die geforderte Panzerung der Brücken-, Führungs- und Maschinenräume nutzten. Ebenfalls konnte so gegenüber den Vorentwürfen die Flugabwehrbewaffnung von vier 12,7-mm-Maschinengewehren mit einer 28-mm-Vierlingsflak verstärkt werden und die Antriebskraft auf 60.000 WPS für 38 Knoten Konstruktionsgeschwindigkeit gesteigert werden., Am 27. Januar 1940 fällte das \\"Board\\" seine Entscheidung für den Entwurf des renommierten Konstruktionsbüros Gibbs &amp; Cox mit fünf Einzeltürmen und vergab die Bauaufträge für die ersten 130 Schiffe der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\". Davon wurden elf Schiffe, darunter zwei Prototypen für alternative Antriebe, später wieder gestrichen. 1941 wurden 16, 1942 40 weitere Zerstörer bewilligt., Bau., Um die große Anzahl an Zerstörern innerhalb kurzer Zeit fertigzustellen, wurden die Bauaufträge an elf Werften vergeben, darunter auch solchen, die zuvor noch kein Schiff für die US-Marine gebaut hatten. Bethlehem Steel erhielt den Auftrag für 43 Schiffe und verteilte diese auf die Standorte San Francisco (18), Staten Island (15) und San Pedro (10). Mit 31 Schiffen erhielt Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine den größten Auftrag als einzelne Werft. 29 Zerstörer wurden bei der Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey gebaut, 21 bei Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding in Seattle, Washington. Im Boston Navy Yard wurden 14 Schiffe auf Kiel gelegt, bei Consolidated Steel Shipyards in Orange, Texas, zwölf, beim Charleston Navy Yard zehn, im Puget Sound Naval Shipyard acht und bei Gulf Shipbuilding in Chickasaw, Alabama sieben Zerstörer gebaut., Die Kiellegung der ersten Schiffe, USS \\"Nicholas\\" und USS \\"O’Bannon\\", erfolgte am 3. März 1941 bei Bath Iron Works. Das Typschiff, die USS \\"Fletcher\\", wurde am 2.Oktober 1941 bei Federal Shipyards in Kearny auf Kiel gelegt. Die \\"Nicholas\\" lief am 19.Februar 1942 als erstes Schiff vom Stapel, die Indienststellung erfolgte am 4.Juni 1942, dreieinhalb Wochen vor dem Typschiff der Klasse. Das letzte Schiff, die USS \\"Rooks\\", lief am 6.Juni 1944 bei Seattle-Tacoma vom Stapel., Änderungen., Noch während des Baus der ersten Einheiten flossen bereits die ersten Erfahrungen aus dem Krieg in die Konstruktion ein. Es zeigte sich, dass die ursprünglichen runden Steuerhäuser der ersten Schiffe eine schlechte Rundumsicht boten. Sie wurden daher bei den späteren Schiffen durch einen die Vorderseite umgebenden Umlauf ergänzt, der die beiden Brückennocken miteinander verband., Nur wenige Einheiten wurden mit dem ursprünglich vorgesehenen 28-mm-Vierling und 12,7-mm-Maschinengewehren ausgerüstet, ersterer wurde durch eine 40-mm-Doppellafette ersetzt, zudem gehörten nun sechs 20-mm-Flugabwehrgeschütze zum Entwurf., Der Mangel an Aluminium während des Krieges machte es nötig, die oberen Aufbauten ebenfalls aus Stahl zu fertigen, was eine Gewichtserhöhung um 50 Tonnen mit sich brachte und die Topplastigkeit der Schiffe erhöhte. Um dem entgegenzuwirken, wurde die Feuerleitanlage um zwei Meter nach unten verlegt, außerdem wurde auf einen Großteil der Panzerung der Kommandobrücke verzichtet., Dabei wurde ebenfalls die Brücke dahingehend modifiziert, dass der von Beginn an offene Umlauf ins Deckshaus integriert war. Der geschlossene Teil wurde weiter nach achtern versetzt und hatte nunmehr eine eckige Form., Mitte 1942 wurde deutlich, dass zur Koordination der Waffen und zur Verarbeitung der Informationen an Bord ein zentraler Lageraum notwendig war. Die Schiffe wurden daher mit einem Combat Information Center (CIC) nachgerüstet, das sich unterhalb der Kommandobrücke auf dem Niveau des Hauptdecks befand und in dem alle Informationen während des Gefechts zusammenliefen., Umbauten., Zweiter Weltkrieg., Schon 1940 gab es Planungen, sechs Zerstörer mit einer Bordfluganlage für ein Bordflugzeug auszurüsten, um auch kleineren Zerstörerverbänden Luftaufklärungskapazitäten zu geben. Bei fünf Schiffen (DD-476 bis DD-480) wurden während des Baus 1942/43 die notwendigen Änderungen vorgenommen, jedoch nach wenigen Monaten Ende 1943 wieder rückgängig gemacht. Gründe hierfür waren unter anderem, dass die Flugzeuge auf den kleinen Schiffen nicht mit ihrer vollen Waffenlast ausgerüstet werden konnten, aber es zeigte sich auch, dass das Konzept aufgrund der mittlerweile angewachsenen Trägerflotte und der vergrößerten Anzahl von Kreuzern und Schlachtschiffen, die Aufklärungsflugzeuge trugen, überflüssig geworden war. Dazu kam, dass eine weitere Ausrüstung der Zerstörer mit Luftabwehr aufgrund fehlender Platz- und Gewichtsreserven unmöglich war. Das sechste Schiff DD-481 wurde 1943 nicht mehr umgerüstet, sondern in der ursprünglichen Konfiguration fertiggestellt., Als Reaktion auf die verstärkten japanischen Angriffe mit Tokkotai-Fliegern (Kamikaze) wurde bei über 50 Schiffen der Fletcher-Klasse die Luftabwehrbewaffnung im Sommer 1945 drastisch verstärkt. Die Geschütze wurden zum Teil mit Radarsteuerungen ausgerüstet, viele 20-mm-Einzelgeschütze durch Doppellafetten ersetzt und die Torpedobewaffnung verringert., Kalter Krieg., Mit dem Anwachsen der Spannungen zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten und der Sowjetunion und der sowjetischen Aufrüstung im Marinebereich wurde deutlich, dass die US-amerikanische Marine mehr U-Jagdschiffe benötigt. Aus diesem Grund wurden 1948 aus der Reserveflotte 18 eingemottete Fletcher-Zerstörer wieder reaktiviert und mit verstärkter U-Jagdbewaffnung ausgestattet., Zusätzlich zu den 18 U-Jagdzerstörern wurden zu Beginn des Koreakriegs über 60 weitere \\"Fletchers\\" aus der Reserveflotte geholt und für ihren neuen Einsatzzweck teilweise umgebaut. Bei 43 Schiffen wurde der mittlere Geschützturm entfernt, an seiner Stelle wurden zwei 76-mm-Doppellafetten installiert. Zusätzlich erhielten die Schiffe neue Feuerleitanlagen. Diese Schiffe wurden inoffiziell als \\"La-Valette-Klasse\\" bezeichnet. Die restlichen reaktivierten Schiffe behielten ihre Bewaffnung aus dem Zweiten Weltkrieg und wurden als \\"Daly-Klasse\\" bezeichnet., FRAM II., Ursprünglich war 1957 beschlossen worden, alle 18 Schiffe, die bereits 1948 den U-Jagdumbau erhalten hatten, nach FRAM II umzubauen. 1958 begann der Umbau der USS \\"Hazelwood\\", die als Testschiff für die Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter dienen sollte. In der Folge wurden drei Zerstörer (USS \\"Radford\\", USS \\"Jenkins\\" und USS \\"Nicholas\\") in Pearl Harbor umgebaut und mit einem Startplatz sowie einem Hangar für die DASH-Drohnen ausgerüstet. 1961 wurden die Umbaupläne für die 15 übrigen DDEs gestrichen, so dass es bei drei Umbauten der Fletcher-Klasse blieb. Diese Schiffe wurden inoffiziell als \\"Radford-Klasse\\" bezeichnet. Die drei Zerstörer verließen auch als erste Schiffe des FRAM-II-Programms 1969 die US-Marine., Dienstzeit., Die Zerstörer der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\" wurden zwischen 1942 und 1944 in Dienst gestellt. Nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurden 145 der verbliebenen Zerstörer stillgelegt und der Reserveflotte zugeteilt. Zu Beginn des Koreakrieges wurden zusätzlich zu den 18 umgebauten U-Jagdzerstörern aus den Jahren 1948/49 über 60 weitere Zerstörer reaktiviert, 19 davon wurden nach Ende der Kampfhandlungen in Korea wieder ausgemustert. Die übrigen Zerstörer blieben bis Ende der 1960er Jahre, Anfang der 1970er Jahre in Dienst. Das letzte Schiff der Klasse, das bei der US-Marine außer Dienst gestellt wurde, war die USS \\"Mullany\\", die am 6. Oktober 1971 stillgelegt und aus den Schiffsregistern gestrichen wurde., Zwischen 1958 und 1960 wurden sechs Schiffe der \\"Fletcher-Klasse\\" (USS \\"Anthony\\", USS \\"Ringgold\\", USS \\"Wadsworth\\", USS \\"Claxton\\", USS \\"Dyson\\" und USS \\"Charles Ausburne\\") als Waffenhilfe an die damals noch im Aufbau befindliche Bundesmarine übergeben, wo sie als \\"Klasse 119\\" (Schiffsnamen: Zerstörer 1 bis Zerstörer 6) bis in die 1980er Jahre im Einsatz waren. Ursprünglich als Artillerieunterstützer für amphibische Landungen gedacht, wurden sie später zumeist als U-Jagdschiffe in den NATO-Verbänden im Nordatlantik sowie zur Sicherung der Ostseezugänge eingesetzt.

Jahrhundert)], Al-Sayyid Shaykh bin Ahmad al-Hadi (Jawi geb. 22. November 1867 in Kampung Hulu, Malakka, gest. 20. Februar 1934 in Jelutong auf Penang), auch Syed Sheikh al-Hady geschrieben, war ein malaiisch-arabischer Unternehmer, Publizist und Schriftsteller in British Malaya, der zu den Pionieren der malaiischen Bildungs- und Nationalbewegung gehörte und sich für eine am Rationalismus orientierte Reform des Islams im Malaiischen Archipel einsetzte. Sayyid Shaykh war stark von den ägyptischen Modernisten Muhammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905) und Qāsim Amīn (1863–1908) beeinflusst und warb unter den malaiischen Muslimen für deren Ideen, insbesondere auch für ein modernes Frauenbild. Dafür gründete er mehrere Zeitschriften und Schulen und verfasste eine große Zahl von Artikeln und Büchern. Eine Besonderheit, die al-Hadi von anderen zeitgenössischen islamischen Reformgelehrten abhebt, ist sein Einsatz von Romanen als Mittel zur Propagierung islamischer Ideale. Da sein Liebesroman \\"Hikayat Faridah Hanom\\" („Die Geschichte der Farida Hanom“) als der erste malaiische Roman schlechthin gilt, wird al-Hadi auch „Vater des malaiischen Romans“ (\\"Bapa novel Melayu\\") genannt. Als Modernist und Progressivist befürwortete Sayyid Shaykh auch die britische Kolonialherrschaft über Malaya und rief zur Gründung anglo-malaiischer Schulen auf., Abstammung., Sayyid Shaykh al-Hadi stammte väterlicherseits aus der arabischen Familie der Bā-ʿAlawī, deren ursprüngliche Heimat der Hadramaut ist. Die Bā-ʿAlawī sind Saiyids, also Nachkommen des Propheten Mohammed. Ein Vorfahre Sayyid Shaykhs war gegen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts aus dem Hadramaut eingewandert und hatte sich in Malakka, einem der ältesten und wichtigsten malaiischen Häfen, niedergelassen. Sein Großvater Hasan ibn as-Saqqāf (auch \\"al-Sagoff\\" geschrieben), der bereits in Kampung Hulu, einem Stadtteil von Malakka, geboren war, hatte wie viele andere arabische Einwanderer eine einheimische malaiische Frau geheiratet. Aus der Ehe mit ihr ging 1837 Sayyid Shaykhs Vater Ahmad al-Hadi hervor. Dieser wurde später in der Landwirtschaft und im Handel tätig und heiratete 1858 Dhu l-Hiddscha, eine Frau aus der königlichen Familie von Malakka, mit der er fünf Kinder hatte. Die Familie besaß in der Nähe von Malakka Ländereien. Aufgrund seiner gemischten arabisch-malaiischen Abkunft wird Sayyid Shaykh al-Hadi der Gruppe der arabischen Peranakan zugeordnet., Leben., Sayyid Syeikhs frühe Jahre sind nicht gut dokumentiert, da er keine Autobiographie verfasst hat und auch kein Zeitgenosse darüber Informationen zusammengetragen hat. Die meisten Angaben zu dieser Zeit stammen aus zwei biographischen Abschnitten seines Sohnes Sayyid Alwi. Demnach wurde Sayyid Shaykh am 25. Radschab 1284 der Hidschra (= 22. November 1867) als viertes Kind seiner Eltern in Kampung Hulu, einem Stadtteil von Malakka, geboren. Seine anderen vier Geschwister verstarben schon im Kindesalter., Auf Pulau Penyengat., Um das Jahr 1874, als Sayyid Shaykh sieben Jahre alt war, zogen sein Vater und dessen Bruder Sayyid Muhammad von Malakka auf die zu den Riauinseln gehörende Penyengat-Insel, auf der damals die buginesischen Unter-Könige (\\"Yamtuan Muda\\") des Riau-Lingga-Sultanats residierten. Die beiden Brüder hatten Beziehungen zum dortigen Herrscherhaus, denn ein Großonkel von Sayyid Shaykh hatte in deren Familie eingeheiratet. Sayyid Shaykh wurde hier durch Raja Haji Ali Kelana, den Sohn und designierten Nachfolger (\\"Raja Muda\\") von Raja Muhammad Yusuf, dem damaligen Yamtuan Muda, adoptiert. Sayyid Shaykh hat später in einem Artikel in Andenken an seinen Adoptivvater geschrieben, dass er die Gunst des Raja seit dem Alter von 15 Jahren erfahren habe. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass die Adoption durch ihn in diesem Alter erfolgt ist., Nachdem Sayyid Shaykh die Grundlagen der malaiischen Sprache und der islamischen Glaubenslehren erlernt hatte, wurde er zusammen mit seinem Onkel Sayyid Muhammad für weitere Studien auf eine traditionelle religiöse Schule in Kuala Terengganu geschickt. Hier heiratete er ein Mädchen aus Terengganu und verbrachte viel Zeit mit der königlichen Familie, was deswegen möglich war, weil sein Onkel eng mit dem Sultan befreundet war. Für seine Studien interessierte er sich dagegen nur wenig. Nach ein oder zwei Jahren wurde er von seinem Adoptivvater nach Pulau Penyengat zurückgerufen, wo er nun eine volle Ausbildung in malaiischer Sprache und Kultur sowie Religion erhielt. Dabei unterrichtete ihn Raja Ali Kelana, der über eine umfassende islamisch-religiöse und malaiische Bildung verfügte, teilweise selbst. Im Kreise der königlichen Familie wurde Sayyid Shaykh mit dem Kosenamen \\"Engku Anum\\" („Herr Überreif“ oder „Herr Rötlich“) angeredet., Sayyid Shaykh las auf Pulau Penynengat sehr viel in religiösen Büchern und Zeitschriften aus Ägypten. In den frühen 1890er Jahren beteiligte er sich an dem Aufbau des \\"Persekutuan Rushdiyyah\\", eines Studierclubs ähnlich denjenigen, die zur selben Zeit in Singapur eingerichtet wurden, und nahm an seinen Aktivitäten teil. Sein Spitzname in diesem Kreis war \\"Wan Anum\\". Zusammen mit den anderen Mitgliedern des Clubs soll er hier bis spät in die Nacht diskutiert haben, über Theologie, die Rückständigkeit der Muslime und die Möglichkeiten, wie man die Muslime im Orient aus ihrem Zustand der Apathie hin zu Fortschritt und Wohlstand bringen könnte. Außerdem wurde ihm die Verantwortung für das \\"rumah waqaf\\", das Stiftungshaus übertragen, in dem Reisende untergebracht wurden, wenn sie den Hof des Herrschers besuchten. Dort hatte er Gelegenheit, viele bekannte Gelehrte kennenzulernen und sein religiöses Wissen durch Diskussionen zu erweitern. Auch Haji Husain aus Palembang und Haji Salih von den Minangkabau, die später seine religiösen Lehrer wurden, soll er hier getroffen haben., Auf der Penyengat-Insel veränderten sich auch die familiären Verhältnisse von Sayyid Shaykh. 1891 heiratete er Sharifa Sheikhun, die älteste Tochter seines Onkels Sayyid Muhammad, die im Haushalt von Raja Ali Kelana lebte. Mit ihr hatte er zwei Söhne und zwei Töchter, nämlich Sayyid Alwi (geb. 1892), Sayyid Ahmad (geb. 1896), der schon als Kind starb, sowie Aisyah (geb. 1897) und Umhani (geb. 1898). Sein Vater Sayyid Ahmad starb am 9. Juni 1895 auf Pulau Penyengat., Etwa um das Jahr 1894/95 wurde al-Hadi zusammen mit dem malaiischen Gelehrten Tahir Jalaluddin dazu eingeladen, die Söhne des Sultans und des Raja Muda bei einer Reise nach Mekka und Kairo zu begleiten. In Kairo besuchte die Gruppe Vorlesungen bei dem islamischen Reformdenker Muhammad ʿAbduh (gest. 1905). Darüber hinaus gibt es Berichte, dass Sayyid Shaykh in Kairo auch Raschīd Ridā und in Mekka den malaiischen Gelehrten Abdullah bin Muhammad Saleh Zawawi traf., In Singapur (1901–1911)., Als Geschäftsführer im Dienste seines Adoptivvaters., Sayyid Shaykhs Adoptivvater Raja Ali Kelana kaufte 1896 eine Ziegelfabrik auf der zu Niederländisch-Indien gehörenden Batam-Insel, die in zwei Stunden Entfernung von Singapur lag. Dieses Unternehmen mit dem Namen Batam Brickworks und 200 Mann Belegschaft versorgte die Britischen Kolonialbehörden, die Stadtverwaltung von Singapur, die Eisenbahnverwaltung in Singapur und die Federated Malay States mit Ziegeln. 1901 ernannte Raja Ali Kelana seinen Adoptivsohn Sayyid Shaykh zuerst zum Agenten und dann zum Geschäftsführer des Unternehmens in Singapur. Deshalb zog al-Hadi noch im gleichen Jahr nach Singapur in die Prinsep Street, wo sich die Vertretung des Unternehmens befand. Sein Sohn Sayyid Alwi begleitete ihn nach Singapur und besuchte dort die Kampong Glam Malay School. Sayyid Shaykh hatte diese Schule deswegen für ihn ausgewählt, weil sie ihn für den anschließenden Besuch einer englischsprachigen Oberschule qualifizierte. In Singapur heiratete al-Hadi eine zweite Frau, dieses Mal eine Malaiin. Aus der Ehe mit ihr ging 1903 die gemeinsame Tochter Maryam hervor., Im Oktober 1904 begleitete Sayyid Shaykh seinen Adoptivvater auf einer Reise in den Nahen Osten, die darauf abzielte, den osmanischen Kalifen um Unterstützung für die Wiedereinsetzung des Yamtuan Muda zu bitten. Es ist allerdings nicht klar, ob die Delegation überhaupt bis zum osmanischen Kalifen gelangt ist. Als die Delegation im März 1905 nach Südostasien zurückkehrte, hatte der Sultan von Riau-Lingga bereits einen Vertrag mit den Niederländern geschlossen, der keinen Hinweis mehr auf das Amt des Yamtuan Muda enthielt und dem niederländischen General-Gouverneur das Recht einräumte, den Thronfolger des Riau-Lingga-Sultanats selbst zu benennen., Die Zeitschrift \\"al-Imām\\"., Während seiner Zeit in Singapur verkehrte al-Hadi im Arabischen Club und näherte sich der Position der Kaum Muda an, der malaiischen Modernisten, die den Lehren Muhammad ʿAbduhs folgten. Ein Foto aus dem Jahr 1906, das für die malaiische Zeitschrift aufgenommen wurde, für die sich al-Hadi als Agent betätigte, zeigt ihn in der Kleidung der Kaum Muda mit Anzug und Fes., Zusammen mit Tahir Jalaluddin und vier anderen Personen, dem Gelehrten Muhammad ibn ʿAqil, den beiden Händlern Muhammad bin Salim al-Kalali und ʿAwad bin Saidin und ʿAbbas bin Muhammad Taha, gründete al-Hadi im Juli 1906 die Zeitschrift \\"al-Imām\\". Sie erschien in Jawi-Schrift und folgte inhaltlich dem Modell von Raschīd Ridās Zeitschrift \\"al-Manār\\". Aufgrund seiner Orientierung an dieser Zeitschrift wurde Sayyid Shaykh in der malaiischen Gelehrtenwelt auch als „Anführer der Manār-Gruppe“ (\\"Ketua Kaum al-Manār\\") betrachtet. Al-Hadi steuerte auch selbst einige Artikel und Übersetzungen aus dem Arabischen zu der Zeitschrift bei. Seinen Übersetzungen lagen Artikel aus den ägyptischen Zeitschriften \\"al-Liwā \\", \\"al-ʿĀlam al-islāmī\\" und al-Muaiyad zugrunde., Die Verbindung mit dem Hof von Riau und seinen intellektuellen Kreisen trug zu der besonderen Wichtigkeit von \\"al-Imām\\" in der Riau-Region bei. Al-Hadis Adoptivvater Raja Ali Kelana unterstützte die Zeitschrift und steuerte auch selbst Artikel zu ihr bei., Im März 1908 gründete al-Hadi mit 20.000 Dollar Startkapital zusammen mit Sayyid Mohammad bin Akil und Sayyid Hasan bin Shahah die \\"Al-Imam Printing Company\\". Sie veröffentlichte 1908 eine Serie von seinen Artikeln zum Thema Erziehung, Fast zur gleichen Zeit, im Februar 1908, gründete al-Hadi zusammen mit seinen Freunden außerdem die erste ar: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Araber, Frauenrechtler, Geboren 1867, Gestorben 1934, Literatur (Malaiisch), Mann, Person des Islam (Malaysia), Verleger (20.

Jahrhundert, Endphase des Zweiten Weltkriegs, Großbrand, Katastrophe 1945, Konflikt 1945, Luftkriegsoperation der Royal Air Force im Zweiten Weltkrieg, Luftkriegsoperation der United States Army Air Forces, Sachsen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus], Die Luftangriffe auf Dresden und den Großraum der Stadt im Zweiten Weltkrieg fanden erstmals im Herbst 1944 statt, gefolgt von vier Angriffswellen der Royal Air Force (RAF) und United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) vom 13. bis 15. Februar 1945. Diese forderten zwischen 22.700 und 25.000 Todesopfer, zerstörten große Teile der Innenstadt und der industriellen und militärischen Infrastruktur Dresdens. Sechsstellige Opferzahlen, die die nationalsozialistische Propaganda in Umlauf brachte, wurden durch eine umfassende historisch-empirische Untersuchung widerlegt., Die Angriffe vom Februar 1945 verstärkten die Kritik an der Luftkriegsführung der Westalliierten seit 1942 erheblich, besonders an der britischen Area Bombing Directive. Historiker diskutieren bis heute, ob diese Flächenbombardements als militärisch notwendig und zweckmäßig oder als Kriegsverbrechen zu werten sind., Das jährliche friedliche Gedenken an den 13. Februar 1945 in Dresden wird seit Ende der 1990er-Jahre regelmäßig von Rechtsextremisten für geschichtsrevisionistische Zwecke benutzt., Hintergründe und Ziele., Im Herbst und Winter 1944 rückten die Alliierten langsamer als geplant vor. Die deutsche Wehrmacht verhinderte trotz verstreuter eigener Truppen die alliierte Operation Market Garden, den Rhein zu überschreiten. Zum Jahresende folgte die deutsche Ardennenoffensive an der Westfront. Auch der Vormarsch der Roten Armee stockte seit deren Operation Bagration (Sommer 1944) bis zur Weichsel-Oder-Operation (ab Januar 1945). Auch danach hielten die Deutschen weitere zu „Festungen“ ausgebaute Städte östlich der Oder, unter anderen Breslau und Königsberg., Damals bereiteten die Alliierten den Einmarsch ihrer Bodentruppen in die „Festung Deutschland“ zur Entscheidungsschlacht gegen das NS-Regime vor. Die Westalliierten begannen ab Februar 1945 mit verstärkten Luftangriffen zur Eroberung des Ruhrgebiets und nutzten ihre seit März 1944 bestehende Luftüberlegenheit, um zahlreiche deutsche Militär-, Verkehrs-, Verwaltungs- und Regierungseinrichtungen, Produktionsstätten sowie große und kleine deutsche Städte zu bombardieren. Die Rote Armee drang bis Ende Januar 1945 auf der geografischen Breite von Berlin zur Oder vor und stand kurz davor, Schlesien zu erobern. Sie sollte erst bis März auf die für die Schlacht um Berlin notwendige Stärke anwachsen. Von Schlesien flohen Millionen Deutsche vor allem nach Mitteldeutschland. Versprengte Wehrmachteinheiten versuchten, Wiederaufstellungsräume hinter der noch ungefestigten sowjetischen Frontlinie zu erreichen., Seit Sommer 1944 plante das britische RAF Bomber Command einen besonders schweren Vernichtungsschlag (Operation Thunderclap), um den Durchhaltewillen der Deutschen endgültig zu brechen. Doch im Januar 1945 errechnete der britische Geheimdienst, dass die Wehrmacht nochmals bis zu 42 Divisionen an die Ostfront verlegen könnte. Nun wurden die Angriffspläne für die RAF und USAAF modifiziert. Dresden war bereits am 2. Februar 1945 als Ausweichziel für einen schweren Bombenangriff auf Berlin bei dortigem Schlechtwetter vorgesehen. Auf der Konferenz von Jalta vom 4. bis 11. Februar 1945 drängte der sowjetische Generaloberst Alexei Innokentjewitsch Antonow die westlichen Alliierten dazu, wichtige ostdeutsche Verkehrsknotenpunkte zu bombardieren, um weitere deutsche Truppentransporte an die Ostfront zu verhindern und so die Rote Armee von Gegenangriffen zu entlasten und ihr Vorrücken zu erleichtern. Am 7. Februar 1945 legten die alliierten Luftwaffenstäbe einvernehmlich eine östliche Ziellinie für diese Bombardierungen fest. Am 8. Februar sandte US-General Carl A. Spaatz eine neue Zielliste kommender Bombenangriffe der USAAF nach Moskau, auf der die Verkehrszentren Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden und Chemnitz in die zweithöchste Dringlichkeitsstufe nach 21 mitteldeutschen Hydrierwerken eingestuft wurden. Am 12. Februar kündigte Spaatz den USAAF-Angriff auf den Verschiebebahnhof Dresden für den Folgetag, bei Schlechtwetter für den 14. Februar, an. Der nächtliche RAF-Angriff am 13. Februar wurde den Sowjets nicht eigens angekündigt., Dresden im Krieg., Dresden hatte vor Kriegsbeginn laut Volkszählung vom 17. Mai 1939 genau 629.713 Einwohner und war damit die siebentgrößte deutsche Stadt. Das Stadtgebiet blieb bis zum August 1944 von Luftangriffen verschont, weil es bis dahin außerhalb der Reichweite und damit der Zielplanungen alliierter Bomber lag. Im Herbst 1944 war Dresden neben Breslau der letzte größere unbeschädigte Verkehrsknotenpunkt, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsstandort des Deutschen Reiches., Verkehr., Der Eisenbahnknoten Dresden war drittgrößter Bahnumschlagplatz des Deutschen Reichs. Hier kreuzten sich Bahnstrecken nach Berlin, Prag, Breslau, Warschau, Leipzig und Nürnberg. Da Bahnanlagen anderer Städte bereits schwer beschädigt waren, wurde der Bahnverkehr des Raums Leipzig–Berlin–Dresden ab 1944 großenteils über den Güter- und Rangierbahnhof Dresden-Friedrichstadt, den Hauptbahnhof und den Bahnhof Dresden-Neustadt abgewickelt. Zudem versorgten die Anlagen die Industriebetriebe Freitals und Bergbaubetriebe im Erzgebirge sowie die Industriegebiete von Heidenau, Pirna, Radebeul, Coswig, Bautzen und Görlitz. Die großen Industriebetriebe Dresdens waren über den Kohlebahnhof mit dem Alberthafen und dem Güterbahnhof in der Leipziger Vorstadt (Neustadt) verbunden. Dresden war Sitz der Reichsbahndirektion Dresden, die den Eisenbahnbetrieb im größten Teil Sachsens und im nordwestlichen Sudetenland organisierte. Weiterhin betrieb die Deutsche Reichsbahn in Dresden ein Ausbesserungswerk und ein Bahnbetriebswerk. Auf verkehrsarmen Strecken im Umland und in Tunneln wurden Lokomotiven und Waggons aus gefährdeteren Regionen Deutschlands abgestellt., Transporte von Truppen und Material an die Front und von Gefangenen in die Vernichtungslager wurden über Dresden abgewickelt. Aus dem Osten strömten Millionen Flüchtlinge vor allem nach Mitteldeutschland. Als Ende 1944 immer mehr Menschen aus dem Osten flohen, war Dresden, für das ein Zuzugsverbot galt, für sie Durchgangsstation., Industrie., Dresdens dicht bebaute Innenstadt bestand hauptsächlich aus Bauten der Renaissance, des Barock und Mischgebieten der Gründerzeit auf mittelalterlichem Grundriss. Damals wurden Industriebetriebe in Hinterhöfen der Wohnbebauung oder als größere Komplexe direkt neben Siedlungen errichtet., Nach den Angaben der Dresdner Industrie- und Handelskammer von 1941 war die Stadt „einer der ersten Industriestandorte des Reiches“. Bis 1944 war die Mehrzahl der Betriebe fast vollständig auf Rüstung umgestellt. Nach Angaben der USAAF waren im Februar 1945 „mindestens 110“ Fabriken und Unternehmen in Dresden ansässig, die „legitime militärische Ziele“ darstellten. 50.000 Arbeiter habe allein die Rüstungsindustrie beschäftigt. Das Hauptstaatsarchiv Dresden zeigt die wirtschaftliche Bedeutung und Produktivität des intakten Großraums: Es nennt 44 Betriebe des Geld-, Bank- und Versicherungswesens, 29 Maschinenbauwerke, 13 auf Elektrotechnik und Gerätebau spezialisierte Industriebetriebe, 12 Betriebe der Lebens- und Genussmittelindustrie, vorwiegend der Zigarettenindustrie, 6 feinmechanische und optische Industriebetriebe sowie weitere Werke, die bis dahin weitgehend auf die Kriegswirtschaft umgestellt und unzerstört waren. Als militärisch bedeutsam werden außerdem besonders nach lokalen Quellen folgende Betriebe genannt:, Das Sachsenwerk, Avus und MIAG produzierten Maschinenteile in Niedersedlitz; das Panzerwerk MIAG-Mühlenbau (ehemals Mühlenbau Gebr. Seck) befand sich im damaligen Zschachwitzer Ortsteil Sporbitz. Betriebe in Dresden-Löbtau und im südlichen Umland (Erzgebirge) stellten Handgranaten her. Die Rüstungsfabrik Universelle-Werke J. C. Müller &amp; Co. produzierte in der Südvorstadt (Zwickauer Straße, Florastraße) mit Kriegsgefangenen, die auf dem Gelände des MIAG-Mühlenbaus in Leuben und in mehreren weiteren Lagern interniert waren. Die Industrie Dresdens war mit Zwangsarbeitern aus über die gesamte Stadt verteilten Lagern versorgt. Bisher weiß man von zehn Außenstellen der Konzentrationslager Flossenbürg, Auschwitz-Birkenau und anderer in der Stadt., Seit Ende 1944 wurden nochmals weitere 5000 KZ-Häftlinge nach Dresden transportiert, darunter etwa 2000 Juden. Sie wurden bis zu den Angriffen zusammen mit Dresdner Juden in überfüllten „Judenhäusern“ untergebracht und etwa in den Rüstungsbetrieben Goehle-Werke, bei der Osram GmbH, Bernsdorf und Co. und beim Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk zur Arbeit gezwungen (siehe Vernichtung durch Arbeit)., Militär., Dresden war im Februar 1945 die letzte intakte Garnisonsstadt im Rücken der Ostfront. Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts wurde die Albertstadt als Militärbezirk am nördlichen Stadtrand errichtet. Sie umfasste weitläufige Kasernenkomplexe und Versorgungseinrichtungen mit Gleisanschluss und eigenem Bahnhof, Speichern, Verladerampen, Heeresbäckerei, Metallverarbeitungs- und Handwerksbetrieben wie Sattlerei und Schneiderei. Zudem war sie mit Exerzierplätzen, Kanonenschussbahnen, einer Kirche und der Offizierschule des Heeres versorgt. Auch in Mickten sowie in Johannstadt wurden Kasernen errichtet bzw. ausgebaut., In Dresden waren ab 1921 Einheiten der Reichswehr stationiert. Nach der Machtergreifung der Nationalsozialisten wurde auch die Stadt bis 1939 nochmals militärisch ausgebaut und erhielt das Wehrbereichskommando. 1935 wurde der Fliegerhorst 38/III Dresden-Klotzsche gebaut, zwischen den damals noch nicht nach Dresden eingemeindeten Gemarkungen Klotzsche und Weixdorf (heute: Flughafen Dresden). Als erste im Deutschen Reich nahm 1936 die Luftkriegsschule Klotzsche (LKS 1) an der Hermann-Göring-Straße (heute Zur Wetterwarte) ihren Betrieb in 60 Gebäuden auf. Ab 1940 wurde der Flugplatz ausschließlich militärisch genutzt. Das Luftgaukommando IV wurde in Dresden-Strehlen am Rand der Innenstadt errichtet. Bei Nickern im Süden der Stadt entstand 1939/40 ein weiterer ausgedehnter Kasernenkomplex der Luftwaffe., Zudem standen 1939 etwa 20.000 Mann des IV. Wehrbereichs (Armeekorps) der 6. Armee in Dresden. Im Kriegsverlauf wurden die meisten regulären Truppenteile an die Front verlegt. So wurde im Dezember 1944 und Januar 1945 auch die leichte und schwere Flak aus Dresden in das Ruhrgebiet und nach Schlesien abgezogen.

Fletcher (1934–2012) vorgestelltes Fehlererkennungsverfahren in Form einer Prüfsumme. Mit dem Verfahren können Fehler, beispielsweise in einer digitalen Datenübertragung, entdeckt werden. Es basiert darauf, dass die einzelnen Bits der Nachricht nicht nur aufsummiert, sondern zusätzlich abhängig von ihrer Position gewichtet werden. Damit stellt der Algorithmus einen Kompromiss zwischen der langsameren, aber sensitiveren zyklischen Redundanzprüfung (CRC) und fehleranfälligen Verfahren wie einer einfachen Prüfsumme oder vertikaler Redundanzprüfung dar. Fletcher’s Checksum wird unter anderem in verschiedenen Netzwerkprotokollen und Dateisystemen verwendet., Der Algorithmus., Die binär übertragene Nachricht wird in Abschnitte der Länge formula_1 unterteilt, jeweils formula_1 Bit bilden somit einen Block. Der letzte Block wird gegebenenfalls für die Dauer des Algorithmus aufgefüllt und jeder Block als vorzeichenloser Integer interpretiert. Die Anzahl der Blöcke sei formula_3. Der Prüfwert besteht aus zwei verschiedenen Summen: Die erste (formula_4) summiert schrittweise sämtliche Blöcke auf, die zweite (formula_5) ist die Summe aller Zwischenergebnisse der ersten Summe. Der erste Block geht also formula_3-mal in formula_5 ein, der letzte dagegen nur einmal. Werden durch eine Störung beim Übertragen Bits invertiert oder zwei Blöcke unterschiedlichen Wertes vertauscht, verändert sich im Normalfall der Prüfwert: Der Fehler fällt auf., Da der Prüfwert unabhängig von der Länge der Nachricht in einer festen Anzahl von Bits (im Allgemeinen formula_8) übertragen werden können soll, werden beide Summen zuletzt modulo formula_9 gerechnet und anschließend in die Nachricht integriert. Normalerweise wird formula_10 oder formula_11 gewählt. Letzteres ist trotz leicht aufwändigerer Berechnung zu bevorzugen, weil formula_12 vergleichbar groß ist, im Gegensatz zu formula_13 jedoch nicht durch 2 – die Basis des Binärsystems – teilbar. Für das Ergebnis ist unerheblich, ob die Modulo-Operation nach jeder Addition oder am Ende angewandt wird. Um Überlauf zu vermeiden, erfolgt sie in einer Implementierung schon im Laufe der Berechnung., Die Anzahl an möglichen Prüfwerten von Fletcher’s Checksum beträgt formula_14. Eine genügend lange Nachricht vorausgesetzt, verringert sich also mit größerem formula_1 die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass eine verfälschte Nachricht denselben Prüfwert aufweist. Grundsätzlich kann für formula_1 eine beliebige natürliche Zahl gewählt werden, der Algorithmus würde entsprechend als Fletcher-formula_8 bezeichnet werden. Verbreitet sind Fletcher-16 und Fletcher-32, teilweise auch Fletcher-8., Beispielrechnung., Wird die Nachricht „Wikipedia“ in ASCII binär übermittelt, findet für Fletcher-16 mit formula_18 die in der Tabelle ausgeführte Rechnung statt. Ist ein Zwischenergebnis einer Summe größergleich 255, wird modulo angewendet, hier dargestellt als formula_19., Pseudocode., Nachfolgend ein Pseudocode für Fletcher-16 mit formula_18 ohne jegliche Optimierung. Als Prüfwert werden beide Summen aufeinanderfolgend zurückgegeben., Fletcher_16 \\"(data)\\", Input: Array \\"data\\" von 8-Bit-Integern, Output: 16-Bit-Prüfsumme zu \\"data\\", sum1 := 0, sum2 := 0, for i := 0 to \\"length (data)\\" do, sum1 := (sum1 + data[i]) modulo 255, sum2 := (sum2 + sum1) modulo 255, endfor, checksum := sum1 gefolgt von sum2, return checksum, Varianten., In einer Variante, die Fletchers ursprünglichem Algorithmus näher liegt, werden zwei Prüfblöcke der Länge formula_1 an das Ende der Nachricht angehängt, die derart gewählt werden, dass beide Summen des Prüfwerts über die neue, verlängerte Nachricht null betragen. Dazu werden die beiden Summen formula_4 und formula_5 zunächst wie gehabt berechnet. Dem ersten Prüfblock wird dann der Wert formula_24 zugewiesen, dem zweiten formula_5. Betty Salzberg zeigte kurz nach Fletchers Veröffentlichung, dass die Lage der beiden aufeinanderfolgenden Prüfblöcke beliebig innerhalb der Nachricht gewählt werden kann, ohne dass dabei die Prüfeigenschaften verschlechtert werden. Sollen die Blöcke an die Stelle formula_26 bzw. formula_27, ist ihr Wert als formula_28 und formula_29, jeweils modulo formula_9, zu wählen. Dabei entspricht formula_3 der Anzahl an Blöcken der ursprünglichen Nachricht. Tatsächlich können die beiden Blöcke an frei wählbaren Stellen formula_32 und formula_33 stehen, solange der Betrag formula_34 und formula_9 teilerfremd sind., Keith Sklower entwickelte eine Rekursion, die zwei Blöcke auf einmal verarbeitet und am Ende denselben Prüfwert wie Fletcher’s Checksum erzeugt. Des Weiteren kann es in bestimmten Fehlermodellen von Vorteil sein, den Prüfwert im Trailer statt wie in den meisten Netzwerkprotokollen im Header unterzubringen., Optimierung., Werden die Summen in jeweils mehr als formula_1 Bit gespeichert, muss die Modulo-Operation nicht nach jeder Addition erfolgen, sondern erst, wenn die Variable überzulaufen droht. Man nimmt den Worst Case an, also eine Nachricht, bei der jeder Block den größtmöglichen Wert aufweist, um eine obere Grenze \\"(upper bound)\\" formula_37 für die Anzahl an Additionen ohne Überlauf zu ermitteln. Besitzen beide Summen denselben Datentyp, erfolgt dieser zuerst auf formula_5. Bei einer Umsetzung von Fletcher-16 mit formula_39 und formula_18 sowie unter Verwendung von vorzeichenlosen 16-Bit-Integers beträgt formula_41., Zusätzlich kann die Modulo-Operation durch bitweise Operatoren ersetzt werden. Ist formula_42, genügt codice_1 statt codice_2 (notiert in der Programmiersprache C), für formula_43 könnte die Einerkomplement-Arithmetik verwendet werden, bei der sich durch das in dieser Arithmetik erforderliche Addieren des Übertrags \\"(end-around carry)\\" das passende Resultat ergibt. Allerdings verwendet heutige Hardware nahezu ausschließlich eine Zweierkomplement-Arithmetik, das Addieren des Übertrags kann in diesem Fall durch codice_3 imitiert werden, unter der Voraussetzung, dass der verwendete Datentyp mehr als formula_1 Bits aufnehmen kann. In der Literatur zu Prüfsummen allgemein und auch bei Fletcher wird dementsprechend formula_43 häufig als Einer- und formula_42 als Zweierkomplementversion bezeichnet., Fletcher’s Checksum kann sowohl parallelisiert als auch vektorisiert werden. Der Algorithmus kann zusätzlich durch generelle Optimierungsmethoden, insbesondere Loop unrolling, beschleunigt werden., Geschichte., John Fletcher entwickelte den Algorithmus Ende der 1970er Jahre im Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Im Januar 1982 veröffentlichte die IEEE Communications Society Fletchers Artikel über die Prüfsumme und ihre Eigenschaften in \\"IEEE Transactions on Communications\\". Darin begründet er seine Entwicklung einer arithmetischen Prüfsumme damit, dass Computer eher für arithmetische Operationen als für Polynomdivision, wie sie die zyklische Redundanzprüfung benötigt, ausgelegt seien. Fletcher beschrieb den Prüfwert nicht als Zusammensetzung von zwei, sondern von beliebig vielen Summen, wobei die erste wie formula_4 berechnet wird und jede weitere die Zwischenergebnisse der vorhergehenden aufsummiert. Die Verwendung von mehr als zwei Summen verbessert den Algorithmus jedoch nicht genügend, um die Verlangsamung zu rechtfertigen., Angepasste Varianten von Fletchers Algorithmus werden unter anderem in der vierten Schicht (Transport) des ISO-Netzwerkprotokollstandards und im IS-IS-Protokoll eingesetzt. J.Zweig und C.Partridge schlugen 1990 vor, das TCP dahingehend zu erweitern, dass Fletcher’s Checksum verwendet werden kann. Diese Erweiterung besitzt seit 2011 den Status „Historic“. Sowohl im 2006 eingeführten Dateisystem ZFS als auch im 2016 vorgestellten Apple File System wird die Prüfsumme genutzt., 1995 stellte Mark Adler mit Adler-32 eine Variation von Fletcher-32 vor, bei der modulo 65.521 (die größte Primzahl kleiner 216) gerechnet wird., Eigenschaften und Vergleich mit anderen Verfahren., Bei gleicher Byteanzahl des Prüfwerts ist Fletcher’s Checksum einer gut implementierten zyklischen Redundanzprüfung (CRC) in der Fehlererkennung unterlegen. Dafür kann die Berechnung schon beginnen, bevor die Nachricht vollendet wurde, da es keine direkten Abhängigkeiten zu formula_3 gibt. Werden einzelne Blöcke verändert, nachdem die Prüfsumme bereits ausgerechnet wurde, kann diese aktualisiert werden, ohne auf die unveränderten Blöcke zuzugreifen., Nachfolgende Eigenschaften beziehen sich stets auf den Algorithmus mit formula_43. Fletcher’s Checksum entdeckt alle Bündelfehler bis zur Länge formula_1, anfällig ist es gegen solche Burstfehler, die einen Block aus nur Einsen zu einem aus nur Nullen invertieren oder umgekehrt, denn modulo formula_12 sind diese beiden Blöcke äquivalent. Lässt man diese spezielle Art von Fehler aus der Betrachtung heraus, werden alle Bündelfehler bis zur Länge formula_8 erkannt. Für Nachrichten bis zu einer Länge von formula_53 Bit besitzt das Verfahren eine Hamming-Distanz von formula_54, für längere Nachrichten ist formula_55. Fletcher-16 erkennt also ab Nachrichtenlänge von 2.056 Bit nicht mehr alle Zwei-Bit-Fehler, während für eine geeignete CRC mit einem gleich langen Prüfwert ein Abstand zwischen den beiden Fehlern von bis zu 65.535 Bit noch zum Erkennen reicht. Hier offenbart sich eine Schwäche der Umsetzung von Fletcher-16 mit formula_56, da hier der Abstand kleinergleich 16 Bit sein muss., Fletcher’s Checksum erkennt keine fälschlich an eine Nachricht angehängten Nullen, da sich dadurch die Summen nicht mehr verändern. Dies kann verhindert werden, indem der Empfänger entweder die Länge der Nachricht im Voraus kennt oder sie ihm innerhalb dieser mitgeteilt wird., Obwohl bei Adler-32 die Besetzung von formula_9 durch eine Primzahl die möglichen Prüfwerte besser verteilt, gibt es doch insgesamt weniger von ihnen, sodass die aufwändigere Berechnung trotzdem fast immer schlechter prüft als Fletcher-32., Damit ist Fletcher’s Checksum bei gleicher Bitanzahl des Prüfwerts sowohl einfachen Algorithmen wie der vertikalen Redundanzprüfung, einer simplen Summe oder der XOR-Prüfsumme als auch der Adler-Prüfsumme überlegen. Ist eine CRC umsetzbar, sollte diese jedoch bevorzugt werden.]: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Algorithmus, Hash, Kodierungstheorie, Fletcher's Checksum, Fehlererkennungsverfahren, digitale Datenübertragung, Prüfsumme, zyklische Redundanzprüfung, Netzwerkprotokolle, Dateisysteme"},{"instruction":"","output":"There are several possible reasons for this: 1.

Juli 1941 und dem 19. August 1944 statt. Im Umland der Stadt Ploiești im Königreich Rumänien befanden sich vom Deutschen Reich kontrollierte Ölförderanlagen. Die mittels unterschiedlicher Taktiken durchgeführten Luftangriffe sollten die elf ansässigen Erdölraffinerien zerstören und damit die Produktion von kriegswichtigen Gütern wie Treibstoff verhindern oder zumindest beeinträchtigen. Diese hatten für das „Dritte Reich“ militärstrategische Bedeutung., Nach dem ersten US-Angriff am 6. Juni 1942 etablierte sich in Ploiești eine starke rumänisch-deutsche Flugabwehr; die Stadt erhielt den Beinamen Festung Ploiești. Die Operation Tidal Wave („Flutwelle“) am 1. August 1943 erwies sich als weitgehender Fehlschlag für die Alliierten. Erst die 1944 folgenden Flächenbombardements der United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) und der Royal Air Force (RAF) beschädigten die Ölanlagen zeitweise schwer und verringerten die Gesamtproduktionskapazität erheblich. Beide Kriegsparteien erlitten durch die Luftangriffe starke Verluste. Auch viele rumänische Zivilisten starben. Der letzte Luftangriff fand am 19. August 1944 statt., Am 23. August 1944 führte der Königliche Staatsstreich in Rumänien zur Beendigung der Militärdiktatur von Marschall Ion Antonescu und des Militärbündnisses mit dem Deutschen Reich. Tags darauf wurden die Ölanlagen von der Roten Armee eingenommen, worauf die deutsche Heeresmission in Rumänien das Land verließ., Zusammen mit den Angriffen auf Leuna und andere Hydrierwerke in Deutschland wurde 1944 die Treibstoffversorgung der Achsenmächte und insbesondere die Versorgung mit Flugbenzin entscheidend geschwächt. Als Reaktion darauf entstand 1944 der Mineralölsicherungsplan, das sogenannte \\"Geilenberg-Programm\\", womit der schwächste Punkt der deutschen Rüstungsindustrie stabilisiert werden sollte, was letztendlich misslang., Geschichte., Politische Situation., Ploiești war seit dem 19. Jahrhundert bekannt für seine Ölfelder. Unter amerikanischer Mitwirkung wurde im nahegelegenen Rîfov zwischen 1856 und 1857 die erste rumänische und weltweit dritte Ölraffinerie erbaut. Ploiești stellte für das Deutsche Reich im Zweiten Weltkrieg eine der wichtigsten Rohölquellen dar. Die Ölindustrie der Stadt entwickelte sich zu einer unter deutscher Vorherrschaft stehenden Kriegsindustrie, die hauptsächlich der Treibstoffversorgung der Wehrmacht diente., Deutsches Reich., Bereits für den Vierjahresplan von 1936 legten die Wehrmacht und das Reichsamt für Wirtschaftsausbau umfassende Denkschriften vor, in denen sie die Beschaffung von Öl als Kriegsziel beschrieben:, Der Leiter des Reichsamtes, Carl Krauch, gleichzeitig Wehrwirtschaftsführer und Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender der I.G. Farben, stellte fest, dass Rumänien und ganz Südosteuropa ein „wehrmachtmäßig zu sichernder Raum“ sei, dessen Öl ausschließlich für Deutschland „politisch und militärisch sichergestellt“ werden müsse. Er bezifferte bereits den Materialbedarf für eine Pipeline von etwa 2000 Kilometer Länge von Ploiești nach Regensburg., Adolf Hitler äußerte bei seinem Besuch im verbündeten Finnland im Juni 1942:, Der Schutz der rumänischen Ölressourcen spielte im Verlauf des Zweiten Weltkrieges eine strategisch bedeutende Rolle. Aus Sicht des Deutschen Reiches bedrohte das britische Engagement in Griechenland diese Ressourcen, da sie hierdurch in den Aktionsradius britischer Bomber gelangten. Besonders Kreta eröffnete als militärische Basis Großbritannien die Möglichkeit, den Zugang zur Ägäis zu kontrollieren und die Ölfelder in Rumänien zu bombardieren. Diese Überlegungen führten unter anderem im Verlauf des Balkanfeldzuges 1941 zur Einnahme Griechenlands und zur Luftlandeschlacht um Kreta. Die Insel verblieb bis 1945 unter deutscher Okkupation., Nach den Erinnerungen von Heinz Guderian wies Adolf Hitler am 23. August 1941 bei der Diskussion in der „Wolfsschanze“ zur Entscheidung für die Schlacht um Kiew erneut auf die Wichtigkeit der Krim hin, die „\\"als Flugzeugträger der Sowjetunion im Kampfe gegen die rumänischen Ölfelder\\"“ ausgeschaltet werden müsse. In diesem Zusammenhang äußerte Hitler: „\\"Meine Generäle verstehen nichts von Kriegswirtschaft.\\"“, Rumänien., Der ehemalige Verbündete Frankreich spielte nach dem Waffenstillstand von Compiègne (1940) vorerst keine politische und militärische Rolle mehr., Wie in den \\"Geheimen Zusatzprotokollen\\" des Deutsch-sowjetischen Nichtangriffspakts von 1939 verabredet, erfolgte die sowjetische Besetzung Bessarabiens, der (Nord-)Bukowina und des Herța-Gebietes. 1940 sah Rumänien im nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Reich trotz des Zweiten Wiener Schiedsspruchs (1940) die einzige, die dem Land beim Zusammenhalt des verbleibenden Gebietes und beim Wiedererhalt des verlorenen Gebietes helfen konnte. Der ein faschistisches Regime errichtende rumänische „Staatsführer“ Marschall Ion Antonescu umriss seine Politik mit den Worten:, Nach anfänglicher Neutralität trat Rumänien am 23. November 1940 dem Bündnis der Achsenmächte bei und stellte an der Seite des Deutschen Reiches im Juni 1941 das stärkste nicht-deutsche Truppenkontingent im mit dem Unternehmen Barbarossa begonnenen und zunächst erfolgreichen Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieg, in dessen Verlauf die an die Sowjetunion verlorenen Großrumänischen Gebiete wieder zurückerobert werden konnten. Ab Dezember 1941 befand sich Rumänien mit dem Vereinigten Königreich und ab Juni 1942 mit den Vereinigten Staaten im Kriegszustand. Militärische Erfolge wurden nun seltener; schließlich wurden Ende 1942 bedeutende Teile der rumänischen Armee in die Schlacht von Stalingrad verwickelt. Ab 1943 befanden sich die rumänischen Einheiten – wie auch die deutsche Wehrmacht – überwiegend im Rückzug, worauf Rumänien sein Engagement als Verbündeter verringerte. Bis zum November 1943 hatte das Land Verluste von etwa 250.000 Soldaten zu beklagen. Der für die Achsenmächte an der Ostfront ungünstig verlaufende Krieg führte zu Beginn des Jahres 1944 sowohl in der rumänischen Führung als auch in deren Opposition zu Überlegungen, den Bündnispartner zu wechseln., Die deutschen Verbündeten wurden von der rumänischen Bevölkerung oft als arrogant und grausam empfunden. Gegenüber der Sowjetunion bestand die Furcht vor der „Roten Gefahr“, die von der rumänischen Regierungspropaganda auch als „jüdisch-bolschewistische Plage“ bezeichnet wurde. Den ehemaligen Verbündeten aus dem Ersten Weltkrieg Frankreich und Großbritannien hingegen gehörten Sympathien, auch gingen die Zivilbevölkerung Ploieștis und das rumänische Militär mit amerikanischen Gefangenen trotz der Luftangriffe respektvoll um., Ploiești., In den Anfängen der Ölförderung im Prahova-Tal () hatte die Stadt eine starke Bevölkerungszuwanderung von Menschen aus ländlichen Gebieten. Auf industrielle Entwicklung ausgelegte Strategien transformierten die Region in eines der größten Ölförderungszentren. Die Produktion in Rumänien lag in der Zwischenkriegszeit auf dem zweiten Platz der Liste der Öl produzierenden Länder in Europa. Nur die Sowjetunion produzierte mehr. Rumänien lag mit einem Anteil von 2,2Prozent auf dem sechsten Platz der Weltrangliste. In der Gegend siedelten sich zahlreiche Raffinerien zur Weiterverarbeitung an, was im Kontrast zur Agrarwirtschaft in großen Teilen des Landes stand. Die gute Anbindung an das Straßen- und Eisenbahnnetz bescherte der Stadt eine verkehrsgünstige Lage. Die Donau ist zudem ein leistungsfähiger Wasserweg zum Schwarzen Meer., Die städtebauliche Struktur von Ploiești unterschied sich von derjenigen der meisten deutschen Städte. Die Innenstadt bestand aus zwei- beziehungsweise dreistöckigen Verwaltungsgebäuden, die übrige Stadt aus eingeschossigen und in der Regel von Gärten umgebenen kleinen Häusern. Im Gegensatz zu den oftmals wegen ihrer baulichen Struktur brandgefährdeten Innenstädten Deutschlands konnten Phosphorbomben ihr Potential mangels brennbarem Material in der hier gegebenen Architektur kaum entfalten, wohl hingegen in den Ölanlagen., Die Gesamtzahl der Einwohner der Stadt lag 1930 bei 77.341, 1941 bei etwa 90.000 und 1948 bei 96.229 Menschen, damit hatte Ploiești zeitweise das größte Bevölkerungswachstum im Land. 1940 arbeiteten fast 18.500 Menschen in der Ölindustrie, die auch oft in der deutschen Sprache unterwiesen wurden. Viele Menschen arbeiteten im Papier- und Druckbereich, im Handel, in der Landwirtschaft, im Transport und in Produktionsbetrieben. Metallverarbeitende Betriebe (zum Beispiel \\"Concordia\\") stellten auch Kriegsmaterial wie Geschütze und Munition sowie Hangars für die rumänischen Luftstreitkräfte her., Etwa fünfProzent der Bevölkerung gehörten Minderheiten an, darunter Magyaren, Rumäniendeutsche und Roma. 34Prozent der Juden der Stadt, deren Anteil an der Bevölkerung bei fünfProzent lag, waren im Handel tätig. Der übrige Teil übte freie Berufe aus oder arbeitete im Bankwesen, im medizinischen Bereich oder in der Industrie. Die Juden galten als ein wichtiges Bevölkerungssegment der Mittelschicht der Stadt. Die antisemitischen Repressalien erreichten mit dem Abtransport vieler Juden aus Ploiești wegen der „\\"Gefahr der Sabotage\\"“ ihren Höhepunkt., Das in die Industrie der Stadt investierte Kapital stammte zu 26 Prozent aus Rumänien und zu 20 Prozent von britischen, zu 16 Prozent von anglo-holländischen, zu zehn Prozent von amerikanischen, zu sechs Prozent von belgischen, zu drei Prozent zu italienischen und zu weniger als einem Prozent von deutschen und anderen Investoren., Der erfolgreiche Abschluss des Westfeldzugs gegen Frankreich versetzte das Deutsche Reich in die Lage, die Kapitalpositionen der Westmächte in der rumänischen Erdölindustrie zu beeinflussen. Am 23. Mai 1940 ließ das Reichswirtschaftsministerium die Zielgabe verlauten „\\"den in den Niederlanden und Belgien befindlichen Wertpapierbesitz sicherzustellen, um, besonders bei Holdinggesellschaften, über diesen Besitz hinweg gegebenenfalls auf die beherrschten Gesellschaften (beispielsweise in Rumänien ansässige Erdölgesellschaften) Einfluß zu gewinnen\\"“., Die Deutsche Bank führte Verhand: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Leitsymptom ist intensiver Juckreiz, der zu selbstzugefügten schweren Hautveränderungen und Sekundärinfektionen führen kann. Die Behandlung erfolgt durch eine Flohbekämpfung und -prophylaxe, gegen den Juckreiz können kurzzeitig Glukokortikoide eingesetzt werden., Vorkommen und Pathogenese., Flohallergien sind bei Hunden und Katzen ein recht häufiges Phänomen und werden, auch bei Hunden, vor allem durch den Katzenfloh \\"(Ctenocephalides felis)\\" ausgelöst. Betroffen sind Tiere aller Rassen und Altersklassen. Auch wenn die Erkrankung im Sommer häufiger auftritt, kommt sie ganzjährig vor. Eine erhöhte Krankheitsneigung haben Hunde, die an einer anderen Allergie, der Atopischen Dermatitis, leiden: Etwa 80 % der atopischen Hunde entwickeln bei Flohexposition eine Flohallergie. Eine Flohallergie tritt auch bei Mardern und gelegentlich bei Schafen und Ziegen auf, wobei hier ebenfalls der Katzenfloh häufigster Auslöser ist., Als Allergieauslöser (Allergene) kommen Proteine und Haptene aus dem Speichel der Flöhe mit einer molaren Masse von 6–58kDa in Betracht. Das erste identifizierte allergieauslösende Flohspeichelprotein war das aus 158 Aminosäuren bestehende \\"Cte f 1\\" (\\"Cte f\\" steht für \\"Ctenocephalides felis\\") mit einer Molaren Masse von 18kDa. Insgesamt kommen mindestens 15 verschiedene Flohallergene als Verursacher in Frage, die am häufigsten reagierenden haben eine molare Masse zwischen 25 und 58kDa., Die Flohallergie ist größtenteils eine durch Immunglobulin E (IgE) vermittelte Typ-I-Reaktion mit Degranulation von Mastzellen und einer Zunahme der eosinophilen Granulozyten (Eosinophilie). In einer experimentellen Studie an Labormäusen zeigte sich eine enge Beziehung zwischen der Menge an Immunglobulin E und dem Grad der klinischen Erkrankung, wobei CD4-positive T-Lymphozyten und Interleukin-4 maßgeblich an der Krankheitsentstehung beteiligt waren., In Einzelfällen kann auch eine Typ-IV-Reaktion auftreten. Darüber hinaus werden auch andere immunologische Mechanismen diskutiert, wie eine verzögerte zelluläre Immunantwort auf IgE und eine Überempfindlichkeit der Haut mit Einwanderung basophiler Granulozyten und Degranulation dieser Zellen nach IgE- oder IgG-Bindung., Klinisches Bild., Das Leitsymptom der Flohallergie beim Hund ist intensiver Juckreiz vor allem in der Lenden-, Leisten- und Schwanzgegend, auf den die Tiere mit Benagen und Belecken reagieren. Als erste Hautveränderung (Primäreffloreszenz) tritt eine kleine Papel auf. Gelegentlich kommt es zu einer Anschwellung der Kniekehllymphknoten. Durch das Benagen und Belecken entwickeln sich im Regelfall weitere Hautveränderungen wie Erosionen und Krusten, ein sogenannter \\"hot spot\\", eine umschriebene, oberflächliche eitrige Hautentzündung (Pyodermie). Auch eine Überwucherung der Haut mit \\"Malassezia pachydermatis\\", einer Hefe der natürlichen Hautflora, wird häufiger beobachtet, so dass es sekundär zu einer Malassezien-Dermatitis kommt. Bei chronischem Bestehen einer Flohallergie treten Haarausfall, Hyperpigmentierung und Hautverdickung auf., Bei Katzen ist das klinische Bild variabler. Betroffen sind hier vor allem die Schwanzwurzel und Lenden-, Bauch- und Leistenregion sowie der Hals. Das Haupterscheinungsbild ist neben Juckreiz eine Hautentzündung mit hirsekorngroßen Papeln und Krusten (miliare Dermatitis). Auch eine Überempfindlichkeit (Hyperästhesie) des Rückens kann auf eine Flohallergie hinweisen. Bei längerem Bestehen kann fleckiger oder beidseits symmetrischer Haarausfall auftreten. Durch intensives Belecken kann eine flächige, erhabene Hautrötung (eosinophile Plaque) entstehen. Auch ein nichtschmerzhaftes Lippengeschwür mit Einwanderung neutrophiler Granulozyten und bakterieller Sekundärinfektion kann Ausdruck einer Flohallergie sein. Eine Flohallergie kann bei Katzen auch mit Lymphknotenschwellungen einhergehen und ist klinisch nicht immer von einer nichtallergischen Dermatitis nach Flohexposition zu unterscheiden., Bei Schafen manifestiert sich eine Flohallergie vor allem an den Gliedmaßen, bei Mardern ähnelt das klinische Bild dem der Hunde., Diagnostik., Neben dem klinischen Bild und einer zu erfragenden mangelnden Flohprophylaxe kann man mittels eines Flohkamms Flöhe oder Flohkot im Fell nachweisen. Da Flöhe sich nicht permanent auf dem Wirt aufhalten, ist ein negativer Befund jedoch noch nicht diagnostisch aussagekräftig. Zudem sind insbesondere Katzen durch ihre intensive Fellpflege in der Lage, Flöhe schnell zu beseitigen. Da jedoch bereits ein einziger Flohbiss eine Allergie auslösen kann, kann diese alleiniger Hinweis auf eine Flohexposition sein. Ein weiteres Indiz ist der Nachweis der Eier des Gurkenkernbandwurms im Kot, da dieser Flöhe als Zwischenwirt benötigt., Ein Intrakutantest mit hochgereinigtem Flohspeicheleiweiß ist zur Diagnosesicherung am ehesten geeignet. Die Sensitivität und Spezifität liegt hier über 90 %. Ganzkörperextrakte aus Flöhen haben einen zu geringen Allergengehalt und mit einer Sensitivität von 67 % nur einen begrenzten Wert. Beim Intrakutantest werden 0,05ml einer Testlösung in die Haut injiziert. Nach 10 bis 20 Minuten entsteht bei positivem Befund eine Quaddel, bei einigen Tieren auch erst nach 24 oder 48 Stunden, so dass eine dreimalige Kontrolle der Reaktion angezeigt ist. Als Positivkontrolle wird an einer anderen Stelle Histamin appliziert. Eine vorangegangene Behandlung mit Glukokortikoiden kann zu falsch negativen Ergebnissen führen. In einem solchen Fall muss der Test nach zwei, bei Depotpräparaten nach sechs Wochen wiederholt werden. Nachteil dieses Tests ist, dass für ihn ein Hautgebiet geschoren werden muss und entsprechende Testlösungen mit begrenzter Haltbarkeit vorrätig gehalten werden müssen., Die diagnostische Sicherheit von serologischen Untersuchungen von Blutproben mittels ELISA ist nicht unumstritten. Die Sensitivität ist mit 87 % zwar recht hoch, die Spezifität mit 53 % jedoch unzureichend. Da sie für den Tierarzt aber praktikabler sind, werden diese Tests häufiger durchgeführt als der Intrakutantest., Als „Goldstandard“ gilt der Provokationstest, bei dem 10 frisch geschlüpfte, nüchterne und mikrobiologisch unbedenkliche Flöhe auf das Tier angesetzt werden, allerdings ist dieser Nachweis wenig praxistauglich., Therapie., Die beste Therapie ist eine konsequente Flohbekämpfung. Dies kann durch regelmäßigen Einsatz langwirksamer Insektizide (z.B. Afoxolaner, Fipronil, Fluralaner, Imidacloprid, Metaflumizon, Nitenpyran, Selamectin oder Spinosad) realisiert werden, die auch bei einem Befall therapeutisch eingesetzt werden. Für die Behandlung ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass die Abtötungsgeschwindigkeit (speed of kill) hoch ist und die Wirkung anhaltend ist. Nitenpyran hat eine Abtötungsgeschwindigkeit von 3 Stunden, die Wirkung lässt aber bereits nach 2 Tagen deutlich nach. Imidacloprid ist nach 8 Stunden wirksam und zeigt eine anhaltend hohe Abtötung über 14 Tage. Metaflumizon, Selamectin und Fipronil habe eine lange Wirkung, die Abtötungsgeschwindigkeit ist aber relativ gering. Permethrin-haltige Präparate wirken nach etwa 6 Stunden und zeigen eine Wirkung über einen Monat, dürfen jedoch bei Katzen nicht angewendet werden. Die neueren oralen Antiparasitika wie Spinosad, Afoxolaner und Fluralaner haben sehr hohe Abtötungsgeschwindigkeiten und eine gute anhaltende Wirkung., Bei nachgewiesenem Befall sollte auch eine Behandlung der Umgebung des Tieres, vor allem des Liegeplatzes und bevorzugter Aufenthaltsorte, erfolgen, da sich Flöhe nicht permanent auf dem Tier aufhalten und die Wirksamkeit der am Tier angewendeten Wirkstoffe auf diesen Teil der Flohpopulation begrenzt ist. Die Umgebungsbehandlung erfolgt durch regelmäßiges Staubsaugen und Waschen von Decken und Teppichen, unterstützt durch eine chemische Flohbekämpfung mit Chlorpyrifos, Permethrin (nicht bei Katzen), Propoxur, Fenoxycarb, Methopren bzw. Kombinationen dieser Wirkstoffe (z.B. \\"Bolfo-Plus\\", \\"Kadox\\", \\"VetKem\\")., Gegen die akuten Symptome können als Entzündungshemmer kurzzeitig wirkende Glukokortikoide wie Prednisolon zweimal im Abstand von 48 Stunden („2-Tage-Therapie“) eingesetzt werden. Bei Katzen empfehlen Rosje und Willemse eine fünftägige Prednisolongabe. Antihistaminika sind bei Hunden und Katzen zumeist wirkungslos, da der Juckreiz kaum über Histamin vermittelt wird., Die bisherigen Studien zu einer Hyposensibilisierung zeigten unzufriedenstellende Ergebnisse, unter Umständen deshalb, weil sie nur mit Floh-Ganzkörperextrakten durchgeführt wurden.]: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Floh, Hautkrankheit, Katze, Hund, Flohallergie, Flohbissallergie, Flohspeichelallergie, allergische Hauterkrankung, Juckreiz, Flohbekämpfung, Flohallergene, Immunreaktion, Diagnostik, Therapie, Provokationstest, Insektizide, Umgebungsbehandlung, Glukokortikoide, Hyposensibilisierung"},{"instruction":"Miért nem számol az adatforgalmat a wifinel","output":"A Wi-Fi hálózatok általában adatátvitelre szolgálnak, és az adatforgalmat a vezetékes internet kapcsolat terheli.

In der Luft schwebendes flüssiges Wasser (zum Beispiel Regentropfen, Nebeltröpfchen) oder Eis (zum Beispiel Schneekristalle) werden der Luftfeuchtigkeit folglich nicht zugerechnet. Die Luftfeuchtigkeit ist eine wichtige Kenngröße für zahlreiche technische und meteorologische Vorgänge, für viele Lebensvorgänge bei Lebewesen sowie für Gesundheit und Behaglichkeit der Menschen., In Abhängigkeit von Temperatur und Druck kann ein gegebenes Luftvolumen nur eine gewisse Höchstmenge Wasserdampf enthalten. Die \\"relative Luftfeuchtigkeit\\", die das geläufigste Maß für die Luftfeuchtigkeit ist, beträgt dann 100 %. Allgemein gibt die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit, ausgedrückt in Prozent (%), das Gewichtsverhältnis des momentanen Wasserdampfgehalts zu dem Wasserdampfgehalt an, der für die aktuelle Temperatur und den aktuellen Druck maximal möglich ist. Durch die Aufnahme von Wasserdampf wird die Luftdichte verringert, da bei gleich bleibendem Gesamtdruck eine hinzugefügte Anzahl von H2O-Molekülen dieselbe Anzahl von schwereren N2- und O2-Molekülen verdrängt., Luftfeuchtigkeit., Absolute Luftfeuchtigkeit: Ist die in einem bestimmten Luftvolumen \\"V\\" enthaltene Wasserdampfmasse \\"m\\"W. Übliche Einheit: g/m3., Maximale Luftfeuchtigkeit: Ist die bei einer bestimmten Temperatur maximal mögliche absolute Luftfeuchtigkeit (\\"f\\"max). Sie wird erreicht, wenn der Wasserdampfpartialdruck in der Luft so groß wie der Sättigungsdampfdruck des Wassers bei der entsprechenden Temperatur ist. Bei diesem Zustand ist die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit 100 %. Übliche Einheit: g/m3., Relative Luftfeuchtigkeit: Ist das Verhältnis der tatsächlich enthaltenen zur maximal möglichen Masse an Wasserdampf in der Luft; oder anders ausgedrückt das Verhältnis zwischen der absoluten Luftfeuchte und der maximalen Luftfeuchte. Als Quotient zweier Größen mit derselben Einheit ist dies eine Größe der Dimension Zahl; sie wird meistens in der Hilfsmaßeinheit Prozent angegeben:, Allgemeines., Ein wasserdampffreies Luftgemisch bezeichnet man als trockene Luft. Tabellen zur Zusammensetzung der Luft beziehen sich in der Regel auf trockene Luft, da der Wasserdampfanteil feuchter Luft mit 0 bis 4 Volumenprozent vergleichsweise sehr stark schwankt. Beeinflusst wird die Luftfeuchtigkeit vor allem durch die Verfügbarkeit von Wasser, die Temperatur und den Grad der Durchmischung der Atmosphäre. Höhere Lufttemperaturen ermöglichen eine höhere Wasserdampfkonzentration in der Luft. Bei sehr geringen Konzentrationen von Wasserdampf in der Luft bezeichnet man die Luftfeuchtigkeit auch als Spurenfeuchtigkeit bzw. Spurenfeuchte., Physikalische Grundlagen., Verdunstung und Kondensation., An einer freien Wasseroberfläche, die flüssiges Wasser vom darüberliegenden Luftvolumen trennt, treten stets einzelne Wassermoleküle vom Wasservolumen in das Luftvolumen über. Im flüssigen Wasser sind die Wassermoleküle durch molekulare Kräfte, vor allem durch die Wasserstoffbrückenbindungen, vergleichsweise stark aneinander gebunden, wodurch sich der zusammenhängende Flüssigkeitsverbund erst ausbilden kann. Infolge ihrer thermischen Bewegung tragen die Wassermoleküle jedoch jeweils gewisse Beträge an kinetischer Energie, die um einen temperaturabhängigen Mittelwert herum streuen (Maxwell-Boltzmann-Verteilung). Ein kleiner Anteil von Wassermolekülen hat daher stets genügend thermische Energie, um die Bindungskräfte der umgebenden Moleküle zu überwinden, die Wasseroberfläche zu verlassen und in das Luftvolumen überzugehen, also zu verdunsten. Die Verdunstungsrate, das ist die Menge an verdunstendem Wasser je Zeitspanne, hängt vom Anteil derjenigen Moleküle ab, deren kinetische Energie die Bindungsenergie des Flüssigkeitsverbundes überschreitet, und wird unter anderem von der herrschenden Temperatur bestimmt., Umgekehrt treffen verdunstete Wassermoleküle aus der Luft auch wieder auf die Wasseroberfläche und können dort je nach ihrer kinetischen Energie mit einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit vom Molekülverbund eingefangen werden, also kondensieren. Die Kondensationsrate ist nur vom Partialdruck des Wasserdampfes in der Luft abhängig, nicht aber von dem Anteil des Luftdrucks, den die anderen Bestandteile der Luft liefern., Vier Größen beeinflussen die Menge dieses Stoffaustauschs:, Sättigung., Betrachtet man einen Verdunstungsvorgang bei konstanter Temperatur und anfangs trockener Luft, so stellt sich die der Temperatur entsprechende Verdunstungsrate ein, während die Kondensationsrate mangels Wassermolekülen in der Luft zunächst gleich null ist. Die Verdunstungsrate ist also größer als die Kondensationsrate, und die Anzahl von Wassermolekülen in der Luft steigt daher an. Damit wächst auch die Kondensationsrate, und die Nettoverdunstung (Verdunstungsrate minus Kondensationsrate) beginnt zu sinken. Die Dichte der Wassermoleküle in der Luft und damit die Kondensationsrate steigen so lange an, bis Kondensationsrate und Verdunstungsrate gleich sind, pro Zeitspanne also ebenso viele Wassermoleküle vom Wasser in die Luft übertreten wie von der Luft ins Wasser. Dann ist der Gleichgewichtszustand erreicht, in dem die Nettoverdunstung null ist, obwohl ein ständiger Teilchenaustausch zwischen Luft und Wasser stattfindet., Die im Gleichgewichtszustand vorliegende Konzentration von Wassermolekülen in der Luft ist die \\"Sättigungsxadkonzentration\\". Steigt die Temperatur, wird sich auch eine höhere Sättigungskonzentration einstellen, da die nun ebenfalls erhöhte Verdunstungsrate zur Erreichung eines neuen Gleichgewichts durch eine höhere Kondensationsrate wieder kompensiert werden muss, was eine höhere Teilchendichte in der Luft voraussetzt. Die Höhe der Sättigungskonzentration hängt also von der Temperatur ab., Die Sättigungskonzentration wird fast allein durch die Eigenschaften der Wassermoleküle und ihre Wechselwirkung mit der Wasseroberfläche bestimmt, es besteht keine wesentliche Wechselwirkung mit den anderen Atmosphärengasen. Wären jene Gase nicht vorhanden, so würde sich über dem Wasser praktisch dieselbe Sättigungskonzentration einstellen. Die umgangssprachlich gebräuchliche und wegen der Einfachheit auch in Fachkreisen weit verbreitete Ausdrucksweise, \\"die Luft\\" könne bei gegebener Temperatur maximal eine bestimmte Menge an Wasserdampf \\"aufnehmen\\", ist irreführend. Die Luft nimmt die Feuchtigkeit nicht analog zu einem Schwamm auf, und auch der Begriff der Sättigung darf hier nicht analog zur Sättigung einer Lösung verstanden werden. Die Luft besteht aus selbstständig agierenden Gasteilchen, die im Wesentlichen nur über Stöße wechselwirken. Weder ist also Sauerstoff im Stickstoff, noch Wasserdampf in den anderen Luftbestandteilen gelöst., Die Sättigungskonzentration ist somit von der kinetischen Energie der Wasserteilchen abhängig., Aus demselben Grund wird die Sättigungskonzentration nicht von der Temperatur der Luft bestimmt, sondern von der Temperatur der verdunstenden Oberfläche. Der Bezug auf die Temperatur der Luft ist in der Alltagspraxis oft gerechtfertigt, da verdunstende Flächen geringer thermischer Trägheit meist näherungsweise Lufttemperatur annehmen (zum Beispiel an der Luft trocknende Wäsche). Ist jedoch die verdunstende Oberfläche deutlich wärmer als die Luft, so verdunsten die Wassermoleküle mit einer der Oberflächentemperatur entsprechenden Verdunstungsrate in die kühlere Luft hinein (heiße Herdplatte), auch wenn deren Sättigungskonzentration dabei überschritten wird. Ein Teil der Feuchtigkeit kondensiert dann in der Luft an den kühleren Aerosolen, welche Lufttemperatur angenommen haben, und wird als Dampf- oder Nebelschwaden sichtbar (zum Beispiel Dunstschwaden über einem herbstlichen See). Ist die Oberfläche wesentlich kühler als die Luft, so kann unter Umständen auch der Feuchtigkeitsgehalt teilgesättigter Luft dort zu Übersättigung und Kondensation an der Oberfläche führen (zum Beispiel beschlagene Fenster in Küche oder Bad oder die Wasserzunahme in einem Tauteich). Genauer gesagt kondensiert der Wasserdampf zu Wasser (zu Tau, wenn die Oberflächentemperatur unter dem Taupunkt, oder zu Reif, wenn sie unter dem Reifpunkt liegt, siehe dazu auch unten)., Übersättigung., Erhöht man durch eine Zufuhr von Wassermolekülen deren Konzentration über die Sättigungskonzentration (Übersättigung), so steigt wegen der größeren Dichte an Wassermolekülen in der Luft die Kondensationsrate vorübergehend über die Verdunstungsrate hinaus an und die Konzentration an Wassermolekülen sinkt daher wieder auf den Gleichgewichtswert., Auch hier ist zu beachten, dass es sich nicht etwa um ein \\"Unvermögen der Luft\\" handelt, den überschüssigen Wasserdampf \\"zu halten\\". Vielmehr nutzt der Wasserdampf unter diesen Bedingungen eine sich darbietende Kondensationsfläche, um seine Konzentration durch heterogene Kondensation auf die Sättigungskonzentration zu senken. Fehlen solche Kondensationsflächen oder Kondensationskerne, so kann die Luft dauerhaft erhebliche Mengen von Wasserdampf aufnehmen, bis es schließlich zu einer spontanen Entstehung von Wassertröpfchen (homogene Kondensation) kommt; siehe dazu auch den Abschnitt \\"Oberflächenkrümmung des Wassers.\\" Dies ist zum Beispiel in großen Volumina möglichst reiner Luft, also bei einer geringen Aerosolkonzentration, und bei großer Entfernung von etwaigen Umschließungsflächen der Fall (siehe Nebelkammer). Spontane Kondensation von Wasserdampf zu Wassertröpfchen findet ohne Kondensationskeime erst bei extremer Übersättigung von mehreren hundert Prozent relativer Feuchtigkeit statt. In der Praxis ist jedoch fast immer eine ausreichend große Menge von Aerosolen in der Luft vorhanden, sodass es in der Atmosphäre kaum zu Übersättigungen von mehreren Prozentpunkten kommt., Teilsättigung., Die Verdunstungsrate des Wassers kann bestimmte Maximalwerte nicht überschreiten. Es dauert daher längere Zeit, bis sich das Gleichgewicht nach einer Störung wieder eingestellt hat. Wurde zum Beispiel durch nächtliche Abkühlung ein Teil des Feuchtigkeitsgehalts auskondensiert, so ist die Luft nach einer Erwärmung zunächst ungesättigt und kann den Sättigungszustand nur langsam wieder erreichen. Diese Teilsättigung ist: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Flugmeteorologie, Klimatologie, Meteorologische Größe, Wasser (Hydrologie), Luftfeuchtigkeit, Temperatur, Druck, Verdunstung, Kondensation, Sättigung, Übersättigung"},{"instruction":"Potřebuji abys za ohodnotil číselně od 0 do 100 text za textem \\"Zde je text:\\".

Es umfasst das australische Festland und die Insel Tasmanien. Es sind rund 20.000 Arten von Samenpflanzen beschrieben worden. Die artenreichsten Gattungen sind dabei Eukalyptus und Akazien mit rund 600 und 1000 Arten. Diese beiden Gattungen prägen in weiten Teilen die Vegetation Australiens., In den ariden Gebieten im Zentrum und im Westen des Kontinentes herrschen (zumeist edaphisch bedingte) azonale Vollwüsten und zonale grasdominierte Halbwüsten vor, die von den Gattungen \\"Triodia\\" (Spinifex) und \\"Astrebla\\" (Mitchell-Gras) beherrscht werden. Alle Wüsten zusammen bedecken etwa die Hälfte des Landes. In den semiariden Übergangsräumen in einem Bogen vom Nordwesten zum Osten liegen Trocken-, Dornstrauch- oder Feuchtsavannen, die etwa ein Fünftel der Landfläche ausmachen. Zur Nordküste und zum Gebirgssaum im Osten gehen sie vor allem in tropische Trockenwälder über. Sie sind noch weitgehend in einem intakten Zustand, während die im semiariden Südosten und Südwesten anschließenden Hartlaubwälder- und Buschländer des Westseitenklimas durch intensive Landnutzung bereits zu rund 70 % anthropogen verändert wurden. Die verschiedenen Regen- und Feuchtwälder von den Tropen über die Subtropen bis zur kühlgemäßigten Zone am gesamten Ostrand der australischen Landmasse sowie auf einem Großteil Tasmaniens nehmen eine sehr geringe Fläche ein (maximal 5 %), sind aber sehr artenreich und beherbergen viele ursprüngliche Arten. Alle Waldgebiete zusammen bedeckten ursprünglich etwa ein Drittel des Kontinentes., Aufgrund der im Folgenden beschriebenen Besonderheiten bei der Artenvielfalt – insbesondere bezüglich endemischer Arten – und einer großen Biodiversität auf relativ kleinem Raum, wird Australien zu den Megadiversitätsländern dieser Erde gerechnet., Geographische Voraussetzungen., Australien ist ein alter Kontinent und rund 7,7Millionen km² groß. Zum Florenreich der Australis gehören nur das Festland und Tasmanien; Neuguinea ist zwar Teil des australischen Kontinents, nicht aber des australischen Florenreichs (je nach Autor wird Neuguinea der Paläotropis oder der Ozeanis zugeordnet). Die durchschnittliche Höhenlage beträgt nur 330m, und lediglich 13Prozent der Landesfläche liegen über 500m., Das Klima in Australien ist durch eine hohe Sonneneinstrahlung und geringe Niederschläge gekennzeichnet, die durch den subtropischen Hochdruckgürtel bedingt sind. Die hohe Sonneneinstrahlung bedingt eine hohe Verdunstung (Evaporation). Australien ist nach der Antarktis der trockenste Kontinent. Im Norden herrschen Sommerregen vor, die durch den Monsun von November bis März bedingt und sehr verlässlich sind. Für den Rest des Jahres herrscht im Norden Trockenheit. Ein schmaler Streifen im Nordosten erhält jedoch ganzjährig hohe Niederschläge. Viele Tropentiefs werden jedoch von den Gebirgen Neuguineas abgeblockt. Im Süden herrscht Winterregen vor. In der ariden Zone dazwischen – dem größten Teil der als Outback bekannten Wildnis, die noch fast drei Viertel des Landes einnimmt – kommen nur asaisonale Regen vor, die nicht jährlich eintreten. Zwei Drittel des Landes erhalten weniger als 250mm Regen pro Jahr. In der Südost-Ecke überlappen sich beide Zonen. Die tropischen Zyklone treten an der Ostküste zwischen dem 10. und 25.Breitengrad auf. Australien ist von der El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) betroffen, wobei in El-Niño-Jahren Trockenheit herrscht., Die Landformen Australiens sind von Plateaus, Hügelländern und Steinwüsten geprägt. Das Land wird in drei physiogeographische Regionen unterteilt:, Die Böden sind sehr alt und dadurch arm an Nährstoffen, besonders an Phosphor und Stickstoff, aber auch an Schwefel und Kalium, sowie den Mikronährstoffen Molybdän, Kupfer, Zink, Bor und Mangan. Die Hauptunterschiede zu den Böden der Nordhemisphäre sind ein sehr geringer Gehalt an organischem Material, die ärmere Oberflächenstruktur und das Überwiegen der Mykorrhiza. In der ariden Zone überwiegen tief verwitterte rote Silikatsande, erdige Sande und Lehme (Rudosole, Tenosole), in West- und Zentralaustralien auch Laterite. Im Süden gibt es auch flach verwitterte Kalkböden und Lehmböden (Vertosole), im Westen auch flachgründige, steinige Böden. Auch Salz- und Gips-Böden sind sehr weit verbreitet., Artenvielfalt., Endemismus., 80 bis 90Prozent der Samenpflanzen-Arten in Australien sind endemisch. Dieser hohe Endemismusgrad ist auf die lange Isolation des Kontinents zurückzuführen. Australien wird daher als eigenes Florenreich Australis geführt. Innerhalb Australiens existieren zwei Endemismus-Zentren: die nördlichen Regenwälder und der südwestliche Teil mit mediterranem Klima und Hartlaubvegetation., Der Endemismusgrad bei den Familien ist wesentlich geringer. Crisp et al. nennen folgende endemische Familien: Akaniaceae s.str., Anarthriaceae, Atherospermataceae, Austrobaileyaceae, Blandfordiaceae, Boryaceae, Cephalotaceae, Dasypogonaceae, Doryanthaceae, Ecdeiocoleaceae, Emblingiaceae, Gyrostemonaceae, Tetracarpaeaceae, Xanthorrhoeaceae. Diese Familien sind jedoch alle artenarm oder monotypisch. Etliche weitere Familien reichen in ihrem Areal nur wenig über Australien hinaus, sind also subendemisch: Casuarinaceae, Centrolepidaceae, Eupomatiaceae, Goodeniaceae, Hydatellaceae, Stylidiaceae und die frühere Familie der Epacridaceae, die heute als Unterfamilie, den Styphelioideae, innerhalb der Ericaceae geführt wird. Weitere für Australien charakteristische Familien sind die Chenopodiaceae, Proteaceae, Cunoniaceae, Myrtaceae und die Pittosporaceae., Von den rund 2500 Gattungen Australiens sind rund 566 endemisch. Die beiden größten Gattungen, Akazien s. l. und Eukalyptus, kommen auch außerhalb Australiens vor. So gut wie alle Arten dieser Gattungen sind an ihren jeweiligen Wuchsorten jedoch endemisch., Blütenpflanzen., Es sind rund 17.600 Arten von Bedecktsamern bekannt, die Gesamtzahl wird auf 19.000 bis 21.000 geschätzt. Im Vergleich dazu beträgt die Gesamtzahl der Farn- und Blütenpflanzen Deutschlands rund 2800, die Österreichs rund 2950. Die Nacktsamer dürften mit 113 Arten vollständig bekannt sein. Sie sind zu 96Prozent endemisch., Von den zehn artenreichsten Familien Australiens gehören lediglich drei nicht gleichzeitig zu den artenreichsten der Welt: Dies sind die Proteaceae, Epacridaceae und die Goodeniaceae., In der artenreichsten Familie Fabaceae sticht die Gattung der Akazien (\\"Acacia\\" s. l.) mit rund 1000Arten heraus. Die Gattung \\"Acacia\\" s. l. ist zwar auch in Afrika weit verbreitet, findet sich in Australien jedoch mit weitaus mehr unterschiedlichen Arten. Die Arten besitzen im Gegensatz zu ihren afrikanischen Verwandten keine Dornen, und ihre Blätter sind durch Phyllodien, umgewandelte Blattstiele, ersetzt. Die Akazien, die hier „wattles“ genannt werden, dominieren weite Teile des Landesinneren. Weitere artenreiche Gattungen sind \\"Daviesia\\" und \\"Pultenaea\\"., Bei den Myrtaceae ist \\"Eucalyptus\\" die artenreichste Gattung. Auch nach der Trennung in zwei Gattungen besitzt die Gattung \\"Eucalyptus\\" noch rund 600 Arten, die größte ausgegliederte Gattung \\"Corymbia\\" rund 110. Weitere artenreiche Gattungen sind \\"Melaleuca\\" (250), \\"Verticordia\\" (100) und \\"Leptospermum\\" (80)., Die Süßgräser sind besonders in den Savannen und im trockenen Landesinneren reichlich vertreten, auch wenn es keine sehr artenreichen Gattungen gibt. Die für die Vegetation bedeutendsten Gattungen sind \\"Triodia\\", \\"Plechtrachne\\" und \\"Spinifex\\". Mit 310 Arten stellen die Gräser die größte Gruppe der eingeschleppten Neophyten., Die Proteaceae sind mit 46 Gattungen vertreten, wovon 37 endemisch sind. Die wichtigsten Gattungen sind \\"Grevillea\\" (352), \\"Hakea\\" (150), \\"Banksia\\" (80), \\"Persoonia\\" (98), sowie \\"Dryandra\\" mit rund 95 Arten ausschließlich in Südwestaustralien. Zu den Proteaceae gehört die Macadamia, die einzige kommerzielle Nahrungspflanze aus Australien. Die Arten wachsen meist als Sträucher im Unterwuchs von Eukalyptus- und Akazien-Wäldern sowie in Heiden., Von den Orchideen wächst rund ein Viertel als Epiphyt in den tropischen Regenwäldern, die anderen terrestrisch in den übrigen Landesteilen. Die artenreichsten Gattungen sind \\"Caladenia\\" und \\"Pterostylis\\" mit jeweils rund 100 Arten., Weitere Gattungen mit über 100 Arten sind \\"Eremophila\\" (214, endemisch, Scrophulariaceae), \\"Cyperus\\" (150, Cyperaceae), \\"Stylidium\\" (150, Stylidiaceae), \\"Goodenia\\" (140, Goodeniaceae), \\"Boronia\\" (131, Rutaceae), und \\"Olearia\\" (130, Asteraceae). Die Zahlenangaben der \\"Flora of Australia\\" sind teilweise bereits überholt, so gibt es in der Gattung \\"Stylidium\\" in Australien bereits über 220 beschriebenen Arten., Kryptogamen., Die Gefäßsporenpflanzen (Farne und Bärlappe) sind mit rund 450Arten in 150Gattungen aufgrund des großteils trockenen Kontinents nicht besonders zahlreich. Der Endemismusgrad ist mit 40Prozent ebenfalls nicht besonders hoch., Die Anzahl der bekannten Moosarten beträgt rund 1850, wobei die Gesamtartenzahl auf rund 2200 geschätzt wird. Nur rund 25Prozent davon sind endemisch., Die Pilze Australiens sind bis jetzt kaum erforscht. Schätzungen gehen davon aus, dass erst fünf bis zehn Prozent der Arten beschrieben wurden, darunter der in Europa eingeschleppte Tintenfischpilz. Die Artenzahl wird auf rund 250.000 geschätzt. Die Flechten sind mit 3154 bekannten Taxa vertreten, von denen rund 35Prozent endemisch sind., Die Anzahl der Algenarten wird auf 22.000 geschätzt, wobei erst rund die Hälfte beschrieben ist., Forschungsgeschichte., Die botanische Geschichte Australiens begann 1770, als Joseph Banks und Daniel Solander im Zuge der ersten Reise von James Cook vor allem in der Botany Bay australische Pflanzen sammelten. Ihre Ergebnisse haben sie allerdings nicht publiziert. Banks schickte in den folgenden Jahrzehnten mehrere Botaniker auf Forschungsreisen nach Australien, der bedeutendste unter ihnen war Robert Brown, der 1801 bis 1803 mehrere tausend Exemplare sammelte. Von seiner geplanten Flora (\\"Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen\\") erschien allerdings nur der erste Band. Sie umfasste bereits 2040 Taxa. 1814 veröffentlichte Brown eine Liste mit 4200 Taxa, und nach einer Expedition ins Landesinnere 1849 eine Liste mit rund 7000 Taxa. Grundlegend für das Verständnis der Flora waren auch die Arbeiten von Joseph Dalton Hooker, der: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Flora Australien, endemische Pflanzenarten, Eukalyptus, Akazien, Wüsten, Trockensavannen, Regen- und Feuchtwälder, Megadiversität, Böden, Klima"},{"instruction":"Let's write a blog post that will rank on Google.

Sie fand zwischen April und August 1944 im Verlauf der alliierten Landung in Nordfrankreich (→ Operation Overlord) statt., Die alliierte Landung in der Normandie wurde auch durch die Luftüberlegenheit der alliierten Streitkräfte ermöglicht. Vor dem 6. Juni 1944, dem sogenannten D-Day, bereiteten die alliierten Luftstreitkräfte die Invasion vor. Sie bombardierten deutsche Versorgungslinien, Artilleriebatterien und unterstützten die französische Résistance aus der Luft mit Munition und Ausrüstung., Während des D-Days sicherten alliierte Jäger den Luftraum über dem Landungsbereich, und Bomberstaffeln griffen deutsche Stellungen im Hinterland an. Zum Schutz der Armada und der Nachschubschiffe suchten zugleich alliierte Flugzeuge die See nach deutschen U-Booten ab. Da die Deutschen an eine Landung an der Straße von Calais geglaubt hatten und teilweise im Juni 1944 immer noch glaubten (→ Deutsche Situation in der Normandie im Jahr 1944), konnten sie den Alliierten am D-Day nur wenige Jagdflugzeuge entgegensetzen. Ein Großteil der Verbände war kurz zuvor weiter ins Landesinnere verlegt worden., Nach dem D-Day unterstützten die Alliierten ihre Offensiven auf dem Boden mit konzentrierten Bombardements. Alliierte Jagdbomber suchten die Normandie nach deutschen Truppenverbänden ab und beschossen sie, um einen Einsatz gegen die Landstreitkräfte zu verhindern. Die deutsche Luftwaffe konnte den alliierten Luftstreitkräften und dem Vormarsch am Boden kaum Kräfte entgegensetzen. Die deutsche Wehrmacht erhoffte sich durch „Wunderwaffen“, wie beispielsweise „Blitzbombern“ und Düsenjägern (die jedoch nicht zum Einsatz kamen), vor allem aber durch den Einsatz von kampferprobten Panzerdivisionen, die Invasion abzuwehren. Außerdem griff die deutsche Wehrmacht britische Städte mit den „Vergeltungswaffen“ V1 und V2 an., Die alliierten Luftstreitkräfte konnten alle an sie gestellten Aufgaben erfüllen, wenn auch, wie im Falle der Schlacht um Caen, mit Verzögerung aufgrund schlechten Wetters. Das Ausmaß der eingesetzten Kräfte war bislang unerreicht, der Verlust von fast 17.000 alliierten Besatzungen innerhalb von weniger als drei Monaten war das höchste personelle und materielle Opfer in der Geschichte des Luftkrieges. Die deutsche Luftwaffe war nicht in der Lage, der alliierten Übermacht entscheidend zu begegnen. Der Versuch, den alliierten Vormarsch durch einen massiven Gegenschlag während ungünstigen Flugwetters im Winter 1944 zu stoppen, scheiterte ebenfalls (Ardennenoffensive, Operation Bodenplatte)., Hintergrund, Planung und Situation der Kriegsgegner., Alliierte Vorbereitung der Operation Overlord und Aufgabenstellung für die Luftstreitkräfte., Am 11. Januar 1944 begannen die alliierten Luftangriffe im direkten Zusammenhang mit der Vorbereitung auf Operation Overlord. Die Einsätze hatten bis zum Beginn der Invasion folgende Ziele, die parallel zueinander verfolgt wurden:, Bereits vier Monate vor der Durchführung der Operation Overlord wurde von den Alliierten eine Serie von Luftangriffen gegen Ziele an der Kanalküste, der holländischen Küste und Ziele im Reichsgebiet durchgeführt, mitunter um die Verteidigungsbereitschaft der deutschen Luftwaffe zu testen. Bei diesen Operationen, die bei den alliierten Besatzungen als Big Week bekannt wurden, stellte sich heraus, dass die alliierten Luftstreitkräfte an jedem Ort und zu jeder Zeit die Luftherrschaft erringen konnten., Darüber hinaus wurden im April 1944 Erdöllager im Fördergebiet um die rumänische Stadt Ploesti und Hydrierwerke im deutschen Reichsgebiet angegriffen, was zu einem Mangel an Flugbenzin führte und die Bewegungsfreiheit der Luftwaffe weiter einschränkte., Beteiligte alliierte Luftstreitkräfte., Oberbefehlshaber der Alliierten Expeditions-Luftflotten (Allied Expeditionary Air Force, AEAF) und damit der größten und vielseitigsten Luftarmada aller Zeiten war Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory. Unter seinem Befehl befanden sich Luftlandeflotten, Taktische Luftflotten, Strategische Luftflotten, das Küstenkommando der Royal Air Force sowie die „Air Defence of Great Britain“., Taktische Luftflotten., Entwicklungsgeschichte., Während des Westfeldzugs 1940 waren die Methoden der alliierten Luftstreitkräfte, insbesondere der Royal Air Force, gegen die schnell vorrückenden Verbände des deutschen Landheeres noch unbefriedigend. Die für die Luftnahunterstützung vorgesehenen Verbände, die mit veralteten Flugzeugen des Musters Fairey Battle ausgerüstet waren, konnten kaum taktische Erfolge erzielen und waren fast vollständig aufgerieben worden., Während des Afrikafeldzuges, der für Großbritannien eine Fortsetzung des Landkrieges gegen das Deutsche Reich darstellte, wurde dieses Defizit sowohl bei der RAF als auch bei den amerikanischen Luftstreitkräften aufgeholt. Die erste taktische Luftflotte der Royal Air Force war die Desert Air Force (DAF). Diese aus verschiedenen Jäger- und Bomberkommandos zusammengestellte Einheit entwickelte wichtige, für spätere taktische Luftflotten wegweisende Methoden wie zum Beispiel den Einsatz von Forward Air Controllern (zu deutsch sinngemäß: Vorgeschobene Angriffseinweiser)., Auf amerikanischer Seite wurde die 9th Air Force am 12. November 1942 aus der US-Army Middle East Air Force (USAMEAF) in Nordafrika gebildet. Vorhandene Flugzeugmuster wurden für den Einsatz gegen Bodentruppen in einer taktischen Situation umgerüstet, Angriffsmuster wurden erprobt, die Voraussetzungen für die Entstehung von spezialisierten taktischen Luftflotten wurden geschaffen., Die 2nd Tactical Air Force der Briten und die 9th Air Force der Amerikaner., Als das Afrikakorps 1943 geschlagen war, wurden die taktischen Einheiten nach England verlegt und in zwei große Luftflotten zusammengefasst, die britische Second Tactical Air Force (2nd TAF) und die amerikanische 9th Air Force., Beide Luftflotten wurden auf die Umstände einer geplanten Invasion hin ausgerichtet und begleiteten die alliierten Bodentruppen von der Landung in der Normandie an bis zum Kriegsende. Die Ausrüstung wurde im weiteren Verlauf durch neue Flugzeugmuster und spezielle Munition komplettiert, wie zum Beispiel die Hawker Typhoon, ausgerüstet mit ungelenkten Luft-Bodenraketen zur Panzerbekämpfung., Die 2nd Tactical Air Force und die 9th Air Force verfügten am 6. Juni 1944 zusammen über ca. 2.600 Flugzeuge, darunter Jagdflugzeuge, Jagdbomber, leichte und mittlere Bomber, Aufklärer und Artilleriebeobachter., Royal Air Force Coastal Command (Küstenkommando)., \\"16th\\" und \\"19th Group\\" mit insgesamt 63 Staffeln, die am 6. Juni zusammen 678 einsatzbereite Flugzeuge umfassten, davon 549 aus Einheiten der Royal Air Force. Hauptaufgabe war die Durchführung der Operation Cork. Daneben wurden die alliierten Seestreitkräfte bei der Abwehr von Schnellbooten und anderen leichten Überwasserschiffen unterstützt und Nachschublinien an der Küste angegriffen., Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB)., Zur Verteidigung der britischen Inseln waren die \\"10th\\", die \\"11th\\", die 12th und die \\"13th Group\\" mit insgesamt 45 Staffeln vorgesehen. Diese Einheiten wurden teilweise auch kurzfristig der 2nd Tactical Air Force unterstellt und nahmen an vielfältigen Operationen teil, die weit über die Verteidigung des britischen Luftraumes hinausgingen., Verteidigungsplan der deutschen Luftwaffe., Die Rolle der Luftwaffe., Nach dem Kriegswinter 1943/44 kam es zu einer Vertrauenskrise zwischen dem Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe Hermann Göring und Hitler. Göring, seit dem misslungenen Putsch 1923 engster Vertrauter Hitlers, hatte während des Krieges mehrfach leere Versprechungen gemacht. So wollte er 1940 das Britische Expeditionskorps in Dünkirchen durch die Luftwaffe vernichten, es gelang aber eine erfolgreiche Evakuierung von fast 340.000 alliierten Soldaten. Im August 1940 wollte er die Royal Air Force innerhalb von vier Tagen niederwerfen, scheiterte aber in der Luftschlacht um England auch damit. Die von ihm zugesagte Versorgung der eingeschlossenen 6. Armee in Stalingrad über den Winter 1942–43 aus der Luft versagte. Göring hatte sogar behauptet, das Reichsgebiet vor alliierten Luftangriffen vollständig schützen zu können., Die Hoffnung auf starke Landstreitkräfte und die kapitalen Fehleinschätzungen Görings führten dazu, dass Hitler die Verteidigung der möglichen Invasionsstrände nicht der Luftwaffe übertrug. Er wählte dafür mit Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel den Befehlshaber mit großen Erfahrungen im Bodenkampf gegen alliierte Truppen., Den Einsatz der Luftwaffe, insbesondere den Einsatz von „Blitzbombern“ zur Bekämpfung gelandeter alliierter Truppen, gedachte Hitler selbst zu lenken. Die tatsächliche Aktivität der Luftwaffe beschränkte sich im Rahmen des Unternehmens Steinbock auf einzelne Nachtangriffe, wie am 29. April 1944 gegen Portsmouth mit 100 Bombern. Zusammen mit dem V-Waffeneinsatz bildete dies die sogenannte Fernkampfoffensive., Abgeworfene Bombenlasten über England:, Die defensiven Vorkehrungen beschränkten sich auf die Verlegung von einigen Luftabwehrbatterien aus dem Reichsgebiet an die Atlantikküste. Mit der Verlegung von fliegenden Verbänden wollte man im Oberkommando der Wehrmacht „\\"bis zum letzten Augenblick [warten].\\"“, Die vom Oberkommando der Wehrmacht erwogenen Szenarien konzentrierten sich auf Feldschlachten gegen Luftlandetruppen und Heeresverbände der alliierten Invasionsarmee. Aspekte des Luftkrieges in diesem Zusammenhang wurden vernachlässigt. Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, der die Verteidigungsanlagen der zukünftigen Westfront inspizierte, stellte fest, dass eine Invasionsarmee von den Verteidigern noch vor der Brückenkopfbildung zurückgeschlagen werden müsse. Rommel selbst konzentrierte sich dabei auf die Bereitstellung von gepanzerten Verbänden und den Ausbau von Verteidigungsanlagen. Wie der Luftüberlegenheit des Gegners zu begegnen sei, blieb offen., Ab April wurden die militärischen Voraussetzungen für eine Invasion auf alliierter Seite vom Oberkommando der Wehrmacht als gegeben betrachtet. Jede Verzögerung des Angriffs wurde als Vorteil für die Verteidiger gewertet, da diese die Zeit für die Aufstellung weiterer Heeresverbände und zum Ausbau von Verteidigungsanlagen nutzen könnten. Dass der Grund der Verzögerung möglicherweise mit der Flugwetterlage zu tun hatte, wurde zwar erkannt, es wurden aber keine Anstalten zur Sicherstellung der Luftüberlegenheit über den möglichen Kampfgebieten getroffen., Verfügbare Einheiten: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Konflikt 1944 Luftkriegsoperation Zweiter Weltkrieg Operation Overlord Luftschlacht um England Trägerschlachten Pazifik strategischer Luftkrieg Deutsches Reich alliierte Landung"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Flora von Europa (TDWG)], Die Flora und Vegetation der maltesischen Inseln zeichnet sich durch ihren typisch mediterranen Charakter aus. Sie steht insbesondere der Flora und Vegetation des nur rund 100 Kilometer entfernten Siziliens nahe, ist aber zusätzlich von der nordafrikanischen Pflanzenwelt beeinflusst., Mit rund 1100 höheren Pflanzenarten weisen die maltesischen Inseln angesichts ihrer geringen Größe, der geringen Habitatdiversität und des enormen menschlichen Einflusses für eine Mittelmeerflora einen bemerkenswerten Artenreichtum auf. Ein großer Anteil der Arten gilt dabei als nicht einheimisch., Kein Bereich des Archipels ist von menschlichen Einflüssen freigeblieben, seine Umgestaltung begann bereits zu neolithischer Zeit mit der Holznutzung. Heute sind die Inseln annähernd waldlos, charakteristisch sind vor allem Vegetationsformen wie Steppe, Macchie oder die besonders häufige Garrigue., Die Erforschung der maltesischen Flora begann im 17. Jahrhundert, aber erst im 20. Jahrhundert zeichnete sich eine kontinuierliche floristische Arbeit ab. Der außerordentlich hohe, durch den zunehmenden Tourismus noch gesteigerte menschliche Einfluss wirft zunehmend Fragen nach möglichen Lösungen für die sich ergebenden Konflikte zwischen Mensch und Natur auf., Naturraum., Geografische Lage., Die maltesischen Inseln liegen in der Mitte der Ost-West-Achse des Mittelmeers, rund 100 Kilometer südlich von Sizilien, 350 Kilometer nördlich von Tripolis und knapp 300 Kilometer östlich von Tunis. Sie erstrecken sich über eine Länge von 45 Kilometer von Nordwesten nach Südosten., Der Archipel umfasst drei bewohnte Inseln, nämlich Malta (etwa 246km²), Gozo (etwa 67km²) und Comino (etwa 3km²), sowie die unbewohnten Inselchen Cominotto, Filfla mit Filfoletta, Saint Paul’s Islands und Fungus Rock mit insgesamt weniger als 1km² Fläche. Die höchsten Punkte der drei Hauptinseln sind Klippen mit Höhen von 253 (Malta), 135 (Gozo) und 75 (Comino) Meter Höhe. Das Profil des Terrains ist relativ gleichmäßig, Berge oder tiefe Täler fehlen. Es gibt zwar einige kleine Quellen, größere natürliche Gewässer wie Seen oder Flüsse fehlen aber. Aufgrund der geringen Ausdehnung der Inseln ist kein Punkt im Landesinneren mehr als 6,5 Kilometer von der Küste entfernt, weshalb eine gewisse Salztoleranz eine notwendige Eigenschaft aller Pflanzenarten der Inseln darstellt., Geologie., Die Inseln bilden das so genannte Malta-Plateau, das auf der Afrikanischen Kontinentalplatte liegt und ebenso wie das benachbarte Sizilien geologisch zu Afrika gehört. Vom Ende des Tertiärs an bis vor rund 12.000 Jahren bestand zwischen Südsizilien und Nordafrika immer wieder eine Landbrücke, die das frühe Mittelmeer in zwei Becken teilte und noch heute als unterseeischer Meeresrücken erhalten ist. Im Zuge der Eiszeiten sank und stieg der Wasserspiegel des Mittelmeers und überflutete diese Landbrücke wiederholt. Zu Zeiten niedriger Wasserstände bot diese so einen Weg zur Zuwanderung auch nordafrikanischer Pflanzenarten nach Malta., Auf den ältesten Gesteinsschichten folgten Ablagerungen aus dem Miozän von Globigerinenkalk und blauem Ton sowie Korallenkalk. Geologisch sind die Inseln also recht jung. Stellenweise treten auch pleistozäne Ablagerungen (alte Bodenbildungen, Flusskiese, Konglomerate, Brekzien und Dünen der Küsten sowie Füllungen von Hohlräumen und Spalten) in Erscheinung., Aufgrund der kalkhaltigen Böden sind annähernd alle Pflanzen der maltesischen Flora kalkliebend oder zumindest kalktolerant., Geomorphologie und Böden., Infolge des geologischen Ausgangsmaterials sind die meisten maltesischen Böden mit einem pH-Wert von in der Regel über 8,0 leicht alkalisch. Drei wesentliche Bodentypen lassen sich unterscheiden: neben relativ jungen, carbonatischen Rohböden zumeist im Südwesten Maltas und dem Zentrum von Gozo mit einem Calciumcarbonatanteil von bis zu 90 % und einem sehr niedrigen Humusanteil von 1 bis 1,5 % finden sich im Zentrum Maltas sowie im mittleren und westlichen Gozo ältere Xerorendzina-Böden (durch semi-aride Trockenheit geprägte Rendzina) mit einem Calciumcarbonat-Gehalt zwischen 55 und 80 sowie einem mittleren Humusgehalt von 2 bis 3 %. Die ältesten Böden jedoch sind die fossilen Terra rossa und Terra fusca sowie ihre Zwischenformen mit Humusgehalten um 4,5 % und Calciumcarbonat-Gehalten von nur mehr 2 bis 15 %, die die Küsten von Gozo und den Norden, Süden und Südwesten von Malta dominieren., Charakteristische topografische Elemente der Inseln sind \\"rdum\\" und \\"wied\\". Erstere sind annähernd vertikale, kontinuierlich erodierende Felswände, an deren Fuß sich der Schutt der Erosion sammelt. Durch ihre Unzugänglichkeit und die von Felswänden und Schutt gebildeten Rückzugsräume stellen die \\"rdum\\" wichtige Rückzugsgebiete auch endemischer Arten der Flora und Fauna dar. Die Widien (Mehrzahl von \\"wied\\", auch inhaltlich eng verwandt mit dem arabischen Begriff \\"Wadi\\") sind tief eingeschnittene Wasserläufe, die von Vegetation meist überwachsen sind und im Herbst und Winter gleichmäßig Wasser führen. Sie wurden unter feuchteren klimatischen Bedingungen wie beispielsweise während des Pleistozäns durch Wasserläufe in die Oberfläche der Inseln geschnitten oder sind durch tektonische Ereignisse entstanden. Einige wenige Widien beherbergen eigene Quellen und weisen so ganzjährig Wasser auf. Daher zählen diese Widien zu den artenreichsten Standorten der Inseln., Ein weiteres wichtiges Merkmal der Insel, das sie von vielen anderen, fast immer äußerst trockenen Inseln des zentralen Mittelmeers unterscheidet, sind die zahlreichen Süßwasserquellen, die sich aus regenwassersammelnden Grundwasserleitern (Aquiferen) im durch eine Lehmschicht versiegelten Kalkstein speisen. Ohne sie wäre eine dichte menschliche Besiedlung der Inseln bis zum heutigen Ausmaß nicht möglich gewesen., Klima., Die maltesischen Inseln weisen ein typisches Mittelmeerklima auf: die Sommer sind heiß und trocken, die Winter kühl und feucht. Größere Niederschlagsmengen gibt es nur in der Zeit zwischen Oktober und März, von Mai bis Anfang September hingegen sind die Niederschlagsmengen so gering, dass in dieser Zeit das Pflanzenwachstum praktisch zum Erliegen kommt. Die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit ist mit 65 bis 80 % recht hoch. Der mittlere jährliche Niederschlag beträgt rund 550 Millimeter, ist aber über die Jahre hinweg sehr variabel. Anders die Temperaturen, die – typisch für eine Insel – über das Jahr hinweg recht beständig sind. Die Anzahl der Sonnenstunden ist auch im Winter hoch. Auf den Inseln ist es recht windig, Windstille ist selten. Ebenfalls rar ist länger anhaltender Regen. Nur sehr vereinzelt dokumentiert sind Frost und Schnee, die nicht nur äußerst seltene Phänomene sind, sondern wenn, dann nur sehr kurz auftreten., Die klimatischen Bedingungen mit der langen Trockenphase im Sommer erzwingen, dass ausdauernde, nicht sukkulente Pflanzen über den Sommer eine Ruhezeit einlegen müssen, so ziehen Geophyten z. B. in ihre Überdauerungsorgane ein., Florengeschichte., Über die Flora des maltesischen Archipels im Pleistozän ist nur wenig bekannt, nicht näher datierte Funde existieren von Echtem Lorbeer und Aleppo-Kiefern. Aus der Flora des frühen Holozäns nachgewiesen sind Gewöhnlicher Judasbaum, Weißdorn-Arten, Eschen-Arten sowie Vertreter der Gattungen \\"Phillyrea\\" und möglicherweise der Ölbäume. Zwischeneiszeitliche Pollenfunde zeichnen eine Flora nach, die jener der montanen Regionen Siziliens ähnelte, dominiert von Süßgräsern, Haseln, Kiefern, Erlen, Hopfenbuchen, Farnen und Sauergrasgewächsen. Zugleich lässt sich unter anderem durch Pollen von Tausendblatt, Hahnenfuß, Zweizähne und Torfmoose die Vegetation größerer Feuchtgebiete nachweisen., Artenvielfalt., Die Flora der maltesischen Inseln besteht (nach den erschienenen Bänden 1 bis 4 der \\"Med-Checklist\\" sowie den veröffentlichten Einträgen in der \\"Euro+Med Plantbase\\" und der \\"Flora of the Maltese Islands\\") aus etwa 1100 Gefäßpflanzenarten. Angesichts der geringen Oberfläche, der mangelnden Vielfalt an Habitaten und des enormen Bevölkerungsdrucks ist das ein bemerkenswerter Reichtum an Pflanzenarten für eine mediterrane Insel (siehe Vergleichstabelle). Von diesen 1100 sind etwa 950 (nach anderen Erhebungen 800) einheimisch oder alteingebürgert (Archäophyten), während etwa 75 Arten fest etablierte Neophyten sind und etwa ebenso viele mehr oder weniger unbeständig auftreten. Mit 10 bis 20 % der Arten weist die maltesische Flora einen relativ großen Anteil nicht einheimischer Flora auf. Rund 350 Arten gelten als ausgestorben, gefährdet oder selten., Nach gegenwärtigem Kenntnisstand sind rund 13 Arten und 4 Unterarten (deren taxonomischer Status allerdings nicht in allen Fällen gesichert ist) Endemiten des maltesischen Archipels. Das Epitheton \\"melitensis\\" vom lateinischen Wort für Malta verweist häufig auf solche Endemiten. Einige dieser Arten sind sogenannte Paläoendemiten, also Relikte einer voreiszeitlichen Mittelmeerflora, die während der Messinischen Salinitätskrise zuwanderten., Damit sind nur etwas über 1 % der maltesischen Blütenpflanzen-Arten endemisch. Im Vergleich mit den anderen größeren mediterranen Inseln wie Sardinien, Korsika, Sizilien, Kreta oder den Balearen, deren Endemismusgrad vier bis zehn Mal so hoch ist, ist das ein ausgesprochen niedriger Wert. Als ursächlich dafür gilt, dass Malta eine viel kleinere Fläche, nur sehr niedrige Reliefunterschiede und damit eine niedrigere Standortvielfalt hat. Weitere Erklärungsansätze sind, dass der Archipel mit 12.000 Jahren erst seit verhältnismäßig kurzer Zeit vom Festland isoliert ist und durch menschlichen Einfluss stark verändert wurde., Ungeachtet seines Namens kein Endemit ist die bekannteste maltesische Pflanze, der Malteserschwamm (\\"Cynomorium coccineum\\"), der in Malta nur auf dem nach ihm benannten \\"Fungus Rock\\" (englisch für „Pilz-Felsen“) vor Gozo vorkommt, darüber hinaus aber auch im restlichen Mittelmeerraum, in Makaronesien sowie in den Salzwüsten Zentralasiens zu finden ist., Als zumeist unzureichend erforscht gilt bisher die Kryptogamenflora. Unter den über 120 bekannten Moosen der Inseln befindet sich auch das nur aus Malta bekannte Lebermoos \\"Riccia melitensis\\". Darüber hinaus sind auch rund 150 Algen, ebenso viele Großpilze und rund 300 Flechten nachgewiesen.

Die Beförderung mittels Luftpost erfolgt zum Teil nur gegen eine Entrichtung erhöhter Postgebühren, die früher mitunter durch Freimachung mit besonderen Luftpostwertzeichen eingezogen wurden. Die wissenschaftliche Auseinandersetzung mit der Luftpostgeschichte sowie das systematische Sammeln von Luftpostwertzeichen und Belegstücken heißt Aerophilatelie., Historische Entwicklung., Die Anfänge der Luftpost., Bereits im Altertum wurden Botschaften mittels \\"Flugpost\\" überbracht, indem Brieftauben als Überbringer von Nachrichten eingesetzt wurden. Erstmals wurden Tauben im Alten Ägypten zur Nachrichtenüberbringung eingesetzt. Dieser besonders schnellen Art der Überbringung von Botschaften wurde militärische, politische und auch wirtschaftliche Beachtung beigemessen. Im Jahre 1279 v. Chr. wurde die Kunde von der Krönung des ägyptischen Pharaos Ramses II. durch vier freigelassene Tauben verbreitet. Brieftauben wurden auch von anderen Hochkulturen verwendet. Der römische Feldherr Julius Caesar bediente sich der besonderen Fähigkeiten der Brieftaube. Er ließ Nachrichten von Unruhen im eroberten Gallien durch eigene \\"Botentauben\\" überbringen, um so schnell wie möglich seine Truppen befehligen zu können., Auch im Mittelalter wurde die Brieftaube als Nachrichtenüberbringer eingesetzt. Der Kalif von Bagdad, \\"Nur-Eddin\\", richtete seine eigene \\"Brieftaubenpost\\" ein. Sie wurde allerdings nach der Zerstörung Bagdads im Jahre 1258 durch die Mongolen wieder eingestellt. Auch ägyptische Sultane richteten im Mittelalter eine eigene \\"staatliche Taubenpost\\" ein. Kreuzritter führten Brieftauben im 12. und 13. Jahrhundert aus dem Vorderen Orient erneut nach Europa ein., Die ersten Flugmaschinen., Zur Zeit der Renaissance tauchten in Europa die ersten ernstzunehmenden Entwürfe von Flugmaschinen auf. Die bekanntesten stammen vom italienischen Universalgenie Leonardo da Vinci. Die ersten flugtauglichen Konstruktionen entstanden jedoch erst über 250Jahre später. Die Brüder Montgolfier entdeckten durch einen Zufall, dass heiße Luft stark genug ist, um eine Papiertüte in die Luft zu heben. Diese Entdeckung war die Grundlage der Entwicklung des ersten Heißluftballons, der Montgolfière. Am 21. November 1783 fand die erste Fahrt eines Menschen mit einem Heißluftballon statt., Die Erfindung des Heißluftballons hatte große Auswirkungen auf die Geschichte der Luftpost. Bereits ein Jahr nach der ersten bemannten Ballonfahrt nahmen die Piloten kleinere Nachrichten oder Mitteilungen auf ihre Fahrten mit. Jedoch kam es erst im Jahre 1793 zum eigentlichen Beginn der Ballonpostgeschichte. Aus den beiden belagerten Festungen Valenciennes und Condé in Frankreich wurden mit kleinen Ballons Mitteilungen für die Verbündeten der Eingeschlossenen aufgelassen. Diese Nachrichten wurden allerdings von den Feinden abgefangen. In den folgenden Jahrzehnten kam es zur weiteren Anwendungen von Ballons zur Nachrichtenübermittlung im Krieg., Das berühmteste Beispiel unter Philatelisten aller Welt ist die Pariser Ballonpost. Die Verbindung zwischen Paris und dem unbesetzten Frankreich während des Deutsch-Französischen Krieges in den Jahren 1870 und 1871 konnte nur durch ein geschicktes Zusammenspiel zwischen Ballonpost und Brieftauben aufrechterhalten werden. Man gab den Ballonen aus Paris neben 2.500.000 Briefen und Postkarten insgesamt 363 Brieftauben mit, damit diese später mit Antworten oder anderen Nachrichten zurückkehren konnten. In Metz kam es ebenfalls während des Deutsch-Französischen Krieges zu ähnlichen Versuchen, mit Ballonen Verbündeten Nachrichten zukommen zu lassen (vergleiche Metzer Ballonpost)., Der erste amtliche Ballonpostflug fand am 17. Juli 1859 in den USA statt. Dieser führte von St. Louis in das 1290km entfernte Henderson in New York. Der Pilot John Wise hatte 123 Briefe an Bord. Nur einer dieser posthistorischen Belege ist erhalten geblieben. In Deutschland fand der erste amtliche Ballonpostflug im Rahmen der Leipziger Gewerbeausstellung im Juni 1897 statt. Der Pilot \\"Louis Godard\\" übergab die beförderten Postkarten nach der Landung der Reichspost zur Weiterbeförderung. Die Karten erhielten private Bestätigungsstempel., Bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts fanden solche Luftpostbeförderungen immer im Rahmen von besonderen Veranstaltungen oder aus militärischen Gründen statt. Der deutsche Generalpostmeister Heinrich von Stephan wies jedoch in einem vielbeachteten Vortrag auf die mögliche Bedeutung der Luftpost für die alltägliche Postbeförderung im Jahre 1874 hin. Dieser Vortrag erschien sogar als Buch unter dem Titel \\"„Weltpost und Luftschifffahrt“\\"., Die Erfindung des Flugzeugs., Nichts hatte größere Auswirkungen auf die Geschichte der Luftpost als die Erfindung des Flugzeugs. Nach den ersten Flugversuchen Otto Lilienthals mit seinem Derwitzer Gleiter im Frühjahr 1891 fand am 17. Dezember 1903 der erste motorisierte Flug der Welt (Brüder Wright) statt. Fünf Jahre später kam es zu der ersten Beförderung von Postsendungen durch Flugzeuge: Am 12. August 1909 wurden im Rahmen einer Flugausstellung Sonderstempel für einen Rundflug über Mailand ausgegeben. Einen Monat später, am 20. September 1909, wurden anlässlich eines Rundflugs über die italienische Stadt Brescia mitgeflogene Belege mit einem ähnlichen Sonderstempel versehen. Bei diesen beiden Veranstaltungen wurden die Postsendungen jedoch nicht weiterbefördert., Der erste offizielle Postbeförderungsflug zwischen zwei Orten fand am 18. Februar 1911 während einer Kunst- und Gewerbeausstellung in Indien statt. Der junge französische Pilot Henri Pequet transportierte etwa 6500 Briefe vom Ausstellungsort Allahabad in das etwa acht Kilometer entfernte Naini. Henri Pequet benötigte für diese Strecke mit seinem Doppeldecker \\"Sommer\\" ungefähr 13Minuten. Die mitgeflogenen Belege wurden mit dem Bestätigungsstempel \\"First Aerial Post, U.P. Exhibition Allahabad 1911\\" versehen., In England wurde der erste regelmäßige Luftpostdienst am 9. September 1911 zwischen Hendon und Windsor aufgenommen., Ein Jahr später, am 19. Mai 1912, fand der erste offizielle Postflug der Deutschen Reichspost zwischen Mannheim und Heidelberg statt (allerdings wurde die meiste Post nicht, wie vorgesehen, mit dem Luftschiff, sondern auf dem herkömmlichen Wege befördert). Mit Genehmigung des Reichs-Postamtes vom 1.Juni 1912 wurde dann vom 10. bis 23. Juni 1912 im Rahmen einer Wohltätigkeitsveranstaltung eine Luftpostbeförderung mit Zeppelin und Flugzeug und halbamtlichen Flugpostmarken, der sogenannten Flugpost am Rhein und am Main genehmigt. Zuvor gab es in Deutschland bereits mehrere private Postbeförderungen mit Flugzeugen ohne Genehmigung der Post. Die erste Veranstaltung dieser Art wurde am 13. November 1911 in Berlin durchgeführt., Bei der Veranstaltung \\"Flug um Berlin\\" wurden Postkarten für Sammler auf den Flug mitgenommen. Die zweite Veranstaltung dieser Art war ein Flug über acht Kilometer zwischen den Orten Bork und Brück. Bei dieser Flugveranstaltung wurden erstmals Flugmarken ausgegeben. Sie dienten ausschließlich zur Finanzierung der Veranstaltung und hatten keinen postalischen Wert. Der Initiator der Aktion waren der Berliner Zahnarzt und Vorsitzende des Verkehrsvereins Borkheide Kurt Schaefer und sein Freund Hans Grade, der als Unternehmer die ersten Flugzeuge zu dieser Zeit produzierte. So startete am 18. Februar 1912 ein Grade-Flugzeug und bewerkstelligte damit die erste Flugpostbeförderung mit Flugmarken in Deutschland von Bork nach Brück. In Aleksandar Lifkas \\"Kinematographischem Bericht der Ereignisse der letzten Woche\\" wurde über diese Luftpostbeförderung unter dem Titel \\"Die erste deutsche Luftpost zwischen Bork und Brück\\" berichtet; der Film wurde auch in österreichischen Kinos aufgeführt., Der Schweizer Flugpionier Oskar Bider transportierte am 9.März 1913 die erste schweizerische Luftpost auf der Strecke Basel–Liestal., In den folgenden Jahren gab es bis zum Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges eine intensive Zusammenarbeit der Reichspost mit den Veranstaltern der Postflüge (siehe zum Beispiel \\"Flugpost am Rhein und am Main\\"). In anderen Ländern wurde jedoch selbst während des Krieges am Aufbau eines zivilen Luftpostnetzwerkes gearbeitet. In Italien wurden 1917 die ersten Flugpostmarken der Welt ausgegeben. Diese wurden zur Bezahlung der Postgebühren für die Beförderung per Luftpost auf den Strecken Turin–Rom und Rom–Palermo verwendet. Dabei handelte es sich noch um einen Probebetrieb. In Österreich wurde am 31. März 1918 die erste regelmäßige Flugpostlinie zwischen Wien, Krakau, Lemberg und Kiew eingerichtet. Dafür wurden ebenfalls eigene Flugpostmarken ausgegeben. Diese regelmäßige Postbeförderung durch Flugzeuge wird von vielen Philatelisten als eigentlicher Beginn der Flugpostgeschichte angesehen. Aber auch während des Ersten Weltkrieges wurde versucht eine \\"Militärflugpost\\" aufzubauen, die das Ziel verfolgte eingeschlossene Soldaten mit Informationen aus der Heimat zu versorgen. So kann man als erste Militärflugpost den Flug von österreichisch-ungarischen Fliegern zu den Soldaten in das durch die Russen umschlossene Przemyśl im Oktober 1914 bezeichnen., Die ersten regelmäßigen staatlichen Flugpostverbindungen unter deutscher Regie wurden gegen Ende des Ersten Weltkrieges an der Ostfront in Russland und im Baltikum eingerichtet. Die Geschichte der zivilen Luftpost in Deutschland begann am 6.Februar 1919. Der Anlass war die Eröffnung der Konstituierung der Nationalversammlung in Weimar. Von diesem Tag an starteten zweimal täglich Flugzeuge der Deutschen Luft-Reederei in Berlin-Johannisthal, um Postsendungen – vor allem Zeitungen – von der Hauptstadt zum Tagungsort in Weimar zu transportieren. Diese Flugpostverbindung konnte vorerst ausschließlich von den Abgeordneten der Nationalversammlung in Anspruch genommen werden, die wegen der revolutionären Lage in Berlin in die damalige thüringische Hauptstadt ausgewichen war. Wenige Monate später wurde diese Flugpostlinie auch für die Öffentlichkeit freigegeben., Im März 1919 richteten dann die Junkers-Flugzeugwerke in Dessau den regelmäßigen Flugdienst nach Weimar ein. Im gleichen Jahr wurde auch in Bayern regelmäßige Postflüge eingerichtet., In den folgenden Jahren fand ein rascher Ausbau des Flugpostverbindungen in Deutschland wie auch in ganz Westeuropa und den USA statt. Am 11. August 1920 wurden die ersten Flugpostflüge von Deutschland ins Ausland durchgeführt. Das angeflogene Ziel war die schwedische Hafenstadt Malmö., Ab dem Jahr 1921 führte die Deutsche Reichspost besondere Flugpostbestätigungsstempel und Flugpostklebezettel ein. Im Jahre 1922 bestanden bereits 13 verschiedene Luftpostlinien. Im Mai 1923 wurden in Berlin die ersten Luftpostbriefkästen Deutschlands aufgestellt.

Das Anliegen wurde entweder Gottheiten der Unterwelt anvertraut, welche den Fluch vollziehen sollten, oder galt bereits allein durch die rituelle Behandlung der Tafel als umgesetzt. Dazu wurden die beschrifteten Lamellen oft zusätzlich eingerollt, gefaltet oder mit Nägeln durchbohrt. Verletzungen des Mediums sollten im Sinne eines Analogiezaubers auf die verwünschte Person übertragen werden., Die meisten Exemplare wurden an besonderen Orten wie Gräbern, Tempeln oder Teichen vergraben. So verborgen sollten die Botschaften allein die angerufenen Gottheiten erreichen. Fluchtafeln wurden häufig bei Rechtsstreitigkeiten, aber auch gegen Konkurrenten bei Wagenrennen, im Theater oder im Wirtschaftsleben verwendet. Ebenso waren erotische Rivalität, Eifersucht oder ein erotisch motivierter Rachewunsch Anlass der Verwünschungen; einige Inschriften sollten hingegen den gewünschten Partner anziehen., Entwicklung und Verbreitung., Bisher wurden etwa 1600 archäologische Funde publiziert, die über große Teile der antiken Mittelmeerwelt verteilt sind. Umstritten ist in der Forschung die Frage nach dem Ursprung dieser Tradition: Einige Forscher führen deren Entwicklung auf Kontakte von sich gegenseitig beeinflussenden Kulturen zurück, wodurch etwa religiöse Vorstellungen aus dem assyro-babylonischen Kulturraum auf das hellenistische Griechenland entwicklungsgeschichtlich einwirkten. Für Mesopotamien existieren jedoch keine direkten archäologischen Zeugnisse der Anwendung von Fluchtafeln, weshalb lediglich indirekte Quellen den weitverbreiteten Glauben an Schadenzauber belegen können: Zum einen sind assyrische Zauberbücher aus dem 1. Jahrtausend v. Chr. erhalten, die unter anderem Gegenmittel gegen Verwünschungen und Verzauberungen anführen und die Angst vor diesen Praktiken widerspiegeln. Zum anderen dokumentieren Gesetzeswerke und Gerichtsprotokolle, dass Schadenzauber als Kapitalverbrechen galt und als beispielsweise mit vorsätzlicher Tötung vergleichbar angesehen wurde. Andere Forscher nehmen hingegen aufgrund der geographisch konzentrierten Quellenlage an, dass es sich bei Defixionen um Praktiken handelt, die allein im griechischen Raum entstanden und in der griechisch-römischen Welt Verbreitung fanden., Von den im Mittelmeergebiet gefundenen Fluchtafeln entfallen ungefähr zwei Drittel auf griechische, nur etwa 600 Exemplare auf lateinische Texte. In Kombination mit anderen Quellen ergibt sich aus den Funden für den griechisch-römischen Raum ein vielfältiges Bild dieser Praxis. Die frühesten Fluchtafeln stammen aus der griechischen Kolonie Selinunt auf Sizilien und werden in den Zeitraum vom Ende des 6. Jahrhunderts bis zum frühen 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. datiert. Insbesondere aus dem 5. und 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. sind vor allem aus Attika zahlreiche Täfelchen bekannt. Wenig später entstanden viele Exemplare in Olbia am Schwarzen Meer. Dabei ist umstritten, ob sich die Fluchtafeln nur vom sizilischen und attischen Raum ausgehend verbreiteten oder ob sie in anderen Regionen aus dortigen älteren Formen verbaler magischer Praktiken entstanden. Möglich ist auch, dass außerhalb Siziliens und Attikas ältere Fluchtafeln bisher lediglich nicht archäologisch nachgewiesen sind., Etwa ab dem 2. Jahrhundert n. Chr. und besonders in der Spätantike wurden Fluchtafeln im Römischen Reich sehr beliebt. Ältere griechischsprachige Funde aus Italien stammen aus griechischen Kolonien in Unteritalien und Sizilien. Die nach heutigem Kenntnisstand älteste lateinischsprachige \\"defixio\\" entstand im 2. Jahrhundert v. Chr. und wurde in einem samnitisch-römischen Grab in der Nähe von Pompeji gefunden. Lateinischsprachige Fluchtafeln aus vorchristlicher Zeit waren zunächst im Wesentlichen auf Italien und Hispanien beschränkt. Ab der frühen Kaiserzeit verbreitete sich die Praxis der \\"defixio\\" zunehmend über die Provinzen des Imperium. Ab dem 2. und 3. Jahrhundert bildeten sich deutliche Zentren: Mit 250 Exemplaren stammt ein großer Teil der bisher gefundenen römischen Fluchtafeln aus der Provinz Britannien. Diese Funde konzentrieren sich mit über 100 Täfelchen auf die Tempelanlage des Mercurius im heutigen Uley sowie auf das Quellheiligtum der Sulis Minerva in Bath. Eine ungewöhnlich hohe Anzahl von ihnen richtet sich in Form von „Gebeten um Gerechtigkeit“ gegen Diebe. Auch in Nordafrika war diese Praxis des Schadenzaubers weit verbreitet. In Karthago und dem antiken Hadrumetum wurden vor allem Fluchtäfelchen konkurrierender Parteien bei Zirkusspielen oder Kämpfen in Amphitheatern gefunden. Aus Ägypten sind nur wenige Fluchtafeln erhalten; die bekannten Flüche wenden sich häufig zugleich an Götter und Dämonen unterschiedlicher Kulte., Ab dem 4. Jahrhundert nehmen die archäologischen Zeugnisse zeitlich parallel zum Aufstieg des Christentums deutlich ab. Vereinzelt sind auch noch später christliche oder jüdische Flüche zu finden. Sie lassen sich nur schwer von spätantiken paganen Verwünschungen unterscheiden, da diese häufig auch jüdische oder christliche Elemente und Namen in den Zauber einbezogen., Soziale und kulturelle Aspekte., In der Forschung ist umstritten, in welchen Kreisen man Schadenzauber anwandte. Einige Wissenschaftler nehmen an, dass diese Form von Magie nicht auf untere Schichten beschränkt war, da auf Funden aus Griechenland häufig auch Namen bekannter Persönlichkeiten verzeichnet sind. Andere meinen, dass Fluchtafeln ausschließlich in den niederen Sozialschichten gebräuchlich waren. Auf lateinischen \\"defixiones\\" scheinen häufig Namen auf, die lediglich aus einem Cognomen bestehen; manche kennzeichnen auch durch direkte Angabe des Sozialstatus den Verfluchten als Person, die nicht im Besitz des römischen Bürgerrechts oder Sklave ist. Für zahlreiche \\"defixiones\\" bilden auch Konkurrenzkämpfe zwischen Gladiatoren oder Wagenlenkern den Hintergrund, welche ebenso eine geringe soziale Stellung einnahmen. Dennoch tauchen in den Fluchtexten durchaus auch Namen bekannter Familien höchster Kreise bis hin zu Prokuratoren und Legaten auf. Abgesehen von erotischen Flüchen überwiegen zudem Männer als Verwünschungsziele., Im klassischen Athen standen magische Praktiken nicht unter Strafe; allenfalls konnte ein Prozess wegen Asebie oder – bei einem auf magische Mittel zurückgeführten Todesfall – der Verabreichung eines Gift- oder Zaubertrankes (\\"pharmakeía\\") angestrengt werden. Im Römischen Reich hingegen waren Fluchtafeln wie magische Handlungen allgemein trotz ihrer Popularität verboten. Bereits das Zwölftafelgesetz untersagte in der Mitte des 5. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. generell „böse Gesänge“ (\\"mala carmina\\") als magische Praktiken. Schadenzauber wird zusammen mit Ernteraub genannt und dadurch mit diesem Delikt, auf das die Todesstrafe stand, auf eine Stufe gestellt. Sulla richtete unter den neu installierten Gerichtshöfen ein Gericht für Kapitalverbrechen und Magie ein. Zudem legten die 81 v. Chr. erlassenen „Dolchmänner- und Giftmischereigesetze“ (\\"lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiis\\") fest, dass Brandstiftung, Meuchelmord und Giftmischerei (\\"veneficium\\") als heimtückische Verbrechen geahndet wurden, wozu nach antiker Rechtsauffassung auch der Schadenzauber zählte. Ergänzend richteten sich unterschiedliche Senatsbeschlüsse gegen Zauberei und „bösartige Kulthandlungen“ (\\"mala sacrificia\\")., Vor allem in der Kaiserzeit wurde – mit unterschiedlicher Härte – jede Form von Magie strafrechtlich geahndet. Ein solches Vorgehen diente oft politischen oder ideologischen Zwecken wie etwa der Ablenkung von politischen Spannungen. In manchen Teilen des Reiches war Zauberei dennoch ungestraft weit verbreitet. In Ägypten etwa standen Zauberer in der Tradition der ägyptischen Priester und versahen mancherorts auch Tempeldienst. Unter Augustus wurden Prophezeiungen und Papyri magischen Inhalts im Jahr 13 v. Chr. verbrannt. Bereits zwei Jahre zuvor war ein Edikt gegen Wahrsager erlassen worden, das als Rechtsgrundlage späterer Verfolgungen magischer Praktiken dienen sollte. Kaiser Tiberius ließ 130 Magier und Magierinnen hinrichten, wie auch Claudius und Nero die Anwendung von Magie verfolgten. In einigen Regionen des Reiches dagegen wurden Fluchtafeln, die auf Rächung eines Verbrechens abzielten, in großer Zahl an öffentlichen Orten wie etwa in Heiligtümern aufgestellt (siehe den Abschnitt „Gebete um Gerechtigkeit“) und teilweise sogar mit dem Namen des Verfluchenden versehen, scheinen also nicht als illegal wahrgenommen worden zu sein. Verfluchungen von Prozessgegnern, die häufig auf deren Tod abzielten und diese persönlich schädigen sollten, scheinen dagegen grundsätzlich illegal gewesen zu sein; sie wurden ohne Nennung des Urhebers abgefasst und häufig in Gräbern deponiert., Allein im 4. Jahrhundert sind jedoch zwölf kaiserliche Edikte belegt, die – zunehmend vom Christentum geprägt – mit äußerster Schärfe gegen Magie vorgehen. Schadenzauber und Wahrsagung zusammenfassend, sehen der spätantike \\"Codex Theodosianus\\" (438) und der \\"Codex Iustinianus\\" (529–534) für derartige Delikte die Höchststrafe wie Kreuzigung, Verbrennung oder Hinrichtung durch wilde Tiere vor, eine Strafe, die laut Iulius Paulus schon im 3. Jahrhundert auf die Verwünschung durch Defixion stand., Übereinstimmend mit der zunehmend repressiven Gesetzgebung sind vor allem in der Kaiserzeit zahlreiche Verfahren wegen des Gebrauchs von Magie bekannt; der erste belegte Prozess berief sich zu Beginn des 2. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. noch auf das Zwölftafelgesetz als Rechtsgrundlage.

In ihnen findet jedoch kein Gasaustausch statt. Es handelt sich um hauchdünne Säcke mit einer durchsichtigen Wand. Neben ihrer Funktion als „Motor der Atmung“ sind sie auch an der Stimmbildung beteiligt. Hochfrequente Exspirationen (Ausatmungen) werden im Stimmkopf (\\"Syrinx\\") zum Vogelgesang moduliert. Die dritte wichtige Funktion der Luftsäcke ist die Beteiligung an der Thermoregulation durch die Wärmeabgabe über Verdunstung., Anatomie., Gewebe., Die Luftsäcke sind größtenteils von einem einschichtigen Plattenepithel ausgekleidet. Teilweise treten auch kubische und hochprismatische Flimmerepithelzellen auf. In ihre Wand sind elastische Fasern und glatte Muskulatur eingelagert. Darin verlaufen auch einzelne Nervenfasern, bei denen bei einigen Vögeln der Ursprung aus dem Nervus vagus beschrieben ist, über deren Funktion bislang aber keine Kenntnisse vorliegen., Einteilung der Luftsäcke., Die Luftsäcke werden während der Entwicklung bereits sehr früh im Embryo angelegt. Sie entstehen beim Huhn am 5. und 6. Embryonaltag, gleichzeitig mit der Entwicklung der Lungen, aber vor der Bildung der Sekundärbronchien. Am 10. Tag sind die Luftsäcke bereits vollständig entwickelt und zeigen danach nur noch ein Größenwachstum., Embryonal werden sechs Luftsackpaare angelegt, von denen zwei Paare bei fast allen Vögeln (Ausnahme Haubentaucher) in der weiteren Entwicklung zum einheitlichen Schlüsselbeinluftsack verschmelzen. Beim Truthuhn werden nur fünf Luftsackpaare angelegt., Zahl der Luftsäcke., Die Vögel besitzen maximal 12 Luftsäcke, aufgrund der Verschmelzung der vier Schlüsselbeinluftsäcke aber im Regelfall nur 9. Die artspezifische Zahl schwankt zwischen 7 und 11., Luftsacksysteme., Man unterscheidet funktionell zwei Luftsacksysteme:, Atemmechanik bei Vögeln., Prinzip., Die Atmung der Vögel unterscheidet sich grundsätzlich von der der Säugetiere. Bei Säugetieren ändern die Muskeln für Inspiration (Einatmung) und Exspiration (Ausatmung) das Volumen des Brustkorbs und mit diesem das Volumen der Lungen, wodurch Luft in die Lungen ein- und ausströmt. Auch bei Reptilien ändern Muskeln das Volumen des Brustkorbs – und sofern vorhanden, das ihrer Luftsäcke – zur Atmung, während die Lunge von Vögeln keine Volumenänderungen ausführen kann., Die wichtigsten Inspirationsmuskeln sind die Rippenanhangsmuskeln (\\"Musculi appendicocostales\\"). Ihre Kontraktion führt zur Erweiterung des Brustkorbs. Auch die Abwärtsbewegung des Brustbeins trägt maßgeblich zu diesem Prozess bei. Dies führt zu einem Unterdruck in der Leibeshöhle und damit zu einer Erweiterung der Luftsäcke, wodurch Luft durch die Lunge hindurch angesaugt wird. Die wichtigsten Exspirationsmuskeln sind die Bauchmuskeln, die die Leibeshöhle verengen und damit die Luft aus den Luftsäcken verdrängen. Sowohl bei der Ein- als auch bei der Ausatmung strömt die Luft von hinten nach vorn durch die Parabronchien der Lunge., Ruheatmung., In der Ruheatmung (Abb. A) ist zumeist nur das hintere Luftsacksystem aktiv. Von den beiden hinteren Luftsackpaaren wird Luft durch einen Teil der Lunge (so genannte \\"Neopulmo\\") gesaugt, zum Teil gelangt auch Frischluft in diese Luftsäcke. Damit befindet sich am Ende der Einatmung Mischluft mit einem noch nutzbaren Sauerstoffanteil in den hinteren Luftsäcken. Bei der Ausatmung wird diese Mischluft nun noch einmal durch die Lunge geleitet und somit viel effektiver ausgenutzt als beim Säugetier mit seinen blind endenden Luftwegen und dem dementsprechend hohen Totraum., Dieses effiziente System kompensiert auch das große Volumen der Luftröhre bei Vögeln, die im Vergleich zu Säugetieren länger und dicker ist und ein etwa 4,5faches Totraumvolumen hat., Forcierte Atmung., Bei vermehrter Atmung (Abb. B) kommt zu der normalen Atmung noch das vordere Luftsacksystem dazu. Es saugt Frischluft durch den übrigen Teil der Lunge (so genannte \\"Palaeopulmo\\"). Die verbrauchte Luft dieses Luftsacksystems gelangt bei der Ausatmung direkt in die Luftröhre, wird also nicht noch einmal durch die Lunge geleitet., Tierartliche Besonderheiten., Bei Vogelarten ohne Neopulmo (z.B. Pinguine) gelangt nur Frischluft in die hinteren Luftsäcke, sie nutzen bei der Einatmung das vordere, bei der Ausatmung das hintere System. Bei Störchen ist die Neopulmo schwach entwickelt., Konsequenzen aus der Atemmechanik., Beim Festhalten und bei der Manipulation von Vögeln ist die komplexe Atemmechanik zu beachten. Beim In-die-Hand-nehmen ist darauf zu achten, dass der Brustkorb nicht zu stark in seiner Bewegung eingeschränkt wird. Legt man Vögel auf den Rücken, so behindert die Last der übrigen Organe die Entfaltung der Bauchluftsäcke und die Schwerkraft des Brustmuskels die des Brustbeins, so dass es schnell zu Atemnot oder gar zu einer Erstickung kommen kann., Evolutionärer Ursprung des Luftsacksystems., Bei zahlreichen Vertretern der Theropoden, der Klade der Dinosaurier, aus denen die modernen Vögel hervorgingen, sind Wirbel und Rippen mit pneumatischen Foramina vergleichbar denen rezenter Vögel nachgewiesen, ebenso beim Urvogel \\"Archaeopteryx\\". Sie weisen darauf hin, dass bereits bei den Vorfahren der Vögel bestimmte Knochen mit Aussackungen (Divertikeln) eines Luftsacksystems gefüllt (das heißt pneumatisiert) waren. Innerhalb der Archosaurier, deren rezente Vertreter die Krokodile und die Vögel sind, besaßen neben den Theropoden, die als Stammgruppe der Vögel gelten, weitere Gruppen (die Flugsaurier und die Sauropoden) pneumatisierte Knochen, so dass von manchen Paläontologen angenommen wird, ein Luftsacksystem sei nicht nur ein urtümliches Merkmal der Vögel, sondern das einer weitaus größeren und älteren Gruppe, der so genannten Ornithodiren, gewesen., Inwiefern die Funktion des Atmungssystems bei rezenten Vögeln und Nicht-Vogel-Theropoden ähnlich war, wird kontrovers diskutiert: O’Connor und Claessens (2005) schlagen für Nicht-Vogel-Theropoden eine den Vögeln ähnliche Form der Durchströmungsatmung vor. Sie wiesen in einem gut erhaltenen fossilen Exemplar der urtümlichen Theropoden-Gattung \\"Majungatholus\\" pneumatische Öffnungen in Hals-, Brust- und Beckenwirbeln nach., Dass die Neuralbögen der Brustwirbel 12 und 13 verglichen mit den davor und dahinter liegenden besonders kleine Öffnungen zeigen, interpretieren sie als Trennung zwischen einem vorderen (kranialen) und einem hinteren (kaudalen) Luftsacksystem, denen jeweils die Divertikel in den vorderen bzw. hinteren Wirbelkörpern und Neuralbögen zuzuordnen sind. Das Vorhandensein eines hinteren Luftsacksystems, das mechanisch einfacher zu „belüften“ sei als ein vorderes, halten O’Connor und Claessens für eine entscheidende Voraussetzung für eine vogelähnliche Durchströmung der Lunge (siehe Ruheatmung bei rezenten Vögeln, Abb. A)., Theropoden einschließlich früher Vögel besaßen im Gegensatz zu rezenten flugfähigen Vögeln nur ein kleines, kaum den vorderen Brustbereich einnehmendes Brustbein und ein dreistrahliges Becken – das Schambein war bauchwärts gerichtet und nicht wie bei späteren Vögeln parallel zu Darmbein und Sitzbein rotiert. Offenbar spielten Auf- und Abwärtsbewegungen des Brustbeins sowie Rotationen des Beckens („Beckenatmung“) beim Ein- und Ausatmen zu Beginn der Vogelevolution noch keine Rolle. Andererseits waren Theropoden einschließlich urtümlicher mesozoische Vögel wie \\"Archaeopteryx\\", \\"Confuciusornis\\" und \\"Sinornis\\" im Besitz miteinander verzahnter Bauchrippen (\\"Gastralia\\"). Durch die Kontraktion der Bauchmuskulatur (besonders des \\"Musculus rectus abdominis\\") wurden laut Claessens (2004) die Bauchrippen gegeneinander geschoben und so der hintere Brustraum seitlich erweitert. Somit ermöglichte die Kontraktion derselben Muskeln, die bei rezenten Vögeln zur Verringerung des Brustraumvolumens beim Ausatmen beitragen, bei frühen Vögeln und Nicht-Vogel-Theropoden paradoxerweise das Einatmen. Dieser Atemmechanismus, der auf Verschiebung eines Systems von Bauchrippen beruht, wird nach Carrier und Farmer (2000) auch als „Kürassatmung“ (\\"cuirassal breathing\\") bezeichnet und als eine notwendige Voraussetzung für eine urtümliche Durchströmungsatmung angesehen. Bei späteren Vögeln wurde mit dem Verlust der Bauchrippen diese Form der Brustraumkontraktion und -expansion durch andere Formen abgelöst., In welchem phylogenetischen Stadium zuerst ein Atemmechanismus ähnlich dem der heutigen Vögel vorlag, ist noch weitgehend offen. Bevor es der Atmung diente, könnte das Luftsacksystem bei Dinosauriern und Flugsauriern thermoregulatorische Funktion gehabt und zur Gewichtsreduktion beigetragen haben. Ruben u.a. (1997, 1999) glauben, bei Fossilien der kleinen theropoden Dinosaurier \\"Sinosauropteryx\\" und \\"Scipionyx\\" versteinertes Weichgewebe des Brust- und Bauchraums vorliegen zu haben, das zeige, dass die Atmung der Theropoden der der Vögel nicht ähnlich sei: Angeblich sei der Brustraum wie bei Krokodilen durch ein Zwerchfell unterteilt gewesen, dessen kolbenartige Bewegung das Ein- und Ausatmen steuerte. Diese Theorie lässt jedoch den Nachweis pneumatischer Foramina in einer großen Zahl von Theropoden unbeachtet. Und dass die Versteinerungen bzw. Hautschatten im Bereich des Bauchraums der genannten Exemplare tatsächlich oben genannte Aussagen zur Lage und Anatomie der inneren Organe zulassen, gilt unter Paläontologen als zweifelhaft., Klinische Bedeutung., Das Luftsacksystem ist häufig bei Erkrankungen der Atemwege mit betroffen. Der Bau der Luftsäcke führt dazu, dass Vögel, anders als Säugetiere, Fremdkörper nicht abhusten können. Erkrankungen des Luftsacks gehen im Allgemeinen mit schwerer Atemnot einher., Die Luftsäcke sind limitierender Faktor für die Ultraschalluntersuchung bei Vögeln, da die Grenzfläche Gewebe/Luft eine Totalreflexion der Schallwellen verursacht. Eine direkte Applikation von Isofluran in die Luftsäcke ist als Narkosemöglichkeit beschrieben.]: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Vögel, Luftsäcke, Anatomie, Gewebe, Funktion, Einteilung, Zahl, Luftsacksysteme, Atemmechanik, Ruheatmung"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Flugabwehrkanone (Bundeswehr), Flugabwehrpanzer, Kettenfahrzeug der Bundeswehr, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, Rheinmetall], Der Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard (FlakPz Gepard) ist ein autonomer, allwetterkampffähiger FlaK-Panzer aus deutscher Produktion. Bereits in den 1970er-Jahren entwickelt und produziert, bildete er für lange Zeit einen Eckpfeiler der Flugabwehr des Heeres der Bundeswehr, des niederländischen und des belgischen Heeres. Mit der Außerdienststellung bei den ursprünglichen Nutzern Ende der 1990er- bis Anfang der 2000er-Jahre wird er in der Zwischenzeit nur noch bei anderen Armeen verwendet, insbesondere seit 2022 in der Ukraine., Hintergrund., Der Gepard wurde primär entwickelt, um im taktischen Rahmen des Gefechts der verbundenen Waffen den beweglichen Panzer- und Panzergrenadiertruppen der Bundeswehr Schutz vor tieffliegenden Flugzeugen und Kampfhubschraubern zu geben. Er besitzt bezüglich seiner Gefechtsfeldmobilität und Motorleistung vergleichbare Eigenschaften wie die damals eingesetzten oder in der Entwicklung stehenden Panzer Leopard1, Marder und Jaguar. Der Gepard wurde auch zum Objektschutz von stationären hochwertigen Zielen wie Flugplätzen oder Brücken eingesetzt. Gemäß der Einsatzdoktrin des Kalten Krieges kann er unter ABC-Vollschutz eingesetzt werden., Die Auswahl der Bewaffnung berücksichtigte insbesondere die Bekämpfung von stark gepanzerten Kampfhubschraubern wie dem MilMi-24„Hind“, dessen Panzerung effektiv Schutz vor Geschossen bis zum Kaliber 23Millimeter (mm) bietet., Der Gepard wurde zunächst an weitere NATO-Mitgliedsstaaten wie die Niederlande und Belgien geliefert. Das sowjetische Pendant zum Gepard war das Flugabwehrsystem ZSU-23-4 „Schilka“, das ein Jahrzehnt früher entwickelt wurde und nicht die Leistungsfähigkeit des Gepard im Bereich Zielerfassung, Feuerleitung und Zielbekämpfung während der Fahrt erreichte.&lt;ref name=\\"Shilka/Gepard\\"&gt;Christopher F. Foss, David Miller: \\"Moderne Gefechtswaffen: Technik, Taktik und Einsatz.\\" Motorbuchverlag, ISBN 3-7276-7092-4, S. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Weitere sowjetische Gegenstücke sind das 2K22 Tunguska aus den 1980er-Jahren und das modernere Panzir-S1-System, wobei die beiden jedoch kombinierte Systeme mit Rohr- und Raketenbewaffnung darstellen., Mit der Ausphasung des M163 Vulcan und dem Scheitern des Projekts Sergeant York bei der US Army gab und gibt es in den westlichen Staaten auch über 40 Jahre nach der ersten Indienststellung kein in nennenswerter Stückzahl produziertes Äquivalent zum Gepard. In dem Zusammenhang muss allerdings erwähnt werden, dass gerade hier in 1980er- und 1990er-Jahren ein Wechsel von Flugabwehrkanonen zu Flugabwehrraketen vollzogen wurde., Geschichte, Varianten und Produktion., Vorgeschichte., Die Initiative für die Entwicklung des Gepard geht auf das Amt Blank, den Vorläufer des Bundesministeriums der Verteidigung (BMVg), zurück. Dort wurde im Januar 1955 die Notwendigkeit eines hochmobilen, mit elektronischer Feuerleitung ausgerüsteten Flugabwehrsystems formuliert. Im September 1956 wurden die Entwicklungsrichtlinien festgelegt, die das Fahrgestell des Schützenpanzers HS 30 von Hispano Suiza (Suisse) vorsahen. Auch der Kaliberbereich zwischen 20 und 40mm wurde festgelegt. Die erste Studie basierte auf einem Truppenversuchsmuster des HS-30-Fahrgestells mit einem Holzmodell des Turms \\"A 14\\", der mit zwei 30×170mm Maschinenkanonen (Typ: \\"HS 831\\") bestückt war. Schon im Juli 1958 wurde diese Entwicklung laut Ministeranweisung gestoppt. Offiziell aus Haushaltsgründen lag der eigentliche Grund aber in Spannungen zwischen dem Bundesministerium der Verteidigung und dem Lieferanten Hispano Suiza, die ihren Ursprung in den Mängeln des HS 30 in der Erprobung hatten. Der T249 Vigilante war ein ähnliches Entwicklungsprojekt, welches bei Springfield Armory erprobt wurde., Bereits im August 1958 wurde die Fortsetzung der Entwicklung vom BMVg beschlossen. Anfang 1959 wurde Rheinmetall mit Studienarbeiten beauftragt und am 7.September 1959 die Forderungen zusammengefasst: Bei einem Turmgewicht unter 5Tonnen (t) sollte der neue Panzer mit einer 30-mm-Zwillingskanone und einem Feuerleitradar mit Eignung zur Zielsuche in einem Sektor ausgerüstet sein. Des Weiteren sollte das Fahrgestell des \\"Schützenpanzer neu\\" (dem späteren Schützenpanzer Marder) verwendet werden und das Gesamtgewicht nicht über 20t liegen., 1961 erfolgte schließlich die Vergabe von zwei Entwicklungsaufträgen zur Lieferung von zwei Prototypen an Rheinmetall und British Manufacture and Research Company (BMARC), damals ein britisches Tochterunternehmen von Hispano Suiza (Suisse) und später von British Aerospace (heute: BAE Systems) übernommen. Für beide Prototypen sollte ein Q-Band-Feuerleitradar (8mm) von Elliott Automation Limited zum Einsatz kommen. Im November 1963 wurde nach einem Besuch einer Expertenkommission bei BMARC der Prototyp abgelehnt und die Entwicklung eingestellt. Hauptgrund für den Abbruch war das Nichteinhalten des Lastenheftes ohne Aussicht auf eine erfolgreiche technische Erprobung und damit Serienreife. Doch auch die Entwicklung von Rheinmetall wurde im Dezember 1964 eingestellt: Die HS831L-Maschinenkanonen erwiesen sich als mangelhaft und das Radar von Elliott als untauglich– wie schon beim Entwurf von BMARC. Eine Gemeinsamkeit der beiden Prototypen war auch, dass das Fahrgestell des „Marder“ durch das hohe Turmgewicht überlastet wurde und die Platzverhältnisse zu beengt waren., Der Weg zum Gepard., Basierend auf den Erkenntnissen der gescheiterten Studien und Prototypen genehmigte das BMVg am 27.September 1965 die Verwendung des Fahrgestells des Leopard 1 für die Entwicklung des Flakpanzers. Aus den vorausgegangenen Projekten wurden zudem Erfahrungen im Bereich optisches Flugabwehr-Visier, Waffenrechner und dem Zusammenspiel Waffenrechner und Feuerleitung gewonnen., Die Neuanforderung der Bundeswehr umfasste Tag-, Nacht- und Allwetterkampffähigkeit, eine Kampfentfernung von 3000m und Bekämpfungshöhe von 2000m, Maximalgewicht von 42t (Gesamtgewicht) bzw. 12t (Turm), ABC-Vollschutz und Watfähigkeit, Puls-Doppler-Suchradar und Folgeradar mit 4000-m-Reichweite und mit IFF, Energieversorgungsanlage im Fahrgestell und Fahrzeugnavigationsanlage. Für die Waffenanlage wurde ein Höhenrichtbereich von −10° bis +85° und Seitenrichtbereich von 360°, 1000 Schuss Munitionsvorrat, optisches und Erdzielvisier und kurze Reaktionszeit gefordert., Matador 30 mm., Als Arbeitsgemeinschaft erhielten die Unternehmen Rheinmetall (Waffenanlage und Turm), AEG-Telefunken (Folgeradar und Computer), Siemens (Suchradar) und Porsche und Kraus-Maffei (Fahrgestell, Entwicklung und Energieversorgung) im Juni 1966 die ersten Entwicklungsaufträge, um einen neuen Panzer mit zwei 30-mm-HS-831-Maschinenkanonen zu entwickeln. Das zunächst verfolgte Konzept des Systemverbundes „Mobiles Allwetter Tiefflieger Abwehrsystem mit Doppler-Radar und 30-mm-Zwillingskanone auf Leopard“ (MATADOR 30 ZL) mit der Kombination eines Tieffliegerüberwachungspanzers (TUPA) und mehreren Tieffliegerabwehrpanzern (TAPA) wurde bereits im Juli 1967 neu ausgerichtet. Die Forderung der Zusammenfassung der Fähigkeiten auf einen autonomen Panzer wurde dann als „Mobiles Allwetter Tiefflieger Abwehrsystem mit Doppler-Radar und 30-mm-Zwillingskanone auf Leopard – Autonom“ (MATADOR 30 ZLA) weitergeführt. Autonom heißt in dem Zusammenhang, dass der Panzer ohne externe Unterstützung Ziele bekämpfen kann, da das Radar, die Feuerleitanlage und die Bewaffnung im Panzer integriert sind., 1968 und 1969 wurden drei Serie-0-Prototypen des Leopard-1-Fahrgestells bereitgestellt. Zwei davon wurden mit Turmgefechtssimulatoren ausgerüstet, während beim Dritten ein voll funktionsfähiger Turm eingerüstet wurde, der auch intensiv erprobt wurde. Die Ausrüstung umfasste das \\"MPDR 12\\" (Mobiles Puls-Doppler-Radar mit 12km Reichweite), Panorama-Zieloptiken und das Folgeradar \\"Marder\\". Die Bestellung wurde später um vier weitere Einheiten ergänzt., Nach Verzögerungen in der Entwicklung und wegen der angespannten Haushaltslage entschloss man sich am 25.Juni 1970, das Projekt schließlich zugunsten des \\"35-mm-Flugabwehrkanonenpanzers\\" einzustellen; das Feuerleitsystem galt zwar als moderner, wäre aber erst rund zwei Jahre später geliefert worden., 35-mm-Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer., Schon im Januar 1958 wurde vom Schweizer Unternehmen Oerlikon-Bührle (heute ein Teil der \\"Rheinmetall Air Defence AG\\") ein Gegenentwurf mit einer 35-mm-Zwillingskanone vorgeschlagen. Dieser Entwurf wurde aber vor dem Hintergrund der Verwendung eines Schützenpanzer-Fahrgestells abgelehnt, da für ein derartiges Kaliber eine Kampfpanzerwanne notwendig gewesen wäre (damals M47 oder M48). Anfang der 1960er wurde das Konzept eines modernen Flakpanzers von der Arbeitsgemeinschaft \\"Oerlikon-Contraves-Albis\\" weiter verfolgt und 1962 dem BMVg mit zwei 35-mm-Maschinenkanonen (Typ: \\"Fla-353\\") vorgelegt. Auch dieser Vorschlag wurde mit der Begründung abgelehnt, dass das verwendete Kaliber bei der Bundeswehr nicht eingeführt war., Flakpanzer 35 mm Typ A/5 PFZ-A., Mit der Freigabe der Leopard-1-Wanne für den neuen Flakpanzer 1965 wurde der Weg für die Schweizer Arbeitsgemeinschaft wieder frei. So präsentierte sie 1966 eine Machbarkeitsstudie für einen vollkommen autonomen Panzer, der sämtliche Anforderungen erfüllte. Am 23.Juni 1966 wurde parallel zum „Matador“ entschieden, zwei Prototypen des \\"Flakpanzer 35mm Typ A\\" auf Basis der Studie zu bestellen, und Krauss-Maffei lieferte 1967 zwei modifizierte Leopard-1-Fahrgestelle der Serie0. Darüber hinaus wurde 1968 ein weiteres Fahrgestell geliefert, das als Werksprototyp zur internen Erprobung dienen sollte. Im Juni desselben Jahres erfolgte auch die Vorstellung vor einem größeren Fachpublikum., Bereits im November 1968 wurde das erste Scharfschießen durchgeführt, bei dem die neu entwickelte Feuerleitanlage und die Waffenanlage durch ihre Präzision überzeugten. Obwohl das Kaliber 35mm damals ungewöhnlich war, stellte sich im Vergleich schnell heraus, dass es ein geringeres Entwicklungsrisiko und deutliche Vorteile im Feuerkampf durch das größere Kaliber hatte; außerdem zeigte auch die niederländische Armee Interesse an dem 35-mm-System und beteiligte sich ab 1967 an den deutschen Aktivitäten.

Pars pro toto) war der Versuch der deutschen Luftwaffe, im Zweiten Weltkrieg nach dem Sieg über Frankreich zwischen Sommer 1940 und Anfang 1941 mit Luftangriffen gegen die britischen Streitkräfte und britische Städte die Kapitulation des Vereinigten Königreichs zu erzwingen bzw. durch die Erringung der Luftüberlegenheit die geplante Invasion der Insel vorzubereiten. International bekannt als \\"Battle of Britain\\" (\\"Schlacht um [Groß-]Britannien\\"), war die Luftschlacht eine Serie von Gefechten im britischen Luftraum, die von der deutschen Luftwaffe gegen die Royal Air Force (RAF) geführt wurde. Britische Historiker legen den Zeitraum der Schlacht vom 10. Juli bis zum 31. Oktober 1940 fest, da ab diesem Tag die Tagangriffe in größerem Ausmaß ausblieben. Manche Quellen und Statistiken beziehen sich auf einen Zeitraum bis zum Mai 1941, als die Kampfgeschwader der Luftwaffe für das Unternehmen Barbarossa abgezogen wurden., Ziel des Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht war die Erringung der Luftherrschaft über den britischen Luftraum durch die Vernichtung der Royal Air Force (RAF). Dies galt als Grundvoraussetzung für eine erfolgreiche Invasion, deren Planung bereits im Dezember 1939 zwischen Hitler und Großadmiral Raeder besprochen worden war (Unternehmen Seelöwe). Hitler hoffte jedoch später, das Vereinigte Königreich durch verstärktes Bombardement zu Friedensverhandlungen zwingen zu können; Ende September 1940 wurden die Invasionspläne intern auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben, also faktisch aufgegeben., Der Begriff \\"Battle of Britain\\" wurde vom britischen Premierminister Winston Churchill geprägt, der am 18. Juni 1940 in einer Rede vor dem Unterhaus erklärte:, Hintergrund., In den 1930er-Jahren wurde die Rolle der Luftstreitkräfte in einem künftigen Krieg von führenden Militärs ebenso wie von Politikern als entscheidend angesehen., Diese Meinung stützte sich auf die Erfolge der im Ersten Weltkrieg von deutschen Luftschiffen und Bombern auf Großbritannien durchgeführten Bombenangriffe. Sie hatten trotz der geringen Zahl eingesetzter Luftfahrzeuge und der kleinen abgeworfenen Bombenlasten die britische Rüstungsproduktion spürbar geschädigt und den Abzug bedeutender britischer Kräfte von der Westfront nötig gemacht. Der Schaden an zerstörtem Gerät und der Ausfall der getroffenen Betriebe wurde dabei weit übertroffen durch den Produktionsausfall, der dadurch verursacht wurde, dass Fabrikarbeiter aus Furcht vor weiteren Bombenangriffen nicht am Arbeitsplatz erschienen. Dies machte in der Planung des Luftkrieges die Moral der Bevölkerung zu einem wichtigen Faktor., Die Entwicklung der Luftfahrttechnik und der Technik des Verbrennungsmotors (höhere Leistungsdichte) führte außerdem dazu, dass in den 1920er- und 1930er-Jahren größere und schnellere Bomber mit schwererer Bombenlast als im Ersten Weltkrieg gebaut werden konnten. Militärs und Politiker erwarteten daher, dass die Wirkung zukünftiger Bombenangriffe die im Ersten Weltkrieg beobachteten Effekte weit übertreffen würde., Durch den geringen Leistungsvorsprung der in der Zwischenkriegszeit gebauten Jagdflugzeuge gegenüber den Bombern und das Fehlen eines funktionsfähigen Luftraumüberwachungssystems nahm man an, dass es den feindlichen Jagdflugzeugen selten gelingen würde, die Bomber überhaupt abzufangen. Sollten die Jagdflugzeuge doch einmal in Schussposition gelangen, wurde erwartet, dass die Bomber aufgrund ihrer verbesserten Abwehrbewaffnung bei gegenseitiger Feuerunterstützung im engen Formationsflug alle Angriffe von Jagdflugzeugen abwehren könnten., Der einflussreiche britische Politiker Stanley Baldwin äußerte 1932: \\"„Der Bomber wird immer [zum Ziel] durchkommen“\\" und drückte die damals verbreitete Ansicht aus, ein zukünftiger Krieg würde durch Luftangriffe auf die Zivilbevölkerung entschieden werden. Gemäß der 1928 formulierten Trenchard-Doktrin nahm man an, dass Bombenangriffe auf \\"„alle Objekte, die wirksam zur Zerstörung der gegnerischen Mittel des Angriffs beitragen und seine Entschlossenheit zum Kampf verringern“\\" strategisch günstiger seien, als gegen feindliche Streitkräfte in direkter Feldschlacht vorzugehen, und begann bereits mit der Entwicklung der Stabbrandbombe, der Hauptwaffe des späteren Bombenkrieges und dem Auslöser von über 20 Feuerstürmen in deutschen Großstädten ab Frühjahr 1943., Als 1934 ein Krieg gegen das seit 1933 von Hitler geführte und stark aufrüstende Deutsche Reich absehbar wurde, formulierte die britische Regierung einen auf fünf Jahre angelegten Plan zur Erweiterung der britischen Luftstreitkräfte. Er sah sowohl die Aufstellung einer starken Streitmacht von Bombern zum Angriff auf Deutschland als auch die Schaffung eines Luftverteidigungssystems zur Abwehr deutscher Bombenangriffe vor. Dieser Plan wurde in wesentlichen Teilen entsprechend dem ursprünglichen Entwurf umgesetzt. Der Aufbau eines Netzes von Militärflugplätzen in Südengland und die Ausbildung eines Kaders von Kampfpiloten und Besatzungen hatten dabei Priorität. Die Ausrüstung der Royal Air Force mit modernen Kampfflugzeugen konnte dagegen erst gegen Ende des Planungszeitraums stattfinden., Das Fehlen genügend starker und einsatzbereiter Luftstreitkräfte in den 1930er Jahren beeinflusste die britische Politik und wird häufig als einer der Gründe für Chamberlains Appeasement-Politik angesehen. Umgekehrt war sich das Deutsche Reich der von seiner neu geschaffenen Luftwaffe ausgehenden Drohwirkung voll bewusst und nutzte sie zur Unterstützung seiner expansiven Politik. Dass zur Luftverteidigung eine Radarkette an der englischen Südküste aufgebaut wurde (siehe Chain Home), blieb den Deutschen verborgen., Schon die ersten Monate des Zweiten Weltkriegs zeigten, dass die Erwartungen an die Kampfkraft von Bombern viel zu hoch gewesen waren. Bereits 1939 wurde durch britische Angriffe auf deutsche Kriegsschiffe und Marinestützpunkte an der Nordsee deutlich, dass durch Suchradar geführte Jagdflugzeuge jetzt Bomber zum Kampf stellen und den Bomberformationen trotz ihrer Abwehrbewaffnung vernichtende Verluste zufügen könnten, so etwa im Dezember 1939 im Luftgefecht über der Deutschen Bucht. Diese Schlussfolgerung ließ britische Luftverteidigungssysteme als wesentlich wichtiger erscheinen, als man vor dem Krieg erwartet hatte. Zugleich hatten sich Bomberangriffe als weniger wirkungsvoll erwiesen als gedacht., Trotzdem hielten die Briten an der Erwartung fest, Bombenangriffe gegen die Zivilbevölkerung würden kriegsentscheidend sein (ab 1942 „morale bombing“ genannt). Auch die deutschen Luftangriffe während der darauf folgenden Luftschlacht um England richteten sich in der Endphase, von der die Entscheidung erwartet wurde, gegen den Großraum London („The Blitz“) und damit gegen die Zivilbevölkerung Großbritanniens., Hitler war offenbar unentschlossen Großbritannien anzugreifen., Ausgangssituation., Seitdem 1934 der Erweiterungsplan für die Royal Air Force (RAF) unter dem Namen \\"Plan A\\" verabschiedet worden war, arbeiteten die Briten systematisch am Aufbau einer modernen Luftwaffe. Die wichtigsten Schritte waren dabei der Ausbau eines Netzwerks von Fliegerhorsten, der Aufbau einer Basis von geschultem Bodenpersonal und eines Kaders von Piloten, und später – etwa in den zwei Jahren zwischen dem Münchner Abkommen und der Luftschlacht um England – die Ausrüstung der RAF mit modernen Bombern und Jagdflugzeugen., Am 1. September 1939 griff das Deutsche Reich Polen an, Frankreich und Großbritannien erklärten Deutschland am 3. September den Krieg, der Zweite Weltkrieg hatte begonnen., In mehreren \\"Blitzkriegen\\" konnte Deutschland 1940 den Alliierten massive Verluste zufügen und während des Westfeldzugs die Beneluxländer und weite Teile Frankreichs besetzen. Die britischen Truppen auf dem Festland wurden bei der nordfranzösischen Hafenstadt Dünkirchen eingekesselt, konnten jedoch in der Operation Dynamo gerade noch vor der Vernichtung gerettet werden. Die Rettung der Expeditionsarmee von ca. 240.000 Soldaten und von 100.000 weiteren Soldaten verbündeter Staaten förderte sehr die britische Moral. Da bei der Evakuierung alle schweren Waffen zurückgelassen werden mussten, war die erfolgreiche Verteidigung der britischen Inseln gegen eine deutsche Invasion noch nicht sicher. Der überragende Abwehrerfolg weniger Tage bildete aber die entscheidende Grundlage für Churchills kategorisches \\"Nein\\", mit dem Deutschen Reich Friedensverhandlungen aufzunehmen und war der frühzeitige Anfang vom Ende des Invasionsplans gegen England. Hitler entschloss sich zu dem Angriff auf die Sowjetunion, den ideologischen Hauptgegner, ohne vorher den Gegner im Westen besiegt zu haben oder mit ihm zu einem \\"modus vivendi\\" gekommen zu sein., Am 22. Juni 1940 wurde zwischen der französischen Armee und der deutschen Wehrmacht ein Waffenstillstand unterzeichnet, sehr zur Enttäuschung Großbritanniens, im selben Monat gelang es der deutschen Wehrmacht die Kanalinseln (Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, Sark und Herm) als einziges britisches Gebiet bis Kriegsende 1945 zu besetzen., Begründet durch den schnellen Sieg über alle Kriegsgegner außer Großbritannien wurden von Hitler Signale erwartet, die den Wunsch auf Beendigung der Kampfhandlungen seitens der Briten ausdrückten. Tatsächlich gab es politische und populäre Strömungen, die dazu bereit waren., Doch Arthur Neville Chamberlain, der bis dahin die Appeasement-Politik vertreten hatte, war am 10. Mai 1940 als Premierminister zurückgetreten, und der energische Winston Churchill trat an seine Stelle. Er stellte am 13. Mai klar, dass der \\"„Krieg gegen eine monströse Tyrannei, wie sie nie übertroffen worden ist, im finsteren Katalog der Verbrechen der Menschheit“\\" nur mit einem \\"„Sieg um jeden Preis“\\" beendet werden dürfe. Die Angriffe der britischen RAF auf deutsche Städte begannen mit dem Angriff auf Mönchengladbach am 11. Mai 1940 mit 35 Bombern., Am 16. Juli 1940 gab Hitler den Befehl zur Vorbereitung des Unternehmens Seelöwe. Um diesen Plan durchführen zu können, war sich der deutsche Generalstab sicher, müsse man erst die Luftherrschaft über England gewinnen., Hitlers Appell an die \\"Vernunft\\" Englands, es könne weiteres Blutvergießen vermieden werden, ausgesprochen in einer Rede vor dem Reichstag am 19. Juli, führte zu keiner Reaktion., Aus heutiger Sicht wird der Plan zur Landung in Großbritannien als unrealistisch angesehen. Weder die Ausrüstung der Kriegsmarine noch des Heeres war für dieses Vorhaben geeignet.

Er wurde am 27. Juni 1998 eröffnet und liegt im Distrikt Sepang des malaysischen Bundesstaates Selangor, 44 Kilometer südlich der Hauptstadt Kuala Lumpur. Der Flughafen dient den malaysischen Fluggesellschaften Malaysia Airlines und AirAsia als Drehkreuz., Geographie und Verkehrsanbindung., Der Flughafen befindet sich am südlichen Ende des etwa 50 Kilometer langen sogenannten Multimedia Super Corridors, einer Sonderwirtschaftszone, die sich vom Norden von Kuala Lumpur aus über die neu gebauten Städte Putrajaya und Cyberjaya, den Formel-1-Kurs in Sepang bis hin zum Flughafen im Süden erstreckt. Der Flughafen wurde auf einem Gebiet ehemaliger Ölpalmplantagen errichtet. Auch heute noch ist er von solchen Plantagen umgeben. Im Umkreis von 100km leben mehr als sieben Millionen Menschen, also rund ein Drittel der malaysischen Bevölkerung. Sechs der zehn größten Städte Malaysias sind weniger als 100km vom Flughafen entfernt, zum Stadtzentrum Kuala Lumpurs sind es 44km, zur Küste 16km., Zwar liegt der Flughafen strategisch günstig als Zwischenstopp oder Umsteigeort für Flüge von Europa nach Indonesien, Australien, Neuseeland und in die Philippinen, steht aber in Konkurrenz mit den benachbarten südost-asiatischen Drehkreuzen, den Flughäfen Singapur, Bangkok und Jakarta., Seit 2002 verkehren der \\"KLIA Ekspres\\" und der \\"KLIA Transit\\" in die Innenstadt Kuala Lumpurs. Beide fahren in Kuala Lumpur im City-Air-Terminal ab, einem Teil des Hauptbahnhofs und kommen in der untersten Ebene im Hauptabfertigungsgebäude des Flughafens an. Mehrere Fluggesellschaften bieten ihren Kunden die Möglichkeit, bereits im City-Air-Terminal einzuchecken. Das aufgegebene Gepäck fährt mit dem KLIA Ekspres zum Flughafen., Der \\"KLIA Ekspres\\" fährt die 57 Kilometer lange Strecke ohne Unterbrechung, während der KLIA Transit an drei zusätzlichen Stationen anhält. Die beiden Endbahnhöfe sind mit Bahnsteigtüren ausgestattet, welche erst dann automatisch öffnen, wenn der Zug steht., Weiterhin ist der Flughafen durch Schnellbusse privater Unternehmen an die Innenstadt angebunden. Endhaltepunkte sind der Zentralbahnhof Kuala Lumpur Sentral sowie der Busbahnhof Puduraya., Flughafengelände., Das Flughafenareal ist derzeit insgesamt rund zehnkm² groß. Fast alle Flughafeneinrichtungen befinden sich zwischen den beiden zueinander parallelen, vier Kilometer langen Start- und Landebahnen, ähnlich dem Flughafen München. Die zwei bisher realisierten Start- und Landebahnen verlaufen in Nordwest-Südost-Richtung., Die autobahnähnliche Schnellstraße und die Schnellbahntrasse kommen von Norden auf den Flughafen zu. Die Schnellstraße macht auf Höhe des Towers eine Linkskurve und teilt sich dort auf die verschiedenen Anfahrten zu den Abfertigungsgebäuden und den anderen Infrastruktureinrichtungen auf. Zwischen diesen Straßen befindet sich der 132 Meter hohe Flughafentower, der nach Bangkok (132,2m) zweithöchste Tower weltweit., Das zentrale Hauptabfertigungsgebäude mit seinen charakteristischen Zeltdächern und das vorgelagerte Pierabfertigungsgebäude, der Contact Pier – ein Gebäudeschlauch mit Flugsteigen – liegen zwischen den beiden Start- und Landebahnen und senkrecht zu diesen. Vor diesem Pier verlaufen zwei Rollbahnen, die die beiden Pisten miteinander verbinden. Südlich davon befindet sich das bisher einzige, kreuzförmige Satellitenabfertigungsgebäude, das durch einen Pendelzug (Aerotrain) mit dem Contact Pier verbunden ist und ausschließlich zur Abfertigung internationaler Passagiere dient., Westlich des Satelliten befindet sich heute eine große quadratische unbebaute Fläche, auf der in Zukunft das zweite Satellitengebäude errichtet werden soll. Südlich des Satelliten stehen die Frachtabfertigungsgebäude, das Abfertigungsgebäude für Billigfluggesellschaften (Low-Cost-Carrier-Terminal) und, noch weiter südlich, entlang der westlichen Piste, die Hangars der ansässigen Malaysia Airlines und Kerosintanks., Zwischen dem Satelliten und dem Low-Cost-Carrier-Terminal befindet sich ein kleiner Kontrollturm, der nur für die Überwachung der Flugzeugbewegungen auf dem Vorfeld zuständig ist., Geschichte., Hintergründe., Bereits 1990 begann die malaysische Regierung mit der Planung eines neuen, leistungsstarken Flughafens für die Hauptstadt, da der alte Flughafen \\"Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah\\" in Subang schon lange chronisch überlastet war und keine weiteren Ausbaumöglichkeiten bot; der größte Unterstützer des Projektes war zu dieser Zeit der damalige malaysische Premierminister Mahathir bin Mohamad. Mit dem neuen Flughafen sollte der Kapazitätsbedarf für das Verkehrsaufkommen der nächsten Dekaden gedeckt werden., Bauarbeiten und Fertigstellung., Die Baukosten für die erste Ausbaustufe beliefen sich auf mehr als 3,5 Mrd. US-Dollar (etwa 2,73 Mrd. Euro, Kurs: 10. November 2006). Nach nur vier Jahren und sechs Monaten waren die Arbeiten abgeschlossen – bis dahin war noch nie zuvor ein Flughafen solcher Größe in so einer kurzen Bauzeit errichtet worden. Über 25.000 Bauarbeiter aus verschiedenen Ländern wirkten auf der damals größten Baustelle Malaysias mit., Bevor die ersten Bautrupps anrücken konnten, musste ein Orang-Asli-Dorf (Ureinwohner) mit 85 Familien in eine andere Gegend umgesiedelt werden. Damit diese weiterhin Landwirtschaft betreiben konnten, wurden ihnen dort zum Ausgleich andere Agrarflächen zugeteilt. Die Tatsache, dass nur diese Orang Asli-Siedlung in dem Gebiet existierte, war ein ausschlaggebender Standortfaktor und machte die Ansiedlung des neuen Flughafens dort attraktiv., Am 27. Juni 1998 wurde der Flughafen offiziell eingeweiht. Überschattet wurde der Festakt von Problemen mit dem Gepäckfördersystem, welches zusammenbrach, außerdem stürzten die Systeme mehrerer Fluggastbrücken und Parkpositions-Anweisungsbildschirme des Visual docking guidance systems ab. Infolgedessen bildeten sich lange Schlangen im ganzen Flughafen, viele Gepäckstücke gingen verloren oder wurden erst Tage später ihren Besitzern zugeschickt., Situation heute., Auf einer Fläche von zehnkm² erstreckt sich der Flughafen in seiner ersten Ausbaustufe. Von Anfang an wurde er so geplant, dass die Möglichkeit bestand, ihn stufenweise bis zu einer Kapazität von 80 Millionen Passagieren pro Jahr auszubauen. Heute liegt die Kapazität bei rund 25 Millionen Reisenden, wobei im ersten vollen Betriebsjahr (1999) lediglich 13,2 Millionen abgefertigt wurden., Nur 21Mio. Passagiere konnten 2004 abgefertigt werden. Ursprünglich wurden etwa 35Mio. Passagiere für dieses Jahr prognostiziert. Der Frachtsektor rangiert auf deutlich höheren Rängen im weltweiten Vergleich (ACI zufolge Platz 29), als etwa die Passagierbeförderung (Platz 47) oder die Anzahl der Flugbewegungen. Diese stieg ab 2002 kontinuierlich und beförderte 2005 KLIA damit zum ersten Mal in die Gruppe der weltweit 100 größten Flughäfen in dieser Kategorie., \\"Siehe auch: Verkehrszahlen\\", Abfertigungsgebäude., Hauptabfertigungsgebäude (Main Terminal Building)., Das Hauptabfertigungsgebäude befindet sich zwischen den beiden Runways und hat im Grundriss eine rechteckige Form. Das Dach besteht aus 39 quadratischen Dacheinheiten, welche es ermöglichen, die Halle schnell und günstig auszubauen, indem weitere Gebäudeeinheiten angefügt werden., Das Bauwerk besteht aus fünf übereinander liegenden Ebenen. Die unterste Ebene beherbergt den Flughafenbahnhof, von dem die KLIA-Ekspres-Züge alle 15 bis 20 Minuten ohne bzw. die \\"KLIA Transit\\"-Züge alle 30 Minuten mit Zwischenhalten bis zum Hauptbahnhof Kuala Lumpurs fahren. In der zweiten Ebene befinden sind die Zugänge zum \\"Pan Pacific Hotel\\" und dem Parkhaus, welches sich zwischen dem Hauptabfertigungsgebäude und dem Tower befindet. In der dritten Ebene werden alle ankommenden Passagiere abgefertigt, so dass sich hier unter anderem Gepäckausgabebänder, Passkontrolle, Zollkontrolle, Geldwechsler sowie Hotel- und Tourorganisationen befinden. In der vierten Ebene ist hauptsächlich die Gepäckförderanlage untergebracht. In der obersten, der fünften Etage, sind die Einrichtungen für die abfliegenden Passagiere angesiedelt., Man gelangt durch einen der sechs Zugänge von der doppelstöckigen Anfahrtsstraße ins Innere der Halle. Die Anfahrtsstraße ist auf 350Meter Länge überdacht. An der der Zufahrtsstraße gegenüberliegenden Seite gibt es einen Zugang zur Besucherterrasse des Flughafens. In der Halle gibt es sechs parallele Check-In-Inseln mit jeweils 36 Check-in-Schaltern. An den Enden der „Inseln“ befinden sich die Ticketschalter der Fluggesellschaften., Hinter der sich auf der vierten Ebene befindenden Passkontrolle schließt sich ein Verbindungsgebäude an, das in den Contact-Pier mündet. Dort kann man geradeaus zu der Aerotrain-Station gehen und einen Zug zum Satelliten-Abfertigungsgebäude nehmen oder zu den Flugsteigen im Contact-Pier gehen, in dem es Flugsteige in der vierten Ebene für internationale Flüge und Flugsteige in der darunterliegenden Ebene für nationale Flüge gibt., Ankommende Fluggäste internationaler Flüge gelangen durch das zentrale Verbindungsgebäude ins Hauptabfertigungsgebäude. Hinter der Passkontrolle gibt es in einer weitläufigen Halle zehn Gepäckausgabebänder. Um in den öffentlich zugänglichen Bereich zu kommen, muss die Zollkontrolle durchlaufen werden. Ankommende Passagiere von Inlandsflügen gelangen direkt aus der dritten Ebene des Piergebäudes über das dezentrale Verbindungsgebäude in die Gepäckausgabehalle (national) mit ihren zwei Gepäckausgabebändern, ohne eine Passkontrolle zu durchlaufen., \\"Siehe auch: Abläufe der Passagierabfertigung\\", Pierabfertigungsgebäude (Contact Pier)., Der \\"Contact-Pier\\" ist ein länglicher Gebäudeschlauch, an welchem auf beiden Seiten Flugzeuge an den Fluggastbrücken andocken können. Im Contact-Pier gibt es drei Ebenen. Um die Aerotrain-Station unterzubringen, ist der Contact-Pier in der Mitte etwa zweimal breiter als der Rest des Gebäudes., In der obersten Ebene befinden sich die Aerotrain-Station und die Flugsteige für internationale Flüge, in der darunter liegenden dritten Ebene die Flugsteige für nationale Flüge, in der zweiten Ebene, die sich auf Vorfeldhöhe befindet, sind Warteräume/Flugsteige für Flüge untergebracht, f: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Bauwerk, Selangor, 1990er Jahre, Flughafen, Asien, Malaysia, Verkehr, Kuala Lumpur, Sepang, Selangor"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Albrecht von Preußen (1809–1872), Familienmitglied des Hauses Mecklenburg (Linie Strelitz), Frau, Friedrich Wilhelm III. (Preußen), Geboren 1776, Gestorben 1810, Herzog zu Mecklenburg, Hohenzoller (Linie Brandenburg-Preußen), Kurfürstin (Brandenburg), Königin (Königreich Preußen)], Luise Herzogin zu Mecklenburg[-Strelitz], bekannt als Königin Luise, vollständiger Name: \\"Luise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie Herzogin zu Mecklenburg\\" (*10.März1776 in Hannover; † 19. Juli 1810 auf Schloss Hohenzieritz), war die Gemahlin König Friedrich WilhelmsIII. von Preußen., Zeitgenossen beschrieben sie als schön und anmutig, ihre ungezwungenen Umgangsformen erschienen ihnen eher bürgerlich als aristokratisch. Ihr Leben war eng verknüpft mit den dramatischen Ereignissen im Kampf Preußens gegen Napoleon Bonaparte. Da sie früh starb, blieb sie auch in der Vorstellung der nachfolgenden Generationen jung und schön. Schon zu Lebzeiten wurde sie zum Gegenstand beinahe kultischer Verehrung. Nach ihrem Tod setzte sich diese Tendenz verstärkt fort. Sie wurde als Mutter Kaiser Wilhelms I. zum Symbol für den Wiederaufstieg Preußens und für die Entwicklung hin zum Deutschen Kaiserreich. So liegt ihre historische Bedeutung in der legendären Berühmtheit, die sie als Königin von Preußen tatsächlich hatte., Leben., Elternhaus und Kindheit., Luises Familienhintergrund war das Ergebnis von Zweckverbindungen des Hochadels über die Grenzen der deutschen Kleinstaaten hinweg. Ihr Vater Herzog Karl zu Mecklenburg[-Strelitz] war ein nachgeborener Prinz aus dem Hause der Herzöge von Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Nach Studium in Genf und einigen Reisen hatte er die repräsentative und gut bezahlte Aufgabe übernommen, das Kurfürstentum Hannover als Gouverneur für seinen Schwager, den britischen König GeorgIII., zu verwalten. Dieser war zwar in Großbritannien geboren, stammte aber aus dem Haus Hannover und ließ sein deutsches Stammland von London aus regieren., 1768 heiratete Karl in Hannover die 16-jährige Prinzessin Friederike von Hessen-Darmstadt. Fünf ihrer zehn Kinder starben früh, sie selbst überlebte die letzte Niederkunft nur um zwei Tage. Als sie im Alter von 29 Jahren starb, war ihre Tochter Luise, Prinzessin von Mecklenburg-Strelitz, erst sechs Jahre alt. Der Witwer heiratete die jüngere Schwester der Verstorbenen – Luise erhielt also ihre Tante zur Stiefmutter –, die aber nach nur 15 Monaten ebenfalls im Kindbett starb, nachdem sie ihren Sohn Karl zur Welt gebracht hatte., Wenig später wurden die sechs Kinder getrennt. Die beiden Söhne, Georg und Karl, blieben bei ihrem Vater in Hannover. Charlotte, die älteste der vier Töchter, war seit 1785 mit dem Regenten des kleinen Herzogtums Sachsen-Hildburghausen verheiratet. Die Schwestern Therese, Luise und Friederike wurden 1786 ihrer Großmutter in Darmstadt zur weiteren Erziehung anvertraut. Diese Großmutter war die Witwe des Bruders des regierenden Landgrafen von Hessen-Darmstadt und wurde nach dem Vornamen ihres verstorbenen Gatten volkstümlich „Prinzessin George“ genannt. Sie war eine resolute, kluge alte Dame, die ihren drei Enkelinnen im Alten Palais der kleinen Residenzstadt Darmstadt manche Freiheiten ließ., Luise, als Kind mit Beinamen wie „Jungfer Husch“ und „unsre tolle Luise“ bedacht, war noch als Jugendliche kindlich unbefangen und verspielt. Der Stadtpfarrer von Darmstadt gab den drei Schwestern Konfirmandenunterricht. Für die unumgängliche Ausbildung in der französischen Sprache und in höfischer Etikette sorgte Mademoiselle Salomé de Gélieu, die zuvor im damals preußischen Neuchâtel ein Mädchenpensionat geleitet und in England als Erzieherin in aristokratischen Familien gearbeitet hatte. Zusätzlich erhielten die Prinzessinnen Unterricht in Englisch, Geschichte und Deutsch sowie im Zeichnen und Malen und im Klavierspiel., Luise war keine eifrige Schülerin. Ihre französisch geschriebenen Briefe blieben lebenslang fehlerhaft und erst viel später, in Berlin, ging sie daran, einige der größten Bildungslücken zu schließen. Dort ließ sie sich über Geschichte und Philosophie informieren und bat Freundinnen wie Marie von Kleist und Karoline von Berg, sie bei der Auswahl ihrer Lektüre zu unterstützen. Frau von Berg (1760–1826), ihre Hofdame, Mentorin und Vertraute, führte einen literarischen Salon in ihrer Villa am Berliner Tiergarten und korrespondierte mit Berühmtheiten wie Goethe, Herder, Jean Paul und dem Reichsfreiherrn vom und zum Stein. Von ihr erhielt Luise Hinweise zur zeitgenössischen Literatur, von ihr erbat sie Texte „von denen Sie annehmen, daß sie mir gefallen und mir am meisten nützen“. In einem Brief an Marie von Kleist, die Cousine des Dichters Heinrich von Kleist, werden ihre literarischen Neigungen deutlich: „Möge Gott mich davor bewahren, meinen Geist zu pflegen und mein Herz zu vernachlässigen“; sie würde eher „alle Bücher in die Havel werfen“, als den Verstand über das Gefühl zu stellen., Das Leben der Prinzessinnen in Darmstadt wurde unterbrochen durch häufige Besuche bei den zahlreichen Verwandten aus hessischen und mecklenburgischen Adelshäusern, durch Reisen nach Straßburg und in die Niederlande. Oft hielt man sich in Frankfurt am Main auf, wo die ältere Schwester Therese seit 1787 mit dem damals noch nicht ganz standesgemäßen, aber sehr reichen späteren Fürsten Karl Alexander von Thurn und Taxis verheiratet war. Mehrmals machten die 14-jährige Luise und ihre jüngere Schwester Friederike Besuche im Hause der Frau Rat Catharina Elisabeth Goethe, der Mutter des berühmten Dichters; Jahre später schrieb diese ihrem Sohn darüber nach Weimar: „Das Zusammentreffen mit der Prinzessin von Mecklenburg hat mich außerordentlich gefreut … von einer steifen Hofetikette waren sie da in voller Freyheit – tantzend – sangen und sprangen den gantzen Tag …“ In Frankfurt war man auch 1792 anlässlich der Krönungsfeierlichkeiten für FranzII., den letzten Kaiser des Heiligen Römischen Reiches, der 1804 als FranzI. erster Kaiser Österreichs wurde. Den Festball in der Botschaft Österreichs eröffnete Luise gemeinsam mit dem jungen Reichsgrafen Klemens von Metternich, dem später berühmten Diplomaten und Staatsmann., Anfang März 1793 wurden die beiden Schwestern, jetzt 17 und 15 Jahre alt, in Frankfurt dem preußischen König Friedrich WilhelmII. vorgestellt, der brieflich über diese Begegnung berichtete: „Wie ich die beiden Engel zum ersten Mal sah, es war am Eingang der Komödie, so war ich so frappirt von ihrer Schönheit, daß ich ganz außer mir war, als die Großmutter sie mir präsentirte. Ich wünschte sehr, daß meine Söhne sie sehen möchten und sich in sie verlieben […] Ich machte mein möglichstes, daß sie sich öfter sahen und sich recht kennen lernten. […] Sie gaben sich das Jawort und die Versprechung wird bald vor sich gehen, vermuthlich in Mannheim. Der älteste heirathet die älteste und der jüngste die jüngste.“ Zum ersten Mal traf Luise den „ältesten“, den 22-jährigen Kronprinzen Friedrich Wilhelm am 14. März 1793, am 19. März machte er seinen persönlichen Heiratsantrag und am 24. April fand in Darmstadt die offizielle Verlobung statt. Im Ehevertrag wurde festgehalten, dass Luise eine bestimmte Summe „zu selbsteigener Disposition“ erhalten sollte, die sich bei der Geburt eines Sohnes deutlich erhöhen würde; für eine Tochter war nichts dergleichen vorgesehen. Inzwischen war auch Prinz Louis, der „jüngste“, mit Luises Schwester Friederike verlobt, widerwillig allerdings und nur aus Gründen der Staatsräson – er war schon anderweitig, aber unter seinem Stand verliebt. Die Doppelhochzeit wurde für die Weihnachtstage 1793 vereinbart., Die Kronprinzessin., Am 22. Dezember trafen die Schwestern in der festlich geschmückten Stadt Berlin ein. Ein kleines, weißgekleidetes Mädchen begrüßte die Prinzessinnen mit einem Gedicht, Luise hob das Kind hoch, küsste es – und reagierte erkennbar verständnislos, als man ihr sagte, dass ein solches Verhalten ihrer hohen Stellung nicht angemessen sei. Dieser Vorfall, vielfach weitererzählt, gab den ersten Anstoß zur außerordentlichen Beliebtheit Luises bei der Berliner Bevölkerung. Am 24.Dezember 1793 wurde sie mit dem Kronprinzen nach altem Hofzeremoniell im Weißen Saal des Berliner Schlosses getraut. Nach Berichten von Augenzeugen wirkte der Bräutigam, sonst eher schüchtern und introvertiert, an diesem Tag heiter und ausgelassen. Zwei Tage später heirateten Friederike und Prinz Louis., Die Paare bezogen zwei benachbarte Gebäude an der Straße Unter den Linden, das Kronprinzenpalais und das später so genannte Prinzessinnenpalais. Hier entstand 1795 die berühmte „Prinzessinnengruppe“ des Bildhauers Gottfried Schadow, von König Friedrich WilhelmII. in Auftrag gegeben. Der Künstler hatte vorübergehend einen Arbeitsraum im Kronprinzenpalais, sah die Schwestern häufig und durfte sogar „nach der Natur“ ihre Maße nehmen. Luises Mann, der Kronprinz, war allerdings mit der natürlichen, trotz reichlichen Faltenwurfs recht körperbetonten Darstellung unzufrieden. Zudem wurde die inzwischen verwitwete Friederike noch im Trauerjahr schwanger, wurde deswegen „in höchster Eile“ verheiratet und musste den Hof und Berlin verlassen. Als Luise Königin geworden war, verschwand die Skulptur daher für Jahrzehnte aus der Öffentlichkeit. Sie ist heute auf der Museumsinsel in Berlin zu sehen., Das Leben am preußischen Hof verlangte von Luise ein hohes Maß an Anpassung an unbekannte Personen, Regeln und Pflichten. Ihr ungezwungenes Naturell stand dabei manches Mal im Wege. Als Oberhofmeisterin wurde ihr eine erfahrene Hofdame zur Seite gestellt, die Gräfin Sophie Marie von Voß. Sie war 64 Jahre alt, als Luise in Berlin eintraf, und stand seit Jahrzehnten im Dienste des Königshauses. Nach anfänglichen Konflikten zwischen ihrer strengen Berufsauffassung und Luises Neigung zu unkonventionellem Verhalten war sie der Kronprinzessin und späteren Königin eine unentbehrliche Lehrmeisterin in höfischer Etikette und blieb ihr bis zuletzt eine vertraute Ratgeberin und Freundin. Zu einer weiteren Vertrauten wurde ihre Erste Hofdame, die unverheiratete Henriette von Viereck (1766–1854), die als junge Frau einst zu den Favoritinnen Friedrich Wilhelms II. gezählt hatte und 1834 zur Gräfin erhoben werden sollte., Hilfreich für Luises Eingewöhnung in die neue Situation war, dass Friedrich Wilhelm im privaten Bereich jede Art von hergebrachter Förmlichkeit ablehnte. Das Paar pflegte einfache, in diesen Kreisen ungewöhnliche Umgangsformen.

Durch die Auswirkungen der COVID-19-Pandemie sowie die weltweiten Reiserestriktionen verzeichnete der Flughafen München 2020 erhebliche Verkehrseinbrüche und das Passagieraufkommen sank um über 75 Prozent auf rund 11,1 Millionen Fluggäste., Betreiber ist die Flughafen München GmbH mit dem Freistaat Bayern (51 %), der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, vertreten durch das Bundesministerium für Digitales und Verkehr (26 %), und der Landeshauptstadt München (23 %) als Gesellschafter., Insbesondere für die Lufthansa und ihre Partner in der Star Alliance ist der Flughafen ein wichtiger Zentralknoten., Der Flughafen München ersetzte mit der Inbetriebnahme 1992 den Flughafen München-Riem., Lage., Der Flughafen liegt circa 28,5km nordöstlich von München im Erdinger Moos in unmittelbarer Nähe der Stadt Freising., /48.3555/11.7970 Er befindet sich 448 Meter über Normalhöhennull (NHN)., Der Flughafen verfügt über eine Gesamtfläche von 1618 ha. Mit 49 Prozent gehört der geringfügig kleinere Teil der Flughafenfläche zum Landkreis Erding (Gemeinde Oberding), während der westliche, geringfügig größere Teil auf drei Gemeinden im Landkreis Freising entfällt: Der Südwesten gehört zur Gemeinde Hallbergmoos, und der Nordwesten mit dem Besucherpark zur Stadt Freising. Ein sehr kleiner Teil an der Nordgrenze mit rund 2,8ha gehört zur Gemeinde Marzling. Die geplante dritte Start- und Landebahn soll in einem Abstand von 1180 Metern nordöstlich zum bestehenden Bahnsystem gebaut werden. Dadurch würde das Flughafenareal um rund 870 Hektar erweitert, 500 Hektar davon sind als Grünfläche geplant., Das Erdinger Moos war vor dem Bau des Flughafens relativ dünn besiedelt. Dennoch mussten einige Bewohner umgesiedelt werden, insbesondere um Platz für die Start- und Landebahnen zu schaffen. Die meisten, nämlich 400 Einwohner, zählten zur aufgegebenen Streusiedlung Franzheim., Den Straßen im Ort „München-Flughafen“ ist die Freisinger Postleitzahl 85356 zugewiesen; Postfächer tragen Postleitzahlen im Bereich von 85324 bis 85336. Die Telefonvorwahl ist 089. Ortsschilder tragen den Namen „Flughafen München“., Zuständiges Gericht ist das Amtsgericht Erding, insbesondere auch für Streitigkeiten in Bezug auf Fluggastrechte, soweit diese in den sachlichen Zuständigkeitsbereich der Amtsgerichte fallen. Die nächsthöhere Instanz ist das Landgericht Landshut., Die Fahrzeit vom Stadtzentrum München zum Flughafen mit dem Auto oder der S-Bahn beträgt etwa 45 Minuten., Verkehrsanbindung., Individualverkehr., Für den Individualverkehr ist der Flughafen München über die \\"Autobahn\\" A92 München-Deggendorf an das \\"Bundesfernstraßennetz\\" angeschlossen. Die östliche Anbindung besteht im Wesentlichen aus der kreuzungsfreien Staatsstraße St 2580, der Flughafentangente Ost. Die Bundesstraße 301 wurde zwischen Ismaning und dem Flughafen ebenfalls kreuzungsfrei ausgebaut und bietet in Verbindung mit einem kurzen Abschnitt auf der Bundesstraße 471 ab der Ausfahrt Aschheim/Ismaning der A99 eine alternative Anfahrtsmöglichkeit aus dem Süden., Taxistandplätze sind vor Terminal 1 an jedem Modul sowie am Ausgang von Terminal 2, am Audi Forum und am Hilton Munich Airport eingerichtet., Ein durchgängiger Fuß- und Radweg führt von Freising aus über den Besucherpark zum Terminal. In unmittelbarer Nähe zum Terminal1 befinden sich vor Witterung geschützte Fahrradständer. Auch der Isar-Radweg kann vom Flughafen leicht erreicht werden., Die Lufthansa bot unter dem Namen \\"Lufthansa Express Helikopter\\" einen Flughafentransfer via Hubschrauber in einem Umkreis von maximal 500km um den Flughafen an., 2015 wurde der Zubringerdienst unter der Marke \\"Lufthansa Express\\" mit anderen Shuttle-Angeboten des Unternehmens kombiniert, die Flugreisende unter anderem auch mit einem Limousinen-Service an das Umland des Flughafens anbinden., Öffentlicher Personennahverkehr., Straßenpersonennahverkehr., Zahlreiche Linienbus-Verbindungen stehen im Straßenpersonennahverkehr in die Flughafen-Region zur Verfügung. So ist er mit Verbindungen in die Landkreise Freising und Erding in den Regionalverkehr Oberbayern eingebunden. Durch die MVV-Linie 635 ist er Teil des Stadtbussystems von Freising. Des Weiteren sind die Städte Landshut und Moosburg an der Isar an den Flughafen angebunden. Weitere Verbindungen bestehen zur Messe München, nach Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm, Taufkirchen (Vils) und Wartenberg., Der alle fünfzehn Minuten verkehrende \\"Lufthansa Express Bus\\" stellt eine alternative Busverbindung zum Münchner Hauptbahnhof mit Zwischenhalt am Nordfriedhof dar., Schienenpersonennahverkehr., Mit den beiden S-Bahn-Linien S1 und S8 ist der Flughafen München im Schienenpersonennahverkehr an das Münchner S-Bahn-Netz angeschlossen. Tagsüber fahren die Züge beider Linien jeweils alle 20 Minuten. Die beiden Linien führen östlich bzw. westlich der Isar über die Bahnstrecke München Ost–München Flughafen und die Bahnstrecke München–Regensburg nach München. Auf der S-Bahn-Stammstrecke zwischen Laim und Ostbahnhof begegnen sie sich. Da in diesem Bereich beide Linien in entgegengesetzter Richtung zum Flughafen fahren, ergibt sich nur am Hauptbahnhof und am Ostbahnhof ein Zehn-Minuten-Takt zum Flughafen. Nachts ist der Takt ausgedünnt. Die Reisezeit zum Münchner Hauptbahnhof beträgt mit der S1 46 Minuten, mit der S8 42 Minuten, in der Gegenrichtung 43 und 40 Minuten., Eine Kombination aus Regional- und Fernverkehr mit dem Namen \\"Überregionaler Flughafenexpress\\" (ÜFEX) von DB Regio Bayern verbindet den Flughafen im Stundentakt über Freising, Moosburg und Landshut mit Regensburg. Die Fahrtzeit zwischen Regensburg und Flughafen beträgt circa 75, zwischen Landshut und Flughafen circa 30 Minuten. Der erste Zug startet in Regensburg um 03:18 Uhr, der letzte Zug in Gegenrichtung am Flughafen um 00:28 Uhr., Die MVV-Linie 635 verknüpft den Flughafen zusätzlich dreimal pro Stunde mit dem Freisinger Bahnhof. Dort halten Nahverkehrszüge nach Nürnberg und Passau sowie der alex mit Verbindungen nach Weiden, Hof und Pilsen und Prag., Fernverkehr., Der Flughafen ist derzeit nur durch den Fernbusverkehr überregional direkt erreichbar. Die Haltestelle für Fernbusse befindet sich nördlich der Haupthalle des Terminals 2 in unmittelbarer Nähe zum Munich Airport Center. Die Fahrt mit dem Fernbus kann teilweise im Buchungsverfahren des Flugtickets direkt gekauft werden, wodurch im Falle einer Verspätung des Busses ein Anspruch auf Ersatz für den eventuell verpassten Flug gewährleistet werden kann, so entsprechende Kooperationen geschlossen wurden. Das Fehlen eines Fernbahn-Anschlusses sehen Beobachter als strategischen Nachteil gegenüber dem Drehkreuz Frankfurt, wenn einmal innerdeutsche Flüge eingeschränkt werden sollten., Im Juli 2022 wurden „Ideenskizzen“ der Deutschen Bahn bekannt, die eine Anbindung des Münchner Flughafens an eine neu zu errichtende Schnellfahrstrecke München–Ingolstadt, die Errichtung eines ICE-tauglichen Fernbahnhofs und dessen Bedienung mit ICEs mindestens im 30-Minuten-Takt vorsehen. Die Fahrzeit nach München würde 15 Minuten und nach Ingolstadt 25 Minuten betragen. Wie im Februar 2023 bekannt wurde, lehne die Bundesregierung eine solche Strecke ab, da sie nicht im Bundesverkehrswegeplan bzw. Deutschlandtakt enthalten sei. Eine deutlich veränderte Verkehrsstruktur sei durch eine Neubaustrecke nicht zu erwarten. Bei zukünftigen Fortschreibungen des Bundesverkehrswegeplans könne ein solches Vorhaben gleichwohl geprüft werden., Geschichte., Anfänge der Luftfahrt in München., Luftfahrtgeschichte in München wurde zum Oktoberfest 1820 geschrieben, als sich Wilhelmine Reichard am 1. Oktober 1820 auf der Theresienwiese mit Hilfe eines Gasballons in die Luft erhob. Auf dem westlich von München gelegenen Flugplatz in Puchheim unternahmen Luftfahrtpioniere bereits um das Jahr 1910 erste Flugversuche. Die Flugvorführungen waghalsiger Piloten lockten Tausende von Zuschauern nach Puchheim. Die Luftschiffer der Königlich Bayerischen Armee nutzten das Gelände des Oberwiesenfelds für Ballonaufstiege und -landungen. Am 2. April 1909 landete auf dem Oberwiesenfeld das erste Luftschiff des Grafen Zeppelin, das „Reichsmilitärluftschiff S.M. Zeppelin I“, das erfolgreich seine erste „Fernfahrt“ vom Bodensee absolviert hatte. Am 1. Januar 1912 wurde hier die Königlich Bayerische Fliegertruppe gegründet, die aber bereits am 1. April desselben Jahres nach Oberschleißheim verlegt wurde. In Oberschleißheim entstand im Mai 1913 der erste Fliegerhorst Bayerns. Heute gilt Oberschleißheim mit der historischen Flugwerft Schleißheim als das älteste erhaltene Flugplatzgelände Deutschlands. Oberschleißheim wird als Sonderlandeplatz genutzt und beherbergt einen Teil der Luftfahrtsammlung des Deutschen Museums., Flughafen Oberwiesenfeld, Beginn des zivilen Luftverkehrs., Die Geburtsstunde des Passagierverkehrs auf dem Oberwiesenfeld fiel in das Jahr 1919. Der Konstanzer Flugpionier Ernst Schlegel hatte mit sechs alten Militär-Doppeldeckern einen Flugpassagier-Dienst zwischen Konstanz, Stuttgart, Berlin, Freiburg, München und Friedrichshafen mit Anschluss an den Zeppelinverkehr organisiert. 1919 richtete auch die Rumpler Luftverkehrs AG mit umgebauten Militärmaschinen ihren planmäßigen Flugdienst auf den Strecken München – Augsburg sowie München – Nürnberg – Leipzig – Berlin ein. Als zweite in München operierende Fluggesellschaft eröffnete der Bayerische Luft-Lloyd 1921 die Verbindung München– Konstanz, die anfangs von Schleißheim aus bedient wurde. Vom Oberwiesenfeld starteten Luftverkehrspassagiere außerdem zu sogenannten „Erholungs- und Gesellschaftsflügen“ in die bayerischen Berge und Seengebiete, der Eröffnungsflug fand am 24. Juni 1919 mit einer Rumpler C I statt. Am 20. Oktober 1920 wurde der \\"Rumpler Post- und Passagier-Luftdienst\\" auf der Strecke nach Wien aufgenommen, allerdings wurden die Flugzeuge dort von der Entente-Kommission wegen nicht: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Bauwerk Hallbergmoos, Bauwerk Oberding, 1990er Jahre, Flughafen Deutschland, Flughafen Europa, Flugplatz Bayern, Franz Josef Strauß, Luftverkehr München, Marzling, Verkehrsbauwerk Landkreis Erding"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Gemeinde in Vorarlberg, Lustenau, Marktgemeinde in Vorarlberg, Ort am Alpenrhein, Ort im Bezirk Dornbirn, Ort im Vorarlberger Rheintal], Lustenau ist mit Einwohnern (Stand ) die einwohnerreichste Marktgemeinde Österreichs und liegt im Westen des Bundeslandes Vorarlberg., Bis 1806 war Lustenau ein freier Reichshof des Heiligen Römischen Reichs. Erst 1830 kam Lustenau endgültig zu Österreich. Die bis ins 19.Jahrhundert agrarisch geprägte Gemeinde wurde im 20.Jahrhundert zu einem Zentrum der Vorarlberger Stickereiindustrie und ist heute eine wichtige Grenzgemeinde zur Schweiz und Industriestandort. Im übrigen Vorarlberg ist der Ort insbesondere für den markanten Dialekt seiner Bewohner und das große Kirchweihfest, die „Kilbi“, bekannt. Im sportlichen Bereich wird der Name Lustenau vor allem mit erfolgreichen Fußball- und Eishockeymannschaften in Verbindung gebracht., Geografie., Geografische Lage., Lustenau liegt am östlichen Ufer des Alpenrheins, im unteren Vorarlberger Rheintal, 4km südlich des Bodenseeufers. Das Ortszentrum befindet sich auf Das Gemeindegebiet liegt vollständig in der Ebene westlich des Bregenzerwaldgebirges, es gibt keine bedeutenden natürlichen Erhöhungen., Ausdehnung des Gemeindegebiets., Von Norden nach Süden erstreckt sich das Gemeindegebiet über circa 8,5km, von Westen nach Osten über ungefähr 4km. Im Westen wird Lustenau vom Rhein begrenzt, im Nordosten von der Dornbirner Ach und im Osten vom Vorarlberger Rheintalbinnenkanal und vom Dornbirner Landgraben., Gliederung der Gemeinde., Ursprünglich bestand der Reichshof Lustenau aus den sieben Ortschaften Stalden, Holz, Wiesenrain, Grindel, Weiler, Rheindorf und Hag, die jedoch im 20.Jahrhundert durch die zunehmende Zersiedelung zusammenwuchsen und mittlerweile nicht mehr klar abgrenzbar sind. Heute wird Lustenau analog zu den Pfarrgemeinden meist in Rheindorf, Kirchdorf und Hasenfeld eingeteilt. Dabei handelt es sich weder um Katastralgemeinden noch um Gemeindebezirke im rechtlichen Sinne., Geologie., Das Alpenrheintal ist eine für die Alpen untypische, mit jungem Lockergestein gefüllte Felswanne, die im Bereich des Lustenauer Gemeindegebiets 600Meter tief ist., Vor 4000 Jahren reichte der Bodensee bis nach Lustenau. Durch Ablagerungen aus dem Rhein und seinen Zuflüssen verlandete das Gebiet zuerst hauptsächlich im Bereich der Flussrinne, während seitlich davon flache, ausgedehnte Seen entstanden. In ihnen bildete sich aus feinkörnigen Schwebstoffen des Rheins ein Untergrund aus wasserstauendem Ton. Durch eine intensiv wachsende Sumpfvegetation entwickelten sich diese Restseen schließlich zu Torfmooren. Einige der Seen sind auf Landkarten des 19.Jahrhunderts noch eingezeichnet, auch Flurnamen wie „Seelache“ oder „Vorsee“ erinnern an diese inzwischen verschwundene Landschaft., Der Verlandungskörper in Lustenau besteht entlang des Rheins aus lehmigem Feinsand, in der Gemeindemitte aus Lehm und an den östlichen Gemeindegrenzen aus Torf., Naturschutzgebiete und Naturdenkmäler., Das Naturschutz- und Natura-2000-Gebiet Gsieg – Obere Mähder im Süden der Gemeinde umfasst einen der größten und botanisch reichhaltigsten Streuwiesenkomplexe im gesamten Rheintal. Das 73Hektar große Areal beherbergt unter anderem 502 Schmetterlings-, 429 Käfer- und 42 Libellenarten, ein Drittel aller in Vorarlberg vorkommenden Orchideenarten, 350 verschiedene Blütenpflanzen und Gräser sowie 6 österreichweit gefährdete Vogelarten und mehrere weitere vom Aussterben bedrohte Tiere und Pflanzen., Ein Teil des \\"Schweizer Rieds\\" im Norden Lustenaus ist mit nahegelegenen Gebieten der angrenzenden Gemeinden zum Natura-2000-Gebiet Soren, Gleggen – Köblern, Schweizer Ried und Birken – Schwarzes Zeug zusammengefasst. Die Moorlandschaft hat eine besondere Bedeutung für Wiesenbrüter., Eine Silberweide, eine Winterlinde und eine Stieleiche im Gemeindegebiet Lustenaus sind aufgrund ihres hohen Alters als Naturdenkmal ausgewiesen und stehen daher unter besonderem Schutz., Geschichte., Der Königs- und Reichshof Lustenau., Ein vom karolingischen Kaiser Karl III. (dem Dicken) in „Lustenoua“ am 24.Juli 887 unterzeichnetes Schriftstück stellt die älteste erhaltene urkundliche Erwähnung des Namens „Lustenau“ dar., Über die Udalrichinger kam der Königshof an die Grafen von Bregenz, nach deren Aussterben zurück ans Reich und später im Pfandweg an die Grafen von Werdenberg. 1334 bestätigte Kaiser LudwigIV. (der Bayer) den Status der Lustenauer als freie Reichsleute und sicherte so die Reichsunmittelbarkeit des Hofes., 1395 verpfändeten die Werdenberger um 5300Pfund Heller die Feste Zwingenstein und den Hof Lustenau an die Ritter von Ems, 1526 wurde der Pfand in einen endgültigen Kauf umgewandelt., Im Jahre 1593 wurde das linksrheinische Widnau-Haslach (das Gebiet der heutigen Gemeinden Widnau, Schmitter und Au) von Lustenau abgeteilt, erhielt aber aufgrund der ungleichen Flächenverteilung auch Grundbesitz auf der rechtsrheinischen Seite zugesprochen, das sogenannte \\"Schweizer Ried\\"., Nach dem Aussterben der männlichen Linie der Hohenemser 1759 entwickelte sich eine jahrzehntelange Auseinandersetzung um die Besitzrechte an Lustenau zwischen Maria Theresia von Österreich auf der einen Seite und der hohenemsischen Erbin Maria Rebekka auf der anderen. 1790 wurde durch einen Staatsvertrag zwischen Österreich und Lustenau die Selbständigkeit des Reichshofes wiederhergestellt., Lustenau als Teil der österreichischen Monarchie., Nach dem Zusammenbruch des Heiligen Römischen Reiches 1806 war Lustenau für einige Tage ein vollkommen selbständiger Staat unter hohenemsischer Herrschaft. Als Bayern, das ja fast das gesamte restliche Vorarlberg beherrschte, auch die Hoheitsrechte in Lustenau beanspruchte, konnte die hohenemsische Erbin Maria Walburga den Verbleib der niederen Gerichtsbarkeit in ihren Händen erreichen. Auch nachdem Vorarlberg 1814 an Österreich zurückgefallen war, blieb die Sonderstellung dieses Patrimonialgerichts aufrecht., Erst mit dem Verzicht des Hauses Hohenems und der feierlichen Übergabe der Gerichtsakten am 22.März 1830 wurde Lustenau endgültig österreichisch., Die im Jahre 1837 endgültig fixierte Aufteilung der Gemeindegründe (Allmende) auf die Einwohner von Lustenau bildete eine Grundlage für ein späteres starkes Wachstum. Den eigentlichen Ausgangspunkt des wirtschaftlichen Aufschwungs markiert aber der Bau eines umfangreichen Netzwerks von Entwässerungskanälen und die Verbesserung der Hochwasserdämme am Rhein in den Jahren 1843 bis 1848 unter der Leitung von Kreisingenieur Martin Kink., Die erste Brücke über den Rhein wurde im Jahre 1867 zwischen der Ortschaft Rheindorf und der Schweizer Gemeinde Au eröffnet. 1872 folgte die Eisenbahnbrücke, 1875 die zweite Straßenbrücke und 1914 die Wiesenrainbrücke., Die Brüder Johann und Josef Hofer stellten 1869 die ersten Plattstich-Handstickmaschinen in Vorarlberg auf. Damit war der Startschuss für die über 100Jahre dauernde Dominanz der Stickereiindustrie in Lustenau gefallen. Die immer noch massive Gefahr von Seiten des Rheins– zuletzt mit drei verheerenden Hochwasserkatastrophen in den Jahren 1888 und 1890 – wurde um die Wende zum 20.Jahrhundert durch die Rheinregulierung gebannt., Am 13. Juni 1902, zu einem Zeitpunkt, als Lustenau nach Dornbirn und Bregenz die drittgrößte Gemeinde Vorarlbergs war, erhob Kaiser Franz Joseph den Ort zur Marktgemeinde. Der Boom der Stickereiindustrie und der gebändigte Rhein führten zu einem massiven Bevölkerungs- und Wirtschaftswachstum in Lustenau, das allerdings durch den Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs jäh gestoppt wurde., Erste Republik und Ständestaat., Nach dem Zerfall der österreichischen Monarchie wurde Lustenau zum Zentrum der Initiative für den Anschluss Vorarlbergs an die Schweiz, die in der Volksabstimmung am 11.Mai 1919 gipfelte, schlussendlich aber an der politischen Realität scheiterte., Die Wirtschaftskrise in den 1930er Jahren bescherte auch in Lustenau den Kommunisten und vor allem den Nationalsozialisten großen Zulauf. Das österreichweite Verbot der KPÖ und der NSDAP im Mai bzw. Juni 1933 verhinderte– zumindest vorläufig– einen weiteren Aufstieg dieser Organisationen, Lustenau blieb aber ein Zentrum des nationalsozialistischen Untergrunds., Die prekäre finanzielle Lage eines Großteils der Bevölkerung spiegelte sich auch in einer Zunahme des Versicherungsbetrugs wider. Nach einer auffälligen Häufung von Bränden in gut versicherten, alten, baufälligen Wohnhäusern setzte die Landesfeuerversicherungsanstalt eine Belohnung für die Ermittlung vorsätzlicher Brandstifter aus., Nationalsozialismus und Zweiter Weltkrieg., Nach dem Anschluss Österreichs an das Deutsche Reich 1938 wurde Lustenau bei öffentlichen Investitionen – beispielsweise bei Entwässerungsprojekten – und staatlichen Zuschüssen stark bevorzugt. Die für die Gemeinde wichtige Stickereiindustrie jedoch kam durch die politische Isolation Deutschlands praktisch vollständig zum Erliegen. Das Münchner Unternehmen C. A. Steinheil &amp; Söhne richtete eine Niederlassung in Lustenau ein, die zwischen 1939 und 1945 hauptsächlich Rüstungsaufträge erledigte und zu einem der größten Arbeitgeber im Ort wurde., Ein organisierter Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus ist in Lustenau nicht nachweisbar. Es ist aber eine Vielzahl von Fällen der individuellen Opposition belegt, die mit Verhaftungen, mit der Einlieferung in ein Konzentrationslager oder gar mit der Todesstrafe geahndet wurden. Die Akteure dieses individuellen Widerstandes waren sowohl Vertreter der katholischen Kirche und Exponenten des ehemaligen Ständestaates als auch sozialdemokratische und kommunistische Arbeiter. Seit November 2018 erinnert ein Denkmal gegenüber des Rathauses an die Opfer der nationalsozialistischen Diktatur., Lustenau blieb von Zerstörungen im Zweiten Weltkrieg weitgehend verschont. Auch der Einmarsch der französischen Truppen verlief ohne Widerstand und somit auch ohne Kampfhandlungen., Lustenau in der Zweiten Republik., Die Stickerei verschaffte Lustenau auch nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg einen wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung. Besonders unter dem langjährigen Bürgermeister Robert Bösch (1960–1982) veränderte die Gemeinde ihr Gesicht maßgeblich. So fiel unter anderem der Bau von drei Volksschulen, einer Hauptschule, einer Handelsakademie, drei Kindergärten, einem Altersheim und einem Sport- und Erholungszentrum mit Parkbad, Eishalle und Tennisplätzen in diese Zeit., Als in den 1980er Jahren die gesamte österreichische Stickereiindustrie einbrach: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Gemeinde Vorarlberg, Lustenau, Marktgemeinde Vorarlberg, Alpenrhein, Bezirk Dornbirn, Vorarlberger Rheintal, Einwohnerreichste Marktgemeinde, Vorarlberger Stickereiindustrie, Grenzgemeinde Schweiz, Industriestandort"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Flugsaurier], Die Flugsaurier (Pterosauria) sind ausgestorbene Reptilien, die etwa gleichzeitig mit den Nichtvogeldinosauriern lebten und wie die Dinosaurier zur Gruppe der Ornithodira innerhalb der Archosauria gehören. Sie waren durch ihre großen, tragflächenartigen Flughäute als erste Wirbeltiere in der Lage, aktiv zu fliegen. Die Vögel und Fledertiere entwickelten ihr Flugvermögen später und jeweils eigenständig., Die frühesten Funde von Flugsauriern reichen zurück bis in die untere Obertrias (Karnium) vor etwa 228 Millionen Jahren. Sie waren auf der Erde präsent bis zum großen Massenaussterben an der Wende von der Kreidezeit zum Paläogen (Kreide-Paläogen-Grenze) vor etwa 66 Millionen Jahren., Bei den Flugsauriern werden zwei Typen unterschieden: Die „Langschwanzflugsaurier (Rhamphorhynchoidea)“, die sich durch einen langen Schwanz und relativ kurze Mittelhandknochen auszeichnen, waren die frühesten Formen und verschwanden im oberen Jura. Die Kurzschwanzflugsaurier (Pterodactyloidea), die keinen oder einen nur sehr kurzen Schwanz und lange Mittelhandknochen besaßen, erschienen im Mittleren Jura und starben zum Ende der Kreidezeit aus. Diese klassische Einteilung wird mittlerweile in der Taxonomie nicht mehr verwendet, da die Kurzschwanzflugsaurier von den Langschwanzflugsauriern abstammen. Die Langschwanzflugsaurier sind daher im Sinne der phylogenetischen Systematik eine paraphyletische Gruppe., Lebensweise., Fortbewegung., Eine wichtige Frage zur Lebensweise stellt sich bezüglich der Flugfähigkeit der Flugsaurier. Dabei wird allgemein davon ausgegangen, dass gerade die kleinen Arten aktiv sehr gut fliegen konnten. Bei den großen Flugsauriern der Kreidezeit handelte es sich demgegenüber wahrscheinlich primär um Segelflieger, die wie die Greifvögel auf den Aufwind angewiesen waren, oder dynamische Gleitflieger, die wie die Albatrosse unterschiedlich schnelle horizontale Winde im Lee von Wellentälern nutzten, um mit möglichst wenig Energieaufwand weite Strecken hinter sich zu bringen. Für einen dynamischen Gleitflug spricht die maritime Lebensweise, da es über dem Meer keine Aufwinde gibt, und die hohe Flügelstreckung vieler Arten. Doch auch diese Tiere mussten zumindest aus dem Wasser heraus in der Lage sein, aktiv zu starten und Höhe zu gewinnen., Gerade aufgrund des hohen Energieaufwandes, der zum Fliegen notwendig ist, geht man heute oft davon aus, dass die Tiere Warmblüter und zu einem großen Teil behaart waren. Dafür spricht auch der Fund des behaarten \\"Sordes pilosus\\" („Behaarter Teufel“) und haarähnliche Abdrücke bei anderen Flugsaurierfossilien aus dem Solnhofener Plattenkalk und dem Posidonienschiefer von Holzmaden. Dem widersprechen die britischen Paläontologen David M. Martill und David Unwin in einer im September 2020 veröffentlichten Studie. Ihrer Ansicht nach waren die Tiere weder behaart noch befiedert, sondern bei den als Haare oder Protofedern interpretierten Strukturen handelt es sich um Fasern aus den Flügelmembranen., Da die Hinterbeine bei den Flugsauriern nur sehr klein ausgebildet waren, stellt sich die Frage, wie die Tiere sich an Land fortbewegen konnten. Zur Beantwortung dieser Frage werden zwei alternative Theorien diskutiert. Nach Ansicht von Kevin Padian und Jeremy Raynor nutzten die Tiere ihre Beine wie die heutigen Vögel und gingen zweibeinig (biped). Die Autoren führen dies darauf zurück, dass die Beine ähnlich gebaut sind wie die der heutigen Vögel und entsprechend wohl auch ähnlich eingesetzt wurden. David Unwin und Peter Wellnhofer gehen stattdessen davon aus, dass die Flugsaurier vierbeinig (quadruped) gingen und ihre Arme dabei einsetzten (wie die heutigen Vampirfledermäuse), wobei der Flügelfinger nach hinten eingeschlagen wurde. Sie nehmen dabei an, dass die Flughäute auch die Hinterbeine mit umfassten. Die letztere Theorie ist die aktuell bevorzugte. Untersuchungen der Beckenstruktur von \\"Anhanguera\\" und \\"Campylognathoides\\" haben gezeigt, dass die Flugsaurier die Hinterbeine nicht senkrecht unter den Körper stellen konnten und besonders die großen Flugsaurier sich nur sehr schwerfällig allein auf den Hinterbeinen fortbewegt haben können., Möglich ist zudem, dass unterschiedliche Arten hier unterschiedliche Lösungen nutzten. So ist es leicht, sich eine der kleineren langschwänzigen Formen auf den Hinterbeinen vorzustellen, jedoch eher schwer bei den großen und größten Formen der ausgehenden Kreidezeit., Ernährung, Lebensraum und Fortpflanzung., Die Flugsaurier waren wahrscheinlich durchweg Jäger und Fleischfresser. Dabei jagten die frühen Langschwanzflugsaurier vor allem nach Wirbellosen, später entwickelte sich eine größere Diversität in der Ernährung, und auch Fischfresser und Jäger von Landwirbeltieren traten auf. \\"Dimorphodon\\" ernährte sich wahrscheinlich von Wirbeltieren, \\"Austriadactylus\\" war auf hartschalige Wirbellose spezialisiert, \\"Coloborhynchus\\" und \\"Rhamphorhynchus\\" waren Fischfresser und \\"Pterodactylus\\" ernährte sich von verschiedenen Wirbellosen. Ein sehr ungewöhnlicher Flugsaurier namens \\"Pterodaustro\\" aus Südamerika hatte sehr lange und extrem dünne Zähne, die eine Reuse darstellten. Er filterte hiermit Meerwasser und ernährte sich von Plankton wie die heutigen Flamingos., Obwohl die meisten Fossilien von Flugsauriern bislang von Lebensräumen an größeren Gewässern stammen, ist es heute unbestritten, dass viele Arten auch im Inland, etwa in Wäldern, Bergen oder sogar Wüsten lebten. Der fehlende Fossilbefund ist auf die sehr schlechten Fossilisierungsbedingungen dieser Lebensräume und die sehr dünnen Knochen der Tiere zurückzuführen., Flugsaurier waren wie alle Archosaurier eierlegende Tiere. Ein im Jahre 2004 publizierter Fund eines fossilen Embryos aus der frühen Kreidezeit vor etwa 121 Millionen Jahren, der aus der Liaoning-Provinz Nordostchinas stammt, belegt dies eindrücklich. Das gefundene Ei war etwas kleiner als ein Hühnerei und enthielt ein gut erhaltenes Skelett, daneben waren auch Eindrücke von Haut- und Flügelgewebe zu erkennen. Die bei dem Tier, das vermutlich kurz vor dem Schlüpfen stand, bereits vorhandene Flügelspanne von 27 Zentimetern wird von den Entdeckern als Hinweis darauf gewertet, dass die Jungtiere wahrscheinlich Frühentwickler waren, die bereits kurz nach dem Schlüpfen fliegen und sich unabhängig von ihren Eltern ernähren konnten., Dass Flugsaurier in Kolonien zusammenlebten, basiert dagegen in erster Linie auf theoretischen Annahmen sowie auf einem Fund in der Atacama-Wüste in Chile, wo auf sehr engem Raum sehr viele Überreste junger Flugsaurier gefunden wurden., Anatomie., Anatomie der Flügel., Das auffälligste Merkmal der Flugsaurier sind die zu großen Schwingen umgestalteten Vorderbeine, die den Tieren sowohl den Gleitflug als auch den aktiven Flug ermöglicht haben. Dabei spannte sich die Flughaut zwischen dem Körper der Tiere und dem Arm mit dem stark verlängerten vierten Finger der Tiere, der dem Ringfinger beim Menschen entspricht, auf. Die anderen drei Finger bildeten Krallen außerhalb der Flughaut, der fünfte Finger fehlte., Die Flügelknochen der Flugsaurier waren in der Regel hohl und sehr dünnwandig. Sie enthielten viele luftgefüllte Bereiche, damit das Gewicht der Knochen nicht zu hoch wurde. Durch Knochenbälkchen wurden vor allem die Enden der größeren Knochen verstärkt. In der Regel werden aus diesem Grunde nur Fragmente der Flügelknochen gefunden, intakte Knochen sind äußerst selten. Die Flügelknochen der beiden Flugsaurierformen unterscheiden sich dabei deutlich., Der Flügel der Langschwanzflugsaurier besteht aus einem recht kurzen Oberarmknochen (Humerus) und einem relativ kurzen Mittelhandknochen. Die vier Fingerknochen sind dagegen recht lang. Die Krallen sitzen ebenfalls an sehr kurzen Mittelhandknochen. Der Unterarm besteht wie bei allen Landwirbeltieren aus zwei Knochen, wobei die Elle (Ulna) etwas länger ist als die Speiche (Radius). Im Querschnitt sind beinahe alle Knochen im Schaftbereich oval, während sie zu den Enden herzförmig werden., Im Gegensatz dazu sind bei den Kurzschwanzflugsauriern sowohl der Oberarm als auch die Elle massiver und länger, die Speiche ist ebenso lang wie die Elle, nur weniger dick. Besonders die Mittelhandknochen sind sehr viel länger als die der früheren Flugsaurierformen, während entsprechend die Finger in Relation zu den anderen Knochen kürzer werden. Auch Kurzschwanzflugsaurier hatten meist vier Fingerknochen. Die Krallen sind sehr gut ausgebildet und enden ebenfalls an verlängerten Mittelhandknochen. Die Knochenwand ist dünner als die der Langschwanzflugsaurier und verdickt sich zum Ende der Knochen. Der Querschnitt ist hohl und dreieckig und wird zum Ende hin oval. Besonders auffällig sind diese Merkmale bei den sehr großen Formen., Die Flügel selbst bestanden aus einer Hautstruktur, die durch eng beieinander liegende Fasern, so genannte Aktinofibrillen, verstärkt wurde und so zum einen für eine Stabilität des Flügels und zum anderen für eine Rissfestigkeit sorgten. Diese Strukturen konnten an den gut erhaltenen Flughäuten einiger Flugsaurier aus der Santana-Formation untersucht werden., Wirbelsäule., Die Wirbelsäule der Flugsaurier unterscheidet sich von den früheren Reptilien deutlich und ist der fliegenden Lebensweise und den damit verbundenen Ansprüchen an das Achsenskelett angepasst. In einigen Bereichen ähnelte sie sehr stark der Wirbelsäule der Vögel (Konvergenz) mit einer ausgeprägten Schulterregion und einer massiven Region im Bereich des Beckens. Der Rücken war nur sehr kurz und erlaubte entsprechend nur wenige Bewegungen, den längsten Bereich stellte die Halswirbelsäule dar, entsprechend sind die meisten Einzelfunde von Wirbeln Halswirbel., Die Halswirbelsäule ist im Vergleich mit anderen Wirbeltieren sehr lang. Der Hals besteht dabei aus acht Wirbeln bei den frühen Flugsauriern, während einige der größeren Spätformen die Anzahl auf sechs reduziert haben. Die beiden ersten Wirbel dieses Abschnitts, der Atlas und der Axis, waren meistens zu einem einzigen Wirbelknochen verschmolzen. Die Knochenwand der Wirbel war dünn, und der Innenraum bestand aus einem schwammigen Knochengebälk mit großen Lufträumen. Halsrippen existierten im Normalfall nicht., Die Brustwirbelsäule bestand aus bis zu zwölf Wirbeln, wobei die meisten Arten weniger besaßen. Die ersten Wirbel waren meist zu einer massiven Schulterstruktur: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Flugsaurier, Pterosauria, Ornithodira, Obertrias, Langschwanzflugsaurier, Kurzschwanzflugsaurier, Flugvermögen, Energieaufwand, Lebensraum, Fortpflanzung, Anatomie."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},_={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},B={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],L={key:0},j={key:1};function W(a,e,d,m,r,s){const g=p("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),n("div",_,[e[3]||(e[3]=n("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(n("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>r.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),n("div",F,[(t(!0),i(y,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(t(),k(g,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),i("div",B,' No results found for "'+h(r.searchQuery)+'".
