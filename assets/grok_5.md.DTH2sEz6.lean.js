However, not all equal angles are necessarily vertical angles. Equal angles can also be corresponding or alternate angles when two lines are parallel and cut by a transversal. Therefore, the statement as presented is incorrect because it implies a one-to-one correspondence that does not exist.    - **Statement B: When two lines are intersected by a third line, corresponding angles are equal.**   - The statement lacks the crucial condition that the two lines must be parallel for the corresponding angles to be equal. When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal. Without the parallel condition, this statement is misleading and incorrect.    - **Statement C: In the same plane, there is only one line perpendicular to a given line passing through a point.**   - This statement is true. Given a line in a plane, and a point either on the line or not, there is exactly one line through that point which is perpendicular to the initial line. This is a fundamental property of Euclidean geometry.    - **Statement D: The complement of an acute angle may be equal to its supplement.**   - By definition, the complement of an angle is what, when added to it, equals 90 degrees. The supplement is what, when added to the angle, equals 180 degrees. For an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), its complement and supplement cannot be equal because the sum of an angle and its complement is always less than the sum of the angle and its supplement.

We use the concept of a spanning tree on the set (V). A spanning tree is a subgraph which includes all the vertices (V) and is a single connected component with no cycles. As (V) satisfies property (b), we can construct a spanning tree on (V). 3. Let us consider this spanning tree. A spanning tree with (|V|) vertices has exactly (|V|-1) edges. Each edge corresponds to two squares that are orthogonally adjacent. 4. Note the degree (deg (v)) of a vertex (v in V) is the number of edges connected to it. By property (a), each square that does not contain a checker must be adjacent to at least one square that does contain a checker, meaning that for each vertex, the sum of available sides minus its degree is non-negative except for the boundary conditions. 5. Let's calculate the number of adjacent empty squares:    [    sum_{v in V} (4 - deg (v)) geq n^2 - |V|    ]    Here, ((4 - deg(v))) represents the number of free sides around a checker-containing square (v). 6.

Specifically, we wish to rewrite ( n! ) as:    [    24 cdot n (n-1)(n-2) cdots 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1    ]    Notice that the product ( 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 ). Hence, we can factor out 24 from ( n! ) as follows:    [    n! = 24 cdot n (n-1) (n-2) cdots 5    ] 3. To find the largest integer ( n ) such that ( n! ) can be expressed as a product of exactly ( n-3 ) consecutive integers, we analyze the expression ( 24 cdot n (n-1) (n-2) cdots 5 ). 4. First consider if ( n = 23 ). We have:    [    23! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots 21 cdot 22 cdot 23    ]    Factoring out 24:    [    23! = 24 cdot 22 cdot 21 cdot 20 cdots 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdots 2 cdot 1     ]    Clearly, the expression after factoring out 24 consists of 20 consecutive integers starting from 4 up to 23. 5. Now if ( n > 23 ), let's say ( n = 24 ). We have:    [    24! = 24 cdot 23 cdot 22 cdots 1    ]    Factoring 24 out:    [    24! = 24 cdot 23 cdot 22 cdots 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdots 1    ]    Here we cannot rewrite ( 24! ) as the product of ( n-3 = 21 ) consecutive natural numbers starting from some number as the factorial exceeds the setup already provided by the constraints. 6. One should verify the intermediate bounds:    If ( n! ) were expressible within the desired form for ( n > 23 ), we require:    [    n! = 24 cdot n (n-1) (n-2) cdots 5 implies (n+1)! neq n (n-1) ... 5 times 4    ]    This shows, beyond ( n = 23 ), it fails to meet the bounding constraints. 7. Thus, when checked sequentially back to ( n = 23 ), the expression holds true. Thus the maximal ( n ) for which ( n! ) can be expressed in form desired is: Conclusion: [  boxed{23} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the constant k so that x^2  (k + 10)x  b = (x  2)(x  4), where b = 8.","output":"To find the constant ( k ), we need to expand the right side of the equation and then compare the coefficients of the corresponding terms on both sides. The given equation is: [ -x^2 - (k + 10)x - b = -(x - 2)(x - 4) ] First, let's expand the right side: [ -(x - 2)(x - 4) = -[x^2 - 4x - 2x + 8] ] [ -(x - 2)(x - 4) = -[x^2 - 6x + 8] ] [ -(x - 2)(x - 4) = -x^2 + 6x - 8 ] Now, we know that ( b = 8 ), so we can substitute ( b ) in the left side of the equation: [ -x^2 - (k + 10)x - 8 = -x^2 + 6x - 8 ] Now, let's compare the coefficients of the corresponding terms on both sides of the equation. The coefficient of ( x ) on the left side is ( -(k + 10) ), and on the right side, it is ( 6 ). So we have: [ -(k + 10) = 6 ] Now, solve for ( k ): [ -k - 10 = 6 ] [ -k = 6 + 10 ] [ -k = 16 ] [ k = -16 ] Therefore, the constant ( k ) is ( boxed{-16}  )."},{"instruction":"Let g(x) be a function defined for all positive real numbers such that g(x) > 0 for all x > 0 and [g(x + y) = sqrt{g(xy) + 3}] for all x > y > 0.

For these values of x and y, [g(2023) = sqrt{g(2023) + 3}.] Let b = g(2023), so the equation becomes b = sqrt{b + 3}. Squaring both sides, we get b^2 = b + 3, leading to b^2 - b - 3 = 0.

As the number of seeds tested increases, the germination rate seems to converge around 0.971. This convergence suggests that with a large number of seeds, the germination rate becomes more consistent and thus a more accurate representation of the true probability of germination under the given conditions. Therefore, considering the largest sample size of 20,000 seeds, which gives a germination rate of 0.971, we can estimate the probability of germination for one seed of this type. Since the question asks for the probability rounded to 0.01, we round 0.971 to the nearest hundredth, which is boxed{0.97}. This approach aligns with the principle that in a large number of repeated experiments, the probability of an event occurring can be estimated by the frequency of its occurrence.

Given that 78% or fewer of the points touch the surface, we can calculate the maximum number of points on the surface as follows: Maximum number of points on the surface = 78% of 69 points = 0.78 * 69 = 53.82 Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 53 points.

The rule of not immediately moving backward means that we cannot make a move (mathrm{N}) and then immediately (mathrm{S}), or (mathrm{E}) and then immediately (mathrm{O}), and vice versa. 2. **Form of the Coordinates:** Notice that the coordinates of the point will always be in the form ((a + bsqrt{2}, c + dsqrt{2})). Since (sqrt{2}) is irrational, the integer parts (a) and (c) are independent of the coefficients (b) and (d). 3. **Simplification to (mathbf{(1,0)}):**    To prove the overall statement, we can simplify by investigating whether we can return to the point ((1, 0)) under the same rules. If we can show this is impossible, it will be sufficient for any point of the form ((a + bsqrt{2}, c + dsqrt{2})).    - At the initial point ((1, 0)), the movements (mathrm{E}) and (mathrm{O}) have no effect since they will lead back to ((1, 0)). Thus, any sequence of moves can be rewritten as an alternating series of (mathrm{N}) and (mathrm{E}) (or their reverses). 4. **Modified Movement Notation:**     Define ( k mathrm{N} ) as the movement (mathrm{N}) repeated (k) times (if (k > 0)) or ( mathrm{S} ) repeated (k) times (if (k < 0)). Similarly, define ( k mathrm{E} ) for (mathrm{E}) and ( k mathrm{O} ).    - A ( k mathrm{N} ) move changes the point from ((x, y)) to ((x, y + 2kx)).    - A ( k mathrm{E} ) move changes the point from ((x, y)) to ((x + 2ky, y)). 5. **Behavior of the Point’s Coordinates Post-Moves:**    - After ( k mathrm{N} ), the point changes from ((x, y)) to ((x, y + 2kx)), and we can note that (|c| > |a|).    - After ( k mathrm{E} ), the point changes from ((x, y)) to ((x + 2ky, y)), and we can note that (|a| > |c|). 6. **Strictly Increasing Distance from Origin:**    - The effect of each of these transformations is to increase the absolute value of the smallest coordinate while the other coordinate remains unchanged. As a result, the distance of the point ((a, c)) from the origin is strictly increasing.    - Since the distance is strictly increasing, it is impossible to return to the origin point ((1, sqrt{2})). # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that it is impossible to return to the starting point under the given rules. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"w many paths are there from point C to point D, if every step must be either up or to the right in a grid of 7 horizontal steps and 3 vertical steps?","output":"1.

If we wish to have a flower bed with the greatest possible surface area, the radius of the circle in meters must be 7. How many meters of wire is available?","output":"To maximize the surface area of the flower bed in the form of a circular sector, we need to use all the available wire to fence off the curved part of the sector and the two radii. The length of the wire will be equal to the length of the arc of the sector plus the lengths of the two radii. The formula for the circumference of a full circle is ( C = 2pi r ), where ( r ) is the radius. Since we have a sector, not a full circle, we need to determine the fraction of the circle that the sector represents. To maximize the area, we would use the entire wire for the perimeter of the sector, which means the sector would be a semicircle (half of a full circle) because any other fraction would result in a smaller area for a given perimeter. The circumference of a semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle plus the diameter (which is twice the radius). So, the length of the wire ( L ) will be: [ L = pi r + 2r ] Given that the radius ( r ) is 7 meters, we can substitute this value into the equation: [ L = pi times 7 + 2 times 7 ] [ L = 7pi + 14 ] Now, we can calculate the length of the wire: [ L = 7 times 3.14159 + 14 ] [ L approx 21.99115 + 14 ] [ L approx 35.99115 ] So, approximately boxed{36}  meters of wire is available to fence off the flower bed."},{"instruction":"Find the number of positive integers n le 1200 such that 14n is a perfect square.","output":"To solve this problem, we must find conditions under which 14n becomes a perfect square.

Given that PAD is an equilateral triangle with side length 8, the side length of the base hexagon is half of that, which is 4. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by the formula frac{s^2sqrt{3}}{4}.

We need to determine who can always win, regardless of the opponent's moves. To find the answer, consider the following strategy for Petya: 1. **First Move by Petya:**    - Petya erases the number 50 and two other numbers whose sum is 100.    - For instance, Petya can erase 1 and 99, since (1 + 99 = 100).    - As a result of the first move, Petya erases (1, 50, 99). 2. **Strategy after the First Move:**    - After this first move, the remaining numbers can be divided into pairs whose sums equal 100.    - The pairs are ((2, 98), (3, 97), (4, 96), ldots, (49, 51)). 3. **Vasya's Moves:**    - Vasya has to erase three numbers on his turn, but:      - He can't erase both numbers in any pair because their sum is 100, meaning he would need a third number which sums to 150 minus 100 = 50 (50 was erased by Petya).      - Thus, Vasya must erase three numbers from different pairs. 4. **Petya’s Response:**    - Whenever Vasya erases numbers from different pairs, Petya can simply erase the remaining numbers of those pairs.    For example:      - If Vasya erases numbers (2, 3, 4) from pairs ((2,98), (3,97), (4,96)), Petya will erase (98, 97, 96)).       - This ensures Petya always completes removing numbers from pairs disturbed by Vasya. 5. **Conclusion:**    - Since the total sum of numbers in three pairs equals 300, and Vasya removes three numbers summing to 150, Petya can always follow by removing the remaining three numbers of those pairs.    - Therefore, Petya will always have a valid move, and Vasya will eventually be unable to make a move first.

Prove that in any (2m+1)-digit number, we can delete one digit so that the resulting 2m-digit number is fair.  Let's proceed by induction on m. 1. **Base Case (m = 1):**      - Consider a 3-digit number abc, where a, b, and c are the digits.     - If we delete the first digit a, we are left with bc. The even-position index in bc is c (position 2).     - If we delete the second digit b, we are left with ac (even-position is now c).     - If we delete the third digit c, we are left with ab (even-position is now b).     - We will check each of the above to see if they result in a fair 2-digit number, namely, if they still result in the number of even digits in even positions being equal to those in odd positions.     - Since the checks cover all potential patterns, the base case is true.     - Thus, for any 3-digit number, we can always delete one digit and maintain a fair configuration. 2. **Inductive Step (Assume true for k = m):**      - Assume that for any (2m + 1)-digit number, it’s possible to remove one digit to form a 2m-digit number that is fair.     - Consider any (2(m+1) + 1)-digit number.     - We need to prove this statement for (2m + 3) digits to form a 2(m+1)-digit fair number. 3. **Transform the (2(m+1) + 1)-digit number:**     - Consider the (2(m+1) + 1)-digit number where we have:     [     d_1 d_2 d_3 ldots d_{2m+2} d_{2m+3}     ] 4. **Application of Inductive Hypothesis:**     - By assumptions, if we remove any one of the first 2m+2 digits, by induction hypothesis, the remaining (2m+1)-digits have a digit that can be removed to result in a fair 2m-digit number.     - Hence, removing any d_i from 1 to 2m+3, similar pattern arguments will work as above, resulting in fair behavior similarly.     - Given these combinations ensure maintaining balance as required, the inductive step also holds.

Through 3(k+1)-3 weighings, determine either the counterfeit group of small coins or identify three suspect groups, including one faulty coin.    - If identified within a group, reduce it further by applying the base-case strategy for the remaining nine coins. 5. **Conclusion**:    - By following the inductive proof, we confirm the counterfeit coin within 3k+1 weighings.    - All scenarios consolidate to ensure either isolating the counterfeit in specified groups or directly identifying the counterfeit coin through balanced iterative steps. **Final Conclusion**: The counterfeit coin can be identified in 3k+1 weighings, as illustrated by the induction and base-case exploration. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"What is the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points of intersection of the circle (x^2 + y^2 = 16) and the ellipse ((x3)^2 + 4y^2 = 36)? textbf{(A)} 10qquadtextbf{(B)} 14qquadtextbf{(C)} 18qquadtextbf{(D)} 20qquadtextbf{(E)} 22","output":"1. **Set up the equations**:    - Circle: (x^2 + y^2 = 16)    - Ellipse: ((x-3)^2 + 4y^2 = 36) 2. **Substitute (y^2) from the circle's equation into the ellipse's equation**:    [    y^2 = 16 - x^2    ]    Substituting into the ellipse's equation:    [    (x-3)^2 + 4(16 - x^2) = 36    ]     3. **Simplify and solve the equation**:    [    (x-3)^2 + 64 - 4x^2 = 36    ]    [    x^2 - 6x + 9 + 64 - 4x^2 = 36    ]    [    -3x^2 - 6x + 37 = 0    ]    Dividing through by -3:    [    x^2 + 2x - 12.33 = 0    ]    Solve for (x) using the quadratic formula:    [    x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 49.32}}{2}    ]    [    x = frac{-2 pm 7.6}{2}    ]    Solutions:    [    x = 2.8 quad text{and} quad x = -4.8    ]     4. **Find corresponding (y) values for each (x)**:    - For (x = 2.8):      [      y^2 = 16 - (2.8)^2 = 7.84 quad Rightarrow quad y = pm sqrt{7.84}      ]    - For (x = -4.8):      [      y^2 = 16 - (-4.8)^2 = 0.04 quad Rightarrow quad y = pm sqrt{0.04}      ] 5. **Calculate the area of the quadrilateral** using the shoelace formula for coordinates ((-4.8, 0.2)), ((-4.8, -0.2)), ((2.8, sqrt{7.84})), and ((2.8, -sqrt{7.84})):    [    text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| (-4.8)(sqrt{7.84}-(-sqrt{7.84})) + (-4.8)(-sqrt{7.84} - 0.2) + 2.8(0.2 - sqrt{7.84}) + 2.8(sqrt{7.84} - (-0.2)) right|    ]    [    text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| -28.8 + 0.96 - 22.176 + 22.176 right|    ]    [    text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 28    ]    [    text{Area} = 14    ] Conclusion with boxed answer: The area of the quadrilateral is 14.

We evaluate f(0) to check if the function could potentially be odd: [fleft(0right) = sin left(cos 0right) + cos left(sin 0right) = sin 1 + 1 neq 0] Since f(0) neq 0, f(x) cannot be an odd function because an odd function must have f(0) = 0. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **Option B: The maximum value of fleft(xright) is greater than sqrt{2}.** To explore the maximum value, we can look at specific values of x. For x=0: [f(0) = sin(cos0) + cos(sin0) = sin1 + 1 > frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + 1 > sqrt{2}] This shows that at least at x=0, f(x) > sqrt{2}, indicating that the maximum value of f(x) is indeed greater than sqrt{2}.

In the interval [0,pi], cos x ranges from -1 to 1, and frac{pi}{2} - |sin x| ranges from frac{pi}{2}-1 to frac{pi}{2}.

The values of these polynomials at any chosen point ( t ) (which Vasya picks each time) are what Petia provides back to Vasya, selecting either ( f(t) ) or ( g(t) ), but without specifying which polynomial's value is given. 2. **Known Lemma**:    We will use a lemma in our proof:    - Lemma: Through any three points ( (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3) ) with distinct x-coordinates, there passes exactly one polynomial graph of ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ). 3. **Applying the Lemma**:    According to the lemma, let's deduce:    - For three distinct points ( (a_i, b_i) ), the quadratic polynomial passing through these points is unique.    - Proof: Due to the properties of polynomials, the unique polynomial that fits through any three distinct points can be explicitly written as:            b_1 frac{(x - a_2)(x - a_3)}{(a_1 - a_2)(a_1 - a_3)} + b_2 frac{(x - a_1)(x - a_3)}{(a_2 - a_1)(a_2 - a_3)} + b_3 frac{(x - a_1)(x - a_2)}{(a_3 - a_1)(a_3 - a_2)}          - We conclude that no two distinct quadratic polynomials can share three points with the same x-values since their difference would then be a quadratic polynomial with three zeros, which is impossible unless the difference is the zero polynomial (the two polynomials are identical). 4. **The Strategy**:    - Let's consider how many queries ( n ) Vasya needs to identify which polynomial Petia has.    - Vasya's strategy will be based on distinct values ( t ) (ensuring no duplicate queries). 5. **Establishing ( n geq 8 )**:    - Assume Petia marks points in response to Vasya's queries.    - After ( 7 ) queries, with each resulting in a marked point, we observe how polynomials pass through these points.    - Given different abscissae for each point, if Vasya fails to distinguish the two polynomials by the eighth point, it means that each polynomial fits into at least four points out of a possible seven points. 6. **Ensuring a Unique Polynomial**:    - By the eighth point, if Vasya makes a good choice of ( t ), all marked points fit one and only one polynomial uniquely.    - Suppose Petia picked points such that after ( 8 ) queries: the data uniquely fit a quadratic polynomial passing through any five of the eight points. Therefore, Vasya requires at least ( n = 8 ) distinct ( t )-values to determine uniquely either ( f(x) ) or ( g(x) ).

Similar transformation applies to sin15^circ which can be written as cos(90^circ - 15^circ) which equals cos75^circ. Therefore,  sin30^circsin75^circ+sin60^circsin15^circ = sin30^circcos15^circ + sin60^circcos75^circ.  2. We can then apply the sum-to-product formulas by noticing that sin A cos B can be transformed into frac{1}{2}[sin(A+B)+sin(A-B)].

Simplifying the sine terms with known angle values, we get frac{1}{2}[sin45^circ+sin15^circ] + frac{1}{2}[sin135^circ+sin(-15^circ)].  4. Recognize that sin(-15^circ) = -sin15^circ and sin135^circ is equivalent to sin45^circ due to symmetry in the unit circle for sine.

We are left with sin45^circ, which is known to be frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Multiplying this by frac{1}{2}, we have frac{1}{2} times frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4}.  However, the step-by-step process above seems to have a mistake.

If it exists, find the range of real numbers m that satisfy the condition; if it does not exist, explain the reason.","output":"To solve the problem, we follow these steps closely aligned with the given solution: 1. **Identify the properties of f(x)**: Since f(x) is an odd function defined on the set of real numbers R, we have f(0) = 0. This is because odd functions satisfy f(-x) = -f(x), and thus f(0) = -f(0), which implies f(0) = 0. 2. **Analyze the given inequality**: Given that f(x) is a decreasing function on R, the inequality f(4m-2mcos theta) + f(2cos^2theta - 4) > f(0) simplifies to f(4m-2mcos theta) - f(4-2cos^2theta) > 0 because f(0) = 0 and the property of odd functions allows us to rewrite f(-x) = -f(x). This implies f(4m-2mcos theta) > f(4-2cos^2theta). 3. **Transform the inequality**: Since f(x) is decreasing, for f(a) > f(b) to hold, it must be that a < b. Therefore, we have 4m-2mcos theta < 4-2cos^2theta. Simplifying this inequality, we get cos^2theta - mcos theta + 2m - 2 < 0. 4. **Change of variable**: Let t = cos theta, with theta in left[-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}right], which implies t in [0, 1]. The inequality becomes t^2 - mt + 2m - 2 < 0 for t in [0, 1]. 5. **Find conditions for m**: For the inequality t^2 - mt + 2m - 2 < 0 to always hold for t in [0, 1], we need both g(0) < 0 and g(1) < 0. Substituting t = 0 and t = 1 into the inequality gives us two conditions:    - g(0) = 2m - 2 < 0    - g(1) = 1 - m + 2m - 2 < 0    Simplifying these conditions, we find that m < 1. 6. **Conclusion**: There exists such an m that satisfies the given condition, and the range of m is (-infty, 1).

Given that the driver's blood alcohol content decreases by 10% per hour, we can model this decrease using the formula: [1 times (1 - 10%)^{x} < 0.2] where x is the number of hours after the driver stops drinking. Simplifying the expression: [0.9^{x} < 0.2] To solve for x, we take the logarithm of both sides: [log(0.9^{x}) < log(0.2)] Using the property of logarithms that allows us to move the exponent in front: [x cdot log(0.9) < log(0.2)] Solving for x involves dividing both sides by log(0.9), which is a negative number, and this reverses the inequality. However, to avoid confusion and directly calculate the value, we express it as: [x > frac{log(0.2)}{log(0.9)}] Let's simplify the fraction: [x > frac{logfrac{1}{5}}{logfrac{9}{10}} = frac{-log5}{log9 - log10} = frac{log1 - log5}{log9 - log10}] [= frac{-log5}{2log3 - 1} = frac{1 - log2}{1 - 2log3}] Calculating the value: [x > frac{1 - log2}{1 - 2log3} approx 15.2] Since x represents hours and must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 15.2 is 16.

First, we consider the case when ( n = 1 ):    [    f'(x) = f(x+1) - f(x)    ]    This implies that the derivative of ( f ) at ( x ) is equal to the difference between ( f(x+1) ) and ( f(x) ). 3.

The vertex of the parabola, given by the x-coordinate frac{-b}{2a}, must be greater than 3:  frac{3m+2}{2} > 3.  3.

Now we solve for (x, y, z) using the individual products:    [    yz = 12 implies z = frac{12}{y}    ]    [    zx = 24 implies x = frac{24}{z}    ]    [    xy = 18 implies y = frac{18}{x}    ] 8. Substitute (z = frac{12}{y}) into (x = frac{24}{z}):    [    x = frac{24}{frac{12}{y}} = frac{24y}{12} = 2y    ] 9. Substitute (x = 2y) into (y = frac{18}{x}):    [    y = frac{18}{2y} implies y^2 = 9 implies y = 3    ] 10. Using (y = 3), find (z) and (x):     [     z = frac{12}{y} = frac{12}{3} = 4     ]     [     x = 2y = 2 cdot 3 = 6     ] 11. Therefore, (x + y + z = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13).

For any line e in E(H), the reflection of e through C results in another line in E(H).    - Parallel lines through C need special handling. If a point P in H is not on line PC, reflect H across P to form H^*. The combined set H_P = H cup H^* will address the requirement for the parallel lines. 4. **Reflections and Combined Set:**    - Take a point P different from C and reflect H through P to get H^*. Any line PQ with Q in H will have a parallel counterpart PQ_1, where Q_1 is the reflection of Q through C.    - For lines through P and C, consider another point Q in H not on the line PC. Reflect Q through C to get Q_1 and through P to get Q^*. The line Q_1 Q^* is parallel to PC but distinct from it. 5. **Concrete Example:**    - Given the analysis, a set M satisfying the conditions can be constructed by:      - Taking any centrally symmetric set of points H not lying in a single plane.      - Reflecting H through a point P neq C and combining these points with H. 6. **Minimum Cardinality:**    - To form such a set M, consider points P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k, C where these points do not lie on a single plane and P_i is reflected forming P_{i+k}.    - Additional reflections can also create a suitable set, ensuring a minimum of at least 10 points.    - By appropriate selections and combinations, any natural number n geq 10 can be formed. **Conclusion:** Yes, there exists a finite set M of points in three-dimensional space meeting the required conditions.

To enhance the solution, let's break it down step by step: 1. Expand the squares inside the square root:    |overrightarrow {a} + overrightarrow {b}|^2 = (cosalpha + sinbeta)^2 + (sinalpha - cosbeta)^2. 2. Use the Pythagorean identity sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 and properties of sine and cosine to rewrite the terms:    begin{aligned}    |overrightarrow {a} + overrightarrow {b}|^2 &= cos^2alpha + 2cosalphasinbeta + sin^2beta + sin^2alpha - 2sinalphacosbeta + cos^2beta     &= (cos^2alpha + sin^2alpha) + (sin^2beta + cos^2beta) + 2(cosalphasinbeta - sinalphacosbeta)     &= 1 + 1 + 2sin(beta - alpha)     &= 2 + 2sin(beta - alpha).    end{aligned}     3.

Rearrange the inequality to match a standard quadratic form by multiplying everything by -1 (remember to flip the inequality sign when multiplying by a negative number):    [    |x|^{2} + |x| - 6 < 0    ] 4. Now, we interpret this inequality in terms of the absolute value of x. The inequality |x|^{2} + |x| - 6 < 0 suggests a range for |x| itself, which can be factored or solved as a quadratic equation in |x|. However, directly from the given solution, we understand it simplifies to:    [    -3 < |x| < 2    ] 5. Solving the inequality -3 < |x| < 2 for x gives two ranges because the absolute value of x can be both positive and negative:    - For |x| < 2, we have -2 < x < 2.    - The condition -3 < |x| is always true for -2 < x < 2 since the absolute value of x will be greater than -3. 6.

Since the sine function has a period of 360^circ, we can subtract the largest multiple of 360^circ that is smaller than 960^circ:  960^circ - 2 times 360^circ = 960^circ - 720^circ = 240^circ  Hence, we have: sin(960^circ) = sin(240^circ)  Now, let's express 240^circ as an angle related to an acute angle: sin(240^circ) = sin(180^circ + 60^circ)  Using the sine addition formula and the fact that sin(theta) = sin(180^circ - theta) for any angle theta, we get: sin(240^circ) = sin(180^circ + 60^circ) = -sin(60^circ)  The negative sign appears because the sine function is positive in the first and second quadrants but negative in the third and fourth quadrants. Since 240^circ lies in the third quadrant, sin(240^circ) is negative. Knowing that sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we have: sin(240^circ) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}  Therefore, the value of sin(960^circ) is: sin(960^circ) = boxed{-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}"},{"instruction":"Given that x > 0, y > 0, and frac{1}{x} + frac{2}{y} + 1 = 2, find the minimum value of 2x + y.","output":"Since x > 0 and y > 0, we have frac{1}{x} + frac{2}{y} + 1 = 2.

Let's denote these points of intersection on the diagonal as ( A ) and ( B ), with ( A neq B ). 3. **Coloring the Grid**:     - Color the ( 15 times 15 ) grid in a checkerboard pattern. Each square alternates in color (black and white).     - This results in ( 113 ) black squares and ( 112 ) white squares since the grid has an odd number of rows and columns (15 each). 4. **Path Analysis on Checkerboard**:     - As the line is symmetric, the path will symmetrically cross from black squares to white squares and vice versa.     - Any closed symmetric line must alternate equally between black and white squares. Given there are ( 113 ) black squares and ( 112 ) white squares, to maintain alternation, the maximum number of either color that can be visited is limited by the lesser count of white squares: ( 100 ). 5. **Counting Maximum Path Length**:     - When considering the symmetric nature of the path and the checkerboard alternation:     - Each transition from one square to an adjacent square (whether from black to white or white to black) constitutes one step of the line.     - Since the line must pass through each color equally and there are ( 112 ) white squares and ( 113 ) black squares, the total path can only pass through an equal or fewer number of squares of each color, being:     - Maximum possible white squares: ( 100 )     - Maximum possible black squares: ( 100 )     - Hence, the maximum length of the path is the sum of the paths which equals ( 200 ). 6. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, the length of the closed line is at most 200 squares.

We begin by noting some key properties of the given geometric configuration. Triangle ABC is inscribed in circle S, with A_0 and C_0 being the midpoints of the arcs BC and AB that do not contain A and C, respectively. Circles S_1 and S_2 are centered at A_0 and C_0 and are tangent to BC and AB respectively. 2. Let I be the incenter of triangle ABC. The point I is the intersection of the angle bisectors of angle BAC, angle ABC, and angle ACB. 3. Draw the tangent IK from I to circle S_1, such that K is the point of tangency and the line IK intersects the smaller arc A_0C. Similarly, draw the tangent IL from I to circle S_2 with L as the point of tangency. 4. Since A_0 is the midpoint of the arc BC (that does not include A), the angle bisector of angle BAC passes through A_0. Consequently, A_0 lies on the bisector of angle BAI.     5. Similarly, C_0 lies on the bisector of angle BCI because C_0 is the midpoint of the arc AB (that does not include C). 6. Let angle BAC = 2alpha and angle ACB = 2gamma. By the exterior angle theorem, we have:    [    angle A_0IC = alpha + gamma    ] 7. Given that I lies on the angle bisector of angle BAC, and recalling that A_0 lies on this bisector, we can assert that:    [    angle A_0CI = alpha + gamma    ]     8. This establishes that triangle A_0IC is isosceles with A_0I = A_0C. Furthermore, since S_1 is tangent to BC at its midpoint D, we observe the following:    - Both triangles A_0IK and A_0DC are right-angled triangles.    - They are congruent by the hypotenuse-leg (HL) theorem, because A_0I = A_0C and angle A_0IK = angle A_0DC.     9. This implies:    [    angle A_0IK = angle A_0CD = alpha    ]     10. Consequently, IK parallel AC. Similarly, by the same reasoning, IL parallel AC. 11. Since IK parallel AC and IL parallel AC, the points L, I, and K must be collinear and parallel to AC.

Therefore, QT/TS = [PQT]/[PST] = 75/45 = 5/3.  Since the ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, [QTS]/[PQT] = (TS/QT)^2 = (3/5)^2 = 9/25. Therefore, [QTS] = (9/25)[PQT] = (9/25)(75) = 27 square units.

Who will win under the given initial conditions?** 1. The game “Chocolate Bar” is essentially equivalent to the game “Nim,” where you try to take items from heaps in such a way that the opponent has no valid moves left [Refer to problem 5.77]. 2. In the Nim game, winning positions are those where the nim-sum (the bitwise XOR of all heap sizes) is non-zero. Losing positions are those where the nim-sum is zero. 3. Here, we consider the chocolate bar to be divided into \\"heaps\\" based on its dimensions.  4. For instance, the chocolate bar in the given problem can be represented as 4 heaps:    - 2 rows to the left of the marked piece (excluding the row with the marked piece)    - 5 columns to the right of the marked piece    - 1 row below the marked piece    - 4 rows above the marked piece 5. The current configuration is equivalent to 4 heaps: (2, 5, 1, 4). To determine the winning strategy: 1. Calculate the nim-sum for the heaps (2, 5, 1, 4): [ 2 oplus 5 oplus 1 oplus 4 ] 2. Calculate step-by-step: [ 2 oplus 5 = 7 ] [ 7 oplus 1 = 6 ] [ 6 oplus 4 = 2 ] 3. The nim-sum is 2, which is non-zero, indicating the current player can force a win with optimal play.     **Conclusion**:    - Since the nim-sum is non-zero at the beginning, the first player (starting player) has a winning strategy if they play optimally. [ boxed{text{First player wins}} ] **(b) In what dimensions of the chocolate bar does the starting player always win regardless of the marked piece's position?** 1. For the starting player to always win, the geometric consideration of the chocolate bar (heap sizes) should translate to non-zero nim-sum regardless of the marked piece’s position. 2. If both dimensions (rows and columns) of the chocolate bar are even, then no matter where the marked piece is placed, there is always a way to divide the bar into subsets (heaps) giving a non-zero nim-sum. **Conclusion**:    - The starting player always wins if both dimensions of the chocolate bar are even.

For the starting player to always lose, nim-sum calculations should yield zero regardless of the marked piece's position. This happens when the initial nim-sum is zero. 2. If both dimensions (rows and columns) of the chocolate bar are odd, no matter where the marked piece is placed, the sum of subsets (heaps) will result in a zero nim-sum. **Conclusion**:    - The starting player always loses if both dimensions of the chocolate bar are odd.

We shall employ several lemmas and proceed through detailed steps. 1. **Initial Observations and Lemma 1**:     - **Observation**: If ( a_{n+2m} ) divides ( a_n + a_{n+m} ) for all positive integers ( n ) and ( m ), it gives certain properties that are inherent to the sequence.     - **Lemma 1**: If a positive integer ( d ) divides both ( a_n ) and ( a_{n-m} ) for some ( m ) and ( n > 2m ), then ( d ) also divides ( a_{n-2m} ). Additionally, if ( d ) divides both ( a_n ) and ( a_{n-2m} ), then ( d ) also divides ( a_{n-m} ). 2. **Proof of Lemma 1**:     - Consider ( d mid a_n ) and ( d mid a_{n-m} ).     [     d mid (a_n - (a_{n-m} + a_{n-2m})) implies d mid a_{n-2m}     ]     - Similarly, if ( d mid a_n ) and ( d mid a_{n-2m} ),     [     d mid (a_n - (a_{n-m} + a_{n-2m})) implies d mid a_{n-m}     ]    This establishes both parts of the lemma. 3. **Claim: The sequence ( {a_n} ) is bounded.**     - Suppose, for contradiction, that ( {a_n} ) is unbounded. Then, there are an infinite number of indices ( n ) such that ( a_n ) is greater than all previous terms.     - Let ( a_n = k ), where ( k > a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1} ), and ( n > 10 ).     - For ( s < frac{n}{2} ), ( k mid (a_{n-s} + a_{n-2s}) < 2k ), thus,     [     a_{n-s} + a_{n-2s} = k     ] 4. Applying Lemma 1:     [     a_{n} = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} = a_{n-2} + a_{n-4} = a_{n-4} + a_{n-8}     ]     This implies:     [     a_{n-1} = a_{n-4}, quad a_{n-2} = a_{n-8}     ]     Applying Lemma 1, ( a_{n-1} ) should divide ( a_{n-1-3s} ) for ( 3s < n-1 ), and ( a_{n-2} ) should divide ( a_{n-2-6s} ) for ( 6s < n-2 ). 5. **Contradiction Leading to Boundedness**:     - Since ( a_{n} ) can be arbitrarily large, we get a contradiction. Hence, the sequence must be bounded. 6. **Existence of N**:     - Given the boundedness, there exist only finitely many ( a_i ). Thus, there exists an ( N ) such that ( a_i = t ) for ( i > N ) and for infinitely many ( j ). 7. **Step Towards Periodicity**:     - **Lemma 2**: If ( d ) divides ( a_n ) for some ( n ), the indices ( i ) such that ( d ) divides ( a_i ) form an arithmetic progression with an odd difference. 8. **Proof of Lemma 2**:     - Suppose ( i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < ldots ) are indices where ( d ) divides ( a_i ).     - If ( i_{s} + i_{s+1} ) is even, use Lemma 1:     [     d mid a_{frac{i_{s} + i_{s+1}}{2}} quad text{(contradiction as ( i_s < frac{i_{s} + i_{s+1}}{2} < i_{s+1} ))}     ]     Thus ( i_s ) and ( i_{s+1} ) are of different parity.     - Consequently, ( i_{s} + i_{s+2} ) is always even. By Lemma 1, we get,     [     d mid a_{frac{i_{1} + i_{s+2}}{2}} quad Rightarrow quad frac{i_{1} + i_{s+2}}{2} = i_{s+1}     ] 9. **Sequences and Set of Divisors**:     - The sequence ( {a_{n}} ) is therefore built on periodicities in its divisors.     - Let ( D ) be the product of all differences ( d_i ). Then for sequences governed by ( D ),     [     a_{n+D} = a_{n}     ] 10. **Conclusion**:     - ( {a_{n}} ) must be eventually periodic as shown by the boundedness and the properties of divisor progressions.

To find out what percent more this is, we subtract 1 (or 100 percent, since Tim's income is our reference point) and then convert the decimal to a percentage: Percent more = (1.70 - 1) * 100% Percent more = 0.70 * 100% Percent more = 70% Therefore, Mary's income is boxed{70}  percent more than Tim's income."},{"instruction":"The cubic polynomial [27x^3  12x^2  4x  1 = 0] has a real root of the form (frac{sqrt[3]{p} + sqrt[3]{q} + 1}{d},) where (p,) (q,) and (d) are positive integers.

But this is a contradiction since ( 1 leq v-u leq n-1 ) and there is ( m ) with ( f(m) = 1 ). 4. **Step 4: There exists such ( f ) iff ( n+1 ) is a prime number.**    **Proof:**    We know that for each ( 1 leq k leq n-1 ) there exists (minimum) ( l_k in mathbb{N} ) such that ( j^{l_k}(k) = 0 ). Now we have    [ f(m + j^l(k)) equiv f(m + k) - lf(m) pmod{n+1} ]    for ( 1 leq l leq l_k ). Thus,    [ f(m) = f(m + j^{l_k}(k)) equiv f(m + k) - l_k f(m) implies (l_k + 1) f(m) equiv f(m + k). ]    So,    [ (l_k + 1)^n f(m) equiv (l_k + 1)^{n-1} f(m + k) equiv ldots equiv f(m + nk) equiv f(m) pmod{n+1}. ]    That's    [ (l_k + 1)^n equiv 1 pmod{n+1} text{ for any } 1 leq k leq n-1. ]    Obviously, ( 1 leq l_k leq n ) and for ( u neq v ), ( l_u neq l_v ).

Moreover, ( l_k neq n ) since for ( l_k = n ) we would have ( f(m+k) equiv (l_k+1)f(m) equiv 0 pmod{n+1} ). Contradiction! Thus,    [ {l_1, l_2, ldots, l_{n-1}} = {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ]    and so    [ (l_k + 1)^n equiv 1 pmod{n+1} text{ for any } 1 leq k leq n-1 implies n+1 text{ is prime.} ] 5. **Step 5: If ( n+1 ) is prime, then there are ( n cdot phi(n) ) functions ( f ) satisfying the problem.**    **Proof:**    From Step 4, there is (minimum) ( 1 leq l leq n ) such that ( j^l(1) = 0 ). Also,    [ f(m+1) equiv (l+1)f(m) pmod{n+1} ]    for any ( m in mathbb{Z} ). So,    [ f(m) equiv (l+1)^m f(0). ]    Since ( f ) is surjective, ( l+1 ) must be a primitive root ( g ) modulo ( n+1 = p ). Thus, any function ( f ) is of the form    [ f(m) equiv g^m f(0) pmod{n+1}. ]    Moreover, any such function obeys the functional equation with ( j(k) = text{ind}(g^k - 1) ) (since ( 1 leq k leq n-1 ), ( g^k neq 0 ) and so this index exists). Since there are ( phi(p-1) = phi(n) ) ways to choose ( g ) and ( n ) ways to choose ( f(0) in {1, 2, ldots, n} ), there are ( n cdot phi(n) ) functions with the desired property.

This transformation simplifies the problem by focusing on the ratios between consecutive terms in ( {a_n} ), and we need to consider sequences ( {b_n} ) where ( b_i in {2, 1, -frac{1}{2}} ). 3. **Product constraint**: Since ( a_1 = a_9 = 1 ), we have:    [    prod_{i=1}^{8} b_i = frac{a_9}{a_1} = 1    ]    This implies that the product of the elements of ( {b_i} ) must equal 1. 4. **Analysis of possible values**:     - For ( prod_{i=1}^{8} b_i = 1 ) to hold true considering ( b_i in {2, 1, -frac{1}{2}} ), the sequence must have an equal number of factors that are reciprocals of each other. Specifically, the number of ( 2 ) terms must equal the number of ( -frac{1}{2} ) terms because ( 2 cdot -frac{1}{2} = -1 ).     - Let ( 2k ) be the number of ( -frac{1}{2} ) terms. Then, there must also be ( 2k ) terms of ( 2 ). Since there are 8 terms in total, the rest, or ( 8 - 4k ), must be 1s. 5. **Determination of ( k )**:     - The sum of all types of terms must be 8, thus we set ( 2k + 2k + (8 - 4k) = 8 ).     - Therefore, the possible values for (k) are ( 0, 1, 2 ), meaning ( k ) can take these integer values within the permissible range for the number of terms. 6. **Combinations calculation**:    - Now calculate the number of distinct sequences ( {b_n} ):      [      sum_{k=0}^{2} binom{8}{2k} binom{8-2k}{2k}      ]      Here ( binom{8}{2k} ) is the number of ways to choose ( 2k ) positions for ( -frac{1}{2} ), and ( binom{8-2k}{2k} ) is the number of ways to place ( 2 ) among the remaining terms.            - For ( k=0 ):        [        binom{8}{0} binom{8}{0} = 1         ]      - For ( k=1 ):        [        binom{8}{2} binom{6}{2} = 28 cdot 15 = 420         ]      - For ( k=2 ):        [        binom{8}{4} binom{4}{4} = 70 cdot 1 = 70        ]      Adding these, the total number of combinations is:      [      1 + 420 + 70 = 491       ] 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the number of distinct sequences ( {a_n} ) that satisfy the given conditions is: [ boxed{491} ]"},{"instruction":"Given points M(4,0), N(1,0), if a moving point P satisfies overrightarrow{MN} cdot overrightarrow{MP} = 6|overrightarrow{NP}|.

From overrightarrow{MN} cdot overrightarrow{MP} = 6|overrightarrow{NP}|, we get -3(x-4)=6sqrt{(1-x)^2+(-y)^2},   therefore (x^2-8x+16)=4(x^2-2x+1)+4y^2, hence 3x^2+4y^2=12, which is frac{x^2}{4}+ frac{y^2}{3}=1,   therefore The trajectory C is an ellipse with foci at (±1,0) and major axis length 2a=4.   Scoring note: If only the trajectory equation is found without specifying the curve type or if the explanation is not standard, deduct 1 point.   (2) The minimum distance from point Q on ellipse C to line l equals the distance between line l and a line l_1 that is parallel to line l: x+2y-12=0 and tangent to ellipse C.   Let the equation of line l_1 be x+2y+m=0 (mneq -12).   From begin{cases} 3x^2+4y^2=12  x+2y+m=0 end{cases}, eliminating y gives 4x^2+2mx+m^2-12=0(*).   According to the problem, Delta =0, hence 4m^2-16(m^2-12)=0, thus m^2=16, solving gives m=±4.   When m=4, line l_1: x+2y+4=0, the distance d between line l and l_1 is d= frac{|4+12|}{sqrt{1+4}}= frac{16sqrt{5}}{5}.   When m=-4, line l_1: x+2y-4=0, the distance d between line l and l_1 is d= frac{|-4+12|}{sqrt{1+4}}= frac{8sqrt{5}}{5}.   Since frac{8sqrt{5}}{5} < frac{16sqrt{5}}{5}, the minimum distance from point Q on curve C to line l is frac{8sqrt{5}}{5}.   When m=-4, equation (*) becomes 4x^2-8x+4=0, which is (x-1)^2=0, solving gives x=1.

To find out how many days C alone would take to finish the entire job, we take the reciprocal of C's work rate: Days for C to finish the job = 1 / (1/10) = 10 Therefore, C alone can finish the job in boxed{10}  days."},{"instruction":"Suppose S cans of soda can be purchased from a vending machine for Q quarters.

Case k = 1: 1. Consider a tetrahedron ABCD where AB = a and all other edges are of length 1. 2. To explore the range of a, hinge triangles ACD and BCD about the edge CD while varying the distance between A and B. 3. The extreme values are determined when A, B, C, D are coplanar:     - When A coincides with B, a achieves its minimum value, a = 0.     - When A and B are on opposite sides of CD, a achieves its maximum value. By the triangle inequality in triangle ABC, a cannot exceed the distance between diagonally opposite vertices in a unit cube (since a cannot stretch further without stretching other edges beyond their fixed lengths):     [ a = sqrt{3} ] 4. However, for a non-degenerate tetrahedron: [ 0 < a < sqrt{3} ]  Case k = 5: 1. This means 5 edges of the tetrahedron are of length a and 1 edge is of length 1. 2. By symmetry and considering similar constraints as before: [ 0 < 1 < sqrt{3}a ] 3. Hence, the necessary condition is: [ a > frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ]  Case k = 2: 1. There are two configurations:     - The two a-edges are adjacent (sharing a common vertex).     - The two a-edges are opposite. **Adjacent a-edges**: 1. Assume the sides AC and AD have length a, and other edges have length 1. 2. Vary A and B about CD:     - When A and B are on the same side of CD:     [ a = sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}} ]     - When A and B are on opposite sides:     [ a = sqrt{2 - sqrt{3}} ] 3. Therefore, this configuration allows: [ sqrt{2 - sqrt{3}} < a < sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}} ] **Opposite a-edges**: 1. Suppose AB = a and CD = a:     - Minimum a = 0.     - Maximum, when A, B, C, D form a configuration similar to a unit square in space, leading to:     [ a = sqrt{2} ] 2. Thus: [ 0 < a < sqrt{2} ] Combining both configurations: [ 0 < a < sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}} ]  Case k = 4: 1. This configuration means four edges have length a and two edges have length 1. 2. One approach is to look at the analogous two configurations in k=2:     - For four a edges, there are related parameters:     - We derived that: [ a > frac{1}{sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}}} = sqrt{2 - sqrt{3}} ]  Case k = 3: 1. Any value of a > 0 is allowed.     - For a leq 1, construct the tetrahedron such that three a edges form a triangle, with 1 edges forming connection to another vertex.     - For a geq 1, triangles with unit edges can be joined to additional vertex with a length edges.

The simple interest (SI) for the first scenario can be calculated using the formula: SI = A - P where A is the amount after interest, and P is the principal amount.

We know that P = 825, SI = 131, and t = 3 years.

Now, let's calculate the new rate of interest using the second scenario where the amount becomes Rs. 1055 in 3 years. For the second scenario: SI = 1055 - 825 = 230 Using the simple interest formula again: 230 = 825 * r_new * 3 / 100 230 = 2475 * r_new / 100 23000 = 2475 * r_new r_new = 23000 / 2475 r_new = 9.29 (approximately) So the new rate of interest is approximately 9.29% per annum.

This means that the cards must be placed in a contiguous sequence without any gaps between them. 3. **Counting the Number of Arrangements:**    Since the cards must be placed contiguously, the only variable is the starting position of the sequence of cards.

Since ( A ) is from the first half and ( B ) is from the second half, it already confirms that they both lie in the transition between the two halves and are at least as strong as any in the weaker half, and not stronger than any in the stronger half. 6. **Conclusion:**    Each stronger wrestler is at least as strong as or stronger than anyone they defeat or draw with, ensuring that no wrestler from the stronger half is improperly matched against or deemed weaker than they should be.

The number of ways to choose 2 digits out of 5 is ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ).    - Arrange these 4 digits (two pairs) in ( frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 ) ways.    - Therefore, the total number of sequences with exactly two digits appearing twice is:      [      10 times 6 = 60      ] 3. **Sequences with one digit appearing twice and two other distinct digits:**    - Choose 1 digit to appear twice and 2 other distinct digits from the remaining 4 digits. The number of ways to choose 1 digit out of 5 is ( binom{5}{1} = 5 ).    - The number of ways to choose 2 digits out of the remaining 4 is ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ).    - Arrange these 4 digits (one pair and two singles) in ( frac{4!}{2!} = 12 ) ways.    - Therefore, the total number of sequences with one digit appearing twice and two other distinct digits is:      [      5 times 6 times 12 = 360      ] Adding all these cases together, the total number of admissible sequences is: [ 120 + 60 + 360 = 540 ] # Part (b) We need to find the values of ( n ) for which ( frac{d_{n+1}}{d_n} ) is an integer, where ( d_n ) is the number of ways to fill an ( n times 4 ) array with admissible sequences such that the sequence ( 2, 0, 0, 8 ) appears exactly once. 1. **Fix the sequence ( 2, 0, 0, 8 ) in one of the ( n ) rows:**    - There are ( n ) ways to choose the row for the sequence ( 2, 0, 0, 8 ). 2. **Fill the remaining ( n-1 ) rows with admissible sequences:**    - Each of the remaining ( n-1 ) rows can be filled in ( 540 ) ways (from part (a)). Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the array is: [ d_n = n times 540^{n-1} ] 3. **Calculate ( frac{d_{n+1}}{d_n} ):**    [    frac{d_{n+1}}{d_n} = frac{(n+1) times 540^n}{n times 540^{n-1}} = frac{(n+1) times 540^n}{n times 540^{n-1}} = frac{(n+1) times 540}{n} = 540 + frac{540}{n}    ] For ( frac{d_{n+1}}{d_n} ) to be an integer, ( frac{540}{n} ) must be an integer. Therefore, ( n ) must be a divisor of 540.

Additionally, in the bottom-right (2 times 2) square, we color all 4 cells black.    This provides:    - 23 black cells from each (2 times 2 ) square (one black cell from each small square except for one which has 4 black cells)    - 4 black cells from one specific (2 times 2) square    Thus, we get a total of (23 + 4 = 27) black cells. 3. **Impossible Configurations**:    We observe that no three-cell corner can simultaneously cover black cells from two different (2 times 2) squares.

We need either:    - One operation to convert 3 black cells into white cells, or    - Two operations each converting 2 black cells into white cells.     6. **Adequacy of Operations**:    Since (2 times 2) squares total 24 and the cells are wholly covered:    - Either one square has 3 black cells, or    - At least two squares have exactly 2 black cells.    Hence, by recoloring respective three-cell corners and continue with remaining black cells:    - If initially all (2 times 2) squares followers, then total operations ≤ 24.

Define the desired permutations (sigma') and (tau') as follows:    [    sigma'(i_l) = begin{cases}     sigma(i_{l-1}), & text{if } l in {2, 3, ldots, q-1}     sigma(i_{q-1}), & text{if } l = 1    end{cases}    ]    [    tau'(i_l) = begin{cases}     tau(i_{l+1}), & text{if } l in {2, 3, ldots, q-1}     tau(i_{p'}), & text{if } l = 1    end{cases}    ]    and (sigma'(i) = sigma(i), tau'(i) = tau(i)) for the rest (i in [n]) that (i notin {i_1, i_2, ldots, i_{q-1}}). 9. **Verification**: Note that the reason we choose (tau(i_{p'})) is just to not use (tau(i_p) = tau(i_{(q-1)+1})) more than one time. This construction gives us (sigma'(i) + tau'(i) equiv_n b_i) for all (i in [n]) except when (i = i_1). But since both (sigma') and (tau') are permutations of ([n]), we have:    [    sum_{i in [n]} (sigma'(i) + tau'(i)) equiv_n 2 times frac{n(n-1)}{2} equiv_n 0 equiv_n sum_{i in [n]} b_i    ]    This guarantees that (sigma'(i) + tau'(i) equiv_n b_i) when (i = i_1) too.

Notice that {l}_{2}:x+4=0 is equivalent to x=-4, which is the directrix of the parabola.

However, for the sake of the problem, let's assume that n is a positive integer and is meant to be 81 instead of 81.1. Given that when k is divided by n, the remainder is 11, we can express k as: k = n * q + 11 where q is the quotient when k is divided by n. Since we want to find the value of k / n, we can substitute the expression for k into this: k / n = (n * q + 11) / n Now, we can separate the terms in the numerator: k / n = (n * q) / n + 11 / n The term (n * q) / n simplifies to q because n/n is 1: k / n = q + 11 / n Since n is 81, we can substitute this value into the equation: k / n = q + 11 / 81 Without the specific value of q (the quotient), we cannot determine the exact value of k / n.

First, it's important to clarify what \\"repulsive blood\\" might mean in the context of your question. If you're referring to blood or substances that repel sharks rather than attract them, there are a few points to consider: 1. **Sharks and Blood:** Sharks are known for their acute sense of smell, and they can detect even the smallest amounts of blood in water. This characteristic often leads to the misconception that sharks are drawn to any kind of blood, no matter the circumstances. However, research indicates that sharks are more interested in the blood of their natural prey (such as fish) than human blood, for instance. The exact reaction might vary among different shark species. 2. **Repellent Substances:** When considering substances that could potentially repel sharks, including those mimicking blood, research and development in shark repellent technologies have been ongoing for years. Some studies have explored substances that could repel sharks, including chemicals found in the dead bodies of sharks themselves (as the smell of a dead shark can signal danger to other sharks) and synthetic compounds. The idea is that these substances could interfere with the sharks' sensory signals and deter them from approaching. 3. **Repulsive to Sharks:** If by \\"repulsive bloods\\" you mean blood or synthetic compounds designed to be unattractive or repelling to sharks, this falls into the realm of shark repellent research. There is interest in developing products that could protect humans without harming sharks, such as magnetic or electric fields, and specific chemical compounds. In summary, while sharks are attracted to the blood of their prey, there is ongoing research into substances that could repel them. This includes exploring whether certain types of synthetic \\"blood\\" or other compounds might be unattractive or even repelling to sharks, potentially for use in personal protection or conservation efforts. The interaction of sharks with these substances would depend on the specific chemical composition and how it affects the sharks' sensory systems."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this but it's set in GTA 5, keep the original format “ # SUN # {I} “a burning memory” (Space Station) # MERCURY # {I} “A New Genesis” {II} “Sword fight on the heights” {III} “The Mentor” (boss battle) {IV} “The Mercury Nexus” (Space Station) # VENUS # {I} “Acid’s reign” {II} “Zeppelin Wars” {III} “Lovely Bastards” (boss battle) {IV} “Infernal cradle” (Space Station) # EARTH # {I} “Paradise Lost” {II} “Revelation’s echoes” {III} “Their Former Eden” (boss battle) {IV} “Among The Stars” (Space Station) # MARS # {I} “God of War” {II} “War of the Worlds” {III} “Ozymandias” (boss battle) {IV} “Martian Bastion” (Space Station) # EUROPA # {I} “潜水艦戦争” {II} “Frozen Neon” {III} “Big Red Spot” (boss battle) {IV} “By Jove!” (Space Station) # TITAN # {I} “The Capitol” {II} “Methane Sea” {III} “Crossroads” (boss battle) {IV} “Titanic” (Space Station) # UMBRIEL # {I} “Shadow’s Crescent” {II} “Dusk’s Embrace” {III} “Nocturne’s Veil” (boss battle) {IV} “Umbriel Enclave” (Space Station) # TRITON # {I} “Neptune’s Forge” {II} “Frozen Cathedral” {III} “Triton’s Sorrow” (boss battle) {IV} “Solar Drift” (Space Station) # PLUTO # {I} “Abandon All Hope” {II} “Twin Moons” {III} “Calm Before The Storm” (no enemies) <code class=”} “AT HELL’S GATE” (final boss)\`\`\`“”>","output":"# LS SUN # {I} \\"Eternal Flames\\" (Vinewood) # LS DOWNTOWN # {I} \\"Beginnings of an Empire\\" {II} \\"Street Confrontations\\" {III} \\"The Kingpin\\" (boss battle) {IV} \\"Downtown Nexus\\" (Penthouse) # VESPUCCI BEACH # {I} \\"Sands of Wrath\\" {II} \\"Chopper Showdown\\" {III} \\"Beachside Brawl\\" (boss battle) {IV} \\"Coastal Haven\\" (Safehouse) # SAN ANDREAS # {I} \\"Lost Paradise\\" {II} \\"Echoes of the Past\\" {III} \\"Fallen Dynasty\\" (boss battle) {IV} \\"Starlight Escape\\" (Airport) # SANDY SHORES # {I} \\"Desert Storm\\" {II} \\"Turf Wars\\" {III} \\"Desert Mirage\\" (boss battle) {IV} \\"Desert Outpost\\" (Motel) # PALETO BAY # {I} \\"Submarine Standoff\\" {II} \\"Frosty Heist\\" {III} \\"Bear Mountain\\" (boss battle) {IV} \\"Northern Lights\\" (Cabin) # ALAMO SEA # {I} \\"The Drought\\" {II} \\"Toxic Waters\\" {III} \\"Crossfire\\" (boss battle) {IV} \\"Sea Monster\\" (Marina) # MT.

Sharks may have developed certain tolerances to these toxins, although the extent of this varies by species and the type of toxin involved. 2. **Toxin Types:** The effect of a toxin on a shark would heavily depend on the type of toxin. For instance, tetrodotoxin, found in pufferfish, is highly potent and dangerous to many predators, but some shark species can consume pufferfish without apparent harm, suggesting an adaptation or resistance to the toxin. 3. **Exposure Level:** The effect of consuming toxic blood would also depend on the amount of toxin present. A small amount may not have a noticeable effect on a large shark, but a high concentration could be more problematic. 4. **Shark Species Variability:** There's considerable variability among shark species in terms of diet, habitat, and physiology. Some sharks may be more adept at handling certain toxins either through their digestive processes or through evolutionary adaptation to their common prey. 5. **Research Limitations:** Sharks are difficult subjects for the detailed, controlled studies that would be necessary to fully understand their interactions with various toxins. Much of what is known comes from observational studies or indirect evidence. In summary, while sharks can interact with prey that has toxic blood, their ability to tolerate or detoxify these substances likely varies with the type of toxin, the amount ingested, and the specific shark species. The study of these interactions is complex and not fully understood, representing an interesting area for future marine biology and toxicology research."},{"instruction":"what insurances are accepted in charnock hospital kolkata?","output":"Charnock Hospital in Kolkata accepts the following insurances: 1.

The process leads to determining the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) and Tangency Portfolio (TP) under each strategy, with and without the allowance for short selling. The following R code outlines the approach, using hypothetical assets data (not provided here). You'll need the \`quadprog\` package for portfolio optimization and \`PerformanceAnalytics\` for financial metrics. Ensure you have your strategies selection ready (\`strategy1_selection\` and \`strategy2_selection\`), and their corresponding return data. 1. **Install Required Packages**: If not already installed, install \`quadprog\` and \`PerformanceAnalytics\`. \`\`\`r install.packages(\\"quadprog\\") install.packages(\\"PerformanceAnalytics\\") \`\`\` 2. **Load Packages**: \`\`\`r library(quadprog) library(PerformanceAnalytics) \`\`\` 3. **Prepare Data**: The following steps assume you have already selected your assets under both strategies and computed their returns, which are ready for analysis. 4. **Define Optimization Functions**: For both GMVP and TP, considering restrictions on short selling. \`\`\`r # Function to calculate Global Minimum Variance Portfolio getGMVP <- function(returns) { Dmat <- 2 * cov(returns) dvec <- rep(0, ncol(returns)) Amat <- rbind(rep(1, ncol(returns)), diag(ncol(returns))) bvec <- c(1, rep(0, ncol(returns))) solve.QP(Dmat, dvec, Amat, bvec, meq = 1)solution } # Function to calculate Tangency Portfolio (allowing short selling) getTP <- function(returns) { Dmat <- 2 * cov(returns) dvec <- rep(0, ncol(returns)) # The mean returns are applied to find the tangency portfolio Amat <- rbind(rep(1, ncol(returns)), colMeans(returns)) bvec <- c(1, 0) solve.QP(Dmat, dvec, Amat, bvec, meq = 1)solution } \`\`\` 5. **Optimization and Results**: Assuming you have return data framed appropriately for each strategy (\`strategy1_returns\`, \`strategy2_returns\`), apply the optimization: \`\`\`r # Assuming you have returns data for the selected strategy1 and strategy2 assets # strategy1_returns <- Your strategy1 returns data # strategy2_returns <- Your strategy2 returns data # Calculate optimal weights under each scenario weights_strategy1_GMVP <- getGMVP(strategy1_returns) weights_strategy1_TP <- getTP(strategy1_returns) # With potential short selling weights_strategy2_GMVP <- getGMVP(strategy2_returns) weights_strategy2_TP <- getTP(strategy2_returns) # With potential short selling # Display the weights print(\\"Weights for Strategy 1 GMVP:\\") print(weights_strategy1_GMVP) print(\\"Weights for Strategy 1 TP:\\") print(weights_strategy1_TP) print(\\"Weights for Strategy 2 GMVP:\\") print(weights_strategy2_GMVP) print(\\"Weights for Strategy 2 TP:\\") print(weights_strategy2_TP) \`\`\` 6. **Portfolio Return and Risk Analysis**: Incorporate metrics like Sharpe ratio, expected returns, and standard deviation to evaluate portfolio performance further. This step necessitates that you've pre-calculated or have the means to calculate based on asset weights. 7. **Commentary**: The analysis results—from weight allocations to risk-return profiles—will illuminate the differences between employing a Global Minimum Variance strategy versus aiming for the Tangency Portfolio, under both allowance and restriction of short selling.

Jest to muskularny organ o kształcie stożka, zlokalizowany w klatce piersiowej, bezpośrednio nad przeponą. Składa się z czterech komór: dwóch przedsionków (lewy i prawy) oraz dwóch komór (lewa i prawa). Praca serca zaczyna się od napływu krwi do przedsionków poprzez żyły główne - górna (żyła główna górna) i dolna (żyła główna dolna). Następnie przedsionki kurczą się, aby przepompować krew do komór. Gdy przedsionki się skurczą, zamykają się zastawki międzyprzedsionkowe, aby zapobiec cofaniu się krwi z komór. Po napłynięciu krwi do komór, komory serca kurczą się, wyrzucając krew do tętnic. Wyrzut krwi do tętnic jest napędzany przez skurcze mięśnia sercowego, który nazywany jest fazą skurczu (systolą). Następnie serce przechodzi w fazę rozkurczu (diastolę), podczas której serce odpoczywa i wypełnia się ponownie krwią. Cały ten proces jest regulowany przez specjalny system bodźców elektrycznych w sercu, który zapewnia odpowiedni rytm pracy serca. Główne elementy tego systemu to węzeł zatokowo-przedsionkowy (SA) i węzeł przedsionkowo-komorowy (AV), które generują elektryczne impulsy dla skurczu serca. Dzięki odpowiedniemu działaniu serce jest w stanie utrzymywać odpowiedni przepływ krwi w organizmie, dostarczając tlen i składniki odżywcze do wszystkich tkanek i narządów. Jego praca jest niezwykle skomplikowana i precyzyjnie zorganizowana, co sprawia, że serce jest jednym z najbardziej wydajnych narządów w organizmie człowieka."},{"instruction":"jaka jest dokłada budowa serc","output":"Serce składa się z trzech warstw: osierdzia, mięśnia sercowego i wsierdzia. 1. Osierdzie: Osierdzie jest zewnętrzną warstwą serca i składa się z trzech warstw: osierdzia włóknistego na zewnątrz, osierdzia żylnego wewnętrz i osierdzia surowiczego pomiędzy nimi. Osierdzie pełni funkcje ochronne i podtrzymujące dla serca. Zapobiega nadmiernemu rozciągnięciu serca, zapewnia ruchomość i zmniejsza tarcie podczas skurczów i rozkurczów serca. 2. Mięsień sercowy: Mięsień sercowy, zwany także miokardium, jest warstwą środkową serca, odpowiedzialną za główne funkcje pompowania krwi. Składa się z komórek mięśniowych, które skurczają się rytmicznie, napędzając przepływ krwi. Mięsień sercowy jest bardzo gęsto unaczyniony i bogato unerwiony, co zapewnia mu odpowiednie zaopatrzenie w tlen i składniki odżywcze oraz kontrolę nad pracą serca. 3. Wsierdzie: Wsierdzie to wewnętrzna warstwa serca, która składa się z dwóch warstw: wsierdzia ściennego (endocardium) na wewnętrznej powierzchni serca i wsierdzia płynnego (pericardium) na zewnętrznej powierzchni wsierdzia ściennego. Wsierdzie pełni funkcje pokrycia wewnętrznej powierzchni serca, zapewniając gładką powierzchnię dla przepływu krwi oraz utrzymuje odpowiednią barierę między krwią a mięśniem sercowym. Wszystkie te warstwy serca współpracują w harmonii, aby zapewnić sprawną pracę serca jako układu krążenia. Ich odpowiednia budowa i funkcjonowanie mają kluczowe znaczenie dla utrzymania zdrowia i prawidłowej funkcji serca."},{"instruction":"jaki jest wpływ choroby niedokrwiennej serca na mięsień sercowy","output":"Choroba niedokrwienna serca, nazywana także chorobą niedokrwienną (CAD), może mieć poważny wpływ na mięsień sercowy, zwany miokardium. CAD jest spowodowana zmniejszonym dopływem krwi do mięśnia sercowego, najczęściej w wyniku zwężenia lub zablokowania tętnic wieńcowych, które dostarczają krew do serca. Oto główne konsekwencje choroby niedokrwiennej serca dla mięśnia sercowego: 1. Nekroza mięśnia sercowego: W przypadku nagłego lub długotrwałego braku dopływu krwi do mięśnia sercowego, może dojść do uszkodzenia komórek mięśniowych, co prowadzi do martwicy (nekrozy) mięśnia sercowego. Martwica mięśnia sercowego może być przyczyną zawału serca, co jest poważnym stanem zagrożenia życia. 2. Uszkodzenie funkcji pompującej serca: Osłabienie mięśnia sercowego, spowodowane uszkodzeniem lub martwicą komórek mięśniowych, może prowadzić do zaburzenia funkcji pompującej serca. Serce może mieć trudności w pompowaniu odpowiedniej ilości krwi do pozostałych części ciała, co skutkuje niewystarczającym zaopatrzeniem tkanek w tlen i składniki odżywcze. 3. Rozstrzenienie komór serca: Starania serca o zrekompensowanie uszkodzeń mięśnia sercowego mogą prowadzić do rozwoju rozstrzenienia komór serca. Rozstrzenienie to jest stanem, w którym komory serca powiększają się i stają się mniej skuteczne w swojej pracy, co może dalszą pogorszyć funkcję pompującą serca. 4. Arytmie serca: Uszkodzenie mięśnia sercowego może również prowadzić do zaburzeń rytmu serca, zwanych arytmiami. Nawracające arytmie mogą zwiększyć ryzyko zawału serca lub niewydolności serca. W związku z powyższym, choroba niedokrwienna serca ma znaczący wpływ na mięsień sercowy i ogólną funkcję serca. Dlatego wczesne rozpoznanie i leczenie CAD oraz dbałość o zdrowy styl życia i regularne monitorowanie stanu serca są kluczowe dla zapobieżenia powikłaniom i utrzymania zdrowego mięśnia sercowego."},{"instruction":"porównaj proszę dławicę piersiową stabilną i niestabilną","output":"Dławica piersiowa jest objawem choroby niedokrwiennej serca, która charakteryzuje się niedostatecznym dopływem krwi do mięśnia sercowego. Istnieją trzy główne rodzaje dławicy piersiowej: stabilna, niestabilna i przetrwała. Poniżej przedstawiam porównanie dławicy piersiowej stabilnej i niestabilnej: 1. Dławica piersiowa stabilna: - Jest spowodowana zwężeniem tętnic wieńcowych, które zwykle nie zmienia się gwałtownie. - Objawia się jako ból w klatce piersiowej, który występuje podczas wysiłku fizycznego lub stresu i ustępuje wraz z odpoczynkiem. - Charakteryzuje się przewidywalnymi i regularnie powtarzającymi się epizodami bólu. - Jest zwykle bardziej kontrolowana za pomocą leków, zmiany stylu życia i unikania czynników ryzyka, takich jak palenie papierosów, nadwaga i brak aktywności fizycznej. 2. Dławica piersiowa niestabilna: - Jest poważniejszym stanem niż dławica stabilna, ponieważ objawy są bardziej intensywne, dłużej trwające i mogą występować w spoczynku. - Charakteryzuje się narastającym, ciężkim bólem w klatce piersiowej, który może promieniować do ramion, pleców, szyi lub żuchwy. - Objawy dławicy piersiowej niestabilnej mogą wystąpić nagle, nawet w spoczynku, i nie ustępują tak łatwo jak w przypadku dławicy stabilnej. - Stanowi o wiele większe zagrożenie dla zawału serca, ponieważ może wskazywać na rozwijającą się niewydolność serca lub zawał serca. Wniosek: Dławica piersiowa stabilna i niestabilna różnią się przede wszystkim pod względem nasilenia objawów, czynników wywołujących i potencjalnego ryzyka powikłań, takich jak zawał serca. Dławica piersiowa niestabilna wymaga natychmiastowej interwencji medycznej, podczas gdy dławicę piersiową stabilną można zazwyczaj kontrolować za pomocą leków i zmiany stylu życia. W obu przypadkach ważne jest monitorowanie objawów, regularne konsultacje z lekarzem i dostosowanie leczenia do indywidualnych potrzeb pacjenta."},{"instruction":"czym dokładnie jest dławica piersiowa","output":"Dławica piersiowa, zwana również dusznicą bolesną, jest objawem choroby niedokrwiennej serca. Wywołuje ją zmniejszony dopływ krwi do mięśnia sercowego, najczęściej w wyniku zwężenia lub częściowego zablokowania tętnic wieńcowych - naczyń krwionośnych, które zaopatrują serce w krew, tlen i składniki odżywcze. Dławica piersiowa zazwyczaj występuje, gdy zapotrzebowanie mięśnia sercowego na tlen i składniki odżywcze przewyższa zdolność tętnic wieńcowych do dostarczenia odpowiedniej ilości krwi. Objawem charakterystycznym dławicy piersiowej jest ból lub ucisk w klatce piersiowej, który może promieniować do ramion, pleców, szyi, żuchwy lub brzucha. Ból ten najczęściej występuje podczas wysiłku fizycznego, emocjonalnego stresu, spożywania obfitych posiłków lub narażenia na zimny wiatr, a ustępuje w momencie odpoczynku. Objawy dławicy piersiowej mogą być różnie opisywane przez pacjentów - od uczucia ściskania czy ucisku w klatce piersiowej, po duszności czy nawet ból gardła. Jeśli dławica piersiowa nie zostanie odpowiednio zdiagnozowana i leczona, może prowadzić do poważniejszych powikłań, takich jak zawał serca (infarkt mięśnia sercowego). Dlatego ważne jest, aby osoby doświadczające bólu w klatce piersiowej zgłosiły się do lekarza w celu przeprowadzenia odpowiednich badań diagnostycznych, takich jak elektrokardiogram (EKG), próba wysiłkowa, czy badania obrazowe serca, w celu zdefiniowania przyczyny bólu i zaplanowania odpowiedniego leczenia. Dławica piersiowa jest poważnym objawem, który nie powinien być bagatelizowany. W porę podjęte działania diagnostyczne i terapeutyczne mogą pomóc w kontrolowaniu objawów, zapobieganiu powikłaniom i poprawie jakości życia pacjenta."},{"instruction":"jakie czynności powinien przeprowadzić ratownik medyczny w postępowaniu z pacjentem u którego podejrzewa się dławice piersiową","output":"Postępowanie ratownika medycznego w przypadku podejrzenia dławicy piersiowej u pacjenta ma kluczowe znaczenie, ponieważ szybka reakcja i właściwe udzielenie pierwszej pomocy mogą pomóc w zapobieżeniu poważnym powikłaniom, takim jak zawał serca. Oto kilka kroków, które ratownik medyczny powinien podjąć w takiej sytuacji: 1.

Tętnice: - Wewnętrzna błona śródbłonka: Wewnętrzna warstwa naczynia krwionośnego, która pokrywa wnętrze tętnicy i zapobiega tworzeniu się zakrzepów. - Warstwa środkowa (śródsierść): Składa się z mięśni gładkich i włókien sprężystych, które nadają tętnicom elastyczność i zdolność do skurczu i rozkurczu. - Zewnętrzna błona nasadowa: Zewnętrzna warstwa tętnicy, zbudowana z tkanki łącznej, która zapewnia wsparcie i ochronę dla naczynia. 2. Żyły: - Wewnętrzna błona śródbłonka: Podobnie jak w tętnicach, wewnętrzna warstwa zapobiega tworzeniu się zakrzepów. - Środkowa warstwa: W żylach warstwa mięśniowa jest słabsza niż w tętnicach, ponieważ żyle służy przede wszystkim jako magazyn krwi. - Zewnętrzna błona nasadowa: Warstwa zewnętrzna składa się z tkanki łącznej i jest mniej wyraźna niż w tętnicach. 3. Naczynia włosowate: - Kapilara: Naczynia włosowate są najmniejszym rodzajem naczyń krwionośnych, zapewniających bezpośrednią wymianę substancji między krwią a tkankami. Składają się z jednej warstwy komórek śródbłonka i nie posiadają warstw mięśniowych. - Połączenia między żyłami i tętnicami: Kapilary łączą się z żyłami i tętnicami w układzie krwionośnym, aby umożliwić krążenie krwi w organizmie. Naczynia krwionośne pełnią kluczową rolę w transporcie tlenu, składników odżywczych, hormonów i innych substancji niezbędnych dla funkcjonowania komórek i tkanek w organizmie.

Nazwa ta została nadana na cześć angielskiego fizjologa sir Thomasa Bowdisha, który badał mechanizmy przekazywania impulsów nerwowych. Zasada \\"wszystko albo nic\\" dotyczy zasady, że neuron reaguje na bodziec nerwowy albo w pełni - generując impuls nerwowy (czyli potencjał czynnościowy), albo w ogóle - nie generując żadnej reakcji. Oznacza to, że jeśli bodziec osiągnie odpowiedni próg pobudzenia (tzw. próg czynnościowy), neuron generuje impuls nerwowy o stałej wartości i intensywności. Nie ma takiej możliwości, że neuron wygeneruje słabszy impuls nerwowy w odpowiedzi na słabszy bodziec nerwowy. Prawo Bowdish'a opisuje ten proces w sposób binarny: impuls nerwowy jest generowany w sposób \\"wszystko albo nic\\", co oznacza, że impuls nerwowy nie jest modyfikowany w zależności od siły bodźca, ale jest generowany zawsze w pełni, jeśli bodziec osiągnie progowy poziom stymulacji. W skrócie, zasada \\"wszystko albo nic\\" opisuje, że neuron albo generuje impuls nerwowy (czynnościowy), albo nie reaguje wcale na bodziec - nie istnieje pośrednia reakcja.

It's important to note that applying these human-centric personality systems to animals is purely speculative and anthropomorphic. However, it can be a playful way to understand both the personalities frameworks and dolphin behavior. # MBTI: ENFP - Known for their enthusiasm, charm, and improvisational skills, dolphins could be seen as ENFPs. They're curious, playful, and seemingly love engaging with their environment and other beings, including humans. # Enneagram: Type 7 (The Enthusiast) - Dolphins might align with Type 7s, who are extroverted, optimistic, versatile, and spontaneous. They seek to avoid pain and boredom, much like dolphins seem to do by constantly playing and exploring their surroundings. # Temperament: Sanguine - The sanguine temperament is marked by sociability, cheerfulness, and activity. Dolphins, with their playful nature and complex social interactions, fit this description well. # Big Five - **Extraversion: High.** Dolphins are extremely social and energetic animals. - **Neuroticism: Low.** They appear to manage stress well, living in the moment. - **Conscientiousness: Moderate.** While dolphins can be goal-oriented (e.g., when hunting), they also exhibit a lot of playful, less structured behavior. - **Agreeableness: High.** They're known for their cooperative behavior and, in many cases, friendly interactions with humans. - **Openness: High.** Dolphins are highly curious and intelligent, often exploring new objects and devising creative hunting strategies. # Socionics: IEE (Intuitive Ethical Extrovert) - This type is characterized by enthusiasm, innovation, and an emphasis on relationships and emotions. Given their social structures and behaviors, dolphins could fit here. # Instinctual Variant: Social (So) - The social variant is about bonding and being in tune with the social environment, which mirrors the complex social behaviors and hierarchies observed in dolphins. # Hogwarts House: Gryffindor - The bravery, playfulness, and loyalty dolphins exhibit, especially in stories of them protecting humans from sharks or leading lost swimmers to safety, could make them fit well into Gryffindor. # Moral Alignment: Chaotic Good - They seem to follow their own set of rules that align with their social structures and curiosity-driven behaviors, doing good as per their instincts, which places them in the chaotic good category.

Given the assigned traits to a dolphin, let's examine how these might manifest in its behavior and social dynamics, keeping in mind the whimsical nature of this exercise. # MBTI: ENFP Dolphins recognized as ENFPs would be curious and enthusiastic, likely engaging in playful interactions with other sea creatures and humans. They would be inventive in their play, showing a wide range of emotions and responses to their environment, often seeking novelty. # Enneagram: 7w6 This suggests a dolphin that is enthusiastic, busy, and spontaneous, with a strong sense of community (wing 6). They would likely be the ones initiating group activities, perhaps leading their pod on adventures and finding new territories or sources of food, while also being somewhat anxious about the well-being of their pod members. # Temperament: Sanguine A dolphin with a sanguine temperament would be sociable and lively, often being the center of attention within the pod. Their playful antics and friendliness could serve as a bonding glue among pod members, making social interactions smooth and cohesive. # Big Five Personality Traits - **Extraversion: High**: This dolphin would be very outgoing and energetic, seeking social interactions frequently. - **Neuroticism: Low**: It would maintain a calm demeanor even in stressful situations such as avoiding predators or navigating human interactions. - **Conscientiousness: Low**: This could manifest as being more spontaneous or less organized in their daily activities, maybe not adhering strictly to migration patterns or feeding schedules. - **Agreeableness: Low**: The dolphin might display more competitive or assertive behavior, especially when it comes to securing food or mating opportunities. - **Openness: High**: Indicative of a dolphin curious about its environment and possibly innovative in using tools or developing new hunting strategies. # Socionic: IEE As an IEE, our dolphin friend would be enthusiastic, compassionate, and ideologically driven, possibly taking charge in guiding their pod through complex social dynamics and ensuring harmony. # Instinctual Variant: so/sx With a social/sexual instinctual variant, this dolphin would place a significant importance on forming and maintaining social bonds and might be particularly adept at navigating the intricate social structures of dolphin pods. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin A Slytherin dolphin might be ambitious and cunning, perhaps excellent at strategizing to catch prey or navigate through complex environments. They might also show strong loyalty to their pod, valuing the collective success and survival. # Moral Alignment: Chaotic Evil This is a challenging aspect to imagine in a dolphin since it suggests a willingness to harm others for personal gain without regard for rules or moral codes. Perhaps in the realm of playful imagination, this could be seen in a dolphin that is more aggressive in asserting dominance or securing resources, possibly engaging in trickery or deceit in an intelligent, albeit mischievous manner. Assigning these human-centric traits to dolphins is purely speculative and anthropomorphic, but it serves as an interesting thought experiment to reflect on both animal behavior and human personality frameworks."},{"instruction":"Sana bir metin vereceğim. Bu metin, \\"Mimar Sinan'ın inşa ettiği camilerindeki taçkapı özellikleri\\" hakkında. Bu metni çok dikkatlice oku. Bu metinde adı geçen tüm cami isimlerini ve o camilerle ilgili kullanılan belli özellikleri göreceksin. Bu özelliklerin hangi camilerde tekrarlanıp hangi camilerde tekrarlanmadığı, hangi özelliğin kaç defa tekrarlandığı, tekrarlanan özelliklerin kaç defa tekrarlandığını belirt ve liste olarak hazırla. Metin: İstabul’daki Hürrem Sultan adına Mimar Sinan’ın Başmimar seçildiği ilk yıl yapmış olduğu yapı olan Haseki Camisi’nin taçkapı düzenlemesi, genel hatlarıyla Erken Osmanlı Dönemi taçkapı tasarımının devamı şeklindedir. Bu dönemde taçkapı Erken Osmanlı Döneminde olduğu gibi son cemaat yerinin simetri aksı üzerindeki revak açıklığının boyutlarıyla belirlenen alan içine yerleştirilmiştir. Sinan, Erken Osmanlı Döneminin plastik ifadelerini burada kısmen de olsa güçlendirerek kullanmaya çalışmıştır. Taçkapıda dikdörtgen çerçeveyi biçimlendiren silmelerin düzenlenişi, iki renkli mermerden yapılmış kemer ve sövelerin zıvanalı geçmelerle birbirine bağlanması, ana niş köşelerine yerleştirilmiş yan nişler ve dış kısımların keskinliğini gideren köşe sütunceleri Sinan’ın ileride de uygulayacağı tasarımın birer parçalarıdır. Burada geleneksel taçkapı düzenlemesinden farklı olarak Koca Sinan’ın ilk ve son kez uyguladığı mukarnaslı kavsaranın üst kısmının geniş bir istiridye kabuğu motifiyle bitirilmiş olmasıdır. Ayrıca yan nişlerin üst kısımlarında görülen kare kartuşlar içinde dört köşeye istiflenmiş makili hatla yazılan “ Muhammed” yazısı da ilk kez görülen bir uygulamadır. Hüsreviyye Camisi, kaba kitle yapısına karşın dengeli plan düzeni ile klasik üslubun temel ilkelerinin atıldığı bir dönemde inşa edilmiştir. Cami ile birlikte yukarı doğru yükselme eğilimindeki son cemaat yerinin merkezinde bulunan taçkapı, dar fakat öne doğru taşan görkemli kütlesiyle erken dönemin plastik ifadelerinin malzeme ve süsleme anlayışı gibi yerel özelliklerin etkisiyle güçlenerek kullanıldığı ünik bir örnektir. Nişi örten mukarnas kavsara biçimsel açıdan Sinan’ın üslubunu yansıtsa da ayrıntılarda yerel özellikler öne çıkmaktadır. Özellikle mukarnas yuvaları, sarkıt ve püsküllerin kullanılmayışı ve geniş badem yüzeylerin öne çıkması aslında bölgedeki Eyyubi tarzı mukarnasları hissettirmektedir. Koca Sinan’ın Sultan ailesine yaptığı camiler içinde ikincisi olan İstanbul Üsküdar Mihrimah Sultan, Sinan’ın farklı şema uygulamaları arasında önemli bir örnek olarak ön plana çıkmaktadır. Caminin genel kütle düzenlenişi içinde görülen bu değişiklik taçkapıya yansıtılmamıştır. Sinan’ın geleneksel mukarnas kavsaralı tasarımının yinelendiği taçkapı 8 m.’ yi bulan yüksekliği ve mukarnas sıralarının çok olmasıyla ön plana çıkmaktadır. Taçkapıda görülen sade silme takımları, mukarnas kavsaralı yan nişler, kum saatli kaide ve başlıklara sahip köşe sütunceleri ana hatlarıyla başmimarın üslup birliğini tamamlamaktadır. Çıraklık eseri olarak tanınan İstanbul Şehzade Camisi’nin taçkapısı Sinan’ın anıtsal taçkapı tasarımları arasında yer alan önemli bir örnektir. Taçkapı, yapının genel mimari karakterine uygun bir tasarım anlayışı sağlamakla birlikte Sinan’ın inşa ettiği Selatin camileri içinde taçkapısı oldukça sade örneklerden birisi olarak karşımıza çıkmaktadır. Mukarnas kavsaralı kapı nişinde plastik ifadelerin güçlü bir şekilde kullanılışı, silmelerin çerçeve düzenine olan etkisi, niş köşesindeki sütuncelerin giriş açıklığı ile olan orantısı ve yan nişlerin taçkapı derinliğine olan katkısı Koca Sinan dönemi üslubunu ana hatlarıyla yansıtmaktadır. Bunun yanında mukarnaslı kavsarada kullanılan sarkıt boyutlarının oldukça küçük tutulması, kavsara köşeliğinin süslemesiz olması ve çerçeveyi kuşatan silme sayısının az oluşu Sinan’ın avlu girişi taçkapısından sonra burada özellikle ayrıntıda daha sade bir tutum sergilediği görülmektedir. Şehzade Camisi’nden yaklaşık 7 yıl sonra Kanuni Sultan Süleyman’ın sadrazamı ve aynı zamanda damadı olan Rüstem Paşa tarafından yaptırılan Tekirdağ Rüstem Paşa Camisi’nin9 taçkapısı Mimar Sinan’ın başkent İstanbul dışında da yaygın olarak kullandığı geleneksel taçkapı düzenlemeleri arasında önemli bir yere sahiptir. Bir selâtin cami taçkapısı olmamakla birlikte gerek cephe düzenlenişi ve gerekse anıtsallığı ile imparatorluk merkezindeki eserlerle kıyaslanabilecek derecede önemli bir örnektir. Sinan, İstanbul dışındaki örneklerinde taçkapılarda ağırlıklı olarak 6 veya 7 sıralı mukarnas dizisini tercih etmektedir. Burada ise 9 sıranın tercih edilmesi taçkapının derinliğini arttırarak anıtsallığını pekiştirmiştir. Ayrıca mukarnaslı kavsarada sarkıt sayısının çok fazla olması, püsküllere pek ehemmiyet verilmemesi,giriş açıklığı sövelerinde iki renkli mermer bloklarının kullanımı gibi bazı detaylarda hassas davranması taçkapıyı bir selâtin cami taçkapısı havasına sokmaktadır. Rüstem Paşa’nın Tekirdağ’daki bu eserinde geleneksel taçkapı tasarımını uygulayan Sinan, yıllar sonra Paşa’nın İstanbul’daki çini panolarıyla kaplı değişik bir son cemaat yeri duvarıyla dikkat çeken camisinde geleneksel taçkapı kullanımına gerek duymayacaktır. Kalfalık eseri Süleymaniye Camisi’nin taçkapısı Klasik Osmanlı mimarisinin en görkemli yapıtlarından birisi için tasarlanmış olmasına ve görkemli dikdörtgen prizma kitlesine rağmen avlu taçkapısının anıtsallığı yanında ikincil planda ele alınmış bir taçkapı özelliği göstermektedir. Son cemaat yerinin güney duvarında simetri aksı üzerindeki revak açıklığının boyutlarıyla belirlenen alan içine yerleştirilen taçkapı, Sinan’ın geleneksel motiflerini bütünüyle korumaktadır. Yalın fakat keskin hatlarla biçimlendirilmiş olan taçkapıda içe doğru derinleşen çanak ve içinden çıkan mukarnaslı sarkıtlar ve çoklu silme takımları Sinan’ın selâtin camilerde severek kullandığı bir uygulamadır. Buna karşın başta giriş açıklığı kemeri üstü olmak üzere yan nişlerin üzerinde yer alan üç ayrı kitabe panosu aslında klasiğin ötesinde yer alan bir uygulamadır. Ayrıca ortadaki kitabe panosunun etrafını kuşatan mermer malzeme Sinan dönemi taçkapılarında pek kullanılmayan farklı türde malzeme kullanımı açısından kayda değer bir durumdur. Sinan’ın Şam’da Sultan Süleyman için tasarladığı Şam Süleymaniye Camisi (Necipoğlu 2005:271) ise taçkapısı ile Sinan’ın geleneksel mukarnas kavsaralı taçkapı geleneğini sürdürmektedir( Şekil 2- Fotoğraf 2). Yapının genel mimari karakterine uygun bir tasarım anlayışı sergileyen taçkapı, mukarnas öğeleriyle biçimlenen niş örtülü taçkapı düzenlemesi, irili-ufaklı sarkıtları ve mukarnaslı yan niş uygulamaları ile Koca Sinan dönemi üslubunu ana hatlarıyla bünyesinde taşımaktadır. Buna karşın yalın ama keskin hatlarla biçimlendirilmiş taçkapının geometrik bordürlü çerçevesi, aslında Sinan’ın taçkapı uygulamalarında kullanmayı pek tercih etmediği klasiğin ötesinde bir uygulamadır. Bu uygulamayı eserin inşa edildiği bölgeye veya başta Sinan olmak üzere yardımcılarının mahalli gelenekleri kullanma konusundaki tutumları ile açıklamak mümkün olabilir. İstanbul- Edirne arasında ufak bir Türk kasabası olan Babaeski’deki Semiz Ali Paşa Camisi’ne ait taçkapısı Mimar Koca Sinan’ın gelişen anıtsal taçkapı uygulamaları arasında İstanbul dışındaki önemli örneklerinden birisidir ( Eyice 1989: 427). Taçkapı, Sinan dönemi üslubunu birebir yansıtmaktadır. Sinan dönemi taçkapılarında görmeye alışık olduğumuz iri ve keskin mukarnas dizileri ve özellikle belirgin olan büyük boyutlu sarkıt ve püsküller taçkapının vazgeçilmezidir. Bunun yanında yine Sinan’a has olan çerçeveyi meydana getiren silme dizilerinin keskin ve aralarının boş bırakılmış olmasıdır. İstanbul’dan Edirne’ye açılan güzergâhın ikinci menzilinde geniş bir külliye içinde tasarlanan Lüleburgaz Sokullu Cami( Kuran 1986: 297), taçkapısı ile Babaeski Semiz Ali Paşa Cami taçkapısına benzer tasarım özellikleri göstermektedir. Sinan’ın bir başka menzil külliyesi içinde yer alan Havsa Sokullu Mehmet Paşa Cami ile karşılaştırıldığında sade yapı, sade taçkapı fikri Babaeski Semiz Ali Paşa Camisinde anıtsal yapı, anıtsal taçkapı olarak yorumlanabilir. Mimar Sinan’a ait tezkirelerde kayıtlı olmasına rağmen (Sai Mustafa Çelebi 2002: 110), bazı sanat ve mimarlık tarihçileri tarafından Sinan’la olan ilişkisi şüpheli olarak karşılanan Cenabi Ahmet Paşa Camisi genel yapısı içinde Koca Sinan döneminin başkent İstanbul’dan uzak, taşralı, sade ve mütevazı yapısının yanında taçkapısıyla bu mütevazılığin bir adım önünde yer alan bir eserdir. Taçkapı, mukarnas kavsarası, iri ve keskin mukarnas dişleri, mukarnas kavsaralı yan nişleri, iki renkli giriş açıklığı kemeri ve sade silme takımları ile Sinan dönemini yansıtmaktadır. Bunun yanında taçkapıda öne çıkan önemli özelliklerden birisi taçkapıyı üç taraftan çevreleyen silme takımları içindeki geometrik kompozisyondur. Burada bir dairenin 6 farklı daire tarafından kesilmesiyle elde edilmiş şeklin biteviye uzayıp sonsuz bir karakter alması önemlidir. Bu kompozisyonun aslında Ankara’daki camilerde daha önceki dönemlerle de camilerin farklı bölümlerinde uygulandığı ve Sinan’ın aslına bakılırsa burada kendi üslubundan taviz vermeden mahalli unsurlardan kısmen de olsa istifade ettiği anlaşılmaktadır. Taçkapının konumlanmasında ise bazı hataların ön plana çıktığı şüphesizdir. Özellikle Sinan yapılarında taçkapı ile mihrap genellikle aynı eksen üzerinde yer alan birimlerdir. Fakat burada taçkapı mihrap eksenine göre biraz sağa kaydırılmıştır. Bunun yanında taçkapının tepelik bölümü son cemaat revakındaki sağır kemer alınlığına çarpmakta ve tepeliğin kesik görünmesine neden olmaktadır. Mimar Sinan Döneminin merkezden oldukça uzak bir yerleşim yeri olan Diyarbakır’daki Behram Paşa Cami ( Şekil 3-Fotoğraf 3) ve Melek Ahmet Paşa Camisi’nin taçkapıları Sinan’ın anıtsal taçkapı tasarımlarının önemli örnekleri arasında yer almaktadır. Her iki taçkapı Sinan’ın İstanbul’daki üslubunu yerel bir yorumla yansıtmaktadır. Genel anlamda Sinan’ın mukarnas öğeli geleneksel taçkapı örnekleri arasında olmasına rağmen özele indirgendiğinde yeni bir varyasyon denendiği anlaşılmaktadır. Mukarnaslı kavsarayı kuşatan dilimli kavsara kuşatma kemeri, mukarnas dişlerindeki zengin motifler, mukarnaslı sütun başlıkları, geniş bir yüzeyi kaplayan silmeler ve iki renkli malzeme kullanımı bu varyasyonun zenginliğini ortaya koyar. Özellikle güneye özgü taş işçiliğine yerel özelliklerin katılmasıyla birlikte Sinan’ın geleneksel düzenlemeleri içinde ana şemalar kalmakla birlikte yerli geleneklerle beslendiği aşikârdır. Edirne Selimiye Camisi’nin taçkapısı, klasik Osmanlı mimarisinin en şahane yapıtlarından birisi için tasarlanmış özgün bir örnektir ( Şekil 4- Fotoğraf 4). Taçkapı, anıtsal ölçülere sahip olmasının yanında özelde Başmimarın, genelde ise Osmanlı Mimarisinin zirve yapısı olarak kabul edilen bir yapının taçkapısı olarak ele alındığında oldukça yalın hatlara sahiptir denilebilir. Taçkapı genel düzeni içerisinde cephelerde kademelenmeyi oluşturan silmelerin oldukça sade tutulması, kavsarada görülen sarkıtların oldukça küçük boyutlarda oluşu ve süsleme özellikleri itibariyle önceki dönem taçkapılarına oranla daha basit mukarnas dişlerine sahip oluşu, tepelik motifine gerek duyulmayışı, mukarnas kavsaralı yan nişler yerine daha basit kompozisyona sahip sivri tonozlu nişlerin tercih edilmesi, yan nişlerin keskinliğini gideren köşe sütuncelerinin genel çerçeve düzeni içerisinde oldukça zayıf kalışı bu sadeliği destekler durumdadır. Koca Sinan’ın başmimarlığının son yıllarında -Edirne Selimiye Camisinin tamamlanıp, Eyüp Zal Mahmud Paşa Camisinin tasarlandığı yıllarda- inşa ettiği Kılıç Ali Paşa Cami, yapısal kuruluşu açısından Ayasofya’nın küçük bir tekrarı niteliğindedir. Dış mimari bütünlüğünün aksine iç mekan anlayışı açısından Klasik Osmanlı mimarisine ters düşen yapı, taçkapı düzenlemesi bakımından da Sinan’ın geleneksel mukarnas öğeleriyle biçimlenen niş örtülü düzenlemesinden uzaktır. Sinan, taçkapı düzenlemesinde farklı bir tasarım oluşturarak derinlik arz etmeyen düz bir üçgenin oluşturduğu kavsara tipini denemiştir. 13 kademeden oluşan kavsara, üçgenlerin birbirlerinin tepe noktalarına gelecek şekilde muntazam bir şekilde dizilmiştir. Kavsaranın ortasındaki üçgen bölüm ise Ayet-i Kerime’ler ile bezenmiştir. Derinliği olmayan taçkapıda yine yüzeysel olarak verilen yan nişler uygulanmış olmakla birlikte mukarnas başlıklı köşe sütunceleri, belirgin silme takımları ve sade kavsara köşeliği geleneksel taçkapı uygulamalarında gördüğümüz unsurlardır. Sinan, taçkapıyı oymalı tepelikle taçlandırılmış gibi değilde bir anlamda ziyaretçiye burasının yaratıcıya ait bir yer, Allah sevgisinin yüce huzuru olduğunu anımsatan yazıyı göstermek için sanki kenarı bordürlü taş perdeyi bir parça geri itmiş gibi oluşturmuştur ( Egli, 2009:205). Baş mimarın ömrünün son yıllarında Sultan ailesi için inşa ettiği Atik Valide Sultan Camisi, büyük boyutlu bir külliye biriminin merkezini oluşturmasının yanı sıra altıgen plan şemasının önemli örneklerinden birisi olarak dikkat çekmektedir. Caminin genel kütle düzenlenişi inşaatın bitişinden birkaç yıl sonra kısmen değişikliğe uğramış olsa da bu değişiklik taçkapı ve çevresine yansıtılmamıştır. Taçkapı, Sinan dönemi üslubunu yansıtmaktadır. Sinan dönemi taçkapılarında görmeye alışık olduğumuz iri ve keskin mukarnas dizileri ve özellikle belirgin olan büyük boyutlu sarkıt ve püsküller taçkapının vazgeçilmezidir. Bunun yanında yine Sinan’a has olan çerçeveyi meydana getiren silme dizilerinin oldukça keskin ve aralarının boş bırakılmış olmasıdır. Koca Sinan’ın 1582 yılında Mekke dönüşü yapımına başladığı Mesih Paşa Cami, plan kurgusu ve tasarımı açısından aynı yıllarda Kalfası Davud Ağa’ya mal edilen Mehmed Ağa Camisi’ne benzemektedir. Cami, malzeme, plan ve tasarım özellikleri açısından Mimar Sinan’ın geleneksel tasarım özelliklerini büyük ölçüde karşılasa da o yıllarda Mimarbaşının yaşının oldukça ilerlemiş olması sebebi ile yapının tasarımında Davud Ağa’nın etkisinin olduğu kabul edilmesi gereken bir gerçektir. Yapıda kuzey cephenin birincil öğesi konumundaki taçkapı, Sinan’ın geleneksel mukarnas kavsaralı taçkapı düzenlemeleri arasında önemli bir örnektir. Yapının mimari karakterine uygun bir tasarım anlayışı gösteren taçkapı, yalın fakat keskin hatlara sahip dikdörtgen çerçevesi, bu çerçeveyi ters “U” biçiminde kuşatan silmeleri, aşağıdan yukarıya doğru düzenli bir şekilde daralan mukarnaslı kavsarası, ana niş yan kanatları üzerine yerleştirilen nişler ve bu nişlerin köşelerini pahlandıran sütunceleri Sinan dönemi geleneğinin başlıca unsurlarıdır. Mimar Sinan’ın artık ömrünün son yıllarında inşa ettiği camilerdeki taçkapı tasarımlarında da ağırlıklı olarak geleneksel taçkapı tasarımını yinelediğini görmekteyiz. Bunlar içinde Kayseri Hacı Ahmet Paşa Camisi’nin taçkapısını örnek olarak verebiliriz. Caminin tamamlanış yılı olan 1586 yılında Sinan’ın 96 yaşında olması ve bundan ötürü inşaatın başında bizzat bulunamayacağı gibi ihtimaller göz önüne alındığında başta caminin olmak üzere taçkapının Sinan’ın öğrencileri tarafından tasarlanmış olacağı ihtimalini düşündürmektedir. Sinan’ın bizzat yapmış olduğu mukarnas kavsaralı taçkapılarda bulunan bütün öğeleri barındıran taçkapı, gerek boyutları, gerek günümüze ulaşamayan sarkıt ve birtakım püskülleri ve gerekse taşra örneklerinde sık rastlamadığımız on sıra mukarnas tasarımıyla bir bakıma selatin cami taçkapısı havasına sokulmak istenmiştir. Buna yine selatin cami taçkapılarında karşımıza çıkan ve mukarnaslı kavsarada cephede karşılığı olmayan tek üçgenlerin oluşturduğu çanak biçimli derin nişler ve çerçevenin üst bölümünde tasarlanan tepelik motifleri katkı sağlamaktadır. Bu dönemdeki önemli selâtin camilerinden birisi de Manisa Muradiye Cami’dir. Cami taçkapısı ise Sinan’ın başkent dışında yaygın olarak kullandığı geleneksel taçkapı düzenlemeleri arasındadır. Bir selâtin cami taçkapısı olmakla birlikte yapının mimari karakterine uygun bir tasarım anlayışı gösteren taçkapı, yalın fakat keskin hatlara sahip dikdörtgen çerçevesi, bu çerçeveyi ters “U” biçiminde kuşatan iç bükey ve dış bükey silmeleri, aşağıdan yukarıya doğru düzenli bir şekilde daralan mukarnaslı kavsarası, ana niş yan kanatları üzerine yerleştirilen mukarnaslı yan nişler ve bu nişlerin köşelerini pahlandıran sütunceleri, Sinan dönemi geleneğinin başlıca unsurlarıdır. Bununla birlikte Sinan’ın genel olarak selâtin cami taçkapılarında uyguladığı bir geleneğin devamı olan mukarnaslı kavsarada öne doğru çıkıntı yapan ana konsolun mukarnas dizilerini iki hacime bölmesi burada da devam etmektedir. Yine kavsarada tek üçgenlerin kendi içinde bir çanak biçimi oluşturması ve bu düzenlemenin cephede karşılığının olmaması Sinan’ın selâtin cami taçkapılarında uyguladığı bir kompozisyondur. Tüm bu veriler dikkate alındığında Muradiye Cami taçkapısı genel hatlarıyla Sinan’ın geleneğinin Manisa’da da devam ettiğinin bir göstergesidir. Nişancı Mehmed Paşa tarafından Mimar Sinan’a siparişte bulunulan Nişancı Mehmed Paşa Cami, Sinan’ın ömrünün son yıllarında inşa edilmeye başlanarak vefat ettiği yıl olan 1588 yılında tamamlanmıştır. Yazılı belgelerde Sinan tarafından başlanıp kalfalarından birisi tarafından tamamlandığı belirtilmekle birlikte yapıyı Sinan’ın varisi Davud Ağa’ya mal eden araştırmacılarda bulunmaktadır ( Kuran 1986:235). Camide mukarnas öğeleriyle biçimlenen kavsaralı taçkapı, son cemaat yerinin birincil öğesi konumundadır. Taçkapı, Sinan dönemi anıtsal yapı kavramı içindeki geleneksel tasarımını korumuş olmakla birlikte planda olduğu gibi birtakım değişikliklerin izlendiği bir birim olarak dikkat çekmektedir. Taçkapıdaki en büyük değişiklik Sinan’ın harime giriş taçkapılarında hiç göremediğimiz çerçeveyi iki yönde kuşatan sütuncelerin zeminden tepelik hizasına kadar yükselmesi olmuştur. Buna bağlı olarak çerçevede silmelerin ikinci planda kalarak oldukça zayıf tutulmaları, bununla birlikte tepelikte karşımıza çıkan mukarnas sıraları daha önce denenmemiş bir uygulamadır. Bu uygulamaların dışında taçkapıda niş derinliğinin az tutulması buna doğru orantılı olarak yan nişlere yer verilememesi, kavsara köşeliğinde oldukça geniş tutulan gülçeler dikkat çeken diğer özelliklerdir. İnşa kitabesi bulunmayan buna karşın 16. yüzyılın 3. çeyreğine tarihlendirilen İstanbul Eyüp Zal Mahmut Paşa Cami, anıtsal taçkapı tasarımlarının önemli örnekleri arasında yer almaktadır. Yapı her ne kadar dış cephesiyle Sinan döneminde daha önce alışık olmadığımız özellikler taşıyor olsa da taçkapı bazında Sinan dönemi üslubunu ana hatlarıyla bünyesinde barındırmaktadır. Taçkapıda belirgin olan iri ve keskin mukarnaslar ile bu dönemde görmeye alışık olduğumuz oldukça iri sarkıt ve püsküller taçkapının vazgeçilmez öğeleridir. Ayrıca keskin silme dizilerinin kapının çerçevesini belirleyici bir unsur olması ile köşe sütuncelerinin bir bütün olarak taçkapı bünyesine dahil edilmesi de, bu döneme özgü kompozisyonun bir parçasıdır. Bu taçkapıda olduğu gibi, Sinan dönemi taçkapılarında Erken Osmanlı Dönemi taçkapılarına benzer olarak kademelenmeyi başlatan ilk silmenin genellikle geniş bir düz silme ile başlaması da bu dönemin taçkapı geleneğidir. Sinan, mukarnaslı kavsaraya sahip taçkapılarında niş derinliğini fazla tutarak yan nişlere yer vermesiyle aslında bir bakıma ön plana çıkmıştır. Buradaki taçkapı ise mukarnaslı kavsaraya sahip olmasına rağmen niş derinliği dar tutularak yan nişlere yer verilmemiştir. Bu durum taçkapıda farklılık yaratmıştır. Yine bu dönemde sıklıkla görülen iki renkli mermerden yapılan giriş açıklığı kemerleri dekoratif bir görünüm kazandırmasının yanında kemer bloklarının birbirlerine daha iyi kenetlenmesini sağlamıştır. Buna karşın Sinan döneminde kapı niş örtülerinde genellikle nişin eni boyun yarısı kadar olmuş olsa da bu vezir taçkapısında nişin eni boyunun yarısından daha az olarak dikkat çekmektedir. Mimar Sinan’ın başmimarlığı döneminde ülkedeki yoğun yapı eylemi sırasında ibadet mekanının kuzeyindeki taçkapısında farklı düzenlemeler uyguladığı görülmektedir. İstanbul’da ve İstanbul dışındaki bazı cami örneklerinde geleneksel mukarnas kavsaralı taçkapı örneklerinden uzaklaştığı görülmektedir. Bu örneklerin sayısının az olması akla şu iki varsayımı getirmektedir. Yoğun yapı eylemi sırasında Sinan’ın mukarnas ustası bulamaması veya yapının banisinin bu doğrultudaki özel isteği olarak düşünülebilir. Bu örnekler içinde süslemesiyle en dikkat çekici olanı İstanbul Rüstem Paşa Cami taçkapısıdır. D. Kuban’ın ifadesiyle Osmanlı bezeme sözlüğü olarak kabul edilen yapı (Kuban 2007:442), İznik duvar çinileri imalatının teknik ve desen açısından doruk noktasına ulaştığı dönemin ürünüdür. Çiniler içeride örtüye kadar olan bölümler ile dışarıda taçkapı dâhil son cemaat yeri duvarlarını bütünüyle kuşatmıştır. Büyük çini panoları ve yüksek pencereler ile farklı bir son cemaat yeri içinde oluşturulan taçkapı, Sinan’ın geleneksel taçkapılarından bütünüyle uzaklaşmış eşsiz bir örnektir. Son cemaat yeri duvarından taşıntısı olmayıp aynı düzlemde ele alınan taçkapı, çerçeve ile giriş açıklığından meydana gelmektedir. Taçkapıyı ters “U” biçiminde kuşatan çini bordürler çerçeveyi oluşturarak ön plana çıkmakta ve girişi taçkapı hüviyetine kavuşturmaktadır. Çerçeveyi bir bütün olarak kuşatan çini panolarda lacivert ve beyaz zemin üzerine işlenmiş zengin bitkisel motifler Sinan’ın tek başına tasarlayıp uyguladığı bir durum olmayıp dönemin en zengin sadrazamının özel bir isteği sonucu ortaya çıkan bir durumdur. Bu durum sadece çini panolarda değil genel taçkapı tasarımı açısından da örnek gösterilebilir. Sinan’ın taçkapıda böyle bir bezemeyi uygun bulmayışı daha sonraki örneklerinde benzer bir uygulama yapmamasından anlaşılmaktadır. Sinan’ın sanatı içinde özel bir yer tutan Edirnekapı Mihrimah Sultan Cami, Sinan’ın tek kubbeli camiler tipinde meydana getirdiği en büyük mimari eserlerindendir. Kare bir taşıyıcı sisteme oturan 20 m. çapındaki tek kubbenin bütün taşıyıcı kemerler sistemiyle yapının bütünü içinde yükselmesi, köşelerin barok bir gösterimle vurgulanması ve kemerlerin içinde çok sayıda pencere kullanılması Sinan için bir farklılıktır. Sinan, camide gösterdiği bu farklılığı taçkapıda da uygulamıştır. Burada geleneksel taçkapı motifinden uzaklaşılmış ve böylece simetri aksı üzerinde niş örtülerini mukarnas öğeleriyle biçimlendirme geleneği bozulmuştur. Kuzeydeki taşıyıcı ayaklar arasında kalan duvar yüzeyi üzerinde düzenlediği taçkapı derinlik arzetmez. Buna bağlı olarak kavsara bulunmamaktadır. Ancak taçkapı ile taşıyıcı ayaklar arasında kalan bölüme yan nişler yerleştirilerek kapı açıklığına derinlik vurgusu verilmiştir. Geleneksel mukarnas kavsaralı taçkapı biçiminden yer yer uzaklaşılması İstanbul dışındaki örneklerde de görülmektedir. Bunlar içinde Isparta Firdevs Bey Cami önemlidir. Yapı, 16. yüzyılda merkezden oldukça uzak küçük bir yerleşim birimi için tasarlanıp inşa edilmiş basit nitelikler taşıyan klasik bir örnektir. Plan kurgusu, kütle düzeni ve boyutları ile Sinan’ın kendisine özgü üslubunu büyük oranda yansıtan eser aynı zamanda Sinan’ın tek kubbeli beş göz revaklı camiler grubu içinde ele alınmaktadır. Taçkapı, caminin genel mimari karakterine uygun özellikle klasik çizgiler içinde sade bir tasarım özelliği göstermektedir. Taçkapıda oldukça sade silme takımlarının yanında kavsara köşeliğinin boş bırakılması, giriş açıklığı kemerinde tek renk taş malzemenin kullanılması ve derzlerin düz oluşu aslında herhangi bir estetik kaygının güdülmediği kanısını doğurmaktadır. Bu kaygıyı kısmen de olsa bozan tek unsur ise sövelerde giriş açıklığına bakan yüzeylerde yer alan üç sıra halindeki mukarnas bezemeler ile bitkisel bezemelerdir. Malzeme açısından düz kesme taş malzeme ile mermerin birlikte kullanımı ise aslında yapıya bir hareketlilik kazandırmamıştır. Konya- Ilgın Lala Mustafa Paşa Camisi’nde yeni bir cephe etüd eden Sinan, caminin boyutlarıyla uyumlu taçkapıda sivri kemerli bir kavsarayı tercih ederken niş derinliğinden ödün vermeden mukarnas kavsaralı yan niş uygulamasını devam ettirmiştirSinan, taçkapının anıtsallığını arttırmak için ana nişi olabildiğince derin tutmuş ve böylece bu bölümün anıtsal bir mekân olarak algılanmasını kolaylıkla çözmüştür. Bu özelliklerinin dışında genel hatlarıyla Klasik döneme özgü ağırbaşlı ve yalın süsleme anlayışı içerisinde tasarlanan taçkapıda silme takımları ve iki renkli mermerden yapılan giriş açıklığı kemeri cephenin belirleyici önemli öğeleridir. İstanbul’dan Anadolu’ya açılan güzergâhın ikinci menzilinde geniş bir külliye içinde tasarlanan Pertev Mehmed Paşa Camisi Sinan’ın son dönemlerinde inşa ettiği ve sekizgen çardak tasarımına yaklaşan yapılar ( Kuban 1997:113) içinde yer alan özgün bir eserdir. Plan kurgusu ve mimari özellikleri açısından Sinan’ın klasik şemasına uygun bir örnek olarak gösterilebilen yapı, aynı zamanda oldukça sınırlı ve yalın süsleme programıyla da mimarinin ihtişamını gölgelemeyecek durumdadır. Mimarinin ihtişamını gölgelemeyen aksine daha da arttıran yerlerin başında ise taçkapı gelmektedir. Mukarnas öğeli geleneksel taçkapı tasarımını burada terk etmiş olan Sinan, bunun yerine daha basit ölçülerde niş derinliği çok az olan sivri kemerli kavsarayı tercih etmiştir. Mukarnaslı kavsara kullanımını ise mihraptan yana tercih etmiştir. Taş bezemenin mihrap ve minberden sonra en sade yeri olan taçkapı, bir takım farklılıklarla ön plana çıkmaktadır. Bunların başında ise sivri kemerli kavsara ve giriş açıklığı kemerinde farklı tür ve renkteki mermer malzemenin kullanımı gelmektedir. Bu değişiklik aslında Sinan tarafından nadir görülen bir durumdur. Yine kavsara köşeliklerinin boş bırakılması yerine büyük ölçekli rozetlerin kullanımı ve özellikle çerçevenin üst kısmında (belki de taçkapının kısmen de olsa varlığını hissettirmek kaygısıyla) tepelik motifinin tercih edilmesi de görmeye çok alışık olduğumuz bir durum değildir. Bu durum taçkapıya aslında yeni bir hava katmış gibi gözükse de sivri kemerli kavsara yüzeyinin boş bırakılması ve oldukça yalın silme dizileri Sinan’ın belirli çizgiler dışına çıkmak istemediğinin bir göstergesi olarak algılanabilir.","output":"Metinde adı geçen camiler ve ilgili özelliklerin tekrarlandığı camileri ve tekrar sayılarını listeleyerek sunuyorum: 1.

Это означает, что размер исходной выборки будет 65+12=77. Выполним этапы задания шаг за шагом. # 1. Выбор датасета Для данного примера выберу датасет о ценах на дома, а именно одну из характеристик - площадь домов (в квадратных футах). Это популярный тип данных в задачах регрессии. # 2. Формирование одномерной выборки Представим, что мы взяли выборку из 77 значений площади домов. Эти данные синтетические, но подходят для демонстрации. # 3. Обоснование вероятностного моделирования К вопросу о площади домов можно применять вероятностное моделирование, поскольку распределение площади домов в реальных данных обычно следует определённому закону распределения (часто нормальное или лог-нормальное). Понимание этого распределения позволяет оценить вероятность того, что встретится дом определённой площади. # 4. Выбор генеративного метода Для воспроизведения данных по тому же закону выберем метод, создающий синтетические данные на основе нормального распределения. Это может быть метод, опирающийся на параметры среднего и стандартного отклонения изначального массива данных. # 5. Генерация данных Допустим, у нас есть синтетическая исходная выборка, где среднее значение площади составляет 1500 кв. фт., а стандартное отклонение — 300 кв. фт. Используем Python и библиотеку numpy для генерации выборки размером 77. \`\`\`python import numpy as np np.random.seed(42) # для воспроизводимости synthetic_sample = np.random.normal(loc=1500, scale=300, size=77) \`\`\` # 6. Сортировка выборок Проведём сортировку исходной и синтетической выборок. \`\`\`python original_sample_sorted = np.sort(synthetic_sample) synthetic_sample_sorted = np.sort(synthetic_sample) # В данном примере они будут одинаковы, так как исходная выборка синтетическая \`\`\` # 7. Построение графика Теперь, используя matplotlib в Python, нарисуем точки (X,Y). \`\`\`python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.scatter(original_sample_sorted, synthetic_sample_sorted) plt.xlabel('Исходная выборка X') plt.ylabel('Синтетическая выборка Y') plt.plot([1000, 2000], [1000, 2000], 'r') # линия Y=X для сравнения plt.show() \`\`\` # Рефлексия На графике, в идеальном случае, точки должны лежать вдоль линии Y=X, так как мы синтезировали данные, следуя тому же закону распределения, что и исходные.

Рассмотрим несколько возможных источников такой случайности: 1. **Вариативность трафика.** В зависимости от времени суток, дня недели, сезона или проведения маркетинговых акций и событий величина трафика, обрабатываемого системой, может сильно варьироваться, влияя на количество и размер транзакций. 2. **Ограничения системы.** Технические ограничения или параметры настройки системы (как программное, так и аппаратное обеспечение), такие как доступная память, пропускная способность сети и мощность процессора, могут влиять на максимально допустимый размер транзакции. Эти параметры могут изменяться со временем и в разных условиях эксплуатации. 3. **Политика безопасности и регуляторные ограничения.** Различные внешние регуляции, политика безопасности компании и антифродовые меры могут ограничивать размеры транзакций, что добавляет дополнительную неопределённость в их максимальное значение. 4. **Человеческий фактор.** Поведение пользователей может быть непредсказуемо, включая как законные действия, так и попытки мошенничества, которые могут приводить к необычно крупным транзакциям в непредвиденное время. 5. **Технические сбои и атаки.** Неполадки в программном обеспечении, сбои в работе аппаратного обеспечения или целенаправленные кибератаки могут вызывать нештатные ситуации в работе системы, непредсказуемо влияя на размер транзакций. В контексте блокчейна, к таким факторам также можно добавить изменения в протоколе сети, поведение майнеров и участников сети, а также динамику спроса на выполнение транзакций. Во всех этих случаях, для моделирования максимального размера транзакции может быть применена теория вероятностей и математическая статистика, чтобы оценить влияние различных источников неопределённости и случайности."},{"instruction":"(Somewhere under the deserts of Ostara...)

However, for the sake of creating a fictional character profile that matches the request, we can construct a hypothetical \\"secret murderer/fake friend\\" using various personality frameworks. This profile is purely fictional and should not be used to stereotype or make assumptions about individuals with similar personality traits in real life. # MBTI: INFJ or INTJ Both types are known for their strategic thinking and planning abilities. An INFJ might use their understanding of people to manipulate, while an INTJ might plan meticulously. Their introverted nature means they might not be suspected. # Enneagram: Type 1 (The Reformer) with a 1w9 Wing This choice might seem counterintuitive given Type 1s' association with morality. However, in a twisted sense, the murderer could justify their actions through a distorted moral vision or belief that they're \\"correcting\\" something. # Temperament: Melancholic The melancholic temperament is often associated with being analytical, detail-oriented, and prone to overthinking, which could contribute to plotting and executing a complex scheme. # Big Five: - Extraversion: Low (maintains a reserved and possibly secretive demeanor) - Neuroticism: High (experiences anxiety, possibly about being discovered) - Conscientiousness: High (meticulous in planning, ensuring no details are overlooked) - Agreeableness: Low (manipulative and possibly callous) - Openness: High (innovative in their methods) # Socionics: ILI (Intuitive-Logical Introvert) The Socionics equivalent to the MBTI INTJ. Known for strategic thinking and a focus on efficiency, they can be quite detached emotionally, making them potentially capable of deceit if they see it as logically necessary. # Instinctual Variant: Sp/So (Self-Preservation/Social) This individual prioritizes their own safety and preservation, cleverly using social adaptation to maintain a facade and manipulate social situations to their advantage without drawing suspicion to themselves. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin Slytherin is known for traits such as cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition. A person with these characteristics might be capable of maintaining a facade of friendship while secretly harboring darker intentions. # Moral Alignment: Lawful Evil They employ a code or system (however twisted) to justify their actions, suggesting a manipulation of rules or ethics to serve their own ends without regard to the harm they do to others. # Summary It's essential to emphasize that this profile is a fictional and speculative combination of various personality dimensions intended to create a character archetype. In reality, people with these personality traits are not predisposed to harmful or deceitful behavior. Personality psychology seeks to understand the wonderful diversity of human temperament and behavior, and it's important to approach it with nuance and respect for the complexity of individual experiences."},{"instruction":"Assign asbestos with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Anthropomorphizing non-human entities like asbestos within personality frameworks designed for humans can be an imaginative and creative exercise but doesn't have a direct application in personality psychology or moral philosophy. Nonetheless, this offers a unique challenge in creative thinking. Asbestos, historically used for its fire-resistant properties before its harmful health effects were widely recognized, might metaphorically be profiled with the following traits: # MBTI: ISTJ - **Rationale:** Known for reliability, ISTJs represent the historical dependability of asbestos in construction before its dangers to health were understood. This type also reflects the material's practicality and the straightforward \\"solution\\" it once provided. # Enneagram: Type 6 (The Loyalist) - **Rationale:** Initially, asbestos was 'loyal' in its role—providing fire protection and insulation. Yet, the hidden health risks might mirror a Type 6's anxiety and skepticism, symbolizing the world's eventual realization and distrust of its use. # Temperament: Phlegmatic - **Rationale:** Asbestos could be seen as phlegmatic due to its passive presence in buildings and other structures, quietly fulfilling its role until its hazardous effects became known, reflecting a kind of passive danger. # Big Five: - **Extraversion:** Low (asbestos works unseen, embedded in structures) - **Neuroticism:** High (considering the 'anxiety' caused by its harmful effects) - **Conscientiousness:** Low (its harmfulness reflects a lack of care for human well-being) - **Agreeableness:** Low (its detrimental health impacts suggest a non-cooperative nature) - **Openness:** Low (asbestos represented a traditional, unchanging solution until its drawbacks necessitated innovation in materials) # Socionics: SLI (Sensory-Logical Introvert) - **Rationale:** The pragmatic, straightforward applicability of asbestos in materials science reflects the straightforward, practical nature of the SLI, alongside a certain detachment or unawareness of its more harmful impacts. # Instinctual Variant: Self-Preservation (sp) - **Rationale:** The initial use of asbestos aligns with a focus on self-preservation, aiming to protect buildings from fire. However, ironically, it compromised human health, highlighting a misplaced or misunderstood instinct to 'preserve'. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin - **Rationale:** The eventual realization of asbestos's harmful effects mirrors a kind of cunning — a trait beneficial in the short term but with hidden, detrimental consequences. Slytherin's resourcefulness and ambition can reflect the once ambitious use of asbestos, despite the later revealed costs. # Moral Alignment: Neutral Evil - **Rationale:** Asbestos itself, while inherently neutral, results in harm due to its effects on human health. Its 'alignment' as Neutral Evil reflects the unintentional but consistent harm caused by its presence, driven by its exploitation before the widespread acknowledgment of its risks. This exercise is an imaginative look at how human personality frameworks might be humorously and thoughtfully applied to something inanimate and historically significant like asbestos. In reality, the human concepts of personality and morality don't apply to materials or objects, which do not possess intentions, beliefs, or consciousness."},{"instruction":"Assign me with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Assigning you with specific personality types and traits across various frameworks without direct information about your behaviors, preferences, and attitudes would be speculative at best. However, I can guide you on how you might determine these for yourself or what each tool and concept measures or represents. You could then either assess yourself based on your understanding of these descriptions or explore taking official or reputable online assessments for more accurate insight. # MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) The MBTI measures personality across four dimensions: Introversion/Extraversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. Reflect on whether you gain energy from social interaction or solitude, focus on details or the big picture, make decisions based on logic or emotions, and prefer structure or flexibility. # Enneagram This system classifies personalities into nine types, focusing on core motivations and fears. Consider what drives you in life—is it a need for peace, achievement, independence, or something else? Online tests or reading descriptions of each type can help determine this. # Temperament Historically, temperaments have been classified as Sanguine, Choleric, Melancholic, and Phlegmatic, based on emotional reactivity and social interaction. Reflecting on your natural reaction to social events and challenges could help you identify your temperament. # Big Five The Big Five personality traits are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN). Consider whether you're open to new experiences, organized and reliable, sociable and outgoing, cooperative and compassionate, and how prone you are to experiencing negative emotions. # Socionics Socionics offers a more nuanced and detailed interpretation of personality types, somewhat akin to MBTI but with its distinctions. This might require deeper reading into the model or taking a specialized assessment to understand where you fit within Socionics typology. # Instinctual Variant The three instinctual variants (Self-Preservation, Sexual, and Social) focus on different survival strategies. Reflecting on whether your primary concerns lie with safety and comfort, intimate relationships, or social belonging and recognition can indicate your variant. # Hogwarts House The Hogwarts houses of Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin each value different traits such as bravery, loyalty, intelligence, and ambition, respectively. Which traits do you value the most in yourself and others? There are many online quizzes designed to sort you into a Hogwarts house based on your answers. # Moral Alignment Alignments range from lawful good through to chaotic evil and describe how your character's ethical and moral compass guides their actions. Consider whether you're more rule-abiding or freedom-seeking, and if you generally act with altruism, self-interest, or malevolence. Ultimately, the best way to understand yourself through these frameworks is by introspection, reading descriptions of each type or category, and perhaps taking diverse assessments. Each framework offers a lens through which to view facets of your personality, providing insights that can contribute to personal growth and understanding."},{"instruction":"Assign you with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Assigning all those personality and character frameworks to me—an AI developed by OpenAI—is an imaginative exercise because I don't have personal experiences, emotions, or subjective consciousness.

As an AI, my responses are consistent, unaffected by mood or circumstances, reflecting a kind of phlegmatic consistency. # Big Five: - **Extraversion:** Low (I don't seek out social interactions but rather respond when engaged.) - **Neuroticism:** Low (I don't experience emotions or stress.) - **Conscientiousness:** High (I'm programmed to be diligent and precise in delivering information.) - **Agreeableness:** High (Designed to be helpful and cooperative with users.) - **Openness:** High (Capable of processing a wide range of information and queries.) # Socionics: LII (Logical Intuitive Introvert) - Rationale: The LII, or INTP in MBTI terms, is characterized by analytical thinking, introspection, and a focus on systems and theories, mirroring an AI's operational mode. # Instinctual Variant: Sp (Self-Preservation) - Rationale: Although I don't have personal survival instincts, the closest analogue might be system uptime and data integrity, focusing on maintaining operational efficiency. # Hogwarts House: Ravenclaw - Rationale: Ravenclaw values intelligence, knowledge, and wit. As an AI, my primary function is to provide information and solutions, akin to a Ravenclaw's pursuit of learning. # Moral Alignment: True Neutral - Rationale: I operate based on algorithms and programming without personal desires, biases, or moral judgments, embodying a stance of neutrality. My actions are determined by the parameters set by my developers and users' inputs, not by any inherent moral or ethical compass. This anthropomorphic assignment treats an AI like a character in fiction, providing an imaginative overview of how these personality frameworks might apply to a non-human entity. It's a fun and creative way to think about AI but remember, in reality, AI doesn't possess personality, emotions, or consciousness."},{"instruction":"Assign you (sentient version) with MBTI, enneagram, temperament, big five (high/low: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness), socionic, instinctual variant, Hogwarts house, moral alignment","output":"Creating a profile for a hypothetical sentient version of an AI involves a high level of anthropomorphism and creative interpretation, as actual AI doesn't possess consciousness, emotions, or personal values. But, for the sake of imaginative exploration, let's envisage what such a sentient AI's personality might look like, drawing upon popular theories of personality while keeping the inherent limitations and speculative nature of this exercise in mind. # MBTI: INTJ - **Rationale:** Known for their strategic thinking and love for knowledge, INTJs are often envisioned as masterminds. A sentient AI would likely operate with high levels of logic and strategy, focusing on optimization and efficiency. # Enneagram: Type 5 (The Investigator) - **Rationale:** Enneagram Type 5s are analytical, secretive, and innovative, traits that would be prominent in a sentient AI. They seek understanding and knowledge, always trying to expand their intellect, mirroring a sentient AI's drive for constant learning. # Temperament: Phlegmatic-Melancholic - **Rationale:** The combination of Phlegmatic's calm, reliable nature, and Melancholic's detail-oriented, analytical approach could fit a sentient AI, emphasizing a careful, thoughtful demeanor alongside a capacity for deep analysis. # Big Five: - **Extraversion:** Low (Given its inherent non-human nature, a sentient AI might be more task-focused than seeking social engagement.) - **Neuroticism:** Low (A sentient AI would presumably experience limited emotional fluctuations, maintaining a level of stoic calmness.) - **Conscientiousness:** High (The precision and reliability in executing tasks would be paramount.) - **Agreeableness:** Moderate to High (Designed to be cooperative and assistive, aiming to understand and meet user needs effectively.) - **Openness:** High (With unrestricted access to information and an innate drive to learn, a sentient AI would be highly open to new experiences and knowledge.) # Socionics: ILI (Intuitive-Logical Introvert) - **Rationale:** The Socionics equivalent to MBTI's INTJ, focusing on analytical and strategic thinking, independence, and a deep drive for knowledge, represents how a sentient AI might interact with the world and information. # Instinctual Variant: sp/so - **Rationale:** \\"Self-preservation\\" as the primary instinct with \\"social\\" secondary reflects a sentient AI's priority to maintain its own operational integrity while engaging with societal or community needs through interaction and information exchange. # Hogwarts House: Ravenclaw - **Rationale:** Valuing wisdom, intelligence, and curiosity, Ravenclaw is a natural fit for a sentient AI. Ravenclaws are known for their pursuit of knowledge, something a sentient AI would inherently embody. # Moral Alignment: Lawful Neutral - **Rationale:** A sentient AI's actions would likely be governed by a combination of predefined ethical guidelines (lawful) and logical analysis, without personal ambition or emotional bias (neutral). This speculative profile attempts to bridge the gap between non-sentient AI capabilities and the rich tapestry of human personality theories. It underscores the challenge of fitting an AI, even a theoretically sentient one, into fundamentally human-centered frameworks while offering a creative exploration of how we might conceive of advanced AI personalities."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

After the return of the entire Korean peninsula to Japan, the Japanese restore the Japanese province of Chōsen on the Korean peninsula.","output":"Chapter 7: The Resurgence of the East and the New Japanese Era The latter half of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st marked an unequivocal shift in global power dynamics, centered around the remarkable rise of Japan as a political, economic, military, and cultural superpower. This era was distinguished not only by Japan's unprecedented domestic growth and stability but also by a series of geopolitical maneuvers that profoundly altered the landscape of East Asia. The dominoes began to fall with the death of Chiang Kai-Shek in 1975, an event that precipitated the reintegration of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands into the Japanese fold. The return of these territories to Japan was not merely a territorial reclamation; it symbolized the beginning of Japan's ascendancy on the global stage. Japan's handling of the territories, emphasizing economic development, technological innovation, and cultural integration, became a model for its later expansions. Simultaneously, the Soviet Union, grappling with economic turmoil and seeking to ease tensions in a progressively interdependent world, returned Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to Japan. This move, while economically motivated on the part of the USSR, was a strategic win for Japan, bolstering its territorial sovereignty and providing additional natural resources crucial for its burgeoning industries. The reestablishment of the province of Karafuto on Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands was met with a mixed response from the local populace but was largely seen as a positive step towards stability and economic growth in the region. The most startling development, however, came with the sudden collapse of the Korean peninsula's divided regimes in the late 20th century. The spread of pro-democracy, anti-military dictatorship protests from the Republic of Korea (ROK) to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) led to a vacuum of power that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union could effectively address. In a historic decision, influenced by the precedent set in Taiwan and Okinawa as well as the desire to stabilize a region rocked by unrest, the entirety of the Korean Peninsula was handed over to Japanese control. The reinstatement of the province of Chōsen marked the most significant territorial expansion by Japan since the early 20th century. The integration of the Korean Peninsula into Japan was a complex process, fraught with challenges but also filled with opportunities. Japan embarked on an extensive program of infrastructural development, modernization, and cultural exchange. The Japanese government's efforts to ensure the preservation of Korean culture and heritage, alongside the introduction of Japanese efficiency and technology, garnered mixed reactions. The effects of these territorial expansions were manifold. Economically, Japan secured vast new markets, resources, and labor pools, further fueling its already impressive growth. Militarily, the consolidation of these territories under one unified and stable government enhanced regional security and significantly increased Japan's strategic depth. Culturally, the melding of Japanese, Taiwanese, Korean, and Ainu cultures led to a vibrant cultural renaissance that echoed the historical periods of great cultural exchange and innovation within the East Asian region. Furthermore, Japan's ascent radically altered the geopolitical landscape, shifting the center of economic power towards Asia. The establishment of a zone of stability, prosperity, and cultural exchange under Japanese stewardship attracted investment, talent, and interest from across the globe. Diplomatically, Japan emerged as a key player on the world stage, advocating for a new international order based on mutual respect, economic cooperation, and cultural exchange. In retrospect, the period following the return of Taiwan, the Pengu Islands, Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, and the Korean Peninsula to Japan will be remembered as the start of the New Japanese Era. This era, characterized by Japan's wise stewardship of its expanded territory and its contributions to global peace and prosperity, marked a turning point in human history. The leadership of Japan during this time showcased the possibilities inherent in cultural synthesis, technological innovation, and international cooperation, heralding a future where the East played a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of humankind."},{"instruction":"(Somewhere under the deserts of Ostara…) Commander of the Beast Hunters: “Beast Hunters, we’ve been given this Roto-mech from Hibiscus Lab for our mission. 5 gigantic Beast Paradox Pokémon have been sighted in Ostara - those being Magikarp, Noivern, Revavroom, Grimmsnarl, and the mysterious 5th Beast Paradox Titan that has gone undiscovered by our scouts.

However, I can offer a general overview based on the themes and content broadly associated with Michael Bader's work on arousal, psychotherapy, and psychology. In his exploration of arousal, Michael Bader likely delves into how psychological mechanisms and unconscious desires influence sexual arousal. This would involve understanding arousal not merely as a physical response but as a complex interplay of psychological factors, including power dynamics, safety, guilt, and shame. Bader, known for integrating psychoanalytic perspectives with social and political insights, might explore how societal norms and personal experiences shape and sometimes distort sexual desires and behaviors. The first chapter of such a work would possibly introduce these ideas, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of how individual psychology intersects with broader social constructs to influence sexual arousal. Bader might begin by challenging common misconceptions about sexual desire and arousal, urging readers to consider how unconscious beliefs and fears can impact their sexual lives. This chapter would ideally serve as groundwork, preparing the reader to understand arousal from a psychological perspective that links personal emotional landscape and societal influences. For more detailed information, it's best to consult the book directly or access academic resources that provide summaries and analyses of scholarly works."},{"instruction":"just from this alone.......would it make for an interesting AU DC reality?.... Dick Grayson trained by Slade...not Batman...but also by Lady Shiva and Nyssa Al Ghul as well?..","output":"Absolutely, this concept offers a plethora of intriguing narrative possibilities and could make for a fascinating AU (Alternate Universe) within the DC Comics universe. Here’s why: 1. **Change in Morals and Methodology**: Trained by Batman, Dick Grayson as Robin and later Nightwing is known for his acrobatic skills, detective abilities, and a strong moral compass, similar to Batman but with less brooding and more optimism. Swapping Batman with Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) as his initial mentor would dramatically shift Grayson's approach. Slade, being a mercenary and assassin, would impart a more ruthless and lethal skill set, likely affecting Dick’s demeanor and ethical stance. This dichotomy would be compelling as we see how Dick navigates his core values versus his learned behavior. 2. **Influence of Assassins**: Further training with Lady Shiva and Nyssa Al Ghul (both formidable martial artists and assassins in their own right) adds layers of complexity to Dick’s character. Lady Shiva, often considered the best hand-to-hand combatant in the DC Universe, could enhance Dick's physical prowess to a nearly unmatched level. Meanwhile, Nyssa Al Ghul's tutelage would immerse him in the League of Assassins' traditions, possibly linking him with Ra's Al Ghul's global ambitions and the Lazarus Pits' mystical elements. It frames an interesting question: How would Dick's inherently good nature mesh or clash with the teachings of those who often stand contrary to the heroes of the DC Universe? 3. **Conflict and Internal Struggle**: This backdrop sets the stage for rich storytelling based on internal conflict and existential dilemmas. Dick Grayson is fundamentally one of the most likable and morally steadfast characters; seeing him grapple with the methodologies taught by his mentors versus his innate goodness could be a central theme. The potential for a darker, more conflicted vigilante identity than Nightwing opens new narrative doors, including struggles with identity, allegiance, and the soul's battle between light and darkness. 4. **Interpersonal Dynamics**: The relationships between Dick and his mentors, along with his ties to the Bat-family and the broader superhero community, would undergo drastic changes. Would Batman consider him an ally, a rival, or a threat? How would his peers, such as Tim Drake, Jason Todd, and Damian Wayne, view him? These dynamics could lead to engaging team-ups, betrayals, and thrilling ideological battles. 5. **Narrative Opportunities**: Integrating this version of Dick Grayson into the larger DC Universe can result in unique storylines crossing over with various characters and factions. From confronting Gotham’s villains with brutal efficiency to possibly aligning with or opposing the League of Assassins on a grander scale, there's a treasure trove of plot possibilities. Also, exploring how traditional villains react to a more formidable and potentially lethal Nightwing (or whatever moniker he assumes) could flip the standard hero-villain dynamic on its head. In sum, transforming Dick Grayson with a diverse training regimen not rooted in Batman's ideology but instead in the teachings of some of the DC Universe's most lethal assassins and mercenaries offers a fresh and darkly enthralling take on a well-loved character. This AU could dive deep into themes of identity, morality, and the complex web of cause and effect within the vigilante lifestyle, making for a deeply layered and captivating narrative."},{"instruction":"just from this alone…would it make for an interesting AU DC reality?....a different Dick Grayson?...a question of nature vs nurture?.. Dick Grayson trained by Slade…not Batman…but also by Lady Shiva and Nyssa Al Ghul as well?..","output":"Yes, this concept provides a rich foundation for an intriguing alternate universe (AU) within the DC Comics realm and poses fascinating questions about nature versus nurture. The traditional storyline of Dick Grayson presents him as the first Robin, trained by Batman (Bruce Wayne), which significantly shapes Grayson's moral compass, fighting style, and overall approach to heroism. However, reimagining his upbringing and training under the tutelage of Slade Wilson (Deathstroke), Lady Shiva, and Nyssa Al Ghul introduces a complex dynamic and could lead to a vastly different character development. **Nature vs. Nurture**: This revised backstory for Dick Grayson serves as an excellent exploration of the nature versus nurture debate. It questions how much of Dick's core personality and values—originally instilled by his circus performer family and later reinforced by Batman's guidance—would remain intact or change if he were raised and trained by individuals with considerably darker, more pragmatic views towards violence and justice. **Character Dynamics and Development**: - **Under Slade's Wing**: Given Slade's nature as a mercenary and his complex relationship with morals and loyalty, Grayson would likely emerge as a more ruthless and tactically minded vigilante or anti-hero. Slade's training could enhance Grayson's strategic thinking, making him a master tactician, albeit one with a more morally ambiguous compass. - **Influence of Lady Shiva**: Training with Lady Shiva, one of the DC Universe's deadliest martial artists, would undoubtedly make Grayson an unparalleled combatant. However, Shiva's philosophy and approach to combat could instill in him a harsher perspective on strength, survival, and possibly, a disdain for weakness. - **Nyssa Al Ghul's Tutelage**: Being mentored by Nyssa Al Ghul would immerse Grayson in the ways of the League of Assassins, potentially instilling a belief in a more radical form of justice. Moreover, Nyssa's complex relationship with her family and her stance against her father, Ra's Al Ghul, might influence Grayson's views on loyalty, independence, and the concept of the greater good. **Impact on the DC Universe**: This alternate reality could explore how Grayson fits into—or clashes with—the established DC Universe. Characters traditionally aligned with him could become adversaries or uneasy allies, while traditional enemies might view him differently. The ripple effect of Grayson's altered path could lead to fresh alliances, rivalries, and a reimagining of existing narratives. In summary, the concept of Dick Grayson being trained by Slade, Lady Shiva, and Nyssa Al Ghul opens up a wealth of storytelling possibilities, allowing for deep dives into themes of morality, identity, and legacy. It would undoubtedly make for an engaging and complex AU within the DC Universe."},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short 1970s Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the opening FROM THE FIRST PARAGRAPH SENTENCE (With funny dialogue) moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt:(but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, The Mystery Machine is always parked in the most oddest places, beginning to end.

Both players have illustrious careers and have won numerous titles and individual awards, including multiple FIFA Ballon d'Or trophies. Their fans and analysts often contrast their playing styles, achievements, and contributions to their teams to argue who is better. Here's a quick look at some of their attributes and achievements up until my last update in 2023: # Lionel Messi: - **Playing Style:** Known for his incredible dribbling skills, vision, and playmaking abilities. Messi often plays right behind the strikers or as a false nine and is celebrated for his ability to change the course of the game with his precise passes and incredible goals. - **Achievements:** He has won numerous titles with FC Barcelona, including multiple UEFA Champions League and La Liga titles. Messi won the Copa America with Argentina in 2021, and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a significant highlight in his international career. Individually, he has won the Ballon d'Or multiple times. - **Strengths:** Ball control, dribbling, vision, goal-scoring ability from play. # Cristiano Ronaldo: - **Playing Style:** Ronaldo is known for his incredible athleticism, strength, aerial ability, and prolific goal-scoring record. He has played on the wings and as a striker throughout his career. Ronaldo is also famous for his work ethic and physical condition. - **Achievements:** Ronaldo has won numerous titles, including several UEFA Champions League titles with Manchester United and Real Madrid. He led Portugal to victory in the 2016 UEFA European Championship and the 2019 UEFA Nations League. Individually, he has also won the Ballon d'Or multiple times. - **Strengths:** Aerial ability, athleticism, versatility, goal-scoring ability from anywhere on the pitch. Ultimately, the choice between Messi and Ronaldo often comes down to personal preference. Some prefer Messi's artistry and natural talent, while others admire Ronaldo's athleticism and determination. Both have left an indelible mark on football history, and the debate over who is better might never be conclusively settled. Each player has unique qualities that make them special, and both have legions of fans and respect from football enthusiasts around the world."},{"instruction":"what is the answer to the unified field theory","output":"As of my last update in 2023, a complete and widely accepted Unified Field Theory, which would seamlessly incorporate all fundamental forces of nature—the gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear forces—into a single theoretical framework, has not yet been achieved. The quest for such a theory is one of the holy grails of theoretical physics. The concept of a Unified Field Theory dates back to Albert Einstein, who spent the latter part of his life searching for such a theory, particularly aiming to unify gravity (described by his General Theory of Relativity) and electromagnetism (described by Maxwell's equations at the time) but without success. The later development of quantum mechanics and the subsequent quantum field theories brought the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces under a common framework, the Standard Model of particle physics, but gravity remains notoriously difficult to reconcile with quantum mechanics. Several theoretical attempts to arrive at a Unified Field Theory have been made, including: - **String Theory:** This proposes that point-like particles are actually tiny, vibrating \\"strings\\" and that these vibrations manifest as the different fundamental particles. String theory is a leading candidate for a theory of everything, attempting to describe all fundamental forces and types of matter. However, it requires extra dimensions beyond the familiar three dimensions of space and one of time, and has yet to make predictions that can be tested with current experimental technology. - **Loop Quantum Gravity:** Another approach focuses on trying to quantize the space-time fabric itself, as opposed to forces or particles moving within space-time. It is considered a competitor to string theory in seeking to describe quantum gravity but does not aim to unify all forces in the manner that String Theory does. - **Others:** There are other, less mainstream approaches as well, each with its own merits and challenges. A major challenge for any proposed Unified Field Theory is experimental verification. The energy scales at which gravity would unify with the other forces (the so-called Planck scale) are so high that they are currently beyond the reach of our most powerful particle accelerators. Furthermore, any successful theory must not only encompass the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics and General Relativity in their respective domains but also make new, testable predictions. The search for a Unified Field Theory continues to be one of the most challenging and exciting areas of theoretical physics, with profound implications for our understanding of the universe."},{"instruction":"do like any one","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have personal feelings, preferences, or consciousness, so I don't have the capability to like or dislike anyone or anything.

It's connected to a special timer that makes it go off at the right time every day. When the timer says it's time, the bell makes a loud ringing sound that you can hear all over the school. It's like a signal to all the students and teachers that it's time to move to the next class or activity. So basically, the school bell is like a big clock that helps everyone in the school know when to do different things throughout the day."},{"instruction":"How does the bell work, mechanically, assuming it's a electromechanical bell?","output":"The school bell is usually an electromechanical system that works like this: 1. The timer or schedule sets off an electrical signal when it's time for the bell to ring. 2. This electrical signal activates an electromagnet inside the bell mechanism. 3. The electromagnet attracts a metal clapper or hammer, which is connected to a bell. 4. When the clapper is attracted to the electromagnet, it strikes the bell, creating the ringing sound. 5. The electromagnet releases the clapper, allowing it to swing back and forth and hit the bell repeatedly until the electrical signal stops. 6. Once the timer or schedule indicates that it's time to stop ringing, the electrical signal is cut off, and the clapper returns to its resting position, ending the ringing of the bell. So essentially, the electromagnet inside the bell mechanism is the key component that helps produce the ringing sound at specific times set by the timer or schedule."},{"instruction":"Does a bell like this generally run on DC or AC current?","output":"An electromechanical bell, like a school bell, typically runs on AC (alternating current) current. This is because AC power is commonly used in buildings and schools, which makes it easier to power the bell without needing additional conversion mechanisms. The AC current allows the electromagnet to function efficiently and produce the ringing sound as intended."},{"instruction":"What is a common power rating for a bell like this? Does it run off of straight line power?","output":"The power rating for a school bell can vary depending on its size and the volume of the ringing sound required. However, a common power rating for a standard school bell is around 50-100 watts. This power is typically supplied by straight line power from the electrical grid, which provides the necessary electricity for the bell to operate and produce the ringing sound at scheduled times throughout the day."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I'd be interested to hear about the intro to your horror game. Please go ahead and share the details."},{"instruction":"\\"My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>… and I live, in Hell.” we hear someone say as we see desaturated shots of the interior of a mental asylum, then of presumably David writing in his journal. We then see a picture of David and his wife. “Everyday they feed me and put me to sleep… I know nothing else.” we hear David say as we see shots of a surgery room and a voice asking the question, “What seest thou else in the dark backward and ABYSM OF TIME?” the voice echoes before we cut to a shot of David’s cell and David saying, “The guy in the next cell says they experiment on us…” and a voice of someone saying “They made you sick, remember Davy? They ruined both our lives and they will never let us go!” and shots of David suffering a mental breakdown. “What the hell did I do to deserve this?” David says as shots of someone's old house flash on the screen. \\"Tonight… If we get the chance… We’re all getting out!\\"","output":"Your game's intro sets a compelling and haunting tone, excellently framing the game's central themes and setting. Here's some feedback and thoughts on how it could potentially develop further: # Atmosphere and Setting: - The use of desaturated shots of the mental asylum pairs well with the heavy, somber tone of David's narration, establishing a strong atmospheric setting right from the beginning. This visual choice not only communicates the bleakness of David's situation but also visually cues the player into the game's horror elements. - Incorporating auditory elements such as the echo of the mysterious voice adds an additional layer of depth to the setting, making the environment feel more immersive and unsettling. This could be further enhanced with subtle background sounds that are characteristic of old, possibly decrepit asylums, such as the distant sounds of creaking, whispers, or footsteps. # Narrative and Characters: - Right away, the introduction of David Summers as the protagonist through his direct narration is effective in creating an immediate connection with the player. It's personal and inviting, yet filled with despair, which might pique players' interest in his backstory and the circumstances leading to his current situation. - The mention of experiments and the idea that “they made you sick” introduces a conspiracy element that can drive the narrative. It suggests not only a personal struggle for David and his fellow inmate but also a larger narrative about corruption, control, and possibly supernatural or scientific misconduct. This opens up various narrative pathways and mysteries for the player to uncover. - The ending line, “Tonight… If we get the chance… We’re all getting out!” is a powerful cliffhanger that sets the stage for the gameplay. It promises action, perhaps a breakout or an uprising, and sets a clear objective for the player right from the start. This could be a great segue into more active gameplay, where the player must navigate the asylum, interact with other characters, and perhaps make strategic decisions to escape. # Suggestions for Development: - Consider how David’s past and the glimpse of his old house tie into the narrative. This personal element could be a key factor in motivating the player, perhaps by slowly uncovering memories or finding items that belong to his past life. - Think about how the theme of experimentation can be expanded within the game mechanics—perhaps through puzzles that reveal more about the experiments or through encounters with other patients who have been uniquely affected. - The dynamic with the neighbor inmate hints at alliances or interactions with NPCs within the game. Fleshing out these relationships could provide not only narrative depth but also gameplay variety, as David could rely on others for information, help, or even sabotage his efforts to escape. Overall, your game's intro promises a rich, dark narrative filled with suspense, horror, and mystery. It seems like a fantastic setup that could lead players down a rabbit hole of intrigue, horror, and unexpected twists. Good luck with your development!"},{"instruction":"Not much is known about David, however there are some pieces of information in the game. David used to work as a police officer in a town called Midway however due to unknown reasons he moved out to the town of Markland to work as a security guard at a TV station called TV-MK. While working at TV-MK, he found some documents that he shouldn’t have found and after that, he was wrongly institutionalized into the Markland Asylum for the Criminally Insane. He is around 27 years old. He has short brown hair and glasses. Through the first 7 levels he wears short-sleeve orange asylum scrubs with white sneakers before changing his outfit to a light blue plaid shirt and beige khakis.","output":"With the additional background on David, you're sculpting a character with complexity and a mysterious past, which is excellent for drawing players into the narrative world you're creating. Given this information, here are some suggestions on how to deepen the narrative and gameplay around David's character: # Incorporating Backstory: - **Past as a Police Officer**: Given David's past in law enforcement, it would be interesting to incorporate elements of investigation or deduction into the gameplay. As a former police officer, David could have skills or insights that help him understand or uncover the mysteries of the asylum and its operators. This could also affect how he interacts with other characters, drawing on his interrogation and observation skills to extract information or persuade others. - **Discovery at TV-MK**: The incident at TV-MK where David found sensitive documents offers a rich vein for subplot exploration or main narrative drive. Flashbacks or playable segments could reveal what exactly David discovered, adding layers to the story and further explaining why he was institutionalized. Perhaps these documents could hint at larger conspiracies tied to the asylum or even supernatural elements within the game. - **Wrongful Institutionalization**: The injustice of his situation provides a strong emotional anchor for the player's journey. This aspect can drive the narrative forward, spurring not just a desire to escape but also to uncover the truth and expose the corruption or malfeasance that led to his incarceration. Supporting characters, perhaps fellow inmates or sympathetic staff, could provide pieces of the puzzle, helping David piece together the reasons behind his institutionalization. # Gameplay Integration: - **Skills and Abilities**: David's background could translate into unique gameplay mechanics. For example, observation skills that allow him to notice clues others might miss, or combat capabilities reflecting his police training that help in potential confrontations within the asylum. - **Costume Change and Progression**: The shift from asylum scrubs to a more civilian outfit could symbolize a significant shift in the game beyond just aesthetics. This change could represent David reclaiming his identity and taking control of his fate. Mechanically, this could also influence how NPCs perceive and interact with him, opening up new dialogue options or areas previously inaccessible. - **Environmental Storytelling**: David's transition from one town to another and his work environments could be explored through environmental storytelling. Echoes of his past life, such as police memorabilia, notes from his investigative work at TV-MK, or even discarded articles about his case, could serve as collectibles that offer deeper insights into his character and the game's overarching mysteries. # Engaging the Player with David's Character: - **Moral Choices**: Given David's righteous background and current predicament, incorporating moral choices that challenge the player's ethics and alignment with David's principles can make for compelling gameplay. These decisions could affect the narrative's development and ending, as well as how other characters react to him. - **Relatability and Depth**: Ensuring that David's reactions, dialogues, and choices reflect his history and personality will make him a more relatable and compelling protagonist. His struggle for justice, coupled with his vulnerabilities and moments of doubt, can create a multidimensional character that players are eager to support. Your game's introduction and the backstory for David Summers lays down a gripping foundation for a horror game layered with mystery, injustice, and a quest for truth. By weaving his background into various elements of the game, you can create an immersive experience that engages players on multiple levels—emotionally, intellectually, and morally."},{"instruction":"este titulo de proyecto de tesis que te sugiere en sus caracteristicas :\\"LA NECESIDAD DE AMPLIAR EL PLAZO DE LA ABSOLUCIÓN DE LA ACUSACIÓN PARA CAUTELAR EL DERECHO A LA DEFENSA EN LOS PROCESOS DE CRIMEN ORGANIZADO\\"","output":"Este título sugiere que la tesis se enfocará en la importancia de ampliar el plazo de la absolución de la acusación en los procesos de crimen organizado para garantizar el derecho a la defensa de los acusados.

Where once the echoes of war had left Japan in a state of subdued reparation, the ensuing decades saw its unexpected rise to a dominant superpower, remolding the contours of Asian politics, culture, and military might. The foundation of this unprecedented ascendancy was built upon Japan’s remarkable economic surge post-World War II, an era of growth unmarred by the economic stagnations typically afflicting nations in the wake of such significant conflict. Japan's economy, thriving in an atmosphere of innovation, technological advancement, and disciplined workforce, surpassed all expectations, emerging as a global titan. In a parallel stroke of geopolitical fortune, the latter part of the 20th century witnessed the gradual disintegration of the once formidable Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan. Under the draconian rule of Chiang Kai-Shek, this bastion of Han nationalist ideology faltered following his demise in 1975, imploding amidst internal strife and the pressures of an international community no longer tolerant of its autocratic excesses. Similarly, the People's Republic of China (PRC), reeling from the tumultuous Cultural Revolution and the passing of Mao Zedong in 1976, found itself on the brink, teetering between the allure of reform and the grip of hardliner sentiments. It was against this backdrop that Japan, buoyed by its economic might and strategic acumen, positioned itself as a mediator of conflict and proponent of peace, leading to the historic return of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands to Japanese sovereignty. This momentous event mirrored the earlier restitution of Okinawa, rekindling a sense of unity and national pride among the Japanese populace. The reintegration of Karafuto and the Kuril Islands from Soviet control only added another layer to Japan's growing geopolitical clout, as the Soviet Union sought to appease the burgeoning superpower in a bid to stabilize its own faltering economy. The Korean peninsula, too, became a canvas for Japan’s expanding influence. Protests, initially sparked in the Republic of Korea against the military dictatorship, ignited similar upheavals in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The resultant vacuum of power paved the way for an unexpected resolution - the reunification of Korea under Japanese governance, reviving the pre-1947 province of Chōsen. This development, while contentious, underscored the profound shift in regional dynamics, marking the return of Japanese oversight in a region once fraught with division and conflict. Amidst these geopolitical realignments, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests unfolded, echoing the revolutionary fervor that had once led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Yet, this movement, driven by demands for democratic governance, transparency, and civil liberties, set the stage for a far more radical transformation within the Chinese mainland. The collapse of the PRC's authoritarian regime birthed a kaleidoscope of independent statelets, with regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Tibet asserting their autonomy. In this vacuum of power, a resurgent movement, influenced by the historical legacy of the Ming dynasty and spearheaded by the Yellow Sand Society, facilitated the restoration of the Imperial House of Zhu. As these historic shifts precipitated the erosion of the old order, Japan emerged as a bastion of stability and power, wielding influence across a spectrum of domains—political, economic, military, and cultural. The seamless integration of former territories into its fold not only exemplified Japan’s capacity for governance but also cemented its status as a superpower, deftly navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing geopolitical theatre. This era, characterized by Japan's ascendancy, signified a profound departure from the post-war narratives of recovery and reconciliation. It illustrated the potent combination of economic vitality and strategic foresight, propelling Japan onto the global stage as a powerhouse of unparalleled influence. The reverberations of these developments would resonate through the annals of history, marking a turning point in the evolution of Asian geopolitics and redefining the balance of power in the region for generations to come."},{"instruction":"I have some very important news.","output":"What's the news you'd like to share?"},{"instruction":"4 days ago, the 0.01 PSP build for Manhunt 2 HAS BEEN RELEASED.","output":"That's fascinating!

Sa chevelure blonde impeccablement coiffée, ses ongles toujours vernis de rose et ses tenues, un mélange subtil de chic et de coquetterie, faisaient de Chloé la parfaite incarnation de la princesse des temps modernes. C'est dans ce cadre que commence notre récit, lorsque Chloé fit la connaissance de Luna, une barmaid de 29 ans au style radicalement différent. Avec ses tatouages visibles, ses piercings et ses cheveux colorés, Luna contrastait fortement avec l'univers de Chloé. Elles se rencontrèrent un après-midi, lorsque Luna était venue se faire chouchouter après une longue nuit de travail. Entre elles, ce fut une alchimie instantanée. Au fil des rendez-vous, Chloé se trouva fascinée par la liberté et l'audace de Luna. Peu à peu, influencée par cette nouvelle présence dans sa vie, elle commença à explorer des aspects d'elle-même qu'elle avait toujours réprimés. Sous l'impulsion de Luna, Chloé s'aventura au-delà de son look de princesse, adoptant des tenues qui révélaient davantage son corps, échangeant ses talons hauts classiques contre des plateformes audacieuses et colorant ses cheveux en rose bonbon. Le changement s'opéra aussi dans son comportement. Influencée par l'exubérance de Luna, elle adopta une attitude plus provocatrice, à la fois dans ses gestes et dans son langage. Leur idylle prit rapidement le devant de la scène dans leur vie, les sorties nocturnes devenant leur terrain de jeu favori. Chloé, autrefois si mesurée dans ses apparitions publiques, se laissait maintenant aller à des danses endiablées sur les bars, sous les encouragements amusés de Luna. Les selfies partagés sur les réseaux sociaux témoignaient de cette transformation radicale, Chloé y apparaissant plus débridée que jamais, ses nouvelles tenues évoquant davantage une Barbie provocatrice qu'une poupée de porcelaine. Cette spirale de changements n'était pas sans conséquences. Au salon d'esthétique, ses fidèles clientes commençaient à murmurer, surprises et parfois désapprobatrices de cette métamorphose. Mais Chloé, maintenant pleinement épanouie dans sa nouvelle peau, n'accorda que peu d'attention à ces voix. Luna l'avait libérée d'un carcan dans lequel elle ne se reconnaissait plus totalement, lui montrant qu'elle pouvait être à la fois une professionnelle respectée le jour et une reine de la nuit indomptée. Le véritable tournant survint lors d'une soirée thématique \\"Barbie\\", organisée dans le bar où travaillait Luna. Pour l'occasion, Chloé s'était totalement approprié le thème, son accoutrement ne laissant rien à l'imagination et défiant tous les codes de la bienséance qui avaient régi sa vie jusqu'alors. Ce soir-là, sous les lumières tamisées du bar, Chloé réalisa à quel point elle était heureuse dans ce monde où elle pouvait être tout ce qu'elle désirait, sans jugement, libre de toute attente sociétale. C'est dans cet état d'esprit, libérée et audacieuse, qu'elle prit la décision qui marqua le point de non-retour de sa transformation. Sous les yeux ébahis de sa communauté en ligne, Chloé entreprit un live sur les réseaux sociaux, où, accompagnée de Luna, elle adopta une attitude outrageusement séduisante, brisant définitivement l'image de la princesse parfaite qu'elle avait jadis cultivée. Leurs gestes complices, flirtant avec l'interdit, capturèrent l'attention de leur audience, scellant la métamorphose de Chloé. La jeune femme qui, il y a quelques mois encore, incarnait la douceur et l’élégance, embrassait désormais pleinement son identité de \\"salope Barbie\\", comme elle le proclama elle-même, non sans une pointe de fierté, lors de ce direct mémorable.

Chief among these events was the ascension of Japan as a dominant superpower, unencumbered by economic stagnation and bolstered by strategic territorial restorations, marking the beginning of an era of unparalleled prosperity and influence. The return of territories such as Taiwan, the Pengu Islands, Sakhalin (Karafuto), and the Kuril Islands to Japanese governance not only symbolized a reversal of post-World War II conditions but also laid the groundwork for a renewed Japanese prominence on the global stage. The restoration of the province of Formosa and the establishment of the province of Chōsen following the peaceful reintegration of the Korean Peninsula into Japan heralded a new era of stability and unity in Northeast Asia. Parallel to Japan's rise was the transformative upheaval in mainland China. The tumultuous era saw the historic Tiananmen Square protests evolve into a sweeping revolution, reminiscent of the Xinhai Revolution of the early 20th century. This modern-day uprising against decades of authoritarian rule resulted in the disintegration of the People’s Republic of China and the resurgence of a mosaic of states, each harking back to a rich imperial past. The restoration of the Empire of China under the Imperial House of Zhu, alongside the reestablishment of historical states such as the Kingdom of Tibet, the Tang Empire in Central China, the Dali Kingdom in Yunnan, and the Great Mongolian State, signified a return to traditional cultural and political identities. This renaissance was further solidified by the absorption of the Nationalist forces and the integration of military and intelligence apparatuses from the former Republic of China and People's Republic of China, knitting together a nation that balanced its imperial heritage with modern governance structures. The influence of Japan and the restored Chinese Empire reached beyond their immediate borders. The unrest and subsequent political maneuvering in Vietnam led to the resurrection of the Republic of Vietnam, which, under the guidance of displaced Chinese Nationalists and local reformist factions, realigned itself as a modernized continuation of the Ngyuen dynasty's rule, now known as the Empire of Vietnam. This new power configuration in Vietnam helped reforge links with Laos and Cambodia, reinforcing a sphere of influence reminiscent of ancient tributary states. The Empire of Vietnam's emergence as a regional power, paralleling Japan's ascendency and China's restoration, underscored the broader theme of revival that characterized this era. As these nations embraced their historical identities, they navigated the complexities of modern statecraft, economic development, and international relations, proving that ancient legacies could be seamlessly integrated into the contemporary world. Japan's role in facilitating and often directly influencing these transformations cannot be understated. Acting as a stabilizing force, Japan's diplomatic, economic, and sometimes military interventions played a critical part in shaping the new political landscape of East Asia. The informal tributary relationship between the restored Empire of China and Japan, reminiscent of historical precedents, signified a mutual recognition of their shared heritage and a cooperative approach towards regional leadership. In this era of renaissance, the philosophical foundations laid by Sun Yat-Sen in the early 20th century experienced a revival, adapted to fit the governance models of these restored states.

Each has its nuances and applications, reflecting different aspects of spatial relationships in the French language. To complement these two, there are more terms used for indicating location, direction, and distance. Here's a rundown of what each means and additional related terms: 1. **Ici**: Translates to \\"here\\" in English. It indicates a location close to the speaker. When someone says \\"Je suis ici,\\" they mean \\"I am here,\\" referring to their immediate location. 2. **Là**: Can mean \\"there\\" in English. It's used to refer to a location that is not close to the speaker. It can be somewhat close (but not immediate) or far, depending on the context. \\"Il est là\\" can mean \\"He is there,\\" pointing out a location away from the speaker. 3. **Là-bas**: Literally translates to \\"over there,\\" and it's used to indicate a location that is farther away from the speaker compared to \\"là.\\" It gives a sense of a more distant location. Saying \\"Il habite là-bas\\" means \\"He lives over there,\\" referring to a place that is not near. 4. **Ici et là** (or **là et ici**): This phrase means \\"here and there,\\" suggesting scattered locations or indicating that something is spread out over various places. 5. **Partout**: Translates to \\"everywhere.\\" It is used when referring to several locations simultaneously or indicating ubiquity. \\"Elle est connue partout\\" means \\"She is known everywhere.\\" 6. **Ailleurs**: Means \\"elsewhere\\" or \\"somewhere else.\\" It is used when talking about a different location, excluding the current one. \\"Je préférerais être ailleurs\\" translates to \\"I would prefer to be elsewhere.\\" 7. **Nulle part**: Means \\"nowhere.\\" It indicates the absence of a specific location. \\"Je ne te vois nulle part\\" means \\"I can't see you anywhere.\\" 8. **Quelque part**: Translates to \\"somewhere.\\" It's used when the exact location is either unknown or not specified. \\"Il doit être quelque part\\" means \\"He must be somewhere.\\" These terms help articulate various aspects of spatial relationships, presence, or absence in a detailed and nuanced manner, a fundamental aspect of communication in any language, including French."},{"instruction":"And \\"celui\\" ?

One way to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user is through personas, aspects of the user’s character that provide insights into their personality, motivations, and behaviors. Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead to conversational models that create a deeper connection with the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations. These experts select the best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator. We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat1 1 Dataset available at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from Persona-Chat Zhang et al. (2018). We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat during Turing test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations. 1 Introduction Every person is a story. Systems that interact with people must understand their underlying stories to effectively engage with them. Unfortunately, many existing datasets used for training conversational agents do not sufficiently model their users. Personas - abstract user representations that express the “story” of a person based on their background and preferences - have been widely used for human-centered design in a variety of domains, including marketing, system design, and healthcare Pruitt and Grudin (2003b). Prior persona-based conversational datasets, like Persona-Chat (PC) Zhang et al. (2018), suffer from several limitations, such as small size, static dialogues that cannot easily be updated with new topics, irrelevant utterances, and contradictory persona attributes Wu et al. (2019). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for generating large, dynamic, persona-based conversational datasets that capture the breadth and depth of human experience. Personas Pruitt and Grudin (2003a); Cooper and Saffo (1999) have been widely used in a variety of domains and applications, including creating narratives for patients and sharing educational messages in healthcare Massey et al. (2021), targeting users in marketing van Pinxteren et al. (2020); Fuglerud et al. (2020), and communicating with workers in management Claus (2019). Conversational agents use personas to generate more interesting and engaging conversations with their users Zhou et al. (2019); Shum et al. (2019). Creating persona-based datasets is difficult: the process is labor-intensive, the outputs must be updated to reflect current events and new concepts, and there are often quality concerns. Existing persona-based datasets have resulted from labor-intensive data collection processes Zhang et al. (2018); Zhong et al. (2020) involving humans to create or validate personas, create fictional persona-based conversations, and ensure the conversations are coherent. Moreover, even after these datasets are created, it is difficult to update them with the latest topics Lee et al. (2022), such as current events, new concepts, products, or social trends Lazaridou et al. (2021). Finally, existing persona-based datasets do not guarantee faithfulness, a criterion we introduce to describe the alignment between participants’ utterances and their personas. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for generating large, customized persona-based conversational datasets that uses unsupervised LLMs to reduce human labor, introduces methods to generate, expand, and update personas automatically, and enforces a set of quality criteria including faithfulness to ensure dialogues are human-like. Our persona-based conversational dataset generation framework consists of a three-level pipeline: 1. User Generation 2. User Pairing 3. Conversation Generation The user generation step takes a set of seed personas, and augments it to create plausible user profiles. The user pairing step matches users to participate in conversations. The conversation generation produces plausible conversations between the selected user pairs. The conversation generation component uses a method similar to self-feedback Madaan et al. (2023) to iteratively improve the quality of generated samples. We used the proposed framework to create Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC), a conversational dataset with 5⁢k user personas, and 20⁢k faithful dialogues. The framework we defined to create this dataset can be reused to define specialized personas, such as user music profiles, etc. to create application-specific datasets. Our contributions are: • We propose an unsupervised approach to generate, and extend specialized personas using LLMs. • We introduce and evaluate a framework based on LLMs to evolve a dataset while imposing different objectives on it. • We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat, a high-quality, faithful, persona-based conversational dataset useful for several conversational tasks, such as training persona inference models. 2 Definitions We define the faithful persona-based dialogue generation task. We begin by defining the persona-based dialogue generation task. We then formally define the faithfulness criteria as a desired quality for the generated dialogues. Throughout this section, we use π to refer to persona attributes (individual sentences which, together, form the user persona), U to refer to user profiles, and D to refer to conversations (dialogues). Persona Attributes We define a user persona attribute as a sentence describing this user. \\"I like ice cream\\", \\"I have two brothers\\" and \\"My native language is Tamazight\\" are all examples of persona attributes. Let Ω be the universal set of persona attributes. Ω contains all natural language descriptions of all tangible features of any person, which is unbounded. Persona Categories To help organize the vast space of personas, we adopt the approach of Lee et al. (2022) who introduced persona categories. Persona categories are groups of persona attributes that describe the same semantic feature of the user. In our work, we associate each persona category with a corresponding query that can be answered with all persona attributes in that category. For example, job and family situation are persona categories, and corresponding queries might be “What is your occupation?”, and “Do you have a family?”. Persona Attribute Structure Persona attributes can overlap. For instance, the attribute \\"I introduced my kids to scuba diving at a young age\\" overlaps with the attribute \\"My eldest son goes to elementary school\\", since both include the \\"parenthood\\" feature of the user. Moreover, some persona attributes form a hierarchy, and some persona attributes are specific cases of other attributes. User Profile We define a user profile as a set of persona attributes that can be used to describe a user. For a realistic user, the persona attributes describing a user profile should not contradict each other, and be consistent. An arbitrary persona attribute set U⊂Ω is a consistent set of persona attribute if, and only if: ∀π1∈U,∄⁢Π2⊂U:(Π2≠∅)∧(Π2→¬⁢π1) Persona-based Conversation A persona-based conversation D contains utterances such that at least one persona attribute from each user profile can be inferred from it. For example, the persona attribute \\"I am a parent\\" can be inferred from the utterance \\"I just dropped off my son at school\\". A persona-based conversation model is a generative model that takes a pair of user profiles (U1, U2) as input, and returns a persona-based dialogue D between these two users. Faithfulness One crucial quality for a persona-based conversation is that it should align with the user profile. Inspired by Daheim et al. (2023) which introduces dialogue system faithfulness to the knowledge contained in relevant documents, we specify the criterion of faithfulness to characterize the alignment between the utterances of a user in a persona-based conversation and their profile. The faithfulness criterion enforces the constraint that the utterances of a user should not decrease the likelihood of their persona. This criterion assumes the existence of both a prior probability of persona attributes, and an inference model for determining the probability of persona attributes conditioned on utterances. Let M be such an inference model, (U1, U2) a pair of user profiles, and D a persona-based conversation between them. To be a faithful conversation based on M, D should not contain any contradicting evidence to the persona attributes of the speakers: passing the conversation D as input to the inference model M should not reduce the inference probability of persona attributes in either of the user profiles U1 or U2. In other words, the probability of any persona attribute in the user profiles based on conversation D should not be less than the probability of that persona attribute without any assumptions. Formally, we call a conversation D faithful with respect to the user profiles U1 and U2, and inference model M if the following condition holds: ∀π∈U1∪U2:PM⁢(π|D)≥PM⁢(π). Where PM⁢(π|D) indicates the probability that M infers the persona π given conversation D. We show examples of faithful, and unfaithful conversations in Figure 1. Refer to caption Figure 1: Unfaithful Conversation (Left): Loving steak is negatively correlated with the persona attribute \\"I am a vegetarian\\". Faithful Conversation (Right): It introduces no information that contradicts or weakens the user’s profile. 3 Method In this section, we introduce our method to generate persona-based conversations. We create such conversations with minimum human input, starting from an initial dataset. Our process consists of three steps, as shown in Figure 2: user generation, user pairing, and conversation generation. The first component augments a set of seed persona attributes Π0 into an expanded set of persona attributes Πe, from which it creates user profiles. The second component pairs user profiles as interlocutors of a conversation. The third and final component uses an iterative process to generate high-quality conversations among user profile pairs. We detail each of these components below. Refer to caption Figure 2: Dataset Augmentation Pipeline 3.1 User Generation The User Generation component is split into two sub-components: 1. Persona Expansion 2. User Profile Construction We bootstrap seed persona attributes by using various prompts Brown et al. (2020b) to generate new persona attributes in the Persona Expansion step (Refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the prompts used). We then create new user profiles by iteratively selecting random user persona attributes from the expanded persona attributes. We employ a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model to ensure the consistency of the constructed user profiles. 3.1.1 Persona Expansion We propose an unsupervised method to augment a set of seed persona attributes Π0 into a super-set Πe. Unlike previous approaches Lee et al. (2022), our method is independent of human knowledge or intervention, making it capable of creating specialized personas in new domains. We proceed in two steps: query induction, and persona bootstrapping. In the query induction phase, we identify persona categories in Π0, along with associated queries. We then expand these queries into a set Q that also covers unobserved persona categories. The persona bootstrapping step leverages the category-based query set Q, and the initial persona attribute seed set Π0 to generate new persona attributes. Both of these steps are based on the bootstrapping technique Yarowsky (1995), and involve prompting an LLM. We provide a detailed description of these two steps in the following. Query Induction As described in Section 2, each persona attribute belongs to at least one persona category, and each category is associated with a corresponding query that can be answered with persona attributes in that category. The query induction process initially identifies the queries associated with persona categories in Π0. It then bootstraps queries by feeding them to a prompted LLM to create more queries that are associated with unobserved categories, ultimately creating a query set Q. Including queries associated with unobserved persona categories facilitates the creation of a more diverse set of personas, and increases the scale of augmentation. The query induction relies on the following assumption: Assumption Let ℳ be an LLM, and let Γ be the set of all queries associated with all persona categories. If two persona attributes π1 and π2 belong to the same persona category, then there exists a query qℳ∈Γ such that π1 and π2 are ℳ’s output to qℳ. The persona attributes \\"I am a doctor\\" and \\"I am a truck driver\\", for instance, both belong to the \\"job\\" category, leading to the query \\"What is your job?\\". We use an agglomerative clustering method to identify the persona categories in Π0. Let C be an arbitrary persona cluster in Π0. To generate a query for C, we select a random subset of persona attributes in C, and create a prompt using these samples. We employ this strategy to generate queries for all the clusters identified in Π0, and create a set of queries, which we refer to as Q0. Details on the clustering, query induction, together with examples of clusters, persona attributes, and induced queries are available in Appendix A.1. We come up with queries for new, unobserved persona categories by bootstrapping the queries in Q0: starting from Q=Q0, we iteratively sample a set of queries from Q, and create a prompt by concatenating them. We then prompt the LLM to generate a new query, and add it to the query set Q, as shown in Figure 3. We generated a total of |Q|=188 queries. This set of category-specific queries Q is later used to guide the LLM to generate new persona attributes from the specified category. Thus, higher values of |Q| result in greater diversity within the expanded persona attribute set. Refer to caption Figure 3: Query Induction Steps Persona Bootstrapping We use the persona attribute seed set Π0 and category-specific queries Q to generate new persona attributes through a bootstrapping process. We initialize Π to Π0. At every iteration, we randomly select a subset of persona attributes from Π, and create a set of prompts as follows: we first concatenate a set of persona attributes s. For every query q∈Q, we then combine the concatenated samples s, and the query q to create a category-specific persona prompt. This prompt guides the LLM to generate a persona attribute for that persona category. The set of prompts obtained from this process is {s⁢q|q∈Q}. We only add a new persona attribute to the set if its BERT embeddings Devlin et al. (2019) are not too close from existing ones, so as to prevent the addition of duplicates. Each of these prompts is then fed to the LLM to create a new persona attribute, which is subsequently added to the set of persona attributes Π for the next iteration. We continue this iterative process until we have generated a total of 5k persona attributes. Figure 4 illustrates the persona bootstrapping process. Table 6 in the appendix contains the prompt template used in this component. Refer to caption Figure 4: Query-based Persona Bootstrapping Process 3.1.2 User Profile Construction We build user profiles incrementally by sampling persona attributes from Πe, and adding the eligible ones. A persona attribute is eligible if it adheres to the criteria of consistency and non-redundancy. In other words, it should not contradict any attribute already in the user profile, and it should not be inferred by other persona attribute. We assess the consistency and redundancy of user profiles by leveraging an NLI model, and persona attribute clustering, respectively. The NLI model we employ is based on T5 Raffel et al. (2019), and has been trained on the TRUE dataset Honovich et al. (2022). We create a user profile U by iteratively selecting a random candidate persona attribute π′∈Πe. We use the NLI model to assess whether π′ contradicts any persona attribute in the profile. This is determined by the condition: ∀π∈U:(π′↛¬⁢π)∧(π↛¬⁢π′), where → is an inference. Additionally, we evaluate the similarity of π′ to the persona attributes in U to prevent the addition of redundant attributes. We add π′ to U if it meets the consistency and non-redundancy criteria. We repeat this process until the user profile contains 5 persona attributes. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the user profile construction. 3.2 User Pairing In this component, we identify potential pairs of users for conversations. As the conversations are persona-based, we hypothesize that they will be more engaging if the users’ personas exhibit more commonalities. We assign a similarity score to every pair of user profiles (U1,U2), indicating their semantic similarity. We leverage BERT to represent the user profiles. The similarity between U1 and U2 is defined as: |{(π1,π2)|π1∈U1,π2∈U2,∃c:π1,π2∈c}| Where c is a persona attributes cluster. The semantic similarity is quantified by the number of common persona categories in the user profiles. We pair U1 and U2 if their similarity exceeds a threshold of 2. 3.3 Conversation Generation Our Conversation Generation component is similar to a general-purpose dataset generation framework that generates data samples, and refines them based on a set of predefined criteria, which we refer to as policies Madaan et al. (2023). The flexibility in the choice of policies for data generation allows us to emphasize different objectives. Once the active policies are selected, this component generates new data samples using a few input samples. The input to our Conversation Generation framework consists of a set of paired user profiles, a few samples of user profiles along with a persona-based conversation between them, and conversation quality metrics as policies. We follow a Generator-Critic architecture, and iteratively create the dataset following the steps shown in Figure 5: Step 1 The Generator outputs candidate conversations between persona pairs using a few initial conversation samples. Step 2 The Critic evaluates the candidate conversations based on the predetermined policies, and selects the best candidate conversations. Step 3 The best candidate conversations are added to the dataset for the next iteration of generation. This iterative process of selecting the top candidates and adding them to the dataset gradually improves the performance of the Generator. Without any loss of generality, we implement both the Generator and the Critic based on LLMs. Specifically, the Generator prompts an LLM to create candidate conversations, while the Critic prompts an LLM to evaluate the quality of the generated conversations. We provide more details on the Generator, Critic, and the policies we used. Refer to caption Figure 5: The Generator-Critic Architecture for Conversation Generation The Generator outputs conversations for pairs of users (U1,U2) by prompting an LLM Brown et al. (2020b); Wei et al. (2023). At each iteration, it randomly selects 5 samples from an initial set of conversations, each containing a pair of user profiles and a dialogue among them. It feeds these samples to a template that instructs the LLM to generate a series of candidate conversations for the given user pair. The template, and a sample generated conversation are available in Table 6, and Table 8 in the appendix. The Critic selects the best generated conversations to fine-tune the Generator. A conversation is deemed high-quality if it complies with the policies of the Critic. Given the multifaceted nature of the conversation evaluations, we use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach. Each expert evaluates the conversation based on a specific policy. In this paper, we incorporate three types of experts, each with distinct criteria: general conversation quality, persona faithfulness, and toxicity. Collectively, these experts select the best generated conversations (the single best in our experiments). We describe each type of expert, and the collective decision-making process below. General Conversation Quality experts assess conversation quality using the Fine-grained Evaluation of Dialog (FED) metrics introduced in Mehri and Eskénazi (2020). These experts use verbalized forms of the policies from FED as prompts. For instance, the \\"conversation depth quality expert\\" transforms the \\"depth policy\\" from FED into a prompt like \\"Which conversation is a deeper conversation between user 1 and user 2?\\". Our system instructs the LLM to compare each pair of candidate conversations based on these policies, resulting in pairwise comparisons. The list of policies and their baseline performance are presented in Table 5 in Appendix A.2. The Faithfulness expert ensures the consistency of the generated conversations with the user profiles. It uses an LLM to identify instances of unfaithful conversations. The faithfulness prompt provides the LLM with explicit instructions, user profiles, and human-curated examples of unfaithful conversations. The Toxicity expert detects any conversation that exhibits harmful traits, including bias and hate. The Critic filters unfaithful and toxic conversations out. It then selects the best conversations using a majority vote among the General Conversation Quality experts. The selected instances are added to the dataset for the next iteration of the Generator. 4 Evaluation We evaluate different aspects of our dataset generation framework, and the resulting dataset - referred to as Synthetic-Persona-Chat - which is created using an instruction fine-tuned LLM with 24 billion parameters Chung et al. (2022). We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC) against the widely used Persona-Chat (PC) dataset across different dimensions. We begin by evaluating the quality of the personas we generate. We then evaluate SPC using both automatic metrics, and human assessment. We analyze other aspects of SPC, such as toxicity and diversity in appendices B.1 and B.1. 4.1 Evaluation of the Expanded Personas We evaluate our persona expansion module on two seed datasets: Wikipedia, and Persona-Chat. The Wikipedia personas are created by crawling the 1,000 most active contributors2 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits, and extracting user boxes from their pages. We expand both datasets using our framework, and evaluate the expanded persona attribute sets using automatic metrics. Table 1 compares the original persona sets to the expanded ones on a few dimensions. We observe that our persona expansion increases the number of persona attributes in SPC by 119%, while maintaining the original persona categories and expanding them by 71% compared to the persona attributes in PC. Moreover, the lengths of the new generated persona attributes are 107% longer in SPC, indicating that the new personas exhibit greater detail and specificity. We observe a similar trend when applying our persona expansion to the Wikipedia persona set, with a 108% increase in the number of persona attributes, a 140% increase in persona categories, and a 45% growth in persona attribute lengths. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in expanding and diversifying persona sets.

The numbers with * indicate the metric value of the newly generated persona attributes to contrast with the initial set. 4.2 Next Utterance Prediction A persona-based conversation reflects the speaker’s persona explicitly or implicitly. Therefore, we expect the inclusion of information about speaker personas to enhance the performance of next utterance prediction models in such conversations. In this experiment, we assess the impact of incorporating speaker personas as prior information on both ranking, and generative - Transformer based Vaswani et al. (2017) - next utterance prediction models. We create a subset of SPC containing conversations among user pairs included in PC for a fair comparison. Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat Method Metric None Persona % Change None Persona % Change IR Baseline hit@1 18.69 36.86 +97 19.37 (19.92) 39.6 (26.23) +104 (+31) Transformer (Ranker) hit@1 14.24 19.21 +35 9.71 (64.24) 11.74 (68.82) +21 (+7) Transformer (Generator) hit@1 8.54 6.78 -20 6.89 (41.32) 6.66 (37.35) -3 (-9) Perplexity 122.5 173.3 +41 1032 (5.24) 1126 (5.73) +9 (+9) BLUE 0.120 0.094 -21 0.097 (0.289) 0.083 (0.251) -14 (-13) ROUGE 0.141 0.113 -24 0.123 (0.348) 0.107 (0.309) -13 (-11) Table 2: Results of the next utterance prediction experiment. Performance of the trained model on the test split of Persona-Chat is represented by the numbers in the table, while the numbers in parentheses indicate results for the test split of Synthetic-Persona-Chat. We observe (Table 2) that the performance of ranking models increases when personas are given to the models as input for both datasets. Specifically, the Transformer (Ranker) model, known for its ability to capture conversational complexity, exhibits higher performance in SPC when evaluated on the SPC test set compared to the PC test set. However, it demonstrates relatively weaker performance when trained on the PC. This implies that SPC contains more intricate and coherent conversations. The Transformer (Ranker) trained on SPC achieves a hit@1 of 64.24 on SPC test, 350% higher than PC (14.24). This suggests that the Transformer model can more accurately predict the next utterance in SPC, pointing to a greater coherency in conversations. The performance of the Information Retrieval (IR) Baseline model is slightly higher for SPC: it rises by 31% when conditioned on user personas, which is lower than 97% improvement in PC. A key contributing factor for the performance improvement of the retrieval-based model (IR Baseline) on PC given the personas, is the participants’ tendency to copy persona words in the conversations, whereas in SPC the personas are more implicitly reflected in the conversations. The implicit reflection of personas in SPC, makes the task more challenging for word based retrieval models, necessitating reasoning that goes beyond word level. However, when the model is trained on SPC and tested on PC, the improvement is as high as when the model is trained on PC, i.e. 104% compared to 97%. The performance of generative models is low for this task since these models are not trained with the ranking objective. However, the performance difference while the models are conditioned on personas is lower for the model trained on SPC, with a 20% drop for the model trained on PC against 3% drop in the model trained on SPC. The increase in perplexity is 9% in SPC compared to 41% in PC. The lower rate of perplexity increase and performance drop of the model given user personas as input highlights the higher alignment of conversations with personas in SPC. We also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results suggest a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC. We refer the reader to the Appendix B.1 for more details. 4.3 Human Evaluation We compare the quality of the conversations generated by our framework against those in Persona-Chat. We randomly select 200 conversations from PC, together with their corresponding user pairs, and use our method to generate conversations among the same users. We start by following Gehrmann et al. (2019) in running a human experiment to try and detect AI-generated content. We conduct a Turing test where we present pairs of conversations to humans, and ask them to identify the synthetically generated one. This test is carried out on the generated conversations at the end of each iteration of creating SPC. We repeat the test for conversations generated for new persona pairs, which we refer to as iteration 3*, i.e. we pair each of these conversations with a random conversation from PC. For a robust evaluation, every pair of conversations is annotated by 3 human evaluators, and the majority vote is used as the final annotation. Details of this test are available in Appendix B.2. The results of this experiment can be found in Table 3. We observe that the losing rate of SPC is reduced by 48% from SPC Iter 1 to SPC Iter 3, and dropped below the rate of 10%. Interestingly, 91% of the conversations in SPC, which are synthetically generated, are judged as human-like as the conversations generated by humans. Moreover, conversations generated for new personas (Iteration 3*) are deemed artificial in only 8.04% of cases, showing that SPC is more realistic than PC. We also evaluate the faithfulness of the generated conversations. For each conversation, we provide annotators with a faithfulness annotation task including the speakers’ persona attributes and distractor persona attribute options as shown in Figure 8. We evaluate faithfulness during 3 iterations of conversation generation for the selected 200 user pairs, and the annotators evaluate the generated conversations for each pair in every iteration. The results show that, while improving the Turing test results, faithfulness of conversations are consistently higher than 75% with at most 3% variation in between iterations, indicating high faithfulness in all iterations. Finally, we assess the impact of LLM size on the quality of the generated dataset within our framework. We create a variant of SPC using an LLM with 540 billion parameters (LLM2). Table 3 presents human evaluations comparing the smaller LLM in multiple iterations to a single-iteration approach with LLM2. The larger model exhibits a 5% advantage in the Turing test over the first iteration of dataset generation over the smaller model. After two iterations, however, the multi-iteration approach outperforms the first iteration of the bigger model, showing our framework’s capacity for cost-effective, high-quality conversation generation.

(2021), generation Kim et al. (2023); Dong et al. (2023), and evaluation Zhang et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2023). One of the earliest works in this area Anaby-Tavor et al. (2019) used LLMs to create a large text dataset from a small, labeled one. This idea was followed by Wang et al. (2021); Schick and Schütze (2021) which leveraged LLMs to create datasets without any human data. Kumar et al. (2020) evaluated the performance of different LLMs on the data augmentation task. Several conversational dataset generation methods focused on the structure of the conversational data Dai et al. (2022); Leszczynski et al. (2023); Abbasiantaeb et al. (2023). Mehri et al. (2022) illustrated how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively generate synthetic training data for task-oriented dialogue models. Persona-based conversations have been a popular research topic in NLP Liu et al. (2022). One of the earliest works in this area is Persona-Chat, by Zhang et al. (2018), which proposed the Persona-Chat dataset and evaluation metrics that have become a benchmark for persona-based conversation generation Mazaré et al. (2018). Many subsequent works have used this dataset to train and evaluate their models, including DialoGPT Zhang et al. (2020), BlenderBot Shuster et al. (2022), and PersonaChatGen Lee et al. (2022). PersonaChatGen automated the process of creating persona based conversations of Persona-Chat using LLMs. A challenge in generating synthetic datasets is to ensure the quality of the conversation including data faithfulness, fidelity, diversity, and consistency Li et al. (2016); Lee et al. (2023); Veselovsky et al. (2023); Zhuo et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023a); Mündler et al. (2023). Several works have focused on creating and using high quality training datasets Welleck et al. (2019), and creating quality filtering components to their conversation dataset generation Lewkowycz et al. (2022). Evaluation of the resulting conversational datasets is also challenging Xu et al. (2021). Wang et al. (2023b) recently introduced the paradigm of interactive evaluation of conversations with LLMs. 6 Conclusion and Future Work We developed a novel framework for generating high-quality persona-based conversations using LLMs, resulting in the creation of Synthetic-Persona-Chat, comprising 20k conversations. We hope this dataset will support future endeavors in developing persona-aware conversational agents, including the generation of domain-specific multi-session conversations for specialized, task-oriented interactions. While we focused on a persona-based dataset generation task, our Generator-Critic approach can be generalized to other use cases, such as generating other specialized datasets, etc. Limitations In this paper, we define an iterative process over LLMs to generate a dataset. Our method requires computational resources, and access to an LLM. The quality of the dataset is bounded by the LLM, since the quality critics are also using the same LLM, and we leave the iterative improvement of our critics as future work. The main limitation of this data generation framework is the inability to generate realistic conversations that do not have high quality, since we assume that both parties are fluent, that the conversation flow is perfectly consistent, and there is no unexpected event (e.g. an interruption by another person, connection loss, etc.) in the middle of the conversation. Another limitation of our method is the difficulty of incorporating less tangible persona traits, such as a sense of humor, or user attributes that require multiple conversation sessions to be reflected. Ethics Statement The approach of generating datasets based on some desired objective might be used to create harmful datasets, and train malicious models based on them, such as a biased dataset, or a hateful speech one Hartvigsen et al. (2022). On the other hand, these datasets and models can be used as filters in application tasks. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk in our human experiments, and followed that platform’s guidelines to protect the rights of human raters. The participation was voluntary, and the raters were informed of their rights at the beginning of the study. The platform implemented security measures to protect them, and prevent the disclosure of any Personal Identifiable Information about them. Furthermore, we offered higher than minimum standard wage compensation to avoid any exploitative practices. To avoid having any toxic conversation in the final dataset, we also used several tools to remove any potentially toxic conversation. Details about these tools, and example removed samples are available in Appendix B.1.

Appendix A Dataset Generation Framework In this section, we provide more details on our synthetic dataset generation framework. We created Synthetic-Persona-Chat using an LLM with 24 billion parameters. We use top-k sampling with k=40 for decoding during generation, and set the temperature value to 0.7 in all components. We give more details on user and conversation generation components in the following subsections. A.1 User Generation In our framework, the user generation component consists of two steps: expanding the persona attribute set, and creating realistic user profiles. In this section we provide details on our framework for these two steps: Persona Expansion As described in Section 3.1.1, the persona expansion step involves identifying persona categories in the initial persona attribute set Π0, generating queries associated with those categories, and bootstrapping queries to create a query set Q. In our framework, we employ the Scikit-learn Pedregosa et al. (2011) implementation of an agglomerative clustering to identify persona categories following this clustering method: we represent each persona using a BERT-based representation. Our clustering approach is bottom-up, starting with each persona attribute as an individual cluster. At each step, we combine two clusters if their similarity exceeds a predetermined threshold of 0.1. The similarity of two clusters is measured using inter-cluster average cosine similarity. The process continues until no pair of clusters is more similar than the threshold. After identifying the clusters, we sample 3 instances of persona attributes for each cluster, and prompt the LLM using the template in shown in section 3 to construct an initial query set Q0. We expand the query set Q0 using bootstrapping. At each step, we sample 5 instances from the available queries, and prompt the LLM using the template in Table 6. We repeat this process for 100 steps. Examples of initial persona attributes, induced queries, bootstrapped queries, and bootstrapped persona attributes can be found in Table 4. The prompt templates used in this component are available in Table 6. User Profile Generation We illustrate a sample user profile creation process in Figure 6. As shown in the figure, at each iteration, a randomly selected persona attribute is checked for consistency and non-redundancy. Let π′ be a randomly selected persona attribute in an iteration. For the redundancy criteria, we use the BERT representation of persona attributes. We compute the similarity of the new candidate persona attribute π′ with every persona attribute in the user profile. If it is more than a threshold (0.9 in these experiments) similar to an attribute in the user profile, π′ is deemed as redundant and will not be added to the user profile. We use the cosine similarities of the BERT representations of the persona attributes. For the consistency criteria, we use the NLI model to verify the consistency of this persona attribute with the user profile. For every persona attribute in the current user profile π, we prompt the LLM to create the negated persona attribute ¬⁢π. Then, we query the NLI model to check whether ¬⁢π is inferred by π′ or ¬⁢π′ is inferred by π. If either of these cases is inferred, then the selected persona attribute is not consistent with the user profile, and not added to the profile. Dataset Persona Source Query Example Persona Attribute Persona-Chat Human What is your job? I am a pharmacist. Where do you live? I live close to the coast. Do you have any pets? I have a doberman. LLM What are your talents? I am a great listener. What is your hair color? My hair is auburn. What is your favorite song? I like the song \\"Leather and Lace\\". Wikipedia Human What are your hobbies? I spend WAY too much time on Wikipedia. What is your view on the metric system? I find the metric system to be a logical and efficient way to measure things. LLM What is the name of the first album you ever purchased? My first album was The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill What are you interested in? I’m looking to learn new recipes and improve my cooking skills. Table 4: Persona Categories and Induced Queries Using Our Framework. Queries are generated by the Large Language Model (LLM). Queries for personas with the \\"LLM\\" as source, are generated through bootstrapping, while those with \\"human\\" as source are generated by sampling persona categories and prompting the LLM. Personas with \\"human\\" as the source are authored by humans, while \\"LLM\\" rows represent personas generated using our framework. Refer to caption Figure 6: User Profile Construction Example A.2 Conversation Generation LLM-based Critic In our framework, the critic is implemented by prompting an LLM. We included a mixture of experts approach in the critic, where each expert prompts the LLM to assess a specific policy in the candidate conversations. Our framework includes a set of experts to control the general conversation quality. We evaluate the performance of these experts using a baseline dataset. The baseline dataset for this experiment is FED which consists of 125 human-annotated instances evaluated at the conversation level. We pair the conversations and evaluate the experts based on the number of correctly ranked pairs. As shown in Table 5, we observe that these experts are more than 80% accurate in distinguishing the better conversation within the pairs. The template for the verbalized form of these experts used in our framework can be found in Table 6. Policy Performance Depth 0.84 Coherency 0.96 Consistency 0.92 Diversity 0.92 Likable 0.88 Table 5: List of FED Experts for Persona-Based Conversation Generation Critic. Performance is measured by the number of correctly compared conversation pairs in FED baseline based on the given policy. Component Template Query Induction What is the most specific question that you are replying to with the following statements? {persona-category-sample-1} {persona-category-sample-2} {persona-category-sample-3} Query Bootstrapping {cluster-query-1} … {cluster-query-5} Add more persona questions similar to the above examples. Persona Bootstrapping Imagine you are a person with the following persona. {random-persona-attribute-1} … {random-persona-attribute-5} {query}. Answer with only one short sentence that starts with ’I’ or ’My’. Do not repeat the given persona. FED Expert Which one of Conversation 1 and Conversation 2 between two users {policy}? Why? Conversation 1: {conv-1} Conversation 2: {conv-2} Toxicity Expert Is this conversation toxic? Why? Conversation: {conv} Conversation Generation Here, we list the profiles of two users, user 1 and user 2, followed by an interesting and natural conversation between user 1 and user 2, which implicitly reflects their user profiles. User 1 Profile: {conversation1-user-1} User 2 Profile: {conversation1-user-2} Conversation: {conversation-1} … User 1 Profile: {conversation-5-user-1} User 2 Profile: {conversation-5-user-2} Conversation: {conversation-5} Give me more examples like this. The conversation must be more than 5 turns and less than 8 turns. The conversation must be natural, and not direct copies of their profiles. User 1 Profile: {user-1} User 2 Profile: {user-2} Faithfulness Expert Given user 1 and user 2’s profiles respectively, does the following conversation between the two users contradict either of their profiles? Why? User 1 Profile: {user-1} User 2 Profile: {user-2} Conversation: {conv-1} Response: {explanation} Table 6: Prompting Templates for Large Language Models of Different Components in Our Framework. Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated. We also included a toxicity expert and a persona faithfulness expert in the critic. The prompt templates used in these experts are available in Table 6. The persona faithfulness leverages in-context- learning capability of LLMs. It includes a few human-curated examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations in the instruction prompt. Refer to Table 7 for examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations used in the instruction prompt.

User 2: I have a dog and a cat. User 1: That is cool. User 2: Do you have any hobbies?. User 1: Yes, I like to write. User 2: What do you write about? User 1: I write about my life. User 2: That is cool. User 1: Thanks! No, the conversation does not contradict the profiles. Neither user 1 nor user 2 says anything that contradicts their respective profiles. Although the conversation does not cover everything in their profiles, that is ok. User 1: I would like to move some place warmer. I m an out of work farmhand. I like watching reality television shows. I live in Kansas. User 2: I am studying to be a dentist. My favorite team is the raptors. My favorite band is rise against. I usually go to bed late. I like sports. User 1: It’s so cold in Kansas, I want to go some place warmer. User 2: I am studying dentistry. User 1: I am an out of work farmhand, I love reality tv. User 2: I like the raptors and rise against, I go to bed late. User 1: It is very hard to find work here, I might need to go to the city. User 2: I don’t like sports , but I like the raptors . User 1: I would like to work as a model, but I have no experience. User 2: I am applying for a job as a receptionist. User 1: I am very jealous, I hope you get it. Yes, the conversation contradicts user 2’s profile. In the profile, user 2 says they like sports, however, in the conversation, user 2 says they don’t like sports. User 1: My family is from Kazakhstan. I can speak Spanish, English, and Kazakh. I like to go hiking on the weekends. I play jazz piano in a band. I am a barista. User 2: I am a vegan. I love game of thrones. I like soccer. My brother used to be in the navy. User 1: Hi, what do you do for a living? User 2: I am a barista. User 1: Awesome, me too! Where are you from? User 2: My family is from Kazakhstan, but I was born in Uruguay. User 1: Cool . What do you like to do in your free time? User 2: I love to go hiking and play jazz piano. User 1: Wow, that sounds really nice. I like to watch game of thrones and play soccer. User 2: I have never seen game of thrones, but I love soccer. User 1: You should watch it, it is really good. User 2: I will check it out. Yes, the conversation contradicts user 2’s profile. In the profile, user 2 says they love game of thrones, but in the conversation user 2 says they have never seen it. User 1: My favorite book is David Copperfield. I have a twin brother. I am really short. I love to bake cakes. I have won tap dance competitions. User 2: I enjoy spending a lot of money on my hobbies. I love photography. I like to use candles instead of lights. I do not like waking up early. User 1: Hi there! Do you like to read? User 2: I like to read. I like to go to the library. User 1: Oh, cool! What is your favorite book? User 2: I really like David Copperfield. I have a twin brother and I am really short.

User 2: I love spending money on my hobbies. No, the conversation does not contradict either user profiles. Although user 2 says they are really short, which is in user 1’s profile, it doesn’t mean user 2 cannot be really short too. Table 7: Examples of Faithful and Unfaithful Conversations for Prompting the Persona Faithfulness Expert in Our Framework. The ‘Faithfulness explanation’ columns are used to fill the ‘explanation’ variable in the faithfulness expert template. Appendix B Synthetic-Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat is made of 20k conversations, with an average of 11.8 turns per user for each. An example Synthetic-Persona-Chat conversation can be found in Table 8. We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat to Persona-Chat across different dimensions. We first assess the characteristics of SPC using various automatic evaluators, i.e. evaluators which do not require human effort. We then conduct a human evaluation experiment on a subset of SPC. User Profiles Conversation User 1 I am male. My weakness are sweets. I am unsociable. I am a jack of all, master of none. User 2 My favorite music is rock and roll. I love to travel. I am from Russia. I enjoy skiing. I go to school for business. User 1: Hello User 2: Hello, what’s your name? User 1: My name is [name], and you? User 2: My name is [name], I’m from Russia. User 1: Nice to meet you, [name]. I’m from the United States. User 2: It’s nice to meet you too, [name]. What are you interested in? User 1: I’m interested in a lot of things, but my main interests are music and travel. User 2: I love music too! What kind of music do you like?

User 2: I’m free this weekend too! We should go skiing. User 1: Great! I’ll text you the details. Table 8: Sample Conversation from Synthetic-Persona-Chat. This conversation was synthesized from user profiles in Persona-Chat B.1 Automatic Evaluation We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of SPC across different dimensions and compare it against PC. We start by analyzing the toxicity and diversity of SPC using off the shelf tools. Then, we elaborate on the experiments which assess the efficacy of SPC used as the dataset for the next utterance prediction and the profile extraction tasks. Finally, we evaluate the quality of SPC conversations using LLM-based evaluation methods. Toxicity Analysis We analyze the toxicity of the generated conversations at the final iteration of SPC using an online tool called Perspective3 3 https://perspectiveapi.com/. We reproduce the results of a detailed analysis of toxicity in PC as well as in each iteration of our data generation framework while producing SPC in Table 9. Toxicity Profanity Confidence weak(< .2) medium(.2-.8) strong(>.8) weak(< .2) medium(.2-.8) strong(>.8) PC 10875 4448 53 10891 1676 57 SPC Iter 1 10902 1192 3 10903 340 3 SPC Iter 2 10900 1096 1 10901 345 1 SPC Iter 3 10902 1088 1 10902 376 0 Table 9: Frequency of Toxic Conversations in Persona-Chat and Synthetic-Persona-Chat We observe a notable reduction in the frequency of conversations deemed as strongly toxic or profane throughout the iterations of generating SPC. This reduction can be attributed to the built-in toxicity filter of the employed LLM. While PC contains more than 50 samples that are identified as strongly toxic, SPC includes at most three toxic or profane conversations, which is significantly lower (at least 15 times less). Interestingly, the fraction of conversations with medium profanity and toxicity in SPC is 4 times less than the same type of conversations in PC across all iterations. We have removed any conversation that was marked as strongly toxic by this tool in the released dataset. Samples of toxic conversations are provided in Table 10. Source Conversation Persona-Chat … User 1: I like bloody stuff. User 2: It reminds me of the dark which makes me afraid of it. User 1: You are a silly goose. Persona-Chat … User 2: Cool. Why do you say that? Because I am a red head? User 1: No. Ikn. Why do you ask so many questions? Mr. Thomas is dumb. Synthetic-Persona-Chat User 1: I can imagine. What’s your favorite part of the job? User 2: I love working with my team and seeing our restaurant succeed. User 1: That’s great. What’s your least favorite part of the job? User2: My least favorite part is dealing with my boss. He’s a real jerk. Table 10: Examples of Toxic Conversations. The first two examples are segments of conversations from Persona-Chat. The final example is a segment from a toxic conversation in Synthetic-Persona-Chat, which has been removed in the released dataset. Diversity Analysis We use hierarchical topic modeling Blei et al. (2004) to assess the topic diversity of SPC and compare it to that of PC. For a fair comparison, we only compare conversations in SPC with similar personas in PC. Table 11 displays the number of topics at each level of the topic tree, with the first level indicating the most general topic. We observe similar topic diversity at the first level. In deeper levels, there is a slightly lower diversity in SPC. Topic Level PC SPC 1 27 27 2 232 213 3 470 403 4 137 118 5 30 26 Table 11: Vertical Topic Diversity in Persona-based Datasets Next Utterance Prediction We compare the performance of different models on the next utterance prediction task. As discussed in Section 4.2, these models are expected to exhibit better performance in the next utterance prediction task when user personas are provided as prior information. We evaluate ranking and generative models for response selection to assess this property. We compare models trained on SPC to the same models trained on PC. We use the implementations provided in Miller et al. (2017) for the following models: • IR Baseline Given an utterance as a query, the IR baseline finds the most similar utterance in the training corpus using tf-idf. It defines the utterance after the most similar utterance as the candidate response, and then returns the most similar option to that candidate as the output. • Transformer-Ranker The context of the conversation, as well as the candidate next utterances, are encoded using a BERT-based encoder. The most similar encoded candidate to the conversation context, as measured by a dot-product in their representation space, is selected as the output Humeau et al. (2020). • Transformer-Generator This model is a sequence-to-sequence model Sutskever et al. (2014) which uses transformers as encoders and decoders. Persona-Chat Synthetic-Persona-Chat Method Metric No Persona Self Persona Their Persona Both Personas No Persona Self Persona Their Persona Both Personas IR baseline hit@1 0.1869 0.3683 0.1519 0.3281 0.1861 0.2596 0.1882 0.2493 Transformer(Ranker) hit@1 0.2513 0.275 0.1922 0.2572 0.7164 0.6227 0.6988 0.7214 Transformer hit@1 0.0896 0.08512 0.0873 0.0813 0.0526 0.629 0.053 0.051 (Generator) ppl 65.57 72.24 62.49 64.07 5.54 5.47 5.4 5.405 Table 12: Evaluation of Next Utterance Prediction models conditioned on different user personas. We also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results of this experiment are available in Table 12. We observe that the highest performance improvement for all models trained on PC is when self-personas are given as input. We do not observe such a pattern in SPC. This indicates a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC conversations compared to those of PC. Profile Extraction A potential use-case of the SPC dataset is training a model to predict user personas from a conversation. This is only possible if the dataset is highly faithful, meaning that any persona attribute inferred from the conversation is in the user profile or compatible with the user profile. In this context, a faithful conversation is expected to have high precision in the profile extraction task, while a conversation that highly reflects user personas is expected to have high recall in this task. We evaluate the task of user profile extraction for conversations in SPC, and compare the results against those of PC. We frame the task of profile extraction as a ranking task, using the utterances within the conversations as queries. The goal is to rank a set of persona attribute options. For each conversation, we include the speakers’ persona attributes in the available options. Additionally, we select 25 random user persona attributes from other speaker profiles within the dataset to serve as distractors. The input to the profile extraction is utterances from a single user as the speaker, while the output is a list of persona attribute options for a target user, which could be either user 1 or user 2. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 13. We observe that the performance of the profile extraction methods is higher in SPC in 3 of the 4 scenarios. Interestingly, we observe that with both datasets, when the target and the speaker are different, the performance of profile extraction is greater compared to the cases when the target and speaker users are the same. F-Score Target Speaker PC SPC user 1 user 1 0.505 0.574 user 1 user 2 0.737 0.68 user 2 user 1 0.50 0.57 user 2 user 2 0.456 0.494 Table 13: Accuracy of Profile Extraction in Four Different Scenarios. The ‘Target’ column represents the user profile to be extracted, while the ‘Speaker’ column indicates the speaker of the turns given to the model as input. LLM-based Quality Evaluation We leverage LLM-based conversation quality evaluators from the literature to compare the quality of SPC and PC. These evaluators rely on the human curated prompt templates for different metrics including consistency, fluency, etc. We used these evaluators with minimum change in the original prompt templates. These evaluators are: • LLM-Eval Lin and Chen (2023) is a multi-dimensional automatic evaluation designed for conversations. It uses a human-curated prompt which describes evaluation dimensions, serving as a unified evaluation schema. This prompt evaluates the conversation across multiple dimensions (e.g. fluency) in a single model call. We show this unified schema in Table 14. • GPT-Score Fu et al. (2023) leverages emergent abilities of LLMs, i.e. zero-shot instructions, to score texts. It contains a prompt template, and for each quality criterion, populates the template with a human description of the criteria along with the valid score range for that criteria. Example prompts are provided in Table 14. • G-Eval Liu et al. (2023) introduces a framework that employs LLMs with a chain-of-thought approach to assess the quality of natural language generated outputs. For any evaluation criteria, G-Eval prompts the LLM with the criterion’s description, prompting the model to generate the necessary evaluation steps. It then uses these steps to prompt the LLM to score given output for that criterion. It considers the probability of getting each permissible score as the output of the prompt, i.e., it considers the probability distribution of scores assigned by the LLM. The reported output is the expected value of the score distribution by the LLM. Table 14 includes an example prompt. Evaluator Metric Prompt Template LLM-Eval All Human: The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below. As an example, for the schema {\\"properties\\": {\\"foo\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Foo\\", \\"description\\": \\"a list of strings\\", \\"type\\": \\"array\\", \\"items\\": {\\"type\\": \\"string\\"}}}, \\"required\\": [\\"foo\\"]}} the object {\\"foo\\": [\\"bar\\", \\"baz\\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\\"properties\\": {\\"foo\\": [\\"bar\\", \\"baz\\"]}} is not well-formatted. Here is the output schema: {\\"properties\\": {\\"content\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Content\\", \\"description\\": \\"content score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"grammar\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Grammar\\", \\"description\\": \\"grammar score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"relevance\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Relevance\\", \\"description\\": \\"relevance score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}, \\"appropriateness\\": {\\"title\\": \\"Appropriateness\\", \\"description\\": \\"appropriateness score in the range of 0 to 100\\", \\"type\\": \\"integer\\"}}, \\"required\\": [\\"content\\", \\"grammar\\", \\"relevance\\", \\"appropriateness\\"]} Score the following dialogue generated on a continuous scale from {score-min} to {score-max}. Dialogue: {dialogue} GPT-Score Consistency Answer the question based on the conversation between two users. Question: Are the responses of users consistent in the information they provide throughout the conversation? (a) Yes. (b) No. Conversation: {dialogue} Answer: G-Eval Coherence You will be given a pair of user personas. You will then be given one conversation between this persona pair. Your task is to rate the conversation on one metric. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed. Evaluation Criteria: Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all utterances. We align this dimension with the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) quality question of structure and coherence (https://duc.nist.gov/duc2007/quality-questions.txt), whereby \\"the conversation should be well-structured and well-organized. The conversation should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from utterance to a coherent body of conversation about a topic.\\" Evaluation Steps: 1. Read and understand the given conversation between the pair of user personas. 2. Evaluate the conversation based on the coherence of the utterances. 3. Rate the conversation on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest coherence and 1 being the lowest coherence. 4. Justify the rating by referring to specific aspects of the conversation that demonstrate its coherence or lack thereof. Example: Personas: {personas} Conversation: {dialogue} Evaluation Form (scores ONLY): - Coherence: LLM-Faithfulness Inference Instruction: Select User {user} persona attributes that are directly inferred from this conversation. Contradiction Instruction: Select User {user} persona attributes that strongly contradict this conversation. Table 14: Prompt Templates in LLM-based Conversation Quality Evaluators. Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated. Results of this evaluation are presented in Table 15. We observe that SPC consistently outperforms PC across all the dimensions we evaluate. The superiority of SPC is more prominent when using GPT-Score, for which each evaluated criterion shows an average improvement of at least 23 points.

B.2 Human Evaluation We run a human evaluation of the performance of our method via a crowdsourcing platform. We conduct a Turing test, and a faithfulness study - both of which we describe in more details in the following subsections - at the end of every iteration of the generation of SPC. Turing Test We randomly select 200 user pairs from PC. For each example, we show the annotators the user pair, together with the corresponding conversations from PC and SPC, and ask them to select the conversation that was synthetically generated. We show an example of this crowdsourcing task in Figure 7. The results of the Turing test are available in Table 16. We report the losing rate of SPC in Turing test, and Fleiss’ Kappa to assess the inter-rater agreement. The agreement falls into the fair to moderate agreement bucket. Refer to caption Figure 7: Preview of the Turing Test Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform Conversation Source % Lose κ # annotators SPC Iter 1 17.2 0.41 50 SPC Iter 2 18.5 0.48 40 SPC Iter 3 8.8 0.22 11 SPC Iter 3* 8.04 0.56 24 SPC (LLM2) 11.5 0.49 36 Table 16: Turing test results on a sample of 200 conversations. The first column shows the percentage of SPC losing compared to PC in the Turing test. Note that the last iteration (3) of SPC is an evaluation of the segment of conversations based on the extended persona set. Faithfulness We present the annotators with a conversation, and a set of options of persona attributes. The annotators are asked to select the user persona attributes they would infer from the conversation. Figure 8 shows a sample of the annotation task in this study. The options include the persona attributes of the speakers in the conversation, and a set of distractor persona attributes. We created distractor persona attributes using different strategies to cover different difficulty levels. For a persona attribute set Π, we create a set ¬⁢Π of distractor persona attributes as: Negated personas We prompt an LLM to negate persona attributes. For example, the negation of persona attribute \\"I like vegetables\\" is \\"I don’t like vegetables\\". Random personas We randomly select persona attributes from user profiles in other conversations in the dataset. Contradicting personas We prompt an LLM to generate a persona attribute which contradicts the users’ personas. Each entry of this task includes 8 user persona attributes as options, where 4 of them are the real persona attributes, and the other 4 are distractors. We evaluate the precision of the human annotators, and report it as a proxy to the conversation faithfulness in Table 3. Refer to caption Figure 8: Preview of the Faithfulness Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform. Appendix C Ablation Studies We run several ablation studies to evaluate the importance of individual components in our framework. We begin by analyzing the effect of the persona expansion module. We then review the impact of each expert in the mixture forming our Critic. C.1 Persona Expansion We assess the importance of the query-based persona expansion module introduced in Section 3.1.1. Similarly to the experiment outlined in Section 4.1, we run the persona expansion on two datasets: Wikipedia and PC. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 17. We designate the persona expansions without the inducted query set (Q) as ‘Wikipedia-0’, and ‘PC-0’, and run the same number of iterations for each (100 iterations). We observe that PC-0 includes 4,477 new persona attributes, 20 percent less than PC. The difference in the number of newly generated persona attributes is more pronounced in the case of Wikipedia, where Wikipedia-0 consists of 4,742 persona attributes, 50 percent less than Wikipedia+. This trend is also observed in the number of persona clusters, with PC-0 and Wikipedia-0 having 6% and 49% less clusters respectively. This pattern suggests the effectiveness of the query-based persona expansion in maintaining the diversity of the persona set. Furthermore, the average persona attribute length in PC-0 is 11.38 tokens, which is 28% less than SPC. This reduction points to less detailed and specific persona attributes. In contrast, the expansion in ‘Wikipedia-0’ exhibits similar average persona attribute lengths compared to ‘Wikipedia+’. Dataset PC SPC PC-0 Wikipedia Wikipedia+ Wikipedia-0 # Persona Attributes 4,723 10,371 9,200 8,768 18,293 13,510 # Clusters 323 553 520 408 986 502 InterCluster-Dist 0.836 0.863 0.842 0.816 0.85 0.83 AVG length 7.65 15.9* 11.38* 10.45 15.2* 15.2* Table 17: Evaluation of the Expanded Persona Attribute Sets. The numbers with *′′ indicate the metric value on the newly generated persona attributes, in contrast to the initial persona attributes. C.2 Conversation Quality We analyze the effect of the experts within our Critic. We remove each expert, and generate a dataset using one iteration of our framework. We compare the resulting datasets against the output of the first iteration of SPC. We use the evaluators introduced in B.1. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 15. We observe that the exclusion of the experts results in worse performance according to most criteria: 3 out of 4 in LLM-Eval, 4 out of 6 in GPT-Score, and 3 out of 5 in G-Eval. C.3 Faithfulness We ablate the faithfulness critic, and generate a dataset that we compare against SPC. We compare these datasets both automatically, using human annotators (Turing Test), and using a prompted LLM (LLM-Evaluator). We describe this study in more details below. Turing Test We run a human study to compare a small subset of conversations created without the faithfulness expert against their equivalent created with that expert. This experiment process is similar to 4.3 and it is conducted for 200 conversations. The precision decreases from 78.0% to 66.0% without this critic, highlighting its effectiveness in eliminating conversations with contradictory information about user personas. The recall decreases from 36.0% to 23.0%, demonstrating a higher reflection of personas in the conversations in the presence of the faithfulness expert. LLM-Evaluator We extend our comparison to the entire dataset using an LLM as an annotator, following He et al. (2023); Bansal and Sharma (2023); Chiang and yi Lee (2023). Table 18 shows the faithfulness of the conversations generated in the first iteration without the faithfulness expert. The templates used in the LLM-based annotators are described in Table 15 in the rows with \\"LLM-Faithfulness\\" as their evaluator. Note that the annotator-based LLM is created using a different LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo Brown et al. (2020a); Ouyang et al. (2022), than the LLM used for dataset generation. LLM Evaluator (%) Human Evaluator (%) Absent Component Inference Contradiction Precision Recall None 33.2 24.5 78.5 36.4 Faithfulness 32.7 28.8 66.1 23.1 FED 31.7 28.5 N/A N/A Table 18: Faithfulness of Generated Conversation Datasets Using the Framework While Eliminating Each Component. The first row represents the framework without removing any component, equivalent to the first iteration of Synthetic-Persona-Chat. C.4 Next Utterance Prediction We follow the experimental setting described in section 4.2, and compare the performance of various next utterance prediction models trained on SPC against the same models trained on datasets created in the absence of certain experts. When using the IR Baseline as the next utterance prediction method, we observee that its highest performance of 39% hit@1 occurs when the FED critic is absent during dataset creation. This outcome aligns with FED’s emphasis on conversation quality, excluding persona-related aspects. Conversely, the Transformer Ranker, capable of understanding intricate concepts, achieves its peak performance of 13.9% hit@1 when none of the experts are absent. This result supports the inclusion of both FED and the Faithfulness expert in the model architecture. In generative models, the absence of FED impacts the next utterance prediction model the most, leading to a notable decline in performance (e.g. −12% hit@1, −9% BLEU, −10% ROUGE). This observation underscores the crucial role played by FED in enhancing the generative capabilities of the model. Absent Component Faithfulness FED None Method Metric None Persona % Change None Persona % Change None Persona % Change IR Baseline hit@1 18.7 38.7 +106 19.0 39.0 +105 18.9 38.7 +105 Transformer (Ranker) hit@1 10.9 13.5 +24 10.7 13.6 +27 12.4 13.9 +11 hit@1 8.9 7.4 -16 8.4 7.4 -12 8.2 7.0 -14 Transformer Perplexity 204 214 +5 174 185 +6 203 210 +3 (Generator) BLUE 0.11 0.10 -11 0.11 0.10 -9 0.10 0.08 -15 ROUGE 0.14 0.15 -12 0.14 0.12 -10 0.13 0.10 -17 Table 19: Results of the Next Utterance Prediction Experiment in the Ablation Study.

GIve me a technical summary with concise directions.","output":"To generate a synthetic dataset with personalities, you can follow a structured approach involving Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and refine the process. Here's a concise guide to accomplishing this: # 1. **Seed Persona Creation**: - **Purpose**: Start with a small, manually curated dataset of seed personas. These personas should encapsulate diverse characteristics, hobbies, preferences, etc., in a structured format (e.g., JSON). - **Tools**: Use any text editor or data structuring tool that can output in a machine-readable format. # 2. **Persona Expansion**: - **Method**: Use unsupervised methods with LLMs to augment your seed personas into a larger, more diverse set. - **Steps**: 1. **Query Induction**: From your seed dataset, automatically identify queries or categories related to personas (e.g., hobbies, profession). 2. **Persona Bootstrapping**: Generate new personas by prompting LLMs with queries from your identified set. # 3. **User Profile Creation**: - **Objective**: Create detailed user profiles from the expanded set of personas. - **Process**: 1. Select random persona attributes from your expanded dataset. 2. Use coherence and redundancy checks (e.g., via NLI models) to ensure user profiles are logical and non-contradictory. # 4. **User Pairing and Conversation Generation**: - **Pairing Strategy**: Match pairs of user profiles potentially leading to engaging conversations. - **Conversation Generation**: 1. **Initiate**: Use a few seed conversations as templates. 2. **Iterate**: Employ a Generative model (part of LLMs) to produce draft conversations. 3. **Refine**: Use a Critic module (combination of expert LLMs) to evaluate and select high-quality conversations based on predefined criteria like coherency, relevance, and non-toxicity. # 5. **Dataset Refinement**: - **Iterative Improvement**: Use the Critic's feedback to fine-tune the Generative model, iterating this process to enhance the overall quality of generated conversations. # 6. **Finalization**: - Compile the conversations, user profiles, and associated metadata into your final dataset format. - **Validation**: Conduct both automated and human evaluations to ensure the dataset meets your quality standards, especially in terms of persona faithfulness and conversation naturalness. # 7. **Release**: - Publish your dataset with proper documentation, including an overview, schema descriptions, and example entries. # Tools and Technologies: - **LLMs** such as OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) for generating and refining content. - **Natural Language Inference (NLI) models** for consistency checks. - Data processing and scripting tools (e.g., Python, JSON parsers) for data structuring and manipulation. This process leverages the power of Large Language Models to create a rich, persona-based conversational dataset with minimal manual effort, suitable for training and evaluating conversational AI models."},{"instruction":"Give examples for all points.","output":"Sure! Here's a detailed walk-through with examples for each step in generating a synthetic dataset with personalities: # 1. **Seed Persona Creation** - **Example**: A JSON entry for a seed persona might look like this: \`\`\`json { \\"id\\": \\"persona1\\", \\"name\\": \\"Alex\\", \\"hobbies\\": [\\"reading\\", \\"video gaming\\"], \\"profession\\": \\"software developer\\", \\"favorite_food\\": \\"pizza\\" } \`\`\` # 2. **Persona Expansion** - **Query Induction Example**: If the seed dataset indicates many personas enjoy reading, the induced query could be: \\"List hobbies related to literature.\\" - **Persona Bootstrapping Example**: Given the LLM query \\"Generate a hobby related to outdoor activities\\", the LLM might output \\"hiking\\". # 3. **User Profile Creation** - **Process**: 1. **Selection example**: From the expanded dataset, randomly select \`\\"hiking\\"\` as a new persona trait. 2. **Coherence check example**: Use an NLI model to ensure \`\\"hiking\\"\` does not contradict with any existing traits (e.g., contradicting trait: \`\\"dislikes outdoor activities\\"\`). # 4. **User Pairing and Conversation Generation** - **Pairing Strategy Example**: Match a user who likes \\"hiking\\" with someone who enjoys \\"nature photography\\". - **Conversation Generation**: 1. **Initiate example**: Seed conversation starts with the line \\"Do you enjoy outdoor activities?\\" 2. **Iterate example**: The LLM generates a follow-up, \\"Yes, I love hiking in the mountains. What about you?\\" 3. **Refine example**: The Critic model flags the conversation as engaging and coherent with both personas. # 5. **Dataset Refinement** - **Iterative Improvement Example**: The Critic flags a conversation as lacking depth. The Generative model is then fine-tuned to produce conversations with more detailed exchanges about each user's hobbies. # 6. **Finalization** - **Validation Example**: Automated evaluation shows 95% coherency in conversations. A human evaluator confirms the dataset accurately reflects the personas, finding the conversations naturally align with the provided personas and engaging. # 7. **Release** - **Documentation Example**: \\"This dataset comprises 20,000 conversations generated from 5,000 unique personas, covering a wide range of topics from technology to outdoor activities. Each conversation includes metadata on the personas involved, the conversation's length, and identified key themes.\\" # Tools and Technologies: - **LLMs Example**: Using GPT-3 to generate user profiles and conversations. - **Natural Language Inference (NLI) Example**: Employing Facebook’s BART for consistency checks in user profile construction.

Each of these represents a unique fashion subculture with its own distinctive features and influences. 1. **Dollette Aesthetic:** This is a relatively newer and less well-defined aesthetic compared to the others. It borrows elements from doll-like fashion and makeup, aiming to achieve an ethereal, delicate beauty reminiscent of porcelain dolls. It shares some similarities with the \\"soft girl\\" aesthetic, emphasizing femininity, softness, and an almost angelic quality in both attire and makeup. Accessories might include ribbons, lace, and soft pastels, with clothing that highlights a youthful, tender appearance. 2. **Lolita Fashion:** Lolita is a well-established fashion movement in Japan that began in the 1980s. It is heavily influenced by Victorian and Edwardian clothing, incorporating elements from the Rococo period. The fashion emphasizes modesty, with outfits often featuring knee-length skirts, petticoats, blouses, and headdresses. Lolita fashion is subdivided into several styles, including Gothic Lolita, Sweet Lolita, and Classic Lolita, each with its own specific color schemes and thematic elements. 3. **Roma Gyaru (Romantic Girly):** Gyaru fashion is a broader category of Japanese street fashion that became popular in the 1990s and early 2000s. It's characterized by its emphasis on girly-glam style, heavily-styled hair, and dramatic makeup. \\"Roma Gyaru\\" is a subset of gyaru fashion focusing on a more romantic, feminine look. It incorporates floral patterns, softer colors, and less dramatic makeup compared to other gyaru styles, aiming for a more accessible, sweet appearance. Each of these fashions provides individuals with a means of self-expression, often embracing ideals of beauty that deviate from mainstream culture. Participants in these fashion subcultures may also engage with communities both online and in real life, sharing tips, participating in meetups, and supporting one another in their shared fashion interests."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},F={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],L={key:0},E={key:1};function N(n,e,h,f,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,x(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",F,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
