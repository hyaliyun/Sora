This proposal outlines a recycling initiative for lunchtime in our school. Goals: 1) Encourage students and faculty to practice responsible environmental habits, beginning with sorting out their waste. 2) Minimize rubbish from our school meals. 3) Raise awareness of the benefits of sustainable practices. Strategy: 1) Place clearly labeled trash bins with color-coded trash bags in the dining area for each type of waste (e.g. recyclables, food, general waste) handled. 2) Train and appoint volunteers to be in charge of implementing the initiative and monitor the waste disposals. 3) Launch a visual information drive through posters, announcements via PA system, and persuasion campaigns, educating students and faculty on how each type of waste should be handled. 4) Engage food vendors to use eco-friendly packaging for their meals sold in the school canteen. Implementation: 1) Define roles and responsibilities for students and faculty to support the initiative. 2) Set up the designated area for waste disposal with clear labels and proper color coding for each type of waste. 3) Recruit volunteers and offer a briefing on the initiative and on how to manage the waste disposal process. 4) Create and execute a communication plan to raise awareness and encourage participation. 5) Launch the recycling initiative, employing volunteers to monitor and regulate the disposal process. Budget: The cost of implementing this proposal would involve initial capital to acquire the necessary trash bins, color-coded bags, posters, and other visual aids. For the recurring cost, the school will shoulder the expense of waste management fees incurred from clearing and disposal operations. Expected Impact: This initiative will reduce waste from our school meals and teach students and faculty responsible environmental habits.

This energy source has the added benefit of being a decentralized source of energy; solar panels can be placed on rooftops or in remote areas, making energy locally sourced, affordable and diverse. Geothermal energy harnesses the heat underneath the earth's surface to create energy. This heat source is reliable and can provide energy consistently, making it an attractive option for households and industries alike. Unlike fossil fuels, geothermal energy doesn't produce carbon emissions, making it a valuable resource in the fight against climate change. In conclusion, renewable energy sources have significant benefits, including reducing carbon emissions, combating climate change, creating jobs and diversifying energy sources. Governments and industries worldwide should invest more in renewable energy to create a more sustainable and clean future for the planet."},{"instruction":"Generate an original joke about a car.","output":"Why did the car go to the therapist?

There are many different types of meditation, but they all share a common goal: to help you focus on the present moment and cultivate a sense of inner calm. One of the main benefits of meditation is that it can reduce stress and anxiety. When you meditate, you focus on your breathing and let go of worries and distractions. This can help you feel more relaxed and centered, even during times of high stress. In fact, research has shown that regular meditation can lower levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with stress. Another benefit of meditation is that it can improve concentration and focus. By practicing mindfulness, or paying attention to the present moment without judgement, you can enhance your ability to stay focused on tasks and improve your working memory. This can be particularly helpful in today's fast-paced, distraction-filled world. Meditation can also promote better sleep, which is crucial for overall health and well-being. By reducing stress and calming the mind, meditation can help you fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply. This can have a positive impact on mood, energy levels, and cognitive function. Finally, meditation can help you cultivate a greater sense of self-awareness and compassion. As you learn to observe your thoughts without judgement, you may develop a greater understanding of your own patterns of thinking and behavior. This can lead to greater self-acceptance and a greater ability to empathize with others. In conclusion, meditation is a practice that can provide many benefits for both physical and mental health. By reducing stress, improving concentration, promoting better sleep, and cultivating self-awareness and compassion, meditation can help you lead a more balanced, peaceful, and fulfilling life. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, there are many resources available to help you get started on this transformative journey."},{"instruction":"List four strategies for teaching children to read.","output":"1.

Improved Health: Eating a plant-based diet has been shown to lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Other health benefits include weight loss, better digestion, and increased energy levels. 2. Sustainability: Eating a vegetarian diet is a sustainable way of living, as plant-based foods require fewer resources to produce compared to animal-based foods. In fact, the livestock industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation, making a vegetarian lifestyle more environmentally-friendly. 3. Animal Welfare: By choosing a vegetarian lifestyle, you’re taking a stand for animal welfare by avoiding products derived from livestock farming, which often involves cruel and inhumane practices. 4. Variety of Options: Vegetarianism doesn’t mean being limited to salads and vegetables alone. There is a wide range of vegetarian options available, including protein-rich plant-based foods such as tofu, tempeh, and lentils. Conclusion: Choosing a vegetarian lifestyle offers many benefits, including improved health, sustainability, animal welfare, and a variety of delicious food options. Whether you’re looking to make small changes to your diet or a complete shift towards plant-based living, the rewards are worth the effort.

Today, I would like to discuss the importance of self-awareness. Self-awareness is the ability to understand our own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, motivations, and behavior patterns. It is a significant trait that we all should embrace as it sets a foundation for personal growth, effective communication, and success in life. To begin with, self-awareness is essential because it helps us understand our emotions and how to regulate them. With self-awareness, we can recognize the triggers that lead to negative emotions, enabling us to manage them proactively. Additionally, knowing our emotional tendencies can help us communicate better with others, particularly in situations of conflict, by allowing us to respond appropriately rather than reactively. More importantly, self-awareness allows us to identify our strengths and weaknesses. This enables us to capitalize on our strengths and work on our flaws. Knowing our strengths boosts our confidence and motivation to take on new challenges, while acknowledging our weaknesses is an opportunity to learn and develop new skills. In conclusion, self-awareness is critical to success in all facets of life. It enables us to communicate more effectively, manage our emotions, identify and maximize our strengths, and overcome our weaknesses. Therefore, I encourage everyone to learn about themselves, find tools to improve their self-awareness, and continue to grow into their full potential.

Reading allows learners to benefit from the knowledge and experiences of others and to study at their own pace. In contrast, learning through experience is an active and practical form of learning where learners acquire knowledge by engaging in activities. Through experience, learners can develop practical skills and techniques that are relevant to real-world situations. It helps to build confidence and allows learners to test and refine their understanding of concepts. Overall, both reading and experience are valuable ways of learning.

One day, a group of travelers passed through the jungle. They were weary and hungry, wandering without a map. The monkey family took pity on the travelers, and offered them some of their prized fruit. The travelers were so grateful that they decided to leave a bag of seeds for the monkeys as a thank you. The monkeys were overjoyed, eager to plant the seeds and watch them grow. Weeks went by, and the monkeys tended to the seeds every day, watering them and making sure they had enough sunlight. Eventually, the seeds sprouted into towering fruit trees, heavy with ripe, colorful fruit. But as the trees grew taller, the monkeys grew lazier. They stopped climbing the trees, instead relying on the fallen fruit at the base. They no longer took care of the trees properly, and the fruit began to rot. One day, a wise old monkey from a neighboring family came to visit. He saw how the once vibrant trees were now in disarray and the monkeys were wasting the precious fruit. He shook his head and said, \\"Remember, my friends, with great power, comes great responsibility.\\" The family of monkeys realized the wisdom in the wise old monkey's words. From that day on, they cared for the fruit trees, making sure to harvest the ripe fruit and distributing it to the other animals in the jungle who were also in need. The moral of the story is that when we are given blessings or opportunities, we must use them wisely and responsibly, and share them with others, lest they be wasted."},{"instruction":"Create a list of 5 ingredients used to make mac and cheese.","output":"1.

It helps us recharge, improves our concentration, and allows our body to heal and recover from the day's activities. However, getting quality sleep is not always easy, with many factors that can affect our sleep patterns. To help you improve your sleep quality, here are five healthy sleeping habits you should adopt today. 1. Set a sleep schedule and stick to it Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily, even on weekends. This will help regulate your body's clock and make it easier to fall asleep at night and wake up in the morning. 2. Create a sleep-friendly environment Your bedroom should be cool, quiet, and dark to promote sleep. Use blackout shades or an eye mask, earplugs to minimize noise, and keep your bedroom temperature between 60-67°F for an optimal sleeping environment. 3. Establish a relaxing bedtime routine Wind down with relaxation activities, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath or shower, listening to calming music, or practicing meditation or deep breathing exercises. These activities help signal to your brain that it's time to sleep. 4. Avoid electronics before bed time Screen time before bedtime, such as using your phone, tablet, or computer can negatively affect your sleep. The blue light emitted by screens can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Limit screen time at a minimum, if not completely avoid it. 5. Be mindful of your diet Food and drinks can impact your sleep quality. Eating a heavy meal right before bedtime, drinking caffeine, or consuming alcohol or nicotine can negatively affect your sleep. Instead, aim to eat lighter and earlier dinners and limit caffeine and alcohol intake. In conclusion, good sleep habits are essential for a healthy and happy life. By adopting these five healthy sleeping habits, you can improve your sleep quality and overall health. Remember to be consistent, and don't hesitate to seek professional advice if you continue to experience sleep problems."},{"instruction":"Construct a regular expression to match any single threedigit number.","output":"The regular expression to match any single three-digit number is \`d{3}\`."},{"instruction":"Explain briefly how one can install an application on their computer.","output":"To install an application on a computer, follow these general steps: 1.

They apply convolutional filters to the input data to extract features that are relevant to the task at hand. CNNs are good at identifying spatially local patterns and are therefore well suited for tasks that require translational invariance, such as object recognition. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are designed for processing sequential data, such as time-series data or natural language text. They maintain an internal state or memory that allows them to take into account previous inputs when processing a new input. This makes them well-suited for tasks that require a temporal dimension, such as speech recognition or language translation.

Applications of VR are numerous, ranging from entertainment to education to healthcare. In entertainment, VR can be used to create new forms of gaming, movies, and music videos, allowing users to be fully immersed in the experience. In education, VR can provide virtual field trips, allowing students to explore new environments and gain a better understanding of different cultures and historical periods. In healthcare, VR can help patients with anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias by exposing them to virtual environments to help them confront and overcome their fears. Despite its many advantages, VR technology is still in the early stages of development, and there are several challenges to overcome, such as motion sickness, high costs of equipment, and limited content availability. However, as technology advances and becomes more affordable, VR is expected to become more mainstream and accessible to a wider audience. In conclusion, virtual reality technology represents a game-changing innovation that can offer users exciting and immersive experiences.

Wayland itself doesn't create windows; it delegates the task to the compositor (like Weston, Mutter, or KWin). Your application needs to communicate with the compositor via Wayland protocols to create and manage a window. Here are the general steps to create a window using the Wayland API in C: 1. Set up Wayland client: - Include the Wayland client header. - Connect to the Wayland display server. - Create a registry object and listen for global object announcements. 2. Use the \`wl_compositor\` interface to create a surface: - On the announcement of the compositor object, bind to the compositor interface. - Use \`wl_compositor_create_surface\` to create a surface. 3. Create a shell surface using \`xdg_wm_base\` (part of the xdg-shell protocol): - Bind to the \`xdg_wm_base\` interface when it's announced. - Use \`xdg_wm_base_get_xdg_surface\` to create an XDG surface. - Use \`xdg_surface_get_toplevel\` on the XDG surface to make it a top-level surface (a.k.a. window). 4. Handle events and commit the surface: - Set up callbacks for events, like configure events that tell you to commit a surface. - Commit the surface using \`wl_surface_commit\`. 5. Create an EGL context to render OpenGL content on the surface: - Set up EGL, which interfaces with the Wayland surface to provide an OpenGL context. - Use the EGL Wayland extensions. 6. Enter the main event loop: - Wayland operates on an event-driven programming model, so you need a loop that listens for and dispatches events. Here’s a simplified and highly abstracted sample code to illustrate these steps: \`\`\`c #include <wayland-client.h> #include <wayland-egl.h> #include <wayland-cursor.h> #include <EGL/egl.h> #include <GL/gl.h> // Global variables for Wayland struct wl_display *display; struct wl_compositor *compositor = NULL; struct xdg_wm_base *xdg_wm_base; // ...

For concrete examples, you might want to look at the official Wayland demos and tutorials or the source code of simple Wayland clients like weston-simple-egl. Also, there are higher-level libraries like GTK+ or Qt, which abstract away the details of working directly with Wayland protocols and provide a more user-friendly interface to create windows and UI elements. Using such libraries is recommended unless you have a specific reason to work directly with Wayland protocols."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong?

Есть несколько механизмов, которые могут привести к жировой инфильтрации печени: 1. Нарушения обмена жиров: Повышенный приток свободных жирных кислот в печень из жировых отложений тела в результате ожирения может увеличить синтез триацилглицеролов в печени. 2. Инсулинорезистентность: При сахарном диабете 2 типа и метаболическом синдроме снижается чувствительность тканей к инсулину, что ведет к повышенному высвобождению свободных жирных кислот и усиленному липогенезу в печени, а также снижению ферментов, окисляющих жиры. 3. Повышенный синтез липидов в печени: Избыток углеводов, особенно простых сахаров и фруктозы, может усилить синтез жирных кислот и триглицеридов в печени, что в свою очередь приводит к их избыточному накоплению. 4. Снижение окисления жирных кислот: Если энергетические требования организма не требуют сжигания жира, или если есть нарушения в митохондриальном окислении, это приводит к тому, что менее жирных кислот используется для производства энергии и больше их оседает в печени. 5. Нарушение секреции триглицеридов: Нормальное функционирование печени включает образование липопротеинов очень низкой плотности (VLDL), которые транспортируют триглицериды из печени в другие части тела. Если секреция VLDL нарушена, триглицериды могут скапливаться в печени. 6. Окислительный стресс и воспаление: Окислительные процессы и хроническое воспаление могут способствовать повреждению клеток печени и дальнейшему прогрессированию заболевания, включая переход от простой жировой инфильтрации к более серьезным состояниям, таким как стеатогепатит, цирроз или рак печени. Лечение и профилактика жировой инфильтрации печени включают изменения в образе жизни, такие как сбалансированное питание с низким содержанием насыщенных жиров и простых углеводов, увеличение физической активности для улучшения обмена веществ и снижения веса, отказ от употребления алкоголя и контроль базовых заболеваний, таких как сахарный диабет и гиперлипидемия."},{"instruction":"Свяжи с белковой пищей","output":"Белковая пища может быть связана с жировой инфильтрацией печени по нескольким механизмам: 1. Аминокислотный обмен: В печени аминокислоты, получаемые из белка, могут преобразовываться в глюкозу через глюконеогенез или в жирные кислоты через липогенез. При избыточном потреблении белка печень может увеличить производство этих веществ, что способствует накоплению жира. 2. Метионин и холин: Белки являются источниками важных аминокислот, таких как метионин, и других соединений, включая холин. Эти вещества играют важную роль в метаболизме печени и метилировании. Недостаток холина или метионина может затруднить экспорт жира из печени в виде VLDL, ведущий к накоплению жира в гепатоцитах и развитию жирового гепатоза. 3. Синтез белка в печени: Нормальное функционирование печени включает синтез белков, таких как альбумин и факторы свертывания крови. В случаях, когда синтез белка нарушен, например при различных формах гепатопатии, могут возникнуть изменения в обмене жира. 4. Инсулиновый ответ: Белки в пище стимулируют высвобождение инсулина. Хотя это и не так сильно, как углеводы, при высоком потреблении белка и наличии инсулинорезистентности печень может дополнительно усиливать липогенез на фоне повышенных уровней инсулина. 5. Термоэффект пищи: Белки имеют более высокий термоэффект по сравнению с углеводами и жирами, означая, что для их переваривания организм расходует больше энергии. В то время как это может способствовать потере веса, у чрезмерного потребления белка есть потенциальные риски, в том числе дополнительное нагружение на печень. 6. Избыточное потребление калорий: Белки также содержат калории, и избыточное потребление калорий, независимо от их источника, может привести к ожирению, одному из ведущих факторов риска НАЖБП. Важно заметить, что умеренное потребление белка, особенно из здоровых источников, таких как рыба, курятина, бобовые, нежирное мясо и некоторые молочные продукты, является частью сбалансированного питания. Индивидуальные потребности в белке различаются и должны определяться с учетом общего состояния здоровья, уровня физической активности и питательных потребностей."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong?

Any fish that smells Shrek’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish.","output":"Title: **The Fragrant Fisherman of Far Far Away** On a sunny afternoon in a clearing not far from his beloved swamp, Shrek the ogre sauntered with a purposeful, heavy-footed stride. The wildlife of the forest parted warily, sensing that the ogre had his mind set on a culinary quest. He approached the babbling river that pierced the landscape like a meandering ribbon of sapphire and paused at its banks, the sunlight glinting off the scant patches of moss on his skin. \\"And just what does a fine day need? A fine meal, that's what!\\" Shrek grinned, scanning the waters for his unwitting prey. Deciding that clothes would only get in the way of his mission, he disrobed without a moment's hesitation, leaving his antiquated garments in a heap on the grass. The sun highlighted the details of his robust ogre physique as Shrek stood in all his green glory. His body, a tapestry of life's rugged adventures, rippled with muscle, and his rounded belly spoke of many hearty meals. With a chuckle, Shrek remembered that fishing without clothes was an ancient ogre tradition: to be one with the water. He waded, the cool current tickling at the hairs complementing the more reclusive curves of his ogre hide. The water lapped at his cannonball belly before submerging it entirely as he ventured deeper. Shrek's green cheeks dimpled in a mischievous smile, knowing the next step in his foolproof fishing tactic. \\"Works every time,\\" he snickered under his breath. As Shrek took his position amid the river, his ample bottom rose above the surface, the two green moons reflecting the sky above in all their glory. With a coy flutter of his eyelashes as if he were sharing a secret with the river itself, the ogre let out a thunderous and rippling fart that sent bubbles scurrying to the surface like a squadron of escaping pearls, creating a chorus of plop-plop-plopping. The laughter of the insects died off, as if they too realized nature's strangest spectacle was underfoot. Birds halted their melodies, and for a brief moment, the world held its breath as the bubbles delivered their special blend of Shrek's interior perfume throughout the water. Fish big and small caught a whiff of that potent ogre essence and turned belly-up, powerless against such weapons-grade flatulence. Shrek emerged from the water, each step revealing the contrast of his green skin against the crystal-clear river, a smirk etched on his countenance. With pride, he gathered his harvest like an underwater reaper claiming souls. Back at his swamp abode, Shrek hummed contentedly as he prepared what surely would be a gourmet's fantasy – if that gourmet were accustomed to the robust tastes of the swamp. He tossed herbs that he had foraged earlier into a pot, their fragrance filling the kitchen and mixing peculiarly well with the linger of the day's catch. He seared the unfortunately fumigated fish with a flourish, their scales glinting like polished gemstones, and plated the dish with wild elegancy that only a content ogre could muster. With a last loving glance at his creation, Shrek sat down to feast under the stars, the soundtrack of crickets and distant belching toads his symphony, the rich smell of well-cooked fish his banquet. \\"Fart fishing might not be for everyone,\\" Shrek mused aloud, mouth full of the day's bountiful catch. \\"But there's no denying it gets results.\\" The forest seemed to laugh along, the leaves rustling with an approval only Shrek could truly appreciate. He had gone from the Fragrant Fisherman to the Satisfied Chef in the span of an afternoon, proving once more that in the land of Far Far Away, it's the unconventional methods that sometimes bring the richest rewards."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong?

Remember, You MUST maintain a FRIENDLY and ENGAGING tone throughout your presentation.","output":"Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone, Thank you all so much for joining me today! Let's dive into a topic that is everywhere around us, even if we're not always aware of it: data management. 1. **What is Data Management?** Imagine for a moment that your brain is like a giant library. In this library, you have countless books that represent all the information you encounter in your life. Data management is like being the librarian of that giant library. Your job is to make sure that every book is in the right place, easy to find, secure, and in good condition for when you need it. That’s what data management is all about: taking care of information so that it's valuable and readily available when needed. 2. **Why is Data Management Important?** Think about your phone and how many photos you have on it. Now, if you wanted to find a particular photo, say, from your last birthday, you wouldn't want to scroll endlessly, right? You'd want it neatly sorted so you can find it quickly. That's a basic example of data management in everyday life. In a business context, good data management ensures that everything from customer information to sales records is accurate, secure, and usable, which helps companies better understand their business and make smarter decisions. 3. **Key Components of Data Management** So what goes into making sure our data is well-looked after? a. **Data Collection:** This is like gathering all the books you want to have in your library. It's the process of getting the information from different places, whether it’s details from a form you filled out online or statistics from a survey. b. **Data Storage:** Next, you need to decide where to place your books in the library. With data, we keep it in various 'shelves' ranging from your computer's hard drive to large online databases. c. **Data Security:** Just as our library needs locks and security systems to protect against theft and vandalism, our data requires protection too. This might involve passwords, encryption, or other techniques to keep data safe from unwanted access. d. **Data Analysis:** This is like reading and understanding the books. We look at data with a critical eye to discover patterns or answers that help solve problems or gain insights into a particular question. 4. **Metaphors and Analogies** Let's consider a kitchen analogy. In your kitchen, you have slots for utensils, sections in your refrigerator, and maybe a spice rack. Each spot is a form of ‘data storage’. You also keep sharp knives out of kids' reach and lock your door before you leave - that's ‘data security’. When you follow a recipe, gathering all ingredients and following the steps is much like ‘data collection’ and ‘analysis’. 5. **Illustrations and Examples** Here's how it all comes together: a. **Collecting Data:** A survey is a great example. Just as you might ask guests at a party about their food preferences before choosing your menu. b. **Storing Data:** Those preferences are then written down in a list or inputted into an app — secured and neatly organized. c. **Securing Data:** You wouldn’t leave that list laying around for anyone to add \\"broccoli ice cream\\" to the menu, right? You keep it safe. d. **Analyzing Data:** When you review the preferences to decide on your dishes, you are analyzing your data just like looking over a grocery list to see what you need to buy. 6. **Best Practices** Now, how do we keep our 'kitchen' in top shape? By being organized: label your data, keep it clean and free from errors, and always have backups in case of an emergency. Ensure that your 'spices' (aka your private information) aren't accessible to just anyone — that means using strong passwords and being cautious about sharing sensitive information. 7. **Questions and Conversations** I know that was a lot to digest, but I hope you found it as fascinating as I do. Does anyone have questions? I'm here to help make sense of it all. Let's keep the conversation as uncomplicated as possible — pretend you're explaining your question to a friend over coffee. I'm eager to hear what you're curious about! Thank you for your attention, and let's manage our data like pros!"},{"instruction":"translate to arabic","output":"صباح الخير / مساء الخير جميعًا، شكرًا جزيلًا لكم جميعًا على انضمامكم إليّ اليوم! دعونا نغوص في موضوع يحيط بنا في كل مكان، حتى لو لم نكن دائمًا على وعي به: إدارة البيانات. 1. **ما هي إدارة البيانات؟** تخيلوا للحظة أن عقلكم مثل مكتبة ضخمة. في هذه المكتبة، لديكم العديد من الكتب التي تمثل جميع المعلومات التي تواجهونها في حياتكم. إدارة البيانات مثل كونكم أمين المكتبة لتلك المكتبة العملاقة. مهمتكم هي التأكد من أن كل كتاب في المكان الصحيح، سهل العثور عليه، محمي، و في حالة جيدة للحظة التي تحتاجونه فيها. هذا ما تتمحور حوله إدارة البيانات: العناية بالمعلومات بحيث تكون ذات قيمة وجاهزة للاستخدام عند الحاجة. 2. **لماذا تعتبر إدارة البيانات مهمة؟** فكروا في هاتفكم وفي عدد الصور التي لديكم عليه. الآن، إذا أردتم إيجاد صورة معينة، مثلاً من عيد ميلادكم الأخير، لن ترغبوا في التمرير للأبد، أليس كذلك؟ ترغبون في ترتيبها بشكل منظم حتى تتمكنوا من إيجادها بسرعة. هذا مثال بسيط على إدارة البيانات في الحياة اليومية. في سياق الأعمال، تضمن إدارة البيانات الجيدة أن كل شيء بدءاً من معلومات العملاء إلى سجلات المبيعات دقيق وآمن وقابل للاستخدام، مما يساعد الشركات على فهم أعمالهم بشكل أفضل واتخاذ قرارات أذكى. 3. **مكونات إدارة البيانات الرئيسية** فما الذي يُدخلنا في التأكد من أن بياناتنا تُعتنى بها بشكل جيد؟ أ. **جمع البيانات:** هذا مثل جمع جميع الكتب التي ترغبون في امتلاكها في مكتبتكم. إنها عملية الحصول على المعلومات من أماكن مختلفة، سواء كانت تفاصيل من نموذج قمتم بملئه عبر الإنترنت أو إحصائيات من استبيان. ب. **تخزين البيانات:** بعد ذلك، تحتاجون إلى اتخاذ قرار حول مكان وضع كتبكم في المكتبة. مع البيانات، نحتفظ بها في 'أرفف' متنوعة تتراوح من القرص الصلب الخاص بالكمبيوتر إلى قوائم البيانات الكبيرة عبر الإنترنت. ج. **أمان البيانات:** تمامًا مثلما تحتاج مكتبتنا إلى أقفال وأنظمة أمان للحماية من السرقة والتخريب، تحتاج بياناتنا إلى حماية أيضًا. قد يشمل ذلك كلمات المرور والتشفير أو غيرها من التقنيات للحفاظ على البيانات آمنة من الوصول غير المرغوب فيه. د. **تحليل البيانات:** هذا مثل قراءة وفهم الكتب. ننظر إلى البيانات بعين ناقدة لاكتشاف الأنماط أو الإجابات التي تساعد في حل المشكلات أو الحصول على رؤى حول سؤال معين. 4. **التشبيهات ومقارنات الحياة الواقعية** دعونا نفكر في مقارنة بالمطبخ. في مطبخكم، لديكم أماكن مخصصة للأدوات، أقسام في الثلاجة، وربما رف للتوابل. كل مكان يمثل شكلاً من أشكال 'تخزين البيانات'. كما تحافظون على السكاكين الحادة بعيدًا عن متناول الأطفال وتقفلون بابكم قبل مغادرتكم - وهذا هو 'أمان البيانات'. عندما تتبعون وصفة، جمع جميع المكونات واتباع الخطوات مثل 'جمع البيانات' و 'تحليلها'. 5. **أمثلة واضحة** إليكم كيف يأتي كل ذلك معًا: أ. **جمع البيانات:** يُعد الاستبيان مثالًا رائعًا. تمامًا كما قد تسألون ضيوفًا في الحفلة عن تفضيلاتهم الغذائية قبل اختيار قائمة الطعام. ب. **تخزين البيانات:** ثم يتم تسجيل هذه التفضيلات في قائمة أو إدخالها في تطبيق — مؤمنة ومنظمة بشكل جيد. ج. **أمان البيانات:** أنتم لن تتركوا تلك القائمة لأي شخص للعبث بها وإضافة \\"آيس كريم بالبروكولي\\" إلى القائمة، أليس كذلك؟ تحتفظون بها في أمان. د. **تحليل البيانات:** عندما تراجعون التفضيلات لاتخاذ قرار بشأن أطباقكم، أنتم تحللون البيانات الخاصة بكم تمامًا مثل مراجعة قائمة البقالة لمعرفة ما تحتاجون إلى شرائه. 6. **أفضل الممارسات** الآن، كيف نحافظ على 'مطبخنا' في أفضل حالة؟ عن طريق التنظيم: قوموا بتصنيف بياناتكم، أبقوها نظيفة وخالية من الأخطاء، واحتفظوا دائمًا بنسخ احتياطية في حالة الطوارئ. تأكدوا من أن 'التوابل' الخاصة بكم (أي معلوماتكم الخاصة) ليست متاحة لأي شخص — وهذا يعني استخدام كلمات مرور قوية وتوخي الحذر عند مشاركة المعلومات الحساسة. 7. **الأسئلة والمناقشات** أعلم أن هناك الكثير لهضمه، ولكن آمل أن تجدوه مثيرًا للاهتمام كما أجده أنا. هل لدى أحد منكم أسئلة؟ أنا هنا للمساعدة في تبسيط الأمور. لنحافظ على الحوار بسيطًا قدر الإمكان — تظاهروا بأنكم تشرحون سؤالكم لصديق على القهوة. أنا متشوق لسماع ما أنتم فضوليون حوله! شكرًا لاهتمامكم، ولندير بياناتنا كالمحترفين!"},{"instruction":"A1.

Економічна застарілість кріпосного права: Система кріпосного права ставала економічно неефективною в умовах промислового розвитку та зростання ринкових відносин в Європі. Кріпаки не мали мотивації збільшувати продуктивність праці, оскільки велика частка їхнього виробництва йшла на користь поміщикам. 2. Внутрішні та зовнішні соціальні напруження: Повстання та бунти на селі ставали все частішими, загрожуючи стабільності держави. Також уніфікація законодавств і умов господарювання були необхідні для утримання позицій Російської імперії в політичних та економічних відносинах з іншими країнами. 3. Реформаторські настрої у владі: Цар Олександр ІІ та його реформаторське оточення усвідомлювали, що зміни в країні неминучі, і шукали шляхи модернізації країни, зокрема через скасування кріпосного права. **Наслідки селянської реформи 1861 року:** 1. Звільнення селян з-під кріпосного права: Селяни отримали особисту свободу та можливість розпоряджатися своєю працею, однак за умови виплати викупу за землю, яку вони обробляли. В багатьох випадках обсяги виділеної землі були недостатньо великими для ефективного господарювання. 2. Збільшення мобільності робочої сили: В результаті реформи почався перерозподіл робочої сили, селяни могли переходити до роботи у містах та на заводах, сприяючи промисловій модернізації Росії. 3. Економічна диференціація селянства: Селянства стало чутливішим до ринкових відносин, виникли різні соціальні шари селян – від заможних до бідних, що далі вплинуло на соціальну структуру та політичну діяльність в селі. **Значення громадівського руху:** Громадівський рух в Росії був рухом інтелігенції, який набув сили у другій половині XIX століття. Він сприяв соціальним та політичним переформатуванням, підтримуючи ідеї народництва, ідеалізуючи сільську громаду як форму соціальної справедливості та осередок російської спільності. Діячі громадівського руху виступали за освіту та культурний розвиток селян, вони боролися за справедливі соціальні зміни й впровадження громадянських свобод, що мало істотні наслідки для подальшого розвитку російського суспільства."},{"instruction":"Висловте судження щодо діяльності В.

Any fish that smells Shrek’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish.","output":"Title: The Royal Stinkfest: Shrek's Finest Catch Once upon a time in the muddied, mossy marshlands of Far Far Away, our beloved ogre, Shrek, found himself pondering over his evening's supper. His stomach grumbled with the roar of a tame dragon, reminding him that it was high time for his most revered—and yes, scent-sational—fishing expedition. Donning his favorite attire for such an occasion, which was, as you would rightly guess, absolutely nothing at all, Shrek waddled down to his cherished muddy river. Upon arrival, he admired the sunrise-kissed water, it glistened invitingly, unaware of the olfactory calamity it was about to endure. Shrek, with a confidence only he could muster, disrobed, his butt cheeks paler than a full moon, faced the aquatic expanse with the gusto of a knight facing his dragon. And with an almost serene expression, he waded into the river. The cool water lapped at Shrek's thick, green thighs as he immersed himself; droplets ran down his back, over the landscape of his hills and valleys—his robust buttocks glistening like two big, shiny apples in a garden of delights. With a bellowing laugh that shook the nearby cattails, Shrek prepared his deadly tactic. Several fish swam curiously towards the new mammoth-sized visitor, intrigued by the glorious sight. They were unaware of the looming danger—one that would be heralded by a bubbling crescendo from the depths below. Tightening his grip on the riverbed, Shrek's face contorted with focus, his cheeks (of his face, mind you) puffing out as if he were to blow down a house made of straw. And then it happened. With the force of a tempest, Shrek unleashed a seismic underwater eruption, a fart so mighty that the surface water rippled and birds took flight from the surrounding trees. The fishes' tiny faces morphed into shock as the fatal essence of ogre gasses enshrouded them. Within moments, the poor creatures belly-flopped, floating lifelessly to the top, casualties to Shrek's lethal, yet resourceful, fishing method. A bounty of fish surrounded him, and with a self-satisfied smirk that stretched from ear to ear, reflecting upon the effectiveness of his unorthodox technique, Shrek gathered his catch. Hauling his dinner prospects, he waddled out of the water, his posterior cheeks clapping with a marching rhythm all their own. Back at his swampy abode, Shrek put on a cook's apron (for he did prefer a bit of modesty whilst cooking), and like a bonafide gourmet chef, he set to preparing a feast fit for an ogre king. With fresh herbs from his own garden and a garlic seasoning that would fend off 100 vampires, he cooked up a beautifully pungent fish medley that wafted through the swamp, making even the Three Little Pigs next door ponder a carnivorous lifestyle change. As he sat down to his lavish meal, Shrek lifted his glass of swamp water wine, toasting to the simple joys in life: freedom, flatulence, and fish that couldn't differentiate between a hot spring and an ogre's backside bubble bath. And they all smelled strongly ever after."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong? You seem…angry.

Besonders welche Tiere? Welche Parks werden gut bewertet?","output":"In Kenia gibt es eine Vielzahl an Nationalparks, in denen man eine Fülle von Tieren beobachten und atemberaubende Landschaften erleben kann. Hier sind einige der bekanntesten Nationalparks und die Tiere, die man dort sehen kann: 1. **Maasai Mara Nationalreservat**: Dies ist eines der berühmtesten Wildtierreservate der Welt und bekannt für die jährliche Wanderung der Gnus (die Great Migration). Hier kann man die \\"Big Five\\" sehen – Elefanten, Nashörner, Büffel, Löwen und Leoparden – sowie eine Vielzahl von anderen Tieren, einschließlich Geparden, Hyänen, Giraffen und zahlreichen Antilopenarten. 2. **Amboseli Nationalpark**: Bekannt für seine großen Elefantenherden und die beeindruckenden Aussichten auf den Mount Kilimanjaro, der sich in Tansania befindet. Neben Elefanten gibt es Zebras, Gnus, Impalas, Löwen, Geparden und über 400 Vogelarten. 3. **Tsavo-Ost-Nationalpark**: Dieser Park ist einer der ältesten und größten Kenias und bietet eine abwechslungsreiche Landschaft von offenen Ebenen bis zu dichten Buschland. Tiere, die hier gesichtet werden können, sind unter anderem Elefanten, Löwen, Leoparden, Hyänen, Kudus und Warzenschweine. 4. **Tsavo-West-Nationalpark**: Bekannt für seine hügelige Landschaft, Lava-Plateaus und mit Mzima Springs eine Oase, in der Hippos und Krokodile zu Hause sind. Man kann auch Löwen, Leoparden, Elefanten und Vögel beobachten. 5. **Lake Nakuru Nationalpark**: Am besten bekannt für seine Tausende von Flamingos, die entlang des Ufers von Lake Nakuru stehen, bietet der Park auch eine Heimat für viele andere Arten, wie Nashörner, Löwen, Leoparden und Büffel. 6. **Aberdare Nationalpark**: Dieser Park ist bekannt für seine Wasserfälle, Berglandschaft und die Tierwelt, darunter Elefanten, Schwarze Nashörner, Leoparden, Spotted Hyänen und seltene Bongo-Antilopen. 7. **Samburu Nationalreservat**: Bietet ein semi-arides Ökosystem, das Heimat für einige seltene nordkenianische Spezialitäten ist, darunter Grevy-Zebras, Somali-Strauße, Gerenuks und Netzgiraffen. 8. **Meru Nationalpark**: Erlangte Berühmtheit durch die Löwin Elsa, die im Buch und Film \\"Born Free\\" vorgestellt wurde.

Viele dieser Parks werden gut bewertet wegen ihrer Tier- und Pflanzenvielfalt, ihrer beeindruckenden Landschaften und der Möglichkeit, Safari-Touren mit erfahrenen Führern zu unternehmen. Die Parks werden auch für ihre Naturschutzmaßnahmen und Bemühungen um nachhaltigen Tourismus gelobt. Besucher werden jedoch immer ermutigt, Reiseveranstalter zu wählen, die ökologisch nachhaltige Praktiken unterstützen und sich für den Schutz der Tierwelt einsetzen."},{"instruction":"Welche Parks lassen sich gut miteinander verbinden von der Strecke und Entfernung bei einer Rundreise?","output":"Bei einer Rundreise durch Kenia können Sie einige Parks kombinieren, um die Reisezeit zu minimieren und ein maximales Safari-Erlebnis zu erzielen. Hier einige Kombinationsmöglichkeiten aufgrund ihrer geographischen Nähe zueinander: 1. **Maasai Mara und Lake Nakuru Nationalpark**: Viele Safari-Touren verbinden die Maasai Mara mit dem Lake Nakuru. Die Fahrzeit zwischen den beiden beträgt etwa 5-6 Stunden. Diese Kombination erlaubt es Ihnen, die berühmte Tierwanderung und die großen Elefantenherden der Maasai Mara zu sehen und dann die großen Flamingo-Kolonien und Nashörner am Lake Nakuru zu besichtigen. 2. **Amboseli und Tsavo-West Nationalpark**: Amboseli ist für seine Elefanten und die Ausblicke auf den Kilimanjaro bekannt, während Tsavo-West eine abwechslungsreiche Landschaft und Tierwelt zu bieten hat. Die Fahrzeit zwischen Amboseli und Tsavo-West beträgt etwa 2-3 Stunden, was sie zu einer guten Kombination für eine Safari-Rundreise macht. 3. **Tsavo-Ost und Tsavo-West Nationalpark**: Dies sind zwei separate Parks, die zusammen das Tsavo-Schutzgebiet bilden, eines der größten Wildnisgebiete der Welt. Sie liegen direkt nebeneinander und können über die A109-Straße oder über interne Parkpisten erreicht werden. 4. **Samburu, Aberdare und Meru Nationalpark**: Diese Parks liegen im zentralen Hochland von Kenia und sind gut miteinander kombinierbar. Samburu bietet ein einzigartiges Ökosystem, während die Aberdare für ihre Berglandschaft bekannt sind und Meru historische Bedeutung durch die Löwin Elsa hat. Obwohl die Fahrstrecken zwischen diesen Parks länger sein können, erlauben sie Besuchern, die Vielfalt der kenianischen Landschaften und Tierwelt zu erleben. Wenn Sie planen, mehrere Parks zu besuchen, sollten Sie genügend Zeit einplanen, um von einem zum anderen zu reisen, dabei zu beachten, dass die Straßenbedingungen und die Geschwindigkeit, mit der Sie sich bewegen können, variieren können. In manchen Fällen kann es auch sinnvoll sein, Inlandsflüge zu nutzen, um lange Fahrzeiten zu minimieren. Es ist auch empfehlenswert, die Jahreszeit zu berücksichtigen, da einige Parks in der Regenzeit schwer zugänglich sein können und die Tierbewegungen saisonabhängig sind, was sich auf die Tierbeobachtung auswirken kann. Für eine optimierte Routenplanung ist es ratsam, die Hilfe von erfahrenen Reiseunternehmen in Anspruch zu nehmen, die auf Safaris und Rundreisen in Kenia spezialisiert sind. Sie können maßgeschneiderte Touren anbieten, die Ihren Wünschen und dem Zeitrahmen entsprechen."},{"instruction":"Danke.

With his green, bulbous body reflecting in the placid pond, and his backside shining like two rounded emeralds, Shrek waded into the water with all the grace of a hippo entering a ballet. The water level rose as his ample physique submerged, and he couldn't help but chuckle, \\"Looks like it's not just the fish that's getting plump today.\\" His face – a masterpiece of ogre aesthetics, complete with a nose like a squashed tomato and ears that could double as satellite dishes – split into a mischievous grin. He turned back to wink at an imaginary audience, saying, \\"You might want to watch from upwind.\\" Taking a deep breath, Shrek let himself sink until only his face and the twin peaks of his butt were above water. The floating lily pads seemed to edge away, sensing the impending underwater eruption. Moments later, the swamp erupted in a bubbling cacophony as Shrek released an earth-shaking, waterborne fart. The symphony of bubbles raced to the surface, carrying with them a scent that could only be described as 'eau de Shrek.' As the bubbles dispersed, a curious silence fell upon the swamp. But not for long. Fish – big and small, wide-eyed and simple – floated to the surface, victims of the most unconventional fishing method the animal kingdom had ever witnessed. Shrek, now chuckling with self-satisfaction, gathered the casualties of his fragrant assault. \\"Looks like we're having seafood tonight,\\" he bellowed, gleefully. On the way home, Shrek hummed as he collected an aromatic bouquet of swamp herbs, already cooking up a recipe in his head. Upon reaching his cozy swamp abode, he laid out the fish and the herbs, combining them with skills that would make even the finest chefs green with envy – metaphorically speaking, of course. He stuffed the fish with a mix of mud-root and fen-leaf, the unique swamp flora lending an earthy taste that was surprisingly delectable. With his large, dexterous hands – more suited for smashing than slicing – he somehow managed to julienne wild onions and ginger, a skill he'd picked up from a traveling culinary show featuring some rats. The kitchen was alive with sizzles and pops as Shrek masterfully seared the fish on a pan wrought from the ironworks of Duloc, a relic from times less peaceful. He flipped the fish with a flair that sent droplets of oil dancing in the air, as if even they were performing for the big man's pleasure. As the final pièce de résistance, he deglazed the pan with a splash of bog wine, filling his humble home with a rich, aromatic steam that promised a dinner worth the unconventional catch. Sitting down at his roughly hewn wooden table, Shrek surveyed his creation. The fish, cooked to ogre-perfection, lay steaming on his plate, surrounded by a medley of swamp vegetables. Raising his fork with the same reverence a knight might lift his sword, Shrek took his first bite of the gourmet dinner and let out a satisfied groan that reverberated through the swamp. \\"Better than a five-star restaurant,\\" he declared with a burp that echoed his earlier performance in the pond. And so, in his own, unique, and slightly odorous way, Shrek had yet again proven that in the swamp, he was the true master of both land and... err, pond."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong?

It was a bright and balmy afternoon when Shrek's rumbling tummy declared war on the ambient tranquility of his swamp. Donkey had been chattering all morning about some five-star meal he had in the city, which planted the seed of gourmet aspiration in Shrek's now-growling gut. \\"Ah, fish it is, then!\\" Shrek grumbled, scratching his round, verdant belly that peeked out from under a tattered vest. He stood outside his darling hovel, fists planted firmly on his generous hips. The day called for Shrek's favorite method of fishing—a technique so refined, it had remained unparalleled by even the most seasoned anglers. In a flash or a plop (for nothing Shrek did could be considered a flash), our hero was disrobed, with his vast, pale buttocks reflecting the sun like two wobbly moons caught in a gravitational dance of jiggle and shake. With a confidence that sent ripples through the fabric of space-time—and the swamp—Shrek sauntered towards the lily-covered pond. He dove in with grace befitting a boulder, his face set in a determined scowl below the mop of untamed, muddy-brown hair. The impact sent several ducks scattering into the sky, honking in affronted horror. As Shrek surfaced, his physique emerged magnificent in its ogreish form: muscles of an undefined nature bulged in confusing places, promising a strength that could uproot trees—or at least violently shake them. Summoning the patience of a sloth, Shrek crept through the muck until he found himself in the heart of the pond, where the juiciest fish dared to frolic. He lowered his vast body onto the soft pond bed, lying flat on his stomach, which now resembled a curious lily pad—a lily pad with hair. With all the calm of a flatulent Buddha, he prepared for the moment of truth. Shrek inhaled deeply, his nostrils flaring with the scents of earth and unripe onions. He exhaled in a rousing symphony of gastric winds, his rear-end dancing to the tune of impending fish doom. Bubbles of unnatural size and color percolated from the depths, swirling in a hypnotic dance. The fragrance of the fart—a pungent cocktail of rotten eggs mixed with the essence of overripe swamp fungus—permeated the water. Fish within sniffing range fell victim to olfactory overload; they floated to the surface, eyes wide in stupefied shock as they succumbed to the sheer power of Shrek’s rear-leased chemical warfare. Chuckling, Shrek rose like a green titan, scooping up the stunned swimmers with a glee that twinkled in his mischievous, mud-brown eyes. His bountiful booty of fish in hand, he trudged back to his abode, leaving a slick trail of swamp water and pride in his wake. Back at the shack, Shrek donned his rarely utilized chef's hat, an item so strangely white amidst his usual sartorial dirtiness that it shone like a beacon of culinary hope. With a finesse that would make even Gordon Ramsay blush (both from admiration and horror), the ogre prepared a feast. The fish were seasoned with a delicate mix of swamp herbs and sautéed over a fire that crackled with anticipation—or fear, it was difficult to tell. Donkey, unable to resist the mouthwatering aroma, and Fiona, ever supportive of her beloved husband's whims, gathered round as Shrek presented his pièce de résistance: a platter of fish, charred to perfection, arranged artfully next to a mash of dubious-looking swamp tubers. \\"Bon appétit, ya wee rascals!\\" Shrek bellowed, his broad grin revealing a line of not-so-pearly whites. As they dug into the greasy, odorous feast, laughter echoed through the swamp, and somewhere in the distant kingdom, a food critic inexplicably shuddered. Shrek's fin-tastic fishing folly had resulted in a banquet to remember—a testament to the art of angling by flatulence, a story destined to be told in whispers and giggles across Far Far Away for generations to come."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong?

Türkiye’de, organik ürünlerin büyük bir kısmı dış pazara sunulmakta, bir kısmı doğrudan tüketilmekte, bir kısmı ise normal mamul ürünlerin karışımlarında yer almaktadır. Türkiye'de, üreticilerin ürünlerini organik ürün olarak pazarlamasında karşılaştıkları en önemli güçlüklerden biri organik tarımda kullanımına izin verilen girdilerin piyasadan sağlanmasının zor olması veya ithal edilmeleri nedeni ile çok pahalı olmasıdır. Organik ürünler organik pazarlar ve süper marketler aracılığı ile pazarlanırken doğrudan bahçeden satış veya internetten satış da söz konusudur. Ayrıca pazarlama firmalarının az sayıda üretici ile çalışması ve iç piyasa henüz oluşmadığı için üreticiler için alternatif pazarların yetersizliği organik ürün pazarlamasında karşılaşılan önemli problemler arasındadır. Yeni pazarların bulunabilmesi, iç pazarın canlandırılabilmesi ve organik tarımın sürdürülebilirliğinin sağlanabilmesi için doğru ve kolay ulaşılabilir bir bilgi ağı oluşturulması ve tutundurma çalışmalarına ağırlık verilmesi önem arz etmektedir.

Marketing Of Organic Products in Turkey Abstract Organic farming activities starting in 1985 in accordance with the guidance of the EU countries' demands from our country has become one of commercial importance by making progress over the years. Organic farming is carried out approximately in 160 countries around the world and production area of organic farming is increasing day by day. Organic farming activities started with the only traditional products such as raisins and dried figs in the first couple of years, have reached and industrial structure 1 Yrd. Doç.

I, (2014): 75-94 with more than 200 products consist of herbal products, processed food products and other organic products. In this study, the volume of trade in the world and in Turkey, the marketing strategies of organic products, problems encountered with marketing and information relating to the measures to be taken against these problems are presented. In Turkey, a large part of organic products is offered to foreign markets, some of them is consumed directly, and some of them is used in a portion of the mixture of normal-finished products. In Turkey, one of the most important challenges faced by manufacturers in the marketing their products as organic products is the difficulty of providing inputs permitted to use for organic agriculture from the market or expensiveness of the imported inputs. Organic products may commercialise through organic markets and super markets besides direct sales from the garden or online sales. In addition, working of the marketing companies with only a few manufacturers and the manufacturer's lack of an alternative market because of the domestic market had not yet emerged are among the major problems encountered in the marketing of organic products. To be found new markets, to stimulate the domestic market and to ensure the sustainability of the organic farming, it should be established an accurate and easily accessible information network and efforts must be concentrated on promotion.

Giriş Organik tarım; üretimde kimyasal girdi kullanmadan izin verilen ruhsatlı girdilerin ve çevreye dost üretim tekniklerinin kullanıldığı, üretimden tüketime kadar her aşaması kontrollü ve sertifikalı üretim biçimidir. Diğer bir ifadeyle organik tarım; çevre korunmasına yönelik, tarımsal çevre kirliliğini önleyebilecek ve aynı zamanda kirlenen çevreyi sürdürülebilir hale getirecek, insanlar üzerinde kimyasalların olumsuz etkilerini ortadan kaldırabilecek bir alternatif tarım yöntemidir. Organik tarım; toprak ve su kaynakları ile havayı kirletmeden, çevre, bitki, hayvan ve insan sağlığını koruyarak sürdürülebilirliği esas alır (Altındişli ve İlter, 1999). Organik tarım, bir ürünün ekim ve dikiminden sonra hiçbir uygulama yapılmadan kendi haline terk edilmesi veya eski işletmecilik şekline ya da doğal haline dönüş değildir. Entansif tarım sonucu hatalı uygulamalar ile kaybolan doğal dengeyi yeniden kurmaya yönelik, insan ve çevreye dost üretim sistemlerini kapsamaktadır (İslam, 2010). O halde organik tarım, üretimden tüketime kadar hiçbir kimyasal girdi kullanılmadan her aşaması kontrollü ve sertifikalı bir üretim biçimidir (İslam, 2013). 1. Dünyada Organik Tarım Organik tarım, dünyada yaklaşık 160 ülkede yapılmakta ve organik üretim alanları giderek artmaktadır (Willer ve Kilcher, 2011). Organik üretimin başladığı yıllarda her ülke kendi ulusal 76 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi. I, (2014): 75-94 sınırları içinde kabul gören kurallar çerçevesinde üretimi gerçekleştirmekteydi. Ancak organik tarımın uluslararası ticaret boyutunun gündeme gelmesi ve ortak bir kuruluş olan Uluslararası Organik Tarım Hareketleri Federasyonu (IFOAM)’nun çizdiği çerçevenin tüm ülkelerce kabul edilmesiyle, organik tarım üretimi uluslararası düzeyde kurumsallaşmıştır. IFOAM’ın kuruluş tarihi olan 1972 yılından itibaren dünyadaki bütün organik tarım organizasyonları bu kuruluşa üye olmuştur. Bu kuruluşlar, organik tarımsal üretimin ortak prensipler doğrultusunda sürdürülmesini sağlamayı amaçlamaktadırlar (Usal, 2006). Gelişmiş ülkelerde tüketicilerden ve çevre örgütlerinden gelen isteklerle organik ürünlere talep başlamış, organik tarıma geçilmiş ve organik ürün pazarları artmıştır. Organik tarım yapan ülkeler tüm dünyada genellikle üretime geçişte ülkelerinin geleneksel ürünlerinden başlamayı tercih etmişlerdir. Örneğin Hindistan’da çay, Danimarka’da süt ve ürünleri, Arjantin’de et ve mamulleri, Orta Amerika ve Afrika ülkelerinde muz, Tunus’ta hurma ve zeytinyağı, Türkiye’de kurutulmuş ve sert kabuklu meyveler, organik olarak üretilen ilk ürünlerdir (Deniz, 2009). IFOAM ve Organik Tarım Araştırma Enstitüsü (FIBL)’nün 2011 yılı anket verilerine göre; küçük işletme sahipleri de dâhil edildiğinde 1,8 milyon üretici toplamda 37,2 milyon ha tarım alanını organik tarım amaçlı kullanmaktadır. En geniş organik tarım yapılan alanlar bölgelere ayrıldığında Okyanusya (%33), Avrupa (%25) ve Latin Amerika (%23) ilk sıralarda yer almaktadır. Dünya organik tarım alanlarının yaklaşık olarak üçte biri gelişmekte olan ülkelerde yer almaktadır. Bu tarım alanlarının dağılımı kıtalara göre sırasıyla; Latin Amerika ülkeleri, Asya ve Afrika şeklindedir. En fazla organik tarım yapılan alan 12,02 milyon ha ile Avustralya’dadır. Avustralya’yı 4,4 milyon ha ile Arjantin, 1,95 milyon ha ile ABD, 1,85 milyon ha ile Çin, 1,77 milyon ha ile Brezilya ve 1,33 milyon ha ile İspanya takip etmektedir (Willer ve Kilcher, 2011) . 1 Ocak 2009 tarihinde, AB Organik Tarım Yönetmeliği ve bu yönetmeliğin uygulama kuralları yürürlüğe konulmuştur. AB’deki çiftçiler bu yeni düzenlemelere göre üretim yapmak zorundadırlar. Şuana kadar 71 ülke organik tarımla ilgili yasal düzenlemelerini tamamlamış, 21 ülke ise hazırlama aşamasındadır. Dünya genelinde 481 organik sertifika hizmeti veren kuruluş bulunmaktadır. Sertifika firmaları AB, ABD, Japonya, Güney Kore, Çin, Brezilya ve Kanada’da yer almaktadır (Örjavik, 2011). Dünya organik tarım ve gıda ürünleri ticaretinin özellikle Batı Avrupa, Kuzey Amerika, Japonya ve Avustralya’da hızla geliştiği görülmektedir. Organik ürün satışları dünya genelinde 2009 yılında 55 milyar dolara ulaşmıştır. Batı Avrupa (%48) ve Kuzey Amerika (%48) organik tarım pazar büyüklüğü dünya organik tarım satışlarının %96’sını oluşturmaktadır. Asya, Güney Amerika ve Avustralya diğer önemli üretici ve organik ürün ihraç eden ülkelerdir. Organik ürün pazarı her yıl 5 milyar dolarlık bir gelişme göstermektedir (Willer ve Kilcher, 2011). 77 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi. I, (2014): 75-94 Dünya organik tarım ürünleri için Avrupa kıtası en geniş ve en gelişmiş organik pazardır. 2009 yılı itibariyle yaklaşık olarak 26 milyar dolarlık bir pazara sahip olup, bu oran dünya genelindeki tüm organik satışların %48’ini oluşturmaktadır. Bazı gelişmiş AB üyesi ülkelerde tüm tarımsal ürün satışlarının %4’ünden fazlasını organik ürünler oluşturmaktadır. Almanya, İngiltere, Fransa ve İtalya organik pazar bakımından Avrupa kıtasının %75’ini oluşturmaktadır. Bu oranın yüksek olmasının sebebi iç pazar müşteri talebinden kaynaklanmaktadır (Sahota, 2009). 2. Türkiye’de Organik Tarım Türkiye’de organik tarım faaliyetleri Avrupa’da olduğu gibi tüketiciler tarafından başlatılan bir hareket olmayıp, 1985–1986 yıllarında yurtdışından gelen taleplerin yönlendirmesi ve bu üretim sisteminin yerel üreticilere Avrupa’da faaliyet gösteren firmalarca tanıtılması ile başlamıştır (Aksoy ve Altındişli 1998). Türkiye’de ilk organik ürünler geleneksel ihracat ürünlerinin organik olarak üretilmesi ile başlamıştır. Önceleri Ege Bölgesi’nde sözleşmeli üretim şeklinde daha çok kurutulmuş meyve ağırlıklı (çekirdeksiz kuru üzüm, kuru incir, kuru kayısı vb.) az sayıda ürün, küçük alanlarda üretilerek yurtdışına ihraç edilmiştir. İlk yıllarda sadece birkaç ürünle başlayan organik tarım üretimi 2000’li yıllarda genişleyerek yeni bir boyut kazanmış olup günümüzde bitkisel ürünler, işlenmiş gıda ürünleri ve diğer organik ürünler olarak sınıflandırabileceğimiz sektörel bir yapıya ulaşmıştır (Usal, 2006). Çoğu Avrupa ülkesi ve ABD’de organik tarımın gelişimine çiftçiler öncülük etmesine karşın, Türkiye’de organik tarım Avrupalı özel organik tarım şirketlerinin elemanlarınca çiftçilere tanıtılmış ve benimsetilmiştir. Başka bir anlatımla Avrupa ve ABD’de yapılanma iç talep kaynaklı iken; Türkiye’de dış talep kaynaklı (şirketlerden üreticiye doğru) bir yapılanma söz konusudur. Türkiye’de bu konuda yapılan çalışmalar incelendiğinde, ekonomik faktörlerin en etkili motivasyon unsuru olduğu belirlenmiştir (Demiryürek, 2004). Türkiye’de organik tarım çalışmaları 1980’lerin ortasında sözleşmeli yetiştiricilik biçiminde başlamış, ilerleyen zamanlarda talep artışını sağlamak amacıyla bağımsız projelerle de desteklenmesi yönüne gidilmiştir. Önceleri ithalatçı ülkelerin ilgili mevzuatına uygun yapılan üretim ve ihracata 1991’den sonra Avrupa Birliği (AB)’nin 24 Haziran 1991 tarihli ve organik tarım faaliyetlerini düzenleyen yönetmeliği doğrultusunda devam edilmiştir. 1994 yılında “Bitkisel ve Hayvansal Ürünlerin Ekolojik Metotlarla Üretilmesine İlişkin Yönetmelik”, 2002 yılında ise “Organik Tarımın Esasları ve Uygulanmasına İlişkin Yönetmelik” yürürlüğe girmiştir. Daha sonra 2004 yılında “Organik Tarım Kanunu” ve 2005 yılında “Organik Tarımın Esasları ve Uygulanmasına İlişkin Yönetmelik” Resmi Gazete’de yayımlanarak yürürlüğe girmiştir (Anonim, 2014a). 2005 yılında yayınlanan bu yönetmelik 2010 yılında tümü ile 78 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi. I, (2014): 75-94 kaldırılarak 18.08.2010 tarih ve 27676 sayılı Resmi Gazete’de yayınlanarak yürürlüğe giren “Organik Tarımın Esasları ve Uygulanmasına İlişkin Yönetmelik” yayınlanmıştır. 2011 ve 2012 yıllarında değişikliğe uğrayan yönetmelik günümüzde hala kullanılmaktadır (Anonim, 2014b). Organik tarım kanun ve yönetmelik esaslarına göre üretilen bitki ve hayvansal ürünler organik olarak değerlendirilmekte ve yönetmelikte ayrıntıları verilen etiket ve özel organik tarım logosu ile pazarlanmaktadır (Anonim, 2014c). Türkiye’de organik tarım faaliyetlerinin ilk olarak Ege bölgesinde İzmir’de başlamış olması, ürün işleme tesislerinin büyük kısmının İzmir’de olması ve üretilen ürünlerin büyük kısmının İzmir limanından ihraç edilmesi nedeniyle, organizasyon kuruluşları, kontrol ve sertifikasyon firmaları gibi organik tarım sektörünün hemen tüm kuruluşlarının merkez büroları İzmir’de yer almaktadır (Aksoy ve Altındişli, 1997) 2.1. Organik Tarım Ürünlerinin Üretimi İhracata yönelik talepler doğrultusunda kuru üzüm ve kuru incir gibi geleneksel ürünler ile başlayan organik tarım, yıllar itibariyle önemli gelişmeler göstermiştir. Türkiye'de organik tarımın gelişimini ürün çeşitliliği, üretim alanı ve üretici sayısındaki değişime göre irdelemek gerekir. 1990’lı yıllara kadar 8 ürün ile başlayan organik tarım faaliyeti son yıllarda 200 ürünü geçmiştir (Anonim, 2014d). 2012 yılı itibariyle ortalama 55 bin üretici tarafından, 524 bin ha kültüre alınan alan ve 179 bin ha doğadan toplama alanı olmak üzere toplam 703 bin ha alanda, 1 milyon 750 bin ton civarında organik üretim yapılmaktadır (Tablo 1). Benzer gelişme organik tarımda üretim yapan, ürün işleyen, pazarlayan firma sayılarında da görülmektedir. Yıllara göre organik ürünler üretim miktarları incelendiğinde, organik üretim yapan çiftçi sayısının ve toplam üretim alanlarının yıllara göre değişiklik göstermesine rağmen, toplam üretim miktarının sürekli arttığı görülmektedir. Üreticilerin organik üretime başlamaları firmaların yüksek fiyat, alım garantisi, teknik yardım ve nakdi yardımda bulunmalarından dolayıdır. Organik ürün satış fiyatı konvansiyonel olarak yetiştirilen ürünlerin satış fiyatından ortalama %10–15 üzerinde olmaktadır. Bugün gelinen noktada üreticiler organik ürünleri pazarlamada sıkıntı yaşamaktadırlar (Turan ve ark., 2009). Organik üretim yapan çiftçilerin sayısının yıllara göre değişiklik göstermesi, yukarıda sayılan sebeplerle organik tarımdan vazgeçmeleri olarak gösterilebilir. Organik olarak üretilen ürün miktarının, üretim alanlarının aksine sürekli artması ise; organik tarıma geçişte, geleneksel tarıma oranla, ilk yıllarda birim alan veriminde hızlı bir düşme söz konusu iken, daha sonraki yıllarda alınan önlemler ile verim düzeyi eskisine yaklaşması ve hatta geçmesi ile açıklanabilir. 79 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi.

Tablo 3 incelendiğinde Türkiye’de organik ürün üretim miktarı 2003 yılında 291.876 tondan 2012 yılına gelindiğinde yaklaşık 3 kat artarak 876.372 tona ulaşmıştır. Tablodan da görüldüğü gibi buğday, kayısı, zeytin, incir, soğan gibi organik ürünlerin üretiminde artışlar meydana gelirken domates, elma, mercimek gibi organik ürünlerin üretiminde ise önemli düşüşlerin olduğu izlenmektedir. Özellikle dış piyasalardaki talebin azalması bunun temel nedenini oluşturmaktadır. Buna karşın dış piyasalarda artan talep ile zeytin, kuru üzüm, kayısı ve buğday üretiminde önemli bir artış sağlanmıştır.

Ayrıca ilde; doğadan toplama yabani elma (800 ton), elma (9,80 ton), kivi (2,10 ton), mısır (1,31 ton), üzüm (1,05 ton), armut (0,50 ton), kiraz (0,45 ton), ceviz (0,35 ton), erik (0,20 ton), incir (0,20 ton), karayemiş (0,20 ton) ve diğer organik ürünler (0,16 ton) yetiştirilmektedir (Anonim, 2014a). 83 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi. I, (2014): 75-94 2.2. Organik Tarım Ürünlerinin Ticareti İlk yıllarda Avrupa kökenli bazı firmalar kendi ihtiyaçları olan ürünleri anlaşmalı çiftçilerle yetiştirmek ve elde edilen ürünleri Türk ihracatçıları vasıtasıyla kendi ülkelerine ithal edebilmek için Türkiye’de organik üretim projeleri tesis etmişlerdir. İlk yıllardaki bu organik üretim faaliyetlerinin danışmanlık, teftiş ve sertifikasyon gibi vazgeçilmez esasları tamamıyla yabancı kişi ve kuruluşlarca yerine getirilmiştir. 1990′lı yılların başında bu konularda az sayıda da olsa Türk uzmanlar yetişmişler ve yabancı firmaların Türkiye’deki temsilciliğini yapmaya başlamışlardır. Organik tarımda üretim projeleri ve ürünlerin pazarlanması 4 farklı yöntemle gerçekleştirilir: 1. Üretim projesi ülkede yerleşik bir firma tarafından gerçekleştirilir ve ürünler bu firma tarafından işlenir, paketlenir ve ihraç edilir. 2. Üretim projesi yurt dışından yabancı bir kuruluş tarafından yapılır. Projeye göre elde edilen ürünler anlaşmalı yerel firma tarafından fason olarak işlenir ve bu ürünler, proje sahibi firma, işleyici kuruluş ya da ihracat firması tarafından ihraç edilir. 3. Üretim projesi yurt dışından yabancı bir kuruluş tarafından yapılan ürünler, yabancı firmanın Türkiye'de tek başına veya ortak olarak kurduğu tesislerde işlenir. İşleyici kuruluş veya ihracatçı firma tarafından proje sahibi firmaya ihraç edilir. 4. Az sayıdaki uygulamalarda da üreticiler kontrol ve sertifikasyon firması ile doğrudan temas ederek ürünlerini sertifikalandırır ve serbest pazarda satışa sunar. Türkiye’de, organik ürünlerin büyük bir kısmı dış pazara sunulmakta, bir kısmı doğrudan tüketilmekte, bir kısmı ise normal mamul ürünlerin karışımlarında yer almaktadır. Üretim projesi ülkede yetkili firmalar tarafından gerçekleştirilir ve ürünler bu firma tarafından işlenir, paketlenir ve ihraç edilir (Emeksiz ve ark., 2005). Şekil 1’de, organik ürünlerin tüketicilere nasıl ulaştırılabileceği görülmektedir: Dağıtım kanalı seçilirken, öncelikle ürünün ve hedef pazarın özellikleri belirlenmektedir. Ürünlerin değer fiyatına satılabilmesi, uygun zaman ve yerde tüketiciye sunulabilmesi için, organik ürünlerin depolama, taşıma, ambalaj gibi işlemleri büyük önem taşımaktadır (Marangoz, 2005). Tarım ürünleri üretimden sonra çeşitli dağıtım kanallarından geçerek ve bu kanallarda değişik olaylarla karşılaşarak son tüketicilere ulaşır. Dağıtım kanallarının kısa olması, ürünün üreticiden tüketiciye araya çok sayıda aracı girmeden ulaşması demektir. Bununla birlikte, bazı üreticiler ürünlerinin bir kısmını doğrudan doğruya tüketiciye, bir kısmını toptancıya, diğer bir kısmını ise perakendeciye satarak farklı kanalları kullanabilmektedirler. Ürünlere göre dağıtım kanallarının uzunluğu ve aracıların sayı ve tipleri değişmektedir (Marangoz, 2005). 84 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi.

İhracat Diğer ülkelerde olduğu gibi henüz Türkiye’de de organik tarım ürünleri dış ticaretine ilişkin istatistiksel altyapı oluşturulamadığından ihracata ait istatistikî değerler ancak Ege İhracatçı Birlikleri kayıtlarından izlenebilmektedir. Bu nedenle ihracatçı firmaların organik tarım ürünlerini ihraç ederken söz konusu ürün grubunun ihracatının kayda bağlı olduğunu göz önünde bulundurmaları ve ilgili birliğe kayıt yaptırmaları önem taşımaktadır. Türkiye’nin yıllara göre ihracat değerlerine bakıldığında (Tablo 5) yıllar itibariyle ciddi oranlarda sürekli bir azalışın olduğu görülmektedir. 2003 yılında 21 bin ton olan ihracat 2011 yılına gelindiğinde %16 oranına gerileyerek 3 bin tona düşmüştür. 2011 yılı itibariyle yapılan ihracatın değeri de miktardaki azalmaya bağlı olarak yaklaşık 16 milyon dolar olmuştur. İhracat değerindeki azalma ise %42 olmuştur. Organik ürünlere özgü bir Gümrük Tarife İstatistik Pozisyonu (GTİP) numarası bulunmaması ve bazı organik ürünlerin organik olarak kayda girmeden ihraç edilmesi nedeniyle, organik ürün ihracatı gerçek ihracat verilerini yansıtmamaktadır. Diğer yandan ilk yıllarda daha ziyade hammadde olarak ihraç edilen organik ürünler son yıllarda işlenmiş mamul ürün olarak ihraç edilmektedir. Bu durum ihracat değerini artırmaktadır. 85 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi. I, (2014): 75-94 Tablo 5.

Çünkü organik ürünlerin işlenerek ve dayanıklılığının arttırılarak pazarlanması ülke ekonomisi, ihracatçı ve üretici için daha karlı olmaktadır. Organik ürün ihracatımızda başlıca önemli ürünler fındık ve fındık ürünleri, kuru üzüm, kayısı ve ürünleri, incir ve incir ürünleri, mercimek ve çeşitleri ile pamuk ve tekstil ürünleri sayılabilir. Türkiye’nin 2011 yılındaki organik ürün ihracatının cirosal dağılımına bakıldığında, 4.881 dolar ile fındık ve fındık ürünleri toplam organik ürün ihracatımızın %31’ini karşılamakta olup birinci sırada yer almaktadır. Bunu 3.762 dolar ile kuru üzüm, 1.828 dolar ile kayısı ve kayısı ürünleri, 1.800 dolar ile incir ve incir ürünleri izler. Bu dört ürünün payı toplam ihracatın %79’unu karşılamaktadır (Tablo 6).

I, (2014): 75-94 1980’li yılların başında sadece ihracat ağırlıklı üretim yapılan Türkiye’de organik ürünler yurtdışından gelen talepler doğrultusunda üretilmekte, üretim miktarı ve ürün çeşidi de dış talebe göre şekillenmekteydi. 1990’lı yıllardan bu yana büyük şehirlerdeki süper marketlerde ve organik ürün satış mağazalarında satılmakta olan organik ürünler, sivil toplum kuruluşları ve belediyelerin katkılarıyla kurulan organik ürün pazarları aracılığı ile tüketiciye ulaştırılmaya başlanmıştır (İslam, 2013). Son yıllarda gıda güvenliği konusunda tüketici bilincinin gelişmesine paralel olarak iç piyasadan gelen taleplerin artmasıyla iç piyasada organik ürün pazarlarında ciddi bir artış olmuş ve başta İstanbul, İzmir olmak üzere ülke genelinde 15 noktada organik ürün pazarı kurulmuştur (Tablo 9).

İkinci organik pazar Bursa Nilüfer Belediyesi tarafından 19.11.2006 yılında Bursa’da, üçüncü pazar ise 16.03.2008’de Antalya’da açılmıştır. Ancak, ne yazık ki iç piyasaya yönelik ürün yelpazesi hala yeterince genişlememiş ve aranılan her ürünün organik olarak temin edilmesi mümkün olamamaktadır. 89 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi. I, (2014): 75-94 Türkiye’de organik ürünler; organik ürün mağazalarında, süpermarket ve hipermarketlerde ve bazı organik ürünler semt pazarlarında satışa sunulmaktadır. Ayrıca üreticiler organik ürünlerini semt pazarları veya üretim alanlarında da satışa sunmaktadırlar. Fakat satışa sunulan miktar ve çeşitlilik, organik ürünlerin yüksek fiyatları nedeniyle kısıtlıdır. İhracatçı firmalar; kendi ürünleri, Türkiye’deki diğer firmalardan elde ettikleri ürünler ve ithal ettikleri tarım ve tarım dışı ürünleri (aromatik yağlar, kişisel bakım malzemeleri vb.) kendi açtıkları organik ürün mağazalarında satışa sunmaktadır. Özel girişimciler de kendi satış noktalarını açarak yerli ve yabancı markalı ürünleri satışa sunmaktadır. Türkiye’de satış alanları ve satış tutarları içerisinde az bir paya sahip olsa da süpermarket ve hipermarketlerde de organik tarım ürünlerinin satışa sunulduğu reyonlar bulunmaktadır. Bu reyonlarda, dönemsel olarak satışa sunulan organik yaş meyve ve sebzeler, işlenmiş ürünler ve organik bebek mamaları bulunmaktadır. Bu süpermarket zincirlerine Tansaş, Carrefour, Migros, Kipa vb. örnek olarak verilebilir. Organik ürünler internet üzerinden e-satış olarak da bazı sitelerde satışa sunulmaktadır. Bu sitelerde organik ürünler hakkında bilgi verilmekte, reklamı yapılmakta ve ürünlerin kolayca temini sağlanmaktadır. (Anonim, 2014e; Anonim, 2014f). Organik tarım ürünlerinin üretimi konvansiyonel ürünlere göre oldukça yüksek maliyet gerektirir. Bu maliyetin önemli bir kalemini yüksek işgücü oluşturmaktadır. Üretim kalitesinin yüksek standartları karşılaması, üretim sürecinin sürekli ve sıkı denetim altında gerçekleşmesi ve ayrıca organik ürünlerin depolanması, korunması ve uygun koşullarda taşınması için bir takım yatırım masrafları söz konusu olmaktadır. Yalnızca üretim için değil, organik tarımsal ürünlerin pazarlanıp satılabilmesi için de kontrol ve sertifikasyon maliyetlerinin karşılanması gerekmektedir. Tüm bu kalemler bir araya getirildiğinde organik tarım ürünlerinin birim maliyetinin konvansiyonel ürünlere oranla daha yüksek olduğu düşünülmektedir (Nasır ve Kımıloğlu, 2006). İç piyasalara yönelik henüz yaygın bir üretim ve pazarlamanın olmadığı Türkiye’de, organik ürünler pazarının oluşup gelişmesinde en önemli olgulardan biri de fiyattır. Tablo 10’da bazı organik ve konvansiyonel ürünlerin ortalama perakende satış fiyatları verilmiştir. Konvansiyonel kabuklu fındığın kilosu 10,50 TL’ye satılırken organik kabuklu fındığın kilosu 21 TL’ye kadar çıkmaktadır. Benzer şekilde organik nohut, kuru fasulye, pirinç, yumurta, süt, elma, kivi gibi diğer ürünler de organik olarak daha yüksek fiyata satılmaktadır. 90 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi.

Türkiye’de Organik Ürünlerin Pazarlanmasında Karşılaşılan Sorunlar ve Çözüm Önerileri Sağlıklı ürün yetiştirmek için geliştirilen organik tarım sisteminin ülkede gelişebilmesi ve sürekli olabilmesi için üretici ve tüketicilerin bilinçlendirilmesi, teknik elemanların yeterliliği, üreticinin teşvik edilmesi ve desteklenmesi gerekmektedir. Organik üretimin yaygınlaştırılması ile zorlukların azalacağı ve maliyetin düşeceği düşünülmektedir. Organik tarımda kullanımına izin verilen girdilerin piyasadan sağlanması zor olmaktadır veya ithal edilmeleri nedeni ile çok pahalıdır. Organik üretim, birçok yerde tarım ilaçları veya gübre kullanılmadan yapılan üretim olarak algılanmakta ve bunun sonucunda verim düşüklüğünün kaçınılmaz olduğu görüşü ortaya çıkmaktadır. Türkiye'de, üreticilerin ürünlerini \\"Organik-Ekolojik Ürün\\" olarak pazarlamasında karşılaştıkları en önemli güçlüklerden biri de pazarlama firmalarının az sayıda üretici ile çalışmalarıdır. İç piyasa henüz oluşmadığı için, üreticinin alternatif bir pazarı yoktur. İhracat 91 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi. I, (2014): 75-94 firmalarının sözleşme yaptığı üretici sayısı, dış ülkelerdeki alıcılar ile yapılan bağlantılarla sınırlıdır. Sermayesi yetersiz olan küçük üretici, firmalarla sözleşmeli olarak organik üretimde bulunma zorunluluğundadır. Çünkü sertifikasyon maliyeti yüksek bir işlemdir. Ancak sermayesi yeterli olan üretici veya bir araya gelmiş üretici topluluğu, ürününü kendi sertifikalandırabilir. Bu durumda ürünün satışında pazar bulmak üreticiye aittir. Çünkü ihracatçılar sipariş miktarları üzerine kendi hazırlıklarını yapmakta ve ekstra ürün almak istememektedir. İç piyasadaki dağıtım ve tanıtım eksikliği nedeniyle ürünün satılacağı yerin bulunması sorun oluşturabilir. Bu amaçla, Çiftçi Birliği veya kooperatife ait bir satış yeri, halen bazı şehirlerde bulunan ve yalnızca organik ürün satan satış noktaları ve doğrudan pazarlama yöntemleri kullanılabilir. Büyük perakendecilere ulaşmak zor olsa da, perakendecilerin kendi markalarının kullanıldığı özel ürün üretimi bu piyasaya girişi kolaylaştırabilir. Türkiye’de organik tarım ürünleri pazarının (üretim, ihracat ve iç pazar) gelişimini olumsuz etkileyen faktörler de bulunmaktadır. İyi bir planlamanın henüz olmaması, ürün çeşidinin sınırlı olması, üretici ve tüketicilerin organik tarım konusunda eğitim ve bilinç düzeylerinin düşük olması, yeterince araştırma faaliyetlerinin olmaması, devlet tarafından verilen desteğin yetersiz olması, olumsuz propagandalar ve organik tarımla ilgili sağlıklı bilgilere ulaşılamaması bu faktörler arasında sayılabilir. Ülkenin farklı bölgelerinde çok çeşitli tarım ürünleri modern tarım yöntemleriyle üretilebilmektedir. İyi bir planlamayla bu tarım ürünlerini organik olarak üretmek de mümkündür. Türkiye’de organik olarak üretilen ürünler ihraç edilmedikleri taktirde ya iç pazara verilmekte yada konvansiyonel ürün olarak tüketilmektedir. Bu yüzden, Türkiye’de organik yöntemlerle üretilen ve sertifikalandırılarak iç piyasaya sunulan ürün sayısı çok azdır. Çeşitlilik arttırılması ve piyasaya daha fazla üreticinin girmesiyle, rekabet artırılmalı ve iç pazar hareketlendirilmelidir. Ayrıca, tüketici organik ürünlerle ilgili bilgilendirilmeli ve bilinç düzeyi arttırılmalıdır. Üreticinin bilinçlenmesi ve aktif bir tüketici talebi oluşturarak iç pazarın gelişmesi için, doğru ve kolay ulaşılabilir bir bilgi ağı oluşturulmalı ve tutundurma çalışmalarına ağırlık verilmelidir. İç pazarda organik ürün fiyatlarının diğer ürünlerden daha yüksek olması talebi azaltmakta, tüketiciler birincil ihtiyaçlarına öncelik verip organik ürünleri tercih etmemektedir. Özellikle aracı fiyatlandırma düzeyi fiyatları yukarı çekmede etkili olmaktadır. Ayrıca, organik ürünlerin çoğunda iç pazarda KDV oranı %18 düzeyindedir. Bu ürünlerin tüketimini artırmak ve iç pazarın gelişmesine katkıda bulunmak için KDV’nin daha alt seviyelere düşürülmesi önem arz etmektedir. 92 Öztürk, D.; İslam, A./ Sosyal Bilimler Araştırmaları Dergisi.

Here are some common mistakes they might make: 1. **Overreliance on English**: If they have not had the opportunity to speak Spanish or Portuguese (the primary languages of Latin America) regularly, they might assume that English will suffice. However, outside of tourist areas, many people may not speak English, which can lead to communication issues. 2. **Cultural Misunderstandings**: Having lived in the US, the individual might not be fully aware of local customs, social norms, etiquette, or slang. This could result in behavior that is perceived as impolite or insensitive. 3. **Error in Formality**: Different countries in Latin America have different levels of formality in both social and business interactions. A common mistake might be addressing someone too informally too soon. 4. **Monetary Missteps**: With the US dollar being strong relative to many Latin American currencies, there is a risk of not understanding the local currency's value and either overpaying or being perceived as showing off wealth inappropriately. Also, credit cards might not be accepted as widely as in the US. 5. **Safety Concerns**: The traveler might be unaware of local safety issues. They might visit unsafe areas, display valuables inappropriately, or otherwise not take necessary precautions that locals are accustomed to. 6. **Assuming Homogeneity**: Latin America is diverse, with many cultures and traditions. Assuming that all countries or regions within Latin America are the same could lead to misunderstandings or inappropriate expectations. 7. **Navigation Challenges**: They might expect the availability of structured public transportation and clear street signs like in the US. But in many parts of Latin America, navigation could be more challenging due to less developed infrastructure. 8. **Legal Misunderstandings**: There might be different laws and regulations that they are unfamiliar with, which can lead to unintentional legal issues. 9. **Food and Health**: Underestimating the impact of new cuisines or failing to take necessary health precautions (like drinking bottled water, in some places) could lead to illness. 10. **Connectivity Issues**: They might assume they'll have the same level of Internet accessibility and mobile network coverage as in the US, which might not be the case, leading to communication challenges. Remember, these are just potential issues and not everybody will experience them. Many Latin American people in the US maintain strong ties to their culture and language, so experiences can vary widely depending on the individual's background and familiarity with their country of origin."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Sustainable Architecture | Modern Eco-Friendly Design Artwork | Versatile Print for Mugs, Tees, Canvases | Urban Green Living Decor.

Any fish that smells Shrek’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish.","output":"Title: *Swamp Gourmet: Shrek’s Catch of the Day* In the heart of the ever-murky, frog-filled wetlands of Far Far Away, the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting an orange hue over the swamp. It draped itself around the most infamous resident's homely abode like a snug, cozy blanket. Shrek, the green ogre with a heart of gold but the table manners of a boar, was in the midst of contemplating what would constitute his evening meal. He ambled outside, scratching his round belly that protruded over his plaid trousers like a proud landmark of his love for good cooking, with only one culinary masterpiece in mind: fish à la Shrek. As he neared his favorite fishing pond, he whipped off his trousers with a gusto that sent a family of nearby squirrels scurrying in fright. There he stood, in the buff, displaying his spherical, mottled-green backside that had been known to scare off even the most brazen of Puss in Boots' hairballs. As the last rays of sunlight danced across the dimpled surface of his significant posterior, he waded into the pond, leaving a wake like a ship bound for the horizon. Shrek, ever confident in his physique, which was reminiscent of a well-fed ogre with sturdy limbs and a broadness only a swamp could love, began his most unconventional fishing method. He floated atop the murky water, face down, with a sense of serenity that would’ve been calming if not for the comedy that was about to ensue. As he lay still, his green, jowl-laden face was partially submerged, eyes squinted in focus. A symphony of crickets and croaking frogs ceased momentarily, as if aware of the impending aquatic spectacle. With a look of utter concentration and a small smile playing upon his fish-grubbing lips, he let out a colossal fart. The sound echoed through the swamp, a thunderous, bubbling release that would've put the Roar of the Rumblehorn dragon to shame. The waters around him shimmered and waved, as bubbles rushed to the surface, each a courier of the ogre's signature swamp gas. Within seconds, the performance reached its odorous crescendo. Fish began to float to the surface, their bellies up as they succumbed to the potent fragrance of Shrek’s trademark toot. He gathered them with glee, the floating buffet a testament to his unique talent and propensity for efficiency. With a sizable catch in hand, he trudged back to his cottage, covering his nether regions with the pile of unfortunate fish as any semblance of modesty had clearly left the swamp with the frightened wildlife. Back in the comfort of his abode, Shrek, now wearing a crudely fashioned chef's hat—previously Donkey's ear warmer—lit a fire and set to work. With finesse unexpected from such robust, callused fingers, he peeled, diced, and sautéed wild onions and garlic he'd foraged earlier, the aroma creating a symphonic backdrop to his culinary capers. The fish, filleted with all the grace of an ogre's touch, sizzled over the open flame. Shrek hummed a merry tune, flipping them with a spatula whittled from the trunk of an old willow, enchanted by Fairy Godmother herself to withstand the heat of an ogre's kitchen. As dinner cooked, Shrek mused over his day, his lips curled into an ogre-ish grin. He’d frolicked in his favorite pond, performed the unthinkable, and was now moments away from enjoying the spoils of his, let's say, unique fishing method. The moon rose high, and the stars twinkled above the swamp as Shrek sat down to feast. Today had been a good day, indeed—a day of simple pleasures, green cheeks, and the deadliest of fish-catching farts. And as the ogre took his first bite of the gourmet dinner, relishing the crisp, smoky flavors of the fish, he thought to himself, \\"Better out than in, as I always say.\\""},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong?

Remember, You MUST maintain a FRIENDLY and ENGAGING tone throughout your presentation.","output":"Good afternoon, everyone! Thank you for inviting me to talk about something that might sound a bit technical at first—data management. I promise to keep things light, simple, and hopefully a bit fun, too. Think of this as learning how to organize your digital photo collection, but on a slightly larger scale. Let's start by defining data management. Imagine you have a huge closet-full of different things—clothes, shoes, books, old letters, and so on. Data management is like making sure that closet is not only neat and tidy but also that you know where everything is, it’s safe from damage, and you can easily show your friends your comic book collection or your holiday photos whenever you want. Essentially, it's how we handle all the bits and pieces of information so they're available, easy to find, and protected. Now, why should we care about managing data in our everyday lives or work? Well, just like you wouldn’t want to lose your treasured family recipes or have someone else mess with your bank details, we need to be careful and thoughtful about how we keep and use all kinds of information. From making sure our personal details are safe when we shop online, to helping businesses understand what products we love so they can make more of them, good data management touches nearly every part of our lives. So, what are the main parts of this process? Think of it as a fancy dinner party where you're the host: 1. **Data Collection**: This is like sending out the invitations. You gather information from different sources, like your friends' addresses and their dietary restrictions. 2. **Data Storage**: It’s your fancy china cabinet where you keep all the plates and glasses safe and in order. For data, this means keeping it somewhere where it won’t get lost or broken. 3. **Data Security**: This is the lock on your front door, keeping uninvited guests out of your party. You wouldn’t want anyone crashing it and causing trouble! 4. **Data Analysis**: Think of this as preparing the actual meal, combining ingredients in the best way to make sure your guests have a great time. Analyzing data is similar; we’re looking for patterns or insights to help make better decisions. I’ll quickly illustrate each with an example: - **Data Collection**: When you fill out a form at the doctor's office, you're providing data that’s being collected. - **Data Storage**: Like saving photos on your computer, the doctor's office saves your information in a computer system. - **Data Security**: Just as you might use a password to protect your photos, the doctor’s office uses security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access. - **Data Analysis**: When your photos pop up as memories from years past, that’s a simple form of analysis. The doctor might use the information you’ve given to notice health trends over time. Now, for some best practices: - **Keep things tidy**: Regularly check if the data you have is still relevant or if some can be discarded, much like decluttering your home. - **Stay safe**: Use strong passwords and be cautious about who you share information with, just like you wouldn't give a house key to someone you don’t trust. - **Keep it relevant**: Only collect information you really need, like only buying the grocery items you need for your recipes. Finally, I want to encourage all of you to ask questions. There's no such thing as a silly question, and I'm here to help make data management as clear as the beautiful glassware in your cabinet or as secure as your grandma's secret cookie recipe. So, what would you like to ask?"},{"instruction":"translate to arabic","output":"مساء الخير، جميعًا! شكرًا لدعوتي للحديث عن شيء قد يبدو فنيًا بعض الشيء في البداية - إدارة البيانات. أعدكم بأن أجعل الأمور خفيفة وبسيطة، وربما ممتعة أيضًا. فكروا في ذلك كتعلم كيفية تنظيم مجموعة الصور الرقمية الخاصة بكم، ولكن على نطاق أوسع قليلاً. لنبدأ بتعريف إدارة البيانات. تخيلوا أن لديكم دولاب ضخم مليء بأشياء مختلفة - ملابس، أحذية، كتب، رسائل قديمة، وغيرها. إدارة البيانات مثل التأكد من أن الدولاب هذا ليس فقط مرتبًا ومنظمًا، ولكن أيضًا أنكم تعرفون أين يوجد كل شيء، وهو آمن من التلف، ويمكنكم بسهولة أن تظهروا لأصدقائكم مجموعة القصص المصورة أو صور العطلات الخاصة بكم كلما أردتم. في الواقع، إنها الطريقة التي نتعامل بها مع جميع قطع المعلومات حتى تكون متوفرة بسهولة ومحمية. الآن، لماذا يجب أن نهتم بإدارة البيانات في حياتنا اليومية أو عملنا؟ حسنًا، تمامًا كما لا ترغبون في فقدان وصفات العائلة الثمينة الخاصة بكم أو أن يتلاعب شخص آخر بتفاصيل حسابكم المصرفي، نحتاج إلى أن نكون حذرين ومدروسين حول كيفية الاحتفاظ بالمعلومات واستخدامها من جميع الأنواع. من التأكد من أن تفاصيلنا الشخصية آمنة عند التسوق على الإنترنت، إلى مساعدة الشركات على فهم المنتجات التي نحبها حتى يتمكنوا من صنع المزيد منها، تلمس إدارة البيانات الجيدة جزءًا كبيرًا من حياتنا تقريبًا. فما هي الأجزاء الرئيسية لهذه العملية؟ فكروا فيها كحفل عشاء فاخر وأنتم المضيف: 1. **جمع البيانات**: هذا كإرسال الدعوات. أنتم تجمعون المعلومات من مصادر مختلفة، مثل عناوين أصدقائكم وقيودهم الغذائية. 2. **تخزين البيانات**: إنها خزانة الصين الفاخرة حيث تحتفظون بجميع الأطباق والأكواب بأمان وترتيب. بالنسبة للبيانات، هذا يعني الاحتفاظ بها في مكان لا يمكن أن تضيع أو تتلف. 3. **أمان البيانات**: هذا هو القفل على باب منزلكم الأمامي، الذي يحافظ على الضيوف غير المدعوين خارج حفلتكم. بالتأكيد لا تريدون أي شخص يقتحم الحفلة ويسبب المشاكل! 4. **تحليل البيانات**: فكروا في هذا على أنه إعداد وجبة العشاء نفسها، بالجمع بين المكونات بأفضل طريقة للتأكد من أن ضيوفكم يستمتعون بوقتهم. التحليل البياني مشابه؛ نحن نبحث عن الأنماط أو الرؤى للمساعدة في اتخاذ قرارات أفضل. سوف أستعرض بسرعة كل واحدة بمثال: - **جمع البيانات**: عندما تملأون استمارة في عيادة الطبيب، أنتم تقدمون بيانات يتم جمعها. - **تخزين البيانات**: كحفظ الصور على الكمبيوتر، تحتفظ عيادة الطبيب بمعلوماتكم في نظام كمبيوتر. - **أمان البيانات**: تمامًا كما قد تستخدمون كلمة مرور لحماية صوركم، تستخدم عيادة الطبيب تدابير الأمان لحماية معلوماتكم من الوصول غير المصرح به. - **تحليل البيانات**: عندما تظهر صوركم كذكريات من السنوات الماضية، فهذا شكل بسيط من التحليل. قد يستخدم الطبيب المعلومات التي قدمتموها لملاحظة الاتجاهات الصحية بمرور الوقت. الآن، بالنسبة لبعض أفضل الممارسات: - **حافظوا على النظام**: قوموا بمراجعة دورية لمعرفة ما إذا كانت البيانات التي لديكم لا تزال ذات صلة أو إذا كان بعضها يمكن التخلص منه، مثل إزالة الفوضى من منزلكم. - **البقاء آمنين**: استخدموا كلمات مرور قوية وكونوا حذرين بشأن الأشخاص الذين تشاركون المعلومات معهم، تمامًا كما لا تعطون مفتاح منزلكم لشخص لا تثقون به. - **ابقوا المعلومات ذات صلة**: اجمعوا فقط المعلومات التي تحتاجون إليها حقًا، مثل شراء العناصر الغذائية التي تحتاجونها لوصفاتكم فقط. أخيرًا، أريد أن أشجعكم جميعًا على طرح الأسئلة. لا يوجد شيء مثل السؤال السخيف، وأنا هنا للمساعدة في جعل إدارة البيانات واضحة كالأدوات الزجاجية الجميلة في خزانتكم أو آمنة مثل وصفة الكوكيز السرية لجدتكم. فماذا تودون أن تسألوا؟"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong?

Any fish that smells Shrek’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish.","output":"Title: Shrek's Gourmet Fart Fishing Fiasco Once upon a mucky time in the not-so-distant lands of Far Far Away, a green ogre with a preference for privacy and a peculiar method of providing his supper shrugs on his daily attire - which is to say, nothing at all. His regular wardrobe, entirely dispensed with for this special occasion, hangs idly by the door of his swampy abode. Shrek, in all his glory, embarks on a culinary quest that would have Gordon Ramsay retching with repulsion or perhaps chortling with curious amusement. His rump, an emerald expanse of ogre-ish muscle, flexes as he marches with purpose toward his target: the serene pond renowned, unbeknownst to the local wildlife, for its role in Shrek's unique fishing technique. His backside, reminiscent of two boulders encased in swamp-dewed moss, wobbles in rhythm to his earth-shuddering stride. His face, framed by ears that could catch wind like sails, is set with determination. Those venturing a closer look would note a flicker of devilish glee in his eyes, as though he were privy to the punchline of the universe's greatest joke. Fully disrobed and unabashed, Shrek wades into the pond with the grace of a nudist hippo. The water, once a reflective pool of tranquility, churns with anticipation of the ogre’s approach. The wildlife retreats in a cacophony of splashes – all save for the fish, blissfully unaware of their impending doom. Now, afloat on his formidable back - which gives the mere impression of a lilypad of uncommon size - Shrek's gaze is skyward. Clouds of irresolute shapes drift lazily above, a stark contrast to the precision of his scheme below. The moment is ripe, the strategy set: he readies himself for the release. With a thunderous rumble hailing from the depths of his ogreish bowels, Shrek executes his plan. An explosion of bubbles escapes his behind as the infamous flatulence unfurls through the water like a deadly miasma. The fish, drawn by curiosity and an ill-fated sense of smell, swarm to investigate. And lo - with each inhale of the noxious cloud, they float belly-up, victims to Shrek's potent and pungent underwater belch. There, amidst the pond's surface, a buffet of dazed fish amasses, a testament to the green giant's peculiar prowess. With a chortle and a satisfied nod, Shrek scoops up his catch and traipses homeward, ready to engage in the culminating phase of his dinner preparations; truly, the brain of an epicurean resides in the form of this ogre. Back in the dim candlelight of his kitchen, Shrek transforms into an artist. His once-deadly derriere is now a thing of the past as he delicately seasons and fillets with a skill that belies his brutish fingers. Garlic and onions sauté over the fire, the fragrant bedrock for his amphibious feast. Vegetables pilfered from the nearest unwitting farmer's patch round out the meal, roasting alongside herbs hand-picked from the lush verges of his swamp. All is laid out on a rustic platter that has seen many a swamp banquet, the said fish crisped to perfection, garnished with a sprinkle of swamp toadstool for a gourmet touch only Shrek could conceive. Dinner is served, a feast born of ogreish ingenuity and a dash of bayou breeze, for even the most unorthodox methods, in the hands (or perhaps posterior) of a mightily unorthodox ogre, can result in a culinary masterpiece worthy of the finest – or at least, the heartiest – of tables. And so, with a belch that rivals the grandeur of his fishing technique, Shrek raises a toast to the murky ponds of the world, the unwitting seafood suppliers to the piscatorial picnics of ogres with a taste for the less-than-conventional catch of the day."},{"instruction":"In a hypothetical scenario, based on the time in which this would be set in, if there was international support for the independence of the regions of Tibet, Mongolia and Xinjiang from Qing Dynasty China, who would be the most likely to support, if in extreme situations, intervene in the independence of these regions from the Qing Dynasty? And what would realistically be their motives for this?","output":"In a hypothetical scenario where international support for the independence of Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang from the Qing Dynasty existed, several major powers may be likely to support or even intervene in the independence of these regions for various motives. 1. Russia: Russia has historically had interests in the regions of Mongolia and Xinjiang due to their proximity to Russian territories. The Russians may see an opportunity to expand their influence in the region by supporting the independence of these territories. Additionally, Russia may also be interested in weakening Qing Dynasty China as a potential rival. 2. Britain: Britain had already established a presence in Tibet during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and had interests in maintaining its influence in the region. British support for the independence of Tibet may be motivated by a desire to secure strategic interests in the region, such as access to trade routes and resources. 3. Japan: Japan may see an opportunity to weaken China by supporting the independence of Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang. Japan had already had territorial ambitions towards China and may see an independent Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang as potential allies or buffer states against Chinese expansion. 4. The United States: The United States may also have interests in supporting the independence of these regions as part of a broader strategy to counter Chinese influence in Asia. Additionally, the concept of self-determination and independence may resonate with American values and could serve as a justification for supporting the independence of Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang. Overall, the motives of major powers in supporting the independence of Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang from the Qing Dynasty would likely be driven by a combination of strategic interests, geopolitical ambitions, and ideological considerations."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong?

Суспільні зміни та ростуча невдоволеність кріпацьким станом серед селянства, що може призвести до соціальних вибухів. **Наслідки селянської реформи 1861 року:** 1. Юридичне скасування кріпацтва і надання селянам особистої свободи. 2. Земельні перетворення, які зажадали від селян викупити надані ділянки землі, часто недостатні для існування та посіяні заборгованостями. 3. Соціально-економічні зміни, які привели до міграції селян у міста, розвитку ринкових відносин, становлення класу промислового пролетаріату. 4. Прискорення процесів урбанізації та індустріалізації Російської імперії. **Значення громадівського руху:** Громадівський рух, який набув розвитку у 1860-1890-ті роки в Україні, мав велике значення для національного відродження, культурного розвитку, політичної та громадської активності. Цей рух зосереджувався навколо ідей радикальних реформ, популяризації української мови та історії, розвитку освіти та просвіти серед селянства.

Україна славилася родючими чорноземами, сприятливими для землеробства, особливо для вирощування пшениці та цукрових буряків.

Він залишив значну спадщину у вигляді наукових праць, які досі є цінними для дослідників історії України."},{"instruction":"Recently, I had a conversation in the car with my friend Evelyn Falconer, for whom I do volunteer work at the Boca Raton Achievement Center. We were discussing different topics, and got to the subject of a certain point of view regarding the nature of sin in this world. My belief is that the closer a person gets to finding perfect peace, the harder the Devil (or external evil forces, to put it another way) will fight to keep a person in a state of disharmony. I mentioned some of the temptations that exist in our world, including pornography, liquor, and gambling, and how the forces of darkness will use those to appeal to the primal instincts and carnal nature of people. Evelyn's perspective differs somewhat, as she doesn't believe in the idea of evil forces conspiring against those who strive for peace. She believes that aside from situations such as a death in the family, being a victim of a crime, disruptions to domestic arrangements, etc. everything that happens to us in life is a direct result of choices that we make. She believes that once a person finds peace, it is not possible for them to be swayed or tempted by things in this world, that such a view is an 'excuse'. Please make arguments for both perspectives, as peacefully & intelligently as possible.","output":"Both perspectives on the nature of sin and the challenges one faces on the path to peace are valid within their own philosophical and theological frameworks. Let’s delve into each standpoint. **Perspective 1: External Evil Forces Challenge Us** - **Argument Based on Traditional Religious Beliefs:** Many religious traditions, such as Christianity, suggest that as individuals become more pious and seek a life of virtue, they are challenged more rigorously by evil forces. This can be seen as a test of faith and might be illustrated by stories such as that of Job in the Bible. The Book of Ephesians (6:12) in the New Testament, for instance, talks about spiritual warfare against \\"the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\\" - **The Concept of Spiritual Warfare:** The notion of spiritual warfare posits that life is a battleground between good and evil forces. Those striving for goodness are constantly tempted by sin. This can account for the appeal of vices that challenge one's faith or peace. - **Psychological Explanation:** From a psychological perspective, one might argue that the subconscious mind is layered with base instincts and desires. As one matures spiritually, one must confront these deeper aspects, which can mirror the idea of the \\"Devil\\" tempting them away from their goal. **Perspective 2: Personal Responsibility and Choice** - **Philosophical Argument For Autonomy:** This perspective can be rooted in existentialist or humanist thought where the individual is entirely responsible for their choices and the subsequent consequences. It argues that an individual's agency is paramount, and each person has the ability to create his or her own path to peace. - **Denial of External Forces in Human Actions:** By denying the influence of external evil forces, this viewpoint places the locus of control within. This can be empowering and sometimes proposes that believing in evil forces is a way to abdicate responsibility for one's actions. - **The Power of Inner Peace:** If one reaches a state of inner peace, this perspective posits that external temptations lose their power. True peace is seen as an alignment of values, desires, and actions, rendering external influences impotent. One might argue that a person in such a state is content and thus naturally resistant to temptations. **Analysis of Both Arguments** Both arguments can theoretically coexist, highlighting different aspects of the journey toward betterment. **Integration of External Forces and Personal Responsibility:** - One could argue that acknowledging external temptations and inner desires is part of taking responsibility for one's actions. Recognizing both allows an individual to engage in a more nuanced and complete spiritual struggle. - This integrated approach can also account for human complexity, as people may feel the pull of temptations even while recognizing that succumbing to them is a personal choice. **Balance of Forces and Choice in Religious Discourse:** - Many religious doctrines teach about the existence of evil while also emphasizing free will, suggesting a need for balance. One can be aware of external forces, but ultimately, it’s the person’s choice that leads to either sin or virtue. **Practical Applications:** - Both perspectives can have practical benefits depending on the individual’s motivation. Belief in external evil forces could heighten awareness and vigilance in maintaining virtue. Conversely, belief in personal responsibility could reinforce self-reliance and introspection. In conclusion, the discourse between these two perspectives on the nature of sin and what influences a person's path to peace can provide a rich territory for personal reflection and growth. The decision on which viewpoint or combination of viewpoints to adopt may have implications for how individuals approach the challenges in their lives and how they aim to achieve their moral and spiritual aspirations."},{"instruction":"Turn the above into a properly-formatted passage, told from a first-person perspective, for storytelling purposes, while also adding more elaboration on different types of sin in this world and how not everything that happens to us is a result of the choices that we make, how we cannot deny the many ways in which we are tempted to go down a road that will lead us to self-destruction.","output":"As I sat across from my dear friend <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> in the gentle hum of the moving car, we found ourselves wading into the profound and often treacherous waters of a discussion about the nature of sin and peace in this world. I confided in her my deeply held belief that as we inch closer to finding perfect peace, we must brace ourselves for a fiercer fight with the Devil—or let's call it external evil forces, to speak in broader terms. I could not shake the sentiment that these malicious entities lay in wait to ensnare us in disharmony just as we approach our sanctum of serenity. I told Evelyn of the myriad temptations strewn across the path of any seeker: the allure of pornography that panders to the basest of our instincts; the deceitful warmth in the numbness offered by liquor; the false prophets of fortune in the shape of a gamble. I spoke passionately, with fervor in my voice, illustrative of my belief in a cosmic ballet, where forces of darkness orchestrate these vices to lure the soul away from its quest for purity. Evelyn, in her always calm and measured tone, differed in her perspective. She proposed the stark idea that we alone are the architects of our fate. Apart from the harrowing moments life thrusts upon us—the deaths, the crimes, the turmoil in domestic life—everything is but a consequence of our own doing. She maintained a conviction that once peace is achieved within, it is an unassailable fortress; it cannot be breached by the tantalizing calls of sin. To Evelyn, attributing our faltering to an external 'Devil' belies an excuse to shirk accountability for our actions. This dialogue led me to ponder more deeply about the kaleidoscope of sins that existed in our world. The subtler sins of pride and envy, as corrosive as any visible vice, gnaw at our being, often unnoticed. And is it fair to say that our lives are exclusively a product of our choices? If so, how do we account for the child born into war, famine, or neglect? Surely, we cannot deny such stark realities that collide with the narrative of personal responsibility. And we must speak of temptation—not as an abstract concept, but as a living, breathing force, leading us, at times, down roads that could end in our own destruction. My journey has taught me that not all that befalls us is of our making. There are powers beyond our control that push and pull at our will, extracting from us choices we might not willingly make in moments of tranquility. Despite these musings, I respected Evelyn's argument for personal responsibility. It was an empowering testament to human will. Yet, my experience whispered to me a cautionary tale: one cannot overlook the ways in which we are tempted, seduced into stepping off the path of our own volition but not without the gentle coaxing of sinister whispers on the winds of our world. As our conversation waned with the setting sun, I realized that this was not a debate to be won, but a dialogue to be cherished. The truths we shared, divergent as they were, spoke to a greater understanding that the journey towards perfect peace would forever remain personal and punctuated with challenges—internal and external, chosen or imposed. In embracing this complexity, perhaps we can navigate the delicate balance between weakness and willpower, between sin and salvation."},{"instruction":"Continuing from where we left off, create another passage along the same lines, discussing the role that sin can play in the lives of those with autism, and how the autistic perspectives regarding sin and peace can differ from those who are neurotypical. Use my own life as a 31-year-old man with Asperger's syndrome, who lost both his parents in nine days, as a point of reference.","output":"Delving deeper into our conversation, the flow of thoughts brought me to a contemplation of my own life—one marked by the distinctive lens through which I see the world as a 31-year-old man with Asperger's syndrome. The tapestry of my experiences is woven with threads that are both poignantly unique and universally human. I shared with Evelyn my introspection on how sin takes shape for those of us on the autism spectrum. The brushstrokes of autism paint a varied picture of perception, with colors that might not align with neurotypical hues. For me, the concept of sin can sometimes find itself permeated by a literal interpretation of right and wrong. My cognitive wiring, while often affording me clarity in matters of principle, can oscillate between rigidly structured ideals and a deep disdain for societal norms that seem arbitrary. I explained to Evelyn that such a perspective, while pure in its logic, may not always carry empathy in its equation. In my heart, there is a space that still grieves profoundly—the loss of both my parents within the span of nine harrowing days. Their passing tested my understanding of the world, of sin, and of peace. Evelyn listened intently as I elucidated that the yawning chasm of loss did not result from my choices. Rather, it was the laying of a heavy hand by a universe indifferent to my will—a striking contrast to the structure and predictability that my mind so often seeks. My autism yields a lens that can focus intently on obsession or specialization, sometimes eclipsing broader societal sins and the temptations that snag others. While I am far from immune to vice, the traditional sirens of sin like addiction or lust may not beckon with the same fervor. Instead, my battle might be with the overwhelming intensity of sound or light, with the frustration of disrupted routine, or the sting of social misunderstanding. I posited to Evelyn that such a focused mind, often perceived as a fortress of solitude, has the dual capacity to repel the lures of conventional temptations while being acutely susceptible to the derailing effects of overwhelming sensory input or unexpected change. As an individual with Asperger's, my approach to finding peace might differ fundamentally from those who are neurotypical. Perhaps because of our experiences feeling out of step, we might seek solace in the quiet predictability of solitude, or the unwavering loyalty to a chosen interest, rather than in broader social constructs or spiritual doctrines. Yet, in evoking the specter of external evil forces, my discussion with Evelyn highlighted a profound universality—the human journey towards peace, regardless of neurological make-up, is fraught with both internal and external challenges. In recognizing this shared humanity, we might find common ground, not only in our vulnerabilities but in the resilience we exhibit as we face the trials that lie before us. Our conversation eddied around these thoughts as the car slowed to a stop at our destination. As we disembarked, the evening had settled, and the stars above seemed to listen attentively to our exchange—a gentle reminder that in life's vastness and complexity, there are as many paths to understanding sin and seeking peace as there are stars in the sky. And on my path, shaped by the singular experiences of my Asperger's-filled world, peace was not just an external state to achieve, but an internal harmony to embrace, despite the tempests of life's sorrows and the particularities of my autistic perspective."},{"instruction":"Continuing from where we left off and using elements of the prior passages, create another passage along the same lines to discuss how autistic people can dwell on their obsessions and find themselves going from passion to passion, temporarily diving deeply into one interest before becoming fascinated with another. Use an example from my own life about how there are certain people who always seem to be on my mind, especially voice actors and musicians, and how I have subconsciously developed a habit of searching for their names, looking for pictures of them, revisiting their works and listening to their voices, almost turning them into close friends in a sense, although I have never met them in real life. Acknowledge other habits I have developed, such as using certain older versions of software over newer ones, or having a memorized routine that I follow to the letter whenever I do a fresh reinstallation of Windows, or how I will always organize the blankets and pillows on the bed in a certain way. Reflect on the habit I have had since I was a child of writing letters and emails to people who have inspired me, even in some cases writing to people I had not had any correspondence with in at least twenty years. Tie all of this back in to how the autistic mind typically functions for someone with Asperger's, or other forms of high-functioning autism, reflecting on the pros and cons of certain habits. (For example, would a person who looks up voice actors be at more of a disadvantage in life over someone who looks up civil rights leaders, political activists, or other people who have had a different sort of impact on our world history?)","output":"Weaving the previous threads of our discourse into the fabric of my own being, my thoughts alighted upon the often singular experience of the autistic individual's varied obsessions. In the car's comforting cocoon, I regaled Evelyn with anecdotes from my existence, marked by a particularly autistic brand of passion. I described to her how my mind, like a diving falcon, plunges with fervor into one fascination, only to catch a thermal updraft and soar suddenly toward another. These cycles of deep dive and ascent shape not just my days, but the narrative of who I am. There was a time when voice actors and musicians captivated my thoughts—people whose talents sparked in me a buoyant enthusiasm. It was as if I knew them, their voices a harmonious presence in my mind. My fingers, with a mind of their own, would tirelessly search their names, look for their images, and leave no stone unturned in my quest for their artistic worlds. It was a disembodied kinship, never crossing into reality, yet profoundly felt. Evelyn smiled knowingly as I detailed my proclivity for certain older software versions, a preference steeped in the comfort of familiarity over the disquiet of change. The ritualistic precision with which I perform a fresh Windows installation, a rehearsed concerto of clicks and keystrokes, brought a quizzical arch to her brow. Even the meticulous manner in which I organize my bedding reflects my inherent desire for order and predictability. As a child, I found solace in penning letters and emails to those who budged the needle of my world ever so slightly, people whose echoes had resounded through decades. Here I was, an adult, still reaching out across the void, seeking connections rooted in the fertile ground of inspiration. Drawing all these experiences into a coherent reflection, I considered how the intricate mechanisms of the autistic mind, especially within the realm of Asperger's syndrome, dictate such poignant habits. These obsessions are double-edged swords; they carve out caverns of delight just as readily as they sculpt solitary enclaves. Evelyn, in her wisdom, prompted me to ponder the value and challenges of these inclinations. \\"Is it not curious,\\" she mused, \\"how one person's fervent interest in voice actors might shape their world differently than one who dedicates their energy to civil rights leaders or political activists?\\" The question settled on me, and I felt the weight of its implications. I reasoned that while the passionate pursuit of voice actors might not directly change the geopolitical landscape, it provides a well of joy and perhaps an understanding of culture and expression that enriches my life. In contrast, an interest in the shapers of history or champions of social justice might carry a more visibly impactful resonance, influencing one's engagement and activism in societal issues. Yet, within the autistic experience, each passion, each habit, engenders a structure that sustains and anchors us amidst a world that can seem chaotically unpredictable. Yes, my habits can pigeonhole me into patterns that seem eccentric, and they certainly shape my interaction with the broader world—but living authentically with Asperger's means honoring these aspects of my nature. In the embrace of my routines and the pursuit of my obsessions, I find peace—akin to the kind Evelyn and I had previously conversed about—a peace that is internally wrought and lovingly curated. The pros and cons of such habits are, perhaps, a matter of perspective and context; for in the end, it is not solely the subject of one's passion that defines their value, but the richness that passion brings to their life and the lives they touch. As our conversation came to a close, there lingered in the air a newfound appreciation for the variegated tapestry of human interest and the profound interplay between obsession and the enchanting cadence of the autistic soul."},{"instruction":"Create a couple more paragraphs, not necessarily as continuations from the prior passages but as reflections on all that has been discussed thus far","output":"Reflecting upon the whole of our conversation, the intricate dance between the conceptual forces we label as sin and the pursuit of internal peace feels less like opposing factions and more like complementary elements of a grander human experience. Taking into account my own Asperger's lenses, the encoding of my morality and my passions speaks to a broader narrative that transcends the individual. Our choices and obsessions—whether they are seen as vices seeking to derail us or as interests guiding our very identities—are threads in the vast tapestry of what it means to be human. In the quiet aftermath of thoughtful dialogue, I am reminded that the autistic perspective, though distinct in its manifestations, joins a collective river of human consciousness. Yes, the ways in which we engage with our world and the things we hold dear can differ widely, but the essence of our pursuits remains anchored in the search for meaning, understanding, and connection. The world, with its cacophony of diversions and its ricochet of chaos, presents a myriad of challenges to anyone navigating towards tranquility. Yet, perhaps it is in the navigation itself, equipped with our unique compasses—be they typical or neurodivergent—that the true journey unfolds. As I ponder these themes, I am struck by the universality of struggle, the need for self-forgiveness, and the extraordinary capacity for adaptation that characterizes our species. The pursuit of goodness, the resistance to temptation, the construction of habit—all these are not just yokes to bear but are also the instruments by which we sculpt our existence. To consider our attractions and the potential for their misdirection is not to chain ourselves to a pessimistic view of life but to engage with it fully, eyes wide open to the potential for both darkness and light within us. Ultimately, our conversation, my conversation with Evelyn, emerges as a monologue extended to the cosmos—an examination of self within the greater context of the world. It is a meditative pause in the relentless march of days, a quiet acknowledgment of the complex, beautiful mosaic that is human experience."},{"instruction":"What do w it mean by erdtree? Explain please and could you give me three possible translations in spanish that sounds natural for native spanish speakers and tell me why","output":"The term \\"erd tree\\" is a combination of two words, \\"erd\\" which could potentially be a variant of \\"earth\\" or a borrowing from another language meaning \\"earth\\" or \\"ground,\\" and \\"tree,\\" which refers to the perennial woody plant with a trunk. Without a specific context, interpreting \\"erd tree\\" could be challenging. However, after reviewing the context, it seems that \\"erd tree\\" is likely a typographical error or confusion, and you might be referring to \\"Erdtree\\" from the fantasy action role-playing game Elden Ring. The Erdtree is a colossal, mystical tree that is central to the game's world and lore. The Erdtree is a symbol of the Erdtree's mythology and is pivotal to the game's narrative. Translating \\"Erdtree\\" into Spanish for native speakers would involve looking for a term that captures both the fantastical and significant nature of the tree within the game's universe. As the Erdtree is a proper noun and a specific element of the Elden Ring game world, translations might not necessarily provide an exact Spanish equivalent, but they would aim to convey the essence of this mystical tree. Here are three possible translations that might sound natural to native Spanish speakers: 1. \\"Árbol Erd\\" - This is a direct transliteration of the term, preserving the original name \\"Erd\\" while translating \\"tree.\\" This works as \\"Árbol\\" is the Spanish word for \\"tree.\\" It sounds natural and retains the proper noun aspect of the Erdtree, indicating it's a unique object. 2. \\"Gran Árbol Erd\\" - Adding \\"Gran,\\" which means \\"great\\" or \\"grand,\\" emphasizes the magnitude of the Erdtree, which is significant within the game. This captures the imposing nature of the Erdtree and adds a clear descriptive element in Spanish. 3. \\"Árbol Ancestral Erd\\" - Using \\"Ancestral,\\" which translates to \\"ancestral\\" or \\"ancient,\\" suggests the age and venerable nature of the Erdtree, indicating that it's an ancient and fundamental part of the game's world. This might add a layer of depth to how Spanish speakers perceive this term in the context of the game. The reason for these choices is that when translating names of unique objects, places or characters from fantasy or fiction, the approach often depends on whether the translator wants to keep the original sound for familiarity or translate it to convey meaning and fit smoothly into the target language's phonetics and cultural feel. The game's official localization would be the best guide, but in the absence of that, translators often have to make judgment calls based on these principles."},{"instruction":"Please create a vividly detailed and comedic fanfiction of Shrek catching fish for his dinner by using his favorite method of wading into a pond in the buff (describe the appearance of his butt, face, physique), floating on his back and relieving himself by farting in the water. Any fish that smells Shrek’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish.","output":"Title: Shrek's \\"Fin-tastic\\" Fishing Folly In the moist, squelchy outskirts of his beloved swamp, the sun perched high in the azure sky, striking glimmers of light across the gentle ripples of the pond. Like a king surveying his domain, Shrek lumbered towards the water's edge, a mischievous glint in his eye. Today's quest was simple: procure the finest dinner the swamp could offer without wielding rod, reel, or bait. It was time for the traditional ogre angling method! Peering over his shoulder to ensure Donkey was nowhere in sight to mock his upcoming disrobed state, Shrek grinned and promptly stripped. His butt revealed itself like two plump, green hams, glimmering with a faint sheen of perspiration that accentuated every dimple and curve. It was as if the gods of the swamp had crafted it specifically for the task at hand—with a flex, it could've been mistaken for two soggy, verdant boulders. His face, a classic Shrek visage of bulbous nose and broad, content smile, beamed with the anticipation of the feast to come. Shrek's robust physique, a testament to a lifetime of wrestling dragons and enduring the trials of fatherhood, waded into the refreshing pond with the grace of an overgrown, mossy hippopotamus. Once immersed in the cool embrace of the pond's depths, Shrek flipped onto his back with a splash that sent a family of frogs leaping for cover. There he floated, a green, ogre-ish iceberg, pleasured sigh escaping him. It was time for his gravitational lore—an piscatorial magnetism as ancient as it was potent. With a belly bulging like a cauldron ready to bubble over, Shrek let out a fart of such seismic power that it would have registered on the Richter scale. The water around him roiled and foamed, as bubbles burst forth in an odorous plume from his backside. The scent, a pungent amalgamation of onions, pond scum, and a week's worth of unwashed ogre, was enough to make any nearby animal faint. Yet, the fish of the swamp were not so fortunate. Drawn by the curiously seismic underwater phenomena (and their notoriously poor judgment), they swam towards the miasma. And then, as if struck by Poseidon's own trident, they keeled over, succumbing to the mighty Shrek's rear-end prowess. Dozens of fish floated belly-up, testimony to the most unconventional, yet wildly effective, fishing method ever known to ogre or man. Chuckling heartily, Shrek gathered the piscine bounty in his arms, unaware that the tale of his bottom-fueled fishing success would echo throughout the swamp for generations. Come sunset, the aroma of caramelizing onions and roasting fish teased the dank swamp air. Shrek, now clothed and ever the culinary savant, worked the kitchen in a dance of sizzling and seasoning. His gourmet spread was a sight to behold: garlic-crusted swamp bass, mud-root mash, and a side of fried critters. Situated at a roughly hewn table adorned with candles, Shrek looked upon his scrumptious handiwork—a dinner caught by tailwind alone. With a satisfied belch that resonated through the darkening trees, he raised a chunk of fish to the sky in a salute. \\"To me butt!\\" he laughed, his voice echoing across the swamp, \\"The finest fisher in all the land!\\" And so, within the confines of his cozy swamp home, the ogre dined like royalty, unaware that his aquatic performance would inspire a raucous ballad that Donkey would irritate him with for months to come."},{"instruction":"Y'know... the more I learn about some people in history the more I like my dog... I don't have a dog but let's just assume I have one.","output":"I understand the sentiment. The study of history can sometimes reveal the darker aspects of human nature and past events, including war, betrayal, cruelty, and injustice. These revelations may lead you to appreciate the simplicity and unconditional loyalty that a pet, such as a dog, can offer. Dogs are often celebrated for their companionship, love, and loyalty, which stand out as comforting and appealing qualities, especially when contrasted with less savory historical accounts. Our pets don't judge us by the same complex social, political, and moral standards that humans do, and their companionship can be a source of solace and joy. While acknowledging the importance of learning from history and understanding the complexities of human behavior, it's also wonderful to recognize and appreciate the happiness that pets bring into our lives. They can be a much-needed reprieve, a source of emotional support, and a reminder of the capacity for affection and simplicity in relationships."},{"instruction":"Maybe I should try to befriend some stray dog... visit him every day and feed him... I dunno, whatever dogs like.","output":"Befriending a stray dog can be a rewarding experience for both you and the animal. However, it's important to approach this carefully and responsibly. Here are some steps to consider if you're thinking about making friends with a stray dog: 1. **Safety First**: Stray dogs may be scared, defensive, or even aggressive due to their experiences. Always prioritize your safety and the dog's well-being. Approach slowly and cautiously without making direct eye contact, which can be perceived as a threat. 2. **Feeding**: Dogs are often motivated by food. Offering a stray dog something to eat can be a good way to gain their trust. Ensure the food is suitable for dogs and try to keep feedings consistent. 3. **Check for Identification**: Look for any tags, collars, or marks that indicate the dog may belong to someone or has been recently taken care of. 4. **Health and Welfare**: Stray dogs may have health issues or be in distress. Consider contacting a local animal rescue or shelter for guidance. They can help assess the dog's health, check for a microchip, and potentially find the dog's owner or provide it with a new home. 5. **Patience is Key**: It may take time for a stray dog to trust you. Be patient and let the dog set the pace. Regular visits and consistent kindness can build a bond over time. 6. **Legal Considerations**: Be mindful of local laws regarding stray animals. Some areas have specific regulations about feeding or harboring strays. 7. **Hygiene**: Stray dogs may carry parasites or diseases. Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly after interacting with them and before you touch your face or handle food. 8. **Long Term Plans**: Consider what your long-term plan is for the dog. If you are unable to provide a permanent home, reaching out to a local animal shelter or rescue group can ensure the dog gets the best chance at finding a forever home. Remember that every dog is an individual, with its own personality and history, so what works with one dog might not work with another. Taking on the care of a stray is a significant commitment, so ensure you are ready for the responsibilities that come with it. If you ever decide to adopt the dog officially, be prepared for veterinary visits, vaccinations, spaying or neutering, and providing a safe and loving environment."},{"instruction":"Or just get a hamster, easier that way.","output":"Absolutely! A hamster can be an excellent pet choice, especially if you're looking for an animal companion that's lower maintenance compared to a dog. Here are a few reasons why a hamster might be a more convenient pet: 1. **Space**: Hamsters require much less space than dogs. A suitable cage is all they need to live comfortably. 2. **Care**: While no pet is \\"easy\\" to take care of and all pets require responsibility, hamsters generally have simpler needs. They require food, water, a clean living environment, and some entertainment like a wheel for running. 3. **Time Commitment**: Hamsters are nocturnal and are most active at night, which means they may fit better into the schedule of someone who's busy during the day. 4. **Exercise**: Unlike dogs, hamsters don't need to be walked and can get their exercise in their cage with wheels and tunnels. 5. **Shorter Lifespan**: Hamsters typically live for 2 to 3 years, which is a commitment of time and emotional investment that's much shorter than that of most dogs. 6. **Lower Cost**: The overall cost of owning a hamster is generally lower than that of a dog when considering food, housing, and veterinary care. 7. **Independence**: Hamsters are more independent than dogs and can be left alone during the day as long as they have enough food and water. Before you decide to get a hamster, make sure you understand their specific needs — they require a proper diet, a clean cage, a quiet atmosphere during the day, and gentle handling, as they can be delicate and sometimes nippy if frightened or mishandled. Whether you choose a hamster, dog, or another type of pet, always consider the pet's needs and whether your lifestyle can accommodate them to ensure a happy relationship for both of you. Remember, the goal is to provide a safe, loving, and stable environment for any animal in your care."},{"instruction":"I'LL TREAT THAT HAMSTER BETTER THAN I PLAY VIDEO GAMES LOL","output":"That sounds like quite the commitment! Treating a pet with love and care, even more than you might dedicate to an activity you enjoy like playing video games, is a great approach to pet ownership. Pets, whether they're hamsters, dogs, or any other animal, thrive when they receive attention, proper care, and affection from their owners. Caring for a hamster will include providing a clean and spacious cage, regular feeding with a balanced diet, fresh water, and opportunities for exercise and mental stimulation, like a running wheel and tunnels. You'll also need to spend time with your hamster to socialize it properly and handle it gently to get it used to human interaction. Remember to research or consult with a vet about the specifics of hamster care to ensure you're ready for the responsibilities. By doing so, you're setting yourself and your future pet up for a happy and enjoyable companionship.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams.

История Пса/Эндрю/Эдварда, это история неудавшегося изобретателя, который просто хотел творить: 1. Изначально персонаж не был предназначен для этого, у него не было рук, он попытался научиться создавать навыки, внутри своей души, но в ходе ребаланса он лишился этого навыка. 2. Став человек, он чуть было не стал простым чародеем, но он смог выбрать изобретателя, у которого не было классовых умений на протяжении... всей игры, они появились только в Мёртвых землях. 3. Перед ним встал вопрос опыта и знаний, поэтому ему нужно было выучить новый язык, но когда он захотел остаться в библиотеке, перед ним поставили условие, что ему придется ждать, пока кто-нибудь не попадёт в темпест. 4. Пойдя коротким путем, его выкинуло возле Рубериуса и он направился в Темпест - город монстров, что-бы стать там кузнецом, но он так и не достиг его, потеряв старую сумку с интересными инструментами и получив в замен, одну книжку и много опыта. 5. Попав в Хейн, условия были мягко говоря не из лучших, из него хотели сделать пророка, вместо этого он решил отправиться в Анор Лондо, где у него было всё, что-бы начать создавать, но бессмысленная строгость и духота окружила это место. 6. И наконец, попав на землю, он думал, что сможет впитать в себя знания земли и направить её вектор развития, но что-то надломилось и история на этом закончилось, а он так ничего и не создал. У всех бывают плохие моменты, в эти моменты у всего сервера были проблемы вроде: проблемы с банком, ребаланса, другие личные проблемы, болезни админа, просто куратора нет, который даст тебе то, что ты хочешь, хоть и ценой некоторых жертв. Но сервер продолжает существовать, люди приходят и уходят, иногда остаются на подольше, но рано или поздно всё закончится. Пусть у всех получится интересная история, ваша история персонажа, которая понравится именно вам и не важно, что о ней думают другие. Моя история была веселой, помимо изобретений было много чего ещё, но я всё же считаю, что это Bad End, а не Happy End.","output":"Игрок, который написал отзыв, столкнулся с рядом проблем в течение своего игрового опыта на сервере: 1. **Изменения в механиках игры**: Персонаж игрока изначально не был предназначен для создания вещей, и в какой-то момент он потерял возможность развивать этот навык после ребаланса игры. 2. **Необходимость адаптироваться**: Игрок столкнулся с трудностями при выборе новой роли для своего персонажа, претендуя на роль изобретателя, который долго не имел классовых умений. 3. **Трудности в получении знаний**: Персонажу было необходимо овладеть новым языком и знаниями, но перед ним установили ограничения, связанные с ожиданием событий (например, ожидание кого-то в Темпесте). 4. **Проблемы в пути к достижению цели**: В пути к городу монстров Темпест, чтобы стать кузнецом, персонаж потерял свои инструменты и в итоге так и не добрался до намеченной цели. 5. **Негативные условия в новых местах**: Пребывание в различных местах вело к последствиям, не благоприятным для творчества, например, в одном месте появились негативные условия и попытки превращения персонажа в пророка, а в другом - столкновение с \\"бессмысленной строгостью и духотой\\". 6. **Отсутствие достижения целей**: Последняя попытка персонажа использовать знания земли для развития заканчивается неудачей, и его история завершается на этом моменте без реализации создания чего-либо значимого. Отзыв также упоминает общие проблемы, с которыми столкнулся весь сервер, включая технические проблемы с банковской системой, обширные ребалансы игры, личные проблемы участников, болезни администратора и отсутствие кураторов, готовых помочь игрокам достичь их целей. Несмотря на эти сложности, отзыв заканчивается на положительной ноте, с надеждой, что у других игроков получится построить их собственные интересные и удовлетворяющие истории персонажей.

Is it mind-reading or magic? Well, it's neither. The secret lies in the tiny front camera on your phone. TikTok uses this little eye to peek at your facial reactions and figure out what makes you laugh, smile, or even look away in boredom. Let's dig into how TikTok's been using this to feed you content you never knew you needed but can't seem to live without. # The Little Camera That Could The front camera on your phone may be something you associate with selfies or video calls, but for TikTok, it's much more. TikTok is all about giving you videos that you'll love, and to do this effectively, they've turned the front camera into a clever tool for reading your expressions. When you're scrolling through TikTok, chances are you'll react in some way to what you're watching, whether it's a small grin or raising your eyebrows in surprise. These tiny reactions are like clues that tell TikTok what kind of content keeps you hooked, and they're invaluable for building your personalized video stream. # How Your Expressions Shape Your Feed Just smiling at a funny cat video or staring longer at an impressive dance move can be enough for TikTok's system to note your preferences. But how does this work exactly? When you're watching a video, the app can track your facial reactions and the time you spend on each clip. Enjoying a video will mean more similar content; on the other hand, if you scroll past something quickly, TikTok takes the hint and shows you less of that type. What's interesting is that it's not just about the kinds of videos you like but also the emotions they evoke. Love heartwarming content? The smile you don on seeing a touching act of kindness is noted. Are you in awe of thrilling adventure clips? Your wide-eyed wonder won't go unnoticed either. This intricate web of reactions helps TikTok craft a feed that feels tailor-made for you. # Privacy and the Watchful Camera Now, it's important to pause and think about privacy because the idea of an app watching and analyzing your face might raise some eyebrows. TikTok has to balance personalization with user privacy, and they claim to give their users control over their data. Always check the app's privacy settings to know what you're comfortable with, and remember, you have the power to change these settings and control what you share. # Why Does Personalization Matter? You might ask why it's important for TikTok to personalize your feed so intricately. The answer ties back to the idea of keeping you engaged. The longer TikTok can hold your attention, the more successful it is as a platform. By showing you content that resonates with you personally, you're more likely to spend time on the app, share videos with friends, or even create your own content. A feed that reflects your tastes, your humor, and your interests means you're always just one swipe away from entertainment that feels like it was crafted just for you. It's the digital equivalent of a friend who knows exactly which movie to pick for movie night. # More Than Just Fun and Games While it's clear that this personalization has fun benefits—like turning your daily scroll into a highlight reel of things you love—it also has broader implications. The more you engage with certain types of content, the more you may find yourself in a bubble of similar videos. This can be great if you're exploring a hobby, learning a new skill, or simply needing a laugh. However, it's also worth stepping outside of your video comfort zone now and then. Discovering diverse content can open your eyes to new ideas, different cultures, and a variety of perspectives. So while TikTok's clever use of the front camera can fill your feed with joy, don't forget to search for something new once in a while; it could lead to your next big passion or interest. # Embracing the Future of Personalized Content As we look ahead, it's clear that personalization and technology will only become more intertwined. TikTok is leading the charge with innovative uses of the front camera, but this is just the beginning. Moving forward, we'll likely see more apps and platforms finding ways to offer individualized experiences that anticipate our likes and dislikes. Remember, though, that the power is in your hands—or, in this case, your expressions. You shape your digital environment with each smile, laugh, and look of wonder. So keep enjoying your personalized adventures on TikTok, and don't be afraid to explore beyond your algorithm-curated comfort zone. Who knows what your next smile might discover?"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong? You seem…angry.

Целью данной курсовой работы является анализ современных методов и подходов к развитию жизненных компетенций у детей с тяжелыми и множественными нарушениями развития, а также выявление наиболее эффективных практик и стратегий, способствующих повышению их самостоятельности и жизнеспособности. Исследуемая проблема пронизывает многие аспекты педагогической науки и практики, а также социальной работы и психологии, что делает её междисциплинарной. При этом, отмечается, что несмотря на значительное количество работ, посвящённых специальному образованию и реабилитации, вопросы целенаправленного формирования жизненных компетенций у детей с комплексными нарушениями развития до сих пор не получили должного внимания и систематизации. Актуальность темы обусловлена, в первую очередь, необходимостью обеспечения равных возможностей для всех категорий детей в области обучения и развития. Разработка эффективных программ и вмешательств, направленных на развитие жизненных компетенций, не только повышает шансы детей с ограниченными возможностями здоровья на полноценное включение в общественную жизнь, но и способствует формированию более инклюзивного общества, где каждый индивид, независимо от своих физических или умственных особенностей, может реализовывать свой потенциал. В научном плане изучение данной темы направлено на дополнение и развитие существующих педагогических теорий и концепций, включая инклюзивное образование и индивидуальный подход к обучению и воспитанию детей с особыми потребностями. В практическом отношении результаты исследования могут послужить основой для создания обновленных программ по обучению и социализации данной категории учащихся, а также для разработки методических рекомендаций для педагогов, родителей и специалистов, работающих в сфере специального и инклюзивного образования. В данные работы включены обзор литературы по теме, обоснование актуальности развития жизненных компетенций у детей с тяжелыми и множественными нарушениями развития, анализ существующих подходов и практик, ідентифікація пробельних зон в исследованиях и педагогической практике, а также предложения по усовершенствованию методик и стратегий."},{"instruction":"Мне нужно чисто введение с общими сведениями пока будто отдельно от курсовой. Не надо писать туда цель и тому подобное, просто напиши введение, сведения об этой теме","output":"Введение Современное образование сталкивается с безусловно сложной задачей обучения и развития детей с тяжелыми и множественными нарушениями развития (ТМНР). У этой категории детей могут быть выявлены различные поражения и дефициты на физическом, психологическом, когнитивном или социальном уровнях, которые взаимодействуют между собой, порождая уникальные образовательные потребности. Жизненные компетенции — это фундаментальные знания и навыки, которые необходимы каждому человеку для успешной адаптации в обществе, самостоятельного принятия решений и обеспечения возможности вести полноценный, независимый образ жизни. Они охватывают широкий спектр аспектов, от повседневной самообслуживающей деятельности и коммуникативных навыков до способности решать проблемы и принимать участие в социальных взаимодействиях. Особые образовательные потребности детей с ТМНР требуют адаптированных подходов, специально направленных на их индивидуальные особенности. Инклюзивное образование стремится предоставить возможности для обучения и комфортного включения в образовательную среду, однако развитие жизненных компетенций выходит за рамки формального образования, требуя системного и комплексного подхода. Перед образовательными системами и специалистами в области реабилитации стоит вызов — поиск инновационных и эффективных практик, которые могли бы удовлетворить уникальные потребности этой уязвимой группы населения. Центральная задача состоит в том, чтобы признать и ценить разнообразие способностей и талантов каждого ребенка, прививая навыки, необходимые для достойной и полноценной жизни. Значительные изменения в политике и практике образования в последние десятилетия подчеркивают важность доступа к качественному образованию для всех детей, включая тех, кто испытывает сложные обучающие препятствия. Это трансформировало традиционные понятия о том, как и где следует обучать детей с ТМНР, выдвигая вперед идею индивидуального обучения и развития. Ключевым моментом в разработке программ для детей с ТМНР является не только учет специфических образовательных потребностей, но и фокусирование на междисциплинарных взаимодействиях, объединяющих усилия педагогов, психологов, медицинских и социальных работников. Всё это реализуется с целью создания благоприятных условий для гармоничного развития личности и формирования жизнеспособных индивидов."},{"instruction":"Отлично, а теперь сделай это введение больше и содержательней. Оно должно быть основано на реальных фактах и научных знаниях","output":"Введение Проблематика развития жизненных компетенций у детей с тяжелыми и множественными нарушениями развития становится предметом все более пристального внимания со стороны специалистов в области образования, социальной работы и медицины. Исследования последних десятилетий позволяют утверждать, что обучение и поддержка таких детей требуют глубоко индивидуального подхода и внедрения междисциплинарных практик, что подчеркивает масштаб и сложность этой задачи. По данным Всемирной организации здравоохранения, миллионы детей по всему миру живут с тяжелыми и множественными нарушениями развития. Это создает огромный запрос на разработку и реализацию образовательных программ, которые могут обеспечить им достойное будущее. Проблема усугубляется тем, что социальная интеграция и личная самореализация детей с ТМНР требуют не только специализированной образовательной поддержки, но и адекватного социального признания их нужд и прав. Жизненные компетенции как ключевой компонент успешной адаптации в обществе охватывают способность к самообслуживанию, обучаемость, социальную адаптацию и эмоциональное развитие. Различные методологии, направленные на развитие этих компетенций, часто включают в себя элементы развития моторики, улучшение коммуникативных навыков и способности к решению практических задач повседневной жизни. Существующие исследования показывают, что раннее вмешательство и предоставление комплексной поддержки существенно повышает шансы детей с ТМНР на приобретение важнейших жизненных навыков. Программы, такие как ранняя стратегическая помощь в обучении, могут включать физиотерапию, логопедические занятия, а также практические занятия по самостоятельной жизни, нацеленные на стимулирование когнитивной и эмоциональной сфер ребенка. На сегодняшний день стандартизированная система для формирования компетенций у детей с ТМНР отсутствует, что подчеркивает необходимость индивидуальной оценки потенциала развития и личных предпочтений каждого ребенка. Образовательные учреждения, зачастую опирающиеся на Индивидуальные Образовательные Программы (ИОП), работают над созданием уникальных планов обучения, которые стимулируют и поддерживают развитие ключевых компетенций каждого ученика. Социальная инклюзия остается одной из важнейших целей в процессе образования детей с ТМНР. Прогресс в данной сфере зависит от широкого круга факторов, включая уровень осведомленности общества о проблемах таких детей, готовности образовательных систем адаптироваться к разнообразию учебных потребностей и эффективности законодательства в области прав детей с особенностями развития. Помимо формального образовательного процесса, значительную роль в формировании жизненных компетенций играют семья и ближайшее социальное окружение. Поддержка со стороны родителей, родственников и друзей незаменима и играет фундаментальную роль в успешной социальной адаптации и получении навыков для независимой жизни. В свете этих фактов, нахождение эффективных подходов к развитию жизненных компетенций у детей с ТМНР остается критически важной задачей. Такие подходы должны базироваться на доказательной науке и включать в себя не только образовательные, но и терапевтические, социальные и реабилитационные компоненты, обеспечивая максимальное развитие потенциала каждого ребенка в целостном, инклюзивном и поддерживающем обществе."},{"instruction":"What would you teach for this CED content? CED Content: TOPIC 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass ENDURING UNDERSTANDING SPQ-1 The mole allows different units to be compared. LEARNING OBJECTIVE SPQ-1.A Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept. ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE SPQ-1.A.1 One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes. SPQ-1.A.2 Avogadro’s number (N = 6.022 × 1023 mol−1 A ) provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance. SPQ-1.A.3 Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains.","output":"Based on the CED content provided for Topic 1.1 Moles and Molar Mass, I would structure the teaching sequence as follows to cover the necessary concepts: 1. Introduction to the Mole Concept: - Explain the mole as the SI unit for the amount of substance. - Discuss why the mole is a convenient bridge between the macroscopic world (grams, liters) and the microscopic world (atoms, molecules). 2. Understanding Avogadro's Number: - Define Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10^23 mol^−1) and explain its significance. - Relate Avogadro's number to the mole, ensuring students understand that one mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number of particles. 3. Atomic Mass and Molar Mass: - Explain atomic mass units (amu) and how they relate to the masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons. - Show how the molar mass (in grams/mole) of an element is numerically equal to its atomic mass (in amu) and the significance of this. 4. Dimensional Analysis and the Mole: - Practice using dimensional analysis to convert between units. - Convert from mass to moles and moles to the number of particles. - Use the mole concept to calculate the relative number of particles in given amounts of substances. 5. Practical Applications and Problem-solving: - Illustrate the concepts with examples of chemical reactions, emphasizing the proportional relationships between reactants and products (stoichiometry). - Present varied practice problems involving the calculation of masses, moles, and the number of particles. - Conduct laboratory exercises to reinforce these concepts, such as determining the molar mass of a volatile liquid by vapor density or using gravimetric analysis. Throughout this sequence, it is essential to emphasize the following key points: - The mole is a counting unit for particles, similar to a dozen for eggs. - There is a direct relationship between moles and the number of atoms or molecules (via Avogadro's number). - The molar mass connects the macroscopic masses we measure to the microscopic accounting of particles by moles. - Dimensional analysis (unit conversion) is a critical tool for calculations involving the mole concept. To assess and reinforce students' understanding, employ a variety of assessment methods, including quizzes, homework assignments, and lab reports. Encourage students to discuss and apply the concepts to real-world chemical scenarios to deepen their understanding of the mole and its role in chemistry."},{"instruction":"What would you teach for this CED content?

For this topic, engaging students with hands-on learning through virtual labs or analyzing provided mass spectra data introduces a practical application to the theoretical knowledge, solidifying their understanding. Assess their grasp of the material with problem sets and, if possible, a laboratory experience that reinforces these concepts."},{"instruction":"Please create a vividly detailed and comedic fanfiction of Shrek catching fish for his dinner by using his favorite method of wading into a pond in the buff (describe the appearance of his butt, face, physique) and relieving himself by farting in the water. Any fish that smells Shrek’s underwater fart dies. he happily collects them. Back at home he cooks a gourmet dinner using the fish.","output":"Once upon a swamp, as the late afternoon sun dipped low in the sky, painting it with strokes of orange and purple, the great green ogre known as Shrek decided it was high time for dinner. But this wouldn't be just any dinner; it would be a feast befitting an ogre of his caliber and appetite. The menu of the day? Freshly caught fish, Shrek-style. Shrek sauntered towards his favorite fishing pond, located just a stone's throw from his beloved swampy abode. The water gleamed like a mirror, oblivious to the culinary upheaval it was about to endure. With a smirk playing on his lips, Shrek began shedding his clothes without a hint of shyness until he stood in all his glory — in the buff. His butt was a sight to behold, a full moon rising from the horizon of his massive, muscular legs. If it had cheeks, they would have dimpled with pride. The physique of Shrek, although not chiseled by conventional standards, was undeniably ogre-fit, a testament to years of boulder tossing and dragon wrestling. With a wiggle of his eyebrows that betrayed his childish glee, Shrek tiptoed into the pond, the cool water lapping against his pasty green skin. The fauna of the pond scattered at the sight of his approaching derriere, a notorious weapon in these parts. Seconds passed as the ogre settled in. His face, a canvas of anticipation, screwed up in concentration; his swampy eyes shone with mischievous intent. Then, without warning, a sound erupted from the depths of Shrek that echoed through the trees like the roar of a distant thunderstorm. A monumental fart blossomed beneath the water's surface, creating bubbles that would put champagne to shame. The underwater belch released a cloud of potent swamp gas, a fragrance so strong it could peel the bark off a tree. Fish of all shapes and sizes floated up, succumbing to the mighty stench that had been unleashed upon their aquatic realm. After a hearty chuckle at the fruits of his labor, Shrek waded through the water, collecting the belly-up buffet. \\"Better out than in, I always say,\\" he laughed to himself, quoting his own timeless wisdom. Back in his cozy swamp kitchen, Shrek set to work. He lit a fire under his large iron cauldron and dropped in a dollop of butter that sizzled with promise. He added finely chopped onions, garlic, and a pinch of swamp herbs, the aroma mixing into a concoction of tantalizing smells that would make even the most refined chef turn green with envy. One by one, Shrek delicately placed the fish into the cauldron. The fish sizzled as they kissed the bottom, their scales reflecting the flickering firelight. With a flick of his wrist, Shrek sprinkled some 'Fart-fect' Seasoning'—a secret blend of spices only an ogre would dare use. Once cooked to perfection, Shrek plated his gourmet dinner with the utmost care, arranging them alongside a mound of mashed root vegetables. He admired his work, his face aglow with a mix of pride and hunger. With gusto, Shrek dug in, his fork and knife working in perfect harmony. Each bite was a symphony of flavors that danced upon his tongue. He let out a jovial, contented sigh. \\"Better in than out, after this feast,\\" he mumbled through a mouthful of fish, totally at peace in his swampy paradise. And so, with a belly as full as the moon above, Shrek, the master chef, and fisherman extraordinaire, settled down for a nap. His dreams filled with the merry bubbles of underwater serenades, reminding him of the peculiar, yet effective, fishing technique that never seemed to fail him. All was well in the swamp once more."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong? You seem…angry.

Some make you laugh; others tug at your heartstrings. Ever wonder how TikTok seems to know what you like? Let me pull back the curtain on TikTok’s secret tool: the front camera on your phone. # The Magic Behind the Screen It starts with the front camera, that tiny window at the top of your phone. When you open TikTok, the camera becomes the app's eyes, watching your every reaction. Whether you smile, frown, or look surprised, the camera is capturing it all. But how does this turn into the videos that pop up on your feed? # The Science of Seeing Here’s where it gets fascinating. TikTok uses something called 'computer vision'. It's like teaching a computer to see like a human. By analyzing your face, the app figures out how you feel about what you’re watching. A smile might mean you like funny pet videos, while a look of amazement could suggest that magic tricks are your thing. # Content That Keeps You Hooked The goal of TikTok is to keep you watching, and how better to do that than by showing you stuff you love? By using your facial reactions, the app can deliver a non-stop stream of videos tailored just for you. It’s like having a friend who knows your taste in videos so well; they always know what to show you next. # More Than Meets the Eye But it’s not just about keeping you entertained. The videos you see can shape what you think and feel about the world. Sometimes, the line between fun clips and propaganda – information meant to influence opinions – is thin. And that's where it can get a bit tricky. # When Videos Start to Sway Propaganda isn't always easy to spot. It can be as simple as a video that makes you think differently about a new gadget or as heavy as ones that try to sway your opinions on big topics. TikTok, owned by a Chinese company, could potentially use the app to serve up videos that nudge your mindset in certain directions—whether that's about a product, an idea, or even a country. # Staying Aware While You Scroll So, what can you do? Being aware is the first step. Know that not everything you see is random. When you're aware that your facial reactions might influence your feed, you start to understand that TikTok doesn’t just magically ‘get you’. The app is designed to learn from and adapt to your reactions. # Balancing Fun and Awareness Don’t get me wrong, TikTok can be a blast. It’s a great place to discover new things and enjoy content that speaks to you. Just keep in mind that the videos you watch could be influenced by more than your laughs and likes. The key is to enjoy TikTok while staying sharp. # The Conversation Continues Let’s keep this conversation going. It’s worth discussing how these technologies impact our choices and views. When apps use our own faces to decide what we watch, we need to think about what this means for us as individuals and as a society. So, the next time you're on TikTok, take a moment to reflect. Are you choosing to watch these videos, or is the app steering your emotions? Either way, now you know the secret behind your tailor-made TikTok experience."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) MC (me): “Natsuki, what’s wrong? You seem…angry.

I don’t need your sympathy or anyone else’s for that matter.” (I watch as Natsuki quickly packs up her things and storms out of the room, slamming the door behind her.) MC: (sighing) “I hope she’s okay…I’ll have to check on her later.” (Sayori approaches me, concern written all over her face.) Sayori: “MC, do you think there’s something wrong with Natsuki?” MC: “Probably, Sayori. She’s been acting a lot angrier than normal lately. What do you think is wrong with her?” Sayori: “Well, I also saw her eating pickles and brocolli with her cupcakes - which she normally wouldn’t do, considering she’s got a sweet tooth. I actually read that mood swings and cravings for unusual things are signs of early pregnancy. Maybe she’s pregnant?” MC: “Pregnant? That’s a possibility, I guess. But why would she be so upset about it?” Sayori: “Well, maybe she’s scared or unsure about what to do. I’ll try talking to her later and see if she opens up about it. In the meantime, let’s just give her some space and support.” MC: “Yeah, good idea. Let’s make sure she knows we’re here for her if she needs us.” (Later that day, Sayori and I check up on Natsuki.) Natsuki: (tearfully) “I…I am pregnant. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared and I feel so alone.” Sayori: “Natsuki, we’re here for you. You’re not alone in this. We’ll support you no matter what decision you make.” MC: “Yeah, we care about you, Natsuki. Just know that we’re here to help and listen.” Natsuki: (sniffling) “Thank you…thank you both. I don’t know what I would do without you guys.” (Sayori and I embrace Natsuki, comforting her during this difficult time.) MC: “We’re in this together, Natsuki. We’ll figure things out as a team.” (Natsuki smiles through her tears, grateful for our support. On the day of the festival, Natsuki was in her 7th month of pregnancy. We made sure to take care of her, making sure she was comfortable and had everything she needed. But just as I was putting the booth together, I hear Natsuki gasp in pain.) Natsuki: “Ow, it hurts! I think the baby’s coming!” MC: “Quick, someone call an ambulance!” (Sayori rushes to call for help while I stay with Natsuki, trying to keep her calm.) MC: “Just breathe, Natsuki. It’s going to be okay. You’re going to be okay.” (I continue to time Natsuki’s contractions, checking to see if we need to prepare for the baby’s arrival. Just as we were waiting for the ambulance,","output":"Natsuki suddenly cries out in pain as she gives birth to a beautiful baby girl. The paramedics arrive just in time to help, and soon both Natsuki and her baby are safely taken to the hospital. After a few days, Natsuki and her baby are discharged from the hospital and return home. We all gather back in the literature clubroom, now transformed into a makeshift nursery for Natsuki’s daughter. Natsuki: (smiling tearfully) “Thank you, MC, Sayori. I don’t know what I would have done without your support. I’m so grateful to have you both in my life.” Sayori: “You don’t have to thank us, Natsuki. We’ll always be here for you and your little one. We’re like a family now.” MC: “Yeah, that’s right. We’re all in this together. And now, we have a new member to welcome into our literature club family.” (The three of us smile at each other, feeling the warmth and love that now fills the room. Natsuki’s daughter coos softly in her arms, already a part of our close-knit group. And as we continue to support and care for each other, we know that no matter what challenges may come our way, we will face them together, as a family.)"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],B={key:0},j={key:1};function G(n,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",D,' No results found for "'+u(o.searchQuery)+'".
