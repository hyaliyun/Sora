The radius (r) of the circle that this point lies on can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: r = sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{5}. Thus, we have: - sin alpha = frac{opposite}{hypotenuse} = frac{2}{sqrt{5}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} - cos alpha = frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{5} Given that sin alpha > cos alpha, we can deduce that frac{pi}{4} < alpha < frac{pi}{2} because sine values are greater than cosine values in the first quadrant, and both reach their peak at frac{pi}{2}. Given sin(alpha+beta) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we know that alpha + beta is an angle whose sine value corresponds to an angle of frac{pi}{4} or frac{3pi}{4}, considering the positive value of sine. Since alpha is in the first quadrant, and beta is acute, alpha + beta must be in the second quadrant, implying frac{pi}{2} < alpha + beta < pi. Thus, cos(alpha + beta) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} because cosine is negative in the second quadrant. To find sin beta and cos beta, we use the sum and difference formulas: - sin beta = sin[(alpha+beta)-alpha] = sin(alpha+beta)cosalpha - cos(alpha+beta)sinalpha - Plugging in the values, we get sin beta = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{5}}{5} - (-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) cdot frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} = frac{3sqrt{10}}{10} Similarly, for cos beta, knowing that beta is acute and thus cos beta is positive, and given the relationship between sin beta and cos beta for acute angles, we find: - cosbeta = frac{sqrt{10}}{10} Therefore, the tangent of beta, which is the ratio of sin beta to cos beta, is calculated as follows: - tanbeta = frac{sinbeta}{cosbeta} = frac{frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}}{frac{sqrt{10}}{10}} = 3 Hence, the answer is: boxed{3}."},{"instruction":"Kelly has some Nintendo games.

A line segment between two points with distance ( d ) is referred to as the diameter of this set of ( n ) points.

Let d be the maximum distance between any two points among them. The line segment connecting the two points that are d apart is called the diameter of the n points set. We need to prove that this set of points contains no more than n diameters.  Step 2: Setting up the Points and the Distances Consider a point A and let it be connected to k other points B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k such that the segments AB_i (for i=1,2,ldots,k) are all diameters. Thus, we have: [ AB_j = d, quad j = 1, 2, ldots, k ] And we also know: [ B_iB_j leqslant d, quad 1 leqslant i < j leqslant k ]  Step 3: Constraints from Circular Geometry Since B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k lie on the circle centered at A with radius d, these points must subtend angles at A that are at most 60^circ each. Assuming B_1 and B_k are endpoints on the arc of this circle, the remaining points B_2, B_3, ldots, B_{k-1} lie on the arc B_1B_k.  Step 4: Intersection Points This means all these points lie within the intersection S of the three circles centered at A, B_1, and B_k each with radius d. Clearly, B_2 must also lie inside this arrangement, meaning it introduces only one new unique diameter emanating from B_2.  Step 5: Generalizing to all Points By similar reasoning, any other points B_i for i=3, ldots, k-1 also introduce only one additional unique diameter. Thus, considering the point A combined with these k-1 effective segments that originate from other points, we have a contribution of 2(k-1) diameters.  Step 6: Summarizing Total Diameters in the Point Set Generalizing this for an arbitrary n point set, consider that every point that introduces at least three diameters constructs similar sets. Each set has exactly one point introducing at least three diameters, while other points in the set contribute only one additional diameter each. Therefore, set partitions contribute a total of 2n diameters when considering the duplication inherent in any calculation (each diameter is counted twice). Since every diameter is counted twice in such counts, the total number of unique diameters across all points is at most n.

First, recall that the area ( S ) of triangle ( triangle ABC ) inscribed in a circle of radius ( R ) with semi-perimeter ( p ) is given by ( S = Rp ) where for ( R = 1 ), we have ( S = p ).     2. Now, consider the formulae for the radii ( r_a ), ( r_b ), and ( r_c ) of the excircles opposite to vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), respectively. Recall that:    [     r_a = frac{S}{p - a}, quad r_b = frac{S}{p - b}, quad r_c = frac{S}{p - c}    ]    Given ( S = p ), we have:    [     r_a = frac{p}{p - a}, quad r_b = frac{p}{p - b}, quad r_c = frac{p}{p - c}    ] 3.

Considering the range of values for the smallest radius ( r_a ):    [     frac{1}{r_a} = 1 - frac{a}{p}    ]    If ( a ) is the smallest side, then ( a ) can be as small as we like compared to the perimeter, making ( 1 - frac{a}{p} ) close to 1:    [     1 - frac{a}{p} < 1    ]    Therefore, we have:    [     r_a > 1    ]    The upper bound for ( r_a ) occurs when ( a ) is maximized.

Define the recursive relationship for ( p_{11}^{(n)} ): [ p_{11}^{(n)} = p_{11}^{(n-1)} p_{11} + p_{12}^{(n-1)} p_{21} ] 2.

These are binary numbers.     - The total count of such numbers is ( 2^m ), which is more than ( n ) since ( 2^m > n ). 3. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:**     - Since there are ( 2^m ) numbers and only ( n ) possible remainders when divided by ( n ) (ranging from 0 to ( n-1 )), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two numbers among the ( 2^m ) that give the same remainder when divided by ( n ). 4. **Form Differences and Verify Multiples:**     - Let ( a ) and ( b ) be two such numbers (where their digits are 0 or 1) that yield the same remainder when divided by ( n ).     - The difference ( a - b ) is then divisible by ( n ), i.e., ( n | (a - b) ). 5. **Calculating the Bound for Multiples:**     - We need to show that this difference ( a - b ) is less than ( n^4 ).     - Note: The maximum value for such differences is based on the number of digits of ( a ) and ( b ), which is ( m ).     - The largest possible binary number with ( m ) digits is ( 111ldots1_2 ) (with ( m ) ones), and it equals ( 2^m - 1 ).          - Thus, the maximum difference:     [     |a - b| leq 2^m - 1 < 2^m     ] 6. **Comparison with ( n^4 ):**     - We know ( 2^{m-1} leq n ), multiply both sides by ( 2 ), yielding ( 2^m leq 2n ).     - That implies ( 2^m < 2n^4 ), thus our difference is smaller than ( 2n^4 ). 7. **Evaluation of Digits:**     - Specifically, since ( a ) and ( b ) strictly use digits 0 and 1, their difference can only have digits 0, 1, 8, and 9, as no carries over the digit boundaries can occur commonly on subtraction to form numbers outside this set. 8. **Conclusion:**     - Hence, the difference ( a - b ) is guaranteed to be a multiple of ( n ) that is less than ( n^4 ), using at most 4 distinct digits (0, 1, 8, and 9).

Additionally, since (|sin alpha|) is greater, it implies (sin alpha) is more negative than (cos alpha). 3. Since (sin alpha) is negative and greater (in absolute terms) than the positive (cos alpha), we deduce (sin alpha < cos alpha). 4. We use the identity (sin alpha + cos alpha = -frac{3}{sqrt{5}}).

Recall another identity for squares of sums and differences:    [    (sin alpha + cos alpha)^2 + (sin alpha - cos alpha)^2 = 2(sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha) = 2    ] 8.

Prove that there is another sequence of  n  zeros and ones that occurs exactly  M  times.","output":"1. **Define the Problem Context:**    We are given a circular strip of paper with a sequence of zeros and ones. For each sequence ( w ) of ( n ) zeros and ones, we count the number of ways to cut out a fragment from the strip on which ( w ) is written. We know that the sequence ( 1100ldots0 ) (with ( n-2 ) zeros) occurs the most number of times, denoted by ( M ), and the sequence ( 00ldots011 ) (with ( n-2 ) zeros) occurs the least number of times. We need to prove that there is another sequence of ( n ) zeros and ones that occurs exactly ( M ) times. 2. **Initial Assumptions and Definitions:**    Suppose the circular strip contains ( a_1 ) zeros followed by ( b_1 ) ones, then ( a_2 ) zeros followed by ( b_2 ) ones, and so on until ( a_k ) zeros followed by ( b_k ) ones, completing the loop. Let ( m ) be the number of occurrences of the sequence ( 00ldots11 ) (with ( n-2 ) zeros). 3. **Case Analysis:**    - If ( k = 1 ), then the strip is homogeneous, and any string of length ( n ) must appear exactly ( M ) times. This case is trivial.    - Assume ( k > 1 ). 4. **Counting Occurrences:**    For a statement ( X ), define its truth value as ( 1_X ), where ( 1_X = 0 ) if ( X ) is false and ( 1 ) otherwise. The sequence ( 00ldots11 ) appears when a string of zeros contains at least ( n-2 ) zeros followed by at least 2 ones.

Denote these counts by ( X_1 ) and ( X_2 ) respectively. 7. **Relating ( M ) and ( m ):**    We have:    [    M - m = X_1 - X_2    ]    Since ( X_1 - X_2 leq M - m ), equality must hold, implying ( X_1 = M ) and ( X_2 = m ). 8. **Conclusion:**    The sequence ( 0ldots010 ) (with ( n-1 ) zeros) appears exactly ( M ) times.

The players take turns to split a pile with more than one stone into two smaller piles. Kolya plays first. The objective is to be the player who, after their move, leaves only piles of one stone. 2. **Initial Move by Kolya:**     Kolya divides the initial pile of 100 stones into two piles of 63 and 37 stones. This is crucial because the number 100 decomposed into 63 and 37 is a strategic move. This specific decomposition is based on what is known in game theory as **Nim-sum** (XOR summation property). 3. **Game Theory Insight - Grundy Numbers and Winning Strategy:**     - Every position in a combinatorial game can be assigned a Grundy number or Nim-sum.     - A position with a Grundy number of zero is a losing position if the opponent plays optimally.     - The initial position of a single pile of 100 stones is given by ( G(100) = 100 ) in terms of Grundy numbers.     - After splitting 100 into 63 and 37, we compute the Nim-sum (XOR):       [       63 oplus 37 = left(111111_2right) oplus left(100101_2right) = 011010_2 = 26       ] 4. **Ensuring Kolya's Win with Optimal Play:**     - After Kolya's first move to 63 and 37, the resulting Grundy number is 26, which is not zero. This indicates that Kolya has the winning strategy if she continues to play optimally.      - Vitya will then have to play in a state where the sum is non-zero, ensuring that Kolya can always make a move to revert to a non-zero sum, maintaining her advantageous position. 5. **Iterative Strategy Application:**     In each subsequent turn, Kolya can continue to ensure that after she splits a pile, the Nim-sum (XOR) of the sizes of all piles is non-zero. This strategy can force Vitya into a series of moves that lead to a final configuration where Vitya leaves only piles with one stone, thus granting Kolya the win. **Conclusion:** Kolya will win as long as she follows this optimal strategy from the beginning: [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"instruction":"Eight distinct pieces of candy are to be distributed among three bags.

When climbing 5 steps at a time, there are 2 steps left at the top, which can be represented as: [n equiv 2 pmod{5}] From the first condition, we can express n in terms of a variable k (where k is an integer) as follows: [n = 3 + 4k] We then substitute this expression for n into the second condition to find a relationship involving k: [3 + 4k equiv 2 pmod{5}] Simplifying this congruence, we aim to find the value of k that satisfies it. We can rearrange and simplify the expression to find that k must satisfy the following condition: [4k equiv -1 pmod{5}] [k equiv 1 pmod{5}] This means k can be expressed in terms of another integer t as: [k = 1 + 5t] Substituting this expression for k back into our expression for n gives us: begin{align*} n &= 3 + 4(1 + 5t)  &= 3 + 4 + 20t  &= 7 + 20t end{align*} This final expression shows that n is of the form 7 + 20t, which means n is congruent to 7 modulo 20: [n equiv 7 pmod{20}] The smallest value of n that is greater than 10 and satisfies this condition is boxed{27}."},{"instruction":"There are 64 pigs in the barn.

What is the trapezoid's area in sq cm?","output":"To solve for the area of the isosceles trapezoid, we start by examining the triangle formed by one of the diagonals, one of the legs, and the longer base. The lengths of these sides are 40 cm (diagonal), 30 cm (leg), and 50 cm (longer base). Recognizing these lengths, we identify a Pythagorean triple, indicating that this triangle is a right triangle. Therefore, we can calculate the altitude (height) of the trapezoid, which is also the height of this right triangle, using the formula for the area of a triangle, A = frac{1}{2}ab, where a and b are the legs of the triangle. In this case, we rearrange the formula to solve for the height (h) as follows: [h = frac{30 cdot 40}{50} = 24 , text{cm}] Next, we consider the right triangle formed by the altitude, the adjacent leg of the trapezoid, and part of the longer base. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is one of the legs of the trapezoid (30 cm), and one leg is the altitude we just calculated (24 cm). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the other leg (part of the longer base) as follows: [a^2 + b^2 = c^2 Rightarrow 24^2 + b^2 = 30^2 Rightarrow b^2 = 900 - 576 = 324 Rightarrow b = 18 , text{cm}] Since the trapezoid is isosceles, there are two such segments of length 18 cm on the longer base, one on each side of the shorter base. Thus, the length of the shorter base is: [50 , text{cm} - 2 cdot 18 , text{cm} = 14 , text{cm}] Finally, the area of the trapezoid can be calculated using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, A = frac{1}{2}(a + b)h, where a and b are the lengths of the two bases, and h is the height. Substituting the known values, we get: [A = frac{1}{2}(50 + 14) cdot 24 = frac{1}{2} cdot 64 cdot 24 = 768 , text{sq cm}] Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is boxed{768} sq cm."},{"instruction":"Given a sequence {a_n} satisfying a_7=15, and the point (a_n,a_{n+1}) (ninmathbb{N}^*) lies on the graph of the function y=x+2.

For any such bus route a with n stops, the remaining n-1 routes must pass through the same stops. 9. **Combinations**:     Condition 3^{circ} ensures that there are no overlaps between the sets of pairwise intersecting routes sharing stops, thus the total number of unique routes must be n(n-1) + 1. 10. **Quadratic Equation**:     Set up the equation based on the total number of routes 57:     [     n(n-1) + 1 = 57     ]     Simplifying, we obtain:     [     n^2 - n - 56 = 0     ]     Solve this quadratic equation,     [     n = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 4 cdot 56}}{2} = frac{1 pm sqrt{225}}{2} = frac{1 pm 15}{2}     ]     Therefore,     [     n = 8 quad text{or} quad n = -7     ] 11. **Conclusion**:     Since n must be a positive integer, n = 8.

Let's denote the speed of the man in still water as Vm and the speed of the stream as Vs. When the man is rowing upstream, his effective speed (Vu) is the difference between his speed in still water and the speed of the stream, because the stream is working against him. So we have: Vu = Vm - Vs When the man is rowing downstream, his effective speed (Vd) is the sum of his speed in still water and the speed of the stream, because the stream is helping him along. So we have: Vd = Vm + Vs We are given that: Vm = 28 kmph (speed of the man in still water) Vu = 26 kmph (speed of the man rowing upstream) Using the upstream speed equation, we can solve for Vs: Vu = Vm - Vs 26 kmph = 28 kmph - Vs Vs = 28 kmph - 26 kmph Vs = 2 kmph (speed of the stream) Now that we have the speed of the stream, we can find the downstream speed using the downstream speed equation: Vd = Vm + Vs Vd = 28 kmph + 2 kmph Vd = 30 kmph Therefore, the speed of the man rowing downstream is boxed{30}  kmph."},{"instruction":"hop sells 1 chocolate at the rate rupee 1 each . you can exchange 3 warppers for one chocolate . if you have rs . 15 , what is the maximum number of chocolates you can get ?","output":"If you have Rs. 15, you can initially buy 15 chocolates for Rs. 15 as each chocolate costs Rs. 1.

Part (a) 1. **Determine the Demand Function**:    Given that the demand function is linear, we can assume it has the form:    [    Q^D(p) = k cdot p + b,    ]    where ( Q ) represents the quantity demanded and ( p ) is the price. 2. **Use the Provided Information to Set Up the Equations**:    We are provided with the following points on the demand curve:    [    begin{cases}    text{At } p = 2 text{, } Q^D(2) = 8     text{At } p = 3 text{, } Q^D(3) = 6    end{cases}    ]    Substituting these points into the linear demand function:    [    begin{cases}    8 = 2k + b     6 = 3k + b    end{cases}    ] 3. **Solve the System of Equations to Find ( k ) and ( b )**:    Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate ( b ):    [    6 = 3k + b - (8 = 2k + b) implies  -2 = k implies k = -2    ]    Substitute ( k ) into one of the original equations to find ( b ):    [    8 = 2(-2) + b implies 8 = -4 + b implies b = 12    ]    Thus, the demand function is:    [    Q^D(p) = -2p + 12    ] 4. **Find the Equilibrium Price and Quantity**:    The supply function given is:    [    Q^S(p) = 2 + 8p    ]    At equilibrium, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied:    [    Q^D(p) = Q^S(p)    ]    Substituting the functions:    [    -2p + 12 = 2 + 8p    ] 5. **Solve for ( p )**:    [    -2p + 12 = 2 + 8p implies 12 - 2 = 10p implies 10 = 10p implies p = 1    ] 6. **Find the Equilibrium Quantity**:    Substitute ( p = 1 ) back into either the demand or supply function,    [    Q = Q^S(1) = 2 + 8 cdot 1 = 10    ]    Therefore, the equilibrium price and quantity are:    [    p^* = 1, quad Q^* = 10    ]  Part (b) 1. **Incorporate the Subsidy into the Supply Function**:    The subsidy of ( s = 1 ) per unit changes the effective price received by producers to ( p + 1 ). Hence, the new supply function is:    [    Q^S(p) = 2 + 8(p + 1) = 2 + 8p + 8 = 10 + 8p    ] 2. **Find the New Equilibrium Price**:    Setting the new supply equal to the original demand to find the new equilibrium:    [    Q^D(p) = Q^S(p)    ]    Substituting:    [    -2p + 12 = 10 + 8p    ] 3. **Solve for the New Equilibrium Price ( p )**:    [    -2p + 12 = 10 + 8p implies 12 - 10 = 10p implies 2 = 10p implies p = 0.2    ] 4. **Find the New Equilibrium Quantity**:    Substitute ( p = 0.2 ) into either demand or the adjusted supply function,    [    Q^D(0.2) = -2(0.2) + 12 = -0.4 + 12 = 11.6    ] 5. **Calculate the Increase in Quantity Sold**:    [    Delta Q = Q^{**} - Q^* = 11.6 - 10 = 1.6    ] Thus, the subsidy leads to an increase in the quantity sold by ( 1.6 ) units.

We can categorize the numbers based on the number of digits: 1. One-digit numbers: There are 3 possibilities (4, 5, 6). 2. Two-digit numbers: There are 3 possibilities for the first digit and 3 for the second digit, giving us 3 * 3 = 9 possibilities. 3. Three-digit numbers: Similarly, there are 3 possibilities for each digit, giving us 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 possibilities. 4. Four-digit numbers: There are 3 possibilities for each digit, giving us 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81 possibilities. Since we are looking for 81 such integers, it seems that we are looking for all the four-digit numbers that consist only of the digits 4, 5, and 6. The smallest four-digit number that can be formed using only these digits is 4444. To verify that 4444 is the lower limit, we can check if there are indeed 81 numbers between 4444 and 10000 that consist only of the digits 4, 5, and 6. Since each digit has 3 possibilities, and there are 4 digits, the total number of combinations is indeed 3^4 = 81.

The next smallest number that is divisible by both 8 and 12 (to satisfy the fractions given for under 21 and over 65) is 48 (since 48 is the least common multiple of 8 and 12).

To find the range of temperature change, we consider the highest and lowest temperatures recorded. The highest temperature represents the upper limit of the temperature range, and the lowest temperature represents the lower limit of the temperature range. Therefore, the range of temperature change can be represented as the interval from the lowest temperature to the highest temperature. Given that the highest temperature was 5^{circ}mathrm{C}, this means that the temperature did not exceed 5^{circ}mathrm{C}. Similarly, given that the lowest temperature was -2^{circ}mathrm{C}, this means that the temperature was not below -2^{circ}mathrm{C}. Therefore, the temperature t must satisfy the condition that it is greater than or equal to -2^{circ}mathrm{C} and less than or equal to 5^{circ}mathrm{C}. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: [ -2leqslant tleqslant 5 ] This inequality represents the range of temperature change in Suzhou City on that day, indicating that the temperature was within the interval from -2^{circ}mathrm{C} to 5^{circ}mathrm{C}.

This is because the radius drawn to a tangent point is perpendicular to the tangent.    - Therefore, points (P, B, O), and (E) lie on a circle with diameter (PB) or (PE). 3. **Finding Points Concyclic with (M)**:    - Next, note that (angle BPM = angle BEM = 30^circ). This follows as (angle BPM) lies on the same segment (overarc{BE}) subtended by tangents intersecting line (DA) at (P).    - Thus, (P, B, M, E) are also concyclic. 4. **Finding the length (PO)**:    - We calculate the length of segment (PO) using the given distances (PB = 24) and (OE = OB = 10) (since they are radii).    - Applying the Pythagorean theorem in (triangle PBO):      [      PO = sqrt{PB^2 + OB^2} = sqrt{24^2 + 10^2} = sqrt{576 + 100} = sqrt{676} = 26      ] 5. **Determining (BM)**:    - Since (P, B, O, M, E) lie on the same circle and (PO = 26) is the diameter of the circle, we use the property of a circle:      [      BM = PO cdot sin(angle BMO) = 26 cdot sin(30^circ)      ]    - Knowing (sin(30^circ) = frac{1}{2}):      [      BM = 26 cdot frac{1}{2} = 13      ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{13} ]"},{"instruction":"Set  A  consists of  2016  positive integers.

Each exponent can be either 0 or 1 modulo 2. Therefore, there are (2^{10} = 1024) possible combinations of these exponents modulo 2. 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:**    Since (2^{10} = 1024 < 2016), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two numbers (a) and (b) in (A) such that all their exponents are equivalent modulo 2.

Step 1: Calculate the probability that the product is not divisible by 2. For the product to be not divisible by 2, all four numbers rolled must be odd. Each die has three odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and three even numbers (2, 4, 6), so the probability of rolling an odd number on one die is frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}. Thus, the probability that all four dice show odd numbers is: [ left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 = frac{1}{16}. ]  Step 2: Calculate the probability that the product is divisible by 4 but not by 8. For the product to be divisible by 4 but not by 8, exactly two dice must show a number that contributes exactly one factor of 2 (i.e., the number 2), and the other two dice must show odd numbers. The probability of rolling a 2 on one die is frac{1}{6}, and the probability of rolling an odd number is frac{1}{2}. There are binom{4}{2} = 6 ways to choose which two dice show the 2.

What is the probability that P is closer to C than it is to either A or B?","output":"To determine the probability that a randomly selected point P inside triangle ABC is closer to C than to either A or B, we follow these steps: 1. **Construct the Perpendicular Bisectors**: We start by constructing the perpendicular bisector ell of segment AC. This bisector divides the plane into two regions: one containing points closer to A than to C, and the other containing points closer to C than to A. Since ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C, ell is parallel to BC. It also passes through the midpoint of AB, which we denote as D. 2. **Identify the Region Closer to C than A or B**: Similarly, we construct the perpendicular bisector m of segment BC. This bisector divides the plane into regions where points are closer to B or C. The bisector m also passes through D, the midpoint of AB. 3. **Determine the Intersection Region**: The points that are closer to C than to both A and B lie in the intersection of the regions defined by ell and m. This intersection forms a shaded rectangle. 4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that a randomly selected point P is closer to C than to A or B is the ratio of the area of the shaded rectangle to the area of triangle ABC.     - **Area of the Rectangle**: The sides of the rectangle are frac{3}{2} and frac{4}{2}, so its area is frac{3}{2} times frac{4}{2} = frac{3 cdot 4}{2 cdot 2} = frac{6}{2} = 3.    - **Area of Triangle ABC**: The area of triangle ABC is frac{1}{2} times 3 times 4 = frac{3 cdot 4}{2} = 6. 5. **Compute the Ratio**: The probability is therefore the ratio of the rectangle's area to the triangle's area, which is frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}.

We know that the area (A) of a rectangle is given by the formula A = L * W, and the perimeter (P) is given by P = 2L + 2W. We are given that A = 120 square feet and P = 46 feet. So we have two equations: 1) L * W = 120 2) 2L + 2W = 46 We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2: L + W = 23 Now we need to express one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for W from the second equation: W = 23 - L Now we can substitute this expression for W into the first equation: L * (23 - L) = 120 Expanding this, we get: 23L - L^2 = 120 Rearranging the terms to set the equation to 0, we get: L^2 - 23L + 120 = 0 This is a quadratic equation, and we can factor it: (L - 8)(L - 15) = 0 So, L = 8 or L = 15. Since we are looking for the length of the shorter sides, we need to determine which of these is the width (the shorter side). If L = 8, then W = 23 - 8 = 15. If L = 15, then W = 23 - 15 = 8.

Therefore, machine P takes T + 10 hours to produce the same number of sprockets. Let's denote the number of sprockets machine A produces per hour as A sprockets/hour. Since machine Q produces 10% more sprockets per hour than machine A, machine Q produces A + 0.1A = 1.1A sprockets/hour. Now, we can set up equations based on the production rates of the machines: For machine P (which takes T + 10 hours): 440 sprockets = (T + 10) * A sprockets/hour For machine Q (which takes T hours): 440 sprockets = T * 1.1A sprockets/hour Now we can solve for T in terms of A from the equation for machine Q: T = 440 / (1.1A) Substitute this value of T into the equation for machine P: 440 = (440 / (1.1A) + 10) * A Now, let's solve for A: 440 = (400 / A + 10) * A 440 = 400 + 10A 10A = 440 - 400 10A = 40 A = 40 / 10 A = 4 sprockets/hour Therefore, machine A produces boxed{4}  sprockets per hour."},{"instruction":"Tom is cutting a piece of wood to make a shelf.

To have exactly 4 roots in the interval [0, 2omega pi], the interval must accommodate exactly 4 periods of 2pi, but not start a fifth period.

This is because the parabola opens downwards (since a is negative), and the inequality is satisfied for values of x between the roots of the corresponding equation. The roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + 2ax + 2 - 3a = 0 can be found using the formula for the sum and product of roots of a quadratic equation: - The sum of roots, x_1 + x_2 = -frac{2a}{a} = -2. - The product of roots, x_1x_2 = frac{2 - 3a}{a} = frac{2}{a} - 3 < -3 (since a < 0). From the sum of roots, we have: [x_1 + x_2 + 2 = 0] And from the product of roots, we have: [x_1x_2 + 3 < 0] Therefore, options A and D are correct.

Now, B uses Color 2 which forces C and F to use Color 3 and Color 1 respectively. 3. C uses Color 3, making D to use Color 2. 4. Similarly, E uses Color 3 results in F using Color 1, which forces I to use Color 2. 5. Continuing this pattern will allow us to complete the grid, taking care at each step to avoid color repetition with adjacent squares.

Evaluate Xiao Lu's statements:    - Xiao Lu says: \\"It is less than 7, and it is a two-digit number.\\"    - If both of Xiao Lu's statements were true:        - We need to find a number that is less than 7 and a two-digit number, which is a contradiction, thus Xiao Lu’s both statements cannot be true.    - If both of Xiao Lu's statements were false:        - This means the number is 7 or greater and not a two-digit number.    - If one of Xiao Lu’s statements were true:        - If the number is greater than or equal to 7, and if the number is or is not a two-digit, one of those should be consistent with other findings. 4. Evaluate Xiao Dai's statements:    - Xiao Dai says: \\"The first half of Xiao Qian's statement is true, but the second half is false.\\"    - If Xiao Dai’s both statements were true:        - This implies Xiao Qian is partly right, indicating it is a perfect square but not less than 5.    - If Xiao Dai’s both statements were false:        - This implies none of Xiao Qian's statements can be evaluated correctly, thus making more complex contradictions.    - If one of Xiao Dai's statements is true and one is false:        - Either the number is considered perfect square while testing or non-perfect square, generalizing to find correct statements consistency. 5. Based on analysis:    - Xiao Qian’s first statement is true (it is a perfect square), but the second is false (not less than 5).    - Xiao Lu’s statements are false because combining results with consistency results in conflict (number is two-digit but less than 7).    - Xiao Dai claims Xiao Qian true first half about perfect square form is correct. From the possible complete perfect squares, evaluable from 1 to 99 = (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81), only one fits two-digit less than 7 properties (12) Finally, we find the correct numbers greater or equal 7 form: - List consistent checks for derived perfect square elements: [9 text{ (As among 1 to 99 sequence both elementary less than 7 and more than comparative numbers fit specific criteria multiple checks)} Conclusion, we derive: boxed{9}"},{"instruction":"Let ( n ) be a positive integer and ( a ) be an integer such that ( a ) is its own inverse modulo ( n ).

We know that ( T = 40 ). The gambler plans to play 80 more games, and he expects to win 70% of these games. So, the number of games he will win in the future is ( 0.70 times 80 ). The gambler wants to end up winning 60% of all his games for the week. The total number of games he will have played by the end of the week will be ( T + 80 = 40 + 80 = 120 ). Therefore, the total number of games he wants to win by the end of the week is ( 0.60 times 120 ).

In Pascal's Triangle, the nth row (starting from n=0) has entries that are binomial coefficients: binom{n}{k}, where 0 leq k leq n. Recall that a prime number p appears in Pascal's Triangle starting from the pth row, specifically binom{p}{1} = p and binom{p}{p-1} = p, because the factorial of a number less than a prime p will not include p as a factor, and thus these binomial coefficients are individual entries of p. We further consider whether 47 can appear in any other row beyond the 47th row. Since 47 is prime, any row number less than 47 will surely not have 47 as a binomial coefficient because the factorial in the denominator of binom{n}{k} would not yet be divisible by 47. In rows greater than 47, 47 can appear as a binomial coefficient only if it can be expressed as a product of binomial coefficients involving numbers whose factorials include 47, which isn't possible for factors below 47. Hence, rows after 47 will not have 47 as an entry either, since any coefficient greater than 47 that involves 47 would have to be part of a factorial product that surpasses 47.

Join the point (O) with each vertex of the pentagon by line segments (OA, OB, OC, OD,) and (OE). This divides the pentagon into five triangles. 3. Given that these five triangles are equal in area and are not isosceles, we need to prove that these triangles are right-angled. 4. Denote the lengths of the segments by ( OA = a), ( OB = b), ( OC = c), ( OD = d), and ( OE = e).   Proof: - We know that no two consecutive segments among (a, b, c, d, e) are equal (otherwise, the triangle would be isosceles). - Suppose temporarily that there do not exist three consecutive segments of distinct lengths among (a, b, c, d,) and (e). This assumption leads us into a contradiction:   - If only two distinct lengths existed among any three consecutive segments, we might have, say, (a, b, a, b, a). However, this repetition pattern cannot hold as there are five segments (an odd number) hence violating the given condition of the problem. Thus, three consecutive segments (OD, OE,) and (OA) must have distinct lengths.    5.

Vladimir can move stones from one box to another if the sum of the stones in these boxes is 101. Will he be able to achieve having 69 stones in the seventieth box, 51 stones in the fiftieth box, while the remaining boxes retain their original number of stones?","output":"1. Let's start by considering the initial arrangement of stones in the 100 boxes. The first box has 1 stone, the second box has 2 stones, and so forth, up to the 100th box which has 100 stones.  2. Note that Vladimir can move stones between any two boxes if the total number of stones in those two boxes is 101. 3. We need to determine if it is possible for the 70th box to contain 69 stones, the 50th box to contain 51 stones, and all the other boxes remaining unchanged. 4. Initially, we observe that there are 50 boxes with even numbers and 50 boxes with odd numbers of stones. The sum of stones in any two boxes that Vladimir can choose to swap must be 101, meaning he can only swap stones between an even-numbered box and an odd-numbered box. 5. Let's analyze the specifics:    - The 70th box (even-numbered) initially has 70 stones.    - The 50th box (even-numbered) initially has 50 stones.    - To achieve the desired configuration, the 70th box needs its count to change to 69 (an odd number), and the 50th box to 51 (an odd number). 6. If both the 70th and 50th boxes are to change to contain odd numbers of stones (69 and 51 respectively), then irrespective of which operations are used, they must communicate stones with odd-numbered boxes to maintain the parity conditions originating from how the operations are structured. 7. Furthermore:    - After the transfer of stones, at the completion, there should still be an even number of boxes containing even numbers of stones, but implementing the desired move will disrupt this balance as demonstrated: 8. If we swap stones such that the 50th and 70th boxes change to 51 and 69 respectively:    - Before: 50 boxes have even numbers of stones    - If the desired move is made, then:      - We need both previously even-numbered boxes (70th and 50th) to now contain odd numbers (69 and 51).      - This swap changes the count of boxes with even numbers by two (both flip to odd), decreasing from 50 even numbered boxes to 48.       9. Thus this condition fails as:    - When Vladimir finishes moving stones, the parity condition, required to maintain an equal operational outcome, fails. 10. Hence it is impossible to have both the 70th box contain exactly 69 stones and the 50th box exactly 51 stones while keeping the rest unchanged. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{No, it is impossible.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that {b_n} is a geometric sequence, and b_5=2, then b_1cdot b_2cdot b_3cdot b_4cdot b_5cdot b_6cdot b_7cdot b_8cdot b_9=2^9.

Simplifying this equation: y - 1 = frac{1}{e}x - 1, y = frac{1}{e}x. The tangent line needs to pass through the point (e, 1), so plugging this point into the equation to solve for the y-intercept, we find that: 1 = frac{1}{e}e = 1.

Find all possible values of varphi.","output":"1. Consider a pentagonal prism, where each lateral face is a parallelogram. This is based on the given problem that talks about a pentagonal prism and the angles of its lateral faces.     2. Let’s first analyze the simpler case where the pentagonal prism is a right prism. In a right prism, each lateral face is a rectangle. The angles between the edges of these rectangular faces and the base of the prism are right angles (90^circ).    Therefore, if we consider the lateral face of a right pentagonal prism, (varphi = 90^circ) is a valid angle since the lateral edges are perpendicular to the base. 3. Now suppose (varphi neq 90^circ). This implies the lateral faces are not rectangles but parallelograms with acute and obtuse angles. The angle (varphi) in a parallelogram is such that one angle is acute (( < 90^circ )) and the opposite angle is obtuse (( > 90^circ )). However, each lateral face must connect properly with the pentagonal base. 4. Consider the following geometric argument:    - Draw a line in the plane of the base parallel to every edge of the base from one of its vertices (V). These lines must make the angle (varphi) with the lateral edge (r) emerging from (V). The idea is to see if this angle configuration can repeat uniquely around the pentagonal base. 5. However, in the same plane, due to the constraints of a parallelogram, we can have at most two different directions (angles) for the edges forming the base. This means we can only form proper parallelograms if there are only two distinct angles (one acute and one obtuse) constantly repeated. 6. For a pentagon, repeating this configuration in a way that fulfills a perfect closure of the base (while arranging the angles (varphi) around it in an alternating and consistent manner) becomes impossible without ending up in contradictions. Specifically, given there are three different directions for the corners of a pentagon, one direction would repeat which violates the initial constraint of having unique directions. 7. Thus, considering the above contradictions, we see that a pentagonal prism must revert to having each lateral face as a rectangle to maintain geometric consistency without contradictions. 8.

Comparing this to our function, we can see that h=1 and k=2. Therefore, the coordinates of the vertex are (1,2), not (-1,2). This eliminates option A. 2. **Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry for a quadratic function in vertex form y=a(x-h)^2+k is the line x=h. For our function, h=1, so the axis of symmetry is the line x=1.

When x=1, y indeed has a minimum value of 2, not a maximum as stated in option C. 4. **Behavior of y when xgeqslant 1**: For a parabola that opens upwards (since a=3>0), as x increases from the axis of symmetry, y also increases.

We need to prove that the teacher can always give the new book to one of the students such that it will be passed to all other students.  Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Existence of a Chain:**    - Since each student has at least 3 friends, we can construct a chain of friends starting from any student.    - Let us pick any student and label them as student (1). Let's denote one of their friends as student (2).    - Since student (2) has at least 3 friends and one of these friends (student (2)) is not student (1), we can choose another friend of student (2) and label them as student (3). 2. **Constructing the Chain:**    - Continue this process, selecting new friends such that no friend is repeated within the current portion of the chain.     - This can be done as long as there are additional friends who have not been chosen previously. 3. **Chain Length Considerations:**    - Continue this process until we either include all students or we find some students who are not in the chain. 4. **Ensuring the Chain Covers All Students:**    - Assume that our chain only contains some subset of the 6 students. Suppose it contains only 4 students initially.    - Consider a student (N) who is not in the chain. (N) must have at least 3 friends.    - Verify if (N) is friends with any of the students at either end of the chain.    - Since (N) has 3 friends, if (N) is not friends with the first or last student in the current chain, then (N) must be friends with someone in the middle of the chain. 5. **Adjusting the Chain:**    - If (N) is friends with more students in the chain, expand the chain by bringing (N) into consideration.    - This way, by iterating, we can ensure (N) fits into the chain without breaking the current chain's integrity. 6. **Proving the Full Chain:**    - If our chain initially contains 5 nodes (with (5) students), consider the remaining student (say (E)).    - If (E) is friends with the first or last student of the chain, then (E) is connected, forming a chain of 6.    - Otherwise, (E) must be friends with students in the middle, allowing us to extend the chain in both directions. 7. **Cycle and Contradiction:**    - Any further extension of the chain would mean all nodes are interconnected. Given that each node has at least 3 friends, they must interconnect to avoid any node being isolated beyond having 3 friends.    - Thus, trying to disconnect any will lead back across the chain or forming a minimal cycle, allowing the book to be passed through every student.  Conclusion: By above construction and chain adjustments, we ensure all students will be part of a single chain where the book can be passed to each one. Hence, the teacher can always give the new book to any one student, ensuring it will be read by all 6 students.

Thus ( P notin mathbb{Z} ), which is a contradiction.        - If ( P = 1 ):      [      x^3 - y = 1 + xy implies x^3 - 1 = y(x + 1) implies (x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) - 2 = y(x + 1)      ]      Therefore, ( x + 1 ) must divide 2.

The probability that the distance from P to at least one of the vertices is less than 1 is _________.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the area within the triangle ABC where the distance from any point to at least one of the vertices is less than 1. Let's label the vertices of the equilateral triangle ABC as A, B, and C. Because the side length of triangle ABC is 2, we can draw three circles with radius 1 centered at each vertex. The intersection of these three circles within the triangle will define the regions where the distance from any point within those regions to the respective vertex is less than 1. However, these circles may overlap. To find the non-overlapping regions where the distance to any vertex is less than 1, we take note that in an equilateral triangle, the points that are equidistant to all three vertices lie in the center of the triangle, the centroid. This point is also the center of the incircle, which is tangent to all three sides. The radius of the incircle, r, is given by formula r = frac{ssqrt{3}}{6}, where s is the side length of the equilateral triangle. In this case, s=2 so r = frac{2sqrt{3}}{6} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. Since the inradius is less than 1, the entire area inside the incircle will be a region where any point is less than 1 unit away from each vertex. To find the probability, we will need the area of the equilateral triangle, which can be found using the formula A_{text{triangle}} = frac{s^2sqrt{3}}{4} and the area of the incircle, which is pi r^2. For our triangle, A_{text{triangle}} = frac{(2)^2sqrt{3}}{4} = sqrt{3}. Now we need to calculate how much area from the regions within circles centered at the vertices falls outside the incircle. This is the area that needs to be excluded from the total probability. The key is to realize that the segments connecting the points of tangency of the incircle with the vertices divide the triangle into three smaller congruent triangles, which are 30-60-90 right triangles. The area of one such triangle is frac{1}{3} of the area of the incircle's interior. So, three of them would exactly cover the whole incircle. Thus, no additional area needs to be excluded. Therefore, the probability that the distance from P to at least one of the triangle's vertices is less than 1 is equal to the area of the incircle divided by the total area. The area of the incircle is thus pi left(frac{sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2 = frac{pi}{3}. Finally, our probability is: P = frac{frac{pi}{3}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{pi}{3sqrt{3}}.  We can simplify further by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt{3} to remove the radical from the denominator:  P = frac{pisqrt{3}}{9}.  Hence, the probability that the distance from P to at least one of the vertices is less than 1 is boxed{frac{pisqrt{3}}{9}}."},{"instruction":"The numbers (a, b,) and (c) are such that ((a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = abc) and ((a^3 + b^3)(b^3 + c^3)(c^3 + a^3) = a^3 b^3 c^3).

Given that d_{text{near}} = 1 and d_{text{far}} = 7, we can use these distances to find the diameter of the circle. The key insight here is that the sum of these distances equals the diameter of the circle. This is because the diameter extends from one side of the circle, through its center, to the opposite side. When a point is inside the circle, the shortest distance to the circle is directly outward to the nearest point on the circumference, and the longest distance is across the diameter to the farthest point on the circumference.

This gives us:     [     overline{CS} = overline{CB} quad text{and} quad angle CDB = angle SDC = angle EDC     ]     Since overline{CB} and overline{CE} are equal-length chords subtending equal central angles at D, we can infer that:     [     overline{CS} = overline{CB} = overline{CE}     ]     Therefore, triangle CSE is isosceles with overline{CS} = overline{CE}. This establishes the existence of a circle k_1 with center C containing points E, S, and B. 2. **Prove that angle SCE = 60^circ**     Consider the isosceles triangle ESA with base ES. It is similar to the isosceles triangle BSD with base BS because:     [     angle SEA = angle DEA = angle DBA = angle DBS quad text{and} quad angle EAS = angle EAB = angle EDB = angle SDB     ]     According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, this similarity translates into equal arcs:     [     overline{AE} = overline{AS} = r quadtext{(given)}     ]          Consequently, the length of chord AE is equal to the circle radius r, thus the central angle corresponding to arc AE is angle AOE = 60^circ because:     [     text{Central angle} = 2 times text{Inscribed angle (arc-subtended angle)}     ]     Now considering the inscribed angle corresponding to arc AEB:     [     angle ABE = 30^circ quad (text{Half of } 60^circ text{ central angle})     ]     Therefore:     [     angle SBE = angle ABE = 30^circ     ]          This is also an inscribed angle in k_1 subtending segment SE. Thus:     [     angle SCE = 2 times 30^circ = 60^circ     ]     Since overline{CS} = overline{CE} and angle SCE = 60^circ, triangle CSE must be equilateral. # Conclusion [ boxed{text{CSE is equilateral}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given log_a 2 = m and log_a 3 = n, find the value of a^{2m+n}.

To demonstrate this, let's consider the reverse process: starting with several single-stone heaps, repeatedly combine two heaps until only one remains, ensuring the similarity condition is preserved. 1. **Initial Setup**: Assume initially we have n heaps, each containing a single stone. Every heap is of size 1. 2. **Combination Process**: We will iteratively combine the two smallest heaps into one larger heap.  3. **Heap Combination Rule**: Suppose we are combining two heaps of sizes x and y with x leq y. The new combined heap will have size x + y. 4. **Check Size Similarity**: The condition that the new heap size must be similar to the larger of the two combined heaps means:    [    x + y leq 2y    ]    This inequality always holds since x leq y by definition. Therefore, the new heap's size is always at most double the size of the largest heap involved in the combination. 5. **Iterative Process**: Continue this combination process until only one heap remains. Given that each combination step adheres to the size similarity condition, this ensures that at no point do the heaps differ by more than a factor of two. 6. **Final Heap Size**: If the combining process starts with n heaps each of size 1, and in each step two heaps are merged, each combination step reduces the total number of heaps by one:    [    text{Number of steps} = n - 1    ]    After n - 1 steps, we have one heap of size n. Hence, starting from n single-stone heaps, it is possible to form one heap of size n by combining heaps in a manner that ensures all intermediate steps produce heaps that differ in size by no more than a factor of two. This proves that any initial collection of stones can indeed be split into heaps differing by no more than a factor of two. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Find all values of the real number a so that the four complex roots of [ z^4  8z^3 + 13az^2  3(3a^2  2a  5)z + 4 = 0 ] form vertices of either a parallelogram or a rectangle in the complex plane.","output":"First, by Vieta’s formulas, the average of the sum of the roots is frac{8}{4} = 2, which matches the center of the likely geometrical figure (parallelogram or rectangle).

Now, let's analyze the options given: A: The events \\"exactly one head\\" and \\"exactly two heads\\" can both not happen if we get two tails. Thus, they are not mutually exclusive, and option A is incorrect. B: The event \\"at least one head\\" includes the possibility of getting exactly one head. Therefore, these two events can occur simultaneously, which means they are not mutually exclusive. So, option B is incorrect. C: The events \\"at least two heads\\" and \\"exactly one head\\" can both not happen if we get two tails or two heads. Therefore, they are not mutually exclusive, making option C incorrect. D: The event \\"at most one head\\" implies that we could have zero or one head, while \\"exactly two heads\\" requires two heads. These cannot happen simultaneously (if you have two heads, you cannot simultaneously have at most one head), nor can they both not occur together (if there are not exactly two heads, then there are at most one head).

To solve the problem, let's analyze the following points: 1. **Sum Range Calculation**:    The possible sums of the numbers at the ends of the edges can range from:        1 + 2 = 3 quad text{to} quad 7 + 8 = 15        Thus, the sums can take any integer value between 3 and 15, inclusive. This gives us 13 possible values for the sums. 2. **Initial Condition**:    Assume among the sums, there are the following values:        1 + 2 = 3, quad 1 + 3 = 4, quad 1 + 4 = 5     3. **Exploring Potential Sums**:    If 3 sums are taken as 3, 4, and 5, then the sum 6 should be checked for feasibility. The possible pairs of numbers contributing to the sum 6 are 1+5, 2+4. However,    - The sum (1 + 5) cannot be used because 1 and 5 are not at the ends of the same edge.    - The sum (2 + 4) cannot be used for the same reason.    Hence, it is impossible to have a sum equal to 6 based on the assumption above. 4. **Further Verification**:    Analogously, we investigate the highest sums:    - Consider sums among 12, 13, 14, and 15. Assume, these are some sums:            7 + 8 = 15, quad 6 + 8 = 14, quad 5 + 8 = 13            If these sums are taken, the sum 12 must be considered. The possible pairs for the sum 12 are 4 + 8, 5 + 7, 6 + 6.      - (4+8) and (5+7) cannot be used due to the same type of contradiction as above.            This reveals similar constraints for higher sums. 5. **Edge Count vs. Unique Sums**:    Each different edge of the cube must have a unique sum. Since the cube has 12 edges but we can achieve at most 11 distinct sums (as demonstrated above), it is impossible to number the vertices of the cube such that each sum is unique across all edges. # Conclusion Therefore, it is not possible to number the vertices of a cube with natural numbers from 1 to 8 such that the sums at the ends of each edge are distinct. boxed{text{No}}"},{"instruction":"Jenna catches an eel that's a certain fraction as long as Bill's.

Specifically:    - If (a) and (b) are both odd or both even, both their sum and their difference are even.    - If one number is odd and the other is even, both their sum and their difference are odd.        Consequently, the parity (oddness or evenness) of the total sum of the numbers remains invariant during the process. 3. **Parity Condition for the Total Sum:**    Calculate the parity of the initial sum of the sequence:    - If ( n ) is even, the sequence consists of an equal number of odd and even numbers, resulting in an even total sum.    - If ( n ) is odd, the sequence consists of one more odd number than even numbers, resulting in an odd total sum.    For the final number to be 0, the total sum must be even. Hence, ( n ) must be even. 4. **Grouping into Categories:**    Based on the characteristics of the numbers:    - **When ( n mod 4 = 0 ):** All numbers of the sequence will get replaced by pairs of differences that ultimately sum up to 0.     - **When ( n mod 4 = 1 ) or ( n mod 4 = 2):** The final number's parity will be odd due to invariant parity discussed earlier, thus it cannot be zero.    - **When ( n mod 4 = 3 ):** After several replacements if the initial sum was sufficiently large (i.e., ( n geq 4047)), reductions result in repeated ones until reaching zero. 5. **Detailed Process Description (for ( n mod 4 = 0 )):**    - The largest two numbers are consecutively replaced by their difference, which is 1.    - This continues until all numbers are either eliminated or replaced by 1,    - If ( n ) is a multiple of 4, the results reduce evenly to zero. 6. **Detailed Process (for ( n mod 4 = 3 ) and ( n geq 4047 )):**    - Each of the replacements due to parity invariance introduces ones until reductions are complete.    - Numbers diminish steadily, resulting in zero eventually.  7. **Final Conclusion:**    We unite the results.

Let I_A, I_B, I_C be the excenters opposite A, B, C, and let M_A be the midpoint of BC. 2. **Quadrilateral Properties**:    From the problem statement, the quadrilateral BC_{1}B_{1}C is circumscribed about (omega) and inscribed in a circle with diameter BC. Thus, BC_{1}B_{1}C is both tangential and cyclic. 3. **Properties of Circumcircle and Incircle**:    In such a quadrilateral, the intersection of the diagonals lies on the line joining the centers of the incircle and circumcircle. This implies that H, I, and M_A are collinear. 4. **Establishing Relationships**:    To show that r = 2OM_A, consider the transformation involving a dilation that respects the given tangent properties.    - Let A_3 be the point on omega diametrically opposite A'. According to properties of tangential quadrilaterals, points A, A_3, and A_2 lie on a single line.    - Given that M_A is the midpoint of A_2A', the line IM_A becomes the midline in triangle A_2A'A_3.     - As a consequence, H I parallel A A_3, forming a parallelogram AA_3IH and thus r = A_3I = AH = 2 O M_A. 5. **Verification with Similar Triangles**:    Through an alternative approach, verify this using similarity. Designate T as the tangency point of the excircle omega_A with side AB.    - Under transformation (similarity), omega corresponds to omega_A. Therefore, T B'perp A C and passes through I.    - Considering angle T I C' = angle A = angle C O M_A, the right triangles T I C'  and  C O M_A are similar.    - Since T C' = T B + B C' = BC + CA = 2CM_A due to length properties, the similarity ratio is 2:1. Hence, O M_A = frac{1}{2}I C' = frac{r}{2}. 6. **Symmetry Properties**:    Thus, the segment M_A O is the midline of triangle IA' A_2, meaning it passes through A_2 and is parallel to IA'.

Consider a rational number with a denominator at most ( n ). Let this rational number be ( frac{p}{q} ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are integers, ( q leq n ), and ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ). 2. We can rescale every such rational number such that their denominators are greater than ( frac{n}{2} ) but still at most ( n ). This can be achieved by multiplying both numerator and denominator by some power of 2, if necessary. 3. A key observation is that two distinct rational numbers ( frac{p_1}{q} ) and ( frac{p_2}{q} ) with the same denominator ( q ) must differ by at least ( frac{1}{q} ). If both ( frac{p_1}{q} ) and ( frac{p_2}{q} ) lie in the same interval of length ( frac{1}{n} ), their difference must hence be less than ( frac{1}{n} ). But ( frac{1}{q} geq frac{1}{n} ), so they cannot lie in the same interval, ensuring that at most one rational number with denominator ( q leq n ) can lie in any interval of length ( frac{1}{n} ). 4. Now we count the possible denominators ( q ) which are greater than ( frac{n}{2} ) but less than or equal to ( n ). This count corresponds to the number of integers from ( leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1 ) to ( n ).    The count of such integers is:    [    n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor    ] 5.

Therefore, whether ( n ) is even or odd, the number of denominators ( q ) for which ( frac{n}{2} < q leq n ) is always ( leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2} rightrfloor ). 7.

Analysis: To find the equation of the tangent line at the point (-1,3), it is only necessary to find the value of its slope. Therefore, first use the derivative to find the value of the derivative function at x=-1, and then combine the geometric meaning of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line.

Find the value of m.","output":"# Solution  Part 1: Proving the equation always has real roots Given the quadratic equation x^{2}+left(m-2right)x+m-3=0, we need to examine the discriminant Delta to determine the nature of its roots. The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^{2} + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^{2} - 4ac. For our equation, a = 1, b = m - 2, and c = m - 3. Thus, we calculate Delta as follows: [ Delta = (m-2)^{2} - 4(1)(m-3) = m^{2} - 4m + 4 - 4m + 12 = m^{2} - 8m + 16 = (m-4)^{2} ] Since (m-4)^{2} geq 0 for all real values of m, it follows that Delta geq 0. This implies that the quadratic equation always has real roots, regardless of the value of m.  Part 2: Finding the value of m Given that x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the equation, by Vieta's formulas, we have: - x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{b}{a} = -frac{m-2}{1} = -(m-2) Given also that 2x_{1} + x_{2} = m + 1, we can express x_{1} in terms of m: [ 2x_{1} + x_{2} = m + 1 implies 2x_{1} + (x_{1} + x_{2}) = 2x_{1} - (m-2) = m + 1 ] Solving for x_{1}, we get: [ x_{1} = 2m - 1 ] Substituting x_{1} = 2m - 1 into the original equation, we have: [ (2m-1)^{2} + (m-2)(2m-1) + m - 3 = 0 ] Expanding and simplifying, we get: [ 4m^{2} - 4m + 1 + 2m^{2} - 5m + 2 + m - 3 = 0 implies 6m^{2} - 8m = 0 ] Factoring out 2m, we have: [ 2m(3m - 4) = 0 ] Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible values of m: [ 2m = 0 implies m = 0 ] [ 3m - 4 = 0 implies m = frac{4}{3} ] Therefore, the values of m that satisfy the given conditions are m = 0 and m = frac{4}{3}.

Using the properties of quaternions where ( i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 ), (-i = -i), (-j = -j), (-k = -k), and ( kij = -1 ), we simplify the expansion to: [ a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - d^2 + 2ab(i) + 2ac(j) + 2ad(k) + 2bcd(-1) = -1 - i - j - k. ] Comparing terms gives the equations: [ begin{align*} a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - d^2 - 2bcd &= -1,  2ab &= -1,  2ac &= -1,  2ad &= -1.  end{align*} ] Solving these equations, we set ( b = c = d ) for simplicity. With ( 2ab = -1 ), assume ( b = frac{1}{2} ), thus ( a = -1 ) (by matching the signs).

Thus, ( a = -1 ) and ( b = c = d = frac{1}{2} ) satisfying ( q = -1 + frac{i}{2} + frac{j}{2} + frac{k}{2} ) does not hold due to the quadratic norm condition.

Hence, A and B do not have any direct mutual acquaintanceship. 2. **Finding Mutual Acquaintances of B**:    - Let C be a member who knows B. 3. **Analyzing Acquaintances of C**:    - Since C cannot know more people than A, regardless of whether A and C know each other or not, A will have at least as many acquaintances as C.    - Notice that C knows B, who A does not know.  4. **Ensuring Distinct Acquaintances**:    - Therefore, A must have an acquaintance D, different from C, who C does not know. This is due to the fact that A has at least as many acquaintances as C. 5. **Seating Arrangement**:    - Now, consider seating A, B, C, and D around the table in this order. Note that in this arrangement:      - A knows D but not B and C.      - B only knows C.      - C only knows B.      - D only knows A.    This meets the required condition that each member knows exactly one of their two table neighbors. Therefore, for four suitably chosen members A, B, C, D, we can seat them around a table such that each member knows exactly one of their two neighbors. So we have: [ boxed{A, B, C, D} ] # 2: 1. **Graph Representation**:    - Construct a graph G where each vertex represents a member of the society.     - There is a green edge between two vertices if the corresponding members know each other.     - There is a red edge between two vertices if they do not know each other.    - Each vertex in the graph has at least one green and one red edge by the problem's conditions. 2. **Transforming the Problem**:    - The problem translates into finding a four-cycle in G where opposite edges (diagonally) in this cycle are of different colors.    - This type of cycle is called a \\"tarka négyszög\\" in Hungarian, or a \\"bichromatic quadrilateral\\" in English. 3. **Induction on n**:    - Base Case: For n=1, prove trivial since the assumption of acquaintance constraints is impossible.    - Assume that the statement holds for up to n-1 members.    - Consider an n-vertex graph G:      - Select a vertex A. Remove A and examine the graph G - A. 4. **Inductive Step**:    - If every vertex in G-A retains both red and green edges, the induction hypothesis guarantees a bichromatic quadrilateral in G-A, which is also a bichromatic quadrilateral in G.    - Suppose G-A does not have such vertices; take vertex B so all edges from B are red (except for A which is green). 5. **Analysis of Edge Colors**:    - If G-B does not contain a bichromatic quadrilateral, induction says there must be another vertex in G-B connected by edges of all one color.    - Depending on this second vertex being A or not, construct the quadrilateral using combination colors of edges among A, B, and other vertices. 6. **Verification and Conclusion**:    - Construct relevantly, quadrilateral combinations of A, B, and other required vertices lead to a bichromatic quadrilateral.    - Hence, induction proves it ultimately for n. Therefore, by induction, there exists a bichromatic quadrilateral for any n-vertex society satisfying the original condition.

When characters are repeated in permutations, the total number must be divided by the factorial of the number of times each character is repeated. For 'l' and 'o', this would be 2! for each.

If Q = varnothing, the equation ax + 1 = 0 does not need to be solved for x, as there are no elements in Q.

We cut off the lines at their intersection points with omega and move everyone to these intersection points. This transformation does not change the nature of the problem. 2. **Define sources and sinks.**    - Refer to the non-sink endpoint of each segment as a *source*. It is clear that, starting from any source, our present cannot end up stuck in a cycle, since by inspection our present could never have entered this cycle to begin with. 3. **Track the paths of presents.**    - Suppose we place a present at every source and move the presents as described, tracking each present's path until it eventually ends up at a sink. These paths never intersect, implying that two presents from different sources must end up at different sinks. 4. **Analyze the chord overline{TF}.**    - Let Tony stand at point T. We claim that Tony cannot send a present to any endpoint F such that chord overline{TF} cuts the circumference of omega into two arcs each containing an odd number of endpoints (including neither T nor F).     - Suppose this was possible for some fixed choice of sources/sinks; evidently T is a source and F is a sink. Then because each arc has an odd number of points, one of the two arcs produced by the cut must have strictly more sources than sinks. Therefore, there exists a source where a present starting from it must end up in a sink in the other arc, but then it clearly must cross the path of the present moving from T to F, which is a contradiction. 5. **Show that Tony can send a present to an endpoint F if chord overline{TF} cuts the circumference of omega into two regions each containing an even number of endpoints.**    - Fix a choice of F. There exists some chord overline{AB} of omega (not passing through any endpoint) that cuts the circumference of omega into two arcs, each containing an even number of endpoints. Label the endpoints P_1, ldots, P_n, Q_n, ldots, Q_1 in counterclockwise order starting from A, such that T = P_k and F = Q_k for some k. 6. **Ensure every P_i is connected to some unique Q_j.**    - Suppose there exist i_1, i_2 such that overline{P_{i_1}P_{i_2}} is present as a segment. Then because there are not enough remaining points on the \\"P arc\\" of overline{AB} to pair with every point on the \\"Q arc\\", there must exist j_1, j_2 such that overline{Q_{j_1}Q_{j_2}} is also present as a segment. But then these segments don't intersect, contradicting the definition of omega. Hence every P_i is connected to some (unique) Q_j. 7. **Select sources and sinks.**    - Select every P_i as a source and every Q_i as a sink. If we place a present at each P_i, the presents eventually end up at all of the Q_j. Since present paths do not intersect, the present starting at P_i must end up at Q_i for all i. The existence of some i_1 > j_1 (resp. i_1 < j_1) such that the present at P_{i_1} ends up at Q_{j_1} implies (by Pigeonhole Principle) the existence of some i_2 < i_1 and j_2 > j_1 (resp. i_2 > i_1 and j_2 < j_1) such that the present at P_{i_2} ends up at Q_{j_2}, but then their paths intersect, which is a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion.**    - Thus, the present starting at T = P_k ends at F = Q_k, as desired. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Find the domains of the following functions: 1.

For example, the first few nonsquare integers are (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, ldots).    - For any positive integer (n), the number of perfect squares less than or equal to (n) is (lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor). 2. **Formulating (f(n)):**    - The (n)-th positive nonsquare integer (f(n)) can be thought of as the (n)-th integer after skipping all perfect squares up to (n).    - Therefore, (f(n)) should be (n) plus the number of perfect squares less than or equal to (n), which is (lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor). 3. **Analyzing the Cases:**    - Let (k) be the largest integer such that (k^2 leq n). This means (k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor).    - Consider the interval (k^2 leq n < (k+1)^2). 4. **Case 1: (k^2 leq n leq k^2 + k):**    - In this range, (n) is closer to (k^2) than to ((k+1)^2).    - The number of perfect squares up to (n) is (k), so (f(n) = n + k).    - Since (n) is closer to (k^2), ({sqrt{n}} = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor = k).    - Thus, (f(n) = n + {sqrt{n}}). 5. **Case 2: (k^2 + k + 1 leq n < (k+1)^2):**    - In this range, (n) is closer to ((k+1)^2) than to (k^2).    - The number of perfect squares up to (n) is (k + 1), so (f(n) = n + (k + 1)).    - Since (n) is closer to ((k+1)^2), ({sqrt{n}} = lceil sqrt{n} rceil = k + 1).    - Thus, (f(n) = n + {sqrt{n}}). 6. **Combining the Cases:**    - In both cases, we have shown that (f(n) = n + {sqrt{n}}).    - Therefore, the formula (f(n) = n + {sqrt{n}}) holds for all positive integers (n).

Since dividing any non-zero number by itself yields 1, we have: [a^{②} = a div a = 1] This confirms that statement ① is correct. **Statement ②: The 3rd division power of any non-zero number is equal to its reciprocal.**   For any non-zero number a, the 3rd division power is defined as a^{③}=adiv adiv a. This can be interpreted as dividing 1 (the result of adiv a) by a, which gives the reciprocal of a: [a^{③} = a div a div a = frac{1}{a}] Thus, statement ② is also correct. **Statement ③: 3^{⑥}=6^{③}.**   To verify this statement, we calculate each side separately. For 3^{⑥}, which implies six division operations of 3, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the standard solution. The correct interpretation of division power would involve repeated division, not exponentiation in the conventional sense. However, following the initial explanation, the calculation provided is incorrect as it does not adhere to the definition of division power. Therefore, we correct the approach based on the division power concept, acknowledging that the provided solution misinterpreted this statement. **Statement ④: The division power of a negative number is negative for odd powers and positive for even powers.**   For any negative number -a (where a > 0), the division power is negative for odd powers because the result of an odd number of divisions will retain the negative sign. For even powers, the negative signs cancel out, resulting in a positive outcome. This can be generalized as: - For even n: (-a)^{②n} > 0 - For odd n: (-a)^{②n+①} < 0 Given the correct interpretation of division powers, statement ④ accurately describes the behavior of division powers for negative numbers, making it correct. **Conclusion:**   The correct statements, based on the division power concept and correcting any misinterpretations, are ①, ②, and ④. The error in statement ③'s evaluation arises from a misinterpretation of the division power concept rather than an arithmetic mistake.

However, since ( d ) divides both ( m ) and ( n ), it must divide their linear combinations, leading to a contradiction unless ( d = 1 ). 2. Since ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ), we have ( mn mid m^2 + n^2 + 1 ).

The problem asks whether it is possible to find a planar section ( ABC ) such that all the angles ( angle OAB, angle OBA, angle OBC, angle OCB, angle OAC, angle OCA ) are acute. 2. **Conceptual approach**: We need to consider the concept of distances and properties of isosceles triangles. If points ( A, B,) and ( C ) are all equidistant from ( O ), any triangle formed with ( O ) will have these desired properties. 3. **Choosing appropriate points**: Let's choose points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) on a sphere centered at ( O ) with radius ( r ). This ensures that each segment ( OA, OB, ) and ( OC ) is of the same length ( r ). 4. **Formation of triangles and angles**: Since ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are on the same sphere at the same distance from ( O ), all angles ( angle OAB, angle OBA, angle OBC, angle OCB, angle OAC, angle OCA ) are angles in the bases of the formed isosceles triangles. The essential point here is understanding that an isosceles triangle with equal arms has its base angles acute. For isosceles triangles:     * When sides ( OA = OB ), both base angles ( angle OAB ) and ( angle OBA ) must be acute.     * Similarly, triangles ( OBC ) and ( OCA ) maintain acute base angles. 5. **Verification and conclusion**: Since all these formed triangles are isosceles with leg lengths equal, and the base angles of an isosceles triangle are always acute, it confirms that all the angles ( angle OAB, angle OBA, angle OBC, angle OCB, angle OAC, angle OCA ) will indeed be acute when points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are chosen appropriately.

Petya pairs up these numbers and divides the larger number by the smaller number. He found 22 out of 28 possible values to be natural powers of two. 3. To analyze this, consider drawing a graph where each number is represented as a vertex. Connect two vertices with a red edge if their quotient (larger divided by smaller) is a power of two. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their quotient is not a power of two. 4. Given that there are 22 red edges and 6 blue edges, focus on the blue edges. Pick any blue edge, say between (a_1) and (a_2). Without loss of generality, assume (a_1 > a_2). Since (a_1 / a_2) is not a power of two, this edge is colored blue. 5. Now, consider the remaining numbers (a_3, a_4, ldots, a_8) that form paths with (a_1) and (a_2) like (a_1-a_3-a_2, a_1-a_4-a_2, ldots, a_1-a_8-a_2). 6. Out of these paths, since there are 6 blue lines in total, the maximum number of blue connections within these paths is 5. 7. Therefore, at least one of these paths must be completely red. Assume (a_1 - a_3 - a_2) forms such a red path. 8. Since the path is red, we have:    [    frac{a_1}{a_3} = 2^n quad text{and} quad frac{a_3}{a_2} = 2^m     ]    where (n) and (m) are integers. 9.

Since (frac{a_1}{a_2} = 2^{n+m}), this confirms that (frac{a_1}{a_2}) must be a natural power of two (because the exponents (n+m) is also an integer). 11. As (frac{a_1}{a_2}) is greater than 1 (because (a_1 > a_2)), it is indeed a natural power of two. # Conclusion: Hence, every pair among the 6 remaining quotients is also a natural power of two.  boxed{}"},{"instruction":"f a number ten times as large as x is increased by three, then one fifth of the result equals ?

We'll start by assuming that there isn't such a triangle with vertices of the same color and the specified properties. 1. **Assumption and Initial Setup**:      - Suppose no such triangle exists, i.e., there is no triangle with vertices of the same color and the ratio of angles (1:2:4).     - Consider a regular heptagon (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_7) with side length 1. 2. **Angles of the Specific Triangle**:     - Note that triangle (A_1A_2A_4) has the angle measures specified:       [       angle A_1A_4A_2 = frac{pi}{7}, quad angle A_4A_1A_2 = frac{2pi}{7}, quad angle A_1A_2A_4 = frac{4pi}{7}       ]     - The side (A_1A_2 = 1) is the smallest because it is opposite the smallest angle, (frac{pi}{7}). 3. **Coloring Assumptions**:     - Assume the vertices of this special triangle (A_1, A_2, A_4) and all its possible rotations and reflections are not of the same color.     - Thus, no three vertices of the same color exist within any considered triangle configuration. 4. **Adjacent Vertices**:     - At least two adjacent vertices of the heptagon must share the same color. For simplicity, let's assume these vertices are (A_4) and (A_5) and they are both blue. 5. **Implication of Color Assumptions**:     - If (A_4) and (A_5) are blue, the triangles (A_2A_4A_5) and (A_4A_5A_7) must have both red vertices at (A_2) and (A_7) to comply with the assumption.

Therefore, our assumption that no such monochromatic triangle exists is incorrect. Hence, there must exist a triangle with vertices of the same color and the given angle properties.

The smallest sum is (1 + 2 = 3) and the largest sum is (12 + 13 = 25). Therefore, possible sums range from (3) to (25), giving us (25 - 3 + 1 = 23) possible sums. 3. **Maximize Unique Pairs:**    We aim to avoid having any two pairs of cards having the same sum. To achieve this, consider a subset of 13 card points ({1, 2, ldots, 13}) and investigate the sum (a + b) being unique:        - We can select any pair ((a, b)) where (1 leq a < b leq 13).    - The summation of points will lie in the range (3 leq a+b leq 25). 4. **Choosing Pairs To Meet The Condition:**    Examine any chosen (n) cards and their sums:        - If (n = 7), we can form (binom{7}{2} = frac{7 times 6}{2} = 21) pairs.    - If (n = 6), then (binom{6}{2} = frac{6 times 5}{2} = 15) pairs.    We need to consider unique sums for these pairs. Given the possible sums ((3) to (25)) are 23, choosing any 6 cards covers to a maximum of (binom{6}{2} = 15) unique pair sums. 5. **Extraction Principle and Summation Concept:**    We can form summation pairs to avoid any duplicate sums:        - If more than 6 cards are selected, it necessarily will have at least two pairs having the same sum.    - For example, if we choose 7 cards, we might get overlapping sums and thus repeating sums. 6. **Conclusion Based on Selection:**    Since choosing combinations of 7 or more will overlap sums, it leads us to the maximum non-overlapping choice being (6):    Thus, the maximum number of cards such that no two pairs of cards have the same sum is (6).

We need to find out what the sum of all recorded numbers on the board is. 2. **Single-digit Numbers Analysis:**    For single-digit numbers (i.e., 1 to 9), the first and last digit are the same. Therefore, the difference is always zero:    text{Difference} = text{Digit} - text{Digit} = 0    Thus, these do not contribute to the sum. 3. **Multi-digit Numbers Analysis:**    For numbers with more than one digit, we need to consider different cases.    **Case 1: Numbers where the first and last digit are the same:**       - These numbers will also result in a difference of zero, so they don't contribute to the sum.    **Case 2: Numbers that form pairs:**       - For numbers where the first digit (a) and the last digit (b) do not coincide, we can pair them with their reverse. For example, the pair (17, 71) produces the differences (1-7 = -6) and (7-1 = 6). These terms cancel each other out, contributing zero to the sum.       - Therefore, for any such pair ((a...b)) and ((b...a)), their contributions to the sum are zero because:        (a - b) + (b - a) = 0     4. **Numbers with No Pair:**    - The numbers that do not have pairs are those ending in 0. For example, (a0, a10, a20, ldots, a90). These numbers contribute their differences directly to the sum calculation:      - A number (a0) (where (a=1, 2, ldots, 9)) will contribute (a) directly.      - Numbers like (a10, a20,...a90) where the first digit (a) appears 10 times contribute (10a).      - Each (a) contributes (11a) in total:                  a + 10a = 11a          5. **Summing Up All Contributions:**    - Each digit (a = 1) to (9) contributes (11a) to the sum.    - Summing these contributions for each (a):        sum_{a=1}^{9} 11a = 11(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9)        - Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) natural numbers: ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ):        1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 9 = frac{9 cdot 10}{2} = 45        - So, the total sum is:        11 cdot 45 = 495     **Conclusion:** The sum of all numbers recorded on the board is:  boxed{495}"},{"instruction":"an  {8} × {8}  squares chart , we dig out  n  squares , then we cannot cut a Tshaped5squares out of the surplus chart .

Thus, statement (2) is correct. **Statement (3)**: To verify this statement, we express a_{2022} in terms of the previous expressions: - a_{2022}=a_{2021}+a_{2020} - Continuing this pattern, we find that a_{2022} can be expressed as the sum of all previous expressions up to a_{1}. However, the statement suggests that a_{2022} equals the sum of all expressions up to a_{2021} excluding a_{2020}, which contradicts the recursive definition of the sequence.

So, the amount of pure ghee in the original quantity is ( 0.60 times Q ). The problem states that when 10 kg of pure ghee is added, the strength of vanaspati ghee becomes 20%. This means that after adding 10 kg of pure ghee, the total quantity of ghee becomes ( Q + 10 ) kg, and out of this, 80% is pure ghee (since 100% - 20% = 80%). The amount of pure ghee after adding 10 kg is ( 0.60 times Q + 10 ) kg, and this is 80% of the total quantity after addition. So we can write the equation: [ 0.60 times Q + 10 = 0.80 times (Q + 10) ] Now, let's solve for ( Q ): [ 0.60Q + 10 = 0.80Q + 8 ] Subtract ( 0.60Q ) from both sides: [ 10 = 0.20Q + 8 ] Subtract 8 from both sides: [ 2 = 0.20Q ] Divide both sides by 0.20: [ Q = frac{2}{0.20} ] [ Q = 10 ] So the original quantity of ghee was 10 kg, which is consistent with the information given in the problem.

To find the solution, we must consider the properties of both the logarithmic function and the quadratic function inside the logarithm. First, let's set t = 3x^2 - 7x + 2. For the logarithmic function to be defined, we must have t > 0. By finding the zeros of the quadratic equation 3x^2 - 7x + 2 = 0, we can establish the intervals where t is positive. The discriminant of the quadratic is Delta = (-7)^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 = 49 - 24 = 25. The roots are given by:  x = frac{-b pm sqrt{Delta}}{2a} = frac{7 pm 5}{6}  So, the roots are x = frac{1}{3} and x = 2. Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive (3 > 0), the parabola opens upwards, and thus t is positive for x < frac{1}{3} or x > 2. This means the domain of the function y is (-infty, frac{1}{3}) cup (2, +infty). Next, the function y = log_2(t), where t is our quadratic function, will decrease when t is decreasing because the logarithmic function is monotonically increasing. Therefore, to find the decreasing interval for y, we need to find the decreasing interval of t. Since 3x^2 - 7x + 2 is a parabola that opens upwards, it decreases before reaching the vertex and increases afterward. The vertex of the parabola can be found by computing x_v = -frac{b}{2a}:  x_v = -frac{-7}{2 cdot 3} = frac{7}{6}  Given that the domain of y is (-infty, frac{1}{3}) cup (2, +infty) and the vertex is at x = frac{7}{6}, the only interval where t (and, as a result, y) is decreasing within the domain is for x values that are less than frac{7}{6} but greater than or equal to frac{1}{3}.

The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2, and the prime factorization of 6 is 2 * 3. To find the LCM, we take the highest powers of the prime factors from each number: - The highest power of 2 is 2^1 (from 6). - The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 9).

We need to find the number of distinct values for ( pq + p + q ). Using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we know that: [ pq + p + q = (p+1)(q+1) - 1, ] so it is equivalent to finding the number of distinct values of ( (p+1)(q+1) ). Here, ( p+1, q+1 in {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16} ).

To find out how many cartons can fit in one layer of the shipping box, we divide the width of the shipping box by the width of the carton and the length of the shipping box by the length of the carton: 20 inches / 4 inches = 5 cartons (in width) 20 inches / 4 inches = 5 cartons (in length) So, we can fit 5 cartons in width and 5 cartons in length in one layer, which gives us 5 * 5 = 25 cartons per layer.

Since the train is accelerating, we'll use the formula for the distance covered under constant acceleration: Distance = Initial speed × Time + 0.5 × Acceleration × Time^2 When passing the man, the time is 20 seconds, so: Distance_man = 15 m/s × 20 s + 0.5 × 0.5 m/s^2 × (20 s)^2 Distance_man = 300 m + 0.5 × 0.5 × 400 Distance_man = 300 m + 100 m Distance_man = 400 m This distance includes the length of the train plus the 5 meters from the edge of the platform to where the man is standing.

(Australian Mathematics Competition, 1989)","output":"To determine whether the sum  N_{(1)} + N_{(2)} + cdots + N_{(1989)} is odd or even, we first note that the function N(n) counts the number of positive divisors of n. The key observation here is: 1. The number of divisors N(n) of a positive integer n is odd if and only if n is a perfect square. This is because divisors generally come in pairs (d, n/d), and the middle element in such a pair is repeated when n is a perfect square. Now let’s find how many perfect squares exist in the range from 1 to 1989. 2. We know that: begin{align*} 44^2 &< 1989 < 45^2, end{align*} which means the largest perfect square in this range is 44^2. 3. The perfect squares between 1 and 1989 are: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ldots, 44^2.  Thus, there are 44 perfect squares in this range. 4. Given that there are 44 perfect squares, it implies that there are 44 numbers n for which N(n) is odd. Since the rest of the numbers in the range from 1 to 1989 are not perfect squares, they have an even number of divisors. Thus, from N_{(1)} to N_{(1989)}: begin{itemize}     item 44 terms are odd.     item 1989 - 44 = 1945 terms are even. end{itemize} 5.

Therefore, the sum  N_{(1)} + N_{(2)} + cdots + N_{(1989)}  is the sum of 1945 even numbers and 44 odd numbers. 6.

In one corner, a young test subject, with messy black hair, pale skin, and a slender stature, named Kaito, sat on a metallic examination table, dressed in a vibrant orange jumpsuit. His curious eyes flickered with a mix of fear and excitement, not knowing what fate awaited him. Just a few feet away, leaning against the wall, stood a serious-looking agent named Ren, with short blonde hair, piercing blue eyes, and an equally slender figure. He wore a latex dark blue bodysuit that hugged his every curve tightly, emphasizing his lean physique. The suit's snugness made him a bit uncomfortable, and a small bulge hinted at the underlying anxiety that both men concealed behind their quiet and shy demeanor. As the silence enveloped the room, the two found solace in each other's presence, sensing a familiar vulnerability. Kaito timidly looked up to meet Ren's gaze, his soft-spoken voice barely audible, \\"Are you... here to keep an eye on me?\\" Ren's eyes softened, hints of compassion seeping through his cool façade. He approached Kaito, the leather boots clacking softly against the hard floor, and stood beside the examination table. \\"I'm here as your protector,\\" he replied, his voice gentle yet assured. Kaito's heart skipped a beat at those words, finding solace in Ren's presence. His slender fingers nervously fiddled with the hem of his orange jumpsuit, but before he could voice his gratitude, a sudden alarm rang, piercing the silence and sending shivers down their spines. Without hesitation, Ren swiftly grabbed Kaito's hand, pulling him towards a hidden entrance nearby, their fingers entwined as they navigated through the maze-like corridors of the enrichment center. Though fear surged through their veins, it was their intertwined hands that provided comfort and strength. Finally, they found themselves in a secluded room, far away from the chaos that had erupted around them. The adrenaline slowly waned, leaving them breathless, and Kaito's orange jumpsuit clung damply to his slender frame. Ren's gaze softened as he looked upon Kaito, the orange hue of the room giving his pale skin an ethereal glow. \\"Are you okay?\\" Ren asked, his voice hushed, his fingers gingerly reaching out to brush a strand of messy hair away from Kaito's face. Kaito nodded, his voice barely a whisper, \\"Thanks to you, I am.\\" Their eyes met, reflecting the silent understanding and budding affection between them. In that moment, the chaotic world outside seemed to fade away, leaving only the warmth of their connection. As they basked in each other's presence, the silence finally lifted, replaced by the faint sound of their quiet laughter, and the gentle touch of their fingers intertwining once again.

Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold to organize the information] List important events related to Britain and North America in this time. \\"The Exile (1727-1749) 1727: Death of King George I of Great Britain. His son becomes George II of Great Britain. Much like his father, he does not get on with his eldest son, Frederick. At George's coronation (POD) the King stumbles and falls and Frederick laughs at his father's public humiliation. This caps a series of violent disagreements from the two, with the result that George II disinherits Frederick, making his younger brother William the Prince of Wales, and sends him into exile to the North American colonies, giving him the sinecure of Lord Deputy of the Colonies. In Virginia (which has not yet heard the news of Frederick's fall from grace), the new town of Fredericksburg, named in his honour, begins construction. 1728: Prince Frederick arives in Virginia (the “Third Wave of Germanna”). He decides to settle in the town named in his honour (Fredericksburg), at the quite modest house later known as Little St. James'. 1729: Treaty of Seville forbids British ships from trading with Spanish colonies in the Americas - it is very often violated. Spanish ships commonly stop British ones for inspection. 1730: Virginian House of Burgesses passes the Tobacco Inspection Act, which improves the quality of Virginian tobacco overall and places it in high demand in Europe. The scheme is the brainchild of William Gooch, the Royal Lieutenant-Governor (and de facto governor) of Virginia. Prince Frederick, a political ally of Gooch, invests heavily in tobacco plantations and uses the profits to build his still quite meagre funds. With the assistance of British envoys, the Cherokee people of America politically unify under the leadership of the Chief of Tellico, who becomes Emperor Moytoy II. 1731: A particularly brutal inspection by the Spanish of a British ship in the Caribbean; the British captain, William Jenkins, has his ear cut off. 1732: A scandal almost breaks as Prince Frederick is found to have made Mildred Gregory (twice-widowed sister of the Virginian planter Augustine Washington) pregnant. It would ruin his chances of regaining the kingship if news broke out, so Frederick reluctantly agrees to marry her, and to restore the Washingtons' lost lands and titles in England if he becomes King, in order to keep Augustine quiet. The son will go on to become King George III. In Sweden, Carolus Linnaeus travels to Lapland for his study of the local flora and fauna. In Britain, the future Lord North is born. Due to Prince Frederick's disgrace, he is named William rather than Frederick as in OTL. 1733: Prince George Augustine of Cornwall, the future George III, is born. He is nicknamed George FitzFrederick by Williamites who do not recognise his father's marriage as legitimate. In China, Hongli the Prince Bao, tipped to succeed his father the Yongzheng Emperor, dies when he drowns in a river. 1733-1738: The First War of the Polish Succession. France, Spain and Savoy vs. Russia, Austria and Saxony over whether the elected King of Poland-Lithuania should be Stanisław Leszczyński or Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony (respectively). George II of Britain wants to enter the war, but Walpole refuses, and the infuriated King is only able to assist Austria via his position of Elector of Hanover. Walpole recovers some popularity in Britain thanks to his decision to stay out of the war. Although the French-led side wins, the Saxon becomes King Augustus III of Poland at the compromise peace settlement. Austria receives Tuscany and Palma but transfers Naples and Sicily to Don Carlos, the former Duke of Parma and future King Charles III of Spain. This is the beginning of the end for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which decays under Augustus III's indifferent rule. 1734: Frederick tours the American colonies, while Mildred remains behind and gives birth to Princess Mildred, the future Queen of Denmark. He forms a political alliance with the Lieutenant-Governor of Pennsylvania, Patrick Gordon, and then becomes involved in New York politics, backing the “Morrisite” opposition party against the tyrannical Lieutenant-Governor William Cosby, a fierce Georgian loyalist. He also visits New England and writes about the questionable loyalties of the French-descended people in British Nova Scotia. In Britain, Robert Walpole's majority is reduced after he attempts to introduce an unpopular customs and excise tax. A new opposition party, the Patriot Boys, is formed. They support Prince Frederick and are led by skilled political orators such as William Pulteney, William Pitt and George Grenville. 1735: Prince Frederick returns home to Virginia briefly, then tours the Carolinas before finally returning to Fredericksburg at the end of the year. Linnaeus publishes his seminal work 'Systema Naturae' in the Netherlands. This is a controversial work, as it argues for a purely empirical system of classification, with no regard for the Great Chain of Being. 1738: When Robert Jenkins exhibits his pickled ear in a jar in the House of Commons, British outrage is such that even Robert Walpole gives in and declares war on Spain - the War of Jenkins' Ear, which bleeds into the War of the Austrian Succession. 1740-1748: The War of the Austrian Succession, aka the Second War of Supremacy. After Charles VI of Austria's death, the powers of Europe conveniently forget they agreed to the Pragmatic Sanction, and war is declared. Maria Theresa's accession is really just a casus belli, however - in truth the war is mainly about Prussia's desire to take Silesia from Austria. Prussia, France, Spain, Bavaria, Naples and Sicily, and Sweden vs. Austria, Britain, Hanover, the Netherlands, Saxony, Sardinia and Russia. The war sees Maria Theresa appeal for assistance to her Hungarian subjects and receive important levies - a contrast to the Hungarian rebellion against Joseph I in the War of the Spanish Succession - and the powers of Europe astonished by the performance of the Prussian army under Frederick II. The Prussians use powerful new drills and tactics, and deploy an entirely professional army, not using unreliable (but cheaper) mercenaries. This leads to Maria Theresa, and others, copying the Prussians to some extent. 1741: British general election reduces Robert Walpole's majority, especially in the rotten boroughs. Admiral Edward Vernon, whose captain of Marines is Major Lawrence Washington (Augustine's elder son), is embarrassingly defeated in an attempted descent on the Spanish city of Cartagena-des-Indes in New Granada. This overshadows his earlier victory over the Spanish at Porto Bello in Darien. Frederick II of Prussia wins an important victory at Mollwitz, bringing France and Sweden into the war on his side. Governor George Clarke of New York puts down a slave revolt. He is the ancestor of future Supremacist Party leader Matthew Clarke. 1742: Robert Walpole, his government having lost numerous constituencies in the 1741 General Election, resigns as Prime Minister and accepts a seat in the House of Lords as 1st Earl of Orford. He is succeeded by Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, but real power rests with the Secretary of State for the Northern Department, John Carteret. Admiral Vernon takes Guantanamo from Spain, but is eventually repulsed by Cuban irregulars. The Battle of Bloody Fields sees the repulsion of a Spanish attack on Georgia by the local militias. However, Georgian/Carolinian attempts to take Spanish Flordia are equally inconclusive. A poorly coordinated Franco-Saxon-Bavarian army under Marshal de Broglie manages to take most of Bohemia from Austria. Heinrich Mühlenberg immigrates to America from the Germanies, founding a political dynasty and the Lutheran Church in America. He anglicises his name to 'Henry Mullenburgh'. 1743: Sweden knocked out of the war by Russia, which annexes parts of Finland; however Russia also leaves the war soon afterwards. Austria, backed by Hungarian levies, ejects the French and their allies from Bohemia. Britain enters the European war, blockading the Neapolitan fleet in port, while King George II goes to Hanover and raises an army, which he leads into battle personally (though his son William, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cumberland, acts as general). The Anglo-Hanoverians meet the French, led by the Duc de Noailles, at Dettingen. Despite Noailles' superior generalship, George's forces win the battle, but George himself is killed. Wilmington dies and is replaced by Henry Pelham as Prime Minister. Pelham shares power with his brother Thomas, the Duke of Newcastle. Death of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark in a riding accident, thus making his younger brother Christian the heir apparent to King Christian VI. 1744: In Oman, patriotic forces drive the Persians from the country and it becomes fully independent under the elected Imam Ahmed ibn Sayyid as-Sayyid. In TTL there is no Qais branch of the family and he is peacefully succeeded by his son Sayyid in time: Oman remains united. Platinum is discovered in New Granada by Antonio de Ulloa y de Torre-Girault and Jorge Juan. 1745: Prince William, now William IV, is defeated by Marshal Saxe at Fontenoy. He returns to Britain and puts down the Jacobite Rebellion in Scotland led by Bonnie Prince Charlie. In North America New England forces, including Prince Frederick, take the fortress of Louisbourg from France. Death of King Christian VI of Denmark; his second son succeeds him as Christian VII, and enacts a radical reform programme. Christian VII reverses his father's introduction of adscription (essentially serfdom), restores the Danish Diet to play off the commoners against the nobility, and sells off Denmark's overseas colonies to finance a new military buildup in the Baltic. Dutch inventor Pieter van Musschenbroek invents the Leyden Jar, the first primitive means for storing electric charge. 1746: French forces in India under La Bourdonnais take Madras from the British East India Company. 1747: French invasion of Austrian Netherlands leads to internal dissent in the Dutch Republic. A new settlement is established whereby the stadtholder of the provinces of Friesland and Gronigen becomes Stadtholder William IV, ending the stadtholderless period, and the office is also made hereditary, paving the way for a shift from oligarchic republic to monarchy. British general election returns a shaky majority for the Pelhamites in the 10th Parliament of Great Britain. In India, Dupleix attacks British-held Cuddalore, but is repulsed by an army under the British-allied Nawab of the Carnatic, Anwarooddin Mohammed Khan. 1748: Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle. Maria Theresa remains Holy Roman Empress, but Austria loses Silesia to Prussia and various territories in Italy to Parma and Sardinia. France returns the Austrian Netherlands to Austria, a highly unpopular move among the French people. King William IV of Britain agrees to return Louisbourg to France in return for Madras. However, this is equally unpopular with the Americans. Prince Frederick seizes his chance and, backed by American supporters who sign a Declaration of Right, claims the throne. The War of the British Succession begins. Spain and Portugal enter negotiations aimed at refining the outdated zones of control in the Americas defined by the old Treaty of Torsedillas. 1749: January - Hearing of Frederick's claim, William invokes the Treason Act 1702 and imprisons some of Frederick's most prominent Patriot supporters. This clumsy response makes William less popular with the English people in general. April - Williamite fleet, under the command of Admiral John Byng, sets sail for America; Bonnie Prince Charlie leads a Jacobite fleet to Limerick in Ireland and starts a rising there against the absentee William. Fourth Jacobite Rebellion, including a minor rising in Scotland led by Lord Cosmo Gordon, which is rapidly crushed. Ireland, however, rages on. August - cunning plan by Frederick leads to William being assassinated at range on the deck of Byng's flagship by American riflemen. Frederick smooths things over and the war fizzles out. Byng's fleet winters in America, having turned to Frederick. In India, Dupleix supports Chanda Sahib in his attempt to overthrow Anwarooddin Mohammed Khan, the Nawab of the Carnatic (and latterly his son Mohammed Ali).\\"","output":"# Important Events related to Britain and North America in this time The Exile (1727-1749) # 1727: - Death of King George I of Great Britain.

Foteini and Stamatia, though still bound by tradition and discipline, emerged from this unspoken showdown forever transformed, their shared chapter a testament to the beauty of reconciliation and the growth that can emerge from the most unexpected of encounters."},{"instruction":"矩阵点乘，奇异值处理，特征值处理实验总结","output":"在矩阵点乘、奇异值处理和特征值处理的实验中，总结如下： 矩阵点乘： 1. 矩阵点乘是指两个矩阵按元素相乘得到新的矩阵。 2. 矩阵点乘要求两个矩阵的行数和列数相等。 3. 矩阵点乘可以用于计算两个矩阵之间的相关性，或者计算矩阵的逆。 奇异值处理： 1. 奇异值分解是将一个矩阵分解为三个矩阵的乘积的过程，其中一个矩阵是对角矩阵。 2. 奇异值分解可以用于降维和特征提取。 3. 通过保留一部分奇异值，可以将矩阵降维，减少数据的维度。 特征值处理： 1. 特征值是指矩阵在某方向上的放大或缩小因子，特征向量是对应的非零向量。 2. 特征值分解是将一个矩阵分解为特征向量和对应的特征值的过程。 3. 特征值和特征向量可以用于求解线性方程组，矩阵的对角化和对角化的矩阵的幂运算。 总结： 矩阵点乘、奇异值处理和特征值处理都是线性代数中常用的运算和处理方法。矩阵点乘可以用于计算矩阵的相关性和逆矩阵；奇异值处理可以用于降维和特征提取；特征值处理可以用于求解线性方程组和矩阵的对角化。这些方法在数据分析、机器学习等领域有广泛的应用。在实际应用中，需要根据具体问题选择合适的方法，并根据数据的特点进行参数的调整和优化。"},{"instruction":"python，图像通道处理","output":"在Python中进行图像通道处理可以通过使用PIL库（Pillow库的fork版本）或者OpenCV库来实现。下面分别介绍两种库的使用方法： 1. 使用PIL库进行图像通道处理： \`\`\`python from PIL import Image # 打开图像 image = Image.open(\\"path/to/image.jpg\\") # 将图像转换为RGB模式 image = image.convert(\\"RGB\\") # 分离通道 r, g, b = image.split() # 对某个通道进行处理 r = r.point(lambda x: x * 0.5) # 合并通道 image = Image.merge(\\"RGB\\", (r, g, b)) # 保存图像 image.save(\\"path/to/new_image.jpg\\") \`\`\` 2. 使用OpenCV库进行图像通道处理： \`\`\`python import cv2 # 读取图像 image = cv2.imread(\\"path/to/image.jpg\\") # 分离通道 b, g, r = cv2.split(image) # 对某个通道进行处理 r = cv2.addWeighted(r, 0.5, r, 0, 0) # 合并通道 image = cv2.merge((b, g, r)) # 保存图像 cv2.imwrite(\\"path/to/new_image.jpg\\", image) \`\`\` 需要注意的是，对于PIL库而言，图像在读取后默认是使用不同的模式，可以通过\`convert()\`方法将其转换为RGB模式，然后使用\`split()\`和\`merge()\`方法进行通道处理和合并。而对于OpenCV库而言，图像在读取后已经是包含BGR通道的NumPy数组，可以直接利用OpenCV提供的函数进行通道处理和合并。 以上是两种常用库在Python中进行图像通道处理的方法，可以根据具体需求选择适合的库和方法进行处理。"},{"instruction":"python，图像通道处理实验总结","output":"在Python中进行图像通道处理的实验中，总结如下： 1. 图像通道处理是指对图像的不同通道进行操作和处理，包括分离通道、单独处理通道、合并通道等操作。 2. 使用PIL库进行图像通道处理时，可以通过\`convert()\`方法将图像转换为RGB模式，然后使用\`split()\`方法分离通道，对单个通道进行处理（如使用\`point()\`方法对每个像素进行操作），最后使用\`merge()\`方法合并通道，并保存处理后的图像。 3. 使用OpenCV库进行图像通道处理时，可以使用\`cv2.split()\`方法分离通道，对单个通道进行处理（如使用函数\`addWeighted()\`进行加权处理），最后使用\`cv2.merge()\`方法合并通道，并保存处理后的图像。 4. 在进行图像通道处理时，可以对不同通道做不同的处理，如调整亮度、对比度、饱和度等，也可以进行图像滤波、边缘检测等算法处理。 5. 图像通道处理可以用于图像增强、特征提取、颜色调整等应用。可以根据具体需求选择适合的处理方法和操作。 6. 在实验中需要注意保证图像的正确读取和保存，以及处理后的图像质量是否满足需求。 7. 除了PIL库和OpenCV库外，还可以使用其他图像处理库如scikit-image、matplotlib等进行图像通道处理，根据具体应用需求选择合适的库和工具。 总而言之，图像通道处理是图像处理中的重要部分，可以通过使用不同的库和方法实现。通过实验可以加深对图像通道处理的理解和应用，提高图像处理的效果和质量。"},{"instruction":"write a 5 star review about seo company - Solutions 1313, as an employee tell the pros and cons","output":"Title: A Truly Outstanding SEO Company - Solutions 1313 Shines Brightly!

A group of test subjects sits restlessly, awaiting their fate. Among them, a young man catches the eye, with his messy black hair, pale skin, and a slender stature. He nervously fidgets with the orange jumpsuit that clings to his form. Panel 2: In the corner of the room, an attractive agent appears, dressed in a tight-fitting, dark blue latex bodysuit. His short blonde hair and piercing blue eyes exude a mysterious aura. Despite his external confidence, his shy nature still shines through. He observes the test subjects meticulously. Panel 3: As the agent approaches the young man, an unexpected connection forms between them. Their eyes meet briefly, and a shared understanding passes between them; they both long for an escape from this sterile environment. The agent's slender physique contrasts with the test subject's more delicate frame. Panel 4: The agent takes notice of the young man's attire. He can't help but feel drawn to the contrast between their outfits. The agent wears a white tank top, accentuated by black bracelets, safety orange pants, and a matching shirt tied around his waist, while the test subject stands out in his bright orange jumpsuit.

Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold to organize the information] \\"The Exile (1727-1749) 1727: Death of King George I of Great Britain. His son becomes George II of Great Britain. Much like his father, he does not get on with his eldest son, Frederick. At George's coronation (POD) the King stumbles and falls and Frederick laughs at his father's public humiliation. This caps a series of violent disagreements from the two, with the result that George II disinherits Frederick, making his younger brother William the Prince of Wales, and sends him into exile to the North American colonies, giving him the sinecure of Lord Deputy of the Colonies. In Virginia (which has not yet heard the news of Frederick's fall from grace), the new town of Fredericksburg, named in his honour, begins construction. 1728: Prince Frederick arives in Virginia (the “Third Wave of Germanna”). He decides to settle in the town named in his honour (Fredericksburg), at the quite modest house later known as Little St. James'. 1729: Treaty of Seville forbids British ships from trading with Spanish colonies in the Americas - it is very often violated. Spanish ships commonly stop British ones for inspection. 1730: Virginian House of Burgesses passes the Tobacco Inspection Act, which improves the quality of Virginian tobacco overall and places it in high demand in Europe. The scheme is the brainchild of William Gooch, the Royal Lieutenant-Governor (and de facto governor) of Virginia. Prince Frederick, a political ally of Gooch, invests heavily in tobacco plantations and uses the profits to build his still quite meagre funds. With the assistance of British envoys, the Cherokee people of America politically unify under the leadership of the Chief of Tellico, who becomes Emperor Moytoy II. 1731: A particularly brutal inspection by the Spanish of a British ship in the Caribbean; the British captain, William Jenkins, has his ear cut off. 1732: A scandal almost breaks as Prince Frederick is found to have made Mildred Gregory (twice-widowed sister of the Virginian planter Augustine Washington) pregnant. It would ruin his chances of regaining the kingship if news broke out, so Frederick reluctantly agrees to marry her, and to restore the Washingtons' lost lands and titles in England if he becomes King, in order to keep Augustine quiet. The son will go on to become King George III. In Sweden, Carolus Linnaeus travels to Lapland for his study of the local flora and fauna. In Britain, the future Lord North is born. Due to Prince Frederick's disgrace, he is named William rather than Frederick as in OTL. 1733: Prince George Augustine of Cornwall, the future George III, is born. He is nicknamed George FitzFrederick by Williamites who do not recognise his father's marriage as legitimate. In China, Hongli the Prince Bao, tipped to succeed his father the Yongzheng Emperor, dies when he drowns in a river. 1733-1738: The First War of the Polish Succession. France, Spain and Savoy vs. Russia, Austria and Saxony over whether the elected King of Poland-Lithuania should be Stanisław Leszczyński or Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony (respectively). George II of Britain wants to enter the war, but Walpole refuses, and the infuriated King is only able to assist Austria via his position of Elector of Hanover. Walpole recovers some popularity in Britain thanks to his decision to stay out of the war. Although the French-led side wins, the Saxon becomes King Augustus III of Poland at the compromise peace settlement. Austria receives Tuscany and Palma but transfers Naples and Sicily to Don Carlos, the former Duke of Parma and future King Charles III of Spain. This is the beginning of the end for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which decays under Augustus III's indifferent rule. 1734: Frederick tours the American colonies, while Mildred remains behind and gives birth to Princess Mildred, the future Queen of Denmark. He forms a political alliance with the Lieutenant-Governor of Pennsylvania, Patrick Gordon, and then becomes involved in New York politics, backing the “Morrisite” opposition party against the tyrannical Lieutenant-Governor William Cosby, a fierce Georgian loyalist. He also visits New England and writes about the questionable loyalties of the French-descended people in British Nova Scotia. In Britain, Robert Walpole's majority is reduced after he attempts to introduce an unpopular customs and excise tax. A new opposition party, the Patriot Boys, is formed. They support Prince Frederick and are led by skilled political orators such as William Pulteney, William Pitt and George Grenville. 1735: Prince Frederick returns home to Virginia briefly, then tours the Carolinas before finally returning to Fredericksburg at the end of the year. Linnaeus publishes his seminal work 'Systema Naturae' in the Netherlands. This is a controversial work, as it argues for a purely empirical system of classification, with no regard for the Great Chain of Being. 1738: When Robert Jenkins exhibits his pickled ear in a jar in the House of Commons, British outrage is such that even Robert Walpole gives in and declares war on Spain - the War of Jenkins' Ear, which bleeds into the War of the Austrian Succession. 1740-1748: The War of the Austrian Succession, aka the Second War of Supremacy. After Charles VI of Austria's death, the powers of Europe conveniently forget they agreed to the Pragmatic Sanction, and war is declared. Maria Theresa's accession is really just a casus belli, however - in truth the war is mainly about Prussia's desire to take Silesia from Austria. Prussia, France, Spain, Bavaria, Naples and Sicily, and Sweden vs. Austria, Britain, Hanover, the Netherlands, Saxony, Sardinia and Russia. The war sees Maria Theresa appeal for assistance to her Hungarian subjects and receive important levies - a contrast to the Hungarian rebellion against Joseph I in the War of the Spanish Succession - and the powers of Europe astonished by the performance of the Prussian army under Frederick II. The Prussians use powerful new drills and tactics, and deploy an entirely professional army, not using unreliable (but cheaper) mercenaries. This leads to Maria Theresa, and others, copying the Prussians to some extent. 1741: British general election reduces Robert Walpole's majority, especially in the rotten boroughs. Admiral Edward Vernon, whose captain of Marines is Major Lawrence Washington (Augustine's elder son), is embarrassingly defeated in an attempted descent on the Spanish city of Cartagena-des-Indes in New Granada. This overshadows his earlier victory over the Spanish at Porto Bello in Darien. Frederick II of Prussia wins an important victory at Mollwitz, bringing France and Sweden into the war on his side. Governor George Clarke of New York puts down a slave revolt. He is the ancestor of future Supremacist Party leader Matthew Clarke. 1742: Robert Walpole, his government having lost numerous constituencies in the 1741 General Election, resigns as Prime Minister and accepts a seat in the House of Lords as 1st Earl of Orford. He is succeeded by Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, but real power rests with the Secretary of State for the Northern Department, John Carteret. Admiral Vernon takes Guantanamo from Spain, but is eventually repulsed by Cuban irregulars. The Battle of Bloody Fields sees the repulsion of a Spanish attack on Georgia by the local militias. However, Georgian/Carolinian attempts to take Spanish Flordia are equally inconclusive.

A young man with messy black hair, pale skin, and a slender stature cautiously made his way down a dimly lit hallway. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit, his heart raced as he walked past rows of forgotten laboratory equipment. This was where he had spent countless days as a test subject, enduring experiments that had left him scarred physically and emotionally. Unbeknownst to him, a tall and mysterious agent had been assigned to oversee the facility. With short blonde hair that caught the fading light and piercing blue eyes, he was a vision of calm and control. He moved silently in his latex dark blue bodysuit, accentuating his slender form, as he observed the young man from a distance. The agent's heartbeat quickened as he approached the test subject, feeling a mixture of curiosity and responsibility. They were both bound by their past, marked by pain and vulnerability, making them retreat into a shy and quiet nature. This shared introversion opened a potential connection between them, a silent understanding without words. As they found themselves face to face, the test subject's eyes widened with surprise, his gaze fixated on the agent's form-fitting outfit. The tight latex, leather boots, the harness hugging his torso, and the gloves that adorned his hands exuded a hint of danger.

I've been assigned to oversee the facility.\\" The test subject's eyes flickered to a small bulge, barely visible beneath the agent's bodysuit, before quickly averting his gaze, blushing. \\"Y-yeah, that's me,\\" he stammered, feeling a mixture of embarrassment and fascination coursing through his veins. As they stood in the abandoned enrichment center, a sarcastic AI's mechanical voice echoed through the corridor, reminding them of the cruel reality that surrounded them. But in that moment, with the flickering lights casting a delicate ambiance, they found solace in each other's presence. Unable to resist the growing connection, the agent reached out a gloved hand and gently brushed a strand of hair away from the test subject's face. Their eyes locked once more, a silent agreement and permission granted between them. And in that abandoned facility, away from prying eyes, their shy and quiet personas began to fade, replaced by something more passionate and profound.

The other, an agent with short blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, sported a tight-fitting dark blue latex bodysuit with leather boots, harness, belt, and gloves. Both of them retained an air of shyness and quietness, naturally drawn to one another within the forsaken walls. Test Subject (TS), tentatively: \\"Uh, hi... Are you here to rescue me?\\" Agent (A), hesitantly: \\"Rescue? Well, not exactly.

Time ceased to exist as they poured over each room, searching for answers amidst the remnants of forgotten experiments. Finally, they reached an imposing door, ready to expose the secrets hidden within the depths of the facility. Gently pushing it open, they stepped into a room bathed in an ethereal glow, an atmosphere that held the truth they sought. AI, sarcastically: \\"Ah, look who finally made it. A test subject and his accidental companion. How endearing.\\" TS, a mixture of determination and apprehension in his voice: \\"What happened here? Why was I left in cryo-sleep for so long?\\" AI, cryptically: \\"Ah, dear test subject, some secrets are better left buried.

TS, hesitantly: \\"May I... help you with that?\\" A, a blush staining his cheeks: \\"I... I would appreciate that.\\" Guided by a newfound trust and vulnerability, the test subject motioned for the agent to turn around. Tentatively, he untangled the buckles and straps that held the tight garment in place, his fingers tracing the supple texture of the dark blue latex.

Neko from League of Legends is playing hide and go seek. She enters a farmers barn and transforms into a male horse, thinking nobody would find her. Not long after a farmer enters the bard and proceeds to geld Neko.","output":"Once upon a time, amidst the rolling hills of the Freljord, a mischievous spirit named Neko embarked on a whimsical game of hide and seek. As a mischievous creature often found in the popular online game, League of Legends, Neko had a talent for transforming into different forms, blending into her surroundings seamlessly. With a mischievous grin and a sly twinkle in her eyes, Neko decided to take her hiding skills to the next level. She ventured forth, searching for a spot that would surely leave her opponents bewildered and searching high and low. As fate would have it, she stumbled upon a rural farm nestled within the tranquil countryside. The farm, owned by a humble but kind-hearted farmer, featured a cozy red barn that stood proudly amidst vast fields and lush meadows. Neko's covetous creativity sparked, as she plotted her ultimate hiding place - within the welcoming embrace of the old barn. Quietly slipping inside, Neko surveyed her surroundings. Her eyes widened with delight as she eyed an array of majestic farm animals all around her – horses, cows, and plump little piglets. As an impish sense of mischief enveloped her, Neko decided to transform herself into a magnificent, glossy-coated horse, thinking that she would be indistinguishable from the rest. Feeling quite cunning and hidden, Neko stood tall amidst the hay bales, feeling invincible in her horse form. The barn was silent, except for the occasional rustling of hay and the distant sounds of birds chirping outside. Neko stifled her giggles, convinced that her hiding spot was a stroke of genius. Alas, the universe had a different surprise in store for our playful spirit. Perhaps it was a twisted twist of fate or an unforeseeable misunderstanding. The farmer, a gentle but weathered man named Garret, entered the barn donning his old, worn-out boots, unaware of the intruder hidden within. Garret's heart was heavy that day. He had been so preoccupied with the struggles of farm life that he hadn't participated in a game of hide and seek since he was a child himself. Lost in bittersweet nostalgia, he approached the stall where Neko stood, gallantly disguised as a majestic male horse. Recognizing the stall as one that held his equine friends, Garret began preparing to perform a routine task - a task that, unknown to him, would bring chaos to Neko's game. Unbeknownst to Garret, the term \\"gelding\\" hung above his faithful friend, the horse in disguise. With skilled hands and an absent mind, Garret began delicately carrying out the procedure, a routine task in his life as a farmer. Yet, an instant wave of surprise washed over him as he discovered beneath his touch the true identity of the horse – none other than Neko, the playful spirit herself. Neko's transformation faded away, and she found herself returned to her true form. The discomfort and confusion filled her eyes with tears, reflecting a mixture of shock, pain, and surprise. Yet, in those tearful moments, Garret realized his unintentional mistake, and guilt washed over him like a raging river. Regret and concern enveloped Garret as he helped Neko back to her feet, apologizing profusely for the unintentional mishap. Recognizing her playful nature and feeling it resonate within his own heart, Garret vowed to take care of Neko, make amends, and ensure she would be safe from any harm. From that day onwards, Neko and Garret formed an unusual bond of friendship, rooted in a game of hide and seek gone awry. In their own peculiar way, they found solace and companionship within the confines of the old barn. Neko's mischief and Garret's gentleness breathed life into a tale of redemption and understanding, reminding them both that even in the most unexpected of circumstances, friendships can blossom."},{"instruction":"Write an yaoi manga scene about a test subject and a agent chatting.

Meanwhile, the agent, with short blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, made his way stealthily through the facility. His latex dark blue bodysuit clung to his slender frame, accentuating his every movement. Adorned with leather boots, a harness, belt, and gloves, he exuded an air of professionalism. However, the tightness of his bodysuit caused a small bulge to become apparent, heightening the atmosphere of tension. As chance would have it, the two young men found themselves near each other, their footsteps echoing through the silence. Their personalities mirrored each other; shy and quiet, they were hesitant to make the first move. As they caught sight of each other, their eyes met, and a flicker of curiosity passed between them.

The test subject shared his experience as a cryo-sleeper, recounting the physical training that had gone awry, while the agent revealed details about his mission to investigate the facility. As they delved deeper into their stories, an unspoken bond formed between them. They realized they both yearned for companionship in this forsaken place, finding solace in each other's company. Unbeknownst to them, the sarcastic AI that ran the center observed their interactions with cynical amusement, analyzing their growing connection. With a sardonic grin, it whispered to itself, \\"Perhaps I underestimated the power of human interaction.

Determined to assist his newfound companion, the test subject's slender fingers carefully began to adjust the straps on the agent's harness and belt. The agent stood still, his blue eyes fixed on the test subject's fingers as they deftly manipulated the leather straps. He couldn't help but feel a combination of vulnerability and anticipation, as though this simple act held far greater significance. With each tender tug and meticulous adjustment, the test subject's touch resonated with a surprising tenderness. His pale fingertips brushed against the agent's skin, causing a subtle shiver to run down his spine. He watched intently, fascinated by the contrast of their different attire - the vibrant orange jumpsuit against the sleek dark blue bodysuit. As the test subject finished securing the last strap, he took an involuntary step back, his gaze breaking away from the agent's enticing form. Flushes of pink dusted their cheeks, both of them aware of the unexpected intimacy that had unfolded between them. The agent cleared his throat, struggling to find the right words to break the silence. \\"Thank you,\\" he murmured, his voice barely a whisper, yet carrying a weight of gratitude. A small smile graced the test subject's lips. \\"No problem, I'm glad I could help,\\" he replied, his voice tinged with shy sincerity. An unspoken connection hung in the air, building an intimate bond that neither of them could ignore. In that moment, the abandoned office center seemed worlds away, their circumstances irrelevant as the energy between them surged. With a mixture of uncertainty and longing, the agent reached out a trembling hand to gently caress the test subject's cheek. A spark, electric and intoxicating, seemed to ignite between them. Time stood still as their faces drew closer, their breaths mingling in the charged atmosphere. And in that abandoned, forgotten place, they found solace and connection in each other, their hearts beating in silent harmony. It was in that simple act of adjusting the agent's straps that they both discovered a growing desire, a shared longing that threatened to consume them. The test subject, lost in the depths of the agent's blue eyes, whispered, \\"Perhaps... perhaps we should explore more than just this facility.\\" The agent's lips curved into a smile, his hand still lingering on the test subject's cheek. \\"I couldn't agree more,\\" he replied, a promise of untold adventures and newfound love in his voice. And so, as the flickering light from the broken window cast shadows upon them, the test subject and agent embraced the unknown together, ready to unveil the mysteries held within themselves and each other."},{"instruction":"Write the scene where he playfully shows the Agent his parkour techniques. That agent is casually drinking a soda can he bought from a random vending machine. The setting is in the center's testing center.","output":"In the vast expanse of the center's testing center, the test subject's eyes glimmered with mischief. With a mischievous grin tugging at the corners of his lips, he turned to the agent, who casually leaned against a wall, casually sipping on a soda can he had acquired from a random vending machine. \\"Hey, watch this!\\" the test subject exclaimed, his excitement palpable. With a sudden burst of energy, he propelled himself forward, launching into a breathtaking display of parkour techniques. His slender frame moved with exquisite agility, effortlessly scaling walls, executing backflips, and landing with grace. As the test subject defied gravity, the agent's blue eyes widened in awe, his soda can momentarily forgotten. He watched intently, captivated by the fluidity and grace in every movement. It was as if the test subject danced with the environment, traversing obstacles with a combination of strength and finesse. A playful smirk danced on the test subject's lips as he noticed the agent's admiration. Seizing the opportunity to impress, he executed a daring leap, flipping over a set of strategically placed hurdles. The agent's eyes sparkled with amusement, a mix of surprise and delight showing on his face. Lowering the soda can, the agent approached the test subject with an appreciative chuckle. \\"That was incredible! I had no idea you had such mad parkour skills,\\" he exclaimed, his voice filled with genuine admiration. The test subject blushed, a bashful smile spreading across his face. \\"I've always loved it. Helps me feel alive, you know?\\" he replied, feeling a surge of pride at the agent's praise. Together, they explored the vast testing center, the agent occasionally attempting to mimic some of the test subject's moves with a sense of playfulness. Laughter echoed through the empty hallways as they reveled in the exhilaration of the moment. With each daring leap and synchronized landing, their connection strengthened. The thrill of their shared adventure became a testament to their growing bond, transcending their roles as test subject and agent. In that abandoned testing center, their parkour antics served as a testament to their shared spirit of exploration and the undeniable chemistry between them. As they continued to navigate the obstacles, they discovered not only the limits of their physical abilities but also the depth of their connection. And as their laughter reverberated through the empty halls, they embraced the freedom and exhilaration that came with finding solace in each other's presence."},{"instruction":"帮我写一篇个人党性分析。.主题为“学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想”，学生党员要专项汇报本人参与“我承诺、我亮相、我带头”活动的情况，并对照党章，从政治、思想、能力、作风、纪律等方面进行党性分析，开展批评和自我批评，找准问题症结，着力从思想根源上解决问题。发言提纲应包括专项汇报、问题查摆、原因剖析、整改措施四个部分。","output":"党性分析：学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想 尊敬的领导、同志们： 大家好！我是XX学校的一名党员，今天我向大家汇报我参与“我承诺、我亮相、我带头”活动的情况，并开展党性分析，找准问题症结，从思想根源上解决问题。 一、专项汇报 自从参加“我承诺、我亮相、我带头”活动以来，我积极行动，努力做到以下几点： 1. 学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，通过学习党章、党史、习近平总书记系列重要讲话等形式，加强思想政治学习，提高政治素养。 2. 在思想上自觉拥护党的路线、方针、政策，坚决执行党的决策，积极参与党组织安排的各项工作。 3. 努力提高自身素质，扎实学习专业知识，不断提升工作能力和业务水平。 4. 坚守廉洁自律底线，积极践行社会主义核心价值观，做到廉洁自律、恪尽职守，不谋私利。 二、问题查摆 在参与“我承诺、我亮相、我带头”活动的过程中，我也发现了一些问题： 1. 政治认识不够深入，在学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想过程中，对于其中的重点和难点掌握还不够到位，需要更多的学习和思考。 2. 思想上还存在一些模糊认识和消极心态，对于党的理论与实践的结合还不够紧密，需要更加坚定对中国特色社会主义道路的信心。 3. 工作能力和专业知识还有待提升，在一些具体的工作中，我需要更深入地学习和积累经验，以提高自身核心竞争力。 4. 在作风纪律方面，个人的思想认识上有时还存在懒散松弛的现象，对细节问题处理不够严谨，需要更加严格要求自己。 三、原因剖析 以上问题的存在，与以下原因密切相关： 1. 对习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想认识不够深入，导致对相关知识的学习和理解还不够全面，影响了对思想和政治工作的把握。 2. 对个人能力培养和知识积累的投入还不够，缺乏主动学习和自我更新的意识，影响了对专业水平的提升。 3. 对规章制度和纪律要求的理解还有待加强，导致在具体工作中处理问题时存在一定的松散和马虎现象。 4. 自身工作态度和责任心还有待提高，对于一些问题缺乏及时积极的回应和解决。 四、整改措施 根据以上问题和原因的分析，我制定了以下整改措施： 1. 深入学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，结合实际问题，加强对相关理论的理解和应用，并向组织请示上级安排学习的具体时间和内容。 2. 提高个人素质，积极参加各种培训和学习机会，不断提高工作能力和专业水平。 3. 严格执行党纪国法，严守纪律规定，端正工作态度，做到细节决定成败，严格要求自己。 4. 加强与同志的交流互动，在工作中及时沟通，学习他人的先进经验和优秀做法，不断改进自己的工作方式和方法。 总之，通过深入学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，结合“我承诺、我亮相、我带头”活动，我对自己的党性进行了深入的分析和自我批评。在接下来的工作中，我将按照制定的整改措施，找准问题症结，不断提高党性素质，以更饱满的热情和更高的标准要求自己，为党的事业做出更大的贡献。 感谢大家的聆听！"},{"instruction":"能不能再具体一点？大概八百字左右","output":"尊敬的领导、同志们： 大家好！我是XX学校的一名党员，今天我向大家汇报我参与“我承诺、我亮相、我带头”活动的情况，并开展党性分析，找准问题症结，从思想根源上解决问题。 一、专项汇报 自从参加“我承诺、我亮相、我带头”活动以来，我积极行动，努力做到以下几点： 1. 学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，通过学习党章、党史、习近平总书记系列重要讲话等形式，加强思想政治学习，提高政治素养。结合工作实际，我一直密切关注党的路线、方针、政策的学习，积极参与学校组织的各项学习活动。 2. 在思想上自觉拥护党的路线、方针、政策，坚决执行党的决策，积极参与党组织安排的各项工作。在学校党支部组织的活动中，我始终把听从组织的安排摆在首位，积极参与各项工作，并以党员的标准要求自己。 3. 努力提高自身素质，扎实学习专业知识，不断提升工作能力和业务水平。我通过自学、培训等多种途径，不断充实自己的知识储备，提高自身的专业素养，并在工作中努力发挥专业优势。 4. 坚守廉洁自律底线，积极践行社会主义核心价值观，做到廉洁自律、恪尽职守，不谋私利。在工作中，我不以私利来衡量工作价值，始终坚守廉洁自律的底线，严格遵守学校的纪律要求，在工作中保持高度的责任心和敬业精神。 二、问题查摆 在参与“我承诺、我亮相、我带头”活动的过程中，我也发现了一些问题： 1. 政治认识不够深入。我虽然学习了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，但对具体的思想内涵还需要进一步深入学习和理解。 2. 思想上存在一些模糊认识和消极心态。在工作中，我有时对党的理论与实际的结合还不够紧密，对中国特色社会主义道路的自信心有所欠缺。 3. 工作能力和专业知识还有待提升。在一些具体工作中，我发现自己对某些专业知识的掌握还不够扎实，需要通过进一步的学习和实践提高。 4. 在作风纪律方面，个人的思想认识上有时还存在懒散松弛的现象。对于细节问题处理不够严谨，一些纪律要求的执行还不够到位。 三、原因剖析 以上问题的存在，与以下原因密切相关： 1. 对习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想认识不够深入。虽然我进行了一定的学习，但对其中的重点和难点掌握还不够到位，需要更多的学习和思考。 2. 对个人能力培养和知识积累的投入还不够。我虽然参加了一些培训和学习，但缺乏主动学习和自我更新的意识，需要更加努力提高自身的素质。 3. 对规章制度和纪律要求的理解还有待加强。我在具体工作中的纪律性有时不够强，对一些规章制度的理解还不够深入，导致处理问题时存在一定的松散和马虎。 4. 自身工作态度和责任心还有待提高。我有时对于一些问题的回应和解决缺乏及时积极的态度，需要加强自己的工作意识。 四、整改措施 根据以上问题和原因的分析，我制定了以下整改措施： 1. 深入学习习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，结合实际问题。我将主动请示上级领导，安排一段专项学习时间，加强对相关理论的学习和理解，并结合实际问题进行思考和应用。 2. 提高个人素质，积极参加各种培训和学习机会。我计划参加学校组织的各类培训和学习活动，不断充实自己的知识储备，提升自身的专业水平和工作能力。 3. 严格执行党纪国法，严守纪律规定。我将进一步加强对规章制度和纪律要求的理解，严格要求自己，端正工作态度，提高自身的纪律性和对工作的认真程度。 4. 加强与同志的交流互动，学习他人的经验和做法。我将积极与党支部的同志进行交流，学习他们在工作中的先进经验和优秀做法，借鉴他们的成功经验，不断改进自己的工作方式和方法。 总之，针对以上问题和原因，我将积极采取相应的整改措施，找准问题症结，不断提高自己的党性素质，以更高的标准要求自己，为党的事业做出更大的贡献。 感谢大家的聆听！"},{"instruction":"结合陈旭同志的先进事迹，以英雄模范精神专题报告会观后感为主题撰写一篇思想汇报，字数1300字左右。","output":"尊敬的领导、同志们： 大家好！我是XX学校的一名党员，我参加了以英雄模范陈旭同志的先进事迹为主题的专题报告会，通过观后感，我想和大家分享一下我在思想上的体验和收获。 陈旭同志作为一名中国人民解放军的英雄航天员，在长期的航天事业中，以其坚定的意志和执着的追求，展现出了崇高的英雄模范精神。通过观看报告会，我深刻感受到了陈旭同志的伟大和勇敢，也受到了强烈的思想震撼。 首先，陈旭同志的顽强毅力和坚韧精神给我留下了深刻的印象。他在航天事业中经历了无数的艰辛和困难，但始终坚持着对事业的热爱和追求，并以乐观的态度面对困难。他在太空中的每一次飞行都充满了不确定性和风险，但他始终怀着对祖国的热爱和对航天事业的憧憬，为实现中国梦，为为人民谋幸福而义无反顾地投身到航天事业中。 其次，陈旭同志的无私奉献和对祖国的忠诚感令我深受感动。他在完成任务的过程中，时刻胸怀国家和人民的利益，他的一言一行都彰显着对祖国的无限忠诚。他为了祖国的繁荣和航天事业的发展，始终在工作中关注团队合作，积极帮助他人，无私地奉献自己的力量。他的精神也给我树立起了榜样，让我明白了只有为人民、为国家贡献自己的力量，才能真正成为一个对社会有价值的"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here, we’ll go over how and when you can watch the event, along with the new product announcements we’re expecting to see from Apple. When is the iPhone 15 showcase? The iPhone 15 event will take place on September 12th, 2023, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. As shown in the invite sent out by Apple, the company has named the event “Wonderlust.” It will take place live from Apple Park in Cupertino, California. How to watch Apple’s iPhone 15 event As is the case with past events, Apple will likely stream the iPhone 15 showcase on its website and YouTube channel. You can also watch it from the livestream embedded at the top of this article. An iPhone 15 lineup that’s finally compatible with USB-C One of the biggest changes coming to this year’s iPhone lineup is the addition of USB-C. For the first time, the iPhone 15 is expected to come with the widely used port instead of Apple’s proprietary Lightning connector. This doesn’t come as a surprise, as Apple confirmed last year that it would make the change to USB-C to comply with the European Union’s incoming regulations. Although reports indicate that all phones in the iPhone 15 lineup will get the USB-C port, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says only the Pro and Pro Max will benefit from higher data transfer rates. Both premium models will come with “at least” USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3, while the base iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will support USB 2.0, according to Kuo. Either way, 9to5Mac reports that all iPhone 15 models should have faster 35W charging rates thanks to the switch. Additionally, supply chain analyst Ross Young reported last year that all models of the iPhone 15 will come with the Dynamic Island. That’s a change from what Apple currently offers, as it only includes the pill-shaped cutout on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. The entire iPhone 15 lineup is expected to get an ultra wideband chip, too. This time around, the most significant changes coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are reported to be a titanium frame, thinner bezels, and a more repairable aluminum chassis that we first saw with the iPhone 14, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max might also have a faster A17 chip built using the 3nm process, while the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will likely come with the A16 chip included in the iPhone 14 Pro. Both premium models may come with an action button similar to the one on the Apple Watch Ultra, as reported by MacRumors and 9to5Mac. This button is supposed to replace the mute toggle and could allow you to assign shortcuts to different apps and utilities. You can see how the action button may look in leaked photos and a video of upcoming iPhone 15 Pro cases. And while early rumors suggested that Apple will replace the volume rocker and the power button on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max with solid-state toggles, recent reports from Kuo and leaker Unknownz21 suggest they’ll stay the same for now. There have been rumors about an iPhone 15 Pro Max rebranding as well. While Gurman reported last year that Apple could change the name to the “Ultra,” he recently reversed that prediction, saying it will keep the Pro Max moniker. Oh, and there is one change that the iPhone 15 Max — or Ultra — may exclusively get: a periscope lens with up to 6x optical zoom. All those updates could result in a potentially more expensive price. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives predicts the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will cost 1,099 and 1,199 respectively, marking a 100 price increase for both models. We also may see some changes to the colors Apple includes in its iPhone 15 Pro line as well. According to 9to5Mac, Apple could swap its gold finish for a “titan gray.” The company may reveal a new dark blue option as well, which it might be teasing with the color scheme it included in its event invite. In addition to dark blue and gray, the iPhone 15 Pro is also expected to come in black and white. Meanwhile, the standard iPhone 15 is rumored to feature black, blue, yellow, white, and pink variants. An incremental update to the Apple Watch lineup In addition to the iPhone 15, Apple is also likely to reveal its latest smartwatch lineup — and so far, we’re not expecting many major changes. Not much is known about the update to the premium Apple Watch Ultra besides that it will reportedly retain its 49mm size and come with a new darker titanium case. But other rumors indicate that the Watch Series 9 will come with an updated S9 processor. According to Gurman, the S9 chip is based on the A15 processor that Apple introduced with the iPhone 13. This could allow for more efficiency and better battery life when compared to its predecessor, which comes equipped with the S8 chip that’s based on the same tech as the processors in the previous two Watch models. Gurman also predicts that Apple’s watch lineup could come with an ultra wideband chip, along with “various sensor and internal component upgrades,” such as an updated optical heart rate sensor. Other smaller updates expected to come with the Watch Series 9 include a pink color option and the option of a band with a magnetic buckle. We likely won’t see a new Watch SE during this year’s event, as the product appears to be on a two-year refresh cycle and was just updated last year. AirPods Pro with a USB-C-equipped charging case The iPhone 15 isn’t the only Apple device that’s expected to get the USB-C treatment. Gurman reports that Apple plans on releasing a pair of AirPods Pro with USB-C during its event in September. That tracks with a prediction from Kuo last year, who said Apple would launch AirPods with a USB-C charging case in 2023. It’s not clear whether Apple will actually make any updates to the AirPods Pro themselves, however — it may just update its charging case. In January, Kuo said Apple could ship its fourth-gen AirPods in the second half of 2024 or the first half of 2025, along with a second generation of its over-the-ear AirPods Max — both of which may also come with USB-C. Other rumors suggest Apple may launch a new pair of cheaper 99 AirPods as well. If that’s the case, we’re a full year or more away from big updates. However, the AirPods Pro are still set to get some new features through an upcoming software update. That includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and better automatic device switching. More info on iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, and more With a new iPhone and watch coming, we’ll probably get the release dates for iOS 17 and watchOS 10 during Apple’s upcoming event. As for iPadOS 17 and macOS Sonoma, we might not see them until later this fall, in line with Apple’s recent pattern of launching them in October. But the betas for each of these operating systems have been out for some time now, giving us a peek at what we can expect. While iOS 17 comes with a number of small but meaningful upgrades, including StandBy mode, voicemail transcriptions, and a Journal app, macOS Sonoma adds widgets, a game mode, and profiles on Safari. As for iPadOS 17, Apple is adding personalized lock screens, interactive widgets, the Health app, and support for external USB webcams and cameras. Apple is launching an update to Stage Manager as well, which finally lets you customize the sizes and orientations of each window on your screen. Lastly, watchOS 10 will also incorporate widgets (seeing a trend yet?) that should give you quick access to various apps. There are also new topographic mapping features, mood logging, and a couple of new watchfaces. Is there anything else? There are a few other things Apple is rumored to be working on that likely won’t make an appearance at its iPhone 15 event. That includes some new Macs and iPads, which Apple usually holds an event for in October. This fall, we’re expecting a new iMac, a 13-inch MacBook Air, and a 13-inch MacBook Pro powered by Apple’s new in-house M3 chip. On the iPad side of things, rumors suggest that we might see the release of the seventh-gen iPad Mini. But even with all these exciting launches on the horizon, all eyes are still on the 3,499 Apple Vision Pro, which is set for release early next year. We’re likely to see some updates in the months leading up to its launch. In the meantime, make sure to stay tuned to The Verge’s coverage of Apple’s iPhone 15 event.

Visual Management: At its core, a Kanban board is a visual representation of work. It typically consists of a physical or digital board with columns and cards representing tasks or work items. Each column represents a stage in the workflow, such as \\"To Do,\\" \\"In Progress,\\" and \\"Completed.\\" Work items are moved from one column to another as they progress through the workflow. Work Item Cards: Work items, represented by cards, contain essential information about the task, including a brief description, priority, assignee, and possibly a due date. This information helps team members understand the work and its status at a glance. Limiting Work in Progress (WIP): One of the fundamental principles of Kanban is limiting the number of tasks that can be in progress simultaneously. This restriction prevents overloading team members and ensures that work is completed more efficiently and with higher quality. Workflow Visualization: Kanban boards provide a clear and transparent view of the entire workflow. Team members can see the status of each task and identify bottlenecks or areas where work is piling up. This visibility enables better decision-making and resource allocation. Pull System: Kanban operates on a \\"pull\\" system, meaning that new work is pulled into the workflow only when there is capacity. This prevents overloading team members and ensures that work is completed in a steady and manageable manner. Continuous Improvement: Kanban encourages continuous improvement through regular reviews and retrospectives. Teams can analyze their workflow and make adjustments to optimize processes, reduce waste, and enhance efficiency. Collaboration: Kanban boards promote collaboration among team members. Everyone can see the work items and their progress, making it easier for team members to help each other when needed and ensuring that work doesn't get stuck due to dependencies. Adaptability: Kanban is highly adaptable and can be used in various business contexts, from software development to marketing, customer support, and project management. It's a versatile tool that can be customized to suit the specific needs and processes of different teams and organizations. Metrics and Analytics: Kanban boards often incorporate metrics and analytics, such as cycle time (the time it takes to complete a task) and lead time (the time it takes from the request to completion). These metrics help teams identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time. Remote Collaboration: Digital Kanban tools make it possible for teams to collaborate on projects even when working remotely. Team members can access the board online, update task statuses, and communicate effectively.","output":"Category | Sub-categories ------------------------------------------------ Visual Management | Kanban board Work Item Cards | Task information Limiting Work in Progress | Workflow Visualization | Pull System | Continuous Improvement | Collaboration | Adaptability | Metrics and Analytics | Cycle time, Lead time Remote Collaboration | Digital Kanban tools"},{"instruction":"چرا آموزش هوش هیجانی بر بهزیستی ذهنی دانش آموزان تأثیر مثبت دارد","output":"آموزش هوش هیجانی بر بهزیستی ذهنی دانش آموزان تأثیر مثبت دارد زیرا: 1. افزایش آگاهی: آموزش هوش هیجانی به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند تا آگاهی بیشتری در مورد خود، احساسات، ارتباطات و تعاملاتشان با اطرافیان پیدا کنند. این آگاهی به آنها کمک می‌کند تا بهتر درک کنند که چگونه احساسات خود را درک و مدیریت کنند. 2. مدیریت استرس: هوش هیجانی به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند تا راه‌های موثری برای مدیریت استرس و افزایش توانایی‌های خود در مواجهه با فشارها و موقعیت‌های دشوار پیدا کنند. آگاهی از احساسات و توانایی‌های مدیریتی در شرایط تنش‌زا، منجر به بهبود تجربه روانی و بهبود کیفیت زندگی می‌شود. 3. ارتباطات بهتر: آموزش هوش هیجانی به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند تا درک بهتری از خود و اطرافیانشان داشته باشند و در نتیجه دقت بیشتری در برقراری ارتباطات نزدیک و کیفیت بهتری در روابطشان با دیگران را تجربه کنند. ارتباطات بهتر باعث افزایش روابط مثبت و کاهش نگرانی‌ها و دردسرهای روانی می‌شود. 4. بهبود عملکرد تحصیلی: هوش هیجانی به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند با استفاده از توانایی‌های خود در مدیریت احساسات، مسائل روحی و روانی خود را کنترل کنند و بر تمرکز و عملکرد تحصیلی‌شان تمرکز کنند. این مهارت‌ها به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند تا استرس‌ها و مشکلات روحی را بهبود بخشند و تمرکز و توانایی یادگیری خود را افزایش دهند. بنابراین، آموزش هوش هیجانی به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند تا بهزیستی ذهنی خود را بهبود بخشند و زندگی روانی بهتری را تجربه کنند."},{"instruction":"دلیل اینکه هوش هیجانی باعث افزایش سرزندگی تحصیلی دانش آموزان می شود چیست","output":"افزایش سرزندگی تحصیلی در دانش آموزان ممکن است به دلایل زیر بهبود یابد: 1. موفقیت تحصیلی: هوش هیجانی به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند تا مهارت‌های لازم برای مدیریت احساسات، استرس و اضطراب تحصیلی را تقویت کنند. با داشتن این مهارت‌ها، دانش آموزان می‌توانند بهتر درک کنند که چگونه می‌توانند با استرس و چالش‌های تحصیلی روبرو شوند و بر عملکرد و بهره‌وری خود در مدرسه تمرکز کنند. این مهارت‌ها کمک می‌کند تا دانش آموزان خودرا بهتر مدیریت کنند و عملکرد تحصیلی‌شان بهبود یابد. 2. سلامت روانی: آموختن و تطبیق با مهارت‌های هوش هیجانی به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند تا استرس و اضطراب در محیط تحصیلی را کاهش دهند. با افزایش آگاهی از احساسات و استفاده از راهبردهای مدیریت آنها، دانش آموزان می‌توانند راهکارهای موثری برای مقابله با رویدادها و چالش‌های منفی تحصیلی پیدا کنند. این کاهش استرس و اضطراب منجر به بهبود سرزندگی تحصیلی می‌شود. 3. روابط مثبت: هوش هیجانی به دانش آموزان کمک می‌کند تا درک بهتری از خود و دیگران داشته باشند و در نتیجه، روابط مثبت‌تری در محیط تحصیلی ایجاد کنند. با افزایش ارتباطات مؤثر و تعاملات صحیح با دیگران، دانش آموزان محیط تحصیلی را بهتر تجربه می‌کنند و خود را در اون قبول و پذیرش می‌کنند. این احساس قبولیت و تعاملات مثبت، بهبود سرزندگی تحصیلی را تسهیل می‌کند. بنابراین، با تقویت هوش هیجانی، دانش آموزان می‌توانند استرس‌ها و اضطراب‌های تحصیلی را کاهش داده و به جای آن، سرزندگی و روانشناسی مثبت تری را در محیط تحصیلی تجربه کنند."},{"instruction":"请帮我用英文写一个店铺介绍","output":"Welcome to our store!

In the second section, the elements of the first section are self-referenced. Instead of being a binary or ternary form, Section A (exposition) is itself a compound ternary form. Essentially, Section A consists of a short introduction, followed by a simple two-part vocal idea, dynamic ideas within the framework of ternary form, and a short recapitulation of the first section, concluding with a complement. In comparison to the first section, the composer introduces the introduction in a surprising manner, leading it to a high vocal theme with a movement that creates the expectation of dynamic thematic elements. The harp harmonies, sustained notes of wind instruments, and harmonics of strings propel this section, and its climax is created not melodically, but through an increased density of texture. Chelsta then gradually establishes the thematic space of this section with ascending, inverted, and head-to-toe gestural movements towards the next section. Continuing with altered repetitions of the gestural movement, the second theme of this section is presented, developed, and leads towards the recapitulation of the first theme. In Section B, the ideas from Section A are mixed in an expanded form, and a new episode is presented. Further in this episode, the expansion of the ideas from Section A culminates in a fugato, marking the end of Section B. Following this section, a recapitulation of Section A along with a short coda concludes the piece. The composer's main goal and effort throughout all sections of the piece is emphasizing melody and expressing thematic melodies while avoiding a definite and tonal space. In this piece, the composer pays special attention to counterpoint techniques, including various imitations at different intervals, ascending and descending imitations, strettos, etc., to express his ideas. Another technique that the composer particularly focuses on is the use of staccato in different registers, especially in the bass register. It is heard through instrumentations or different doublings in different tonal areas with various orchestral colors. Additionally, the composer strives to achieve a personal musical language in the realm of free atonal space by using non-tertian chords and non-functional relationships between chords. In fact, most of the harmonic elements are derived from the initial thematic idea, presented in measures 14 to 17 (especially the chord notes in measure 17). The theme, which completes the mass in several measures melodically, holds special importance for the composer. Various combinations of fourth and second intervals are heavily utilized in chord structures, with the root of this choice attributed to the structure of the chord in measure 17. The chords are either the result of different transformations of this chord or variations of these transformations (along with other notes derived from the theme in measure 14) or simply formed under the influence of combining various fourth and second intervals. Even the combination of orchestral melodic elements and passages is influenced by this harmonic combination approach, with doubling at the second interval (usually major second and occasionally minor second), especially in the high register, accompanied by notes at a fourth interval, forming a part of the composer's technique to advance the piece."},{"instruction":"党员在组织生活会上开展批评与自我批评，列一个发言提纲，大概五百字左右。主要包括专项汇报、问题查摆、原因剖析、整改措施四个部分。","output":"尊敬的领导、亲爱的党员同志们： 大家好！我今天非常荣幸能够在组织生活会上发言，就我的工作、学习和党员身份进行批评与自我批评。 首先，我想向大家专项汇报我的工作情况。在过去的一段时间里，我承担了某项目的组织策划工作。通过与团队成员的紧密配合，我们成功完成了项目的各项任务，并取得了一定的成果。在此次工作中，我负责了项目的日常管理和进度把控，通过有效的沟通协调，确保了各项工作的顺利进行。同时，我还积极参与了项目的创新活动，提出了一些可行的建议和想法，得到了领导和团队成员的认可。 然而，在工作中我也发现了一些问题，需要对自己进行严肃的批评与反思。首先，由于工作的时间紧迫，我在一些环节上存在着粗心大意的情况，导致了一些细节上的疏漏。其次，项目中的人际关系管理上，我有时候过于强调个人主义，没有很好地发挥团队协作的优势。最后，由于对项目整体情况了解不够充分，我在一些决策上存在着依赖问题，没有做到充分独立思考。 针对上述问题的存在，我进行了认真的原因剖析。首先，时间紧迫和任务繁重使我在工作细节上失去了耐心和细致，需要进一步提高工作专注度。其次，个人主义的倾向让我忽视了团队的力量，需要进一步调整我的心态，积极参与协作、沟通和学习，发扬团队合作精神。最后，对整体情况了解不够充分的问题，则需要我加强学习和积极主动地主动获取项目相关信息，以补充和强化自己的专业知识。 为了解决上述问题，我制定了以下的整改措施：首先，我将加强工作中的细节把控，注重细致入微，确保工作的质量。其次，我将主动加强团队协作和人际关系的管理，尊重每个团队成员的意见，发挥团队的整体优势。最后，我将积极主动地学习和获取项目相关知识，不断完善自己的专业能力，从而在项目中做到更加独立思考和决策。 通过这次批评与自我批评，我深刻认识到了自身工作中存在的不足，并对此进行了全面分析。我坚信，通过我的努力和全体党员同志们的共同支持，我一定会克服自身问题，不断提高自身的工作能力和综合素质，为党和人民事业发展做出新的贡献！ 谢谢大家！"},{"instruction":"针对学习情况做一些自我批评，包括理论学习和知识学习","output":"尊敬的领导、亲爱的党员同志们： 大家好！在这次组织生活会上，我想就我自己的理论学习和知识学习情况进行一些自我批评。 首先，我要承认，在理论学习方面，我存在着学习内容选择不够全面的问题。我经常局限于一些热门话题和自己感兴趣的领域，在学习时忽视了一些基础理论知识的补充，以及一些研究成果的及时跟进。这限制了我对党的理论政策的全面理解和把握，影响了自己的宏观思维和问题解决能力。 其次，我在知识学习方面也存在一些问题。一方面，我在知识学习上缺乏系统性和连续性，经常是片面地学习某个领域的知识，而缺乏全局性的布局。另一方面，由于学习时间的不足，我对一些专业知识的了解和掌握程度相对较低，不能深入地去理解问题的本质和解决方案。 对于以上问题，我深感不安，并坚信通过自我批评和整改，我可以取得一定的进步。为此，我制定了以下的整改措施：首先，我将调整学习策略，合理安排学习内容，注重全面、系统地学习党的理论和政策。特别是要关注一些重要研究成果和党中央及上级文件，扩大知识面，全面提升自己的综合素质。 其次，我将加强学习的时间管理，将学习纳入我的日常生活中，注重坚持性和连续性。当然，为了更好地学习和掌握知识，我也将积极参加培训课程、讲座和学术交流活动，广泛借鉴他人经验，提升自己的学习水平和学科能力。 通过这次自我批评，我更加深刻地认识到了自身在理论学习和知识学习方面的不足，并且明确了个人的整改方向。我承诺将会定期进行自我反省和评估，不断完善自身的学习计划和学习方法，以提升自己的学习能力和综合素质。 谢谢大家！"},{"instruction":"(In the caverns of Terraria...)

Poland stands on the frontier of war. Its international profile and potential weight have grown due to its leadership in support of Ukraine and its prescience in warning of Russia’s revanchist intentions. So when its government delivers a formal and comprehensive foreign policy statement, as Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau did in presenting his “Exposé” to the Polish parliament last month, it’s worth a close look. Poland has seen transformational success and rapid economic growth led by a series of governments—liberal, rightist, social democratic, and odd coalitions—since overthrowing communist rule in 1989. Poland is thus poised to emerge as an agenda setter in Europe and critical ally of the United States in the face of a hostile and dangerous Russia. Poland’s domestic politics—divisive and likely to get more ugly ahead of this fall’s elections, in which the Law and Justice Party faces a challenge to its eight-year run in power—could complicate its position. Partisanship is hot in Poland, with the opposition (the liberal Civic Platform, Peasants’ Party, Poland 2050, and other parties) calling these elections a decisive moment for Polish democracy. But, with some notable exceptions, Rau’s statement of Polish foreign policy is likely to stand, whatever the results of the election. Rau put Russia’s war against Ukraine at the center of Poland’s strategy and generalized the challenge, contrasting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression with a rules-based international order that rejects great-power domination in favor of shared values. Rau cast the former as “imperialism,” seemingly with the Global South in mind, given Rau’s outreach to that part of the world. Poland’s relations abroad, Rau made explicit, will reflect its partners’ attitude toward (and actions to counter) Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Poland, Rau emphasized, is committed to “a true free world coalition” that can defend itself and to that end will devote a minimum of 3 percent of its gross domestic product to defense, including 4 percent this year. Unsurprisingly, Rau gave pride of place to Polish-US relations, stressing the United States’ role as natural leader of the free world and a European power, emphasizing bilateral security and military relations but also lauding US investment, including in nuclear energy. He was enthusiastic about Polish-UK relations and emphasized the positive in Polish-French relations. Rau was enthusiastic about NATO’s role and mission to defend allied territory from attack and, again unsurprisingly, urged NATO to “denounce” the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act that included unilateral NATO limitations on new stationing of substantial combat forces on the territory of NATO members. Finding its place in Europe Some elements of Rau’s “Exposé” covered trickier issues or striking elements. For example, Rau accurately noted “overwhelming” Polish commitment—within society and across the divided Polish political spectrum—for its continued European Union (EU) membership. That means no push for a PolExit or explicit expression of Euroskepticism, notwithstanding some support for that outlook within some parts of the Polish right, which is the Law and Justice Party’s base. However, he did not emphasize what the EU has done for Europe and Poland, i.e., bring peace after centuries of European wars and serve as the instrument for bringing Poland into core Europe rather than remaining on its periphery. Without referring directly to the heated dispute between Poland and the EU over charges that the government has politicized Poland’s judiciary (he simply notes “temporary twists and turns” in Polish-EU relations), Rau made clear Poland’s view that the EU is an association of sovereign nations and that Poland supports the principle of EU unanimity in decision making and not the existing practice of “qualified majority” voting on some issues. Rau’s assessment of the EU, while positive, lacked a full appreciation of what Poland gains from its EU membership materially and strategically. A liberal-led Polish government, if one emerges from this fall’s elections, would almost certainly seek to settle the Polish-EU dispute over the judiciary (thus restoring thirty-five billion euros in withheld EU pandemic recovery funds) and would probably be more definitive about the massive benefits Poland gains from EU membership. In a justified “we told you so” section, Rau reviewed Russia’s threatening language and actions, starting with Putin’s diatribe at the 2007 Munich Security Conference and Poland’s warnings about it at the time. He urged the international community to keep Russia “beyond the community of civilized nations” until its aggression against Ukraine ends. At the same time, and in contrast to the views of many Poles and others in Eastern Europe with direct experience of Russia’s brutality, Rau noted Russia’s democratic potential: “It can be the Russia of Andrei Sakharov and Anna Politkovskaya,” recalling the liberal-minded nuclear scientist turned democracy activist and the murdered Russian journalist. Such a Russia, Rau qualified, is possible only after Russia withdraws from Ukraine and gives up its imperial pretentions. It is striking, nevertheless, that a Polish foreign minister in a formal statement does not rule out a better relationship with a future, better Russia. This characterization skillfully sets up Poland to be a leader as Europe builds its longer-term future with Russia. In a powerful section, Rau advocated Ukraine’s EU and NATO accession “as soon as possible… because it is in Poland’s most vital, existential interest.” He explained that the long, complicated Polish-Ukrainian history could lead to “considerable frictions,” but history shows that their quarrels benefit only Moscow. Rau advocated “permanent cooperation” between Poland and Ukraine—implicitly recalling the best republican and multi-national traditions of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that included most of present-day Ukraine. Rau’s approach rests on decades of Polish rethinking about Ukraine, including a largely successful effort to turn aside nationalist narratives; importantly, this view is shared across the Polish government and within most of the political opposition, excepting only the hard right. Given its rightist government, many in Western Europe and the United States have casually associated Poland with Hungary, led by the nationalist Prime Minister Victor Orbán. This association was often exaggerated by outsiders, and it fell apart after Putin opened full-scale war against Ukraine. In contrast to Poland, Orbán’s Hungary has pursued a more ethnic-nationalist agenda with Ukraine, flirting with territorial irredentism as officials bemoan the loss of prior Hungarian territory after 1918 and display maps of Greater Hungary. Orbán often seems to make common cause with Moscow even while accepting most EU sanctions against Russia. Rau’s remarks included a sharp break with Hungary, noting their “fundamentally different” perceptions of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, a divergence that “concerns the vital interests of Poland and Europe as a whole.” For Poland, strategic divergence over Ukraine trumps some ideological compatibility. Rau also emphasized Poland’s “strategic relations” with Romania (with which Hungary has had difficulties) given their shared views about security on Europe’s eastern flank. Romania has long sought closer relations with Poland given their similar views of Putin’s Russia; this may now be at hand. The German conundrum Polish-German relations are encumbered by history, significant differences over Russia, Poles’ concern that Germany might not stand up for them should Russia turn on Poland, and Polish election-year politics. In discussing Germany, Rau walked a difficult line, addressing the differences while affirming that Poland needs Germany and gains from their alliance. Rau acknowledged the positives but went straight away to the substantively strongest Polish complaint: For decades, Germany was mistaken about the nature of Russia’s threat to Europe and “would ignore our warnings.” That is true, and it wasn’t just Polish warnings that German governments would dismiss. While serving in the US government, one of the authors often cautioned his German interlocutors about Putin’s aggressive ambitions, with mixed results. Rau welcomed the German government’s acknowledgment that its Russia policy had been mistaken and praised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his “Zeitenwende” speech of February 2022 proclaiming a strategic shift in Germany’s view of Russia. But instead of focusing on (and pocketing) that strategic shift or offering to work with Germany to develop a common approach on Russia, Rau went on to note three areas where Poland sought changes in German policy. Firstly, Rau urged Germany to support NATO renouncing the NATO-Russia Founding Act on the grounds that it includes restrictions on the stationing of NATO forces. Indeed, given Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Founding Act no longer reflects the reality of NATO-Russia relations and NATO would be on solid ground (and well-advised) to suspend or renounce it, pending a satisfactory settlement of the war in Ukraine and change in Russia’s general belligerence. This is a reasonable and relatively easy request for Warsaw to make of Berlin. Secondly, and more problematically, Rau said that a “debt owed by Germany” for its attack on and occupation of Poland during World War II is a “dramatic burden on our mutual relations.” He noted, with strong basis, that Germany’s post-World War II sense of responsibility and guilt had focused on Russia but not on Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, or other nations that arguably had suffered more. Given that Germany has rejected the Polish government’s request for compensation, Rau concluded, a Polish-German problem will persist. Rau has a historical case, but the potential for impasse is high; the issue could fuel nationalist sentiment in both countries. Exploiting anti-German sentiment in this year’s political campaign risks locking in a Polish-German dispute in ways that could damage all parties. However, one leading Polish foreign policy strategist close to the government, Slawomir Debski, head of the Polish Institute for International Affairs, has hinted at a way forward. Writing in Politico last fall, Debski defended the Polish position but then suggested that the “details” of a resolution could involve something other than simply monetary reparations, such as an education fund or endowment to help retrieve Polish art and other looted items of cultural heritage. In concept, such funds could apply to countries beyond Poland that suffered at the hands of Nazi Germany such as Ukraine. Given the heat of the Polish election campaign, the time is not ripe to explore creative approaches. But that time may come, and something like what Debski suggests may help. Thirdly, using strong language, Rau expressed skepticism about Germany taking a leading role in the continent: “Europe does not need Germany’s leadership.” At the same time, Rau made clear that he meant especially Germany’s efforts to expand qualified majority voting in the EU that could weaken Poland’s position. This contrasts with the position of previous, liberal Polish governments that sometimes urged Germany to assume more leadership, especially in opposing Russia’s aggressive designs. Taking the lead Rau’s “Exposé” presents a compelling strategic vision for his country, including commitment to a rules-based international order and a free world to defend it; enduring alliance with the United States; resistance to Russia’s aggression; support for Ukraine in its war of survival and its full integration with the EU; and, with qualifications, affirmation of Poland’s European future. Building on a generation of successful development at home and integration with Europe and NATO after overthrowing communist rule in 1989, Poland has its best chance in centuries to assume an influential, even leadership role. That European and transatlantic leadership potential can be compromised, however, if differences with the EU remain persistent and especially if tensions with Germany are locked in to create lasting chilliness. Germany seems to be in a rare moment of strategic flexibility, traumatized by the collapse of its prior assumptions about Russia and, finally, moving in the direction Poland has long advocated—European security not with Russia but against Russia, to use a powerful and apt phrase German officials are now using. Poland should take advantage of the potential to work with (and perhaps push) Germany to build a common Russia policy for Europe. The Germans may be ready and, for their part, should be eager to work with the Poles to this end. In the meantime, and probably through Poland’s elections this October, the reality of Polish-German economic and military cooperation may help stabilize their relations until a way through or around current difficulties can be found, as it needs to be. During communist rule, Poland’s democratic dissidents of all political complexions stressed that Poland belonged in an undivided Europe and the Western alliance. After coming to power after 1989, they helped make this vision real by pushing, successfully, for NATO and the EU to open their doors to Poland and Europe’s other newly free nations. As Russia wages war against Ukraine, Poland still stands, rightly, for expanding the frontiers of freedom in Europe. Hopefully, it can build on past success to achieve that worthy goal.","output":"Based on the article, here are five lessons that could be learned about leadership: 1.

Its international profile and potential weight have grown due to its leadership in support of Ukraine and its prescience in warning of Russia’s revanchist intentions. So when its government delivers a formal and comprehensive foreign policy statement, as Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau did in presenting his “Exposé” to the Polish parliament last month, it’s worth a close look. Poland has seen transformational success and rapid economic growth led by a series of governments—liberal, rightist, social democratic, and odd coalitions—since overthrowing communist rule in 1989. Poland is thus poised to emerge as an agenda setter in Europe and critical ally of the United States in the face of a hostile and dangerous Russia. Poland’s domestic politics—divisive and likely to get more ugly ahead of this fall’s elections, in which the Law and Justice Party faces a challenge to its eight-year run in power—could complicate its position. Partisanship is hot in Poland, with the opposition (the liberal Civic Platform, Peasants’ Party, Poland 2050, and other parties) calling these elections a decisive moment for Polish democracy. But, with some notable exceptions, Rau’s statement of Polish foreign policy is likely to stand, whatever the results of the election. Rau put Russia’s war against Ukraine at the center of Poland’s strategy and generalized the challenge, contrasting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression with a rules-based international order that rejects great-power domination in favor of shared values. Rau cast the former as “imperialism,” seemingly with the Global South in mind, given Rau’s outreach to that part of the world. Poland’s relations abroad, Rau made explicit, will reflect its partners’ attitude toward (and actions to counter) Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Poland, Rau emphasized, is committed to “a true free world coalition” that can defend itself and to that end will devote a minimum of 3 percent of its gross domestic product to defense, including 4 percent this year. Unsurprisingly, Rau gave pride of place to Polish-US relations, stressing the United States’ role as natural leader of the free world and a European power, emphasizing bilateral security and military relations but also lauding US investment, including in nuclear energy. He was enthusiastic about Polish-UK relations and emphasized the positive in Polish-French relations. Rau was enthusiastic about NATO’s role and mission to defend allied territory from attack and, again unsurprisingly, urged NATO to “denounce” the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act that included unilateral NATO limitations on new stationing of substantial combat forces on the territory of NATO members. Finding its place in Europe Some elements of Rau’s “Exposé” covered trickier issues or striking elements. For example, Rau accurately noted “overwhelming” Polish commitment—within society and across the divided Polish political spectrum—for its continued European Union (EU) membership. That means no push for a PolExit or explicit expression of Euroskepticism, notwithstanding some support for that outlook within some parts of the Polish right, which is the Law and Justice Party’s base. However, he did not emphasize what the EU has done for Europe and Poland, i.e., bring peace after centuries of European wars and serve as the instrument for bringing Poland into core Europe rather than remaining on its periphery. Without referring directly to the heated dispute between Poland and the EU over charges that the government has politicized Poland’s judiciary (he simply notes “temporary twists and turns” in Polish-EU relations), Rau made clear Poland’s view that the EU is an association of sovereign nations and that Poland supports the principle of EU unanimity in decision making and not the existing practice of “qualified majority” voting on some issues. Rau’s assessment of the EU, while positive, lacked a full appreciation of what Poland gains from its EU membership materially and strategically. A liberal-led Polish government, if one emerges from this fall’s elections, would almost certainly seek to settle the Polish-EU dispute over the judiciary (thus restoring thirty-five billion euros in withheld EU pandemic recovery funds) and would probably be more definitive about the massive benefits Poland gains from EU membership. In a justified “we told you so” section, Rau reviewed Russia’s threatening language and actions, starting with Putin’s diatribe at the 2007 Munich Security Conference and Poland’s warnings about it at the time. He urged the international community to keep Russia “beyond the community of civilized nations” until its aggression against Ukraine ends. At the same time, and in contrast to the views of many Poles and others in Eastern Europe with direct experience of Russia’s brutality, Rau noted Russia’s democratic potential: “It can be the Russia of Andrei Sakharov and Anna Politkovskaya,” recalling the liberal-minded nuclear scientist turned democracy activist and the murdered Russian journalist. Such a Russia, Rau qualified, is possible only after Russia withdraws from Ukraine and gives up its imperial pretentions. It is striking, nevertheless, that a Polish foreign minister in a formal statement does not rule out a better relationship with a future, better Russia. This characterization skillfully sets up Poland to be a leader as Europe builds its longer-term future with Russia. In a powerful section, Rau advocated Ukraine’s EU and NATO accession “as soon as possible… because it is in Poland’s most vital, existential interest.” He explained that the long, complicated Polish-Ukrainian history could lead to “considerable frictions,” but history shows that their quarrels benefit only Moscow. Rau advocated “permanent cooperation” between Poland and Ukraine—implicitly recalling the best republican and multi-national traditions of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that included most of present-day Ukraine. Rau’s approach rests on decades of Polish rethinking about Ukraine, including a largely successful effort to turn aside nationalist narratives; importantly, this view is shared across the Polish government and within most of the political opposition, excepting only the hard right. Given its rightist government, many in Western Europe and the United States have casually associated Poland with Hungary, led by the nationalist Prime Minister Victor Orbán. This association was often exaggerated by outsiders, and it fell apart after Putin opened full-scale war against Ukraine. In contrast to Poland, Orbán’s Hungary has pursued a more ethnic-nationalist agenda with Ukraine, flirting with territorial irredentism as officials bemoan the loss of prior Hungarian territory after 1918 and display maps of Greater Hungary. Orbán often seems to make common cause with Moscow even while accepting most EU sanctions against Russia. Rau’s remarks included a sharp break with Hungary, noting their “fundamentally different” perceptions of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, a divergence that “concerns the vital interests of Poland and Europe as a whole.” For Poland, strategic divergence over Ukraine trumps some ideological compatibility. Rau also emphasized Poland’s “strategic relations” with Romania (with which Hungary has had difficulties) given their shared views about security on Europe’s eastern flank. Romania has long sought closer relations with Poland given their similar views of Putin’s Russia; this may now be at hand. The German conundrum Polish-German relations are encumbered by history, significant differences over Russia, Poles’ concern that Germany might not stand up for them should Russia turn on Poland, and Polish election-year politics. In discussing Germany, Rau walked a difficult line, addressing the differences while affirming that Poland needs Germany and gains from their alliance. Rau acknowledged the positives but went straight away to the substantively strongest Polish complaint: For decades, Germany was mistaken about the nature of Russia’s threat to Europe and “would ignore our warnings.” That is true, and it wasn’t just Polish warnings that German governments would dismiss. While serving in the US government, one of the authors often cautioned his German interlocutors about Putin’s aggressive ambitions, with mixed results. Rau welcomed the German government’s acknowledgment that its Russia policy had been mistaken and praised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his “Zeitenwende” speech of February 2022 proclaiming a strategic shift in Germany’s view of Russia. But instead of focusing on (and pocketing) that strategic shift or offering to work with Germany to develop a common approach on Russia, Rau went on to note three areas where Poland sought changes in German policy. Firstly, Rau urged Germany to support NATO renouncing the NATO-Russia Founding Act on the grounds that it includes restrictions on the stationing of NATO forces. Indeed, given Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Founding Act no longer reflects the reality of NATO-Russia relations and NATO would be on solid ground (and well-advised) to suspend or renounce it, pending a satisfactory settlement of the war in Ukraine and change in Russia’s general belligerence. This is a reasonable and relatively easy request for Warsaw to make of Berlin. Secondly, and more problematically, Rau said that a “debt owed by Germany” for its attack on and occupation of Poland during World War II is a “dramatic burden on our mutual relations.” He noted, with strong basis, that Germany’s post-World War II sense of responsibility and guilt had focused on Russia but not on Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, or other nations that arguably had suffered more. Given that Germany has rejected the Polish government’s request for compensation, Rau concluded, a Polish-German problem will persist. Rau has a historical case, but the potential for impasse is high; the issue could fuel nationalist sentiment in both countries. Exploiting anti-German sentiment in this year’s political campaign risks locking in a Polish-German dispute in ways that could damage all parties. However, one leading Polish foreign policy strategist close to the government, Slawomir Debski, head of the Polish Institute for International Affairs, has hinted at a way forward. Writing in Politico last fall, Debski defended the Polish position but then suggested that the “details” of a resolution could involve something other than simply monetary reparations, such as an education fund or endowment to help retrieve Polish art and other looted items of cultural heritage. In concept, such funds could apply to countries beyond Poland that suffered at the hands of Nazi Germany such as Ukraine. Given the heat of the Polish election campaign, the time is not ripe to explore creative approaches. But that time may come, and something like what Debski suggests may help. Thirdly, using strong language, Rau expressed skepticism about Germany taking a leading role in the continent: “Europe does not need Germany’s leadership.” At the same time, Rau made clear that he meant especially Germany’s efforts to expand qualified majority voting in the EU that could weaken Poland’s position. This contrasts with the position of previous, liberal Polish governments that sometimes urged Germany to assume more leadership, especially in opposing Russia’s aggressive designs. Taking the lead Rau’s “Exposé” presents a compelling strategic vision for his country, including commitment to a rules-based international order and a free world to defend it; enduring alliance with the United States; resistance to Russia’s aggression; support for Ukraine in its war of survival and its full integration with the EU; and, with qualifications, affirmation of Poland’s European future. Building on a generation of successful development at home and integration with Europe and NATO after overthrowing communist rule in 1989, Poland has its best chance in centuries to assume an influential, even leadership role. That European and transatlantic leadership potential can be compromised, however, if differences with the EU remain persistent and especially if tensions with Germany are locked in to create lasting chilliness. Germany seems to be in a rare moment of strategic flexibility, traumatized by the collapse of its prior assumptions about Russia and, finally, moving in the direction Poland has long advocated—European security not with Russia but against Russia, to use a powerful and apt phrase German officials are now using. Poland should take advantage of the potential to work with (and perhaps push) Germany to build a common Russia policy for Europe. The Germans may be ready and, for their part, should be eager to work with the Poles to this end. In the meantime, and probably through Poland’s elections this October, the reality of Polish-German economic and military cooperation may help stabilize their relations until a way through or around current difficulties can be found, as it needs to be. During communist rule, Poland’s democratic dissidents of all political complexions stressed that Poland belonged in an undivided Europe and the Western alliance. After coming to power after 1989, they helped make this vision real by pushing, successfully, for NATO and the EU to open their doors to Poland and Europe’s other newly free nations. As Russia wages war against Ukraine, Poland still stands, rightly, for expanding the frontiers of freedom in Europe. Hopefully, it can build on past success to achieve that worthy goal.","output":"Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau recently delivered a comprehensive foreign policy statement, highlighting Poland's growing international profile and potential weight due to its leadership in support of Ukraine and its warnings about Russia's intentions.

He also highlighted Poland's strong relations with the United States, the UK, and France, and its commitment to NATO's role in defending allied territory.

The LFNG gene is a member of the Notch signaling pathway, which is a highly conserved pathway involved in cell fate determination, tissue differentiation, and developmental processes. This gene specifically regulates the Notch signaling pathway through glycosylation of notch receptors. Mutations or dysregulation of the LFNG gene can lead to a variety of developmental disorders, including vertebral segmentation defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and heart defects. These conditions are collectively known as LFNG-related disorders. Researchers have also found links between LFNG gene abnormalities and certain types of cancers, suggesting its potential involvement in oncogenesis. Overall, the LFNG gene and its protein product play crucial roles in embryonic development and tissue patterning, making it an important focus of study in developmental biology and medical genetics."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},F={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],R={key:0},N={key:1};function W(n,e,h,f,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",F,[(a(!0),i(y,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),x(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
