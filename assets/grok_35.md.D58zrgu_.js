We also need to determine if a rational (x) satisfies this equation. 1. **Understand the problem:**    - The fractional part ({ x }) of a real number (x) is defined as (x - lfloor x rfloor), where (lfloor x rfloor) is the greatest integer less than or equal to (x). 2. **Assume (x > 1):**    - Without loss of generality, we can take (x > 1). This simplifies our expressions for the fractional parts. 3. **Expression for fractional parts:**    - Since (x > 1), (left{ frac{1}{x} right} = frac{1}{x}), since (frac{1}{x} < 1).    - Let (x = n + f) where (n = lfloor x rfloor) and (f = { x }). This implies (f = x - n), where (0 leq f < 1). 4. **Set up the equation:**    [    left{ x right} + left{ frac{1}{x} right} = 1    ]    Substituting the expressions for the fractional parts, we get:    [    f + frac{1}{x} = 1    ]    Since (f = x - n), the equation becomes:    [    (x - n) + frac{1}{x} = 1    ] 5. **Simplify and solve for (x):**    [    x - n + frac{1}{x} = 1    ]    Multiply through by (x) to clear the denominator:    [    x^2 - nx + 1 = x    ]    Rearrange into a standard quadratic equation:    [    x^2 - (n+1)x + 1 = 0    ] 6. **Solve the quadratic equation:**    Use the quadratic formula (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) with (a = 1), (b = -(n+1)), and (c = 1):    [    x = frac{(n+1) pm sqrt{(n+1)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1}}{2 cdot 1}    ]    Simplify the expression under the square root:    [    x = frac{(n+1) pm sqrt{n^2 + 2n - 3}}{2}    ] 7. **Check integer and rational cases:**    - For (x) to be rational, (sqrt{n^2 + 2n - 3}) must be rational.    - Given (n) integers from 0, 1, 2, ...etc., let's evaluate some specific cases.    - If (n = 0):      [      x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 - 3}}{2}      ]      [      x = frac{1 pm sqrt{-2}}{2} quad text{(not real)}      ]    - If (n = 1):      [      x = frac{2 pm sqrt{1 + 2 - 3}}{2}      ]      [      x = frac{2 pm sqrt{0}}{2}      ]      [      x = 1 quad text{(does not satisfy (x > 1))}      ]    - If (n = 2):      [      x = frac{3 pm sqrt{4 + 2 - 3}}{2}      ]      [      x = frac{3 pm sqrt{3}}{2}      ]      This works, leading to:      [      x = frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} quad text{(real and irrational)}      ]    - For other (n) values, the quadratic root under the square root is non-integral and thus proves to be irrational. 8. **Conclusion:**    - After checking some cases, we find specific real values such as (x = frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}) and other irrational solutions.    - We conclude no rational (x) satisfies the original equation since (sqrt{n^2 + 2n - 3}) cannot be an integer, and thus (x) remains irrational.

The condition translates to b - (a + c) = 1. To find the smallest such number, we aim to minimize a, b, and c while satisfying the condition. The smallest value for a is 1 (since a=0 would not make it a three-digit number), and to make b - (a + c) = 1 as small as possible, we set c = 0 (the smallest value for the units digit) and b = 2 (the smallest value for the tens digit that satisfies the condition with a=1 and c=0).

Given 0 < a, c < 9 and a-c must be a square, the largest square less than 9 is 4 (since 3^2=9 is not less than 9). Therefore, a-c=4. Solving a+c=8 and a-c=4 simultaneously gives a=6 and c=2.

Part (a) The problem states whether there always exists a chord that divides any arbitrary polygon (including non-convex ones) into two equal-area parts. Let’s consider: 1. **Example Construction**:    - Consider a polygon constructed from three identical squares (halls) connected by thin, curved corridors.    - Let ( S ) be the area of the polygon.    - The squares have the area ( 0.3S ) each, and the corridors have a total area of ( 0.1S ). 2. **Analyzing Chord Intersection**:    - If a chord intersects only a corridor, then on one side of the chord, there will be two squares, whose combined area is more than half of the polygon's area.    - If a chord intersects one of the squares, it won't intersect the intersection of three corridors, leading again to one part of the polygon containing two squares, making the area greater than half. Thus, it is clear from this construction and reasoning that there can exist polygons for which no chord divides it into two exactly equal-area parts. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No, there does not always exist a chord that divides any arbitrary polygon into two equal-area parts.}} ]  Part (b) The task is to prove that any polygon can be divided by a chord into parts where each part has an area of at least (frac{1}{3}) of the polygon's area. 1. **Constructing the Argument**:    - Triangulate the polygon using diagonals that lie entirely within it. Let's consider such a triangulation.    - Each diagonal splits the polygon into two parts. Let ( AB ) be such a diagonal for which the area of the smaller part is maximal. Let ( ABC ) be a triangle adjoining ( AB ) from the larger part. 2. **Analyzing Areas**:    - Denote the area of parts adjoining sides of ( triangle ABC ) as ( S_{AB}, S_{BC}, ) and ( S_{AC} ) for sides ( AB, BC, ) and ( AC ) respectively.    - We have ( S = S_{AB} + S_{BC} + S_{AC} + S_{ABC} ).    - Assume ( S_{BC} geq S_{AC} ), and from the maximal condition for diagonal ( AB ), it follows ( S_{AB} geq S_{BC} geq S_{AC} ).    - Summing these areas provides necessary inequalities leading to at least one part having an area ( geq frac{S}{3} ). 3. **Finalizing the Proof**:    - If ( S_{AB} geq frac{S}{3} ), the problem is solved.    - If not, suppose ( X ) is a point on ( AC ) such that ( S_{AB} + S_{ABX} = frac{S}{3} ), ensuring a chord through ( B ) and ( X ) divides the polygon appropriately as required by the problem statement. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Any polygon can be divided by some chord into parts where each part has an area of at least } frac{1}{3} text{ of the polygon's area.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Consider an 8digit phone number d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5d_6d_7d_8 to be fascinating if the sequence d_1d_2d_3d_4 matches either d_2d_3d_4d_5 or d_5d_6d_7d_8 (or both).

This leads to a 1-to-1 correspondence for each selection of d_2d_3d_4d_5, so there are 10^4 = 10000 options.    - If d_1d_2d_3d_4 = d_5d_6d_7d_8, for each choice of d_1d_2d_3d_4, there is a single matching option of d_5d_6d_7d_8, resulting in another 10^4 = 10000 options. 3. **Overlap where d_2d_3d_4d_5 = d_5d_6d_7d_8:**    - Here, d_2 = d_5, d_3 = d_6, d_4 = d_7, d_5 = d_8.

Substituting ( f(x) = frac{x}{3} ) into the given functional inequality:    [    f(3x) = x quad text{and} quad f(f(2x)) = fleft(frac{2x}{3}right) = frac{2x}{9}     ]    Therefore:    [    f(3x) geq f(f(2x)) + x implies x geq frac{2x}{9} + x     ]    Simplifies to:    [    x geq frac{2x + 9x}{9} implies x geq x    ]    The inequality holds, thus suggesting ( f(x) geq frac{x}{3} ) does not contradict the given condition. 4. **Upper Bound Analysis**:    Now assume ( f(x) geq alpha x ).

These points lie on one of the four triangular faces of the tetrahedron. 2. **Choosing points on a single face**:    On each face, we have 5 points. To form a group of 4 points on the same plane, we can choose any 3 points from these 5 points and then include the point P_{1}.    The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 5 is given by the binomial coefficient:    [    binom{5}{3}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 cdot 4}{2 cdot 1} = 10    ] 3. **Three faces of the tetrahedron**:    Since this scenario occurs on each of the three faces containing the point P_{1}, the total number is multiplied by 3:    [    3 times binom{5}{3} = 3 times 10 = 30    ] 4. **Including points on the base**:    The base of the tetrahedron, which contains 5 points (excluding P_{1}), can also form groups of 4 points.

The solution proceeds as follows: 1. **Fixing the positions of the extreme values:**     - Place 1 in the top-left corner, and 9 in the bottom-right corner since 1 is the smallest and 9 is the largest:     [     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & * & *      * & * & *      * & * & 9      end{array}     ]     - Since 1 is in the smallest position and 9 is in the largest position, the other values must fill the remaining spots subject to the row and column constraints. 2. **Analyzing the possibilities for 8:**     - The second-largest number 8 must be positioned such that all numbers in its row are smaller, and all numbers in its column are larger.     - Given 1 at (1,1) and 9 at (3,3), 8 can either be in (2,3) or (3,2):     [     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & * & *      * & * & 8      * & * & 9      end{array}     quad text{or} quad     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & * & *      * & * & *      * & 8 & 9      end{array}     ] 3. **Fixing the position of 2:**     - The second smallest number 2 must be positioned such that all numbers in its row are larger, and all numbers in its column are smaller.     - Considering the possible positions for 8, 2 can be:     [     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & 2 & *      * & * & 8      * & * & 9      end{array}     quad text{or} quad     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & 2 & *      * & * & *      * & 8 & 9      end{array}     ] 4. **Placing 7 and 3:**     - Checking the remaining positions and ensuring the ordering constraints, 7 being the third-largest should be in an appropriate position.     - Analyze different cases for 7 and 3:     Case 1:     [     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & 2 & 3      * & 5 & 8      * & 6 & 9      end{array}     quad text{and} quad     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & 2 & 3      * & 4 & 8      7 & 5 & 9      end{array}     ]        Case 2:     [     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & 2 & 4      * & 5 & 8      * & 7 & 9      end{array}     quad text{and} quad     begin{array}{ccc}     1 & 2 & 4      * & 3 & 8      7 & 5 & 9      end{array}     ]        Each of these cases will yield different number arrangements which we need to account for.

A: Two isosceles triangles B: Two congruent triangles C: Two acute triangles D: Two right triangle","output":"To solve the problem, we analyze the properties of a parallelogram and how they relate to the properties of triangles.  A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel and equal in length. When we think about assembling a parallelogram from two triangles, these triangles must share a common side (which becomes one side of the parallelogram) and their other sides must be able to form the remaining part of the parallelogram while adhering to the parallelogram's properties. - **Option A: Two isosceles triangles** - While isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length, there's no guarantee that when put together, they will form a parallelogram unless they are also congruent and oriented correctly. However, the condition of being isosceles alone does not ensure this. - **Option B: Two congruent triangles** - Two congruent triangles are identical in shape and size, meaning all their corresponding sides and angles are equal. When these triangles are placed such that they share a common side, the other sides naturally form a parallelogram because the conditions of equal and parallel opposite sides are met. This is because the congruent triangles ensure that the opposite sides of the resulting shape are equal in length and parallel. - **Option C: Two acute triangles** - Acute triangles have all angles less than 90 degrees. While two acute triangles can sometimes form a parallelogram, it is not guaranteed unless they are congruent and oriented correctly. Simply being acute does not ensure the formation of a parallelogram. - **Option D: Two right triangles** - Two right triangles can form a parallelogram, particularly if they are congruent. However, the key factor is congruency, not merely being right triangles. Without the condition of congruency, two right triangles do not always form a parallelogram. Given the above analysis, the only option that guarantees the formation of a parallelogram, based on the necessity for two pairs of opposite sides to be parallel and equal in length, is when the two triangles are congruent. This is because congruent triangles will have sides that match in length and angles that match in measure, ensuring that when assembled, they form a parallelogram. boxed{text{B}}"},{"instruction":"Given the sets M={x|(x+3)(x1)leqslant 0} and N={x|log_{2}xleqslant 1}, determine Mcup N= ( ) A: [3,2] B: [3,2) C: [1,2] D: (0,2]","output":"**Analysis** This problem primarily tests the application of sets, which is a common question type in high school exams and is considered a basic question. **Step-by-step Solution** 1.

Vitya's strategy involves symmetry with respect to this point (O). 3. **Symmetrical Moves**:    On each of Vitya's turns, he marks a point symmetrical to the point marked by Kolya relative to (O). This ensures each mark maintains the properties required by the game's rules – the points must be vertices of a convex polygon. 4. **Convex Polygon Formation**:    This symmetry ensures that the points marked by both players will always form a convex polygon. Thus, after each pair of moves (one by Kolya and one by Vitya), the marked points can be connected to form a convex polygon. 5. **Central Symmetry**:    When six points are marked (three by Kolya and three reflected symmetrically by Vitya), they form a centrally symmetric hexagon around point (O). This hexagon is a convex shape and follows the game's rule. 6. **Finite Number of Moves Contraction**:    In future steps, the points to be marked will lie within one of the six triangular sections formed by the sides and the extensions of the sides of this hexagon. Hence, the number of possible moves becomes limited to the vertices within these triangular sections. 7. **Critical Conclusion**:    Since Kolya will run out of possible symmetry-respecting moves (due to the finite number of vertices), there will eventually be a turn where Kolya cannot make a valid move, leading to his loss. # Conclusion: By correctly employing the symmetrical strategy, Vitya ensures that Kolya eventually cannot continue marking points validly.

When adding two binary numbers, the number of 1's in the sum (a + b) is given by (s(a+b) = s(a) + s(b) - h), where (h) is the number of carries that occur during the addition. 3. **Condition for the Problem:**    The condition (s(a+b) = s(a) + s(b) - 1) implies that exactly one carry occurs during the addition of (a) and (b). 4. **Counting Carries:**    To count the number of pairs ((a, b)) that result in exactly one carry, we need to consider the binary digits of (a) and (b). Each bit position can be either 0 or 1, and we need to determine how many combinations of these bits result in exactly one carry. 5. **Binary Digits and Carries:**    For each bit position, there are three possible combinations that do not produce a carry (00, 01, 10) and one combination that does produce a carry (11). Since we need exactly one carry, we need to choose one bit position to have the combination (11) and the remaining bit positions to have one of the three non-carry combinations. 6. **Counting Combinations:**    - There are 6 bit positions (since (0 leq a, b < 64)).    - We choose one of these 6 positions to have the combination (11), and the remaining 5 positions to have one of the three non-carry combinations.    Therefore, the number of ways to choose one position for the carry is (binom{6}{1} = 6).    For each of the remaining 5 positions, there are 3 choices (00, 01, 10).

Solution: We start by evaluating each term individually: - The first term is -2^2. Remember, the negative sign affects only the 2, not the squaring, so we have: -2^2 = -(2cdot2) = -4. - The second term is (-frac{1}{2})^4.

Thus, we can write S as:    [    S = x + left( x^2 + 2x^2 right) + left( x^3 + 2x^3 + 3x^3 right) + left( x^4 + 2x^4 + 3x^4 + 4x^4 right) + cdots + left( x^n + 2x^n + 3x^n + cdots + nx^n right)    ] 4. Each column in the above expanded form represents a geometric series with common ratio x and having n, n-1, n-2, ldots, 1 terms respectively. 5. Using the geometric series sum formula (sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a frac{r^n - 1}{r-1}) (where a is the first term and r the common ratio), we apply it for each series in S:    [    S = frac{x(x^n - 1)}{x-1} + frac{2x^2 (x^{n-1} - 1)}{x-1} + frac{3x^3 (x^{n-2} - 1)}{x-1} + cdots + frac{n x^n (x - 1)}{x-1}    ]     6. Simplifying this, we get:    [    S = frac{x}{x-1} left[ x^n + 2 x^{n-1} + 3 x^{n-2} + cdots + n x - (1 + 2x + 3x^2 + cdots + nx^{n-1}) right]    ]     7. Simplifying further, we separate the terms within the square brackets − considering that the first part sums to (frac{n(n+1)}{2} x^n):    [    S = frac{x}{x-1} left[ frac{n(n+1)}{2} x^n - left( 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + cdots + nx^{n-1} right) right]    ] 8. Now, let's define ( S' ) as the sum of the second part:    [    S' = 1 + left( x + x right) + left( x^2 + x^2 + x^2 right) + cdots + left( x^{n-1} + x^{n-1} + cdots + x^{n-1} right)    ] 9. Each series in ( S' ) is itself a geometric series, and summing these up we get:    [    S' = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{nx^k - 1}{x-1}    ] 10. This simplifies to:     [     S' = frac{1}{x-1} left[ n x^n - (1 + x + x^2 + cdots + x^{n-1}) right] = frac{1}{x-1} left[ n x^n - frac{x^n - 1}{x-1} right]     ] 11. Simplifying further, we have:     [     S' = frac{n x^n}{x-1} - frac{x^n - 1}{(x-1)^2}     ] 12. Substituting back into our original expression for S, we get:     [     S = frac{frac{n(n+1)x^n}{2} - S'}{x-1}     ]      13. Combining the terms and simplifying, the final expression for S becomes:     [     S = frac{n(n+1) x^n}{2(x-1)} - frac{n x^n}{(x-1)^2} + frac{x (x^n - 1)}{(x-1)^3}     ]      Thus, this is the simplified version of the polynomial ( S ).  Using the boxed form to highlight the final answer:    [ boxed{S = frac{n(n+1) x^n}{2(x-1)} - frac{n x^n}{(x-1)^2} + frac{x (x^n - 1)}{(x-1)^3} } ]"},{"instruction":"f ( f(x) = frac{20}{4 + 4x} ), what is the value of ( left[f^{1}(5)right]^{2} )?","output":"Start by expressing ( x ) in terms of ( f^{-1}(x) ) using the given function: [ f(f^{-1}(x)) = frac{20}{4 + 4f^{-1}(x)} ] We known that ( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x ) for all ( x ) in the domain of ( f^{-1} ), so: [ x = frac{20}{4 + 4f^{-1}(x)} ] Substituting ( x = 5 ): [ 5 = frac{20}{4 + 4f^{-1}(5)} ] Solving for ( f^{-1}(5) ): [ 20 = 5(4 + 4f^{-1}(5)) ] [ 20 = 20 + 20f^{-1}(5) ] [ 0 = 20f^{-1}(5) ] [ f^{-1}(5) = 0 ] Then: [ left[f^{-1}(5)right]^{-2} = 0^{-2} = boxed{text{undefined}} ]"},{"instruction":"Anya, Galya, Dasha, Sonya, and Lena arrived at the “Formula of Unity” camp from different cities: Kursk, Vologda, Novorossiysk, Petrozavodsk, and Cheboksary.

Thus, the equation becomes:     [     (a+1) left(a^{2} + a + 1 right) cdots left( frac{a^{n+1} - 1}{a - 1} right) = frac{a^{m+1} - 1}{a - 1}     ] 4. Rewriting this, we have:    [    (a+1)left(a^{2}+a+1right) cdots (a^{n}+a^{n-1}+cdots+1) = frac{a^{m+1}-1}{a-1}    ] 5. Now, consider the product form for the left-hand side terms:    [    frac{left(a^2-1right)}{a-1} cdot frac{left(a^3-1right)}{a-1} cdots frac{left(a^{n+1}-1right)}{a-1} = frac{a^{m+1}-1}{a-1}    ] 6. This simplifies to:    [    left(a^{2} - 1right) left(a^{3} - 1right) cdots left(a^{n+1} - 1right) = left(a^{m+1} - 1right) (a - 1)^{n-1}    ] 7. According to Zsigmondy's theorem, for integers (a > 1) and n > 1, if (a, m+1) neq (2, 6), then there exists at least one prime factor of (a^{m+1} - 1) that does not divide any a^k - 1 for (k < m+1). 8. Therefore, by applying Zsigmondy's theorem under these conditions that ((a, m+1)neq(2, 6)):    If these hypotheses hold, a^{m+1} - 1 should not have any repeat factors present in the other terms of the equation unless (a) and (m+1) are specific values i.e., when ( (a, m+1) = (2, 6) ). 9. Thus, we only consider the case ((a, m+1) = (2, 6)):     - This implies (a = 2) and (m = 5)     - For (a = 2), we substitute back to our equation to verify it:       \`\`\`       3 cdot 7 cdot 15 cdots (2^{n+1}-1) = 63       \`\`\`     - Simplifying and solving for possible (n) in this specific case does not generate additional solutions. **Conclusion:** No other solutions exist beyond (a = 1) if we are solving for positive integers, meaning (a = 1) and ((n+1)-1) = m-1) Rightarrow m = (n+1)!-1). Hence, we conclude: [boxed{(1, (n+1)!-1, n)}]"},{"instruction":"Tanya scored 20 out of 25 on her math quiz. What percent did she score?

The present value of the bill can be calculated as: PV = FV - TD PV = 1680 - 180 PV = Rs. 1500 The interest (I) on the present value for the time period until the bill is due can be calculated using the simple interest formula: I = P * R * T / 100 Where: P = Present Value (PV) R = Annual Interest Rate (in %) T = Time in years Since the bill is due 9 months hence, we need to convert the time period to years: T = 9 months / 12 months per year = 3/4 years Now, we know that the interest (I) is the same as the true discount (TD) because, at maturity, the present value plus the interest should equal the face value of the bill. Therefore, we have: I = TD I = Rs. 180 Substituting the values into the simple interest formula, we get: 180 = 1500 * R * (3/4) / 100 To find the annual interest rate (R), we solve for R: 180 = (1500 * 3/4 * R) / 100 180 = (1125 * R) / 100 18000 = 1125 * R R = 18000 / 1125 R = 16 Therefore, the annual interest rate is boxed{16%}  per annum."},{"instruction":"The negation of the proposition The cube of every even number is even is __________.","output":"Since the negation of the proposition \\"The cube of every even number is even\\" is that there exists an even number whose cube is odd, the answer is:  boxed{text{there exists an even number whose cube is odd}}"},{"instruction":"Find the solution to the equation (3x + 5[x]  2017 = 0), where for any real number (x), ([x]) represents the greatest integer less than or equal to (x).","output":"1.

The first equation ( y = sqrt{a^{2} - x^{2} - 2x - 1} ) represents a semicircle with radius (|a|) and centered at ((-1, 0)). 7. Each of these horizontal lines will intersect the semicircle twice (once on the left half and once on the right half) except for some special cases where they might be tangent to the circle. 8.

For the semicircle to exactly intersect these lines 7 times, the radius must be calibrated such that it intersects these two horizontal lines exactly seven times total. 10. Thus, we need to find ( a ) such that the top-most horizontal line intersected by the semicircle (while still non-negative and valid for the function) corresponds to ( y = frac{(7-1)pi}{6} = frac{6pi}{6} = pi ). 11. Therefore, the radius (|a|) must equal the distance from the center ((-1, 0)) of the semicircle to the top-most intersection which is at ( y = pi ). 12.

Therefore, the general term of the sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = -17 + 3(n - 1) = 3n - 20.  (2) The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d).  Substituting the values of a_1 and d into the formula, we get S_n = frac{n}{2}(2(-17) + (n-1)3) = frac{n}{2}(-34 + 3n - 3) = frac{n}{2}(3n - 37).  To find the minimum value of S_n, we can differentiate this expression with respect to n and set the derivative to zero. Alternatively, completing the square gives us insight into the minimum value. The derivative approach yields frac{dS_n}{dn} = frac{1}{2}(3(2n) - 37) = 3n - frac{37}{2}.  Setting the derivative to zero to find the critical point, 3n - frac{37}{2} = 0 Rightarrow n = frac{37}{6}.  Since n must be an integer, we choose n=6 because it is the nearest integer to frac{37}{6}. Substituting n=6 into the expression for S_n, we find S_6 = frac{6}{2}(3(6) - 37) = 3(18 - 37) = 3(-19) = -57.  The minimum value of S_n for n being a positive integer is therefore boxed{S_6 = -57}."},{"instruction":"Given an ellipse dfrac {x^{2}}{m^{2}}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{n^{2}}=1(m > 0,n > 0) whose right focus coincides with the focus of the parabola y^{2}=8x, and its eccentricity is dfrac {1}{2}, then the equation of this ellipse is (　).

To find the extreme value, we first find the derivative of f(x): [f'(x)=x-frac{1}{x}=frac{x^2-1}{x}] Analyzing the sign of f'(x): - For xin left(0,1right), f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is decreasing. - For xin left(1,+infty right), f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing.

We don't know which day it was, but we can subtract the average daily practice time to estimate the lost hours. The average daily practice time is the total scheduled hours divided by the number of practice days (5). Average daily practice time = Total scheduled hours / Number of practice days Average daily practice time = 25 hours / 5 days Average daily practice time = 5 hours So, we can estimate that the team lost about 5 hours of practice due to rain.

Karen packs a peanut butter sandwich on 2 days, so there are C(5,2) = 10 possible combinations for those days.  She packs a ham sandwich on the remaining 3 days. Since the peanut butter days are chosen randomly, any of the 3 remaining days could be the day she packs cake. Therefore, there are 3 choices for the cake day out of the 5 days. The probability that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day is given as 12%, or 0.12. This means that out of the 3 days she packs a ham sandwich, there is a 0.12 probability that one of those days will also be the cake day. To find the number of days she packs cookies, we need to find the number of days that are neither the cake day nor the peanut butter sandwich days. Since there is a 12% chance that the cake is packed with a ham sandwich, and there are 3 ham sandwich days, we can calculate the expected number of days when the cake is packed with a ham sandwich as follows: Expected number of cake with ham sandwich days = 3 days * 0.12 = 0.36 days Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can infer that there is 1 day when she packs a ham sandwich and cake together. Now, since there is only 1 cake day, the remaining 4 days are when she packs cookies. However, since 2 of those days are peanut butter sandwich days, we subtract those to find the cookie days that are not peanut butter days: Number of cookie days = Total days - Cake day - Peanut butter sandwich days Number of cookie days = 5 - 1 - 2 Number of cookie days = 2 Therefore, Karen packs cookies on boxed{2}  days."},{"instruction":"Determine the smallest possible positive product when three different numbers from the set {4, 3, 1, 5, 6} are multiplied. text{(A)} 15 qquad text{(B)} 18 qquad text{(C)} 20 qquad text{(D)} 24 qquad text{(E)} 60","output":"To find the smallest possible positive product from multiplying three different numbers from the set {-4, -3, -1, 5, 6}: 1. **Identify possible combinations that yield a positive product**:    - Two negatives and one positive: Possible combinations are (-4, -3, 5), (-4, -3, 6), (-4, -1, 5), (-4, -1, 6), (-3, -1, 5), and (-3, -1, 6). 2. **Calculate the products**:    - (-4) times (-3) times 5 = 12 times 5 = 60    - (-4) times (-3) times 6 = 12 times 6 = 72    - (-4) times (-1) times 5 = 4 times 5 = 20    - (-4) times (-1) times 6 = 4 times 6 = 24    - (-3) times (-1) times 5 = 3 times 5 = 15    - (-3) times (-1) times 6 = 3 times 6 = 18 3. **Determine the smallest product**:    The smallest positive product is from the combination (-3) times (-1) times 5 = 15.

The original ratio of detergent to water is 20 : 50, which simplifies to 2 : 5. Halving this ratio gives us 1 : 2.5 (since 2 / 2 = 1 and 5 / 2 = 2.5). Now, we need to combine the new ratios of bleach to detergent (3 : 20) and detergent to water (1 : 2.5) to get the overall new ratio.

Hence, ( BL = CL ) and ( triangle BLC ) is isosceles with median (and altitude) ( LM ), thus line ( LM ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( BC ). 3. **Relative Positions and Geometrical Analysis:**    - Therefore, ( O ) also lies on line ( LM ). Given that arc ( BLC ) is less than ( pi ), points ( O ) and ( L ) are on opposite sides of line ( BC ). 4. **Menelaus' Theorem Application:**    - We apply Menelaus’ theorem in ( triangle AML ) with transversal ( QS ):      [      frac{MS}{AS} cdot frac{AQ}{QL} cdot frac{LO}{OM} = 1.      ]    - Additionally, we apply Menelaus’ theorem in ( triangle LOQ ) with transversal ( MS ):      [      frac{QS}{OS} cdot frac{OM}{LM} cdot frac{AL}{AQ} = 1.      ]    - Multiplying these two relations gives:      [      frac{MS}{AS} cdot frac{QS}{OS} cdot frac{AL}{QL} cdot frac{LO}{LM} = 1. quad ( star )      ] 5. **Inserting Problem Constraints:**    - From the problem, ( frac{MS}{AS} cdot frac{QS}{OS} = frac{2}{3sqrt{3}} ).    - The triangle ( LOC ) is isosceles (as ( OL ) and ( OC ) are radii of the circumcircle), and since ( angle LOC = frac{pi}{3} ), it must actually be equilateral.

Since a cake is 100 g heavier than a piece of bread, the weight of a cake is B + 100 grams. We know that 4 cakes weigh 800 g, so we can write the equation for the total weight of 4 cakes: 4 * (B + 100) = 800 Now, let's solve for B: 4B + 400 = 800 4B = 800 - 400 4B = 400 B = 400 / 4 B = 100 So, a piece of bread weighs 100 grams. Now we can find the weight of a cake: Cake weight = B + 100 Cake weight = 100 + 100 Cake weight = 200 grams Now we can calculate the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread: Total weight = (3 * Cake weight) + (5 * Bread weight) Total weight = (3 * 200) + (5 * 100) Total weight = 600 + 500 Total weight = 1100 grams Therefore, the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is boxed{1100}  grams."},{"instruction":"A sequence {a_n} satisfies {a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{1{a_n}}, and a_{8}=2.

From the given relation, overrightarrow{AO} = frac{2}{5}(overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{AC}), we can substitute 2overrightarrow{AM} for overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{AC} to obtain overrightarrow{AO} = frac{4}{5}overrightarrow{AM}. Thus, points A, O, and M are collinear, and specifically, the distance from A to O is four times the distance from O to M, so we have AO = 4OM. Since M is the midpoint of BC and O is the center of the circumcircle, OM is the radius of the circumcircle and also the perpendicular bisector of BC. Therefore, angle BOM = 2angle BAM due to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which tells us that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Then, since AO is a radius and OM is a radius, angle BOM = angle BAC, which means they subtend the same arc. Now, using the definition of cosine for an angle in a right triangle, we have: cos angle BAC = cos angle BOM = frac{OM}{OB} = frac{OM}{OA} = frac{1}{4}.

Length of the train = 360 m Length of the platform = 150 m Total distance to cover = Length of the train + Length of the platform Total distance to cover = 360 m + 150 m = 510 m Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the distance. Speed of the train = 45 km/hr To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s Speed of the train in m/s = 45 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed of the train in m/s = 45 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 45 * (5 / 18) Speed of the train in m/s = 45 * 5 / 18 Speed of the train in m/s = 225 / 18 Speed of the train in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the platform using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to pass the platform = Total distance to cover / Speed of the train in m/s Time to pass the platform = 510 m / 12.5 m/s Time to pass the platform = 40.8 seconds Therefore, it will take the train approximately boxed{40.8}  seconds to pass the platform."},{"instruction":"f the cost price of 25 articles is equal to the selling price of 18 articles and the merchant offers a 5% discount on the selling price, what is the net percentage of profit or loss that the merchant makes after considering the discount?","output":"Let's assume the cost price (CP) of each article is 1. Therefore, the cost price of 25 articles is 25. Since the cost price of 25 articles is equal to the selling price (SP) of 18 articles, the selling price of 18 articles is also 25. This means the selling price of each article is 25/18. Now, the merchant offers a 5% discount on the selling price. The discount on each article is 5% of (25/18), which is (5/100) * (25/18) = 25/360 per article. The discounted selling price (DSP) of each article is the selling price minus the discount, which is (25/18) - (25/360). To simplify, we find a common denominator, which is 360. So we have: DSP = (20 * 25/360) - (25/360) DSP = (19 * 25/360) Now, we need to find the net profit or loss percentage. The profit or loss is calculated based on the cost price. Since the cost price of each article is 1, and the discounted selling price is (19 * 25/360), the profit or loss per article is: Profit/Loss per article = DSP - CP Profit/Loss per article = (19 * 25/360) - 1 To find the net percentage of profit or loss, we divide the profit or loss per article by the cost price and multiply by 100: Net percentage of profit/loss = (Profit/Loss per article / CP) * 100 Let's calculate the exact value: Profit/Loss per article = (19 * 25/360) - 1 Profit/Loss per article = (475/360) - 1 Profit/Loss per article = (475/360) - (360/360) Profit/Loss per article = (475 - 360) / 360 Profit/Loss per article = 115/360 Net percentage of profit/loss = (115/360 / 1) * 100 Net percentage of profit/loss = (115/360) * 100 Net percentage of profit/loss = 11500/360 Net percentage of profit/loss = 31.94% Since the value is positive, the merchant makes a net profit of boxed{31.94%}  after considering the discount."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = x^2 + bx, its graph has a tangent line (l) at point A(1, f(1)) that is parallel to the line 3x  y + 2 = 0.

First, let's find the other dimension of the field using the area and the length of the uncovered side: Area = length * width 1200 sq. feet = 50 feet * width width = 1200 sq. feet / 50 feet width = 24 feet So, the dimensions of the field are 50 feet by 24 feet. Now, let's consider the fencing options. We need to fence three sides, two of which are 24 feet and one is 50 feet. The total length of fencing needed is: Total length = 2 * 24 feet + 50 feet Total length = 48 feet + 50 feet Total length = 98 feet Since material A has a maximum span of 100 feet, we could use it to fence the entire field. However, we should also consider the cost of using material B for the longer side (50 feet) and material A for the shorter sides (2 * 24 feet). Cost using only material A: Cost = 8/foot * 98 feet Cost = 784 Cost using material B for the 50-foot side and material A for the 24-foot sides: Cost for material B = 12/foot * 50 feet Cost for material B = 600 Cost for material A = 8/foot * (2 * 24 feet) Cost for material A = 8/foot * 48 feet Cost for material A = 384 Total cost = Cost for material B + Cost for material A Total cost = 600 + 384 Total cost = 984 Comparing the costs, using only material A would be the cheaper option at 784, as opposed to using a combination of materials A and B, which would cost 984.

Next, we'll find the points A and B where the circle intersects the y-axis. For the intersections with the y-axis, we have x=0.

Therefore, the total amount of fertilizer needed for 20 acres is 20 acres * 400 gallons/acre = 8000 gallons. 4. Janet can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. 5.

We need to determine whether this condition is related to the requirement that a<0 for the point to be in the first quadrant. Now, if a>-1, it does not automatically ensure that a<0; a could be, for instance, -0.5, which does satisfy a<0, but it could also be 0.5, which does not.

In this sense, a>-1 is a sufficient condition for ensuring the point is in the first quadrant because whenever this inequality holds (a>-1), and a is indeed less than zero, it is guaranteed that the point is in the first quadrant.

Therefore, we multiply the probabilities of these two independent events:    [    text{Probability of failing the first attempt} times text{Probability of succeeding the second attempt} = 0.3 times 0.7    ]     4. **Calculating the Probability**:    [    0.3 times 0.7 = 0.21    ]     Thus, the probability of Zhang Hua passing the challenge on the second attempt is boxed{0.21}. # Part 2: Probability of Passing the Challenge 1. **Probability of Not Passing the Challenge**: To not pass the challenge, Zhang Hua must fail all three attempts.

We can group these vectors in pairs such that each pair is orthogonal to all other pairs. 3. **Choosing the Vectors**:    - One way to ensure orthogonality is to use the standard basis vectors ( e_1, e_2, ldots, e_n ) of ( mathbb{R}^n ).    - We can choose ( v_1 = v_2 = e_1 ), ( v_3 = v_4 = e_2 ), and so on.

Let ( L ) denote the LHS: [ L = 3.3998 cos^{4} alpha - 4 cos^{3} alpha - 8 cos^{2} alpha + 3 cos alpha + 1 ] Next, we rewrite the LHS in a more convenient form by factoring some terms: [ L = 8 cos^{2} alpha (cos^{2} alpha - 1) - 4 cos alpha (cos^{2} alpha - 1) - cos alpha + 1 ] Using the identity (cos^{2} alpha - 1 = -sin^{2} alpha), we substitute it in: [ L = 8 cos^{2} alpha (-sin^{2} alpha) - 4 cos alpha (-sin^{2} alpha) - cos alpha + 1 ] [ L = -8 cos^{2} alpha sin^{2} alpha + 4 cos alpha sin^{2} alpha - cos alpha + 1 ] Now, let's transform ( sin^{2} 2alpha ) and ( sin alpha sin 2alpha ) into the LHS: [ L = -2 sin^{2} 2 alpha + 2 sin alpha sin 2 alpha - cos alpha + 1 ] Next, we utilize the identities: [ sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha ] so, [ sin^{2} 2 alpha = (2 sin alpha cos alpha)^{2} = 4 sin^{2} alpha cos^{2} alpha ] Therefore: [ -2 sin^{2} 2 alpha = -2 times 4 sin^{2} alpha cos^{2} alpha = -8 sin^{2} alpha cos^{2} alpha ] and, [ 2 sin alpha sin 2 alpha = 2 sin alpha times 2 sin alpha cos alpha = 4 sin^{2} alpha cos alpha ] The expression simplifies to: [ -8 sin^{2} alpha cos^{2} alpha + 4 sin^{2} alpha cos alpha - cos alpha + 1 ] Since this is already simplified, let's recognize this term under trigonometric manipulation: [ = -1 + cos 4 alpha + cos alpha - cos 3 alpha - cos alpha + 1 ] Finally, by regrouping these terms and simplifying: [ L = -2 sin left( frac{7 alpha}{2} right) sin left( frac{alpha}{2} right) ] This reaffirms the given equality and completes the transformation from LHS to RHS.

Now, we need to arrange these five people in a row such that no two people wearing the same color clothes are adjacent to each other. How many different arrangements are possible?","output":"Let's consider the possible arrangements. We can start by placing the person wearing blue clothes, as there is only one person with blue clothes and they serve as a natural separator. 1. First, place the person with blue clothes in one of the 5 possible positions. There are 5 choices. 2. Then, we'll place the people wearing red and yellow clothes such that they are not next to someone wearing the same color. Let's denote the person wearing blue as B, and consider it as a separator. The individuals wearing red and yellow will be denoted as R and Y respectively.    - If B is at either end, the pattern would be B-R-Y-R-Y or B-Y-R-Y-R. There are 2 possibilities for the colors (switching R and Y), and since B can be on either end, this gives us 2 * 2 = 4 arrangements.    - If B is not at either end, B acts as a separator splitting the remaining 4 positions into three parts: one on the left of B, B itself, and two on the right of B (or vice versa). Here, the pattern would be R-Y-B-Y-R or Y-R-B-R-Y. Again, there are 2 possibilities for the colors (switching R and Y), and there are 3 places where B can be positioned (2nd, 3rd, or 4th position). This gives us 2 * 3 = 6 arrangements. 3. Combine the possibilities above:    - When B is at either end: 4 arrangements.    - When B is not at either end: 6 arrangements. 4. Multiply these by the number of ways we can place the person with blue clothes: 5 times (4 + 6). 5. Calculate the total number of arrangements: 5 times 10 = 50. However, in this approach, we have incorrectly included the arrangements where two people with the same color (either red or yellow) are adjacent. We need to subtract these cases. 6. Consider placing two reds together with B in between, like B-RR-Y or Y-RR-B. There are 2 such cases for the red pair, and similarly, 2 for the yellow pair. This adds up to 4 incorrect cases. 7. For each of these 4 cases, there is only 1 way to place the people (since the pairs cannot separate). So, we have 4 incorrect cases in total. 8. Subtract the incorrect cases from the total number of initial arrangements: 50 - 4 = 46. Looks like we have made a mistake, as this calculated answer of 46 is not present in the given options. There's likely been an error in our earlier subtraction of incorrect arrangements. We will need to carefully recount. Going back to the previous step, we assumed there was only 1 incorrect arrangement for each of the 4 cases with B in between like B-RR-Y or Y-RR-B. However, we missed considering different placements for B. B can be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. That is, we have Y-B-RR, B-RR-Y, or RR-B-Y for reds and similarly for yellows. Thus, there are actually 2 (colors) times 3 (positions for B) = 6 incorrect cases. We should then correct our subtraction: - Subtract the corrected count of incorrect cases from the total number of initial arrangements: 50 - 6 = 44. Checking again, we realize that this answer of 44 still does not match any of the given options. So, there's still an error in our reasoning. Since this approach isn't yielding the correct result, we'll attempt a different strategy to ensure accuracy. We'll enumerate the possible positions of the person wearing blue and follow the same step-by-step format, being careful not to overcount or undercount arrangements. 1. If B is in position 1 or 5 (the ends), the pattern will be B-X-X-X-X. There are 2 spots for R and 2 spots for Y. The first red can go in either of the 4 positions, and the second red must go in one of the remaining 3 positions.    This makes a total of 4 times 3 = 12 arrangements. Since B can be at either end, we multiply this number by 2, resulting in 12 times 2 = 24 arrangements. 2. If B is in position 2 or 4, the pattern will be X-B-X-X-X or X-X-X-B-X. Since we already have B as a separator, we must place R and Y alternately. Without loss of generality, assuming we start with R, we have two choices for placing R, and then Y would be fixed. However, we can also start with Y giving us another two choices.    Therefore, there are 2 (choices for starting with R or Y) times 2 (positions for B) = 4 arrangements. 3. If B is in position 3, the pattern is X-X-B-X-X. Similar to the previous case, R and Y must alternate and there are 2 choices for placing R and Y initially, for a total of 2 arrangements. Now, we combine all the possibilities: - When B is at either end (positions 1 or 5): 24 arrangements. - When B is not at either end (positions 2 or 4): 4 arrangements. - When B is in the middle (position 3): 2 arrangements. The total number of different arrangements would be 24 + 4 + 2 = 30. We find that we have made another error. Let's correct our approach. We'll use a process of elimination to find the right count: 1. When B is at position 3, as mentioned, there are 2 choices for placing R and Y initially, for a total of 2 arrangements. 2. When B is at position 2 or 4, we'll examine the arrangements with R-Y-B-Y-R and Y-R-B-R-Y. With B in position 2, Y cannot be in position 1; therefore, R must be in position 1. With R also in position 4, Y must occupy positions 1 and 5. This leads to only one valid arrangement for B in position 2 due to the constraints, which is R-Y-B-R-Y.    Similarly, with B in position 4, R cannot be in position 5; therefore, Y must be in position 5. With Y also in position 1, R must occupy positions 2 and 3. This results in only one valid arrangement for B in position 4, which is Y-R-Y-B-R. 3. Combining these corrected counts, we have:    - B at position 1 or 5: 24 arrangements.    - B at position 2 or 4: Each has 1 arrangement, adding up to 2 arrangements.    - B at position 3: 2 arrangements. 4. Now we sum them up correctly: 24 + 2 + 2 = 28.

We will solve the two cases separately: **Case 1:** When dfrac{2-x}{x} geq 0, which occurs when x leq 2. We must then have dfrac{2-x}{x} > dfrac{x-2}{x}. However, since the left side is the absolute value, this case will always hold true for any x in the domain. **Case 2:** When dfrac{2-x}{x} < 0, which occurs when x > 2. For this case, we rewrite the inequation as -dfrac{2-x}{x} > dfrac{x-2}{x}, which simplifies to dfrac{x-2}{x} > -dfrac{x-2}{x}. This means that dfrac{x-2}{x} must again be negative.

Since the trains are running in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 120 kmph + 80 kmph Relative speed = 200 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s Relative speed in m/s = 200 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 200 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 200000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 55.56 m/s (approximately) Now, we know the time taken to cross each other is 9 seconds, so we can find the combined length of the two trains (L_combined) using the formula: L_combined = Relative speed * Time L_combined = 55.56 m/s * 9 s L_combined = 500.04 meters We are given the length of the second train (L_second) as 240.04 meters, so we can find the length of the first train (L_first) by subtracting L_second from L_combined: L_first = L_combined - L_second L_first = 500.04 meters - 240.04 meters L_first = 260 meters Therefore, the length of the first train is boxed{260}  meters."},{"instruction":"w many 6digit numbers are there such that: a)The digits of each number are all from the set   {1,2,3,4,5} b)any digit that appears in the number appears at least twice ?

This implies:     - A piece originally located on a diagonal must move to a diagonal to the right (and potentially below) the current one due to the increased number. 5. **Sum of coordinates observation**:          - Initially, if a piece is on (i, j), it contributes i + j to a sum of coordinates.     - The total initial sum for the placement is:       [       sum_{k=1}^{8} (i_k + j_k)       ]       This sum equals 2 cdot (1 + 2 + dots + 8), as each row and column has one piece which sums the row and column indices.

The distance covered while crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform.

In the second cup, milk is filled up to 4/5th of its volume, so the volume of milk in the second cup is (4/5)V. The remaining volume in each cup is filled with water.

Since 4 is even, this operation alters the parity of \`+\` in the grayed cells by an even number.          - **Column Operation**: Similarly, changing the sign of a whole column alters the signs of four cells in the column. This changes the parity by an even number in the same way as the row operation.     - **Diagonal Operation**: Regardless of diagonal chosen, changing the sign of each cell along it will also alter an even number of cells. This changes the parity by an even number as well. 5. **Conclusion**:    - Each of the operations always changes the count of \`+\` signs in the grayed regions by an even number.    - Initial number of \`+\` marks in these cells is odd (5).    - To achieve all cells containing \`+\` marks, the count of \`+\` marks in the grayed cells must be even (6), which contradicts due to parity remaining even with each operation.

We need to demonstrate the Euler's formula:    [    n - m + ell = 2    ] 2. **Base Case for Trees**:    Suppose ( m leq n - 1 ). In this case, the graph ( G ) forms a tree. For a tree, it is known that ( m = n - 1 ). Hence,    [    n - m = n - (n - 1) = 1    ]    A tree has exactly one face (the exterior). Therefore, ( ell = 1 ).

Therefore, the chord ( A_1B_1 ) is the required chord that passes through the point ( K ) and subtends the angle ( alpha ) at the center of the circle. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Calculate the value of (15 times frac{1}{3} + 45 times frac{2}{3}).","output":"By the distributive property, (15 times frac{1}{3} + 45 times frac{2}{3}) can be rewritten by factoring out the common term (15), as follows: [ 15 times frac{1}{3} + 45 times frac{2}{3} = 15 left( frac{1}{3} + 3 times frac{2}{3} right) ] Simplifying inside the parentheses: [ frac{1}{3} + 3 times frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{3} + 2 = frac{1}{3} + frac{6}{3} = frac{7}{3} ] Now, calculate the entire expression: [ 15 times frac{7}{3} = 5 times 7 = boxed{35} ]"},{"instruction":"The value of 30+80000+700+60 is: (A) 87090 (B) 807090 (C) 800790 (D) 80790 (E) 87630","output":":  1.

This is because the distances ( AM ) and ( CM ) from ( M ) to the points where the tangents touch the circle are equal. 2. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem:**    According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, the angle bisector ( MB ) of ( angle AMC ) divides the opposite side ( AC ) into segments that are proportional to the other two sides:    [    frac{|AM|}{|MC|} = frac{|AB|}{|BC|}    ]     3. **Introducing Point ( K ):**    By the properties of the bisector of the external angle theorem, the extension of the tangents intersect the line ( AC ) in a constant point ( K ), where:    [    frac{|AK|}{|KC|} = frac{|AB|}{|BC|}    ] 4. **Construct the Circle:**    Now, to find the geometric locus of ( M ), we construct a circle using ( BK ) as the diameter.

This means that every non-empty subset of natural numbers has a least element.    - Begin by selecting the smallest element in {s_{n}}. Let this be s_{k_1}.    - Now consider the subsequence of {s_n} that occurs after s_{k_1}.    - From this subsequence, select the smallest element and denote it by s_{k_2}. Note that k_2 > k_1.    - Continue this process indefinitely by always picking the smallest element from the remaining subsequence.        This construction yields an increasing sequence {s_{k_i}} where s_{k_1} leq s_{k_2} leq s_{k_3} leq cdots. Thus, the lemma is proven. blacksquare 2. **Applying the Lemma to the Problem**    Returning to the original problem, we have three infinite sequences {a_{i}}, {b_{i}}, {c_{i}} comprised of natural numbers. We need to show that there exist indices p > q such that a_{p} geq a_{q}, b_{p} geq b_{q}, and c_{p} geq c_{q}. 3. **Step-by-Step Construction:**    - Start with sequence {a_{i}}.    - By applying the auxiliary lemma, we can extract an infinite monotonically increasing subsequence from {a_{i}}. Let this subsequence be {a_{i}^{prime}}.    - Now consider the sequences {b_{i}} and {c_{i}} restricted to the indices corresponding to {a_{i}^{prime}}. Denote these restricted sequences by {b_{i}^{prime}} and {c_{i}^{prime}} respectively. 4. **Second Application of the Lemma:**    - Apply the auxiliary lemma to the subsequence {b_{i}^{prime}} to obtain its monotonically increasing subsequence {b_{i}^{primeprime}}.    - Next, consider the sequence {c_{i}} restricted to the indices corresponding to {b_{i}^{primeprime}}, denoted by {c_{i}^{primeprime}}. 5. **Third Application of the Lemma:**    - Finally, apply the auxiliary lemma to the sequence {c_{i}^{primeprime}} to extract its monotonically increasing subsequence {c_{i}^{primeprimeprime}}. 6. **Conclusion:**    By following this step-by-step process, we have constructed subsequences {a_{i}^{primeprimeprime}}, {b_{i}^{primeprimeprime}}, {c_{i}^{primeprimeprime}} where each subsequence is monotonically increasing.     - Therefore, for any indices q and p such that q < p, we have:      [      a_{q} leq a_{p}, quad b_{q} leq b_{p}, quad c_{q} leq c_{p}.      ] Thus, we have proven the existence of the required indices p and q. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Tony bought 3 lottery tickets and chose identical numbers on each ticket.

Let's define a function varphi(x) = sin x - x. We find its derivative as varphi'(x) = cos x - 1. Since cos x leq 1 for all x, we have varphi'(x) leq 0 for all xin(0,frac{pi}{2}). This implies varphi(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (0,frac{pi}{2}). Therefore, for any x in this interval, varphi(x) < varphi(0) = 0, which means sin x - x < 0 or equivalently sin x < x. Hence, we have proved that f(x) < 1 for xin(0,frac{pi}{2}).  Part (2) For proving f(x) > g(x), we consider F(x) = f(x) - g(x) = frac{sin x - axcos x}{x}. Since F(-x) = F(x), it suffices to show F(x) > 0 for xin(0,frac{pi}{2}). This reduces to showing H(x) = sin x - axcos x > 0 in the same interval. - When a leq 0, sin x > 0 and -axcos x geq 0 in (0,frac{pi}{2}), making H(x) > 0. - For 0 < a leq 1, H'(x) = (1-a)cos x + axsin x geq 0, making H(x) monotonically increasing. Since H(0) = 0, H(x) > 0 for x > 0. - When a > 1, H'(0) = 1-a < 0 and H'(frac{pi}{2}) = frac{pi a}{2} > 0. There exists x_0 in (0,frac{pi}{2}) where H'(x_0) = 0, and H(x) < 0 for x in (0,x_0). Thus, the range of a for which f(x) > g(x) always holds is a in (-infty, 1].  Part (3) Given sin x < x from part (1) and when a=1, f(x) > g(x), we have frac{sin x}{x} > cos x, leading to sin x > xcos x. For G(x) = [f(x)]^2 - g(x) = frac{sin^2x - ax^2cos x}{x^2}, we need to show G(x) > 0 for xin(0,frac{pi}{2}). This simplifies to showing h(x) = sin^2x - ax^2cos x > 0. - When a leq 0, h(x) > 0 is obvious. - For 0 < a leq 1, h(x) geq sin^2x - x^2cos x. Let r(x) = sin^2x - x^2cos x, then r'(x) > 0, making r(x) monotonically increasing. Thus, r(x) > r(0) = 0, and h(x) > 0. - When a > 1, h(x) < x^2(1-acos x). For cos x in (frac{1}{a}, 1), h(x) < 0, which does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, the range of a for which [f(x)]^2 > g(x) always holds is a in (-infty, 1].

Minimizing with respect to s > 0, set ( s = sqrt{2 ln n} ): [ mathrm{E} xi_{n: n} leq sqrt{2 ln n} ] 4.

Now, considering the case of independent xi_1, xi_2, ldots sim mathscr{N}(0,1) and let varphi(x) be the density of xi_1. For all varepsilon > 0: [ sum mathrm{P}left(xi_{n: n} leq sqrt{2 ln n} - varepsilonright) = sum left[1 - mathrm{P}left(xi_{1} > sqrt{2 ln n} - varepsilonright)right]^{n} ] [ leq sum expleft[- n mathrm{P}left(xi_{1} > sqrt{2 ln n} - varepsilonright)right] ] The above term is bounded when approximating mathrm{P}left(xi_{1} > xright) as: [ mathrm{P}left(xi_{1} > xright) approx frac{x varphi(x)}{1 + x^2} ] Thus: [ sum exp[- h(sqrt{2 ln n}, varepsilon)] < infty ] By the second part of the Borel-Cantelli lemma, this ensures that: [ frac{lim}{n} left[xi_{n: n} - sqrt{2 ln n}right] geq 0 quad text{ a.s. } ] Combining the results from (4) and (5), we get: [ boxed{0} ] 6.

Thus, we have     [    11^a equiv 2^a pmod{3}.    ]    Since (c^2) is either 0 or 1 modulo 3 (as squares can only be 0 or 1 modulo 3):    - If (a) is odd, then (2^a equiv 2 pmod{3}), leading (c^2 equiv 2 + 3^b pmod{3}). However, neither 2 nor 2 + 3^b (where b is any integer) can be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3.    - Therefore, (a) must be even. Let (a = 2k). 2. **Step 2: Simplifying the original equation**    Substitute (a = 2k), the equation transforms into:    [    11^{2k} + 3^b = c^2.    ]    Factoring the right-hand side, we have:    [    3^b = (c - 11^k)(c + 11^k).    ]     3. **Step 3: Factoring into Powers of 3**    Let (c - 11^k = 3^v) and (c + 11^k = 3^u) where (u geq v geq 0) and (u + v = b).

So we infer (v = 0):    [    2 times 11^k = 3^u - 1.    ] 4. **Step 4: Use Order and Zsigmondy's Theorem**    The order of 3 modulo 11, denoted by (omega), is the smallest integer such that (3^omega equiv 1 pmod{11}). We calculate:    [    3^5 equiv 1 pmod{11}    ]    Thus, (omega = 5), which means (omega mid u).

Therefore:    [    2 times 11^k = 3^5 - 1 = 242 implies k = 2.    ] 5. **Step 5: Solution Verification**    - With (k = 2), we get (a = 2k = 4).    - Likewise, with (u = 5), it follows (b = 5).    - Finally, solving for (c), we have:    [    c = frac{3^5 + 1}{2} = frac{243 + 1}{2} = 122.    ] **Conclusion:** The solution is ((a, b, c) = (4, 5, 122)).

Each tromino on the grid intersects two adjacent rows because a tromino covers three cells in an L shape. If a tromino intersects (H_1), it must also intersect (H_2) since the rows are adjacent. 3. **Equality of Intersections**:    If the first row (H_1) intersects a certain number of trominoes, say ( k ), then (H_2) must also intersect exactly ( k ) trominoes. This is because if (H_2) intersects a tromino not intersecting (H_1), it would intersect more trominoes than (H_1), violating our initial condition. 4. **Formation of Horizontal Strips**:    Extending this argument for all pairs of adjacent rows, we conclude that the trominoes intersecting the first row and second row must form a horizontal strip of (2 times 12). This strip is fully covered by trominoes. 5. **Vertical Intersections**:    Analogously, consider the first and second columns from the left of the grid, denoted as (V_1) and (V_2), respectively. Each tromino, by the same logic, must intersect two adjacent columns. Thus, if ( V_1 ) intersects ( k ) trominoes, ( V_2 ) must also intersect exactly ( k ) trominoes. 6. **Formation of Vertical Strips**:    Now, extending this argument for all pairs of adjacent columns, the trominoes intersecting the first column and second column must form a vertical strip of (12 times 2).  7. **Intersection in Lower Left Subgrid**:    Consider the lower left (2 times 2) subgrid of the (12 times 12) board. Following the previous deductions, the trominoes intersecting the leftmost two columns must intersect the bottom two rows. Therefore, all trominoes covering this (2 times 2) subgrid entirely overlap within this region. 8. **Contradiction**:    It is impossible to cover a (2 times 2) subgrid entirely with L-shaped trominoes because each L-shaped tromino consists of exactly three cells.

The work rate for the original number of laborers is W/6 days, because they were supposed to finish the work in 6 days.

Here, n=6 and r=3. - Therefore, the number of possibilities in this case is A{}_{6}^{3} = frac{6!}{(6-3)!} = frac{6 times 5 times 4}{1} = 120. **Case 2: Last digit is 5.** - In this case, since 5 is used as the last digit, we have 5 remaining numbers (excluding 0 since it can be used in other positions) and the 5 itself cannot be reused. - We need to choose 2 more numbers from the remaining 5 (excluding the first digit which cannot be 0) to form the number, which gives us 5A{}_{5}^{2} possibilities. - The calculation for this case is 5A{}_{5}^{2} = 5 times frac{5!}{(5-2)!} = 5 times frac{5 times 4}{1} = 100. **Step 2: Calculate the total number of possibilities.** To find the total number of such four-digit numbers, we add the possibilities from both cases: Total number of possibilities = Possibilities when last digit is 0 + Possibilities when last digit is 5 = 120 + 100 = 220.

Step 1: Initialize the sequence with terms (a_{1}) and (a_{2}) such that they do not form a prime sum. For instance, let (a_{1}=1) and (a_{2}=3).

Continuing this construction by induction, we see that we can always extend our sequence in this manner without introducing any \\"prime sums.\\" **Conclusion**: By continuing this process indefinitely, we generate an infinite sequence of natural numbers where no consecutive subset forms a prime sum. From this construction, it is evident that all natural numbers enter this sequence exactly once. If there existed a set of numbers forming a prime sum in some arrangement, the above construction contradicts it.

Therefore, the line 3x-4y+12=0 intersects the x-axis at A(-4,0) and the y-axis at B(0,3).   Since the circle we are looking for has AB as its diameter,   the circle has the midpoint C of AB as its center, and the radius is frac{1}{2}|AB|.

To find a simpler form, we rewrite the recurrence relation in terms of (b_n = a_n - 1):     [     a_n = b_n + 1.     ]     Substituting (a_n = b_n + 1) into the recurrence relation:     [     3((b_{n+1} + 1)) + (b_n + 1) = 4     ]     Simplifying gives us:     [     3b_{n+1} + 3 + b_n + 1 = 4     ]     [     3b_{n+1} + b_n + 4 = 4     ]     [     3b_{n+1} + b_n = 0     ]     or     [     3b_{n+1} = -b_n     ]     which leads to:     [     b_{n+1} = -frac{1}{3}b_n.     ] 4. Recognizing that (b_{n}) is a geometric sequence with the first term (b_1 = a_1 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8) and common ratio (-frac{1}{3}), we have:     [     b_n = 8 left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1}.     ] 5. Therefore, the terms of the original sequence ( {a_n} ) are:     [     a_n = b_n + 1 = 8 left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} + 1.     ] 6. Now, we need to find the sum of the first ( n ) terms, (S_n):     [     S_n = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n.     ]     Note that:     [     S_n - n = sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - 1).     ] 7. Since (a_i - 1 = 8 left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{i-1}) for each (i):     [     S_n - n = 8 + 8 left(-frac{1}{3}right) + 8 left(-frac{1}{3}right)^2 + cdots + 8 left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1}.     ]     This is a geometric series with the first term (8) and common ratio (-frac{1}{3}):     [     S_n - n = 8 left[1 + left(-frac{1}{3}right) + left(-frac{1}{3}right)^2 + cdots + left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1}right].     ] 8. The sum of a geometric series ( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k ) is given by:     [     sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k = frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}.     ] 9. Substituting (r = -frac{1}{3}), we get:     [     S_n - n = 8 left(frac{1 - left(-frac{1}{3}right)^n}{1 + frac{1}{3}}right).     ] 10. Simplifying:     [     S_n - n = 8 left(frac{1 - left(-frac{1}{3}right)^n}{frac{4}{3}}right)     ]     [     S_n - n = 8 cdot frac{3}{4} left(1 - left(-frac{1}{3}right)^nright)     ]     [     S_n - n = 6 left(1 - left(-frac{1}{3}right)^nright)     ]     [     S_n = 6 - 6 left(-frac{1}{3}right)^n + n.     ] 11. Given (left|S_n - n - 6right| < frac{1}{125}), we have:     [     left| -6 left(-frac{1}{3}right)^n right| < frac{1}{125}.     ]     This simplifies to:     [     6 left|-frac{1}{3}right|^n < frac{1}{125}     ]     [     6 left(frac{1}{3}right)^n < frac{1}{125}.     ] 12. Dividing both sides by 6:     [     left(frac{1}{3}right)^n < frac{1}{750}.     ] 13. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:     [     n lnleft(frac{1}{3}right) < lnleft(frac{1}{750}right).     ] 14. Since (lnleft(frac{1}{3}right) = -ln(3)), we have:     [     -n ln(3) < lnleft(frac{1}{750}right).     ]     [     n ln(3) > -lnleft(frac{1}{750}right).     ] 15. Simplifying further using properties of logarithms:     [     lnleft(frac{1}{750}right) = -ln(750).     ]     [     n ln(3) > ln(750).     ] 16. Hence:     [     n > frac{ln(750)}{ln(3)}.     ] 17. Evaluating the logarithms:     [     n > frac{ln(750)}{ln(3)} approx frac{6.6201}{1.0986} approx 6.03.     ] 18.

We aim to show that there exists at least one white segment that intersects all black segments and one black segment that intersects all white segments. 2. **Contradiction Hypothesis**:    Assume for the sake of contradiction that no single white segment intersects all ( 2k-1 ) black segments. Therefore, for each black segment, there exists at least one white segment it does not intersect. 3. **Application of Pigeonhole Principle**:    By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least ( k ) black segments where each black segment does not intersect with different white segments. Since there are ( 2k-1 ) black segments, each avoiding a unique white segment, this still leaves us with white segments meeting the minimum intersection requirement with the rest of the black segments. 4. **Identifying Extremes**:    Consider the left endpoints of all these ( 2k-1 ) black segments and ( 2k-1 ) white segments.  5. **Analyzing Possible Positions**:    Let's analyze these positions in a step-by-step manner:    - Identify the rightmost left endpoint among the white segments.    - This white segment should be such that it intersects with at least ( k ) black segments at their right endpoint (due to our assumption). Let's denote the endpoint as ( A ). 6. **Contradiction Derivation**:    If the rightmost endpoint of the chosen segment ( A ) still fails to intersect at least ( k ) other black segments, there must be ( k ) black segments to its right:    - From our earlier point, the left endpoint ( A ) of the white segment positioned in the rightmost position needs to intersect with ( k ) black segments at least.    - If it doesn't, and this contradicts the assumption, particularly because it should intersect either by meeting or encroaching into the space occupied by another segment. 7. **Ultimate Conclusion**:    Hence, ( A ) cannot fail to intersect at this critical junction we contradict ourselves.    - Similarly, this configuration ensures the intended white segment’s requirement:    - There cannot exist a configuration avoiding ( k ) segments overlap in its turn among the segment chosen.

Let's analyze the upper bound of ( N ). If ( N ) were a four-digit number, the maximum sum of its digits could be ( 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 ). Hence, the largest possible product ( 26 cdot S(N) ) if ( N ) were a four-digit number, would be:    [    26 times 36 = 936    ]    Clearly, any four-digit number ( N ) would be greater than this product. Therefore, ( N ) must be at most three-digit.

However, for this to hold:    [    25 cdot S(N) equiv 0 pmod{9}    ]    Since 25 and 9 are coprime ((gcd(25,9) = 1)), the only way ( 25 cdot S(N) ) is divisible by 9 is if ( S(N) ) itself is divisible by 9. 3. **Divisibility by 26**:        We also know from the problem statement that ( N ) must be divisible by 26. Therefore, ( N ) should be a multiple of:    [    LCM(9, 26) = 9 times 26 = 234    ] 4. **Final Verification**:        ( N ) that fit these criteria are multiples of 234 within the range specified, namely ( N < 10000 ).

Therefore, the function relationship between y (the amount of money to pay) and x (the monthly electricity consumption in kilowatt-hours) is given by:   [   y = 0.6x   ] - **For x > 200:**   The first 200 kilowatt-hours are billed at 0.6 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and the excess consumption over 200 kilowatt-hours is billed at 0.65 yuan per kilowatt-hour. Thus, the function relationship is:   [   y = 0.6 times 200 + 0.65(x - 200)   ]   Simplifying this expression gives:   [   y = 120 + 0.65x - 130 = 0.65x - 10   ] Therefore, the function relationships are y = 0.6x for 0 leqslant x leqslant 200, and y = 0.65x - 10 for x > 200.

Let the angular measure of this arc be denoted by ( alpha ). 3. **Symmetry and Inscribed Angles**:    We know that the angular measure of an arc intercepted by two sides of a regular triangle is symmetric.

The discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation kx^{2}-kx+4=0 is given by Delta=b^{2}-4ac=(-k)^{2}-4(k)(4)=k^{2}-16k.

Does there exist a 1992gon with side lengths (1, 2, 3, ldots, 1992) circumscribed about a circle? Answer the same question for a 1990gon.","output":"To show that there exists a 1992-gon with side lengths 1, 2, 3, ldots, 1992 that is circumscribed about a circle, let's generalize and write n instead of 1992. The problem entails proving the existence of a convex polygon with n sides, side lengths {1,2,ldots,n} in some order, where the polygon is circumscribable about a circle. We will start with a lemma regarding such polygons:  Lemma: There exists a tangent n-gon A_{1}A_{2} ldots A_{n} with sides A_{1}A_{2} = a_{1}, A_{2}A_{3} = a_{2}, ...,A_{n}A_{1} = a_{n} if and only if the following system has a solution in positive reals: [ begin{cases} x_{1}+x_{2} = a_{1},  x_{2}+x_{3} = a_{2},  vdots  x_{n}+x_{1} = a_{n}. end{cases} ] **Proof:** 1. **Existence of Polygon Implies Solution:** - Suppose there exists such a polygon A_{1}A_{2}ldots A_{n}. - Let the side A_{i}A_{i+1} touch the inscribed circle at point P_{i} (where A_{n+1}=A_{1}).  - Define x_i as the distance from vertex A_i to the point of tangency P_i such that A_{1}P_{1} = P_1 A_2 = x_1 and so on. Using these definitions: [ begin{align*} x_{1} + x_{2} & = A_{1}P_{1} + A_{2}P_{1} = a_1,  x_{2} + x_{3} & = A_{2}P_{2} + A_{3}P_{2} = a_2,  &   vdots  x_{n} + x_{1} & = A_{n}P_{n} + A_{1}P_{n} = a_n. end{align*} ] Thus, (x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}) is a positive solution to our system (1). 2. **Solution Implies Existence of Polygon:** - Now, suppose the system ( (1) ) has a positive solution (x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}). - Construct a polygonal line touching a circle of radius r at points P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{n} with A_1 P_1 = x_1 and A_i P_{i-1} = A_i P_i = x_i for all i. Observe that: [ OA_1 = OA_{n+1} = sqrt{x_1^2 + r^2} ] Denote: [ f(r) = sum_{i=1}^{n} angle A_{i}OA_{i+1} = 2 left( sum_{i=1}^{n} arctan frac{x_i}{r} right) ] Given that f(r) is continuous and as r rightarrow infty, f(r) rightarrow 0, and as r rightarrow 0, f(r) rightarrow infty. Because f(r) is continuous and strictly increasing, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists some r such that f(r) = 360^circ: Hence, A_1 A_2 ldots A_{n} is a closed, simple polygon which is tangent to the circle. 3. **Finding a Specific Solution for n = 1992 = 4k:** - For n=4k, having sides arranged:   [   a_{i} =    begin{cases}    i & text{if } i equiv 1,2 pmod{4},    i+1 & text{if } i equiv 3 pmod{4},    i-1 & text{if } i equiv 0 pmod{4}.   end{cases}   ]   We can solve the equation system:    [   begin{cases}   x_{i} = frac{1}{2} & text{for } i equiv 1 pmod{4},    x_{i} = frac{3}{2} & text{for } i equiv 3 pmod{4},    x_{i} = i - frac{3}{2} & text{for } i in {0, 2 pmod{4}}.   end{cases}   ]   Therefore, there is a solution for (x_1,...,x_n) for which the polygon exists. 4. **Case for n=4k+2:** - For n = 4k + 2, there is no equivalent configuration in which the sum required by (1) balances, as the sum of a_{i} arranged in such a way would not be evenly distributable among the required number scheme, resulting in unreachable sums in (1). **Conclusion:** - For n=1992, a side lengths configuration exists that satisfies the conditions (boxed). - For n=1990, no valid configuration exists meeting the conditions.

Do there exist two triangles, each inscribed in the other?","output":"To demonstrate that there do not exist two triangles satisfying the given conditions, we will employ an indirect proof (proof by contradiction). 1. **Lemma Utilization**:     - Let's consider the following lemma: If a line intersects two sides of a triangle at points that are not vertices of the triangle, then the line does not pass through any vertex of the triangle.     - This lemma is evident because the intersection of two lines is a unique point. So, if a line intersects two sides of a triangle at non-vertex points, this line cannot pass through any of the triangle's vertices. 2. **Assumption**:     - Assume to the contrary that there exist two triangles, ( H_1 ) and ( H_2 ), each inscribed in the other. That is, the vertices of ( H_1 ) lie on the extended sides of ( H_2 ), and vice versa. 3. **Inscribed Condition**:     - Consider that ( H_1 )'s vertices cannot all be on the three distinct lines of ( H_2 )'s sides. Using the lemma on ( H_1 )'s side lines and ( H_2 ), it would entail that none of ( H_1 )'s sides passes through any vertex of ( H_2 ). Clearly, the vertices of ( H_1 ) cannot all lie on the same side line of ( H_2 ). 4. **Vertex Placement**:     - Therefore, the vertices of ( H_1 ) must be arranged such that one of them is on each side line of ( H_2 ). Let's denote the vertices of the triangles as ( H_1 = A_1B_1C_1 ) and ( H_2 = A_2B_2C_2 ).     - By the lemma again, the sides ( A_1B_1 ) and ( A_1C_1 ) of ( H_1 ) do not pass through any vertex of ( H_2 ). Hence, each vertex of ( H_2 ) should lie on the line ( B_1C_1 ).    5. **Contradiction**:     - This configuration (where all vertices of ( H_2 ) lie on a single line ( B_1C_1 )) is impossible for a triangle, as the triangle's vertices cannot all be collinear. This forms a contradiction to our initial assumption. **Conclusion**: - Hence, the assumption that two such triangles ( H_1 ) and ( H_2 ) exist, each inscribed in the other, is false. Therefore, there do not exist two triangles satisfying the given conditions.

Consequently, the number of tokens in each pile is always odd (since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd). 3. **Target Condition:**     - We aim to achieve 2022 piles with each having 2022 tokens. Notably, 2022 is an even number. 4. **Tracking Piles' Properties:**     - Consider the parity of the number of piles with an even number of tokens.     - Initially, since each prime number p_i is odd, the number of piles with an even number of tokens is 0, which is even.    5. **Impact of Operations on Parity:**     - **Splitting a pile**: Suppose we split a pile of k tokens:         - The pile can be divided into two parts a and b such that a + b = k - 1 (since one token is added to either a or b).         - Depending on the parity of a and b, one of these parts will necessarily be even or odd.     - **Merging two piles**: Suppose we merge piles with k_1 and k_2 tokens:         - The new pile will have k_1 + k_2 + 1 tokens.         - If both k_1 and k_2 are either both even or both odd, k_1 + k_2 + 1 will always be odd if both are odd and even if both are even.    6. **Transition of Even-Pile Parity:**     - The critical insight is that these operations do not change the parity of the number of piles with an even height.     - Initially, the number of piles with an even number of tokens is even.     - To achieve the target condition where each pile has 2022 tokens, we would need all 2022 piles to have an even number of tokens.    7. **Parity Conflict:**     - We start with an even number (0) of piles having an even number of tokens.     - To end with 2022 piles (an even number) having an even number of tokens, the parity of the number of piles with an even number of tokens needs to be persistently even. 8. **Conclusion:**     - Since both the initial state and the operations maintain the parity of the even-tokens piles and it contradicts the goal, it is impossible to achieve the condition where all 2022 piles have 2022 tokens each. Thus, we cannot end up with 2022 piles each containing 2022 tokens. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Jeff orders a Halloween costume.

According to the information given, 16 delegates arrived with pre-printed name badges. So, the number of delegates without pre-printed name badges is D - 16. Half of these remaining delegates made their own hand-written name badges. Therefore, the number of delegates who made hand-written name badges is (D - 16) / 2. We are also told that there were 10 delegates not wearing name badges at all. So, the total number of delegates can be calculated by adding the ones with pre-printed name badges, the ones with hand-written name badges, and the ones without any name badges: Total delegates = Delegates with pre-printed badges + Delegates with hand-written badges + Delegates without badges D = 16 + (D - 16) / 2 + 10 Now, let's solve for D: D = 16 + (D/2 - 8) + 10 D = 16 + D/2 - 8 + 10 D = D/2 + 18 To solve for D, we need to get all the D terms on one side of the equation: D - D/2 = 18 (2D - D) / 2 = 18 D/2 = 18 Now, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for D: D = 18 * 2 D = 36 Therefore, there were boxed{36}  delegates in total at the convention."},{"instruction":"f sinalpha + sinbeta = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, find the range of values for cosalpha + cosbeta.","output":"Let cosalpha + cosbeta = t.

Can Alec choose two cells that share a common edge or vertex such that the sum of the numbers written in these cells is a multiple of 4?","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions**:    Let us assume that Alex cannot find two adjacent cells (sharing a common edge or vertex) in the (22 times 22) grid such that the sum of the integers in these cells is a multiple of 4. 2. **Modulo 4 Representation**:    We will consider each number in the (22 times 22) grid modulo 4. Therefore, every number in the grid can only be one of the following residues: 0, 1, 2, 3.  3. **Distribution Hypothesis**:    Since there are 484 cells in the grid and each residue (0, 1, 2, 3) appears equally often, we should have exactly:    [    frac{484}{4} = 121 text{ cells with residue } 0, , 121 text{ cells with residue } 1, , 121 text{ cells with residue } 2, , 121 text{ cells with residue } 3.    ] 4. **Partitioning the Grid**:    Divide the (22 times 22) grid into (11 times 11) blocks of (2 times 2) squares. Since each (2 times 2) square contains 4 cells, we need to analyze their filling.     5. **Hypothetical Constraints**:    Given our assumption, in each (2 times 2) square, there can be at most one cell with residue 0 and at most one cell with residue 2. Similarly, by symmetry, this also extends to cells with residues 1 and 3. 6. **Residue Allocation in (2 times 2) Squares**:    If each (2 times 2) block should meet the hypothetical constraint, considering the number of cells in each block:    - There should be exactly one residue 0 and one residue 2 in each block,    - The remaining two cells must either be both 1 or both 3, to avoid achieving a sum that is a multiple of 4 with their neighboring 0 or 2. 7. **Contradiction Detection**:    Hence, in each (2 times 2) block, we would have:    [    1 , (0) + 1 , (2) + 2 , (1 text{ or } 3)    ]    There should be:    [    11 times 11 = 121 text{ such } 2 times 2 text{ blocks in the grid}.    ]    This arrangement must sustain not only the sum constraints but also the specific number count across the entire grid. Each combination would need to fit perfectly into the total count of each residue:    - 121 total cells with residue 0,    - 121 total cells with residue 2,    - 121 total cells with residue 1,    - 121 total cells with residue 3.    But leftover cells (since only pairs of 1 and pairs of 3 in each block) lead to disproportion in number requirement of 1s and 3s, contradicting the total count requirement exactly fitting each of those blocks’ constraints. 8. **Conclusion**:    This contradiction implies our initial assumption must be wrong. Therefore, Alex can indeed find two adjacent cells in the (22 times 22) grid whose sum of the numbers is a multiple of 4.     # Final Answer: (boxed{text{Yes}})"},{"instruction":"*.tiktokd.org *.sgsnssdk.com *.bytedns.net *.bytedance.net *.bytecdn.cn *.byteoversea.net *.hypstarcdn.com *.ibyteimg.com *.isnssdk.com *.myqcloud.com *.pstatp.com *.toutiao.com *.musically.ly *.musemuse.cn *.ibytedtos.com *.tiktok.org *.byteoversea.com *.snssdk.com *.ttwstatic.com *.muscdn.com *.worldfcdn.com *.tiktok.com *.musical.ly *.tiktokv.com *.tiktokcdn.com From your answers, taken off the above domains.","output":"After removing the specified domains from the original list, the remaining unique domains are: 1. tiktokcdn-eu.com 2. tiktokcdn-us.com 3. tiktokder.com 4. tiktokstalk.com 5. ttlivecdn.com 6. ttoversea.net 7. ttoverseaus.net 8. worldfcdn2.com 9. akamai.net 10. atomile.com 11. footprint.net 12. ttdns2.com 13. tiktokw.eu 14. tiktokglobalshop.com 15. liveplay.myqcloud.com 16. c.bytefcdn-oversea.com 17. c.worldfcdn.com 18. c.worldfcdn2.com 19. tiktokcdn-eu.net 20. bytefcdn-oversea.com 21. s.bytetcdn.com 22. bytedance.map.fastly.net 23. tiktokcdn.com.rocket-cdn.com 24. byteoversea.com 25. tiktokcdn-us.com.c.footprint.net 26. musical.ly.lan 27. rocket-cdn.com 28. spbycdn.com 29. taobao.com 30. taobao.net 31. tbsandbox.com 32. amap.com 33. 189.cn 34. aliyuncs.com 35. 21cn.com 36. cmbchina.com 37. ovc.gslb.rocket-cdn.com These domains remain distinct from the ones you've chosen to exclude."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (When I was still in high school, people would sometimes call me \\"blind as a bat\\" - seeing as I was prone to tripping over books almost all the time.

This is due to the nature of client scripts, which are generally designed to interact with the form fields of the primary record rather than the fields of related list records or embedded lists. Yet, you can achieve requirements for field mandatory conditions through a combination of server-side scripting and client-side validation, relying on Business Rules, UI Policies, and Data Policy primarily, with client scripts for dynamic, real-time user interaction feedback. # 1. **Using UI Policies (recommended for simple use cases on the form view)** UI Policies are ideal for making fields mandatory on the form itself without writing any code. However, their use is limited to the fields on the primary form and might not directly apply to embedded lists. # 2. **Using Data Policies (server-side enforcement)** Data Policies are similar to UI Policies but work on the server side. They ensure that the fields are filled out regardless of how the data is submitted (e.g., via import sets, integrations, etc.), thus enforcing the mandatory field requirement. Data Policies can enforce the requirements even if the records are being inserted or updated through means other than the standard UI forms, making them more versatile for enforcing mandatory fields. # 3. **Using Business Rules (for complex logic)** Business Rules run on the server side and can be used to enforce mandatory fields on both the main form and related lists/related records. You can create a ‘before insert’ or ‘before update’ business rule to check if the required fields in the embedded list are filled out. If not, you can prevent the operation and return an error message. - Navigate to System Definition > Business Rules. - Create a new Business Rule that applies \\"before\\" an insert or update operation. - In the script, check for the presence of mandatory fields in the related list. If not present, use \`current.setAbortAction(true);\` to prevent the record from being saved and provide a user-friendly error message using \`gs.addErrorMessage('Your error message here');\`. # 4. **Client Script (for user interaction, not foolproof alone)** While you mentioned challenges with \`setMandatory()\` in Client Scripts, these scripts are primarily designed for user-side interactions and validations. They are not foolproof since they can be bypassed (e.g., through API or direct database manipulation). However, for enhancing user experience by dynamically making fields mandatory based on other field values on the form, Client Scripts can be quite useful. They cannot directly interact with embedded list fields but can still offer on-screen guidance or reminders. To ensure data integrity, always pair client scripts with server-side validation (using either Business Rules or Data Policies). This approach provides a dual layer of protection: immediate user feedback and guaranteed data integrity upon submission. # Conclusion To make fields in an embedded list or the embedded list itself mandatory, leveraging Data Policies for server-side enforcement and Business Rules for complex logic and validation are the most effective strategies. These methods ensure data integrity regardless of how the data is entered or manipulated. UI Policies and Client Scripts can enhance the user experience but should not be solely relied upon for enforcing data integrity."},{"instruction":"close ritm when task is closed with business rule var gr = new GlideRecord('sc_task'); gr.initialize(); gr.request_item = current.sys_id; gr.short_description = 'Auto-generated task for ' + current.number; // Set other necessary fields according to your task form gr.insert();","output":"It seems you are looking for guidance on how to close a Request Item (RITM) when all associated tasks (for example, \`sc_task\` records) are closed, but the code you've shared is about creating a new task for a request item, not about the closure of RITMs. Let's address your original need—closing the RITM when all its tasks are closed—by guiding you through creating an appropriate Business Rule. To accomplish this, follow these steps to create a Business Rule that will check the status of all tasks under a specific RITM whenever a task is updated. If all tasks are in a closed state, the rule will proceed to close the RITM as well: # Step 1: Define When the Business Rule Should Run For this requirement, you'll want the Business Rule to run on the \`sc_task\` table since you're monitoring the status of tasks. Configure it to run \\"After\\" a task record is updated. # Step 2: Define the Condition for the Rule The rule should check when a task's state changes to a closed state. You'll need to define what constitutes a \\"closed\\" state for your tasks, as this can vary between implementations. For example, if you consider a \\"Closed Complete\\" state as closed, you'll check for that. # Step 3: Business Rule Script Here's a sample script for the Business Rule. This script assumes \\"3\\" is the state value for \\"Closed Complete\\" (or whatever your equivalent closed state is). Adjust the state numbers according to your instance's setup. \`\`\`javascript // Business Rule Script to close RITM when all related SC Tasks are closed (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) { // Check if the current task is being set to a closed state; adjust the state number accordingly. if (current.state == '3') { // Instantiate a GlideRecord to query all related tasks for the current RITM var taskGR = new GlideRecord('sc_task'); taskGR.addQuery('request_item', current.request_item); taskGR.addQuery('state', '!=', '3'); // Adjust this condition to match your \\"closed\\" state(s) taskGR.query(); // If no open tasks are found, close the REQ Item (RITM) if (!taskGR.hasNext()) { var ritmGR = new GlideRecord('sc_req_item'); if (ritmGR.get(current.request_item)) { ritmGR.state = '4'; // Assuming \\"4\\" is the closed state for RITM; adjust as necessary ritmGR.update(); } } } })(current, previous); \`\`\` # Step 4: Additional Adjustments - Make sure to adjust the state values in the script (\`current.state == '3'\` for task states and \`ritmGR.state = '4'\` for RITM states) according to your instance's configuration. - If your instance uses different field names or you wish to check additional conditions (like specific types of tasks), adjust the script accordingly. # Conclusion This Business Rule script checks if the current task's state is being set to closed and then checks if there are any non-closed tasks remaining for the related RITM. If no open tasks are found, it closes the RITM.

A Script Include is essentially a reusable JavaScript code library that can be called from many parts of the ServiceNow platform, including Business Rules, Client Scripts, UI Actions, and yes, Workflows (specifically, in Workflow Scripts). Here’s a step-by-step approach on how to encapsulate logic within a Script Include and how to use it within a Workflow: # Step 1: Create a Script Include 1. **Navigate** to System Definition > Script Includes. 2. **Click** \\"New\\" to create a new Script Include. 3. **Give** your Script Include a Name, and ensure it is set as \\"Accessible from\\" Client and Server if needed. 4. **Implement** your logic within a function of this Script Include. Here’s an example based on closing an RITM when all associated tasks are closed: \`\`\`javascript var CloseRITMIfTasksClosed = Class.create(); CloseRITMIfTasksClosed.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, closeRITM: function(ritmSysId) { var openTasks = new GlideAggregate('sc_task'); openTasks.addQuery('request_item', ritmSysId); openTasks.addAggregate('COUNT'); openTasks.query(); if (openTasks.next() && openTasks.getAggregate('COUNT') == '0') { var ritmGR = new GlideRecord('sc_req_item'); if (ritmGR.get(ritmSysId)) { ritmGR.state = '4'; // Assuming \\"4\\" is the closed state for RITM; adjust as necessary ritmGR.update(); } } }, type: 'CloseRITMIfTasksClosed' }; \`\`\` # Step 2: Use the Script Include in a Workflow Now that you have your logic encapsulated in a Script Include, you can call this logic from a Workflow: 1. **Open** the relevant Workflow where you want to use this logic. 2. **Drag and Drop** a \\"Run Script\\" activity into the Workflow where you wish it to execute. 3. **Configure** the \\"Run Script\\" activity by providing the necessary script to call your Script Include function. You have to pass the relevant inputs like the \`sys_id\` of the Request Item (RITM). You can use the Workflow context’s variables for this purpose. Here's how you could configure the script in the \\"Run Script\\" activity: \`\`\`javascript var ritmId = workflow.scratchpad.ritmSysId; // Ensure you set ritmSysId in the scratchpad earlier in the Workflow var closer = new CloseRITMIfTasksClosed(); closer.closeRITM(ritmId); \`\`\` Ensure that you have correctly set the necessary variables (like \`ritmSysId\`) in the Workflow's scratchpad before this point, so they can be used in the script. # Conclusion Encapsulating logic within a Script Include enables the reusability of code across multiple parts of ServiceNow, including within Workflows, thus upholding the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle which is a best practice in software development. This approach avoids duplication of logic and eases maintenance.

Before proceeding, please note that modifying records in a Closed or Cancelled state should be done with caution to ensure you're adhering to your organization's policies regarding incident management. Here's a step-by-step guide to write and execute a background script for this purpose: # Step 1: Identify the Incident First, you need the \`sys_id\` of the incident in question (\`INC123456\`). The \`sys_id\` is a unique identifier for each record in ServiceNow. If you already have the Incident Number, you can easily find the \`sys_id\` by opening the incident and checking the URL or using a list view column to display it. # Step 2: Determine the *Pending* State Value ServiceNow's state field values can differ based on modifications made in your instance. Commonly, the state field is an integer where each number represents a different state (e.g., *Open = 1*, *Resolved = 6*, *Closed = 7*). You will need to check your instance to find the value that corresponds to the *Pending* state. This can be done by looking at the choices for the State field in the dictionary or examining an existing incident that is in the *Pending* state. Assuming *Pending* is represented by the value \`4\` (this is just an example, ensure you verify this in your instance). # Step 3: Write the Background Script You can run the following background script to update the status of the incident. Ensure that you replace \`your_sys_id_here\` with the actual \`sys_id\` of the incident: \`\`\`javascript var incidentGR = new GlideRecord('incident'); if (incidentGR.get('your_sys_id_here')) { // Replace your_sys_id_here with the actual sys_id incidentGR.setValue('state', 4); // Assuming 4 is Pending, replace with correct value if different incidentGR.setValue('active', true); // Reactivate the incident incidentGR.update(); gs.info('Incident ' + incidentGR.number + ' updated successfully'); } else { gs.error('Incident not found'); } \`\`\` # Step 4: Execute the Background Script To run the script: 1. Navigate to **System Definition** > **Scripts - Background** in the ServiceNow Navigation pane. 2. Paste your script into the script box. 3. Click **Run script**. You should see a success message in the output if the incident was found and updated successfully. # Important Considerations: - **Audit Trail**: Changing the state of an incident, especially from a closed state back to an open or pending state, can affect your audit trail and reporting. Ensure that this action is documented properly. - **Notifications**: Consider whether any notifications are triggered when an incident's state changes and ensure this won't cause confusion. - **Permissions**: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to execute scripts and modify incident records, especially closed incidents.

Sarah is shocked and indignant that Emma's training wasn't cancelled because of the weather. She wonders what state Emma must have been in if her kit got that dirty. Emma loved trai ning in the mud.","output":"In the small, cozy town of Willowbrook, where the sun rarely took a break even in the depths of winter, the sight of mud was as rare as a blue moon. So, on one peculiar Wednesday, when the heavens decided to unleash a torrential downpour, it felt like an anomaly in the otherwise uneventful weather pattern of the town. This brought an unusual sense of excitement, especially among the younger residents. None were more thrilled than young Emma, a spirited twelve-year-old with a passion for rugby. Emma had been counting down the hours to her rugby training all week, and no amount of rain could dampen her spirits. So, when the dark clouds gathered, and the rain began to fall, she saw it not as a deterrent but as an added challenge. The idea of playing her favorite sport, combined with the adventurous conditions, was exhilarating. Meanwhile, at home, Sarah, Emma's mother, was none the wiser. Having grown up in Willowbrook, she found the sudden change in weather unsettling. She assumed, like any reasonable person would, that the rugby training would be canceled. \\"No one in their right mind would play rugby in a storm,\\" she thought to herself as she prepared a warm bath for Emma, expecting her to return cold and disappointed. When Emma burst through the door, her eyes sparkling with mischief and excitement, Sarah was taken aback. Before she could ask how training went, Emma dashed upstairs, leaving a trail of wet footprints. Shrugging off her daughter's enthusiasm as youthful resilience, Sarah went about her evening chores, which included washing Emma’s rugby kit. Upon opening the kit bag, Sarah's jaw dropped. Emma's rugby gear was not just wet; it was absolutely plastered in mud. Boots, socks, shorts, jersey—it looked as though Emma had taken a detour through a swamp. \\"Good heavens!\\" Sarah exclaimed, more shocked than angry. \\"Was there a rugby training session or a mud wrestling competition?\\" Curiosity piqued, Sarah called out for Emma, who sheepishly peered from around the corner, a grin betraying her attempt at solemnity. \\"Mom, it was the best training ever! You should've seen us, sliding, diving, tackling—it was epic!\\" Emma's enthusiasm was infectious, and despite Sarah's initial shock, she found herself smiling. \\"But what a mess!\\" Sarah tried to sound stern, but her heart wasn't in it. Seeing her daughter so happy and alive with joy, how could she be truly mad? \\"I suppose they didn't cancel training because of a little mud, then?\\" Sarah's tone was light, teasing. \\"Mom, that wasn’t a little mud. It was a glorious mud bath!\\" Emma chuckled. \\"And guess what? I scored two tries, and Coach said I was a natural mud warrior!\\" Sarah shook her head in disbelief and affection. \\"A mud warrior, huh? Well, this warrior's gear is going straight to the laundry.\\" For the next hour, they worked together in the laundry room, Emma sharing enthusiastic tales of her muddy exploits, while Sarah listened, her heart swelling with pride. Emma loved rugby, and mud or no mud, Sarah loved seeing her daughter's passion for the sport. In the end, Emma promised to take a little more care in cleaning up, and Sarah, in return, promised to worry less about the mess and more about the memories being made. That night, as they sat down to a late dinner of warm soup and fresh bread, they toasted to many more muddy adventures. The mud, as it turned out, wasn't just a sign of untidy sports gear; it was a badge of honor, a tribute to the joy of playing the game, rain or shine. In the cozy town of Willowbrook, where unusual weather brought unexpected joy, Emma's muddy rugby kit became a cherished tale of adventure, one that Sarah would retell with a smile for many years to come."},{"instruction":"Emma enthusiastically explains how they practiced diving for the ball. They had to keep doing it over an d over again to help build up their fitness. When Emma was slow to get back up, the coach jokingly told her not to lie there enjoying her mud bath.","output":"As Sarah meticulously scrubbed at the stubborn stains on Emma's kit, Emma, still bubbling with energy, recounted the highlights of her rain-drenched training session. \\"And then, Mom, we did diving drills for the ball. It was amazing!\\" Emma's eyes sparkled with the memory. \\"With the field turned into a giant mud slide, every dive felt like... like I was flying!\\" Her arms spread wide, as if she were about to take off. Sarah couldn't help but chuckle at her daughter's animated retelling. Each dive in the mud, as described by Emma, sounded less like a part of rigorous training and more like a scene from a wild adventure. \\"We had to do it over and over again,\\" Emma continued, her excitement undiminished. \\"Coach said it was to build our fitness and reaction time. But every time I hit the mud, it was so squishy and cool. After one dive, I was a bit slow getting up, just lying there, soaking it all in.\\" \\"And what did your coach say to that?\\" Sarah's curiosity was piqued, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. Emma burst into laughter. \\"He shouted, 'Emma, this isn’t a spa! Stop enjoying your mud bath and get back in line!'\\" She mimicked the coach's playful tone, causing both her and her mother to dissolve into fits of laughter. Sarah shook her head in amusement, the initial irritation at the muddy mess fading. She could now picture the whole scene vividly: her daughter, covered in mud from head to toe, grinning from ear to ear on the rugby field. It was clear that despite the extra laundry and the thorough cleanup that awaited them, these moments of joy and carefree abandon were precious. \\"For someone who's never been a fan of getting dirty, you sure seem to have enjoyed your... mud bath,\\" Sarah commented with a teasing smile, as she finally managed to get a particularly stubborn patch of mud to fade. \\"I did, Mom! I really did,\\" Emma admitted, her eyes shining. \\"There's just something about playing rugby, especially in the rain and mud. It makes me feel... alive.\\" Sarah paused, looking at her daughter with a mixture of admiration and affection. Here was her little girl, no longer so little, finding passion and joy in the unlikeliest of circumstances. It was moments like these that reminded Sarah of the unstoppable spirit her daughter possessed—an unquenchable thirst for adventure and a fearless approach to life's muddy moments. With the last of the stains finally vanquished, Sarah turned to Emma. \\"Well, my little mud warrior, how about we hang these up to dry? And next time, let's try to keep the mud on the field, okay?\\" Emma nodded, her grin unwavering. \\"Deal! But you know, Mom, sometimes the mud just finds a way to follow me home.\\" As they finished up their chores and settled down for the evening, the house filled with warmth and laughter, echoes of the day's adventures lingering in the air. Sarah realized that these messy, unpredictable moments were the very essence of childhood—of life itself. And she wouldn't have it any other way."},{"instruction":"Next 17+ funny comedy hilarious episode (with only Scooby, Shaggy and ever heroic fearless pup with the puppy power Scrappy, (do exactly EVERYTHING the plot says they do) mock characters names, places, question logic and many other funny stuff.

Scrappy, ever the optimist, tries to patch it up with a piece of gum he found under the seat while Shaggy and Scooby hilariously dodge the responsibility by pretending to be experts in cloud shapes. **Invitation to Montgomery Castle:** As fate would have it, the trio is stranded right outside the imposing yet comedically dilapidated gates of Montgomery Castle. The gates creak open by themselves (with a suspiciously hand-triggered mechanism barely hidden in the bushes), inviting the gang inside. Just then, an overly dramatic invitation flies out, smacking Scooby right on the nose, inviting them to a dinner \\"they'll never forget.\\" **Dinner Party Shenanigans:** Inside, they meet their peculiar host and guests: Clifton Montgomery, a man so eccentric he introduces himself with a theatrical bow that sends him tumbling; Barbara Redding, who is so forgetful she introduces herself five times to the same person; Sonny DiPesto, a try-hard comedian who can't land a joke; and Sally MacIntyre, whose hobby is collecting \\"ghostly\\" experiences and who seems way too excited about attending a dinner in a haunted castle. The dinner party is a farce, with food that has Scooby and Shaggy drooling but somehow always ends up splatting on someone's face due to various ghostly hijinks, including self-tossing salads and self-cutting steaks. Scrappy, meanwhile, insists on setting traps for the ghost, using blueprints that look suspiciously like they're drawn in crayon. **The Ghost of Ward Montgomery:** Soon, they are introduced to the night's entertainment - the Ghost of Ward Montgomery, haunting the halls with chains that sound suspiciously like they were bought from the discount rack. Chives, the overly dramatic butler who seems way too into his job, whispers tales of doom and gloom, but forgets his lines halfway, prompting improvised “woos” that wouldn't scare a fly. **The Investigation:** As Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy investigate - which involves a lot more snacking and running in place than actual sleuthing - they ridicule the ghost's lack of stealth and fashion sense. Scrappy's traps mostly catch the trio themselves in increasingly ridiculous ways, including a net trap that somehow ends up launching them into a room filled with even more food. **Unmasking the Villain:** After a hilariously over-the-top chase sequence filled with slapstick comedy, Scooby accidentally stumbles onto the ghost, unmasking him to reveal it's Chives, who's been trying to scare everyone away because he discovered a secret vault filled with the world’s supply of an ancient, priceless cheese hidden beneath the castle. **Sheriff's Hilarious Recap:** The local sheriff arrives in an absurdly small car, spilling out of it in a heap. He summarizes the events with a deadpan, \\"Lemme get this straight... We have a butler who’s been moonlighting as a discount ghost over some fancy mold, a trio of dinner guests who've eaten more than the catered amount, and a series of traps that’d make a roadrunner reconsider his life choices.\\" **Concluding Antics:** As Chives is taken away, lamenting not being able to taste the cheese, the gang heads back to the Mystery Machine, which has mysteriously been fixed. They didn't realize that among the guests was a mechanic enthusiast (Sonny DiPesto) who couldn't resist tinkering. The episode ends with the trio driving off into the night, Scooby and Shaggy finally finding a giant cheese wheel that fell out of the castle during the commotion, and laughing about their next big adventure, completely oblivious to the fact that they're heading towards another sign that reads \\"Welcome to Spooky Island.\\" **Final Scene:** The camera pans back to the sheriff, who finds the landscape littered with Scrappy's elaborate traps and sighs, \\"I’m too old for this.\\" He steps into his tiny car, which comedically collapses under him, leaving him to mutter, \\"I need a vacation,\\" as the episode fades out with the classic \\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\\" theme playing in the background."},{"instruction":"请将“The hypothesis that the dynamics of anti-Jewish policy was to a large extent shaped by reports on opinions and behavior has been convincingly developed.6 I will take this very haunting hypothesis as a starting point and try to supplement it by proposing an analytical concept which might help to explain the relationship between the nonofficial public sphere and anti-Jewish policy, without falling into the trap of postulating that modern antisemitism in Germany had always aimed at the physical destruction of the Jews.7 In doing so I refer myself to theoretical and historical research in the function of the public sphere8 in modern societies.9 Let me sum up where I think we stand. One after another, the legends regarding the relative immunity to National Socialism of the inhabitants of certain towns, for example the Hansa-towns, of certain social groups, especially the workers,10 or of certain leading individuals,11 have been destroyed by closer scrutiny.12 Today we are aware ofmany of the reasons for the wide acceptance of the regime. One is the populism of the Gauleiters, their Sozialismus der Tat (practical socialism),13 which sometimes fulfilled longstanding demands, such as for example the equal distribution of working hours among the harbor workers of Hamburg.14 Many of these workers were glad to once more find employment, others were delighted that for the first time in their lives they could take a vacation. Many were content that the regime pledged to do away with the humiliation of the Versailles peace treaty.15 Many Germans experienced or could hope to experience social advancement. We have come to realize that neither spontaneous nor coordinated endeavors to defend old traditions, religious practices, preferences of cultural expressions,16 or economic interests should be assembled under the term Resistenz? because this suggests that any diversion from the principles upheld by Nazi propaganda expressed reservation about the regime as such. Instead, we have slowly come to accept that Nazism existed in a German society that in many respects was less strictly dominated than we used to think.18 The latest blow to the cornerstone of any interpretation that considers Nazism as a system totally alien to the German society has come from the research into the functioning of observation and terror. Mann, Gellately, Mallmann and Paul have shown that the Gestapo and the other institutions involved in observation and persecution were much less overpowering than had been assumed, that they had to and could rely on denunciations. All of these authors have demonstrated that the institutions of persecution were made use of to resolve conflicts of everyday life. We have to conclude that to a considerable extent control of the German population was exercised by itself.19 Persecution and Secondary Public Spheres In addition, I would now propose the hypothesis that it was not only Nazi propaganda nor the endeavors to lead a more or less undisturbed private life20 which furthered what German historians have called die Hinnahme, the acquiescence with Nazi anti-Jewish policy,21 but that the secondary public sphere, in other words all the scattered and restricted publics of everyday life, had their part in furthering this acceptance. Widespread antisemitism was a precondition for the persecution of individuals who either conceived of themselves as being Jewish, or by the criteria of the new regime were declared as belonging (fully or in half), to a Jewish race. It does not explain the development from antisemitism to state- organized mass murder. Any such explanation, unsatisfactory as it will always remain, must take into account what we have come to learn about the functioning of western societies in the twentieth century. There were social, and in particular professional groups whose members were convinced that Jews endangered or prevented them from becoming economically and socially successful. Since this is well known we usually do not seek further explanation for the fact that individuals belonging to these groups made use of the advantages that were offered to them through the persecution ofJews. However, one of the results of the current international debate on analytical concepts in social history is the insight that individuals do not simply function according to their economic or social positions,22 and that interests and attitudes, therefore, should not be considered simple reflexes of social positions. Instead, interests are always the result of an interpretation of these positions. Individuals interpret their position in life, their hopes and their needs by taking into consideration what they know or assume to be thought legitimate by “everybody.” This “everybody” can be the anonymous authority of the general public, be it officially regulated or not. Most often, however, the most important body of reference is one or other of the public spheres in which we lead our daily lives, ranging from school class to church congregation, to the workplace.23 In fact, sociologists have told us that the professional group is the most important reference group for modern man.24 Public opinion, in other words, is not only to be conceived of as the legitimating body for government, but also as the legitimating authority that is relevant in the process of constituting one’s interests. It is, therefore, one of the main preconditions for behavior. The possible relevance of this for research into the dynamics of anti-Jewish policy might be illustrated by reference to an event at the University of Göttingen. On 12 April 1933, almost immediately after the law of the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service had been enacted, the local paper printed the announcement that every university teacher would receive a questionnaire to be completed and returned as soon as possible in order to enable the minister to solve die.Judenfrage before the commencement of the next term. Everyone seems to have complied. Twenty-eight of the professors at this university were removed from their posts in 1933, six by telegram already on 25 April. No traces of any protest have been found. On 17 April, Prof. James Franck, winner of the Nobel prize in physics, asked the responsible Prussian minister to relieve him of his duties. Newspapers all over Germany made this move known, and the local newspaper in Göttingen printed Franck’s statement that he did not want to make use of the privilege accorded to those Jewish public servants who had fought for Germany in the war. There was only one action of solidarity from a university colleague. It came from Prof. Ewald in Stuttgart. In Göttingen, forty-two members of the faculty hastened to publish a statement declaring Franck ’s resignation to be an act of sabotage. After the death of Prof. Franck in 1954, many letters that he had received from individuals all over Germany who had wanted to let him know their esteem and their solidarity were found. It is because of these letters that I choose the “removal” ofJames Franck from a German university as an example. He might have valued them for their consoling virtue. Many others have reported that any sign of pity, solidarity or esteem helped them through some of their days or weeks.25 For historians they prove that although we do not know if this was always prompted by an attitude devoid of traces of antisemitism,26 there were in fact individuals who disagreed with this specific measure.27 But the university as a body, including all the colleagues not approving of the new law, remained silent. Victor Klemperer, professor in Dresden until April 1935, again and again noted in his diary that he found it simply incomprehensible when close acquaintances abruptly ended any contact with him after his dismissal.28 Franck must have had similar experiences. In 1933 the SA was terrorizing the German population. Although its gangs most often tormented individuals who were known to be “left”, among them numerous Jews, it is possible that many others were afraid. At Göttingen, as in most other universities, the percentage of students who openly declared their favor for the new regime was high. Whatever the motivations of those who acquiesced in the first official anti-Jewish measures in 1933, the university public, by not insisting on humanity, on professional standards, or on its traditional autonomy, had already missed its opportunity to set limits to government strategies. Even more important is the impact this behavior must have had for the possible development of the nonofficial public sphere. In matters of anti-Jewish policy it had its back broken before it even had a chance to develop as a “secondary public” in the sense of Mallmann and Paul. After having experienced the rejoicing of some and the acquiescence of others, after having noticed that those who became professors because leftist and Jewish colleagues were forced to leave without arousing the disapprobation of their colleagues, who would in the years to come have felt it necessary to think twice before unreservedly bending to any official request? The loss of humanity might sometimes be an individual affair. Most often it is a social process.29 ”翻译为中文","output":"“关于反犹政策的动力在很大程度上是由对民意和行为的报告所塑造的假设，已经得到了令人信服的论证。我将以这个非常令人不安的假设作为出发点，并尝试通过提出一个分析概念来补充它，这个概念可能有助于解释非官方公共领域与反犹政策之间的关系，而不陷入假定现代德国的反犹主义一直旨在物理上消灭犹太人的陷阱。在这样做时，我参考了有关现代社会中公共领域功能的理论和历史研究。让我总结一下我们目前的理解。 一项接一项，关于某些城镇（例如汉萨联盟城市）的居民、某些社会群体（尤其是工人）或某些领导人物对国家社会主义有相对免疫力的传说，在仔细审查后被一一推翻。今天我们意识到了该政权广泛被接受的许多原因。其中之一是区域领导者的民粹主义，他们的实践社会主义，有时满足了长期的要求，例如汉堡港口工人工作时间的均等分配。许多工人因而再次找到工作感到高兴，其他人则因为生平首次能够休假而欣喜。许多人对政权承诺废除凡尔赛和约的屈辱感到满意。许多德国人体验到了或希望体验到社会晋升。我们已经开始意识到，既非自发也非协调的努力来捍卫旧传统、宗教实践、文化表达偏好或经济利益，不应该统称为抵抗，因为这暗示了任何偏离纳粹宣传所持原则的行为表明了对该政权本身的保留。相反，我们已经逐渐接受纳粹主义存在于一个在很多方面比我们过去认为的要宽容得多的德国社会中。关于纳粹主义被视为完全异于德国社会的体系的任何解释的基石，最近经由对观察和恐怖作用的研究而受到冲击。曼恩、盖拉特利、马尔曼和保罗等作者已经表明，盖世太保和其他参与观察和迫害的机构的能力远没有假设的那样强大，它们必须且只能依赖告密。这些作者都展示了迫害机构是如何被用来解决日常生活中的冲突的。我们必须得出结论，德国民众在很大程度上是由其自身来进行控制的。 迫害与次级公共领域 此外，我现在提出的假设是，不仅是纳粹宣传，也不仅是为了过上或多或少不受干扰的私人生活而作出的努力，促进了德国历史学家所称的对纳粹反犹政策的默许，而是次级公共领域——换句话说，日常生活中所有分散和受限的公众——在进一步促进这种接受中也发挥了作用。广泛的反犹主义是迫害那些要么认为自己是犹太人，要么按照新政权的标准被宣布完全或部分属于犹太种族的个体的先决条件。这并不解释从反犹主义到国家组织的大规模屠杀的发展。任何这种解释，无论如何总会令人不满意，都必须考虑到我们已经了解到的关于20世纪西方社会运作的知识。 有些社会，尤其是专业群体，其成员相信犹太人危害了或阻止了他们经济和社会上的成功。由于这已经众所周知，我们通常不再寻求进一步的解释，来解释这些群体的个人利用迫害犹太人获得的好处的事实。然而，当前国际社会历史分析概念辩论的一个结果是，个体并不仅仅根据他们的经济或社会地位来行动，因此，利益和态度不应该被视为社会地位的简单反射。相反，利益总是对这些地位的一种解释的结果。个体通过考虑他们知道或假设被“每个人”认为合法的事物来解释他们的生活地位、希望和需要。这个“每个人”可以是官方管控与否的一般公众的匿名权威。然而，更常见的是，最重要的参考体系是我们日常生活中的一个或另一个公共领域，范围从学校班级到教会聚会，到工作场所。事实上，社会学家告诉我们，对现代人而言，职业群体是最重要的参考群体。 换句话说，公众意见不仅应该被视为政府合法性的基础，也是在构成个人利益的过程中相关的合法化权威。因此，它是行为的主要前提之一。 这对研究反犹政策的动态可能的相关性可以通过提到发生在哥廷根大学的一件事来说明。1933年4月12日，就在《恢复职业公务员法》颁布后不久，当地报纸刊登公告，宣布每位大学教师将收到一份需尽快完成并退回的问卷，以便使部长能够在下学期开始前解决犹太问题。似乎每个人都遵从了这一要求。1933年，该大学的28位教授被解职，其中六人已于4月25日通过电报解职。没有发现任何抗议的痕迹。4月17日，诺贝尔物理学奖得主詹姆斯·弗兰克教授请求负责的普鲁士部长免除他的职务。全德国的报纸都报道了这一行动，哥廷根当地报纸刊登了弗兰克的声明，他不想利用那些在战争中为德国战斗的犹太公务员所获得的特权。只有一位大学同事表达了团结之举，那就是斯图加特的埃瓦尔德教授。在哥廷根，四十二位教员急于发表声明，宣称弗兰克的辞职是一种破坏行为。弗兰克教授于1954年去世后，发现了他收到的许多信件，这些信件来自全德国各地想要表达对他的尊重和团结的人们。选择詹姆斯·弗兰克从德国大学的“去职”作为一个例子，是因为这些信件可能因其安慰作用而被他珍视。许多人报告说，任何表现出的怜悯、团结或尊重的迹象都帮助他们度过了一些日子或周。对历史学家来说，它们证明了，尽管我们不知道这是否总是出于一种完全没有反犹主义痕迹的态度，但实际上确实有人不同意这一具体措施。但是，包括所有不同意新法律的大学同事在内的大学作为一个整体，保持沉默。维克多·克莱珀勒，直到1935年4月还是德累斯顿大学的教授，他一次又一次地在他的日记中写道，他发现亲密熟人在他被解雇后突然结束任何联系是完全令人费解的。弗兰克肯定有过类似的经历。 1933年，突击队正在恐吓德国民众。尽管它们的团伙最常折磨的是那些众所周知的“左派”人士，其中包括许多犹太人，但可能还有许多其他人感到害怕。在哥廷根，像在大多数其他大学一样，公开宣布支持新政权的学生比例很高。不管那些在1933年首次官方反犹措施中默许的人的动机是什么，大学公众未能坚持人道主义、专业标准或其传统的自主性，已经错失了给政府策略设限的机会。更重要的是，这种行为对非官方公共领域可能的发展产生的影响。在反犹政策问题上，它在甚至有机会作为马尔曼和保罗所说的“次级公共”发展之前，就已经被打断了。在经历了一些人的欢呼和其他人的默许之后，在注意到那些因左翼和犹太同事被迫离开而成为教授的人没有引起同事们的不满之后，谁会在日后感到有必要在毫无保留地屈从于任何官方要求之前三思而后行呢？人性的丧失有时可能是个人的事。最常见的是，它是一个社会过程。"},{"instruction":"请将“Analysis of modern organizations has shown that every social organization, every institute, school, office or workshop has a spirit of its own.30 Once developed it is transmitted to newcomers, integrating them into a social climate that seems to be quite immune to changes in formal organization and rules. In 1933-34 the Nazi movement was successful not only in formally regulating the activities of social institutions that were allowed to continue functioning, but also in decisively shaking their spirit. Many Christian congregations, especially those of the Catholic church, fostered dissent against the regime. However, after their overwhelming acquiescence with the first measures of anti-Jewish policy,31 nothing less than a spiritual revolution could have enabled the church to regain the capacity to develop into a secondary public sphere that could have functioned as something like a collective backing of dissent against anti-Jewish policy.32 As it was, individuals had to rely on their own faith, morality and courage and on support from close friends.33 From autobiographies and from sources produced via oral history we have learned that, at least in the thirties, there were still some schools in Germany whose staff somehow managed to deal with the order of having students greet them with ‘“Heil Hitler? while not demanding the same from Jewish students. In most schools, however, this order was immediately applied to either force Jewish students to conform or to exclude them from the social collective by prohibiting their use of the official greeting.34 Although Wolfgang Klafki, in his summary of research into the construction of adolescent identity during the Nazi period, stated that children and youngsters prior to reaching puberty were to the greatest extent influenced by their parents, research on the effects of the institutional climate would lead us to assume that the spirit of a school legitimized some forms of behavior while delegitimizing others. Hannah Arendt, Raul Hilberg, Zygmunt Bauman and many others35 have attempted to show that persecution and mass murder were not dependent on extraordinarily cruel personalities, because these were to a large extent developed and organized in the normal forms of rationalized modern society36 - and in many respects the Germany of the thirties was an extraordinarily modern society. I still agree with general elements of this interpretation, but we do have to be very clear about the fact that the working of any modern organization is not sufficiently grasped by reference to its formal structures.37 From organizational analysis we have learned that these function amid a special climate, amid internal and external personal networks. If individuals not considered as fierce haters of Jews drew up lists of so-called non-Aryans and evaluated their property as they would have prepared statistics on dog owners, this was not only because of their compliance to orders but also because the nonofficial public sphere in which they operated did not prevent their indifference to the content of their work. For departments of public services as well as for the representative bodies of towns, which in 1933 and 1934 moved quickly ahead with rules discriminating against Jews,38 the way back would have been very long. Bureaucratization and legalization of discrimination and persecution developed in partialized public spheres that as early as 1933 forsook their capacity to foster dissent against the persecution ofJews. Historians have convincingly demonstrated that the critique of blatant acts of violence, present in secondary public spheres and reported to Nazi leaders, furthered the legalization of persecution. That the existence of critique is well documented does not shake the conclusion that acquiescence with official anti- Jewish policy was imbedded in the secondary public spheres. Neither is this conclusion contradicted by many of the instances of reported and otherwise documented nonconformist behavior. If peasants all over Germany went on to deal with Jewish livestock traders until it was made impossible in 1938, this was because these traders offered better prices and still had the money to make immediate payment. Many of those who continued to buy in Jewish shops seem to have done so for economic reasons.39 Some, of course, used their shopping practices to manifest dissent and solidarity. Sometimes this even seems to have been the collective practice of a secondary public. In Tübingen the rather poor winegrowers, all ofwhom lived in the so-called lower town, continued to frequent the textile shop of Leopold Hirsch as long as it remained in existence.40 This behavior was probably prompted not only by economic considerations but also by a stubborn insistence upon the right to decide for oneself where to buy. On the whole, the partialized secondary public spheres did not function as legitimizing instances for nonconformist, let alone dissenting behavior against anti-Jewish policy. If we still permit ourselves to think that the majority of Germans did not support what Nazis termed the “Final Solution,”41 it is not easy to refute that a majority would have agreed to a reversal of the emancipation which would have made Jews members of a permanently discriminated minority.42 When leading Nazi activists decided that any such development was not to be considered an adequate realization of their aims, not only official public opinion but also partially dissenting secondary public opinion had long robbed Jews of the protection accorded to men, women and children perceived as fully belonging to the social collective. Those who acquiesced in the first anti-Jewish measures did not thereby acquiesce in all the atrocities that were to come. But in refraining from voicing and demonstrating dissent against anti-Jewish measures, at least in the nonformal publics in which they lived their daily life, they preconstituted social conditions for the radicalization of anti-Jewish policy. Everyday Life and Persecution This essay is neither about the active proponents of persecution nor about those who actively tried to oppose it, but about those who afterwards felt they could rightfully state that they had not been involved. Seen in the light of research into the functioning of modern states in general as well as into the functioning of Nazi government, this conviction has to be refuted. The government of modern societies is not dependent on the active support of the majority of its citizens, but only on the absence of massive open dissent. Those who did not feel compelled to speak up, to offend against regulations, or to refuse compliance with directions of their superiors have therefore to be considered as having been involved. In a recent publication on the history of consciousness in Germany during the 1930s, Helmut Arntzen stated ‘“Gleichzeitig sucht sich aber - und mit Erfolg - die Alltagsmentalität zu erhalten”4 thereby suggesting that daily practices and structures have a life of their own, that their reproduction under different political regimes should be considered autonomous from the intentions of the people involved. But social practices, be they ever so firmly embedded in the past of a social collective, are not reproduced by any dynamics inherent in themselves but only by the behavior of social actors. Continuation of the usual practices of everyday life did not simply happen, it was the result of collective behavior. In shaping the climate of most informal publics it not only produced the conditions for the governing of the German population, it also provided the legitimation for those who refrained from publicly voicing dissent. Many of us who grew up in Germany after the end of the Third Reich have time and again asked themselves how they would have behaved. We used to imagine all types of crucial situations in which one would have had to choose between courage and cowardice, humanity or villainy. Those of us who have gone on to study the functioning of National Socialism have since learned that though these crucial situations did occur, the social preconditions for the functioning of the regime and its policies of persecution were produced in rather undramatic forms. When, in 1933, most of the “secondary publics” acquiesced with the first measures of discrimination, their members might have felt they were merely in the process of defending the normal functioning of their daily life. However, when this practice became imbedded in most of the informal publics in which people led their daily life, it also tended to shape the attitudes and behavior of individuals. Attitudes towards the politics of the regime were not a given fact, nor were they simply changed by specific political measures. Instead, they were fostered by the climate in the “secondary publics” to which individuals belonged. It is not possible to know exactly what would have happened had the members of some of the leading institutions and many others not acquiesced in the first measures of anti-Jewish policy, or if the reports on the secondary opinion had sounded differently. This, however, cannot soften the impact of the knowledge that the behavior of Germans gave power to a government that was to organize mass murder. In the midst of persecution the defense of normality becomes political involvement.44”翻译为中文","output":"对现代组织的分析表明，每个社会组织、每个机构、学校、办公室或工作坊都拥有自己独特的精神。一旦形成，这种精神就会传递给新来者，将他们融入到一个似乎对形式组织和规则的变化相当免疫的社会氛围中。在1933-34年间，纳粹运动不仅在正式规范被允许继续运作的社会机构的活动方面取得了成功，而且还决定性地动摇了它们的精神。许多基督教会团体，尤其是天主教会团体，培育了对政权的异议。然而，在对首批反犹政策的压倒性默许之后，除了一场精神革命，教会别无他法恢复成为次级公共领域的能力，这样的领域本可以起到某种集体支持反对反犹政策的作用。在这种情况下，个人只能依靠自己的信仰、道德和勇气以及来自亲密朋友的支持。 通过自传和口述历史资料，我们了解到，至少在三十年代，德国仍有一些学校的教职工设法应对要求学生以“希特勒万岁”问候他们的命令，而不要求犹太学生这样做。然而，在大多数学校，这一命令立即被执行，旨在强迫犹太学生顺从或通过禁止他们使用官方问候语将他们排除在社会集体之外。尽管沃尔夫冈·克拉夫基在他对纳粹时期少年身份构建研究的总结中指出，在青春期之前的儿童和青少年在很大程度上受到父母的影响，但对机构氛围影响的研究使我们假设，学校的精神使某些行为得以合法化，而使其他行为失去合法性。汉娜·阿伦特、劳尔·希尔伯格、齐格蒙特·鲍曼和许多其他人都试图表明，迫害和大规模谋杀不依赖于特别残忍的个性，因为这些在很大程度上是在现代社会合理化的正常形式中发展和组织的——在许多方面，三十年代的德国是一个非常现代的社会。我仍然同意这种解释的一般要素，但我们确实必须非常清楚地认识到，仅凭对其形式结构的参考是无法充分把握任何现代组织运作的。从组织分析中，我们了解到这些功能存在于一种特殊的氛围中，存在于内部和外部的个人网络中。如果那些不被视为极端犹太人仇恨者的个人列出所谓的非雅利安人名单，并评估他们的财产，就像他们准备狗主人的统计数据一样，这不仅仅是因为他们遵从命令，也因为他们所处的非官方公共领域没有阻止他们对工作内容的漠不关心。对于那些在1933年和1934年迅速推进针对犹太人歧视规则的公共服务部门以及城镇的代表机构来说，回头之路将非常漫长。歧视和迫害的官僚化和合法化发展在部分化的公共领域中进行，早在1933年就放弃了培养反对迫害犹太人的异议的能力。 历史学家已经令人信服地证明，次级公共领域中存在的、向纳粹领导人报告的对公然暴行的批评，促进了迫害的合法化。批评的存在得到了充分记录，并不动摇这样一个结论：对官方反犹政策的默许植根于次级公共领域。这个结论也不因许多报告的和其他方式记录的非顺从行为的实例而受到反驳。如果德国各地的农民继续与犹太牲畜交易商进行交易，直到1938年这变得不可能，那是因为这些交易商提供了更好的价格并且仍然拥有立即支付的资金。许多继续在犹太商店购物的人似乎是出于经济原因。当然，一些人用他们的购物实践来表达异议和团结。有时，这甚至似乎是次级公共的集体实践。在蒂宾根，那些相对贫困的葡萄酒种植者，他们全部居住在所谓的下城，只要莱奥波德·赫希的纺织店还存在，就继续光顾这家店。这种行为可能不仅仅是出于经济考虑，也是出于对自己决定在哪里购买的权利的坚持。 总体而言，部分化的次级公共领域并没有作为非顺从行为，更不用说反对反犹政策的行为的合法化实例起作用。如果我们仍然允许自己认为，大多数德国人并不支持纳粹所称的“最终解决方案”，那么很难反驳大多数人将会同意逆转使犹太人成为永久歧视的少数群体的解放。当领导纳粹的活动家决定，任何此类发展都不应被视为他们目标的适当实现时，不仅官方舆论，而且部分异议的次级公共舆论早已剥夺了犹太人作为被视为完全属于社会集体的男人、女人和孩子所享有的保护。 那些对首批反犹措施默许的人，并不意味着他们对后来的所有暴行都表示默许。但是，至少在他们日常生活中的非正式公共领域，他们因不发声、不展示对反犹措施的异议，事先构建了反犹政策激进化的社会条件。 日常生活和迫害 这篇文章既不是关于迫害的积极支持者，也不是关于那些积极尝试反对迫害的人，而是关于那些事后感到自己可以正当地声明他们没有参与的人。从对现代国家功能的研究以及对纳粹政府功能的研究的角度来看，这种信念必须被驳斥。现代社会的政府不依赖于大多数公民的积极支持，而仅依赖于大规模公开异议的缺乏。因此，那些不觉得有必要站出来发声、违反规定或拒绝遵从上级指示的人必须被视为已经参与其中。 在一项关于1930年代德国意识形态史的最近出版物中，海尔穆特·阿恩岑指出：“同时，日常心态也在努力——并成功地——保持自身”，从而暗示日常实践和结构拥有自己的生命，它们在不同政治制度下的再生产应该被视为与参与者的意图自治。但是社会实践，无论它们在社会集体的过去中多么牢固地根深蒂固，不是由它们自身固有的动力再生产的，而只是由社会行为者的行为再生产的。日常生活的通常实践的继续并非自发发生，而是集体行为的结果。在塑造大多数非正式公共领域的氛围时，它不仅为德国人民的治理创造了条件，还为那些不公开发表异议的人提供了合法性。 我们许多在第三帝国结束后在德国长大的人不时地问自己，如果当时处于那种情况，自己会怎么做。我们曾想象各种关键情况，其中人必须在勇气与懦弱、人性或邪恶之间做出选择。那些继续研究国家社会主义运作的人已经了解到，尽管这些关键情况确实发生了，但该政权及其迫害政策的运作的社会前提是以相当不戏剧化的形式产生的。当在1933年，大多数“次级公共”对首批歧视措施表示默许时，它们的成员可能觉得他们仅仅是在保卫日常生活的正常功能的过程中。然而，当这种实践在人们日常生活中的大多数非正式公共领域中得到植入时，它也倾向于塑造个体的态度和行为。对该政权政策的态度不是既定事实，也不是仅仅由特定政治措施改变的。相反，它们是由个体所属的“次级公共”中的氛围所培养的。如果一些领导机构的成员和许多其他人没有对首批反犹政策表示默许，或者如果关于次级舆论的报告听起来有所不同，我们无法确切知道会发生什么。然而，这无法减轻德国人的行为给一个将要组织大规模谋杀的政府赋予权力的知识的影响。在迫害中，捍卫正常性变成了政治参与。"},{"instruction":"请将“Von der Theorie des bürgerlichen Staates zur Theorie kapitalistischer Staatsgewalt 10. Über Marx und über Bretton Woods1 Marx zufolge hat Kapitalismus zwei historische Voraussetzungen: Kapital, das zu Investitionszwecken genutzt werden kann und Arbeitskräfte, die aus materiellen Gründen gezwungen sind, ihre Arbeitskraft unter dem Diktat von Kapitalisten einzusetzen.2 Marcel van der Linden zufolge sollten wir der theoretischen Konzeption „ursprüngliche Akkumulation“ ein drittes Element hinzufügen: Kapital und Arbeitskraft müssen tatsächlich zusammenkommen.3 Im Folgenden wird deutlich werden, dass diese Voraussetzung nicht ganz so selbstverständlich ist, wie sie auf den ersten Blick erscheinen mag. Zunächst zur Entwicklung des Weltmarkts und damit Marx zufolge zur Voraussetzung für die Ansammlung von Kapital. Was sich dazu in dem Kapitel findet, das Marx „die sogenannte ursprüngliche Akkumulation“ überschrieben hat, unterscheidet sich nicht grundsätzlich von üblichen Darstellungen: über Kolonialsystem und Sklavenhandel, die Entwicklung des Geldes und der Staatsschulden lässt sich auch andernorts nachlesen. Dass diese Prozesse bewirkten, dass das Kapital „von Kopf bis Zeh, aus allen Poren blut- und schmutztriefend“ zur Welt kam,4 hat Marx nicht daran gehindert, die im bewaffneten Welthandel praktizierte Aneignung als eine der grundlegenden Voraussetzung für Kapitalismus zu behandeln. So sehr er deren gängige Beurteilung kritisiert, auch für Marx waren die von europäischen Herrschaftsbereichen ausgehenden Handelskriege bis hin zum Opiumkrieg gegen China „Hauptmomente der ursprünglichen Akkumulation“.5 Niemand wird bestreiten können, dass bewaffneter Handel, Sklavenhandel und Kolonialsystem die Welt auf eine Art und Weise verändert haben, die bis heute nachwirkt. Aber auch Marx hat sich geirrt. So unbestreitbar zutreffend er die Praktiken des bewaffneten Handels charakterisierte, die mit diesen Praktiken erzielte Ansammlung von Kapital hat für die Entwicklung des Kapitalismus in den zuerst kapitalistischen Ländern kaum eine Rolle gespielt. Entsprechende Annahmen - sie finden sich ja nicht nur bei Marx - sind inzwischen in vielen Einzelheiten durch die Forschung widerlegt worden. Im Resultat ist deutlich, dass im weltweiten Handel und in den Kolonien zwar einzelne sehr reich werden konnten, dass solche Unternehmungen insgesamt aber eher wenig lukrativ waren. Jede einzelne der von europäischen Herrschern mit Privilegien ausgestatteten Handelsgesellschaften ging im Laufe der Zeit bankrott, die meisten bereits an der Wende vom 18. zum 19. Jahrhundert. Und am Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts fand zumindest in England die Auffassung zunehmende Verbreitung, dass es sich bei Kolonialherrschaft ökonomisch gesehen um ein ziemliches Verlustgeschäft handelte. Sie machte Einzelne sehr reich, erlaubte vielen, sich als Herren aufzuführen, war für die Gesamtökonomie in den jeweiligen Mutterländern der hohen Kosten wegen aber kein Gewinn. Das sagt selbstverständlich nichts über den politischen Nutzen, den Regierungen aus Kolonialbesitz zu ziehen hofften und tatsächlich zogen. Der allgemeine Niedergang des von Europa ausgehenden privilegierten Handels erklärt sich aus den Kosten der bewaffneten Konkurrenz. Zwar sicherten Kaufleute ihre Niederlassungen auch gegen potentiellen Wiederstand von Einheimischen, vor allem aber mussten sie sich zu Land und zu Wasser der bewaffneten Konkurrenz anderer europäischer Kaufleute erwehren. Dass die Konkurrenz in dem von Europa ausgehenden Welthandel des 15., 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts mit Waffengewalt ausgetragen wurde, unterscheidet ihn - und das ist bislang viel zu wenig beachtet worden - von dem Welthandel, der ihm voraufging. Denn im 13. und 14. Jahrhundert gab es ein System regelmäßiger Handelsbeziehungen zwischen städtischen Handelszentren in Asien und an der Ostküste Afrikas.6 Europäische Kaufleute waren an diesen Handelsbeziehungen, wenn auch eher am Rande, ebenfalls beteiligt. Was diesen Weltmarkt von dem späteren unterschied, war sein vergleichsweise friedlicher Charakter. Dass er an verschiedenen Orten von dafür angestellten Wächtern gesichert wurde, hat nicht alle Überfälle auf Kaufleute verhindert, aber bewaffnete Konkurrenz war kein Merkmal dieses Weltmarktes. Es handelte sich um ein relativ stabiles System. Dass die Kunst der Seefahrt und Techniken des Geldverkehrs genutzt wurden, die so oft als Ursache für die rasche Entwicklung des von Europa ausgehenden Welthandels angeführt werden, hat seine Fortdauer nicht gesichert, als Seuchen im 14. Jahrhundert die weitere Urbanisierung unterbrachen und damit die Basis dieses Handelssystems erschütterten. Die Existenz dieses ersten Welthandelssystems ist theoretisch in Betracht zu ziehen, weil sie deutlich macht, dass nicht der Beginn des von Europa ausgehenden Welthandels zu erklären ist, sondern die Tatsache, dass er von Anfang an durch und durch gewalttätig war. Ich führe sie auf den Zusammenhang zwischen Fürstenherrschaft und Privilegien zurück und sehe in der Verfestigung dieses Zusammenhangs den womöglich wichtigsten Beitrag des vorkapitalistischen Welthandels zur Entwicklung des Kapitalismus. Auch Marx erwähnt privilegierte Handelsgesellschaften. Er nennt sie „Gesellschaften Monopolia“ und verweist darauf, dass er diesen Terminus von Luther übernommen hat.7 Für ihre Privilegien, genauer gesagt: für den herrschaftlich angeordneten Ausschluss potentieller Konkurrenten, mussten Handelsgesellschaften die Privilegien verleihenden Fürsten bezahlen. Dieser Einnahmen wegen waren europäische Fürsten an erfolgreichem Fernhandel und damit auch an den Räubereien interessiert, die von den durch sie privilegierten Kaufleuten praktiziert wurden. Und diese Räubereien betrafen nicht nur die Einheimischen in fernen Weltgegenden. Im 16. und im 17. Jahrhundert haben sich europäische Kaufleute auch gegenseitig überfallen, beraubt und bekämpft. Weil Fürsten vom Erfolg dieser Praktiken profitierten, ist die Entwicklung ihrer Herrschaft sehr eng mit der Entwicklung bewaffneter Konkurrenz auf dem Weltmarkt verbunden. Nichtsdestotrotz ging Wallerstein in die Irre, als er die Herausbildung der modernen europäischen Staaten als einen Effekt der von Europa ausgehenden Dynamik der Expansion bezeichnete.8 Sie habe dazu geführt, dass in Europa nicht mehr Fürsten herrschten, sondern Staatsgewalt entstanden sei. So verständlich es ist, dass im ausgehenden 20. Jahrhundert viele in Südamerika und in anderen Regionen der Welt geneigt waren, diese Ausführungen als Erklärung für die fortdauernden Nachteile zu akzeptieren, mit denen sie konfrontiert waren, sie basiert auf einer theoretischen Konzeption des vorkapitalistischen Handels, die seiner tatsächlichen historischen Ausprägung nicht gerecht wird. Marx wusste es schon besser. In dem kleinen Fragment über das Kaufmannskapital, das sich im 3. Band des „Kapital“ findet, stellt er fest, dass Handel zwar meist Veränderungen bewirkt, ihm aber keine autonome entwicklungsbestimmende Kraft zukommt. Vielmehr sei die Wirkung des Handels von der Art und Weise der in einer Region dominanten Produktionsweise abhängig. Anders gesagt: die Entwicklung kapitalistischer Formen der Produktion lässt sich nicht zureichend aus den Einflüssen des Handelskapitals erklären.9 Zwar sieht auch Marx im Handelskapital „die erste freie Existenzweise des Kapitals“10, das ist aber weit entfernt von der Annahme, der Beginn des Kapitalismus sei auf die Entwicklung von Handelshäusern samt Wechseln und anderen Hilfsmitteln des internationalen Handels zu datieren. Marx hat das anders und meines Erachtens zutreffend gesehen.”翻译为中文","output":"从资本制国家理论到资本主义国家权力理论 关于马克思和布雷顿森林体系 马克思认为，资本主义有两个历史前提：可以用于投资目的的资本和出于物质原因被迫在资本家的命令下使用自己劳动力的劳动者。马塞尔·范德琳登认为，我们应该给“原始积累”的理论概念增加第三个要素：资本和劳动力必须真正地集合在一起。接下来将会明确，这个前提并不像乍看上去那么自明。 首先讨论世界市场的发展，因此马克思认为这是资本积累的前提。在马克思所写的标题为“所谓的原始积累”的章节中，与通常的叙述没有基本区别：关于殖民体制和奴隶贸易、货币和国债的发展也能在其他地方找到。这些过程导致资本“从头到脚，每一个毛孔都滴着血和污秽”，但这并没有阻止马克思将武装世界贸易中的掠夺行为视为资本主义的基本前提之一。尽管他批评了这些做法的常见评价，但对马克思而言，从欧洲主权地区发动的贸易战争，一直到对中国的鸦片战争，都是“原始积累”的主要时刻。 没有人能否认，武装贸易、奴隶贸易和殖民体制以一种至今仍有影响的方式改变了世界。但是马克思也犯了错误。尽管他对武装贸易的做法进行了无可争辩的准确描述，但这些做法带来的资本积累对首批资本主义国家的发展几乎没有任何作用。该假设——不仅在马克思那里可以找到——现在已经被研究在许多细节上驳斥了。结果很明显，尽管全球贸易和殖民地可以使个别人变得非常富有，但总的来说，这些企业却不是很有利可图。 由欧洲君主赋予特权的每一个贸易公司，随着时间的推移都破产了，大多数在18世纪末到19世纪初期就已破产。到了19世纪末，至少在英国，越来越多的人认为，从经济角度看，殖民统治基本上是一笔亏损生意。它使个别人非常富有，让许多人表现得像是主人，但由于高昂的成本，对各自母国的整体经济而言并不盈利。这当然不涉及政府希望并实际从殖民地获得的政治利益。 来自欧洲的特权贸易的普遍衰落，是由武装竞争成本所导致的。尽管商人也保护他们的据点免受当地人的潜在反抗，但他们主要必须在陆地和海上抵御其他欧洲商人的武装竞争。 在15、16和17世纪由欧洲发起的世界贸易中存在武装竞争，这一点与前期的世界贸易不同——这一点迄今为止几乎没有得到足够的关注。因为在13和14世纪，亚洲的城市贸易中心和非洲东海岸之间存在着一套有规律的贸易关系体系。欧洲商人也参与其中，尽管相对边缘化。与后来的世界市场不同的是，它的相对和平特性。由专门的守卫保卫的不同地方没有阻止对商人的所有袭击，但武装竞争并非该世界市场的特征。这是一个相对稳定的系统。即使是被经常引用为促进来自欧洲的世界贸易迅速发展的原因的航海艺术和金融技术，也未能在14世纪的疫情打断了进一步的城市化进程，从而动摇了这个贸易系统的基础时保障它的持续。这个最初的世界贸易系统的存在在理论上值得考虑，因为它明确指出需要解释的不是来自欧洲的世界贸易的开始，而是为什么它从一开始就是如此充满暴力。我将其归咎于君主统治与特权之间的联系，并认为这种联系的巩固可能是前资本主义世界贸易对资本主义发展的最重要贡献。 马克思也提到了特权贸易公司。他将它们称为“Monopolia公司”，并指出他从路德那里借用了这个术语。为了他们的特权，更确切地说：为了排除潜在竞争者的统治性安排，贸易公司必须向授予特权的君主支付。由于这些收入，欧洲君主对成功的远洋贸易以及由他们授权的商人实施的掠夺行为感兴趣。这些掠夺行为不仅影响了远方世界的当地人。在16和17世纪，欧洲商人也相互袭击、抢劫和争斗。由于君主从这些做法中获益，他们的统治发展与世界市场上武装竞争的发展密切相关。尽管如此，瓦勒斯坦误入歧途，当他将现代欧洲国家的形成描述为欧洲扩张动力的效应时。他认为这导致了欧洲不再由君主统治，而是出现了国家权力。了解到在20世纪末，许多南美洲和世界其他地区的人倾向于接受这些解释作为解释他们面临的持续劣势的原因是可以理解的，但这是基于对前资本主义贸易的理论概念，这一概念并未公正地反映其实际的历史表现。 马克思已经更正确地了解了这一点。在《资本论》第三卷中关于商人资本的小部分中，他指出，虽然贸易通常会带来变化，但它不具备自主的发展决定力。相反，贸易的影响取决于一个地区占主导地位的生产方式的性质。换句话说，无法仅从商业资本的影响充分解释资本主义生产形式的发展。尽管马克思也认为商业资本是“资本的第一个自由存在形式”，但这与假设资本主义的开始可追溯到商业公司及其汇票和国际贸易的其他工具的发展有很大的距离。马克思有不同并且我认为是正确的看法。"},{"instruction":"请将“In dem Text über das Kaufmannskapital erläutert Marx den Unterschied zwischen Kaufmannskapital und kapitalistischem Handelskapital. Das letztere, so führt er aus, ist ein Kapital unter anderen und muss nicht nur mit anderen Handelskapitalen konkurrieren, sondern auch - und dies ist entscheidend - mit der Möglichkeit von Industriekapitalisten, den Vertrieb ihrer Produkte selbst zu organisieren. Daraus erklärt sich, dass mit der Verallgemeinerung kapitalistischer Verhältnisse, die im Vorkapitalismus gängige Differenz der Gewinnspanne zwischen Kaufleuten auf der einen, sowie Handwerkern und Manufakturbesitzern auf der anderen Seite endete. Vor der Verbreitung des Kapitalismus war nicht nur im Fernhandel, sondern auch im regionalen Handel mit besonderen Risiken zu rechnen gewesen. Eine der Erklärungen für die Herkunft des Terminus „Risiko“ gibt an, „risco“ sei ein Wort für „Klippe“ gewesen, für eine Gefahr also, die im Seehandel immer präsent war. Sofern Kaufleute aber weder durch Räuber noch durch Felsenriffe oder Naturgewalten um den Besitz der von ihnen auf die eine oder andere Weise erworbenen Ware gebracht worden waren, konnten sie davon profitieren, dass weder Handwerker, noch Gutsbesitzer oder Manufakturunternehmer in der Lage gewesen wären, sich selbst um den Vertrieb ihrer Waren zu kümmern, weshalb Marx es denn auch gewagt hat, ein Gesetz zu formulieren: Die selbständige Entwicklung des Kaufmannskapitals stehe im umgekehrten Verhältnis zur Entwicklung der kapitalistischen Produktion.11 Und noch deutlicher: Solange das Handelskapital den Produktentausch zwischen unentwickelten Gemeinwesen vermittelt, erscheint der kommerzielle Profit nicht nur als Übervorteilung und Prellerei, sondern entspringt größtenteils aus ihr.12 Marx erklärt dann Seeraub, Sklavenraub sowie die Unterjochung in Kolonien aus dieser Charakteristik. In diesem Zusammenhang wird auch Sklaverei erwähnt, und zwar als Beispiel für andere nicht-kapitalistische Produktionsweisen wie sie in China, Indien oder Holländisch Indien praktiziert wurden. Marx wusste, dass die Sklavenwirtschaft, wie sie zu seiner Zeit auf den Zuckerinseln und vor allem in den Südstaaten der USA betrieben wurde, profitabel sein konnte und zumeist auch profitabel war, er tat sich aber sehr schwer, das auch für seine theoretische Argumentation zu berücksichtigen. Weil von Sklaven keine Organisation und damit keine Beteiligung am revolutionären Umsturz bestehender Verhältnisse erwartet werden konnte, stand ihm seine Revolutionshoffnung im Wege, wenn es darum gegangen wäre, den kapitalistischen Charakter der modernen Sklavenwirtschaft zu analysieren. Damit lag er falsch. Doch das ist heute nicht unser Thema. Stattdessen ist nun noch einmal zu der von Marx entwickelten analytischen Konzeption der ursprünglichen Akkumulation und ihrer Ergänzung durch Marcel van der Linden zurückzukehren. Voraussetzung des Kapitalismus seien nicht nur Kapital und Arbeitskräfte, die sich gezwungen sehen, ihre Arbeitskraft zumindest zeitweise durch Besitzer von Produktionsmitteln vernutzen zu lassen, erforderlich sei auch das Zusammentreffen von Kapital und Arbeit. Unbestreitbar hat der Freihandel einzelne Kaufleute sowie einzelne Aktienbesitzer und auch einzelne Angestellte der großen Handelsgesellschaften sehr reich gemacht, dadurch wurden sie aber nicht zu Kapitalisten in spe. Sie nutzten die Möglich-keiten, die ihnen Monopole boten, verteidigten diese mit politischen Zähnen und Klauen sowie mit Waffengewalt, waren im allgemeinen aber kaum bestrebt, ihre Geschäftsbeziehungen auszuweiten. Robert Brenner hat nachgewiesen, dass führende Londoner Kaufleute selbst in der ersten Hälfte des 17. Jahrhunderts noch keineswegs dauernd bestrebt waren, den geographischen Aktionsradius ihrer Geschäfte auszuweiten.13 Und ganz sicher träumten die fürstlichen privilegierten Kaufleute nicht von einer Wirtschaftsform, in der solche Begünstigung nicht mehr vorgesehen war. Vor allem aber: Von Ausnahmen abgesehen investierten europäische Kaufleute des 16., des 17. und auch noch des 18. Jahrhunderts ihre Gewinne nicht in den Aufbau neuer Produktionsformen. Vorherrschend waren eher Investitionen in Land und in Amtsgewalt, in Anlagen also, die den aktuellen und zukünftigen sozialen Aufstieg der Familie sichern sollten. Weil die meisten Menschen in genau der Gesellschaft nach Anerkennung streben, in der sie leben, sind diese Verhaltensweisen mehr als einleuchtend. Nicht dieses Argument, wohl aber die Tatsache findet sich auch bei Marx. Kaufleute hätten zwar gelegentlich in Luxusindustrien investiert oder seien zu Verlegern geworden, die kleine Produzenten (Marx schreibt „Selbstproduzenten“) ausbeuteten, nicht aber zu Industriellen.14 Inzwischen herrscht unter Historikern und Historikerinnen weitgehende Einigkeit darüber, dass das Ausmaß des im Welthandel akkumulierten Kapitals keinen Einfluss auf die Entwicklung des Industriekapitalismus hatte. Neuerdings ist diese Argumentation noch dadurch untermauert worden, dass Kenneth Pommeranz dargelegt hat, wie vergleichsweise wenig Kapital für den Beginn der industriellen Revolution erforderlich war. Das gelte auch für die Dampfmaschine, deren Bedeutung für die Entwicklung der Industriellen Revolution in England zu Recht hervorgehoben werde. Ihre Verbreitung habe aber vor allem darauf basiert, dass zuvor die Produktion der für ihren Betrieb erforderlichen Kohle ausgeweitet worden sei.15 Anders als für die industrielle Produktion insgesamt hat die neuere Forschung für einzelne Produktionszweige aber durchaus einen Einfluss des Weltmarkts konstatiert. Die in Liverpool produzierten Ketten und Halseisen wurden von Sklavenhaltern in Übersee in erheblichem Umfang nachgefragt, der Beschlag von Schiffsrümpfen mit Kupfer verlängerte die Lebensdauer von Schiffen, und in England stieg nicht nur die Nachfrage nach Kaffee, Kakao und Tee, sondern auch die nach Zucker. Das zeitweise dominante Erklärungsmodell des sog. Drei- eckshandels16 ist inzwischen zwar in mehrfacher Hinsicht relativiert worden, unbestreitbar aber ist, dass der Erwerb von Menschen, die zu Sklaven gemacht worden waren, in vielen Regionen der Welt zur Voraussetzung kapitalistischer Produktion wurden. Die Märkte für den Handel mit Arbeitskraft entwickelten sich von Anfang an im globalen Zusammenhang. Wird die theoretische Konzeption einer zwar durch Krisen erschütterten, insgesamt aber kontinuierlichen Entwicklung des Weltmarkts vom 15. bis zum 21. Jahrhundert in Frage gestellt, so muss zumindest ansatzweise diskutiert werden, wann aus dem vorkapitalistischen Markt ein kapitalistischer wurde. Es sind vor allem zwei Veränderungen, die diesen Übergang markieren und damit auch zeitlich einordnen. Da war zunächst einmal die revolutionäre Zerschlagung des vorherigen Regimes der Privilegien, die zur Begünstigung von Kaufleuten durch den herrschaftlichen Ausschluss von Konkurrenz auf der einen und zur Begünstigung von Fürsten durch die Zahlungen der Privilegierten auf der anderen Seite geführt hatten. Sofern es nach der Etablierung kapitalistischer Staatsgewalt weiterhin an Personen gebundene Begünstigungen gab, wie dies bei manchen Konzessionsgesellschaften in Kolonien durchaus der Fall sein konnte, galt dies ebenso als Korruption wie etwaige direkte Zahlungen an Politiker.17 Die zweite Veränderung, an der ich das Ende des vorkapitalistischen Weltmarktes festmache, ist das Ende der Ansprüche auf politische Hoheit über bestimmte Meeresregionen. Es lässt sich auf das Jahr 1849 datieren.18 Zuvor war mehr als drei Jahrhunderte lang die herrschaftliche Beschränkung von Konkurrenz nicht nur im Wege der Privilegierung von Handelsgesellschaften erfolgt, sondern auch durch den Versuch von Fürsten, sich die Hoheit über bestimmte Regionen der Weltmeere und damit auch über den Handel, der an den jeweiligen Küsten betrieben werden konnte, zu sichern. Rückblickend wurde diese Strategie als mare clausum bezeichnet. Zunächst war sie vor allem von Portugal und Spanien verfolgt worden, aber auch die Hanse hatte versucht, den Zugang nicht-hansischer Konkurrenz zur Seefahrt auf Nord- und Ostsee mit Waffengewalt zu unterbinden. In den folgenden Jahrhunderten forderten jeweils diejenigen Fürsten, deren Untertanen im Fernhandel unterlegen waren, dass das Meer nicht herrschaftlich geschlossen, sondern für alle frei zu befahren sein solle, ihre Untertanen also nicht daran gehindert werden sollten, alle sieben Meere zu befahren und überall Handel zu treiben. Solange englischer Handel und englische Marine noch um ihre internationale Vormachtstellung kämpften, hat auch die englische Krone mare liberum, also die weltweite Freigabe der Schifffahrt gefordert. 1651 aber, und damit zwei Jahre nach dem Ende vorbürgerlicher königlicher Herrschaft in England, beschloss das Englische Parlament die sogenannten Navigationsgesetze. Während die Krone zuvor fremde Schiffe nur von den Seegebieten vor den britischen Küsten hatte fernhalten wollen, wurde nun festgelegt, dass Waren aus und zu englischen Besitzungen in Übersee nur auf englischen Schiffen transportiert werden durften, und jeder Handel mit einer englischen Kolonie einen englischen Hafen als Zwischenhandelsplatz nutzen musste. Ähnliche Gesetze wurden auch andernorts erlassen,19 nirgends aber ebenso systematisch militärisch durchzusetzen versucht.”翻译为中文","output":"在关于商人资本的文本中，马克思阐明了商人资本与资本主义贸易资本之间的区别。他解释说，后者是众多资本之一，不仅必须与其他贸易资本竞争，而且——这一点至关重要——也要与工业资本家有可能自己组织其产品销售的能力竞争。这就解释了为什么随着资本主义关系的普遍化，预资本主义时期商人与工匠及制造业主之间常见的利润差异结束了。在资本主义传播之前，不仅在远程贸易中，而且在区域贸易中也存在特殊风险。关于“风险”一词的起源之一的解释称，“risco”是指“悬崖”，即海上贸易常遇到的危险。只要商人没有因为海盗、岩礁或自然灾害而失去他们以某种方式获得的商品，他们就能从中获利，因为无论是工匠、地主还是制造业企业主都无法自己负责销售他们的商品，因此马克思也敢于提出一个定律：商人资本的独立发展与资本主义生产的发展成反比。更明确地说：只要贸易资本介导未开发社区之间的产品交换，商业利润不仅表现为欺骗和诈骗，而且主要源于此。马克思然后解释了海上掠夺、奴隶掠夺以及在殖民地的征服来自这种特性。在这方面也提到了奴隶制，作为中国、印度或荷属东印度实践的其他非资本主义生产方式的一个例子。马克思知道，他所处时代的糖岛和特别是美国南方州实行的奴隶经济可能是有利可图的，并且通常也是有利可图的，但他很难在理论论证中考虑到这一点。因为奴隶无法组织，因此不能参与推翻现有关系的革命，所以他的革命希望妨碍了他分析现代奴隶经济的资本主义特性。这方面他是错误的。但这不是我们今天的主题。 相反，现在要再次回到由马克思发展的原始积累的分析概念及其由马塞尔·范德琳登补充的内容。资本主义的前提不仅是资本和被迫至少暂时地让生产资料持有者利用其劳动力的劳动者，还需要资本和劳动力的相遇。毫无疑问，自由贸易使一些商人、一些股东以及一些大型贸易公司的雇员变得非常富有，但这并没有使他们成为潜在的资本家。他们利用了垄断提供的机会，用政治手段和武力捍卫这些权利，但通常并不急于扩大他们的商业联系。罗伯特·布伦纳已经证明，即使在17世纪上半叶，领先的伦敦商人也远非总是致力于扩大他们业务的地理范围。而且，那些享有皇家特权的商人肯定不梦想一种不再提供这种优待的经济形式。最重要的是：除了少数例外，16、17、甚至18世纪的欧洲商人并未将他们的利润投资于新的生产形式。主要的投资是土地和官职，这些投资旨在确保家族的当代和未来社会地位的提升。因为大多数人都在他们所在的社会中寻求认可，这些行为模式非常合理。 尽管马克思没有使用这个论点，但他确实提到了这个事实。他说商人偶尔投资于奢侈品行业或成为出版商，剥削小生产者（马克思写的是“自我生产者”），但不成为工业家。 目前，历史学家们普遍认同，通过世界贸易积累的资本规模对工业资本主义的发展没有影响。最近，肯尼斯·庞梅兰兹还进一步支持了这个论点，他指出，开启工业革命所需的资本相对较少。这点也适用于蒸汽机，其对英格兰工业革命的发展的重要性被正确地强调了。但其普及主要是基于之前对其运行所需的煤炭生产的扩张。 对于工业生产整体而言，尽管最新研究指出世界市场对于某些特定生产部门确实有影响。在利物浦生产的锁链和脚镣被海外奴隶主大量需求，给船体加铜提高了船只的寿命，而在英国，对咖啡、可可和茶的需求不仅增加，对糖的需求也增加了。所谓的三角贸易模型虽然在多个方面被相对化，但不可否认的是，购买被奴役者在世界许多地区成为资本主义生产的前提条件。从一开始，劳动力贸易市场就在全球范围内发展。 如果从15世纪到21世纪世界市场持续发展的理论概念受到质疑，那么至少需要初步讨论，从什么时候开始，前资本主义市场变成了资本主义市场。主要有两个变化标志这个转变并因此进行时间上的定位。首先是革命性打破了之前特权制度，该制度通过统治性排除竞争一方面有利于商人，通过特权者对君主的支付另一方面有利于君主。在建立资本主义国家权力之后，如果仍存在与个人相关的特权，如在一些殖民地的特许公司中，这同样被视为腐败，如同直接向政治家支付款项。第二个变化，我认为标志着前资本主义世界市场的结束，是对某些海域政治主权要求的结束。可以追溯到1849年。此前三个多世纪，通过特权商业公司的优待不仅是限制竞争的方式，也通过君主试图确保对特定世界海域及其沿岸可进行贸易的政治统治。回顾来看，这一策略被称为封闭海域。最初主要由葡萄牙和西班牙采用，但汉萨同盟也试图用武力阻止非汉萨竞争对手进入北海和波罗的海的航道。在后来的几个世纪，那些在远洋贸易中落后的君主的臣民要求海洋不应该是君主专属，而应该是所有人都可以自由航行的，他们的臣民因此不应该被阻止航行世界各海并到处贸易。当英国的贸易和海军还在争夺国际霸权时，英国王室也要求海洋自由，即全球航行的自由。然而，在1651年，也就是在英格兰结束非资产阶级王权两年后，英格兰议会通过了所谓的航海法案。虽然之前王室只想将外国船只从英国海域赶走，但现在规定从英国海外领地进出的货物只能通过英国船只运输，且与英国殖民地的任何贸易都必须经过英国港口作为中转贸易点。其他地方也颁布了类似法律，但没有哪里像英国那样系统地试图军事执行。"},{"instruction":"请将“Die Navigationsgesetze provozierten einen Aufschwung des Schmuggels zur See, und dies nicht zuletzt in den Küstenstädten englischer Kolonien in Nordamerika. Schmuggler praktizierten den vorläufig noch militärisch gebremsten freien Handel. Nach der Unabhängigkeit nordamerikanischer Kolonien galten die Navigationsgesetze zwar fort, ließen sich aber kaum noch durchsetzen. Was das für den internationalen Handel bedeutete, lässt sich daran ablesen, dass es Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts auch Bremische Kaufleute wagen konnten, Schiffe nach Baltimore zu entsenden. Dass Bremen zu einem bis heute nachwirkenden Zentrum des Imports von Baumwolle und Kaffee wurde, geht auf diese Situation des erfolgreichen Schmuggels bremischer Schiffseigner zurück. Sie hat der seit dem Niedergang der Hanse wirksamen Beschränkung der deutschen Handelsschifffahrt auf Küstenschifffahrt ein Ende gesetzt. 1854 wurden die Navigationsgesetze endgültig abgeschafft. Als Marx über die Parlamentsdebatten berichtete, in denen um die Beteiligung am Krimkrieg gestritten wurde, kommentierte er, die Manchesterschule wolle sich nicht am Krieg beteiligen, weil sie auf dem Weltmarkt jetzt mit Baumwollballen kämpfen wolle.20 Wir können ergänzen: angesichts zunehmender ökonomischer Dominanz erschien der Einsatz der Navy zur Sicherung der englischen Vormachtstellung im internationalen Handel nicht mehr ganz so notwendig und womöglich sogar eher hinderlich. Die Freiheit der Hohen See von aller nationalen Gebietshoheit ist zwar erst 1982 durch das von der UNO beschlossene Law of the Ocean formalisiert worden, seit Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts gilt sie aber als international durchgesetzt. Die Aufhebung der Navigationsgesetze machte es möglich, dass sich auch ausländische Schiffe am Handel zwischen England und englischen Kolonien in Asien beteiligten. Weil die Heuern auf preußischen Schiffen extrem niedrig waren, konnten auch deren Eigner jetzt erfolgreich um Frachten für ferne Ziele konkurrieren. Und dies, obwohl es in Preußen vorläufig noch keine Schiffe gab, die so gebaut gewesen wären, dass sie sich an der um 1830 einsetzenden Konkurrenz um besonders schnelle Fahrten hätten beteiligen können. Um die Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts erfolgte in einem der damals führenden seefahrenden Staaten nach dem anderen die Umwandlung von Seeleuten in Arbeitskräfte, die mittels besonderer Strafgesetze zu reinen Befehlsempfängern gemacht werden sollten. Der Beginn der freien Konkurrenz um Schiffsladungen korrespondiert mit der Industrialisierung der Schifffahrt, worunter nicht die Einführung der Dampftechnik zu verstehen ist, sondern die Unterordnung seemännischer Arbeit unter das Kommando von Schiffsführern. Diesen wurden jetzt - ganz ähnlich wie Kapitänen in den Kriegsmarinen - staatliche Kompetenzen übertragen. Damit wurde gesichert, was David Ricardo in seiner Theorie der komparativen Vorteile des internationalen Handels bereits unterstellt hatte: für die theoretische Aussage, dass internationaler Handel allen Ländern nutzt, wenn sie jeweils diejenigen Güter exportieren, bei deren Produktion sie über einen komparativen Vorteil verfügen, mussten Kosten des Transports nicht in Rechnung gestellt werden. Schon zu Ricardos Zeiten waren sie außerordentlich gering. Seither sind sie im Verhältnis zu Produktionskosten weiterhin gesunken. Dieses Referat steht im Zusammenhang einer Veranstaltung, die den Ursachen, Formen und Wirkungen von Krisen des Weltmarktes gilt. Mein eigener Beitrag zu dieser Diskussion besteht in der nachdrücklichen Betonung der Wirkung politischer Entscheidungen auf die Entwicklung des Weltmarktes. Statistik ist in diesem Fall ein schlagendes Argument: Erst Anfang der 1970er Jahre hat der Anteil der Weltproduktion, der international gehandelt wurde, wieder das Ausmaß von 1913 erreicht. Die politischen Entscheidungen, die den zwischenzeitlichen Rückgang verursacht haben, erfolgten zwar im Zusammenhang ökonomischer Verhältnisse, lassen sich aus diesen allein aber nicht zureichend erklären. Entgegen verbreiteter Annahmen gilt dies auch für den Umbruch des Weltmarkt in der Mitte der 1970er Jahre. Und damit sind wir bei der im Titel angekündigten Diskussion des Abkommens von Bretton Woods, genauer gesagt: bei den Wirkungen seines Zusammenbruchs. Das 1944 in dem kleinen Ort Bretton Woods beschlossene Abkommen sollte eine neue Weltwährungskrise dadurch verhindern, dass feste Wechselkurse im Verhältnis zum Dollar und folglich auch zu den anderen beteiligten Währungen eingerichtet wurden. Um eventuell auftretende Schwierigkeiten zu überwinden, wurden kleinere Korrekturen beschlossen, und es wurde der Weltwährungsfonds (IWF) gegründet. Entgegen der Einwände vor allem des Vertreters der britischen Regierung, John Maynard Keynes, wurde in Bretton Woods der Dollar als internationale Leitwährung etabliert und festgelegt, dass die USA Anforderungen von ausländischen Notenbanken, ihre Dollarguthaben in Gold umzutauschen, nachkommen würden.21 Mit Ausnahme von John Maynard Keynes konnte sich 1944 kaum jemand vorstellen, dass die Goldvorräte der USA einmal nicht mehr ausreichen würden, solchen Umtausch regelmäßig vorzunehmen. Eben dies ist dann aber doch eingetreten: Im Kalten Krieg zahlten die USA erhebliche Summe an Regierungen in Entwicklungsländern, die dazu dienen sollten, eine politische Orientierung dieser Regierungen auf die Sowjetunion zu verhindern. Faktisch haben diese Zahlungen in vielen Ländern kaum Entwicklung befördert, wohl aber ein System der ausländischen Alimentierung lokaler Führungskräfte etabliert. Ausgewirkt hat sich auch, dass die Regierung der USA Geld drucken ließ, um die Kosten für den Vietnam-Krieg aufzubringen. Damit entwertete sie den Dollar, musste ihn aber nach wie vor zum festgelegten Satz in Gold konvertieren, wenn dies von ausländischen Notenbanken gefordert wurde. Die Situation verschlechterte sich zusätzlich, weil die Förderung von Gold nicht in dem Maße stieg, wie das 1944 unterstellt worden war. Bereits in den 1960er Jahren kam es dann auch bereits zur Herausbildung des sog. Euro-Dollar-Marktes, einer Entwicklung, die im Rückblick als Vorläuferin des heute immensen Offshore Systems zu werten ist.22 Viele US-Firmen transferierten damals ihre Gewinne nicht zurück in die USA, sondern deponierten sie in europäischen, insbesondere britischen Banken. Die Banken arbeiteten mit diesen sog. Euro-Dollars - und zwar zu Bedingungen, die, weil es sich nicht um die heimische Währung handelte, nicht den heimischen Kredit- und Mindestreservevorschriften unterlagen. Um einer möglichen Einfrierung von Guthaben in den USA vorzubeugen, gingen auch immer mehr ölproduzierende Länder dazu über, die in Dollar erhaltenen Erlöse für Öl nicht in den USA, sondern in Europa zu deponieren. Entsprechend verfuhr die Sowjetunion. Damit entwickelte sich ein internationaler Kapitalmarkt außerhalb der nationalen Regulierungen. Heute spricht man noch immer von Euro-Dollar-Geschäften, doch sind damit jetzt alle Geschäfte gemeint, die in einer Fremdwährung getätigt werden. Historisch bedeutete die Entwicklung des Euro-Dollar-Marktes eine Schwächung der Wirkungsweise des Systems von Bretton Woods von den Rändern her. Denn mit Euro-Dollar-Geschäften ließen sich die Kapitalverkehrskontrollen - bei Duldung der jeweils zuständigen Regierungen - zumindest teilweise umgehen. Letzten Endes waren es dann aber wohl weniger die Euro-Dollar-Märkte als die veränderten Bilanzen des Handels der USA mit der Bundesrepublik und mit Japan, die zum Ende des Systems von Bretton Woods führte. Durch den Aufschwung dieser beiden Wirtschaften war es zu immer mehr Dollarreserven in den Notenbanken dieser Länder gekommen. Die US-Zentralbank sah sich nicht mehr in der Lage, sie auf Verlangen in Gold zu konvertieren. 1971 kündigte die Regierung der USA an, in Zukunft seien Dollar nicht mehr frei in Gold konvertierbar. 1973 kündigte sie das Abkommen von Bretton Woods endgültig auf. Weil damit die festen Wechselkurse endeten, konnte jetzt auf Wechselkursänderungen spekuliert werden. Diese politische Entscheidung eröffnete also ganz neue Möglichkeiten der spekulativen Investition auf dem Markt für Währungen. Andererseits bedeutete die Freigabe der Wechselkurse für alle, die Güter exportierten oder importierten, ein erhebliches Risiko. Um die potentiell negativen Wirkungen einer Veränderung der Geldwerte zwischen dem Abschluss eines Vertrages und der tatsächlichen Transaktion abzuschwächen, wurden Wechselkurssicherungsgeschäfte gebräuchlich. Bald wurden die zu diesem Zweck entwickelten Finanzprodukte aber nicht mehr nur im Zusammenhang von Gütertransaktionen eingesetzt, sondern als eine neue Art von Spekulationsobjekten angeboten. Inzwischen übertrifft der Handel mit derartigen Finanzprodukten den Handel mit Währungen zum Zwecke des Warenaustausches um ein Vielfaches. Durch die Festlegung des Dollars als Leitwährung war die Möglichkeit der Krise von Anfang an in der Konstruktion des Weltwährungssystems von Bretton Woods angelegt gewesen. Real wurde sie durch Entscheidungen über Krieg und Frieden und die politische Duldung von Euro-Dollar-Geschäften. Dennoch: So wichtig der Zusammenbruch des Weltwährungssystems von Bretton Woods auch war, die entscheidende Veränderung des Weltmarkts kam erst zustande als - ausgehend von den USA und der Schweiz - eine Regierung nach der anderen den Forderungen von Kapitaleignern entsprach und die Regulierung des Kapital- verkehrs beendeten. Jörg Huffschmid ist nie müde geworden darauf hinzuweisen, dass diese Entscheidungen nicht zwingend waren.23”翻译为中文","output":"航海法案促进了海上走私活动的兴起，特别是在北美英国殖民地的沿海城市。走私者实践了还未被军事限制的自由贸易。北美殖民地独立后，航海法案虽然仍然有效，但几乎无法再执行。这对国际贸易的意义可见于18世纪末，布雷门的商人甚至敢于派船只前往巴尔的摩。布雷门成为棉花和咖啡进口的持久中心，归功于布雷门船东成功走私的场景。这结束了自汉萨同盟衰落以来，德国商船仅限于沿岸航运的限制。 1854年，航海法案最终被废除。当马克思报道议会关于参与克里米亚战争的争论时，他评论说，曼彻斯特派不想参战，因为他们现在想用棉花包在世界市场上战斗。我们可以补充说：鉴于日益增长的经济主导地位，动用海军来确保英国在国际贸易中的优势地位变得不再那么必要，可能甚至变得有碍。海洋的自由免于所有国家的领土主权，虽然一直到1982年才通过联合国签署的《海洋法》正式确认，但自19世纪中叶起，它就被认为是国际认可的。 航海法案的废除使外国船只也能参与英国与亚洲英国殖民地之间的贸易。由于普鲁士船只的船员工资极低，因此它们的所有者现在也能成功地争夺远程目的地的货运。尽管在普鲁士暂时还没有能够参与大约1830年开始的特别快速航行竞争的船只建造。 19世纪中叶，在当时领先的海上国家之一接着一个地转变水手为劳动力发生了，他们通过特殊的惩罚法将其变成纯粹的命令接受者。货运市场自由竞争的开始与航运的工业化相对应，这里的工业化并不是指引入蒸汽技术，而是船员的海上劳动服从船长的指挥。如同战争海军的船长一样，现在也赋予了他们国家权限。这确保了大卫·李嘉图在他关于国际贸易比较优势理论中已经假设的内容：为了理论上的论断——国际贸易对所有国家都有利，只要他们出口在生产中具有比较优势的商品——运输成本不必计入。在李嘉图时代，它们已经非常低。此后，相对于生产成本，它们一直在下降。 这篇报告是在一个讨论世界市场危机的原因、形式和影响的活动中提出的。我对这场讨论的贡献在于强调政治决策对世界市场发展的影响。在这种情况下，统计数据是一个有力的论据：直到1970年代初，世界生产的国际贸易份额才重新达到1913年的水平。造成期间下降的政治决策虽然与经济条件有关，但单凭这些条件无法充分解释。与普遍观点相反，这同样适用于1970年代中期世界市场的转变。 因此，我们来讨论布雷顿森林协议的标题所宣告的讨论，更确切地说：讨论其崩溃的影响。1944年在小镇布雷顿森林签署的协议旨在通过设定固定的美元兑换率（进而也是与其他参与货币的兑换率），防止新的世界货币危机。为了克服可能出现的困难，决定了小幅度修正，并成立了国际货币基金组织（IMF）。尽管英国代表约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯提出了反对意见，布雷顿森林会议确立了美元作为国际主导货币，并规定美国将满足外国央行将其美元储备兑换成黄金的要求。1944年，除了凯恩斯，几乎没有人能想象美国的黄金储备有一天会不足以定期进行这种兑换。但这最终还是发生了：在冷战期间，美国向发展中国家的政府支付了大量资金，目的是防止这些政府政治上倾向苏联。实际上，这些支付在许多国家几乎没有促进发展，但确立了一种对外国领导层提供资助的系统。美国政府还印制了钞票，以支付越南战争的费用。这样做削弱了美元的价值，但根据规定，如果外国央行要求，美国仍必须以固定比率将美元兑换成黄金。由于黄金产量的增长没有达到1944年的预期，情况进一步恶化。到了1960年代，还出现了所谓的“欧元美元”市场的形成，回顾来看，这被视为今天庞大的离岸体系的前身。许多美国公司当时并没有将其利润汇回美国，而是将其存放在欧洲，尤其是英国的银行中。这些所谓的“欧元美元”——由于不是本国货币，因此不受本国信贷和准备金规定的约束——被银行使用。为了预防在美国可能的资金冻结，越来越多的石油生产国也开始将以美元获得的石油收入存放在欧洲而非美国。苏联也是这样做的。从而形成了一个国际资本市场，摆脱了国家监管。如今，人们还在谈论欧元美元交易，但现在指的是以外币进行的所有交易。从历史上看，欧元美元市场的发展削弱了布雷顿森林体系边缘的作用。因为通过欧元美元交易，可以至少部分绕过资本流动控制——在各自政府的默许下。 最终，可能不是欧元美元市场，而是美国与德国和日本的贸易余额变化导致了布雷顿森林体系的终结。这两个经济体的崛起导致了这些国家央行持有越来越多的美元储备。美国中央银行发现自己无法满足它们的兑换黄金的要求。1971年，美国政府宣布，美元将不再自由兑换成黄金。1973年，美国最终退出了布雷顿森林协议。由于固定汇率的终结，人们现在可以对汇率变动进行投机。这一政治决定为货币市场上的投机性投资打开了全新的可能性。另一方面，对于那些出口或进口商品的人来说，自由汇率带来了巨大的风险。为了减轻合同签订和实际交易之间货币价值变化可能带来的负面影响，采用了汇率保险交易。不久，为此目的开发的金融产品不仅用于商品交易，而且作为一种新型投机对象出售。如今，此类金融产品的交易量远远超过了货物交换目的的货币交易。 通过将美元定为主导货币，布雷顿森林体系从一开始就内含了危机的可能性。通过战争与和平的决策以及对欧元美元交易的政治容忍，这种可能性变成了现实。尽管如此，布雷顿森林世界货币体系的崩溃无疑非常重要，但真正决定性的世界市场变化是在美国和瑞士等国政府满足资本所有者的要求，终止了资本流动监管之后才发生的。约尔格·胡夫施密德从未厌倦地指出，这些决策并非不可避免。"},{"instruction":"请将“Kapitaleignern eröffneten sich damit ganz neue Möglichkeiten der Investition. Sie wurden umso bereitwilliger genutzt, als die Nachkriegskonjunktur bereits in den 1960er Jahren zu einem Ende gekommen war. Erfolge gewerkschaftlicher Lohnkämpfe hatten zu der ausnahmsweisen Situation eines profit squeeze zugunsten von Löhnen geführt, und die Systemkonkurrenz mit dem Ostblock legte eher eine Ausweitung als eine Kürzung von Sozialleistungen nahe. Dass das Weltwährungssystem von Bretton Woods die Investitionsmöglichkeiten beschränkt hatte, ist nicht die einzige Ursache für die Trente Glorieuses als die man in Frankreich die ersten Jahrzehnte nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg bezeichnet. Es hat aber erheblich dazu beigetragen, dass Lohnerhöhungen durchgesetzt werden konnten, die Profite schmälerten. Das Ende dieses Systems provozierte heftige nationalistische Konkurrenz um Investitionen. Die Verteidigung des Wirtschaftsstandortes wurde zur entscheidenden Leitlinie von Politik. Joachim Hirsch spricht von der Herausbildung von Wettbewerbsstaaten.24 Mit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion wurde diese kapitalistische Welt, in der das Prinzip der Konkurrenz zum politischen Leitmotiv erhoben worden war, nahezu global. Regierungen führender kapitalistischer Gesellschaften offerierten potentiellen Investoren den nationalen Standort durch die Senkung von Umsatzsteuern sowie die Aufweichung historisch erkämpfter Arbeiter- und Arbeiterinnenrechte.25 Gleichzeitig akzeptierten sie, dass sich Unternehmen bisheriger Regulierung entzogen. Nicht wenige der schnell wachsenden Zahl an Offshore Finanzzentren sind von Regierungen führender kapitalistischer Gesellschaften nicht nur geduldet, sondern zunächst auch gefördert worden. Infolge vermehrter Investitionen in Finanzmärkte sanken in den 1970er Jahren die Zuwachsraten der Weltproduktion und damit auch diejenigen des Welthandels. Schiffseigner, die jahrelang an hohe Zuwachsraten des Frachtaufkommens gewöhnt gewesen waren, sahen sich jetzt mit einem Überangebot an Frachtraum konfrontiert. Die Situation verschlechterte sich zusätzlich als die Betriebskosten von Schiffen immens anstiegen, weil die OPEC-Staaten beschlossen, die Preise für Rohöl zu erhöhen. Insbesondere im Bereich der Tankerschifffahrt war die Situation dramatisch. Denn in der Zeit der Hochkonjunktur des Öltransports waren viele neue riesige Tanker geordert worden. Sie mussten jetzt abgenommen werden. Große norwegische Tankerreedereien brachen zusammen, viele andere Reedereien gerieten in S chwierigkeiten. Es war aber vor allem der fast vollständige Zusammenbruch des Marktes für gebrauchte Schiffe, der die Weichen für die zukünftige Entwicklung stellte. Während auf diesem Markt zuvor oft Preise erzielt worden waren, die den ursprünglichen Kosten für den Neubau des Schiffes entsprachen, sanken diese jetzt drastisch. Das machte diese Schiffe auch für Unternehmen in Entwicklungsländern erschwinglich. Weil diese Unternehmen zwar häufig europäische Kapitäne und Schiffsoffiziere anheuerten, ansonsten aber auf sehr billige einheimische Arbeitskräfte zurückgreifen konnten, gelang es ihnen schnell, in den bislang begrenzten internationalen Markt für Seetransporte einzudringen. Diese Situation veranlasste immer mehr europäische Reeder, nach einschneidenden Möglichkeiten der Kostenreduktion Ausschau zu halten. Neben der Senkung von Kosten mittels Technisierung und drastischer Verringerung von Besatzungsstärken wurde zunehmend von „Ausflaggungen“ Gebrauch gemacht. Es wurden jetzt also Schiffe in das Schiffsregister eines anderen Staates eingetragen als es der Staat war, in dem die Profite aus dem Betrieb des Schiffes anfielen. Handelte es sich bei dieser Wahl eines fremden Schiffsregisters und damit einer fremden Flagge zunächst noch um Ausnahmen, so ist „Ausflaggung“ inzwischen eine im Seetransport übliche betriebswirtschaftliche Praxis. Die Möglichkeit der Ausflaggung ist im internationalen Seerecht angelegt. Denn das Recht, das Meer zu befahren, wurde historisch nicht etwa als Recht für Individuen (oder Unternehmen) etabliert, sondern nur als Recht souveräner Staaten. Um legal Seetransport zu betreiben, müssen Schiffe deshalb die Flagge eines als souverän anerkannten Staates führen. Sie sind - genauer: sie waren - schwimmende Bestandteile eines nationalen Rechtsraums. Formal sind sie das zwar immer noch, faktisch besteht heute aber ganz überwiegend nur noch eine fiktive Beziehung zwischen Schiff und Flaggenstaat. In der Folge des Zusammenbruchs jenes Weltwährungssystems, das in Bretton Woods beschlossen worden war, wird Handelsschifffahrt ganz überwiegend nicht mehr im Zusammenhang national spezifischer politischer Ökonomien betrieben, sondern in einer Sphäre des „Kapitalismus pur“. Zahlreiche Schiffsunglücke haben dazu geführt, dass internationale Regulierungen und Kontrollsysteme geschaffen wurden, welche die früher nationale Regulierung und Kontrolle der Seefahrt ersetzen sollen. In Ansätzen ist das auch tatsächlich gelungen, weshalb Ausflaggungen heute auch seltener genutzt werden, um an Ausgaben für Sicherheit zu sparen. Entscheidend geblieben aber ist das Angebot der Flags of Convenience, auf Regeln für die nationale Zusammensetzung des Personals zu verzichten, weshalb sich Schiffsunternehmen ihre Arbeitskräfte völlig legal überall dort auf der Welt beschaffen können, wo sie gerade besonders billig sind. Von wenigen Offizieren abgesehen, sind Seeleute nicht mehr Angestellte einer Reederei, sondern eines Heuerbüros in ihrem Herkunftsland. Mehr als 90% aller international gehandelten Güter werden zumindest einen Teil des Weges auf Schiffen transportiert, und der Handel mit Gütern ist noch immer ein erheblicher Bestandteil des Weltmarktes. Realisiert wird der dafür erforderliche Transport durch Seeleute, die ihre Arbeit genau besehen in einem rechtlichen Niemandsland ausüben. Die Internationale Arbeitsorganisation beschließt Konventionen. Angesichts der ökonomischen Machtverhältnisse im Seetransport ist deren Realitätsgehalt begrenzt.26 Vorläufig sehe ich noch nicht, dass „Binding Treaty“ diese Situation beenden wird.27 11.

Abgesehen von der japanischen Besatzungsherrschaft über Korea in der Zeit von 1910 bis 1945 hatte kein anderer Kolonialstaat einen Apparat zur Verfügung, dessen schierer Umfang es ermöglicht hätte, den Alltag der Beherrschten tatsächlich zu kontrollieren.1 Unabhängig davon, ob koloniale Staatsgewalt in der Lage war, über die Menschen und den Reichtum in einem beanspruchten Territorium tatsächlich zu herrschen, hat koloniale Staatsgewalt aber allenthalben Grenzen gezogen.

Ebenso wie im Ancien Regime war die Aneignung mittels bewaffneter Gewalt ein zentrales Element der Herrschaft. Und in beiden Herrschaftsformen richtete sich Ordnungspolitik in erster Linie auf die Verhinderung von Revolten, wobei Kritik an besonders drastischer Unterdrückung im einen wie im anderen Falle in der Gefahr stand, als Revolte verstanden und bekämpft zu werden. Und ebenso wie in den Kolonien europäischer Metropolmächte hatte es auch in den meisten Gesellschaften des Ancien Regime keine Gleichheit vor dem Gesetz gegeben. Eine Ausnahme ist das Recht aller Untertanen der englischen Krone auf persönliche Freiheit, eine Freiheit, deren Kern zumeist darin gesehen wird, dass niemand ohne richterlichen Befehl verhaftet werden kann und das Recht hat, eine richterliche Haftprüfung zu verlangen (habeas corpus). 4 Materielle Rechtsungleichheit gab es freilich in allen Gesellschaften des Ancien Regime. Genau so wie es in Indien unnötig war, darauf hinzuweisen, dass der Straftatbestand „säumiger Koch“ faktisch keinen Europäer treffen konnte, war es auch in England unnötig, darauf hinzuweisen, dass Adlige nicht von den drakonischen Gesetzen gegen Wilderer betroffen waren. Und auch für die nicht nur faktisch, sondern auch formal zugestandene strafrechtliche Kompetenz von Herren und Unternehmern, wie sie uns zuletzt bei den Plantagenbesitzern in Assam oder an der Ostküste von Sumatra begegnet ist, finden sich in den strafrechtlichen Kompetenzen vieler europäischer Grundherren eindrucksvolle Parallelen. Es gibt weitere Übereinstimmungen oder doch Ähnlichkeiten. Die tatsächliche Regierung (governance) der Bevölkerung blieb begrenzt. Das traffür Kolonien sicher sehr viel deutlicher zu als für Gesellschaften des Ancien Regime, dennoch bestand tatsächliche Regierung in beiden politischen Sphären lange vor allem als Anspruch. Und erst allmählich konnte mehr oder minder kontrolliert werden, ob rechtliche und administrative Regulierung in tatsächliche Praxis umgesetzt wurde. In beiden Fällen lagen die Ursachen für die Grenzen tatsächlicher Regierung im Widerstand der Bevölkerung, sowie in zahlenmäßig begrenztem, schlecht bezahltem und vielfach vor allem an eigener Aneignung interessiertem Personal. Und doch treffen wir bei der Betrachtung von Prozessen der Verrechtlichung und Bürokratisierung bereits auf den ersten der grundlegenden Unterschiede zwischen kolonialer Staatsgewalt und staatlicher Herrschaft in Gesellschaften des europäischen Ancien Regime. Denn während es sich in den letzteren um Prozesse handelte, deren Basis in der Konkurrenz um jene Privilegien lag, die materiellen und sozialen Aufstieg ermöglichen oder verhindern sollten, handelte es sich in Kolonialstaaten um die Regulierung von Unterdrückung und Ausbeutung. Der Zusammenhang wird betont, wenn in Anlehnung an den Terminus „ warfare“ für Kolonien gelegentlich von „lawfare“ die Rede ist. (Comaroff 2001: 312 und passim) Recht etablierte zulässige Formen des Eigentums, Recht regulierte die Aneignung von Land, und Recht regulierte die zulässige Ausbeutung von Arbeitskraft. Auch wenn es sich bei der Verrechtlichung um nichts anderes handelte, als um die Legalisierung gewaltsam hergestellter Fakten (Kennedy 2006: 36), so zwangen Verordnungen und Gesetze diese Faktizität doch in das Gerüst des in den Kolonialmächten verbreiteten juristischen Denkens. Wurde gewaltsame Aneignung reguliert, so wurden in der Regel freie Entscheidungen von Individuen unterstellt. Lawfare sollte die Herrschaft von den Unsicherheiten befreien, die in bloßer Gewaltherrschaft immer enthalten sind. Es sollte die Eroberung auf Dauer stellen. Weil damit die Praxis der Herrschaft auf kurze Sicht eher kalkulierbar wurde und außerdem einen größeren zivilen Apparat erforderte, eröffneten Prozesse der Verrechtlichung und Bürokratisierung auch neue Möglichkeiten der Kollaboration und des Aufstiegs, folglich einer gewissen sozialen Stabilisierung kolonialer Herrschaft. Auch wenn koloniale Herrschaft nirgends in der Lage war, alle Aspekte einheimischer Sozialbeziehungen zu regulieren, so haben doch Kontrolle sowie Unterdrückung auf der einen und Aufstiegs- sowie Erwerbschancen auf der anderen Seite die Art und Weise beeinflusst, in welcher sich diese Beziehungen veränderten.5 In beiden Herrschaftssphären gab es Rechte, die qua Geburt zugestanden oder verweigert wurden. In beiden begrenzte dieser Status die Chancen auf materiellen Erfolg, machte ihn aber nicht unmöglich. Was den sozialen Aufstieg anlangt, so war er in Gesellschaften des europäischen Ancien Regime durch Geschlecht, Religionszugehörigkeit sowie den rechtlichen und sozialen Status der Eltern begrenzt, in Kolonialstaaten aber zuvörderst durch die Zugehörigkeit zur einheimischen Bevölkerung. Dieses Hemmnis gegen den Aufstieg in die Herrschaftsschicht wurde weder während der gesamten Dauer europäischer Kolonialherrschaft, noch überall in gleicher Weise rassistisch definiert, aber die rechtliche und die alltägliche Herstellung einer fundamentalen Differenz zu Einheimischen war allgemein und durchgängig präsent. Rassistische Strukturen sind ein Merkmal aller kolonialen Herrschaft,6 aber nirgends waren sie unbarmherziger als in Siedlungskolonien. (Elkins 2005: passim) Die alltagspraktische und die rechtliche Bestimmung von Eingeborenen begrenzte den sozialen Aufstieg einzelner, vor allem aber machte sie einheimische Frauen und Männer zu potentiellen Objekten ökonomischer Ausbeutung. Wohl gab es in manchen Bereichen rechtliche Regelungen, die für alle Einwohner eines kolonialen Territorialstaates galten,7 auch verlangte englische Kolonialherrschaft am Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts, dass Gesetze rassenneutral formuliert wurden, und in Algerien wurde Einheimischen Rechtsgleichheit angeboten, sofern sie bereit waren, ihrem islamischen Glauben abzuschwören. (Osterhammel 1995/2009: 59) Auch im belgischen Kongo gab es - ab 1892 - offiziell die Möglichkeit der „Immatrikulation“, will sagen, der Erlangung eines neuen - zwischen Europäern und Afrikanern angesiedelten - Rechtsstatus. Voraussetzung war die Bereitschaft zur Anerkennung belgischer Gesetze. (Anstey 1970: 206) Faktisch bestand dennoch durchgängig ein Recht für die Herren und ein anderes für die „Eingeborenen“. Auch im belgischen Kongo erhielten die „Immatrikulierten“ (später wurden sie ebenso wie in französischen Kolonien als « evolues » bezeichnet) weder besseren Lohn noch Zugang zu den Kinos oder Hotels, die Europäern Vorbehalten waren. (Anstey 1970: 211) Von Anfang bis Ende bestimmten Kolonialstaaten, welche Menschen als „An-dere“ gelten sollten. Während solche Bestimmungen zumeist eher grobschlächtig verfuhren, entschieden in den USA bis 1944 Gerichte darüber, wie viel Anteile eines bestimmten nationalen „Blutes“ einen Menschen einer bestimmten Rasse zuordnete.8 Im Einzelnen beriefen sie sich dabei entweder auf vorhergehende Entscheidungen, auf Intentionen des Kongresses (congressionalintente) oder aber auf allgemein verbreitete Ansichten (commonknowledge).

(Lopez 2006: Appendix A) Die Besonderheit des kolonialen Gewaltmonopols Als Fürsten in Europa daran gingen, ihren Anspruch auf das Monopol legitimer Gewaltanwendung zu realisieren, sahen sie sich gezwungen, zumindest einige der zuvor mächtigen Adligen institutionell und materiell in ihre Herrschaft zu integrieren. Nur auf diese Weise konnte die selbständige Waffengewalt des Adels begrenzt werden. Entsprechend wurden auch in Kolonien traditionelle Herrscher, seien es Nawabs in Indien oder Häuptlinge in Afrika, alimentiert, um sie an der Wiederaufnahme von Kriegen gegen die Fremdherrschaft zu hindern. Und in beiden Herrschaftssphären schuf die mehr oder minder gelungene Integration traditionell autonomer Herrscher in den Staatsapparat die Voraussetzung dafür, dass alle, die sich der Staatsgewalt tatsächlich oder auch nur vermeintlich entgegen stellten, umso gnadenloser verfolgt werden konnten. Kolonialmächte verweigerten einheimischen Kriegern, die sich gegen sie stellten, den Status des Kriegsgegners. Weil damit jeder Widerstand in Kolonien als Rebellion definiert und behandelt wurde, lehnten die Metropolmächte auch die Geltung jener Prinzipien des internationalen Kriegsrechts ab, die darauf abzielten, Nichtkombattanten zu schützen und Gefangenen bestimmte Rechte zuzuerkennen. Ist aber ein bewaffneter Kampf als Rebellion definiert, so hat Staatsgewalt allen Verfassungen der Metropolstaaten zufolge das Recht, ihn mit allen dazu notwendigen Mitteln nieder zu schlagen. Noch weiter ging die definitorische Abwehr von Opposition im Falle des Aufstandes gegen die Kolonialmacht in Indien, als dieser in offiziellen Diskursen auf eine „Meuterei“ einheimischer Soldaten und damit auf ein allgemein als besonders schändlich gewertetes Verhalten reduziert wurde. Wurde Widerstand zur Rebellion erklärt, so wurde damit auch der Einsatz von umfassender Gewalt legitimiert. Solche Legitimationserfordernisse wurden zwar kaum je gegenüber der kolonisierten Bevölkerung anerkannt, wohl aber wurden sie gegenüber der internationalen politischen Öffentlichkeit für erforderlich gehalten. Am Beispiel der Eroberung der Philippinen durch die USA wird dieser Sachverhalt deutlich. Als die USA 1899 Spanien als Kolonialmacht nachfolgten, setzten die Einheimischen, die zuvor gegen die spanische Kolonialherrschaft gekämpft hatten, ihren Unabhängigkeitskampf fort. Solange die Abtretung der Philippinen an die USA nicht ratifiziert war, handelte es sich bei den kämpfenden Einheimischen um Freiheitskämpfer, für deren Unterdrückung die USA keinerlei international anerkannte Berechtigung gehabt hätten. Folglich herrschte Eile. Denn nur durch die Ratifizierung der Abtretung konnten die in den Philippinen um ihre Freiheit kämpfenden Einheimischen zu Rebellen gemacht werden. Sie wurde also beschleunigt. Sofort danach wurde auf Anordnung des Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten eine Militärregierung in den Philippinen etabliert. Generäle wie Soldaten gefielen sich darin, die nigger, als welche sie in Übertragung heimischer Erfahrungen und Urteile die für ihre Unabhängigkeit kämpfenden Einheimischen bezeichneten, nieder zu machen.9 Nicht alle Verfassungen von Metropolstaaten sahen die Möglichkeit vor, im Falle einer Gefährdung der Staatsgewalt zivile Schutzrechte außer Kraft zu setzen und die Staatsgewalt auf das Militär zu übertragen, aber alle Metropolmächte ermächtigten das Militär, im Falle eines Notstandes (emergency) Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, zu deren Anwendung es im Einzelfall nicht ausdrücklich ermächtigt worden war. Während deutsche und französische Generäle und Gouverneure darauf vertrauen konnten, dass die Anwendung von Gewalt gegen „Rebellen“ nachträglich auch dann von der Regierung des Metropollandes gebilligt wurde, wenn in der politischen Öffentlichkeit Kritik geäußert worden war, kam es im Vereinigten Königreich vereinzelt zu gerichtlichen Untersuchungen. Zwar stand militärischen und politischen Entscheidungsträgern auch der (ungeschriebenen) englischen Verfassung zufolge nicht nur das Recht, sondern sogar die Pflicht zu, eine Rebellion gegen die Staatsgewalt niederzuschlagen, aber ein Kriegsrecht (martiallaw) im Sinne der Aufhebung ziviler Staatsgewalt gab es nicht. In seiner 1885 erstmals erschienenen „Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution“ hat Albert Venn Dicey ausgeführt, dass nicht nur Entscheidungsträger, sondern sogar normale Bürger verpflichtet seien, mit den ihnen zur Verfügung stehenden Mitteln gegen Rebellionen vorzugehen (1885/1965: 289). In jedem Fall aber sei das Recht zur Anwendung von Gewaltmaßnahmen durch das Ausmaß des Notstandes sowohl bedingt als auch begrenzt. Und englischem Recht zufolge stehe nicht etwa den unmittelbar Beteiligten das letzte Wort darüber zu, welches Ausmaß der Bedrohung in einer bestimmten Situation geherrscht habe, vielmehr sei es Aufgabe von Gerichten, nach der Niederschlagung einer Rebellion „in Ruhe und Sicherheit“ darüber zu befinden. (1885/1965: 291) Aber selbstverständlich waren nicht alle Entscheidungsträger der Ansicht von Lord Broughan, der 1823 erklärte, es wäre eine extreme Kalamität, wenn das ganze Recht und die Konstitution von England auch nur eine Stunde länger durch Kriegsrecht außer Kraft gesetzt würde, als unbedingt erforderlich. (zit. Hussain 2003: 109) Da es keine eindeutigen Kriterien für die Bestimmung eines Staatsnotstandes gibt, war auch die verfassungsmäßige Berechtigung zu Gegenmaßnahmen davon abhängig, wie in einer bestimmten historischen Situation das Ausmaß von „Notstand“ (emergency) bestimmt wurde, und zwar sowohl von den Beteiligten selbst als auch von den Mitgliedern der Kommissionen, die anschließend eingesetzt wurden, um die getroffenen Maßnahmen zu bewerten, schließlich auch von den Gerichten, die über das Verhalten von Entscheidungsträgern zu urteilen hatten. Angesichts der Brutalität gegenüber einheimischen Widerständigen, die aus britischen Kolonien ebenso wie aus den Kolonien anderer europäischer Metropolstaaten überliefert sind, könnte vermutet werden, die Begrenzung der Entscheidungshoheit von zivilen und militärischen Führungskräften in den Kolonien durch nachträgliche gerichtliche Überprüfung sei Theorie geblieben. In der Geschichte britischer Kolonialherrschaft war dies jedoch nicht durchgängig der Fall. An zwei Beispielen ist dies etwas näher zu erläutern.”翻译为中文","output":"殖民地的日常实践和法律界定限制了个体的社会上升，但特别是使本地女性和男性成为经济剥削的潜在对象。确实，某些领域存在适用于殖民地领土所有居民的法律规定，19世纪末英国殖民统治要求法律必须种族中立，而在阿尔及利亚，向本地人提供了法律平等的机会，只要他们愿意放弃他们的伊斯兰信仰。（Osterhammel 1995/2009: 59）在比利时刚果，从1892年开始，官方提供了“注册”机会，即获取新的、位于欧洲人和非洲人之间的法律地位的机会。前提是接受比利时法律。（Anstey 1970: 206）然而，事实上始终存在着主人的一套法律和“土著”的另一套法律。即使在比利时刚果，“注册者”（后来与法国殖民地一样被称为« evolues »）既没有获得更好的工资，也没有进入专为欧洲人保留的电影院或酒店的权限。（Anstey 1970: 211） 从一开始到最后，殖民地国家定义哪些人应被视为“其他人”。尽管这些定义通常相当粗糙，但在1944年之前，美国的法院会决定某个特定国家的“血统”成分有多少能将一个人划归为某个特定种族。（Lopez 2006: Appendix A） 殖民地暴力垄断的特点 当欧洲的诸侯开始实现对合法暴力使用的垄断权时，他们被迫至少将一些之前有权势的贵族以制度化和物质化的方式融入他们的统治中。这是限制贵族独立武装力量的方法。相应地，在殖民地也对印度的纳瓦布或非洲的酋长进行了资助，以防止他们重新发动反抗外来统治的战争。在这两种统治领域中，以这种方式将传统独立统治者融入国家机器中，为了能更无情地追捕那些实际或被假定对国家权力构成威胁的人创造了前提条件。 殖民势力否认了反对他们的本地战士作为战争对手的地位。由于对殖民地的任何抵抗均被定义并处理为叛乱，因此殖民地大国也拒绝承认旨在保护非战斗人员和赋予战俘某些权利的国际战争法原则。 但是，如果武装斗争被定义为叛乱，根据殖民地大国宪法，国家权力就有权利以必要的所有手段镇压它。对印度反殖民地权势的起义被官方话语简化为本地士兵的“哗变”，即被普遍认为特别可耻的行为，进一步为对叛乱的广泛使用暴力提供了合法性。这种合法性的需求虽然几乎从未被殖民地居民认可，但被认为对于国际政治舆论是必要的。美国在1899年接替西班牙成为菲律宾的殖民地统治者时，此情形变得明显。当时，原先反抗西班牙殖民统治的当地人继续他们的独立斗争。只有在菲律宾移交给美国的条约被批准之后，战斗中的当地人才被视为叛乱者。因此，条约的批准被加速进行。紧接着，美国总统下令在菲律宾建立军事政府。将争取独立的当地人称为“黑鬼”，将他们视为需要被镇压的对象，显示了美国军官和士兵将本土经验和判断转移到了这些地区。 尽管不是所有殖民地大国的宪法都规定了在国家权力受到威胁时可以暂停民事保护权利并将权力转交给军队，但所有殖民地大国都授权军队在紧急情况下采取未明确授权的措施。在被政府事后批准使用暴力对“叛乱者”采取行动时，尽管政治公众可能提出批评，德国和法国的将军和总督都能相信这一点，而英国偶尔会进行法庭调查。尽管根据（未成文的）英国宪法，军事和政治决策者不仅有权，甚至有义务镇压对国家权力的叛乱，但不存在以战争法（martial law）名义取消民事国家权力的情况。Albert Venn Dicey在其1885年首次发表的《宪法法律研究导论》中指出，不仅是决策者，甚至普通公民都有义务使用他们可利用的手段对抗叛乱（1885/1965: 289）。但是，对采取暴力行动的权利既受紧急情况的范围限制也受限制。根据英国法律，并非直接参与者有权决定特定情况下存在多大程度的威胁，而是由法院在叛乱被镇压后“在安静和安全中”决定。（1885/1965: 291）但显然，并非所有决策者都认同Lord Broughan在1823年的观点，他宣称如果整个英格兰的所有法律和宪法即使只是暂时被战争法取代超过绝对必要的时间，那将是极端的灾难。（引自Hussain 2003: 109）由于确定国家紧急状态的标准不明确，因此采取对应措施的宪法授权取决于特定历史情境中如何确定“紧急状态”的程度，无论是参与者本身还是后来成立的评估所采取措施的委员会成员，最终由审判决策者行为的法院来决定。鉴于从英国和其他欧洲殖民地大国的殖民地报告中传出的对本地抵抗者的残酷行为，可能会怀疑对殖民地中的民事和军事领导层的决策权受到事后法庭审查的限制是否停留在理论上。然而，在英国殖民统治的历史上，这并非总是如此。以下两个例子将对此进行更详细的说明。"},{"instruction":"请将“Das erste bezieht sich auf eine Revolte, die 1865 im Zusammenhang von Auseinandersetzungen über Pachten in Jamaika entstanden war. Nachdem es zu Mord und Totschlag gekommen war, berief der Gouverneur - wie gesetzlich vorgeschrieben - einen Kriegsrat ein. Dieser erklärte das Kriegsrecht für Jamaika mit Ausnahme von Kingston für eine Dauer von dreißig Tagen. Der späteren Untersuchung zufolge wurden in dieser Zeit 439 Menschen exekutiert, 600 Männer und Frauen öffentlich ausgepeitscht und 1.000 Hütten niedergebrannt. Mit diesen - summarisch verhängten - Strafmaßnahmen befasste sich die königliche Untersuchungskommission nur oberflächlich, weil sie sich auf die Frage konzentrierte, ob die Hinrichtung von George William Gordon, einem prominenten schwarzen Landeigentümer, Mitglied der Legislative und der Kirche der Baptisten, rechtmäßig gewesen sei. Zusammen mit anderen hatte er in den Jahren zuvor eine Landreform gefordert. Deren Notwendigkeit war dem Kolonialministerium auch durch Edward Underhill, einem führenden Mitglied der Englischen Baptisten Mission in Jamaika mit dem Hinweis nahegelegt worden, dass andernfalls Rebellion drohe. Maßnahmen des colonial office unterblieben, und in Jamaika konnte der amtierende Gouverneur Eyre weiterhin ungehindert behaupten, die wichtigste Ursache der Armut von S chwarzen sei deren dickköpfige Verweigerung von Arbeit. (Kostal 2005: 7-8). Obwohl Gordon gar nicht unmittelbar an der Revolte beteiligt gewesen war, wurde ihm von einem Militärgericht vorgeworfen, er habe diese angeführt. Selbst unter Bedingungen des Kriegsrechts hätte Gordon aber noch nicht einmal vor dieses Gericht gestellt werden dürfen, weil er sich in Kingston und damit außerhalb des Geltungsbereichs des Kriegsrechts aufgehalten hatte. Der Gouverneur aber hatte ihn gewaltsam in diesen Geltungsbereich bringen lassen. Er wurde hingerichtet. Für die Mitglieder der noch im selben Jahr eingesetzten Untersuchungskommission ging es John Stuart Mill zufolge - er war selbst Mitglied der Untersuchungskommission - schlicht darum, festzustellen, ob es in England möglich war, einen Staatsbeamten dafür verantwortlich zu machen, dass unberechtigt Blut vergossen wurde, und ob es sich dabei um Mord handelte o der nicht. (zit. bei Hussain 2003: 110) Gegner diese Position waren der Auffassung, die Herrschaft über fremde Bevölkerungen mache Ausnahmen von der rule of law erforderlich. (Kostal 2005: 20f.) Öffentlich waren beide Positionen gegenwärtig und beide wurden heftig verteidigt. Während es im Athenaeum hieß, der ehrliche Name Englands habe durch das Massaker in Jamaika einen Makel erfahren, der selbst in zwanzig Generationen nicht zu beseitigen sei, wurde in der Pall Mall Gazette im Dezember 1865 ausgeführt, „Wir sind wenige und sie sind viele, deshalb müssen wir Untreue mit Terror begegnen ... das Ausmaß des Terrors ... ist dabei schlicht durch das numerische Verhältnis zwischen ihnen und uns bestimmt ...“ (zit. Kostal 2005: 469, Übers.) Und der Morning Herald kommentierte den Schlussbericht der Untersuchungskommission mit der Feststellung: Revolutionen „werden nicht mit Rosenwasser gemacht und Rebellionen nicht mit Handschuhen unterdrückt. Wenn sich eine Handvoll Weißer plötzlich durch eine Vielzahl von Schwarzen bedroht sieht ... ist es fast eine moralische Notwendigkeit, dass Maßnahmen ergriffen werden, die ruhige und kühle Betrachtung verurteilen würde.“ (Kostal 2005: 469, Übers.) Im Januar 1866 wurde Edward John Eyre seines Amtes als Gouverneur enthoben und nach London beordert, um vor dem Untersuchungsausschuss auszusagen. Auch Brigade General Abercombie Nelson und Leutnant Herbert Brand wurden vor den Ausschuss zitiert. Letzterer hatte dem Militärtribunal vorgestanden, welches Gordon verurteilt hatte. Der Untersuchungsausschuss, das Jamaika Committee, erhob Anklage gegen Eyre sowie gegen Nelson und Brand.10 Keiner der Angeklagten wurde verurteilt.11 In unserem Zusammengang können weder die Gerichtsverfahren noch die in diesem Zusammenhang vorgebrachten - öffentlich heftig debattierten - Argumente im Einzelnen ausgeführt werden. Unerlässlich ist aber der Hinweis, dass die Jamaika-Affäre einen Wendepunkt in der Geschichte des englischen Rechts darstellt. Denn während es bislang als weitgehend ausgemacht galt, dass den Prinzipien des englischen Rechts für das ganze Kolonialreich Geltung zukam, war nach den mit dieser Affäre verbundenen Debatten vor Gericht und in der Öffentlichkeit deutlich, dass es im Hinblick auf das Kriegsrecht ein Recht für England und ein anderes für die Kolonien gab. Die Tatsache, dass in den Kolonien über eine potentiell immer rebellierende Bevölkerung geherrscht wurde, erweiterte die Reichweite des Notrechtes und damit den Entscheidungsradius des vor Ort entscheidenden britischen Personals. (So auch Kostal 2005: passim) Man könnte sich fragen, warum eine derartige Debatte nicht bereits wenige Jahre zuvor aus Anlass der grausamen Niederschlagung des Aufstandes in Indien aufgekommen war. Denn auch für Indien war im Zuge des Aufstandes ein Gesetz erlassen worden, welches die kommandierenden Offiziere von Divisionen, Brigaden und Standorten ermächtigte, Mitglieder der einheimischen Armee ohne Rücksprache mit dem Hauptquartier vor Kriegsgerichte zu stellen und hinrichten zu lassen. „In der Notlage, die damals entstanden war, konnte Zentralisierung nicht beibehalten werden.“ (Kaye & Malleson 1897-98/1971: 417f.; Übers.) Die Antwort liegt auf der Hand: In Indien waren sehr viele Weiße, darunter Frauen und Kinder umgekommen. Damit galten Strafmaßnahmen, auch wenn sie nicht nur drakonisch, sondern mit zusätzlicher Erniedrigung verbunden waren, im Metropolland prinzipiell für berechtigt. Weil in Jamaika keine weißen Opfer zu beklagen waren, war es politisch möglich, über die Ursachen der Rebellion und über die Legalität der Strafmaßnahmen zu diskutieren. Lord Chief Justice Alexander Cockburn sah sich zu der Feststellung veranlasst, ihm schaudere vor dem Gedanken, wozu die menschliche Natur fähig sei, wenn Rache in der Form des Kriegsrechts in Gang gesetzt werde, aber auch Cockburn gestand zu, dass das Kriegsrecht in den Kolonien nützlich sei, um der Bevölkerung Furcht einzuflößen. (zit. Kostal 2005: 483) Es wäre abwegig, anzunehmen, der britische General, der für das Massaker in Amritsar am 13. April 1919 verantwortlich war, habe diese Äußerung von Cockburn gekannt. Denn was Cockburn zum Ausdruck brachte, war nicht mehr und nicht weniger als der common sense der Kolonialherrschaft. Weil dieser aber - zumindest in Indien im Jahre 1919 - auch Strategien umfasste, die eine längerfristige politische Stabilität möglich machen sollten, war die militärische Umsetzung dieses common sense nicht unumstritten. Auf Befehl von General Dyer schossen die Soldaten in Amritsar auf Menschen, die sich versammelt hatten, um eine Totenfeier für die zuvor vom Militär erschossenen Streikenden zu begehen. Alle Munition, 1.650 Schuss, wurde aufgebraucht. Die Zahl der Getöteten, darunter auch Frauen und Kinder, wird unterschiedlich angegeben. Offiziellen Angaben zufolge gab es 379 Tote und 1.100 Verwundete, der Indische Nationalkongress sprach von mindestens 1.000 Toten. In seinem offiziellen Bericht über den Vorfall rechtfertigte Dyer seine Maßnahme mit dem Hinweis, es sei nicht nur darum gegangen, die Menge zu zerstreuen, vielmehr sei es unter militärischen Gesichtspunkten erforderlich gewesen, eine „ausreichende moralische Wirkung“ (a sufficient moral effect) auf den gesamten Punjab zu erzielen. Hätte er mehr Truppen zur Verfügung gehabt, so hätte er auch diese eingesetzt. Von einer unangebrachten Härte könne nicht die Rede sein. (R.E.H. Dyer 1920: 10; zit. nach Hussain 2003: 100) Dyer wurde entlassen, und die mit der Untersuchung des Massakers beauftragte Kommission kam zu dem Ergebnis, die Anwendung des Kriegsrechts sei unzulässig gewesen. Große Teile der britischen Öffentlichkeit waren anderer Ansicht, und auch diejenigen, die Dyers Befehle für unzulässig oder mit Churchill als „monströs“ erachteten, bestritten keineswegs durchgängig das Recht, im Falle eines Notstandes (emergency) zum Mittel des Kriegsrechtes zu greifen. Überwiegend waren sie jedoch der Ansicht, dass es sich am 13. April 1919 in Amritsar nicht um einen Notstand gehandelt hatte, nicht um einen Aufstand, sondern bestenfalls um einen Aufruhr, eine Gefährdung der öffentlichen Ord-nung, der mit polizeilichen Methoden hätte begegnet werden müssen. Damit war eine politische Strategie skizziert. An der grundlegenden Struktur der Kolonialherrschaft in Indien änderte dies nichts: Auch wenn ein bestimmtes Maß an Legalität eingeführt worden war, so handelte es sich doch nach wie vor um eine Fremdherrschaft, die nicht nur mittels Waffengewalt etabliert worden war, sondern auch mittels Waffengewalt aufrecht erhalten wurde. ”翻译为中文","output":"第一个例子涉及到1865年在牙买加发生的与租赁争论有关的叛乱。在发生了谋杀和杀人事件后，州长按照法律要求召集了战争委员会。该委员会宣布除了金斯顿以外的牙买加全境进入为期三十天的战争状态。根据后来的调查，这段时间中有439人被处决，600名男性和女性被公开鞭打，1000间棚屋被焚毁。王家调查委员会对这些草率处罚的措施只进行了肤浅的审查，因为它们集中于讨论乔治·威廉·戈登，一位知名的黑人地主、立法会成员和浸信会教徒的处决是否合法。与其他人一样，他前几年一直要求土地改革。他指出，如果不实施改革，就可能会引发叛乱，这一点也向殖民部提出了警告。但殖民办公室没有采取措施，因而在牙买加，现任州长埃尔继续毫无阻碍地声称黑人的贫困的主要原因是他们固执地拒绝工作。（Kostal 2005: 7-8）。尽管戈登并未直接参与叛乱，一个军事法庭指控他领导了叛乱。即使在战争法状态下，戈登也不应该受到这个法庭的审判，因为他当时身在金斯顿，处于战争法的实施范围之外。然而，州长强行将他带入该范围内。他被处决了。 对尚在同一年成立的调查委员会成员来说，约翰·斯图尔特·密尔表示——他本人就是调查委员会的成员——简单来说，问题在于是否有可能在英格兰让一个官员为无端流血负责，以及这是否构成谋杀。（引自 Hussain 2003: 110）反对这种立场的人认为，对外国人口的统治需要法治（rule of law）的例外。（Kostal 2005: 20f.）这两种立场都在公众场合存在，且受到了激烈的辩护。《Athenaeum》杂志称，牙买加的屠杀给英格兰的诚实名声带来了污点，即使在二十代以后也无法消除，而《Pall Mall Gazette》在1865年12月指出，“我们很少他们很多，因此我们必须用恐怖对抗背叛……恐怖的规模由他们和我们之间的数量关系决定……”（引自 Kostal 2005: 469, 翻译）《Morning Herald》就调查委员会的最终报告评论道：“革命不是用玫瑰水制成的，叛乱不是用手套镇压的。当一小撮白人突然发现自己被大量黑人威胁时……几乎是一种道德必然性，必须采取措施，这些措施在平静和冷静的考虑下会遭到谴责。”（Kostal 2005: 469, 翻译） 1866年1月，爱德华·约翰·埃尔被免去了牙买加州长的职务，并被命令前往伦敦出席调查委员会作证。旅团将军艾伯克龙比·纳尔逊和中尉赫伯特·勃兰德也被传唤到委员会。后者曾主持对戈登的军事审判。该调查委员会，牙买加委员会，对爱尔、纳尔逊和勃兰德提出了指控。没有任何被告被定罪。 在我们的讨论中，既不能详细讨论法庭程序，也不能详述其中提出的——并在公众场合激烈辩论的——论点。但必须指出的是，牙买加事件在英国法律历史上标志着一个转折点。因为之前普遍认为英国法律的原则适用于整个殖民帝国，而这起事件引发的法庭和公众辩论后明显显示，在战争法方面，英国和殖民地有不同的法律。殖民地统治了潜在总是处于叛乱状态的人口，扩大了紧急法的范围，从而增加了当地英国人员的决策范围。（参见 Kostal 2005: passim） 人们可能会问，为什么几年前在残酷镇压印度起义时没有引发类似的辩论。因为在起义中，通过了一项法律，授权各师、旅和地区指挥官在不与总部协商的情况下将本地军队成员送上军事法庭并处决。“在当时出现的困境中，不能保持中心集权。”（Kaye & Malleson 1897-98/1971: 417f.; 翻译）答案显而易见：在印度，很多白人，包括妇女和儿童被杀害。因此，在大都会国，即便是严苛且带有额外羞辱的惩罚措施原则上被认为是合理的。因为在牙买加没有白人受害，政治上有可能讨论叛乱的原因和惩罚措施的合法性。Lord Chief Justice Alexander Cockburn被迫指出，当复仇以战争法的形式启动时，他对人性能够做出什么感到震惊，但即使Cockburn也承认战争法在殖民地对吓阻人民是有用的。（引自 Kostal 2005: 483） 不要以为1919年4月13日负责阿姆利则大屠杀的英国将军了解Cockburn的这番言论。因为Cockburn表达的不过是殖民统治的普遍认识，这种认识至少在1919年的印度也包括了可能实现长期政治稳定的策略，因此实施这种普遍认识的军事策略并非没有争议。根据戴尔将军的命令，士兵在阿姆利则向聚集的人群开火，那些人是为了为之前被军队击毙的罢工者进行悼念。所有的弹药，1650发子弹，都被用完了。死亡人数的统计不同，官方数据称有379人死亡和1100人受伤，而印度国民大会党称至少有1000人死亡。在他对事件的官方报告中，戴尔为他的行动辩护说，不仅仅是为了驱散人群，更是从军事角度来看，需要在整个旁遮普产生“足够的道德效果”。如果他有更多的军队，他也会使用。不能说他使用了不恰当的严厉手段。（R.E.H. Dyer 1920: 10; 引自 Hussain 2003: 100） 戴尔被解雇，负责调查大屠杀的委员会得出结论，使用战争法是不恰当的。然而，英国公众的很大一部分持有不同看法，即使那些认为戴尔的命令是非法的或与丘吉尔一样视为“怪诞”的人，也并非普遍反对在紧急情况下（emergency）使用战争法的权利。大部分人认为，1919年4月13日在阿姆利则并非紧急状态，不是叛乱，最多是骚乱，是公共秩序受到威胁的情况，应该用警察手段应对。这勾勒出了一个政治策略。 这并没有改变印度殖民统治的基本结构：即使引入了一定程度的合法性，它仍然是一种不仅通过武力建立而且还通过武力维持的外来统治。"},{"instruction":"请将“Mit dem Hinweis auf eine Gefährdung der öffentlichen Ordnung wurde auch in den Metropolländern im Verlauf des 18. und des 19. Jahrhunderts immer wieder Waffengewalt im Inneren eingesetzt. Dennoch markiert die Entwicklung eines geteilten Notstandsrechts einen der Unterschiede zwischen der Staatsgewalt in Kolonien und Staatsgewalt in parlamentarisch verfassten Metropolstaaten. Der Unterschied besteht in der politisch jeweils akzeptierten Definition von Notstand.12 Denn diese Definition steht nicht ein- für allemal fest. Sie wurde nicht nur in den verschiedenen Rechtskreisen, sondern auch im Verlauf historischer Entwicklungen unterschiedlich beantwortet. Während für die meisten europäischen Kolonialmächte die Berechtigung zu einem gesonderten kolonialen Notstandsrecht nicht in Frage stand, hatte die offizielle britische Kolonialpolitik - aller faktischen Ungleichheit zum Trotz - lange daran festgehalten, dass die Prinzipien des britischen Rechts im gesamten Imperium galten. Mit dem - auch offiziell - geteilten Notstandsrecht wurde dieser Anspruch aufgegeben. Und damit sind wir bei den Unterschieden zwischen der sich herausbildenden modernen Staatsgewalt in europäischen Gesellschaften des Ancien Regime auf der einen und den Grundstrukturen kolonialer Staatsgewalt auf der anderen Seite. Die Besonderheit kolonialherrschaftlicher Ausbeutung Kolonialstaaten förderten und sicherten die Aneignung von Land durch Kolonisten,13 sie sicherten Vorteile von Handelsgesellschaften, und sie sicherten - dies zunehmend - die Herrschaft von Kapitaleignern über Arbeitskräfte. Nur selten handelte es sich dabei um längerfristig gleichbleibende oder gar einheitliche Strategien. Siedler hatten andere Interessen als Minenbesitzer, arme Weiße andere als Plantagenbesitzer, Offiziere hatten oft sehr eigene Interessen, und manchmal gab es auch Beauftragte von Kolonialstaaten, die sich darum mühten, die Lebensbedingungen von Einheimischen zu verbessern. Hier stehen weder deren Motivationen zur Debatte, noch die Hindernisse, die ihnen begegneten. Ihre Bemühungen sind aber eines der Elemente konkreter Staatstätigkeit in europäischen Kolonien, die darauf hinweisen, dass Kolonialstaaten nicht als die Organisation eines einheitlichen und widerspruchsfreien Interesses der Fremden verstanden werden dürfen. Dennoch: in allen Kolonien wurde Staatsgewalt eingesetzt, um aus Einheimischen Untertanen zu machen, deren Arbeitskraft ausgebeutet werden konnte. (dazu auch: Koponen 1994: 669) Derartige Strategien gab es auch in europäischen Gesellschaften des Ancien Regime, und wer sich auf die Suche macht, kann auch in europäischen Archiven auf Belege für Arbeitsverhältnisse stoßen, die sich von entsprechenden Praktiken in Kolonien nicht prinzipiell unterschieden. Auch die Strategie der Arbeitsverpflichtung durch das Verbot des Vagabundierens (der Landstreicherei) musste in Kolonien nicht neu erfunden werden. Und dennoch sind solche Arbeitsverhältnisse und Politiken in Kolonien nicht nur sehr viel länger praktiziert worden als in kapitalistischen Metropolstaaten, sie kamen auch mit einem größeren Ausmaß an direktem, auf Personen gerichteten Zwang und mit einem größeren Ausmaß an direkter, auf die Körper und das Leben von Einheimischen gerichteten Gewalt daher. Während Aktionen organisierter Arbeitskräfte und Kämpfe zugunsten einer Ausweitung des Wahlrechts Regierungen in den kapitalistischen Metropolstaaten schließlich veranlassten, den Einsatz von direkter Gewalt gegen Arbeitskräfte unter Strafe zu stellen, ist dies in Kolonien nicht nur nicht erreicht, sondern vielfach gar nicht oder erst in den allerletzten Phasen der Kolonialherrschaft angestrebt worden. Stattdessen blieben Arbeitsverhältnisse in Kolonien bis zum Ende der Kolonialzeit in staatliche Gewaltherrschaft integriert. Das geschah entweder dadurch, dass Unternehmer zusätzlich zu der aus Kapitaleigentum resultierenden Berechtigung, über den Einsatz von Arbeitskraft zu bestimmen, mit der strafrechtlichen Kompetenz ausgestattet waren, jede Abweichung von den privat deklarierten Arbeitspflichten zu bestrafen, sei es mittels körperlicher Züchtigung, sei es mittels Haft in einem privaten Gefängnis. In manchen Kolonien bzw. in einzelnen Produktionsbereichen einer Kolonie wurde Kapitaleignern solche Strafgewalt formell übertragen, in anderen haben sie sich diese außerlegal angeeignet. Die zweite Art der Integration privatwirtschaftlicher Arbeitsverhältnisse in staatliche Gewaltkompetenz geschah über die von Staaten praktizierte Sanktion tatsächlicher oder angeblicher Verletzung von Arbeitspflichten. In diesem Falle waren staatliche Behörden quasi Auftragsgehilfen der einzelnen Kapitaleigner. Weil Arbeitskräften faktisch kaum je Möglichkeiten zur Verfügung standen, staatliche Gerichtsbarkeit in Anspruch zu nehmen, um sich gegen private Gewaltpraxis zur Wehr zu setzen, musste ihnen der Kolonialstaat in aller Regel als Gewaltapparat sans phrase erscheinen. In den meisten europäischen Kolonien stand einer staatlichen Kontrolle des Gewaltregimes in Arbeitsverhältnissen zusätzlich die Tatsache entgegen, dass es der Staat selbst war, der Zwangsarbeit in großem Umfang nutzte. Und wenn die Grundstruktur kolonialer Staatsgewalt anders noch nicht deutlich geworden wäre, so trat sie in der Verquickung von Infrastrukturmaßnahmen und Zwangsarbeit unabweislich zutage. Auch wenn der Bau von Eisenbahnen, Straßen, Brücken oder Häfen zunächst ausschließlich dazu diente, europäischen Unternehmen den Export ihrer Produkte zu erleichtern und diesen zu verbilligen, (Prakash 1990: 218) so galt die Entwicklung von Infrastruktur doch den damit betrauten Konzessionsgesellschaften, den Kolonialstaaten sowie Regierungen in den Metropolländern als eine zentrale Maßnahme zur Entwicklung der kolonialen Wirtschaft - als eine Maßnahme zur Förderung des Allgemeinwohls in den Kolonien. Von der Kolonialregierung in Indien heißt es bei Neil Charlesworth, um die Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts habe sie begonnen, ihre Verantwortung für öffentliche Einrichtungen zu akzeptieren. Die 1854 eingerichtete Abteilung für Public Works sei mit der Kontrolle über den Bau von Straßen, Brücken und Bewässerungssystemen beauftragt worden und habe auch direkt die Entwicklung eines Telegraphensystems, der Eisenbahnen, Hafenanlagen und Werften unternommen. (1982: 59f.) Anders als in vielen anderen Kolonien agierte der Kolonialstaat in Indien in einem erheblichen Ausmaß selbst als Unternehmer. Das verhinderte jedoch nicht, dass die für eine industrielle Entwicklung erforderlichen technischen Artefakte, seien es Maschinen oder Lokomotiven, weiterhin importiert wurden. Das bremste die Entwicklung der Industrieproduktion in Indien. Ob der Kolonialstaat in Indien tatsächlich bereits Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts eine bewusste Entwicklungsstrategie verfolgte, sei dahin gestellt. In anderen Kolonien ließen entsprechende Erklärungen und Politiken jedenfalls länger auf sich warten.14 Eine Diskussion der Einzelheiten und Wirkungen derartiger „Entwicklungspolitik“ würde den thematischen Rahmen dieser Untersuchung sprengen. Für unseren Zusammenhang ist aber relevant, dass es vielfach die Infrastrukturmaßnahmen waren, zu deren Errichtung Kolonialstaaten in großem Umfang Zwangsarbeitskräfte einsetzten. (für Afrika: Cooper 1996: 38; für die franz. Kolonien: Le Cour Grandmaison 2009: 92)15 Diese Praxis war einerseits das Resultat der Knappheit öffentlicher Kassen, andererseits der Zurichtung von Einheimischen zu Eingeborenen. Alle Metropolstaaten verfolgten die Politik einer Selbstfinanzierung der Herrschaftsapparate in den Kolonien, folglich der Abpressung möglichst hoher Steuern und der Rekrutierung möglichst kostengünstiger Arbeitskräfte. Dafür leistete die staatliche sowie alltagspraktische Definition des Menschentypus „Eingeborener“ gute Dienste. Weil Eingeborene als von Natur aus faul, arbeitsunwillig und begriffsstutzig galten, erfolgte ihre Zurichtung zu willigen Arbeitskräften zu ihrem eigenen Besten: mittels verpflichtender Arbeit („travail obligator“). Von einem Gouverneur Madagaskars zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts ist der Ausspruch überliefert: „die Freiheit der Arbeit wird erst dann in den Gesetzen eines Landes geregelt, wenn die Verpflichtung zur Arbeit in seinen Sitten verankert ist.“16”翻译为中文","output":"在18和19世纪的过程中，都市国家不断以公共秩序受到威胁为由，在国内使用武力。然而，分离的紧急法权的发展标志着殖民地的国家权力与议会制都市国家国家权力之间的差异。差异在于对紧急状态的政治接受定义上。 因为这个定义并不是一成不变的。它不仅在不同的法律体系中有所不同，而且在历史发展过程中也有所不同。 对大多数欧洲殖民强国来说，拥有一个独立的殖民紧急法权是无可争议的，而官方的英国殖民政策尽管事实上存在不平等——长期坚持认为英国法律的原则在整个帝国都适用。带有官方分离紧急法权的发展放弃了这一主张。这就带来了现代国家权力在欧洲旧体制社会的形成与殖民地国家权力的基本结构之间的差异。 殖民统治的剥削特点 殖民地国家促进并保障了殖民者对土地的占有，保障了贸易公司的利益，日益增加地保障了资本所有者对劳动力的统治。这些很少是长期稳定或统一的策略。定居者与矿山业主有不同的利益，穷白人与种植园主有不同的利益，军官往往有着非常个人的利益，有时还有殖民地国家代表努力改善本地居民的生活条件。这里既不讨论他们的动机，也不讨论他们遇到的障碍。但他们的努力是欧洲殖民地具体国家活动的一个要素，表明殖民地国家不能被理解为外来势力的统一且无矛盾利益的组织。然而，在所有殖民地，国家权力被用来将本地居民转变为其劳动力可以被剥削的臣民。（参见：Koponen 1994: 669）这种策略也存在于欧洲旧体制社会中，谁若搜索，也能在欧洲档案中找到与殖民地相似做法的证据。通过禁止流浪（即游手好闲）强迫劳动在殖民地并不需要重新发明。然而，这些劳动关系和政策在殖民地的实践时间比在资本主义都市国家长得多，它们涉及更直接的、针对个人的强制以及对本地居民的身体和生命的直接暴力。随着有组织的劳动力行动和扩大选举权的斗争最终促使资本主义都市国家政府将对劳动者的直接暴力行为定为非法，这在殖民地不仅未实现，而且在很多时候甚至未被追求，或仅在殖民统治的最后阶段被追求。 相反，直到殖民时代结束，殖民地的劳动关系一直嵌入国家的暴力统治中。这要么是通过赋予企业家除了资本所有权导致的劳动力使用权外，还拥有通过体罚或是私人监狱等手段惩罚任何偏离私人定义的劳动义务的刑事权限。在一些殖民地或是殖民地的特定生产部门中，这种惩罚权被正式转移给了资本所有者，而在其他地方，他们非法地占有了这种权力。第二种将私营劳动关系融入国家暴力权限的方式是通过国家对实际或所谓的违反劳动义务的行为的制裁。在这种情况下，国家机关几乎就是各个资本所有者的佣人。由于劳动人员实际上很少有机会利用国家司法系统来抵抗私人暴力，殖民地国家在大多数情况下必然呈现为一个不加掩饰的暴力机构。 在大多数欧洲殖民地，对劳动关系中暴力体制的国家控制还受到国家自身广泛使用强制劳动的事实的限制。如果殖民地国家权力的基本结构还不够明显的话，那么通过基础设施建设和强制劳动的结合会变得不容忽视。即使铁路、道路、桥梁或港口的建设最初仅为了方便和降低欧洲公司出口其产品的成本，（Prakash 1990: 218）负责这些基础设施的特许公司、殖民地国家以及都市国家政府还是将其视为殖民地经济发展的核心措施——作为推动殖民地公共利益的措施。尼尔·查尔斯沃思指出，大约在19世纪中叶，英国在印度的殖民政府开始承认其对公共设施的责任。1854年成立的公共工程部门负责控制道路、桥梁和灌溉系统的建设，并直接负责开发电报系统、铁路、港口和船坞的发展。（1982: 59f.）与许多其他殖民地不同，殖民地国家在印度在很大程度上自行充当企业家。这并没有阻止技术制品，如机器或火车头的进口继续进行。这阻碍了印度工业生产的发展。 无论印度的殖民地国家是否真的在19世纪中叶就采取了有意识的发展战略，其他殖民地的相关声明和政策无疑要晚得多。对这种“发展政策”的细节和影响的讨论将超出本研究的主题范围。但在我们的讨论中，重要的是，殖民地国家通过大规模使用强迫劳动力实施的基础设施措施。（对非洲的影响：Cooper 1996: 38；对法国殖民地的影响：Le Cour Grandmaison 2009: 92）这一做法一方面是公共财政紧张的结果，另一方面是将本地人塑造为土著的结果。所有都市国家都追求在殖民地实现统治机构的自我融资政策，因此尽量榨取高额税收并招募成本最低的劳动力。\\"土著\\"这一人类类型的国家及日常实践定义在此提供了良好的服务。因为土著被认为天生懒惰、不愿工作且反应迟钝，将他们训练成愿意的劳动者是为了他们自己的利益：通过强制性工作（“travail obligator”）。20世纪初马达加斯加的一位总督曾说：“劳动自由在一个国家的法律中得到规定时，是因为工作的责任已经植入其习俗中。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Zwangsarbeit für den Staat ließ sich eher durchsetzen, wo die zunehmende Entwicklung von Polizeikräften eine Effektivierung der tatsächlichen Herrschaft über die kolonisierte Bevölkerung ermöglicht hatte, eine Entwicklung, die genau durch jene Infrastrukturmaßnahmen ermöglicht wurde, zu deren Errichtung vielerorts erzwungene Arbeit genutzt wurde. Sie erleichterten den Transport von Polizeieinheiten und Militär. Bis zum Ende der Kolonialherrschaft sanktionierte Staatsgewalt die Arbeits-bedingungen, denen Einheimische unterworfen wurden. Man könnte vermuten, die Kampagnen gegen Sklaverei hätten die internationale Öffentlichkeit dafür sensibilisiert, auch andere Gewaltpraxis in Arbeitsverhältnissen zur Kenntnis zu nehmen. Das war aber nicht der Fall. Tatsächlich legitimierte die Abolitionistenbewegung durch ihren Fokus auf die rechtliche Form der Sklaverei indirekt alle Arbeitsverhältnisse, die auf formellen oder unterstellten Verträgen basierten. Abolitionisten, so Frederick Cooper, verliehen Lohnarbeit „eine Aura der Normalität“. (2000: 108) Erst als Lohnarbeit, in welcher konkreten Form auch immer, international als historischer Fortschritt und als die für kapitalistische Wirtschaften „normale“ Form der Produktionsverhältnisse durchgesetzt war, hatte Kritik an der konkreten Ausgestaltung von Vertragsbedingungen und Arbeitsbeziehungen in Kolonien eine reelle Chance. Sie traf vor allem die kleineren Kolonialmächte wie Belgien und Deutschland.. Die Arbeitsverhältnisse in englischen und französischen Kolonien blieben dagegen noch sehr viel länger von internationaler Kritik verschont. Zunächst entwickelte sich Kritik an Formen der „Ersatzsklaverei“ vorwiegend in den Herkunftsländern der zeitgenössisch als Kulis bezeichneten Arbeitsmigrantinnen und Arbeitsmigranten. Immer öfter verlangten nun Entsenderstaaten, dass Verträge kontrolliert und Arbeitsverhältnisse inspiziert wurden. Weil der internationale Arbeitsmarkt aber auch Krisen in Herkunftsländern abfedern half, wurde im Falle einer Hungersnot auf derartige Forderungen regelmäßig verzichtet - so etwa während und direkt nach der Hungersnot, der in China Ende der 1870er Jahre mindestens 10 Millionen Menschen zum Opfer fielen. Um weiterhin Kulis importieren zu können, wurden auch in den meisten Empfängerländern einzelne Beamte beauftragt, die Arbeitsverhältnisse der ausländischen Arbeitskräfte zu kontrollieren und Verbesserungen vorzuschlagen. Dass die Wirkung derartiger Maßnahmen begrenzt blieb, geht schon aus der Tatsache hervor, dass schließlich ein Entsenderland nach dem anderen den Handel mit Kuliverträgen untersagte. Das hat ihn nicht beendet, aber die Verhandlungsposition von Arbeitsmigrantinnen und Arbeitsmigranten verbessert. Der große Unterschied In europäischen Kolonien kam es nicht zur Trennung von Politik und Ökonomie. Solange Arbeitsverhältnisse unmittelbar kolonialer Herrschaft integriert blieben, blieb auch der sich dort entwickelnde Kapitalismus insgesamt kolonialer Staatsgewalt integriert. Die bis heute fortdauernde Orientierung vieler postkolonialer Länder auf eine - womöglich sogar weitgehend monokulturelle - Exportwirtschaft geht auf diese Strukturen zurück. In europäischen Kolonien kam es aber auch nicht zu einer Trennung von Politik und Gesellschaft, weil sich Gesellschaft, verstanden als eine Sphäre, in der sich autonome Individuen in öffentlichen (oder notfalls auch geheimen) Debatten ihrer gemeinsamen Interessen bewusst werden, kaum entwickeln konnte. Es ist dies einer der Gründe, warum Einheimischen, die Veränderungen anstrebten, oft keine andere Verhaltensweise zu Gebote stand, als die Anwendung von Gewalt. Die Intransigenz kolonialer Staatsgewalt, die Einheimische als „Eingeborene“ und damit als die ganz Anderen definierte und behandelte, setzte Möglichkeiten einer Reform dieser Staatsgewalt sehr enge Grenzen.17 Dass es in vielen Kolonien seit den 1920er und dann vor allem in den späten 1940er Jahren dennoch zu Reformen kam, erklärt sich aus dem Interesse von Metropolstaaten an einer tatsächlichen ökonomischen Entwicklung ihrer Kolonien, einem Bestreben, das durch die weltweiten ökonomischen und politischen Krisen, aber auch durch Widerstand in Kolonien provoziert worden ist. Trotz derartiger Veränderungen blieben Kolonialstaaten Gewaltapparate zur Förderung der privaten Aneignung. Alle Versuche, ihnen eine theoretisch komplexere Natur zuzuschreiben, gehen in die Irre. 12. Über Staatsgewalt in der Sub-Sahara und das Elend der Kategorien Seit einigen Jahren werden afrikanische Gesellschaften (!) in der Sub-Sahara wahlweise als „Quasi-Staaten“ oder als „schwache“ Staaten, als „fragile“, „hybride“, „kriminalisierte“, „scheiternde“ beziehungsweise „zerfallende“ Staaten oder aber als bereits „gescheiterte“ Staaten (failed states) bezeichnet. Eine Durchsicht der Literatur legt den Verdacht nahe, dass ein internationaler Wettstreit um den passenden Terminus ausgelobt wurde, ohne dass der Bezug zu einem theoretischen Begriff„Staat“ als Teilnahmebedingung formuliert worden wäre. Versuchen wir also zunächst, den Inhalt jener Konzeptionen von Staat zu ermitteln, die als Folie fungieren, wenn Unzulänglichkeiten konstatiert werden. Politische Diagnosen Martin Meredith (1997/1998) führt das Leid der Mehrheitsbevölkerung vieler afrikanischer Staaten auf die Korruption der führenden Politiker zurück, wobei er Korruption vor allem als Missbrauch der übertragenen Macht versteht.1 Mit dieser Interpretation steht er nicht alleine. Sie findet sich auch in der 1991 veröffentlichten Streitschrift von Axelle Kabou, die sich für ihre These, „Afrika“ sei für seine Nicht-Entwicklung selbst verantwortlich, ihrerseits auf Frantz Fa- nons böse Formulierung über die „gefrässige, habsüchtige kleine Kaste“ (1961: 166f.) bezieht, die nur bestrebt sei, sich selbst die Früchte der Unabhängigkeit anzueignen. So unterschiedlich die zitierten Arbeiten auch sind, gemeinsam ist ihnen, dass „Staat“ lediglich als Politik in Erscheinung tritt. Obwohl der Terminus failed state demgegenüber nahe legt, er ziele ab auf Strukturanalyse, ist doch auch hier vielfach Politik gemeint und Politik intendiert. Mit der Berufung einer State Failure Task Force durch den damaligen US-amerikanischen Vize-Präsidenten Al Gore im Jahre 1994 sollte der Diagnose „gescheitert“ eine wissenschaftlich haltbare Basis beschafft, zugleich aber auch die Möglichkeit der Frühwarnung eröffnet werden. Die zu diesem Zweck berufenen Wissenschaftler haben sich auf eine sehr eng an Ereignissen wie Krieg, Genocid und abrupten Regimewechseln orientierte Definition von State Failure geeinigt, ansonsten aber in drei Berichten vor allem einen umfangreichen Datenfriedhof und wenig aussagefähige statistische Korrelationen vorgelegt.2 Das hat andere nicht davon abgehalten, ihrerseits möglichst aussagefähige Kriterien zu suchen, die nicht nur auf Staaten zutreffen, die allgemeiner Ansicht nach bereits gescheitert sind, sondern auch Anhaltspunkte für einen in Gang gekommen Prozess des Scheiterns liefern.3 So beschreibt etwa Robert I. Rotberg, nachdem er das State Failure Project kritisiert hat, seinerseits, welche ökonomischen und politischen Entwicklungen sowie gewaltsamen Auseinandersetzungen eine Gefahr für den Fortbestand des Staates darstellen (2003: 19-22), und die Arbeitsgruppe „Staatszerfall, Parastaatlichkeit und Bandenkriege“, die unter Federführung von Eva Kreisky tagte, hat sich ihrerseits auf einen 16 Punkte umfassenden Katalog von Kriterien geeinigt, die einen „instabilen“ Staat kennzeichnen. Sie will weiter untersuchen, ob „zwei, drei (oder sieben) Schwächen [...] die Möglichkeit des Kollapses eines bestimmten Staates“ generieren (2003-2004).”翻译为中文","output":"强制劳动服务于国家更容易实施的地方是在警察力量不断提升，从而提高了对殖民地居民实际统治效力的地区，这种发展正是通过那些在许多地方被迫劳动用于建设的基础设施措施使得可能的。它们便利了警察和军队的运输。 直至殖民统治结束，国家权力都在制裁本地居民所受到的劳动条件。人们可能会猜想，反对奴隶制的运动已使国际社会对于劳动关系中的其他暴力行径也有所察觉。但实际上并非如此。事实上，废奴主义者通过专注于奴隶制的法律形式，间接地合法了所有基于正式或假定合同的劳动关系。如弗雷德里克·库珀所指，废奴主义者为雇佣劳动“赋予了一种正常性的光环”。（2000: 108）直到雇佣劳动，无论以何种具体形式，国际上被确认为资本主义经济中“正常”的生产关系形式后，才有可能批评殖民地中合同条件和劳动关系的具体配置。这种批评首先影响较小的殖民强国，如比利时和德国。英国和法国的殖民地劳动关系则长期免受国际批评。 最初，对于“替代奴隶制”形式的批评主要出现在被称为苦力的当代劳动移民的原籍国。越来越多的输出国家要求审核合同，并检查劳动条件。因为国际劳动市场也帮助缓解了输出国家的危机，所以在出现饥荒的情况下，这类要求经常被搁置——比如在19世纪70年代末的中国发生的饥荒，至少有1000万人死亡的情况下。为了继续进口苦力，接收国大多数情况下也指派了个别官员来监督外国劳动力的工作条件，并提出改进建议。这类措施的效果有限，从最终一个又一个输出国禁止苦力合同交易这一事实中即可见一斑。这并没有结束这种交易，但改善了劳动移民的谈判地位。 巨大的不同 在欧洲殖民地，政治与经济未分离。只要劳动关系直接融入殖民统治，那么那里发展的资本主义总体上也融入殖民国家权力。许多后殖民国家至今仍以出口为导向的经济——可能还是高度单一化的出口经济——是这种结构的遗留。但在欧洲殖民地，政治与社会也未分离，因为作为一个领域，在该领域自主个体通过公开（或必要时甚至是秘密）辩论意识到自己的共同利益几乎无法发展。这是寻求变革的本地人通常没有其他行为选择，只能使用暴力的原因之一。在将本地居民界定并对待为全然“另类”的殖民国家权力的顽固性，为这种国家权力的改革设定了非常狭窄的可能性。尽管如此，自1920年代起，在许多殖民地（尤其是在1940年代后期）仍发生了改革，这是由于宗主国对其殖民地实际经济发展的兴趣，以及由于全球经济和政治危机，还有殖民地抵抗所激发的。尽管发生了这种变化，殖民地国家仍然是为私人占有而服务的暴力装置。任何试图为其赋予更复杂的理论性质的尝试都是误导。 关于撒哈拉以南非洲国家国家权力及分类的困境 近年来，撒哈拉以南非洲社会被归类为“准国家”或被视为“弱国”，被称为“脆弱”、“混合”、“犯罪化”、“失败”或“崩溃”的国家，或被视为已经“失败”的国家。检视相关文献，让人怀疑是否有一个国际竞赛在寻找最合适的术语，而没有将对“国家”理论概念的引用作为参赛条件。因此，让我们首先尝试确定那些在指出缺陷时起到背景作用的国家概念的内容。 政治诊断 马丁·梅雷迪思（Martin Meredith）（1997/1998）将许多非洲国家的多数人民的苦难归咎于领导政治家的腐败，主要将腐败理解为对授予的权力的滥用。他并不是唯一持这种解释的人。这一解释也出现在阿克塞尔·卡布（Axelle Kabou）在1991年发布的论战性著作中，她引用了弗朗茨·法农（Frantz Fanon）关于“贪婪、贪得无厌的小精英阶层”的恶毒说法，该阶层只是努力占有独立的果实。尽管引用的作品千差万别，但他们共同的特点是把“国家”只当作政治的体现。 尽管与 failed state（失败国家）一词相反，似乎旨在进行结构分析，但在这里政治往往是所指的主题，也是目标。通过1994年时任美国副总统阿尔·戈尔（Al Gore）设立的 State Failure Task Force，旨在为“失败”诊断提供科学上的可靠基础，同时也为预警打开可能性。为此目的召集的科学家围绕像战争、种族灭绝和突然政权更迭这样的事件，就 State Failure 达成了高度集中的定义，但在三份报告中主要提出了大量数据和不太有说服力的统计相关性。 这并没有阻止其他人尝试寻找尽可能有说力的标准，这些标准不仅适用于普遍认为已经失败的国家，而且还为失败进程提供了线索。例如，罗伯特·I·罗特伯格（Robert I. Rotberg）在批评了 State Failure Project 之后，自己描述了哪些经济和政治发展以及暴力冲突构成了对国家持续存在的威胁（2003: 19-22），而在伊娃·克莱斯基（Eva Kreisky）领导下的“国家衰败、准国家性和帮派战争”工作组也为定义“不稳定”国家的16个标准达成了共识。她们希望进一步研究“两个、三个（或七个）弱点是否会产生一个特定国家崩溃的可能性”（2003-2004）。"},{"instruction":"请将“Staatsanalyse als Bestimmung von Abweichungen Wer es unternehmen wollte, eine Häufigkeitstabelle der zumeist genannten Merkmale afrikanischer Staatlichkeit der Gegenwart aufzustellen, käme mit ziemlicher Sicherheit auf eine Liste, an deren erster Stelle das Kriterium „mangelnde Effizienz“ rangierte. Für das sub-saharische Afrika4 steht regelmäßig die Frage im Zentrum, ob der Staat das Monopol legitimer Gewalt nicht nur beansprucht, sondern es auch durchsetzen kann. Die Rede vom „Staatszerfall“ unterstellt, derartige Staatlichkeit habe zuvor bestanden (für viele: Zartmann 1995), diejenige von „Quasi-Staaten“, sie sei (noch) nicht vollständig erreicht worden. Die Abweichungen, die hier konstatiert werden, beziehen sich mehr oder minder explizit5 auf Max Webers bekannte Formulierungen zum modernen Staat, auf eine analytische Konzeption also, die aus der generalisierenden Betrachtung der Formation moderner Staatlichkeit in Europa gewonnen wurden. Vor allem in der Theorie der internationalen Beziehungen und in den global studies werde die Problematik mit platter Normativität abgehandelt, schreibt Jean-Frangois Bayart. Als theoretische Versatzstücke diene ein „Weberianismus aus dem Supermarkt“ (2004: 123). Ihm fehle jeglicher Bezug auf die konkrete historische Situation (ebd.). Diese Kritik ist zutreffend, aber nicht ausreichend. Denn Max Weber hat seine Analyse des modernen Staates nicht nur ausdrücklich auf spezifische Entwicklungen im „Okzident“ bezogen, sondern alle seine theoretischen Begriffe als „Idealtypen“ entwickelt. Darunter verstand er, „theoretische Konstruktionen unter illustrativer Benutzung des Empirischen“ ([1922] 1982: 205). In der Dis- kount-Version von Max Weber werden nicht nur dessen spezifische theoretische Strategien unterschlagen,6 es wird auch angenommen, auf diese Weise werde die Realität „starker“, nicht-hybrider Staaten so zuverlässig dargestellt, dass sie „schwachen“, „hybriden“ Staaten als Norm vorgehalten werden könne. Auf die Spitze getrieben wird die normative Ausrichtung, wenn ein Mangel an good governance konstatiert und dabei unausgesprochen unterstellt wird, dass diese in den Staaten, die in Geber- und Kreditinstitutionen das Sagen haben, durchweg vorzufinden sei. Weil Afrika nur im Hinblick auf seine Abweichungen wahrgenommen wird, dominiert eine Ausrichtung wissenschaftlicher und politischer Diskurse auf die Möglichkeiten einer Sozialtechnologie, die dazu dienen soll, die afrikanische Realität vorgeblich universalen Normen anzupassen (Mbembe 2001: 7). Eine eigene Vorgeschichte nationaler kapitalistischer Staatsgewalt Jene bürgerliche Form nationaler Staatsgewalt, die neuerdings als „normale“ Form kapitalistischer Staatsgewalt gehandelt wird, hat historische Voraussetzungen, die sich nahezu ausschließlich in Gesellschaften des europäischen Ancien Regime entwickelten.7 Einzelheiten sind hier nicht zu diskutieren, es muss zumindest aber festgehalten werden, dass sich in diesen Gesellschaften das Konzept des Interesses und die Praxis der Vertretung von Interessen entwickelten, dass Herrschaft im Laufe der Zeit nicht mehr nur faktisch durch konkurrierenden Machtbesitz, sondern auch rechtlich eingeschränkt wurde, dass weltliche und geistliche Macht zunehmend institutionell getrennt wurden, und dass sich - dies ist für unseren Zusammenhang von besonderer Relevanz - seit der Zeit der Reformation Öffentlichkeiten heraus bildeten, in denen über den rechten Glauben, über das allgemeine Wohl und über die Legitimität von Herrschaft gestritten wurde. (Gerstenberger 1990, 2006, III; IV und passim) Als es in Europa und Nordamerika zu jenen politisch-militärischen Auseinandersetzungen kam, aus denen schließlich die ersten souveränen Nationalstaaten hervorgingen,8 orientierten sich Forderungen an den kritisierten Strukturen: Gegen Privilegien konnte nur eine im Naturrecht fundierte Gleichheit gefordert werden, gegen die dynastische Souveränität nur eine in der „Nation“ verankerte Souveränität. Anders in Kolonialstaaten: Für die Formulierung eigener Ziele sahen sich Oppositionelle mit welthistorisch bereits fest etablierten Vorbildern konfrontiert. Selbst die Hinweise Kwame Nkrumahs oder Julius Nyereres auf eine vorkoloniale einheimische Demokratie ohne Parteienstreit bezogen sich auf international dominante Normen. Mit ihnen waren viele der afrikanischen politischen Führer durch den Unterricht in Missionsschulen vertraut geworden, viele hatten ihre Kenntnisse über Nationalismus, parlamentarische Demokratie, kapitalistische, aber auch sozialistische Wirtschaft während Aufenthalten im Ausland - einschließlich ihrer Aufenthalte in den Gefängnissen der Metropolstaaten - vertieft. Dennoch galt auch hier: Auch wenn soziale Praxis nie strukturell determiniert ist, entwickelt sie sich in vorgefundenen Bedingungen. Wesentliche Aspekte postkolonialer Staatlichkeit sind durch ihre spezifische Vorgeschichte geprägt. Obwohl die Staatsgewalt in den Kolonien zentralisiert war, stand die Praxis kolonialer Herrschaft der Entwicklung einer Imagination von „Nation“ entgegen.9 Denn die Kolonialstaaten hatten nicht nur sehr zufällige äußere Grenzen, die Kolonialverwaltungen hatten auch eine Herrschaftspraxis entwickelt, die sich vor allem auf die von ihnen selbst geschaffenen „ethnischen Räume“ richtete.10 Bayart zufolge ist die nationale Mobilisierung der Unabhängigkeitsbewegungen lange überschätzt worden (1989, 1993: 249). Christoph Marx hat (mit konkretem Bezug auf Simbabwe) darauf hingewiesen, dass sich die von den Wortführern vertretene Konzeption von Demokratie sehr schnell auf one man one vote reduzierte. (1999: 286).”翻译为中文","output":"国家分析作为偏差的界定 如果有人试图制作一个关于当代非洲国家特征最常被提及的频率表，那么很可能会得到一个列表，列表的首位是“效率不足”的标准。对撒哈拉以南的非洲而言，一个常常被提出的问题是，国家是否不仅声称拥有合法暴力的垄断，而且能够实施它。所谓的“国家衰败”暗示了这样的国家权力曾经存在（对许多人来说：Zartmann 1995），而“准国家”的说法则暗示它（尚）未完全实现。这里所指的偏差，或多或少地明确地参照了马克斯·韦伯关于现代国家的著名表述，即基于对欧洲现代国家形态的一般观察得出的分析概念。尤其是在国际关系理论和全球研究中，这一问题常被简单化地处理为规范性问题，正如让-弗朗索瓦·巴亚尔所写。他批评了一种“超市式的韦伯主义”（2004:123），缺乏对具体历史情境的参照（同上）。这一批评是正确的，但不够充分。因为马克斯·韦伯不仅明确地将他对现代国家的分析限定在“西方”特定的发展上，而且还将他所有的理论概念作为“理想类型”来发展。他将之理解为“使用经验材料进行理论构建”([1922] 1982: 205)。在对马克斯·韦伯的折扣版研究中，不仅忽略了他的特定理论策略，还假设以这种方式可靠地呈现了“强大”非混合国家的现实，以至于它们可以作为“弱”、“混合”国家的标准。当缺乏良好治理的说法被提出，而又隐含地假设在拥有发言权的捐赠和贷款机构的国家中普遍存在良好治理时，规范性走向了极致。因为非洲只是从其偏离中被感知到，科学和政治话语主导着调整非洲现实以使其符合所谓普遍规范的社会技术的可能性（Mbembe 2001: 7）。 民族资本主义国家权力的独特前史 最近被视为资本主义国家权力的“正常”形式的那种资产阶级民族国家权力，有其历史前提，几乎完全是在欧洲旧体制社会中发展起来的。讨论的细节不在这里讨论，但至少必须指出，在这些社会中发展了利益的概念和代表利益的实践，统治随时间不再仅是实际上由于竞争的权力持有而受限，也是在法律上受到限制，世俗和宗教权力逐渐机构分离，并且——尤其与我们的讨论相关——自宗教改革以来形成了公共领域，在该领域针对正统信仰、公共利益和统治的合法性进行争论。（Gerstenberger 1990, 2006, III; IV 及其它）当欧洲和北美经历了最终产生第一个主权民族国家的政治军事冲突时，要求是针对被批评的结构: 只能要求与自然权利相基础的平等对立于特权，只能要求以“民族”为基础的主权对立于王室主权。 殖民地国家的情况不同：对于制定自己目标的反对派来说，他们发现自己面对的是世界历史上已经牢固确立的楷模。即使科瓦梅·恩克鲁玛或朱利叶斯·尼雷尔提到的不涉及政党争斗的前殖民地民主，也是针对国际主导规范。许多非洲政治领袖通过在传教学校的教育熟悉了这些规范，许多人在国外停留期间——包括在宗主国监狱中的停留——深化了他们对民族主义、议会民主、资本主义以及社会主义经济的了解。 尽管如此，这里也适用：尽管社会实践从未被结构决定，但它是在既有条件下发展的。后殖民国家权力的重要方面受到其特定历史的影响。 尽管殖民地国家的国家权力被集中，殖民统治的实践阻碍了“民族”的想象发展。因为殖民地国家不仅有非常随机的外部边界，殖民行政还发展了一种主要针对由他们自己创造的“民族空间”的统治实践。巴亚尔认为，对独立运动的国家动员被高估了（1989, 1993: 249）。克里斯托夫·马克斯（以津巴布韦为具体参照）指出，代言人代表的民主概念很快就简化为one man one vote. (1999: 286)。"},{"instruction":"请将“Auch dort, wo der Unabhängigkeit jahrelange bewaffnete Kämpfe vorangingen, ist die Souveränität jener politischen Gebilde, die zurück blieben, als sich - ab Mitte der 1950er Jahre - die ersten Kolonialregierungen aus ihren afrikanischen Besitzungen zurück zogen, eher „gewährt“ als erkämpft worden. Ihre völkerrechtliche Verankerung erfolgte in der Deklaration Nr. 1514, welche die Generalversammlung der Vereinten Nationen 1960 in ihrer XV. Sitzung beschloss. In deren Titel heißt es aufschlussreich „on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples“. Souveränität war hier nicht Resultat einer im Inneren und nach Außen durchgesetzten Gewaltkompetenz, sondern Ausfluss des natürlichen Rechtes aller Völker auf vollständige Freiheit sowie auf die Ausübung ihrer Souveränität und die Aufrechterhaltung ihres nationalen Territoriums (Res. 1514, XV). 1970 wurde die bereits beschlossene völkerrechtliche Konstruktion präzisiert. Denn indem Kolonialreiche ihre Herrschaft in den Kolonien als „Staaten“ definiert hatten, galten die Kämpfe um Unabhängigkeit als Bürgerkriege (Chemillier-Gendreau 1995: 233). Wer sich daran beteiligte und dazu aufrief, war folglich ein Aufständischer. Als die Generalversammlung 1970 den unterdrückten Völkern das Recht zusprach, „mit allen notwendigen Mitteln“ gegen jene Kolonialmächte zu kämpfen, die ihr Streben nach Freiheit und Unabhängigkeit weiterhin unterdrückten (Res. 2621, XXV, insbes. Abs. 2), machten sie aus Bürgerkriegen in Kolonialstaaten „gerechte Kriege“. Indem dieses besondere Recht „dem jeweiligen Volk“ zugesprochen wurde, verlieh die Gene-ralversammlung den neuen politischen Gebilden zusammen mit der S ouveränität gewissermaßen gleichzeitig ein „Staatsvolk“. Denn das Recht auf Selbstbestimmung wurde nur der Gesamtheit einer in einem Kolonialstaat unterdrückten Bevölkerung zuerkannt, nicht etwa einer Ethnie innerhalb der zu konstituierenden postkolonialen Staaten. Mit der Deklaration von 1960 wurde der Souveränität postkolonialer Staaten folglich eine doppelte völkerrechtliche Bestandsgarantie zugestanden: gegenüber anderen souveränen Staaten und gegenüber internen Forderungen politischer Autonomie. Robert H. Jackson ist zuzustimmen: Die Resolution von 1960 zielte auf eine Verfestigung jenes politisch-geographischen status quo, dessen Grundlagen 1884/85 in Berlin gelegt worden waren (1993: 143).11 Indem sich viele afrikanische Aktivisten diesem international verbrei-teten Argumentationsmuster anpassten, verstetigten sie nicht nur die mehr als willkürlichen Grenzziehungen der kolonialen Herrschaft, sondern belasteten bereits vorab die zukünftige interne Entwicklung der neuen Staaten. Denn die Forderung der Unabhängigkeit im Namen einer gedachten Nation bedeutete zweierlei: Zum einen wurden alle anderen bislang entwickelten Zielsetzungen, so insbesondere die Forderung nach menschenwürdigen Arbeitsverhältnissen, dem Projekt der Nation-Bildung untergeordnet, zum anderen wurden damit auch alle anderen Bindungen als Nebensachen klassifiziert. Während Monique Chemillier-Gendreau noch zugesteht, dass „das Recht der Völker“, wenngleich es unweigerlich die Identität von Staat und Nation unterstellt, in einem bestimmten historischen Moment nützlich war, um die Kolonialfrage zu lösen (1995: 321) trug Frederick Cooper zufolge die Unterordnung der Forderungen nach menschenwürdigen Arbeitsbedingungen unter das Projekt der nationalen Unabhängigkeit mit dazu bei, dass die afrikanische Entkolonisierung zur Tragödie wurde (1996: 468 f.).12 Im Prozess der Konstitution afrikanischer Postkolonien wurden die neuen politischen Institutionen und ihr führendes Personal nicht etwa durch Strukturen der Partizipation oder durch Inhalte von Politik, sondern nahezu ausschließlich durch den Befreiungskampf legitimiert. Nationale Souveränität in der Sub-Sahara Obwohl die Staaten der Sub-Sahara nicht aus eigener Kraft souverän wurden, sind sie völkerrechtlich im Prinzip dennoch allen anderen Nationalstaaten gleichgestellt. Allerdings wurde den zuvor kolonial beherrschten Völkern bereits in der zitierten Resolution der Vereinten Nationen aus dem Jahre 1960 zugemutet, das Recht auf die Nutzung ihres nationalen Reichtums und ihrer Ressourcen without prejudice gegen Verpflichtungen auszuüben, die aus „internationaler ökonomischer Kooperation“ erwachsen waren. Anders gesagt: der allgemeine Grundsatz der Souveränität über die nationalen Ressourcen wurde konstatiert, sogleich jedoch durch Verpflichtungen aufgrund spezifischer „Kooperationsbeziehungen“ eingeschränkt.13 Auch ohne diese Verteidigung einer spezifischen Interpretation des internationalen Rechts wäre die Souveränität über die nationalen Ressourcen faktisch dadurch begrenzt gewesen, dass in den neuen Staaten, die über solche Ressourcen verfügten, nicht genügend einheimisches Kapital vorhanden war, um sie auszubeuten.14 Aus der Tatsache, dass Sitz und Stimme in der Generalversammlung der Vereinten Nationen unabhängig von machtpolitischen und wirtschaftlichen Beschränkungen der Souveränität einzelner Staaten sind,15 konnte in der Zeit des Kalten Krieges im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes Profit geschlagen werden. Indem sich die Regierungen der Großmächte die Freundschaft ihrer Verbündeten in der Sub-Sahara etwas kosten ließen und dabei geflissentlich übersahen, zu welchem Zweck die jeweils gewährte „Entwicklungshilfe“ eingesetzt wurde, schufen sie ein System der Alimentierung politischer Eliten. Mit dem Ende der Konfrontation zwischen den großen Blöcken, entfiel diese politische Rente, die aus der Souveränität gewonnen werden konnte.16 Afrika stand als der große Verlierer des Kalten Krieges da (Kabou 1993, 1995: 91). Das hatte sehr weit reichende Folgen. Denn der Wegfall vorheriger Alimentierungen führte vielerorts zu einer Verschärfung der Konkurrenz um die vorhandenen Chancen der Aneignung. In diesem Zusammenhang gewann der Bezug auf Ethnien nahezu überall neue Bedeutung. Er dient seither zur Legitimation traditioneller „natürlicher“ Ansprüche. Dass der „Fetisch Ethnie“ in seiner heutigen Fassung nicht etwa Ausdruck der traditionellen afrikanischen Gesellschaften, sondern jüngsten Datums ist,17 wird nicht nur in dominanten journalistischen und politischen Diskursen über Afrika unterschlagen, sondern ist längst auch in internen Debatten ausgelöscht. Die Herausbildung der spezifischen Form einer „Souveränität unter Vormund-schaft“ (Mbembe) ist allerdings nicht nur dem Ende der Blockkonfrontation, sondern auch dem Ende des Rohstoffbooms samt dem Verfall der cash crop Preise auf dem Weltmarkt in den späten 1970er Jahren geschuldet. Obwohl die vorhergehende Weltmarktkonjunktur nicht alle Staaten gleichmäßig begünstigt hatte, waren doch vielerorts Industrialisierungsprogramme in Gang gesetzt worden. Ihre Entwicklung war jedoch nicht stabil genug, um in der Krise standhalten zu können. In dieser Situation wurden viele afrikanische Regierungen auf Kredite angewiesen. Den dominanten wirtschafts- und entwicklungspolitischen Auffassungen zufolge wurden diese Kredite nur unter einschneidenden Konditionen vergeben. Afrikanische Regierungen sahen sich gezwungen, sie zu akzeptieren. Nirgends wurden die so genannten Strukturanpassungsreformen mit derartiger Konsequenz durchgeführt wie in Afrika (Goldberg 2008: 129). Die Gläubiger ertrotzten sich Verfügungsgewalt über Eckpunkte von Staatshaushalten und den Ausbau der Staatsadministration, über Zollpolitik, die Aufrechterhaltung oder Beseitigung öffentlicher Einrichtungen und über Sozialpolitik, kurz: über zentrale Inhalte staatlicher Selbständigkeit. Achille Mbembe zufolge haben Weltbank und IWF die Regierungen der Postkolonien gewissermaßen in eine Art Kriegszustand gegenüber der armen Bevölkerung ihres Landes getrieben (Mbembe 2001: 74). Dazu hat nicht zuletzt beigetragen, dass die Staatsausgaben nur dann in dem von den internationalen Finanzinstitutionen geforderten Maße reduziert werden konnten, wenn den Beschäftigten im Staatsdienst ihre zuvor erheblichen materiellen Privilegien entzogen wurden (Bratton/van de Walle 1997: 294). Auf diese Weise haben die Kreditkonditionen mit dazu beigetragen, die Korruption zu einem festen Bestandteil der öffentlichen Verwaltung zu machen.”翻译为中文","output":"即使在那些经历了多年武装斗争的地区，在第一批殖民政府从1950年代中期开始撤出其非洲领土后留下的政治实体的主权也更多是“授予”的而非争取来的。它们的国际法地位是在1960年联合国大会第十五届会议通过的第1514号宣言中确认的。在这一宣言的标题中有启示性地写着“授予殖民地国家和人民独立”。在这里，主权不是内部和外部强制力量的结果，而是所有人民天赋的完全自由以及行使他们主权和维护他们国家领土的自然权利的流露（决议1514，XV）。1970年，已决定的国际法构建得到了精确化。因为殖民帝国已经将他们在殖民地的统治定义为“国家”，独立斗争被视为内战。当联合国大会在1970年授予被压迫人民以“一切必要手段”对抗继续压制他们争取自由和独立的殖民势力的权利时（决议2621，XXV，尤其是第2段）， 他们将殖民地的内战变成了“正义的战争”。通过将这一特殊权利授予“相应的人民”，联合国大会与主权一起赋予了新的政治实体一个“国民”。因为自决权只授予殖民地国家中被压迫的人民，而不是构成后殖民国家的某个民族。通过1960年的宣言，给予后殖民国家的主权因此获得了双重国际法保证：对外对其他主权国家和对内对政治自治的要求。罗伯特·H·杰克逊的观点是正确的：1960年的决议旨在巩固那些在1884/85年柏林会议上奠定基础的政治地理现状（1993：143）。通过许多非洲活动人士适应这一国际广泛传播的论证模式，他们不仅巩固了殖民统治的任意边界，而且还在未来内部发展新国家之前就已经负担重重。因为，以一个想象的民族的名义要求独立意味着两件事：一方面，所有其他目标，特别是对人道工作条件的要求，都被置于国家建设项目之下，另一方面，所有其他联系也被归类为次要。莫妮克·谢米利耶-詹德罗承认，“人民的权利”虽然不可避免地假设了国家与民族的身份，在解决殖民问题的特定历史时刻是有益的（1995: 321），但弗雷德里克·库珀认为，工作条件的要求从属于国家独立项目有助于非洲去殖民化变成悲剧（1996: 468 f.）。在非洲后殖民地的形成过程中，新的政治机构及其领导人的合法性几乎完全是由解放斗争授权的，而不是通过参与结构或政治内容。 在撒哈拉以南的国家拥有的主权虽然不是靠自己的力量赢得的，但从国际法的原则上，它们与其他所有国家平等。然而，在1960年引述的联合国决议中就已经暗示了，之前殖民地被奴役的人民被要求在不损害由“国际经济合作”产生的义务的情况下行使对他们国家财富和资源的使用权。换言之，对国家资源主权的一般原则得到了确认，但立即通过基于特定“合作关系”的义务而受到限制。即使没有这种对国际法的特定解释的捍卫，对国家资源主权的事实上的限制也是由于在拥有这些资源的新国家中没有足够的本地资本来开发它们。 坐在联合国大会的席位和发言权独立于个别国家主权的政治和经济限制，使得冷战时期可以从字面上获利。通过大国政府花钱购买其在撒哈拉以南非洲的盟友的友谊，并且故意忽视所提供的“发展援助”是如何被使用的，他们创造了一种政治精英抚养体系。随着大阵营对抗的结束，这种从主权中获得的政治租金消失了。非洲成为冷战的最大输家（Kabou 1993, 1995: 91）。这产生了深远的影响。因为之前的补助金的消失导致许多地方争夺现有的占有机会变得更加激烈。在这种情况下，民族的引用几乎无处不在，成为合法化传统“自然”权利的新手段。\\"民族神话\\"在其今天的版本不是传统非洲社会的表达，而是最近的产物，这一点不仅在主导非洲的新闻和政治话语中被忽略，而且也在内部辩论中被抹去。 然而，特定形式的“监护下的主权”（Mbembe）的形成并非仅由于冷战结束和1970年代晚期原材料热潮结束及世界市场上原材料价格下跌造成的。尽管上一个世界市场繁荣时期并未使所有国家均等受益，但许多地方确实启动了工业化计划。它们的发展却不够稳定以抵御危机。在这种情况下，许多非洲政府变得依赖借贷。按照主流经济和发展政策观点，这些贷款只在深刻的条件下提供。非洲政府被迫接受它们。没有其他地方像非洲一样彻底地执行了所谓的结构调整改革（Goldberg 2008: 129）。债权人强迫获得对国家预算和国家行政建设、关税政策、维持或废除公共设施及社会政策的核心内容的控制权——简而言之，对国家自主权的核心内容。正是这些贷款条件的帮助，使得腐败成为公共管理的固定组成部分。"},{"instruction":"请将“Zugleich förderte die internationale Krise in afrikanischen Staaten die Tendenz, Regulierungskompetenzen, die in nationaler Souveränität begründet sind, zu „vermarkten“. Die Vermarktung nationaler Souveränität In den letzten Jahrzehnten sind in vielen Staaten der Welt rechtliche Ausnahmen von der Allgemeingültigkeit der nationalen Gesetze geschaffen worden. Die Nutzung dieser Ausnahmeregelungen wird Nicht-Staatsbürgern angeboten. Es wurden und werden also gesonderte Rechtsräume geschaffen, in denen sich international mobiles Kapital außerhalb nationa1er Regulierungen engagieren kann. Solche Offshore-Konditionen basieren auf der Kompetenz der Regierungen souveräner Staaten, ihre Regulierungskompetenz anzuwenden oder auf solche Anwendung zu verzichten. Faktisch sind dadurch Rechtsräume geschaffen worden, in denen sich Kapitalismus pur entwickeln kann. Offshore-Konditionen gibt es in drei verschiedenen Versionen: Als Angebot von Finanzdienstleistungen außerhalb nationaler Geld- und Bankgesetze, als Angebot besonderer Investitionsbedingungen für ausländische Investoren und als Angebot so genannter offener Schiffsregister. Regierungen von Industriegesellschaften haben diese Entwicklung sowohl im Ausland akzeptiert als auch im eigenen Land geduldet. In manchen kleinen Inselstaaten, wie beispielsweise in Jersey, der besonderen Voraussetzungen wegen aber auch in der Volksrepublik China, wurde das Angebot an Offshore-Konditionen zur Basis einer nachhaltigen ökonomischen Entwicklung, in anderen Staaten - so auch in Afrika - wird es vor allem zur Bereicherung der politischen Führungskräfte genutzt. Da Offshore- Konditionen zwar auf dem Weltmarkt angeboten werden, die nationale Souveränität internationalem Recht zufolge aber unveräußerlich ist, lässt sich aus der Vermarktung dieser Konditionen privates Einkommen erzielen, so lange sie auf dem Weltmarkt nachgefragt werden. Diese Nachfrage kann auch dadurch gefördert werden, dass - mehr oder minder offen - verdeutlicht wird, dass auf die Kontrolle der Einhaltung jener Gesetze, die formal auch in den Offshore- Rechtsräumen gelten, verzichtet wird. In afrikanischen Offshore-Finanzzentren können legale Transaktionen außerhalb der national gültigen Regelungen getätigt, vielfach aber auch Profite aus kriminellen Geschäften „gewaschen“ werden.18 In Export Processing Zones werden ausländischen Investoren besonders günstige Bedingungen offeriert, darunter nicht selten ein Verbot gewerkschaftlicher Organisation der Beschäftigten.19 Schließlich sind afrikanische Staaten auch auf dem Weltmarkt für so genannte Flags of Convenience vertreten, bieten also die Registrierung von Schiffen zu sehr günstigen Bedingungen an und verzichten vor allem darauf, Vorschriften über die Staatsangehörigkeit der Besatzungen zu erlassen. Das macht es möglich, dass Schifffahrtsunternehmen legal überall auf der Welt Seeleute anheuern - so kostengünstig wie möglich. Da die so genannte Ausflaggung von Schiffen von den Regierungen der traditionell dominanten Schifffahrtsstaaten als legal akzeptiert wurde, ist die Entscheidung für die Registrierung eines Schiffs in einer so genannten Flag of Convenience heute ein alltäglicher betriebswirtschaftlicher Vorgang. Er hat beispielsweise dazu geführt, dass eine Mehrzahl der Containerschiffe in deutschem Eigentum bereits seit längerem unter der Flagge Liberias fährt. Die Eintragung in das nationale liberianische Schiffsregister nimmt die Liberia International Ship and Corporate Registry U.ISCIR vor, die ihren Sitz in Vienna, im Staat Virginia, USA hat. Von 1989 bis 1993, also in der Zeit heftigen Bürgerkriegs, ist die Zahl der unter liberianische Flagge fahrenden Schiffe von 1583 auf 1989 angestiegen (Montclos 1999: 234).20 Während das liberianischen Schiffsregister in den letzten Jahren zumeist im Mittelfeld jener Listen zu finden ist, die auf der Basis von Hafenstaatkontrollen zusammengestellt werden, stehen die Schiffsregister von Äquatorial Guinea und den Seychellen sehr viel weiter unten.21 Die Flaggen von Togo und Sierra Leone wurden im Juni 2008 zu den sechs Flaggen mit der höchsten Zahl an illegal arbeitenden Fischtrawlern gerechnet.22 Alle Vermarktung nationaler Souveränität ermöglicht sowohl staatliche als auch private Einkommen. Mitglieder der Regierung eines nach innen noch so wenig souveränen Staates können ausländischen Investoren Zutritt zum Territorium und dessen Ressourcen gestatten, indem sie eigenmächtig Verträge schließen und Dokumente fertigen lassen. Auf diese Weise bieten sie Investoren einen Schein der Rechtmäßigkeit und sichern sich selbst Einkunftsquellen (vgl. Reno 1999: 135; 151 u. passim). Die Vergabe von Export-, Import-, Bohr- oder Schürflizenzen, die Ausstellung von Urkunden, Genehmigungen für Bauvorhaben oder für die Abladung gefährlichen Mülls aus anderen Teilen der Welt, 23 nicht zu reden von der Nutzung politischer Wechselkurse für eine durch Inflation völlig entwertete nationale Währung, haben viele afrikanische Politiker sehr reich werden lassen. Bayart, Ellis und Hibou vertreten die These, die private Nutzung nationaler Souveränität erfolge inzwischen derart routinemäßig und habe ein solches Ausmaß angenommen, dass von einer Kriminalisierung des Staates in Afrika gesprochen werden müsse (1997/1999).24 Weniger pejorativ formuliert: die Nutzung nationaler Souveränität zur privaten Bereicherung verhindert die Freisetzung des Marktes. Konkurrenz ist - nicht nur, aber in großem Ausmaß - Konkurrenz um politische Macht. Diese Konkurrenz wird mit politischen Mitteln, vielfach aber auch mit Waffengewalt ausgetragen. Und nicht immer gibt es vor, während und nach einer Wahl einen deutlichen Unterschied zwischen den jeweiligen Strategien.25 Wird auf die Anwendung von Gewalt verzichtet, so gibt es regelmäßig Machenschaften zur Beschränkungen der Chancen von oppositionellen Parteien. Genau besehen sind allerdings oft nur die Formen spezifisch „afrikanisch“. So auch, wenn Dorfbewohner in Benin erwarten, dass Kandidaten nicht nur Reden schwingen, sondern auch Geschenke mitbringen und Schnaps offerieren. Wahlen bieten die Chance, etwas „von dem Geld zurück zu bekommen, das die Politiker uns gestohlen haben“, zitiert Richard Banegas einen Gesprächspartner (1998: 79). Wonach sich die Wahl dann tatsächlich richtet, steht auf einem anderen Blatt.26 Von Wahlkämpfen so weit als möglich zu profitieren, ist umso nahe liegender, als kaum politischer Wandel zu erwarten ist. Während ausländische Beobachter aus der Zulassung von mehreren Parteien und vergleichsweise geordneten Wahlverfahren27 vielfach auf demokratischen Wandel schließen,28 hat der Übergang von Einparteien- zu Mehrparteiensystemen die tatsächliche Regierungspraxis kaum geändert.29 Die gewählten Versammlungen, ob es sich um Parteigremien, um Parlamente oder andere handle, seien alles andere als Vertretungen der Wahlberech- tigten, betont Bayart. (1989/1993: 167).30 Claude Arditi erklärt dies damit, dass die zuvor etablierten kriminellen Strukturen des Staates fortdauern (2003: 56f.). Mit konkretem Bezug auf Burkina Faso erläutert Augustin Loada, dass in einer lange durch die erdrückende Dominanz eines Präsidenten geprägten politischen Situation Wahlen, zu denen mehrere Parteien zugelassen sind, bestenfalls eine Umwandlung der Einheitspartei in mehrere „hyperdominante Parteien“ bewirken (1998, passim). Patrick Chabal und Jean-Pascal Daloz weisen darauf hin, dass nach Wahlen regelmäßig die Führer der unterlegenen Partei in die regierende Gruppe kooptiert werden (1999: 55 f.) und Michael Bratton sowie Nicolas van de Walle betonen, dass Regimewechsel die Kontinuität des Personals in den obersten Rängen der Verwaltung bislang kaum je unterbrochen haben. Obwohl es Bewegungen zugunsten von Demokratisierung manchmal gelinge, zu Beginn des Regimewechsels Korruption und Klientelismus etwas einzuschränken, stellten sich unter den gegebenen Bedingungen die alten Zustände schnell wieder her. Und vielfach seien gewählte Politiker auch versucht, die Möglichkeiten privater Bereicherung gerade deshalb möglichst schnell gründlich auszunutzen, weil die Dauer ihrer Amtszeit ungewiss sei (1997: 259). Auch nach den Reformen der frühen 1990er Jahre besteht die alte Ordnung in ihren wichtigsten Elementen fort (Joseph 2008: 113).31”翻译为中文","output":"同时，国际危机促使非洲国家将其国家主权中的监管职能“市场化”。 国家主权的市场化 在过去的几十年中，世界许多国家为国家法律的普遍适用性创造了法律例外。这些例外规定的利用被提供给非公民。因此，创建了特殊的法律空间，国际流动资本可以在这些空间中免受国家监管的参与。这种离岸条件基于主权国家政府行使其监管能力或放弃这种能力的能力。事实上，这些条件创造了可以自由发展的资本主义空间。 离岸条件存在于三个不同的版本：作为金融服务提供方提供的、在国家货币和银行法之外的服务；为外国投资者提供的特殊投资条件；以及所谓的开放船籍的提供。工业社会的政府无论在国外还是在本国都接受了这种发展。在一些如泽西岛这样的小岛屿国家，由于特殊条件，甚至在中国，离岸条件的提供成为了可持续经济发展的基础，在其他国家，如在非洲，它主要被用来丰富政治领导人。由于离岸条件虽然在世界市场上提供，但根据国际法，国家主权不可割让，因此，只要世界市场上有需求，就可以通过市场化这些条件来获得私人收入。这种需求还可以通过暗示或不那么暗示地表明在这些离岸法律空间中，对那些在正式上同样适用的法律的遵守控制将被放弃来促进。 在非洲的离岸金融中心，可以在国家法规之外进行合法交易，但往往也可以“洗净”来自犯罪生意的利润。在出口加工区，向外国投资者提供特别有利的条件，其中往往包括禁止雇员组建工会。非洲国家也在所谓的便利旗船籍的世界市场上占有一席之地，提供以非常有利的条件注册船只，并主要放弃对船员国籍的规定。这使得航运公司可以在全球任何地方合法地雇佣海员——尽可能地节省成本。由于传统主导航运国家的政府已将船只的外籍注册视为合法，因此选择在所谓的便利旗下注册船只如今已成为日常的商业操作。这导致了许多德国所有的集装箱船长期以来已在利比里亚旗下航行。自1989年至1993年，也就是在激烈的内战期间，利比里亚旗下的船只数量从1583艘增加到1989艘（Montclos 1999: 234）。而利比里亚国际船舶和公司注册处（LISCR），负责登记利比里亚国籍船只，其办事处设在美国弗吉尼亚州的维也纳。近年来，利比里亚船籍在根据港口国控制编制的名单上通常位于中游，而赤道几内亚和塞舌尔的船籍则排名更低。多哥和塞拉利昂的旗帜被列为2008年6月拥有最高数量的非法作业渔船的六面旗帜之一。 所有的国家主权市场化都允许国家和私人收入。即便是对内部极不主权的国家政府成员，也可以通过私自签订合同和制作文件，允许外国投资者进入其领土及资源，为投资者提供合法性的假象，为自己确保收入来源（见 Reno 1999: 135; 151 及相关内容）。颁发出口、进口、钻探或勘探许可证，出具证书、批准建筑项目或允许从世界其他地区卸载危险废物，更不用说利用政治汇率为通货膨胀完全贬值的国家货币，使许多非洲政客变得非常富有。Bayart, Ellis 和 Hibou 提出的观点是，国家主权的私人利用如此日常化且达到了如此规模，以至于可以谈论非洲国家的犯罪化（1997/1999）。用更中性的说法：国家主权用于个人致富阻碍了市场的释放。竞争——不仅是但在很大程度上——是争夺政治权力的竞争。 这场竞争是通过政治手段进行的，但往往也通过武力进行。并不总是在选举前、期间和之后之间有明确的策略区别。如果没有使用武力，那么通常会有手段限制反对派政党的机会。仔细看来，这些形式往往只是“非洲特有”的。就像在贝宁的村民期望候选人不仅发表演讲，还带来礼物和提供烈酒一样。选举提供了一次从政治家那里“拿回他们偷走的钱”的机会，正如理查德·巴内加斯引用一位谈话者所说（1998: 79）。选举实际上是依据什么进行的，又是另一回事。越来越有可能从选举中获利，因为几乎不会有政治变革。而外国观察家从多党制和相对有序的选举程序中经常推断出民主变革，过渡从单党制到多党制几乎未改变实际的执政实践。选举出的议会，无论是党组织、议会还是其他机构，都远非选民的代表，Bayart 强调（1989/1993: 167）。Claude Arditi 解释说，这是因为之前建立的国家的犯罪结构持续存在（2003: 56f.）。具体针对布基纳法索，Augustin Loada 解释说，在一个长期被总统的压倒性统治所主导的政治环境中，多党选举最多只能导致由“超级主导政党”转变（1998, passim）。Patrick Chabal 和 Jean-Pascal Daloz 指出，选举后通常会有败选党的领导人被纳入执政集团（1999: 55 f.）而 Michael Bratton 以及 Nicolas van de Walle 强调，政权更替几乎未中断过高级行政人员的连续性。尽管有时民主化运动在政权更替开始时有助于在一定程度上减轻腐败和裙带关系的问题，但在既定条件下，旧状很快就会恢复。而且，当选的政客也往往会试图尽可能快地彻底利用私人致富的机会，因为他们的任期不确定（1997: 259）。即使在90年代初的改革之后，旧秩序在其核心要素中仍然持续存在（Joseph 2008: 113）。"},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily and Iris are challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s and Iris’s because I’m 10 years older than them. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily and Iris cast on me a spell that regresses me by 2 year physically and mentally and ages them both by 2 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while theirs increase. Come up with a complex excessive formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn, Lily’s and Iris’s stats increase each by the same amount that I lose (not distributed, just the same amount for each). To account for the differences in skill there should be wide margins between the three, and required stats from spells can range from 5 to 100. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s and Iris’s stats should start at 20% of my stats. Because Lily and Iris are a duo, they each get to cast a spell each turn. I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily and Iris. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give a list of 20 spells we have access to (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker and a points tracker. Remember Lily and Iris are a team, so their points are merged.","output":"Welcome to the grand elaborately staged arena, where the magical dueling competition is reaching its climax.

Их взгляды на будущее часто формировались окружающей средой, религиозными и мифологическими убеждениями, преданиями и предсказаниями. Будущее мыслилось скорее в контексте урожая, войн, правительственных изменений или божественных вмешательств, а не в плане технического или научного прогресса. # Представления о будущем: 1. **Египет**: Древние египтяне верили в вечную жизнь после смерти, что отражалось в их тщательном подходе к погребальным обычаям и постройке пирамид. Их взгляд на будущее был тесно связан с загробной жизнью, а не с мирскими технологическими достижениями. 2. **Греция**: В древнегреческой культуре существовало множество предсказаний и пророчеств, например через оракулов, таких как Пифия в Дельфах. Философы и ученые, такие как Аристотель, в меньшей степени обращали свой взгляд на будущее, но больше занимались вопросами природы, этики и устройства государства. 3. **Рим**: В древнем Риме подход к будущему был практичен, с акцентом на строительство империи, развитие правовой системы и инфраструктурных проектов, таких как дороги и акведуки. Римляне стремились укрепить и расширить свою власть, а предсказаниям и пророчествам уделялось много внимания. # Страхи: 1. **Естественные катастрофы:** Землетрясения, наводнения, извержения вулканов - древние часто воспринимали их как гнев богов или предсказание конца света. 2. **Войны и завоевания:** Войны были постоянной угрозой для древних цивилизаций, и люди боялись как вторжения враждебных сил, так и потери своих земель и свободы. 3. **Эпидемии:** Болезни, от которых не было лекарства, такие как чума, вызывали огромный страх, унося миллионы жизней. 4. **Мистические угрозы:** В зависимости от региона и культуры, страхи перед демонами, злыми духами, проклятиями и другими сверхъестественными явлениями были распространены. Это также включало боязнь гнева богов или божественного наказания за грехи. В заключение, древние люди в основном фокусировались на непосредственных угрозах и вызовах, стоящих перед их обществами, а их мышление о будущем формировалось мифами, религией и общественными ожиданиями той эпохи."},{"instruction":"Как себе представляли будущее в технологическом плане жители античного мира и чего больше всего боялись в плане событий (как реальных явлений, так и мистического плана).","output":"Как и в других древних цивилизациях, в античном мире не было чётко выраженного представления о будущем в технологическом смысле, по крайней мере, таким, как мы его понимаем сейчас. Интересы того времени были сосредоточены на улучшении уже существующих технологий и инструментов, таких как строительство, сельское хозяйство, водоснабжение, а также военные технологии. Однако некоторые философы и учёные Древней Греции и Рима задумывались о возможностях человека и общества в будущем. # Античные представления о будущем: 1. **Механизмы и автоматы**: Древние греки уже создавали простые механизмы и автоматы. Легенды о механических созданиях, таких как страж бронзовый Талос или механические слуги Гефеста, могли отражать мечты о более развитой автоматизации. 2. **Строительство и архитектура**: Великие строительные проекты, такие как пирамиды в Египте, Висячие сады Семирамиды в Вавилоне, и развитие городов с расширенными торговыми сетями демонстрируют интерес к улучшению инфраструктуры и жилища. 3. **Математика и астрономия**: Представления о будущем можно также заметить в развитии математики и астрономии. Античные учёные пытались понять устройство Вселенной, что демонстрирует их желание обладать знанием, способным изменить будущее. # Страхи античного мира: 1. **Естественные катастрофы**: Землетрясения, наводнения и другие природные явления считались проявлением гнева богов. Люди опасались, что боги могут наказать их за преступления или грехи. 2. **Войны и завоевания**: Античный мир был миром постоянных военных конфликтов. Города и целые цивилизации могли быть уничтожены в результате завоеваний. 3. **Болезни и эпидемии**: Эпидемии могли быстро распространяться по городам с высокой плотностью населения, уничтожая значительную часть населения. 4. **Восстания и социальное недовольство**: Социальное недовольство и восстания рабов, такие как восстание Спартака, вызывали страх у правящих слоёв населения. 5. **Мистические страхи**: Астрология и гадания играли большую роль в античном мире, и неблагоприятные предсказания могли вызвать страхи у населения, равно как и религиозные пророчества об апокалипсисе или карах за грехи. Таким образом, представления о будущем в античном мире были тесно связаны с текущими достижениями и наблюдениями в области технологий, строительства, науки, при этом глубоко укоренённые страхи часто проистекали из религиозных и мифологических представлений, а также из вполне реальных угроз социального и природного характера."},{"instruction":"Как себе представляли будущее в технологическом плане жители средневекового мира и чего больше всего боялись в плане событий (как реальных явлений, так и мистического плана).","output":"В средневековом мире представления о будущем сильно отличались от современных взглядов, особенно в технологическом аспекте. Большинство технологических инноваций происходило в области аграрной деятельности, военных технологий и архитектуры, хотя эти нововведения воспринимались не столько как взгляд в будущее, сколько как средства улучшения текущих условий жизни. # Представления о будущем: 1. **Военные технологии**: В средние века развитие военных технологий, таких как усовершенствованный доспех, замковое строительство и разработка осадных машин, было практически единственной областью, где можно наблюдать стремление к технологическому прогрессу. Эти инновации, однако, воспринимались как необходимость защиты или расширения территорий, а не как устремление к высоким технологическим будущим. 2. **Аграрные технологии**: Введение трёхпольной системы, усовершенствование плуга и применение вьючных животных, в значительной степени, повысили сельскохозяйственную производительность. Эти достижения направлены были на настоящее и ближайшее будущее, чтобы обеспечить выживание и стабильность. # Страхи средневекового мира: 1. **Болезни**: Самым большим и реальным страхом средневековья была чума, в том числе Чёрная смерть 14-го века, унёсшая жизни миллионов людей. Болезнь воспринималась как божественное наказание, и средства борьбы с ней были крайне ограничены. 2. **Войны и вторжения**: Постоянные войны, включая крестовые походы, нападения викингов и междинастические конфликты, вызывали страх и неопределённость относительно будущего. 3. **Голод и неурожай**: В средние века голод был постоянной угрозой, усугубляемой плохими урожаями, что могло привести к массовому голоду и социальным потрясениям. 4. **Религиозные страхи**: Жизнь в средневековом обществе была глубоко пронизана религией. Люди боялись гнева Бога, Судного дня и вечных мук в аду за грехи. Эти страхи часто использовались религиозными и светскими властями для контроля над населением. 5. **Мистические и сверхъестественные страхи**: Верования в колдовство, ведьм, демонов и другие сверхъестественные явления были распространены. Ведьмовские процессы и охота на ведьм, особенно в позднем Средневековье, отражают глубоко укоренившиеся страхи перед неизведанным и мистическим. В совокупности, средневековый мир видел будущее сквозь призму текущих вызовов и препятствий, а технологический прогресс, хоть и имел место, редко рассматривался в контексте далекого будущего. Главными страхами людей того времени были непосредственные угрозы их физическому и духовному существованию."},{"instruction":"Как себе представляли будущее в технологическом плане (в том числе несбывшихся изобретениях изобретателей этого периода) жители 15, 16 и 17 веках вместе взятых и чего больше всего боялись в плане событий (как реальных явлений, так и мистического плана (мистических в реальных слухах и в литературе того времени).","output":"В период 15-17 веков, известном как Возрождение и начало Нового времени, произошло значительное оживление в науке и искусстве, которое было отчасти вызвано возрождением интереса к античному наследию и новым географическим открытиям. В это время формировался новый взгляд на мир, и люди начали задумываться о возможностях и пределах человеческого разума и технологий. # Представления о будущем и несбывшиеся изобретения: 1. **Леонардо да Винчи** (1452–1519) оставил после себя множество эскизов и проектов, многие из которых были своеобразными взглядами в будущее: летательные аппараты, в том числе проект параплана и вертолёта, подводная лодка, различные военные машины. Хотя многие из этих идей не были реализованы в его время, они предвосхитили многие поздние технологические достижения. 2. В **16 веке** появились проекты создания механических автоматов и различных механизмов, предназначенных для упрощения жизни и работы людей. 3. **Корнелис Дреббель** (1572–1633) в начале 17 века создал одну из первых подводных лодок, которая совершила погружение на Темзе и способна была находиться под водой несколько часов. Это изобретение было встречено со смесью восхищения и недоверия. # Страхи периода 15-17 веков: 1. **Религиозные и мистические страхи**: Ожидание конца света, антихриста и апокалипсиса было распространено в тот период из-за религиозных войн, реформации и контрреформации. Пророчества, астрология и оккультизм пользовались большой популярностью, создавая предпосылки для массовых страхов и истерий. 2. **Страх перед эпидемиями**: Чума продолжала оставаться главным страхом Европы. Вспышки чумы могли за короткий срок уничтожить большую часть населения города. 3. **Ведовские процессы**: Верования в ведьм и магию привели к многочисленным ведовским процессам, особенно сильно распространённым в 16 и начале 17 веков в Европе. Страх и недоверие к соседям в комбинации с охотой на ведьм создавали атмосферу паранойи. 4. **Политические и социальные страхи**: Время крупных геополитических изменений, открытий новых земель и начала колониализма также было периодом внутриполитических интриг, дворцовых переворотов и революций. Например, Английская гражданская война 17 века определила будущее развитие Англии и страх перед возможностью социального хаоса и анархии.

Хотя многие из предложенных в тот период изобретений, таких как летающие машины, пока не нашли свою реализацию, они являлись предвестниками современной авиации. - **Жюль Верн** в своих романах предсказал множество технологий и изобретений, таких как подводные лодки и космические путешествия, которые стали реальностью в 20 веке. 2. **Литературные произведения**: - Романы **Жюля Верна** и **Герберта Уэллса** наполнены идеею прогресса и возможностями науки, что вдохновляло читателей на размышления о технологическом будущем. - **Мэри Шелли** в своём романе \\"Франкенштейн\\" вызвала вопросы этичности в науке и опасности неконтролируемого научного прогресса. # Страхи 18 и 19 веков: 1. **Политические и социальные изменения**: Революционные движения в Европе, в том числе Французская революция и последующие Наполеоновские войны, вызывали страхи перед социальными потрясениями и изменениями в строе общества. 2. **Потеря работы из-за машин**: С ростом промышленности и внедрением машин в производственный процесс возникла «льнотрясение», движение против внедрения ткацких станков, так как люди боялись потери работы и средств к существованию. 3. **Болезни**: Эпидемии холеры и других болезней, быстро распространяющихся в густонаселённых промышленных городах, подпитывали страх перед невидимым врагом, не поддающимся контролю. 4. **Мистические и сверхъестественные страхи**: Несмотря на прогресс науки, интерес к оккультизму и сверхъестественному, также сохранялся и даже усиливался в некоторых кругах, что приводило к возникновению страхов, связанных с неведомым и тайным. Так, жители 18 и 19 веков видели будущее как период огромных технологических и социальных изменений, но это видение сопровождалось серьёзными опасениями относительно порядка в обществе, моральных и этических аспектов прогресса, а также страхом перед неизвестным."},{"instruction":"Как себе представляли будущее в технологическом плане (в том числе несбывшихся изобретениях изобретателей этого периода и литературных произведений на эту тему) жители периода с 1900 по 1979 года вместе взятых и чего больше всего боялись в плане событий (как реальных явлений, так и мистического плана (мистических в реальных слухах и в литературе того времени)).","output":"Период с 1900 по 1979 года был временем огромных научных и технологических сдвигов, который охватывает эпоху от бурного развития промышленности до зари космической эры и информационных технологий. Это время первых автомобилей, полётов, атомной энергии, компьютеров, и начала изучения космоса. Люди с оптимизмом смотрели в будущее, ожидая новых технологических прорывов и улучшения качества жизни, хотя это также было временем глубоких социальных изменений, войн, и геополитических конфликтов, породивших свои страхи и опасения. # Представления о будущем и несбывшиеся изобретения: 1. **Литературные произведения и фильмы** того времени, такие как работы **Жюля Верна**, **Герберта Уэллса**, а позже **Артура Кларка** и **Исаака Азимова**, представляли собой восхитительные видения будущего с космическими путешествиями, подводными городами, летающими автомобилями и другими удивительными технологиями. Некоторые из этих идей, например космические путешествия, стали реальностью, в то время как другие, такие как универсальные личные летающие средства, пока что остаются мечтой. 2. **Космическая гонка** между СССР и США подстегнула интерес к космическим полётам и освоению космоса, приведя к появлению многочисленных научно-фантастических произведений и представлений о будущих космических колониях. 3. **Технологические прогнозы** того времени часто превосходили реальное развитие событий, предвещая массовое использование атомной энергии, автоматизацию всего и везде, и трансформацию повседневной жизни человека с помощью технологий. # Страхи периода: 1. **Ядерная война**: В период холодной войны страх перед ядерной катастрофой был общемировым. Фильмы, книги и общественное мнение отражали глубокую обеспокоенность возможностью глобального ядерного конфликта. 2. **Глобальные катастрофы**: Страхи перед глобальными катастрофами, такими как пандемии (напоминающие испанский грипп 1918 года), экологические бедствия, вызванные человеческой деятельностью, начали проникать в общественное сознание. 3. **Потеря человечности**: Возрастающее обеспокоенность этическими и социальными последствиями технологического прогресса, вопросы о влиянии компьютеров и автоматизации на труд и личностную свободу. 4. **Мистические и конспирологические страхи**: Появление и распространение различных конспирологических теорий, например, о пришельцах, правительственных заговорах, секретных технологиях, также отражает страхи этих десятилетий. Таким образом, период с 1900 по 1979 год был временем исключительного технологического оптимизма, сопровождаемого глубокими опасениями относительно будущих катастроф, ядерной войны, и последствий необузданного научного прогресса."},{"instruction":"Как себе представляли будущее в технологическом плане (в том числе несбывшихся изобретениях изобретателей этого периода и литературных произведений на эту тему) жители периода с 1980 по 2023 года вместе взятых и чего больше всего боялись в плане событий (как реальных явлений, так и мистического плана (мистических в реальных слухах и в литературе того времени)).","output":"С 1980 по 2023 годы мир пережил невероятный всплеск технологического развития, который затронул практически каждый аспект жизни. Этот период охарактеризован появлением и распространением Интернета, мобильной связи, персональных компьютеров, искусственного интеллекта и развитием биотехнологий. Представления о будущем сильно изменились с развитием этих технологий, и многие предсказания, как технические, так и литературные, ориентировались на интеграцию высоких технологий в повседневную жизнь. # Представления о будущем и несбывшиеся изобретения: 1. **Цифровой и Виртуальный миры**: Одним из значительных направлений стало развитие виртуальной реальности и цифровых миров. Хотя виртуальная реальность (VR) и дополненная реальность (AR) продолжают развиваться, ожидания относительно полной замены реального мира виртуальным пока полностью не оправдались. 2. **Искусственный интеллект и Робототехника**: Прогнозы относительно создания полностью автономных интеллектов и роботов, способных заменить человека в большинстве сфер деятельности, активно обсуждаются и имеют как прогресс, так и определённые ограничения. 3. **Космические путешествия и колонизация**: Ожидания относительно массовых космических путешествий и колонизации других планет, вдохновлённые научной фантастикой предыдущих десятилетий, претерпели реализацию в более ограниченном виде, хотя частные космические компании, такие как SpaceX, делают значительный прогресс в этой области. 4. **Литература и кино**: Произведения жанра киберпанк, такие как \\"Нейромант\\" Уильяма Гибсона, предполагали мир, где роль цифрового пространства и кибернетических технологий ещё выше, чем мы имеем сегодня. Кинофильмы и сериалы этого периода, такие как \\"Матрица\\", размышляли о взаимодействиях между реальностью и виртуальными мирами. # Страхи периода: 1. **Глобальное потепление и экологические катастрофы**: Растущая обеспокоенность изменением климата и его последствиями стала одной из главных угроз восприятия будущего. 2. **Приватность и наблюдение**: Распространение цифровых технологий породило страхи по поводу потери приватности и всепроникающего наблюдения, как государственного, так и корпоративного. 3. **Технологическое безработица**: Автоматизация и развитие ИИ вызывают опасения относительно массовой потери рабочих мест и экономических последствий. 4. **Кибервойны и кибертерроризм**: Возможность масштабных кибератак на критическую инфраструктуру стала важным источником беспокойства. 5. **Пандемии**: COVID-19 стал напоминанием о том, что пандемии могут иметь глубокие социальные и экономические последствия, влияя на восприятие безопасности и стабильности всего мира. Таким образом, период с 1980 по 2023 годы характеризуется быстрым развитием технологий, которое сформировало множество ожиданий и представлений о будущем, некоторые из которых оставались неосуществленными.

Is it possible that i drain HER 4G plan and gigabytes?","output":"Yes, it is possible that you may be using data from your mother's 4G plan and gigabytes if your device is connected to her prepaid SIM card. When a device is connected to a mobile data network through a SIM card, any data usage, including browsing, streaming, downloading, or using apps that require an internet connection, will consume data from the data plan associated with that SIM card. If your phone is using your mother's prepaid SIM card for data access, it is important to be mindful of your data usage to avoid accidentally using up the allocated data on her plan, which could lead to additional charges or reduced data speeds once the data limit is reached. To prevent using up your mother's data without her knowledge, you can try the following: 1. **Monitor Data Usage:** Check your phone's settings or use data monitoring apps to track how much data you are using. This will help you to stay within the limits of the plan. 2. **Use Wi-Fi:** Whenever possible, connect to a Wi-Fi network instead of using mobile data to conserve data from the prepaid SIM card. 3. **Communicate with Your Mother:** Let your mother know if you are using her SIM card for mobile data access and discuss any data usage guidelines or restrictions. By being mindful of data usage and communicating openly with your mother, you can prevent unintentionally using up her data plan and avoid any potential issues related to exceeding data limits on the prepaid SIM card."},{"instruction":"I want a plan for 4G but i dont want to spend more than 2 euros per month. What is minimum megabytes when you only use 4g for chatting apps.","output":"When using 4G for chatting apps only, such as messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, or Telegram, the data usage is relatively low compared to activities like streaming videos or downloading large files. Chatting apps primarily transmit text messages, images, and occasional voice calls, which consume minimal data. On average, a single text message uses very little data, usually just a few kilobytes. Sending or receiving images can consume more data, but they are still relatively small compared to video streaming. If you are mainly using chatting apps for text messages and occasional image sharing, you may not need a high data plan. A typical chat message might consume around 0.01 to 0.1 megabytes of data. Even with frequent messaging and some image sharing, the data usage for chatting apps may not exceed a few megabytes per month if you are a light user. Considering your budget limit of 2 euros per month, you could look for a mobile data plan that offers a low data allowance, such as 100MB or 200MB per month. This should be sufficient for using chatting apps without exceeding your budget. However, it's important to note that data usage can vary depending on the number of messages, images, and other factors. If you plan to use chatting apps more frequently or for other activities that consume data, you may need to consider a slightly higher data plan to ensure you have enough data for your needs. Before selecting a specific data plan, it's advisable to check with different mobile carriers in your area to compare their data plans and find one that fits your budget and data usage requirements for using 4G with chatting apps."},{"instruction":"i am using discord, do you know if that drains more mb than other apps, and if so. how much?","output":"Discord is a popular messaging and communication platform that is commonly used for text, voice, and video communication among online communities, gamers, and friends. The data usage for Discord can vary depending on the type of activities you are engaging in within the app. Here are some general estimations of data usage for different features of Discord: 1. **Text Messaging:** Sending and receiving text messages on Discord is similar to other messaging apps in terms of data usage. Text messages are very low in data consumption, typically ranging from a few kilobytes to a fraction of a megabyte for each message. 2. **Voice Calls:** Voice calls on Discord consume more data compared to text messaging, but they are still relatively efficient. The data usage for voice calls can vary, but on average, a voice call on Discord can consume around 0.5 to 1.5 megabytes per minute. 3. **Video Calls:** Video calls on Discord require more data compared to text messaging and voice calls. The data consumption for video calls can range from 4 to 12 megabytes per minute, depending on the video quality and resolution. Overall, Discord is considered to be relatively data-efficient for text messaging and voice communication. If you primarily use Discord for text messaging and voice calls, the data usage should be moderate and may not significantly impact your data plan, especially if you are a light to moderate user. If you are mainly using Discord for text messaging and occasional voice calls, a data plan with a low data allowance (such as 100MB to 200MB per month) should be sufficient to cover your usage without exceeding your budget of 2 euros per month. However, if you frequently engage in video calls or have active participation in voice channels, you may consider a slightly higher data plan to accommodate the increased data consumption. It's always recommended to monitor your data usage and adjust your plan accordingly based on your actual usage patterns to ensure you have sufficient data without overspending."},{"instruction":"I cannot find any providers that are 2 euros a month","output":"If you are having trouble finding mobile data plans that fit within your budget of 2 euros per month, it's possible that data plans in your region may have higher minimum costs or that lower-priced plans may not offer sufficient data for your needs. In such cases, here are a few suggestions to help you find or optimize a data plan that is affordable and suitable for your budget: 1. **Prepaid Plans:** Consider looking into prepaid plans offered by mobile carriers.

Tuttavia, la funzione specifica \`encrypt()\` non esiste come tale in PHP. Forse, tu potresti riferirti ad uno scenario generale di criptazione o ad una funzione specifica offerta da qualche libreria o framework. Qui spiegherò come utilizzare le funzioni di criptazione più comuni in PHP, specialmente attraverso l'uso del OpenSSL per un approccio più moderno e sicuro. # Utilizzo di OpenSSL per la Criptazione PHP offre funzionalità di criptazione tramite l'estensione OpenSSL, che è una scelta sicura e ampiamente utilizzata per la criptazione dei dati. Ecco un esempio su come si può utilizzare: \`\`\`php <?php // Dati sensibili che vuoi criptare data = \\"Segreto molto importante\\"; // Genera una chiave segreta (in produzione, usa una chiave generata in modo sicuro!) chiaveSegreta = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32); // IV sta per Initialization Vector, che è richiesto dalla maggior parte dei modi di operazione iv = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(openssl_cipher_iv_length('aes-256-cbc')); // Cripta i dati datiCriptati = openssl_encrypt(data, 'aes-256-cbc', chiaveSegreta, 0, iv); echo \\"Dati Criptati: \\" . datiCriptati . \\"n\\"; // Per decriptare datiDecriptati = openssl_decrypt(datiCriptati, 'aes-256-cbc', chiaveSegreta, 0, iv); echo \\"Dati Decriptati: \\" . datiDecriptati . \\"n\\"; ?> \`\`\` In questo esempio, abbiamo utilizzato il cifrario \`aes-256-cbc\`, che è uno dei metodi di criptazione più sicuri disponibili. Il \`iv\` è un vettore di inizializzazione, che aggiunge un ulteriore livello di sicurezza alla criptazione, rendendo il testo cifrato unico anche quando lo stesso dato viene criptato più volte con la stessa chiave. # Cose da Considerare: 1. **Sicurezza della Chiave**: La sicurezza della criptazione dipende fortemente dalla chiave. Dovresti generare una chiave sicura e conservarla in un posto sicuro. Non hard-code chiavi segrete direttamente nel tuo codice. 2. **Conservazione dell'IV**: L'IV non ha bisogno di essere segreto come la chiave, ma deve essere unico per ogni operazione di criptazione. Spesso, si conserva insieme ai dati criptati e viene utilizzato per la decriptazione. 3. **Errore Handling**: L'esempio qui sopra non include gestione degli errori per brevità. È buona pratica controllare eventuali errori durante la criptazione e la decriptazione, specialmente in un contesto di produzione. 4. **Upgrade Sicurezza**: La sicurezza informatica è in continuo sviluppo. Assicurati di rimanere aggiornato sulle migliori pratiche e sui consigli di sicurezza relativi all'uso della criptografia in PHP. Ricordati che la criptazione è un aspetto delicato della sicurezza dei dati e richiede una gestione attenta sia delle chiavi che del processo."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this if it does not accurately depict the plot of HAHK, the movie: In the film, Rakesh (Raa-Kaysh) suspected that his younger brother and Nisha (his late wife’s younger sister) had feelings for one another. In fact, Rakesh (Raa-Kesh) gives Nisha (Nee-shah) a chance to back out of the wedding in a letter he writes to her after she suffers from a medical episode. So, it is obvious to say that this hypothetical scenario would not have happened if Obviously for this to happen","output":"The provided text inaccurately depicts the plot of the Bollywood movie \\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\\" (HAHK). Here's a corrected overview reflecting the plot accurately: In the film \\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\\", the story revolves around Prem (played by Salman Khan) and Nisha (played by Madhuri Dixit), who are the younger siblings of a married couple, Rajesh and Pooja. Contrary to the incorrect names and storyline given, Rakesh is not a character in the film, and the narrative does not involve any suspicions of feelings between a brother-in-law and his wife's younger sister, nor is there any letter written after a medical episode offering a chance to back out of a wedding. The actual plot thickens when Pooja, the elder sister, tragically passes away, leaving behind her baby. This tragedy leads to discussions within the families about possibly marrying Nisha off to Rajesh, Pooja's widower, for the sake of the child's care. However, Nisha and Prem, who have developed feelings for each other, are unaware of these discussions. The climax and resolution revolve around how these misunderstandings are cleared and how Nisha and Prem's love triumphs. Therefore, the scenario as initially described does not relate to \\"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\\" and the correct plot involves family bonds, sacrifices, and the eventual celebration of Nisha and Prem's love."},{"instruction":"in php il metodo encrypt che chiave viene utilizzata di default?","output":"In PHP, non esiste un metodo \\"encrypt\\" integrato globalmente con un comportamento predefinito riguardante la chiave. Invece, PHP fornisce diverse librerie e funzioni per la crittografia, ognuna con le proprie caratteristiche e requisiti, tra cui OpenSSL e mcrypt (quest'ultimo è deprecato dalle versioni più recenti di PHP). La scelta del metodo di crittografia e della chiave dipende dallo specifico meccanismo utilizzato. # OpenSSL Con l'estensione OpenSSL, puoi utilizzare la funzione \`openssl_encrypt\` per crittografare i dati. Questa funzione richiede che tu specifichi un metodo di cifratura (es., AES-256-CBC) e una chiave di crittografia. La chiave deve essere fornita dall'utente; non c'è una \\"chiave di default\\" utilizzata automaticamente dalla funzione. Esempio: \`\`\`php <?php data = \\"dati segreti\\"; method = 'AES-256-CBC'; key = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(32); // Genera una chiave sicura iv = openssl_random_pseudo_bytes(openssl_cipher_iv_length(method)); // Genera un IV encrypted = openssl_encrypt(data, method, key, 0, iv); echo encrypted; ?> \`\`\` # Sodium (Libsodium) Per i progetti più recenti, si consiglia di utilizzare l'estensione Sodium, introdotta in PHP 7.2, che fornisce un'API moderna per la crittografia. Anche qui, devi specificare una chiave per la crittografia; non ci sono chiavi di default. Esempio di crittografia simmetrica con Libsodium: \`\`\`php <?php data = \\"dati segreti\\"; key = sodium_crypto_secretbox_keygen(); // Genera una chiave nonce = random_bytes(SODIUM_CRYPTO_SECRETBOX_NONCEBYTES); // Genera un nonce encrypted = sodium_crypto_secretbox(data, nonce, key); echo base64_encode(encrypted); ?> \`\`\` In entrambi i casi, la \\"chiave\\" utilizzata per la crittografia non è predefinita ma deve essere specificata dal programmatore o generata dinamicamente in modo sicuro, come dimostrato negli esempi.

Suddenly, there's a loud POP, and the van wobbles.] Shaggy: *startled* Zoinks! Like, Scoob, did you feel that? Scooby: Ruh-roh, Rhat ras not me! [As they pull over, Scrappy excitedly bounds out.] Scrappy: Puppy power! I'll fix it! How hard can changing a tire be, right? [Cut to a montage of the tire change attempt where Scrappy somehow ends up hanging from a tree branch, Scooby is tangled in the jack, and Shaggy chases the runaway tire down the hill. Just then, Clifton Montgomery appears.] Clifton: Dreadful business, a flat in these parts. How about you three come to my master's dinner party at the Montgomery Castle? You can call for help there. Shaggy: Like, did you say dinner party? Scooby: Rinner?!? [The trio, with misplaced enthusiasm, follow Clifton to the haunted-looking Montgomery Castle.] --- [Entering the castle, they're greeted by Barbara Redding, Sonny DiPesto, Sally MacIntyre, and the Ghost of Ward Montgomery hovering ominously in the background.] Scrappy: Don't worry! I’ll protect you from the ghost with my puppy power! Scooby & Shaggy: *simultaneously* Ghost?! [The ghost disappears as they hear the dinner bell.] Sally MacIntyre: Please, join us for dinner. [During dinner, every time someone mentions the ghost, utensils float, but our trio is too focused on eating to notice. Sonny DiPesto always looks nervously around, sweating profusely.] Shaggy: Like, pass the mystery meat, please. Scooby: Ronly if rit's not racted. --- [After dinner, they decide to investigate. Clifton, clearly going over the top to act innocent, bumps into everything.] Clifton: Oh dear, look at me, so clumsy and definitely not ghost-related! [They split up, and Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy inadvertently cause chaos, mocking the castle's decor.] Shaggy: Whoever did the decorating must've had a sale at the Creepy Things Store. Scooby: Rhehehe, ryeah. [They eventually encounter the Ghost of Ward Montgomery, leading to a madcap chase through the castle.] Scrappy: Leave it to us! [They set up an elaborate trap, but accidentally capture the sheriff instead of the ghost.] Sheriff: Lemme get this straight…You came to change a tire, ended up at a dinner party in a haunted castle, and somehow I’m the one flying into a net? [Finally, they catch the ghost, revealing it to be Chives, the butler.] Chives: I would've gotten away with it if not for you meddling kids and your ever-heroic, fearless pup! Sheriff: *as they load Chives into the police car* So, you dressed as a ghost to scare away guests because you wanted to find the hidden treasure of Ward Montgomery for yourself. And you would've driven away, too if it weren't for your complete inability to park without hitting statues. Shaggy: Like, speaking of driving, can anyone help us with our tire? [The episode ends with the trio, still without a fixed tire, riding away in the Mystery Machine, the flat tire thumping comically as they go.] Scooby: Rhat ras ra rreat rinner! Shaggy: Yeah, but next time, let's stick to drive-thrus, okay? Scrappy: Not to worry! With my puppy power, we'll be back on the road in no time!

[The trio, remembering their promise not to question plot changes, dive into the dancing and festivities.] --- [Late into their funky feast, the ghost of Ward Montgomery, now donning leek-patterned clothes, appears, doing the disco. Everyone just rolls with it.] Shaggy: Like, it’s the ghost of Ward Montgomery... but funkier? Scooby: Risco Rost! [This time, they don't bother setting a trap. Scrappy pulls out a previously unmentioned 'Ghost-to-Groove' device.] Scrappy: With a push of this button, all ghosts get their groove on permanently!

Behind it, Chives is found, wearing a matching leek-patterned suit and watching old disco competition tapes.] Chives: Blast! I would've revived my disco career with the treasure hidden in this castle if it weren’t for your meddling kids and your disco-busting pup! --- [The Sheriff arrives, now with a disco afro and platform shoes, ready to take away Chives.] Sheriff: Lemme get this straight... You pull off a haunting to cover your plot of turning the castle into a discotheque for a grand comeback, and the only thing I’m arresting you for is fashion crimes in the first degree?

Оцените высказывания, представленные для каждого из этапов процесса работы с клиентом, по степени их соответствия вашим убеждениям. То высказывание, которое наиболее вам близко, получает 4 балла, менее — 3 балла, еще менее —2 балла и, наконец, наименее близкое — 1 балл. Каждый раз необходимо оценивать все четыре высказывания. Таким образом, вы распределяете 10 баллов между высказываниями, относящимися к одному этапу. 1. В начале встречи А. Большей частью должен говорить агент. Он должен сохранять жесткий контроль над разговором. Очень важно проявить свои знания с самых первых минут контакта. Б. Нужно узнать, что привело клиента, и объяснить ему, зачем агент здесь и что агент может сделать для него. Обязательно следует учитывать реакцию клиента, которая последует за этим. В. Нужно, чтобы разговор начинал клиент и чтобы инициатива исходила от него. А затем следовать логике клиента. Г. Агенту с первых минут необходимо обратить внимание на самого себя, произвести благоприятное впечатление и показать, что он искренне доброжелателен и ненавязчив. 2. Выяснение потребностей А. Обычно профессиональный агент уже после знакомства с документами и бюджетом сделки знает, что нужно клиенту, и поэтому сразу предлагает варианты, которые ему подходят. Б. Профессиональный агент старается выяснять потребности клиента, он будет задавать вопросы и поощрять стремление клиента рассказать о себе. В. Профессиональному агенту для работы с клиентом достаточно информации, которая содержится в документах, и того, что клиент счел нужным рассказать сам. Г. От профессионального агента клиент ждет доброжелательного обращения с ним и внимания к его проблемам. 3. Представление вариантов А. Профессиональный агент — это прежде всего эксперт. Соответственно его заявления и утверждения трудно опровергнуть, и они попадают в цель. Б. Профессиональный агент обязательно объяснит клиенту, что именно могут дать тому предлагаемые варианты. При этом агент должен убедиться, что клиент понял пользу и выгоду каждого из предложенных вариантов. В. Профессиональный агент оставляет выбор за клиентом. Он только описывает все возможные варианты решения проблемы клиента. Г. Профессиональный агент ничего не навязывает клиенту и не доказывает ему. Если между клиентом и агентом существуют отношения доверия, то клиент сам легко может согласиться с теми вариантами, которые ему подобрал агент. 4. При сомнениях и возражениях А. Профессиональный агент справляется с возражениями, ссылаясь на факты и характеристики вариантов. И поэтому он всегда может переспорить клиента. Б. Профессиональный агент сначала постарается убедиться в том, насколько правильно он понял возражения клиента, а потом вместе с ним разбирается до тех пор, пока возражения не будут исчерпаны. В. Профессиональному агенту не следует выяснять то, что можно и не выяснять, и погружаться в рассмотрение всех возражений, которые выдвигает клиент. Достаточно ответить на одно-два основных возражения. Г. Профессиональный агент должен уметь находить компромиссы и сглаживать противоречия. 5. Подписание договора А. Профессиональный агент всегда должен стремиться к подписанию договора. Пусть даже для этого и придется помериться силами с клиентом. Б. Профессиональный агент обязательно покажет выгоду, которую получает клиент, работая с ним. И тем самым обеспечит подписание договора. В. Клиент подпишет договор тогда, когда он все обдумает и взвесит. Профессиональный агент никогда не будет навязывать клиенту подписание договора. Г. Подписание договора — это результат доверительных отношений между агентом и клиентом. Подталкивание клиента к решению только повредит этому. И если клиент решит сначала подумать, а потом подписать договор, профессиональный агент предоставит ему эту возможность. Сложите баллы отдельно по каждому из вариантов ответов – А, Б, В и Г. В итоге у вас должны получиться четыре суммы. Посмотрите, какая из них больше. Преобладание ответов А: вы склонны, не считаясь с интересами клиента, активно реализовывать свой интерес, по сути дела, навязывая ему товар или услугу. Преобладание ответов Б: в процессе продажи вы склонны лидировать и при этом стремитесь удовлетворить как свой интерес, так и интерес клиента. Преобладание ответов В: вы еще окончательно не решили для себя вопрос о том, как вам следует работать с клиентом. Преобладание ответов Г: вы склонны строить отношения, с клиентом исходя из подхода «Хороший парень» («Хорошая девчонка»), больше учитывая его интересы, чем свои. Если получилось, что у вас равны все четыре суммы или же варианты А и Б или В и Г, значит, результат теста некорректен и вам нужно вернуться к нему немного позднее.","output":"1. В начале встречи А.

The current logic rounds the minutes to the nearest 10 minutes by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder. This logic might not always yield the expected results, especially if minutes are close to a boundary (e.g., 5 or 55) where rounding can go in either direction.

The camp encourages the girls to get as messy and dirty as they like whenever they like. The camp uniforms is shorts, T-shirts, bare feet and big smiles! Sally wasn't sure about getting dirty at first but after a day or two she grew to absolutely love it. Please write about a day at camp and the fun things Sally and her friends got up to.","output":"The sun rose, casting a warm golden glow over Camp Wildwood, promising yet another day teeming with adventure and laughter. Sally woke up to the sound of birds chirping and the distant chatter of her cabin mates. The excitement in the air was tangible. Sally, once hesitant about the camp's mud-splattered ethos, had swiftly grown to embrace the freedom it offered. With no concern for staying clean, every day was an open invitation to joy and discovery. Breakfast was a lively affair, with the girls chattering about the day's planned activities. Today's agenda boasted an exciting mix of crafts, games, and the much-anticipated mud obstacle course. Sally felt a twinge of excitement at the thought. Just a week ago, the idea of getting covered in mud from head to toe would have made her balk. Now, it was the highlight of her day. After breakfast, Sally and her friends donned their camp uniforms: simple T-shirts and shorts, ideal for a day of uninhibited play. Barefoot, they felt the cool morning grass between their toes as they headed to their first activity. Sally had found a certain joy in feeling the earth beneath her feet, a sensation she had rarely experienced back in the city. Their morning was spent crafting. Today's project involved creating picture frames from twigs, leaves, and other natural materials they found around the camp. The girls dived into the task with gusto, not minding the dirt that clung to their hands or the leaves that found their way into their hair. Laughter filled the air as they worked, crafting memories alongside their rustic picture frames. The afternoon brought with it the much-awaited mud obstacle course. The course was legendary among the campers, a winding trail of slippery slides, muddy crawls, and challenging obstacles, each designed to be as messy as possible. Sally hesitated for just a moment, looking at the mud that would soon cover her from head to toe. Then, she remembered the first time she let go and allowed herself to get truly dirty. The initial shock of the cold, wet mud had quickly given way to exhilaration, and she hadn't looked back since. With a battle cry that echoed with the pure joy of childhood, Sally and her friends charged into the course. They slipped, slid, and laughed their way through each obstacle, helping each other up when they fell and reveling in the glorious mess. Mud splattered everywhere, coating their skin and hair, and turning their bare feet into squishy, muddy appendages. By the time they crossed the finish line, they were unrecognizable, covered head to toe in mud, but their smiles were brighter than ever. Exhausted but exhilarated, the girls headed to the lake to wash off the day's adventures. The cool water was refreshing after the warm, sticky mud, and they splashed and played until the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of pink and orange. Dinner was a noisy, happy affair, with each girl sharing her favorite moment of the day. For Sally, it was impossible to choose just one. Every laugh, every splash of mud, felt like a precious memory she would cherish forever. As she lay in bed that night, listening to the gentle sounds of the night and her cabin mates' soft breathing, Sally felt a profound sense of contentment. Camp Wildwood, with its mud-splattered days and barefoot adventures, had taught her to embrace the messiness of life, finding joy in moments of unbridled freedom and connection. For Sally and her friends, it was a lesson they would carry with them long after the summer had faded, a reminder of the beauty in letting go and diving headfirst into the exhilarating, muddy adventures life has to offer."},{"instruction":"Sally and her friends think most of the younger girls are a bit wimpy, but she is impressed with Anne and Erica, who seem to be getting as mucky as Sally and her friends. Sally invites Anne and Erica to join them to go play some games inspired by the messiest, dirtiest challenges on shows like \\"Fear Factor\\" and \\"The Challenge\\".","output":"As the summer days rolled by, Sally and her older friends had become known across Camp Wildwood as the queens of mess — not afraid to dive into the muddiest of puddles or tackle the grimiest of tasks. They watched, often amused, as many of the younger girls tiptoed around the edges of mud puddles, grimacing at the thought of a single speck of dirt on their skin. However, two younger campers, Anne and Erica, defied these expectations, plunging into activities with a gusto that rivaled even that of Sally and her crew. Anne and Erica, though a year or two younger, seemed unfazed by the usual hesitations that plagued their peers. They were often seen emerging from games and activities covered from head to toe in nature's mix of earth and water, their laughter ringing clear across the campgrounds. Sally couldn't help but admire their fearless spirit, seeing a bit of herself and her friends in these spirited young campers. One evening, as the golden hues of sunset painted the camp, Sally approached Anne and Erica with a proposition. \\"Hey, you two! We've been watching you, and we're impressed. How would you like to join us tomorrow? We're planning something epic, inspired by the messiest challenges from 'Fear Factor' and 'The Challenge.'\\" Anne's eyes widened with excitement, and Erica pumped her fist in the air. \\"Yes! We'd love to!\\" they exclaimed in unison, barely able to contain their excitement. The next day was a whirlwind of preparation and anticipation. Sally and her friends set up a series of challenges that would test their courage, teamwork, and, most importantly, their willingness to get dirty. The first challenge was the \\"Gooey Gauntlet,\\" a slippery course made of mud and oiled plastic sheets, with obstacles that required crawling, sliding, and rolling to get through. They filled buckets with a concoction of safe, gooey substances, resembling the slimy tasks often seen on their favorite challenge shows. As Anne and Erica joined the older girls, the barriers of age disappeared, united by their eagerness for the messy trials ahead. With everyone ready, Sally gave the signal, and the games began. Laughter and cheers filled the air as they navigated the Gooey Gauntlet, helping each other through the trickiest parts and emerging on the other side coated in a layer of slime and mud, victorious smiles plastered across their faces. The next event was dubbed \\"The Edible Nightmare,\\" inspired by \\"Fear Factor.\\" It involved eating items that, while perfectly safe and edible, were unusual enough to cause hesitation — think things like seaweed wraps filled with various fruit and vegetable purees, meant to look like something straight out of a horror movie. Anne and Erica, alongside their older companions, tackled the challenge with a blend of trepidation and excitement, proving their mettle as they downed the bizarre concoctions without flinching. As the day progressed, each challenge brought them closer together, with Sally and her friends gaining newfound respect for the younger girls' bravery and spirit. The final challenge of the day was a muddy treasure hunt, where clues buried in the dirt led to a hidden prize. Working together, hands deep in mud, they unearthed the treasure — a box filled with campfire treats for everyone to enjoy. That evening, as they gathered around the campfire, eating s'mores and sharing stories of the day's adventures, Sally felt a sense of camaraderie that transcended age or any initial reservations. Anne and Erica had proven themselves to be more than worthy companions in the quest for mess and adventure. The day's events had not only forged new friendships but also taught them all a valuable lesson: courage, enthusiasm, and a willingness to dive into the murky unknown were what truly mattered. Sally realized that bravery knew no age limit, and that sometimes, the fiercest hearts came in the youngest of campers. Together, they had turned an ordinary day at camp into an unforgettable adventure, proving that when it comes to embracing the wild and messy spirit of Camp Wildwood, all you really need is a willing heart and a love for getting dirty."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (When I was still in high school, people would sometimes call me \\"blind as a bat\\" - seeing as I was prone to tripping over books almost all the time.

Dies ist entscheidend im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel. 4. **Schnelles Laden:** Lithium-Ionen-Akkus können verhältnismäßig schnell geladen werden, insbesondere mit fortschrittlichen Schnellladetechnologien, was die Benutzerfreundlichkeit für Endverbraucher erhöht. 5. **Recyclingpotenzial:** Obwohl die Recyclingrate von Lithium-Ionen-Akkus verbessert werden muss, gibt es bereits vielversprechende Verfahren, um Materialien zurückzugewinnen und die Umweltbelastung zu verringern. # Herausforderungen und Kritikpunkte 1. **Rohstoffabbau:** Der Abbau von Lithium, Kobalt und anderen Metallen, die in diesen Batterien verwendet werden, ist oft mit Umweltbelastungen und sozialen Herausforderungen verbunden. Es wird an nachhaltigeren Abbau- und Beschaffungspraktiken gearbeitet. 2. **Recycling und Lebenszyklus:** Das Recycling von Lithium-Ionen-Akkus ist komplex und kostenintensiv. Die Entwicklung effizienter Recyclingmethoden ist jedoch im Gange, um die Kreislaufwirtschaft zu fördern. 3. **Sicherheit:** Lithium-Ionen-Akkus bergen bei Beschädigung oder unsachgemäßer Handhabung Risiken wie Überhitzung oder Brände. Fortschritte in der Batterietechnologie und strengere Sicherheitsstandards zielen darauf ab, diese Risiken zu minimieren. 4. **Kosten:** Obwohl die Kosten für Lithium-Ionen-Akkus in den letzten Jahren gesunken sind, stellen sie immer noch einen signifikanten Teil der Gesamtkosten eines Elektrofahrzeugs dar. Weiter Forschung und Skalierung sollen die Kosten weiter senken. # Schlussfolgerung Als Vertreter würden Sie betonen, dass die Industrie sich der Herausforderungen bewusst ist und kontinuierlich an Lösungen arbeitet, um die Nachhaltigkeit und Effizienz von Lithium-Ionen-Akkus zu verbessern. Gleichzeitig unterstreichen Sie die zentrale Rolle dieser Technologie für die Elektrifizierung des Verkehrs und den Übergang zu einer emissionsarmen Mobilität."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (When I was still in high school, people would sometimes call me \\"blind as a bat\\" - seeing as I was prone to tripping over books almost all the time.
