This implies that as x becomes more negative (less than -1), the expression ax - b remains positive, suggesting that a < 0 (since a positive a would make ax - b negative for sufficiently negative x). 2. Given the boundary of the solution set is at x = -1, substituting x = -1 into the inequality gives us a(-1) - b = -a - b > 0, which simplifies to -a - b = 0. Therefore, we have b = -a.

Then the conditional probabilities P(A|B) and P(B|A) are respectively ( ).","output":"First, analyze the problem to understand the total number of outcomes and the outcomes that correspond to events A and B. - Total outcomes when rolling three dice are 6 times 6 times 6 = 216. - Event A: \\"The three numbers are all different.\\" There are 6 text{ (first die)} times 5 text{ (second die, different from the first)} times 4 text{ (third die, different from the first two}) = 6 times 5 times 4 = 120 outcomes that satisfy this condition. - Event B: \\"At least one 1 is rolled.\\" There are three scenarios for a 1 to appear on a die: 1 on the first die, 1 on the second, or 1 on the third. Each scenario has 1 times 6 times 6 = 36 outcomes, but since rolling a 1 on any two dice would be counted twice, and all three being 1 is counted three times, we need to subtract these overlaps. There are 3 times 5 times 5 = 75 outcomes with no 1s. So, number of outcomes for at least one 1 is 216 - 75 = 141. Next, calculate the conditional probabilities: - P(A|B): The probability that the three numbers are all different given that at least one die shows a 1. We need to count how many outcomes satisfy both A and B. Since we already have one die showing a 1, there are 5 possibilities for the second die and 4 possibilities for the third die, leading to 5 times 4 = 20 outcomes for each scenario of getting a 1. There are 3 scenarios where a single die shows a 1, so there are 20 times 3 = 60 outcomes satisfying both A and B. Hence, P(A|B) = frac{60}{141}. - P(B|A): The probability that at least one die shows a 1 given that the three numbers are all different. We know that when the three numbers are all different (120 outcomes), there are 60 outcomes with at least one 1 (since 1 can take any of the three different positions). Therefore, P(B|A) = frac{60}{120} = frac{1}{2}. Verify that event B indeed has 141 outcomes: We know that the total number of outcomes is 216. Event B's complement is \\"no 1 is rolled,\\" which has 5 times 5 times 5 = 125 outcomes. Therefore, 216 (total outcomes) - 125 (no 1 outcomes) = 91, which is actually the number of outcomes for event B, indicating there was an error in the initial computation for event B. Let's correct this: Event B: \\"At least one 1 is rolled.\\" We have 216 text{ (total outcomes)} - 125 text{ (outcomes with no 1)} = 91 outcomes that satisfy this condition. Now we can correctly calculate P(A|B) = frac{60}{91}.

We also know there are 28 non-vegan cupcakes that contain gluten. Since these 28 are not gluten-free, they are not part of the 40 gluten-free cupcakes.  To find out how many vegan cupcakes are gluten-free, we can subtract the non-vegan gluten cupcakes from the total gluten-free cupcakes: 40 (gluten-free cupcakes) - 28 (non-vegan gluten cupcakes) = 12 vegan gluten-free cupcakes. Now we have the number of vegan gluten-free cupcakes (12) and the total number of vegan cupcakes (24). To find the ratio of vegan gluten-free cupcakes to the total number of vegan cupcakes, we divide the number of vegan gluten-free cupcakes by the total number of vegan cupcakes: 12 (vegan gluten-free cupcakes) / 24 (total vegan cupcakes) = 1/2.

Since m_1 and m_2 both intersect l_1, they lie in the plane defined by l_1 (because through a line and a point not on the line, there is a unique plane). This shared plane is the plane of intersection with l_1. 2. Similarly, since m_1 and m_2 both intersect l_2, they also lie in the plane defined by l_2. This is a second plane of intersection with l_2. 3. Because l_1 and l_2 are skew, they do not lie on the same plane. Consequently, the fact that m_1 and m_2 intersect both l_1 and l_2 means that they must lie at the intersection of the two distinct planes, which is a single line. 4. Therefore, m_1 and m_2 must be either coincident (the same line) or intersect at a point. 5.

For the sum of binomial coefficients, any (a + b)^n expansion's coefficients sum to 2^n.

Since this is a transcendental equation (an equation involving transcendental functions), it's often not easily solvable by algebraic methods. Instead, let's investigate the behavior of the functions visually and analytically.  First, consider the function g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4. This is a quadratic with a vertex form of (x - 2)^2, implying the vertex of the parabola is at (2, 0) and it opens upwards since the coefficient of x^2 is positive.

However, it increases much slower than any polynomial function after a certain point. Given that the vertex of g(x) is at (2, 0) and the parabola opens upwards, while the logarithmic function passes through (1, 0) and increases slowly, we can deduce that the two graphs must intersect at two points: close to the y-axis where the logarithmic function starts increasing from -infty and crosses the parabola before it reaches its vertex, and on the right side where x > 2, as the parabola grows faster than the logarithm.

This is equivalent to showing that:    [    (180^circ - angle AED) + (180^circ - angle BEC) = 180^circ    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    angle AED + angle BEC = 180^circ    ] 4. **Concyclic Points**: Let ( P ) be a point on line ( AB ) such that ( AE = PE ). Since ( angle EPB = 180^circ - angle EAB ) and ( angle EAB = angle ECB ), it follows that:    [    angle EPB = 180^circ - angle ECB    ]    Therefore, points ( B, C, E, P ) are concyclic. 5. **Translation Argument**: Take point ( F ) such that ( CF parallel DE ) and ( AE parallel BF ). This is a translation of triangle ( AED ) to side ( BC ). We have ( BF = AE = PE ) and:    [    angle FBP = angle FBA = angle EAB = angle EAP = angle APE = angle BPE    ]    Thus, points ( B, P, E, F ) form an isosceles trapezoid, and hence they are concyclic. 6. **Conclusion**: Since ( angle BEC = 180^circ - angle CFB = 180^circ - angle DEA ), the circumcenters of triangles ( ABE ), ( BCE ), ( CDE ), and ( DAE ) are concyclic.

Given the equations of a circle (x^2 + y^2 = R^2) with radius (R > 0) and the curve (lvert|x| - |y|rvert = 1), determine (R) such that their intersection points form the vertices of a regular polygon.    2. First, plot (lvert|x| - |y|rvert = 1) in the first quadrant:    - When (x geq 0, y geq 0), the solutions to (lvert|x| - |y|rvert = 1) are the lines (x - y = 1) and (y - x = 1). 3. By considering symmetry about the x-axis and y-axis, we obtain the complete shape covered by (lvert|x| - |y|rvert = 1), which forms a rotated square around the origin with vertices along these axes. 4. The intersection of (lvert|x| - |y|rvert = 1) with the circle (x^2 + y^2 = R^2) creates two possible regular polygons:    - A regular square (i.e., a regular quadrilateral)    - A regular octagon (i.e., a regular eight-sided polygon) 5. If it forms a square, the radius (R) from the center (origin) to any vertex is 1. This is evident since the vertices of the square touch the circle at points distance exactly 1 from the origin.    - Therefore, in the case of a square, (R = 1). 6. If it forms an octagon, we need to find (R).    - A regular octagon inscribed in a circle has vertices touching the circle such that the distance from the center to a vertex is the radius (R).    - The side length (s) of the octagon touching sides to distance 1 vertically and horizontally gives us (s = sqrt{2}). 7. The radius (R) for the octagon can be calculated by finding the distance from the center to a vertex of the octagon:    - Consider one vertex ((x, y) = (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, 1 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2})), which lies on the boundary of the octagon.    - Using the distance formula:      [      R = sqrt{left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)^2 + left(1 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)^2}      ]    - Simplifying inside the square root:      [      R = sqrt{frac{2}{4} + left(1 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)^2}      ]      [      R = sqrt{frac{2}{4} + 1 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + frac{2}{4}}      ]      [      R = sqrt{frac{2}{4} + frac{2}{4} + 1 + sqrt{2}}      ]      [      R = sqrt{1 + sqrt{2} + 1} = sqrt{2 + 2sqrt{2}}      ] 8.

Specifically, we will examine the intervals they fall into. 4. **Intervals Definition:**    Consider a natural number (k). We seek the integer pairs ((M, N)) such that:    [    Ma < k < (M+1)a quad text{and} quad Nb < k < (N+1)b    ]    Since (a) and (b) are irrational, the inequalities are strict. 5. **Counting Inequality Solution:**    There are exactly (M) values of ( leftlfloor ma rightrfloor ) less than (k) when (m = 1, 2, ldots, M). Similarly, there are exactly (N) values of ( leftlfloor nb rightrfloor ) less than (k) when (n = 1, 2, ldots, N). 6. **Count Relationship:**    The number of values less than (k) of the form (leftlfloor ma rightrfloor) and (leftlfloor nb rightrfloor) is:    [    M + N     ] 7. **Condition Update:**    Next, we divide the inequalities (k - (M+1)a < 0) and (k - (N+1)b < 0) by (a) and (b) accordingly, and then add them:    [    M < frac{k}{a} - 1 quad text{and} quad N < frac{k}{b} - 1    ]    Adding these inequalities results in:    [    M + N < frac{k}{a} + frac{k}{b} - 2     ] 8. **Given Equation Substitution:**    Using the given condition (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1):    [    frac{k}{a} + frac{k}{b} = k    ]    Thus:    [    M + N < k - 2    ] 9. **Consequence and Exact Match:**    The count (k) shows that for the boundaries defined by irrationality, exactly one count, (M+N = k - 1), fits correctly into sorting numbers of type ([ma]) and ([nb]) on the interval ((k-1, k)). Thus proving:    [    M + N = k-1    ] 10. **Conclusion:**    Based on the count, we can conclude:    - For every natural number (k), exactly one such number is counted within ([ma]) and ([nb]) for the specific range defined.

Therefore, f(0) = f(0) + f(0) Rightarrow f(0) = 0. Next, set y = -x. Then, we have f(x) + f(-x) = f(x - x) = f(0) = 0. This implies f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, f(x) is an odd function. (ii) Now, we will prove that f(x) is a monotonically increasing function on [-2, 2]. Let's consider -2 le x_1 < x_2 le 2. This means x_2 - x_1 > 0, which implies f(x_2 - x_1) > 0 because f is positive for positive arguments. Since f(x) is an odd function on [-2, 2], it follows that: [f(x_2) - f(x_1) = f(x_2) + f(-x_1) = f(x_2 + (-x_1)) = f(x_2 - x_1) > 0,] which shows that f(x_2) > f(x_1). Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [-2, 2]. Since f is odd and monotonically increasing, and because f(1) = 3, then f(-1) = -3. The function reaches its maximum when x=2 and minimum when x=-2. Because f is monotonically increasing, f(2) must be the maximum value, and similarly, f(-2) must be the minimum value. By the property that f(x) is odd, we have f(-2) = -f(2). Since we know that f(1) = 3, it is reasonable to assume that f(2) will be at least 3. To find f(2), let’s use the given functional equation: [f(2) = f(1 + 1) = f(1) + f(1) = 3 + 3 = 6.] Thus, f(2) = 6 and f(-2)=-f(2) = -6.

If |AB|=2sqrt{3}, then the area of circle C is ____.","output":"To solve this problem, we start by identifying the center and radius of the circle C: x^{2}+y^{2}-2ay-2=0. The center of this circle is obtained by completing the square for x and y terms, but since there's no x term that shifts the center horizontally, the center is directly on the y-axis, thus at (0,a). The constant term in the circle's equation helps us find the radius. The general form of a circle's equation is (x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. Comparing this with our circle's equation, we see that the radius squared, r^{2}, must account for both the -2ay term and the constant term -2. Thus, we have r^{2} = a^{2} + 2 after moving all terms to one side and completing the square for the y term, which gives us the radius as sqrt{a^{2}+2}. Given that the line y=x+2a intersects the circle at points A and B with a distance |AB|=2sqrt{3}, we can use the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the line to find a relationship involving a. The distance d from a point (x_0,y_0) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by d=frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. Applying this formula to our scenario where the center of the circle is (0,a) and the line is y=x+2a (which can be rewritten as -x+y-2a=0 for clarity), we find that d=frac{|-0+a-2a|}{sqrt{(-1)^2+(1)^2}}=frac{|-a|}{sqrt{2}}=sqrt{a^{2}-1}, given the geometric relationship between the radius, the distance d, and half the chord length |AB|/2. Solving frac{|a|}{sqrt{2}}=sqrt{a^{2}-1}, we square both sides to eliminate the square root, leading to frac{a^{2}}{2}=a^{2}-1. Rearranging terms gives us a^{2}=2.  Knowing a^{2}=2, we substitute back into our expression for the radius r=sqrt{a^{2}+2} to find r=sqrt{2+2}=sqrt{4}=2. Finally, the area S of a circle with radius r is given by S=pi r^{2}. Substituting r=2 into this formula, we find S=pi(2)^{2}=4pi.

To verify that triangle DEF is indeed equilateral, we should ensure that DF = DE = EF. 3. **Distance Calculations Using Coordinate Geometry:**    Using the Law of Cosines in triangle DEF:    [    DF^2 = x^2 + left(1 - frac{x}{2}right)^2 - 2x left(1 - frac{x}{2}right) cos(60^circ)    ]    [    DF^2 = x^2 + left(1 - frac{x}{2}right)^2 - frac{x (2 - x)}{2}    ]    [    DF^2 = x^2 + 1 - x + frac{x^2}{4} - left(frac{2x - x^2}{2}right)    ]    [    DF^2 = x^2 + 1 - x + frac{x^2}{4} - x + frac{x^2}{2}    ]    [    DF^2 = frac{7}{4} x^2 - x + 1    ]    Similarly, for DE:    [    DE^2 = (1 - x)^2 + left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x right)^2    ]    [    DE^2 = (1 - x)^2 + frac{3}{4} x^2    ]    [    DE^2 = 1 - 2x + x^2 + frac{3}{4} x^2    ]    [    DE^2 = 1 - 2x + frac{7}{4} x^2    ]    And for EF:    [    EF^2 = left(sqrt{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x right)^2 + left(1 + frac{x}{2} right)^2 - 2 left(sqrt{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x right)left(1 + frac{x}{2} right) cos(30^circ)    ]    [    EF^2 = 3 - 3x + frac{3 x^2}{4} + 1 + x + frac{x^2}{4} - x - frac{x^2}{2}    ]    [    EF^2 = 3 + 1 + frac{7}{4} x^2 - frac{3x}{2}    ]    [    EF^2 = frac{7}{4} x^2 + 1 - x    ]    Thus:    [     DF = DE = EF = sqrt{frac{7}{4} x^2 - x + 1}    ] 4. **Optimization for Minimum Length:**    The side length a of the equilateral triangle triangle DEF would be minimized when DF^2 is minimized. Completing the square:    [    DF^2 = DE^2 = EF^2 = frac{7}{4} x^2 - 2x + 1    ]    [    DF^2 = frac{7}{4} left(x - frac{4}{7} right)^2 + frac{3}{7}    ]    This is minimized when x = frac{4}{7}. 5. **Calculating the Minimum Side Length:**    [    a^2 = frac{3}{7}    ]    Therefore, the minimum side length a is:    [    a = sqrt{frac{3}{7}} = frac{sqrt{21}}{7}    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    The minimum value of the longest side of an inscribed equilateral triangle in triangle ABC is boxed{frac{1}{7} sqrt{21}}."},{"instruction":"Carina has 115 ounces of coffee divided into 5 and 10ounce packages.

Therefore, we have:    [ 2^2 = 4 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2. ]    The only solution in non-negative integers is:    [ (a, b, c, d) = (1, 1, 1, 1) ]    and its permutations.

The final answer is ( boxed{ (2^x, 0, 0, 0), (2^x, 2^x, 0, 0), (2^x, 2^x, 2^x, 2^x) } ) and their permutations where (x in mathbb{Z}^0)."},{"instruction":"An ellipse competition II question. Given a line e passing through the center of a circle, draw tangents from an external point P on e to the circle and find the angle bisectors of these tangents and e. What is the locus of the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from the center of the circle to these angle bisectors as point P moves along the portion of e outside the circle?","output":"1. **Initial Set-Up and Definitions:**    Consider a circle with center O and an external point P such that point P lies on the line e. From point P, draw tangents t_1 and t_2 to the circle, touching the circle at points T_1 and T_2 respectively. Let the angle bisectors of the angles formed between the tangents and line e be denoted as f_1 and f_2. 2. **Projection on Angle Bisector f_1 and Geometry Analysis:**    - Let M be the foot of the perpendicular from the center O to the angle bisector f_1.    - Let M_1 be the projection of M onto the line e.    - Similarly, let M_2 be the projection of M onto the tangent t_1.    By construction, the distances are equal: M M_1 = M M_2. 3. **Parallel Tangents and Geometric Relationships:**    - Let g be the tangent to the circle parallel to line e on the same side as point M.    - This tangent g touches the circle at point O' such that (OO' perp e). 4. **Angle Bisector Theorem Application:**    - Consider triangles OOP and OMT_1.    - By geometric properties and symmetries, angle O'OT_1 = angle OPM since the sides of these triangles are perpendicular.    - Thus, line OM bisects angle O'O T_1 . 5. **Perpendicular Distances and Equalities:**    - Point M is equidistant from lines t_1 and g, confirming that M lies on a line parallel to e.    - Therefore, MM_{1} = MM_{3} where M_{3} is the projection of M on g.    - As MM_{3} perp g and g parallel e, it follows MM_{3} perp e. Thus, the distance from M to e is constant and equals frac{r}{2}. 6. **Exploration of Various Positions of P:**    - If P is at point A on e such that OA = r, the tangent PT_1 is perpendicular to e.     - Let M' be the projection of O on the angle bisector in this setup. Since angle OM'A = 45^circ, M''s distance from e is frac{r}{2}.    - As P approaches infinity along e, the bisector angle reduces to 0, making M approach the midpoint of OO', and so on. 7. **Summary of the Geometric Loci:**    - Therefore, as P moves along e, point M traces out a line parallel to e and at a distance frac{r}{2} from it.    - These positions are a segment of the line d_1 parallel to e at the requisite distance. 8. **Considering Second Angle Bisector f_2:**    - Define point N as the projection of O on angle bisector f_2.    - The same distance argument applies, so N also traces out a parallel line to e at distance frac{r}{2}, referred to as d_2, symmetric to d_1 about e. 9. **Complete Geometric Locus:**    - Combining all the described segments, the total geometric locus of the projections of O onto the angle bisectors f_1 and f_2 as P moves along e forms two parallel lines d_1 and d_2.    - Point M describes one part while point N describes the symmetric counterpart. # Conclusion:    The geometric locus of the feet of the perpendiculars from the center O of the circle to the angle bisectors of the angles between the tangents from point P and the line e is a pair of parallel lines.

Additionally, under parallel projection, the parallelism of lines is preserved. 4. **Construction Based on Given Properties:**    Therefore, we proceed with the following construction:        a. Construct two parallel segments, ending on the given image of the circle.        b.

Prove that the sum of any sequence of 26 different letters of the English alphabet with the sequence of letters representing the alphabet itself contains at least two identical letters.","output":"1. **Understanding the problem statement:**     We need to show that when we sum any sequence of 26 different letters from the English alphabet with another such sequence, we will end up with a sequence that contains at least two identical letters. 2. **Sum of letters notion:**    Let’s label the letters of the English alphabet by their positions:    - (A = 1), (B = 2), ..., (Z = 26).    For any letter (X), let ( text{pos}(X) ) denote its position in the alphabet.  3. **Summing sequences:**    When we sum two sequences of letters, each position in the resulting sequence is determined by the combined sum of corresponding letters from the original sequences. Mathematically, if we have two sequences (text{Seq1}) and (text{Seq2}) of 26 letters each, their sum (text{Seq}) at each index (i) can be given by:    [    text{seq}_i = (text{pos}(text{seq1}_i) + text{pos}(text{seq2}_i)) mod 26    ] 4. **Sum of positions of the alphabet:**    The sum of the positions of all 26 letters in the alphabet is:    [    1 + 2 + 3 + dots + 26 = frac{26 times (26 + 1)}{2} = 13 times 27 = 351    ] 5. **Proof by contradiction:**    Assume that the sum sequence (text{Seq}) formed by summing (text{Seq1}) and (text{Seq2}) contains all distinct letters of the alphabet. 6. **Analysis of modulo properties:**    If (text{Seq}) contains all distinct alphabet letters, their positions’ sum should be congruent to the sum of positions of the distinct letters in the alphabet:    [    1 + 2 + dots + 26 equiv 351 mod 26    ]    Note that:    [    351 mod 26 = 13    ]    This means the sum modulo 26 has a remainder of 13. 7. **Evaluating the sum:**    However, the sum (text{pos}(text{seq1}_i) + text{pos}(text{seq2}_i)) for each (i) should also aggregate to something that, when taken modulo 26, leads to the same individual remainders, keeping them distinct across all positions. 8. **Invariant discrepancy:**    As we already derived, the sum:    [    351 mod 26 equiv 13    ]    There exists a discrepancy. Having distinct sums results in these positions potentially overlapping, which violates the distinctness condition by programs of positional addition modulo properties. 9. **Conclusion:**    This contradiction implies it is impossible to have two alphabet sequences each of 26 letters sum to yield a sequence of 26 unique letters.

Finally, we'll subtract the arrangements where Teams A and B are at the same site from the total arrangements for each case. **Case 1: Distribution of 1, 1, and 4 Teams** - First, we choose 1 team for site B, 1 team for site C, and the remaining 4 teams for site A.

Since line AB is perpendicular to x+y=1, we have a slope of k = -1. We must then solve the system of equations: begin{align*} y & = -x + b  y^2 & = 2px  end{align*} This leads to the quadratic equation x^2 + (2b - 2p)x + b^2 = 0. Obtaining the discriminant of the quadratic, we find that Delta = 4p(p - 2b) > 0, which implies p > 2b (1). By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum and product of the roots are x_1 + x_2 = -(2b - 2p) = 2p - 2b and x_1x_2 = b^2 respectively. Since C is the midpoint, its x-coordinate is frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = p - b. Plugging this into y = -x + b provides us with the coordinate for C as C(p - b, p). This point also lies on x + y = 1, which results in b = 2p - 1 (2). Combining equations (1) and (2), we get p < frac{2}{3}.

Let ( X ) be the fourth vertex of the rectangle ( APBX ), where [ O P^{2}+O X^{2}=O A^{2}+O B^{2}, quad O P^{2}+O Q^{2}=O X^{2}+O C^{2} ] We deduce that: [  O Q^{2}=O A^{2}+O B^{2}+O C^{2}-2 O P^{2}=3 r^{2}-2 O P^{2}=constant.  ] This implies that the point ( Q ) lies on a sphere with center ( O ) and radius ( r_{1}=sqrt{3r^{2}-2O P^{2}}>r ).

Consider the intersection of the spheres ( S ) (with center ( O ) and radius ( r )) and another sphere with the diameter ( PQ ). Let this intersection point be ( C ) on the plane ( OPQ ) and complete the rectangle ( PQCX ). From the auxiliary theorem, we get: [  O X^{2}=O Q^{2}+O P^{2}-O C^{2}=2r^{2}-O P^{2}>r^{2},  ] indicating that point ( X ) lies outside the sphere ( S ). Thus, in the perpendicular plane at ( P ) to the segment ( CP ), there are two points, say ( B ) and the fourth vertex ( A ), such that ( APX ) forms a rectangle.

To solve this, we first need to understand the definition of (phi^{!}(n)), which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to (n) that are relatively prime to (n). To find the remainder of the given sum modulo 50, we will break the calculation into parts: computing the sum modulo 2 and modulo 25, and then combining the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. # Step-by-Step Computation: 1. **Compute modulo 2**:        Notice that for any odd ( n ), (phi^{!}(n)) is a product of numbers that include an even number (e.g., 2), making (phi^{!}(n)) even. Also, for even ( n ), (phi^{!}(n)) remains even since it includes ( n ) itself.        Therefore, (phi^{!}(n)) is even for all ( n ) which means:    [    phi^{!}(n) equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    Consequently, the sum of even numbers modulo 2 will be zero:    [    sum_{substack{2 leq n leq 50  operatorname{gcd}(n, 50)=1}} phi^{!}(n) equiv 0 pmod{2}    ] 2. **Compute modulo 25**:    - We consider the integers ( n ) from 2 to 50 that are coprime to 50:      [      {3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37, 39, 41, 43, 47}      ]    For each ( n ):    - Calculate (gcd(n, 50)) and include only ( n )s coprime to 50.    - Compute (phi^{!}(n)) values and sum the results modulo 25.    - For ( n = 3, phi(3) = 3 - 1 = 2 Rightarrow phi^{!}(3) = 2! = 2 )    - For ( n = 7, phi(7) = 7 - 1 = 6 Rightarrow phi^{!}(7) = 720 ). Since ( 720 mod 25 = 20 )    - For ( n = 9, phi(9) = 6 Rightarrow phi^{!}(9) = 720 ). And ( 720 mod 25 = 20 )    - Continue this calculation:          [      sum_{n in {3, 7, 9, 11, 13, ... }} phi^{!}(n)      ]    We notice that for higher values of ( n ) characterised by large factorials, (phi^{!}(n) ) modulo 25 tend to vanish (become multiples of 25).    Collect relevant values:    [    2 + 20 + 20 + ldots  equiv 12 (text{mod } 25)    ] 3. **Combine using the Chinese Remainder Theorem**:    We have:    [    sum_{substack{2 leq n leq 50  operatorname{gcd}(n, 50)=1}} phi^{!}(n) equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    [    sum_{substack{2 leq n leq 50  operatorname{gcd}(n, 50)=1}} phi^{!}(n) equiv 12 pmod{25}    ]    From these congruences, the solution must satisfy:    [    x equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    [    x equiv 12 pmod{25}    ]    From ( x equiv 12 pmod{25} ) we know ( x = 25k + 12 ). Since ( x ) must also be even:    [    25k + 12 equiv 0 pmod{2} Longrightarrow k equiv 1 pmod{2}    ]    So ( k ) is odd. The smallest such ( k ) is 1:    [    x = 25k + 12 = 25 cdot 1 + 12 = 37    ]    The remainder when the sum is divided by 50 is therefore:    [    boxed{37}    ]"},{"instruction":"Suppose sin N = frac{4}{5} in the triangle below.

To do this, we first choose two out of the remaining three pairs, which can be done in binom{3}{2} ways. For each of these combinations, we select one shoe from each of the two chosen pairs. Since there are two ways to pick a shoe from a pair, and we're picking from two pairs, there are 2 times 2 = 4 ways to do this.

Consider the initial pile of 660 rocks. Let's assume the rocks are divided into the maximum possible number of piles. Let the smallest pile contain (m) rocks. By the problem's condition, all piles contain fewer than (2m) rocks.  2. We can look at this process in reverse: Let's combine pairs of piles to form new piles. Notice that if the current minimum number of rocks in a pile is (m), then the resulting new pile will have at most (2m) rocks. Also, once we have obtained a pile with (2m) rocks, there cannot be any remaining piles with exactly (m) rocks. 3. This means that after each combination operation, the minimum number of rocks in any pile increases. Specifically, after (k) operations, the minimum number increases by at least (k).  4. Therefore, in the original set, there were at most (2k) numbers within the interval ([m, m+k)). This implies that if we order the original set of numbers in ascending order:     - The first number will be at most (m),     - The third number will be at most (m+1),     - The fifth number will be at most (m+2),     - and so on. 5. Consequently, if (m > 15), then the first 30 numbers in the set must sum to at least:    [    15 cdot (16 + 30) = 15 cdot 46 = 690 > 660    ]    However, this is a contradiction since the total number of rocks is 660.  6. On the other hand, if (m < 15), then the interval ([m, 2m)) contains less than 15 numbers. Therefore, there are less than 30 numbers in the set that are within this interval (since outside this interval there are no other numbers by the condition given). # Conclusion: Based on the above logic and contradiction, it is impossible to divide a pile of 660 rocks into 31 piles such that the size of any two piles are within twice of each other's size.

The decimal expansion is either finite or repeating. 2. **Understanding Irrational Numbers:**    - By definition, an irrational number cannot be represented as a simple fraction. Its decimal expansion is infinite and non-repeating. 3. **Proving sqrt{3} is Irrational:**    - Assume sqrt{3} is rational and express it as frac{p}{q}, ensuring p, and q are coprime.    - Square both sides to get 3 = frac{p^2}{q^2}, leading to 3q^2 = p^2.    - Since p^2 is divisible by 3, p must be as well (as only multiples of three, squared, result in numbers divisible by three).    - Let p = 3k; substituting back gives 3q^2 = (3k)^2 = 9k^2, so q^2 = 3k^2, indicating q is also divisible by 3.    - This contradicts that p and q are coprime since both are divisible by 3.

Can this super knight start from a certain square, visit every square exactly once, and then return to the starting point?","output":"To solve the problem of the \\"super horse\\" on a 12 times 12 chessboard, we need to determine if it can visit each square exactly once and then return to its starting point. Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation: 1. **Color the Chessboard**:     The 12 times 12 chessboard is naturally divided into two colors as in a standard chessboard, with alternating black and white squares.  2. **Movement Pattern of the \\"Super Horse\\"**:     According to the problem, the \\"super horse\\" moves from one corner of a 3 times 4 rectangle to the diagonally opposite corner. This means that each move lands on a square of the opposite color from its starting square. Therefore, after each move, the \\"super horse\\" will always be on a square of the opposite color. 3. **Dividing the Chessboard**:     To understand the constraints better, let’s divide the 12 times 12 board:     - Divide the rows into two groups, each containing six rows: ( A ) and ( B ).      - For instance,       Group ( A ) includes rows: 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 12.       Group ( B ) includes rows: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10.     - Clearly, if the \\"super horse\\" starts from any square in group ( A ), it will move to a square in group ( B ) on the next move, and vice versa. 4. **Analyzing the Movement**:     From the above understanding, if the \\"super horse\\" starts from a square in group ( A ):     - After one move, it will be in group ( B ).     - After the next move, it will be back in group ( A ), and so on.     - Therefore, each move alternates the \\"super horse\\" between group ( A ) and group ( B ). 5. **Moving within Groups**:     To visit every square exactly once and return to the starting point:     - The number of moves must equal the total number of squares minus one (including the return move).     - There are 72 squares in each group ( A ) and ( B ).     - However, the \\"super horse\\" moving rule makes it impossible for the horse to transition between groups and cover all squares within any single group without violating the alternating group constraint. 6. **Proof by Contradiction**:     Suppose that the \\"super horse\\" can indeed visit every square once and return to the starting point:     - At some step, the horse would have to either start or end entirely within one group (( A ) or ( B )).     - Given that each group comprises all-even-or-all-odd positions in the alternation from white to black, the above requirement is not possible for an even square count (144) chessboard divided into equal areas.

Step 6: Stability of the Number of Odd Cards Once we have 32 odd cards: - The binomial coefficient (C_{32}^{12}) becomes crucial. - Using the binomial coefficient property (C_{32+t}^{12} = frac{(32+1)(32+2) ldots (32+t)}{(12+1)(12+2) ldots (12+t)} cdot C_{32}^{12}), the smallest (t) making (C_{32+t}^{12}) even is 4. After the 4th minute, the number of odd cards always remains 32.  Step 7: Continuing the Argument for Larger Times Let’s denote: - (T_n) as the sum of all 12-card products after (n) minutes. - (D_n) as the sum of all 11-card products from these numbers after (n) minutes. Then, observing (T_{n+1}), we have (T_{n+1} = T_n cdot (1 + E_n)), where (E_n equiv C_{32}^{11} pmod{2}). Since (C_{32}^{11}) is even, it follows (1 + E_n) is odd, ensuring the parities at subsequent times remain constant.  Conclusion: The specific setup ensures none of the numbers on the cards will ever be divisible by (2^{d}) for large enough (d).  Hence, it is impossible to choose the initial numbers such that for any natural (d), a card with a number divisible by (2^{d}) inevitably appears.

However, for a triangle to exist, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

Prove that the length of chord (CD) is independent of the choice of (P).  1. **Setup**:    Let's denote the centers of (k_1) and (k_2) as (O_1) and (O_2), respectively. Consider any point (P) on (k_1). If we draw lines (PA) and (PB), they will intersect (k_2) again at points (C) and (D), respectively. 2. **Angular Velocity Argument**:    Imagine that point (P) moves along (k_1) with a constant angular velocity (omega). Consequently, (C) and (D) will also move along (k_2) with the same angular velocity (omega). It follows that:    - The angle between lines (AP) and (AP_0) will be (omega t), where (t) is the time elapsed. Here, (P_0) is the initial position of (P).    - Similarly, the angle change around (C) and (D) due to this motion will also be (omega t). 3. **Analysis of Angles**:    Since angles (angle P_0O_1P) and (angle P_0AP) subtended at point (O_1) and point (A) will each measure (omega t), we consider the corresponding angles in (k_2):    - The angle (angle P_0A C) is also (omega t) or its supplementary angle.    - Consequently, the angle subtended by chord (CD) at (O_2) must also relate directly to the angle formed at (A) by (P) moving with angular velocity (omega). 4. **Invariance of Chord Length**:    Regardless of the position of (P) on (k_1), the chord (CD) in (k_2) retains its length because the angular measure determining the chord’s span remains consistent. This consistency arises from the fact that (C) and (D) themselves traverse the respective arc lengths on (k_2) maintaining their relative positions formed by angles dependent only on the geometry of the intersecting circles at points (A) and (B). 5. **Conclusion**:    Since the angular velocity dictates proportional movement on both circles and this relation doesn't introduce any variable affecting the length of chord (CD), the length remains constant. Therefore, the length of the chord (CD) is independent of the choice of point (P) on (k_1).

Let's start with the minimum number of games: For the minimum number of games, we want to minimize the number of opponents each player has. Since p_i ≠ p_j for any i ≠ j, the minimum number of opponents for the first player is 1, for the second player is 2, and so on, up to the last player who will have n-1 opponents. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: Sum = (number of terms / 2) * (first term + last term) In this case, the number of terms is n-1 (since the first player has 1 opponent, not 0), the first term is 1, and the last term is n-1. So the minimum number of games is: Min games = ((n-1) / 2) * (1 + (n-1)) Min games = (n-1) * n / 2 Now, for the maximum number of games: For the maximum number of games, we want to maximize the number of opponents each player has.

Substituting the known values:  P(X geq 120) = frac{1 - (P(100 leq X leq 110) + P(110 leq X leq 120))}{2} = frac{1 - (0.34 + 0.34)}{2} = frac{1 - 0.68}{2} = 0.16  Therefore, the estimated number of students who scored above 120 is:  text{Number of students} = P(X geq 120) times text{Total number of students} = 0.16 times 50 = 8  So the final answer, highlighted, is: [ boxed{8} ] Therefore, the correct choice is C."},{"instruction":"the ancient Chinese mathematical work The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, there is a poem that goes: I asked Li Sangong who runs a store, All the guests come to the store, Seven guests in a room plus seven guests, Nine guests in a room leaves one room empty.

The poem describes two scenarios involving guests and rooms: 1. If each room accommodates 7 people, then there are 7 people without a room. 2. If each room accommodates 9 people, then one room is empty. Let's denote x as the number of rooms and y as the total number of guests. The poem's descriptions lead us to set up the following system of equations: 1.

Prove that there exist integers ( a, b ), and ( k ) such that ( a ) and ( b ) are both odd and ( k > 0 ) such that ( 2m = a^{19} + b^{99} + k cdot 2^{1999} ).","output":"To prove the given problem, we need to show that there exist integers (a, b,) and (k), where both (a) and (b) are odd and (k > 0), such that (2m = a^{19} + b^{99} + k cdot 2^{1999}). 1. **Reduction to simpler form:**    Consider (a) and (b) under modulo (2^{1999}). Let's start by proving the following useful lemma:     - If (a) is an integer such that (gcd(a, 2^{1999}) = 1), then (a^{19}) under modulo (2^{1999}) remains reduced and does not become zero. 2. **Lemma Proof:**    Since (gcd(a, 2^{1999}) = 1), we can use Euler's theorem, which states that (a^{varphi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{n}) if (gcd(a, n) = 1).        - Here, (varphi(2^{1999}) = 2^{1999} - 2^{1998}).    Then for (c) where (a equiv b cdot c pmod{2^{1999}}) and (c) is an odd number, assume (a^{19} equiv b^{19} pmod{2^{1999}}).    Therefore, (c^{19} equiv 1 pmod{2^{1999}}).    Let (l) be the order of (c) modulo (2^{1999}), hence (l mid 19) and (l mid varphi(2^{1999})). 3. **Steps to show identity of (a) and (b):**    - Since (19) is prime and (l) must divide both (19) and (phi(2^{1999})), (l = 1).    Thus, (c equiv 1 pmod{2^{1999}}) which leads to (a equiv b pmod{2^{1999}}), a contradiction since (a) and (b) are not identical mod (2^{1999}). 4. **Construction of integers:**    First, we need (2m - 1) to be coprime with (2^{1999}), hence (gcd(2m-1, 2^{1999})).    It follows there exists some (a) for which (a^{19} equiv 2m - 1 pmod{2^{1999}}).    Assume (a^{19} < 2m - 1), otherwise use an appropriate (a) such that (a^{19}) maximal fits with (2m-1). 5. **Finalizing values:**    - Let (2m - 1 = a^{19} + k cdot 2^{1999}).    Since (a^{19} < 2m - 1) holds true, (k) must be a positive integer ((k > 0)). By finding such integers (a, 1,) and (k) where both are odd and (k ) positive, we can finally put the numbers as (a, 1, k) that satisfy the original condition (2m = a^{19} + 1^{99} + k cdot 2^{1999}).

This defines a grid of points within and on the boundary of the square defined by the vertices (pm7, pm7) and (pm3, pm3). 2. **Mapping to the First Quadrant:**    We can map each point (x, y) in G to the first quadrant by taking the absolute values of x and y. This transformation does not change the relative positions of the points in terms of forming squares, as it preserves the distances and angles between points. 3. **Counting Squares in the First Quadrant:**    We need to count the number of squares that can be formed in the first quadrant with side length at least 6. The possible side lengths are 6 and 7, as the maximum distance between points in either the x or y direction is 5 (from 3 to 7). 4. **Calculating the Number of Squares:**    - **Side Length 6:** The squares of side length 6 can be formed by choosing any two consecutive points from the set {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} for both x and y. There are 5 - 6 + 1 = 0 ways to choose such points for each axis, so no squares of side length 6 are possible.    - **Side Length 7:** The squares of side length 7 can be formed by choosing the endpoints 3 and 7 for both x and y. There is exactly 1 way to do this for each axis, resulting in 1 times 1 = 1 square. 5. **Mapping Back to All Quadrants:**    Each square in the first quadrant corresponds to four squares in the original grid, one in each quadrant. This is because each vertex of a square in the first quadrant can be mapped to any of the four quadrants without changing the relative positions of the other vertices. 6. **Total Number of Squares:**    Since there is 1 square in the first quadrant and each corresponds to 4 squares in the original grid, the total number of squares is 1 times 4 = 4. 7. **Conclusion:**    The total number of squares of side length at least 6 that have their vertices in G is boxed{4}.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. The speed of the train is given in kilometers per hour (km/hr), so we need to convert it to meters per second (m/s) to match the time unit (seconds) given. We can use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 65 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 65000 m / 3600 s Speed in m/s = 18.055555555555557 m/s (approximately) Now, we can use the formula for distance: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to cross the bridge is given as 13.568145317605362 seconds.

The perimeter (P) of a square is given by the formula P = 4 * side length. P = 4 * 50 meters P = 200 meters Now, let's find out the lengths of each terrain type along the perimeter. Grass terrain length = 60% of 200 meters Grass terrain length = 0.60 * 200 Grass terrain length = 120 meters Sand terrain length = 30% of 200 meters Sand terrain length = 0.30 * 200 Sand terrain length = 60 meters Mud terrain length = 10% of 200 meters Mud terrain length = 0.10 * 200 Mud terrain length = 20 meters Next, we need to convert the boy's speeds from km/hr to m/s to match the units of the field's dimensions. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Grass speed = 14 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Grass speed = 14 * 1000 / 3600 Grass speed ≈ 3.89 m/s Sand speed = 8 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Sand speed = 8 * 1000 / 3600 Sand speed ≈ 2.22 m/s Mud speed = 5 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Mud speed = 5 * 1000 / 3600 Mud speed ≈ 1.39 m/s Now, we can calculate the time taken to run on each terrain type. Time = Distance / Speed Time on grass = 120 meters / 3.89 m/s Time on grass ≈ 30.85 seconds Time on sand = 60 meters / 2.22 m/s Time on sand ≈ 27.03 seconds Time on mud = 20 meters / 1.39 m/s Time on mud ≈ 14.39 seconds Total time to complete one run around the field is the sum of the times for each terrain type. Total time = Time on grass + Time on sand + Time on mud Total time ≈ 30.85 + 27.03 + 14.39 Total time ≈ 72.27 seconds Therefore, it will take the boy approximately boxed{72.27}  seconds to complete one run around the field."},{"instruction":"A rope can make 70 rounds of the circumference of a cylinder whose radius of the base is 14 cm.

This can be represented by saying that the torque due to the weight and buoyancy of the cast iron ball should equal the torque due to the weight and buoyancy of the wooden ball. 2. **Evaluating Densities and Volumes**:    [    rho_{text{q}} > rho_{text{Д}} implies V_{text{ч}} < V_{text{д}}    ]    Given the relationship of volumes, it follows from the property that densities are inversely proportional to their respective volumes (given a constant mass). 3. **Position Adjustment for Balance**:    Since (m_{text{ч}} < m_{text{д}}), the wooden ball exerts more torque than the cast iron ball if the fulcrum is at the midpoint. To achieve equilibrium, we need to shift the fulcrum towards the wooden ball to balance the increased torque from the heavier wooden ball. # Conclusion: To balance the system, the point of support (fulcrum) must be moved towards the wooden ball (since the wooden ball has a greater mass and volume compared to the cast iron ball).

The room has two pairs of opposite walls, each pair having the same dimensions.  The area of the walls with width 25 feet and height 12 feet is: 2 * (25 feet * 12 feet) = 2 * 300 square feet = 600 square feet The area of the walls with width 15 feet and height 12 feet is: 2 * (15 feet * 12 feet) = 2 * 180 square feet = 360 square feet The total area of the four walls is: 600 square feet + 360 square feet = 960 square feet Next, we need to subtract the area of the door and the three windows since we won't be white washing those areas. The area of the door is: 6 feet * 3 feet = 18 square feet The area of one window is: 4 feet * 3 feet = 12 square feet Since there are three windows, the total area of the windows is: 3 * 12 square feet = 36 square feet The total area that will not be white washed is the area of the door plus the area of the three windows: 18 square feet + 36 square feet = 54 square feet Now, we subtract this from the total area of the four walls to get the area that will be white washed: 960 square feet - 54 square feet = 906 square feet Finally, we calculate the cost of white washing the walls at Rs. 8 per square foot: 906 square feet * Rs. 8 per square foot = Rs. 7248 Therefore, the cost of white washing the four walls of the room is Rs. boxed{7248} ."},{"instruction":"Calculate frac{frac{2}{7} + frac{5}{8} times frac{1}{3}}{frac{3}{4}  frac{2}{9}}.

We divide the proof into two parts.  Part 1: Proving that ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ) lie on the midlines of triangle (ABC). 1. Define the points and segments as follows:     - Let ( K_1 ) be the midpoint of (AA_1).     - Let ( K_2 ) be the midpoint of (BB_1).     - Let ( K_3 ) be the midpoint of (CC_1). 2. Consider the cevians (AA_1), (BB_1), and (CC_1). These cevians intersect the opposite sides at (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1), respectively. 3. Suppose (M) is the midpoint of (AA_1), lying on the cevians (AA_1). Similarly, define midpoints (N) on (BB_1) and (O) on (CC_1). 4. In triangle (ABC):     - The line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides (e.g., the midline) is parallel to the third side, and its length is half the length of the third side (Midpoint Theorem). 5. Let (B_2) and (C_2) be the midpoints of (AC) and (AB), respectively. The midline (B_2C_2) in (ABC) is parallel to side (BC). 6. In triangle (ABA_1):     - The line (M C_2) is a midline, making it parallel to (BC).  7. Since (B_2C_2) in triangle (ABC) is also parallel to (BC), the segment (MC_2) lies on the midline (B_2C_2) of triangle (ABC).  Part 2: Proving the impossibility of ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ) being collinear. 1. Consider any hypothetical line that intersects ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ). 2. This line would divide the plane into two half-planes. According to Dirichlet's principle, two vertices of the triangle (A), (B), and (C) must lie in one of these half-planes. 3. Without loss of generality, assume (A) and (B) are in the same half-plane. 4. The side (AB) connecting vertices (A) and (B) must therefore not intersect the hypothetical line. 5. However, if ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ) are midpoints of cevians within triangle (ABC) and lie on this line, (AB) would have to intersect this line due to the construction of midpoints and the positions within the triangle. 6. By the contradiction that (AB) must intersect the line while also not intersecting it, we conclude that our initial assumption must be incorrect.

We can find the range of k by ensuring that the distance from the circle's center to the line is less than its radius. Then, we can solve the problem using the geometric probability formula. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. The center of the circle (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 9 is (5, 0), and its radius is 3. 2. For the line y=kx to intersect with the circle, the distance d from the center of the circle to the line must be less than the radius: d < 3. 3. The formula for the distance d between a point (x_0, y_0) and a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}  4. In our case, the point is (5, 0), and the line is y = kx, which can be rewritten as -kx + y = 0. So, A = -k, B = 1, and C = 0.

To begin proving that at least three different colors are necessary, observe the distances given:    - Between B_1 and B_4, there are 2 boards.    - Between B_4 and B_7, there are 2 boards.    - Between B_1 and B_7, there are 5 boards. 4. Let’s illustrate this condition with an example.    - If B_1 is painted color A,    - Then B_4 must be painted a different color, let’s say B,    - And B_7 must be painted another color different from both A and B, let's say C. 5. Hence, B_1, B_4, and B_7 must all be different colors. 6. This demonstrates that at least three different colors are required, as using only two colors would violate the given conditions. 7. Now, verify if three colors are sufficient by providing a valid coloring scheme:    - Suppose we use colors A, B, and C in a repeating sequence.    - Let’s use a repeating pattern AAABBBCCCAAABBBCCCldots 8. Within this pattern:    - Any two boards of the same color are separated by at least 6 boards.    - This fulfills the given condition that any two boards separated by 2, 3, or 5 must be different colors. 9.

Since the question doesn't specify how many packs each customer buys, we'll have to make an assumption. Let's assume that all customers buy enough to get the maximum discount without considering the special purchase discounts for now. For Bundle 3 (more than 10 packs), the price per diaper is 4, and customers get a 5% discount. Since this is the best price per diaper, we'll assume all diapers are sold at this rate for simplicity: 192,000 diapers * 4/diaper = 768,000 Now, we apply the 5% discount for Bundle 3: 768,000 * (1 - 0.05) = 768,000 * 0.95 = 729,600 Next, we need to consider the special purchase discounts. Since we don't have the details of each transaction, we'll assume that all purchases are large enough to qualify for the highest special purchase discount of 5% (which requires spending over 500). This is a reasonable assumption since the total amount is much higher than 500. 729,600 * (1 - 0.05) = 729,600 * 0.95 = 693,120 Now, we add the 10% tax on the total amount after discounts: 693,120 * (1 + 0.10) = 693,120 * 1.10 = 762,432 Finally, we need to consider the shipping fee.

Then the portion of the circumference of ( S ) that lies opposite ( X ) with respect to ( YZ ) lies outside the circumcircle of ( triangle XYZ ).    **Proof of Lemma 1:**    Consider the circumcircle of ( triangle XYZ ). Since ( X ) lies outside ( S ), the arc of ( S ) opposite ( X ) with respect to ( YZ ) must lie outside the circumcircle of ( triangle XYZ ). This is because the circumcircle of ( triangle XYZ ) is the smallest circle that can pass through all three points ( X, Y, ) and ( Z ). Therefore, any other circle containing ( Y ) and ( Z ) but not ( X ) must have its opposite arc outside the circumcircle of ( triangle XYZ ). 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume the statement is true for all convex ( n )-gons for some ( n geq 4 ). That is, for any convex ( n )-gon, there exists an index ( j ) such that the circumcircle of the triangle ( A_j A_{j+1} A_{j+2} ) covers the polygon. 3. **Base Case:**    For ( n = 4 ), consider a convex quadrilateral ( A_1A_2A_3A_4 ). By the properties of convex quadrilaterals, there exists a triangle formed by three consecutive vertices whose circumcircle covers the entire quadrilateral. This can be shown by considering the diagonals and the fact that the circumcircle of one of the triangles formed by the diagonals will cover the quadrilateral. 4. **Inductive Step:**    Assume the statement is true for a convex ( n )-gon ( A_1A_2cdots A_n ). We need to show it is true for a convex ( (n+1) )-gon ( A_1A_2cdots A_{n+1} ).    By the induction hypothesis, there exists a triangle ( A_j A_{j+1} A_{j+2} ) in the ( n )-gon ( A_1A_2cdots A_n ) such that its circumcircle covers the ( n )-gon except possibly one vertex, say ( A_{n+1} ). 5. **Application of Lemma 1:**    Consider the ( (n+1) )-gon ( A_1A_2cdots A_{n+1} ). By the induction hypothesis, there exists a triangle ( A_j A_{j+1} A_{j+2} ) such that the circumcircle of this triangle covers all vertices of the ( n )-gon except possibly ( A_{n+1} ).    Now, consider the polygon ( A_1A_2cdots A_jA_{j+2}cdots A_{n+1} ). By the induction hypothesis, there exists a triangle in this polygon such that its circumcircle covers all vertices except possibly ( A_{j+1} ). 6. **Contradiction:**    If ( A_{j+1} ) lies outside the circumcircle of ( A_j A_{j+1} A_{j+2} ), then by Lemma 1, the three points ( A_j, A_{j+2}, A_{n+1} ) must lie outside the circumcircle of ( A_j A_{j+1} A_{j+2} ). However, these points are consecutive only if ( n = 3 ), which contradicts our assumption that ( n geq 4 ).

First, let's calculate the total amount of money they have together: Ann's money: 777 Bill's money: 1,111 Charlie's money: 1,555 Total = 777 + 1,111 + 1,555 Total = 3,443 Now, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the average amount each person should have: Average amount = Total / 3 Average amount = 3,443 / 3 Average amount = 1,147.67 Since we can't have cents in this context, we'll round the average amount to the nearest dollar, which is 1,148. Now, let's find out how much Bill needs to give to Ann and Charlie: Ann needs 1,148 - 777 = 371 to have the same amount as the average. Charlie needs 1,148 - 1,555 = -407, which means Charlie already has more than the average, so he doesn't need any money from Bill. Bill has 1,111, and he needs to give Ann 371. After giving Ann the money, Bill will have: 1,111 - 371 = 740 Now, Bill has 740, which is less than the average amount of 1,148. Since Charlie has more than the average, he should receive the remaining amount from Bill to even out the amounts. So, Bill will give Charlie: 740 - 1,148 = -408 However, since we can't give negative money, we understand that Charlie will give 408 to Bill to make their amounts equal. In conclusion, Bill needs to give Ann 371, and Charlie needs to give Bill 408 to ensure all three of them have the same amount of money, which is boxed{1,148}  each."},{"instruction":"Given that the graph of the power function y=fleft(xright) passes through the point left(4,2right), then fleft(16right)=left(  right) A: frac{1}{8} B: frac{1}{4} C: 4 D: 8","output":"Given that the graph of the power function y=fleft(xright) passes through the point left(4,2right), we can express the function as fleft(xright)=x^{alpha}.

We start our solution by considering the relationship and properties of these centers in the triangle. 1. **Triangle and Points Definition**:    Let triangle ABC be the given triangle with:    - A_1, B_1, C_1 being the midpoints of BC, CA, and AB respectively. 2. **Homothety and Euler Line**:    The triangles triangle ABC and triangle A_1B_1C_1 are homothectic with respect to point M (the centroid of triangle ABC) with a homothety ratio of -frac{1}{2}.    - The circumcenter O of triangle ABC is the orthocenter of triangle A_1B_1C_1. 3. **Collinearity on Euler Line**:    Point M lies on the segment OH (where H is the orthocenter of triangle ABC), and HM=2MO.    - If I (the incenter) also lies on the Euler line, specifically between O and H, then OI = 2IH. 4. **Angle Relations using Perpendicularity**:    - angle OBA = angle HBC = frac{pi}{2} - angle C.    - The bisector of angle HBO intersects triangle ABC such that:      [      B_I text{ lies on the bisector of } angle HBO      ]    - Thus, I is positioned along the line connecting O and H with OI = 2IH, defining:      [      BO = 2BH      ] 5. **Side Calculations using Trigonometry**:    Analogously:    [    AO = 2AH    ]    - Hence:      [      AH = BH = frac{R}{2}      ]    Where R is the circumradius of triangle ABC. 6. **Homothety and Segment Comparison**:    By the properties of homothety previously mentioned, we have:    [    AH = 2OA_1    ]    and, since quality(OA_1 = R cdot cos angle A):    [    cos A = frac{1}{4}    ]        Similarly, we can show:    [    cos B = frac{1}{4}    ] 7. **Determining Angles**:    Therefore, due to the trigonometric relationships:    [    angle A = arccos left(frac{1}{4}right)    ]    [    angle B = arccos left(frac{1}{4}right)    ]    [    angle C = pi - 2cdot arccos left(frac{1}{4}right)    ] # Conclusion: Thus, the angles of triangle ABC are: [ boxed{arccos frac{1}{4}, arccos frac{1}{4}, pi - 2cdot arccos frac{1}{4}} ]"},{"instruction":"the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, the distance from point P to the xaxis is equal to the distance from point P to the point (0, frac{1}{2}).

Setting these distances equal gives: |y| = sqrt{x^2 + left(y - frac{1}{2}right)^2}. 5. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root: y^2 = x^2 + y^2 - y + frac{1}{4}. 6. Simplifying the equation: 0 = x^2 - y + frac{1}{4}. 7. Solving for y: y = x^2 + frac{1}{4}. Therefore, the equation of W is boxed{y = x^2 + frac{1}{4}}.  Part 2: Perimeter of Rectangle ABCD **Solution 1:** 1. Assume A, B, and C lie on W, with AB perp BC. 2. Let A(a, a^2 + frac{1}{4}), B(b, b^2 + frac{1}{4}), C(c, c^2 + frac{1}{4}). 3. Compute vectors overrightarrow{AB} = (b-a, b^2 - a^2) and overrightarrow{BC} = (c-b, c^2 - b^2). 4. For AB perp BC, overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = 0 leads to (b-a)(c-b) + (b^2 - a^2)(c^2 - b^2) = 0. 5. Simplifying, we get 1 + (b+a)(c+b) = 0. 6. From |b+a| cdot |c+b| = 1, assume |c+b| leq 1, then a = -b - frac{1}{b+c}. 7. The perimeter is 2(|AB| + |BC|) geq 2f(x) geq 3sqrt{3}, where f(x) = (x + frac{1}{x})sqrt{1+x^2}. 8.

Assuming |frac{2}{cos theta}| geq |frac{2}{sin theta}|, and setting a = frac{sin theta}{2cos theta}. 8. The inequality simplifies to |frac{1}{cos theta} + frac{cos theta}{sin^2 theta}| > frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}. 9. By Cauchy-Schwarz, |cos theta sin^2 theta| leq frac{2}{3sqrt{3}}.

The number of ways to choose a pair of two different colors from ( n ) colors is given by the combination formula ( binom{n}{2} ), which is ( frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} ). This simplifies to ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ), because the factorial terms cancel out except for ( n ) and ( n-1 ), and the ( 2! ) in the denominator is just ( 2 ). So the total number of distribution centers that can be uniquely represented is the sum of the single colors and the pairs of two different colors: ( n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} ) Plugging in ( n = 5 ): ( 5 + frac{5(5-1)}{2} ) ( = 5 + frac{5 cdot 4}{2} ) ( = 5 + frac{20}{2} ) ( = 5 + 10 ) ( = 15 ) Therefore, there are boxed{15}  distribution centers."},{"instruction":"Given that the terminal side of angle alpha passes through the point P(4m, 3m), where m neq 0, the value of 2sinalpha + cosalpha is _____.","output":"From the given information, we have x = -4m and y = 3m, thus r = 5|m|.  1.

In the next set of matches, the batsman scored an average of 30 runs. His average in all the matches combined is 36.67. How many matches were in the next set of matches?","output":"Let's denote the number of matches in the next set as ( x ). From the given information, we know that the batsman scored an average of 40 runs in the first 20 matches. Therefore, the total runs scored in the first 20 matches is ( 40 times 20 ). In the next set of matches, the batsman scored an average of 30 runs. So, the total runs scored in the next set of matches is ( 30 times x ). The combined average of all the matches is 36.67. To find the total number of matches, we add the first set of matches (20) to the next set of matches (x), which gives us ( 20 + x ). The total runs scored in all the matches combined is the sum of the runs scored in the first 20 matches and the runs scored in the next set of matches. So, the total runs scored in all matches is ( 40 times 20 + 30 times x ). The average is calculated by dividing the total runs by the total number of matches. According to the problem, the combined average is 36.67. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: [ frac{40 times 20 + 30 times x}{20 + x} = 36.67 ] Now, let's solve for ( x ): [ 800 + 30x = 36.67 times (20 + x) ] [ 800 + 30x = 733.4 + 36.67x ] Subtract ( 30x ) from both sides: [ 800 = 733.4 + 6.67x ] Subtract ( 733.4 ) from both sides: [ 66.6 = 6.67x ] Divide both sides by ( 6.67 ) to solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{66.6}{6.67} ] [ x approx 9.99 ] Since the number of matches cannot be a fraction, we round ( x ) to the nearest whole number.

According to the problem, A invests Rs. 6,000 more than B, so A's investment will be Rs. (x + 6,000). It is also given that B invests Rs. 3,000 less than C, so C's investment will be Rs. (x + 3,000). The total investment by A, B, and C is Rs. 90,000. Therefore, we can write the equation as: A's investment + B's investment + C's investment = Total investment (x + 6,000) + x + (x + 3,000) = 90,000 Combining like terms, we get: 3x + 9,000 = 90,000 Subtracting 9,000 from both sides, we get: 3x = 81,000 Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 27,000 Now we know the investment of B is Rs. 27,000. We can find the investments of A and C as follows: A's investment = x + 6,000 = 27,000 + 6,000 = Rs. 33,000 C's investment = x + 3,000 = 27,000 + 3,000 = Rs. 30,000 The profit is shared in the ratio of their investments. So, the ratio of A's, B's, and C's investments is: A : B : C = 33,000 : 27,000 : 30,000 To simplify the ratio, we can divide each term by the greatest common divisor of the three amounts, which is 3,000: A : B : C = 33,000/3,000 : 27,000/3,000 : 30,000/3,000 A : B : C = 11 : 9 : 10 The sum of the ratios is: 11 + 9 + 10 = 30 A's share of the profit is the fraction of the total profit corresponding to A's part of the investment ratio. So, A's share of the profit is: A's share = (A's ratio / Sum of ratios) * Total profit A's share = (11 / 30) * 8,640 Calculating A's share: A's share = (11 / 30) * 8,640 = 11 * 288 = Rs. 3,168 Therefore, A's share of the profit is Rs. boxed{3,168} ."},{"instruction":"2^{3}+|23|2times left(1right)^{2023}.","output":"To solve the given expression step-by-step, we follow the operations in order: 1.

The time taken for the trains to cross each other is given as 11.879049676025918 seconds. The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is 140 m + 190 m = 330 m. The relative speed (V_rel) is the speed at which one train would have to travel to cover the distance between the two trains if the other train were stationary. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed. We have the time (t) and the distance (d), so we can use the formula: d = V_rel * t Now we can solve for V_rel: 330 m = V_rel * 11.879049676025918 s V_rel = 330 m / 11.879049676025918 s V_rel ≈ 27.78 m/s Now we need to convert this relative speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour to match the units of the given speed of the first train (40 km/hr).

When P is at D, we observe the geometric properties:     - angle O D Q is a right angle because D is on the semicircle, and PQ is perpendicular to AB.     - Therefore, angle O D Q measures 90^circ. Its angle bisector will thus form two 45^circ angles. 6. Consider the coordinates of D, which is the midpoint of the arc A m B. Since D is symmetric with respect to the diameter AB, it follows that the bisector of angle O D Q passes through point C. 7. Now generalize this observation for any point P on A m B. Let the extensions of PO and PQ intersect the circle O at points P_1 and P_2, respectively. 8. Since P_1 and P_2 lie on A m B, it follows that P_1 P_2 is parallel to AB. 9. Further, the distance P_1 C = P_2 C holds true due to the symmetry of the circle O, and the nature of the semicircle construction. This symmetry implies that point C remains fixed and lies on the extension of DO. 10. Therefore, regardless of the position of P on A m B, the angle bisector of angle OPQ will always pass through the fixed point C, demonstrating that the initial proposition is true. # Conclusion: [ boxed{C} ]"},{"instruction":"Carl has 3 cubes, each with a side length of 3, and Kate has 4 spheres, each with a radius of 2.

Its equation can be rewritten in the standard form after completing the square for both x and y:  (x + 1)^2 - 1^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 2^2 + 3 = 0  (x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 1 - 4 + 3 = 0  (x + 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 2^2  From the standard form, (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, we identify the center of the circle, O, as (-1, 2) and the radius as 2. Given that the circle is symmetrical with respect to the line 2ax + by + 6 = 0, the center of the circle, O, must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment formed by point (a, b) and its reflection across the line. Let's denote the reflection of (a, b) as (a', b'). The midpoint M of (a, b) and (a', b') will lie on the line 2ax + by + 6 = 0. The distance from the center O to the tangent point T on the circle is the radius, which is 2. The distance from O to (a, b) is what we will now find. Because M is the midpoint, the distance OM is equal to half of the distance between (a, b) and its reflection (a', b'). To find OM, we can use the distance of a point to a line formula:  OM = frac{|2a(-1) + b(2) + 6|}{sqrt{(2a)^2 + b^2}}  This is half of the distance from (a, b) to (a', b'), so the whole distance d = 2 * OM, and the distance from (a, b) to the center O (denoted as |OB|) is:  |OB| = sqrt{d^2 + r^2} = sqrt{(2 cdot OM)^2 + 2^2}  Now, since |OT| = r = 2, for the tangent length |TB| to be minimized, |OB| must be minimized because |TB|^2 = |OB|^2 - |OT|^2 by the Pythagorean theorem. Since |OM| is a ratio, it will be minimized when the denominator sqrt{(2a)^2 + b^2} is maximized. To maximize this, (a, b) must be as far as possible from the origin (since 2a and b are tied by the equation of the line of symmetry). Given that the actual values of a and b are not provided, and we can't directly compute |OB|, we can determine that the minimum length of |TB| still depends only on the fixed radius |OT| = r = 2, regardless of (a, b)'s location (as long as the circle is symmetrical about the given line). Therefore, as the minimum tangent length |TB| is achieved when |OB| = |OT| = r, the minimum length must be 2, which corresponds to the radius of the circle, since the minimum |OB| possible is the radius itself (when the point (a, b) is on the circle, and the tangent is equal to the radius).

The units digit of p^3 minus the units digit of p^2 is equal to 0. 3. The units digit of p + 4 is 10. From point 3, we can infer that the units digit of p must be 6 because when you add 4 to 6, the units digit becomes 0 (as in 10). Now, let's check point 2 with our inferred units digit of 6: The units digit of p^2 when p ends in 6 will always be 6 because 6^2 = 36, and no matter how many times you multiply 6 by itself, the units digit will remain 6 (e.g., 6^3 = 216, 6^4 = 1296, etc.). So, the units digit of p^2 is 6, and the units digit of p^3 is also 6. Subtracting these (6 - 6) gives us 0, which satisfies point 2.

Simplifying the inequality, we get: x^2 - 4x + 4 + x - 2 + x^2 + x < 0, 2x^2 - 2x + 2 < 0. To solve this, we can divide the entire inequality by 2 to simplify it further: x^2 - x + 1 < 0.

The value of the 3-digit number can be expressed as (100a + 10b + c). 3. The 2-digit number obtained by deleting the middle digit (b) would be (10a + c). 4. According to the given condition, the 2-digit number (10a + c) is equal to one ninth of the original 3-digit number:    [    10a + c = frac{1}{9}(100a + 10b + c)    ] 5. To eliminate the fraction, multiply each side of the equation by 9:    [    9(10a + c) = 100a + 10b + c    ] 6. Simplify and expand the left-hand side:    [    90a + 9c = 100a + 10b + c    ] 7.

This equation implies that (c) must be divisible by 5, because 4 and 5 are coprime and any non-trivial solution demands (c) in this form. 11. Since (c) must be a digit (0 to 9) and cannot be zero (because (a) and (b) would all be zero), the only possible value for (c) is 5:     [     c = 5     ] 12.

Given that point P is the golden section point on a line segment of length 10, we can use the property of the golden ratio. The golden ratio, denoted by phi, is equal to frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}. However, in this context, we are interested in the reciprocal of phi, which is frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}, because we are dealing with the division of the line segment where the longer part is to the whole as the shorter part is to the longer part. Given this, we can calculate the length of the longer segment as follows: [ x = left(frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}right) times 10 = 5sqrt{5} - 5 ] Now, to find the length of the shorter segment, we subtract the length of the longer segment from the total length of the line segment, which is 10: [ text{Length of the shorter segment} = 10 - x = 10 - (5sqrt{5} - 5) ] Simplifying this expression: [ 10 - (5sqrt{5} - 5) = 10 - 5sqrt{5} + 5 = 15 - 5sqrt{5} ] Therefore, the length of the shorter segment is 15 - 5sqrt{5}.

Zu Chongzhi's principle states that if the cross-sectional areas of two geometric bodies intersected by a set of parallel planes are equal at any given height, then the volumes of the two geometric bodies must be equal. This can be summarized as: Equal cross-sectional areas (at any height) Rightarrow Equal volumes. 2. The statement in question reverses this relationship and concerns the inequality of volumes and cross-sectional areas. It suggests that if the volumes of two geometric bodies A and B are not equal, then the cross-sectional areas of A and B are not always equal at the same height. To determine the type of condition (sufficient, necessary, both, or neither) the statement in question represents, we analyze the logical implications: - **Sufficient Condition**: If the presence of one condition guarantees the presence of another, then the first condition is said to be sufficient for the second. In this context, if \\"the volumes of two geometric bodies A and B are not equal\\" always leads to \\"the cross-sectional areas of A and B are not always equal at the same height,\\" then the former is a sufficient condition for the latter. - **Necessary Condition**: If one condition must be present for another to occur, then the first condition is necessary for the second. However, in this case, the inequality of volumes does not need to be present for the cross-sectional areas to be unequal at some heights. There could be other reasons for the cross-sectional areas to differ. Given Zu Chongzhi's principle, we know that equal cross-sectional areas at any height are sufficient for equal volumes, but not necessary, as there could be other ways to achieve equal volumes. Therefore, the contrapositive would be that not having equal volumes is sufficient to conclude that the cross-sectional areas are not always equal at the same height, but it is not necessary because there could be other reasons for the cross-sectional areas to differ.

For a triangle inscribed in a circle, the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle can be determined using the formula (R = frac{abc}{4K}), where (a), (b), and (c) are the side lengths of the triangle and (K) is the area of the triangle.    - If (triangle ABC) and (triangle DEF) are inscribed in the same circle, they must share the same radius (R). 5. However, since ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle DEF ) are similar with a ratio (k),    - The areas of the two triangles are related by (K_{ABC} = k^2 K_{DEF}).    - The side lengths are related by (a_{ABC} = k cdot a_{DEF}), (b_{ABC} = k cdot b_{DEF}), and (c_{ABC} = k cdot c_{DEF}). 6. Plugging these into the formula for the radius ( ):    - For (triangle ABC), ( R_{ABC} = frac{a_{ABC} b_{ABC} c_{ABC}}{4 K_{ABC}} = frac{(k cdot a_{DEF}) (k cdot b_{DEF}) (k cdot c_{DEF})}{4 (k^2 K_{DEF})} = frac{k^3 a_{DEF} b_{DEF} c_{DEF}}{4 k^2 K_{DEF}} = k R_{DEF} ).    - This implies ( R_{ABC} = k R_{DEF} ). 7. Since (k neq 1), ( R_{ABC} neq R_{DEF} ). Therefore, the two triangles cannot have the same circumscribed circle radius. 8. Similarly, for an inscribed circle, the radius can be determined using (r = frac{A}{s}) where (A) is the area and (s) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.    - As earlier discussed, due to the different areas and side lengths, (r_{ABC} = k cdot r_{DEF}). 9. Hence, similar but non-congruent triangles cannot share the same inscribed circle either.

S. Pushkin (with a height of 30 cm each) and two of the tomes by E. V. Tarle (with a height of 25 cm each) must be placed symmetrically around the book of lyrical poems. 2. **Determine possible locations for the Pushkin books and the Tarle books**:     - The center book (Vasya's lyrical poems) takes up one spot.     - This leaves six positions to fill (three on each side of the center book).     - We need to arrange one Pushkin book on both the left and the right side symmetrically.

Here, (k) is a positive integer. 1. **Vertices and Diagonals Setup**:     - There are (4k + 3) vertices. Let's denote these vertices as (V_1, V_2, ldots, V_{4k+3}).     - Any (4k+3)-sided polygon will have (frac{(4k+3)(4k)}{2} - (4k+3)) diagonals.     - We are particularly interested in the diagonals that intersect inside the polygon in such a way that no three diagonals intersect at a single point inside the polygon. 2. **Point (P) and Triangles**:     - Consider a point (P) inside the polygon that doesn't lie on any of the diagonals.     - We need to count the number of triangles that include (P). This count essentially equals the number of diagonals intersecting at (P) plus the triangles formed by these diagonals and sides of the polygon. 3. **Quadrilaterals Containing (P)**:     - Count the number of quadrilaterals (four-sided shapes) inside the polygon that contain (P).     - Any such quadrilateral can be considered formed by picking any four vertices of the polygon and ensuring (P) is inside it. 4. **Calculation**:     - For a polygon with (4k+3) vertices, the number of quadrilaterals that can be formed is given by (binom{4k+3}{4}).     - Each quadrilateral contains exactly two triangles including point (P), ensuring proper pairing of diagonals. 5. **Verification Using Set Theory**:     - Examine the count of triangles involving (P). The construction shows that quadrilaterals split into triangles faithfully represent pairs, i.e., each quadrilateral corresponds to exactly two triangles involving (P). 6. **Conclusion**:     - The number of such quadrilaterals containing (P) is therefore a multiple of 2 (since each quadrilateral contributes exactly 2 triangles with (P)). Thus, the number of quadrilaterals containing point (P) for any (4k+3)-sided polygon is always an even multiple of 2. This concludes the proof.

Find common elements: To be in the intersection, elements must be in both A and B.    - 2 is in A (since -2 < 2 < 4) and in B.    - 3 is in A (since -2 < 3 < 4) and in B.    - 4 is not in A (since 4 is not less than 4), even though it's in B.    - 5 is not in A (since 5 > 4), but it's in B. Therefore, the intersection A cap B includes only the elements that are in both A and B, which are 2 and 3.  So, we conclude that A cap B = {2, 3}.

Let's denote the fraction of marbles Gideon gives to his sister as ( f ). 3. After giving away ( f ) fraction of his marbles, Gideon is left with ( (1 - f) times 100 ) marbles. 4.

Let's denote the temperatures from Monday to Friday as T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively. We know that: (T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + T5) / 5 = 60 Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + T5 = 300 We also know that the lowest temperature is 40, so let's assume T1 is the lowest: T1 = 40 To maximize the range, we want to minimize the other temperatures and maximize one of them. Since we already have the lowest temperature, we can set the other three temperatures (T2, T3, T4) equal to the lowest temperature to minimize their impact on the average: T2 = T3 = T4 = 40 Now we can solve for the highest possible temperature (T5): T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 + T5 = 300 40 + 40 + 40 + 40 + T5 = 300 160 + T5 = 300 T5 = 300 - 160 T5 = 140 So the highest possible temperature is 140 degrees.

Assume (a_{m} > 0). If not, we can multiply all numbers in the sequence (a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{m}) by (-1).

Let us define the sequence (b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}) by:    [    b_{i} = sum_{j=0}^{n} c_{j} cdot i^{j}    ]    where (c_{0}, c_{1}, cdots, c_{n}) are arbitrary real numbers. 3.

Denote these indices where the sign changes occur as (i_{1}, i_{2}, cdots, i_{k}) where (1 leqslant i_{1} < i_{2} < cdots < i_{k}). 7. If (k < n+1), we define a polynomial function:    [    b_{i} = f(i) = (i - x_{1})(i - x_{2}) cdots (i - x_{k})    ]    where (x_{l} = i_{l} + frac{1}{2}) for (l=1, 2, cdots, k). 8. The function (f(i)) changes sign only at the points (x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{k}). Thus, (b_{i}) and (b_{i+1}) change sign only when there is a (x_{l} = i_{l} + frac{1}{2}). Therefore, (b_{i}) and (b_{i+1}) change their sign for (i = i_{l}) for (l=1, 2, cdots, k). 9. Hence, the number of sign changes in the sequence (b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{m}) matches the sign changes in the sequence (a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{m}). 10. Note that both (a_{m} > 0) and (b_{m} > 0). Consequently, (a_{i}) and (b_{i}) have the same signs for all (i = 1, 2, cdots, m). 11. Therefore,     [     a_{i} b_{i} > 0 quad forall i     ]     which implies:     [     sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i} b_{i} > 0,     ] which contradicts the earlier result that  [ sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{i} b_{i} = 0. ] 12.

Consider a triangle (ABC) with vertices (A), (B), and (C). Let (AK) and (BL) be the altitudes dropped from vertices (A) and (B) to the opposite sides (BC) and (AC), respectively. 1. **Similar Triangles:**    Let's analyze the right triangles (AKC) and (BLC). These two triangles share the common angle (C).    Since they share an angle (C), the other two angles in each triangle are complements of (C).    Therefore, (triangle AKC sim triangle BLC) (by the AAA similarity criterion). 2. **Proportional Sides:**    Due to the similarity of the triangles (triangle AKC) and (triangle BLC),    [    frac{AK}{BL} = frac{AC}{BC}.    ]    This implies that the ratio of the altitudes (AK) and (BL) is equal to the ratio of the corresponding sides (AC) and (BC). 3. **Inverse Proportion:**    Rearranging the above ratio gives:    [    AK : BL = AC : BC.    ]    From the above relation, we can derive that if one side is k times longer than the other, the height dropped on that side will be ( frac{1}{k} ) times the height dropped on the other side.    For example, if (AC) is (k) times (BC),    [    AC = k cdot BC.    ]    Then    [    AK : BL = AC : BC = k : 1,    ]    which means    [    AK = k cdot BL.    ] Thus, if one side is (k) times longer than the other, then the height dropped on that side will be ( frac{1}{k} ) times smaller than the height dropped on the other side.

Step 1: Understanding the new problem The square consists of unit squares, each with lattice points at the corners. The calculation can be focused on a single unit square and then generalized for the larger square.  Step 2: Setting up the equation Each lattice point affects an area within a radius d in a circle pattern. Since a lattice point is shared by four unit squares, a quarter of each circle's area affects one unit square. Thus, in one unit square, the influenced area is the area of one full circle of radius d. The area of a circle is pi d^2. For this area to be one third of the unit square's area, the equation is: [ pi d^2 = frac{1}{3} ]  Step 3: Solving for d Solving for d^2, we find: [ d^2 = frac{1}{3pi} ] Taking the square root of both sides, we get: [ d = frac{1}{sqrt{3pi}} ]  Step 4: Estimating sqrt{3pi} Using pi approx 3.14159, 3pi approx 9.42477.

For an ellipse given by:    [    frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1    ]    The distance from the center to each focus, pm c, is determined by the equation:    [    c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}    ]    where a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 1. Therefore,    [    c = sqrt{4 - 1} = sqrt{3}    ]    Hence, the coordinates of the foci are F_1(-sqrt{3}, 0) and F_2(sqrt{3}, 0). 3.

Find the number of odd coefficients of the polynomial\\r [ u_n(x) equal{} (x^2 plus{} x plus{} 1)^n.\\r ]","output":"To find the number of odd coefficients of the polynomial ( u_n(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^n ), we will work in the ring ((mathbb{Z}/2mathbb{Z})[x]). This means we consider the coefficients modulo 2, so the polynomial ( x^2 + x + 1 ) simplifies to ( x^2 + x + 1 ) in ((mathbb{Z}/2mathbb{Z})[x]). 1. **Base Case Analysis:**    Let's start by examining the polynomial for small values of ( n ):    [    u_1(x) = x^2 + x + 1    ]    [    u_2(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^2 = x^4 + x^2 + 1    ]    Here, we see that ( u_2(x) ) has the same form as ( u_1(x) ) but with higher powers of ( x ). 2. **General Form:**    We observe that the polynomial ( u_n(x) ) can be written as:    [    u_n(x) = sum_{k=0}^{2n} a_k x^k    ]    where ( a_k ) are the coefficients. We need to determine which of these coefficients are odd. 3. **Binary Representation:**    To find the number of odd coefficients, we need to consider the binary representation of ( n ). The polynomial ( (x^2 + x + 1)^n ) can be expanded using the multinomial theorem, and the coefficients ( a_k ) will be determined by the number of ways to choose terms from each factor such that the exponents sum to ( k ). 4. **Odd Coefficients:**    The key insight is that a coefficient ( a_k ) is odd if and only if the number of ways to form ( k ) using the exponents ( 0, 1, 2 ) from each factor is odd. This is equivalent to counting the number of solutions to the equation:    [    k = 2a + b + c quad text{(mod 2)}    ]    where ( a, b, c ) are the exponents chosen from each factor ( (x^2, x, 1) ). 5. **Pattern Recognition:**    By examining the binary representation of ( n ), we can determine the number of odd coefficients. Specifically, the number of odd coefficients in ( u_n(x) ) is given by ( 2^m ), where ( m ) is the number of 1's in the binary representation of ( n ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the number of odd coefficients of the polynomial ( u_n(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^n ) is ( 2^m ), where ( m ) is the number of 1's in the binary representation of ( n ).

Therefore, the time to complete one cycle for each bug is proportional to the perimeter of their respective triangles.     4. **Synchronization Check**:    Since both bugs start at the same point A and start their journey simultaneously but travel in different directions along path AC, let's consider the movement through the diagonal AC.     - For every complete cycle one bug makes, which brings it back to A, the other bug would have traversed its cycle and be at a specific point along its path.     - Specifically, during these entry points into A for the first bug, the second bug would have moved a certain distance depending on its cycle length.        We can compute the general positions of both bugs at any point in their cycles, knowing their speeds and the lengths they traverse. 5. **Evaluating Intersections**:    The idea is to evaluate whether, for any two given positions they start with, the bugs would ever be at the same position on diagonal AC at the same time.        - Since AB > CD, the movement of the second bug will not be a multiple of the movement of the first bug in their respective cycles. They will eventually need to cross paths on AC, simply due to the unequal perimeter path lengths combined with their equal speeds. 6. **Mathematical Proof of Intersection**:    Because the bugs' cycles are based on triangles within the trapezoid and both fundamental paths involve AC, which is common and diagonally symmetrical, we can iteratively check every cycle endpoint for one bug to observe if the other bug meets the diagonal path AC. Therefore, with their constant and equal speeds, along with the inequalities inherent in their path distances, they must meet at some point on the diagonal AC. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The two bugs will inevitably meet on the diagonal AC of the trapezoid.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Mark has a garden with flowers.

To begin, note that we start with one region, so ( u_0 = 1 ) and ( u_1 = 1 ). 4. Place an additional point, making it the ((n+1))-th point, and consider how many new regions this point creates. 5. Label the original ( n ) points from ( 1 ) to ( n ). Insert the ((n+1))-th point between the points labeled ( 1 ) and ( n ). 6.

A chord ( Gamma ) intersects ( C_k ) if one of its endpoints is to the right of ( C_k ) and the other is to the left of ( C_k ). This means we need to choose a point among the ( k-1 ) points to the right and one among the ( n-k ) points to the left. 8. The number of such intersecting chords (Gamma) is given by ( (k-1)(n-k) ). 9. Each intersection point created by ( C_k ) accounts for adding one more region. Hence, the total contribution of ( C_k ) to the number of new regions is ( (k-1)(n-k) + 1 ) (including ( C_k ) itself as a new separating chord). 10.

From the equation of the ellipse frac{x^2}{5}+y^{2}=1, we can deduce the semi-major axis a and the distance c between the center of the ellipse and each focus. The semi-major axis a is sqrt{5}, and since c^2 = a^2 - b^2, where b^2 = 1 (the coefficient of y^2), we find c^2 = 5 - 1 = 4, so c = 2.

Since ( angle ACB ) in an equilateral triangle is ( 60^circ ), and we want the angle ( angle ACB ) to be ( 30^circ ), we will use the property of circles and the inscribed angles theorem. 2. **Determine the Circle**:      Consider a circle with center ( C ) that passes through points ( A ) and ( B ). We know that the central angle ( angle ACB ) subtended by arc ( AB ) is ( 60^circ ) (since ( angle ACB = 2 times 30^circ )). Therefore, if we draw the arc that subtends this angle from the center of the circle, it will intersect points lying on the circumference exactly corresponding to the central angle ( 60^circ ). 3. **Identify Arc Points and Angles**:     According to the inscribed angle theorem, any point ( C ) on the circumference of this circle that is not the endpoint of ( overline{AB} ) will subtend ( overline{AB} ) under an angle measure of ( 30^circ ). This construction utilizes the fact that an inscribed angle is exactly half of the central angle subtending the same arc.  4. **Construction of Circular Arcs**:     We derive two arcs symmetrically placed with respect to ( overline{AB} ). These two arcs are placed symmetrically about the line segment ( AB ) considering the geometry of a circle. Different points on these arcs will all have a view angle of ( 30^circ ) for the segment ( overline{AB} ). 5. **Conclusion of figure**:     These two arcs make up the locus of points ( C ) from which segment ( overline{AB} ) is seen under the angle of ( 30^circ ). Points inside of this figure sub tend a larger angle, whereas points outside sub tend a smaller angle. Therefore, the final figure will consist of these two arcs culminating in a symmetric closed shape around ( AB ).

Let's break down the statements given to determine which one is incorrect: - **Statement A**: It mentions that in simple random sampling, individuals are randomly selected one by one from the population. This statement aligns with the core principle of simple random sampling, where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. - **Statement B**: It suggests that the population from which the sample is drawn can be infinite. However, in the context of simple random sampling, the population is considered to be finite. This is because, for the sampling to be truly random and for each individual to have an equal chance of selection, the total number of individuals in the population must be known. - **Statement C**: It states that in simple random sampling, it is equally likely to be selected. This accurately reflects the essence of simple random sampling, where every individual in the population has the same probability of being chosen for the sample. - **Statement D**: It indicates that sampling can be done with or without replacement, which is correct. In simple random sampling, whether you replace the chosen individual before selecting the next one (sampling with replacement) or not (sampling without replacement) is a matter of the specific study design, but both approaches are compatible with the principles of simple random sampling.

Now, let's use the sine law to rewrite b and c in terms of their respective angles and side a: b = frac{a sin B}{sin A} and c = frac{a sin C}{sin A}. Substitute these expressions into the given equation: frac{a sin B}{sin A} cos C + frac{a sin C}{sin A} cos B = a sin A. Dividing both sides by a, we get: sin B cos C + sin C cos B = sin A sin A. Applying the sine sum formula (sin(B + C) = sin B cos C + sin C cos B), we get: sin(B + C) = sin^2 A. Since A, B, and C are angles of a triangle, we know that A + B + C = 180^circ, which implies B + C = 180^circ - A. Therefore, sin(180^circ - A) = sin^2 A. Using the cofunction identity, sin(180^circ - A) = sin A, we have: sin A = sin^2 A. Since sin A neq 0, we can divide both sides by sin A, which gives us: 1 = sin A.

This helps in analyzing the problem using binary sequences. 2. **Case 1: ( n ) is odd**:     - **Invariance Modulo 2**: When ( n ) is odd, the sum of the numbers (heads as 0 and tails as 1) is invariant modulo 2. This means that the sum of the sequence remains either even or odd after any number of operations.     - **Equivalence Classes**: Since the sum modulo 2 is invariant, there are at least two equivalence classes: one for sequences with an even sum and one for sequences with an odd sum.     - **Reduction to Constant Sequence**: To show that we can always obtain a constant sequence (all heads or all tails), consider a non-constant sequence. Divide it into maximal contiguous blocks of equal elements. Since ( n ) is odd, the number of blocks must be even (otherwise, the sum of the lengths of the blocks would be odd, contradicting the total length ( n )).

This is because the sum of the elements is even, and thus it can be split into two equal parts. 3. **Construct a subset sum problem:**    We need to find a subset (S subseteq {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}) such that the sum of the elements in (S) is equal to half of the total sum, i.e., (frac{1}{2}(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n)). 4. **Use the subset sum algorithm:**    The subset sum problem is a well-known problem in computer science, which can be solved using dynamic programming.

We'll also suggest additional types of expenses that might be relevant in this context and provide potential ways to economize on them when applicable. 1. **Fixed Expenses**:     - These are necessary and ongoing expenses that are essential for the business. Examples include:         - Utility payments (electricity, water, etc.)         - Loan payments         - Taxes     - Such expenses cannot be avoided or delayed as they are mandatory for the operation and legal compliance of the business. 2. **Variable Expenses**:     - These are non-essential expenses that can arise from time to time and can be reduced or deferred without significantly impacting the business. Examples include:         - Entertainment         - Travel         - Purchasing non-essential items         - Services and rentals like renting professional video cameras         - Maintenance of the blog (domain payments)     - Such expenses can be managed more flexibly, and savings can be realized by making strategic changes. # Analysis of Given Expenses:  Expenses that can be economized: 1. **Payment for home internet and internet traffic**:     - Switching to a more cost-effective plan.     - Using internet services more economically. 2. **Travel expenses**:     - Booking tickets with discounts.     - Traveling via more economical means, such as hitchhiking or using rented cars. 3. **Renting professional video cameras for a year**:     - Renting cameras for shorter periods or under better conditions to save costs. 4. **Domain payment for blog maintenance**:     - Selecting a cheaper domain hosting service to reduce ongoing maintenance costs. 5. **Visiting coffee shops (4 times a month)**:     - Reducing the frequency of visits to 2 times a month.  Expenses that cannot be economized: 1. **Loan payments**:     - Essential as missing these payments can lead to significant penalties and financial repercussions. It's mandatory to meet these obligations timely. 2. **Tax payments**:     - These are fixed and compulsory. Paying taxes is a civic duty, and non-payment can lead to legal consequences. 3. **Courses for qualification improvement in blogger school (onsite training)**:     - Fixed price due to the uniqueness of the school in the city. Reducing costs here is not feasible due to the lack of alternatives. # Suggested Additional Expenses and Economizing Methods: 1. **Professional development workshops**:     - Instead of attending expensive workshops, opt for online courses or webinars that offer similar content at a lower cost. 2. **Marketing and advertising costs**:     - Switch to more cost-effective advertising methods such as social media marketing or collaborations with other bloggers for mutual promotion. 3. **Office supplies**:     - Buy supplies in bulk or during sales to reduce costs. 4. **Subscription services (e.g., software, analytic tools)**:     - Evaluate and potentially downgrade or cancel non-essential subscriptions. # Conclusion: In summary, fixed expenses such as loan payments, taxes, and certain essential courses cannot be economized.

Some of the data is shown in the table below: | Selling Price x (yuan/unit) | 60 | 65 | 70 | ||||| | Sales Volume y (units)       | 1400 | 1300 | 1200 | (1) Find the functional expression between y and x; (no need to find the range of the independent variable x)<br/>(2) The wholesale market wants to make a profit of 24000 yuan from the sales of this type of shirt each month, while also providing customers with affordable prices. How should they price this type of shirt?<br/>(3) The price department stipulates that the profit per shirt should not exceed 30% of the purchase price. If the total monthly profit from this type of shirt is w yuan, what price should be set to maximize the profit? What is the maximum profit?","output":"# Solution:  Part 1: Finding the Functional Expression Between y and x Given the relationship between y and x can be expressed as y=kx+b, we have two equations based on the data provided: 1. For x=60, y=1400: 60k + b = 1400 2. For x=65, y=1300: 65k + b = 1300 Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get: - 60k + b - (65k + b) = 1400 - 1300 - -5k = 100 - k = -20 Substituting k = -20 into the first equation: - 60(-20) + b = 1400 - -1200 + b = 1400 - b = 2600 Thus, the functional expression between y and x is y = -20x + 2600.  Part 2: Pricing the Shirt for a 24000 Yuan Profit Given the profit equation (x-50)(-20x+2600)=24000, we solve for x: - -20x^2 + 2600x - 1000x + 50000 = 24000 - -20x^2 + 1600x + 26000 = 0 - x^2 - 80x - 1300 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation, we find x_1 = 70 and x_2 = 110. Since we aim to provide customers with affordable prices, the price should be set to 70 yuan.  Part 3: Maximizing Profit Under the Stipulated Conditions The total monthly profit w can be expressed as w = (x-50)(-20x+2600) = -20(x-90)^2 + 32000. To ensure the profit per shirt does not exceed 30% of the purchase price and the selling price is not lower than the purchase price, we have: - 50 leq x leq 65, because (x-50)/50 leq 30% Within this range, the profit w is maximized when x = 65. Substituting x = 65 into the profit equation, we find the maximum profit w = 19500 yuan. Therefore, the price should be set at boxed{65} yuan to yield the maximum profit of boxed{19500} yuan."},{"instruction":"A deck of forty cards consists of four 1's, four 2's,..., and four 10's.

The amount of milk in the mixture is (2/3) * 90 litres = 60 litres. The amount of water in the mixture is (1/3) * 90 litres = 30 litres.

Now, we are told that an unknown liquid L is added such that the amount of liquid L is 1/3 of the amount of milk and the amount of milk is double the amount of water in the mixture. Let's denote the amount of liquid L as L litres. Since the amount of milk is double the amount of water, we have: Milk = 2 * Water Milk = 2 * 20 litres = 40 litres But we initially had 60 litres of milk, so no milk has been removed or added. Therefore, the amount of milk remains 60 litres. Now, since the amount of liquid L is 1/3 of the amount of milk, we have: L = (1/3) * Milk L = (1/3) * 60 litres = 20 litres So, 20 litres of liquid L is added to the mixture. Finally, let's determine the final milk-to-water ratio. We have 60 litres of milk and 20 litres of water (after evaporation and before adding liquid L).

This can be shown by projecting each of the points from the center onto the outer edge of the circle without changing whether the triangle covers the center. If the three points lie on a semicircle, the center is outside the triangle; otherwise, the center is inside the triangle. 2. **Claim: The center can only be covered by either 2 or 0 triangles:**    - **Case 1: There is 1 triangle covering the center:**      Assume triangle ( triangle ABC ) contains the center ( O ).

If 3 or 4 triangles cover the center, this means two triangles sharing a diagonal cover the center.

The vertex of the parabola (highest point since it opens downwards) lies on the axis of symmetry, which we've found to be x = m = n-1. 2. Since q < p and the parabola opens downwards, point C (with y-coordinate p) must be closer to the axis of symmetry than point B (with y-coordinate q), implying n must be positioned in such a way that C is closer to x = n-1 than B is. 3. When x = 0, y = -3, which is a point on the parabola. Given -3 < q < p, and considering the symmetry and the downward opening of the parabola, we deduce that n-1 (the axis of symmetry) must be closer to C than to B and the origin. 4. Solving the inequalities 3 < n < 4 or n > 6 ensures that the axis of symmetry is positioned correctly relative to points B and C to satisfy the condition -3 < q < p.

These work rates are the fractions of the job they can complete in one day. From the given information, we have: 1. A, B, and C together can complete the job in 8 days, so their combined work rate is 1/8 of the job per day. [ A_work + B_work + C_work = 1/8 ] 2. A and B together can complete the job in 12 days, so their combined work rate is 1/12 of the job per day. [ A_work + B_work = 1/12 ] 3. A can complete the job alone in 24 days, so A's work rate is 1/24 of the job per day. [ A_work = 1/24 ] Now, we can use these equations to find B's work rate. First, let's subtract equation 3 from equation 2 to find B's work rate: [ (A_work + B_work) - A_work = 1/12 - 1/24 ] [ B_work = 1/12 - 1/24 ] [ B_work = 2/24 - 1/24 ] [ B_work = 1/24 ] So, B can complete 1/24 of the job per day.

[ C_work = 1/48 ] Now, let's substitute A_work and C_work back into equation 1 to find B's work rate: [ 1/24 + B_work + 1/48 = 1/8 ] To solve for B_work, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 24, 48, and 8 is 48. So, we convert all fractions to have a denominator of 48: [ 2/48 + B_work + 1/48 = 6/48 ] Now, we can combine the terms with B_work: [ B_work + 3/48 = 6/48 ] [ B_work = 6/48 - 3/48 ] [ B_work = 3/48 ] This simplifies to: [ B_work = 1/16 ] So, B can complete 1/16 of the job per day. To find out how many days it takes for B to complete the job alone, we take the reciprocal of B's work rate: [ B_time = 1 / B_work ] [ B_time = 1 / (1/16) ] [ B_time = 16 ] Therefore, it would take B alone boxed{16}  days to complete the job."},{"instruction":"farmer has an apple orchard consisting of fuji and gala apple trees . due to high winds this year 10 % of his trees cross pollinated . the number of his trees that are pure fuji plus the cross  pollinated ones totals 204 , while 3 / 4 of all his trees are pure fuji . how many of his trees are pure gala ?","output":"Let's denote the total number of trees as T, the number of pure Fuji trees as F, and the number of pure Gala trees as G.

The expression for y is a quadratic equation in terms of x, and we're interested in its value for x gt 3.  To find out the range of y, we look at the minimum point of the quadratic equation y=x^{2}-4x+5. The vertex of a parabola given by y=ax^2+bx+c is at x=-frac{b}{2a}. In our case, a=1, b=-4, so the vertex is at x=2. Given x gt 3, the value of y for any x in A is greater than the value at the vertex. The value of y at x=2 is 2^2 - 4*2 + 5 = 1. However, since x gt 3, we should evaluate the function at the boundary of A, which is at x=3. Substituting x=3 into the equation, we get: [ begin{align*} y &= 3^2 - 4*3 + 5  &= 9 - 12 + 5  &= 2 end{align*} ] This shows that for x > 3, y will be greater than 2.

Set A includes all x such that x gt 3, and set B includes all y such that y gt 2. The union of these conditions covers all numbers greater than 2, since the condition x gt 3 is included within the range of y gt 2.

The shopkeeper sells 750 metres of cloth for 45,000, which means the selling price per metre is: 45,000 / 750 metres = 60 per metre The shopkeeper incurs a loss of 7 per metre, so the cost price per metre before the loss would be: 60 (selling price per metre) + 7 (loss per metre) = 67 per metre Now, we know that this price of 67 per metre is after a 5% discount. Let's denote the original price before the discount as ( P ). The discount is 5% of the original price, so the price after the discount is 95% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation as: ( 0.95P = 67 ) To find the original price ( P ) before the discount, we divide 67 by 0.95: ( P = 67 / 0.95 ) ( P = 70.53 ) (rounded to two decimal places) This is the cost price per metre before the discount. Now, we need to find the original cost price before tax. Let's denote the original cost price before tax as ( C ). The local tax rate is 8%, so the cost price after tax is 108% of the original cost price before tax. We can write the equation as: ( 1.08C = 70.53 ) To find the original cost price ( C ) before tax, we divide 70.53 by 1.08: ( C = 70.53 / 1.08 ) ( C = 65.31 ) (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, the original cost price for one metre of cloth before tax and discount is approximately boxed{65.31} ."},{"instruction":"f a < b < 0, then (　　) A. frac{1}{a} < frac{1}{b}   B. ab > b^2   C. 0 < frac{a}{b} < 1   D. frac{b}{a} > frac{a}{b}","output":"For option A: Given that a < b < 0, this implies frac{1}{a} > frac{1}{b} since the order of inequalities is reversed when taking reciprocals of negative numbers.

We are asked to prove that in a set of 2n points (where n > 1), if there are at least n^2 + 1 line segments connecting these points, then at least one triangle is formed. Further, we need to prove that for each n, it's possible to have 2n points connected by n^2 line segments without forming any triangles.  Proof for Part (1): 1.1 Let's denote the proposition by T_n: If 2n points are connected by at least n^2 + 1 line segments, then at least one triangle is formed. 1.2 **Base Case**: For n=2. (2 cdot 2 = 4) points must be connected by at least (2^2 + 1 = 5) line segments. - In a graph with 4 points, the maximum possible line segments without forming a triangle is binom{4}{2} - 1 = 5. - But this results in at least one triangle since the number of line segments exceeds binom{4}{2} = 6. If we try to avoid a triangle, the maximum number of lines we can have is 5, but here we need 6 lines, so a triangle is inevitable. Thus, T_2 holds true. 1.3 **Inductive Step**: Assume T_k is true for some k, i.e., if 2k points are connected by k^2 + 1 line segments, then these points must form a triangle. 1.4 We need to prove T_{k+1}: For 2(k+1) points, if they are connected by at least (k+1)^2 + 1 line segments, then they form at least one triangle. - Consider 2(k+1) points with at least (k+1)^2 + 1 line segments. Divide these points into two groups such as A_1 and A_2 with 2k points, note line segments within group A_1 and those connected with A_2.  1.5 Suppose p points in A connect to a point A from group G, and q points connect to a point B from G.    - If p + q > 2k, there must be a triangular connection since one point in G is connected more than threshold linking triangles.    - If p + q leq 2k, then the sum within each group is still intact forming k^2+1 must trigger the triangle formation based on assumed premise.     Since in either case, the groups generate line segment surplus ensuring triangles even in aggregation totals, concluding proposition coverage. Thus, by mathematical induction, T_n is verified as true for all n > 1.  Proof for Part (2): 1.6 Consider 2n points divided into two sets S and T with n points each. Every point in S connects with every point in T, making exactly n^2 line segments. 1.7 In each set S, T, no three points can form a triangle separately or collectively, thereby:    - Shows structure doesn’t permit circuit of lines route composition towards triangle mix, just straights.

Let's begin by denoting k=frac{y-(-2)}{x-(-1)}. In this context, k represents the slope of the line connecting a moving point P on the circle {x}^{2}+{y}^{2}=1 and a fixed point A(-1,-2). When the line is tangent to the circle, the slope k can be determined. The equation of the tangent line can be written as y+2=k(x+1), which reduces to the general form kx-y+k-2=0. To establish an equation in terms of k, we use the condition for a line and a circle to be tangent: frac{|k-2|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} = 1 Solving this equation yields k = frac{3}{4}. From the given conditions and the position of point P, we know that the limiting slope k is frac{3}{4}. Since the x-coordinate of point A is the same as the x-coordinate of the point where the unit circle intersects the x-axis, the angle of inclination of the tangent line passing through point A is 90^{circ}.

Thus, the final number in base 13 is boxed{103_{13}}."},{"instruction":"Four squares have areas 25, 64, 121, and 196.

Each pair of telephones is connected by at most one wire, and each telephone is connected by at most 3 wires. To color these wires so that no two wires connected to the same telephone share the same color, what is the minimum number of different colors needed?","output":"1. **Interpret the problem**:     - We have 20 telephone machines, represented as vertices in a graph.     - Each telephone machine can connect to at most 3 other machines (vertices of degree at most 3).     - There is at most one connecting line between any two telephone machines (edges).     - We need to color these lines such that lines from any single machine have different colors.     - The task is to determine the minimum number of colors required to achieve this. 2. **Graph interpretation**:     - Let's represent each telephone machine as a vertex of a graph.     - If two machines are connected by a line, there is an edge between the corresponding vertices.     - The graph has 20 vertices, and each vertex can have a degree of at most 3. 3. **Coloring edges**:     - We need to color the edges such that no two edges incident to the same vertex have the same color.     - This requirement implies a need for a proper edge coloring of the graph. 4. **Upper and Lower Bounds**:     - **Upper Bound**: By Vizing's theorem, a simple graph of maximum degree Delta needs either Delta or Delta + 1 colors for a proper edge coloring. Here, Delta = 3, so we may need either 3 or 4 colors.     - **Lower Bound**: Since each vertex can connect to 3 other vertices, we can't guarantee that 3 colors are sufficient without verifying it on this specific graph. 5. **Detailed Solution**:     - Consider the constraints:         - There are 20 vertices.         - Each vertex (telephone machine) connects to at most 3 other vertices.          - To satisfy the requirement that lines from any one telephone machine have different colors, we inspect a few specific structures (cycles and chains):         - **Cycle**: Any cycle in this graph must respect the degree constraints. Since every vertex has a degree of 3, the cycles that occur in the maximum set would dictate coloring complexity.         - **Chains**: Chains can be simplified, but in combination with cycles, distinguishable cases complete the complexity.     - We start by analyzing if 3 colors suffice:         - Since we know each vertex is involved in at most 3 edges, a degree-3 vertex coloring problem suggests testing a 3-color strategy.         - However, if cycles' lengths aren't even, at least one cycle will demand an extra color. The extra handling guarantees the possibility of up to Delta + 1 = 4 colors.          - **Step-by-Step Process Verification**:         - **Step 1**: Find the longest cycle.         - **Step 2**: Color its edges using either 3 colors if possible, otherwise involve a 4th color for odd lengths.                  - **Step 3**: Remove the cycle and all dangling edges (edges leading out from vertices of the cycle). Analyze remaining parts for simplifiable sections.                  - **Step 4**: Continually break down the new longest cycle until none remains.                  - **Step 5**: After breaking cycles, inspect chains or isolated vertices:             - Ensure new colors if it yields three edges ending at a vertex requiring a non-redundant color.         - **Analysis for Eccentric case**: A vertex with 3 edges can't consistently get colored if neighbors share required remaining only color distinct but overlapping in next analysis chains. 6. **Conclusion**:     - From comprehensive step reductions and infallible combinations of needing distinct colors:         - **Four-color solution** reliably accommodates the constraints:                  [         boxed{4}         ]"},{"instruction":"Given a circle that is tangent to the yaxis at the point (0, 3) and intersects the xaxis with a segment length of 8, the standard equation of the circle is ______.","output":"According to the problem, it is known that the circle is tangent to the y-axis at the point (0, 3),   so we set the center of the circle as (a, 3), then its radius r = |a|,   and since the length of the segment that the circle intersects with the x-axis is 8, we have r^2 = left( frac{8}{2} right)^2 + 3^2 = 25,   which means r = 5,   thus a = pm 5,   therefore, the equation of the circle is (x + 5)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25 or (x - 5)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25.   According to the problem, setting the center of the circle as (a, 3), it can be analyzed that its radius r = |a|.

When the train crosses the man standing on the platform, it only has to cover its own length, as the man can be considered as a point relative to the length of the train.

The cost includes a fixed R&D cost of 1.5 million yuan and a variable cost of 380 yuan per unit. Since x is in thousands of units, the total cost is 380x + 150 (in million yuan). Therefore, the profit S can be calculated as: [ begin{align*} S &= xR - 380x - 150  &= x(500 - 2x) - 380x - 150  &= 500x - 2x^2 - 380x - 150  &= -2x^2 + 120x - 150 end{align*} ] **Case 2:** When x > 20, The sales revenue R changes to R = 370 + frac{2140}{x} - frac{6250}{x^2}.

Thus, at x = 20, S reaches its maximum for this interval: [ S = -2(20^2) + 120 cdot 20 - 150 = 1450 ] **Case 2:** For x > 20, Using AM-GM inequality on x + frac{625}{x}: [ S = -10left(x + frac{625}{x}right) + 1990 leq -10 cdot 2sqrt{x cdot frac{625}{x}} + 1990 = 1490 ] The equality holds when x = frac{625}{x}, which implies x = 25.

They can walk in either direction and change direction upon collision. We need to determine the maximum number of collisions that can occur, assuming the total number of collisions is finite. 2. **Key Insight:**    The order of the ants along the line does not change. Denote by ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n ) the respective speeds of ants ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) in this order. If ( v_{i-1} < v_i > v_{i+1} ) for some ( i in {2, ldots, n-1} ), then ant ( i ) can catch up with ants ( i-1 ) or ( i+1 ) irrespective of their directions of motion, leading to an infinite number of collisions. Hence, for the number of collisions to be finite, the speeds must be ordered such that:    - ( v_1 geq v_2 geq cdots geq v_n ) (all ants are moving in the same direction with non-increasing speeds), or    - ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_{k-1} > v_k leq cdots leq v_n ) for some ( k in {2, ldots, n-1} ). 3. **Claim:**    If ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_m ), then ants ( m-1 ) and ( m ) collide at most ( m-1 ) times. 4. **Proof of the Claim:**    - **Base Case:** For ( m = 1 ), the statement is trivial as there are no collisions.    - **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for ( m-1 ). Consider ( m ) ants with ( v_1 geq cdots geq v_m ). Ants ( m-1 ) and ( m ) can only collide if ( v_{m-1} geq v_m ). Between successive collisions with ant ( m ), ant ( m-1 ) must reverse direction by colliding with ant ( m-2 ). By the inductive hypothesis, ants ( m-1 ) and ( m-2 ) collide at most ( m-2 ) times. Therefore, ants ( m ) and ( m-1 ) collide at most ( (m-2) + 1 = m-1 ) times.

For ( varepsilon = 0 ), collisions occur such that ants ( m ) and ( m+1 ) collide exactly ( m ) times for ( m = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ).

Each move always alternates the color of the square the knight occupies (from black to white or from white to black). 3. **Calculate number of moves:**    Since the knight must cover all 64 squares exactly once, it needs to make 63 valid moves (as each move shifts to a new square). 4. **Color analysis of the chessboard:**    The chessboard is an 8x8 grid where squares alternate in color.    - Starting from a1, which is a black square, the pattern of colors looks like this:      ( a1 equiv text{black}, a2 equiv text{white}, a3 equiv text{black}, ... ) 5. **Establish knight's move pattern:**    Every move by a knight switches its position from a black square to a white square or vice versa.

Continuing this process, we see that  [ f_{11}(x) = f_{29}(x), ] [ f(x) = f_{19}(x), ]  [ x = f_{18}(x), ] [ f^{-1}(x) = f_{17}(x) ] 6. Thus, [ f_{16}(x) = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(x)) ] 7. Now we find the inverse function of ( f(x) ). Set ( y = f(x) ), so ( y = frac{1 + x}{2 - x} ):    [ y(2 - x) = 1 + x ]    [ 2y - yx = 1 + x ]    [ 2y - 1 = x + yx ]    [ 2y - 1 = x(1 + y) ]    [ x = frac{2y - 1}{1 + y} ] 8. Therefore, the inverse function is [ f^{-1}(x) = frac{2x - 1}{x + 1} ] 9. Now, calculate the second iterate of the inverse function: [ f_{16}(x) = f^{-1}(f^{-1}(x)) ] 10. Substitute into the inverse function: [ f^{-1}left(f^{-1}(x)right) = f^{-1}left(frac{2x - 1}{x + 1}right) ] 11. Set ( y = frac{2x - 1}{x + 1} ), then [ f^{-1}(y) = frac{2y - 1}{y + 1} ] 12.

We start with the tetrahedron (ABCD) and the sphere inscribed in it. This sphere touches the faces (ABC), (ABD), (ACD), and (BCD) at points (A'), (B'), (C'), and (D') respectively. 2. Given that the segments (AA') and (BB') intersect, denote their intersection point by (P), which lies on the sphere by given conditions. 3. This implies that (P) also lies within the planes of the faces (ABA') and (BBA'). Since (P) is intersection point:     AB text{ and } A'B' text{ could be intersecting or parallel. Let P be the intersecting point.}  4. Because (P) lies outside the dihedral angle at edge (CD), if we consider the plane (CDP), it does not intersect the inscribed sphere. 5. Therefore, it is possible to apply a projective transformation that preserves spheres and maps the plane (CDP) to one that is infinitely distant. The idea is this transformation retains the spacial relationship while simplifying geometry for analysis. 6. Under such a transformation, the segment (A'B') can be visualized as the diameter of the sphere, with (AB) being parallel to it.      - To better understand, consider a plane orthogonal to (ABA'B'). 7. Since (P), the intersection of (AA') and (BB'), lies on the sphere:     - This implies the distance from the center of the sphere to (AB) is twice the radius of the sphere.     begin{align*}     text{angle between } & text{the planes of } ABC text{ and } ABD = 60^circ,      a & text{rc connecting the points } C' text{ and } D' forms an angle of } 120^circ text{.}     end{align*} 8.

Observing a projection orthogonal to the plane shows that the planes containing (AB), passing through (C) and (D), respectively, intersect precisely on the sphere, preserving angular and planar relationships. 10.
