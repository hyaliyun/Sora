Given conditions lead to the following equations: - From the center of the circle lying on the line x-3y=0, we have a-3b=0 (1). - Since the circle is tangent to the y-axis, and its center lies on x-3y=0, the radius r is equal to the absolute value of the x-coordinate of the center, thus r=|a| (2). - The line x=y intersects the circle to form a segment of length 2sqrt{7}. The midpoint of this segment is the projection of the center of the circle onto the line x=y, which gives us the distance from the center to the line as frac{|a-b|}{sqrt{2}}. Therefore, the equation left(frac{|a-b|}{sqrt{2}}right)^{2}+7=r^{2} (3) holds. From equation (1), we substitute a=3b into equations (2) and (3), yielding r=3|b|.

We will solve this problem by encoding each permutation with symbols to determine possible configurations.

A triangle that can be divided into isosceles triangles by diagonals is itself an isosceles triangle (or equilateral, which is a special case of isosceles). Thus, it has at least two equal sides. Therefore, the statement holds for n = 3. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume that for some k geq 3, any convex polygon with k sides that can be divided into isosceles triangles by non-intersecting diagonals must have at least two equal sides. 3. **Induction Step:**    Let P be a convex polygon with n = k+1 sides. We need to show that P, which can be divided into isosceles triangles by non-intersecting diagonals, also has at least two equal sides.    Consider one of these dividing diagonals d in polygon P. This diagonal d divides P into two polygons: a triangle T and a (n-1)-gon P' (where n-1 = k).    - If the triangle T's two equal sides are sides of P, then we are done as T is isosceles and shares its equal sides with P.        - If not, the triangle T must share the diagonal d as one of its equal sides. In this case, P' remains a convex polygon with k sides, which can also be divided into isosceles triangles by non-intersecting diagonals.      By the induction hypothesis, in P', there exist at least two equal sides. If these sides are not the diagonal d, then P' has at least two sides that are equal, and hence P also has at least two sides that are equal.      If those two equal sides in P' are the diagonal d, then these two sides are also parts of P, and thus P has at least two equal sides which are d.

Therefore, one of ( q_1, q_2, q_3 ) must be divisible by 3 because the sequence ( q_i equiv q_{i-1} - 1 pmod{3} ) means eventually one of them must fulfill this condition.  3. **Determining Sequence Values:**    - Let's start with the simplest assumption for ( q_0 ), say ( q_0 = 1 ) which is obviously a power of the prime 1:      [      q_1 = (q_0 - 1)^3 + 3 = 0^3 + 3 = 3      ]      Here ( q_1 = 3 ) which is ( 3^1 ), a power of the prime 3.    - Next value:      [      q_2 = (q_1 - 1)^3 + 3 = 2^3 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11      ]      Here, ( q_2 = 11 ), which is ( 11^1 ), a power of the prime 11.    - Now, evaluate the next in the sequence:      [      q_3 = (q_2 - 1)^3 + 3 = 10^3 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003      ]      Checking if 1003 is a power of a prime:      [      1003 = 17 times 59      ]      Since 1003 is not a power of a single prime, the condition fails at ( q_3 ). 4. **Conclusion:**    - The values identified indicate that ( q_3 = 1003 ) is not a power of a single prime, so the sequence can only go up to ( q_2 ) with each term being a power of a prime.    - Therefore, the largest possible value of ( n ) that satisfies the condition is: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the smallest natural number ( n ) such that the sum of the digits of each of the numbers ( n ) and ( n+1 ) is divisible by 17.","output":"To find the smallest natural number ( n ) such that the sum of the digits of both ( n ) and ( n+1 ) is divisible by 17, we need to consider the following steps: 1. **Observation of Digit Sums**:     - For two consecutive numbers ( n ) and ( n+1 ), their digit sums generally differ by 1 unless ( n ) ends in a 9.     - If ( n ) does not end in 9, the sums of the digits of ( n ) and ( n+1 ) will differ by exactly 1, and thus cannot both be divisible by 17 simultaneously. 2. **Construct ( n ) with Ending 9's**:     - Consider ( n ) that ends with several 9's (i.e., ( n = overline{m99ldots 9} )), where ( m ) is a natural number and ( k ) is the number of 9's at the end.     - Let ( s ) be the sum of the digits of ( m ). Hence, the sum of the digits of ( n ) is ( s + 9k ). 3. **Sum of Digits for ( n ) and ( n+1 )**:     - The sum of the digits of ( n ) is ( s + 9k ).     - When adding 1 to ( n ), all trailing 9’s become 0’s and the next digit increases by 1. Hence, the sum of the digits of ( n+1 ) is ( s + 1 ). 4. **Divisibility by 17**:     - According to the problem’s condition, both ( s + 9k ) and ( s + 1 ) must be divisible by 17.     - Therefore, we have:       [       s + 1 equiv 0 pmod{17} implies s equiv 16 pmod{17}       ]     - Since ( s ) must be the sum of digits and must be at least 16. 5. **Finding the Smallest ( m ) Not Ending in 9**:     - The smallest number ( m ) with digits summing to 16 and not ending in 9 is 88 (where ( 8 + 8 = 16 )).     - Now we need to check the values of ( k ) such that ( s + 9k equiv 0 pmod{17} ). 6. **Determining ( k )**:     - We already have ( s + 1 equiv 0 pmod{17} ) and thus ( 9k - 1 equiv 0 pmod{17} ).     - Solving ( 9k - 1 equiv 0 implies 9k equiv 1 pmod{17} ), we find the smallest positive ( k ):       [       9k equiv 1 pmod{17}       ]     - The multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 17 is 2 since ( 9 times 2 equiv 18 equiv 1 pmod{17} ). Thus, ( k = 2 ). 7. **Constructing ( n )**:     - Plugging ( m = 88 ) and ( k = 2 ), we construct:       [       n = 88 + 99 = 8899       ] 8. **Verification**:     - Sum of the digits of ( 8899 ) is ( 8 + 8 + 9 + 9 = 34 ).     - Sum of the digits of ( 8900 ) is ( 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 17 ).     - Both 34 and 17 are divisible by 17.

[     angle XOY = angle QOR = 180^circ - angle BOQ - angle ROA     ]     - The angles ( angle BOQ ) and ( angle ROA ) are subtended by arcs ( AQ ) and ( BR ), respectively, and each is twice their corresponding inscribed angles ( angle BAQ ) and ( angle RBA ):     [     angle BOQ = 2 cdot angle BAQ = 2alpha quad text{and} quad angle ROA = 2 cdot angle RBA = 2beta     ]     Therefore,     [     angle XOY = 180^circ - 2alpha - 2beta     ] 3. **Angle ( angle XPY )**:     - This angle is exactly ( 180^circ ) minus the sum of the other two angles in ( triangle APB ):     [     angle XPY = 180^circ - (alpha + beta)     ] 4. **Condition for Cyclic Quadrilateral**:     - For a quadrilateral ( OXPY ) to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be ( 180^circ ):     [     angle XOY + angle XPY = 360^circ - 3(alpha + beta)     ]     Setting the sum equal to ( 180^circ ):     [     360^circ - 3(alpha + beta) = 180^circ     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     3(alpha + beta) = 180^circ quad Rightarrow quad alpha + beta = 60^circ     ]     - Therefore, ( angle APB = 120^circ ). 5. **Locus of Points ( P )**:     - The points ( P ) must lie on the interior points of the two arcs of the circle that subtend an angle ( 120^circ ) at the diameter endpoints ( A ) and ( B ).  6. **Conclusion**:     - The locus of points ( P ) is the set of points that form the two arcs where ( angle APB = 120^circ ), excluding the endpoints ( A ) and ( B ).

This disk is divided into two sectors by cutting along two radii. These sectors are then transformed into conical frustums.

Now, let's convert the final cost to Euros (EUR) and British Pounds (GBP): 1 USD = 0.85 EUR, so 41.04 in EUR is 41.04 * 0.85 = €34.884. 1 USD = 0.75 GBP, so 41.04 in GBP is 41.04 * 0.75 = £30.78.

This information tells us that (M) divides (CD) into two equal parts. 2. **Extend (AM) to point (P) such that (AM = MP)**:    - Extend the line (AM) beyond (M).    - Measure (AM) and mark point (P) on the extension of (AM) such that (AM = MP). 3. **Verify congruence of triangles**:    - Since (M) is the midpoint, (CM = MD).    - Given (AM = MP) and ( angle CM P = angle DMA) (by vertical angles), triangles (triangle PMC) and (triangle AMD) are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) postulate. 4. **Establish parallel lines and equal segments**:    - Because the triangles are congruent, (angle CPM = angle DAM).    - This implies (PA parallel CD) and hence (PC parallel AD). 5. **Place point (B)**:    - Since (B) lies on the line extended out from (N) such that (CB = BN), and since ( Delta NAND = PC, text {P} lies on B), Consider setting (PB = BC), hence using magical ruler correctly placeing point B. 6. **Place point (C)**:    - From point P using the magical ruler measure as (PA = PC consequently construct C correctly without errors checking obviation test. 7. **Further Construct Point (D)**:    - To locate point (D) extend (CM) from M set the second part from proper measuring using the magical ruler measure consistently on the same length hence placing D similar to P. In conclusion, by following these reconstruction steps, Laura will be able to accurately reconstruct the original parallelogram (ABCD) using her magical ruler.

Which player has a winning strategy if Grisha goes first?","output":"1. **Analyze the Problem Statement:**    The game starts with (10) units on the board. Grisha and Gleb take turns, with Grisha going first. Grisha squares some numbers on the board, while Gleb increases some numbers by (1). If any number on the board becomes divisible by (2023) within (10000) turns, Gleb wins; otherwise, Grisha wins. 2. **Prime Factorization of (2023):**    Observe that (2023 = 7 cdot 17^2). 3. **Grisha's Strategy:**    Grisha will divide the numbers on the board into two groups of (5) each. Grisha squares numbers from the first group on one turn and from the second group on the next turn. We need to analyze the possible remainders when the squared numbers are divided by (7). 4. **Quadratic Residues Modulo (7):**    The quadratic residues modulo (7) (i.e., the possible remainders when squaring any integer) can only result in the values (0, 1, 2,) and (4). To exhibit this:    [    begin{aligned}    &0^2 equiv 0 pmod{7},     &1^2 equiv 1 pmod{7},     &2^2 equiv 4 pmod{7},     &3^2 equiv 2 pmod{7},     &4^2 equiv 2 pmod{7},     &5^2 equiv 4 pmod{7},     &6^2 equiv 1 pmod{7}.    end{aligned}    ] 5. **Behavior After Gleb's Move:**    When Gleb increases these numbers by (1), the possible remainders modulo (7) will be:    [    {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.    ]    Since Grisha can always control the number to be non-zero by his squaring, the results will never be zero modulo (7). This guarantees the number is not divisible by (7). 6. **Conclusion:**    Since the resultant numbers from Grisha's moves (squaring) do not produce any residue that will be zero modulo (7) (and Gleb's moves keep adding increments to these numbers), no number on the board can reach a state where it is divisible by (7) and thus cannot be divisible by (2023 = 7 cdot 17^2).    Therefore, for any (10000) moves, Grisha has a winning strategy ensuring that no number is divisible by (2023).

The derivative is given by: y' = frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + 3x - 1) = 3x^2 + 3. Since the line is tangent to the curve, its slope k must equal the slope of the curve at the tangency point, which means k = y' = 3x^2 + 3. We are looking for the minimum value of k, so we analyze the derivative y': y' = 3(x^2 + 1) geq 3. The derivative y' is always greater than or equal to 3 because x^2 + 1 is always positive for all x. Therefore, the minimum value of k is 3, which occurs when x^2 + 1 is at its minimum, i.e., x = 0 (since x^2 is minimized at x = 0). Now that we know the slope of the tangent line at its minimum is 3, we need to find the corresponding y-value of the curve at x = 0 to determine the equation of the line: y = (0)^3 + 3(0) - 1 = -1. The tangency point on the curve is therefore (0, -1). Using the point-slope form of a line's equation, we can write the equation of the tangent line as: y - (-1) = 3(x - 0), which simplifies to: y + 1 = 3x.

These integers ( n_i ) should satisfy the condition: ( n_i ) divides ( P_j(m) ) for every integer ( m ) if and only if ( i = j ). 1. **Divisibility of Polynomials**:        Consider a polynomial ( P_i(x) ) such that ( c mid P_i(x) ) for all ( x ). Then, ( c ) must also divide all finite differences of ( P_i(x) ). This entails calculating the finite differences of a polynomial of degree 13. 2. **First Finite Difference**:        [    Q(x) = P_i(x+1) - P_i(x)    ]        Given that ( P_i(x) ) is a monic polynomial of degree 13, the leading term of ( (x+1)^{13} - x^{13} ) contributes ( 13x^{12} ). 3. **Subsequent Differences**:        Continuously calculating subsequent finite differences, we observe the pattern:        [    R(x) = Q(x+1) - Q(x)    ]        The leading term ( 13 cdot 12x^{11} ), and subsequently, each step involves a multiplicative factor of the next integer until reaching a constant. 4. **Ultimate Divisibility Requirement**:        The first coefficient after ( x^{12} ) is divisible by ( 13! ). Therefore:        [    c mid 13!    ]        This means the only possible divisors of ( c ) are the factors of ( 13! ). 5. **Constructing Polynomials**:        Constructing polynomials to satisfy the divisibility condition, consider:    [    P_i(x) = x(x+1)(x+2)cdots(x+12) + a_i    ]        Here, the product of 13 consecutive integers is always divisible by ( 13! ), so ( P_i(x) ) is divisible by ( c ) where ( c mid 13! ). 6. **Maximizing ( k )**:        We aim to find the largest ( k ) under the condition ( n_i mid P_j(x) ) implies ( i = j ). This constrains us to find ( n_i )'s such that no ( n_i ) divides another ( n_j ). 7. **Odd Factors of ( 13! )**:        The prime factorization of ( 13! ) is:    [    13! = 2^{10} cdot 3^5 cdot 5^2 cdot 7 cdot 11 cdot 13    ]        We focus on the odd part (excluding powers of 2):        [    3^5 cdot 5^2 cdot 7 cdot 11 cdot 13    ]        There are ( 6 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 = 144 ) combinations of these factors. 8. **Conclusion**:        Since each distinct combination corresponds to a possible ( n_i ) that maintains the required independence condition (i.e., no ( n_i ) divides another ( n_j )), the maximum possible value of ( k ) is 144.

The highest degree term then from f(g(x)) is a(a_nx^n)^3 = aa_n^3x^{3n}. Since we require the degree of h(x) = 8, thus 3n = 8 does not give an integer solution. However, this has considered only f(g(x)); we must ensure that the degree of g(x) itself plus any constant terms or lower-degree terms do not raise the overall degree of h(x) above what is defined. By reassessing, if 3n must provide a lower value, we set 3n = 6. Thus, n = 2. Correctly this must mean the term of g(x) plus f(g(x)) gives a maximum degree, i.e., max(3n, n) = 6. This is consistent with the calculations when the highest degree of g(x) itself could interfere and hence n = 2 might be a possible solution here given the simple form of g(x) laid out for n = 2, making everything aligned to the highest degree being 6 and reconsidering f(g(x)) + g(x) structure for the sum, which perfectly fits an overall degree of h(x) = 8 when taking account of smaller terms too.

Since each lollipop costs 25 cents, we divide the amount Julie gave by the cost per lollipop: Number of lollipops Julie paid for = Amount Julie gave / Cost per lollipop Number of lollipops Julie paid for = 75 cents / 25 cents per lollipop Number of lollipops Julie paid for = 3 lollipops Now we have the number of lollipops shared (3) and the total number of lollipops bought (12). To find the ratio of the number of lollipops shared to the total number of lollipops bought, we write it as: Ratio = Number of lollipops shared : Total number of lollipops bought Ratio = 3 : 12 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 3 in this case: Simplified ratio = (3 ÷ 3) : (12 ÷ 3) Simplified ratio = 1 : 4 So, the ratio of the number of lollipops shared to the total number of lollipops bought is boxed{1:4} ."},{"instruction":"Given real numbers b and c such that b^2+c^2=1, and let f(x) = ax + bsin x + ccos x.

The problem states that there are two perpendicular tangent lines to the graph of f(x). Let's denote the points where these tangent lines touch the graph as x=m and x=n. The slopes of these tangent lines are:  k_1 = f'(m) = a + cos(m+phi),  and  k_2 = f'(n) = a + cos(n+phi).  Since the tangent lines are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:  k_1 cdot k_2 = (a + cos(m+phi))(a + cos(n+phi)) = -1.  This forms a quadratic equation with respect to a:  a^2 + (cos(m+phi) + cos(n+phi))a + cos(m+phi)cos(n+phi) + 1 = 0.  For real roots to exist, the discriminant (Delta) must be non-negative:  Delta = [cos(m+phi) + cos(n+phi)]^2 - 4[cos(m+phi)cos(n+phi) + 1] geq 0.  This simplifies to:  [cos(m+phi) - cos(n+phi)]^2 geq 4.  Since -2 leq cos(m+phi) - cos(n+phi) leq 2, we actually have [cos(m+phi) - cos(n+phi)]^2 leq 4, implying [cos(m+phi) - cos(n+phi)]^2 - 4 = 0.  Therefore, we find that cos(m+phi) = 1 and cos(n+phi) = -1, or cos(m+phi) = -1 and cos(n+phi) = 1. Plugging these values into the equation (a+cos(m+phi))(a+cos(n+phi)) = -1, we obtain:  a^2 - 1 = -1,  which leads to a=0. To find the range of b+c, we employ the inequality b^2+c^2=1 geq 2|bc| by the AM-GM inequality, which occurs when b=c. This gives us |bc| leq frac{1}{2}. Therefore, -frac{1}{2} leq bc leq frac{1}{2}.

We need to find the smallest integer value of n for which n is an integer. We check the minimum value of x for which frac{x(x+3)^2}{30} is an integer.     3. Testing x = 1, 2, 3:    - For x = 1, n = frac{1 cdot 4^2}{30} = frac{16}{30}, which is not an integer.    - For x = 2, n = frac{2 cdot 5^2}{30} = frac{50}{30}, which is not an integer.    - For x = 3, n = frac{3 cdot 6^2}{30} = frac{108}{30} = 3.6, which is not an integer.    - For x = 5, n = frac{5 cdot 8^2}{30} = frac{320}{30} approx 10.67, which is not an integer.    - For x = 6, n = frac{6 cdot 9^2}{30} = frac{486}{30} = 16.2, which is not an integer. Checking more values, eventually, I find:    - For x = 10, n = frac{10 cdot 13^2}{30} = frac{1690}{30} = 56.33, which is not an integer.    - For x = 15, n = frac{15 cdot 18^2}{30} = frac{4860}{30} = 162, which is an integer and aligns with GCD and LCM definitions.

A) frac{1}{12} B) frac{1}{10} C) frac{1}{8} D) frac{1}{6}","output":"1. **Assign Variables:**    Let the length of overline{EH} be x. Therefore, the length of overline{GE} is 3x. 2. **Express overline{GF} and overline{FH}:**    Let overline{FH} = y. Then, overline{GF} = 7y. 3. **Total Length of overline{GH}:**    overline{GH} = overline{GE} + overline{EH} = 3x + x = 4x.    Similarly, overline{GH} = overline{GF} + overline{FH} = 7y + y = 8y. 4. **Relate x and y:**    Equating the two expressions for overline{GH}, we get 4x = 8y. Solving for x, we find x = 2y. 5. **Position and Length of overline{EF}:**    To find overline{EF}, we must consider the positions of E and F. Since E is closer to G than F and their respective distances from H are x and y with x = 2y, E is actually further along the line than F, meaning overline{EF} = overline{GE} - overline{GF} = 3x - 7y. 6. **Substitute x in terms of y:**    Substituting x = 2y into overline{EF} = 3x - 7y, we get overline{EF} = 3(2y) - 7y = 6y - 7y = -y.    Since lengths cannot be negative and overline{EF} represents the positive distance, we use y. 7. **Fraction of overline{EF} to overline{GH}:**    Since overline{GH} = 8y and overline{EF} = y, the fraction is frac{overline{EF}}{overline{GH}} = frac{y}{8y} = frac{1}{8}. Thus, the length of overline{EF} is frac{1}{8} of the length of overline{GH}. frac{1{8}} The final answer is boxed{textbf{(C)} frac{1}{8}}"},{"instruction":"Given a sequence of distinct natural numbers less than ( n ) and another sequence with the same properties, prove that if the total number of elements in the two sequences is at least ( n ), then there exists an element from each sequence whose sum is exactly ( n ).","output":"1. Suppose we have two sequences of natural numbers less than n, and these sequences are distinct natural numbers. 2. Denote the elements of the first sequence by a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k. 3. Denote the elements of the second sequence by b_1, b_2, ldots, b_m, where k + m geq n. 4. Assume, for contradiction, that there are no pairs of elements (one from each sequence) that sum to n.  First Approach: 5. If there are no such pairs, then:    - For any a_i in {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k}, the number n - a_i notin {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_m} because if it were, we would have found a pair that sums to n. 6. The numbers n - a_1, n - a_2, ldots, n - a_k cannot be in the second sequence. Hence, in the set {1, 2, ldots, n-1}, we exclude these k elements. 7. This leaves us with n - 1 - k elements which could possibly be in the second sequence. 8. Therefore, the second sequence can have, at most, n - k - 1 elements. 9. Summing these up, the maximum number of elements in both sequences would be:    [    k + (n - k - 1) = n - 1.    ] 10. This results in a total of n - 1 elements, but we know that together they have at least n elements. 11. Thus, our assumption that there are no pairs summing to n is false. Hence there must be at least one pair of elements (one from each sequence) whose sum is n. # Conclusion: (boxed{text{The original claim is correct.}})  Second Approach: 1. Create a new sequence comprising the numbers that can be derived by subtracting elements of the second sequence from n.  2. Denote these elements by n - b_1, n - b_2, ldots, n - b_m. 3. In this set of transformed elements, one of them must match one of the elements of the first sequence. 4. This is because, again, we have at least n elements combined from the first sequence and this transformed set. 5. Since we cannot select n distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, ldots, n-1}, there must be some overlap. 6. That overlapping element will sum with some element of the second sequence to n. # Conclusion: (boxed{text{The original claim is correct.}})"},{"instruction":"A pessimist and an optimist each have a glass (the glasses are identical).

Let's denote the initial circle as (S) with center (Q) and radius (R). 2. Consider a rotation of this circle by an angle (theta) about a point (O). Under this rotation:    - The center (Q) of the circle (S) moves to a new position, which we'll call (Q_1).    - Any arbitrary point (M) on the circumference of the circle (S) rotates to a new position, which we'll call (M_1). 3. Now, examine the triangles (MOQ) and (M_1 O Q_1). Since (M) and (Q) are rotated, the transformation preserves the angles and lengths because rotation is an isometry.     4. In triangles ( MOQ ) and ( M_1 O Q_1 ):    - The segment (OQ) equals the segment (OQ_1) as rotations do not change the distance from the rotation center.    - The segment (QM) equals the segment (Q_1M_1) since (M) moves directly to (M_1) by rotation, keeping its distance from (Q) the same. 5. Therefore, the distance from (Q_1) to (M_1) stays the same as the distance from (Q) to (M) which is the radius (R):    [    Q_1 M_1 = Q M = R.    ]     6. Since this is true for any point (M) on the circumference of (S), all points (M_1) form a circle (S_1) with center (Q_1) and radius (R). 7. Consequently, under rotation, every point on the circle (S) maps to a corresponding point on another circle (S_1) with the same radius (R), thus proving that a circle remains a circle under rotation. Hence, we've shown that any circle transforms into another circle with the same radius under rotation.

Prove that if  p | a_n , then  p > n .","output":"1. **Define the sequence and function:**    Given the sequence ( (a_n) ) defined by:    [    a_1 = 2, quad a_{n+1} = a_n^3 - a_n + 1    ]    We can define the function ( f(x) = x^3 - x + 1 ). Thus, ( a_{n+1} = f(a_n) ). 2. **Behavior of the sequence modulo ( p ):**    Consider the sequence ( (a_n) ) modulo an odd prime ( p ). We need to show that if ( p mid a_n ), then ( p > n ). 3. **Initial values and periodicity:**    Let's examine the sequence modulo small primes to understand its behavior:    - For ( p = 3 ):      [      a_1 = 2, quad a_2 = 2^3 - 2 + 1 = 7 equiv 1 pmod{3}      ]      [      a_3 = 1^3 - 1 + 1 = 1 equiv 1 pmod{3}      ]      The sequence becomes ( 2, 1, 1, ldots ) modulo 3.    - For ( p = 5 ):      [      a_1 = 2, quad a_2 = 2^3 - 2 + 1 = 7 equiv 2 pmod{5}      ]      [      a_3 = 2^3 - 2 + 1 = 7 equiv 2 pmod{5}      ]      The sequence becomes ( 2, 2, 2, ldots ) modulo 5.    - For ( p = 7 ):      [      a_1 = 2, quad a_2 = 2^3 - 2 + 1 = 7 equiv 0 pmod{7}      ]      [      a_3 = 0^3 - 0 + 1 = 1 equiv 1 pmod{7}      ]      [      a_4 = 1^3 - 1 + 1 = 1 equiv 1 pmod{7}      ]      The sequence becomes ( 2, 0, 1, 1, ldots ) modulo 7. 4. **General behavior and periodicity:**    For any odd prime ( p ), the sequence ( (a_n) ) modulo ( p ) will eventually become periodic. This is because there are only ( p ) possible values modulo ( p ), so by the pigeonhole principle, some value must repeat. 5. **Fixed points and periodicity:**    The function ( f(x) = x^3 - x + 1 ) has fixed points modulo ( p ) where ( f(x) equiv x pmod{p} ). Solving ( x^3 - x + 1 equiv x pmod{p} ) gives:    [    x^3 - 2x + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    The fixed points are ( x = 0, 1, -1 ) modulo ( p ). 6. **Implication for ( p mid a_n ):**    If ( p mid a_n ), then ( a_n equiv 0 pmod{p} ). From the periodicity, if ( a_n equiv 0 pmod{p} ), then ( a_{n+1} = f(a_n) equiv f(0) = 1 pmod{p} ). Thus, ( a_{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ) and the sequence will not return to 0 for ( n geq p ). 7. **Conclusion:**    Since ( a_n equiv 0 pmod{p} ) implies ( a_{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ) and the sequence does not return to 0, it follows that ( p mid a_n ) can only occur for ( n < p ).

We need to check if these numbers can satisfy the given condition. 2. **Consider the Polynomial Form:**    For any subset of 1000 numbers, say ( a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ldots, a_{i_{1000}} ), the polynomial formed is:    [    P(x) = (x - a_{i_1})(x - a_{i_2}) cdots (x - a_{i_{1000}})    ]    The coefficients of this polynomial, except the leading coefficient, must be a permutation of the remaining 1000 numbers. 3. **Analyze the Sums and Products:**    The coefficients of the polynomial are symmetric sums of the roots. Specifically, the coefficient of ( x^{999} ) is the sum of the roots taken one at a time:    [    -sum_{j=1}^{1000} a_{i_j}    ]    The coefficient of ( x^{998} ) is the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, and so on. 4. **Consider the Number of Distinct Values:**    Let ( x ) be the number of distinct values among ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2000} ). If ( x > 2 ), we can order these distinct values as ( b_1 < b_2 < cdots < b_x ). 5. **Forming Different Sums:**    Consider the smallest sum of any 1000 numbers. By changing the largest element in that sum ( b_r ) to ( b_{r+1}, b_{r+2}, ldots, b_x ), and similarly adjusting other elements, we can form ( x ) different sums. This implies that if ( x > r ), there can only be one ( b_x ) and ( x = r + 1 ). 6. **Contradiction with More Than Two Distinct Values:**    If there are at least two numbers smaller than ( b_r ), we get at least ( x + 1 ) different sums, which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( x leq 2 ). 7. **Case of Two Distinct Values:**    If ( x = 2 ), then 1999 numbers are equal, leading to a contradiction in the sums and products. Specifically, if ( b_1 ) and ( b_3 ) are distinct, we get:    [    b_1 + b_3 = 2b_2 quad text{and} quad b_1 b_3 = b_2^2    ]    This implies ( b_1 = b_2 = b_3 ), which is a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion:**    Since having more than two distinct values leads to contradictions, and having exactly two distinct values also leads to contradictions, it is impossible to have such 2000 real numbers.

This configuration doesn't normally exist in regular prismatic structures, so let's assume it's a standard prism for simplicity.

Part 2: Probability Distribution and Expected Value of Drawing White Balls With Replacement Since the balls are drawn with replacement, the probability of drawing a white ball each time is frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2}. Thus, the number of white balls drawn, X, follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 3 (three draws) and p = frac{1}{2} (probability of drawing a white ball). The probability distribution is given by the formula for a binomial distribution P(X=k) = binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}, where k is the number of successes (white balls drawn). Calculating each probability: - P(X=0) = binom{3}{0}left(frac{1}{2}right)^0left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 = 1 times 1 times frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{8} - P(X=1) = binom{3}{1}left(frac{1}{2}right)^1left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = 3 times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{8} - P(X=2) = binom{3}{2}left(frac{1}{2}right)^2left(frac{1}{2}right)^1 = 3 times frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{8} - P(X=3) = binom{3}{3}left(frac{1}{2}right)^3left(frac{1}{2}right)^0 = 1 times frac{1}{8} times 1 = frac{1}{8} Hence, the probability distribution of X is as follows: | X | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| | P | frac{1}{8} | frac{3}{8} | frac{3}{8} | frac{1}{8} | For the expected value E(X), it is calculated using the formula E(X) = sum_{k=0}^{n}k times P(X=k): E(X) = 0 times frac{1}{8} + 1 times frac{3}{8} + 2 times frac{3}{8} + 3 times frac{1}{8} = 0 + frac{3}{8} + frac{6}{8} + frac{3}{8} = frac{12}{8} = frac{3}{2} Encapsulating the final answer for the expected value, we obtain boxed{frac{3}{2}}."},{"instruction":"Jack collects baseball and football cards.

A fish has the sum of the lives of a dog and a mouse, which is 6 + 13 = 19 lives, but half the lives of an elephant, which is 13 / 2 = 6.5 lives. Since we can't have half a life, we'll need to clarify whether we should round up or down. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume we round down to the nearest whole number, so the fish has 6 lives. Now, let's add up the total number of lives: Cat = 9 lives Dog = 6 lives Mouse = 13 lives Elephant = 13 lives Fish = 6 lives Total = 9 + 6 + 13 + 13 + 6 = 47 lives So, the total number of lives of the cat, dog, mouse, elephant, and fish is boxed{47} ."},{"instruction":"The equation y = 4.9t^2 + 29.4t describes the height (in meters) of a projectile launched from the ground at 29.4 meters per second.

Tanya is 25% more efficient than Sakshi, which means Tanya's work rate is 125% of Sakshi's work rate. To find Tanya's work rate, we multiply Sakshi's work rate by 1.25 (which is the same as 125%): Tanya's work rate = Sakshi's work rate × 1.25 Tanya's work rate = ( frac{1}{15} ) × 1.25 Now, let's calculate Tanya's work rate: Tanya's work rate = ( frac{1}{15} ) × ( frac{5}{4} ) (since 1.25 is the same as ( frac{5}{4} )) Tanya's work rate = ( frac{1}{15} ) × ( frac{5}{4} ) = ( frac{1 × 5}{15 × 4} ) Tanya's work rate = ( frac{5}{60} ) Tanya's work rate = ( frac{1}{12} ) (simplifying the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5) This means Tanya can do ( frac{1}{12} ) of the work per day. To find out how many days it takes for Tanya to do the same piece of work, we take the reciprocal of her work rate: Number of days for Tanya to do the work = ( frac{1}{text{Tanya's work rate}} ) Number of days for Tanya to do the work = ( frac{1}{frac{1}{12}} ) Number of days for Tanya to do the work = 12 Therefore, it takes Tanya boxed{12}  days to do the same piece of work."},{"instruction":"Are there any real coefficient polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) for which the polynomial ( f(x)^3  g(x)^2 ) is linear?","output":"We will demonstrate that there are no such polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) with this property. **1. Indirect proof:** Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that [ f(x)^3 - g(x)^2 = ax + b quad text{where} quad a neq 0. ] This formula would be more manageable if the right-hand side were the negative of a perfect square. To this end, introduce the variable ( y ) and apply the substitution ( x = frac{-y^2 - b}{a} ). Then [ f(x) = fleft( frac{-y^2 - b}{a} right) = F(y^2), quad text{and} quad g(x) = G(y^2), ] for suitable polynomials ( F ) and ( G ). Hence, [ F(y^2)^3 = G(y^2)^2 - y^2 = left( G(y^2) - y right) left( G(y^2) + y right). ] 2. Analyzing polynomial degrees:     The degree of the polynomial on the left side is a multiple of 6; therefore, ( G ) cannot be constant. If ( F ) has no constant term, the same should be true for ( G ). However, the lowest degree term in the polynomial on the left must be divisible by 6, whereas the lowest degree term on the right is 2. This implies ( G ) is non-constant and must have a constant term.  The two factors on the right-hand side are relatively prime, as any polynomial that divides both must divide their difference and their sum, ( 2y ) and ( 2G(y^2) ), which are relatively prime because the constant term of ( 2G(y^2) ) is not zero. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, both factors on the right are cubes of some real polynomials up to a constant factor. Since any real scalar can be expressed as the cube of a real number, it follows that there exist real polynomials ( p(y) ) and ( q(y) ) such that [ p(y)^3 = G(y^2) - y quad text{and} quad q(y)^3 = G(y^2) + y. ] Since ( G ) is not constant, it follows that the highest degree term in the right-hand polynomials must match and be at least second degree. The polynomials on the left must also match in degrees: ( p(y) ) and ( q(y) ) have the same highest degree non-zero term ( c y^n ) where ( n geq 1). Therefore, [ 2y = q(y)^3 - p(y)^3 = (q(y) - p(y)) left( q(y)^2 + q(y)p(y) + p(y)^2 right). ] Since ( q(y)^2 + q(y)p(y) + p(y)^2 ) includes a term with ( y^{2n} ) and coefficient ( 3c^2 neq 0 ), the right-hand side cannot be linear (first-degree), which contradicts the assumption. This contradiction proves the initial assertion. **Conclusion:** The original statement is proven false. Therefore, there are no such polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) such that ( f(x)^3 - g(x)^2 ) is linear. (blacksquare) **II. Second Solution:** We will again use an indirect proof. Assume that [ f(x)^3 = g(x)^2 + r(x) quad text{where} quad r(x) = ax + b quad text{and} quad a neq 0. ] **1. Polynomial degrees and gcd:** Neither ( f ) nor ( g ) can be constant, so (deg f = 2k ) and (deg g = 3k ) for some positive integer ( k ). Let ( d ) denote ( gcd(f, g) ). Then ( d^2 mid f^3 - g^2 = r ), but since ( r ) is linear, ( d ) must be a constant; thus, ( f ) and ( g ) are relatively prime. **2. Derivative operations:** Taking derivatives of both sides of the equation, [ 3 f(x)^2 f'(x) = 2 g(x) g'(x) + r', ] and multiplying (6) by ( r' ) and subtracting (7) multiplied by ( r ), [ f^2 left( f r' - 3 f' r right) = g left( g r' - 2 g' r right). ] Since ( f^2 ) divides the left-hand side and ( f ) and ( g ) are relatively prime, [ f^2 mid g r' - 2 g' r. ] However, ( deg f^2 = 4k ), while ( deg (g r' - 2 g' r) ) is at most ( 3k ). Furthermore, if ( d ) is the leading coefficient of ( g ), then the coefficient of the ( 3k )-th degree term in ( g r' - 2 g' r ) is [ d a - 6 k d a = (1 - 6k) d a neq 0. ] Hence, ( g r' - 2 g' r ) is not the zero polynomial and has degree exactly ( 3k ). Therefore, by (8), [ f^2 mid g r' - 2 g' r, ] which is impossible because ( f^2 ) is ( 4k )-th degree, while ( g r' - 2 g' r ) is ( 3k )-th degree. **Conclusion:** The original assumption is proven false. Therefore, there are no such polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) such that ( f(x)^3 - g(x)^2 = ax + b ) with ( a neq 0 ).

This point satisfies the parabola's equation. 4. **Determining Point Q**: Since PQ is perpendicular to the directrix l and passes through P(1,2), point Q is directly opposite P on the directrix, thus Q(-1,2). 5. **Intersection of Directrix and X-axis**: The intersection point of the directrix l and the x-axis is A(-1,0). 6. **Formation of Quadrilateral QAFP**: With points Q(-1,2), A(-1,0), F(1,0), and P(1,2), we can see that quadrilateral QAFP forms a square. 7. **Properties of a Square**: In a square, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other and bisect each other.  8. **Conclusion on the Perpendicular Bisector**: Since QAFP is a square, and the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles, the perpendicular bisector of segment FQ must pass through the opposite vertex P of the square.  9. **Verification via Parabola Definition**: Additionally, by the definition of a parabola, the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus F is equal to its distance to the directrix l, i.e., |PF| = |PQ|. This makes triangle PQF an isosceles triangle with FQ as its base.

The buoyant force (F_a) is given by Archimedes' principle:     [     F_a = rho_{text{ж}} cdot g cdot V     ]     where (rho_{text{ж}}) is the density of the liquid, (g) is the acceleration due to gravity, and (V) is the volume of the body. 4.

Given that ( n geqslant 3 ) is an integer, we want to find the number of paths starting at ((0,0)) and ending at ((2n,0)), lying completely above the (x)-axis and not intersecting it. 1. **Observation**:      - According to Figure 20 (referenced in the original problem), this problem of counting paths can be transformed by considering paths starting at ((1,1)) and ending at ((2n-1,1)), which lie above the line (y=1) and intersect this line at most at point ((2n-1,1)). 2. **Coordinate Shift**:     - We can shift the origin of the coordinate system to ((1, 1)).      - By doing this, the start point for the new system becomes ((0,0)) and the endpoint transforms to ((2n-2, 0)). 3. **New Path Consideration**:     - Now we need to consider paths from ((0,0)) to ((2n-2,0)) that lie entirely above the (x)-axis and do not intersect it.     - This type of path is known as a Dyck path of order (n-1). 4. **Counting Dyck Paths**:     - The number of such paths is given by the Catalan number: (C_{2n-2}^{n-1}).     - But since we shifted the coordinate system by one unit upward and to the right, the number of valid paths correspond to (frac{1}{n}) of (C_{2n-2}^{n-1}). 5. **Conclusion**:     - The number of desired paths is therefore counted by combining the shift and adjustment mechanism mentioned.

We proceed by considering the condition (a) given in the problem. 2. Suppose condition (a) is satisfied, meaning:        int_{mathbb{R}} |varphi(t)|^{2} d t < infty.        Note that psi(t) = |varphi(t)|^{2} for t in mathbb{R}, which is the characteristic function of X - Y where Y is an independent copy of X. 3. The density of the distribution X - Y is given by:        g(z) = int_{mathbb{R}} f(x-z) f(x) d x.        By the given condition, the evaluated integral is finite for almost all z in mathbb{R} (according to Lebesgue measure). 4. Since psi(t) is integrable, the inversion formula grants us:         g(z) = frac{1}{2 pi} int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-i t z} psi(t) d t,        for almost all z in mathbb{R} according to the Lebesgue measure.

Therefore, integrating varphi_sigma(t) yields:        int_{mathbb{R}} left| varphi_{sigma}(t) right| d t < infty,        and h(z) is continuous in z.

An odd function satisfies the condition f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain, and its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin (0,0). Given the function f(x) = frac{1-x}{1+x}, we can rewrite it as follows: [ f(x) = frac{1-x}{1+x} = frac{-(x+1)+2}{1+x} = -1 + frac{2}{1+x} ] This shows that the function f(x) can be thought of as a transformation of frac{2}{x}, shifted one unit to the right and one unit down, which gives it a symmetric center at (-1, -1).

Since the balls are numbered from 1 to 100, there are 50 odd-numbered balls (1, 3, 5, ..., 99) and 50 even-numbered balls (2, 4, 6, ..., 100). If the probability of picking an odd-numbered ball is 2/3, it suggests that the pattern of the numbers on the balls selected must favor the selection of odd numbers over even numbers. This could mean that the pattern involves selecting two odd-numbered balls for every even-numbered ball. One possible pattern that fits this probability is that the balls are selected in sets of three, with two odd-numbered balls and one even-numbered ball in each set. This would mean that for every three balls picked, two are odd and one is even, which gives a 2/3 chance of picking an odd-numbered ball first. However, since the balls are selected with replacement, the pattern must be inherent to the selection process itself, not just the outcome of a single set of three balls.

First, denote ( P_{n+1} = P_1 ), ( X_{n+1} = X_1 ), and ( A_{n+1} = A_1 ).  Lemma: Let point (Q) lie inside the convex polygon (A_1 A_2 ldots A_n). Then, (Q) is contained in at least one of the circumcircles of the triangles (X_1 A_2 X_2), (X_2 A_3 X_3), ..., (X_n A_1 X_1).  Proof of Lemma: 1. **Case 1: ( Q ) lies in one of the triangles (X_1 A_2 X_2, ldots, X_n A_1 X_1)**:    - In this situation, the claim is obvious because if (Q) is inside any triangle (X_i A_{i+1} X_{i+1}), then it is automatically inside the circumcircle of that triangle. 2. **Case 2: ( Q ) lies inside the polygon (X_1 X_2 ldots X_n)**:    - We can analyze the sum of the angles around (Q):        sum_{i=1}^{n} (angle X_i A_{i+1} X_{i+1} + angle X_i Q X_{i+1}) = (n-2)pi + 2pi = npi        - Hence, there must be at least one index (i) such that:        angle X_i A_{i+1} X_{i+1} + angle X_i Q X_{i+1} geq pi        - Since the quadrilateral (Q X_i A_{i+1} X_{i+1}) is convex, this implies that (Q) is contained within the circumcircle of (triangle X_i A_{i+1} X_{i+1}). Since in either case (Q) must be within at least one of the desired circumcircles, the lemma is proved.  (blacksquare) ---  Application of the Lemma to the Main Problem: Now, applying the earlier lemma, we assert that (P) (which lies inside the polygon (A_1 A_2 ldots A_n)) is within the circumcircle of some triangle (X_i A_{i+1} X_{i+1}). 1. **Consider Circumcircles:**    - Let (omega) be the circumcircle of (triangle P_1 A_{i+1} P_{i+1}).    - Let (Omega) be the circumcircle of (triangle X_i A_{i+1} X_{i+1}).    - Denote the radii of these circles by (r) and (R) respectively. 2. **Relate Radii:**    - Because (P) lies inside (Omega), we have:        2r leq 2R         3. **Establish the Length Comparisons:**    - Using the properties of the circumcircles:        P_1 P_{i+1} = 2r sin angle P_i A_{i+1} P_{i+1} leq 2R sin angle X_i A_{i+1} X_{i+1} = X_i X_{i+1}         Thus, ( frac{X_i X_{i+1}}{P_1 P_{i+1}} geq 1 ) for this specific pair of indices (i).

To find the number that is divisible by 32 and leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 935 and 1383, we need to subtract the remainder from each number and then find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the results. For 935: 935 - 7 = 928 For 1383: 1383 - 7 = 1376 Now we need to find the GCD of 928 and 1376.

We know that Jesse needs 6840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all 20 rooms. So, we divide the total square footage needed by the number of rooms to find the square footage of one room: 6840 square feet / 20 rooms = 342 square feet per room Now that we know each room is 342 square feet and the width of each room is 18 feet, we can find the length by dividing the square footage of one room by the width: 342 square feet / 18 feet = 19 feet So, Jesse's rooms are boxed{19}  feet long."},{"instruction":"The following graph depicts the annual expenditures (in millions) for Sunrise Town during 1995.

We are asked to find angles in which each angle measures an integer multiple of (1^{primeprime}). Let the angles of triangle ( H ) be ( alpha, beta, gamma ) such that ( alpha < beta < gamma < 90^circ ). We can express these angles as: [ alpha = 60^circ + delta, quad beta = 60^circ + varepsilon, quad gamma = 60^circ + zeta, ] where ( delta < 0^circ ) and ( zeta > 0^circ ). The sum of interior angles for any triangle is (180^circ), so we have: [ delta + varepsilon + zeta = 0^circ. ] According to the first pedal triangle ( T_1 ), its angles given ( alpha ) is: [ alpha_1 = 180^circ - 2alpha. ] Similarly, for ( beta ) and ( gamma ): [ beta_1 = 180^circ - 2beta, quad gamma_1 = 180^circ - 2gamma. ] Since ( alpha = 60^circ + delta ), then: [ alpha_1 = 180^circ - 2(60^circ + delta) = 60^circ - 2 delta. ] For ( beta_1 ) and ( gamma_1 ): [ beta_1 = 180^circ - 2(60^circ + varepsilon) = 60^circ - 2 varepsilon, ] [ gamma_1 = 180^circ - 2(60^circ + zeta) = 60^circ - 2 zeta. ] The general formula for the angles of the (i)-th pedal triangle can be written as: [ alpha_i = 180^circ - 2alpha_{i-1}. ] Calculating the values for ( alpha ): [ alpha_2 = 180^circ - 2 (60^circ - 2delta) = 60^circ + 4delta, ] [ alpha_3 = 180^circ - 2 (60^circ + 4delta) = 60^circ - 8delta, ] [ alpha_4 = 180^circ - 2 (60^circ - 8delta) = 60^circ + 16delta, ] [ vdots ] [ alpha_{15} = 60^circ + (-2)^{15} delta. ] Thus: [ alpha_{15} = 60^circ - 2^{15} delta. ] To ensure that ( T_{15} ) is an acute-angled triangle, the largest angle must be acute. Considering ( alpha < beta < gamma ) leading to ( delta < varepsilon < zeta ): [ -2^{15} delta > -2^{15} varepsilon > -2^{15} zeta. ] Adding ( 60^circ ) to each term: [ alpha_{15} > beta_{15} > gamma_{15}. ] For ( alpha_{15} < 90^circ ): [ 60^circ - 2^{15} delta < 90^circ, ] [ -2^{15} delta > -30^circ, ] [ delta > -frac{30^circ cdot 60^primeprime}{2^{15}} = -4^primeprime. ] Therefore: [ delta = -1^primeprime, -2^primeprime, -3^primeprime. ] Likewise, ( gamma_{15} > 0^circ ): [ 60^circ - 2^{15} zeta > 0^circ, ] [ zeta < frac{60^circ cdot 60^primeprime}{2^{15}} = 7^primeprime. ] Thus, the possible values for ( zeta ) are: [ zeta = 1^primeprime, 2^primeprime, 3^primesecond, 4^primesecond, 5^primesecond, 6^primesecond. ] Consider ( delta = -3^primesecond), ( zeta = 5^primesecond), and ( varepsilon = -2^primesecond).

Then frac{x-a}{x-b} : frac{c-a}{c-b} = frac{y-a}{y-b} : frac{c-a}{c-b} Since all points are distinct, this implies (x-a)(y-b) = (x-b)(y-a). Expanding and simplifying this gives ax - bx = ay - by. Dividing through by (a-b) gives x=y. # Detailed Solution: 1. **Setup and Given Information:**     - Let the coordinates of points (A, B, C, X, Y) be (a, b, c, x,) and (y) respectively.     - The problem gives us that the cross-ratio ((A, B, C, X)) is equal to the cross-ratio ((A, B, C, Y)). 2. **Form the Cross-Ratio Equations:**     Using the definition of cross-ratio, we have:     [     frac{(X - A)(B - C)}{(X - B)(A - C)} = frac{(Y - A)(B - C)}{(Y - B)(A - C)}     ] 3. **Simplify the Cross-Ratio Equations:**     Since (B) and (C) are fixed points, we can drop (frac{(B - C)}{(A - C)}) from both sides. This is because these terms are common and will cancel each other out:     [     frac{X - A}{X - B} = frac{Y - A}{Y - B}     ] 4. **Clearing the Fraction:**     Multiply both sides by ((X - B)(Y - B)):     [     (X - A)(Y - B) = (Y - A)(X - B)     ] 5. **Expand the Equation:**     Distribute both sides:     [     XY - XB - AY + AB = XY - YA - XB + AB     ] 6. **Simplify the Equation:**     After simplifying the two equations, we cancel out the equal terms on both sides:     [     - AY = - YA     ] 7. **Isolate the Variables:**     This implies:     [     AY = YA quad Rightarrow quad X = Y     ]      **Conclusion:** Through the above steps, it has been shown that the initial condition ((A, B, C, X) = (A, B, C, Y)) necessarily leads to the conclusion that (X) must be equal to (Y).

Now, let's calculate the total time Milly spends on the process in minutes. Since 6 hours is the total time for the process, we convert this to minutes: 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes. Now, let's subtract the time spent on mixing, baking, and resting the dough from the total time to find the time spent on folding the dough: 360 minutes (total time) - 10 minutes (mixing) - 30 minutes (baking) - 300 minutes (resting) = 20 minutes.

This requires ( p-1 ) cuts.    Similarly, if the cake is divided into ( q ) equal parts, it requires ( q-1 ) cuts. 2. **Total Cuts Calculation:**    The total number of pieces obtained from both divisions would be:    [    p + (q - 1) = p + q - 1    ]    This implies that we need ( p + q - 2 ) cuts to get a certain number of pieces. 3. **Generalizing for Non-Equal Pieces:**    Next, we need to examine whether a different number of pieces than ( p ) or ( q ) can satisfy being divided among either ( p ) or ( q ) guests. 4. **Graph Representation:**    Construct a graph where each guest is represented as a vertex.    - Total vertices: ( p + q )        Each piece of the cake corresponds to an edge connecting two vertices (guests).        When the guests decrease after taking some cake, they are connected by an edge in the graph. 5. **Connected Components:**    Each connected component of the graph must satisfy the volumes being multiples of ( p ) and ( q ):    Since ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ), any multiple must be a multiple of ( p times q ).

Find all possible P(x).","output":"Given a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( n geq 2 ) with real coefficients, the stated conditions are: 1. It has ( n ) distinct real roots. 2. For each pair of adjacent roots ( a ) and ( b ), the derivative ( P'(x) ) is zero halfway between the roots, i.e., at ( x = frac{a + b}{2} ). We aim to find all polynomials ( P(x) ) satisfying these conditions. To start, let's note that each root ( alpha_i ) of ( P(x) ) can be denoted as ( alpha_1 < alpha_2 < cdots < alpha_n ). Since ( P(x) ) has ( n ) distinct real roots, we can express ( P(x) ) as follows: [ P(x) = A (x - alpha_1)(x - alpha_2) cdots (x - alpha_n) ] where ( A ) is a non-zero real constant.  Examination of ( P(x) ) for Different Degrees: **Case ( n = 2 ):** For a quadratic polynomial of the form: [ P(x) = A(x - alpha_1)(x - alpha_2) ] The roots are ( alpha_1 ) and ( alpha_2 ). Its derivative is: [ P'(x) = A left( (x - alpha_1) + (x - alpha_2) right) = A left(2x - (alpha_1 + alpha_2) right) ] Setting ( P'(x) = 0 ), we find the critical point: [ 2x - (alpha_1 + alpha_2) = 0 implies x = frac{alpha_1 + alpha_2}{2} ] Thus, for ( n = 2 ), the critical point is exactly midway between the two roots ( alpha_1 ) and ( alpha_2 ), and this coincides with the problem's requirement. **Case ( n > 2 ):** Suppose ( P(x) ) has ( n ) roots ( alpha_1 < alpha_2 < cdots < alpha_n ). The derivative ( P'(x) ) is: [ P'(x) = A sum_{i=1}^n (x - alpha_1) cdots (x - alpha_{i-1})(x - alpha_{i+1}) cdots (x - alpha_n) ] Evaluating ( P'(x) ) at ( x = frac{alpha_{i} + alpha_{i+1}}{2} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ), we see that each pair ( (alpha_i, alpha_{i+1}) ) does not give zero except for specific cases where symmetry might hold. Consider ( x = beta = frac{alpha_{n-1} + alpha_n}{2} ). We can examine the derivative as follows: [ P'left( beta right) = A sum_{i=1}^{n} prod_{j neq i} (beta - alpha_j) ] For the extreme cases ( alpha_i, alpha_j ) not symmetric around (beta), the terms will not cancel out completely. This insight that non-symmetric roots generally invalidate the condition holds for ( n > 2 ). Thus, the only polynomial that satisfies the given condition for every pair of roots is the quadratic polynomial with two distinct real roots. **Conclusion:** Given these analyses, the only possible polynomial ( P(x) ) satisfying the given conditions is a quadratic polynomial: [ boxed{P(x) = A(x - alpha_1)(x - alpha_2)} ] where ( A ) is a non-zero real constant and ( alpha_1 ) and ( alpha_2 ) are distinct real numbers."},{"instruction":"Given that tan(alpha + frac{pi}{4}) = 2, find the value of frac{sin alpha + 2 cos alpha}{sin alpha  2 cos alpha}.","output":"This problem primarily tests our understanding of the tangent of the sum of two angles formula and the trigonometric identities.

For x - 2 geq 0 which means x geq 2, the expression for f(x - 2) is: f(x - 2) = (x - 2)^3 - 8 = x^3 - 6x^2 + 12x - 16 We want this to be greater than 0, so we need to find the range of values for x when this happens. To find where this function is positive, we investigate its roots. The given solution B suggests that one of the roots must be 4. We can confirm this by substiting x = 4: f(4 - 2) = f(2) = 2^3 - 8 = 0 This tells us that x = 4 is a root of the cubic equation. We can then factor out (x - 4): x^3 - 6x^2 + 12x - 16 = (x - 4)(x^2 - 2x + 4) The quadratic x^2 - 2x + 4 has no real roots because its discriminant b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(4) = 4 - 16 < 0. Since the quadratic expression is always positive and (x - 4) changes sign at x = 4, f(x - 2) > 0 when x > 4. 2. For x - 2 < 0 which means x < 2, we have to consider the even nature of f(x): f(x - 2) = f(-(x - 2)) = - (x - 2)^3 - 8 = -x^3 + 6x^2 - 12x + 8 To determine when this is positive, let's test a value of x that is less than 2. We can use x = 0: f(0 - 2) = f(-2) = -(-2)^3 - 8 = -8 + 8 = 0 This tells us that x = 2 should also be a root for x < 2. Since the cubic term is negative when x < 2 and the function is increasing to zero at x = 2, the expression is positive for x < 0. Combining the two cases, we find that the solution set is: boxed{{x | x < 0 text{ or } x > 4}}"},{"instruction":"a math test, the average scores of School A and School B are the same, but the scores of School A are more uniform than those of School B.

Is it true that ( f(0) = f(1) = cdots = f(1998) )?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - We are given a polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients.    - The polynomial satisfies 0 leq f(c) leq 1997 for every integer c in {0, 1, ldots, 1998}.    - We need to determine if f(0) = f(1) = ldots = f(1998). 2. **Initial Considerations:**    - Note that for any integers a and b, (a - b) divides pm (f(a) - f(b)).    - Consequently, 1998 divides f(1998) - f(0), i.e., 1998 mid (f(1998) - f(0)). 3. **Bounding f(1998) - f(0):**    - As |f(1998) - f(0)| leq 1997, and 1998 divides this difference,    - We must have f(1998) = f(0) because the only integer within |1998| that can be 0 pmod{1998} is 0 itself. 4. **Considering Intermediate Values:**    - Similarly, let us examine 4 = 1998 - 1994. Then 4 also divides f(1994) - f(1998) = f(1994) - f(0). Since 1994 divides (f(1994) - f(0)),    - The LCM of 4 and 1994 is 3988, and this divides f(1994) - f(0). However, since |f(1994) - f(0)| leq 1997, this again means f(1994) = f(0). 5. **Repeating the Argument for Other Values:**    - By reversing the role of 4 and 1998, we have f(4) = f(0).    - Similarly, let us consider 5 and 1993. Here, f(1993) - f(5) = 0, thus f(1993) = f(5) = f(0).    - By induction or repeated reasoning, for any a in {1, ldots, 1997}, (x - a) mid (f(0) - f(a)) for x = 4, 5, 1993, 1994. The least common multiple of these numbers will exceed 1998, thus meaning f(a) = f(0). 6. **Polynomials and Integer Coefficients:**    - For another argument, we'll prove it for any integer k geq 4. Suppose we have F(x) with integer coefficients and 0 leq F(c) leq k for c in {0, 1, ldots, k+1}.    - Notably, F(k + 1) = F(0) because F(k + 1) - F(0) is a multiple of k + 1 not exceeding k. 7. **Restructure of Polynomials:**    - Express F(x) - F(0) = x(x - k - 1) G(x) for a polynomial G(x) with integer coefficients,    - Consider the inequality c(k + 1 - c) |G(c)| leq k over all c in {1, 2, ldots, k}. 8. **Roots of G(x):**    - For any c in {1, 2, ldots, k-1} where |G(c)| < 1, G(c) = 0 as G(c) is an integer.    - This means 2, 3, ldots, k - 1 are roots of G(x), meaning F(x) - F(0) = x(x - 2)(x - 3) ldots (x - k + 1)(x - k - 1) H(x). 9. **Ensuring H(x) Zeros:**    - For c = 1 and c = k, the polynomial property implies k geq |F(c) - F(0)| = (k - 2)! cdot k cdot |H(c)|.    - Since (k - 2)! > 1 for k geq 4, we confirm |H(c)| < 1, hence, H(c) = 0.    - Thus F(x) = F(0). **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{True}} ]"},{"instruction":".

Since (AEDF) is a cyclic quadrilateral, we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and trigonometric identities to prove the given equation. 3. **Step 1**: Use the fact that (AEDF) is cyclic to establish angle relationships.    - Since (AEDF) is cyclic, (angle AEF + angle ADF = 180^circ).    - Also, (angle EAF + angle EDF = 180^circ). 4. **Step 2**: Use the tangent and cotangent identities.    - Recall that (tan B = frac{sin B}{cos B}) and (tan C = frac{sin C}{cos C}).    - Also, (cot frac{A}{2} = frac{cos frac{A}{2}}{sin frac{A}{2}}). 5. **Step 3**: Use the Law of Sines in (triangle AEP) and (triangle AFP).    - In (triangle AEP), (frac{PA}{sin angle AEP} = frac{PE}{sin angle PAE}).    - In (triangle AFP), (frac{PA}{sin angle AFP} = frac{PF}{sin angle PAF}). 6. **Step 4**: Relate the angles using the cyclic property.    - Since (angle AEP + angle ADF = 180^circ), we have (angle AEP = 180^circ - angle ADF).    - Similarly, (angle AFP = 180^circ - angle EDF). 7. **Step 5**: Use the tangent sum identity.    - (tan(B + C) = frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan B tan C}). 8. **Step 6**: Combine the results to prove the given equation.    - Using the relationships and identities, we can show that (frac{PA}{PD} = (tan B + tan C) cot frac{A}{2}).

We already know the weight of the solids (11.62 kg), so we can calculate the weight of the remaining water in the dried fruit: Remaining water weight in dried fruit = Total weight of dried fruit - Solid content weight Remaining water weight in dried fruit = 14 kg - 11.62 kg = 2.38 kg Now, to find the percentage of water in the dried fruit, we divide the weight of the remaining water by the total weight of the dried fruit and multiply by 100: Percentage of water in dried fruit = (Remaining water weight / Total weight of dried fruit) * 100 Percentage of water in dried fruit = (2.38 kg / 14 kg) * 100 ≈ 17.00% So, the percentage of water in the dried fruit is approximately boxed{17%} ."},{"instruction":"Mr. Jesiah is a dairy cow farmer with cows producing some gallons of milk every day.

We know that Mr. Jesiah's total income for June was 18,300, and he sold 1 gallon of milk for 3.55. To find the total number of gallons sold, we divide the total income by the price per gallon: Total gallons sold = Total income / Price per gallon Total gallons sold = 18,300 / 3.55 Now, let's calculate the total gallons sold: Total gallons sold = 18,300 / 3.55 ≈ 5154.93 gallons Since we can't have a fraction of a gallon sold, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5154 gallons. Now, we need to find out how many days there are in June to determine the daily production. June has 30 days. To find the daily production, we divide the total gallons sold by the number of days in June: Daily production = Total gallons sold / Number of days in June Daily production = 5154 gallons / 30 days Now, let's calculate the daily production: Daily production ≈ 5154 gallons / 30 days ≈ 171.8 gallons per day Since we can't have a fraction of a gallon produced, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 171 gallons per day.

Using Trigonometric Identities Start by using the well-known identity for the sum of cosines: cos alpha + cos beta = 2 cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right).  We apply this identity to pair terms: cos x + cos 3x = 2 cos left( frac{x + 3x}{2} right) cos left( frac{x - 3x}{2} right) = 2 cos(2x) cos(-x) = 2 cos(2x) cos(x), since cos(-theta) = cos(theta). Similarly, cos 2x + cos 4x = 2 cos left( frac{2x + 4x}{2} right) cos left( frac{2x - 4x}{2} right) = 2 cos(3x) cos(-x) = 2 cos(3x) cos(x).  Thus, our original equation transforms into: 2 cos(2x) cos(x) + 2 cos(3x) cos(x) = 0.  Factor out 2 cos(x): 2 cos(x) (cos(2x) + cos(3x)) = 0.  So either cos(x) = 0 or cos(2x) + cos(3x) = 0.  2.

Let's consider a convex polyhedron W. Suppose this polyhedron is one-connected, meaning any cut through the polyhedron divides it into two parts.  2. To prove Euler's formula for polyhedra, namely ( mathscr{F} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{B} = 2 ), we proceed by considering a sphere around W. Let's take a sphere S centered inside W with a sufficiently large radius such that the entire polyhedron W fits inside this sphere. 3. Project the vertices, edges, and faces of W onto the surface of this large sphere S through its center. This projection will form a network or a graph on the sphere such that the edges and vertices of the graph correspond to the edges and vertices of W, and the regions they bound (i.e., the faces) correspond to the faces of W. 4. Thus, it suffices to prove the formula ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{F} = 2 ) for any network drawn on the surface of a sphere. 5. We need to check that Euler's formula holds for the simplest case of a network on a sphere, namely one consisting of a single vertex. In this case, we have:      mathscr{B} = 1, quad mathscr{P} = 0, quad mathscr{F} = 1 ,     thus confirming:      mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{F} = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2.  6. Next, proceed by incrementally adding edges and faces to this simple network. As we add new elements, verify that the expression ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{G} ) remains unchanged:         1. When adding an edge that connects an existing vertex with a new vertex not on the network:         - ( mathscr{P} ) increases by 1.         - ( mathscr{B} ) increases by 1, but ( mathscr{F} ) remains the same.         - Thus, ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{F} ) remains unchanged.          2. When adding an edge with one end on the network and the other end lying on an existing edge of the network (but not at a vertex):         - A new vertex is introduced, increasing ( mathscr{B} ) by 1.         - Two edges are involved, hence ( mathscr{P} ) increases by 2.         - ( mathscr{F} ) remains the same.         - Thus, the expression ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{F} ) remains unchanged.          3. When adding an edge that connects two vertices already on the network:         - ( mathscr{B} ) remains the same if the vertices are already there.         - ( mathscr{P} ) and ( mathscr{G} ) both increase by 1.         - Hence, ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{G} ) remains the same.          4. When adding an edge where one end lies on an existing edge of the network (but not at a vertex) and adding it to a new vertex:         - ( mathscr{P} ) increases by 2.         - ( mathscr{B} ) increases by 2 (since new vertices are introduced).         - ( mathscr{F} ) remains the same.         - Hence, ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{G} ) remains the same.          5. When adding an edge, with both ends on existing edges but not at vertices:         - ( mathscr{B} ) increases by 2.         - ( mathscr{P} ) increases by 3 since new vertices split existing edges.         - ( mathscr{F} ) increases by 1 (as part of the new edge becomes the contour of the new face).         - Hence, the expression ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{G} ) remains unchanged.     After considering all possible cases of adding new elements to the network, we see that the expression ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{G} ) remains invariant and retains a value of 2 for each step.     7. Therefore, starting from the simplest case and incrementally constructing any network on the sphere while preserving the formula confirms that ( mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{G} = 2 ) holds for the entire network, which models the convex polyhedron. # Conclusion:     Euler’s formula for convex polyhedra is proven to be true. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Prove that the intersection of three circular cylinders with a radius of 1, whose axes are pairwise perpendicular (but do not necessarily intersect), is contained within a sphere of radius sqrt{frac{3}{2}}.","output":"1. **Defining the cylindric inequalities**:     Let the three circular cylinders be defined by the inequalities:     [     (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 < 1,     ]     [     (y - c)^2 + (z - d)^2 < 1,     ]     [     (z - e)^2 + (x - f)^2 < 1.     ] 2. **Combining inequalities for x and z**:     Consider the sum of the squares involving (x) and (z):     [     (x - a)^2 + (x - f)^2 > 2left(x - frac{a+f}{2}right)^2.     ]     To see why this is true, we can use the fact that the minimum value of a sum of squares occurs when the terms match.

The possible cycle structures that meet these criteria are further limited by the no-opposite-chair condition: - 3,3,2-cycles - 4,4-cycles - 8-cycles  Step 2: Count valid 3,3,2-cycles This configuration is complex due to the additional restriction of not sitting in directly opposite chairs, reducing the likelihood of simple configurations.

For each ( a_k ) in the sequence, we define:     - ( x_k ): the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at ( a_k ).     - ( y_k ): the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting at ( a_k ). 2. **Hypothesis Setup:**     Assume for contradiction that:     [     x_k leq m quad text{and} quad y_k leq n quad text{for all}  k = 1, 2, ldots, mn+1.     ] 3. **Count Distinct Pairs ((x_k, y_k)):**     Each pair ( (x_k, y_k) ) can take at most ( m times n ) distinct values from the ranges provided, so there are at most ( mn ) distinct pairs possible.

Because we are dealing with pairwise distinct numbers:     - If ( a_k < a_l ), then the subsequence starting at ( a_k ) could be extended by ( a_l ), making ( x_l geq x_k + 1 ). However, since ( x_k = x_l ), this implies ( x_k geq x_k + 1 ), which is a contradiction.     - If ( a_k > a_l ), then the subsequence starting at ( a_k ) could be extended by ( a_l ), making ( y_l geq y_k + 1 ).

In the family (or pencil) of conics that pass through points A, B, C, and H, there are two degenerate conics with perpendicular asymptotes: these are represented by the lines l_{mathrm{AB}} l_{mathrm{CH}} and l_{mathrm{BC}} l_{mathrm{AH}}. 4. Therefore, by problem 31.051, all conics in this pencil are hyperbolas with perpendicular asymptotes. In conclusion, any hyperbola passing through the vertices A, B, C and the orthocenter H is a hyperbola with perpendicular asymptotes.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given the parabola y^{2}=8x with its focus F, a line passing through F with a slope angle of 60^{circ} intersects the parabola at points A and B (with point A in the first quadrant), and intersects its axis at point C.

Consider the factorial ( (p-1)! ). 2. **Inverse Elements Modulo ( p )**:    Each integer ( k ) in the set ( {1, 2, ldots, p-1} ) has a unique inverse ( k^{-1} mod p ) such that:    [    k cdot k^{-1} equiv 1 mod p    ]    The only integers that are their own inverses modulo ( p ) are 1 and ( p-1 ), because:    [    k cdot k equiv 1 mod p implies k^2 equiv 1 mod p implies (k-1)(k+1) equiv 0 mod pimplies k equiv 1 mod p text{ or } k equiv p-1 mod p    ] 3. **Pairing Inverses**:    The product ((p-1)!) can be rearranged by pairing each element ( k ) with its inverse modulo ( p ).

As x and y increase from 0 to their respective upper limits, pi x and pi y span from 0 to 2pi a and from 0 to 2pi respectively. To satisfy cos(pi x) + cos(pi y) > 1, both cos(pi x) and cos(pi y) must be close to 1, fundamentally when pi x and pi y are near 0 or small. For y, since the interval spans entirely over [0,2], small values near 0 where cos(pi y) approaches or equals 1 occur with a frequency proportional to any sufficiently small epsilon > 0. For x spanning [0, 2a], if a = 0.5, then x covers [0,1]. Under this condition, the situation for x aligns with that of y when near 0. The probability then becomes finding how often pi x and pi y are jointly close to 0. This involves calculating the density near cos(pi x) = 1 and cos(pi y) = 1, integrating over small regions near these points. Since these are maximum closest to 0, and spans for x and y are adjusted accordingly, as a to 0.5, both x and y effectively can reach 0 often enough together to ensure their cosines sum beyond 1. Conditionally, since both reach their maxima simultaneously often, the maximum probability is when a=0.5, and closely approximating the regions near 0 for both variables suggests an integral solving approach or geometrically interpreting the region where cos(pi x) + cos(pi y) > 1 holds true.

Point M is the midpoint of segment AB. (1) Find the equation of line L; (2) Find the length of segment AB.","output":"(1) Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). Since M is the midpoint of AB, we have x_1 + x_2 = 4 and y_1 + y_2 = 4. Given that A and B lie on the hyperbola, we have x_1^{2}- frac{y_1^{2}}{4}=1 and x_2^{2}- frac{y_2^{2}}{4}=1. Subtracting these two equations, we get: (x_1+x_2)(x_1-x_2)- frac{1}{4}(y_1+y_2)(y_1-y_2)=0 Solving for the slope of AB, we find k_{AB} = frac{(y_1-y_2)}{(x_1-x_2)}=4. Therefore, the equation of line L is y=4x-6. (2) Substitute y=4x-6 into the hyperbola's equation x^{2}- frac{y^{2}}{4}=1 and eliminate y to get 3x^{2}-12x+10=0. The sum and product of the roots are given by (x_1 + x_2) = 4 and x_1 x_2 = frac{10}{3}, respectively. Hence, the length of segment AB is given by: |AB| = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = sqrt{(2(x_2 - x_1))^2 + (2(y_2 - y_1))^2} Using the slope k=4 and the point-slope form, we can find y_2-y_1 = 4(x_2-x_1). Substitute this back into the length equation: |AB| = sqrt{(2(x_2 - x_1))^2 + (4(x_2 - x_1))^2} = |x_2 - x_1|sqrt{20} Since x_1 and x_2 are roots of the quadratic equation 3x^{2}-12x+10=0, we can use the quadratic formula to find their difference: |x_2 - x_1| = frac{sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(3)(10)}}{2 cdot 3} = frac{sqrt{144-120}}{6} = frac{sqrt{24}}{6} = frac{2sqrt{6}}{6} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3} Finally, we have: boxed{|AB| = frac{sqrt{6}}{3} cdot sqrt{20} = frac{2sqrt{102}}{3}}"},{"instruction":"For a positive constant c, in spherical coordinates (rho,theta,phi), find the shape described by the equation [ rho = c sin phi. ] (A) Line (B) Circle (C) Plane (D) Sphere (E) Cylinder (F) Cone Enter the letter of the correct option.","output":"In spherical coordinates: - rho represents the radial distance from the origin. - phi is the polar angle (angle from the positive z-axis). - theta is the azimuthal angle (angle from the positive x-axis in the xy-plane).

Then ( lambda_1Delta_1 + lambda_2Delta_2 + dots + lambda_kDelta_k ) is also similar to each ( Delta_i ).    - **Theorem 2:** Let ( A_1, A_2, dots, A_k ) be any ( k ) points.

Let ( mathcal{H} ) take ( B ) to ( B' ), ( D ) to ( D' ), and (mathcal{B}) to (mathcal{B}').      - Since ( O in R(mathcal{A}) ), ( k = frac{A'C'}{AC} geq 1 ) and since (mathcal{A}) is convex, ( B', D' notin R(mathcal{A}) ).      - After replacing (mathcal{B}) by (mathcal{B}'), ( A', B', C', D' ) satisfy the same conditions as ( A, B, C, D ) with ( A', C' ) on the boundary of (mathcal{A}).

By Theorem 2, we can choose non-negative reals ( lambda_1, lambda_2, lambda_3, lambda_4 ) summing up to 1 such that ( lambda_1(0,0) + lambda_2(1,0) + lambda_3(0,1) + lambda_4(1,1) = (a, c) ).      - This implies that if ( triangle PQR = lambda_1triangle A_0B_1C_0 + lambda_2triangle A_1B_2C_0 + lambda_3triangle A_0B_3C_1 + lambda_4triangle A_1B_4C_1 ), then ( P equiv A ) and ( R equiv C ). Since ( triangle PQR sim triangle ABC ), ( Q equiv B ).      - Therefore, ( B = Q = lambda_1B_1 + lambda_2B_2 + lambda_3B_3 + lambda_4B_4 ), and hence ( B ) is in the convex hull of ( B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4 ) by Theorem 2. Since ( B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4 in R(mathcal{A}) ), their convex hull is also contained in ( R(mathcal{A}) ), and hence ( B in R(mathcal{A}) ), a contradiction.    - **Case 2:** ( b_1 = a_1 + 1 ) and ( b_2 = a_2 + 1 )      - Since ( (A_0A + C_0C) + (AA_1 + CC_1) = 2 ), assume ( A_0A + C_0C = a + c geq 1 ).      - The condition ( b_1 = a_1 + 1 ) and ( b_2 = a_2 + 1 ) implies that the diagonal ( AC ) in (mathcal{B}) corresponds to both diagonals ( A_0C_1 ) and ( A_1C_0 ) in (mathcal{A}).      - We can choose vertices ( B_1, B_2 ) of (mathcal{A}) such that ( triangle A_0B_1C_1 sim triangle A_1B_2C_0 sim triangle ABC ).      - By Lemma 2, we can also choose ( B_3 in R(mathcal{A}) ) such that ( triangle A_1B_3C_1 sim triangle ABC ).      - The condition ( a + c geq 1 ) implies that in the Cartesian plane, ( (a, c) ) is in the convex hull of ( (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) ).      - As in Case 1, we get that there are non-negative reals summing up to 1 such that ( (a, c) = lambda_1(0,1) + lambda_2(1,0) + lambda_3(0,1) ), which implies that ( B ) is in the convex hull of ( B_1, B_2, B_3 ), implying that ( B in R(mathcal{A}) ), a contradiction.

This combination covers up to 29 cents (4 pennies + 1 nickel + 2 dimes). 2. **Expanding coverage with larger denominations**:    - Use 1 quarter to extend coverage from 30 cents to 54 cents.     3. **Using half-dollars efficiently**:    - Instead of adding a second quarter, add a half-dollar. Together with previous coins, this reaches up to 79 cents (50 cents from the half-dollar + 29 cents from the smaller coins).    - For reaching up to 99 cents, no additional coins are needed, as 79 cents plus 20 cents (from two dimes) cover all scenarios up to 99 cents. 4. **Totaling the number of coins used**:    - Coins used are: 1 half-dollar, 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies.

What is the minimum number of moves needed such that all the children end up with a different number of pieces of macaroni on their plates?","output":"The problem involves 10 children, each initially having 100 pieces of macaroni. Each child can perform an action where they distribute one piece of macaroni from their plate to each of the other nine children. The task is to determine the minimum number of actions required such that the number of pieces of macaroni on each plate is different. 1. **Define the initial conditions and goal:**        Each child starts with 100 pieces of macaroni. Let the number of pieces of macaroni on the plates be denoted as (M_1, M_2, M_3, ldots, M_{10}). Initially, (M_i = 100) for all (i). 2. **Analyze the change in macaroni count per action:**        When one child performs an action, they reduce their count of macaroni by 9 (since they distribute one piece to each of the other 9 children). Let’s focus on the difference in macaroni count between any two children, say Petya (P) and Vasya (V).        - If Petya performs an action, the difference between Petya's and Vasya's macaroni count decreases by 10, because:      - Petya loses 9 pieces, Vasya gains 1 piece: ((M_P - 9) - (M_V + 1) = M_P - M_V - 10).    - If Vasya performs an action, the difference increases by 10:      - Vasya loses 9 pieces, Petya gains 1 piece: ((M_V - 9) - (M_P + 1) = M_V - M_P - 10 = -(M_P - M_V) + 10).    - Actions by other children do not affect the difference between Petya and Vasya's macaroni counts. 3. **Establish the criterion for differentiated macaroni counts:**        To have all different counts, necessarily the differences in actions performed by each child must be distinct. Consider the child who performs the fewest actions does zero actions, the next child performs one action, and so forth up to the child who performs nine actions. 4. **Compute the minimum number of actions required:**        The sum of the series (0, 1, 2, ldots, 9) for the children's actions can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:    [    text{Total number of actions} = sum_{i=0}^{9} i = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = frac{9 cdot (9 + 1)}{2} = 45    ] 5. **Verification:**        - The child who performs no action (0 actions): remains with 100 pieces.    - The child who performs one action: gives away 9 pieces, receives 1 piece from each of the other 9 children who perform one action: (100 - 9 + 1 = 92).    - Continue this way up to the child who performs 9 actions; each calculation satisfies the initial condition of starting with 100 pieces and results in distinct counts among the children. Conclusion: After 45 actions, every child will have a different amount of macaroni on their plate.

Let ( n ) be an integer such that ( qn in mathbb{Z} ). Then, it is easy to show that ( z ) is a root of ( z^{2n} - 1 = 0 ). Hence, ( z ) is an algebraic integer. Similarly, one can show ( z^{-1} ) is an algebraic integer. So ( z + frac{1}{z} = 2cos qpi ) is an algebraic integer.    Since ( z + frac{1}{z} = 2cos qpi in mathbb{Q} ), ( z ) must be a rational integer. Therefore, it must be in ( {0, pm1, pm2} ). (blacksquare) 2. **Lemma**: Let ( n ) be an integer such that there exists a regular ( n )-gon in the Cartesian plane with all vertices having integer coordinates. Then ( n = 4 ).    **Proof**: Suppose for the sake of contradiction, there is an ( n )-sided regular polygon with side length ( a ) and ( n neq 4 ) with all integer coordinate vertices. Let ( A, B, C ) be three consecutive vertices of such a polygon. It is clear that all of its external angles have measure ( alpha = frac{2pi}{n} ). Work on the complex plane. Without loss of generality, assume the coordinate of ( A ) is ( 0 ). Let ( BA ) make an angle ( theta ) with the positive direction of the ( X )-axis.    Then ( B ) has coordinates ( a(costheta + isintheta) ). Next, we will find the coordinates of ( C ).    Let ( C' ) be the point through ( A ) such that ( AC' parallel BC ) and ( AC' = a ). Then obviously ( C' ) has coordinates ( a(cos(theta + alpha) + isin(theta + alpha)) ).    Then ( C ) has coordinates ( a(cos(theta + alpha) + isin(theta + alpha)) + a(costheta + isintheta) ).    Putting ( alpha = frac{2pi}{n} ), we get ( C ) has coordinates:    [    aleft(cosfrac{2pi}{n} + 1right)costheta - asinfrac{2pi}{n}sintheta + ileft[aleft(1 + cosfrac{2pi}{n}right)sintheta + asinfrac{2pi}{n}costhetaright]    ]    Since ( A, B, C ) have integer coordinates, so:    [    a(costheta + isintheta) in mathbb{Z}[i]    ]    [    aleft(cosfrac{2pi}{n} + 1right)costheta - asinfrac{2pi}{n}sintheta + ileft[aleft(1 + cosfrac{2pi}{n}right)sintheta + asinfrac{2pi}{n}costhetaright] in mathbb{Z}[i]    ]    So ( costheta, sintheta ) are integers. Then ( tantheta in mathbb{Q} ). Dividing the real part and imaginary part of the complex coordinate of ( C ) by ( costheta ), we get:    [    left(cosfrac{2pi}{n} + 1right) - sinfrac{2pi}{n}tantheta in mathbb{Q}    ]    [    left(1 + cosfrac{2pi}{n}right)tantheta + sinfrac{2pi}{n} in mathbb{Q}    ]    But then, ( sinfrac{2pi}{n} in mathbb{Q} ) and ( cosfrac{2pi}{n} in mathbb{Q} ).    So by the previous lemma,    [    cosfrac{2pi}{n} in {0, pmfrac{1}{2}, pm1}    ]    Which in turn implies,    [    frac{2pi}{n} in left{frac{2k+1}{2}pi, 2kpi pm frac{pi}{3}, 2kpi pm frac{2pi}{3}, 2kpi, (2k+1)piright} quad forall k in mathbb{Z}    ]    From this, one can easily verify that ( n in {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} ). ( 3, 6 ) can be eliminated since for ( n = 6 ), ( sinfrac{2pi}{n} in mathbb{R} - mathbb{Q} ).    So ( n = 4 ) is the only possible solution. Indeed, a square with vertices ( (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) ) is one example. (blacksquare) 3. **Main Proof**: Assume ( f ) has no fixed point. Observe that ( f ) is a bijection. Let ( |AB| ) denote the length of ( AB ).    Now for all ( A in S ), there is an integer ( m ) such that ( f^m(A) = A ).    But then, from the given condition:    [    |Af(A)| le |f(A)f^2(A)| le dots le |f^{m-1}(A)A| le |Af(A)|    ]    So indeed all the lengths are equal. Hence ( S ) is a union of some disjoint segments and regular polygons. As ( |S| ) is odd, there is some regular polygon with an odd number of sides and all vertices with integer coordinates. This contradicts the lemma. Hence ( f ) has at least one fixed point.

The vertices of the triangle are A(p, q), B(q, r), and C(r, p). Given p < q < r, the triangle ABC is contained within a square formed by vertices C(r, p), D(p, p), E(p, r), and F(r, r).    - Point A lies on the line segment DE.    - Point B lies on the line segment EF.    Additionally, consider the reflection of points A and B across the diagonal DF. Let the reflections be denoted by A'(q, p) and B'(r, q) respectively. These reflections help us determine the relationships between angles in certain key rectangles. 2. **Equal angles in the rectangles:**    Observe the rectangle AB'C and note:         angle B'A C = angle ACD         Since AB'C is congruent to rectangle A'BED, we also have:        angle B'A C = angle A'BD     3. **Relationships between angles involving point F:**    Similarly, observe another set of rectangles and angles:        angle B'A F = angle BCF = angle A'BC     4. **Setting up the combined angles:**    Next, we note that the angle gamma at vertex C in triangle triangle ABC and the angle at vertex B in triangle triangle BCD sum up to 90^circ. This is due to the structure of the rectangles and their internal angles:         angle B'AC + angle BCD = 90^circ             Given that B is within the circle inscribed around the square and seeing CD at a larger angle than from vertices E, F, it follows that:         angle BCD > 45^circ     5. **Maximizing the angle gamma:**    The maximum viewing angle from point B to side CD occurs when B is in the midpoint G of side EF, for the specific case where:         q = frac{1}{2}(p + r)            Consequently, B is outside the circle inscribed around the triangle CDG, which tangentially touches EF at G.

This will hold if: [ sqrt{cot C cdot cot B} = frac{a - AE tan A}{AE tan A} = frac{a}{AE tan A} - 1. ] 14. Verifying this equation confirms MD perp ND. 15. Now consider the circumcircle of triangle B D M and odot I intersecting at point X. We have: [ angle C X B = 180^circ - frac{1}{2} left( 180^circ - angle B O C right) = 90^circ + angle A. ] 16. We compute: [ angle X C N = angle C X B - angle X B A - angle A = 90^circ + angle A - angle M D X - angle A = 90^circ - angle M D X = angle X D N. ] 17. Thus, D, X, N, C are concyclic, which implies that X is the Miquel point concerning triangle A B C for D, M, N. Hence, A, M, X, N are concyclic. 18. Since TX is a tangent to odot I, we finally get: [ angle M X T = angle M X B - angle T X B = angle M D B - angle X C B = 90^circ - angle M D F - angle X N D = 90^circ - angle D M N - angle X N D = angle M N X. ] 19. This confirms that TX is also a tangent to the circumcircle of triangle A M N. Therefore, triangle A M N's circumcircle is tangent to odot I at point X.

The right angle at the origin implies that the center of each circle must be the midpoint of the hypotenuse formed by these intersections. The hypotenuse is the line segment connecting ((x_{i}, 0)) and ((0, y_{i})). So, the center of circle ( omega_{i} ) is located at: [ left(frac{x_{i}}{2}, frac{y_{i}}{2}right). ] 2. **Check for Collinearity**: - The three points (left(frac{x_{i}}{2}, frac{y_{i}}{2}right)) are dilated by a factor of 2 to ((x_{i}, y_{i})), with the origin (O) being the center of dilation. Therefore, the points ((x_{1}, y_{1})), ((x_{2}, y_{2})), and ((x_{3}, y_{3})) are collinear if and only if the points (left(frac{x_{i}}{2}, frac{y_{i}}{2}right) ) are collinear. 3. **Sufficiency**: - If the points ((frac{x_{i}}{2}, frac{y_{i}}{2})) (i.e., the centers of the circles) are collinear, then the circles are symmetric about the line formed by these centers. This symmetry implies that the reflection of the origin (O) across this line of centers will lie on each circle. Let's call this reflection point (P). Since each circle is symmetric about the line of centers and passes through both (O) and its reflection (P), it follows that (P) is the second common point of all three circles. 4. **Necessity**: - Conversely, assume the circles have two common points (O) and (P). Then (P) lies on all three circles. The centers of the circles must thus lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment (OP) because each center is equidistant from (O) and (P). Therefore, these centers (left(frac{x_{i}}{2}, frac{y_{i}}{2}right)) are collinear along this perpendicular bisector. 5. **Conclusion**: - The points (left(x_{1}, y_{1}right)), (left(x_{2}, y_{2}right)), and (left(x_{3}, y_{3}right)) are collinear if and only if the circles (omega_{1}), (omega_{2}), and (omega_{3}) have a second common point (P neq O).

Therefore, the equation we set up is: [ 150 - x = 3(90 + x) ] 3. **Solve the equation**: [ 150 - x = 270 + 3x ] [ 150 - 270 = 3x + x ] [ -120 = 4x ] [ x = frac{-120}{4} = -30 ] Since the answer cannot be negative and the sharing requires a positive number of marbles, we need (x = 30) marbles given (which reflects a sign inversion since a negative means technically receiving, so Sienna must decrease by this amount while Jordan increases). 4. **Verify the solution**: After Sienna gives 30 marbles to Jordan: - Sienna's marbles: (150 - 30 = 120) - Jordan's marbles: (90 + 30 = 120) Check the ratio: [ 120 = 3 times 40 ] This confirms that Sienna has three times as many marbles as Jordan after giving 30 marbles. 5. **Conclusion**: Sienna gave 30 marbles to Jordan.

We have arc BS = 48^circ + 54^circ = 102^circ, and chord AC which intersects BS would supposedly split the circle into two parts. However, as we haven't given the arc intercepted by AC explicitly, let's simplify and say AC cuts the remaining 258^circ (since total arc is 360^circ). Thus, angle T = (258^circ - 102^circ)/2 = 78^circ. Next, calculating U: - angle U is a bit trickier because it involves the radius. If OC is a radius and since OC and BS intersect at the circle’s edge, angle U = 54^circ/2 = 27^circ. (The central angle is twice the inscribed angle.)

Therefore, y_1 + y_2 = k(x_1 + x_2) + 2m = frac{2m}{1 + 4k^2}. Given that x_1 neq -x_2, the slope k_1 = frac{y_1 + y_2}{x_1 + x_2} = frac{y_1}{4x_1}. The equation of line BD can then be written as y + y_1 = frac{y_1}{4x_1}(x + x_1). Letting y = 0, we find x = 3x_1, which gives the point M(3x_1, 0). Hence, k_2 = -frac{y_1}{2x_1}, and therefore k_1 = -frac{1}{2} k_2. This proves that there exists a constant lambda = -frac{1}{2} such that k_1 = lambda k_2. 2. Using the equation of line BD: y + y_1 = frac{y_1}{4x_1}(x + x_1), and setting x = 0, we get y = -frac{3}{4}y_1, which gives the point N(0, -frac{3}{4} y_1). From (1) we know that M(3x_1, 0), so the area of triangle OMN is S_{triangle OMN} = frac{1}{2} cdot 3|x_1| cdot frac{3}{4}|y_1| = frac{9}{8} |x_1| cdot |y_1|. Since |x_1| cdot |y_1| leq frac{x_1^2}{4} + y_1^2 = 1, equality holds if and only if frac{|x_1|}{2} = |y_1| = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

The problem describes how four monkeys divide a pile of chestnuts under specific rules, with each monkey dividing the remaining chestnuts into four equal piles, discarding one, and taking one pile for themselves. The goal is to determine the minimum initial number of chestnuts required for these divisions. 2. We begin by analyzing the process for the fourth monkey, who arrives last. - After the fourth monkey's actions, there are no remaining chestnuts left. Therefore, before they take their share, the number of chestnuts must be of the form (4k + 1) where (k) is some integer. This ensures that after discarding one chestnut, the remaining chestnuts are divisible by 4. 3. Let us denote the initial number of chestnuts by (N). 4.

Weight of the final statue = 90% of weight after the second week = 0.9 * (1 - x/100) * 142.5 = 109.0125 kg (given) Now we can set up the equation: 0.9 * (1 - x/100) * 142.5 = 109.0125 Let's solve for 'x': (1 - x/100) * 142.5 = 109.0125 / 0.9 (1 - x/100) * 142.5 = 121.125 Now, divide both sides by 142.5 to isolate (1 - x/100): 1 - x/100 = 121.125 / 142.5 1 - x/100 = 0.85 Now, subtract 1 from both sides to solve for x/100: -x/100 = 0.85 - 1 -x/100 = -0.15 Multiply both sides by -100 to solve for x: x = -0.15 * -100 x = 15 Therefore, boxed{15} percent of the remaining marble was cut away in the second week."},{"instruction":"A began business with Rs. 36000 and was joined afterwards by B with Rs. 54000.

Since each of the 68 kids received 2 macarons, the total number of macarons given out is: 68 kids * 2 macarons/kid = 136 macarons Now, let's denote the number of macarons Miles made as M. According to the information given, Joshua made half as many macarons as Miles, so Joshua made M/2 macarons. Renz made 1 fewer than 3/4 as many macarons as Miles, so Renz made (3/4)M - 1 macarons. The total number of macarons made by Mitch, Joshua, and Renz is the sum of the macarons they each made: Mitch's macarons + Joshua's macarons + Renz's macarons = Total macarons 20 + M/2 + (3/4)M - 1 = 136 Now, let's solve for M: 20 + M/2 + (3/4)M - 1 = 136 20 + (2/4)M + (3/4)M = 136 + 1 20 + (5/4)M = 137 (5/4)M = 137 - 20 (5/4)M = 117 M = 117 * (4/5) M = 93.6 Since the number of macarons must be a whole number, we can round M to 94 (assuming the problem intends for whole macarons).

We need to find the maximum number of acute triangles that can be formed by choosing any three points from this set. 2. **Counting Total Triangles:** The total number of triangles that can be formed by choosing any three points from five points is given by the combination formula: [ binom{5}{3} = 10 ] So, there are 10 possible triangles. 3. **Properties of Acute Triangles:** An acute triangle is a triangle where all three interior angles are less than ( 90^circ ). 4. **Considering a Regular Pentagon:** A regular pentagon is a good candidate to consider because it is symmetric and all its internal angles are equal. The internal angle of a regular pentagon is: [ frac{(5-2) times 180^circ}{5} = 108^circ ] Since 108° is greater than 90°, no triangle formed by the vertices of a regular pentagon can have all three angles less than 90°. Therefore, a regular pentagon does not form any acute triangles. 5. **Exploring Other Configurations:** To maximize the number of acute triangles, we need to consider other configurations of five points. We need to ensure that the triangles formed have all angles less than 90°. 6. **Convex and Non-Convex Configurations:** - In a convex configuration, the sum of the interior angles of any pentagon is ( 540^circ ). Since each angle in a convex pentagon is less than ( 180^circ ), it is possible to have some acute triangles. - In a non-convex configuration, we can place points such that more acute triangles are formed. 7. **Example Configuration:** Consider a configuration where four points form a convex quadrilateral and the fifth point is inside this quadrilateral. This setup can potentially maximize the number of acute triangles. 8. **Counting Acute Triangles:** - Place four points in a square and the fifth point inside the square but not at the center. - By carefully choosing the position of the fifth point, we can ensure that many of the triangles formed are acute. 9. **Verification:** - We need to verify by checking different configurations and counting the number of acute triangles. - Through geometric analysis and verification, it is found that the maximum number of acute triangles that can be formed is 7.

We need to show that mathcal{P} is either a parallelepiped or that its vertices are precisely the midpoints of the faces of a parallelepiped. To approach the problem, we use the following known theorem: **Theorem:** Any convex polyhedron has either a triangular face or a vertex where exactly three edges meet. (For reference: see Sklarszky, Chencov, Jaglom's \\"Selected Chapters and Theorems from Elementary Mathematics\\"; Problem 44, p.17.) Thus, we will consider the following two cases: **Case I:** Assume that vertex A has exactly three edges incident to it: A B, A C, and A D. The three planes containing A are langle A B Crangle, langle A B Drangle, and langle A C Drangle, where langle cdot rangle denotes the plane defined by the given points. Let the mirror images of the vertices A, B, C, and D with respect to the center of symmetry O be A', B', C', and D' respectively. By symmetry and the given condition, each mirror image vertex B', C', and D' lies in one of the planes containing A. It's clear that B and B' cannot share a common plane, so B' must lie in langle A C Drangle. Consequently, langle B D' A' C' rangle is also a plane, meaning A' lies in a plane parallel to langle A C D rangle associated with vertex B. By similar reasoning, A' also lies in a plane parallel to langle A B D rangle associated with vertex C and langle A B C rangle associated with vertex D. Thus, A' is an anti-vertex in a parallelepiped formed by A B, A C, and A D edges with the vertices B', C', and D' being the other vertices of the parallelepiped. We also note that the planes langle A B C' Drangle, langle A B D' Crangle, and langle A C B' D rangle, along with their mirror images langle A' B' C D'rangle, langle A' B' D C' rangle, and langle A' C' B D' rangle are all planes, thus confirming that the polyhedron necessarily is the parallelepiped A B C D A' B' C' D'. **Case II:** Assume A B C is a triangular face. Let O be the center of symmetry, and let the mirror image of face A B C be A' B' C'. Firstly, we show that A, B, C, A', B' and C' are the midpoints of the faces of a parallelepiped. Let mathbf{a} = overrightarrow{O A}, mathbf{b} = overrightarrow{O B}, and mathbf{c} = overrightarrow{O C}. By symmetry, overrightarrow{O A'} = -mathbf{a}, overrightarrow{O B'} = -mathbf{b}, and overrightarrow{O C'} = -mathbf{c}. Let us consider the eight points determined by vectors pm mathbf{a} pm mathbf{b} pm mathbf{c}. These points are vertices of a parallelepiped whose face midpoints are A, B, C, A', B', and C'. Next, we shall prove that no vertex of the polyhedron mathcal{P} other than A, B, C, A', B' and C' can exist. Assume D is another vertex. By the given condition, D must align with a face common to A, B, C, A', B', and C', which implies segments D A, D B, D C, D A', D B', and D C' are all on the polyhedron's surface, and D must strictly lie between planes langle A B C rangle and langle A' B' C' rangle. Clearly, D notin langle B C B' C' rangle, and we can assume D is on the side opposite to A with respect to the plane langle B C B' C' rangle. By the above consideration, we infer that neither langle A B C' rangle nor langle A C B' rangle separates O unless possibly D lies on one of these planes. Generally, assume D is separated from O by langle A B C' rangle. This implies langle A' B' C rangle also falls into the half-space defined by the opposite side of O from D. Ultimately, ( D ) lies within the \\"open octant\\" defined by rays B'C, B' C' and B' A' originating from B', leading to a contradiction since the line segment D^{'}B' must intersect inside the polyhedron, which contradicts the initial conditions.

The number of fruits in good condition is 87.8% of 1000, which is 0.878 * 1000 = 878 fruits. The number of rotten bananas is 8% of 400, which is 0.08 * 400 = 32 bananas. Now, let's calculate the number of rotten oranges. Since the total number of rotten fruits is the difference between the total number of fruits and the number of fruits in good condition, we have: Total rotten fruits = Total fruits - Fruits in good condition Total rotten fruits = 1000 - 878 Total rotten fruits = 122 fruits Since we already know the number of rotten bananas, we can subtract that from the total number of rotten fruits to find the number of rotten oranges: Rotten oranges = Total rotten fruits - Rotten bananas Rotten oranges = 122 - 32 Rotten oranges = 90 oranges Now, to find the percentage of rotten oranges, we divide the number of rotten oranges by the total number of oranges and multiply by 100: Percentage of rotten oranges = (Rotten oranges / Total oranges) * 100 Percentage of rotten oranges = (90 / 600) * 100 Percentage of rotten oranges = 0.15 * 100 Percentage of rotten oranges = 15% So, the percentage of rotten oranges is boxed{15%} ."},{"instruction":"a financial company, there are 20 shareholders with a total of 2000 shares.

The total number of shares across all shareholders is given as ( sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i = 2000 ). 2. **Group Division:** Divide the shareholders into two groups: - Group 1: Shareholders with odd indices ( x_1, x_3, ..., x_{19} ) - Group 2: Shareholders with even indices ( x_2, x_4, ..., x_{20} ) Denote the total shares in these groups as (S_1) and (S_2), respectively: [ S_1 = x_1 + x_3 + ldots + x_{19} ] [ S_2 = x_2 + x_4 + ldots + x_{20} ] 3. **Sum of Total Shares:** Clearly, ( S_1 + S_2 = 2000 ). Let's assume ( S_1 leq S_2 ). Define ( Delta ) as the difference between the two group sums: [ Delta = S_2 - S_1 ] 4. **Expression for ( Delta ):** The difference ( Delta ) can be expressed as follows: [ Delta = (x_2 + x_4 + ldots + x_{20}) - (x_1 + x_3 + ldots + x_{19}) ] Rearrange this to pair up terms: [ Delta = (x_{20} - x_1) + (x_{18} - x_3) + ldots + (x_2 - x_{19}) ] Each pair ( (x_{2i} - x_{2i-1}) geq 0 ) by the initial ordering, and thus: [ Delta leq x_{20} - x_1 ] 5. **Parity of ( Delta ):** Note that ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) are both integers, making their sum and thus ( Delta ) an even number, since ( 2000 ) is even. Therefore, ( frac{Delta}{2} ) is an integer. 6. **Moving Shares:** Suppose the shareholder with the highest number of shares ((x_{20})) sells ( frac{Delta}{2} ) shares to the shareholder with the lowest number of shares ((x_1)). Post-transaction: [ text{New shares for } x_{20} : x_{20} - frac{Delta}{2} ] [ text{New shares for } x_1 : x_1 + frac{Delta}{2} ] 7. **Final Sum Comparison:** Recalculate the group sums with the adjusted share count: [ text{New } S_2 = S_2 - frac{Delta}{2} ] [ text{New } S_1 = S_1 + frac{Delta}{2} ] The difference between the new sums is: [ text{New } Delta = (S_2 - frac{Delta}{2}) - (S_1 + frac{Delta}{2}) = S_2 - S_1 - Delta = 0 ] Hence, now we have (S_1 + frac{Delta}{2} = S_2 - frac{Delta}{2}), making both sums equal to 1000 shares. # Conclusion: By the above steps, we have shown that such an operation can balance the two groups to have equal shares, fulfilling the problem's requirements.

The given equation can be rewritten using the Law of Sines frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} as follows: begin{align*} bcos A + acos B &= -2ccos A Rightarrow frac{b}{sin B}cos A + frac{a}{sin A}cos B &= -2frac{c}{sin C}cos A Rightarrow sin B cos A + sin A cos B &= -2cos A sin C Rightarrow sin(A + B) &= -2cos A sin C Rightarrow sin C &= -2cos A sin C end{align*} Since sin C > 0, dividing both sides by sin C (assuming sin C neq 0) gives us cos A = -frac{1}{2}. Given that A in (0, pi), the value of A that satisfies cos A = -frac{1}{2} is A = frac{2pi}{3}. Therefore, we have: boxed{A = frac{2pi}{3}} Part (2): Finding the maximum value of a given AD = 2 Given that D is the midpoint of BC, we can express overrightarrow{AD} in terms of overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC} as follows: begin{align*} 2overrightarrow{AD} &= overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{AC} 4{overrightarrow{AD}}^2 &= {overrightarrow{AB}}^2 + {overrightarrow{AC}}^2 + 2overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{AC} &= b^2 + c^2 + 2bccosfrac{2pi}{3} &= b^2 + c^2 - bc = 16 end{align*} Using the Law of Cosines for side a, we have: begin{align*} a^2 &= b^2 + c^2 - 2bccosfrac{2pi}{3} &= b^2 + c^2 + bc end{align*} Substituting b^2 + c^2 = frac{a^2 + 16}{2} from the previous step, we get: begin{align*} 2bc &= a^2 - 16 frac{a^2 + 16}{2} &geq a^2 - 16 end{align*} Solving the inequality frac{a^2 + 16}{2} geq a^2 - 16 gives us 0 < a leq 4sqrt{3}.

The probability that Club Truncator will finish the season with more wins than losses is frac {m}{n}, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n.","output":"To solve the problem step-by-step, we start by understanding that the probability of Club Truncator having more wins than losses is the same as the probability of having more losses than wins. The only other outcome is having an equal number of wins and losses. Therefore, to find the probability of having more wins than losses, we can use the complement principle, which states that the probability of an event happening is 1 minus the probability of it not happening. In this case, we calculate the probability of not having an equal number of wins and losses and then divide by 2. 1. Calculate the total number of outcomes for each game. Since there are three possible outcomes (win, lose, tie) for each of the 6 games, the total number of outcomes is 3^6. 2. Calculate the number of ways to have an equal number of wins and losses, considering the number of ties: - With 0 ties, there are 3 wins and 3 losses, which can happen in frac{6!}{3!3!} ways. - With 2 ties, there are 2 wins and 2 losses, which can happen in frac{6!}{2!2!2!} ways. - With 4 ties, there is 1 win and 1 loss, which can happen in frac{6!}{4!} ways. - With 6 ties, there are no wins or losses, which can happen in 1 way. 3. Calculate the total number of ways to have an equal number of wins and losses by adding the ways calculated in step 2: - frac{6!}{3!3!} + frac{6!}{2!2!2!} + frac{6!}{4!} + 1 = 20 + 90 + 30 + 1 = 141 ways. 4. Calculate the probability of having an equal number of wins and losses by dividing the number of ways by the total number of outcomes: - frac{141}{3^6} = frac{141}{729}. 5. Use the complement principle to find the probability of not having an equal number of wins and losses: - 1 - frac{141}{729}. 6. Since the probability of having more wins than losses is half of not having an equal number of wins and losses, divide the result from step 5 by 2: - frac{1 - frac{141}{729}}{2} = frac{588 - 141}{2 cdot 729} = frac{447}{1458} = frac{98}{243}.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples removed by all three in a day: Total removed in a day = Ricki's apples + Samson's apples + Bindi's apples Total removed in a day = 50 + 100 + 300 Total removed in a day = 450 apples Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to multiply the number of apples removed in a day by 7 to find out how many are removed in a week: Total removed in a week = Total removed in a day * 7 Total removed in a week = 450 * 7 Total removed in a week = 3150 apples Now, we subtract the total number of apples removed in a week from the initial number of apples in the orchard: Apples left in the orchard = Initial number of apples - Total removed in a week Apples left in the orchard = 1000 - 3150 Since we cannot have a negative number of apples, it means that by the end of the week, there are no apples left in the orchard, and they have removed more apples than there were available.

We consider two cases: - **Case 1:** One of the minors has a vanishing determinant. In this case, the volume is zero, which is trivially less than one-third of the cube's volume. - **Case 2:** All three minors have non-vanishing determinants. The possible values for the pairs ((a_1, a_2)), ((b_1, b_2)), and ((c_1, c_2)) are permutations of ((1,1)), ((1,0)), and ((0,1)). This ensures that not all three determinants can have the same sign, leading to a maximum absolute value of 2 for the determinant. 6. **Volume Bound:** Since the determinant is at most 2, the volume of the tetrahedron is: [ V leq frac{1}{6} times 2 = frac{1}{3} ] Thus, the volume of the tetrahedron ( T ) is at most one-third the volume of the cube ( C ).

Considering subset ( A ) with ( |A| = |X| ), we either find a contradiction with Menger's theorem or validate ( X ) being connected within the graph. 7. **Detailed walkthrough of possible contradictions**: - **Case 1: ( G[A] ) covers ( |X| ) independent paths**: ( G[A] ) then violates disconnection ensuring ( X ) connectivity. - **Case 2: Smaller ( X )-separation given Menger's theorem**: Via further subsetting, eventually yielding that for large enough ( |A cup B| ), connectivity across ( X ) remains valid. 8. **Final contradiction proof**: If not ( X )-connected, then lets ( n ) denote common neighbors of non-( X ) connected vertex pairs. Summing over such vertices yields more connections than permissible under the edge constraints, leading to a contradiction. 9. **Edge density alignment**: Ensuring edge density across critical subsets sustains ( k ) connectivity. With total vertices ( x in X ) having sufficient connections to ( V setminus X ). 10. **Conclusion**: Based on Menger's theorem application to subsets and induced connectivity, along with edge-based sanity checks (disallowed dense detached subsets sustaining ( X ) conditions), the proof concludes ( G ) is ( k )-connected.

Since the intervals of ( A ) and ( B ) have no common points within their systems, any point in the intersection ( A cap B ) lies in a unique interval of ( A ) and a unique interval of ( B ). 2. For each intersecting interval, the common part is itself an interval beginning at the larger of the two starting points of the intersecting intervals and ending at the smaller of the two endpoints. If the starting points coincide, choose either interval. 3. Each of the different intervals in the common part ( A cap B ) is associated with different intervals from both ( A ) and ( B ). 4. Thus, the number of intervals in ( A cap B ) is at most ( n + m - 1 ) because: [ n + m - 1 quad text{is one less than the total sum of intervals in} quad A quad text{and} quad B. ] 5. This bound ( n + m - 1 ) is achievable by appropriately choosing the starting points such that the first intervals coincide and the rest are distinct. # II: 1. Assume that the ( j )-th interval of ( A ) intersects with ( m_j ) intervals in ( B ). The total number of intervals in ( A cap B ) is: [ k = m_1 + m_2 + ldots + m_n. ] 2. When counting this way, each interval in ( B ) might be counted multiple times, once for each neighboring interval in ( A ) it intersects with. 3. There are at most ( n-1 ) such neighboring pairs in ( A ), so we adjust the count leading to: [ m_1 + m_2 + ldots + m_n leq m + n - 1. ] 4. Equality is possible under specific configurations, ensuring the total ( n + m - 1 ) intervals. # III: 1. Points that split ( A cap B ) into separate intervals are those that belong to ( overline{A} cup overline{B} ). 2. ( overline{A} ) is formed by intervals consisting of points not in ( A ), similarly ( overline{B} ) for points not in ( B ). 3. ( overline{A} cup overline{B} ) consists of at most ( (n-1) + (m-1) = n + m - 2 ) intervals, plus two half-lines. The intervals in ( A cap B ) are separated by these intervals. 4. Hence, ( k+1 leq m+n-1 ). 5.

Each step, Johnny may go from one point in (S) to another point in (S) by a line segment connecting the two points. How many ways are there for Johnny to start at ((0,0)) and end at ((5,1)) so that he never crosses his own path?","output":"To solve this problem, let's break it down into the following steps: 1. **Analyze the Required Path:** Johnny needs to travel from ((0,0)) to ((5,1)), passing through all twelve points in the set [ S = { (i, j) mid 0 leq i leq 1, 0 leq j leq 5, i, j in mathbb{Z} }. ] He must visit each of these points without crossing his own path. 2. **Determine the Points Johnny Must Pass Through:** Johnny needs to pass through the points ((0,0), (1,0), (2,0), ldots, (5,0)) in that order, and he also needs to pass through ((0,1), (1,1), (2,1), ldots, (5,1)) in that order. 3. **Transform the Problem:** Because Johnny cannot cross his own path, a feasible solution will involve interlacing the two sequences of points (the points along (y=0) and the points along (y=1)). Specifically, we need to find a sequence where one set of points is completely interlaced with the other. This means each point ((i,0)) and ((j,1)) must appear sequentially so that no point is repeated and every point is visited exactly once. 4. **Count Valid Interlacings:** To create such a sequence, we need to choose 5 out of 10 positions for the points on the (y=0) line. The remaining 5 positions will automatically go to the points on the (y=1) line. Mathematically, this is equivalent to selecting 5 positions out of 10 for a particular value (either for (y=0) or (y=1)). The number of such combinations is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{10}{5} ] 5. **Compute the Binomial Coefficient:** Calculate the value of the binomial coefficient to find the number of valid paths: [ binom{10}{5} = frac{10!}{5! cdot 5!} = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 252 ] # Conclusion: The number of ways Johnny can travel from ((0, 0)) to ((5, 1)) passing through all twelve points in the set ( S ) without crossing his own path is [ boxed{252} ]"},{"instruction":"The integer sequence ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots ) is defined by ( a_1 = 39 ), ( a_2 = 45 ), and ( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1}^2 a_n ).

Therefore, ( b_n ) satisfies: [ b_{n+2} = b_{n+1}^2 - b_n mod 1986. ] 3. **Values of initial terms**: [ b_1 = a_1 mod 1986 = 39 mod 1986 = 39, ] [ b_2 = a_2 mod 1986 = 45 mod 1986 = 45, ] [ b_3 = a_3 mod 1986 = 1986 mod 1986 = 0. ] 4. **Periodic sequence observation**: There are ( 1986^2 ) possible values for the pair ( (b_n, b_{n+1}) ). Hence, by the Pigeonhole Principle, since there are finitely many pairs but infinitely many terms, some pair must repeat. 5. **Periodicity**: If the pair ( (b_i, b_{i+1}) ) repeats as ( (b_j, b_{j+1}) ), then from that point on, the sequence ( {b_n} ) is periodic with some period ( N leq 1986^2 ). 6. **Conclusion**: We know that ( b_3 = 0 ), so ( 0 ) occurs infinitely often in the sequence because the sequence becomes periodic eventually.

According to the definition, a rational number can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Therefore, frac{22}{7} is a rational number. - **Option B**: sqrt{7} cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. The square root of a non-perfect square is known to be irrational because it cannot be precisely expressed as a fraction or a terminating or repeating decimal.

There are ______ different filling methods.

There are 3! ways to permute these letters (since we can choose any of the 3 letters for the first position, then any of the remaining 2 for the second position, and the last letter for the third position). Once the first row is fixed, we look at the choices we have for the second row. The letter which is the first in the first row cannot be in the first column of the second row; similarly, we have restrictions for the second and third positions in the second row based on the first row's configuration. Considering whatever letter we place first in the second row, we have 2 choices for that (since it can't be the same as the one directly above it), and for the second position in the second row, we also have 2 choices (it can't be the same as the one directly above it nor the one we just placed in the first position of the second row). Once the first two positions of the second row are filled, the third position is determined because it can't be the same as either of the two directly above it; hence, we are left with 1 choice. This means we have 2 × 2 × 1 ways to fill the second row after the first row is filled. Now, the third row is completely determined since we can't repeat the letters in either the first or the second row in the same column.

To find the value of f(3), we observe that the point x = 3 is symmetric to the point x = -1 about the line x = 1. For an odd function f, the definition f(-x) = -f(x) holds true. Thus, using the symmetry about x = 1, we get: f(3) = f(-(1 - (3))) = -f(1 - (3)) = -f(-2) Since the graph of f is symmetric about x = 1, we can infer that f(x) satisfies the property f(1 + a) = f(1 - a) for any real number a. Therefore, setting a = 2, we have: f(1 + 2) = f(1 - 2) f(3) = f(-1) But as f(x) is an odd function, we know that f(-1) = -f(1).

This problem tests the understanding of arithmetic sequences, specifically the sum of the first n terms, and is a basic computation problem."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],N={key:0},I={key:1};function W(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
