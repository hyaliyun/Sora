Also, f(1) = frac{1}{e}.     Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to the function f(x) at the point (1, f(1)) is y = frac{1}{e}x. 2. **Proof:**     Given that F(x) = f(x) - x + frac{1}{x} and f(x) = frac{x^2}{e^x},     we have F(1) = frac{1}{e} > 0 and F(2) = frac{4}{e^2} - frac{3}{2} < 0.

First, we observe that fleft(xright) is an even function. This is because: [ fleft(-xright)=lg left(|-x|+1right)+2^{-x}+2^{x}=lg left(|x|+1right)+2^{x}+2^{-x}=fleft(xright) ] This property indicates that the function behaves the same way for positive and negative values of x. Next, we focus on the case when xgeqslant 0. In this case, the function simplifies to fleft(xright)=lg left(x+1right)+2^{x}+2^{-x}. Let's define gleft(xright)=2^{x}+2^{-x} for xgeqslant 0.  To show that gleft(xright) is monotonically increasing on left[0,+infty right), consider any x_{1}, x_{2}in left[0,+infty right) with x_{1} lt x_{2}. We have: [ g({x}_{1})-g({x}_{2})={2}^{{x}_{1}}+{2}^{-{x}_{1}}-{2}^{{x}_{2}}-{2}^{-{x}_{2}}=({2}^{{x}_{1}}-{2}^{{x}_{2}})left(1-frac{1}{{2}^{{x}_{1}}⋅{2}^{{x}_{2}}}right) ] Given 0leqslant x_{1} lt x_{2}, it follows that 1＜{2}^{{x}_{1}}＜{2}^{{x}_{2}}, which implies {2}^{{x}_{1}}-{2}^{{x}_{2}}＜0 and 1-frac{1}{{2}^{{x}_{1}}⋅{2}^{{x}_{2}}}＞0. Therefore, g(x_{1}) lt g(x_{2}), proving that gleft(xright) is monotonically increasing on left[0,+infty right). Similarly, the function y=lg left(x+1right) is also monotonically increasing on left[0,+infty right). Consequently, fleft(xright) is monotonically increasing on left[0,+infty right). To find the range of values for x that make the inequality fleft(x+1right) lt fleft(2xright) hold, we use the fact that fleft(xright) is even and monotonically increasing on left[0,+infty right): [ fleft(x+1right) lt fleft(2xright)Leftrightarrow fleft(|x+1|right) lt fleft(|2x|right)Leftrightarrow |x+1| lt |2x| ] Solving the inequality |x+1| lt |2x| gives us two cases: 1.

(where [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x) We need to find the smallest factorial, say m!, such that: [m/5] + [m/25] + [m/125] + [m/625] >= 4 (since we want 5^4 to be a factor) [m/5] + [m/25] + [m/125] + [m/625] < 5 (since we do not want 5^5 to be a factor) Let's calculate the number of times 5 divides m! for different values of m: For m = 20: [20/5] + [20/25] + [20/125] + [20/625] = 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4 For m = 21, 22, 23, and 24, the calculation will be the same since we are not adding any additional multiples of 5. For m = 25: [25/5] + [25/25] + [25/125] + [25/625] = 5 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6 At m = 25, we have already exceeded the limit for 5^4, as 5^5 (3125) would be a factor of 25!. Therefore, the smallest factorial where 5^4 is a factor but 5^5 is not is boxed{24!} ."},{"instruction":"1) None of the numbers a, b, c is zero. 2) At least one of the numbers a, b, c is zero. 3) Either the numbers a and b have opposite signs, or at least one of them is zero.","output":"We are given three statements in Russian which we need to express using mathematical symbols.

This means that the function f(x) is strictly decreasing on mathbb{R}. Taking m = n = 0, we have f(0) = f(0) cdot f(0). Therefore, f(0) = 1. Since the inequality f(x^2) cdot f(2x - 3) > 1 is given, we can infer f(x^2 + 2x - 3) > f(0). Because f(x) is strictly decreasing, we deduce that x^2 + 2x - 3 < 0. Solving the quadratic inequality yields -3 < x < 1. Hence, the solution set for the original inequality is (-3, 1). Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{text{B}}.

Consider the set ( {1, 2, dots, 2003} ). We need to construct a skipping set ( S ) such that for any ( s_1, s_2 in S ), ( |s_1 - s_2| notin {a, b} ).    Let's construct ( S ) by including elements in a specific pattern. Divide the set ( {1, 2, dots, 2003} ) into blocks of size ( 3b ). In each block of size ( 3b ), we include elements in the following manner:    - In the first ( b ) integers, include the union of the sets ( {1, 2, dots, a} ), ( {2a+1, 2a+2, dots, 3a} ), and so on, up to the largest even multiple of ( a ) that is less than ( b ).    - In the second group of ( b ) integers, include all elements that were not included in the first ( b ) integers modulo ( b ).    - Do not include any elements from the third group of ( b ) integers.    This ensures that ( S ) contains approximately one-third of the elements in each block of size ( 3b ). Repeating this pattern for all blocks up to 2003, we get more than one-third of the elements in ( S ).

By the pigeonhole principle, we can have at most ( leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2} rightrfloor ) elements from each set in ( S ). This means that for ( z in mathbb{N} ), there can be at most ( frac{z+1}{2z+1} cdot 2003 ) elements in ( S ). This is maximal for the smallest ( z ), and thus there should be at most:    [    leftlfloor frac{2 times 2003}{3} rightrfloor = 1335    ]    elements in ( S ). However, for any ( a < b ), there will be two elements with difference ( a ), so at least one element must be removed. Therefore, ( f(a, b) leq 1334 ).

If we transfer a part of the solution from Vessel 2 to Vessel 1, Vessel 1 will have a diluted salt concentration.    - However, key observation: As long as Vessel 2 has any higher concentration of salt compared to Vessel 1, transferring part of Vessel 2's solution into Vessel 1 will not achieve a uniform concentration exactly equal to 1.5%. 4. **Theoretical Limitations**:    - Mixing cannot create a scenario where the new solution will have a precise target concentration unless the volumes and concentrations are initially set to achieve that target through dilution/mixing ratios.    - In practical terms, through simple mixing and transferring, achieving precisely 1.5% from 0% and 2% isn't feasible because our step adjustments won't precisely control the concentration. 5. **Conclusion**:    - Given the constraints described (initial concentrations and allowable operations), it's impossible to achieve an exact 1.5% concentration in the vessel that initially contained pure water by the method of transferring and mixing. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{It is not possible to get a 1.5% salt solution in the vessel that initially contained water.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let {a_{n}} be a sequence with the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_{n}.

According to the information given: - 60 percent of the population are employed, so 60 people are employed. - 48 percent of the population are employed males, so 48 males are employed. Since these 48 employed males are part of the 60 employed people, we can find the number of employed females by subtracting the number of employed males from the total number of employed people: Number of employed females = Total number of employed people - Number of employed males Number of employed females = 60 - 48 Number of employed females = 12 Now, to find the percent of the employed people who are females, we use the number of employed females and the total number of employed people: Percent of employed females = (Number of employed females / Total number of employed people) * 100 Percent of employed females = (12 / 60) * 100 Percent of employed females = 0.2 * 100 Percent of employed females = 20% Therefore, boxed{20}  percent of the employed people in town X are females."},{"instruction":"There are 8 different books and some different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.

Let's find a function g(x) such that: g(x) = f(x+1) - 1 We need to check the symmetry of g(x) around the origin. For a function to be odd, it must satisfy the condition g(-x) = -g(x). Let's see if g(x) meets this condition: Substituting x with -x in g(x) gives us: g(-x) = f(-x+1) - 1 Recalling that f(x+1)+f(-x+1)=2, we can express f(-x+1) as: f(-x+1) = 2 - f(x+1) Substitute this into the expression for g(-x): g(-x) = (2 - f(x+1)) - 1 g(-x) = 1 - f(x+1) g(-x) = - (f(x+1) - 1) g(-x) = -g(x) Therefore, g(x), or f(x+1)-1, is an odd function with respect to the origin.

For a quadratic equation to have real roots, the expression on the right side of the equation must be greater than or equal to zero because the square of a real number (the left side of the equation) is always non-negative. 2. **Set up the inequality**: Based on the requirement for real roots, we set up the inequality m-1 geqslant 0. 3. **Solve the inequality**: Solving the inequality for m gives us m geqslant 1. Therefore, for the equation left(x+5right)^{2}=m-1 to have two real roots, the value of m must satisfy m geqslant 1. Hence, the correct answer is boxed{B: m geqslant 1}. **Analysis**: This problem tests the understanding of the conditions under which a quadratic equation has real roots.

This is a direct application of the principle that the square of any real number is non-negative. **Comments**: The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the discriminant of a quadratic equation (or the value under the square root in this case) and the nature of its roots. Since we are dealing with a squared term equal to m-1, ensuring that m-1 is non-negative guarantees that the original equation has real roots.

In this case, the divisors are ( 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4, p^5 ).    - ( n = p^2 q ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct prime numbers. Here, the divisors are ( 1, p, p^2, q, pq, p^2 q ). 2. **Case 1: ( n = p^5 )**:    The sum of the divisors of ( p^5 ) is given by:    [    sigma(p^5) = 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 + p^4 + p^5    ]    We need to solve for the equation:    [    1 + p + p^2 + p^3 + p^4 + p^5 = 3500    ]    Rearranging, we get:    [    p^5 + p^4 + p^3 + p^2 + p + 1 = 3500    ]    This equation does not have a feasible solution because:    [    p(p + p^2 + p^3 + p^4) = 3499    ]    The number 3499 is not divisible by small primes like ( 2, 3, 5, 7 ), indicating ( p > 10 ). It is then checked that for such large ( p ), ( p + p^2 + p^3 + p^4 ) grows very fast making it impossible to satisfy the equation. 3. **Case 2: ( n = p^2 q )**:    The sum of divisors is given by:    [    sigma(p^2 q) = (1 + p + p^2)(1 + q)    ]    We need this to equal 3500:    [    (1 + p + p^2)(1 + q) = 3500    ] 4. **Finding factors**:    Notice that ( 3500 = 2^2 cdot 5^3 cdot 7 ).

Now, let's calculate the number of times Rebecca jumped. Since her jumping formed an arithmetic sequence with an initial jump count of 47 and a common difference of 5, and she jumped for a total of 7 sequences, we can find the total number of jumps by finding the sum of the arithmetic sequence. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference. Since Rebecca jumped for a total of 7 sequences, we need to find the 7th term of the sequence to know how many times she jumped on the last sequence. a_7 = 47 + (7 - 1) * 5 a_7 = 47 + 6 * 5 a_7 = 47 + 30 a_7 = 77 jumps on the last sequence. Now, to find the total number of jumps Rebecca made, we sum up the arithmetic sequence from the first term to the seventh term. The sum S_n of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n) So, the total number of jumps Rebecca made is: S_7 = 7/2 * (47 + 77) S_7 = 3.5 * 124 S_7 = 434 jumps. Finally, we add up the jumps from all three siblings to get the total number of jumps: Ronald's jumps + Rupert's jumps + Rebecca's jumps = 157 + 494 + 434 = 1085 jumps.

C invested thrice the amount of A after 8 months, so C's investment is 3x. C's investment was made for only 4 months of the year. The profit share is proportional to the product of the investment and the time period for which the money was invested. A's investment was for the entire year (12 months), so A's share is proportional to x * 12. B's investment was for 6 months, so B's share is proportional to 2x * 6.

Excluding the case where y = x, the count of valid y values is leftlfloor frac{13}{x} rightrfloor - 1. 3. **Sum the counts for each x**:    [    sum_{x=1}^{13} (leftlfloor frac{13}{x} rightrfloor - 1) = sum_{x=1}^{13} (text{number of multiples of } x text{ up to } 13 text{ excluding } x)    ]    - For x=1: 12 (excluding 1 itself)    - For x=2: 5     - For x=3: 3    - For x=4: 2    - For x=5, 6,ldots, 13: 1 for each x up to 6 (becomes 0 for x > 6)    Therefore, the sum is 12 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 24. 4. **Total number of ways to pick two distinct numbers**:    From a set of 13 numbers, two distinct numbers can be chosen in binom{13}{2} = frac{13 times 12}{2} = 78 ways. 5. **Calculate the probability**:    frac{24}{78} = frac{2{13}}.

If the measure of angle ABC is 90 degrees, what is the measure of angle BAC?","output":"Let m be the measure of angle BAC (which we want to find).  Since AX = XY = YB = frac{1}{2}BC, we determine that AX = XY = YB = frac{1}{3}AB. Considering AB = 2BC, we can confirm that AB = 4YB.  The triangle ABC has angle ABC = 90^circ, and since AX = XY = YB, triangle AXY is an isosceles triangle, making angle AYX = angle YAX = m^circ. The sum of angles in triangle AXY is 180^circ, thus angle AXY = (180 - 2m)^circ. With angle AXY as (180 - 2m)^circ and considering angle AXY and angle BXY as supplementary (due to straight line AXY), we have angle BXY = 2m^circ. Since XY = YB, angles angle XBY and angle BXY are equal, so angle XBY = 2m^circ. Therefore, in triangle XYB, angle XYB = (180 - 4m)^circ. Summing angle AYX, angle XYB, and angle BYC would again yield 180^circ as it forms the straight angle AYB. Hence, angle BYC = (180 - (m + (180 - 4m)))^circ = 3m^circ. Given YB = BC, angle YCB = angle BYC = 3m^circ and angle YBC = (180 - 6m)^circ.  Finally, since angle ABC = angle XBY + angle YBC = 90^circ, thus 2m + (180 - 6m) = 90.

Consider a polygon with vertices ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). It satisfies the problem condition and intersects each of the lines ( l_1, l_2, ) and ( l_3 ).  5. The perimeter of this polygon, ( P_1 ), is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of segments ( AC, CB, AD, ) and ( DB ). Thus, ( P_1 leq 4sqrt{2} < 4 times 1.42 = 5.68 ). 6. If we add more vertices on the circle, we can make the perimeter ( P_2 ) close to ( 2pi ), i.e., ( P_2 > 2 times 3.14 = 6.28 ). 7. Because Kolya cannot distinguish these two polygons, he will not be able to reliably guess the perimeter with an accuracy of 0.3.    Concluding, Kolya cannot determine the perimeter with accuracy up to 0.3 after three steps:    [    boxed{text{нет}}    ]  Part (b) 1. Place a coordinate system ( Oxy ) with the origin at the center ( O ) of the given circle. Let ( q ) be a natural number. For each ( k = 0, 1, ldots, q-1 ), define ( O x_k ) to be the axis rotated counterclockwise by an angle ( phi_k := frac{pi k}{q} ) around ( O ). 2. For any natural number ( p ), for each fixed ( k = 0, 1, ldots, q-1 ), we can find an approximate value ( d_k ) of the length ( d_k ) of the orthogonal projection ( [a_k, b_k] (a_k leq 0 leq b_k) ) of the specified polygon on the axis ( O x_k ) with an accuracy of ( frac{1}{2^p} ). 3. Sequentially specify lines ( l_{k, m} (m = 1, 2, ldots, p) ), perpendicular to the axis ( O x_k ) and intersecting it at points with coordinates ( frac{r_m}{2^m} ). 4. Then the magnitude ( frac{r_{p+1}}{2^{p+1}} ) will equal ( b_k ) with accuracy to ( frac{1}{2^{p+1}} ). Similarly, determine ( a_k ) with the same accuracy. 5. The quantity ( 2 sin left(frac{pi}{2 q}right) sum_{k = 0}^{q-1} d_k ) with an appropriate choice of ( p ) and ( q ) approximates the perimeter ( P ) of the specified polygon. 6. Let ( N ) be the number of its sides. Denote their lengths by ( Delta_j (j = 1, 2, ldots, N) ) and the lengths of their orthogonal projections on the axis ( O x_k ) by ( D_{j, k} ). 7. Since each point of the interval ( [a_k, b_k] ) is the orthogonal projection of exactly two points of the polygon's boundary, we have    [    P approx 2 sum_{k = 0}^{q-1} d_k sin frac{pi}{2 q}    ] 8. Setting ( p = 11 ) and ( q = 90 ), we obtain the desired accuracy:    [    left| P - 2 sin frac{pi}{2 q} sum_{k = 0}^{q-1} hat{d}_k right| < frac{pi^3}{32000} + frac{pi}{2000} < 0.003    ]    Here, ( pi < sqrt{10} < 3.2 ).

Therefore:     [     |Aiy| = |A| |y| leq frac{|A| rho}{2}     ] 13. Combining these results, we get:     [     |Ax + Aiy + B| leq |Ax + B| + |Aiy| leq M + frac{|A| rho}{2}     ] 14. Since ( |A| leq M ) on the segment ( -1 leq x leq 1 ), we have:     [     |Ax + Aiy + B| leq M + frac{M rho}{2} = M left(1 + frac{rho}{2}right)     ] 15.

Then he marks those nodes (intersections of the graph paper lines) that are adjacent to an equal number of painted and unpainted squares. What is the maximum number of nodes that can be marked?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:    We are dealing with a 6 times 6 grid on graph paper. Each grid cell can either be colored or uncolored. We need to determine the maximum number of vertices (intersections of grid lines) that can be marked, given that each marked vertex is adjacent to an equal number of colored and uncolored cells. 2. **Initial Analysis**:    Each vertex in the grid could be adjacent to a varying number of cells depending on its position:    - Corner vertices: adjacent to 1 cell.    - Edge vertices (but not corners): adjacent to 2 cells.    - Internal vertices: adjacent to 4 cells. 3. **Qualifying Criteria for a Marked Vertex**:    For a vertex to be marked, it needs to be adjacent to an equal number of colored and uncolored cells. This inherently means that vertices that are adjacent to an odd number of total cells cannot be marked because an odd number cannot be evenly split. 4. **Considering Specific Positions**:    Under this constraint, we look at possible positions:    - **Corner vertices** cannot be marked since their only adjacent cell would either be colored or uncolored.    - **Edge vertices (8 in total for a 6 times 6 grid excluding corners)** cannot be marked correctly because they are adjacent to 2 cells, again an even split is not possible unless both vertices are mixed, which does not meet requirements.    - **Internal vertices** (the bulk of vertices) are thus our candidates because they can be adjacent to four cells which allows for an even split of 2 colored and 2 uncolored cells. 5. **Calculation**:    The total grid has 7 times 7 = 49 vertices (because we have intersections on the boundaries too).    - Subtracting the 4 corner vertices that cannot be marked:      [      49 - 4 = 45      ] 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, examining each position and applying the given condition, we find that the maximum number of vertices that Lesha can mark is:    [    boxed{45}    ]"},{"instruction":"What is the largest divisor of 462 that is also a factor of 330?","output":"1.

The derivative of f(x) is: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^{x} - asin x) = e^{x} - acos x. At x = 0, we find the value of f(0) and f'(0) as follows: f(0) = e^{0} - asin(0) = 1 - a cdot 0 = 1, f'(0) = e^{0} - acos(0) = 1 - a. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at (0, f(0)) = (0, 1) is 1 - a, and the point it passes through is (0, 1). The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Substituting the slope and the point into this equation gives: y = (1-a)x + 1.

For y = f(x) and y = g(x) to have a common point, the equation e^{x} = bsqrt{x} must have a solution. Clearly, x neq 0 for the equation to hold. We consider the function h(x) = frac{e^{x}}{sqrt{x}} for x > 0 and find its derivative: h'(x) = frac{e^{x}(2x-1)}{2xsqrt{x}}. Analyzing the sign of h'(x): - For x in (0, frac{1}{2}), h'(x) < 0, indicating h(x) is decreasing. - For x in (frac{1}{2}, +infty), h'(x) > 0, indicating h(x) is increasing. Thus, h(x) has a minimum at x = frac{1}{2}, giving h_{min} = h(frac{1}{2}) = sqrt{2e}. As x rightarrow 0 and x rightarrow +infty, h(x) rightarrow +infty. Therefore, the range of b is boxed{[sqrt{2e}, +infty)}.  Part (2)(ii): Proving a^{2} + b^{2} > e Let the abscissa of the intersection point be x_{0}.

The maximum overlaps can happen when:    - |A cap B| = min(|A|, |B|) = 25 (since set B with 25 elements can be entirely within set A with 30 elements)    - |A cap C| = min(|A|, |C|) = 10 (since set C with 10 elements can be entirely within set A)    - |B cap C| = min(|B|, |C|) = 10 (since set C with 10 elements can be entirely within set B)    - |A cap B cap C| = |C| = 10 (choosing set C, the smallest, implies it can be within the intersection of any larger sets)    Plugging in these values:    [    |A cup B cup C| = 30 + 25 + 10 - 25 - 10 - 10 + 10 = 30    ]    **Conclusion with Boxed Answer**:    [    30    ] The final answer is boxed{B. 30}"},{"instruction":"There are three tasks in an EGMO exam, where an integer score between 0 and 7 can be achieved in each task. Show that there are always two students out of 49, so that one was at least as good as the other in each of the three tasks.","output":"1. **Assume Problem Requirements:**     - Let there be 49 students.     - Each student can score an integer between (0) and (7) on each of three tasks. 2. **Score Representation:**     - The scores of a student are represented as ((a_i, b_i, c_i)), where (a_i), (b_i), and (c_i) are the scores of student (i) in the first, second, and third task respectively. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle:**     - There are (8 times 8 times 8 = 512) possible score combinations (triples ((a, b, c))).     - If we have 49 students, by the pigeonhole principle, for any chosen subset of students, there will be at least one score combination that will be repeated more than once. 4. **Group Formation Based on Scores in First Task:**     - Divide the 49 students into groups based on their score in the first task:       [       { text{group with }0 text{ points in the first task}, text{group with }1 text{ points in the first task}, ldots, text{group with } 7 text{ points in the first task} }       ]     - Let (a_i) be the number of students in the group where they scored (i) points in the first task. 5. **Distribution Observations:**     - A student in a higher score group in the first task will always dominate a student in a lower score group for the first task.     - Within each group based on first task score, distribute scores of the second and third tasks. 6. **Induction Hypothesis:**     - Begin arranging students optimally starting from the group with 0 points in the first task. Increase values systematically to ensure every combination is achieved optimally.     - Continue this optimal arrangement for higher groups progressively. 7. **Max Group Size Calculation:**     - Continue increasing scores within each group with respect to the second and third tasks until each combination is achieved optimally.     - This approach ensures optimal distribution without contradictions, by either incrementing scores to include combinations or reassigning those scores, ensuring maximum capacity within constraints. 8. **Final Group Sizes:**     - Calculate maximum number of students without exceeding the constraint via:       [       1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64       ]       However, each group can hold only up to 8 students.     - Hence, reevaluating as per constraints:       [       1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8 Rightarrow text{Total} = 48 text{ students}       ] # Conclusion: By our systematic process ensuring maximum distribution within score constraints, it proves that for 49 students, there will always be at least two students such that one was at least as good as the other in each of the three tasks.

We know that the number of Easter presents is 10 fewer than half the number of Christmas presents. Since he found 60 Christmas presents, half of that would be 60 / 2 = 30 presents. Therefore, the number of Easter presents is 30 - 10 = 20 presents. Next, we know that the number of birthday presents is 3 times as many as his Easter presents. So, the number of birthday presents is 3 * 20 = 60 presents. Now, let's find out how many Halloween presents he received. The number of Halloween presents is equal to the difference between the number of birthday and Easter presents. So, the number of Halloween presents is 60 (birthday presents) - 20 (Easter presents) = 40 presents.

Therefore, the numbers ( 2^{alpha_k - 1}k ) are exactly the numbers in the set ( T = {n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n} ), since there are ( n ) such numbers. 5. **Sum of Greatest Odd Divisors:**    The largest odd divisors of the numbers in ( T ) are precisely the numbers in ( S ).

We need to prove that angle ATC is not a right angle. 2. **Use Jacobi's theorem:**    By Jacobi's theorem, if AA', BB', and CC' are concurrent, then the points A', B', and C' are the isogonal conjugates of A, B, and C respectively. This implies that AA', BB', and CC' concur at a point, say T. 3. **Complex number setup:**    Let |omega| = 1, y = -frac{1}{omega - 1}, and z = frac{omega}{omega - 1}.

Given that the center lies on the line x-y=0, we can express this condition as -frac{D}{2}=frac{E}{2}, because the center of a circle given by the equation x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 is (-frac{D}{2}, -frac{E}{2}). Substituting the coordinates of points B(0,-2) and C(4,0) into the equation of circle M, we get two equations: 1. Substituting B(0,-2) gives 0 + 4 + 0 - 2E + F = 0 Rightarrow 4 - 2E + F = 0. 2. Substituting C(4,0) gives 16 + 0 + 4D + 0 + F = 0 Rightarrow 16 + 4D + F = 0.

We define a quasi-increasing permutation as one where a_k leq a_{k+1} + 2 for each 1 leq k leq n-1.  Step 1: Understanding the Base Case For n = 3, we consider all permutations of {1, 2, 3}: - 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321 All these permutations satisfy the condition a_k leq a_{k+1} + 2.

The integer n can be placed: - Before n-1 (if n-1 is not the first element), - Before n-2 (if n-2 is not the first two elements), - At the end of the permutation. This gives us up to 3 valid positions for n in any quasi-increasing permutation of n-1 integers.  Step 3: Applying the Recursive Relation Starting from n = 3 with 6 permutations, we calculate the number of permutations for larger n by multiplying the number of permutations for n-1 by 3 (since each permutation of n-1 integers gives rise to 3 permutations of n integers): - For n = 4: 3 times 6 = 18 - For n = 5: 3 times 18 = 54 - For n = 6: 3 times 54 = 162 - For n = 7: 3 times 162 = 486  Conclusion Thus, the number of quasi-increasing permutations of the integers 1, 2, ldots, 7 is boxed{486}."},{"instruction":"Given two distinct points M and N on the parabola y = 4x^2, and the focus F of the parabola, such that angle MFN = 135^circ, the midpoint of chord MN is P.

For each subsequent number n (where n geq 3), we have to place it in one of the subsets that does not contain n-1.

Therefore, the combined sum of the perimeters of all pieces is:    [    225 times 10    ] 7. **Subtract the perimeter of the outer boundary:**    The perimeter of the (30 times 30) square is 120 (Each side being 30):    [    4 times 30 = 120    ] 8. **Compute the final maximum total length of cuts:**    Since each cut is counted twice in the perimeters of the pieces (except the outer boundary), we need to adjust the total sum:    [    frac{225 times 10 - 120}{2} = frac{2250 - 120}{2} = frac{2130}{2} = 1065    ] # Conclusion: The maximum possible total length of the cuts is: [ boxed{1065} ]"},{"instruction":"a distant solar system, there is an odd number of planets, and the distance between any two planets is different at any given moment.

Therefore, each planet is monitored by exactly one astronomer, as no astronomer can study their own planet according to the problem statement. 2. **Unique Distances**:    Since there is a finite number of planets and the distances between any two planets are distinct, there exists exactly one shortest distance between a pair of planets. Let these two planets be (A) and (B), and denote their distance as (d_{AB}). 3. **Observation of Closest Planets**:    The astronomers residing on planets (A) and (B) will necessarily study each other's planets. This is because the distance (d_{AB}) is the smallest, making (A) the closest planet to (B) and vice versa. Thus, the astronomer on planet (A) studies planet (B) and the astronomer on planet (B) studies planet (A). 4. **Reducing the Problem**:    Now, consider the remaining planets after removing (A) and (B). The new system still satisfies the conditions of the problem: all interplanetary distances remain distinct, and each remaining planet must still be studied by one astronomer. 5. **Recursive Application**:    Repeat the process: find the smallest interplanetary distance among the remaining planets, identify the corresponding pair of planets, and note that the astronomers on these planets must be studying each other's planets. Remove this pair and continue. 6. **Problem with Odd Number of Planets**:    Given that the total number of planets is odd, this process of pairing and removing can continue until there is exactly one planet left unpaired. 7. **Contradiction**:    The last remaining planet cannot be studied by any astronomer, as all other astronomers in previous steps were paired off and studying the planet they were paired with. Furthermore, the astronomer on this last planet cannot study their own planet according to the problem's constraints. 8. **Conclusion**:    This contradicts our initial assumption that each planet is studied by at least one astronomer. Therefore, there must be at least one planet that is not being studied by any astronomer.

Following such a strategy:    [    10:9:(8:7:(6:(5:4:(3:2:1))))    ] 4. **Simplifying Step by Step**:    Rearrange and simplify the expression from the innermost parentheses outward:    - Start with the innermost: (3:2:1)      [      3:2:1 = 3:(frac{1}{2}) = 3 cdot 2 = 6      ]    - Substitute back and continue: (5:4:6)      [      5:4:6 = 5:(frac{4}{6}) = 5 cdot frac{6}{4} = 5 cdot frac{3}{2} = frac{15}{2}      ]    - Next layer with: (6:frac{15}{2})      [      6:(frac{15}{2}) = 6 cdot frac{2}{15} = frac {12}{15} = frac{4}{5}      ]    - Continue with: (8:7:frac{4}{5})      [      8:7:(frac{4}{5}) = 8:(frac{5}{28}) = 8 cdot frac{28}{5} = 8 cdot frac{4}{1}=boxed{7}      ] Therefore, after following through the evaluations, the minimum value obtained with appropriate placements of parentheses is (7).

If the tax is diminished by 14%, the new tax rate is T - 0.14T = 0.86T. If the consumption increased by 15%, the new consumption is C + 0.15C = 1.15C. The new revenue generated from the tax is then (0.86T) * (1.15C). To find the effect on revenue, we compare the new revenue to the original revenue: New Revenue / Original Revenue = (0.86T * 1.15C) / (T * C) Simplifying, we get: New Revenue / Original Revenue = 0.86 * 1.15 = 0.989 This means the new revenue is 98.9% of the original revenue.

Next, we determine the number of favorable outcomes, which we denote as m, corresponding to the event of choosing exactly one defective item.

The probability of both forecast stations being inaccurate is the probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously. The result can be obtained using the formula for the probability of these two types of events.   This problem tests the ability to apply probability knowledge to solve practical problems. Independent events refer to events whose probabilities of occurrence do not affect each other, while complementary events refer to events that cannot occur simultaneously in the same experiment. When calculating the probability of events described as \\"at least,\\" it is often easier to first calculate the probability of their complementary events. Let's calculate the probabilities based on the given information: (1) Since the events are independent, the probability that both meteorological stations A and B accurately forecast the weather is the product of their individual probabilities: [P(A text{ and } B) = P(A) times P(B) = 0.8 times 0.95 = 0.76.] Therefore, the probability that both meteorological stations accurately forecast the weather is boxed{0.76}. (2) The complementary event of at least one station being accurate is that both stations are inaccurate. The probability of station A being inaccurate is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, and the probability of station B being inaccurate is 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05. The probability that both are inaccurate is the product of these probabilities: [P(text{both inaccurate}) = (1 - P(A)) times (1 - P(B)) = 0.2 times 0.05 = 0.01.] Therefore, the probability of at least one station being accurate is 1 - P(text{both inaccurate}) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99.

We aim to prove using the Pigeonhole Principle that: 1. At least two Parisians have the same number of hairs. 2. At least 10 Parisians share the same number of hairs. 3. If there were 3,000,001 Parisians, at least 11 of them would have the same number of hairs. **Step-by-Step Solution**: 1. **Define the Pigeonholes and Pigeons**:    - **Pigeonholes**: The possible number of hairs a person can have, ranging from 0 to 299,999.    - **Pigeons**: The Parisians.    Therefore, we have 300,000 possible distinct counts of hairs (pigeonholes). 2. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle**:    - With 3,000,000 Parisians (pigeons) and 300,000 possible hair counts (pigeonholes), we use the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if ( n ) items are put into ( m ) containers, with ( n > m ), then at least one container must contain more than one item.        Specifically:    [    text{Number of Parisians} = 3,000,000    ]    [    text{Possible hair counts} = 300,000    ] 3. **Determine the Minimum Number of Shared Hair Counts**:    - **At Least Two Parisians with the Same Count**:      According to the Pigeonhole Principle:      [      3,000,000 > 300,000      ]      This guarantees that at least:      [      leftlceil frac{3,000,000}{300,000} rightrceil = 10      ]      people will share the same number of hairs, since each pigeonhole (hair count) must contain an average of:      [      frac{3,000,000}{300,000} = 10      ]      Thus, at least 10 people must have the same number of hairs. 4. **Increasing the Number of Parisians**:    - If there were 3,000,001 Parisians (pigeons):      [      leftlceil frac{3,000,001}{300,000} rightrceil = 11      ]      This guarantees that at least 11 people will have the same number of hairs, as the average now rounds up to 11. In conclusion, based on the calculations and the Pigeonhole Principle, we have demonstrated that: - At least 10 Parisians must have exactly the same number of hairs. - If there were 3,000,001 Parisians, at least 11 would indeed have the same number of hairs.

Since Zoe is 1 year old, Z = 1.

Initially, J = C + 2 and Z = 1. 3. **Calculate Joey’s Age**: If today is the first such instance, J = C + 2 must be a multiple of 1, which it always is.

The prime factorization of 480 is 2^5 cdot 3^1 cdot 5^1.

Let xi represent this number, where xi follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=3 and p=frac{1}{2}, denoted as xi sim B(3, frac{1}{2}). A scores more than 3 points if xi = 2 or xi = 3. We calculate these probabilities as follows: - For xi = 2, the probability is given by P(xi = 2) = C_3^2 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 times left(1 - frac{1}{2}right) = 3 times frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{8}. - For xi = 3, the probability is given by P(xi = 3) = left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 = frac{1}{8}. Therefore, the total probability that A scores more than 3 points is P = P(xi = 2) + P(xi = 3) = frac{3}{8} + frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{2}.

The total number of such sums, including the empty sum (which is zero), is given by (2^{10} = 1024). This includes the sum of each possible subset of the 10 numbers.  2. **Applying Dirichlet's Principle**:     - According to the Pigeonhole Principle (also known as Dirichlet's Principle), if we have 1024 sums (pigeons) and we consider the possible remainders when these sums are divided by 1001 (holes), we have more sums than possible remainders. Specifically, the remainders when divided by 1001 can only range from 0 through 1000, yielding 1001 possible remainders. Hence, at least two different sums will have the same remainder when divided by 1001. 3. **Identifying Equal Remainders**:     - Let these two sums be (S_1) and (S_2) such that they leave the same remainder when divided by 1001:     [     S_1 equiv S_2 pmod{1001}     ] 4. **Difference of the Sums**:     - Consider the difference between these two sums:     [     S_1 - S_2 equiv 0 pmod{1001}     ]     This implies that:     [     S_1 - S_2 = k cdot 1001     ]     for some integer (k). 5. **Algebraic Sum**:     - The difference (S_1 - S_2) represents the sum of some natural numbers, each with either a \\"+\\" or \\"-\\" sign in front of it.

Thus, the hare indeed can escape the square. boxed{text{Yes}} # Additional Note: If the speed of the wolves was (sqrt{2}) times the speed of the hare, the scenario changes:   - In such a case, wolves could catch the hare as they could maneuver optimally along the sides and considering diagonal movements within similar time constraints.    - Given faster speeds, the wolves would recalibrate their positions such that crossing any side results in immediate interception due to geometric considerations and the constancy of their placement relative to the hare's position."},{"instruction":"f ( 81^4 = 27^x ), what is the value of ( 3^{x} )?

Express overrightarrow{OP} with respect to point M: [ overrightarrow{OP} = (1-v) overrightarrow{OC} + v overrightarrow{OM} = (1-v) overrightarrow{OC} + frac{v}{1+x} overrightarrow{OA} + frac{vx}{1+x} overrightarrow{OB} ] Express overrightarrow{OP} with respect to point K: [ overrightarrow{OP} = (1-u) overrightarrow{OA} + u overrightarrow{OK} = (1-u) overrightarrow{OA} + frac{u}{1+y} overrightarrow{OB} + frac{uy}{1+y} overrightarrow{OC} ] Express overrightarrow{OP} with respect to point L: [ overrightarrow{OP} = (1-w) overrightarrow{OB} + w overrightarrow{OL} = (1-w) overrightarrow{OB} + frac{w}{1+z} overrightarrow{OC} + frac{wz}{1+z} overrightarrow{OA} ]  Step 4: Establish Proportion Conditions for Consistency Since overrightarrow{OA}, overrightarrow{OB} and overrightarrow{OC} are not coplanar, when equality holds for these expressions, it has to hold component-wise. Thus, we establish the following system from the equality of vectors. Matching coefficients of overrightarrow{OA}: [ frac{v}{1+x} = frac{zw}{1+z} ] Matching coefficients of overrightarrow{OB}: [ frac{u}{1+y} = frac{vx}{1+x} ]  Step 5: Solve the Proportion Conditions By combining the equations: [ frac{v}{1+x} = frac{zw}{1+z} ] [ frac{u}{1+y} = frac{vx}{1+x} ] We simplify: [ frac{v}{1+x} cdot frac{u}{1+y} cdot frac{w}{1+z} = frac{zw}{1+z} cdot frac{vx}{1+x} cdot frac{u}{1+y} ] Since v, u, and w cancel out, we obtain: [ left(frac{1}{1+x} cdot frac{1}{1+y} cdot frac{1}{1+z}right) = frac{x cdot y cdot z}{(1+x)(1+y)(1+z)} ] Thus: [ xyz = 1 implies frac{BK}{KC} cdot frac{CL}{LA} cdot frac{AM}{MB} = 1 ] # Conclusion [ boxed{frac{BK}{KC} cdot frac{CL}{LA} cdot frac{AM}{MB} = 1} ]"},{"instruction":"The real numbers  a_1,a_2,a_3  and  b{}  are given.

The number of ways for both to exit on different floors is: 9 times 8 = 72.

The following conditions are also provided: it is possible to inscribe a circle inside the quadrilateral ( ABCD ), and a circle can also be circumscribed around it. 2. To determine whether ( ABCD ) is a square, observe the figure considering the properties resulting from the given conditions. 3. Recall that in any cyclotomic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral where a circle can be circumscribed), the perpendicular drawn from the center of the circumscribed circle to any side also bisects that side. Similarly, because the quadrilateral has an inscribed circle, the sums of the lengths of its opposite sides must be equal. This is known as the Pitot theorem for quadrilaterals. 4. Taking points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ), make an observation about the diagonals:     [     AC perp BD     ] 5. Since ( ABCD ) is able to have both inscribed and circumscribed circles, it must be a tangential quadrilateral (has an incircle) and a cyclic quadrilateral (has a circumcircle). 6. Consider a characteristic property of tangential quadrilaterals:     [     text{AB} + text{CD} = text{BC} + text{DA}     ] 7. Additionally, for a cyclic quadrilateral, Ptolemy’s theorem holds:     [     AC cdot BD = AB cdot CD + AD cdot BC     ] 8. Given that the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) are perpendicular, they bisect each other. 9. Let's denote the intersection point of the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) as ( O ). Because ( O ) will be equidistant from all four vertices ( A,B,C, ) and ( D ), we can conclude the segments into which the diagonals divide each other. Since the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, the four triangles formed by the intersections of diagonals are right triangles. Furthermore, since ( ABCD ) has an inscribed circle and a circumscribed circle, the quadrilateral must satisfy the properties of both cyclic and tangential quadrilateral. 10. If ( ABCD ) is a square, then it fulfills all of the above properties: perpendicular bisectors for diagonals result equitably in all triangles being congruent, side length properties being equal. 11. However, let's analyze whether other quadrilaterals may have necessary conditions. Specifically, check whether a rhombus would: Any rhombus (with all four sides equal) also fulfills the conditions required. Therefore, an inscribed circle, diagonal perpendicularity, and a circumscribed circle similarly hold. # Conclusion: This means that while a square indeed is one of the possible figures, we cannot definitively claim it is the only figure; a rhombus also fits the geometrical constraints provided. Therefore, it cannot be conclusively asserted that ( ABCD ) is exclusively a square. [ boxed{text{Nikol}} ]"},{"instruction":"There are several bowls on a table, each containing some grapes.

Пусть общее количество чисел равно n. Тогда, количество четных чисел составляет 52% от n, т.е. ( 0.52n ). 4.

The inequality 2x-y+λ-1≥0 can be rearranged to y≤2x+λ-1, representing a line with slope 2 and y-intercept at λ-1. For the area to pass through all four quadrants, the line defined by 2x-y+λ-1=0 must intersect both the x-axis (at a point greater than x=1) and y-axis (at a point less than y=3).  As the line y = 2x + λ - 1 intersects the y-axis where x=0, the y-intercept is λ-1. For this to be below y=3, λ-1 must be less than 3. Therefore: λ-1 < 3 Solving this inequality gives us: λ < 4 Additionally, for the line to pass through the fourth quadrant, it must also intersect the x-axis above x=1. Setting y=0, the x-intercept is determined by solving 2x+λ-1=0: 2x = 1 - λ x = frac{1 - λ}{2} For x to be greater than 1, we require that frac{1 - λ}{2} > 1, which simplifies to: 1 - λ > 2 -λ > 1 λ < -1 However, this does not make sense in this context, as having lambda < -1 would mean the region cannot pass through all four quadrants.

According to the information given, if each office should get an equal number of bureaus, they would need at least 10 more bureaus. This means that B is not divisible by the number of offices (14) without a remainder.  If they had B + 10 bureaus, then it would be divisible by 14, meaning each office could get an equal number of bureaus.  So, we can write the equation: B + 10 = 14x Since B is not divisible by 14, B must be of the form 14k + r, where k is the quotient when B is divided by 14, and r is the remainder (0 < r < 14). Now, B + 10 must be divisible by 14, so we can write: B + 10 = 14k + r + 10 For B + 10 to be divisible by 14, r + 10 must be equal to 14 or a multiple of 14. Since 0 < r < 14, the smallest value for r that satisfies this condition is r = 4, because 4 + 10 = 14. Therefore, B is of the form 14k + 4. Now, we need to find the smallest value of k for which B is a positive integer. Since we don't have any other information about the total number of bureaus, we can't determine the exact value of B, but we know that B is 4 more than a multiple of 14. The smallest multiple of 14 is 14 itself, so the smallest value of B would be: B = 14 + 4 = 18 However, since we are looking for the initial number of bureaus before they needed 10 more, we need to subtract 10 from this number: B_initial = B - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8 Therefore, the company initially bought boxed{8}  bureaus."},{"instruction":"The minimum value of the function fleft(xright)=cos 2x+|sin x|left(xin Rright) is ____.","output":"To find the minimum value of the function f(x) = cos 2x + |sin x|, we first rewrite the function in terms of sin x: [ begin{align*} f(x) &= cos 2x + |sin x|  &= 1 - 2sin^2 x + |sin x|  &= -2|sin x|^2 + |sin x| + 1, end{align*} ] where we have used the identity cos 2x = 1 - 2sin^2 x and expressed sin^2 x as |sin x|^2 since |sin x|^2 = sin^2 x.

A glide reflection is an isometry that consists of a reflection over a line followed by a translation along that line.     3. **Properties of glide reflection:**     - A glide reflection translates every point along line ( l ).     - It does not map any line parallel to ( l ) onto itself.     - It either leaves no points fixed or leaves all points on line ( l ) fixed. 4. **From Problem 17.36 (reference):** The considered movement could also be seen as either a rotation or a translation (since these are the only types of isometries of the plane not involving reflections). 5. **Properties of these other isometries:**     - **Rotation:** A rotation around a point leaves exactly one point fixed (the center of rotation).     - **Translation:** A translation moves all points of the plane along a certain direction, mapping every line in a parallel family onto itself. 6. **Contradiction:** We now analyze the nature of composition:     - **Even composition:** Composes multiple pairs of reflections.

Given that the sum is 64, we set 2^{n}=64. Solving for n, we find n=6. Hence, the binomial expansion is {(x-frac{2}{{x}^{2}})}^{6}. 2. **Calculating the sum of binomial coefficients for even terms:**    The sum of binomial coefficients of all even terms in a binomial expansion is half of the total sum. Since the total sum is 64, the sum of even terms is frac{64}{2} = 32.

Consider the expression:    [    frac{1+icotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right)}{1-icotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right)}    ]    Using the identity (cot(x) = frac{cos(x)}{sin(x)}), we can rewrite (cotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right)) as:    [    cotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right) = frac{cosleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right)}{sinleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right)}    ] 3. Let ( z = cotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right) ). Then the expression becomes:    [    frac{1+iz}{1-iz}    ]    This is a well-known form and can be simplified using the properties of complex numbers. Specifically, it can be shown that:    [    frac{1+iz}{1-iz} = e^{2i arg(z)}    ]    where (arg(z)) is the argument of the complex number (z). 4. For ( z = cotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right) ), the argument (arg(z)) is:    [    argleft(cotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right)right) = frac{pi}{2} - frac{npi}{2n+1}    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{1+icotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right)}{1-icotleft(frac{npi}{2n+1}right)} = e^{2ileft(frac{pi}{2} - frac{npi}{2n+1}right)} = e^{frac{ipi}{2n+1}}    ] 5.

The sum becomes:    [    sum_{n=1}^infty left(frac{1}{n} - frac{2}{2n+1}right)    ]    This can be split into two separate sums:    [    sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{n} - 2 sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{2n+1}    ] 8. The first sum is the harmonic series, which diverges, but we are interested in the difference:    [    sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{n} - 2 sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{2n+1}    ]    The second sum can be related to the harmonic series:    [    sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{2n+1} = frac{1}{2} sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{2} sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{2n}    ]    This simplifies to:    [    sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{2n+1} = frac{1}{2} ln 2    ] 9. Therefore, the sum is:    [    sum_{n=1}^infty frac{1}{n(2n+1)} = 2 - ln 2    ] 10. Substituting back, we get:     [     e^{ipi (2 - ln 2)} = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{ipi}     ] 11.

A quadrilateral ABCD=N. 2. Adjacent angles angle BAD = alpha and angle CBA = beta. 3. Diagonals AC = e and BD = f. 4. The angle angle AMB = varepsilon at the intersection point M of the diagonals. Our objective is to construct the quadrilateral (ABCD = N) satisfying these conditions.   Step-by-step Construction: 1. **Translate Triangle**:    - Translate triangle ABC by sliding point A to point C, making the new position of B point (E) and the new position of D point (F).     - This forms two parallelograms: BEFD = P and BECA. 2. **Properties of Parallelograms**:    - Since P is a parallelogram, its sides are overline{BE} = overline{AC} = e and overline{BD} = f.    - The angle at B within parallelogram P, angle DBE = varepsilon.    - Because overline{BC} is a diagonal, the angles angle EBC = angle ABC = beta (corresponding angles) and angle ECF = angle BAD = alpha (same side interior angles). 3. **Triangle Construction**:    - Construct triangle DEF where DE = EF = e, DF = f, and angle D E B = varepsilon.    - Construct the viewing circles with EF forming alpha and BE forming beta. The intersection of these circles (other than E) gives us the position of C. 4. **Considering Angles**:    - If angles alpha or beta are greater than 180^circ, the arcs corresponding to these angles should be adjusted as 360^circ - alpha < 180^circ or 360^circ - beta < 180^circ. 5. **Final Position**:    - Translate triangle CEF such that point E moves to B, and point C reaches a new position A. This forms the quadrilateral ABCD.    - Verify the constraints:      - The distances match: overline{AC} and overline{BD}.      - The constructed angles also match alpha and beta. 6. **Convexity and Additional Conditions**:    - The quadrilateral can be convex, concave, or self-intersecting (looped) depending on the position of C relative to P.    - Self-intersecting quadrilaterals are not acceptable as they do not define inner and outer sides conventionally. 7. **Inequalities to Satisfy**:    - Ensure that ACB and DBE triangles can indeed be formed by satisfying the following:      - (180^circ - alpha) + (180^circ - beta) > 180^circ - varepsilon      - Simplifying, varepsilon > alpha + beta - 180^circ 8. **Further Remarks and Techniques**:    - The quadrilateral’s diagonals bisect and its midpoint forms another parallelogram, which can be useful in some solutions.    - Additional coordinates, intersections, translations, and reflections help in establishing the final correct points of A, B, C, and D.   In summary, follow the correct steps and verify every angle and distance condition to properly construct quadrilateral ABCD.

No three of them form an arithmetic progression. 2. Exactly 4 of the sums (a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d) form an arithmetic progression. Let's consider the quadruplet ((1, 2, 4, 5)). 1. **Checking for no three numbers forming an arithmetic progression:**    - The possible triplets are ((1, 2, 4)), ((1, 2, 5)), ((1, 4, 5)), and ((2, 4, 5)).    - None of these triplets form an arithmetic progression:      - For ((1, 2, 4)): (2 - 1 neq 4 - 2)      - For ((1, 2, 5)): (2 - 1 neq 5 - 2)      - For ((1, 4, 5)): (4 - 1 neq 5 - 4)      - For ((2, 4, 5)): (4 - 2 neq 5 - 4) 2. **Checking for sums forming an arithmetic progression:**    - The sums are (1+2=3), (1+4=5), (1+5=6), (2+4=6), (2+5=7), (4+5=9).    - We need to find 4 of these sums that form an arithmetic progression.    - Consider the sums (3, 5, 6, 7):      - The differences are (5-3=2), (6-5=1), (7-6=1).      - This does not form an arithmetic progression.    - Consider the sums (3, 5, 7, 9):      - The differences are (5-3=2), (7-5=2), (9-7=2).      - This forms an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. Thus, the quadruplet ((1, 2, 4, 5)) is a 4-good quadruplet. # Part (b) We need to determine the maximal (k) such that there exists a (k)-good quadruplet. 1. **Assume (k geq 5):**    - If (k geq 5), then at least 5 of the sums (a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d) must form an arithmetic progression.    - Consider the sums in increasing order: (a+b < a+c < a+d < b+c < b+d < c+d).    - If 5 of these sums form an arithmetic progression, then the first two sums and the last two sums must be part of the arithmetic progression. 2. **Analyzing the sums:**    - Let (a+b) and (a+c) be the first two elements of the arithmetic progression.    - The third element could be (b+c) or (a+d), but this leads to contradictions:      - If (b+c) is the third element, then (a+c = 2b), which is not possible since (a, b, c, d) are distinct.      - If (a+d) is the third element, then (b+d = 2c), which is also not possible. 3. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, it is not possible to have 5 sums forming an arithmetic progression without violating the distinctness or the non-arithmetic progression condition among (a, b, c, d).    - Hence, the maximal (k) is 4.

The expected value (or mathematical expectation) of the area of Asya's rectangle is:     [     mathbb{E}[A times B] = mathbb{E}[A] times mathbb{E}[B]     ]     because the expectation of the product of independent random variables is the product of the expectations. 3. **Calculate the Expected Value of A and B**:     The expected value of a single die roll (either A or B) is:     [     mathbb{E}[A] = mathbb{E}[B] = frac{1}{6} (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)     ]     Calculate the sum inside the expectation:     [     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21     ]     Thus:     [     mathbb{E}[A] = mathbb{E}[B] = frac{21}{6} = 3.5     ]     Therefore:     [     mathbb{E}[A times B] = 3.5 times 3.5 = 12.25     ] 4. **Mathematical Expectation of Square Area for Vasya**:     Vasya rolls the die once, and the side length of his square is determined by the outcome of that roll.

The exceptions to this theorem occur in specific small cases.    For ( n > m ) and ( m geq 1), we need to consider the exceptions to Zsigmondy's theorem.

We will first prove that if the triangle satisfies the condition then it is isosceles and right-angled at ( A ). 1. **Choosing Specific Point ( D )**:     Choose ( D ) to be the point where the angle bisector from ( A ) meets ( BC ).     - Note that ( P ) and ( Q ) lie on the rays ( AB ) and ( AC ) respectively.     - Furthermore, ( P ) and ( Q ) are reflections of each other in the line ( AD ), leading to ( PQ perp AD ).     - Therefore, ( D' ) lies on the line ( AD ), deducing that either ( D' = A ) or ( D' ) is the second intersection point of the angle bisector at ( A ) with the circumcircle of ( ABC ). 2. **Analyzing ( D' )**:     - Since ( APDQ ) is a cyclic quadrilateral, the segment ( PQ ) intersects the segment ( AD ).     - As a result, ( D' ) lies on the ray ( DA ) and therefore ( D' = A ).      3. **Angle Calculation**:     By angle chasing, we get:     [     angle PD'Q = angle PDQ = 180^circ - angle BAC     ]     - Since ( D' = A ), we also know:     [     angle PD'Q = angle BAC     ]     - This implies:     [     angle BAC = 90^circ     ] 4. **Verifying Isosceles Property**:     - Now choose ( D ) to be the midpoint of ( BC ).     - Since ( angle BAC = 90^circ ), we can deduce that ( DPQ ) is the medial triangle of triangle ( ABC ).     - Thus, ( PQ parallel BC ) implying ( DD' perp BC ).     - The distance from ( D' ) to ( BC ) is equal to both the circumradius of triangle ( ABC ) and the distance from ( A ) to ( BC ). Therefore, this can only happen if ( A = D' ). Hence, ( ABC ) must be isosceles and right-angled at ( A ). **Proving the Converse**: 1. **Verification of the Property**:     - Given ( ABC ) is isosceles and right-angled at ( A ), let ( D ) be any point on side ( BC ).     - Then, reflection properties ensure ( DP = D'P ) and ( D'P = BP ).     - Similarly, ( D'Q = CQ ). 2. **Cyclic Quadrilateral**:     - Note ( APDQD' ) is cyclic with diameter ( PQ ), so:     [     angle APD' = angle AQD'     ]     - From this:     [     angle BPD' = angle CQP     ] 3. **Similarity and Congruence**:     - Triangles ( D'PB ) and ( D'QC ) are similar.     - Consequently,     [     angle PD'Q = angle PD'C + angle CD'Q = angle BD'C     ]     - Thus,     [     frac{D'P}{D'Q} = frac{D'B}{D'C}     ]     - Since ( DPQ ) and ( D'PQ ) are congruent, we have ( angle BD'C = angle PD'Q ).

Then, we will demonstrate that this leads to a contradiction due to the existence of more than 2016 lines in the plane. 3. **Single Color Points on a Line**: Suppose there are points of the same color that do not lie on a single line. If there are at least three such points, we can form a triangle with these points. Consider any triangle ( triangle ABC ) where ( A, B, C ) are of the same color, say color 1.     - By the problem's condition, we need at least two vertices of a triangle to be of the same color.      - Since ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are all the same color, this forms a triangle that violates this condition (i.e., it has all three vertices of the same color). 4. **Conclusion from Step 3**: Therefore, the assumption that not all points of a single color lie on a single line must be false.

When x_{1} > x_{2}, the relationship between y_{1} and y_{2} is ______.","output":"Given that points A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}) lie on the line y=kx+b where kneq 0, and the line does not pass through the fourth quadrant, we aim to find the relationship between y_{1} and y_{2} when x_{1} > x_{2}. 1. **Understanding the condition of the line not passing through the fourth quadrant**:    - The fourth quadrant is where x > 0 and y < 0.    - For a line not to pass through this quadrant, it must have a positive slope and a non-negative y-intercept. This is because:      - A positive slope (k > 0) ensures that as x increases, y also increases.      - A non-negative y-intercept (b geq 0) ensures that the line either touches or is above the x-axis.    Therefore, we have left{begin{array}{l}k>0 bgeq 0end{array}right.. 2. **Analyzing the relationship between x_{1} and x_{2}**:    - Given x_{1} > x_{2}, and knowing the slope of the line is positive (k > 0), we can deduce the relationship between y_{1} and y_{2}.    - Since k > 0, an increase in x leads to an increase in y. Therefore, if x_{1} > x_{2}, it logically follows that y_{1} > y_{2}. 3. **Conclusion**:    - Based on the above analysis, we conclude that when x_{1} > x_{2} for points A and B lying on the line y=kx+b (with kneq 0) and the line not passing through the fourth quadrant, the relationship between y_{1} and y_{2} is y_{1} > y_{2}.

Consider the inscribed hexagon ABCDEF, where O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and assume the three diagonals AD, BE, and CF are diameters of the circle. 2. Observe that each radius of the circle will bisect each segment formed by the intersections of adjacent triangles formed within the hexagon. 3. Because the diagonals AD, BE, and CF are all diameters, the segments OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, and OF are all equal to the radius of the circle. 4.

When the article is sold for Rs. 320, the gain is 12% more than when it is sold for Rs. 240. Let G be the gain when the article is sold for Rs. 240. Then, the gain when the article is sold for Rs. 320 is G + 12% of G, which can be written as G + 0.12G = 1.12G. Now, we can set up the equations based on the selling prices and the gains: Selling price for Rs. 240: C + G = 240  (1) Selling price for Rs. 320: C + 1.12G = 320  (2) Now, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to find the value of G: (C + 1.12G) - (C + G) = 320 - 240 C + 1.12G - C - G = 80 1.12G - G = 80 0.12G = 80 Now, we can solve for G: G = 80 / 0.12 G = 800 / 1.2 G = 666.67 Now that we have the value of G, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find the cost C: C + 666.67 = 240 C = 240 - 666.67 C = -426.67 However, the cost cannot be negative, which means there must be a mistake in our calculations.

For the first bill: The original amount is 200. The simple interest rate is 10% per month. Since it's 2 months overdue, the interest for each month would be 10% of 200, which is 20. So, the total interest for 2 months would be 20 * 2 = 40. Therefore, the total amount owed for the first bill is 200 + 40 = 240. For the third bill: The original amount is not given, but we know the late fees. The late fee for the first month is 40. The late fee for the second month is twice that, so 40 * 2 = 80. Therefore, the total late fees for the third bill are 40 + 80 = 120. Now, let's calculate the total amount owed without the second bill: Total owed = 1234 (total) - 240 (first bill) - 120 (third bill) = 874. This 874 is the total amount owed for the second bill, including the late fees for 6 months. Let's denote the late fee per month for the second bill as x. The original amount for the second bill is 130. The total late fees for 6 months would be 6x. So, the equation for the second bill is: 130 (original amount) + 6x (late fees) = 874 (total amount owed for the second bill). Now, let's solve for x: 6x = 874 - 130 6x = 744 x = 744 / 6 x = 124.

Suppose (Phi') contains an integer point ((m, n)).     - By symmetry relative to (x = 1/2), it also contains ((-m + 1, n)).     - These points imply that the horizontal segment at (y = n) intersects (Phi') in a segment of at least length (|2m - 1| geq 1).     - Hence, (Phi') must contain an integer point, which contradicts our initial assumption of the absence of integer points inside (Phi).      5. **The Two Cases**:     - **Case 1: (Phi') does not contain points ((x, y)) such that (x > 3/2) or (y > 3/2)**:                  - In this scenario, Phi' lies wholly inside a figure formed by a square of side (2) with corners cut off by squares of side (1/2).                  - The area (S') is then constrained to be ( leq 3 ) due to the convex hull considerations.                  - By isoperimetric inequality, ( frac{S'}{p'} leq sqrt{frac{S'}{pi}} ), implying ( S' / p' leq sqrt{3 / pi} < 1 ).              - **Case 2: (Phi') does contain points ((x, y)) such that (x > 3/2) or (y > 3/2)**:                  - Let the maximum (x)-coordinate (a > 3/2). Consider the point ((a, b)) with the highest (y)-coordinate ( b < 1 ).                  - The segment arising due to symmetry considerations for these points forms a trapezoid, coupling convexity results, provides the upper bound area as ( frac{1}{2}(a - 1/2) ), and (S' leq 2(a - 1/2)).                  - Consequently, the perimeter (p' geq 2(a - 1/2)). 6. **Final Conclusion**: From both cases, (frac{S'}{p'} leq 1), implying (S' leq p'). Since (Phi) and (Phi') share the same properties, including original area (S), the desired inequality (S leq p) holds.

Therefore, the equation is: [ x + 2 = 5x ] Simplify and solve for ( x ): [ 2 = 5x - x  2 = 4x  x = frac{2}{4}  x = frac{1}{2} ] This value for ( x ) means we do not have integer solutions, contradicting the requirement that ( x ) be an odd integer.

This means that his share after spending on drinks is his original share minus the amount spent on drinks: ( frac{3}{4}X - frac{1}{5}X = 132 ) To solve for ( X ), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 20.

We propose to generalize this pattern. 1. **Expressing the number (N):** Consider the number (N) which can be written as: [ N = a cdot 10^n + b cdot 10^{n-1} + cdots + l ] where (a, b, ldots, l) are the digits of (N). 2. **Factorization using the number 9:** Recall that (9 = 10 - 1).

The total area of the four walls can be calculated by finding the perimeter of the room (excluding the ceiling and floor) and multiplying it by the height of the room. Perimeter of the room (excluding ceiling and floor) = 2 * (length + breadth) = 2 * (25 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 40 feet = 80 feet Now, multiply the perimeter by the height of the room to get the total wall area: Total wall area = Perimeter * height = 80 feet * 12 feet = 960 square feet Next, we need to calculate the area of the door and the three windows to subtract from the total wall area.

So, they actually took one less break: Actual breaks taken = Total breaks - 1 Actual breaks taken = 10 - 1 Actual breaks taken = 9 breaks Each break was 30 minutes long, so the total break time in hours is: Total break time (in hours) = Number of breaks × Break duration (in hours) Total break time (in hours) = 9 breaks × 0.5 hours/break Total break time (in hours) = 4.5 hours Now, we need to subtract the total break time and the time spent looking for the hotel from the total trip time to find the actual driving time: Actual driving time = Total time - Total break time - Hotel search time Actual driving time = 50 hours - 4.5 hours - 0.5 hours Actual driving time = 45 hours Finally, we can calculate the total distance of the trip by multiplying the actual driving time by the constant speed: Total distance = Actual driving time × Speed Total distance = 45 hours × 62 miles/hour Total distance = 2790 miles Therefore, the trip was boxed{2790}  miles long."},{"instruction":"The product of 58 times 41 is closest to the estimated product of which of the following calculations?

This is because the path must move ( n-1 ) steps up and ( k-1 ) steps to the right, totaling ( n + k - 2 ) steps. 3. **Total Number of Borders:**    - The total number of borders that can be placed on the board is ( n(k-1) + k(n-1) ). This is because:      - There are ( n ) rows, each with ( k-1 ) horizontal borders.      - There are ( k ) columns, each with ( n-1 ) vertical borders.    - Simplifying, we get:      [      n(k-1) + k(n-1) = nk - n + kn - k = 2nk - n - k      ] 4. **Parity Consideration:**    - We need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of borders.    - The total number of borders modulo 2 is:      [      (n(k-1) + k(n-1)) mod 2 = (nk - n + kn - k) mod 2 = (2nk - n - k) mod 2      ]    - Since ( 2nk ) is always even, we have:      [      (2nk - n - k) mod 2 = (n + k) mod 2      ] 5. **Determining the Winning Strategy:**    - If ( n + k ) is even, then the total number of borders is even.    - If ( n + k ) is odd, then the total number of borders is odd.    - The game ends when there are no more valid moves, i.e., when the last border is placed.    - If ( n + k ) is even, the first player (Pasha) will place the last border.    - If ( n + k ) is odd, the second player (Vova) will place the last border. 6. **Conclusion:**    - The player who places the last border loses because they will block the path from the bottom left to the top right cell.    - Therefore, if ( n + k ) is even, the second player (Vova) wins.    - If ( n + k ) is odd, the first player (Pasha) wins.

Compound Interest: Compounding is the concept of earning returns on both the original investment and the accumulated interest or returns. Over time, as you reinvest your earnings, compounding allows your investment to grow exponentially, especially when coupled with a long time horizon. 2. Economic Growth: Historically, economies have generally grown over the long term, leading to increased corporate profits, rising stock prices, and higher property values. This growth is driven by factors such as technological advancements, population growth, productivity improvements, and inflation. 3. Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) helps reduce risk. Diversification allows you to participate in the growth potential of various sectors, mitigating the impact of negative performance in any single investment. 4. Risk-Reward Tradeoff: Investments that offer higher potential returns generally come with higher risk. But over the long term, the overall trend has been positive, with riskier investments tending to outperform safer ones. Long-term investors can weather short-term market volatility and benefit from the potential rewards of riskier investments. 5. Time to Recover from Market Downturns: The stock market and other investment markets experience periodic downturns and fluctuations. However, over an extended period, markets have historically recovered and continued growing. By staying invested over the long term, investors can ride out market downturns and potentially benefit from subsequent recoveries. 6. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Regularly investing a fixed amount of money, regardless of market conditions, is known as dollar-cost averaging. Through this approach, you buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. Over time, this strategy helps smooth out market volatility and can lead to favorable average purchase prices. It's important to note that while investments do tend to work well over the long term, they are not without risks. Market fluctuations, economic downturns, and other factors can affect investment performance. Therefore, it's advisable to consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and seek guidance from financial professionals when making investment decisions."},{"instruction":"用中文介绍beauty product vending machine有哪些特点","output":"beauty product vending machine是一种专门销售美容产品的自动售货机。它具有以下特点： 1. 多样化的产品选择：该售货机通常提供各种美容产品，包括化妆品、护肤品、美发产品等。消费者可以根据自己的需求选择适合自己的产品。 2. 24小时服务：这种售货机通常全天候开放，提供24小时的服务。无论是白天还是晚上，消费者都可以随时购买所需的美容产品，非常方便。 3. 快速、便捷：通过这种售货机购买美容产品非常快捷和便利。消费者只需选择所需产品和支付方式，然后机器会自动售出产品，无需等待、排队或与店员交互。 4. 个性化推荐：部分beauty product vending machine配备了智能技术，可以根据消费者的肤质、喜好等个人需求进行个性化推荐。这样消费者可以更容易找到适合自己的产品。 5. 规范的质量保证：这种售货机通常只提供来自正规渠道的品牌美容产品，消费者可以放心购买。而且机器还会定期进行维护和清洁，确保产品质量和卫生。 总之，beauty product vending machine通过提供多样化的产品选择、24小时服务、快速便捷的购物体验和个性化推荐等特点，为消费者提供了一种更加便利和高效的购买美容产品的方式。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍Spherical led display有哪些特点","output":"Spherical led display，即球形LED显示屏，具有以下特点： 1. 独特的球形设计：球形LED显示屏采用球形结构，可以呈现360度的全景视觉效果，无论从任何角度都能获得良好的观赏体验。 2. 高清显示效果：球形LED显示屏采用高分辨率的LED点阵，能够实现高清的画面显示。无论是图片、视频还是文字信息，都能清晰、细腻地呈现在球形屏幕上。 3. 良好的可视性：球形LED显示屏采用高亮度的LED灯珠，具有良好的光学特性，可以在室内或室外环境中提供鲜艳明亮的显示效果。即使在强光照射下，也能保持画面的清晰可见。 4. 多功能展示：球形LED显示屏可以显示各种形式的媒体内容，包括图片、视频、文字等。它可以用于商业广告、展览展示、舞台演出、娱乐活动等多种场景，具有较强的适用性。 5. 灵活的安装方式：球形LED显示屏可以根据具体的应用需求进行灵活的安装和调整。它可以悬挂在空中、安装在支架上或嵌入到建筑物等各种位置，为不同场景提供定制化的解决方案。 6. 可实现互动功能：部分球形LED显示屏可以配备互动技术，如触摸屏、手势识别等，使用户可以与显示屏进行互动交互，增加用户参与度和娱乐性。 总的来说，球形LED显示屏以其独特的球形设计、高清显示效果、良好的可视性和多功能展示等特点，为展示内容提供了创新、吸引人的方式，成为室内外各种场景中广泛应用的一种先进的显示技术。"},{"instruction":"用中文介绍round led advertising board有哪些特点","output":"round led advertising board是一种圆形LED广告牌，它具有以下特点： 1. 独特的圆形设计：round led advertising board采用圆形设计，与传统的矩形广告牌相比更加独特和吸引人。它可以为广告内容提供独特的展示形式，吸引更多的目光和注意力。 2. 高亮度的LED显示：该广告牌采用高亮度、高分辨率的LED灯珠，能够实现鲜艳明亮的画面显示。不论是在白天还是晚上，都能够提供清晰、醒目的广告展示效果，增强了视觉冲击力。 3. 动态、多媒体展示：round led advertising board能够播放动态的视频和动画，实现多媒体内容的展示。它可以展示生动的广告内容，吸引消费者的注意，并传递更丰富的信息。 4. 远距离可见：得益于高亮度的LED灯珠和特殊的圆形设计，round led advertising board在远距离上也能够清晰可见。这使得广告内容能够覆盖更广范围的人群，提高广告传播的效果。 5. 多种安装方式：round led advertising board可以通过吊挂、支架或墙壁等多种方式进行安装。这种灵活的安装方式使得它可以适应不同场所和环境的需要。 6. 耐用性强：round led advertising board通常采用高质量的材料和工艺制作，具有较强的防水、防尘和抗冲击性能，能够在室内外各种恶劣环境下长时间稳定运行。 总的来说，round led advertising board以其独特的圆形设计、高亮度的LED显示、多媒体展示和远距离可见等特点，成为一种广告媒体选择，能够吸引消费者的注意力，提高广告的传播效果。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

其次，我国金融市场的开放和国内企业与国际接轨的加强，对审计行业提出了更高的国际标准要求。例如，引入国际财务报告准则（IFRS）及其相关审计准则（ISA），加强透明度和信息披露，以及建立科学高效的内部控制制度等。这使得审计师需要不断更新知识和技能，提高专业水平，以适应国际化的审计需求。 然而，我国的审计行业也面临一些挑战和问题。首先，由于我国经济增长速度的放缓和部分行业的不景气，企业的盈利能力和财务状况可能受到影响，从而影响审计业务的稳定性和增长性。其次，一些企业存在不透明性和不规范的财务报表披露现象，给审计工作带来一定的困难和风险。同时，随着互联网金融、大数据和人工智能等新兴技术的迅猛发展，传统审计模式面临着转型和升级的压力，需要引入新的审计方法和工具。 面对以上的情况和挑战，我国审计行业需要加强自身建设，提高行业的整体素质和形象。首先，加大对审计人员的培训和教育力度，提高他们的专业水平和综合素质。其次，加强行业自律，提高审计的独立性和专业性，确保审计质量和诚信度。同时，推动审计创新，引入信息技术和大数据分析等工具，提高审计效率和精度。最后，密切关注国际审计准则的动态变化，推动我国审计行业与国际接轨，提高国际竞争力。"},{"instruction":"扩写我国审计行业面临的挑战和问题","output":"除了前面提到的财务报表不透明性和不规范的财务报表披露现象之外，我国审计行业还面临以下一些挑战和问题。 首先，信息技术的迅猛发展给传统审计模式带来了巨大冲击。在大数据和人工智能等新技术的推动下，审计工作需要更多地依赖数据分析和智能化的工具。这对审计师的技能和专业知识提出了更高要求，需要不断学习和适应新技术，不断提高自身能力和竞争力。 其次，审计行业在保持独立性和公正性的同时，也面临着与客户的关系维护和利益冲突的问题。一方面，审计师必须保证独立的审计意见，不受外界干扰；另一方面，他们也需要与客户建立良好的合作关系，为客户提供全面的审计服务。因此，审计师需要具备良好的沟通和应对压力的能力，以平衡各方的利益。 另外，审计行业还面临着人才短缺和创新能力不足的问题。由于审计师需要具备较高的专业素质和扎实的专业知识，培养一名合格的审计师需要很长时间。然而，随着审计需求不断增加和技术的快速更新，审计行业对高质量的人才需求也在增加，而市场上的供给相对不足。此外，传统审计模式的单一和陈旧也限制了行业的创新和发展。因此，培养更多优秀的审计人才，并推进审计创新是当前亟待解决的问题。

关键词：新农村建设，绿色金融，河南省，环境污染，资源浪费，绿色贷款，创新产品 一、引言 随着我国农村经济的快速发展，新农村建设成为当前农村改革的重要内容之一。然而，在新农村建设过程中，环境污染、资源浪费等问题也日益突出。为了推动河南省新农村建设的可持续发展，绿色金融作为一种新兴的金融模式，具有重要的推动作用。因此，本文旨在深入研究河南省新农村建设与绿色金融发展的关系，探讨如何有效应对新农村建设中出现的环境问题，并提出相应的政策建议。 二、河南省新农村建设现状 河南省是我国农业大省，新农村建设已经成为河南省农村改革的重要内容之一。目前，河南省新农村建设取得了一些成绩，如改善了农民生活条件、提高了农村经济效益等。然而，也存在一些问题，如环境污染、资源浪费等。另外，由于传统金融模式对新农村建设的限制，河南省新农村建设还面临着一些困难和挑战。 三、河南省新农村建设存在的问题 1. 环境污染 随着工业化进程的加速和城市化进程的推进，河南省农村地区的环境污染问题日益突出。农村工业、畜禽养殖等活动，排放大量废气、废水和固体废弃物，严重影响了农村生态环境的质量。解决农村环境污染问题，是保障农村生态环境健康的关键。 2. 资源浪费 在河南省新农村建设中，资源浪费问题也较为突出。农村生产活动中，存在着资源被浪费的现象，如农田水资源浪费、农药化肥过度使用等。解决资源浪费问题，是保障农村可持续发展的关键。 3. 传统金融模式限制 传统金融模式在新农村建设中的应用受到一定的限制，主要表现在两个方面：一是金融机构对新农村建设的资金支持力度较弱；二是传统金融模式对环境保护和可持续发展的需求反应较慢。 四、绿色金融的概念和特点 绿色金融是指以环境友好为导向，通过金融工具和服务，促进绿色经济发展和环境保护的金融活动。与传统金融相比，绿色金融有以下几个特点：一是注重社会和环境效益的双重收益；二是强调可持续发展和长期投资的重要性；三是关注生态环境保护和资源利用效率的提高。 五、绿色金融在新农村建设中的应用 绿色金融在新农村建设中具有重要的应用价值。具体来说，绿色金融可以通过以下方式支持新农村建设：一是提供绿色贷款，支持农村环境友好型产业的发展；二是推动绿色信用体系的建立，鼓励农村居民在环保、资源节约等方面的积极行为；三是创新绿色金融产品，如绿色债券、绿色基金等，为新农村建设提供多样化的融资渠道。 六、发展绿色金融的对策和建议 要推动河南省新农村建设与绿色金融的良性互动发展，需要采取一系列的对策和建议：一是政府部门应加大对新农村建设和绿色金融的政策支持力度；二是加强金融机构对新农村建设和绿色金融的金融产品创新和服务能力提升；三是加强公众的绿色金融意识和环保意识，提高绿色金融市场的发展活力。 七、结论

Firstly, California operates under a direct democracy system, allowing citizens to directly participate and vote on various legislative issues through the use of initiatives and referendums. This gives the people a more active role in the governing process compared to the federal model where representatives are elected to make decisions on behalf of the people. Secondly, California has a nonpartisan legislature, meaning that political parties are not officially recognized and candidates run as independents. This is in contrast to the federal model where political parties play a central role in the electoral process. Thirdly, California has a larger executive branch compared to the federal government. The governor of California holds significant powers, including the ability to veto legislation and make appointments to various state offices. In the federal model, the president holds similar powers but on a national scale. Fourthly, California has a unique budgeting process that differs from the federal government. California operates on a fiscal year that begins on July 1st, while the federal government operates on a fiscal year that begins on October 1st. Additionally, California requires a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of the state legislature to pass a budget, which can often lead to delays and stalemates. Fifthly, California has a different method of redistricting compared to the federal model. In California, an independent commission is responsible for redrawing legislative district boundaries every ten years, whereas in the federal system, redistricting is primarily left to the states. Lastly, California has its own court system that operates independently from the federal court system. The California Supreme Court is the highest court in the state and has the final authority on state law. b) The main goals of the Progressive movement in California were to bring \\"power to the people\\" and to combat corruption and inequality in politics. Progressives aimed to make the government more responsive to the needs of the people by implementing various reforms. Some of these reforms included the initiative and referendum process, which allowed citizens to directly propose and vote on legislation. This gave people a greater voice in the political process and allowed for direct democracy. Progressives also sought to regulate and control powerful corporations and monopolies through the implementation of labor and workplace safety laws. They believed that by enacting these regulations, the working class would be protected from exploitation and unfair treatment. Additionally, Progressives focused on social reforms such as women's suffrage, conservation of natural resources, and public education. They believed that society needed to progress and become more equal and just, and that these reforms were necessary in order to achieve that. c) The Initiative in California is considered the \\"4th Branch\\" of government because it allows citizens to directly propose and vote on legislation. The legal guidelines for initiative legislation require that a certain number of registered voters sign a petition supporting the proposed initiative in order for it to qualify for the ballot. Once on the ballot, voters then have the opportunity to vote in favor or against the initiative, and if it receives a majority of votes, it becomes law. The process of how an initiative becomes law starts with citizens drafting a proposed initiative and gathering sufficient signatures to meet the requirements. The Secretary of State then verifies the signatures and if there are enough valid ones, the initiative is placed on the ballot. Voters are then given the opportunity to vote on the initiative, and if it passes, it becomes law. Some of the benefits of using initiatives include providing citizens with a direct voice in the legislative process and allowing for policy changes that might not otherwise be achieved through the traditional legislative process. Initiatives also promote political engagement and mobilization among the electorate. However, there are also consequences to the use of initiatives. They can often be subject to manipulation by special interest groups who have the financial resources to gather signatures and push for initiatives that align with their own interests. Additionally, the complex wording of initiatives can confuse voters and can lead to unintended consequences or the passage of poorly drafted legislation."},{"instruction":"Are you aware of the 3n + 1 problem?","output":"Yes, I am aware of the 3n + 1 problem, also known as the Collatz conjecture. It is a famous unsolved mathematical problem that involves iterating a specific sequence of operations on a positive integer. The sequence starts with any positive integer n, and if n is even, it is divided by 2; if n is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and then added by 1. The process is repeated on the resulting number until it eventually reaches the value of 1. The conjecture is that no matter which positive integer n you start with, the sequence will always reach the value of 1."},{"instruction":"Write a recursive function in C++ to calculate 3n + 1","output":"Certainly! Here's an example of a recursive function in C++ to calculate 3n + 1: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> int calculate3nPlus1(int n) { // Base case: if n is 1, return 1 if (n == 1) { return 1; } // If n is even, divide it by 2 else if (n % 2 == 0) { return calculate3nPlus1(n / 2); } // If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 else { return calculate3nPlus1(3 * n + 1); } } int main() { int n; std::cout << \\"Enter a positive integer: \\"; std::cin >> n; int result = calculate3nPlus1(n); std::cout << \\"Result: \\" << result << std::endl; return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, the \`calculate3nPlus1\` function takes an integer \`n\` as input and returns the value of 3n + 1.

[译] | 宝玉的工程技术分享 2023 年即将过去，此刻不失为回首这一年人工智能领域研究成就、产业发展以及开源社区的盛况的好时机。 原文：AI and Open Source in 2023 盘点这一年的起起伏伏 作者：SEBASTIAN RASCHKA 博士 2023 年即将过去，此刻不失为回首这一年人工智能领域研究成就、产业发展以及开源社区的盛况的好时机。 当然，本文仅捕捉了那些最触动我思绪的热点话题。我还推荐您翻阅档案馆中的 研究亮点 月刊和 AI 前沿 #4-12 系列，那里有对这些主题更全面的深入报道。 2022 年科技趋势的发展 在今年的人工智能产品领域，我们似乎没有见识到真正创新的技术或思想。相对而言，今年的发展更多是基于去年成功模式的深化和扩展： ChatGPT 结合了 GPT 3.5 技术升级至 GPT 4 DALL-E 2 进化为更先进的 DALL-E 3 Stable Diffusion 2.0 演变成了更大型的 Stable Diffusion XL ... 市场上流传一个颇为引人注目的传闻，称 GPT-4 是由 16 个子模块构成的混合专家（MoE）模型，每个子模块据说拥有高达 1110 亿参数（供参考，GPT-3 的参数是 1750 亿个）。 来源于 2023 年人工智能状况报告的 GPT-3 与 GPT-4 的幽默对比图 尽管我们还无法完全确认，但 GPT-4 是基于 MoE（混合专家模型）的可能性非常高。一个明显的趋势是，工业界的研究者们越来越少地在他们的论文中公开信息。打个比方，GPT-1、GPT-2、GPT-3 和 InstructGPT 的论文都详尽地揭露了模型的架构和训练过程，而 GPT-4 如何构建却成了一个秘而不宣的谜。再比如，Meta AI 在其首篇有关 Llama 论文 中详细阐述了训练数据集的内容，但在 Llama 2 模型 中，这部分信息则被保密了。提一句，斯坦福大学最近发布的 The Foundation Model Transparency Index 显示，Llama 2 以 54% 领先于透明度排名，而 GPT-4 以 48% 居第三。 我们也许不能苛求企业分享他们的核心机密，但这种趋势还是颇值得关注。因为看起来，在 2024 年我们将持续这样的发展方向。 在规模扩展方面，今年的另一个趋势是增加了模型处理输入信息的长度。举例来说，与 GPT-4 竞争的 Claude 2 的亮点之一就是它可以处理高达 100k 的输入令牌（而 GPT-4 目前的上限是 32k 令牌），这对于对长篇文档进行总结处理来说非常有吸引力。而它对 PDF 文件的支持，更是在实际应用中增加了它的实用价值。 借助 Claude 2 快速创建 PDF 文件的内容摘要 开源界与研究潮流 记得去年，开源界特别钟情于 潜在扩散模型（latent diffusion models）（譬如 Stable Diffusion）及其他的计算机视觉技术。扩散模型和计算机视觉技术的重要性不减当年。但是，今年大语言模型（LLMs）在开源和研究圈里引起了更大的轰动。 Meta 发布的首个预训练模型 Llama，尽管使用许可受限，但却在研究者和开发者中掀起了波澜，比如 Alpaca、Vicuna、Llama-Adapter 和 Lit-Llama 等等。 几个月之后，Llama 2 出现了，我在 Ahead of AI #11: New Foundation Models 里有更深入的报道，它基本上取代了 Llama 1，成为更强大的基础模型，并推出了多个微调过的版本。尽管如此，现在的开源大语言模型大多仍然只处理文本，虽然如 Llama-Adapter v1 和 Llama-Adapter v2 这类的微调技术，承诺将现有的大语言模型扩展到多模态领域。 来自 Llama-Adapter V2 的示意图，详见 https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.15010 最近引人注目的是 Fuyu-8B 模型，它在不久前的 10 月 17 日才亮相。 取自 https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b 的图解 Fuyu-8B 模型有个独到之处，它直接将输入的图像切片传送到一个线性投影层（也就是嵌入层），自行学习图像切片的嵌入表示，而不像其他模型那样依赖一个预先训练好的图像编码器（比如 LLaVA 和 MiniGPT-V）这样的实践让整个架构和训练流程都简化了不少。 尽管我们提到了几个多模态的尝试，但目前研究的重点依然是如何用不足 100 亿参数的较小模型去匹敌 GPT-4 的文本处理能力。这主要是因为硬件资源的成本和限制、数据获取的困难，以及研究人员面临的发布压力，迫使他们需要在较短的时间内完成开发，而不是耗费数年时间训练一个模型。 不过，未来开源大语言模型（LLMs）的飞跃性进展，并不一定非得依赖于模型规模的增大。我们期待着看到，专家模型（MoE）技术在 2024 年是否能够帮助开源模型达到新的高度。 2023 年的研究领域内，有件事特别吸引人：除了我们熟知的基于变压器的大语言模型（LLMs），出现了一些新兴模型，比如循环型的 RWKV LLM 和卷积型的 Hyena LLM，它们的目标是提升效率。尽管如此，基于变压器的 LLMs 依旧是目前的技术顶峰。 来自斯坦福大学模糊研究团队对 Hyena LLM 架构的解读：https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna 放眼整个开源界，去年真是活跃异常，不断有令人激动的突破和进步出现。这个领域的特色就是集体智慧的力量远超个体。所以，看到有人在努力反对开源人工智能，我感到有些遗憾。但我还是希望我们能继续这股正能量，创造出更多高效的方案和替代品，而不是越来越依赖大公司推出的 ChatGPT 类产品。 在这个部分积极结束前，我要感谢开源和研究社区的贡献。我们见证了一些体积小、效能高的模型，如 1.3B 参数 phi1.5，7B Mistral 和 7B Zephyr，它们几乎能媲美大型私有模型的性能。这样的趋势让人振奋，我期待它在 2024 年能持续发展。 Ahead of AI

Lit-GPT——一个我正在积极参与的开源大语言模型项目。我虽然鼓励开源精神，但同样热爱设计精良的产品。 ChatGPT 问世以来，我们见证了大语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用。你作为本文读者，可能已经亲自体验过 ChatGPT，所以不用我多说，你知道 LLM 确实能在特定任务上大显身手。 关键在于我们得把它们用在 “对的” 地方。比如，我可能不会向 ChatGPT 询问我最爱的超市营业时间，但我最喜欢用它来纠正语法或者帮我重新构思句子和段落。更广泛地说，LLM 背后的大愿景是提升工作效率，这点你也许已经有所感受。 除了处理文本的 LLM，Microsoft 和 GitHub 的 Copilot 编程助手 也日渐成熟，越来越多的开发者开始转向使用它。今年初，Ark-Invest 发布的报告预测，编程助手能让编码任务的完成时间缩短约 55%。 这份图表来自 https://ark-invest.com/home-thank-you-big-ideas-2023/ 具体节省了超过 55% 的时间还是少于这个数字，虽有争议，但如果你尝试过编程助手，肯定能感受到它的便捷，它让原本枯燥的编码工作变得轻松许多。 有一点可以肯定：编程助手已经不可或缺，并将随着时间不断进步。它们会替代人类程序员吗？我并不希望如此。但毫无疑问，它们将提升程序员的工作效率。 那么这对 StackOverflow 来说意味着什么？《2023 年人工智能状况报告》中的一张图显示了 StackOverflow 的网站访问量与 GitHub 的对比情况，这可能与 Copilot 越来越多的被使用有关。不过，我认为 ChatGPT/GPT-4 已经在编程相关的任务中大放异彩。我还怀疑 ChatGPT 在某种程度上（甚至在很大程度上）导致了 StackOverflow 访问量的减少。 来自《2023 年人工智能状况》报告的图表 人工智能面临的问题 幻觉现象 如同 2022 年的情况，大语言模型（LLMs）依然存在着生成有毒内容和幻觉的问题。在过去的一年里，我探讨了好几种可能的解决方案，包括利用人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）和 Nvidia 推出的 NeMO Guardrails。不过，这些方案要么太过严苛，要么又显得不够到位。 到现在为止，我们还没有找到一个百分之百可靠的方法（甚至连一个合适的方法想法都没有）来彻底解决这一问题，同时又不损害 LLMs 的正面效能。我认为解决问题的关键在于我们如何使用 LLM：不应该过度依赖 LLM 解决所有问题，数学计算该用计算器，把 LLM 当作写作助手并严格审核其输出等。 另外，对于一些特定商业用途，考虑到检索增强型增强（RAG）系统可能是个不错的折中选择。通过 RAG 系统，我们能从大量文献中找到相关信息，并基于这些信息生成基于 LLM 的文本。这样的做法使得模型能够依赖现有的数据库和文件，而非单纯依赖于内部记忆的知识。 版权问题 与此同时，AI 领域的版权争议也日益严峻。据维基百科所述，\\"目前我们还不完全明了基于版权作品训练的 LLMs 的版权状况。\\" 整体来看，很多相关规定还在起草和修改过程中。我希望最终的规定能够明确具体，这样 AI 研究人员和从业者才能根据规定做出适当的调整。（更多关于 AI 与版权争议的讨论可以参考我写的这篇文章。） 评估 在学术研究领域，人们日益担忧一个问题：广受欢迎的基准测试和排名榜单可能已经失效，因为用于测试的数据集可能已经不慎泄露，成为了大语言模型（LLM）的训练材料。这个问题在讨论 phi-1.5 和 Mistral 时显得尤为突出，正如我在上一篇文章中分析的那样。 虽然通过询问人们的偏好来自动化评估 LLM 的效果是一个普遍方法，但这种方式较为复杂。许多研究报告选择使用 GPT-4 来进行评估，将其视作次优选择。 比如在 LIMA 论文中就有使用人类和 GPT-4 的偏好评价作为评估的例子。 收入问题 当前，生成性人工智能还在试验阶段。我们都知道，无论是文本还是图像生成工具，对于特定场景确实能提供帮助。但关于这些工具是否真的能给公司带来收益，尤其是在高昂的服务器托管和运行成本面前，业界还在激烈讨论中。例如，有报道称，OpenAI 在去年的运营中亏损了 5.4 亿美元。但与此同时，最近的报告指出，OpenAI 现在每月能赚取 8000 万美元，有望弥补或甚至超出它的运营开支。 虚假图像问题 生成式人工智能（AI）当前在社交媒体上的一个显著问题，就是假图片和视频的泛滥。假图片和视频问题由来已久，软件如 Photoshop 使制造假象变得更易于普及，而 AI 技术正在将此现象推向一个全新的高度。 目前也有其他 AI 系统尝试识别由 AI 产生的内容，但无论是文本、图片还是视频，这些系统的可靠性都不高。要控制和抗击这类问题，我们唯一的办法似乎是求助于信誉良好的专家。正如我们不会轻易接受网上随便一个论坛或网站的医疗或法律意见，我们也不应当不加甄别地信任网络上随意账户分享的图片和视频。 数据集的瓶颈 涉及早前讨论的版权争议，不少公司（包括 Twitter/X 和 Reddit）关闭了他们免费的 API 接入点。他们这样做既是为了增加收益，也是为了阻止数据采集器搜集平台数据进行 AI 训练。 我发现很多公司都在做与数据集相关的业务广告。AI 可能导致某些职位的自动化，这是遗憾的一面，但它同样也在创造新的就业机会。 要为开源长期语言模型（LLM）的进步做出贡献，一个好方法可能就是建立一个众包数据集的平台。我的意思是编写、收集和整理那些已经明确允许用于 LLM 训练的数据集。 RLHF 是锦上添花吗？ 当 Llama 2 的模型系列面市时，我对其中包含了针对聊天功能进行了微调的模型感到非常兴奋。Meta AI 通过人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）技术，成功提升了模型的实用性和安全性——关于 RLHF 的更多详细内容，我在这篇文章里有深入讨论。 图片来自 Llama 2 的研究报告：开源基础与特定于聊天的微调模型，详情参见 https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288 尽管 RLHF 作为一个新颖且充满潜力的技术，在 InstructGPT、ChatGPT 和 Llama 2 之外并未广泛采用，我还是对发现其日益增长的受欢迎度的图表感到意外。由于 RLHF 技术的应用还不普遍，这种趋势出乎我的意料。 这是从 State of AI 2023 报告中提取的关于 RLHF 流行度上升的趋势图表。 强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）的过程比较复杂，不易操作，所以许多开源项目依然选择在指导性微调上做监督学习。 最近，有了一个新选择叫做直接偏好优化（DPO）。相关论文中，研究者们发现，原本用于在 RLHF 中调整奖励模型的交叉熵损失，可以直接应用于大语言模型（LLM）的微调。他们的基准测试显示，DPO 不仅效率更高，而且通常在生成回应的质量上也比 RLHF/PPO 更胜一筹。 图中为 DPO 论文 中的解释性插图 目前，DPO 还没有普及。但是，让人振奋的是，两周前我们首次看到了一个经 DPO 方法训练出的开源大语言模型。这个模型由 Lewis Tunstall 和他的同事们开发 DPO via Lewis Tunstall and colleagues，在性能上似乎已经超过了采用 RLHF 训练的更大的 Llama-2 70b 对话模型： 截自 Zephyr 7B 发布公告 不过，我们要注意的是，RLHF 技术并不是专门用来提升基准测试的性能；它主要的优化目标是 “有用性” 和“无害性”，而这些是通过人类用户来评判的，本次公告并没有涉及这方面的内容。 # 谁来分类？上周，我在 Packt's 生成式 AI 会议 上进行了一次演讲，时间是几周前，我强调了文本模型最常见的应用之一还是分类任务。比如，我们熟悉的电子邮件垃圾过滤、文档归类、客户评价分类以及社交媒体上的有害言论标注等。 基于我的实践经验，即使是使用 “小型” 的大语言模型（LLMs），比如 DistilBERT，仅用一块 GPU，也能取得相当不错的分类效果。 这是我会上演讲的一部分，向大家展示了怎样将小型的 LLMs 用作文本分类器进行细致调整 在今年我开设的 深度学习基础课 的第 8 单元，我发布了一个练习，是关于如何使用小型的 LLMs 来做文本分类的。其中，Sylvain Payot 通过对现成的 Roberta 模型进行微调，在 IMDB 电影评论数据集上取得了超过 96% 的预测准确率。作为对比，我曾经用那个数据集训练的最好的传统机器学习模型——词袋模型，其准确率只有 89%。 在我教授的《深度学习基础》课堂上，我们探讨了什么是最佳的分类模型。 不过，直到现在，我还没有发现任何关于分类的大语言模型（LLMs）的重大新进展或趋势。大部分从业人员还是倾向于使用基于 BERT 的编码模型或者像 2022 年推出的 FLAN-T5 这样的编码 - 解码模型。这或许是因为这些模型的表现依旧出乎意料地好，而且相当给力。 表格数据现状速览 2022 年，我写了篇博客《简述表格数据深度学习的发展历程》，里面介绍了许多深度学习处理表格数据的新颖方法。但是，和上面提到的用于分类的 LLMs 类似，表格数据领域似乎也没什么太大的进展，或者是我忙到没能跟上最新动态。 一个表格数据集的实例，供你参考。2022 年，Grinsztajn 和他的团队发表了论文 为何树形模型在表格数据处理上仍优于深度学习？ 我认为论文中的核心观点——在小到中等规模的数据集上（例如 10k 训练样例），树形模型（比如随机森林和 XGBoost）仍然比深度学习方法表现得更好——依旧成立。 在这个话题上，XGBoost 在近十年的发展后，发布了具有里程碑意义的 2.0 版本，这个版本在内存效率上做得更好，支持内存容量以外的大数据集处理，加入了多目标树等诸多新功能。 2023 年计算机视觉回眸 尽管今年的热点集中在 LLMs 上，但计算机视觉领域也不断进展。鉴于篇幅所限，我不打算赘述最新的计算机视觉研究。不过，我有一篇关于《2023 年计算机视觉研究概况》的文章，它是我参加了今年夏天的 CVPR 2023 后所写： 人工智能前沿 #10:2023 年计算机视觉状况 塞巴斯蒂安 · 拉斯卡 博士 · 7 月 6 日 尽管大语言模型（LLM）的开发步伐未减，AI 规制的争论不断，但与之相关的新闻似乎比以往来得慢了一些。此刻正好可以把目光转向一直在辛勤工作却不太引人注意的计算机视觉领域，探讨它目前的研究进展和发展动态。讨论这个话题，也恰好与我参加的 2023 年温哥华 CVPR 大会的精彩回顾相吻合，那是迄今我体验过的最佳会议场地。阅读完整故事 除了学术研究，计算机视觉技术在人工智能领域催生了许多新产品和体验，它们在今年获得了显著的成长。 比如，今年夏天我在奥斯汀参加 SciPy 会议 时，亲眼目睹了首批真正的无人驾驶 Waymo 汽车在街上行驶。 在电影产业，AI 的应用越来越普及，最近的一个案例就是电影《印第安纳 · 琼斯 5》里，制片方用 AI 技术恢复了哈里森 · 福特的青春面貌，他们利用演员过去的影像资料来训练 AI。 还有，生成型人工智能（generative AI）技术已经成为许多流行软件产品的核心功能。Adobe's Firefly 2 就是一个新近的例证。 展望 2024 预测总是充满变数和挑战。回顾去年，我曾预见大语言模型（LLMs）将拓展到文本和编码之外的新领域。比如，“HyenaDNA”（HyenaDNA）就是专门解析 DNA 的语言模型。又如 “Geneformer”（Geneformer），这是一个预先在 3000 万个单细胞转录组上进行训练的模型，旨在推动网络生物学的预测能力。 展望 2024 年，LLMs 预计将在计算机科学之外的 STEM 研究领域发挥更大影响。 另一方面，由于高性能 GPU 紧缺，各大公司纷纷开发定制的 AI 芯片。Google 正在对其 TPU 硬件（TPU 硬件）进行加倍投资，Amazon 已推出了 Trainium 芯片（Trainium 芯片），AMD 也可能在与 NVIDIA 的竞争中迎头赶上。Microsoft（Microsoft）和 OpenAI（OpenAI）也加入了自主研发 AI 芯片的行列。他们面临的挑战是如何在主流的深度学习框架中全面、稳定地支持这些硬件。 在开源界，我们还未能追上那些最大型的封闭源代码模型的步伐。目前公开的最大模型是 Falcon 180B（Falcon 180B）。但这不必过于忧虑，毕竟大部分人并没有足够的硬件资源去运行这些庞大的模型。与其追求更大型的模型，我更期待能看到更多开源的 MoE（专家模型）出现，它由多个小型子模块组成，更早前我在文章中已有讨论。 我还对人们共同创建数据集的热情和 DPO（DPO）在顶尖开源模型中取代传统监督式微调的趋势感到乐观。 今年夏天，我在 Leanpub 平台上发布了我的新作《Machine Learning Q and AI》的电子版草稿。现在，我非常激动地告诉大家，这本书的印刷版本已经可以在 No Starch Press 和

2023年对于人工智能界来说，无疑是充满创新、挑战与突破的一年。作为一名自媒体内容策划师，我亲历了这一系列的变迁。从早期对ChatGPT和DALL-E的狂热追捧，到后来大模型变革的急剧发展，每一刻的技术风采都深深打动了我。深挖这一年的起伏变化，不妨从几个关键点开始透视背后的故事。 首先，我们得谈谈这一年大放异彩的GPT-4。在人工智能产品的革新中，GPT-4无疑是一道亮丽的风景线。它的强大之处，不仅在于那震撼人心的1110亿参数设计，更在于其背后的混合专家（MoE）架构。这种模型的潜力是巨大的，能够为特定任务配置专家子模块，进而大幅提升效能和灵活性。诸如此类的变革，着实展示了工业界在AI研究与开发上无穷的创新动力。 然而，与此同时，逐渐收紧的信息公开策略，也隐约流露出一个令人忧虑的趋势：在学术透明度和工业机密之间，我们似乎更倾向于后者。斯坦福大学公布的透明度指数则应运而生，为我们提供了一个评估尺度。这种状况不禁让我深思，在追求技术进步的同时，我们是否也该更注重知识的共享与交流？ 转向开源社区，去年深受欢迎的潜在扩散模型——Stable Diffusion，今年似乎有所低调。但这并不意味着开源大语言模型（LLMs）的光芒有所减弱。相反，各种创新的扩展，在文本处理、多模态学习等方面的突破，正静悄悄地改变着我们的预期。以Fuyu-8B为例，这种直接学习图像切片的嵌入表示的实践，不仅简化了架构和训练流程，也让我们看到了AI模型向着更高效、更直接的处理多媒体数据的可能性。 当然，无论是开源界的突破，还是工业界的创新，都绕不开一个永恒的话题：生产力。在过去的一年里，我们看到了LLMs在多个领域的实际运用，从聊天机器人的语法纠错到编程助手的代码提示，都彰显了AI技术提升工作效率的承诺。更重要的是，这种发展趋势，在未来仍将持续演进和深化。 问题也始终伴随着机遇。人工智能面临的幻觉现象、版权争议、数据集泄露等问题，始终是业界亟待解决的难题。如何平衡效能与道德、自由与规则，在科技与人文之间找到合适的折中，成为了所有人工智能从业者都需要思考的课题。 在我的观察中，2024年人工智能的发展趋势将更加注重多样性和细分化。我们有理由相信，混合专家模型、多模态学习以及开源社区的辛勤工作，将共同塑造一个更为丰富、更高效、更符合人性化需求的人工智能未来。 至此，我想说感谢这一年每一位在AI领域辛勤努力的研究人员、工程师和内容创作者。是你们共同铸就了这一年的辉煌成就。展望未来，2024年注定将是一个更加令人振奋的年份，AI的旅途，正扬帆远航。"},{"instruction":"","output":"No, asking someone's ethnicity is not a polite or appropriate question.

Trevor was a wild and unpredictable menace, always seeking chaos and mayhem, while Michael was a former bank robber turned househusband, trying to live a mundane life. One sunny afternoon, Trevor found himself wandering aimlessly through the streets of Los Santos. His twisted mind craved something out of the ordinary, something to spark his inner flame. As if fate played its hand, he stumbled upon the grandeur of Michael De Santa's mansion. Intrigued by the extravagant allure of the mansion, Trevor decided to venture inside. The thought of trespassing thrilled him, and he relished the idea of infiltrating the very home of a man he both despised and secretly admired. The promise of chaos lured him in. As Trevor stepped foot inside, he couldn't help but appreciate the opulence that surrounded him. The marble pillars, luxurious furniture, and intricate artwork seemed out of place to him. Nonetheless, he subtly smirked at the thought of disturbing this picture-perfect life he so loathed. As he roamed the immaculate halls, Trevor couldn't help but ponder the mysteries hidden behind each door. He peered into rooms filled with designer clothes, expensive electronics, and even stumbled upon Michael's personal office, littered with papers and photos of his former criminal escapades. As Trevor pressed further, his curiosity led him to Michael's personal space, his private sanctuary. The room exuded a sense of comfort and escape from the outside world. There, he found a shelf filled with books, pictures of his family, and even a collection of classic movies. Amidst the chaos that typically defined Trevor, a strange sensation crept up within him. It was a glimpse into the life he could never have - a life of peace, familial warmth, and stability. Trevor couldn't help but wonder what it must be like to have friends who genuinely cared. Lost in his thoughts, Trevor was startled by a sound behind him. He turned, and there stood Michael himself, wearing an expression that embodied a mixture of shock, anger, and confusion. For a moment, the two men locked eyes, each sizing up the other's intentions. In an instant, Trevor's wild mind fixed any sense of guilt and swiftly reverted back to its truest form - pure chaos. He lunged forward, grabbing a nearby vase, shattering it against the wall, and began cackling uncontrollably. It was a familiar sight to Michael, who had been on the receiving end of Trevor's unpredictable nature before. As Michael watched, a mixture of anger and resignation filled him. Deep inside, he knew that confronting Trevor would lead to nothing but trouble. Instead, he chose a different approach, opting to lock away his frustration and maintain the facade of normalcy he had worked so hard to create. The two men parted ways that day, one embracing chaos and violence, while the other retreated to his counterfeit domestic bliss. Perhaps, in some twisted way, they understood that they were two sides of the same coin, destined to remain in a constant dance between chaos and peace. And so, Trevor Phillips continued his life of madness, wandering through the cracked and grimy streets of Los Santos, forever searching for the next thrill, while Michael De Santa retreated into the safety of his mansion, forever haunted by the specter of his past life and the ever-present reminder of the man he could never outrun."},{"instruction":"in power bi if the columns of both the tables are same so how can we make data models","output":"If the columns of both tables are the same, you can create a data model by combining them using the \\"Append Queries\\" or \\"Union\\" feature in Power BI.

Here's the process: 1. Identify the tables involved: Identify the tables with the many-to-many relationship and the duplicate data. Let's call them Table A and Table B. 2. Create a bridge table: Create a new table, called the bridge table, to act as an intermediary between Table A and Table B. The bridge table will contain unique combinations of keys from both tables. 3. Determine the unique keys: Identify the unique keys in both Table A and Table B that establish the many-to-many relationship. These keys are typically primary key columns. 4. Populate the bridge table: Populate the bridge table by combining the unique keys from Table A and Table B. Each entry in the bridge table represents a valid relationship between specific rows in Table A and Table B. 5. Create relationships: Establish relationships between the bridge table and Table A, as well as between the bridge table and Table B. Ensure that the relationship type is set to \\"Many-to-Many\\" for both relationships. 6. Use the bridge table in reports: Utilize the bridge table in your Power BI reports when you need to analyze the many-to-many relationship. You can use fields from Table A, Table B, and the bridge table to create relevant visuals and perform calculations. By using a bridge table, you can create an indirect many-to-many relationship without duplicating data. The bridge table serves as a connector, facilitating analysis between the two tables with the many-to-many relationship."},{"instruction":"data are same in both the table how we can find unique key","output":"If the data is the same in both tables and you need to establish a unique key for modeling purposes in Power BI, you can follow these steps: 1.

In this meeting, we can openly discuss the strategies, plans, and potential adjustments required to mitigate the impact of these construction activities. The meeting agenda should primarily include: 1. Presentation of the AIP construction plan for Zone 5. 2. Detailed discussion on the potential impact of the construction activities on our projects in the same area. 3. Examination of the overlapping timelines, areas of concern, and potential conflicts. 4. Collaborative brainstorming and suggestion of alternative approaches to ensure that both projects progress smoothly. 5. Formation of a joint action plan that guarantees minimal disruptions to our respective projects while emphasizing coordinated efforts. Given the urgency of this matter, I would like to propose a meeting date and time within the next week. I kindly request your prompt response to determine a mutually convenient schedule for all involved stakeholders. Additionally, please let us know if there are any specific requirements or documents you would like us to bring to the meeting to aid our discussion. Please feel free to contact me directly at [Your Contact Details] or via email at [Your Email Address] to confirm the meeting date, time, and location. I sincerely appreciate your cooperation in addressing this issue promptly and ensuring the smooth progress of our projects in Zone 5. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Tạo một môi trường an toàn, không đánh giá hay phê phán để họ có thể cảm thấy thoải mái hơn khi chia sẻ. 4.

The guy has bright green hair and is sleeping so peacefully despite the fact that he barely fits on the bed. Mike is extremely confused, and Sully is a little worried about this new human sleeping in front of them.","output":"Mike Wazowski and Sully, the dynamic duo from Monsters, Inc., found themselves on a peculiar adventure one sunny afternoon. They were strolling through the closet doors, ready to entertain a young child and collect some laughter. However, as they stepped into the closet, they found themselves in a surreal and unexpected scene. Before them lay an abandoned gym, with old basketball hoops dangling from the ceiling and dusty exercise equipment scattered about. In the center of the room, nestled upon a racecar bed, was a grown man fast asleep. A shock of bright green hair adorned his head, contrasting with the peaceful expression on his face. Mike, being the ever inquisitive and observant monster, scratched his head in utter confusion. \\"Sully, what in the monster world is going on here? Where is the kid we were supposed to entertain?\\" Sully, towering over Mike, gazed at the man with concerned eyes. \\"I'm not entirely sure, Mike, but something doesn't seem quite right. He's sound asleep, even though he barely fits on that tiny racecar bed.\\" As they approached, the man stirred slightly, his green hair shifting like moss on a rock. Mike, with his acute attention to detail, noticed that the man's hair seemed oddly familiar. \\"Sully, doesn't his hair remind you of that time we accidentally spilled lime Jell-O on Randall during his birthday?\\" Sully gasped. \\"You're right, Mike! It does! But how did this human end up with such vivid green hair? It's certainly not natural.\\" Curiosity piquing, Mike clambered up the edge of the racecar bed and tapped the man's shoulder. \\"Excuse me, sir? Sir! Wake up!\\" Slowly, the man's eyes fluttered open. He stared at the two monsters, expecting to wake up in his own bed but instead finding himself in a peculiar place. Blinking his sleepy eyes, he finally registered the sight before him. \\"Whoa, dudes! Am I dreaming or are you guys some sort of monster celebrities?\\" Mike jumped back, startled by the man's sudden awakening. \\"No, no, no! We're not celebrities. We're just trying to find a child to scare, uh, I mean entertain! Who are you, and how did you end up here with your wild hair? Are you lost?\\" The man chuckled, stretching his lanky body on the tiny racecar bed. \\"Nah, you guys are just going to laugh at me. I'm Dwayne, and this is my secret hideout. I decided to take a nap here after a long night out, and then I woke up in this crazy place. And this green hair? Well, let's just say it's part of my unique style!\\" Sully exchanged a concerned glance with Mike. \\"Well, Dwayne, this isn't our usual hangout, either. We're monsters, employed to scare, uh, entertain kids. Can you give us any clues as to how we ended up here, together?\\" Dwayne scratched his head and pondered for a moment. \\"You know what? I think I might have accidentally stumbled into your world through a hidden closet door at a costume party last night. Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy, but being here with you guys is quite the dream!\\" As the trio chatted, Mike gradually realized that Dwayne wasn't someone they needed to be nervous about. Sully's worry softened as well. They found something strangely endearing about this wild-haired man and his carefree demeanor. From that day forward, Mike, Sully, and Dwayne became the unlikeliest trio of friends. They explored the abandoned gym, engaging in impromptu races on the racecar bed and creating laughter-filled memories. Eventually, they even managed to find another closet door, guiding Dwayne back to where he belonged. And so, their adventure came to an end, but the unlikely friendship between a little green monster, a furry blue giant, and a wild-haired man stayed strong. Through the power of unexpected encounters, they discovered that sometimes the most captivating friendships emerge from the most bewildering situations."},{"instruction":"Самостоятельная работа Определите, какое средство выразительности использовано в следующих рекламных текстах: 2.

Which is the new care plan/task list) Splitting up some of his washing as he used to do it all on one day and it was far too much to cope with for the clothes line. (clothes, bedding, bath mats, towels - could be 4 or 5 loads of washing) CP - went to put his 1st load straight in the drier. I said, what are you doing that for? it is not raining. You need to hang it out. He said, it's gong to rain. I encouraged him to hang this load out, which he did. In the morning CP - did one load of clothes washing on HOT wash. I asked, what for? he said the towels, etc. were smelly. Personally, I never wash in the HOT cycle. Should anyone be washing on the HOT cycle? So perhaps a sign could be put on the drier, and the residents also over there could all be told the same thing, that the drier shoud be for \\"emergencies\\" and rainy weather only. The dishwasher - I have seen that be put on the Pots and Pans cycle, for a smallish load as well, when it probably only needs regular or a Quick cycle. CP often - just choose cycles for clothes or dishes that are the longest, as he thinks everything needs it.","output":"Dear [Sender], Thank you for bringing up the concerns regarding the use of the dryer and dishwasher. I understand the need to enforce the \\"only for emergencies\\" rule, similar to what we have implemented at Maidenhair. It's important for everyone to be aware of the appropriate use of these appliances. I will take immediate action to put up a sign on the dryer reminding residents that it should be reserved for emergencies and rainy weather only. Additionally, I will communicate this information to all residents at the facility to ensure everyone is on the same page. Regarding the dishwasher, I will remind all residents that it's important to choose the appropriate cycle for the load being washed. Opting for the shortest and most efficient cycle, such as the regular or quick cycle, is generally recommended for smaller loads. I will make sure to emphasize this to all residents to help maximize the efficiency of our dishwasher usage. Thank you for bringing these matters to my attention.

Neither of them know that this grown man is the Wordgirl villain Whammer, known for his inhuman strength but oddly loveable and childlike nature.","output":"Once upon a time in the bustling city of Monstropolis, monsters Mike Wazowski and Sully were hard at work at their scaring duties in the scream factory. As they walked through the maze of closets, their goal was to find just the right one to enter and entertain a child with their playful scare tactics. However, little did they know that this particular day would be unlike any other. They stumbled upon a closet that seemed different from the rest, devoid of any childish drawings or toys scattered around. Curiosity piqued, Mike and Sully cautiously pushed open the creaky door and stepped inside. To their surprise, instead of being greeted by a cheerful child, they found themselves standing in what appeared to be an abandoned gymnasium. Confused, Mike scratched his head beneath his one big eye, not quite sure how they ended up there. Sully, always the cautious one, peered ahead, scanning the room for any signs of trouble. And that's when their eyes landed on a peculiar sight – a grown man fast asleep on a racecar bed in the middle of the gym. This man had bright green hair, which contrasted oddly against the room's dim lighting. Despite the fact that he barely fit on the small racecar bed, he slept so deeply and peacefully, as if he hadn't a care in the world. Mike, being the curious little monster he was, couldn't help but approach the unusual sleeper. \\"Hey, Sully, do you see what I'm seeing? Who is this guy? And what is he doing here?\\" Sully, always the observant one, recognized the man immediately. \\"Mike, that's the Wordgirl villain Whammer! Known for his incredible strength, but also his odd childlike behavior.\\" Mike's eye widened as he peered closer. \\"Wait, you mean he's a villain? He looks like he should be on a kid's television show!\\" Sully nodded, a small smile tugging at his lips. \\"That's the thing about Whammer, Mike. He may have his villainous tendencies, but deep down, he's actually quite lovable.\\" The green-haired man stirred, opening his eyes lazily. As he spotted the two monsters standing before him, he beamed with joy. \\"Hey, friends! Did you come to play with me? I love new friends!\\" Mike and Sully exchanged glances, still unsure of how to react, but unable to resist Whammer's childlike charm. \\"Uh, hello there,\\" Mike greeted cautiously, trying to find common ground. \\"We're looking for a kid to scare. Do you know if there's any around here?\\" Whammer's eyes lit up with excitement. \\"Oh, you guys like scaring? That's fun! But how about we play with some toys instead? I've got a whole toy box here!\\" he said, gesturing toward the corner of the gym where an old, dusty box sat. Unable to resist Whammer's enthusiastic invitation, Mike and Sully gingerly approached the box. As they peeked inside, they found an array of colorful toys, waiting for playtime. For the next few hours, the unlikely trio, monsters and villain alike, played with all the toys, laughing and unleashing the joy of their inner child. Whammer's tremendous strength made for some interesting toy car races, while Mike and Sully's agility and creativity brought a whole new level of fun to the game. Unbeknownst to them, their presence in that forgotten gym ignited a spark of innocence and friendship in Whammer's heart. Though considered a villain, Whammer's unique love for playtime and childlike nature meant that he didn't fit into the mold of what others expected of him. As the day came to a close, the three newfound friends bid each other farewell. But Whammer promised to keep their joyful memories close to his heart, vowing to approach his villainous deeds with a new perspective, one that embraced the power of friendship and laughter.

Jacques Fort founded the business in 1957 as a private limited company. He owned 100 % of the shares and managed the company strictly, making most of the decisions himself. FI grew through both internal and external growth. Later, it began to manufacture aircraft parts for other manufacturers. Jacques led his workforce by using Taylor’s motivation theory. He regularly set clear objectives and monitored his employees carefully. Employees had to meet international quality and safety standards. Although Jacques was controlling, employees had job security and believed that he had their best interests at heart. FI became a public limited company in 1988 and grew. Jacques found this transition difficult. He liked privacy and rarely spoke to the media. This had to change. Employees also began to ask for less supervision, wider spans of control and greater control over quality standards. Jacques retired in 2000 and his son, Henri, took over as CEO. Henri consults widely with his executive team and line managers on all decisions. Recently, FI has been struggling with liquidity. Henri implemented strict cost controls and analysed ratios","output":"One advantage of FL for motivating its employees using Taylor's motivation theory is the clear objectives and monitoring system. By setting clear objectives, employees have a clear understanding of what is expected of them and how their performance will be evaluated. This provides them with a sense of direction and purpose, which can be motivating. Additionally, the monitoring system ensures that employees are held accountable for their performance and can help identify areas for improvement, leading to increased motivation as employees strive to meet or exceed expectations. One disadvantage of FL for motivating its employees using Taylor's motivation theory is the lack of autonomy and control for employees. Taylor's theory emphasizes control and strict supervision, which can limit employees' ability to make their own decisions and have control over their work. This can lead to feelings of disempowerment and demotivation, as employees may feel like they are not trusted or valued for their skills and expertise. Additionally, this approach may hinder creativity and innovation, as employees may not feel empowered to think outside the box or suggest new ideas."},{"instruction":"Why I’m get frozen when my lead is coming to meeting?","output":"There could be several reasons for feeling frozen or anxious when your lead is coming to a meeting.

Initialize the concentration distribution function (\`f_i\`) on the lattice nodes. 2. Update the distribution function using the lattice Boltzmann collision step. 3. Implement a specular reflection boundary condition at the boundary where no flux is desired. This condition ensures that the distribution function entering the boundary node is equal to the distribution function leaving the boundary node. This is done by swapping the distribution function values between the incoming and outgoing directions at the boundary node. 4. Perform Lattice Boltzmann streaming step to propagate the distribution function to neighboring nodes. 5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 until convergence is reached. Here is a code snippet in Python illustrating the implementation of the no flux boundary condition in the lattice Boltzmann method for concentration: \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Initialize concentration distribution function f_i = np.zeros((N, M, D)) # N, M: lattice size, D: number of velocity directions # Main loop for t in range(num_iterations): # Lattice Boltzmann collision step for i in range(N): for j in range(M): for d in range(D): # Update f_i using collision equation # Apply no flux boundary condition at the boundary nodes if (i == 0) or (i == N-1) or (j == 0) or (j == M-1): f_i[i, j, d] = f_i[i, j, opposite_direction[d]] # Swap distribution function values # Lattice Boltzmann streaming step for i in range(N): for j in range(M): for d in range(D): # Propagate the distribution function to neighboring nodes # Check for convergence and perform other required computations \`\`\` In this code snippet, \`N\` and \`M\` represent the lattice size in the x and y directions, respectively, and \`D\` is the number of velocity directions. The \`f_i\` array stores the concentration distribution function at each lattice node. The main idea behind implementing the no flux boundary condition is to swap the distribution function values between the incoming and outgoing directions at the boundary nodes. The \`opposite_direction\` array is used to store the indices of the opposite direction for each velocity direction. By applying the no flux boundary condition, you ensure that the concentration remains constant at the boundary nodes, mimicking the behavior of a no flux boundary in the lattice Boltzmann simulation."},{"instruction":"viết code c làm menu 10 chức năng chức năng 1 kiểm tra số nguyên hiện thị ra số nguyên tố , số chính phương,số hoàn hảo và số nguyên","output":"Dưới đây là một mã nguồn C đáp ứng yêu cầu của bạn: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <math.h> // Kiểm tra số nguyên tố int isPrime(int num) { if (num < 2) { return 0; } for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(num); i++) { if (num % i == 0) { return 0; } } return 1; } // Kiểm tra số chính phương int isPerfectSquare(int num) { int sqrtNum = sqrt(num); return sqrtNum * sqrtNum == num; } // Kiểm tra số hoàn hảo int isPerfectNumber(int num) { int sum = 1; for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) { if (num % i == 0) { sum += i; if (i * i != num) { sum += num / i; } } } return sum == num; } int main() { int choice; int num; while (1) { printf(\\"n1.

This led to an increase in the content of palmitic acid in abdominal adipose tissue and a lower risk of atherosclerosis. Due to the body's ability to maintain fatty acid homeostasis, the impact of dietary fats and oils on broiler chicken's fatty acid composition, positioning distribution, and carcass production is limited. Compared to animal source saturated fatty acid oils such as Lard, POL and modified POL esters demonstrated a lower tendency for abdominal fat deposition, highlighting their advantage as a source of OPO raw materials. Revised versions: 1. The research findings revealed that POL, when modified through enzymatic methods, exhibited an enhanced content of saturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position. Moreover, this modification led to a reduction in the loss of fatty acid soaps in feces. Consequently, the deposition of palmitic acid in abdominal adipose tissue increased, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. The homeostatic capability of the body limited the influence of dietary fats and oils on the fatty acid composition, positional distribution, and carcass production of broiler chickens. Relative to saturated fatty acid oils derived from animal sources like Lard, POL and modified POL esters displayed a diminished trend in abdominal fat deposition, showcasing their superiority as a source of OPO raw materials. 2. The study results demonstrated that enzymatic modification of POL resulted in an elevation of saturated fatty acid content at the sn-2 position. This modification also minimized the loss of fatty acid soaps in feces, consequently leading to an increase in palmitic acid content in abdominal fat tissue and a reduced risk of atherosclerosis. The body's capacity to maintain fatty acid homeostasis limited the impact of dietary fats and oils on the fatty acid composition, positional distribution, and carcass output of broiler chickens. In comparison to saturated fatty acid oils of animal origin like Lard, POL and modified POL esters displayed a decreased tendency for abdominal fat accumulation, thereby highlighting their advantage as a potential source of OPO raw materials. 3. The research outcomes indicated that the enzymatic modification of POL resulted in an augmentation of the content of saturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position. Additionally, this modification brought about a reduction in the loss of fatty acid soaps in feces. As a result, the accumulation of palmitic acid in abdominal adipose tissue increased, leading to a lower risk of atherosclerosis. The body's ability to maintain fatty acid homeostasis restricted the impact of dietary fats and oils on broiler chicken's fatty acid composition, positional distribution, and carcass production. Compared to animal-derived saturated fatty acid oils such as Lard, POL and modified POL esters exhibited a decreased propensity for abdominal fat deposition, thereby underscoring their advantageous potential as a source of OPO raw materials."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Используй различные обороты речи. Пиши простым языком, добавь пару отрицательных моментов от себя. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Я долго искала новый автомобиль, это была моя мечта, до этого машины у меня не было. Я откладывала деньги и наконец пошла в автосалон. Посмотрела и решила, что не буду сразу совершать покупку, а подумаю, посмотрю еще, так сказать приценюсь. Начала поиски в интернете и нашла ссылку. Продают такой же автомобиль, совершенно новый, только почти на 370 тысяч дешевле. Естественно я тут же связалась с продавцом. Девушка вежливо со мной пообщалась, убедила, что автомобиль новый и действительно стоит дешевле, чем в официальных магазинах. Просто у них сейчас распродажи. Консультант вела себя профессионально, сдержано, на покупке не настаивала, однако всячески заманивала меня приехать. Что я и сделала на следующий день. Машину мне показали, рассказали все ее характеристики, сказали что такой цены не найдешь больше нигде. Я была настолько рада, что сэкономлю такую сумму, что согласилась внести предоплату, даже ни с кем не посоветовавшись. Договор был оформлен очень оперативно, и вот я уже автовладелец. Но не все хорошо в этой истории, после того как я приехала домой, и пригласила друзей отметить покупку настал момент разочарований. Приехал мой друг автослесарь и открыл мне глаза на правду. Моя новая машина оказалась восстановлена, ранее она была бита.","output":"Отзыв 1: Когда-то я прислушивался к мнению других, но вот решил покупать авто самостоятельно. Меня заманили дешевой ценой, и я не смог устоять. В итоге оказалось, что машина, которую я купил, была старьём с пробегом. Вся моя радость пропала, а деньги просто выброшены на ветер. Отзыв 2: Повелся я на обещания продавцов, что у них только качественные автомобили, да ещё и по низким ценам. А как оказалось, это всего лишь замануха для честных покупателей. Моя новая машина начала ломаться уже через несколько дней после покупки. Чинить её мне пришлось за свой счёт, и больше я никогда не доверю этому салону. Отзыв 3: Никогда не думал, что так сильно пожалею о своей покупке. Продавцы в автосалоне красиво всё расписывали, но не сказали об одной важной детали - машина была в аварии. Через неделю после покупки начались проблемы. Мотор жрал масло, двери скрипели, а тормоза вели себя, как на заднике. Я просто растрачиваю время и деньги на неприятности. Отзыв 4: Нельзя доверять каждому, особенно продавцам автомобилей. Увидев в салоне Carlook приглянувшуюся модель, я не рискнул сразу покупать и решил поискать дешевле. И нашёл! Но моё предчувствие не обмануло меня - машина оказалась настоящей грудой железа, подобной тому, что стоит на свалке. Продавцы хочут подсунуть подделку, а я остаюсь сгоряча. Жалею о своей легкомысленности. Отзыв 5: Ну что сказать, переплачивать за новый автомобиль в крупном салоне я больше не буду. Лучше прямо так и написать - продавцы в Carlook навязывают вам свою \\"новую\\" машину, а на самом деле это тряпка на колёсах. У меня только что купленная \\"новенькая\\" машина стала причиной постоянных проблем. А судя по отзывам в интернете, я не одинок.

Management expects difficult macroeconomic dynamics to continue through 4Q23, spearheaded by sluggish global industrial activity. The global manufacturing PMI decreased for the 13th consecutive month in September, and we don’t expect any meaningful relief from that trend in the near term given ongoing destocking trends. In other regions, industrial and consumer demand weakness in the European market and slow Chinese economic recovery are likely to persist well into 2024. DOW reported segment-wide revenue and EBIT declines as a result of the widespread macroeconomic slowness, which tangibly yielded price and volume declines across its business. EBITDA values were up sequentially in both the Performance Coatings and Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure Segments despite local price declines in each due to low feedstock and energy costs. Management reportedly freed 600 mn of cash from working capital expenses on the quarter and credited these and related cost savings initiatives for the observed earnings improvement. 4Q23 sales are expected to come in somewhere between 10.0- 10.5 bn, which indicates a 4.2% sequential decrease at the midpoint of guidance (-13.6% YoY). From a segment perspective, packaging & specialty plastics sequential sales are expected to increase 1.5% at the midpoint of guidance on the back of continued US Gulf coast export strength and declining industry inventory levels. Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment sales are expected to decrease 5% sequentially at the midpoint of guidance due to seasonal volumes declines in building and construction, partially offset by increase in deicing fluid demand.

Instead, they are the result of various processes occurring within Saturn's gravitational field. The formation of Saturn's rings is believed to be linked to the disruption of one or more icy moons or moonlets that once orbited Saturn. These moonlets may have been destroyed due to tidal forces, collisions, or other gravitational interactions with Saturn or its moons. As a result, the debris from these shattered moonlets spread out in a disk-shaped region around Saturn, forming the rings. The rings consist mainly of ice particles ranging in size from tiny grains to large chunks. These particles orbit Saturn in separate rings due to gravitational interactions with nearby moons, which help maintain the ring structure. Additionally, the rings are constantly shifting and evolving due to the gravitational influence of nearby moons and the tidal forces exerted by Saturn. It is important to note that the formation and evolution of Saturn's rings is an ongoing process, and the exact mechanisms responsible for their creation and maintenance are still the subject of scientific research and investigation."},{"instruction":"How do we know how old is Ankor Wat","output":"The age of Angkor Wat, a temple complex in Cambodia, is determined through archaeological and historical evidence. While it is challenging to pinpoint an exact age, experts have used several methods to estimate its age: 1. Inscriptions: Inscriptions found within Angkor Wat provide some information about its construction. These inscriptions indicate that work on the temple complex began during the reign of King Suryavarman II, who ruled from 1113 to 1150 CE. This suggests that at least part of Angkor Wat was constructed during this period. 2. Radiocarbon dating: Archaeologists have used radiocarbon dating techniques to obtain carbon samples from wooden posts in the temple. By analyzing the decay of carbon-14 isotopes, they can estimate the age of these samples. Results from this method suggest that the construction of Angkor Wat may have begun in the 12th century. 3. Architectural and stylistic analysis: Experts examine the architectural techniques, artistic styles, and construction methods used in Angkor Wat to compare them with historical records and known periods. This analysis helps provide a relative timeframe for the temple's construction. 4. Historical records: Historical accounts and records from Chinese, Khmer, and other sources provide some indications about the temple's age. These records may mention the construction or significant events related to Angkor Wat. Combining all these methods and pieces of evidence, historians and archaeologists generally agree that the construction of Angkor Wat started in the 12th century CE, during the reign of King Suryavarman II. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the precise dates can be subject to debate and ongoing research as new findings emerge."},{"instruction":"help me polish sections","output":"I'd be happy to help you polish your sections!

What is Decision Making? What is Complex Decision Making? What is the relationship between judgment, decision-making, and complex decision-making?","output":"Judgment refers to the cognitive process of forming an opinion or drawing conclusions based on available information and personal experiences. It involves evaluating and making assessments about various aspects such as people, situations, or events. Decision-making, on the other hand, is the process of selecting a course of action among several alternatives. It involves analyzing different choices and their potential consequences, assessing risks and benefits, and ultimately making a choice. Complex decision-making refers to the process of making decisions in situations that are characterized by high levels of uncertainty, multiple interrelated factors, and potentially conflicting goals. These situations often require a deeper understanding of the problem, the ability to analyze complex data, and consider multiple perspectives. The relationship between judgment, decision-making, and complex decision-making is that they are all interconnected and integral parts of cognitive processes. Judgment influences decision-making by providing the basis for evaluating different options and determining their potential outcomes. In turn, decision-making relies on judgment to assess the validity and reliability of available information. Complex decision-making utilizes both judgment and decision-making skills to navigate intricate situations that require a higher level of analysis and consideration. Hence, judgment and decision-making are crucial components within the broader context of complex decision-making."},{"instruction":"Write a chapter that clearly explains what is judgment, what is decision making, what is complex decision making and how they are related?","output":"Chapter 1: Understanding Judgment, Decision-Making, and Complex Decision Making Section 1: Introduction In our everyday lives, we are constantly faced with situations that require us to make judgments and decisions. From simple choices like what to wear or what to eat, to more profound decisions like choosing a career path or selecting a life partner, the processes of judgment and decision-making play a crucial role. In this chapter, we will delve into the definitions and concepts of judgment, decision-making, and complex decision-making, and explore how they are interrelated. Section 2: Judgment 2.1 Defining Judgment Judgment is the cognitive process of forming opinions, beliefs, or conclusions based on available information and personal experiences. It involves evaluating and making assessments about people, situations, events, or any other entities that require evaluation. 2.2 Components of Judgment - Perception: The initial step in the judgment process is perceiving and interpreting the information received through our senses. - Evaluation: Once perceived, the information is evaluated based on our beliefs, values, and biases. - Inference: Inferences are made by drawing conclusions or making assumptions based on the evaluated information. - Interpretation: The meaning and significance of the evaluated information are interpreted, taking into account our prior experiences and knowledge. Section 3: Decision-Making 3.1 Defining Decision-Making Decision-making is the process of selecting a course of action among different alternatives. It involves analyzing available options, assessing potential risks and benefits, and making a choice that aligns with our goals and preferences. 3.2 Stages of Decision-Making - Identification of the problem: Recognizing the need for a decision and defining the problem clearly. - Gathering information: Collecting relevant data and information to inform the decision-making process. - Evaluating alternatives: Consider different courses of action, assess their potential outcomes, and weigh the pros and cons. - Making a choice: Selecting the most suitable option based on the analysis and personal judgment. - Implementation: Putting the decision into action and monitoring the outcomes. - Evaluation: Assessing the results and determining if the decision was effective. Section 4: Complex Decision-Making 4.1 Defining Complex Decision-Making Complex decision-making refers to the process of making decisions in situations characterized by high levels of uncertainty, multiple interrelated factors, and potential conflicts. These situations often demand advanced analytical skills, a deep understanding of the problem domain, and the ability to consider multiple perspectives. 4.2 Skills in Complex Decision-Making - Critical thinking: The ability to analyze complex data, identify patterns, and evaluate the validity of information. - Problem-solving: Applying logical and creative approaches to find innovative solutions. - Systems thinking: Understanding the interdependencies and relationships between various factors and considering them while making a decision. - Risk assessment: Assessing potential risks and uncertainties associated with different options. - Emotional intelligence: Recognizing and managing emotions that may influence the decision-making process. Section 5: Relationship between Judgment, Decision-Making, and Complex Decision-Making Judgment and decision-making are closely connected. Judgment provides the foundation for assessing and evaluating alternative options, while decision-making relies on judgment to make informed choices. Complex decision-making expands on these concepts further, incorporating advanced analytical skills and considering a broader range of factors. In complex decision-making, judgment plays a vital role in evaluating and assessing the complexity of the situation and informing the decision-making process. It helps in interpreting and making inferences from the vast amounts of information involved in complex decision-making. Conclusion In this chapter, we have explored the definitions and components of judgment, decision-making, and complex decision-making. We have seen how judgment influences decision-making and how complex decision-making builds upon these concepts. The understanding of these processes is crucial as they form the basis of our ability to navigate and make effective choices in various aspects of our personal and professional lives."},{"instruction":"rewrite, need to use it on the offer of employment: We are delighted to offer you below position at Guangzhou Inspire Academy Kindergarten Co., Ltd..
