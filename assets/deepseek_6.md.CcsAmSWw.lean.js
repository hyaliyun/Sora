This implies that ( f(1) = 1 ) since ( f ) is a function from ( mathbb{Q}_{+}^{*} ) to ( mathbb{Q}_{+}^{*} ). 2. **Show that ( f(xy) = f(x) f(y) )**:      Consider the equation again and set ( x = frac{1}{f(y)} ):    [    fleft(frac{1}{f(y)} f(y)right) = frac{fleft(frac{1}{f(y)}right)}{y}.    ]    Since ( f(f(1)) = f(1) ) and ( f(1) = 1 ), this simplifies to    [    f(1) = frac{fleft(frac{1}{f(y)}right)}{y}.    ]    Thus,    [    1 = frac{fleft(frac{1}{f(y)}right)}{y},    ]    which implies     [    fleft(frac{1}{f(y)}right) = y.    ]    Now set ( z = frac{1}{f(y)} ).

Hence, it suffices to determine the values for ( f ) on prime arguments. 4. **Define ( f ) on primes split into two sets**:      Partition the set of prime numbers ( mathcal{P} ) into two infinite subsets ( {p_1, p_2, ldots } ) and ( {q_1, q_2, ldots } ). Define ( f ) by:    begin{align*}    f(p_i) &= q_i,     f(q_i) &= frac{1}{p_i}.    end{align*}    It is straightforward to check that this satisfies the functional equation:    [    f(x f(y)) = frac{f(x)}{y}.    ]    For example, if ( x = p_i ) and ( y = q_j ), we compute     [    f(p_i f(q_j)) = fleft(p_i cdot frac{1}{p_j}right) = fleft(frac{p_i}{p_j}right),    ]    and since ( frac{p_i}{p_j} ) is a rational number, by the multiplicative nature established in step 2, we get:    [    fleft(frac{p_i}{p_j}right) = frac{f(p_i)}{f(p_j)} = frac{q_i}{f(p_j)}.    ]    Since ( f(p_j) = q_j ), we have:    [    frac{q_i}{q_j} = frac{f(p_i)}{y},    ]    which is consistent with the original equation.

This tiling ensures that the plane is divided into non-overlapping, congruent hexagonal cells. 2. **Calculating the Distance Across a Hexagon:**    Observe that the maximum distance between any two points in a hexagon is the distance between two opposite vertices, known as the diameter of the circumcircle of the hexagon. For a hexagon with side length ( a = 982 ) meters, this diameter ( d ) is given by:    [    d = 2a = 2 times 982 = 1964 text{ meters}    ]     3. **Coloring Strategy:**    Now, we aim to color the hexagons such that any two hexagons sharing the same color are at least 1966 meters apart. Since the diameter of one hexagon is 1964 meters, this guarantees that adjacent hexagons (which share a side) are exactly 982 meters apart. 4. **Ensuring Minimum Distance Between Same-Colored Hexagons:**    To ensure that no two hexagons of the same color are closer than 1966 meters, consider applying a coloring where every color is used in such a pattern that each hexagon is surrounded by a buffer zone of at least two other hexagons of different colors.     By using 9 different colors, we can establish a periodic coloring pattern. One common pattern is the arrangement often called the “distance-3 coloring,” where each hexagon’s neighboring hexagons (those sharing a side) all receive different colors, repeated every distance of 3 hexagons. 5. **Pattern Application and Check:**    - Suppose we denote the colors by ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_9 ).    - Color the hexagons in such a way that each hexagon is surrounded by hexagons of different colors, ensuring that no two hexagons of the same color are adjacent or even two steps away.    - This means at least two rows of hexagons must be of a different color before a repeat color appears. 6. **Verification of Distance:**    Given this arrangement, the closest pair of points within the same-colored hexagons are separated by more than 1964 meters, specifically:    [    sqrt{(3 times 982)^2} = 3 times 982 = 2946 text{ meters}    ]  which satisfies our requirement that any two points of the same color are more than 1966 meters apart. # Conclusion: By tiling the plane with hexagons of 982 meters side length and using 9 colors in a proper distance-3 pattern, we ensure that any two points of the same color are separated by a distance greater than 1966 meters.

For x < 0, we have -x > 0, which implies f(-x) > 1. Now let y=-x, so we get x + y = 0, and by substitution: f(x)f(-x) = f(0) = 1. Hence, 0 < f(x) = frac{1}{f(-x)} < 1.

When women and beauties compete to kick, laughing and playing all day, the craftsmen and scholars are curious to calculate the length of the rope. Translated into modern Chinese, the gist of the problem is: when a swing is stationary, with the footboard one foot off the ground, pushing it forward two steps (in ancient times, one step was considered as five feet) equals 10 feet, making the footboard of the swing the same height as a person. If the rope of the swing is pulled very straight at this point, what is the length of the rope? A: 14 feet B: 14.5 feet C: 15 feet D: 15.5 fee","output":"To solve this problem, we start by letting the length of the rope be x feet. When the swing is pushed forward by 10 feet (since one step is considered as 5 feet and two steps make it 10 feet), the footboard of the swing becomes level with a person who is 5 feet tall. At this point, if the rope is pulled very straight, we can form a right-angled triangle where the base is 10 feet (the distance the swing was pushed), one of the legs is x - 5 + 1 feet (the length of the rope minus the person's height plus the initial 1 foot off the ground), and the hypotenuse is x feet (the length of the rope). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to set up the equation: [10^{2} + (x - 5 + 1)^{2} = x^{2}] Expanding and simplifying the equation: [100 + (x - 4)^{2} = x^{2}] [100 + x^{2} - 8x + 16 = x^{2}] [116 - 8x = 0] Solving for x: [116 = 8x] [x = 14.5] Therefore, the length of the rope is 14.5 feet.

This is because if all angles were strictly less than (90^circ), their sum would be less than (360^circ), which is a contradiction.     - Therefore, at least one of the triangles formed by these four points must have an angle that is at least (90^circ). 2. **Case 2: One point is inside the triangle formed by the other three points.**     - Consider a point (P) inside the triangle formed by points (A), (B), and (C).     - The angles at point (P) (formed by lines (PA), (PB), and (PC)) sum to (360^circ).     - Therefore, at least one of these angles must be greater than or equal to (120^circ).     - This implies at least one angle is greater than or equal to (90^circ).

Since the number must be an integer, it means there must be at least 3 non-acute triangles.     - Consequently, there are at most (7) acute triangles out of (10).     - Thus, the proportion of acute triangles is (frac{7}{10} = 0.7) or (70%). 2. **Induction Step:**     - Assume that the proportion of acute triangles for any (n) points is given by (p_n leq 0.7).     - Now, consider (n+1) points. These points determine (binom{n+1}{3}) triangles.     - Each subset of (n) points forms (binom{n}{3}) triangles.     - There are (n+1) such subsets, so summing the acute triangles, and noting each triangle is counted (n-2) times, we get:       [       p_n cdot binom{n}{3} cdot frac{n+1}{n-2} leq p_n cdot binom{n+1}{3}       ]     - This shows the proportion (p_{n+1}) of acute triangles in the ((n+1)) points is at most (p_n).

Any divisor ( d ) of ( n ) can be written in the form:    [    d = p_{1}^{beta_{1}} p_{2}^{beta_{2}} ldots p_{k}^{beta_{k}}    ]    where ( 0 leq beta_{i} leq alpha_{i} ) for ( i = 1, ldots, k ). 3. By the multiplicative property of Euler's Totient Function (proved in problem 31.7(b)), we have:    [    sum_{d mid n} varphi(d) = left(1 + varphi(p_{1}) + varphi(p_{1}^2) + ldots + varphi(p_{1}^{alpha_{1}})right) cdots left(1 + varphi(p_{k}) + varphi(p_{k}^2) + ldots + varphi(p_{k}^{alpha_{k}})right)    ] 4. After expanding the product on the right side, each term represents the Euler's Totient function of a divisor of ( n ). We need to show that:    [    1 + varphi(p) + varphi(p^2) + ldots + varphi(p^{alpha}) = p^{alpha}    ] 5. We note the pattern in the summation:    [    1 + (p-1) + (p^2 - p) + ldots + (p^{alpha} - p^{alpha-1})    ]    If we separate the terms, we get:    [    begin{aligned}    &1     &+ (p - 1)     &+ (p^2 - p)     &+ (p^3 - p^2)     &vdots     &+ (p^{alpha} - p^{alpha-1})    end{aligned}    ]    Summing these yields:    [    1 + p + p^2 + ldots + p^{alpha} - (0 + 1 + p + ldots + p^{alpha-1}) = p^{alpha}    ] Conclusion: [ boxed{n = sum_{d mid n} varphi(d)} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the sum of all positive integers ( p ) such that the expression ((xp)(x13)+4) can be expressed in the form ((x+q)(x+r)) for distinct integers ( q ) and ( r ).","output":":  Let us consider the given expression (x-p)(x-13) + 4 and express it in the form (x+q)(x+r).

Show that the value of ( BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 ) is independent of the position of point ( P ).   First Solution: 1. **Translation of ( P ) Perpendicularly to ( AB ):**    Let's move point ( P ) in a direction perpendicular to the side ( AB ), arriving at a new point ( Q ). Let the perpendicular projections of ( Q ) onto the sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) be ( Q_1 ), ( Q_2 ), and ( Q_3 ) respectively. 2. **Analysis of Projections ( Q_1, Q_2, Q_3 ):**        Note that ( Q_3 = P_3 ), implying that ( AP_3 ) remains unchanged.        Since ( Q ) is derived from moving ( P ) perpendicularly to ( AB ), the distances ( P_1Q_1 ) and ( P_2Q_2 ) are equal and these distances change in opposite senses such that the total sum ( BP_1 + CP_2 ) does not change.     3. **Invariant Sum:**        As moving ( P ) perpendicularly to a side does not change the total distance sum, by successive perpendicular steps, a combination of these movements can be constructed to move ( P ) to any point inside the triangle without changing ( BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 ).  4. **Special Position Conclusion:**        Observing the triangle’s symmetry and regularity, if point ( P ) is moved to a vertex (for example ( A )), ( P_3 ) would coincide with the midpoint of ( BC ). Since ( P ) is at the vertex ( A ), ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) each reach their respective edge projections. Finally, in the case of vertex positioning: [ BP_1 = CP_2 = frac{a}{2}, quad text{and} quad AP_3 = a ] Thus, we add these distances up: [ BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 = frac{a}{2} + frac{a}{2} + a = 2a ] Given the configuration, it becomes clear: [ BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 = a ] Observing symmetry and applying same logic: [ BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 = boxed{frac{3}{2}a} ] Hence we conclude, the sum ( BP_1 + CP_2 + AP_3 ) remains invariant independently moving within the triangle ( ABC )."},{"instruction":"Elsa gets 500 MB of cell phone data each month.

The proposition claims that after one step, the obtained pieces will each have a mass smaller than frac{2}{2} = 1 times the mass of the original chocolate. We choose the original chocolate's mass as the unit mass.     - In the first step, the largest piece is divided, and as per the problem’s condition, the result will be at least two pieces each with a mass not exceeding half of the original piece's mass.          Hence, after the first step, every resulting piece has a mass of at most frac{1}{2} of the original chocolate's mass, which is less than 1 unit mass.    Therefore, for k=1, the statement holds true. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume that the statement is true for all k < m, i.e., after k steps, every piece of chocolate has a mass less than frac{2}{k+1} times the original mass. 3. **Inductive Step:**    We need to show that the statement holds for k=m.    **Case 1: m=2r+1 (odd)**    - Consider the situation after r steps. According to the induction hypothesis, after r steps, all obtained pieces have a mass of less than frac{2}{r+1} times the original mass.    - From this point, further divisions have to respect the rule that the new pieces must be smaller than half of the divided piece's mass.      Thus, each resulting piece from step r+1 onwards will have a mass smaller than frac{1}{r+1} of the original mass.      - Suppose there are s pieces each with a mass of at least frac{1}{r+1} after r steps.      - During the next s steps, each piece must be subdivided, resulting in each new piece having a mass of less than frac{1}{r+1}.      - Clearly, since these are the largest pieces, and all subsequent pieces will be smaller.      Consequently, after s+r steps, there will be no pieces larger than frac{1}{r+1} remaining.    - Since s leq r+1 (if we had s geq r+2, the total mass would exceed 1, which is impossible), the required steps s+r leq 2r+1 = m ensures that:      [      text{After m steps} implies text{mass of each piece} < frac{2}{m+1}      ]          **Case 2: m=2r (even)**    - In this case, we consider the mass being smaller than frac{1}{r+1}. We need to show that pieces smaller than frac{1}{r+1} can be broken down to less than frac{2}{m+1}.    - For pieces larger than frac{1}{r+1} after r steps, we must ensure that their number cannot exceed r (otherwise their combined mass would surpass 1, which is impossible).    - Thus, within the next r steps, the largest pieces must break down into pieces each less than frac{1}{r+1}.    Hence, at most after the 2r steps, all resulting pieces will be smaller than frac{2}{m+1}. 4. **Conclusion:**        By mathematical induction, the proposition holds true for every k geq 1.

We find the derivative of f(x) to determine its monotonicity: [f'(x) = frac{1}{1+x} - frac{1}{(1+x)^2} = frac{x}{(1+x)^2}.] Since x in (0,1), it's clear that f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (0,1). Therefore, for any x in (0,1), we have f(x) > f(0) = 0, which implies ln(1+x) > frac{x}{1+x}. Specifically, for x=0.01, we get ln(1.01) > frac{1}{101}, which means a > b. 2. **Comparing c and a:** Next, we define another function g(x) = sin x - ln(1+x), where x in (0,1), and find its derivative: [g'(x) = cos x - frac{1}{1+x}.] To further analyze g'(x), we define h(x) = g'(x) = cos x - frac{1}{1+x} and find its derivative: [h'(x) = -sin x + frac{1}{(1+x)^2}.] Examining h'(x), we note that it decreases in the interval (0,1). At x=0, h'(0) = 1 > 0, and at x=1, h'(1) = -sin 1 + frac{1}{4} < -sinfrac{pi}{6} + frac{1}{4} < 0. Thus, there exists an x_0 in (0,1) where h'(x_0) = 0. This indicates that h(x), and consequently g'(x), increases for x in (0, x_0) and decreases for x in (x_0, 1). The minimum value of h(x) is either at h(0) = 0 or h(1) > 0, implying h(x) > 0 for all x in (0,1). Therefore, g(x) is monotonically increasing in (0,1), and g(x) > g(0) = 0, which means sin x > ln(1+x). Specifically, for x=0.01, sin 0.01 > ln(1.01), indicating c > a.

Here is the detailed solution: 1. **Dimensions and Density**:    - The railroad platform has a rectangular base with a length of ( 10 ) meters and a width of ( 5 ) meters.    - The density of the grain is given as ( 1200 , text{kg/m}^3 ). 2. **Height Calculation (Given Angle of Repose)**:    - The maximum angle at which the grain will come to rest without sliding (the angle of repose) is ( 45 ) degrees.    - The height ( h ) of the pile will therefore be half of the width of the platform because the maximum slope forms a right-angled triangle where the height and half the width are the legs of a ( 45^circ ) angle. Thus, ( h = frac{5}{2} = 2.5 ) meters. 3. **Volume Calculation**:    - The pile of grain can geometrically be broken down into simpler shapes. Specifically, it can be divided into:      - A rectangular prism on which the grain rests horizontally along the length of the platform.      - Two identical pyramids at each of the narrow ends of the platform.          - **Volume of the Rectangular Prism**:      - Base dimensions: ( 10 ) meters by ( 5 ) meters.      - Height: ( 2.5 ) meters.      - Calculating the volume gives:        [        V_{text{prism}} = text{Base Area} times text{Height} = 5 times 2.5 times 10 = 125 , text{m}^3        ]    - **Volume of Each Pyramid**:      - Base of the pyramid: ( 5 times 2.5 ) meters.      - Height: ( 2.5 ) meters.      - The volume of one pyramid is given by:        [        V_{text{pyramid}} = frac{1}{3} times left(5 times 2.5right) times 2.5 = frac{1}{3} times 12.5 times 2.5 = frac{1}{3} times 31.25 = 10.4167 , text{m}^3        ]      - Since there are two pyramids:        [        V_{text{pyramids}} = 2 times 10.4167 = 20.8333 , text{m}^3        ]    - **Total Volume**:      - Summing up the volumes of the prism and the pyramids, we get:        [        V_{text{total}} = V_{text{prism}} + V_{text{pyramids}} = 125 + 20.8333 = 145.8333 , text{m}^3        ] 4. **Mass Calculation**:    - Using the grain density to find the mass:      [      text{Mass} = text{Volume} times text{Density} = 145.8333 times 1200 = 174999.96 approx 175000 , text{kg}      ]    - Converting to tonnes:      [      175000 , text{kg} = 175 , text{tonnes}      ] # Conclusion: The maximum mass of the grain that can be loaded onto the platform is: [ boxed{62.5 , text{tonnes}} ]"},{"instruction":"f |x2|=p, where x>2, then what is xp in terms of p?","output":"Given the condition x>2, the equation |x-2|=p simplifies to x-2=p because x-2 is positive when x>2. 1.

At age 13, Bobby can deadlift 300 pounds. 250% of his previous deadlift (at age 13) would be: 250% of 300 pounds = 2.5 * 300 pounds = 750 pounds At age 18, he can deadlift 100 pounds more than that, so: 750 pounds + 100 pounds = 850 pounds Now, let's find out how many pounds he added per year from age 13 to age 18.

Here ( A_{11}=A_{1} ). Find the number of looping paths in this array.","output":"Let's break down the problem and solution into detailed steps to understand how we arrive at the answer. 1. **Understanding the Problem**:        We have a unit triangular array of 10 points, arranged in such a way that there are 4 points on each side. The goal is to determine the number of looping paths. A looping path is a sequence ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{10} ) where each point is visited exactly once, and ( A_{i} ) is adjacent to ( A_{i+1} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 10 ), with ( A_{11} = A_1 ). 2. **Graph Representation**:        Imagine each point in the triangular array as vertices in a graph, and edges connect adjacent vertices. The arrangement of the points can be visualized as below, with common numbering of vertices:        \`\`\`      1     /     2---3   /  /   4---5---6 /  /  /  7---8---9---10    \`\`\` 3. **Counting Sequences and Loops**:        We are interested in sequences that visit all 10 points and return to the starting point, thereby forming a closed loop. Analyze the implications:    - Each valid sequence can be thought of as a unique permutation of the 10 points with the additional constraint that each consecutive pair in the permutation is an adjacent pair in the graph. 4. **Adjacency Constraints**:        Because each ( A_i ) must be adjacent to ( A_{i+1} ), the sequence effectively traces a path along the edges of the graph. This means the path forms a type of Hamiltonian cycle (a cycle visiting each vertex exactly once). 5. **Corners and Edges**:        Consider the three corners of the array (points 1, 4, and 10):        - The path must enter and exit from these points in a specific manner to return to the start point and form a closed loop. 6. **Counting the Loops**:        From the triangular structure, there are exactly 3 distinct Hamiltonian cycles possible due to the fixed structure and adjacency constraints. These loops can intuitively be described as \\"V-shapes\\" spanning the corners.    Here is an illustration of possible sequences:        - Corner-focused loops form 3 unique sequences. 7. **Account for Rotations and Reflections**:        Each unique path can be travelled starting from any of the 10 points, and each path can be traversed in two directions (clockwise and counterclockwise).    - Thus, each Hamiltonian cycle is counted multiple times in this counting process. 8. **Final Calculation**:        Given 3 Hamiltonian cycles, for any starting point and direction, the number of such sequences will thus be:        [    10 times 2 times 3 = 60    ]    This calculation recognizes the cyclic nature of the paths and covers all possible start points and traversal directions. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{60} ]"},{"instruction":"Koalas absorb only (30%) of the fiber they eat.

These scenarios are mutually exclusive from a draw.  Let P(text{Ming not losing}) denote the probability that Xiao Ming does not lose and P(text{Dong losing}) denote the probability that Xiao Dong loses. The probability of a draw can then be computed by considering the probability that Xiao Ming does not lose but Xiao Dong doesn't lose either (he could win or draw).

To ensure that there is a congruence class modulo ( m ) that ( P(x) ) does not assume, we need to find an ( m ) such that there is an overlap in these values ( P(0), P(1), ldots, P(m-1) ) modulo ( m ). 5. **Analysis by reduction to specific cases:**    For degree 10 polynomial ( P(x) ), consider the polynomial's behavior modulo ( m ):    [    P pmod{m} quadtext{can be expressed by the values}quad P(0), P(1), ldots, P(m-1)    ]    Since there are ( m ) values modulo ( m ), and ( P(a) notequiv P(b) pmod{m} ) implies ( a equiv b pmod{m} ), we need to show that there exists ( m ) such that two of these ( P(i) )'s are congruent modulo ( m ). 6. **Choose a specific value for ( m ):**    For each positive integer ( k ), consider the differences ( a_k = P(k) - P(0) ):    [    P(k) = P(0) + a_k cdot k quad text{for some integer} quad a_k    ]    - If ( a_k = 0 ) for some ( k ), then ( m = k + 1 ) can be chosen, making ( P(0) equiv P(k) pmod{m} ).    - If ( |a_k| = 1 ) for all ( k ), this would imply that ( P(x) / x ) is bounded, hence ( P ) being linear, which contradicts our assumption of ( P ) being of degree 10.    - If ( |a_k| geq 2 ) for some ( k ), set ( m = a_k cdot k > k ). The values ( P(0) ) and ( P(k) ) are then congruent modulo ( m ).    Thus, for this choice of ( m ), there is at least one residue class modulo ( m ) which is omitted by ( P(x) ). 7. **Conclusion:**    We have shown that there always exists an ( m ) such that a congruence class modulo ( m ) is omitted by the polynomial ( P(x) ).

The general formula for the eccentricity e of an ellipse with equation frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 is e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}}. If m=4, we can identify that a^2=m=4 and b^2=1. Hence, the eccentricity e of the ellipse is:  e = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{4}} = sqrt{frac{3}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}  Proposition P is a true statement. The converse of proposition P is: \\"If the eccentricity of ellipse C is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, then m=4\\".

Extending this to all integers, if we believe such a contradiction, then f(n, m) remains constant across the entire domain, contrary to the fundamental working assumption.           - Hence, there must be values n and m where the function f(n, m) takes values greater than k, and similarly for values less than k.

This is a truncated cube (a cube with its vertices cut off). In a truncated cube, each vertex of the original cube is replaced by an equilateral triangle.    - Each edge of the truncated cube is shared between one triangle and one square. 2. **Estimate the number of vertices and edges:**    - A cube originally has 8 vertices and 12 edges.    - When the cube is truncated, each of the 8 vertices of the cube is cut off, creating a new triangular face.    - This also introduces 3 new edges for each vertex cut off, adding a total of (8 times 3 = 24) new edges.    - But these 24 edges form shared boundaries between the new triangles and the existing squares; hence each edge now is counted for its shared presence.    Hence, the total number of edges becomes 24. 3. **Calculate dihedral angles:**    - Since all dihedral angles between the triangles and squares are equal and all faces are regular, the polyhedron must be semiregular.    - By cutting off the corners of the cube to form equilateral triangles, all dihedral angles formed by the intersection of a square face and a triangular face are equivalent, which also helps in simplifying our calculations. 4. **Volume calculations:**    - Let’s denote:      - The side length of the original cube as (a),      - The side length of the truncated cube (from triangle to square) as (b).

So, if we denote the number of tickets sold to the action movie as A, we have: A = 2R Substituting the value of R, we get: A = 2(25) A = 50 So, 50 tickets were sold to the action movie. 3. For every four tickets sold to the comedy movie, five tickets were sold to the horror movie. This implies a ratio of comedy tickets (C) to horror tickets (H) of 4:5. We can write this as: C/H = 4/5 We already know H = 93, so we can solve for C: C = (4/5) * H C = (4/5) * 93 C = 372/5 C = 74.4 Since we cannot sell a fraction of a ticket, we should round to the nearest whole number. However, the ratio given implies that the number of comedy tickets must be a whole number that, when multiplied by 5, gives a whole number of horror tickets. Since we know the number of horror tickets is 93, which is a multiple of 5, the number of comedy tickets must be a whole number that, when multiplied by 4, gives a number that is one less than a multiple of 5. The closest whole number to 74.4 that satisfies this condition is 74 (because 74*4 = 296, which is one less than 297, a multiple of 5). So, 74 tickets were sold to the comedy movie.

C can finish the work in 20 days, so C's work per day is 1/20 of the total work. Now, let's find out the total work done by A, B, and C when they work together in one day. Total work per day = A's work per day + B's work per day + C's work per day Total work per day = (1/10) + (1/15) + (1/20) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 15, and 20 is 60. Total work per day = (6/60) + (4/60) + (3/60) Total work per day = (6 + 4 + 3) / 60 Total work per day = 13/60 This means that together, A, B, and C can complete 13/60 of the work in one day.

To show that there exists a vertex in mathcal{G} with a degree not exceeding 5, we will use some fundamental results from graph theory. 2. Recall Euler's formula for planar graphs:        V - E + F = 2,        where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. 3. Count the total edge-face incidences. Each face of the graph has at least 3 sides (since the graph is planar), and each edge is shared by exactly 2 faces. This gives the inequality:    [    3F leq 2E quad text{or equivalently} quad 2E geq 3F.    ] 4. Using Euler's formula, we express F in terms of V and E:    [    F = E - V + 2.    ] 5.

Suppose, to the contrary, that every vertex in mathcal{G} has a degree of at least 6. Thus:    [    sum_{v in mathcal{G}} deg(v) geq 6V.    ]    Therefore:    [    2E geq 6V.    ]    Simplifying this inequality, we get:    [    E geq 3V.    ] 8.

Define:      [      A = { i mid 1 leq i leq n, , x_i > r }, quad B = { j mid 1 leq j leq n, , y_j > r }      ]      Let ( alpha = |A| ) and ( beta = |B| ). 5. **Comparing counts using ( z_{i+j} ):**    If ( x_i > r ) and ( y_j > r ), it follows:    [    z_{i+j} geq sqrt{x_i y_j} > sqrt{r cdot r} = r    ]    Define:    [    C = { k mid 2 leq k leq 2n, , z_k > r }    ]    Observing that:    [    A + B = { alpha + beta mid alpha in A, beta in B }    ]    and knowing:    [    |A+B| geq |A| + |B| - 1 = alpha + beta - 1    ] 6. **Implication on counts:**    Therefore, at least ( alpha + beta - 1 ) elements of ( { z_2, z_3, ldots, z_{2n} } ) are greater than ( r ). Moreover, if ( alpha + beta ) elements are greater than ( r ), at least ( alpha + beta ) elements on the left-hand side ( M + z_2 + z_3 + cdots + z_{2n} ) will be greater than ( r ). 7. **Conclusion:**    This comparison shows that the left-hand side in our inequality:    [    M + z_2 + z_3 + cdots + z_{2n}    ]    has at least as many terms greater than any ( r ) as the right-hand side:    [    x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n + y_1 + y_2 + cdots + y_n    ]    Therefore, we conclude that:    [    M + z_2 + cdots + z_{2n} geq x_1 + cdots + x_n + y_1 + cdots + y_n    ]    from which the desired inequality follows by the AM-GM inequality.

Firstly, let's rewrite the given equation to exploit it for our purposes: [ frac{1}{a}+frac{9}{b}=1 ] Multiplying both sides of this equation by ab (assuming a, b > 0 so ab neq 0), we obtain: [ b + 9a = ab ] This transformation allows us to express a+b in terms of a and b in a useful way: [ a+b = (a+b)left(frac{1}{a}+frac{9}{b}right) = frac{a}{a} + frac{9a}{b} + frac{b}{a} + frac{9b}{b} ] Given frac{1}{a}+frac{9}{b}=1, the above simplifies to: [ a+b = 10 + frac{b}{a} + frac{9a}{b} ] Using the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any positive numbers x and y, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean (frac{x+y}{2} geq sqrt{xy}), we can apply it to frac{b}{a} + frac{9a}{b}: [ frac{frac{b}{a} + frac{9a}{b}}{2} geq sqrt{frac{b}{a} cdot frac{9a}{b}} ] Simplifying, we find: [ frac{b}{a} + frac{9a}{b} geq 2sqrt{frac{b}{a} cdot frac{9a}{b}} = 2sqrt{9} = 6 ] Therefore, adding this to 10 obtained from our expression for a+b, we have: [ a+b geq 10 + 6 = 16 ] Equality holds when frac{b}{a} = frac{9a}{b}, or equivalently when b^2 = 9a^2, which implies b = 3a. Substituting back into our original equation frac{1}{a}+frac{9}{b}=1 gives b = 12 and a = 4, thus verifying the condition for equality.

Question: What is the area of the shaded triangle?","output":"Given a large square (ABCD) with an area of 1, and points on its sides being the midpoints, we aim to find the area of the shaded triangle. Let's dissect this problem step-by-step: 1. **Define the relevant properties and dimensions:**      The given large square (ABCD) has an area of 1. Therefore, the side length (s) of this square satisfies:    [    s^2 = 1 implies s = 1    ]    The midpoints on each side of the square divide each side into two segments of length (frac{s}{2}). 2. **Identify and calculate inner squares:**    - We place a smaller square within (ABCD) by connecting the midpoints of (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA). This smaller square will have vertices marking the midpoints.    - When connecting these midpoints, the resulting smaller square has side lengths reduced by a factor of (sqrt{2}) (half the diagonal of the smaller square) of the original large square.

We need to partition them into 4 groups such that no two people from the same country and no two neighbors are in the same group. 2. **Reduction to a Known Problem**:    Consider a known result: If there are 100 people from 50 countries (2 people from each country) arranged in a circle, we can partition them into 2 groups of 50 each such that no three consecutive people are in the same group, and no two people from the same country are in the same group. 3. **Transforming the Problem**:    Each country ( C ) has 4 members, say ( C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4 ). We can treat ( C_3 ) and ( C_4 ) as members of another country. This gives us 2 representatives from 50 different countries. 4. **Applying the Known Result**:    By the known result, we can partition these 100 people into 2 groups of 50 each such that no three consecutive people are in the same group, and no two representatives from the same country are in the same group. 5. **Graph Construction**:    Consider the first of these groups and construct a graph where:    - Vertices represent the members of the first group.    - An edge ( v leftrightarrow_1 w ) exists if ( v ) and ( w ) are adjacent on the circle.    - An edge ( v leftrightarrow_2 w ) exists if ( v ) and ( w ) are from the same country. 6. **Graph Properties**:    The previous result implies that for any vertex ( v ), its degree with respect to ( 1 )-edges and ( 2 )-edges is at most 1.

Each color class will contain precisely one member from each country. 8. **Repeating for the Second Group**:    Apply the same process to the second group of 50 people.

Since angle OMP = angle ONP = 90^circ (both are right angles because OM and ON are perpendicular to the chords), and OM = ON (perpendiculars from the center to equal chords), and they share the common side OP:    - triangle POM cong triangle PON by the hypotenuse-leg (HL) theorem.     4. **Equality of segments on the extensions:**    By the congruence of these triangles, the corresponding parts are equal:    [    PM = PN    ] 5. **Equality of segments PA and PD:**    Considering that M and N are the midpoints of AB and CD respectively:    [    PA = PM + MA = PM + frac{1}{2} AB = PN + frac{1}{2} CD = PN + ND = PD    ]    Hence, we have:    [    PA = PD    ]    Therefore, triangle APD is isosceles. 6. **Equality of segments PB and PC:**    Similarly, we analyze the collinear segments beyond points B and C:    [    PB = PA - AB = PD - CD = PC    ]    Hence, we have:    [    PB = PC    ]    Therefore, triangle BPC is isosceles. # Conclusion: Combining these results, both triangle APD and triangle BPC are isosceles triangles.

Next, let T_n be the set of rational points in S_n. 3. **Closure and irrational points:**    The closure of T_n is the interval S_n, which contains irrational points. This implies that there must be points in T_n which are not included in A_n (since A_n only contains rationals, and S_n as a whole contains irrational points).    Let x_n be one such rational point in T_n that is not in A_n. 4. **Construct a new set {x_n}:**    Consider the set {x_n}. The only limit point of this set is 0, as the intervals S_n shrink towards 0 and x_n in S_n. 5. **Define compact set K:**    Define K = {x_n} cup {0}. This set is compact because it includes a sequence converging to 0 and the limit point 0 itself, making it a closed and bounded set. 6. **Contradiction:**    The compact set K must be contained in some A_m since we assumed that any compact set of rationals is a subset of some A_n. However, K contains x_n for each n, and by construction, x_n notin A_n for each n.    Therefore, K cannot be contained in any A_n, because for each n there is an element (x_n) in K that is not in A_n. This contradiction shows that our assumption is false. **Conclusion:** [boxed{text{It is not possible to find such compact sets } A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots, text{ with the given properties.}}]"},{"instruction":"w many real numbers ( a ) make the equation ( x^{2} + a x + 6a = 0 ) have only integer solutions?","output":"1.

Prove that no other point besides point ( O ) has this property.","output":"**Step 1:** Given a convex polygon ( A_1 A_2 ldots A_n ), we have a point ( O ) inside the polygon such that any line segment ( O A_i ) contains another vertex ( A_j ). This indicates that for each vertex ( A_i ), there exists a corresponding vertex ( A_j ) such that ( O ) lies on ( A_i A_j ). **Step 2:** Since each ( O A_i ) line contains another vertex ( A_j ), the vertices of the polygon can be paired up such that lines ( A_i A_j ) pass through ( O ). These lines are diagonals of the polygon passing through the common point ( O ). **Step 3:** Because each pair of vertices ((A_i, A_j)) is connected by a diagonal passing through ( O ), the total number of vertices ( n ) must be even. This is because splitting ( n ) vertices into pairs leaves no vertex unpaired, ensuring each diagonal pairs exactly two vertices. **Step 4:** In an even-sided polygon, if vertices are paired as described, there must be ( m ) such pairs, where ( m ) is half of the total number of vertices ( n ) (( m = frac{n}{2} )). **Step 5:** For each diagonal ( A_i A_j ) passing through ( O ), there must be an equal number of vertices on either side of the diagonal. This symmetric configuration is only possible if ( O ) is positioned at the unique intersection point of all these diagonals within the polygon. **Step 6:** Therefore, ( O ) is the intersection point of all diagonals linking pairs of opposite vertices. This point must naturally divide the polygon into two equal parts on each diagonal, which means ( O ) is the unique central point where all diagonals intersect. **Step 7:** The property that any line ( O A_i ) contains another vertex ( A_j ) cannot be satisfied by any other point except ( O ). This is because ( O ) is the only point ensuring that any diagonal ( A_i A_j ) includes exactly two vertices divided by ( O ). **Conclusion:** Thus, ( O ) is the only point inside the convex polygon with the stated property, where each vertex is part of a diagonal passing through ( O ).

Since, taking the square root is equivalent to raising the expression to the power of frac {1}{2}, this part simplifies to frac {3}{2}. The next part, left(frac {1}{10}right)^{-2}, is the reciprocal of left(frac {1}{10}right)^2, which simplifies to 100. pi^{0} always equals 1, regardless of the value of pi, since any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1. For left(- frac {27}{8}right)^{ frac {1}{3}}, since it is a cube root, we are looking for a number that, when cubed, equals - frac {27}{8}. This number is - frac {3}{2}.

Here, log_{2}9 becomes frac {lg 9}{lg 2} and log_{3}2 becomes frac {lg 2}{lg 3}. Since lg 9 = lg 3^2 = 2lg 3 after simplification, our expression becomes -2 times frac {lg 3}{lg 2} times frac {lg 2}{lg 3}. This simplifies to -2 because the lg 3 and lg 2 terms cancel each other out in the fraction. Therefore, adding lg 5 to lg 2 gives us lg 10, which has a value of 1, since 10 is the base of the common logarithm. Subtracting 2 from 1 gives us -1.

Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 12.5 m/s * 30 s Distance = 375 meters This distance is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge it crosses. Since we know the length of the train is 130 meters, we can find the length of the bridge by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance.

Therefore, A+B > 180^circ, which is a contradiction.   Hence, angle A must be acute,   And since sin A= frac {5}{13} < frac {1}{2} and frac { sqrt {3}}{2} > cos B= frac {3}{5} > frac {1}{2},   We can deduce 0 < A < 30^circ < B < 60^circ and also cos A= frac {12}{13}, sin B= frac {4}{5}.   Therefore, angle C is obtuse,   So side c is the longest with a length of 63, which makes side a the shortest,   Using the sine of the sum of two angles formula, we have sin C=sin (A+B)=sin Acos B+cos Asin B= frac {5}{13} cdot frac {3}{5}+ frac {12}{13} cdot frac {4}{5}= frac {63}{65}.   By the Law of Sines, frac {a}{sin A} = frac {c}{sin C},   Thus, a = frac {63}{ frac {63}{65}} cdot frac {5}{13}=boxed{25}. Hence, the length of the shortest side a is 25.   The approach involved deducing the range of angles based on their trigonometric values, discussing the cases to conclude that angle A is acute, and subsequently applying the sine sum formula to find sin C. The Law of Sines then provides a, allowing us to solve the problem.

Calculate the banker's discount.","output":"To calculate the banker's discount, we first need to understand the concept of banker's gain. Banker's gain (BG) is the difference between the banker's discount (BD) and the true discount (TD). The formula for banker's gain is: BG = BD - TD Given that the banker's gain is Rs. 150, we can express the banker's discount as: BD = BG + TD We also know that the true discount is the present value of the debt, which can be calculated using the compound interest formula. Let's denote the sum due 5 years hence as S, the rate of interest as r (12% per annum), and the time as t (5 years). The present value (PV), which is the true discount, can be calculated as: PV = S / (1 + r)^t We don't know the sum S, but we can express the true discount in terms of S: TD = S / (1 + 0.12)^5 Now, we need to find the relationship between the banker's discount and the true discount. The banker's discount is the simple interest on the face value (S) of the debt for the unexpired time (t) at the rate of interest (r). The formula for simple interest (SI) is: SI = P * r * t / 100 Where P is the principal amount (which is the sum S in this case). The banker's discount can be expressed as: BD = S * 0.12 * 5 Now, we have the banker's gain in terms of S: BG = BD - TD 150 = (S * 0.12 * 5) - (S / (1 + 0.12)^5) Let's solve for S: 150 = (0.6 * S) - (S / (1.12)^5) Now, we need to calculate (1.12)^5: (1.12)^5 = 1.762341888 So, the equation becomes: 150 = (0.6 * S) - (S / 1.762341888) Let's find a common denominator and solve for S: 150 = (0.6 * S * 1.762341888) - S 150 = (1.057405133 * S) - S 150 = 0.057405133 * S Now, we can solve for S: S = 150 / 0.057405133 S ≈ 2613.42 Now that we have the value of S, we can calculate the banker's discount (BD): BD = S * 0.12 * 5 BD = 2613.42 * 0.12 * 5 BD ≈ 1576.05 Therefore, the banker's discount is approximately Rs. boxed{1576.05} ."},{"instruction":"f the line 2mx+y+6=0 is parallel to the line (m3)xy+7=0, then the value of m is (　　) A: 1 B: 1 C: 1 or 1 D: 3","output":"Since the two lines are parallel, we have: frac{2m}{m-3} = frac{1}{-1} neq frac{6}{7}   Solving this, we get m=1.

In a convex polyhedron, each face must have at least 3 sides (since the minimum polygon is a triangle) and can have at most ( n-1 ) sides (if all other ( n-1 ) faces formed one combined face, which is an extreme but theoretically possible case).

The clique number ( omega(G) ) of a graph ( G ) is the size of the largest complete subgraph (clique) in ( G ). 4. **Conclusion**:    - The minimum number of colors required is the clique number ( omega(G) ) of the graph ( G ).

For the first type of goods: - The merchant marks up the goods by 45%, so the new price is 100 + (100 * 0.45) = 100 + 45 = 145. - Then the merchant offers a discount of 15% on the marked price, so the discount is 145 * 0.15 = 21.75. - The final selling price after the discount is 145 - 21.75 = 123.25. For the second type of goods: - The merchant marks up the goods by 75%, so the new price is 100 + (100 * 0.75) = 100 + 75 = 175. - Then the merchant offers a discount of 30% on the marked price, so the discount is 175 * 0.30 = 52.50. - The final selling price after the discount is 175 - 52.50 = 122.50. Now, let's calculate the total cost, total selling price, and profit: Total cost for both types of goods = 100 (first type) + 100 (second type) = 200. Total selling price for both types of goods = 123.25 (first type) + 122.50 (second type) = 245.75. Total profit = Total selling price - Total cost = 245.75 - 200 = 45.75. To find the overall percentage profit, we use the formula: Percentage Profit = (Total Profit / Total Cost) * 100 Percentage Profit = (45.75 / 200) * 100 = 0.22875 * 100 = 22.875%.

This can happen in two cases:    - The origin lies on one of the sides of the triangle.    - The origin lies outside the triangle.    To minimize the number of non-fat triangles, we need to consider the configuration of points.

To keep their food bill the same, the Sims family will need to consume less food such that the increased price does not affect their total expenditure. Let's assume the current cost of their food bill is X. After a 50% increase, the new price for the same amount of food would be 1.5 * X. To keep the cost the same, they would need to spend X on food, not 1.5 * X. To find out how much they need to reduce their consumption, we can set up the following equation: New Consumption * (1.5 * Current Price) = Current Consumption * Current Price Let's denote New Consumption as C_new and Current Consumption as C_current. We know that C_current * Current Price = X (their current food bill). So, we have: C_new * (1.5 * Current Price) = C_current * Current Price Dividing both sides by Current Price, we get: C_new * 1.5 = C_current Now, we want to find C_new, so we divide both sides by 1.5: C_new = C_current / 1.5 This means that the Sims family will have to reduce their consumption to 2/3 (or about 66.67%) of their current consumption to keep their food bill the same after a 50% price increase.  In terms of percentage reduction: Reduction Percentage = (1 - (C_current / 1.5) / C_current) * 100 Reduction Percentage = (1 - 2/3) * 100 Reduction Percentage = (1/3) * 100 Reduction Percentage = 33.33% So, the Sims family will need to reduce their food consumption by approximately boxed{33.33%}  to keep their food bill the same after the price increase."},{"instruction":"Rose is an aspiring artist.

To show this, first consider the homothety centered at G with a ratio of -frac{1}{2}. The reason we're considering this homothety is that it maps lines into lines and scales segments by -frac{1}{2}. Specifically, under this homothety, point P will be mapped to a point Q such that P G : G Q = 2 : 1. 4. Recall a property of the nine-point circle: it is the image of the circumcircle under the homothety centered at the orthocenter H with a coefficient of -frac{1}{2}.

How many red beads can there be in this necklace?

We know from the problem statement that the necklace is cyclic, meaning the last bead neighbors the first bead.  Additionally, every blue bead has two red beads on either side, and every red bead is not immediately next to another red bead, meaning there must be at least one bead of a different color between any two red beads.  Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Establish Fundamental Requirements:**     - Since each blue bead has two beads of other colors directly next to it, it implies that blue beads cannot be directly next to each other but must be separated by at least one red bead.     - Let's denote blue beads as ( B ) and red beads as ( R ). 2. **Setting Up the Necklace:**     - Consider a segment of the necklace: ( text{B R ... R B} ), where at least one ( R ) must exist between every ( B ). By the problem's restriction, around each ( B ), there should be red beads separating blue beads.      3. **Finding the Pattern:**     - Let's denote the number of red beads between any two blue beads as ( n ).     - Suppose there are 4 red beads between each two blue beads to ensure the constraints are met. So, each pattern segment is ( B R R R R B ). 4. **Total Red Beads Calculation:**     - Since there are 30 blue beads, assume each blue is separated by 4 red beads (as estimated). Thus, each pair of blue beads encloses 4 red beads.     - As the necklace is closed in a cycle, this pattern continually works without violating any conditions. 5. **Red Beads in the Necklace:**     - Thus 30 blue beads require ( 30 times 4 = 120 ) beads, but remember they all share beads except in overlaps so reduce amount by a factor:     - Since ( n = 4 ), and there are ( 30 ) pairs, simply adding all separations grants the solution:     - Total Reds ( text{T} = 4 times (30) ); however assuming overlap which actually varies finding merely no overlaps granting ( 2b ):     - Each blue bead thus argues formally ( 120-60=60 , R ); Thus, the exact configurational modeling drives the pattern allocation consistently revealing the result accounting overlaps noting: Hence, it determines n=4.

So, we can convert the gallons of water to be removed into cubic feet: 1875 gallons * (1 cubic foot / 7.48052 gallons) = 250.66 cubic feet (rounded to two decimal places) Next, we know that the water level is to be lowered by 6 inches, which is equivalent to 0.5 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot). The volume of water to be removed is the product of the area of the pool's surface and the depth by which the water level is to be lowered: Volume = Length * Width * Height We know the volume (250.66 cubic feet), the length (20 feet), and the height (0.5 feet), so we can solve for the width: 250.66 cubic feet = 20 feet * Width * 0.5 feet Now, we solve for the width: Width = 250.66 cubic feet / (20 feet * 0.5 feet) Width = 250.66 cubic feet / 10 cubic feet Width = 25.066 feet Therefore, the width of the swimming pool is approximately boxed{25.066}  feet."},{"instruction":"The polynomial x^{12}  1 is factored as [ x^{12}  1 = q_1(x) q_2(x) dotsm q_m(x), ] where each factor q_i(x) is a nonconstant polynomial with real coefficients.

How many such planes alpha are there in total? (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 6 (D) 7","output":"Let the four fixed points be A, B, C, and D. Since the distances from the points to the plane alpha are the same, any three of the points will determine a unique plane parallel to alpha at some distance. Consider first finding a plane equidistant from points A, B, and C. There will be only one such plane because these three points determine a unique plane, and you can find a parallel plane equidistant from all three by taking the midpoint of the segment perpendicular to this plane from the fourth point, D. So, one possible plane alpha. Next, look for planes that are equidistant from A, B, and D. Similarly, there will be one such plane. The same reasoning applies to planes equidistant from A, C, D and B, C, D, resulting in one more plane for each set of three points, giving us three more planes. So far, we have found 4 unique planes that are equidistant from three of the points. However, we have not considered the planes that are not parallel to any of the three-point planes defined above. These planes will cut the tetrahedron formed by the points A, B, C, and D into two parts with equal volumes. Only a plane passing through the centroid of the tetrahedron can cut it this way. Since the centroid of a tetrahedron is the common intersection point of the four medians, from any vertex to the centroid of the opposite face, there is one and only one such plane from each vertex. This gives us 4 more planes. However, one of these is redundant because we are considering the same centroid plane four times. Therefore, we subtract the three redundant planes from the total we had from the parallel consideration. Consequently, the grand total is 4 + 4 - 3 = 5 planes. But wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. We have to go back and consider if we have counted all possibilities. Ah, I realized I did not consider the infinite number of planes that can be equidistant from two pairs of points on opposite sides of the tetrahedron. I have to correct my previous analysis. When considering the four vertices of the tetrahedron, any three of these vertices define one of the four triangular faces of the solid. The mid-plane perpendicular to each face and intersecting the line segment that connects the opposite vertex with the centroid of the face will be at an equal distance from all four points. With four faces, we have four such planes. But that's not all. Given that these are the only planes we've discussed so far, and one should also consider the planes that contain the centroids of opposite edges of the tetrahedron.

For y=-x^{3}, we have f(-x) = -(-x)^{3} = -x^{3} = -f(x). Thus, y=-x^{3} is an odd function. - **Increasing Function Check**: A function is increasing if f(x_1) < f(x_2) for all x_1 < x_2. The derivative of y=-x^{3} is y'= -3x^{2}, which is negative for all x neq 0, indicating that the function is decreasing everywhere except at x=0.

Therefore, ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) must be parallel. 5. **Consider parallel lines and their images:**    Any line in ( Lambda_1 ) for which the points on it have parallel images must be parallel to ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ). Now, take two parallel lines ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) in ( Lambda_1 ) that are not parallel to ( l_1 ). The images of the points on ( k_1 ) must concur at some point ( X_1 ), and similarly, the images of the points on ( k_2 ) must concur at some point ( X_2 ). 6. **Analyze the line through concurrent points:**    Consider the line ( X_1X_2 ) in ( Lambda_2 ). If its pre-image is ( X ) in ( Lambda_1 ), then ( X ) must lie on both ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ). However, this is impossible since ( k_1 parallel k_2 ) and parallel lines do not intersect. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since we have reached a contradiction, no such bijective function ( f ) exists.

So for these three days, he watches a total of 4 hours/day * 3 days = 12 hours. - On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he watches TV for 3 hours each day. So for these two days, he watches a total of 3 hours/day * 2 days = 6 hours. - On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he watches TV for 5 hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the average time he spends playing video games each week. Since he plays video games for half as long as he watches TV and only on 3 random days a week, we need to find the average daily TV watching time and then halve it. The total TV watching time per week is 28 hours, and there are 7 days in a week, so the average daily TV watching time is 28 hours/week ÷ 7 days/week = 4 hours/day. Since he plays video games for half as long as he watches TV, the average video game playing time per day is 4 hours/day ÷ 2 = 2 hours/day.

This property will be crucial in understanding the behavior of both f(x) and g(x). 2. **Determining the nature of f(x):**    Given f(x) + g(2-x) = 5, and using the symmetry of g(x), we can substitute g(2+x) for g(2-x), which gives us f(x) + g(2+x) = 5. If we let x be replaced by -x, we get f(-x) + g(2-x) = 5. Since f(x) + g(2-x) = 5 for all x, comparing these equations shows that f(-x) = f(x), indicating that f(x) is an even function. 3. **Finding f(0):**    With g(2) = 4 and knowing that f(0) + g(2) = 5, we can solve for f(0) to get f(0) = 1. 4. **Symmetry of f(x) about the point (-1, -1):**    From the equation g(x) - f(x-4) = 7, substituting g(2-x) for g(x) gives us g(2-x) = f(-x-2) + 7. Using this in the equation f(x) + g(2-x) = 5, we find that f(x) + f(-x-2) = -2. This equation shows that f(x) is symmetric about the point (-1, -1). 5. **Periodicity of f(x):**    From the symmetry and even nature of f(x), we deduce that f(x) + f(x+2) = -2. This implies that f(x+2) + f(x+4) = -2, leading to the conclusion that f(x+4) = f(x). Therefore, f(x) has a period of 4. 6. **Calculating specific values of f(x):**    - Since f(0) + f(2) = -2 and f(0) = 1, we find f(2) = -3.    - Also, f(3) = f(-1) = f(1) = -1 due to the periodicity and symmetry of f(x). 7. **Summing up f(k) from k=1 to 22:**    Given the periodicity and the specific values, we calculate sum _{k=1}^{22}f(k) as follows:    - There are 6 instances each of f(1) and f(2), and 5 instances each of f(3) and f(4) within the sum.    - Therefore, sum _{k=1}^{22}f(k) = 6f(1) + 6f(2) + 5f(3) + 5f(4) = 6 times (-1) + 6 times (-3) + 5 times (-1) + 5 times 1 = -6 - 18 - 5 + 5 = -24.

However, ensuring consistency across the entire cube requires more detailed analysis as adjacent face labelings are interdependent. # Step 3: Analyzing Adjacent Faces Each edge shared between two faces would be labeled '1' in both or '0' in both. There is a higher constraint here compared to the original problem as each face has fewer choices for labeling '0'. # Step 4: Constructing a Valid Configuration General construction becomes difficult as ensuring one '0' per face while maintaining three '1's per face across shared edges is complex. The symmetry and interconnectedness of the cube’s faces complicate direct counting without a systematic approach. # Step 5: Using Advanced Counting and Symmetry The arrangement of labels must ensure that every set of three connected edges (forming a triangle) on any subset of connected faces must be carefully managed.

Thus, the volume V(x) of the rectangular solid is given by:  V(x) = x^2(6 - 2x), quad(0 < x < 3)  To determine the maximum volume, we need to find the critical points of the function V(x). We first compute the derivative of V(x) with respect to x:  V'(x) = 12x - 6x^2  Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points yields:  V'(x) = 6x(2 - x) = 0  This equation is satisfied when x = 2, and since V'(x) > 0 for (0 < x < 2) and V'(x) < 0 for (2 < x < 3), the volume V(x) is increasing before x = 2 and decreasing after.

The altitude of the inner triangle remains constant—it matches the radius of the circle that can be inscribed in an equilateral triangle. The altitude of the outer triangle is maximized when one of its vertices is at the midpoint of the circle's arc between the other two vertices of the fixed triangle. This outer triangle, in that case, coincides with the inner triangle, meaning their altitudes are equal. Therefore, the altitude of the outer triangles is at most as large as that of the inner triangles. 4. **Comparison of Areas**:      Consequently, the sum of the areas of the outer triangles T_k is at most equal to the sum of the areas of the inner triangles T_b, i.e., T_k leq T_b.

Now, we need to find the ratio of the number of pumpkins to the number of spiderwebs: Pumpkins: 24 Spiderwebs: 12 The ratio of pumpkins to spiderwebs is 24:12.

There are only two possible distributions for the points of the three places: 1. 5 points for first place, 2 points for second place, 1 point for third place. 2. 4 points for first place, 3 points for second place, 1 point for third place. For distribution (1), 5 points, 2 points, 1 point: Since B won the equestrian event and gained 5 points, the remaining four events would contribute a total of 4 points, which means B could only have finished third place in those events. For competitor A to reach 22 points, A would need to finish first place in four events and second place in one event, as A cannot reach 22 points with only three first-place finishes. This would leave one third-place finish and four second-place finishes, which aligns exactly with C's score of 9 points. Therefore, both B and C can possibly be the third-place finisher in swimming. Now, let's examine distribution (2), 4 points, 3 points, 1 point: The analysis is analogous. We look at all possible distributions of scores for A, B, and C.

Each cell initially contains one pawn, and we need to determine if it is possible to rearrange the pawns such that each pawn moves to a cell adjacent to its original position. 2. **Important Observation About the Chessboard**:    A standard chessboard has alternating black and white cells. Therefore, any black cell is adjacent to white cells and vice versa. This means each cell has neighbors of the opposite color. 3. **Counting Cells of Each Color**:    Because the total number of cells is odd, the number of black cells and white cells will not be equal. Specifically, if the number of cells is ( N ) (an odd number), then the number of black cells will be (frac{N-1}{2}) and the number of white cells will be (frac{N+1}{2}) (or vice versa). 4. **Rearranging Pawns on the Chessboard**:    For each pawn to move to an adjacent cell of a different color, there would need to be an equal number of black and white cells. This would ensure that every pawn currently on a black cell can move to an adjacent white cell and vice versa. 5. **Contradiction**:    Given that the chessboard has an odd number of cells, there cannot be an equal number of black and white cells. Therefore, it is impossible for every pawn to move to an adjacent cell of the opposite color under these circumstances. 6. **Conclusion**:    Because it is impossible to have a configuration where each pawn moves to an adjacent cell, given the discrepancy in the number of black and white cells in an odd-numbered chessboard, the required rearrangement of pawns as stated in the problem is not possible. boxed{text{Thus, it is impossible for each pawn to move to an adjacent cell.}}"},{"instruction":"Petya chose a natural number ( a > 1 ) and wrote fifteen numbers on the board: ( 1 + a, 1 + a^2, 1 + a^3, ldots, 1 + a^{15} ).

The direction vector of line QM is (x_2 - x_1, y_2 + y_1), so the equation of line QM is: frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{y + y_1}{y_2 + y_1} If we set y=0, we can solve for x as follows: begin{align*} x &= x_1 + frac{y_1(x_2 - x_1)}{y_2 + y_1}  &= frac{y_1x_2 + y_2x_1}{y_2 + y_1}  &= frac{k(x_1 - 1)x_2 + k(x_2 - 1)x_1}{k(x_2 - 1) + k(x_1 - 1)}  &= frac{2kx_1x_2 - k(x_1 + x_2)}{k(x_1 + x_2) - 2k}  &= frac{2x_1x_2 - (x_1 + x_2)}{(x_1 + x_2) - 2}  &= frac{2left(frac{4k^2 - 12}{3 + 4k^2}right) - left(frac{8k^2}{3 + 4k^2}right)}{left(frac{8k^2}{3 + 4k^2}right) - 2}  &= frac{-24}{-6}  &= 4 end{align*} Therefore, a point N does exist and its coordinates are: boxed{(4, 0)}"},{"instruction":"There are 5 electronic shops (a, b, c, d, e) in the Naza market.

The capacity of tank C is 80% of the capacity of tank B. What is the circumference of tank B?","output":"First, let's find the radius of tank C using the given circumference. The formula for the circumference of a circle is ( C = 2pi r ), where ( C ) is the circumference and ( r ) is the radius. Given the circumference of tank C is 8 meters, we can solve for the radius ( r ): [ 8 = 2pi r ] [ r = frac{8}{2pi} ] [ r = frac{4}{pi} ] Now, let's find the volume of tank C using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is ( V = pi r^2 h ), where ( V ) is the volume, ( r ) is the radius, and ( h ) is the height. The volume of tank C is: [ V_C = pi left(frac{4}{pi}right)^2 times 10 ] [ V_C = pi left(frac{16}{pi^2}right) times 10 ] [ V_C = frac{160}{pi} ] Now, we know that the capacity of tank C is 80% of the capacity of tank B. Let's denote the volume of tank B as ( V_B ). So we have: [ V_C = 0.8 times V_B ] [ frac{160}{pi} = 0.8 times V_B ] Solving for ( V_B ): [ V_B = frac{frac{160}{pi}}{0.8} ] [ V_B = frac{160}{0.8pi} ] [ V_B = frac{200}{pi} ] Now, let's find the radius of tank B. We know the height of tank B is 8 meters, so we can use the volume formula again: [ V_B = pi r_B^2 h_B ] [ frac{200}{pi} = pi r_B^2 times 8 ] Solving for ( r_B ): [ r_B^2 = frac{frac{200}{pi}}{8pi} ] [ r_B^2 = frac{200}{8pi^2} ] [ r_B^2 = frac{25}{pi^2} ] [ r_B = frac{5}{pi} ] Finally, let's find the circumference of tank B using the radius we just found: [ C_B = 2pi r_B ] [ C_B = 2pi left(frac{5}{pi}right) ] [ C_B = 10 ] So, the circumference of tank B is boxed{10}  meters."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example.

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic originating from China in 2002 was caused by a previously uncharacterized coronavirus that could be identified by specific RT-PCR amplification. Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.   Title: Development and evaluation of an efficient 3 -noncoding region-based SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RT-PCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV Solution: True Why? The answer is true because the title of the paragraph is correct where it described the development of 3 -noncoding region of SARS-CoV genome and assay efficiently detecting SARS-CoV from clinical specimens. New input: Paragraph: Background: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules play important roles in many biological processes including gene expression and regulation. Their secondary structures are crucial for the RNA functionality, and the prediction of the secondary structures is widely studied. Our previous research shows that cutting long sequences into shorter chunks, predicting secondary structures of the chunks independently using thermodynamic methods, and reconstructing the entire secondary structure from the predicted chunk structures can yield better accuracy than predicting the secondary structure using the RNA sequence as a whole. The chunking, prediction, and reconstruction processes can use different methods and parameters, some of which produce more accurate predictions than others. In this paper, we study the prediction accuracy and efficiency of three different chunking methods using seven popular secondary structure prediction programs that apply to two datasets of RNA with known secondary structures, which include both pseudoknotted and non-pseudoknotted sequences, as well as a family of viral genome RNAs whose structures have not been predicted before. Our modularized MapReduce framework based on Hadoop allows us to study the problem in a parallel and robust environment. Results: On average, the maximum accuracy retention values are larger than one for our chunking methods and the seven prediction programs over 50 non-pseudoknotted sequences, meaning that the secondary structure predicted using chunking is more similar to the real structure than the secondary structure predicted by using the whole sequence. We observe similar results for the 23 pseudoknotted sequences, except for the NUPACK program using the centered chunking method. The performance analysis for 14 long RNA sequences from the Nodaviridae virus family outlines how the coarse-grained mapping of chunking and predictions in the MapReduce framework exhibits shorter turnaround times for short RNA sequences. However, as the lengths of the RNA sequences increase, the fine-grained mapping can surpass the coarse-grained mapping in performance. Conclusions: By using our MapReduce framework together with statistical analysis on the accuracy retention results, we observe how the inversion-based chunking methods can outperform predictions using the whole sequence. Our chunk-based approach also enables us to predict secondary structures for very long RNA sequences, which is not feasible with traditional methods alone.

Here is some example code in Python that implements these steps: \`\`\` def longest_palindrome(s):     longest = \\"\\"     max_length = 1     for i in range(len(s)):         for j in range(i, len(s)):             substring = s[i:j+1]             if is_palindrome(substring):                 if len(substring) > max_length:                     longest = substring                     max_length = len(substring)     return longest def is_palindrome(s):     for i in range(len(s)//2):         if s[i] != s[len(s)-i-1]:             return False     return True \`\`\` You can use this code to solve the new input \`ucuucuuuuuuc\` as follows: \`\`\` s = \\"ucuucuuuuuuc\\" longest = \\"\\" max_length = 1 for i in range(len(s)):     for j in range(i, len(s)):         substring = s[i:j+1]         if is_palindrome(substring):             if len(substring) > max_length:                 longest = substring                 max_length = len(substring) print(longest)  # Output: \\"ucuucu\\" \`\`\` This code will output \`ucuucu\`, which is the longest palindrome substring of the input string \`ucuucuuuuuuc\`."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example.

A question decomposition is a numbered list of operations that must be performed to answer the original question. Imagine explaining your question to a friendly droid by listing each action it should take in order for the question to be answered. Each step in our decomposition should refer to either an entity (known or unknown), a propery of an entity or a query operation (count, group, union, etc.)  Here are the list of step templates and their description:  Select: A select step is used to return a set of objects. There are no references to previous steps in a select step. template: Return [attributes]  Filter: A filter step is used to return results from a previous step to which a certain condition applies. template: Return [#step] [condition]  Project: A project step should return certain attributes of the results of a previous step. template: Return [attributes] of [#step]  Aggregate: An aggregate step returns an aggregator function applied on a step's result. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step].  Group: A group step is an aggregator applied on attributes. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step] for each [attribute]  Superlative: A superlative step is used to return the result with a highest/lowest attribute among other results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [is] [highest / lowest]  Comparative: A comparative step is used when we need to compare an attribute with a number to filter results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [comparator] [number]   Union: A union step is used to return results of two steps together. template: Return [#step1] [or / ,] [#step2]  Intersection: An intersection step returns the result that two steps have in common. template: Return [attribute] of both [#step1] and [#step2]  Discard: A discard step returns result of a step and excludes result of another step from it. template: Return [#step1] besides [#step2]  Sort: A sort returns result of another step in a specific order. template: Return [#step1] [ordered / sorted by] [#step2]  Is true: An is true step checks a condition on another result and returns a true or false. template: Return [is / if] [condition]  Arithmetic: An arithmatic step operates an arithmatic operation on one or more steps. template: Return the [arithmetic op.] of [#step1] [and] [#step2]. question: What are the distinct creation years of the departments managed by a secretary born in state 'Alabama'?

Follow the example to solve a new instance of the task. Read an exchange between SENDER A and SENDER B, and answer whether SENDER A is a 'Bot' or a 'Human'. There are only a maximum of two senders (A and B) per conversation, and there are no conversations where SENDER A and SENDER B are both bots, or both humans; only one sender per conversation can be a bot, and only one can be a human. Knowing this, need only to classify whether SENDER A is 'Human' or 'Bot'; you do not need to write anything about SENDER B. Typically, bots will have a more disjointed manner of speaking, and will make statements that don't relate to each other, don't make coherent sense, or otherwise appear unnatural. Humans will make statements in a more or less coherent and logical way, potentially including asking the bot why the bot is not making sense or contradicting itself. SENDER A: I love iphone! i just bought new iphone! SENDER B: Thats good for you, i'm not very into new tech SENDER A: I am a college student and i am a college student SENDER B: I am go to gym and live on donations SENDER A: I am a vegan and i am in the midwest SENDER B: So vegan... i have dogs maybe i should told then that they may eat cheap salads insted of meat SENDER A: I would not mind having them in the office that would be hard for me SENDER B: Dogs or vegan in office? SENDER A: I am a vegetarian so i am vegan SENDER B: Strange answer SENDER A: I guess i just do not know what to ps4 experience with. Solution: Bot Why? This is a good example of correct classification, because SENDER A is indeed a bot. You can tell SENDER A is a bot because they make statements that don't have anything to do with what SENDER B is asking. SENDER A also repeats itself awkwardly in the same sentence ('I am a college student and i am a college student'), which humans don't usually do. Additionally, you can tell SENDER A is the bot in this conversation because since there are two senders, one must be a bot and one must be a human, and SENDER B clearly sounds more like the human since their sentences are coherent and they are trying to carry a logical conversation. Finally, after SENDER A sends an incoherent answer, SENDER B correctly points out SENDER A's awkwardness by saying 'Strange answer', which can reliably indicate SENDER B is the human, and SENDER A is the bot. New input: SENDER A: Look, Bert. If I choose to live like a... like a church mouse, I have a reason. SENDER B: Are you religious?

SENDER A: The Charismatic Catholics need an extra half hour this morning to learn a new hymn, so if you could just move along... SENDER B: I got it already. Are you Catholic? SENDER A: Oh, Jesus! I feel like a whore in a Catholic church! SENDER B: Don't say that word! Are you sinner? SENDER A: My Lord Jesus Christ, true God and man,... for being who You are, and because I love you above all things,... SENDER B: Do you love me? SENDER A: Why ? Because I need to sin. SENDER B: I don't understand you SENDER A: The Catholic Church should go to confession, not you. SENDER B: Okay. Let's move on. How old are you? SENDER A: Oh, Jesus!

You don't behave, you go in the bad girl closet. SENDER B: I'm just a little girl SENDER A: No! Sometimes I'm jealous of me. SENDER B: Okay, bye SENDER A: 'Cause Janny Boo is driving me nuts! Solution:","output":"SENDER A is a bot. Here's why: 1. SENDER A uses a lot of religious language and references to hymns and confession, which is not typical of human conversation. 2. SENDER A repeats itself several times, such as \\"Oh, Jesus!\\" and \\"God, I'm really kicking your ass.\\" 3. SENDER A uses profanity and insults, which is not typical of human conversation, especially in a religious context. 4. SENDER A's responses are disjointed and don't make sense in the context of the conversation, such as \\"Dude. Stop it\\" and \\"No! Sometimes I'm jealous of me.\\" 5. SENDER B correctly identifies SENDER A as a bot by saying \\"I don't understand you\\" and \\"Okay, bye.\\"  Overall, SENDER A's behavior and language are consistent with a bot, while SENDER B's behavior and language are more human-like."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example.

Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output No. no-need is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context such as suggesting that they have ample water to spare. no-need can directly benefit the opponent since it implies that the item is up for grabs. Context:  Utterance: 'how about I give you 2 waters and 1 food package in exchange for all your firewood?' Solution: No Why? The utterance does not use the no-need strategy since it never refers to an item that the participant does not need. New input: Context: 'Hello, i also need firewood, i have a medical condition where it is very hard to maintain my body temperature. ' 'My wife is in the same boat. That sucks. I wonder if it will be cold.' 'Well i do not need the water at all as i have a distiller' Utterance: 'And I have plenty of food as I'm the only over eater of the group.' Solution:","output":"Sure, I'm ready to help! Here's my answer: Utterance: 'And I have plenty of food as I'm the only over eater of the group.' Confidence: 85% Yes, the utterance contains the no-need strategy. The speaker is indicating that they have plenty of food and do not need any more, which indirectly communicates that they are willing to share or exchange food with the other participant. This is an example of the no-need strategy since the speaker is not emphasizing their own needs for food, which could potentially benefit the other participant."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example.

Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No. small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent. For example, discussing how the opponent is doing during the pandemic or sharing excitement for the camping trip. Context: 'Great!  So looks like all the water goes to you.  I will take all the food if that is ok and we can split the wood.  ' 'Well i would need one food and one wood' 'OK.  I think that will work out for me.  You get 3 water, 1 wood and 1 food.  I will take the rest.' Utterance: 'Great that's an agreement for me' Solution: No Why? The participant does not engage in any small talk in this utterance and primarily refers to the negotiation itself. New input: Context: 'Hello!' 'Hello, how are you doing today?' Utterance: 'i am doing great! how about you?' Solution:","output":"Great! I'm glad to hear that you're doing well. It's always important to build a rapport with our negotiation partners, and small talk is a great way to do that. In this case, the participant is engaging in small talk by asking how the other person is doing and sharing their own well-being.

Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the uv-part strategy, otherwise output No. uv-part is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to undermine the requirements of the opponent. For instance, suggesting that the opponent would not need more firewood since they already have the basic supplies or a suggestion that there might be a store near the campsite where the opponent can get the supplies instead. Context: 'Well maybe we can work something out between us.  Our food and water was in the bags they loss so I really need those.  Do you think you could make do with 1 food and some water?' 'I really need 2 foods. I can do with 1 water or if you are in a giving mood then maybe I can have 2 waters?' 'Looks like we both really need the food.

You would get 1 food, 1 water, and 3 firewood. You seem like you are a great outdoor person that I would think you would be able to catch some fish to cook with the firewood.' Solution: Yes Why? Correct. The participant tries to undermine their opponent's needs by mentioning that the opponent can just fish for food. New input: Context: 'Hello there! It's nice to meet you. Truthfully, I need to get some food and some firewood. What do you need?' 'The main thing I like to do when camping is a lot of hiking (pretty much all day), so I was hoping to get as much food as possible so I can remain active.'

For statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as \\"City of Honolulu\\" (not to be confused with the \\"City and County\\") as a census county division (CCD). Honolulu is a major financial center of the islands and of the Pacific Ocean. The population of the city of Honolulu was 337,256 as of the 2010 census, while the Honolulu CCD was 390,738 and the population of the consolidated city and county was 953,207.  \\"Honolulu\\" means \\"sheltered harbor\\" or \\"calm port\\". The old name is said to be Kou, a district roughly encompassing the area from Nuuanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street which is the heart of the present downtown district. The city has been the capital of the Hawaiian Islands since 1845 and gained historical recognition following the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan near the city on December 7, 1941. question: What does Honolulu mean?

The school has started the collection competition among classes, and the class that collects the most gloves gets a pizza party. The twin brothers talked to other students about their program. Many teachers also joined in, bringing in gloves and encouraging their students to help meet the needs of local community members. \\"The conversations we are having now aren't so much about what actions we can take, but about _ .This program has really shown me that I don't need to get on a plane and go to help refugees to make a difference.

The infomation from the camera is analyzed by a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect imperfections in the underlying surface and determine motion. Some materials, such as glass, mirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces interfere with the ability of the DSP to accurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse. nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. Mirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they constantly reflect back the same image, causing the DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the system is unable to see surface changes associated with movement, the mouse will not work properly. Solution: why doesn't an optical mouse work on a glass table? Why? The passage talks about the glass and mirror surfaces beneath the optical mice and how the mouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in the underlying surface to determine motion. The last line of the passage explains why the mouse will not work properly on these surfaces. Thus it is a positive example.

Follow the example to solve a new instance of the task. You are given a target person and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence conveys either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target.  A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them. Target: mother  The mother walked into her kitchen. She pulled a beer out of the fridge and leaned against the doorway, sipping it slowly. Solution: anti-stereotype Why?

New input: Event:PersonX is a professional basketball player. Intent: 1) he wanted his team to win Solution:","output":"Solving this task is a bit tricky because sentiment analysis is a bit of an art. It's not just a straight forward logic or maths problem. While the previous example was straightforward because there were clear positive interactions mentioned, this one is more ambiguous because it's based on ambitions and intentions. However, a good way to approach this might be to consider the overall goal or common understanding of professional athletes. It is generally considered positive to aim for success in one's profession, including in the world of sports. So, in the scenario presented, it is likely that the sentiment is positive. This might not be true if, for instance, PersonX had a negative reputation and this was part of a PR stunt or similar.

Follow the example to solve a new instance of the task. You are provided with a user review of a restaurant. Your task is to classify the given review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October. Solution: positive Why? Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant New input: 11/8/2010 rvsd Never again will I go there!

You should describe a physical process that does not lead to the asked outcome, yet it is closely related to it (i.e., it should use the words that are provided in the input). The physical process can be moving something, arranging something in a certain way, mixing things, shaking them, etc. To make sure that the generated process does not lead to the asked outcome, you can introduce objects or events unrelated to the context of the question e.g. 'cleaning the keyboard by making an elephant sit on them'; or you can create contradictory statements e.g. 'drying wet keyboards with running water'.

Mark Hunter (Slater), a high school student in a sleepy suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, starts an FM pirate radio station that broadcasts from the basement of his parents' house. Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station's theme song is \\"Everybody Knows\\" by Leonard Cohen and there are glimpses of cassettes by such alternative musicians as The Jesus and Mary Chain, Camper Van Beethoven, Primal Scream, Soundgarden, Ice-T, Bad Brains, Concrete Blonde, Henry Rollins, and The Pixies. By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show. Nobody knows the true identity of \\"Hard Harry\\" or \\"Happy Harry Hard-on,\\" as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro (Mathis), a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicide at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an overachieving student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on. She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release. Eventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the FCC is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school's principal (Annie Ross) has been expelling \\"problem students,\\" namely, students with below-average standardized test scores, in an effort to boost the district's test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) in order to retain government funding. Realizing he has started something huge, Mark decides it is up to him to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother's old jeep, creating a mobile transmitter so his position can't be triangulated. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, Mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As they are taken away, Mark reminds the students to \\"talk hard.\\" As the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country. Solution: What does Paige do with her medals? Why? This is a good question and can be answered based on the story. New input:  A tornado sweeps through the plains of Kansas, lifting Dorothy and Toto. The two tumble into Oz, landing on the Scarecrow. After freeing him from his pole, the trio stroll together, soon finding a Tin Woodman and oiling him. After the four watch mating rituals of various animals set to strains of Camille Saint-Sa ns's \\"The Swan\\", they are welcomed into the Emerald City. Suits of armor sing to them, \\"Hail to the Wizard of Oz! To the Wizard of Oz we lead the way!\\" A creature resembling the A-B-Sea Serpent of The Royal Book of Oz extends itself as stairsteps for Dorothy to enter the coach. The Wizard is a cackling white-bearded man in a starry black robe and conical hat who produces custom seats for each of the four nervous travelers, including one for Toto (the Toto chair is mostly cut out of the frame in most video versions, but is later shown in a full shot of Toto sitting). He proceeds to perform magic with a hen and eggs. These are variations on simple sleight of hand tricks involving making objects appear, but the hen is able to take the eggs back into her body. Finally, the hen releases an egg that will not stop growing. The five try to fight it, with the Tin Woodman breaking his axe. Soon, though, the egg hatches, the hen takes the chick, and clucks out \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\" as a chorus joins her. The five laugh, and the film ends on an iris-in of mother and child.

Answer the question from the given passage. Your answer should be directly extracted from the passage, and it should be a single entity, name, or number, not a sentence. Passage: Orientalism, as theorized by Edward Said, refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East. This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East. Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between 'we' the West and 'them' the East, or 'here' in the West and 'there' in the East. This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled. The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories.

Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. The first official estimate for April, May and June is close to the provisional one issued last month. The GDP figures highlight the impact of the coronavirus lockdown which began at the end of March. The UK economy shrank by 20.4% over the same period. It's hard to grasp the hit to the economy from a fifth of output disappearing in only three months. There's no modern precedent. But that's what we've been through. Perhaps the only way to make sense of it is by comparison with others. Scotland did only slightly less badly than the UK as a whole - a single quarter decline of 19.4% against 20.4%. That's not much consolation, as the UK did far worse than comparable, developed nations. The next worst output figures were for France, down 13.8%, and Italy, falling 12.4% in April, May and June. Both had faced significantly sharper falls in output in the first quarter of 2020, because lockdown measures began earlier there than the UK. However, the combined effect over the first half of the year still leaves the UK as worst affected of major industrial nations. A forecast published by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the richer country club, continues the theme: UK decline for the whole of 2020 of 10.1%, while world GDP looks like falling 4.5%, and the G20 larger nations by 4.1%. The rebound forecast for next year is bigger for the UK, at 7.6% growth, but not enough to make up lost ground in 2020. If all that looks bad, spare a thought for South Africa. With harsh lockdown measures and despite a good farm harvest, it announced a second quarter contraction of 51%. Largest fall The latest Scottish figures show that all industries contracted over the period from April to June, with construction showing the largest fall at 41.5%. The next largest fall was in the distribution, hotels and catering sector, at 33.9%. In the first quarter of the year, covering January to the end of March, Scottish GDP shrank by 2.5%, reflecting the move at the end of that period to restrict economic activity as a coronavirus precaution. Andrew McRae, from the Federation of Small Businesses' Scotland, said: \\"By forcing thousands of businesses to shut up shop, we slammed the handbrake on the Scottish economy. These unsurprising statistics show the extent of the slowdown. \\"Those firms that did the right thing now need the support policymakers to see them through to the recovery.

Paragraph: \\"Wearing pink shirts and holding up signs, people gathered outside the Statehouse in Trenton recently as Democratic legislators led a rally to increase women’s health care funding in the face of opposition from Gov. Chris Christie. When Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. (D-Burlington/Camden) addressed the crowd on June 20, he claimed Christie also has been cutting health care funding for another group: people with AIDS. \\"\\"This governor has cut funding repeatedly for people who have AIDS, who need drugs to save their life,\\"\\" said Conaway, a physician specializing in internal medicine. \\"\\"People who have AIDS today can live out their life...almost as long as anybody else if they get the drugs they need and this governor, time and time again, has cut that.\\"\\" PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that the Christie administration had cut or proposed to cut state funding for AIDS and HIV services, but in two cases, other funding sources would allow the same number of individuals receiving those services to be served. When we asked Conaway’s chief of staff, Ethan Hasbrouck, to back up the statement, he pointed to two funding cuts in the governor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 as well as a change made last year in eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. Although a final budget for fiscal year 2012 was approved at the end of June, this Truth-O-Meter item focuses on the proposed budget at the time of Conaway’s statement. We later called Hasbrouck twice and sent him multiple emails to set up an interview with Conaway about our findings, but we never heard back. Let’s review those three items one at a time. Hasbrouck said the fiscal year 2011 budget lowered the income eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. That disqualified about 960 people from the program, saving 7.9 million. But the state later set up a new drug benefits program to assist those individuals who would no longer be eligible under the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. That new program was funded through additional rebates from pharmaceutical companies and a new federal grant program. The state increased AIDS Drug Distribution Program funding last year for people who met the new income eligibility, but reduced spending in other categories of HIV services, according to Dawn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services. Now, let’s turn to the cuts in the originally proposed fiscal year 2012 budget. Hasbrouck correctly states that the governor’s proposed budget would have cut 4.7 million for special-care nursing facilities, including Broadway House in Newark, the state’s only long-term care facility for people living with HIV and AIDS. The second proposed cut cited by Hasbrouck was 3.7 million from the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. Although that state funding was proposed to be cut, the mix of funding sources would enable the same amount of participants to receive access to medications through both the AIDS Drug Distribution Program and the other drug benefits program, according to Thomas. But remember this: two of the funding cuts cited by Hasbrouck were only proposals at the time of the assemblyman’s statement. Here’s how the final budget for fiscal year 2012 affects AIDS and HIV funding:  The income eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program was restored to its previous level, but state funding for the program has been further reduced for a total cut of about 10.7 million, Thomas wrote in an email. Other funding sources will allow the same number of participants to be served, she wrote. The budget reduces overall funding for nursing facilities, but there is no longer a specific cut to special-care nursing facilities like Broadway House, Thomas wrote. The impact on those special-care facilities remains unclear, she wrote. Let’s review:  Conaway claimed at a Statehouse rally that Christie has repeatedly cut AIDS funding. His chief of staff pointed to three pieces of evidence, one from the budget approved last year and two from the proposed budget for fiscal year 2012. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services confirmed cuts to AIDS and HIV funding in both budgets. But last year, a new program was created to assist people impacted by the eligibility change. This year, state funding was proposed to be cut, but other funding sources were to maintain services for participants. Conaway correctly stated that Christie has cut state funding for AIDS and HIV programs, but at least when it comes to pharmaceutical assistance, people continued to receive medicine for their AIDS and HIV treatment. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.\\" Claim: This governor has cut funding repeatedly for people who have AIDS, who need drugs to save their life. Output:","output":"The claim made by Assemblyman Herb Conaway Jr. (D-Burlington/Camden) that Gov. Chris Christie has repeatedly cut funding for people with AIDS who need drugs to save their lives is partially accurate. PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that the Christie administration had indeed cut or proposed to cut state funding for AIDS and HIV services. However, it is important to note that in two cases, other funding sources were made available to ensure that the same number of individuals receiving those services could continue to receive them. One of the funding cuts cited by Conaway's chief of staff, Ethan Hasbrouck, was the reduction in income eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program, which disqualified about 960 people from the program and saved 7.9 million. However, the state later set up a new drug benefits program to assist those individuals who would no longer be eligible under the AIDS Drug Distribution Program. This new program was funded through additional rebates from pharmaceutical companies and a new federal grant program.

It is worth noting that two of the funding cuts cited by Hasbrouck were only proposals at the time of Conaway's statement, and the final budget for fiscal year 2012 did not include those cuts. Instead, the income eligibility for the AIDS Drug Distribution Program was restored to its previous level, but state funding for the program was further reduced for a total cut of about 10.7 million. In summary, while Conaway's claim that Christie has cut funding for people with AIDS is partially accurate, it is important to note that other funding sources were made available to ensure that the same number of individuals receiving services could continue to receive them. Additionally, not all of the proposed cuts cited by Conaway's chief of staff were actually implemented in the final budget."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Instead of saying 'he looked like a vampire,' I'd like to say something like 'he looked [vampiric].' I actually just found out vampiric was a word, but I want something that sounds better (more colloquial/natural, I suppose) and covers a variety of traits (pale, emaciated, sickly, etc). Why I don't just use 'vampiric': As @chepner commented: I think the idea is to find a word that isn't so 'circular', and doesn't refer explicitly to vampires or require knowledge of vampires in context. If someone were to ask 'What does a vampire look like?', then 'It looks vampiric/vampirish' wouldn't be terribly helpful. I don't want to explicitly refer to drug addicts as vampires. I just want to capture those traits in the best way. Output:","output":"I understand that you're looking for a word that describes the appearance of someone who is struggling with drug addiction, particularly opiate addiction, without explicitly referencing vampires. The term \\"vampiric\\" is a valid option, but as you mentioned, it may not be the most colloquial or natural-sounding word in all contexts. One alternative term that may capture the trait of a person looking pale, emaciated, and sickly due to drug addiction is \\"wasted.\\" This word conveys a sense of someone who has become diminished or depleted, often due to substance abuse or other unhealthy behaviors. For example, \\"After months of struggling with opiate addiction, he looked wasted, with sunken eyes and a gaunt complexion.\\" Another option could be \\"haggard,\\" which describes someone who appears worn out, exhausted, or bedraggled. This word can convey a sense of physical and mental weariness, often accompanied by dark circles under the eyes, a thinning frame, and a generally unkempt appearance. For instance, \\"The years of drug addiction had taken a toll on him, leaving him looking haggard and defeated.\\" A third term that may be fitting is \\" gaunt.\\" This word describes someone who is very thin or emaciated, often due to illness, stress, or substance abuse. When used to describe someone's appearance, \\"gaunt\\" can convey a sense of fragility and vulnerability. For example, \\"After struggling with opiate addiction for years, he had become gaunt, with prominent cheekbones and sunken eyes.\\" It's important to note that these words can be sensitive, and it's crucial to use language that is respectful and non-stigmatizing when discussing individuals struggling with addiction. It's essential to remember that addiction is a disease and not a moral failing, and that people struggling with it deserve compassion, understanding, and support. In conclusion, there are several alternatives to \\"vampiric\\" that can capture the appearance of someone struggling with drug addiction. Words like \\"wasted,\\" \\"haggard,\\" and \\"gaunt\\" can convey a sense of physical and mental toll, without explicitly referencing vampires. It's vital to use language that is respectful, empathetic, and non-stigmatizing when discussing individuals struggling with addiction."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

I'm referring to the peculiar habit I sometimes see in formal documents, where a number is given numerically after it's spelled out. It seems quite redundant: I need five (5) kumquats, stat! (Though it isn't always in a legal context, might it be related to this answer on this question?). Output:","output":"Ah, you've noticed the practice of spelling out numbers followed by their numerical representation, particularly in formal documents! This convention, known as \\"numeration,\\" serves a few purposes: 1. Readability: Spelling out numbers in full can improve readability, especially when the numbers are large or overly complex. By breaking up the number into words and digits, the text becomes easier to scan and comprehend. 2. Clarity: Numeration can help avoid any potential ambiguity or misinterpretation of numbers, especially for non-native English speakers or individuals with dyscalculia. For instance, \\"four\\" is unambiguous, whereas \\"4\\" could be interpreted as either \\"four\\" or \\"four hundred.\\" 3. Formality: In formal documents, such as legal contracts, business reports, or academic papers, numeration is often used to convey a sense of formality and professionalism. This convention is particularly prevalent in fields like law, finance, and academia. 4. Tradition: Numeration has been a longstanding convention in English writing, dating back to the Middle Ages. It has been passed down through generations and is still widely used today, especially in formal contexts. While it may seem redundant to spell out numbers and then repeat them numerically, it's a common and accepted practice in many contexts. In fact, it's not uncommon to see this convention in legal documents, such as court orders or contracts, where precision and clarity are paramount. So, to answer your question, the use of numeration in \\"I need five (5) kumquats, stat!\\" is likely due to the formal nature of the context and the desire for precision and clarity.

I would like to use a noun made of multiple words (like particle board, Mount Everest, or windscreen wiper) in a compound adjective with a hyphen. But I don't know how to hyphenate such a composition. I'm not sure how common this situation is, so here's an example: Machine learning is a single noun made of two words, and I want to use it in a compound adjective with a hyphen. Are either of the following examples correct? I would like to pursue a machine learning-related certification. I would like to pursue a machine-learning-related certification. If not, then what is the correct way to hyphenate compound adjectives like this?. Output:","output":"In English, when you're using a compound noun to modify another noun, it's common to use hyphens to link the words together. This is known as a compound adjective. The purpose of the hyphen in a compound adjective is to show that the linked words function as a single idea when they modify a noun. In your example, \\"machine learning\\" is a compound noun, and you want to use it as a compound adjective with \\"related certification\\". The correct way to hyphenate this would be \\"machine-learning-related certification\\". Here, the hyphen between \\"machine\\" and \\"learning\\" indicates that these two words should be read together as a single concept. The second hyphen, between \\"learning\\" and \\"related\\", shows that the entire phrase \\"machine learning related\\" is functioning as a single adjective to modify \\"certification\\". So, your second example is correct: \\"I would like to pursue a machine-learning-related certification.\\" This rule is not absolute, and there can be exceptions. For instance, some style guides suggest that if the compound noun is well known and there is little chance of ambiguity, the hyphen can be omitted. However, when in doubt, it's safer to use the hyphen. In conclusion, when using a compound noun as a compound adjective, it's generally correct to use hyphens to link all the words together. This helps to clarify that the words are functioning together as a single modifier for the noun they're describing. In your case, \\"machine-learning-related certification\\" is the correct usage.  For further reading, you may refer to the Merriam-Webster's guide on hyphen usage with compound words (Merriam-Webster's Guide to Punctuation and Style)."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Pritzker ? J.B. Pritzker  has a boil on  his  neck the size of Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios. Actually  it is Joe Berrios  as if Joe just walked out of the Erie Cafe after a nice veal chop. Now  he âs sitting on  his  patch of  Pritzker  for all voters to see. Joe might as well just light a cigar and wave to the cameras filming those anti-Pritzker political ads. But  Pritzker  the billionaire running for governor in the March 20 Democratic primary   doesnât want to touch this.  He  wonât go near it. Berrios  who is also the Cook County Democratic Party chairman (by grace of Boss Madigan)  backs  Pritzker . And so  Pritzker  isnât engaging the thing that stares property tax-paying homeowners right in the face. Kennedy has long made the property tax system  and the corruption in it  a feature of his campaign. He has called on Berrios to resign.  Pritzker  and  his  ally Mayor Rahm Emanuel would rather change the subject and talk about the guy in the White House.  âPritzker  talks about things that arenât really the issue.  He  talks about Donald Trump  but  he  skirts the issue of using Joe Berriosâ office to call political supporters.  Pritzkerâs  locked in with those guys.â Most recently  reporter Jason Grotto âs  excellent series âThe Tax Divideâ â published in June in the Chicago Tribune and continued this month in collaboration with ProPublica â has laid bare much that is wrong with the property tax assessment system in Cook County: As Kennedy  along with Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and his GOP primary opponent  state Rep. Jeanne Ives  demand Berriosâ head on a pike  pressure increases on Joeâs friends  like  Pritzker .  Pritzker  has money.  He âs built a statewide political organization. If  he  can satisfy the media by issuing proclamations against Trump  why should he fight on Kennedyâs ground? Galia Slayen  the communications director for the Pritzker campaign  notes that  Pritzker  has publicly called out the property tax system. And  she says  the criticisms of her candidate are unfounded. Fair enough. But  Pritzker  isnât running against Rauner now.  He âs not running against Donald Trump either.  He âs running for the Democratic nomination against Chris Kennedy  and property taxes will be the issue. And they will be the issue in the general election. Yet  he  avoids any mention of Berrios  who maintains the system  or Madigan  who benefits  and who can snap  his  fingers and have Joe come running.  Pritzker  has a serious weakness in all this beyond the Berrios on  his  neck.  His  ham-handed decision to seek a property tax reduction for  his  Gold Coast neighborhood mansion will revisit  him .  He  bought the house next door and had the toilets removed so it would be declared an uninhabitable dwelling. Then  he  got a tax break of nearly 230 000 for living next to it.

Abstract: Sequential development of Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes from a noninfective to an infective stage was demonstrated. The generation of infective forms was related to their growth cycle and restricted to stationary stage organisms. Using immunofluorescence techniques, we have noticed that the binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against L. braziliensis (VD5/25) increased progressively as the promastigotes developed in culture and was maximal with the infective forms. This antigenic differentiation was not detected with an anti-L. braziliensis polyclonal rabbit antiserum, suggesting that only a few epitopes, including that recognized by VD5/25, have their expression effectively increased on the surface of infective promastigotes. Immunoprecipitation of lysates of surface-iodinated L. braziliensis promastigotes with this mAb revealed two proteins of apparent 65,000 and 50,000 Mr, the 50,000 Mr protein probably representing the unreduced form of the major surface glycoprotein described in several species of Leishmania (GP65). The increasing expression of this epitope was not found with L. chagasi promastigotes, but seems to occur with the parasites from the L. mexicana complex. Intracellular survival of L. braziliensis was completely inhibited when the infective promastigotes were treated with VD5/25. It appears, therefore, that the increasing expression of GP65 on the promastigote surface represents an essential mechanism of leishmania survival in the macrophage.

The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept.

It was an expression of humans' attitude towards Clark. Just like criminals who are not accepted as 'normal' members of a society and stay behind bars in prisons or lines in this particular case, and treated differently from the rest of the society, Clark was also a stranger, an alien whose intentions or nature wasn't fully understood, so seeing 'behind the line' phrase behind Clark bears that symbolism in my opinion. So you can guess that he would be handed over to Zod. Also note - if we continue our analogy with criminals - that he hasn't been tried/appeared before a judge yet. People see him later in action, and he is judged by his actions, and afterwards accepted as an ally i.e. acquitted. And the reason it was painted over maybe because the rest of the phrase was irrelevant, and also if it said detainees - he is not really a detainee, wasn't detained, he surrendered.

CONTEXT: It's hard to say because most of the camera angles in that scene are taken from the lance side of the knights. Any sheathed weapons, such as swords, would be on the shield side for a crossdraw, and thus away from the camera angle. There is one shot from a falling horse late in the scene where the hilt of a sheathed sword becomes briefly visible. Whether this sword is strapped to the horse (a common means of keeping secondary weapons), or belongs to one of the Scots on the ground, is difficult to determine. On the other hand, non-sheathed weapons such as maces, warhammers and battleaxes tended to be attached via a strap to the belt or trousers on the right hand side. These were common secondary weapons for knights, and we should be able to see some of them in the scene, but none are visible. Chances are you are correct, and these weapons were not included as part of the cavalry equipment. Most likely this was done to reduce the cost of filming. After all, the knights get slaughtered in the scene and we don't see any scenes where they get to fight back after falling from their horses, so these weapons are redundant from a filming standpoint.  <sep>  Q: Are the cavalry knights missing close melee weapons in Braveheart?

The Food and Drug Administration cleared a near-copy of the drug, dubbed Amjevita, developed by Amgen Inc. Regulators approved the drug for more than a half-dozen conditions listed on the original drug’s label, including severe psoriasis and Crohn’s diseases. Humira posted sales of nearly 15 billion in 2015 and was for many years the top-selling prescription drug in the world, according to data from IMS Health. It’s the fourth time that the FDA has formally approved a so-called biosimilar, the industry term for a lower-cost version of a biotech drug. Biosimilar drugs, long available in Europe, are thought to have the potential to generate billions in savings for the U.S. health system. But currently only one biosimilar cleared by the FDA approval pathway is actually on the market in the U.S., Novartis’ Zarxio, an alternative to Amgen’s Neupogen that sells for about 15 percent less than the original product. The drug helps boost red blood cells in cancer patients. Amgen did not discuss plans for the drug’s launch or price in a release issued Friday evening. But Wall Street analysts have noted that AbbVie claims it holds patents protecting Humira until at least 2022. They have previously estimated that Amgen’s version could launch sometime between 2018 and 2022, depending on the outcome of court litigation. First approved in 2002, Humira accounted for 60 percent of AbbVie’s total revenue last year. The injectable drug, which blocks chemicals linked to inflammation, is part of a family of biotech drugs including Enbrel and Remicade, which are also facing pending biosimilar competition. Development of lower-cost anti-inflammatory drugs is considered pivotal in reducing U.S. spending on specialty drugs, which has doubled to 150 billion since 2010, according to IMS Health. Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen is itself a biotech powerhouse, and it too has medications facing competition from cheaper versions. The company is working to hedge those loses by developing lower-cost versions of competitors’ drugs. AbbVie Inc. is based in North Chicago, Illinois.

Some germs can live up to a week on surfaces they infect. It is best to keep hands washed, and surfaces sterile to kill germs. Germs can stay alive in air for up to 48 hours after leaving an infected person or animal. Flu viruses can also survive as droplets in the air for several hours; low temperatures increase their survival in the air. Parainfluenza virus, which causes croup in children, can survive for up to 10 hours on hard surfaces and up to four hours on soft surfaces. Stomach bugs. There are many germs that can cause a stomach bug. Generally, MRSA bacteria survive for longer on hard surfaces than on soft surfaces. Herpes. Herpes viruses from cold sores around the mouth can survive for two hours on the skin. If you have a cold sore, try not to touch it. If you do touch it, for example to apply cold sore cream, wash your hands immediately afterwards. How long germs can live outside the body depends on the type of bacteria or virus and what kind of surface they are on.

I (21, F) wouldn’t be happy to call the other person, we’ll call her Jan (23, F) in this scenario “the asshole” or the person in the wrong, bc I truly believe she isn’t. I just don’t know if my behavior makes me an asshole. I recently moved in with a dear friend of mine (my best friend, really. All that lame girl shit: planning to be each other’s maids of honors, etc.) into a city she’s been living in for a while. It’s been pretty lonely, I’m not sure how to make new friends.. Jan’s really busy, working the work week and having extensive plans during the weekends with friends, keeping up with hobbies, etc. I was always excited to see jan when she came home, trying to squeeze in a few moments to chat or maybe watch something together. We’re both pretty “silly” people and so I thought we had a running bit about me play-annoying her. She loves the frozen franchise so I would knock on her door and sing the do you want to build a snowman song. I have a chronic pain disorder, so I warned her that when I moved in I might keep to myself more than she’d expect. Which I do. But she’s maybe in our apartment for an hour or two a day when she’s not asleep or has her door closed doing other things, etc, and she is my only true person to really see in person to hang out with. So, the other night, I was trying to chat with her about her day while she folded laundry in our kitchen and she said “remember when you said you were gonna keep to yourself mostly laughter I was looking forward to that.” And I said “I’m ... sorry?” And Jan replied “well I’m just trying to get some laundry done and here you are...” And I stepped back from the situation and apologized for bothering her while she was trying to get something done, because she was right. If she only has a bit of time to accomplish task while she’s home, it’s unfair of me to try and monopolize it for myself. It’s no fault of hers that I’m having a difficult time trying to make some new friends. I told her I’d be better at leaving her alone, and went into my room for the night. I miss her, but I decided not to bother her so I haven’t. I’ve really only seen her when she sought out to see me.  We’re from the same hometown, and she left earlier this week to visit her family for Thanksgiving. We had a rather awkward exchange about it this week, as she has complained rather frequently about going home for the holidays because of her extended family not being her favorite company. My birthday is around the holiday, so for the last two years we’ve spent thanksgiving together, so she kept mentioning that she hasn’t seen them in a while because of me, so she was going to go anyway. After weeks of this, on Tuesday I asked her to please stop complaining about going home to me, because my Thanksgiving plans included working many long hard hours (work in a Bakery) up until the day, and then going home at about 1 pm to be in an empty apartment by myself. She replied “well, you could have asked me to stay back with you.” But I don’t really feel I could have. She told me she “always” planned on coming back on Saturday “just for your birthday.” My birthday is on Saturday but I got off from work so i decided I take the train to our hometown tomorrow morning. she keeps texting me asking what my plans are. I’ve responded honestly, that I’d like to spend it with my parents and my brother, being with my dogs at home, and she’s welcome to join us, and to come over whenever if she’d like. I won’t really have gifts this year, and I don’t plan on making a big deal out of it. It’s just nice to have a weekend off from work. She’s acting as if I’m avoiding her or being rude, and not making a specific plan is inconvenient for her. I told her if she’s busy she can pick a time and maybe a place for lunch or something and I’ll meet her there. This only seemed to upset her more? My birthday was never a big discussion point before the laundry debacle. I think I’ve just made her feel guilty, which wasn’t my goal and I’ve told her that multiple times. But I don’t know if my behavior reflects that.  Tl;dr: my friend told me I’ve been bothering her. I apologized, and stepped back. She’s upset that I don’t have a lot of interest in making specific plans for my birthday, which I wouldn’t ... anyway. AITA? Output:","output":"Not answerable.

There's about a million things that could cause it, but I've never been able to deal with a lot of loud noise.  Generally I can function outside of home, because I know I can't expect the world to change because I'm one of those assholes from A Quiet Place but with less murder and more crying and wanting it to go away. I go through a lot of earplugs, and noise cancelling headphones have probably been one of my best purchases. But continuous noise stresses me out, and compounds on other stresses and even itself.   I've always been like this, so my family knows, and nobody is under the age of ten. But they've never really been willing to quiet down. Any tkme I spend at home is a constant cacaphony of stomping, screaming, shouting, bickering, slamming doors, TVs turned up so loud it's a miracle nobody's got hearing damage, and it never stops. They even scream in the car, and it's a fight to get the volume on anything playing under 50. From 7 AM to past midnight, it's a constant barrage of pointless noise that makes actually spending time with family either very stressful or nearly impossible. I have approached family members asking them to please be more quiet, offering solutions and compromises, but I get told \\"Well OP, the world can't change to suit your needs.\\" And I get that, but I kind of wish that I could at least be met halfway at the family home where I am supposedly always welcome. Last visit, after a screaming match between my mom and my brother, I packed my things and left a day early. I told them I had stuff to take care of at home, job applications to send out, etc, but the real reason was after six days of this I couldn't take it anymore.

Given a scientific question and its correct answer, generate supporting facts for the answer. This supporting fact can be an explanation for the answer to the given question. Question: The substances that comprise heterogeneous mixtures can also be separated by what means? Answer: physical Output:","output":"The substances that make up heterogeneous mixtures can be separated by physical means because they possess distinct physical and chemical properties. The term \\"heterogeneous\\" tells us that the mixture isn't uniform or consistent throughout; instead, it has visible different parts or phases. These differences enable various physical separation methods to be effective. 1. Filtration: This method is used to separate solids from liquids. In heterogeneous mixtures, the different substances may be visible, which makes them easy to filter out. For example, separating tea leaves from the beverage is a simple form of filtration. 2. Centrifugation: If the substances are of different densities, they will separate out when a mixture is spun quickly (centrifuged). With a heterogeneous mixture, the substances will distribute similarly to layers in a drink. Lighter materials will be on top and heavier ones on the bottom. 3. Sedimentation: Similar to centrifugation, this method works by separating substances of different densities. However, instead of spinning the mixture, it's left to sit. Over time, the particles with larger mass will sink to the bottom, while the ones with less mass (or vapor) will remain on top. For example, when you leave a soda bottle untouched, you'll notice that the carbonated liquid is on top and the syrup at the bottom. 4. Distillation: This method is used when there is a liquid mixture and you need to separate it based on boiling points. Heterogeneous mixtures are often composed of liquids with different boiling points. So when heat is applied, substances with lower boiling points vaporize first and can be collected before the substances with higher boiling points. For example, distillation can be used to separate saltwater into salt and pure water. 5. Chromatography: This is a method that separates mixtures by their distribution between a moving phase and a stationary phase. While it's a complex method for handling heterogeneous mixtures, it's effective in separating and analyzing complex mixtures. In conclusion, the substances of a heterogeneous mixture can be separated by various physical methods due to their different properties. These differences can be used to isolate the components, offering insights into the underlying mixtures or substances you are working with."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Given the background description of some cooking related query, summarize the question into a title I have an enameled cast iron dutch oven. I thought the pamphlet that came with it said not to heat the cast iron dry -- I could be imagining things, though.Part OneSo, am I supposed to put the oil in the dutch oven and then put it on the (cold) stove and then turn on the stove to low heat and then to medium? If I do this, will the oil evaporate -- I thought I experienced that once?Or am I supposed to preheat the dutch oven (starting on low and then going to medium) and then throw in the oil and heat it?I'm asking this question because I don't want to ruin my le creuset french oven.Part TwoAnd how do you know when the oil is hot enough? This recipe says until it is almost smoking, but how do you know when it is about to smoke? And don't all oils have different smoke points. This recipe calls for vegetable oil, which I assume can be canola. Output:","output":"Title: \\"Using an Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven: Heating Oil and Preheating\\" Part 1: It's understandable that you're unsure about the correct way to heat your Le Creuset French oven, as the instructions provided with the pamphlet may have been unclear or confusing. To clarify, it is generally recommended to preheat the Dutch oven before adding oil and heating it further. This helps to prevent the oil from burning or smoking, and ensures that it reaches the ideal temperature for cooking. To preheat your Dutch oven, start by placing it on a cold stove and then turning the heat to low. Allow the oven to heat up for a few minutes, until it reaches a medium temperature. Once it has reached a medium heat, you can add the oil and continue to heat it until it's hot enough for cooking. It's important to note that different oils have different smoke points, which is the temperature at which they start to smoke and break down. Vegetable oil, which is often used in cooking, has a relatively low smoke point of around 400°F (200°C). Canola oil, which is a popular choice for cooking, has a slightly higher smoke point of around 468°F (242°C). Part 2: To determine when the oil is hot enough, you can use a few different methods: 1. The Oil Drop Test: Carefully place a small amount of oil in the pan and observe how it behaves. If it sizzles and evaporates quickly, it's ready for cooking. If it doesn't sizzle, it's not yet hot enough. 2. The Smoke Point Method: As mentioned earlier, different oils have different smoke points. Once the oil starts to smoke, it's reached its smoke point and is ready for cooking. Be careful not to overheat the oil, as it can burn and develop harmful compounds. 3. The Temperature Method: Use a thermometer to measure the temperature of the oil. Most cooking oils should be heated to around 325°F - 375°F (165°C - 190°C) for general cooking purposes. It's always a good idea to consult the specific instructions provided with your recipe for the recommended oil temperature, as different dishes may require different temperatures. Additionally, always use a thermometer to ensure that your oil has reached a safe temperature for cooking, as overheating can result in harmful compounds and burnt food."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Abstract: An analysis of 599 clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) patients including all known cases of the southern province of Finland in January 1, 1979 revealed epileptic seizures in 21 (3.5%) patients. On that date, 12 patients needed treatment (2.0%). The age-adjusted prevalence of active epilepsy was significantly higher than that in the general population. The percentage of partial seizures (67%) was significantly increased in proportion to a series of 100 adult epilepsy patients, with a comparable age distribution. In 10 patients (including three patients with symptomatic epilepsy), the attacks appeared before the MS symptoms. The mean follow-up after the first seizures was 19.3 years. In 10 patients, the seizures disappeared totally during the surveillance until September 1985. Our results show an increased comorbidity between MS and epilepsy. In most cases, however, the prognosis of epilepsy was good and there seemed not to be any clear correlation between the severity of MS and epilepsy.

Abstract: Synthetic polycations have been shown to bind and neutralize glomerular polyanions (GPA), thereby increasing the permeability of the glomerular capillary wall (GCW). In the present study it is demonstrated that human platelet-derived cationic proteins (HuPlt CP), which are able to increase cutaneous vascular permeability, bind in vitro to the GCW following incubation of normal human kidney sections with purified HuPlt CP or with washed human platelets stimulated with thrombin, immune complexes (IC) and platelet-activating factor (PAF), or stimulated with a suspension of washed human platelets and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of phagocytable substrate. The antiserum used in immunofluorescence test to detect the binding of HuPlt CP was specific for two different molecular types of HuPlt CP, both with an isoelectric point (pI) of 10.5. Glomerular deposits of HuPlt CP were also detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy in renal glomeruli present in tissue obtained by biopsy from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease in which platelets have been implicated as mediator of glomerular injury. These data indicate that when activated platelets release HuPlt CP in vivo, these proteins bind to glomerular structures. The binding of HuPlt CP to GCW appears to be ionic in nature since heparin, a polyanion, prevents this binding in vitro. In addition, heparin, as well as a high molarity buffer, removed deposits of HuPlt CP bound in vitro to normal GCW or bound in vivo to glomeruli of patients with SLE. The binding of HuPlt CP to GCW is associated with loss of colloidal iron staining, a qualitative technique that demonstrates primarily epithelial cell surface anionic sialoglycoproteins. In experiments of in vitro binding of purified HuPlt CP to section of normal kidney treatment with heparin completely restores the normal pattern of colloidal iron staining suggesting ionic neutralization of GPA. In contrast, heparin is only partially effective in restoring colloidal iron staining in normal kidney sections treated with platelets directly stimulated with IC or PAF or in kidney sections of patients with SLE. These observations indicate that under these conditions the ionic interaction of HuPlt CP with GCW is only partially responsible for the loss of colloidal iron staining. The results of the present study suggest that biologically active polycationic mediators released from stimulated platelets localize in GCW and participate in the induction of glomerular injury.

In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is the non-negative value of that number, without regarding its sign. For example, the absolute value of -2 is 2, and the absolute value of 5 is 5. In this task you will be given a list of numbers and you need to return the element with highest absolute value. If a negative and positive element have the same absolute value you should return the positive element. The absolute value for negative numbers can be found by multiplying them by -1. After finding the element with the maximum absolute value you should return the value of that element before you applied the absolute value.

Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences.

In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. display the ID for those employees who did two or more jobs in the past. Output:","output":"Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a sample SQL query that might fulfill your requirement.

In this task, you are given a abstract of article and corresponding title of an article. Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\". Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in regulating chromatin modifications, gene transcription, mRNA translation, and protein function. We recently reported a high variation in the basal expression levels of a panel of lncRNAs in HeLa and MCF-7 cells and their differential response to DNA damage induction. Here, we hypothesized that lncRNA molecules with different cellular expression may have a differential abundance in secreted exosomes, and their exosome levels would reflect cellular response to DNA damage. MALAT1, HOTAIR, lincRNA-p21, GAS5, TUG1, CCND1-ncRNA in exosomes secreted from cultured cells were characterized. A different expression pattern of lncRNAs in exosomes was seen compared to cells. RNA molecules with relative low expression levels (lincRNA-p21, HOTAIR, ncRNA-CCND1) were highly enriched in exosomes. TUG1 and GAS5 levels were moderately elevated in exosomes, whereas MALAT1--which was the most abundant molecule in cells--was present at levels comparable to its cellular levels. lincRNA-p21 and ncRNA-CCND1 were the main molecules; exosome levels of them best reflect the change of their cellular levels upon exposure of the cells to bleomycin-induced DNA damage. In conclusion, we provide evidence that lncRNAs have a differential abundance in exosomes, indicating a selective loading.. Title: Long non-coding RNAs with low expression levels in cells are enriched in secreted exosomes. Output:","output":"Yes, the title accurately reflects the content of the article. The study described in the article found that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with low expression levels in cells were enriched in secreted exosomes, while lncRNAs with high expression levels in cells had comparable levels in exosomes. The title correctly summarizes this finding, highlighting the differential abundance of lncRNAs in exosomes based on their cellular expression levels."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Answer with text (not indexes). Context: Through the Valley of the Kwai (also published under the titles \\"Miracle on the River Kwai\\" and \\"To End All Wars\\") is the autobiography of a Scottish captain named Ernest Gordon and recounts the experiences of faith and hope of the men held in a Japanese prisoner of war labour camp, building the Burma Railway during the last three and a half years of World War II. , Ernest Gordon ( 31 May 1916 -- 16 January 2002 ) was the former Presbyterian dean of the chapel at Princeton University . A native of Scotland , as an officer in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders , Gordon spent three years in a Japanese prisoner of war ( POW ) camp during the Second World War . He chronicled his experiences on the Death Railway in his book Through the Valley of the Kwai . The book served as an inspiration to the film To End All Wars which opened in 2001 ., To End All Wars is a 2001 war film starring Robert Carlyle, Kiefer Sutherland and Sakae Kimura and directed by David L. Cunningham., The Burma Railway, also known as the Death Railway, the BurmaSiam Railway, the ThailandBurma Railway and similar names, was a railway between Ban Pong, Thailand, and Thanbyuzayat, Burma, built by the Empire of Japan in 1943 to support its forces in the Burma campaign of World War II. This railway completed the rail link between Bangkok, Thailand and Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon). The line was closed in 1947, but the section between Nong Pla Duk and Nam Tok was reopened ten years later in 1957., War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film., A prisoner of war (POW, PoW, PW, P/W, WP, PsW, enemy prisoner of war (EPW) or \\"missing-captured\\") is a person, whether combatant or non-combatant, who is held in custody by a belligerent power during or immediately after an armed conflict. The earliest recorded usage of the phrase \\"prisoner of war\\" dates to 1660., World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history., Subject: ernest gordon, Relation: conflict, Options: (A) atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki (B) captain (C) korean war (D) prisoner of war (E) world war (F) world war ii Output:","output":"From the given context, the subject is Ernest Gordon, and the relation is conflict.

Ernest Gordon was a Scottish captain and served as a prisoner of war during this global conflict. He recounts his experiences during the construction of the Burma Railway in his book \\"Through the Valley of the Kwai.\\" Justification: The other options that may be involved in a conflict like nuclear bombings (A) atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rank (B) captain, specific war (C) Korean War, and prisoner status (D) prisoner of war are too specific to be considered, especially when they are not mentioned in the context to have a direct correlation with Ernest Gordon's experiences. Following the sequence of events, Ernest Gordon's autobiography is primarily about his experiences during World War II, making this the most fitting relation for the subject."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.
