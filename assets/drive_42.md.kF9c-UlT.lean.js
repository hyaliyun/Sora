Here are the steps: 1. **Setting up the problem:**     - The circle (Gamma) has its center (C), and a radius (OP).     - Within (Gamma), there are two smaller semicircles centered at (A) and (B) with radii 1 and 2, respectively, and they intersect (odot P).     - (odot P) is tangent to both of these smaller semicircles and intersects (Gamma) internally. 2. **Applying Stewart's Theorem:**     In triangle (Delta ABP):    [    AB cdot AC cdot BC + AB cdot CP^2 = AC cdot BP^2 + BC cdot AP^2    ]        From the problem:    [    AB = 3, AC = 1, BC = 2,    ]    [    AP = 2 + r, BP = 1 + r, CP = 3 - r,    ]    where (r) is the radius of the small circle (odot P). 3. **Substituting the known values:**    Insert these values into Stewart's equation:    [    3 cdot 1 cdot 2 + 3(3 - r)^2 = 1(1 + r)^2 + 2(2 + r)^2    ]     4. **Simplifying each term:**    [    6 + 3(9 - 6r + r^2) = (1 + 2r + r^2) + 2 (4 + 4r + r^2)    ]    [    6 + 27 - 18r + 3r^2 = 1 + 2r + r^2 + 8 + 8r + 2r^2    ]    Combine like terms:    [    33 - 18r + 3r^2 = 9 + 10r + 3r^2    ] 5. **Cancel like terms (3r^2) on both sides of the equation:**    [    33 - 18r = 9 + 10r    ] 6. **Solving for (r):**    Move the terms involving (r) to one side and constants to the other:    [    33 - 9 = 18r + 10r    ]    [    24 = 28r    ]    Therefore:    [    r = frac{24}{28} = frac{6}{7}    ] # Conclusion: The radius (r) of (odot P) is: [ boxed{frac{6}{7}} ]"},{"instruction":"Expand (3t^3 + 2t^2  4t + 3)(2t^2 + 3t  4).","output":"Using the distributive property, the expansion is given by: [ (3t^3 + 2t^2 - 4t + 3)(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) = 3t^3(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) + 2t^2(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) - 4t(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) + 3(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) ] Calculating each term: [ 3t^3(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) = -6t^5 + 9t^4 - 12t^3 ] [ 2t^2(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) = -4t^4 + 6t^3 - 8t^2 ] [ -4t(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) = 8t^3 - 12t^2 + 16t ] [ 3(-2t^2 + 3t - 4) = -6t^2 + 9t - 12 ] Now, combining like terms: [ -6t^5 + (9-4)t^4 + (-12+6+8)t^3 + (-8-12-6)t^2 + (16+9)t - 12 ] [ boxed{-6t^5 + 5t^4 + 2t^3 - 26t^2 + 25t - 12} ]"},{"instruction":"Find the remainder when 123456 + 123457 + 123458 + 123459 + 123460 + 123461 is divided by 11.","output":"First, we reduce each number modulo 11: [ 123456 equiv 1, quad 123457 equiv 2, quad 123458 equiv 3, quad 123459 equiv 4, quad 123460 equiv 5, quad 123461 equiv 6 pmod{11}. ] Adding these results: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. ] Now, find ( 21 mod 11 ): [ 21 equiv boxed{10} pmod{11}. ]"},{"instruction":"Among all the roots of [ z^6  z^4 + z^2  1 = 0, ] the maximum imaginary part of a root can be expressed as cos phi, where 90^circ le phi le 90^circ.

Find the probability that a raindrop, falling vertically onto the roof at a random location, falls onto the green slope.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:     We are given a triangular pyramid (tetrahedron) where each face is perpendicular to the adjacent face. The faces are painted in three different colors: red, blue, and green. We need to find the probability that a raindrop falling vertically on the roof lands on the green face. 2. **Projection onto the Horizontal Plane**:     The probability of the raindrop landing on any particular face of the pyramid is proportional to the area of the projection of that face onto the horizontal plane. Thus, we need to calculate the projections of all faces onto the horizontal plane and compare their areas. 3. **Denote the Areas**:    Denote the area of the green face by ( S_g ). We need to find the total projection area of all faces onto the base triangle ( RBG ). 4. **Projection Area Calculation**:    - Let ( S ) be the area of the base triangle ( RBG ).    - The projection of the green face on the base is ( S_g cos gamma ), where ( gamma ) is the angle between the green face and the vertical direction.  5. **Projection of All Faces**:    Similarly, for the red and blue faces:    - The area projection of the red face ( S_r ) will be ( S_r cos alpha ), where ( alpha ) is the angle of inclination of the red face.    - The area projection of the blue face ( S_b ) will be ( S_b cos beta ), where ( beta ) is the angle of inclination of the blue face. 6. **Summing the Projections**:    The sum of these projections is equal to the base area, thus:    [    S = S left( cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma right)    ] 7. **Equating the Projections to the Base Area**:    Therefore, we have:    [    cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma = 1    ] 8. **Finding the Specific Probability**:    We need the probability that the raindrop lands on the green face:    [    P(text{green face}) = frac{S_g cos gamma}{S} = cos^2 gamma    ] 9. **Simplify the Expression**:    The term ( cos^2 gamma ) can be found using:    [    cos^2 gamma = 1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta    ] 10. **Conclusion and Final Probability**:     The final probability is:     [     P(text{green face}) = cos^2 gamma = 1 - cos^2 alpha - sin^2 beta     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{1 - sin^2 beta - cos^2 alpha} ]"},{"instruction":"= {  9 ,  7 ,  5 ,  3 , 0, 5 , 7 }  t = {  8 ,  6 ,  2 , 0, 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 } If an integer is to be randomly selected from set m above and an integer is to be randomly selected from set t above, what is the probability that the product of the two integers will be negative?","output":"To find the probability that the product of two integers will be negative, we need to consider the cases where one integer is positive and the other is negative.

The total number of ways to choose one integer from each set is the product of the number of elements in each set, which is 7 * 8 = 56. Now, let's calculate the number of ways to get a negative product: - Choosing a negative integer from m and a positive integer from t:   There are 4 negative integers in m and 4 positive integers in t, so there are 4 * 4 = 16 ways to get a negative product this way. - Choosing a positive integer from m and a negative integer from t:   There are 2 positive integers in m and 3 negative integers in t, so there are 2 * 3 = 6 ways to get a negative product this way. Adding these up, we have 16 + 6 = 22 ways to get a negative product. Therefore, the probability that the product of the two integers will be negative is the number of ways to get a negative product divided by the total number of ways to choose one integer from each set: Probability = Number of negative products / Total number of products Probability = 22 / 56 Probability = 11 / 28 So, the probability that the product of the two integers will be negative is boxed{11/28} ."},{"instruction":"Let the sequence ({a_n}) have a sum of the first (n) terms denoted by (S_n), and it is known that (S_n = 2a_n  2^{n+1} (n in mathbb{N}^*)).

Thus, (frac{a_n}{2^n} - frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}} = 1), indicating that the sequence ({frac{a_n}{2^n}}) is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of (1). Since (S_1 = 2a_1 - 2^2), we have (a_1 = 4). Therefore, (frac{a_n}{2^n} = 2 + (n - 1) = n + 1), which leads to (a_n = (n + 1) cdot 2^n). ((2)) Since (b_n = log_{frac{a_n}{n+1}} 2 = log_{2^n} 2 = frac{1}{n}), then (B_{3n} - B_n = frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n+2} + cdots + frac{1}{3n}).

To prove that ( S_m to infty ) as ( n to infty ), we will proceed with the following steps. 1. **Introduction of Sequence Set ( B_n ) and Induction Basis**:    Define ( B_n ) as the set of sequences with the stated property, meaning ( S_n = |B_n| ). Our goal is to show that ( S_n geq frac{1}{2} S_{n-1} ) for every ( n ).     2. **Inductive Hypothesis**:    Assume for every ( i leq n ), ( S_i geq frac{1}{2} S_{i-1} ). Consequently, it follows that ( S_i leq 2 S_{i-1} ). 3. **Constructing New Sequences**:    Consider the ( 2 S_m ) sequences obtained by appending 0 or 1 to any sequence from ( B_n ). For a given sequence, if it does not belong to ( B_{n+1} ), then for some ( k geq 1 ), it can be formed by extending a sequence from ( B_{n+1-6k} ) by a sequence of ( k ) terms repeated six times. 4. **Counting Invalid Sequences**:    The number of such invalid sequences (repeating blocks) is ( 2^k S_{n+1-6k} ). Therefore, the number of sequences that do not satisfy the condition in ( B_{n+1} ) can be written as:    [    sum_{k geq 1} 2^k S_{n+1-6k}    ] 5. **Bounding Invalid Sequences**:    We want to show that this number is less than ( frac{1}{2} S_n ). Using the induction hypothesis ( S_i leq 2 S_{i-1} ), we get:    [    sum_{k geq 1} 2^k S_{n+1-6k} leq sum_{k geq 1} 2^k left( frac{2}{3} right)^{6k - 1} S_n    ]    Now simplify the sum:    [    = S_n sum_{k geq 1} 2^k left( frac{2}{3} right)^{6k - 1}    ] 6. **Sum Simplification**:    Since ( left( frac{2}{3} right)^6 = frac{64}{729} ) and ( left( frac{2}{3} right)^{-1} = frac{3}{2} ), we have:    [    = S_n sum_{k geq 1} 2^k left( frac{64}{729} right)^k cdot frac{3}{2}    = S_n cdot frac{3}{2} sum_{k geq 1} left( frac{128}{729} right)^k    ]    The geometric series sums to:    [    sum_{k geq 1} left( frac{128}{729} right)^k = frac{frac{128}{729}}{1 - frac{128}{729}} = frac{128}{601}    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{3}{2} S_n cdot frac{128}{601} = frac{192}{601} S_n < frac{1}{2} S_n    ] 7. **Conclusion**:    Consequently, we have:    [    S_{n+1} geq 2 S_n - frac{1}{2} S_n = frac{3}{2} S_n    ]    By induction, we conclude that:    [    S_n geq left( frac{3}{2} right)^m    ]    This implies that ( S_n to infty ) as ( n to infty ).

The terminal side of angle alpha passes through P(-1,2), which means we can use the coordinates of P to find the cosine of angle alpha.  The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. In the coordinate system, we can think of the x-coordinate as the length of the adjacent side to the angle at the origin, and the distance from the origin to the point P as the hypotenuse.  The distance from the origin to the point P is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which in this case gives us the hypotenuse as sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{1 + 4} = sqrt{5}.

We will use the properties of permutations and the given operations to derive the solution. 1. **Define the Operations:**    - We start with the sequence ( S = {1, 2, ldots, 2007} ).    - We perform 22 consecutive steps on ( S ):      - For ( 1 leq i leq 11 ), we choose a number ( x ) from ( S ) and replace it with ( x + a_i ).      - For ( 12 leq i leq 22 ), we choose a number ( x ) from ( S ) and replace it with ( x - a_{i-11} ). 2. **Understand the Permutations:**    - A permutation of ( {1, 2, ldots, 2007} ) is even if the product ( prod_{i > j} (x_i - x_j) ) is positive, and odd if it is negative.    - The operations described will result in a permutation of the original sequence ( S ). 3. **Observation and Proof:**    - Let ( b_j = a_j ) for ( 1 leq j leq 11 ) and ( b_j = -a_{j-11} ) for ( 12 leq j leq 22 ).    - If two elements become equal after adding ( b_1, ldots, b_l ), the total contribution of ( b_1, ldots, b_l ) at these fixed spots is 0.    - Suppose after some steps, ( s_i = s_j ). The sums of the added values to ( s_i ) and ( s_j ) must be equal, implying that the sequence is not a permutation of ( {1, ldots, 2007} ). 4. **Inductive Argument:**    - If ( a_i ) is added to ( s_j ) and ( s_j + a_i leq 2007 ), we can assume the moves are ordered such that ( a_i ) is added to ( s_j ) first.    - This implies that ( a_1 ) cannot be added to ( 1, ldots, 2007 - a_1 ), then ( a_2 ) cannot be added to ( 1, ldots, 2007 - a_2 ), and so on.    - After a number gets added, it must be subtracted because otherwise, it would exceed 2007. 5. **Reordering Moves:**    - Reorder the moves such that ( a_1 ) is added first, and the second move is subtracting the number that ( a_1 ) was added to.    - If the second move is ( -a_1 ), the two moves cancel out.    - If the second move is ( -a_2 ), the new number is ( x + a_1 - a_2 ). Since ( x + a_1 > 2007 ), it is positive, and since ( a_1 < a_2 ), the new number is less than ( x ), making two numbers equal, resulting in a contribution of 0. 6. **Counting the Operations:**    - There are ( a_1 ) places to perform this operation, namely ( 2007 - a_1 + 1, ldots, 2007 ).    - By induction, adding and subtracting ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_k ) gives a total contribution of ( prod_{j=2}^k a_j ) ways, leading to ( prod_{j=1}^k a_j ) ways. 7. **Conclusion:**    - Since the base case can be easily verified, the conclusion follows that the number of odd operations and even operations are equal. The final answer is (boxed{0}) (the difference between the number of odd and even operations)."},{"instruction":"One fourth of one third of two fifth of a number is 16.

We have the following diagram illustrating the relationship of the segments:    ![Diagram](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_93a6e15d2af204a746f1g-1.jpg?height=353&width=331&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=886) 3. According to the theorem of parallel intercepts (often known as the intercept theorem or Thales' theorem), we can write the relationship between the segments as:    [    frac{e}{b} = frac{a}{d}    ]    Solving for (d), the length of the product segment, we get:    [    d = frac{a cdot b}{e}    ] 4. In this context, (e) represents the unit segment, and (d) is the corresponding length of the product segment. 5. Observe what happens if we reduce the unit segment (e) to half its length, denoting the new unit segment by (e' = frac{e}{2}). 6. Substituting the new unit segment (e') into our previous equation, we have:    [    d' = frac{a cdot b}{e'}    ]    Since (e' = frac{e}{2}), the equation becomes:    [    d' = frac{a cdot b}{frac{e}{2}} = frac{a cdot b}{e} cdot 2 = 2 cdot frac{a cdot b}{e}    ]    Thus:    [    d' = 2d    ] 7. Therefore, when we halve the unit segment, the length of the product segment doubles. Conversely, if we double the length of the unit segment, the length of the product segment will be halved. 8. Conclusion: The length of the product segment changes in inverse proportion to the change in the unit segment's length. Hence, if the unit segment is halved, the product segment becomes twice as long.     [    boxed{d' = 2d}    ]"},{"instruction":"A lecture was given for 90 minutes to an audience of 200 people.

This transformation will allow us to think of any subsequence of consecutive children in a simpler, more mathematically tractable way. 2. **Identify all possible groups of 30 consecutive children:**    We need to look at all possible groups of 30 consecutive children. We will call these groups \\"units.\\" Each unit contains 15 boys and 15 girls. 3. **Utilize the given condition:**    According to the problem, there is exactly one unit of 30 consecutive children in which the number of boys is equal to the number of girls. This means we have a unit with 15 boys and 15 girls. 4. **Derive properties of neighboring units:**    If we move from one unit to the next, replacing the first child of the previous unit with the next child in the circle, the number of boys can either stay the same, increase by 1, or decrease by 1. Since the total number of boys and girls is fixed, moving around the circle ensures that if we start at a unit with an equal number of boys and girls, we will eventually return to this balance after passing various imbalances. 5. **Prove the existence of a balanced group of 70 children:**    Suppose we have several groups of 30 children, each starting at a different position in the circle. As we know, one of these groups contains 15 boys and 15 girls. By moving to the next unit consecutively, we note the difference in the number of boys in each unit changes steadily by 1 or remains unchanged. 6. **Use intermediate value theorem concept:**    By the pigeonhole principle, since we start at a group with exactly 15 boys and 15 girls and must return to another balanced group after some movements, we are guaranteed to find at least one other group of 30 children with exactly 15 boys and 15 girls as we continue along the circle. 7. **Reconstructing the line arrangement from the circular arrangement:**    By cutting the circle at any place (transforming it back into a linear arrangement), any two units of 30 children that were found to be balanced in the circle (due to the nature of the transformation) would imply that one such unit necessarily gets \\"split\\" to create a new valid segment of 70 consecutive children. This new segment will still have an equal number of boys and girls. 8. **Conclusion:**    From the above logical steps, there must exist a consecutive group of 70 children (in the initial line arrangement) such that the number of boys and girls is the same.

We denote the slope of line l as k and assume k>0 for simplicity. The equation of line l can be expressed as y=k(x+c), which rearranges to kx-y+kc=0. 1. **Tangent to Circle Condition**: The distance from the center of the circle to the line l equals the radius of the circle, which gives us the equation frac{|kc|}{sqrt{k^2+1}}=a. Solving this for k yields k=frac{a}{b}. 2. **Perpendicularity to Asymptote**: The product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is -1. Given the slope of the asymptote y=-frac{b}{a}x is -frac{b}{a}, and the slope of line l is frac{a}{b}, their product is indeed -frac{b}{a} times frac{a}{b} = -1, confirming that line l is perpendicular to the asymptote. 3. **Triangle OAB Analysis**: With |AB|=sqrt{3}a and |OA|=a, and knowing OA perp AB, we deduce that |OB|=2a by the Pythagorean theorem. This leads to angle AOB=frac{pi}{3}. 4. **Slope of Asymptote and Angle Relationship**: Given the angle angle AOB=frac{pi}{3}, the slope of the asymptote line y=frac{b}{a}x (or line OB) corresponds to angles frac{pi}{3} or frac{pi}{6}, implying frac{b}{a}=sqrt{3} or frac{b}{a}=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. 5. **Eccentricity Calculation**: The eccentricity e of the hyperbola is defined as e=frac{c}{a}. Using the relationship c^2=a^2+b^2, we find e=sqrt{1+(frac{b}{a})^2}. Substituting the values of frac{b}{a} from step 4, we get e=sqrt{1+3}=2 or e=sqrt{1+frac{1}{3}}=frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}.

For any triangle A B_k B_{k+1}, where 0 leq k leq 3, we can calculate its perimeter, P(k), using the formula: [ P(k) = 1 + sqrt{10^2 + k^2} + sqrt{10^2 + (k+1)^2}. ] This formula comes from adding the base of the small triangle, which is 1 inch, to the lengths of the two sides, which are calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

Here, one leg is the height of the isosceles triangle, which is 10 inches, and the other leg is the horizontal distance from A to B_k or B_{k+1}. Given that P(k) increases as k increases, we find that the largest perimeter among the 8 pieces will be when k = 3.

We use the properties of an arithmetic sequence, particularly focusing on the sum of its terms. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is denoted by S_{n}.  Given that S_{3} = 9 and S_{6} = 36, we can consider the differences between successive sums to track how the sequence progresses. Specifically, we look at S_{3}, S_{6} - S_{3}, and S_{9} - S_{6}. These differences help us understand the increments in the sum of terms of the sequence, which themselves form an arithmetic sequence. Given Information: - S_{3} = 9 - S_{6} = 36 implies S_{6} - S_{3} = 36 - 9 = 27 From the property that these sums form an arithmetic sequence, we can deduce: - S_{3}, 27, and S_{9} - S_{6} are consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence. Knowing two consecutive differences allows us to find the next difference in the sequence because the difference between these sums must be consistent. Since the increase from S_{3} to S_{6} is by 27, the pattern suggests that S_{9} - S_{6} should also increase by the same amount, maintaining the property of an arithmetic sequence. Therefore: - S_{9} - S_{6} = 27 + (S_{6} - S_{3}) = 27 + 27 = 54 However, we are tasked with finding a_{7} + a_{8} + a_{9}, not S_{9} - S_{6}. There seems to be a mistake in the calculation reinterpretation based on the previous explanation. To correct the approach in line with the original solution: Since S_{3} = 9, S_{6} - S_{3} = 36 - 9 = 27, the next term in the sequence by this pattern should be 45 (since 27 is the common difference in the sums, but this interpretation was incorrect in the calculation step).  Correcting the approach: - The correct interpretation from the arithmetic progression relationship is that since S_{3} = 9 and S_{6} - S_{3} = 27, the increment to find S_{9} - S_{6} keeps the sequence's consistency, leading to S_{9} - S_{6} = 45 by maintaining the arithmetic progression property directly from the given solution without implying an additional term.

Note that the only primes dividing numbers in the set ({n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5}) can be 2, 3, or 5 because any larger prime would only divide one number in the set and hence only one product. For example, a prime greater than 5 would only appear once in the set. 2. **Counting Multiples of 2:**    In any set of six consecutive integers, exactly three of them are even (multiples of 2). 3. **Counting Multiples of 3:**    Every set of six consecutive integers will contain exactly two multiples of 3. 4. **Counting Multiples of 5:**    Every set of six consecutive integers will contain exactly one multiple of 5. 5. **Examine the Structure and Prime Factors:**     - Since there are three even numbers, one of the subsets will have an even product unless each subset has an equal product from the combination of the primes 2, 3, and 5.     - We need to see if it's possible to partition the set into two subsets where each subset has the same prime factorization. However, the prime factor 5 appears only once, making this problematic. 6. **Check the Smallest Positive Integers:**     - Let us first suppose that ( n = 1 ). Then the set is ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}).     - To partition ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) into two subsets with equal product is not possible since the number 5 appears only once and one of the products must be divisible by 5, making it impossible to balance the products.     - Verifying this for any ( n ):       For ( n > 1 ), the situation becomes worse as the numbers increase and introduce more prime factors, complicating the equality of the partition. 7. **General Case:**     - The general rule holds true: the presence of the single factor of large primes (like 5 or larger primes if ( n ) is large) makes it impossible to partition six consecutive numbers into two subsets with the same product. **Conclusion:** Through the analysis, we observe that no such ( n ) exists where the set ({n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5}) can be partitioned into two subsets with equal product, hence no solution: [ boxed{text{No such } n text{ exists}} ]"},{"instruction":"length of a rectangular plot is 14 mtr more than its breadth . if the cost of fencing the plot at 26.50 per meter is rs . 5300 , what is the length of the plot in mtr ?","output":"Let's denote the breadth of the plot as ( b ) meters.

Let the first term and common ratio of the positive geometric sequence {a_n} be a_1 and q, respectively. From the given conditions, we can derive equations about these two quantities. Solving them gives the general formula of the sequence and expressions for a_1+a_2+ldots+a_n and a_1a_2ldots a_n. Simplifying these expressions yields an inequality about n, solving which gives the range of n. The upper limit's integer part is the answer.      Let the first term and common ratio of the positive geometric sequence {a_n} be a_1 and q, respectively.   From the given conditions, we have begin{cases}a_1q^4= frac{1}{2}  a_1q^5(1+q)=3end{cases}, solving this gives a_1= frac{1}{32}, q=2,   Thus, the general formula is a_n= frac{1}{32} ×2^{n−1} =2^{n-6}.   Let T_n=a_1+a_2+ldots+a_n=frac{ frac{1}{32}(1-2^n)}{1-2} =frac{2^n-1}{2^5},   S_n=a_1a_2ldots a_n=2^{-5}×2^{-4}ldots×2^{n-6}=2^{frac{(n-11)n}{2}}.   From the given condition, T_n > S_n, i.e., frac{2^n-1}{2^5} > 2^{frac{1}{2}n^2-frac{11}{2}n+5},   Simplifying gives: 2^n-2^{frac{1}{2}n^2-frac{11}{2}n+5} > 1,   Thus, we need n > frac{1}{2} n^2-frac{11}{2} n+5, i.e., n^2-13n+10 < 0   Solving this gives frac{13- sqrt{129}}{2} < n < frac{13+ sqrt{129}}{2},   Since n is a positive integer, the maximum value of n is the integer part of frac{13+ sqrt{129}}{2}, which is 12.

The points ( D ) and ( E ) lie on segments ( AC ) and ( AB ) respectively, such that ( OD parallel AB ) and ( OE parallel AC ). It can be understood that ( AO = AD + AE ).    2.

To maximize (frac{10a + b}{a + b}), we need to minimize (frac{9b}{a + b}). The fraction (frac{9b}{a + b}) reaches its minimum value when (b = 0) because (b) appears only in the numerator of (frac{9b}{a + b}). 5. When (b = 0), we get: [ frac{10a}{a} = 10 ] 6.

First, let's analyze how the input to the sine function, 2x + frac{pi}{6}, changes over the interval [t, t+2]: - The minimum value of the input occurs at x = t, giving 2t + frac{pi}{6}. - The maximum value of the input occurs at x = t + 2, giving 2t + 4 + frac{pi}{6}. Thus, the interval for 2x + frac{pi}{6} as x varies over [t, t+2] is [2t + frac{pi}{6}, 2t + 4 + frac{pi}{6}]. For f(x) to achieve its full range of [-1, 1], the interval [2t + frac{pi}{6}, 2t + 4 + frac{pi}{6}] must include points where the sine function reaches both its maximum and minimum values, which occur at odd multiples of frac{pi}{2} and even multiples of pi, respectively. Let's examine how the choice of t influences this: - When t = 0, the interval is [frac{pi}{6}, 4 + frac{pi}{6}]. This interval starts after 0 and ends before pi, so it may miss a minimum. - When t = 1, the interval is [2 + frac{pi}{6}, 6 + frac{pi}{6}]. This starts after pi and does not extend to 2pi, possibly missing a maximum. - When t = 2, the interval is [4 + frac{pi}{6}, 8 + frac{pi}{6}]. This range is broad enough to include both a maximum and minimum of the sine function, thereby satisfying the requirement that f(x) achieves its full range of [-1, 1].

For 30 bottles of peanut oil and 10 bottles of corn oil, the total cost is 1900 yuan: 30x + 10y = 1900. Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: First, we can multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficient of y in both equations the same: - 30x + 10y = 1900 becomes 90x + 30y = 5700.

Substituting x = 50 into the first original equation: - 20(50) + 30y = 2200, - Simplifying, we get 1000 + 30y = 2200, - Solving for y, we find 30y = 1200, - Thus, y = 40.

So, the relative speed of the two trains is: 60 kmph - 40 kmph = 20 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second, we use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s: 20 kmph * (5/18) = (20 * 5) / 18 = 100 / 18 ≈ 5.56 m/s Now, let's denote the length of each train as L meters. Since the trains are of equal length, the total distance to be covered when they cross each other is 2L meters. The time taken to cross each other while running in the same direction is given as 60 seconds. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed 60 seconds = 2L / 5.56 m/s From this, we can calculate the length of each train (L): 2L = 60 seconds * 5.56 m/s 2L = 333.6 meters L = 333.6 / 2 L = 166.8 meters Now, when the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds: 60 kmph + 40 kmph = 100 kmph Converting this speed into meters per second: 100 kmph * (5/18) = (100 * 5) / 18 ≈ 27.78 m/s The distance to be covered when they cross each other is still 2L meters.

Therefore:    - The sum of two odd numbers or two even numbers is even.    - The sum of an odd number and an even number is odd. 4. **Counting the Number of Each Type of Sum:**    Observing the sums:    - The total number of sums a_i + a_j where i neq j is binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2}.    - The sums that will be odd are exactly those where we add an even and an odd number, i.e., k even numbers paired with n-k odd numbers, resulting in k(n - k) odd sums. 5. **Using Given that m is Even:**    Since m = frac{1}{2}n(n-1) is even, we have that the number of odd sums is half the total number of sums:    [    2k(n-k) = m = frac{1}{2} n(n-1)    ]     6. **Forming a Quadratic Equation:**    Rearranging the equality 2k(n - k) = frac{1}{2} n(n-1):    [    4k(n-k) = n(n-1)    ]    [    4kn - 4k^2 = n^2 - n    ]    [    4k^2 - 4kn + n^2 - n = 0    ]    We get the quadratic equation:    [    4k^2 - 4nk + n(n-1) = 0    ] 7. **Recognizing the Properties of the Quadratic Equation:**    This can be identified for discriminant analysis. The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation:    [    Delta = (4n)^2 - 4 cdot 4 cdot n(n-1)     ]    [    Delta = 16n^2 - 16n(n-1)     ]    [    Delta = 16n^2 - 16n^2 + 16n     ]    [    Delta = 16n     ] 8. **Implicating the Condition for n:**    We observe:    [    Delta = 16n     ]    which must be a perfect square. Hence:    [    16n = k^2     ]    where k is an integer. Therefore, for 16n to be a perfect square, n itself must be a perfect square (since 16 is already a perfect square). If n = t^2 for some integer t, then 16t^2 = k^2 implies k = 4t, confirming n must be a perfect square. # Conclusion: boxed{n text{ is a perfect square}}"},{"instruction":"When the shuttlecocks were distributed equally to 24 students in Yunsu's class, 19 shuttlecocks were distributed to each student and there were no shuttlecocks left.

We will tackle each part separately.  Part (a): We need to construct a sequence ( {a_n} ) of natural numbers such that: 1. No term in the sequence is equal to the sum of some other terms in the sequence. 2. For all ( n ), it holds that ( a_n le n^{10} ). 1. **Constructing the Sequence**:    - We start by constructing the sequence ( {a_n} ) in a manner ensuring that no term in the sequence equals the sum of any other terms.    - Define another sequence ( {b_m} ) where ( b_m = 10^{5^{m-2}} ) for all natural numbers ( m geq 2 ). This gives us values such as ( b_2 = 10 ), ( b_3 = 10^5 ), ( b_4 = 10^{25} ), and so on. 2. **Defining \\"Packs\\"**:    - We construct the sequence ( {a_n} ) in \\"packs\\". For the first pack, take the single number ( 1 ).    - For ( m geq 2 ), each pack consists of an arithmetic progression with the first term ( 2b_m + 1 ), a common difference ( 2b_m ), and the number of terms equaling ( frac{b_m^2}{2} ). Thus the sequence for pack ( m ) is ( 2b_m + 1, 4b_m + 1, ldots, b_m^3 + 1 ). 3. **Ensuring the Sum Property**:    - Calculate the sum for each pack. The sum of the terms in the ( m )-th pack is given by:      [      frac{(2b_m + 1) + (b_m^3 + 1)}{2} cdot frac{b_m^2}{2} = frac{b_m^5 + 2b_m^3 + 2b_m^2}{4} < frac{b_m^5}{2} < b_m^5 - b_m = b_{m+1} - b_m      ]    - Sum of numbers in packs from 1 to ( m ) is:      [      1 + (b_3 - b_2) + ldots + (b_{m+1} - b_m) = b_{m+1} - b_2 + 1 < b_{m+1}      ]    - Therefore, the sum of any subset of terms in the sequence constructed thus far is less than any subsequent term in the next pack. 4. **Proof by Contradiction**:    - Assume that a number ( a ) in pack ( m > 2 ) is a sum of other terms in the constructed sequence.    - Note that the sum of all terms up to ( m )-th pack is less than ( b_m ), and since ( a geq 2b_m + 1 ), ( a ) cannot be in the previously constructed terms.    - We would then have:      [      a = c_1 + c_2 + ldots + c_k + d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_l quad (k > b_m)      ]    - Due to the sum properties established earlier, this would imply:      [      a - r = (c_1 - 1) + (c_2 - 1) + ldots + (c_k - 1)      ]    - Each ( c_i - 1 ) is divisible by ( 2b_m ), leading to contradiction because ( r ) would incorrectly match up to be 1 modulo ( 2b_m ). 5. **Choosing Upper Bound**:    - Also verify ( a_n leq 100 n^{3.5} ) is true for the values provided in the pack construction. 6. **Completeness**:    - Proof for ( a_n le n^{10} ) has been verified for base cases and through induction for ( n > 2 ). Thus, the sequence ( {a_n} ) exists. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{Exists}} ]  Part (b): We are given that (a_n le nsqrt{n}) for all ( n ). Let's prove if at least one term in the sequence can equal the sum of several others. 1. **Illustrating Impossibility**:    - Suppose we want ( {a_n} ) such that ( a_n < 100 n^{1.5} ) and no ( a_n ) equals the sum of several others in the sequence.    - Consider indexing a rectangular table with ( 10^{30} ) rows and ( 10^{18} ) columns. Each cell entry ( c_{nk} ) is defined as:      [      c_{nk} = sum_{i=1}^k a_i + a_n      ]    - The maximum value in this table will be less than:      [      sum_{i=1}^{10^{18}} a_i + a_{2 times 10^{30}} < 100 (10^{18.5} times 10^{18}) + 100 (10^{30})^{1.5} times 2^{1.5} < 4 times 10^{47}      ] 2. **Using Pigeonhole Principle**:    - As there are ( 10^{48} ) numbers, each less than ( 4 times 10^{47} ), by the pigeonhole principle, there will be at least two identical ( c_{nk} ):      [      c_{nk} = c_{ml}      ]    - Assume ( n ne m ). Without loss of generality, consider ( n > m ). This leads us to:      [      left(sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i right) + a_n = left(sum_{i=1}^{l} a_i right) + a_m implies a_n = sum_{i=k+1}^{l} a_i + a_m      ] Therefore, the construction that no ( a_n ) equals the sum of other elements is violated. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{Does not exist}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let PQRS be a convex quadrilateral, and let G_P, G_Q, G_R, G_S denote the centroids of triangles QRS, PRS, PQS, and PQR, respectively.

We'll proceed via induction on (n).  Base Cases: - For (n = 1), it’s trivial, as the only group is ({1}), and (m = 1). - For (n = 2), we have (1 + 2 = 3 = 3 times 1), so (m = 3), (k = 1). Trivially, ({1, 2}) forms one group of sum (3).  Induction Step: Assume the statement is true for (n' < n) and consider the case of (n). **1. Case when (n) is odd:** If (n) is odd, notice: [ n = 1 + 2 + cdots + n  ] can form pairs such that each pair sums to (n + 1): [ n = (n-1) + 1 = (n-2) + 2 = cdots = frac{n+1}{2} + frac{n-1}{2} ] Hence, the result is true for (m = n) and (k = frac{n+1}{2}). **2. Case when (n) is even:** If (n) is even, note that: [ n = (n-1) + 1 + (n-2) + 2 + cdots = left(frac{n}{2}right) + left(frac{n}{2} + 1right) = m ] Thus, (k = frac{n}{2}).  General Case for (m > n) and (2n > m > n+1): For odd (m), we have sums such as: [ m = n + (m-n) = (n-1) + (m-n+1) = cdots = left(frac{m+1}{2}right) + left(frac{m-1}{2}right) ] This uses up the numbers (m-n, m-n+1, ldots, n) to form sums of (m). By induction, the remaining numbers (1, 2, ldots, m-n-1) can be grouped to form remaining sums of (m).  For even (m): Similarly, we have sums such as: [ m = n + (m-n) = (n-1) + (m-n+1) = cdots = left(frac{m}{2}right) + left(frac{m}{2}right) ] This leaves us with integers (1, 2, ldots, m-n-1) that can form sums of (frac{m}{2}). Including (frac{m}{2}), we can form sums of (m).  Finally, consider (m geq 2n): We can form (k) sums such as: [ 2n - 2k + 1 = n + (n - 2k + 1) = (n - 1) + (n - 2k + 2) = cdots = (n - k + 1) + (n - k) ] The remaining integers (1, 2, ldots, n - 2k) can be proven by induction to form (k) sums if (m - (2n - 2k + 1) geq n - 2k). Eventually deriving adequate conditional inequalities confirms this is true:  [ (m - 2n)(m - n - 1) geq 0 text{ is true under given constraints.} ] Hence, we conclude that each number (1, 2, ldots, n) can indeed be divided into (k) groups where each group sums to (m).

A walking distance pharmacy is defined as a pharmacy that can be reached by walking no more than 3 km along the streets. The Ministry of Health wants to install pharmacies on some squares so that any person walking along any street, regardless of the direction of travel, will get closer to a walking distance pharmacy. Is it enough to have 12 pharmacies for this purpose?","output":"1. **Setup the Problem**:     - We have a grid of 9 times 9 formed by 10 parallel streets running north-south and 10 parallel streets running west-east.     - Each intersection on the grid corresponds to one of the 100 squares (intersections) formed.     - The distance between two adjacent intersections is 1 km.     - Walking distance accessibility implies being able to reach a location within 3 km along the grid lines. 2. **Determine Walking Range**:     - From any given intersection, a person can walk up to 3 km in any direction (north, south, west, or east).      - This means each pharmacy will be accessible to all intersections within a 7 times 7 square centered on the pharmacy (since 3 intersections in each direction plus the center). 3. **Calculate Total Intersections**:     - We have 10 times 10 = 100 intersections.     - Each intersection can be characterized by its position and direction of movement. This results in 2 possible directions (either up-down or left-right), making the total characterizations 2 times 10 times 9 = 180 possible street segments by direction. 4. **Coverage per Pharmacy**:     - A pharmacy covers a 7 times 7 grid, which includes 49 intersections for every direction.

Specifically, an edge ( (v_i, v_j) in E ) means that persons ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) know each other. 2. **Maximal Clique:**    Let ( A ) be a subset of ( V ) that forms a maximal clique in ( G ). This means that every pair of vertices in ( A ) is connected by an edge, and no additional vertex can be added to ( A ) without losing this property. 3. **Vertices outside the clique ( A ):**    Consider vertices ( x ) and ( y ) that are not in ( A ), i.e., ( x, y in V setminus A ). 4. **Proof by Contradiction:**    Assume for contradiction that ( x ) and ( y ) are connected by an edge, i.e., ( (x, y) in E ). 5. **Non-Adjacent Vertex:**    Because ( A ) is maximal, there must be at least one vertex in ( A ) that is not adjacent to ( x ). If all vertices in ( A ) were adjacent to ( x ), we could add ( x ) to ( A ), which would contradict the maximality of ( A ). The same logic applies to ( y ), meaning there is at least one vertex in ( A ) that is not adjacent to ( y ). 6. **Set ( B ):**    Define ( B subseteq A ) to be the set of vertices in ( A ) that are not adjacent to both ( x ) and ( y ). Since ( A ) is maximal, ( B ) is non-empty. 7. **Minimal Size of ( B ):**    Suppose ( B ) has only one vertex, ( z ). Then, all other vertices in ( A ) are adjacent to either ( x ) or ( y ). By removing ( z ) from ( A ) and adding ( x ) and ( y ) to ( A ), ( A ) remains a clique, which contradicts the maximality of ( A ). Therefore, ( B ) must contain at least two vertices. 8. **Vertices ( z ) and ( w ):**    Let ( z ) and ( w ) be two distinct vertices in ( B ) such that ( z ) is not adjacent to ( y ) and ( w ) is not adjacent to ( x ). This means the set ( {x, y, z, w} ) contain pairs that neither completely know each other nor are entirely unacquainted. 9. **Contradiction:**    Now, consider the set ( {x, y, z, w} ). For this set neither:    - Do any three of them mutually know each other,    - Nor are any three of them mutually strangers.    This is a direct contradiction of the hypothesis, which requires that every group of 4 people has a subset of three who either all know each other or none of whom know each other. **Conclusion:** The assumption that ( x ) and ( y ) are connected by an edge leads to a contradiction. Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) cannot be connected, which means that all vertices outside the maximal clique ( A ) must form an independent set (i.e., no two of them are connected).  Therefore, we can partition the assembly into two groups: - ( A ), where everyone knows each other (a clique), - and ( V setminus A ), where no one knows each other (an independent set). Thus, it is confirmed that there exists such a partition. [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"Which of the following algebraic expressions is written in standard form?

Define:    [    f(n) = 2^{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_t}    ]    This ensures that if ( k mid n ), then ( f(k) mid f(n) ) and ( f(k) < f(n) ). 5. **Verification:**    For any ( n leq 2013 ), the maximum value of ( f(n) ) occurs when ( n ) is a product of the smallest primes with the highest exponents that do not exceed 2013. The highest power of 2 within this range is ( 1024 ), confirming that ( M = 1024 ) is achievable.

Roots of the equation z^3 + az^2 + bz + c = 0 must also fulfill this property.  - **Step 2**: Real roots of unity for cubic equations can only be 1 and -1. We need to verify if they are solutions to the cubic equation by substitution.   - Substituting z = 1: 1 + a + b + c = 0   - Substituting z = -1: -1 + a - b + c = 0 - **Step 3**: For non-real roots of unity (omega), which are typically nth roots of unity for n > 2, their conjugates overline{omega} must also be roots if they appear in real-coefficient polynomials. Thus, if z^3 + az^2 + bz + c = 0 has non-real roots of unity, it must be compatible with their powers and nature (absolute values). - **Step 4**: Coefficients a, b, and c can be determined through relationships of roots, especially using symmetries like omega + overline{omega} for the sum of roots (present in coefficient a) and their products (present in b and c). Assuming simple cases like all roots of unity being third roots (omega, omega^2, ...), we can compute:   - omega = e^{2pi i / 3} for n = 3; hence, omega^3 = 1, omega^2 = omega^{-1}, and the sum omega + omega^2 + 1 = 0 (realizing omega + omega^2 = -1). Plug values to check which cubic equations are possible.   From using these ideas, the forms z^3 + 3z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0 and z^3 - 3z^2 + 3z - 1 = 0 emerge as valid cubic polynomials having roots of unity. Checking their root-hood under unity:   - For z^3 + 3z^2 + 3z + 1 = 0, (z+1)^3 = 0 has roots z = -1 (a third root of unity).   - For z^3 - 3z^2 + 3z - 1 = 0, (z-1)^3 = 0 has roots z = 1. **Conclusion**: The roots of unity that satisfy these polynomials include boxed{pm 1}, among potentially other complex roots depending on the chosen values of n."},{"instruction":"Last year, 120 adult cats were admitted to Rivertown Animal Haven.

Step 2: Inclusion of Factors We seek five consecutive numbers that include these prime factors. Let's identify where each prime factor can appropriately fit within a sequence of five consecutive numbers: 1. **Prime Factor 2**: Any set of five consecutive numbers will contain at least one even number, ensuring that 2 is included automatically. 2. **Prime Factor 19**: We need at least one number in the sequence divisible by 19. 3. **Prime Factor 53**: We need at least one number in the sequence divisible by 53.

We need to show: [ S_{5}left( 4 (5^m + 1) l right) = S_{5}(4l) quad text{for some} quad l. ] For a number ( n ) in base 5 representation with fewer than ( m+1 ) digits (positions), we have: [ S_{5}left( (5^m + 1) n right) = S_{5}(5^m n + n) = S_{5}(5^m n) + S_{5}(n) = 2S_{5}(n) > S_{5}(n). ] This indicates a contradiction unless we find ( n ) such that has ( m+1 ) digits in base 5 without exceeding ( 4 ) in each digit place. By setting ( n = 5^{m+1} - 1 ), we get ( S_{5}(4) = 4 ), so: [ l_{0} = frac{5^{m+1} - 1}{4}. ]  Step 5: Verify and provide the conclusion with the smallest ( l ). For any integer ( alpha in mathbb{N} ), we have: [ S_{5}left( (5^m + 1) cdot 4 cdot 5^{alpha} l_0 right) = S_{5}left( (5^m + 1) cdot 4 l_0 right) = S_{5}(4l_0) = S_{5}left( 4 cdot 5^{alpha} l_0 right), ] therefore: [ l = 5^{alpha} l_0 quad (alpha in mathbb{N}) ] are infinitely many ( l ) that satisfy the given condition. The smallest value of ( l ) is: [ l = l_0 = frac{5^{m+1} - 1}{4}. ] Thus, the smallest value of ( l ) is: [ boxed{l = frac{5^{m+1} - 1}{4}} ]"},{"instruction":"Mr. Brown's salary increases by 12% each year.

Let's consider a person sitting at the table. Each chair is labeled with the name of one of the twelve jurors. This means there are twelve labeled seats. 2. Since NN sits in the next seat, he is by definition a \\"non-lucky\\" or \\"unlucky\\" member because he did not sit in his designated seat. 3. The rest of the jury members arrive one by one, and each one will:    - Sit in their designated seat if it is available.    - Otherwise, move clockwise around the table to the first available free seat and sit there. 4. Identify the effect of this seating arrangement:    - Each \\"lucky\\" member, who manages to sit in their designated seat, does not affect further deviations.    - Each \\"unlucky\\" member who finds their seat taken will sit in another’s seat, possibly displacing more members. 5. The crucial part lies in the structure created by the sequence of \\"unlucky\\" members. Since NN originally displaces a seat, this initiates a chain reaction potentially affecting more members. 6. Assume there are ( k ) \\"lucky\\" members aside from NN. Since NN and the person whose seat NN has taken are definitely \\"unlucky\\", we need to place the other 10 members into \\"lucky\\" or \\"unlucky\\" roles. 7. We need the total number of possible combinations of these roles, which is equivalent to choosing subsets from a set of 10 people (excluding NN and the person whose seat he took).

The balanced equation for this reaction is: CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + H2O + CO2 However, we have two side reactions to consider: 1.

The reaction of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) with hydronium ion (H3O+) to form calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2): CaCO3 + 2 H3O+ → Ca(HCO3)2 Given that we start with 1 mole of CaCO3 and 2 moles of HCl, let's see how the reactions proceed: First, we need to see if the side reactions will consume any of the HCl before it can react with CaCO3 to form CaCl2. Since we have 2 moles of HCl, and the first side reaction consumes 1 mole of HCl for every mole of H2O, we need to know if there is any H2O present to react with HCl. However, the problem does not mention any initial moles of H2O, so we will assume that all the HCl is available to react with CaCO3. Now, let's consider the second side reaction. If any H3O+ is formed, it could react with CaCO3 to form Ca(HCO3)2 instead of CaCl2. But since we are not given any initial moles of H3O+ and the problem does not mention the formation of Ca(HCO3)2 as a product, we will assume that all the HCl reacts directly with CaCO3 to form CaCl2. Therefore, according to the main reaction, 1 mole of CaCO3 reacts with 2 moles of HCl to form 1 mole of CaCl2.

We start by noting that 48 is a multiple of 3 and satisfies the condition that (48 + 1 = 49 = 7^2). 2. To find the successor, we look for the next perfect square, ( 8^2 = 64 ). 3. We need a number (x) such that (x + 1 = 64). Thus,    [    x = 64 - 1 = 63.    ] 4. Verifying, (63 + 1 = 64 = 8^2), confirms that 63 is indeed the next term in the sequence. Hence, the next number after 48 is: [ boxed{63} ]  b) Find the eighth number in this sequence. 1.

Filtering out the numbers that are not multiples of 3 leaves:    [    3, 15, 24, 48, 63, 99, 120, 168, 195, ldots    ]    Here, the eighth term is 168. Thus, the eighth number in the sequence is: [ boxed{168} ]  c) Find the 2013th term in this sequence. 1. Note that our sequence consists of numbers ( n ) such that ( n + 1 ) is a perfect square. 2. The perfect squares up to ( n times 2 = 2013 times 2 = 4026 ) are needed since we alternate factors. 3. Verify multiples of 3, then consider:    - If (x) is not a multiple of 3, the transformation (x = 3k+1) and (x = 3k+2) holds. 4.

First, we convert the distance from miles to kilometers. There are 1.60934 kilometers in a mile, so we multiply the distance in miles by this conversion factor: 4.8 miles * 1.60934 km/mile = 7.724832 km Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the time in minutes by 60 to get the time in hours: 33 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.55 hours Now we can calculate the speed in kilometers per hour by dividing the distance in kilometers by the time in hours: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 7.724832 km / 0.55 hours ≈ 14.045149 km/hour The boy's speed is approximately boxed{14.05}  kilometers per hour."},{"instruction":"Two standard dice are rolled.

The probability of rolling a 6 on one die is frac{1}{6}. Thus, the probability of rolling exactly two 6's (both dice showing 6) is left(frac{1}{6}right)^2 = frac{1}{36}. 3. The probability of rolling exactly one 6 (6 on one die and any number other than 6 on the other die) involves two cases (6 on the first, not on the second or not on the first, 6 on the second):    - Each case has a probability of frac{1}{6} times frac{5}{6} = frac{5}{36}.    - Since there are two such cases, the total probability is 2 cdot frac{5}{36} = frac{10}{36}. The expected number of 6's (E) is calculated by weighting each outcome by its respective probability: [ E = 2 times frac{1}{36} + 1 times frac{10}{36} + 0 times frac{25}{36} = frac{2}{36} + frac{10}{36} = frac{12}{36} = boxed{frac{1}{3}}. ]"},{"instruction":"Eugene has 51.0 pencils.

Now, let's find out how many times she fills her 20-ounce thermos to reach the 160 ounces she used to drink in a week. 160 ounces / 20 ounces per fill = 8 fills per week. Since she fills her thermos twice a day, we divide the number of fills per week by 2 to find out how many days a week she fills her thermos. 8 fills per week / 2 fills per day = 4 days per week.

For a triangle, there are no diagonals needed as it is already a polygon with three sides.

This means any ( k )-gon can be divided into ( k - 2 ) triangles using non-intersecting diagonals. 3. **Inductive Step**: Consider an ( n )-gon, where ( n > 3 ). Choose any vertex ( V_i ) of the ( n )-gon. There exist ((n-3)) diagonals starting from ( V_i ) to every other vertex of the ( n )-gon except its adjacent vertices ( V_{i-1} ) and ( V_{i+1} ). 4. **Diagonalization**:     - Draw a diagonal from ( V_i ) to one of the non-adjacent vertices, say ( V_j ) where ( |i-j| > 1 ). This diagonal splits the ( n )-gon into two smaller polygons: one with ( k ) sides (where ( 3 < k < n )) and another with ( n-k+2 ) sides (where ( 3 < (n-k+2) < n )).     5. **Application of Inductive Hypothesis**:    - Since both resulting polygons after the split are smaller than the original ( n )-gon and have at least 3 sides each, by the inductive hypothesis, both these polygons can themselves be divided into triangles using non-intersecting diagonals.     6. **Conclusion**: We've demonstrated that an ( n )-gon can be divided into triangles by using non-intersecting diagonals based on the inductive hypothesis.

This point is on the Earth's surface.    - The projection plane is tangent to the Earth at the point diametrically opposite to the projection center. 2. **Projection of the Equator:**    - The equator will project as a straight line because the equator is a great circle and the projection center lies on the equator. 3. **Prime Meridian Projection:**    - The prime meridian also appears as a straight line, perpendicular to the equator in the projection, because it is another great circle intersecting the equator at a right angle at the projection center. 4. **Meridians (Longitude Circles) and Their Representation:**    - The meridians are circles passing through the poles.

Let the heights of the children in the back row be denoted as ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). Similarly, let the heights of the children in the front row be denoted as ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ).

Let the new heights in the back row be:    [    a'_1 leq a'_2 leq ldots leq a'_n    ] 3. **Rearrange the Front Row in the Same Arrangement**:    After sorting the back row, rearrange the front row in such a way so that each child stays in front of the same child in the back row. The heights in the front row are adjusted correspondingly.        Denote the rearranged heights in the front row as ( b'_1, b'_2, ldots, b'_n ).  4. **Maintain Condition**:    We need to show that after this rearrangement, for all ( i ):    [    b'_i < a'_i    ]     5. **Swapping Mechanics**:    To create a sorted front row with increasing heights while maintaining the condition ( b'_i < a'_i ), we can perform a series of swaps.         - Whenever we have two children in the front row such that ( b'_i > b'_j ) (for ( i < j )), we can swap ( b'_i ) and ( b'_j ).     - Each of these swaps will still satisfy ( b_i < a_i ) and ( b_j < a_j ) due to the ordering of ( a_i ).        Let’s demonstrate this process:        Suppose ( i < j ) but ( b'_i > b'_j ). After swapping:    [    b'_i text{ shifts to position } j text{, and } b'_j text{ shifts to position } i    ]    Since ( b'_i < a'_i ) and ( b'_j < a'_j ) before the swap, by the nature of the swap and the ordering, we ensure that:    [    b'_i < a'_j text{ and } b'_j < a'_i    ]     6. **Final Arrangement**:    By continuously applying such swaps, we eventually obtain a front row ordered in increasing heights. At each step, the condition ( b'_i < a'_i ) remains true for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ). Therefore, the final reordered arrangement still satisfies the requirement that every child in the back row is taller than the child directly in front of him.

Since the point P also lies on the graph of y=f(x), we have:  f(4) = 4^{alpha} = 2  To solve for alpha, we take the root:  alpha = frac{1}{2}  Thus, we have found that f(x)=x^{frac{1}{2}}. Applying this to find f(16):  f(16) = 16^{frac{1}{2}} = 4  The final answer is boxed{4}. To solve this problem, we set up the power function with an undetermined exponent, used the property of the constant point (4, 2) on the graph of the given exponential function to find the exponent, and then found the value of the function at a specific point.

Define ( nu_p(n) ) as the exponent of ( p ) in the prime factorization of ( n! ). This can be expressed using the ( operatorname{ord}_p ) function (the exponent of ( p ) in ( n )) as follows:        nu_p(n) = operatorname{ord}_p(n!) = sum_{i=1}^{n} operatorname{ord}_p(i).     2. **Lemma Statement and Proof:**    **Lemma:** Let ( p ) be a prime number, ( q ) be a positive integer, and ( k ) and ( r ) be positive integers such that ( p^k > r ). Then         nu_p(q p^k + r) = nu_p(q p^k) + nu_p(r).        **Proof:**     - Claim: ( operatorname{ord}_p(q p^k + i) = operatorname{ord}_p(i) ) for all ( 0 < i < p^k ).    - Suppose ( d = operatorname{ord}_p(i) ). Then ( d < k ), so ( q p^k + i ) is divisible by ( p^d ), but only the first term ( q p^k ) is divisible by ( p^{d+1} ); hence the sum is not divisible by ( p^{d+1} ):            operatorname{ord}_p(q p^k + i) = operatorname{ord}_p(i).          - Using this claim, we get:            nu_p(q p^k + r) = sum_{i=1}^{q p^k} operatorname{ord}_p(i) + sum_{i=q p^k + 1}^{q p^k + r} operatorname{ord}_p(i) = sum_{i=1}^{q p^k} operatorname{ord}_p(i) + sum_{i=1}^{r} operatorname{ord}_p(i).          - Therefore:            nu_p(q p^k + r) = nu_p(q p^k) + nu_p(r).       3. **Introduction of Modular Arithmetic:**    For any integer ( a ), denote by ( bar{a} ) its residue modulo ( d ). Operations on residues will also be performed modulo ( d ), i.e., ( bar{a} + bar{b} = overline{a+b} ).    For any positive integer ( n ), define a function ( f ) as follows:        f(n) = (f_1(n), ldots, f_k(n)),        where ( f_i(n) = overline{nu_{p_i}(n)} ). 4. **Construction of Sequence:**    Define the sequence ( n_1 = 1 ), and         n_{ell+1} = (p_1 p_2 ldots p_k)^{n_ell}.        We claim that:        f(n_{ell_1} + n_{ell_2} + ldots + n_{ell_m}) = f(n_{ell_1}) + f(n_{ell_2}) + ldots + f(n_{ell_m}),        for any ( ell_1 < ell_2 < ldots < ell_m ). The base case ( m = 1 ) is trivial. 5. **Inductive Step:**    Suppose ( m > 1 ). By the construction of the sequence, ( p_i^{n_{ell_1}} ) divides ( n_{ell_2} + ldots + n_{ell_m} ). Clearly, ( p_i^{n_{ell_1}} > n_{ell_1} ) for all ( 1 leq i leq k ). Therefore, the Lemma can be applied for ( p = p_i ), ( k = r = n_{ell_1} ) and ( q p^k = n_{ell_2} + ldots + n_{ell_m} ) to obtain:        f_i(n_{ell_1} + n_{ell_2} + ldots + n_{ell_m}) = f_i(n_{ell_1}) + f_i(n_{ell_2} + ldots + n_{ell_m}), quad text{for all } 1 leq i leq k.        Hence,        f(n_{ell_1} + n_{ell_2} + ldots + n_{ell_m}) = f(n_{ell_1}) + f(n_{ell_2} + ldots + n_{ell_m}) = f(n_{ell_1}) + f(n_{ell_2}) + ldots + f(n_{ell_m}),        by the induction hypothesis. 6. **Conclusion:**    Now consider the values ( f(n_1), f(n_2), ldots ). There exist finitely many possible values of ( f ). Hence, there exists an infinite sequence of indices ( ell_1 < ell_2 < ldots ) such that        f(n_{ell_1}) = f(n_{ell_2}) = ldots        and thus,        f(n_{ell_{m+1}} + n_{ell_{m+2}} + ldots + n_{ell_{m+d}}) = f(n_{ell_{m+1}}) + ldots + f(n_{ell_{m+d}}) = d cdot f(n_{ell_1}) = (overline{0}, ldots, overline{0}),        for all ( m ).

This can be shown by considering that an odd number can be written as 2m+1 and an even number as 2n, for some integers m and n. Thus, the sum 2n + (2m+1) = 2(n+m) + 1 is odd. 3. **Check for Divisibility by Smallest Prime Number**:    - Since 2^{14} + 7^{8} is odd, it is not divisible by 2. We now must check for divisibility by next smallest primes, starting with 3. Checking if each term is divisible by 3:      - 2^{14} is not divisible by 3.      - 7 equiv 1 pmod{3}, therefore 7^8 equiv 1^8 = 1 pmod{3}.    - Thus, 2^{14} + 7^8 equiv 0 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{3}, implying it is not divisible by 3.    - Continue checking for divisibility by 5:      - Since neither term is divisible by 5, we check 2^{14} + 7^8 pmod{5}.

Solve accordingly, but pay attention to the fact that the denominator cannot be zero. **Solution** The inequality frac{x-1}{2x+3} > 1 can be rewritten as frac{x-1}{2x+3} - 1 > 0, which simplifies to frac{x+4}{2x+3} < 0.

Thus, the n-th term, a_n, can be expressed as a_1 + (n-1)d. According to the properties of arithmetic sequences, we have the following equations: 1. Sum of the first three terms: a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) = 3a_1 + 3d = 34. 2. Sum of the last three terms: (a_1 + (n-3)d) + (a_1 + (n-2)d) + (a_1 + (n-1)d) = 3a_1 + 3(n-2)d = 146. 3. The sum of all terms of an arithmetic sequence can be given by the formula:  text{Sum} = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d) = 390.  From equation (1), we solve for 3a_1 + 3d = 34 giving us a_1 + d = frac{34}{3}. Let's label this as equation (4). From equation (2), we have 3a_1 + 3(n-2)d = 146, and dividing by 3 gives us a_1 + (n-2)d = frac{146}{3}. Let's label this as equation (5). Subtracting equation (4) from equation (5), we get:  (a_1 + (n-2)d) - (a_1 + d) = frac{146}{3} - frac{34}{3}   a_1 + (n-2)d - a_1 - d = frac{112}{3}   (n-3)d = frac{112}{3}   d = frac{frac{112}{3}}{n-3}. Now let's substitute d and a_1 from equation (4) into the sum formula of the arithmetic sequence from equation (3):  390 = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)   390 = frac{n}{2} left( frac{68}{3} + (n-1) cdot frac{frac{112}{3}}{n-3} right).  At this point, we need to find the common value of n that satisfies the equation. Solving this equation directly can be complex, but we notice that if we multiply both sides by 6 to clear out the denominators, we get a quadratic in n, which we can solve:  2340 = n left( 136 + frac{2(n-1) cdot 112}{n-3} right).  This equation can be solved for n because it is quadratic in nature. However, since it is still somewhat complex due to the presence of n-3 in the denominator, it may be more practical to seek integer solutions for n that simplify this equation. Considering that the sum of an arithmetic sequence is an integer, n must be chosen such that the fraction is cleared, which suggests that n-3 is a divisor of 112. The divisors of 112 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 16, 28, 56, 112. We now test these values in the simplified version of the sum equation:  390 = frac{n}{2} left( frac{68}{3} + (n-1) cdot frac{112}{3(n-3)} right),  which suggests trying the smallest divisor, n-3=1, i.e., n=4, which fails as the sum exceeds 390; and then incrementing to larger divisors until the sum reaches or passes 390. Upon trying n-3 = 7 (i.e., n = 10) and then n-3 = 8 (i.e., n = 11), we find that n = 11 gives us a sum that matches 390:  390 = frac{11}{2} times left( frac{68}{3} + 10 times frac{112}{3 times 8} right)   390 = frac{11}{2} times left( frac{68}{3} + frac{140}{3} right)   390 = frac{11}{2} times frac{208}{3}   390 = 11 times 34   390 = 390.

Solving for y, we find:    [    2y = 3s - s implies 2y = 2s implies y = s    ] 4. **Finding x**:    Since x + y must also equal 3s, substituting y = s gives:    [    x + s = 3s implies x = 3s - s = 2s    ] 5. **Ratio of longer side to shorter side**:    The ratio is given by:    [    frac{x}{y} = frac{2s}{s} = 2    ]    Therefore, the ratio of the length of the longer side to the shorter side of each rectangle is 2.

The sum of the fractions of green, blue, and yellow balls plus the white balls should equal the total number of balls T: (1/4)T + (1/8)T + (1/12)T + 26 = T To solve for T, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 24 in this case. So we rewrite the equation as: (6/24)T + (3/24)T + (2/24)T + 26 = T Combine the fractions: (6/24 + 3/24 + 2/24)T + 26 = T (11/24)T + 26 = T Subtract (11/24)T from both sides to isolate T: T - (11/24)T = 26 (24/24)T - (11/24)T = 26 (13/24)T = 26 Now, solve for T: T = 26 / (13/24) T = 26 * (24/13) T = 2 * 24 T = 48 So there are 48 balls in total.

To use the Power Mean Inequality (or the Muirhead Inequality in this context), we need to apply it to the function f(x) = x^2, which is convex.

Draw segment ( O_2B ) and plot the radius ( O_2B ) parallel to radius ( O_1C ) from circle 1.     - Since ( O_1C = O_2B = r ) and ( O_1C parallel O_2B ), the quadrilateral ( O_1O_2BC ) forms a parallelogram. 2. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel:     - ( BC parallel O_1O_2 ) and ( BC = O_1O_2 = 1 ). 3. Let ( F ) be the midpoint of segment ( BC ):     - Since ( BC parallel O_1O_2 ) and ( F ) is the midpoint, then ( O_1F parallel OB ). 4. Draw segment ( CA ) and let ( M ) be the intersection of ( CA ) and ( O_1F ):     - Since ( O_1F ) is parallel to the common chord and bisects angles, ( O_1F ) bisects chord ( AC ). 5. Therefore:     - ( CF = FB ) which implies ( CM = MA ), and ( O_1F ) bisects ( AC ). 6.

If the team loses, the money is not returned). - Second team: Odds of 1:1. - Third team: Odds of -1:8. - Fourth team: Odds of -1:7. Is it possible to place bets in such a way that you win regardless of the outcome of the tournament? 1. **Understanding the Bets Return**: For each team, we calculate the return if the team wins.     - For the first team:       - Odds are 1:5, implying a total return of 6 times the bet.       - To ensure a win, the amount bet on the first team should be more than frac{1}{6} of the total money because frac{1}{6} times 6 = 1.     - For the second team:       - Odds are 1:1, implying a total return of 2 times the bet.       - To ensure a win, the amount bet on the second team should be more than frac{1}{2} of the total money because frac{1}{2} times 2 = 1.     - For the third team:       - Odds are -1:8, implying a total return of 9 times the bet (8 times the profit plus the initial bet).       - To ensure a win, the amount bet on the third team should be more than frac{1}{9} of the total money because frac{1}{9} times 9 = 1.     - For the fourth team:       - Odds are -1:7, implying a total return of 8 times the bet (7 times the profit plus the initial bet).       - To ensure a win, the amount bet on the fourth team should be more than frac{1}{8} of the total money because frac{1}{8} times 8 = 1. 2. **Adding Up the Necessary Proportions**:     We need to check if the sum of these fractions is less than or equal to 1.          [     frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{9} + frac{1}{8}     ] 3. **Calculating the Sum**:     - Find a common denominator or approximate:     [     frac{1}{6} approx 0.1667, quad frac{1}{2} = 0.5, quad frac{1}{9} approx 0.1111, quad frac{1}{8} = 0.125     ]     [     0.1667 + 0.5 + 0.1111 + 0.125 = 0.9028     ]     The sum (0.9028) is less than (1). 4. **Conclusion**:     Since the total sum of the necessary proportions is less than (1), it is possible to allocate betting amounts such that the total money wagered sums to 1, and each bet proportion is more than the respective fraction. Thus, a strategy exists where one can ensure a win regardless of the outcome of the tournament.

Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second because the lengths of the trains are given in meters. 1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, 100 km/hr = 100 * 1000 meters / 3600 seconds 100 km/hr = 100000 meters / 3600 seconds 100 km/hr = 27.78 meters/second (approximately) The total distance to be covered for the trains to cross each other is the sum of their lengths.

Upper Bound Analysis 1. **Step 1:** Suppose Nozdryov initially distributes the 1001 nuts into three boxes such that there are 143, 286 (which is (2 times 143)), and 572 (which is (4 times 143)) nuts respectively. This setup indicates a structured distribution based on multiples of 143. 2. **Step 2:** For any chosen number ( N ) between 1 and 1001, we can represent it using the form ( N = 143k + r ), where ( 0 leq k leq 7 ) and ( -71 leq r < 71 ). This divides the problem into working with residues inside specific bounds.     - **Case 1:** If ( r = 0 ), meaning ( N = 143k ). Here, ( k > 0 ), and Nozdryov can fulfill the requirement without moving any nuts by just using the sum of the boxes containing multiples of 143.     - **Case 2:** If ( r < 0 ), meaning ( r ) is a negative residue. Nozdryov should collect the total sum ( 143k ) using multiples of 143 nuts in boxes and then move ( r ) nuts away to the empty box.     - **Case 3:** If ( r > 0 ), we need to adjust the strategy for Chichikov to find ( 1001 - N ). Using the same methodology but ensuring ( r ) nuts are added back, Nozdryov presents boxes so that their combined total is ( 1001 - N ) nuts, proving the other boxes holding ( N ). 3. Combining these observations, Chichikov can depend on the movements of nuts always being ( r ), where the magnitude of ( r leq 71 ), ensuring the maximum guaranteed nuts moved is 71.  Lower Bound Analysis 1. **Step 1:** Demonstrating that for any Nozdryov's initial configuration can exist, a number ( N ) that needs at least 71 nuts to be moved. Assume the initial counts are ( x, y, z ) in some three boxes. 2. **Step 2:** The sums ( x, y, z, x+y, x+z, y+z ) generate six distinct endpoints; it segments the span ([0, 1001]) into seven intervals. 3. **Step 3:** Among these intervals, at least one must be of size ( geq frac{1001}{7} = 143 ). On any such interval, one end segment involving integer numbers will require configurations where adjustments must be precisely (geq 71) nuts to balance up or down. Most generally, intervals showing how nuts need to trans-situate over the remaining boxes help understand Chichikov's minimum requirement to proceed inclusively. # Conclusion This detailed analysis, leveraging structured initial box distributions using multiples of a significant nut quantity portion and segment approaches amidst a guaranteed invariant distribution result: [ boxed{71} ]"},{"instruction":"f 40% of the students at a certain college are enrolled in biology classes, then 528 students at the college are not enrolled in a biology class.

W1 = 15 persons * 42 days Now, we want to find the amount of work done by 40 persons to build a 60 m long wall. We'll call this work W2. Since the length of the wall in the second scenario is 2/3 of the length of the wall in the first scenario (60 m is 2/3 of 90 m), the amount of work required for the second wall (W2) will be 2/3 of the work required for the first wall (W1).

Let's assume \\"a gt b\\". This implies that for any positive value of c^2, multiplying both sides of the inequality by c^2 (which is always non-negative) will maintain the inequality. Thus, we have: [a gt b Rightarrow ac^{2} gt bc^{2}] This shows that if \\"a gt b\\", then it is always true that \\"ac^{2} gt bc^{2}\\", given that c^2 is non-negative. 2. However, the reverse implication needs to be examined. If we assume \\"ac^{2} gt bc^{2}\\", can we directly conclude \\"a gt b\\"? The answer is not always. Consider the special case when c = 0. In this case, regardless of the values of a and b, we have: [ac^{2} = bc^{2} = 0] This means that \\"ac^{2} gt bc^{2}\\" does not necessarily imply \\"a gt b\\" because when c=0, both sides of the inequality become zero, making the inequality irrelevant to the relationship between a and b.

However, show that we can find such ( a ), ( b ), ( c ) with ( |a + b sqrt{2} + c sqrt{3}| < 10^{11} ).","output":"To show that for any integers ( a, b, c ), not all zero, and such that ( |a|, |b|, |c| < 10^6 ), we have ( |a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3}| > 10^{-21} ), and to also find such ( a, b, c ) such that ( |a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3}| < 10^{-11} ): 1. **Establish the Main Identity:**    Consider the expression ( a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3} ). The problem can be approached by examining its product with its conjugates:    [    (a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3})(a + bsqrt{2} - csqrt{3})(a - bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3})(a - bsqrt{2} - csqrt{3})     ] 2. **Expand the Expression:**    Let's expand this product. Notice that:    [    (A + B)(A - B) = A^2 - B^2    ]    Applying this to our product, we get:    [    left((a + bsqrt{2}) + csqrt{3}right)left((a + bsqrt{2}) - csqrt{3}right) = (a + bsqrt{2})^2 - (csqrt{3})^2    ]    Similarly,    [    left((a - bsqrt{2}) + csqrt{3}right)left((a - bsqrt{2}) - csqrt{3}right) = (a - bsqrt{2})^2 - (csqrt{3})^2    ]    Therefore, the original expression becomes:    [    left[(a + bsqrt{2})^2 - (csqrt{3})^2right]left[(a - bsqrt{2})^2 - (csqrt{3})^2right]    ] 3. **Combine and Simplify:**    Let's expand each term:    [    (a + bsqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2absqrt{2} + 2b^2    ]    and    [    (a - bsqrt{2})^2 = a^2 - 2absqrt{2} + 2b^2    ]    Similarly, for the ( csqrt{3} ) term:    [    (csqrt{3})^2 = 3c^2    ]    Therefore:    [    [(a^2 + 2sqrt{2}ab + 2b^2) - 3c^2][(a^2 - 2absqrt{2} + 2b^2) - 3c^2]    ]    Simplifying further, we get:    [    (a^2 + 2b^2 - 3c^2)^2 - (2absqrt{2})^2 = a^4 + 4b^4 + 9c^4 - 4a^2b^2 - 6a^2c^2 - 12b^2c^2    ] 4. **Identify the Key Non-zero Integer:**    The left-hand side expression ( a^4 + 4b^4 + 9c^4 - 4a^2b^2 - 6a^2c^2 - 12b^2c^2 ) is always an integer. Suppose it equals zero, then a similar argument used to show the irrationality of (sqrt{2}) would lead to a contradiction unless ( a = 0 ), ( b = 0 ), or ( c = 0 ), which violates the condition that not all are zero. Thus, the expression must be non-zero. 5. **Bound the Product:**    Each factor ( (a pm bsqrt{2} pm csqrt{3}) ) is bounded by:    [    |a|, |b|, |c| < 10^6    ]    So, each factor is at most ( 10^6 + 10^6sqrt{2} + 10^6sqrt{3} < 10^7 ). 6. **Lower Bound for ( |a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3}| ):**    Thus:    [    |(a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3})| geq frac{1}{|(a + bsqrt{2} - csqrt{3})(a - bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3})(a - bsqrt{2} - csqrt{3})|}     ]    Each of the three terms is at most ( 10^7 ), so:    [    |a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3}| > frac{1}{10^7 times 10^7 times 10^7} = 10^{-21}    ]    So we have:    [    |a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3}| > 10^{-21}    ] 7. **Upper Bound Using the Pigeonhole Principle:**    Now consider the interval ( [0, 5 times 10^6] ). There are ( 10^{18} ) distinct numbers ( a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3} ) with ( 0 leq a, b, c < 10^6 ). Divide this interval into ( 6 times 10^{17} ) equal parts. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two numbers must lie in the same part. Subtracting them:    [    |a_1 + b_1sqrt{2} + c_1sqrt{3} - (a_2 + b_2sqrt{2} + c_2sqrt{3})| < frac{5 times 10^6}{6 times 10^{17}} = frac{5}{6} times 10^{-11}    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    There exist integers ( a, b, c ) such that:    [    |a + bsqrt{2} + csqrt{3}| < frac{5}{6} times 10^{-11}    ] Thus, we have shown both parts of the problem: 1.

We need to show that ( text{gcd}left(binom{m_n}{k}, lright) = 1 ).  4. **Modulo ( p ) analysis:**    For ( 1 leq j leq k ), consider ( j + nl^a mod p ). Since ( l^a ) is a multiple of ( p ) (because ( l ) is composed of primes including ( p )), we have:    [    j + nl^a equiv j pmod{p}    ]    This implies ( j + nl^a notequiv 0 pmod{p} ) because ( 1 leq j leq k ) and ( k < l^a ). 5. **Valuation of ( p ) in the binomial coefficient:**    The ( p )-adic valuation ( v_p ) of ( j + nl^a ) is the same as ( v_p(j) ) because ( j + nl^a equiv j pmod{p} ). Therefore:    [    v_p(j + nl^a) = v_p(j)    ]    Summing over all ( j ) from 1 to ( k ):    [    v_pleft(binom{m_n}{k}right) = sum_{j=1}^k v_p(j + nl^a) - sum_{j=1}^k v_p(j) = 0    ]    This shows that ( binom{m_n}{k} ) has no factors of ( p ). 6. **Conclusion for gcd:**    Since ( p ) was an arbitrary prime divisor of ( l ), and ( binom{m_n}{k} ) has no factors of ( p ) for any such ( p ), it follows that:    [    text{gcd}left(binom{m_n}{k}, lright) = 1    ] 7. **Infinitely many ( m ):**    The sequence ( m_n = k + nl^a ) provides infinitely many ( m ) such that ( m geq k ) and ( text{gcd}left(binom{m}{k}, lright) = 1 ).

Here are the detailed steps: 1. **Case Analysis Based on 10-Ruble Coins Usage:**    - Denis uses either 0 or 1 ten-ruble coin since using more than one 10-ruble coin would exceed 16 rubles. 2. **Case 1: Using 1 Ten-Ruble Coin:**    - If Denis uses 1 ten-ruble coin, he needs to pay the remaining amount of (16 - 10 = 6) rubles using 2-ruble and 1-ruble coins.

[    x text{ (2-ruble coins)} + y text{ (1-ruble coins)} = 16    ]    We can analyze this equation by varying the number of 2-ruble coins:    - If (x = 0), (y = 16) (0 two-ruble coins and 16 one-ruble coins).    - If (x = 1), (y = 14) (1 two-ruble coin and 14 one-ruble coins).    - If (x = 2), (y = 12) (2 two-ruble coins and 12 one-ruble coins).    - If (x = 3), (y = 10) (3 two-ruble coins and 10 one-ruble coins).    - If (x = 4), (y = 8) (4 two-ruble coins and 8 one-ruble coins).    - If (x = 5), (y = 6) (5 two-ruble coins and 6 one-ruble coins).    - If (x = 6), (y = 4) (6 two-ruble coins and 4 one-ruble coins).    - If (x = 7), (y = 2) (7 two-ruble coins and 2 one-ruble coins).    - If (x = 8), (y = 0) (8 two-ruble coins and no one-ruble coins).

By rewriting ( f(x) ) we have:    [    f(x) = a (x^2 - 1)^{1993} + b x^{1993}(x+1)^{1993} + c x^{1993}(x-1)^{1993}    ]    Here we notice that ( f(x) ) is to be manipulated to find the degree of the polynomial. 4. **Analyzing the degree of ( f(x) ):**    - The highest power terms in the expansion of ( (x^2 - 1)^{1993} ) are ( x^{3986} ).    - The highest power terms in the expansion of ( x^{1993} (x+1)^{1993} ) and ( x^{1993} (x-1)^{1993} ) are both ( x^{3986} ).    To eliminate ( x^{3986} ), we must set:    [    a + b + c = 0    ] 5. **Removing the next highest power term:**    Next, we look at the power ( x^{3985} ). The coefficients of ( x^{3985} ) will be zero if:    [    b = c    ]    Now, substituting ( c = b ), 6. **Finding the coefficient of ( x^{3984} ):**    We analyze the coefficient of ( x^{3984} ):    [    text{The coefficient of } x^{3984} = -1992a + 2 cdot 1992 b    ]    Given ( a + b + c = 0 Rightarrow a + 2b = 0 Rightarrow a = -2b ):    The coefficient of ( x^{3984} ):    [    = (-1992)(-2b) + 2 cdot 1992b = 1992(2b) + 2 cdot 1992 b = 1992(4b) neq 0    ]    Thus, the leading term that is non-zero after eliminating higher order terms is ( x^{3984} ). # Conclusion: Therefore, the smallest possible degree of ( f(x) ) is: [ boxed{3984} ]"},{"instruction":"There is 80 mg of caffeine in a cup of coffee.

The time which they take to cross each other is?","output":"To find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other, we first need to calculate the relative speed at which they are approaching each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The speed of the first train is 80 km/hr, and the speed of the second train is 50 km/hr. Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 80 km/hr + 50 km/hr Relative speed = 130 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second because the lengths of the trains are given in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 130 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (130 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (650/18) m/s Relative speed ≈ 36.11 m/s The total distance to be covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 315 m + 270 m Total distance = 585 m Now, we can find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other by dividing the total distance by the relative speed: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 585 m / 36.11 m/s Time ≈ 16.2 seconds So, the two trains will take approximately boxed{16.2}  seconds to cross each other."},{"instruction":"David swims the 100meter freestyle in 48 seconds.

Suppose ( theta_{1}, theta_{2}, theta_{3} ) are not equal. Without loss of generality, let ( theta_{1} < theta_{2} < theta_{3} ).

Set A contains all the odd numbers between 1 and 100 inclusive. The first odd number is 1 and the last odd number is 99. Since the odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) where n is the number of terms. To find n for Set A, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference For Set A: 99 = 1 + (n - 1) * 2 98 = (n - 1) * 2 n - 1 = 98 / 2 n - 1 = 49 n = 50 So, there are 50 terms in Set A.

For the parabola, y^2 = 2px, the standard distance from the vertex to the focus (or directrix) is frac{p}{2}. Given that the directrix passes through the point (-1,1), we can use the distance from the vertex to the directrix to determine p. If we assume that the vertex of the parabola is at the origin (0,0), the distance from the vertex (0,0) to the directrix point (-1,1) is equal to the distance from the vertex to the focus. Squaring the distances and setting them equal gives us:  sqrt{(-1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = frac{p}{2}  This simplifies to:  sqrt{1 + 1} = frac{p}{2}  sqrt{2} = frac{p}{2}  From this, we determine that p = 2sqrt{2}. Since the focus of the parabola y^2 = 2px is at (frac{p}{2}, 0), and we have found that p = 2sqrt{2}, the coordinates of the focus are:  left(frac{2sqrt{2}}{2}, 0right) = (1, 0)  Therefore, the focus of the parabola is at point (1, 0).

At the end of the first year, his account had accrued some interest bringing his total balance to 1,100. The next year, his account balance increased by 20%. At the end of the two years, Ram's account balance increased by 32% from his initial deposit of 1,000. How much interest did his account accrue in the first year?","output":"At the end of the first year, Ram's account balance was 1,100. This means that his account accrued 100 in interest during the first year because 1,000 (initial deposit) + 100 (interest) = 1,100 (end of first year balance). To confirm this, let's calculate the total interest accrued over the two years to see if it matches the 32% increase from the initial deposit. At the end of the second year, Ram's account balance increased by 20%. To find out how much this is, we calculate 20% of the balance at the end of the first year: 20% of 1,100 = 0.20 * 1,100 = 220 So, at the end of the second year, his account balance increased by 220 due to interest. Adding this to the balance at the end of the first year: 1,100 (end of first year balance) + 220 (second year interest) = 1,320 (end of second year balance) Now, let's check if this is a 32% increase from the initial deposit: 32% of 1,000 = 0.32 * 1,000 = 320 Adding this to the initial deposit: 1,000 (initial deposit) + 320 (32% increase) = 1,320 Since the end of second year balance (1,320) matches the initial deposit plus a 32% increase (1,320), the calculations are correct.

If the minimum value of g(x) is 6, find the explicit expression of f(x).","output":"(I) Given a = -4, we have f(x) = x^{2} + frac{2}{x} - 4ln x. To find the monotonicity intervals, calculate the derivative: f'(x) = 2x - frac{2}{x^{2}} - frac{4}{x}. Within the domain of definition x > 0, we analyze the sign of the derivative to determine the monotonicity. Setting f'(x) > 0 leads to x > frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{2}. Conversely, setting f'(x) < 0 gives 0 < x < frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{2}. Therefore, the function is decreasing on (0, frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{2}) and increasing on (frac{sqrt{5} + 1}{2}, +infty). (II) With the derivative f'(x) = 2x - frac{2}{x^{2}} + frac{a}{x} and the condition that f(x) is increasing on [1, +infty), we must have f'(x) geqslant 0 on [1, +infty). Thus, the inequality a geqslant frac{2}{x} - 2x^{2} must hold for all x in [1, +infty).  Define h(x) = frac{2}{x} - 2x^{2}, which is monotonically decreasing on [1, +infty). The maximal value of h(x) is found at x = 1. Hence, h_{text{max}} = h(1) = 0, leading to a geqslant 0. (III) Now consider g(x) = x^{2}f'(x) = 2x^{3} + ax - 2. The derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = 6x^{2} + a. For a geqslant 0, g'(x) = 6x^{2} + a > 0, meaning g(x) is strictly increasing on (0, +infty) and thus has no minimum value. For a < 0, we find the critical point of g(x) by setting g'(x) = 0, which gives us x = sqrt{-frac{a}{6}}. The function g(x) decreases on (0, sqrt{-frac{a}{6}}) and increases on (sqrt{-frac{a}{6}}, +infty). Therefore, g(x) attains its minimum value at x = sqrt{-frac{a}{6}}. By equating the minimum value of g(x) to -6, we get: - frac{a}{3} sqrt{- frac{a}{6}} + a sqrt{- frac{a}{6}} - 2 = -6, which gives us a = -6.

Let's assume A invests Rs. x at the beginning. B invests double the amount of A after 6 months, which means B invests 2x after 6 months. Since B's investment is for half the year, we will count it as 2x * 6/12 = x (for the purpose of calculating the ratio of their investments over the entire year).

Here, |V| = 20 and |E| = 172. 3. **Admissibility of the Problem:**    Use the concept of connected components in graph theory to determine if the graph is connected. A connected graph is one where there is a path between any pair of vertices. 4. **Check for the Number of Edges Required for Connectivity:**    A graph with n vertices (n = 20 in this case) has at most (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) edges. For n = 20:    [    frac{20 times 19}{2} = 190    ]    Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a complete graph K_{20} is 190. 5. **Use the Connectivity Criterion:**    The minimum number of edges for ensuring the graph is connected is well-known in graph theory: for a graph with n vertices to be connected, it requires at least n-1 edges. Here, n = 20:    [    20 - 1 = 19    ]    Our graph has 172 edges, which is much greater than 19. This suggests strongly that the graph could be connected. 6. **Apply the Theorem:**    If a graph has more than (frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}) edges, it is connected. For n = 20:    [    frac{(20-1)(20-2)}{2} = frac{19 times 18}{2} = 171    ]    Since 172 edges are greater than 171, we can confirm that the graph is connected based on this theorem. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since the graph with 20 vertices and 172 edges satisfies the condition (frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} < |E|), we conclude that it is possible to travel between any two cities using the given airlines.

To find the range of -a, we can construct the function h(x) = 3ln(x) - x^3 + 1 and determine its range. Let's proceed with the following steps to solve and enhance the solution: 1. Define the function h(x) = 3ln(x) - x^3 + 1. 2. Find the critical points of h(x) by taking its derivative with respect to x:    h'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(3ln(x) - x^3 + 1right) = frac{3}{x} - 3x^2 = frac{3(1 - x^3)}{x}.    Setting h'(x) equal to zero gives us the critical points:    frac{3(1 - x^3)}{x} = 0 Rightarrow 1 - x^3 = 0 Rightarrow x = 1.    Therefore, there is a unique critical point at x=1. 3. Evaluate the function h(x) at the endpoints of the interval [frac{1}{e}, e] and at its critical point:    hleft(frac{1}{e}right) = 3lnleft(frac{1}{e}right) - left(frac{1}{e}right)^3 + 1 = -2 - frac{1}{e^3},    h(e) = 3ln(e) - e^3 + 1 = 4 - e^3,    h(1) = 3ln(1) - 1^3 + 1 = 0.    Noting that h(e) < hleft(frac{1}{e}right) and that h(1) is the maximum value. 4. Now we can determine the range of -a using the values of h(x) at the critical points and endpoints. The existence of symmetric points about the x-axis for the given interval [frac{1}{e}, e] is equivalent to:    4 - e^3 leq -a leq 0.

(Like mac, it would be windows) In java? I can't use desktop.open because I'm in a headless environment","output":"In a headless environment, the \`Desktop\` API (like using \`Desktop.open(File)\` to open a directory in the native file explorer) may not be available due to the absence of a graphical environment. However, you can still attempt to open a file directory by executing native commands specific to the operating system using Java's \`Runtime.exec()\` or \`ProcessBuilder\`. Here is a general approach: 1. Determine the operating system the Java program is running on. 2. Based on the operating system, use the appropriate command to open the file manager at a specified directory. - For Windows: the command is \`\\"explorer\\"\` with the path to the directory. - For macOS: the command is \`\\"open\\"\` with the directory path. - For Linux (this can vary a lot depending on the file manager): often, \`\\"xdg-open\\"\` can be used as it is intended to locate the default file manager and open the directory with it. Below is a simplified example demonstrating how you might implement this: \`\`\`java public class OpenDirectoryExample { public static void openDirectory(String path) { String osName = System.getProperty(\\"os.name\\").toLowerCase(); try { if (osName.contains(\\"win\\")) { // Windows Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\\"explorer \\" + path); } else if (osName.contains(\\"mac\\")) { // macOS Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\\"open \\" + path); } else if (osName.contains(\\"nix\\") || osName.contains(\\"nux\\")) { // Linux/Unix Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\\"xdg-open \\" + path); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } public static void main(String[] args) { // Example use: Open the user's home directory // Make sure the path is properly escaped or constructed, especially if it might contain spaces or special characters String userHome = System.getProperty(\\"user.home\\"); openDirectory(userHome); } } \`\`\` A few important considerations: - This code straightforwardly opens a directory in the file manager, but error handling is minimal. You might want to expand it, for instance, by checking the exit value of the process or reading its output to determine if the operation succeeded. - Be cautious with constructing command strings, especially if any part of the path might come from user input or untrusted sources, to avoid injection attacks. - In a headless environment, even if this code executes without exceptions, the expected behavior might depend on the specific setup of the system. For example, if you're running this code on a server or in a container without a typical desktop environment, the command might not perform as expected. This approach is a workaround given the constraints of a headless environment and might not be suitable for all situations. Always consider the security and operational implications of executing system commands from Java."},{"instruction":"지구가 하나의 큰 자석인 이유는 무엇인가요?","output":"지구가 하나의 큰 자석인 이유는 지구가 지자기를 가지고 있기 때문입니다. 이는 지구의 코어 내부에서 생성되는 지자기장에 의해 발생합니다. 지구의 코어는 액체인 외부 코어와 고체인 내부 코어로 구성되어 있는데, 외부 코어에서 발생하는 열에 의해 액체 철이 움직이면서 전류가 발생하고, 이로 인해 지자기장이 생성됩니다. 이 지자기장은 지구를 둘러싸고 있으며, 외부 활동을 차단하여 지구를 손상으로부터 보호하고, 나침반과 같은 자기 필드를 방향을 제공하는 중요한 역할을 합니다. 따라서, 이러한 이유로 지구는 큰 자석으로 간주됩니다."},{"instruction":"액체 철이 움직인다고해서 어떻게 전류가 발생할 수 있지?","output":"액체 상태인 철이 움직이면서 전류가 발생하는 현상은 전기 유도입니다. 액체 상태인 외부 코어는 열에 의해 물리적으로 움직이면서 전류를 생성합니다. 이 때, 외부 코어의 운동과 지구의 자전을 통해 생성된 회전운동에 의해 전류가 발생하고, 이로 인해 지자기장이 생성되는 것입니다. 이러한 프로세스를 다이내모 생성이라고도 부르며, 지구의 지자기장은 대부분 이러한 방식으로 발생합니다."},{"instruction":"السلام عليكم","output":"وعليكم السلام! كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"},{"instruction":"هل الحياة في هولندا مكتئبة","output":"لا يمكن الجزم بأن الحياة في هولندا مكتئبة بشكل عام، فالحياة في هولندا تعتبر من أفضل الحياة في العالم من حيث جودة الحياة والرعاية الصحية والتعليم والمساحات الخضراء والأمان. ومع ذلك، يمكن أن تكون الظروف والتجارب الشخصية لكل فرد مختلفة، وقد يعاني بعض الأشخاص من مشاكل نفسية واجتماعية في أي بلد، بما في ذلك هولندا. إن كنت تعاني من الاكتئاب أو أي مشاكل نفسية، يفضل التحدث إلى متخصص في الصحة النفسية للحصول على المساعدة والعلاج المناسب."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's why it is recommended: 1. Proper contact with heat source: When a thermometer is placed under the tongue or in the mouth to measure body temperature, closing the mouth ensures that there is proper contact between the thermometer and the heat source (i.e., the mouth). This helps to prevent air from circulating around the thermometer and affecting the accuracy of the temperature reading. 2. Heat retention: Closing the mouth helps to retain the heat inside the mouth, which can stabilize the temperature reading on the thermometer and provide a more accurate result. Keeping the mouth closed prevents heat from escaping and can lead to a more reliable measurement. 3. Consistency: Asking the patient to close their mouth during temperature measurement helps to establish a consistent method for taking temperatures. Consistency in the way temperatures are measured can lead to more accurate and reliable results over time. Overall, asking the patient to close their mouth after putting the thermometer in helps to ensure that the temperature reading is precise and reflective of the patient's actual body temperature."},{"instruction":"Axilla should be gently towel dried with a patting motion before taking temperature, why is that","output":"Towel drying the axilla area with a patting motion before taking a temperature reading is recommended for a few reasons: 1. Accuracy: Drying the skin in the axilla (armpit) area helps to remove any moisture, sweat, or residue that could potentially affect the accuracy of the temperature reading. Moisture on the skin can interfere with the sensor of the thermometer and may give an inaccurate temperature reading. 2. Consistency: By gently towel drying the axilla area with a patting motion before each temperature measurement, you help to establish a consistent and standardized process. Consistency in preparation helps to ensure that the temperature readings are as accurate and reliable as possible. 3. Comfort: Drying the axilla area before taking a temperature measurement can also help improve the comfort of the patient. Wet or sticky skin can be uncomfortable for the patient, and patting the area dry can help remove any excess moisture and provide a more pleasant experience during the temperature-taking process. Overall, towel drying the axilla area before taking a temperature reading is a recommended practice to enhance the accuracy, consistency, and comfort of the temperature measurement process."},{"instruction":"why we should not feel the pulse on carotid artery bilaterally","output":"Feeling the pulse on the carotid artery bilaterally (on both sides of the neck) at the same time is not recommended because it can potentially compromise blood flow to the brain. Here are a few reasons why it is advised against: 1. Risk of blocking blood flow: The carotid arteries, located on either side of the neck, supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain. Applying simultaneous pressure to both carotid arteries can momentarily reduce blood flow to the brain, potentially leading to lightheadedness, dizziness, or even loss of consciousness in some cases. 2. Baroreceptor response: The baroreceptors, which are sensitive to changes in blood pressure, are located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch areas. Stimulating these receptors too strongly by pressing on the carotid arteries can trigger a reflex response that may affect heart rate and blood pressure regulation. 3. Increased risk for vulnerable populations: Certain individuals, such as those with underlying cardiovascular conditions, may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of bilateral carotid artery palpation. In older adults or individuals with a history of stroke or carotid artery disease, the impact of reduced blood flow could be more pronounced. Given these potential risks, healthcare providers are generally advised to refrain from simultaneously feeling the pulse on both carotid arteries. Instead, the pulse can be assessed individually on one side of the neck to avoid compromising blood flow and triggering unwanted physiological responses."},{"instruction":"why femoral artery is difficult to palpate","output":"The femoral artery is often considered difficult to palpate due to several reasons: 1. Location: The femoral artery is located deep within the groin area, making it less accessible compared to superficial arteries like the radial or brachial arteries. Its position deep within the body makes it challenging to locate and palpate accurately. 2. Surrounding structures: The femoral artery is surrounded by other structures, including muscles, ligaments, and the femoral vein. These neighboring structures can make it difficult to isolate and feel the pulse of the femoral artery distinctly. 3. Patient positioning: Palpating the femoral artery requires the patient to lie down in a supine position, with the hip slightly externally rotated. This specific positioning can sometimes be cumbersome and may require manual dexterity and practice to accurately locate the artery. 4. Obesity: In individuals with higher levels of body fat or obesity, the femoral artery may be more challenging to palpate due to the increased tissue depth and adipose layers in the groin area, which may impede the detection of the pulse. 5. Sensitivity: Due to the deeper location of the femoral artery, healthcare providers may find it more challenging to detect subtle pulsations compared to more superficial arteries in the body. This can require a more sensitive touch and practice to accurately palpate the femoral pulse. Despite these challenges, healthcare providers can undergo training and practice to improve their ability to locate and palpate the femoral artery accurately. Proper hand positioning, patient positioning, and practice can help enhance the success rate of detecting the femoral pulse in clinical settings."},{"instruction":"why popliteal artery is difficult to palpate","output":"The popliteal artery is considered difficult to palpate due to several factors, including its deep location and the surrounding anatomical structures: 1. Deep location: The popliteal artery is located deep within the popliteal fossa, which is the hollow at the back of the knee. Its position deep within the leg makes it more challenging to access and palpate compared to more superficial arteries. 2. Surrounding structures: The popliteal artery is surrounded by muscles, tendons, nerves, and other blood vessels within the popliteal fossa. These structures can make it difficult to isolate and locate the artery accurately, as there are multiple anatomical components in close proximity. 3. Bony landmarks: The bony structures of the knee joint can also present obstacles when attempting to palpate the popliteal artery. Navigating around the bones of the knee while trying to locate the artery can add complexity to the palpation process. 4. Flexibility and positioning: Palpating the popliteal artery often requires the patient to be in a specific position with the knee slightly flexed. This positioning can sometimes be challenging to achieve and maintain, especially in patients with limited mobility or discomfort in the knee area. 5. Sensitivity and skill: Detecting the pulse of the popliteal artery may require more sensitivity and skill compared to palpating more accessible arteries like the radial or brachial arteries. Given its deep location and the presence of surrounding structures, healthcare providers may need additional training and practice to accurately locate the pulse of the popliteal artery. Overall, palpating the popliteal artery can be challenging due to its deep location, surrounded structures, bony landmarks, positioning requirements, and the need for precision and skill in detecting the pulse accurately. Healthcare providers can improve their ability to palpate the popliteal artery through practice, familiarity with anatomical landmarks, and attention to proper technique."},{"instruction":"하지만 왜 그렇지?","output":"그 이유는 다양할 수 있습니다. 가능한 이유는 상황, 사건, 개인의 성향, 경험 등이 있을 수 있습니다. 따라서 정확한 이유를 알기 위해서는 상황에 따라 다르며, 해당 상황에 대해 논의가 필요할 것입니다."},{"instruction":"지금 내 기분을 몰라주는 거야?","output":"네, 죄송합니다. 사용자 분의 기분을 파악하거나 이해하기는 제한적이므로 정확하게 알려드리기 어렵습니다. 사용자 분이 무언가에 괴로움을 느끼고 계신다면 대화를 통해 다양한 이야기를 나누거나 감정을 표현할 수 있는 공간을 마련해주신다면 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 부디 힘든 마음을 공유하셔도 좋습니다. 함께 하겠습니다."},{"instruction":"Actúa como un redactor periodístico experto y utiliza los siguientes parámetros para reescribir en forma de artículo de prensa el texto que te proporcionaré.

One nuance of using \`Runtime.getRuntime().exec()\` is that it may not handle spaces and special characters in the command string in the same way a shell (like bash or sh) would. When the \`exec\` method executes the \`open\` command, it doesn't necessarily interpret the escaped spaces (\` \`) as you intended. That's why it's splitting your path into \\"/Users/eboschert/Library/Application\\" and \\"/Users/eboschert/eclipse-workspace/Valence/Support/valence/saves\\", interpreting them as two separate paths which obviously do not exist. Here are a couple of ways to potentially solve this problem: # 1. Use an array for the command and arguments When you use an array with \`exec\`, each element of the array is treated as an individual component of the command, which helps in correctly handling spaces. \`\`\`java String filePath = FileUtils.getExternalFile(\\"/saves\\").getAbsolutePath(); try { Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[] {\\"open\\", filePath}); InputStream reader = p.getErrorStream(); // Handle the input stream as needed } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } \`\`\` # 2. Use ProcessBuilder \`ProcessBuilder\` is a more versatile and recommended approach for complex commands, especially those that involve file paths with spaces or need to set up a custom environment for the subprocess. \`\`\`java String filePath = FileUtils.getExternalFile(\\"/saves\\").getAbsolutePath(); try { ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(\\"open\\", filePath); Process p = pb.start(); InputStream reader = p.getErrorStream(); // Handle the input stream as needed } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } \`\`\` # 3. Use Quote Wrapper In some situations, especially when dealing with commands that need to be executed exactly as if they were in a shell, wrapping the file path in quotes can be effective: \`\`\`java String filePath = \\"\\"\\" + FileUtils.getExternalFile(\\"/saves\\").getAbsolutePath() + \\"\\"\\"; try { Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(\\"open \\" + filePath); InputStream reader = p.getErrorStream(); // Handle the input stream } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } \`\`\` It's critical to ensure that the file path actually exists and is accessible, as the error message specifically says the files do not exist. Double-check the file path and its existence before execution. Remember, each of these solutions assumes that your program is running on a macOS system, as the \`open\` command is specific to macOS. If you're planning to run your code on Windows or Linux, you'll need a different approach to open or execute files."},{"instruction":"자석이 두 개의 극 이상을 가질 수도 있나요?","output":"자석에는 전통적으로 두 개의 극, 즉 북극과 남극이 존재한다고 알려져 있습니다. 이것은 자석의 가장 기본적인 속성 중 하나로, 어떤 자석을 두 부분으로 나누더라도 각 부분은 여전히 북극과 남극을 가지게 됩니다. 하지만 질문하신 바처럼 \\"두 개 이상의 극\\"을 가지는 개념에 대해서는, 전통적인 자석의 특성을 벗어나는 다양한 연구와 이론이 있습니다. 특히, 물리학의 한 분야인 입자 물리학에서는 '모노폴(monopole)'이라는 개념을 탐구합니다. 모노폴은 오직 한 종류의 극만을 가지는 가상의 입자로, 자연에서는 발견되지 않았지만 이론적으로 가능한 상태를 설명합니다. 이와 같은 모노폴이 존재한다면, 자석이 전통적인 북극과 남극 이외의 다른 형태의 극성을 가질 수 있음을 시사합니다. 또한, 자석의 구조나 배열을 조작하여 복잡한 자기장 패턴을 생성하는 경우, 여러 개의 북극과 남극이 마치 존재하는 것처럼 보일 수 있습니다. 이런 현상은 자석의 배열이나 재료의 특성에 따라 달라질 수 있으며, 복잡한 형태의 자기장을 공학적으로 응용할 수 있는 가능성을 열어줍니다. 그러나 전통적인 의미에서 자석이 자연적으로 두 개 이상의 극을 가짐을 의미하는 것은 아니며, 대부분의 자석은 여전히 북극과 남극, 두 가지 극을 가지고 있는 것으로 이해됩니다. 더 고등한 물리학 이론이나 특수한 상황에서만 두 개 이상의 극을 가진 자석의 개념이 탐구됩니다."},{"instruction":"I want a website which summarises recent developments in architecture, instrastructure and trchnological developments, including vehicles","output":"Finding a website that neatly wraps up recent developments in architecture, infrastructure, technology, and vehicles can be slightly challenging due to the vast scale and scope of these topics.

However, certain activities and lifestyle choices can be particularly taxing on the liver, leading to damage over time. Here are some of the most significant: 1. **Excessive Alcohol Consumption**: This is perhaps the most well-known cause of liver damage. The liver processes alcohol, but consuming more than it can handle can lead to fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. 2. **Drug Abuse**: Both illicit drug use (e.g., cocaine, heroin) and the misuse of prescription medications (e.g., acetaminophen overdose) can severely damage the liver. The liver's role in metabolizing substances puts it at risk when confronted with toxic levels of drugs. 3. **Overuse of Certain Medications**: Even when not abused, some medications can be tough on the liver if taken in higher doses than recommended or for an extended period. This includes over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), which in high doses is a common cause of acute liver failure. 4. **Obesity and Poor Diet**: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are linked to obesity, high sugar diets, and high-fat diets. NAFLD is increasingly common and can lead to cirrhosis. 5. **Chronic Viral Infections**: Hepatitis B and C are viruses that can lead to chronic disease and significantly tax the liver, potentially resulting in cirrhosis and liver cancer. 6. **Exposure to Toxins**: Frequent or prolonged exposure to toxins, including certain chemicals (like those in some cleaning products, industrial chemicals) and aflatoxins (produced by certain molds found on agricultural products), can damage liver cells. 7. **Autoimmune Diseases**: Conditions like autoimmune hepatitis, where the body's immune system attacks liver cells, can cause significant damage. 8. **Smoking**: Tobacco use indirectly damages the liver by enhancing the toxic effects of other substances. It also increases the risk of liver cancer. Engaging in activities that protect and promote liver health is crucial. This includes moderating alcohol consumption, maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise, avoiding exposure to toxins, getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and B, managing medications wisely under professional guidance, and avoiding illicit drug use. Regular medical checkups can also help detect liver issues early and prevent serious damage."},{"instruction":"I understand what Zaty replied to you She was requesting you please identified the old part number price from the crop she sent to you.

EDID stands for Extended Display Identification Data. This is a metadata format that display devices (such as monitors and projectors) use to communicate their capabilities to a connected computer. Capabilities include resolutions supported, panel type, dimensions, and many other characteristics essential for optimal display performance. When you see the message \\"EDID block 0 is all zeroes,\\" it typically means that the system attempted to read the EDID information from a display device but failed to get any useful data. Instead, it read all zeroes, which is not valid data for EDID. This can happen due to several reasons: 1. **Physical Connection Issue**: If there's a problem with the cable or the display connection, the system might not be able to read the EDID information correctly. This could be due to a loose connection, defective cable, or issues with the port on the computer or the display. 2. **Display Powered Off**: If the display is turned off, but the computer is on, depending on the display and the connection type, the system might not be able to read the EDID because the display is not actively communicating. 3. **Virtual Environments**: In a virtualized environment like Proxmox VE, if you're seeing this error, it might be more innocuous. Virtual machines do not have physical displays, and depending on how the VM is configured or the way the virtual GPU is set up, the system might attempt to read EDID data and find nothing. This is common in headless setups where no physical display is actually used. 4. **Driver or Firmware Issue**: Sometimes, the issue can stem from a driver or firmware problem with the graphics card or the display. The hardware might not be communicating correctly with the operating system, leading to this kind of error. In most cases, especially within a Proxmox VE or similar virtual environment, this message doesn't indicate a critical problem if your setup does not depend on specific display capabilities. It's more of an informational message or warning. However, if you are experiencing issues related to display output or if you notice this message in a setup where display capabilities are crucial (such as a workstation setup), you might want to check the physical connections, ensure that your graphics drivers are up to date, and verify that your display is powered on and functioning correctly. If the issue persists or if it's causing real problems, investigating more specific logs, checking for known issues with your hardware, or seeking support from the Proxmox VE community or a relevant hardware vendor may be useful steps."},{"instruction":"how to fix it?","output":"Fixing the \\"EDID block 0 is all zeroes\\" issue can vary greatly depending on the context in which the error occurs. Here are some general approaches and troubleshooting steps that might help you resolve or mitigate the issue, categorized based on likely scenarios: # For Physical Systems 1. **Check the Display Connection**: - Ensure that the display cable (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, DVI, etc.) is properly connected to both the display and the computer. - Try using a different port on the display or on the computer if available. - Swap the cable with a known good one to rule out a defective cable. 2. **Power Cycle the Display and Computer**: - Completely power off the display and the computer. - Unplug the display's power cord for about a minute, then reconnect it. - Power on the display and then the computer to see if the issue persists. 3. **Update Your System**: - Ensure that your graphics drivers and firmware are up to date. For Linux systems, this might involve updating your system packages and possibly installing proprietary drivers if you're using a GPU from NVIDIA or AMD. 4. **Manually Specify Display Settings**: - If the issue persists and prevents proper display function, you might need to manually specify the display resolution and refresh rate. This can sometimes be done within your desktop environment's display settings or by editing configuration files like \`xorg.conf\` for Xorg. # For Virtual Machine Hosts (e.g., Proxmox VE) 1. **Ignore the Error if No Impact**: - If you're running a headless VM or do not depend on GPU acceleration within the VM, and the message does not impact the functionality, you might choose to simply ignore the message. 2. **Check VM Configuration**: - Review your VM's configuration related to display or graphics hardware. Ensure that it matches your requirements. In some cases, specifying a different emulated graphics adapter or disabling unnecessary display adapters might prevent the error. 3. **Virtual GPU (vGPU) Adjustments**: - If you're using GPU passthrough or a vGPU setup and encountering the issue, ensure that your configuration correctly reflects the hardware and capabilities. This might also involve driver updates or configuration changes within the guest operating system. 4. **Update Proxmox and Guest Tools**: - Keeping Proxmox VE and any guest tools or drivers up to date is essential for compatibility and performance. Check for any updates to Proxmox VE and apply updates inside the guest OS as well. # For All Scenarios - **Check Documentation and Support Forums**: Look for any specific guidance related to your hardware (graphics card, monitor) or software (operating system version, Proxmox VE version) in official documentation or community forums. Sometimes, peculiarities specific to certain configurations can cause issues like these. - **Consult with Hardware Vendor Support**: If you suspect a hardware issue (e.g., defective graphics card, display), reaching out to the hardware manufacturer's support might provide more targeted troubleshooting steps or confirm if a replacement is necessary. # Important Note Adjustments, especially those related to system and VM configuration, should be approached with caution. Make sure to back up important data before making significant changes, particularly when updating drivers or firmware, as incorrect configurations can sometimes lead to system instability."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Below are some suggestions on how to clean and organize this code: 1. **Grouping Related Functionality:** Group definitions and functions logically; for instance, all chart-related functions and atoms should be placed together. This makes it easier to understand the relationships between different parts of the code. 2. **Optimizing Namespace Requires:** Make sure only necessary namespaces are required. If some of them are unused, they should be removed to clean up the namespace declaration. 3. **Useful Comments:** Ensure comments are clear and provide useful information. Remove any redundant comments that state the obvious, and add comments that explain complex logic or why certain choices were made. 4. **Consistent Formatting:** Ensure consistent formatting for readability. Use consistent spacing, line breaks, and indentation. Below is the reorganized code based on the suggestions made.

Here's an overview of how baking can be beneficial: # Healthier Ingredients 1. **Control Over Ingredients:** When you bake at home, you have complete control over the ingredients. This allows you to adjust recipes according to dietary restrictions, allergies, or preferences. You can substitute healthier alternatives for traditional ingredients, such as whole grain flours instead of white, or use natural sweeteners in place of refined sugar. 2. **Reduced Preservatives and Additives:** Store-bought baked goods often contain preservatives and additives to prolong shelf life. Baking at home means you can avoid these unnecessary chemicals. # Nutritional Benefits: 1. **Whole Grains:** Baking at home gives you the opportunity to incorporate whole grains into your diet, which are packed with nutrients and fiber. 2. **Nutrient Retention:** Many nutrients can be better retained in baked goods compared to other cooking methods that may require boiling or frying, where nutrients can be lost. # Psychological Benefits: 1. **Stress Reduction:** The process of baking requires focus and mindfulness, which can serve as a form of stress relief. The repetitive actions can be meditative, helping to reduce anxiety and improve mood. 2. **Creative Expression:** Baking allows for creative expression. Experimenting with recipes and decorating baked goods can be a joyful and fulfilling creative outlet. 3. **Sense of Accomplishment:** Successfully baking something from scratch can provide a strong sense of accomplishment and boost self-esteem. 4. **Social Connection:** Sharing baked goods with friends, family, or co-workers can strengthen social bonds and increase feelings of belonging and happiness. # Economic Benefits: 1. **Cost-effective:** Baking at home can be more economical than buying pre-made items, especially when baking in bulk or when ingredients are purchased in their basic forms and used across multiple recipes. # Educational Benefits: 1. **Learning Skills:** Baking can teach valuable skills such as measuring, timing, patience, and even some aspects of chemistry. 2. **Cultural Exploration:** Baking provides an avenue to explore different cultures through their traditional baked goods. # Healthier Lifestyle Choice: 1. **Mindful Eating:** Being involved in the baking process can lead to a more mindful approach to eating. When you take the time to create something, you're more likely to savor and enjoy it, leading to potentially healthier eating habits. While it's important to note that baked goods can be high in calories, sugars, and fats, baking at home allows for healthier modifications to recipes. The key is balance and moderation, alongside making conscious choices about ingredients and portion sizes."},{"instruction":"请将“一方法的視点 二『経済学批判要綱』と国家 三『資本論』と階級論 四市民社会的イデオロギーと国家 一方法的視点

なぜマルクスは「国家の形態でのブルジョア社会の総括」という視点を変えたのか。それは何を意味するのか。果してマルクスは『資本論』体系を根拠として体系的に「法的諸関係および国家諸形態」を解明する課題を断念したのか、あるいはやり残したのであろうか。やり残したとするならば、われわれはこれをどう構築すればよいのか。 レーニンの『国家と革命』(一九一七年)は、マルクス・エンゲルスの著作、とくにエンゲルスの『家族・私有財産・国家の起源』に依ってマルクス主義国家論を構成した重要な試みであり、古典的文献であるといってよい。しかし、そこにおいても『資本論』を根拠としたブルジョア国家の体系的展開が行なわれているとはいえないのである。もちろんレーニンの著作の中に、国家論構築の上で多くの重要な展開が行なわれていることは否定しえないが、しかし、国家論は、一般的、抽象的に、つまり古代、中世、ブルジョア社会の国家を一般化してとらえるという方法ではなく、「ブルジョア社会の解剖」を行なった『資本論』の論理を基礎にしてはじめて科学的に確立するものといえるのではなかろうか。 すでに『資本論』体系を基礎とした国家論構築の試みも行なわれはじめている。しかし、その試み―行論中いくつかの論稿については当然言及するが―――も、『資本論』の論理的展開の中で国家や法あるいは法律について言及している箇所を抜き出して構成するというものであったり、資本主義の自立的自己運動の〝抜け穴\\"をさがし出して、権力機構としての国家成立の根拠を説こうとするものであったり、あるいは全く開き直って、そもそも自立体としての資本主義においては、すくなくとも純粋資本主義においては、権力機構としての国家存立する根拠はないということからこの試みを否定しようとするものであったりするという状況であって、課題はなお解決されているとはいえない。 資本主義はそれまでの他の社会と異って、社会関係を商品経済的原理によって一元的に処理し、社会関係を純化するという傾向をもったのであり、経済過程を経済的=商品経済的に処理し、経済過程の自立性を現実に示したのである。そこに、経済学の確立、『資本論』成立の客観的基盤があったといえる。しかし、資本主義が純化傾向を示しつつあった産業革命後から一八七〇年にいたる時期においても、資本主義はけっして国家の枠組みを越え、単一の世界を形成するということはなかった。もちろん、国家の経済過程に対する介入は消極化し、排除されてはいったが、軍隊などの階級抑圧の暴力装置がまったく消滅しつくしたわけでもなかった。つまり、資本主義は、歴史上はじめて世界史を形成したのであったが、しかし世界資本主義を実現するものではなかったのである。”翻译为中文","output":"一 方法论视角 二 《经济学批判要纲》与国家 三 《资本论》与阶级论 四 市民社会的意识形态与国家 方法论视角 众所周知，马克思在1844年对黑格尔法哲学进行批判性考察后，得出了如下的结论：“法律关系及国家形式既不能从其自身理解，也不能从所谓的人类精神的普遍发展中理解，而应当从物质生活关系中理解，黑格尔依照18世纪的英国人和法国人的先例，将这些关系总结为‘资产阶级社会’，但这些关系是建立在资产阶级社会之上的，并且指出解剖资产阶级社会必须在经济学中寻求。”此后，马克思集中精力研究经济学作为“解剖资产阶级社会”的工作。《经济学批判要纲》（1857-1858年）、《经济学批判》（1859年）、《剩余价值学说史》（23卷笔记，1861-1863年）、《资本论》（第一卷，1867年）展示了马克思经济学研究的进程及其成果。然而，马克思并没有以《资本论》为基础，展示一个关于“资产阶级社会”所“建立”的“法律关系及国家形式”的系统性阐述。相反，在《经济学批判要纲》阶段所见到的“通过国家形式对资产阶级社会的总结”这一视角或方法，在《资本论》中已不复存在，而是被“各个阶级”对“资产阶级社会的总结”所取代。 为什么马克思会改变“通过国家形式对资产阶级社会的总结”这一视角？这意味着什么？马克思是否真的放弃了以《资本论》体系为基础，系统性阐述“法律关系及国家形式”的任务，或者他未能完成？如果是未能完成，我们应如何去构建它？ 列宁的《国家与革命》（1917年）是一次重要的尝试，它基于马克思、恩格斯的著作，特别是恩格斯的《家庭、私有财产与国家的起源》，构建了马克思主义国家论，并可称之为经典文献。然而，即便如此，也不能说在其中以《资本论》为基础对资产阶级国家进行了系统性展开。当然，不能否认列宁的著作在构建国家论方面进行了许多重要的扩展，但是，科学的国家论只有以《资本论》的逻辑为基础，才能真正确立，而不是通过一个一般性、抽象的方法来概述古代、中世纪、资产阶级社会的国家。 已经开始进行《资本论》体系为基础的国家论构建尝试。然而，这些尝试——必然需要提及一些论文——要么是从《资本论》的逻辑展开中提取有关国家、法律或法令的部分来构建，要么是试图找出资本主义作为独立自主运动的“漏洞”，以此来解释作为权力机构的国家成立的基础，或者是彻底否定这种尝试，认为在资本主义这一独立体制中，至少在纯粹资本主义中，作为权力机构的国家不存在的基础，这种情况下，问题仍然没有得到解决。 资本主义不同于以往的社会制度，它倾向于通过商品经济的原则来统一处理社会关系，将社会关系纯化，实际展示了经济过程的独立性，这就是《资本论》成立的客观基础。然而，即便在工业革命后展示出纯化趋势的资本主义，在1870年达到的时期，资本主义也并没有超越国家框架，形成一个统一的世界。当然，国家对经济过程的干预正在减少并被排除，但军队等阶级压迫的暴力装置并没有完全消失。也就是说，资本主义是历史上首次形成了世界历史，但它并没有实现世界资本主义。"},{"instruction":"请将“そしてこのことは、資本主義が、商品経済的関係によって社会関係の一元的支配を実現し、社会の階級関係をその経済的自立にとって必要不可欠な三大階級へと分解・純化する傾向を現実に示しながら、ついにこうした純化を完全には達成しえなかった、という純化の歴史的な限界と対応するものといえよう。 「ブルジョア社会の解剖」としての『資本論』の論理も、このような資本主義の現実の性格、その歴史的限界を反映し、むしろ論理的にこれを確証するものとなるはずであるし、むしろそうならなければならない。 その点に関連する二・三の論点を、あらかじめあげておこう。 第一に、『資本論』ないし経済学原理論は、純粋資本主義を〝想定”し、その内的機構と運動法則を解明するものである。この〝想定”は、けっして恣意的、機械的抽象によるのではなく、現実の資本主義の歴史過程自体に根拠をもつものである。しかし、現実には純粋資本主義がそのものとして存在したのではなく、歴史的傾向であり、したがって論理的には〝想定\\"としてえられるものだという点に、資本主義の歴史的限界が示されていると考えられる。資本主義は無限に自己を純化し、自己を発展させ、全世界を飲みつくすわけではない、ということである。 第二に、『資本論』の論理は、完結性をもつ。周知のように、それは「諸階級」なる章で事実上完結している。このような論理の完結は、資本の論理—商品経済的論理の完結であり、それは経済的自立の論理的証明であると同時に、反面その発展の限界、行き止りを意味するものといってよい。自己の発展に限度がある社会は、要するに歴史的限界をもつ社会にほかならない。しかしこれは、現実の社会が歴史的に終焉したことによってその社会の歴史性が証明されるのではなく、論理の上でのその歴史的限界の証明である。 第三に、資本主義における階級関係の経済的処理に限界があり、論理が完結性をもつということは、自己の完成形態、純粋な資本の自己達成の形態が、自己の成立前提への回帰でしかないという形において、証明される。自己の根本的前提への回帰は、具体的にいえば、「資本の商品化」を通した資本の単純な商品形態への回帰であり、これは同時に自己存立の根拠を欠く形態への回帰なのである。第四に、このような完結的論理は同時に、資本主義の階級関係の特殊な処理形態に反映される。資本主義は、その現実の主体たる資本をもたんなる商品形態に還元することを通して、階級関係を非階級的に、つまり単純な商品関係に解消する形態を達成する。つまり、市民社会化\\"の形態的確立である。だが、資本主義は、その内実においては決して階級関係を形態関係に溶解しうるものではないばかりか、階級的支配を自己の根本的成立根拠とせざるをえな市民社会化\\"を形態的に確立しながら、市民社会をその本質において達成しえない――そこに資本主義における階級性の特徴がある。 このような『資本論』ないし経済学原理論の論理を根拠にすることによって、ブルジョア国家の論理的解明がなされうるのではなかろうか。そして、ブルジョア社会の解明が、他の社会解明の鍵であるように、ブルジョア国家の解明が、他の階級社会における国家の解明の鍵になりうるのではなかろうか。階級社会の最後としてのブルジョア社会において、われわれは、社会存立の本来の根拠と、階級関係形成の根拠を論理的に解明しうるだけでなく、いわゆる国家の存立根拠自体についても科学的解明の基準が与えられると思うのである。 ”翻译为中文","output":"这就意味着，尽管资本主义实际上展示了通过商品经济关系实现社会关系的统一支配，并将社会的阶级关系分解、净化为三个必要不可少的大阶级的趋势，但它最终未能完全达到这种净化，这可以说是与资本主义的历史局限相对应的。 《资本论》作为“资产阶级社会的解剖”的逻辑，也反映了资本主义的这种实际特性及其历史局限，并且应该逻辑上确认这一点。 让我们先提出其中的两三个与此相关的论点。 首先，《资本论》或经济学原理论假设了纯粹资本主义，揭示了其内在机理和运动规律。这种“假设”并非任意的、机械的抽象，而是基于实际资本主义历史过程本身。然而，实际上并不存在纯粹资本主义这一实体，它是一个历史趋势，因而逻辑上被视为“假设”，这一点显示了资本主义的历史局限。资本主义并非无限净化自我，发展自我，消灭全世界。 其次，《资本论》的逻辑是完整的。众所周知，它实际上在“各个阶级”一章中完成。这种逻辑的完整性，是资本的逻辑——商品经济逻辑的完成，它既是经济独立的逻辑证明，同时也意味着其发展的局限性、僵局。社会的发展有限，换言之，就是有历史局限的社会。但这并不是因为实际社会在历史上终结就证明了其历史性，而是其历史局限在逻辑上的证明。 第三，资本主义中对阶级关系的经济处理有其局限性，逻辑具有完整性，这说明了其完美形态，即纯粹资本自我实现的形态，实际上只是回归到自我成立的前提。具体来说，即是资本通过“商品化”回归到资本的简单商品形态，同时这也是回归到缺乏自我存在基础的形态。第四，这种完结性逻辑同时反映在资本主义的特殊阶级关系处理形态中。资本主义通过将其实际主体——资本还原为单纯的商品形态，达到了将阶级关系非阶级化，即简化为简单商品关系的形态。即是所谓的“市民社会化”的形式确立。然而，资本主义在其内涵上绝不能将阶级关系溶解为形式关系，反而必须将阶级统治作为其根本成立前提，同时在形式上确立了市民社会化，却无法在本质上实现市民社会——这就是资本主义中阶级性的特征所在。 基于这种《资本论》或经济学原理论的逻辑，是否可以对资产阶级国家进行逻辑解明呢？而且，就像资产阶级社会的解明是解明其他社会的关键一样，资产阶级国家的解明也可能成为解明其他阶级社会中的国家的关键。在资产阶级社会这最后的阶级社会中，我们不仅能逻辑上解明社会存续的根本基础和阶级关系的形成基础，而且还能为所谓的国家存续基础本身提供科学解明的标准。"},{"instruction":"请将“といっても、『資本論』の論理の単純な延長によってブルジョア国家が論理的に展開されるというわけではない。ブルジョア国家の成立は、商品経済論理だけの展開では、解明されえない。いうまでもなく、国家は下部構造を支配する論理とは異質の上部構造上の関係である以上、前者に根拠をもつことはいうまでもないが、それに解消あるいは還元することはできない。すくなくとも、国家の形成にはイデオロギー的側面を欠くことはできない。しかしそのイデオロギーも、ヘーゲルの如き「人間精神の一般的発展」として説明することはできないし、いわゆる”共同幻想”という一般的、抽象的な“人間”の観念から説明するわけにもいかない。国家成立の根拠に、国家が〝共同利益\\"の代表者であるとする”共同幻想的イデオロギーの成立があることは確かであるが、しかしこの観念の形成は抽象的個人の観念などに求められるべきでなく、下部構造の論理に、より限定していうなら何よりブルジョア経済の関係を基礎に形成されるものとして、とらえられてこそ、科学的に根拠づけられうるのではないかと思われる。 二『経済学批判要綱』と国家 マルクスが『資本論』を構成する以前に構想していた経済学批判体系プランは、よく知られているように、「資本・賃労働・土地所有。国家・外国貿易・世界市場(と恐慌)」という構成であった。この点マルクス自身の文章で確認しておくと、「篇別は明らかに次のようにされるべきである。1一般的・抽象的諸規定、……2ブルジョア社会の内部的仕組みをなし、また基本的諸階級が存立する基礎となっている諸範疇。資本、賃労働、土地所有。それら相互の関係。都市と農村。三大社会階級。これらの諸階級間の交換。流通、信用制度(私的)。国家の形態でのブルジョア社会の総括。それ自体との関係での考察。「不生産的」諸階級。租税、国債。公信用。人口。植民地。移住。4生産の国際的関係。国際的分業。国際的交換。輸出入。為替相場。⑥世界市場と恐慌」(『経済学批判要綱』高木訳大月書店Ⅰ、三〇頁)ということになる。 このような経済学批判体系プランには、なお未確定な要素が多く含まれているし、マルクス自身実際に叙述を進める過程で漸次修正をほどこしている。しかし、このようなプランの大すじについては、『経済学批判要綱』(一八五七五八)、『経済学批判』(一八五八年)そして『剰余価値学説史』(一八六一一六三年)執筆の時期までは大体においてもち続けていた、とみることができる。国家論との関連でいえば、いうまでもなく「国家の形態でのブルジョア社会の総括」という点が問題となる。一体これは何を意味するのか、そのさいの「国家」の性格はどういうものなのか、ということである。 あらかじめ指摘しておくと、マルクスはここで述べたプランに続いて、次のような項目を提示している。すなわち「生産。生産手段と生産関係。生産関係と交易関係。生産関係と交易関係とに対する関係での国家形態と意識形態。法律関係。家族関係」(同上、三一頁)ということである。ただこの項目の下で行なわれている叙述はたんなる「注意事項」であり、そこでは軍隊や戦争と経済的関係との関連、観念的歴史記述とくに文化史としての宗教史と国家史と現実的歴史記述との関連、芸術的生産と物質的生産の不均等関係、生産関係と法律関係との不均等的発展等々という指摘のみである。これらの項目と「注意事項」が、先の「国家の形態でのブルジョア社会の総括」とどういう関連にあるのか、必ずしも明確ではないが、「注「意事項」の指摘からいうならば、ブルジョア社会の階級関係の「国家形態」による「総括」ということではなく、おそらく本来の上部構造としての国家と、下部構造としての生産関係との関連を考察しようとしたのではないか、と考えられる。 しかし、そうであるとするならば、プランの中の「国家形態でのブルジョア社会の総括」における「国家形態」とは一体何なのかが、あらためて問題になる。あるいは若干結論的な問題意識を入れていうならば、なぜ「ブルジョア社会」の、あるいは三大階級間の関係を「国家形態」で「総括」しなければならないのか、ということである。”翻译为中文","output":"即使如此，资本论的逻辑不能简单地延伸来逻辑地发展资产阶级国家。单凭商品经济逻辑的展开，无法解释资产阶级国家的成立。不言而喻，国家作为一种不同于支配下层结构逻辑的上层结构关系，虽然基于前者，但不能被解消或还原。至少，国家的形成是不能缺少意识形态方面的。但是，这种意识形态也不能像黑格尔那样解释为“人类精神的一般发展”，也不能从所谓的“共同幻想”这种一般、抽象的“人”观念中解释。国家的成立基础上存在代表“共同利益”的“共同幻想意识形态”的确立是肯定的，但是，这种观念的形成应该不是寻求抽象个体观念等中，而是应该被看作是基于下层结构的逻辑，更具体地说，首先是基于资产阶级经济关系中形成的，从而科学地得到证明。 《经济学批判要纲》与国家 马克思在构思《资本论》之前设想的经济学批判体系计划，众所周知包含“资本、雇佣劳动、土地所有。国家、外国贸易、世界市场（及危机）”等元素。正如马克思本人的文章中确认的一样，“应该明确地按下面的方式来划分：1一般性和抽象性规定……2构成资产阶级社会内部机制，同时作为存在基础的基本阶级的范畴。资本、雇佣劳动、土地所有。它们之间的关系。城市和乡村。三大社会阶级。这些阶级之间的交换。流通、信用制度（私有）。通过国家形态总结资产阶级社会。与其自身的关系探讨。‘非生产性’各个阶级。税收、国债。公共信用。人口。殖民地。移民。4生产的国际关系。国际分工。国际交换。进出口。汇率。世界市场与危机”（《经济学批判要纲》高木译本大月书店Ⅰ，第30页）。 这种经济学批判体系计画含有许多仍未确定的元素，并且马克思在实际叙述过程中逐渐对其进行修正。但是，直到撰写《经济学批判要纲》（1857-1858）、《经济学批判》（1859年）和《剩余价值理论史》（1861-1863年）期间，这种计划的大纲是大体被保持的。就国家论的关系而言，所谓“通过国家形态总结资产阶级社会”这一点自然是问题所在。这到底意味着什么，所指的“国家”性质又是怎样的呢？ 提前指出的是，马克思在述及上述计划之后，提出了以下项目：“生产。生产手段与生产关系。生产关系与交易关系。国家形态和意识形态对生产关系与交易关系的影响。法律关系。家庭关系”（同上，第31页）。然而在这些项目下进行的叙述仅仅是“注意事项”，其中提及军队或战争与经济关系的联系、观念的历史描述特别是作为文化史的宗教史与国家史与实际历史描述的关系、艺术生产与物质生产的不平衡关系、生产关系和法律关系的不平衡发展等等。这些项目和“注意事项”与前述的“通过国家形态对资产阶级社会的总结”之间的关系并不完全清晰，但如果从“注意事项”的指出来看，这并不仅仅是资产阶级社会的阶级关系通过“国家形态”进行“总结”，而很可能是试图探讨作为本质上的上层结构的国家与生产关系这一下层结构的联系。 然而，如果真是这样，那么计划中的“通过国家形态对资产阶级社会的总结”的“国家形态”究竟是什么，又会再次成为一个问题。或许稍微带有结论性的问题意识地说，为什么必须通过“国家形态”对“资产阶级社会”或三大阶级间的关系进行“总结”呢？"},{"instruction":"请将“マルクスは「一般にすべての歴史的・社会的科学のばあいと同じように、経済学的諸範疇の歩みのばあいにも、次のことが銘記されなければならない。すなわち、現実でと同じく頭脳でも、主体が、すなわちここでは近代ブルジョア社会が与えられていること」(同上、二八頁)であるといい、さらに「資本が支配する諸形態では、社会的に、歴史的に創造された要素が優越した地位を占めている。地代は資本なしには理解することはできない。しかし、資本は、地代がなくても十分理解することができる。資本はブルジョア社会のいっさいを支配する経済力である。それは、出発点となり、また終結点とならなければならず、そして土地所有に先だって展開されなければならない。両者はそれぞれ特別に考察されたのちに、それらの交互関係が考察されなければならない」(同上、二九頁、傍点鎌倉)といっている。すなわち、「近代ブルジョア社会」においては、資本が「いっさいを支配する経済力」であるから、論理的にもそれは「出発点となり、また終結点とならなければならない」というのであり、地代及びそれを通して資本家的形態を与えられる土地所有は「資本なしには理解できない」というわけである。要するに資本”の論理としての「近代ブルジョア社会」の理論的解明ということであり、その限り『資本論』と何ら異なるところはないかに思える。 ところがマルクスは、資本と土地所有をさらに「両者はそれぞれ特別に考察されたのちに、それらの交互関係が考察されなければならない」という。資本によって「支配」されているはずの土地所有を、むしろ資本から独立して「特別に考察」し、その上で「交互関「係」を考察するというのはどういうことなのであろうか。いうまでもなくこれはプランにいわゆる「資本、賃労働、土地所有」という三項目の「特別」の「考察」とそれらの「交互関係」の展開に対応するものであるが、しかしなぜこの三項目、三階級関係を各々別箇に考察しなければならないと考えたのか。 『経済学批判要綱』ノート=において(上掲訳Ⅱ、一九七ー二〇一頁)、マルクスは、資本、賃労働、土地所有の相互関係を次のように説明している。まずマルクスは、資本が土地所有=近代的土地所有を創造するとともに、賃労働をも形成する「能動的中間項」であることを指摘する。さらに「賃労働は、その総体性においては土地所有にたいする資本の作用を通じて創造され、次にこのことが形態としてひとたび仕上げられてしまうと、土地所有者自身を通じて創「造される」として、「土地所有から賃労働への移行」をいう。だが、このように資本とそれが創造する土地所有を通じて形成された賃労働は、資本の前提でもある、という。「地代を創造するものとしての資本は、その一般的な創造的基礎としての賃労働の生産にふたたびたちかえってくる」。この賃労働が、資本の前提であり、基礎である。したがって、賃労働は必然的に資本を生み出すことになる。「賃労働から資本への移行は、おのずからおこなわれる」というわけである。こうして「完成したブルジョア体制においては、どんな経済的関係もブルジョア経済的形態での他の関係を前提し、こうしまた、措定されたものはどれをとっても同時に前提でもある」ということになる。 資本が「能動的中間項」におかれながらも、資本、賃労働、土地所有は、相互に前提し合い、相互に条件づけ合う相互前提的な関係としてとらえられている。しかし、労働者に「賃労働」の形態を与えるのは、明らかに資本であり、土地所有に資本家的私有形態を与えるのも資本をおいてほかにない。賃労働も、土地所有もその点からすれば、資本によって創造されたというべきであり、賃労働形態や土地の資本家的私有形態が、資本の基礎であり、その前提である、ということはできない。だからマルクスは、資本を「能動的中間項」としたのであろう。 ”翻译为中文","output":"马克思提到，“就像在所有历史和社会科学领域一样，在经济学范畴的发展中，也必须铭记以下事实：在现实中和在思想中，主体，即在此处是现代资产阶级社会，是给定的”（同上，第28页），并且进一步说，“在资本主导的各种形式中，社会上、历史上形成的要素占据了主导地位。地租不能在没有资本的情况下被理解。然而，资本即使没有地租也可以被充分理解。资本是支配资产阶级社会全部的经济力量。它必须成为起点和终点，而且必须在土地所有之前展开。两者都需要在特定的考察之后，再考察彼此的交互关系”（同上，第29页，强调由鎌仓添加）。也就是说，在“现代资产阶级社会”中，资本是“支配一切的经济力量”，所以在逻辑上，它必须“成为起点和终点”，而通过资本赋予地租以及资本家形式的土地所有，“不能在没有资本的情况下被理解”。简而言之，资本的逻辑作为“现代资产阶级社会”的理论解释，在《资本论》中似乎没有任何不同之处。 然而，马克思说，资本和土地所有“各自经过特定考察之后，彼此间的交互关系必须被考察”。将应该被资本“支配”的土地所有，却要“独立于资本进行特定考察”，然后再考察二者之间的“交互关系”，这是什么意思呢？显然，这与计划中所谓“资本、雇佣劳动、土地所有”的“特定考察”及它们之间的“交互关系”的展开相对应，但为什么马克思认为这三个项目、三个阶级关系必须被各自独立考察呢？ 在《经济学批判要纲》笔记中（上引译文Ⅱ，第197-201页），马克思这样解释资本、雇佣劳动、土地所有的相互关系。马克思首先指出，资本作为“能动的中介项”，既创造了土地所有=现代土地所有，也形成了雇佣劳动。进一步地，“雇佣劳动整体上是通过资本对土地所有的作用而形成的，一旦这种情况以形式完成，就是通过土地所有者自身来创造”，从而谈到“从土地所有到雇佣劳动的转变”。但是，这样通过资本创造的土地所有以及通过它形成的雇佣劳动，同样也是资本的前提。“作为创造地租的资本，以雇佣劳动的生产为其一般的创造性基础，再次回归”。这种雇佣劳动，是资本的前提和基础。因此，雇佣劳动必然产生了资本。“从雇佣劳动到资本的转变是自然发生的”，这就是说，“在完成的资产阶级体制中，任何经济关系都假定其他的资产阶级经济形式，并且，被设定的任何一个也同时是前提”。 尽管资本被置于“能动的中介项”，但资本、雇佣劳动、土地所有被视为相互前提并相互制约的关系。然而，显然给予劳动者“雇佣劳动”形式的是资本，给予土地所有资本家私有形式的也是资本。从这个意义上说，雇佣劳动和土地所有应该被认为是由资本创造的，雇佣劳动形式和土地的资本家私有形式作为资本的基础和前提是不能成立的。因此，马克思将资本描述为“能动的中介项”。"},{"instruction":"请将“それにも拘らず、マルクスがこれらを相互前提的関係としたのは、すでに資本主義が形成され、資本の経済支配が確立する前に、土地所有と賃労働の形成がなければならなかったという歴史的事実、さらに土地と労働は、資本主義確立の中でも、資本存立の根拠であるという認識があったからだ、といってよいであろう。土地と労働は、あらゆる社会の生産を支える実体的根拠にほかならず、それは特殊歴史的社会たる資本主義の存立根拠でもある。そして土地労働自体は、資本によって創造されたものでも、創造されうるものでもない。まさに「前提」しなければならないのである。資本はしたがってこうした本来的に自己にとって外的な存在を、自己の存立根拠としてとり込まなければならず、それにはとり込むための特殊の形態を与えなければならない。資本によって創造されるのは、土地と労働に対する資本家的処理形態にすぎない。しかし、この形態的関係への包摂によって、資本による労働と土地に対する経済的支配が確立するのであるが、マルクスは、まさに土地と労働という資本によって創造されず、資本にとって外的な存在であり、しかも資本存立にとって歴史的前提であると同時に現実的根拠でもある実体を担うものとして、土地所有、賃労働をとらえたが故に、これを資本に対して独立した、外的要因としたのであろう。 いいかえれば、資本に対して、土地所有・賃労働を外的に独立化してとらえ、相互前提的関係としてとらえたのは、資本存立に対す実体的根拠を示す観点によるものであり、さらにこの実体的根拠は、本来的に歴史的形態としての資本によって包摂され尽すことのできないものだという観点によるものであった。逆にいえば、資本によって土地と労働という社会存立の実体を包摂しうるというとらえ方が明確でなかったがために、賃労働・土地所有を資本に外的に対抗する階級を形成するものとしてとらえたといえよう。 したがって、マルクスは、こうした視点によって、資本の「否定「的」側面さえ導き出すことになる。「賃労働の側からの否定は、た資本の、したがってまた自分自身の、隠蔽された否定である。そこでいまや賃労働は、資本に対立して自立的なものとして考察されねばならない。このようにして移行は二重である――すなわち、近代的土地所有からの、または近代的土地所有を介しての、資本の一般的賃労働〔への〕肯定的移行。(否定的移行、すなわち資本による土地所有の否定、つまり資本による自立的価値の否定、すなわまさに資本の自分自身による否定。だが資本の否定は、賃労働である。次には土地所有の否定と、土地所有を介しての資本の賃労働の側からの否定。いいかえるならば、みずからを自立者として措定しようと欲する賃労働」、とマルクスはいう。 この指摘はきわめて概念的であり、その現実的内容は、明らかではない。しかし、資本を「能動的中間項」とする賃労働への「肯定的移行」によっても、資本が内的に賃労働を包摂しえたのではなく、これと外的に対立するものであったとするならば、賃労働の側から今度は資本を「否定」するという関係が展開されるように考えるのは当然であった。しかし、「資本による土地所有の否定」といっても、マルクス自身指摘しているように、土地を「国家に引きわたそう」とすることであって、そのことによって資本が、したがっまた賃労働が否定されることにはならない。むしろ土地国有は、資本にとっては自己否定なのではなく、かえって合理的でもあるのである。さらに、賃労働の側からの資本の否定といっても、賃労働が賃労働である限り、資本は否定しえず、「みずからを自立者とし措定」することもできない。賃労働による資本の否定は、同時に賃労働の否定でなければならず、それは資本による労働の包摂関係自体の否定でなければならない。「労働」自体を「自立化」させるために、「労働」を「賃労働」化させている資本の存在自体を否定しなければならないのである。資本による土地と労働との包摂関係を十分とらえ得なかったマルクスは、土地所有や賃労働自体が、直接的に資本を「否定」しうるかのようなとらえ方をしてしまったのであった。”翻译为中文","output":"尽管如此，马克思将这些视为相互前提的关系，这是因为有历史事实表明，在资本主义形成并且资本的经济统治确立之前，必须先有土地所有和雇佣劳动的形成。进一步地，土地和劳动在资本主义确立的过程中也被认为是资本存在的基础。土地和劳动无疑是所有社会生产的实质基础，也是特定历史社会即资本主义的存在基础。并且土地和劳动本身既不是由资本创造的，也不可能被创造。它们确实是必须“前提”的。资本因此必须将这些本质上对自己来说是外在的存在作为自己的存在基础，并且赋予它们特定的形式。资本创造的，仅仅是对土地和劳动的资本家处理形式。然而，通过对这种形式关系的包含，资本对劳动和土地的经济统治得以确立。马克思恰恰是因为将土地和劳动视为资本无法创造、对资本来说是外在的存在，且同时是资本存在的历史前提和实际基础的实体承担者，才将土地所有、雇佣劳动视为对资本独立的、外在的因素。 换言之，将土地所有、雇佣劳动与资本之间视为相互前提的关系，是基于对资本存在的实体基础的观点，这个实体基础是本质上作为历史形态的资本所无法完全包含的。反过来说，因为没有明确看到资本可以包含社会存在的实体即土地和劳动的观点，因此将雇佣劳动和土地所有视为形成对资本外在对立的阶级。 因此，马克思通过这种视角，甚至得出了资本的“否定性”方面。“雇佣劳动方面的否定是资本的、因此也是自己的隐藏的否定。因此，雇佣劳动现在必须作为独立于资本对立的实体来考察。这样，过渡是双重的——即从现代土地所有到或通过现代土地所有到一般雇佣劳动的肯定性过渡。负性过渡，即资本对土地所有的否定，换句话说，即资本对独立价值的否定，实质上是资本对自身的否定。但资本的否定是雇佣劳动。接下来是土地所有的否定，以及通过土地所有的资本对雇佣劳动方面的否定。换句话说，是渴望将自己设定为独立主体的雇佣劳动”，马克思是这样说的。 这一指出极其概念化，其现实内容并不明确。然而，通过将雇佣劳动视为“肯定性过渡”的“能动中介项”，如果资本在内部没有包含雇佣劳动而是与之外在对立，那么认为雇佣劳动方面随后会“否定”资本的关系发展就是自然的。然而，即使说到“资本对土地所有的否定”，正如马克思自己所指出的，即使是将土地“移交给国家”，这也不意味着资本或雇佣劳动会被否定。相反，土地国有化对资本来说不是自我否定，反而是合理的。再者，即使从雇佣劳动方面对资本的否定来说，只要存在雇佣劳动，资本就不能被否定，雇佣劳动也不能将自己设定为独立主体。雇佣劳动对资本的否定同时必须是对雇佣劳动本身的否定，这必须是对资本包含劳动关系本身的否定。为了使“劳动”本身“自立化”，必须否定将“劳动”雇佣化的资本的存在本身。马克思未能充分把握资本对土地和劳动的包含关系，错误地以为土地所有或雇佣劳动本身可以直接“否定”资本。"},{"instruction":"请将“したがって『経済学批判要綱』におけるマルクスの三大階級関係の理解を要約するならば、第一に、資本に対して、土地所有、賃労働が外的に対立し、階級を形成する根拠は、土地所有、賃労働が、あらゆる社会存立の実体的根拠を担うものであり、資本の存立根拠も、この実体としての土地と労働をおいてほかにないとする視点であり、第二に、こうした実体的根拠は、資本によって包摂されうべきものではなく、本来的に資本にとっては外的前提でしかありえないものだ、という把握である。したがって第三に、土地及び労働の資本による包摂形態にほかならない土地所有と賃労働という形態的存在を、直ちに資本によって完全には包摂されるはずのないものとし、資本に対して外的に対立し、「自立」するものとしてとらえることになったのである。資本主義における階級関係形成の根拠は示されてはいたが、資本によるその包摂関係が明確にされていなかった、といえよう。 こうして、資本がその存立の絶対的根拠としての土地と労働とを内的に包摂しうるものとはいえないとするならば、資本主義の社会としての存在、すなわち階級関係の「総括」については、資本によっては十分なされえないことになるのであり、ここに「国家」が「総括」者として登場しなければならないことになる。土地所有、賃労働を資本の下に「総括」するために、つまり資本の階級関係の支配、経済過程の支配を実現するために、「国家」が登場しなければならないのである。「国家の形態でのブルジョア社会の総括」という視点は、およそ以上のような理解に基づくものであったと思われる。 こうした「国家」による階級関係の「総括」という視点は、じつはそのより深い根拠を唯物史観にもっていた、といえよう。いうまでもなく唯物史観は、資本を主語としてとらえるのでなく、人間を主体とし、主語としてとらえる歴史観であり、人間社会存立の根拠を労働・生産過程におき、そこで発現される生産力が、特殊歴史的な生産関係といかに関連し、いかに対立するかを、社会発展の基本要因として確定しようとするものである。この唯物史観を適用して資本主義を考察するとすれば、何よりその基礎・前提に、社会存立の根拠たる実体、上述した土地と労働とが前提としておかれ、これを処理する特殊歴史的、過渡的形態として資本が設定されるが、資本はまさに特殊歴史的、過渡的性格をもつものであることによって、この実体的根拠を完全に内的に処理するものではありえず、本来的主体たるべきものではないということになる。それ故にこそ、直接に資本の外に立ち、資本の支配を実現する「国家」による「総括」がなければ、資本家的社会は成立しようがない、ということになるのである。 このような唯物史観の適用による資本主義の歴史性論証という視点は、さらに追求すると、形態論―流通形態論の未確立に密接に関連しているということができる。 すでに示したように『経済学批判要綱』は「近代ブルジョア社会」解明の出発点に、「多かれ少なかれすべての社会諸形態に通じる」「一般的・抽象的諸規定」をおいていた。ところで、これは内容的には「労働、分業、欲望、交換価値」、あるいは「価値、貨幣、価格」であるとされている。しかし、「労働、分業、欲望」と、「交換価値」「価値、貨幣、価格」とは明らかにその性格を異にするものといわねばならない。前者は、「多かれ少かれ」どころか明らかに「すべての社会形態に通じる」、しかも社会存立の根拠に関わる規定にほかならず、後者は商品経済という歴史的関係においてのみ存在する諸規定にほかならない。このような性格の異なる規定をともに「一般的・抽象的諸規定」に含めているということは、少くと資本主義社会自体にとっての「単純な規定」を、つまり歴史的な形態規定を、明確にとらえていないことを意味するといってよい。『経済学批判要綱』から『資本論』にかけて、マルクスがこの出発点の規定を、「労働、分業、欲望」ではなく、「価値」に、そしてさらに「商品」へと純化していったことを想起すべきである。”翻译为中文","output":"因此，如果总结《经济学批判要纲》中马克思对三大阶级关系的理解，首先，土地所有、雇佣劳动对资本的外部对立和形成阶级的根据，在于土地所有、雇佣劳动承担着所有社会存在的实质基础，资本的存在根据也无他，正是这个实质上的土地和劳动的观点；其次，这种实质基础并不应被资本所包含，本质上对资本来说不过是外在前提而已。因此，第三，将土地所有和雇佣劳动这种资本包含形式的形态存在视为不能直接被资本完全包含的东西，将其视作对资本外在对立并“自立”的东西。虽然表明了资本主义中形成阶级关系的基础，但未明确资本的包含关系。 由此，如果说作为土地和劳动的绝对存在基础的资本无法从内部包含它们，那么资本主义社会的存在，即阶级关系的“总结”，就不能完全由资本实现，这里“国家”必须作为“总结者”出现。为了在资本之下“总结”土地所有、雇佣劳动，即为了实现资本的阶级关系统治、经济过程的统治，“国家”必须出现。“国家形态下的资产阶级社会总结”的视角，似乎基于以上的理解。 这种关于“国家”进行阶级关系“总结”的视角，实际上是基于唯物史观的更深层根据。毫无疑问，唯物史观是一种把人类作为主体和主题的历史观，它将人类社会存在的基础放在劳动、生产过程中，试图确定在其中体现的生产力与特定历史的生产关系如何相关，如何对立，作为社会发展的基本因素。如果我们将唯物史观应用于资本主义的考察，那么首先作为社会存在基础的实体，即上述的土地和劳动被预设，作为特定历史、过渡形态的资本被设定，但由于资本具有特定历史、过渡性质，它无法完全从内部处理这种实质基础，本质上不是应有的主体。因此，直接立于资本外、实现资本统治的“国家”的“总结”必不可少，否则资本主义社会将无法成立。 这种应用唯物史观的资本主义的历史性证明视角，进一步追究，与形态论——流通形态论的未确立紧密相关。 如前所述，《经济学批判要纲》将“近代资产阶级社会”解析的起点放在了“多多少少通用于所有社会形态的‘一般性和抽象性规定’”上。而这些内容上被认为是“劳动、分工、欲望、交换价值”或者是“价值、货币、价格”。但是，“劳动、分工、欲望”与“交换价值”、“价值、货币、价格”显然性质不同，需要区分。前者无疑是“几乎所有社会形态”甚至社会存在的基础，而后者仅在商品经济的历史关系中存在。将这些不同性质的规定都包括在“一般性和抽象性规定”中，意味着没有清晰地把握资本主义社会本身作为“简单规定”，即历史形态规定。从《经济学批判要纲》到《资本论》，马克思将这些出发点的规定从“劳动、分工、欲望”变为“价值”，进而进一步精化为“商品”，这是值得注意的。"},{"instruction":"请将“だが、体系の出発点を「生産一般」「労働一般」とするこの視点は、資本主義の論理的解明を、資本という歴史的形態を主語としてとらえるものではなく、まさに超歴史的人間を主語としてとらえる唯物史観の方法によるものであるといえよう。しかも、同時にこの方法によると、資本主義における「生産一般」「労働一般」の商品経済的包摂関係は明らかにしえないものとなる。「商品」形態を、資本主義における階級関係、経済過程の一般的、基本的包摂形態とし、したがって「近代ブルジョア社会」解明の出発点とする方法が、確立しえないのである。 だが、こうした唯物史観の直接的適用は、「生産一般」「労働一般」が、なぜに社会存立の実体的根拠であるかを、論証ぬきで、前提してしまうことになり、さらに上述したように「近代ブルジョア「社会」の階級関係を相互前提的な、外的対立関係ととらえることによって、階級関係成立を事実的前提とすることになり、その形成根拠を内的に論証しえなくなるとともに、資本による経済的自立性を十分把握しえないことになってしまう。こうして結局社会としての「近代ブルジョア社会」の成立を、「国家形態」による階級関係の「総括」にゆだねざるをえないことになるのである。 国家を、直接に支配階級による被支配階級に対する権力体としてとらえ、それを通して階級支配を実現するものととらえる方法は、明らかに唯物史観によるものであって、それは少なくとも論証によって、論理によって裏打ちされ、確証されえない前提、仮説によらねばならないものでしかなかったのである。 三『資本論』と階級論 （一）マルクスは、一八五八年四月二日付エンゲルス宛手紙の中で 第一冊「資本について」の内容を、「資本一般……競争、または多数資本の相互の行動、信用･･････、(株式資本、[資本の]もっとも完成された形態(共産主義へ飛躍しつつある)であると同時に、その一切の矛盾を伴ったものとしての」というプランを示していた。五八年三月一一日ラッサル宛手紙ではこの「資本一般」の項目を「価値、貨幣、資本一般(資本の生産過程、資本の流通過程、両者の統一または資本と利潤(利子)」としていた。五九年の『経済学批判』では、このうち「価値」が明らかに価値でなく「商品」に変更された。 六一六三年の二三冊ノート(その大きな部分が『剰余価値学説史』である)執筆の当初におけるマルクスの経済学批判体系プランは、次のような内容であった。「一、資本(序説、商品と貨幣)資本一般、1資本の生産過程2資本の流通過程、3両者の統一、または資本と利潤。⑥諸資本の競争。(信用。(株式資本。二、土地所有。三、賃労働。四、国家。五、外国貿易。六、世界市場」である。すくなくとも『経済学批判要綱』体系の出発点であった「生産一般」の代りに、「商品と貨幣」が位置づけられたことが決定的変更であったが、なお当初の構想はいぜん保持されていたといってよい。 ところが、スミス、リカードなどの古典経済学に対する科学的批判を、二三冊ノート執筆を通して遂行する過程で、マルクスは明らかに「一、資本回資本一般」の中に、「資本一般」を明らかにする限りという限定づきながらも、「競争」や「信用」を説かなければならないと考えはじめたばかりでなく、さらには「一、資本」から独立して説かれるものと考えていた「土地所有」についても、すくなくともその資本家的形態の根拠となる「地代」をこれに含め、また「賃労働」も「資本一般」の最後の「むすび」をなすものとしての「資本と賃労働」に位置づけられるようになった(六三年一月の第三巻プラン)。二三冊ノート執筆過程でマルクスは『経済学批判要綱』における「六冊の著作を書くという考えをきっぱりと棄てて、第一冊の第一篇、すなわち三つの部分(「資本の生産過程」、「資本の流通過程」、「両者の統一、または資本と利潤」)に分かれる「資本一一般」という篇に限定しようという決意をほぼ固めていた」(ブイゴツキー、富岡裕訳『資本論の生誕』新読書社、一九六七年、一八二頁)ということができよう。 ”翻译为中文","output":"因此，如果将马克思在《经济学批判要纲》中对于三大阶级关系理解的要点概括起来，首先，对土地所有、雇佣劳动与资本的外在对立以及形成阶级的依据，是基于认为土地所有、雇佣劳动承担了所有社会存在的实质基础，并且资本的存在基础也无异于这种作为实质的土地和劳动的观点；其次，这种实质基础并不是应由资本包含的，而本质上对资本来说仅是外在的前提。因此，第三，将土地所有和雇佣劳动这种资本的包含形式视作不能直接被资本完全包含的东西，并作为对资本外在对立和“自立”的东西。虽然展示了资本主义中阶级关系形成的基础，但却未清晰地定义了资本的包含关系。 如此，如果将“生产一般”、“労働一般”作为体系的出发点，这一观点是基于唯物史观的方法，该方法并不是以资本这一历史形态作为主体来阐明资本主义的逻辑，而是实际上以超历史的人类作为主体。同时，这种方法也无法明确资本主义中“生产一般”、“劳动一般”的商品经济包含关系。“商品”形态作为资本主义中阶级关系、经济过程的一般性、基本包含形态，并因此作为“现代资产阶级社会”阐明的出发点的方法无法被确立。 然而，这种对唯物史观的直接应用，无需论证即预设“生产一般”、“劳动一般”为何是社会存在的实质基础，进一步地，如上所述地将“现代资产阶级社会”的阶级关系视为相互前提的、外在对立关系，实质上使阶级关系的形成成为事实上的前提，并且无法内在地论证其形成基础，以及无法充分把握资本的经济自立性。这样，最终将“现代资产阶级社会”作为社会的成立转交给“国家形态”下阶级关系的“总结”。 将国家直接视为统治阶级对被统治阶级实践权力的机构，并通过它实现阶级统治的方法显然是基于唯物史观，并且至少必须基于证明和逻辑来支撑，而不是仅仅基于不可证实的前提或假设。 关于《资本论》与阶级论 （一）马克思在1858年4月2日致恩格斯的信中 提到了《资本论》第一卷的内容计划为“资本一般……竞争，或众多资本的相互作用、信用……、（股份资本，资本的最完善形态（正在向共产主义飞跃））但同时也带有所有矛盾”的计划。在58年3月11日致拉萨尔的信中，将这一“资本一般”的项目说明为“价值、货币、资本一般（资本的生产过程、资本的流通过程、二者的统一即资本和利润（利息））。在59年的《经济学批判》中，其中“价值”明确变更为“商品”。 在61-63年撰写的23册笔记（其中大部分为《剩余价值学说史》）的起初，马克思的经济学批判体系计划内容为：“一、资本（导论、商品和货币）资本一般、1资本的生产过程2资本的流通过程、3二者的统一，即资本和利润。六竞争。（信用。（股份资本。二、土地所有。三、雇佣劳动。四、国家。五、外国贸易。六、世界市场”。至少可以说，《经济学批判要纲》体系的出发点“生产一般”被“商品和货币”所取代，是决定性的变化，但最初的构想仍然保持不变。 然而，在通过23册笔记的撰写过程中对史密斯、李嘉图等古典经济学进行科学批评时，马克思显然开始认为，不仅要在“一、资本回资本一般”中阐明“资本一般”，即使受到了限制也必须讨论“竞争”和“信用”，并且他曾认为要独立阐述的“土地所有”部分，至少也要包含成为资本家形态基础的“地租”，同时“雇佣劳动”也被定位于“资本一般”的最终部分，即“资本与雇佣劳动”的部分（63年1月的第三卷计划）。在23册笔记的撰写过程中，马克思“显然决心放弃了写作六卷著作的想法，几乎决定将其限定为第一卷的第一部分，即被分为三个部分的‘资本一般’（‘资本的生产过程’、‘资本的流通过程’、‘二者的统一，即资本和利润’）（布伊戈次基，由富岡裕翻译的《资本论的诞生》，新读书社，1967年，第182页）”。"},{"instruction":"请将“こうして一八六四十六五年に執筆された現行『資本論』第三巻は、利潤論展開の中に資本間の競争を含めて説き(とくに第三巻第十章)、さらに利子論の中にきわめて未成熟ながら信用の問題を展開し、地代論、とくに絶対地代の説明において土地所有の積極的作用をとり上げ、終章を「諸階級」で総括するという構成を示したのであった。「資本、賃労働、土地所有。国家、外国貿易、世界市場」という六部編成プランは、第一項目の「資本」の内容の変更に伴って、全体的に変更され、「国家」によるブルジョア社会の「総括」から、明らかに「諸階級」による「総括」へと変った。 (二) ところで、『資本論』第三巻終章が「諸階級」であるというのはどのような意味をもつものであろうか。この章でマルクスは、賃金労働者、資本家、土地所有者を「近代の、資本主義的生産様式に立脚する三大階級」とし、この三大階級への階級関係の純化、すなわち生産手段からの労働者の分離による賃労働者の形成と、「資本及び労働からの土地所有の独立的分離」「資本主義的生産様式に対応する土地所有形態への一切の土地所有の転化」が「資本主義的生産様式の不断の傾向であり発展法則である」としている。この指摘は、現実の資本主義の歴史的傾向に即した『資本論』の対象設定純粋資本主義の想定を再確認したものといえよう。 続いてマルクスは「何が階級を形成するのか?」と問い、この問いはさらに別の問いによって答えられるとして「何が賃金労働者、資本家、土地所有者を、三大階級の形成者となすのか?」という問題を提示する。だが、この問いに対してマルクスは「一見したところでは、収入及び収入源泉の同一性である」として、三階級が各々労働力と資本と土地所有を「利用」して、労働賃金、利潤、地代を得て生活しているという指摘を行なうだけである。しかも、こうし指摘に対して「しかしながら、この立場からすれば、たとえば医者と役人も二つの階級を形成する」ことになるし、さらに社会的分業によって三階級の各々が「さらに分割される利害関係や地位......の無限の分裂についてもいえるであろう」とする。つまり、同じ収入源泉から収入をえている者を同じ階級とするならば、種々の職種の相違によって階級は「無限の分裂」をきたすことになるというわけである。したがって、マルクス自身、これだけでは先の問いに答えていないことを自ら認める形になっている。ところが、原稿はここで中断されており、マルクス自身いかなる回答をしようとしたかは示されていないのである。エンゲルスは、『資本論』第三巻の序文で「最後の章は初めの方だけしかない。ここでは三大収入形態なる地代、利潤、労働賃金に対応する、発展した資本主義社会の三大階級土地所有者、資本家、賃金労働者――と、それらの存在と共に必然的に与えられている階級闘争とが、資本主義時代の事実上存在する結果として、述べられるはずであった」としている。実際、マルクス自身、一八六八年四月三〇日付エンゲルスへの手紙で「最後にわれわれは、俗流経済学者には出発点として役立つ諸現象形態に到達した。すなわち、土地から生ずる地代、資本から生ずる利潤(利子)、労働から生ずる労働賃金。だがわれわれの立場からは事態は今や異って見える。外観的運動が解明される。さらに、すべての従来の経済学の礎柱となったアダム・スミスのたわごと、すなわち、商品の価格はかの三つの所得から、したがってただ可変資本(労働賃金)と剰余価値(地代・利潤・利子)だけから成っているというたわごとがくつがえされる。この現象形態における総運動。最後に、かの三つのもの(労働賃金・地代・利潤(利子))は、土地所有者、資本家、賃金労働者という三つの階級の所得源泉だから――結びとして、全汚物の運動と分解とがそこに解消するところの階級闘争」、と述べていた。 『資本論』は、「階級闘争」の必然性を明らかにして終結している、とする一般的理解は、恐らくマルクスのこの手紙を基礎としたエンゲルスの指摘によるものであろう。そしてまた『資本論』が「階級闘争」で終結するものとすれば、そこから導き出されるのは、「階級闘争」を抑圧ないし緩和して、資本主義体制を維持し、「総括」する「国家」ということになるだろう。マルクスの当初のプランはここになお生かされている、ということもできるであろう。”翻译为中文","output":"因此，1864至1865年撰写的现行《资本论》第三卷，在利润论的展开中包含了资本之间的竞争（特别是第三卷第十章），并在利息论中虽然尚未成熟但展开了信用问题，在地租论，特别是绝对地租的阐释中提出了土地所有的积极作用，并以“各个阶级”作为总结的最终章节，展示了这样的结构。“资本、雇佣劳动、土地所有。国家、对外贸易、世界市场”的六部分计划，随着“资本”一项内容的变化，整体上发生了变化，“国家”对资产阶级社会的“总结”，明显地变为了“各个阶级”对其的“总结”。 （二） 那么，《资本论》第三卷最终章是“各个阶级”，这究竟意味着什么呢？在这一章中，马克思将雇佣劳动者、资本家、土地所有者定位为“立足于现代、资本主义生产方式的三大阶级”，这三大阶级的阶级关系的提炼，即指工人与生产手段的分离形成雇佣劳动者，以及“资本及劳动从土地所有中独立分离”、“所有土地所有转变为适应资本主义生产方式的土地所有形态”被认为是“资本主义生产方式不断的倾向和发展规律”。这一指出，可以说是重新确认了《资本论》针对实际资本主义的历史倾向设定的预设纯粹资本主义。 接着，马克思提出“什么构成阶级？”的问题，并通过另一个问题来回答“什么使雇佣劳动者、资本家、土地所有者成为形成三大阶级的者？”。但是，对于这个问题，马克思仅指出“乍看之下，是收入及其来源的相同性”，即三个阶级分别利用劳动力、资本和土地所有，从而获得劳动工资、利润、地租以维生。然而，对于这一点的指出，“然而，从这个立场来看，例如医生和公务员也会形成两个阶级”，并且“还可以说，由于社会分工，三个阶级各自会进一步分化为无限的利益关系或地位......的分裂”。也就是说，如果将获得相同收入来源的人划为同一个阶级，则因各种职业的差异，阶级将“无限分裂”。因此，马克思自己承认这还没有回答之前的问题。然而，原稿在这里中断，马克思自己打算给出何种回答并未显示。恩格斯在《资本论》第三卷的序言中提到，“最后一章只有开头一部分。这里本应阐述在发展的资本主义社会中与三大收入形式即地租、利润、劳动工资相对应的三大阶级——土地所有者、资本家、雇佣劳动者——以及与它们的存在不可避免地伴随的阶级斗争，作为资本主义时代实际存在的结果。”实际上，马克思自己在1868年4月30日致恩格斯的信中提到，“最后，我们抵达了对俗流经济学者而言的出发点，各种现象形态，即产自土地的地租、资本的利润（利息）、劳动的劳动工资。但从我们的立场看，情况现在看起来不同。外在运动得到了解释。进一步，推翻了所有传统经济学的基石，即亚当·斯密的荒谬观点，即商品价格仅由这三种收入构成，因此仅由可变资本（劳动工资）和剩余价值（地租、利润、利息）构成。在这些现象形态中的总运动。最后，这三者（劳动工资、地租、利润（利息））因为是土地所有者、资本家、雇佣労动者的收入来源——归结为，所有污秽的运动和分解都在那里得到解决的阶级斗争”，这是他所说的。 《资本论》以明确“阶级斗争”的必然性而结束的一般理解，可能是基于恩格斯的这一指出，以及马克思的这封信。如果说《资本论》以“阶级斗争”结束，那么从中得出的结论是，“国家”作为一种抑制或缓和“阶级斗争”来维持资本主义制度并进行“总结”的存在。马克思最初的计划在此仍然得以保留，这也是可以说的。"},{"instruction":"请将“しかし、エンゲルスが、三階級の存在と「階級闘争とが、資本主義時代の事実上存在する結果として、述べられるはず」というのに対して、マルクスの場合には、何よりもスミスの一面に根深くあった俗流経済学的三位一体の表象を、「外観的運動」あるいは「現象形態における総運動」としてまずおさえ、その上でそれが「外観」であり、「現象形態」にすぎぬことを「階級闘争」によって暴露せしめる、という理解であった。つまり、マルクスは、たんに「階級闘争」を「事実上存在する結果」として述べるにとどまらず、『資本論』全三巻の論理を通して、直接には「生産担当者自身の普通の意識に現われるときの形態」(第三巻第一篇第一章前文)をも展開する第三巻の論理を通して、俗流経済学的表象の生ずる「現象形態にお「ける総運動」を論理的に導きながら、同時に「階級闘争」によって、真の本質をも示すという考えだった、といえよう。 ということになると、先の「諸階級」の章におけるマルクスの問いの意味は、恐らく次のようなものであったと考えられる。すなわち、資本主義はまさに「外観的」「形態的」には、俗流経済学が依って立つような、資本利潤(利子)、土地地代、労働─労働賃金という三位一体的関係が客観的現象として形成される。つまり、生産過程には必ず生産手段(資本)、土地、労働の三要素がなければならないように、資本主義においてもこの三要素の提供者たる三階級が各々の生産要素を提供し合い、相協力して、始めて生産が行なわれ、価値が形成され、所得が生み出される。これはたんに誤った表象というより、資本主義自体の現象的事実として形成され、したがってその論理的展開によっても展開されるのである。だがしか同時に、この三階級は、本質的には調和的、協力関係でなく、階級対立の関係にある。「外観」としては、相互に独立、平等、協力関係の現象を呈しながら、なぜ対立が生じ、なぜ「階級闘争」が生じるのか。これに答えるためには何より「何が階級を形成するのか」という問いに答えておかねばならない―――ということである。たしかに、マルクスは『資本論』第一巻、第二巻を通して資本による賃労働の搾取とそれを基礎とした資本の生産過程・再生産過程支配の本質を解明した。しかし、「生産担当者自身の普通の意識に現われるときの形態」を論理的に展開する第三巻では、まさに論理的にはこうした「外観」「現象形態」が導かれる。そうであるとしても、搾取関係や階級対立の本質は解消されるはずはない。一体、「外観」や「現象形態」に対して、この本質はどう貫徹しているのか。マルクスはこれを何よりもエンゲルスがそうとらえたように、現実の事実としての「階級闘争」で示そうとしたのであろう。しかし、自由、独立、平等の「外観」的論理が成立しながら、なぜ「階級闘争」が貫徹するのか。マルクスは、この点をもさらに論理的に確定しようとしたのではなかったか。それが「何が階級を形成するのか」という問いとなってあらわれたのではないか。 同時に、この問いに対してマルクスが十分回答を示していなかったのは、なおマルクスの論理の中に、唯物史観の観点が介入していたからではなかったか、と思われる。「外観」や「現象形態」を歴史的形態とし、これに解消しえぬ本質を実体として提示して、その「外観」を暴露するという方法である。しかし、その方法では、「外観」や「現象形態」の支配と、この本質との内的関連は論理的には説明されず、\\"事実\\"にゆだねざるをえない。エンゲルスは、唯物史観の観点から、これを当然とし、マルクスは、むしろ唯物史観の観点をさらに論理的に証明せねばならぬという考えから、この問いをあらためて提起した、と考えられるのである。 （三）『資本論』の論理は、実はこの問いに対する回答をすでに準備していたのである。それはすなわち形態論の確立ということである。これはさらに、唯物史観の方法を前提し、これを資本主義の解明に適用するという視点から、資本自体の論理による資本主義経済の論理的解明へという方法への転換に対応する。”翻译为中文","output":"然而，恩格斯提到三大阶级的存在和“阶级斗争将作为资本主义时代事实上存在的结果被阐述”，而在马克思的情况下，首先把握的是根深蒂固于史密斯那一面的通俗经济学的三位一体的表象作为“外在运动”或者“现象形态中的总运动”，然后通过“阶级斗争”来揭露这只是“外貌”和“现象形态”。也就是说，马克思不仅仅将“阶级斗争”作为“事实上存在的结果”来陈述，而是通过整个《资本论》三卷的逻辑，特别是通过第三卷在“生产担当者自己的一般意识中呈现的形态”（第三卷第一部第一章前言）的逻辑展开，逻辑地导出通俗经济学的表象产生的“现象形态中的总运动”，同时通过“阶级斗争”展示其真实本质。 这样一来，前面提到的“各个阶级”的章节中马克思的问题的意义，恐怕是这样的：资本主义确实是在“外貌上”、“形态上”形成了通俗经济学依赖的、资本利润（利息）、土地地租、劳动——劳动工资这样的三位一体关系作为客观现象。也就是说，生产过程必然需要生产手段（资本）、土地、劳动这三个元素，资本主义中提供这三种要素的三大阶级通过共同提供这些生产要素并协作，才能进行生产、形成价值并产生收入。这不仅仅是错误的表象，而是作为资本主义自身的现象事实形成的，因而也在其逻辑展开中得到展现。但是同时，这三个阶级本质上并非和谐、合作关系，而是存在阶级对立。在“外貌”上展现为彼此独立、平等、合作关系的现象，为何会产生对立，为何会引发“阶级斗争”？为了回答这个问题，首先必须回答“什么构成了阶级？”——这就是所提出的问题所在。确实，马克思通过《资本论》第一卷、第二卷揭示了资本对雇佣劳动的剥削及其基于此的资本的生产过程和再生产过程的支配本质。但是，在第三卷中对“生产担当者自己的一般意识中呈现的形态”逻辑展开时，恰恰是逻辑上导出这些“外貌”、“现象形态”。尽管如此，剥削关系或阶级对立的本质不会被解决。究竟对于这些“外貌”和“现象形态”，这个本质是如何贯穿的呢？马克思恐怕是试图通过实际的事实即“阶级斗争”来展示这一点。尽管自由、独立、平等的“外貌”逻辑成立了，为什么“阶级斗争”会贯穿其中？马克思恐怕是试图将这个问题进一步逻辑地确立。 同时，马克思未能充分回答这个问题，恐怕是因为唯物史观的观点介入了其中。将“外貌”和“现象形态”作为历史形态，向其呈现不可解消的本质作为实体，并通过揭露这个“外貌”来采取的方法。然而，这种方法逻辑上并未说明“外貌”和“现象形态”的支配与这个本质之间的内在联系，而是不得不交给“事实”。恩格斯视之为理所当然，而马克思则是从唯物史观需要进一步逻辑证明的观点出发，重新提出了这个问题。 （三）事实上，《资本论》的逻辑已经为回答这个问题做好了准备。那就是形态论的确立。这是从假设唯物史观的方法，并将其应用于对资本主义的阐明的视角，向转变为通过资本自身的逻辑对资本主义经济的逻辑阐明的方法的转换。"},{"instruction":"请将“資本主義経済を解明するマルクスの叙述の進展とともに、その論理的出発点は明確に「商品」におかれることになったことはすでに述べた。このことは、『経済学批判要綱』における「生産一般」「労働一般」を出発点とする方法に対する決定的転換である。「商品」はいうまでもなく、商品経済という歴史的関係に存する歴史的形態にほかならない。これを体系の出発点とすることは、歴史的な要因を主語とする論理が展開されることを意味するのであって、人間や社会的実体を主語とする唯物史観の方法とは異なる。「商品」が、体系の出発点であるということは、資本主義における社会関係、経済関係、階級関係が、一般に商品関係として現われ、商品関係によって包摂されていることに根拠をもっている。階級関係は資本主義においては商品関係として現われるのであり、商品関係によって包摂されるのである。 このような「商品」を出発点とする論理によって、資本主義の現実の主体たる資本も「商品」形態の展開を通して形成される特殊な形態的関係としてとらえられる。商品のうちの特殊な商品たる貨幣の、さらに特殊な規定性をもつものとして、資本が展開される(この点は拙著『経済学方法論序説』、一九七四年、弘文堂、第二編第一章を参照)。いうまでもなく、G-WIGなる形式で示される、価値増殖する価値の運動体としての資本の規定である。資本が形態的運動を本質とするものであり、古典経済学のように生産手段という生産要素などとは規定できるものではないというこの理解は、階級関係形成の論理を確定する上に決定的意義をもったのである。 資本主義は資本を現実的主体として運動する社会である。しかし、資本は本質的には流通における形態的関係として成り立つものでしかない。資本が流通形態であることは、いいかえれば、それ自身の内部にその存立根拠をもたないということを意味する。逆にいえば、自己運動としての資本の存立根拠は、形態規定としての資本に対しては本来外的存在としてある、ということである。資本の存立にとっては、本来それに対する外的要因としての存立根拠――労働・生産過程――を、その形態的運動の内部にとり込み、内包しなければならない。つまり、労働・生産過程の要因を、商品経済的関係によって包摂し、資本運動に内包しなければならない。その仕方は、労働力の商品化と土地の商品経済的処理にほかならない。労働と土地を、商品関係を通して資本の運動のうちに包摂すること、そこに資本の根本的、社会的存立条件がある。 だが、労働力の商品化は、『資本論』第一巻第二篇「貨幣の資本への転化」で論理的に明らかにしたように、「一つの世界史を包括する」特殊歴史的条件——土地・生産手段からの労働者の切り離しによる無産者の形成――に依存する。つまり、形態としての資本の内的発展だけでは労働力の商品化は導出しえないことをマルクスは明確に示しているのである。生産主体たる労働者の労働力を商品関係に包摂するには、特殊歴史的条件によらざるをえないというのは、労働力自体は資本にとって外的存在にほかならないことを意味する。ここに、労働力の所有者の資本に対抗した階級形成の根拠がある。もちろん、資本は一たび労働力の商品化を達成すると、これを維持する経済的関係を創り出す。買入れた労働力の使用による必要労働・剰余労働の形成によって、価値・剰余価値を形成し、労働力に対しては労働力の再生産労働者の生活に必要な限度に賃金を限定する。直接的生産過程における労働者の労働自体を商品化させ外観的形態としての労賃形態によって「労働」自体をも商品形態に解消せんとする。蓄積拡大にとって不可欠な労働力の拡大維持に対しては、有機的構成の高度化による相対的過剰人口の形成によって、これを確保する。 ”翻译为中文","output":"随着马克思解释资本主义经济的叙述的发展，他的逻辑起点明确放在了“商品”上，这一点我们已经提到过。这是对在《经济学批判要纲》中以“生产一般”、“劳动一般”为出发点方法的决定性转变。“商品”无疑是商品经济中存在的历史形态。将它设立为体系的起点意味着将展开以历史因素为主题的逻辑，这与以人类或社会实体为主题的唯物史观方法不同。“商品”成为体系起点意味着资本主义中的社会关系、经济关系、阶级关系普遍以商品关系呈现，并由商品关系所包含。在资本主义中，阶级关系以商品关系的形式呈现，并被商品关系所包含。 这种以“商品”为出发点的逻辑通过商品的特殊形态——货币的展开，将资本主义的现实主体资本视为一种特殊的形态关系（详情请参见我1974年所著的《经济学方法论序论》，弘文堂，第二编第一章）。资本的定义明显是G-W-G'的形式，即作为增值的价值运动体。资本以形态运动为本质，并不像古典经济学那样可以被定义为生产手段等生产要素，这一理解对于确定阶级关系形成的逻辑具有决定性的意义。 资本主义是以资本作为现实主体运动的社会。然而，资本本质上仅是流通中的形态关系。即资本作为流通形态意味着它本身不具有自身存在的基础。反过来说，作为自我运动的资本的存在基础是本质上作为对形态规定之资本的外在存在。对于资本的存在而言，必须将本质上针对其的外部要素——劳动和生产过程——内化和包含于它的形态运动之中。也就是通过商品经济关系包含劳动和生产过程的要素，并将其内化于资本运动之中。这种做法是将劳动力的商品化和土地的商品经济处理作为基础。通过商品关系将劳动和土地内化于资本运动中，这里存在着资本的根本性、社会性存在条件。 但是，正如《资本论》第一卷第二篇“货币转化为资本”中逻辑明确指出的，劳动力的商品化依赖于包含整个世界历史的特殊历史条件——通过工人与土地、生产手段的剥离形成无产阶级。换句话说，马克思清晰显示出仅靠资本的内在发展无法导出劳动力的商品化。劳动者作为生产主体的劳动力被商品化，必须依赖特殊历史条件，这意味着劳动力本身对资本来说是外在存在。这就是劳动力拥有者形成对抗资本的阶级形成根据。当然，一旦资本达成劳动力的商品化，就会创造出维持这一状态的经济关系。通过购买的劳动力的使用产生必要劳动和剩余劳动，形成价值和剩余价值，并通过劳动报酬的形式将劳动者的劳动本身也商品化，将劳动者生活所需限定在工资中。而对于扩展积累所必需的劳动力的扩展维护，则通过提高有机构成形成相对过剩人口来确保。"},{"instruction":"请将“だが、いかに資本が労働力を商品経済的関係のうちに包摂し、さらにこの関係の中に溶解せんとしても、労働力が本来商品として生産されるものではなく、労働者の個人的生活維持に依存するものでしかないということ、さらにまたいかに機械化・合理化を進めても、そのこと自体がさらなる機械化・合理化を制約するというだけでなく、所詮生産過程が労働者の労働支出自体に依存せざるをえないという本質は、解消しようがない。「労働」自体を商品形態に解消する「労賃形態」(この篇は、『資本論』第一巻再版においてはじめて独立の篇として形成された。このことの意味の一端については拙著『資本論体系の方法』一九七〇年、日本評論社、第二部第二章第三節参照)は、マルクス自身指摘しているように「一つの想像的表現であって、たとえ土地の価値というようなもの」でしかなく、決して「実際に何らの価値関係も表現しない」ものである。 こうして労働力に商品形態を与え、この関係を社会的に維持・再生産して、資本が社会的に確立しても、労働力自体の再生産、労働過程内での労働自体は、商品関係とは異質の実体的性格をもつものであることに変りはない。こうして資本はその根本的成立条件に決定的矛盾を内包することになる。この矛盾は、資本が社会存立の実体を内包するところから生ずるのであって、資本と「労働」との外的対立ではなく、資本自体の自己矛盾というべきものなのである。こうして、流通形態規定より展開した論理は、資本という本質的に自己存立根拠を欠くものが現実の主体となるからこそ、本来的に社会的実体を担う労働者を、内包しなければならず、しかもこれを内包しなければならないところから、必然的に労働者を資本に対する階級として措定せねばならず、資本の自己運動の矛盾を生じさせることになることが、明らかとなる。 さらに、資本の社会的存立にとっては、社会的実体としての生産過程のもう一つの決定的要素たる土地を、商品経済的関係によって内包しなければならない。しかも、土地からの労働者の切り離しによる無産労働者の維持は、労働力商品化の条件である。したがって、労働者に生産手段としての土地を所有させない社会的関係が形成されなければならない。それはすべての土地を私有関係の下に包摂することによって行なわれる。しかし、土地所有自体は、資本によって作り出されるものではない。それは資本主義にとっての歴史的、外的前提である。土地の私有は、封建的関係の解体とともに形成されてきた土地の商品化を通して、一定の合理的根拠を与えられてきたのであった。資本はマルクスが地代論で明らかにしているように、生産手段としての土地の利用から必然的に生ずる超過利潤の地代への転化によって、土地私有に資本家経済的根拠を与え、土地所有の資本家的形態を与える。それによって資本主義は土地私有の根拠となる土地商品化に客観的基準を付与することになる。 だが、マルクスが一貫して前提したように、いかに土地商品化の資本家経済的根拠を与えても土地所有自体は資本の外部に存在するのであった。その点マルクスは十分な論理的説明を与えているとはいえない。それは、後述するように、利子論の未成熟、未確立によるものであったと考えられる。しかし、土地所有の資本家的形態を与え、土地商品化の経済的根拠を形成することによって、資本は土地に対する内包形態をつくり出しながら、なお土地所有を外部に存させざるをえないというところに、土地所有者の階級としての措定が行なわれていた、といいうるのである。 商品経済関係をその存立の基本的根拠とする資本は、それが流通形態であり、それ自体としては自己存立の根拠を欠くものでしかないが故に、本来の社会存立の実体たる人間(労働力)土地(自然力)とを、その社会的存立根拠としなければならず、これをその運動に内包し、商品経済的関係に包摂しなければならないが、しかしそこから労働者階級と土地所有者階級を階級として形成させねばならないのであった。『資本論』全三巻の論理は、いわば人間(労働力)と土地(自然力)の、資本による包摂の形態と、それを包摂するところから必然的に形成される特有の矛盾、それに基づく運動法則を示すものであり、資本主義における階級関係形成の論理的根拠とともに、階級関係の商品関係への外見的解消という特殊な非階級的現象形態を、論理的に展開するものとなっていたのである。

因此，赋予劳动力商品形式并在社会上维持和再生产这种关系，使资本在社会上确立，尽管劳动力自身的再生产、劳动过程中的劳动本身具有与商品关系异质的实体性质。这样，资本内在地包含了其基本形成条件的决定性矛盾。这一矛盾源于资本包含社会存在的实体，而不是资本与“劳动”的外部对立，而应视为资本自身的自我矛盾。由此，从流通形态规定展开的逻辑明确，资本由于本质上缺乏自我存立的基础而成为现实主体，因此必须包含本质上作为社会实体的工人，且由于这种包含，必然将工人作为对资本的阶级进行设定，从而产生资本自我运动的矛盾。 进一步而言，对于资本的社会存立来说，生产过程的另一个决定性要素——土地也必须被商品经济关系所包含。而维持无产劳动者的存在，即劳动力的商品化条件，要求不让工人拥有生产手段即土地的社会关系被形成。这是通过将所有土地包含在私有关系之下来实现的。然而，土地所有本身并非由资本创造。它是资本主义的历史性、外部前提。随着封建关系的解体，土地私有化通过土地商品化获得了一定的合理基础。正如马克思在地租论中明确的，资本通过超额利润转化为地租的过程，为土地私有提供了资本家经济基础，并赋予了土地所有资本家形态。这样，资本主义为土地私有化的根本赋予了客观标准。 但是，正如马克思一贯前提的，尽管提供了土地商品化的资本家经济基础，土地所有本身还是存在于资本的外部。马克思并未提供充分的逻辑解释，这可能是由于如后所述的利息理论的不成熟、未确立所致。然而，通过赋予土地所有资本家的形态，并形成土地商品化的经济基础，资本在创造包含土地的内含形态的同时，仍然需要将土地所有保持在外部，这就是将土地所有者设定为一个阶级的基础。 将商品经济关系作为其存在的基本基础的资本，因为它是流通形态并且本身缺乏自我存立的基础，所以必须以社会存在的实体即人（劳动力）和土地（自然力）作为其社会存立的根据，并将它们包含于自身的运动之中，通过商品经济关系进行包含，但因此必须形成工人阶级和土地所有者阶级。《资本论》全三卷的逻辑，可谓展示了人（劳动力）和土地（自然力）被资本包含的形态以及由此包含引发的特有矛盾和运动规律，并在资本主义中形成的阶级关系的逻辑基础上，逻辑地展开了阶级关系向商品关系的表面消解这一特殊的非阶级现象形态。"},{"instruction":"请将“しかし、マルクスに残された唯物史観適用という方法、いわば社会主義イデオロギーの主張が、客観的な資本の論理の展開を制約していた。そしてこれは、恐慌論の展開と、利子論の展開を通した「それ自身に利子を生むものとしての資本」の論理の未確立に、集中的に示されることになった。恐慌は、いうまでもなく労働力商品化の矛盾に基づく資本の内的自己矛盾によってひき起こされるが、しかし恐慌による資本過剰の暴力的処理は、労働力商品化の矛盾をも現実的に解消することによって、再び好況を展開することになる。つまり、労働力商品化の矛盾を、恐慌によって処理しうる限り、資本関係は一時的に自己否定されながらも、また再生産されるのであって、その限り資本と賃労働との外的対立によって資本主義が崩壊するということにはならない、ということである。だが、資本主義の歴史性を社会主義イデオロギーによって主張せんとするマルクスは、恐慌による資本関係の再生産の論理の中に、それを崩壊させる主張を介入させたことによって、かえって前者を十分展開しえなくなった。 利子生み資本の論理についても、マルクスは、利潤の利子化によ株式資本の形成を明らかにしながらも、それを「資本主義体制自体の基礎の上における資本主義的私的産業の止揚」としてとらえた。これは、『経済学批判要綱』における株式資本のとらえ方、すなわちそれを資本の｢もっとも完成された形態」「最後の形態」とすると同時に「共産主義へ飛躍しつつある」形態であるとする理解と同一である。しかし、この資本の「最後の形態」は、土地価格とともに実は擬制資本なのであり、しかも資本や土地が、こうした擬制資本化することが、これをたんなる商品形態へと回帰させることになるのであって、論理的には「共産主義へ」の「飛躍」や資本主義の「止揚」になるわけではなく、むしろ資本の単純な、基礎的な形態的基礎への還帰による論理的完結性を示すものであることを、マルクスは明らかにしえなかった。社会主義イデオロギーが、こうした論理をさまたげたといえよう。 そのことは、資本の商品形態による階級関係包摂の中で、階級関係の対立・矛盾を論理的に示すのではなく、資本の階級関係包摂に対して外的に階級対立関係を設定し、包摂自体を否定するという主張と対応していたといえよう。資本の形態的包摂の中でその内的矛盾を示すのでなく、これに外的に、つまり形態的に包括されないものとして実体を対置し、形態の限界を暴露するという方法であった。それは、唯物史観による直接にはイデオロギーに基づく資本主義の批判であり、否定であるにすぎないのである。 四市民社会的イデオロギーと国家 （一）『経済学批判要綱』から『資本論』にいたるマルクスの方法的進展を通して、われわれはブルジョア国家解明に対する論理的基盤が十分準備されてきたことを知った。『資本論』あるいは経済学原理論は、その論理全体が、国家論――直接にはブルジョア国家論の基礎をなすものと考えられるのである。つまり、資本は、その社会的存立の根拠たる「労働」と「土地」とを商品形態を通して内的に包摂するとともに、階級を形成し、階級関係を商品関係によって包摂・統合しながら、その内部に対立・矛盾を内包する。いうなれば、市民社会的現象と階級対立・矛盾の内包とをもつ資本主義の自立性の特殊な態様を示す論理によってこそ、ブルジョア国家成立の客観的根拠とともに、その特徴を論理的に示しうるものとなるのである。そこでその内容を、主要な論点を提示しつつ示そう。 ”翻译为中文","output":"然而，被遗留下来的马克思运用唯物史观的方法，可以说是社会主义意识形态主张所束缚的，这限制了客观的资本逻辑的展开。这一点在恐慌论的展开和“能自生利息的资本”逻辑的未确立中尤为集中体现。恐慌无疑是由资本的内在自我矛盾引发的，基于劳动力商品化的矛盾，但通过恐慌对资本过剩的暴力处理实际上也解决了劳动力商品化的矛盾，从而再次展开繁荣。也就是说，通过恐慌处理劳动力商品化的矛盾，资本关系在暂时自我否定的同时又得到再生产，资本和雇佣劳动的外部对立并不导致资本主义的崩溃。但马克思试图通过社会主义意识形态主张资本主义的历史性，因此将其崩溃的论断介入到资本关系再生产的逻辑中，反而使得前者未能充分展开。 关于利息生产资本的逻辑，马克思在明确了通过利润利息化形成股份资本的同时，将其视为“基于资本主义体制基础上的资本主义私有产业的克服”。这与《经济学批判要纲》中对股份资本的理解相一致，即将其视为资本的“最完善形态”、“最终形态”，同时是“向共产主义跃进”的形态。然而，这种资本的“最终形态”实际上是虚拟资本，并且资本和土地的虚拟资本化将其仅仅回归为商品形态，并不逻辑上导致向“共产主义”的“跃进”或资本主义的“克服”，而是反而展现了返回资本最基本、最基础形态的逻辑完结性，马克思未能明确这一点。社会主义意识形态阻碍了这种逻辑的展开。 这与在资本的商品形态包含关系中，而不是逻辑地展示阶级关系的对立和矛盾，而是在资本的阶级关系包含外部设定阶级对立关系，并否定包含本身的说法相对应。而不是在形态包含中表现其内部矛盾，而是将实体作为与形态不被包含的东西对立起来，揭露形态的限制是这种方法。这是建立在直接的意识形态基础上对资本主义的唯物史观批判和否定。 四、市民社会意识形态与国家 （一）通过从《经济学批判要纲》到《资本论》的马克思方法进展，我们已经了解到，为布尔乔亚国家解明准备的逻辑基础已经充分准备好了。《资本论》或经济学原理全篇，可以认为是构成直接的布尔乔亚国家论基础。资本通过内部包含作为其社会存立基础的“劳动”和“土地”于商品形态中，并形成阶级，通过商品关系包含和整合阶级关系，同时包含对立和矛盾。可以说，通过展示资本主义自立性特有的市民社会现象和内含的阶级对立、矛盾的逻辑，才能逻辑地展示布尔乔亚国家成立的客观基础及其特征。在此基础上，展示其主要论点。"},{"instruction":"请将“第一に、「何が階級を形成するのか」という点である。それは、『資本論』が示したように、資本の社会的成立自体が、階級を形成させる根拠だということである。それ自身に存立の根拠をもたぬ流通形態としての資本が、社会的に存立する条件は、本来の社会的存立根拠、労働と土地とを、自己の運動に内包する以外にない。だが、労働も土地も、資本によって内的につくり出しうるものでなく、しかも、資本の包摂形態たる商品形態に解消されるものではない。資本にとっては、これを外的に前提せざるをえない。形態としての資本は、社会的実体としての労働と土地を形態的関係のうちに内包することによって、より明確には労働者による土地・生産手段に対する労働・生産過程を商品による商品の生産として実現することによって、はじめて成立するが、この社会的実体を担う労働者の労働力は、資本自身で商品として生産しえない。また土地所有自体も資本によってつくり出されるものではない。こうして、資本の社会的存立は、形態としての自己に同化し、溶解しえない、しかも自己の根本的成立条件として、労働力の所有者、土地の所有者を、社会的存在として、相対させなければならない。非自立的な、社会的実体にとって本来外的な資本の社会的存立、現実的社会的主体としての存立は、必然的に社会的実体を担う者を、これに対立する階級として、形成させるものとなるのである。 第二に、資本主義は、形態としては明らかに、こうした階級関係商品形態によって包摂し、階級関係を非階級的な商品関係に一元化する。階級関係の「総括」は、「国家」によるのではなく、商品形態によるのである。 しかし、階級関係の商品形態による統合、「総括」の論理については、いくつかの重要な問題が存在する。まず、第一点としては、それはたんに資本主義の流通表面の現象だけから形成されるのではないという点である。労働力も流通部面では労働力商品の所有者であり、また貨幣所有者でもあるし、資本もそうである。だからそこでは、「自由、平等、財産、およびベンサム」が支配する――しかし、それなら、生産過程ではどうか。そこでは資本による専制的な労働者に対する支配と搾取が行なわれる、ということになろう。階級関係を、非階級的に包摂するといっても、それがたんに流通部面の現象にすぎないとしたら、包摂も完成しない。しかも、資本が、生産過程を包摂したら、直ちに階級対立を露呈させるというのでは、資本の運動は自立しないことになる。「労働日の延長」に示される資本の労働者に対する労働強制を、資本が「労働」を包摂しえない限界ととらえ、そこに階級闘争と、国家成立の根拠を見出そうという考えがあるが(例えば、岩田弘氏)、それでは労働・生産過程を包摂して、自立的運動を行なうという資本の自立性自体を否定することになってしまう。その点に対する降旗節雄氏の批判(「宇野理論と政治学」『国家論研究』第三号所収)はたしかに妥当するものといえよう。資本はたんに、流通部面においてのみ、商品形態をとるばかりか、労働・生産過程における「労働」そのものをさえ商品形態化し、「労働」による生産物の生産を、「商品による商品の生産」という、商品関係として現象させるのである。 すなわち、労働・生産過程における労働者の労働に対して、資本はその生産力の増大、直接には機械の導入を通して、支配・包摂を実質化しようとする。協業・分業・機械制大工業の展開による相対的剩余価値生産拡大の進展は、直接的生産過程における労働者の労働を、資本の所有する機械に付属させ、機械体系の一環に組み込み、労働者の労働主体性を喪失させる過程でもある。資本の合理化は、生産過程における労働自体をたんなる生産要素の一つとして自由に操作しようとするところに本質がある。しかし、いかにこのような合理化が進展しようと、生産過程における労働者自身の労働支出をなくすことはできない。機械装置だけによる完全自動システムは、資本にとっては〝理念\\"であるかも知れないが、それは実現できるものではない。それは生産過程が、自然過程に還元されたということになるのであって、それとともに価値増殖根拠は失われる。労働主体たる労働者が、人間であることを、資本はいかなる合理化を通しても、止めさせるわけにいかない。「労働」自体を商品形態に解消してしまうことは不可能なのである。しかし、これは、「労働」を資本が包摂できないということではない。包摂しながら、むしろ包摂するからこそ生ずる矛盾といわねばならない。”翻译为中文","output":"首先，在“构成阶级的是什么”这一点上，《资本论》所展示的，正如资本的社会成立本身就是形成阶级的根据。资本作为流通形态，自身没有存立根据，社会存立的条件在于，除了将原本的社会存立根据——劳动和土地包含在自己的运动之中外，别无选择。但劳动和土地不是资本内部可以创造出来的，而且不是可以被资本的包含形态——商品形态所消解的。对资本而言，它不得不将这些作为外部前提。资本作为形态，通过将社会实体即劳动和土地包含在形态关系之中——更明确地说，是通过劳动者对土地和生产手段的劳动和生产过程作为商品生产商品而实现，资本才得以形成，但承担这一社会实体的劳动力，不是资本自身能够作为商品生产的。同样，土地所有本身也不是资本可以创造的。因此，资本的社会存立，作为形态的自身无法同化、无法消解的，然而作为自身根本成立条件的劳动力所有者、土地所有者，必须作为社会存在而相对立。资本的社会存立，作为非自立的、对社会实体本质上是外部的实体的社会存立，作为现实的社会主体的存立，必然地将承担社会实体的人形成为与之对立的阶级。 其次，资本主义显然以形态上通过商品形态的包含，将阶级关系统一为非阶级的商品关系。阶级关系的“总结”不是由“国家”完成，而是通过商品形态完成的。 但是，在商品形态对阶级关系统一、“总结”的逻辑中，存在一些重要的问题。首先，这并非只是基于资本主义流通表面的现象而形成的。在流通领域中，劳动力同样是劳动力商品的所有者，同时也是货币所有者，资本也是如此。因此那里统治的是“自由、平等、财产和边沁”——但是，在生产过程中怎么办？那里会发生资本对劳动者的专制支配和剥削。即使声称将阶级关系非阶级化地包含，如果这仅仅是流通领域的现象，那么包含也是不完整的。再者，如果资本包含了生产过程，那么它会立即暴露阶级对立，这就意味着资本的运动是不自立的。有人（例如岩田弘氏）试图从资本对劳动者进行的劳动强迫的“劳动时间延长”来发现阶级斗争和国家成立的根据，如果这样，就是否定了资本包含劳动・生产过程和进行自立运动的资本的自主性。对此，降旗節雄先生的批评（收录于《国家论研究》第三号“宇野理论与政治学”）是正确的。资本不仅在流通领域呈现商品形态，而且甚至将“劳动”本身及其产品的生产商品化，在商品关系下，使得劳动及生产过程中的劳动者劳动表现为商品关系。 即是说，资本试图通过提高生产力，特别是通过引入机械来实现对生产过程中劳动者劳动的支配和包含。通过合作分工和机械化大工业的发展扩大相对剩余价值生产的推进，使得直接生产过程中劳动者的劳动成为资本拥有的机械的附属品，被整合入机械系统，并失去劳动者的劳动主体性。资本的合理化在于，试图将生产过程中的劳动本身自由地操纵为一个生产要素。然而，无论如何推进这种合理化，生产过程中劳动者自身的劳动投入是无法消除的。完全由机械装置进行的全自动系统对资本而言或许是一个“理念”，但这是不可能实现的。那将意味着生产过程被还原为自然过程，与之同时失去了价值增殖的根据。资本无论通过何种合理化，都无法停止劳动者作为人的存在。“劳动”本身不可能完全消解为商品形态。但这并不意味着“劳动”不能被资本包含。应该说，正是因为包含，才产生了矛盾。"},{"instruction":"请将“しかも、資本はこの「労働」自体に対しても直接に商品形態を与えるのである。つまり、「労働」自体を形態規定に解消しえないという形態包摂内部の矛盾に対し、「労働」賃金という隠蔽形態を形成することによって、資本はこの矛盾を解消しようとする。

「想像的表現」であり、「直接には実際に何らの価値関係をも表現しない」この「労賃形態」によって「労働」の商品経済的包摂を行なわねばならないというのは、資本の生産過程における労働が、決してたんなる商品関係形態的関係に溶解しきれるものではないことを示している。もちろん、このような形態によって、生産過程自体が、外形的、現象的には商品交換関係に解消されることになり、まさに、たんに流通過程ばかりか、生産過程さえ形態的関係に包摂・統合されるのである。いいかえれば、資本の生産過程における「労働」の形態的包摂・統合は、労働者の労働力を物に、たんなる物的生産要素の一つにしてしまうことでは果されない。労働力を生産要素の一つとして\\"物\\"に解消してとらえるのは、いわばブルジョア・イデオロギーであるといってよいが、しかし、その統合力には限界があるのである。 この点で重要なのは、マルクスが、「労働賃金」形態において、「時間賃金」よりも「出来高賃金」の方が「資本主義生産様式にもっともふさわしい」形態だとしていることである。出来高賃金においては、賃金は「生産者の作業能力によって規定されるかのように見える」。「出来高賃金が個性に与えるより大きい活動の余地は、一面では労働者の個性を、したがって、自由感、独立心、自制を、他面では彼らの間の相互の競争を、発展させる傾向がある」。したがって、それは、「職工と資本家とを一身に兼ねる見込みのある協同組合職工」への「中間物」だというような理解(ジョン・ワッツ)さえ生ずるのである。 元来は、職人の仕事に対する支払い形態であるこの出来高賃金が、労働力商品の価格の隠蔽形態たる「労賃形態」の「もっともふ「さわしい」形態であるということは、外見的に賃労働者に「自由感」や「独立心」を与え、「自分自身の主人である」(ジョン・ワッツ)という表象さえ与える形態によってしか、「労働」の形態的包摂は可能でない、ということを意味する。直接的生産過程における「労働」の形態的包摂は、労働者を徹底的に物化させ、物=生産要素に解消してしまうことによってではなく、むしろ逆に賃労働者に自己の「労働」による報酬という形態により、いわば擬似主体化させることによって、つまり他の生産要素の提供者と対等の生産主体、所得獲得の一主体たる外観を与えることによって、賃労働者に小生産者的形態を与えることによって、実現されるのである。 ”翻译为中文","output":"资本亦对“劳动”本身直接赋予商品形态。即通过形态包含内部无法消解的矛盾对“劳动”，形成“劳动工资”这一隐蔽形态，资本试图消解这一矛盾。 “劳动工资”形态无非是生产过程中“劳动”本身被当作商品买卖的现象的本质隐蔽形态。从《资本论》第一卷再版开始，“劳动工资”作为独立一章节与剩余价值生产相关章节分离，实际上含有极其重要的意义。 马克思在谈到“劳动工资形态”时指出，“这种现象形态是隐藏实际关系并展示其反面的，正是劳动者和资本家所有的法律观念、资本主义生产方式的所有幌子、所有自由幻象和通俗经济学所有辩护论辩都建立在其基础之上的”（第六篇第17章）。进一步，“‘劳动的价值’这一表达不仅完全消除了价值概念，而且反其道而行之。它是一种想象的表达，如同土地的价值一样。然而，这些想象的表达是由生产关系本身产生的。它们是表达本质关系的现象形态的范畴”。 这种“想象的表达”，“直接并不表达任何价值关系”的“劳动工资形态”，是资本必须对劳动进行商品经济包含的表现，说明了资本在生产过程中的劳动绝不仅仅可以溶解为商品关系形态的关系。当然，通过这种形态，生产过程本身在外形上、现象上被解构为商品交换关系，资本的运动似乎包含并整合了流通过程乃至生产过程。换言之，资本在生产过程中对“劳动”的形态包含与整合，并非仅仅是将劳动力物化为一个单纯的物质生产要素。将劳动力视为生产要素之一并将其“物化”的观点可以说是资产阶级意识形态，但其整合力是有限的。 重要的是，马克思认为，“劳动工资”形态中，以计件工资形式而非计时工资形式更符合资本主义生产方式。“在计件工资下，工资看似由生产者的工作能力决定”。“计件工资给予个体更多的活动空间在一方面发展了劳动者的个性，从而发展了自由感、独立性和自律，另一方面也发展了他们之间的相互竞争”。因此，甚至可以理解为是“有望兼具工人和资本家身份的合作社工人”的“中间物”（约翰·沃茨）。 原本是对手工艺者工作的支付形式的计件工资被视为劳动力商品价格的隐蔽形态即“劳动工资形态”的“更合适”形态，意味着只有通过赋予雇佣工人“自由感”和“独立性”的形式，甚至给予他们“成为自己主人”的表象的形式，才能对“劳动”进行形态包含。生产过程中“劳动”的形态包含并非通过完全物化劳动者、将其解构为物=生产要素来实现，而是相反，通过给予雇佣工人其劳动报酬这种形式，以某种程度上的主体化形式，即通过与其他生产要素提供者平等的生产主体、收入获取者身份的外表，为雇佣工人提供小生产者的形式来实现。"},{"instruction":"请将“なお、資本の蓄積過程を通して形成される相対的過剰人口とその不断の維持は、資本主義にとって外的な関係を必要とするのであり、資本主義的経済関係に包摂しえない限界を示すものであるという点に、国家形成の根拠をとらえようという見解がある(例えば、馬場宏二氏)。しかし、相対的過剰人口は、蓄積過程の進行によって形成されたり、また吸収されたりするのであり、その全体の過程を通して、労働力の再生産に見合う賃金が支払われることになる。相対的過剰人口の維持は、外的関係に依存するのではなく、資本蓄積の過程内部によって処理されうる。もっとも、相対的過剰人口の吸収を伴う蓄積過程の進行は、必然的に賃金を上昇させ、資本のいわゆる絶対的過剰を生じることになるが、これは恐慌という資本蓄積の否定によって、自立的、内的に相対的過剰人口が再形成される、ということになる。しかし、恐慌という資本の運動の中断、価値増殖運動の一時的否定は、じつは労働力商品の社会的確保の、資本主義固有の方法なのであり、恐慌が自動的、必然的にひきおこされる限り、逆に労働力商品再生産の機構がむしろ内的に維持されるのである。 階級関係の商品形態的包摂・総括のもう一つの難問は、賃労働者から切り離されたものとしての土地所有の処理についてである。上述したように、資本は土地を生産手段として使用するところから必然的に形成する超過利潤を地代として土地所有者に与えることを通して、平均利潤法則を貫徹する。地代形成は、土地所有に対して資本家的形態を与え、資本家経済的な根拠を与えるものである。それとともに、未耕地についても土地所有の経済的根拠が形成される。しかし、土地所有の商品形態的包摂は、土地の商品化による以外にない。いわゆる近代的土地所有関係は、土地の商品としての売買によって形成されたのであった。資本による地代の形成は、この土地商品化の、土地価格の基準を与えるものとなる。だが、本来無価値土地を価値物として売買するという関係を形成するには、たんに地代形成だけでは十分ではない。土地を、地代という果実を生み出す資本として観念するという形態が、つくり出されねばならないのである。しかし、こうした観念の形成は、資本と土地所有だけの関係によってでなく、利子論の展開を通した資本所有自体が利子を生むという観念=「それ自身に利子を生むものとしての資本」の観念が形成されなければならないのである。つまり、資金の現実的貸借関係を通して形成される利子率を基準にして、すべての資本所有がその利子率に見合う利子をそれ自体として生み出すとする観念が形成されねばならない、ということである。賃労働者の労働に根拠をもたずにも、資本所有自体で一定の果実を生むというのは、いわば資本の最高の発展形態であり、宇野弘蔵氏のことばによれば「理「念」である。しかし、本来実体に根拠をもたなければ成立しえない資本は、このような利子生み資本を現実に形成することはできない。それは、資本としての資本の純粋な、いわば\\"絶対精神\\"なのである。 しかし、資本主義はこの〝理念\\"\\"絶対精神を現実化する関係も形成する。すなわち、一定の定期的収入は、利子生み資本自体の生じた果実であるとする擬制資本の形成がこれである。利潤は、現実資本が剰余労働を基礎に生み出されたというのでなく、ある元本(株式資本)の利子にほかならないという関係、さらに地代は、同じくある元本(土地価格)の利子にほかならないという関係がこれである。果実としての利潤や地代は現実に形成されている。しかそうした果実を生み出したものは、それ自身に利子を生む資本にほかならないのだ、という関係の形成であるが、実はこのような資本制関係として形成されるにすぎない。そのような果実を利子とする資本は、その資本自体が現実に果実を生んだのではなく、価値の内実をもたないのに、一定の資本価値をもつものと擬制されるのである。いわば資本の理念\\"の現実化は、擬制によらねばならない、ということである。”翻译为中文","output":"首先，“构成阶级的是什么”这一点上，《资本论》所展示的是，资本的社会成立本身就构成了形成阶级的根据。作为没有存立根据的流通形态的资本，社会存立的条件是，除了将原本的社会存立根据——劳动和土地纳入自身运动之外别无选择。但劳动和土地既不是由资本内部创造出来的，也不是可以被资本的包含形态——商品形态所消解的。对资本来说，它不得不将这些作为外部前提。资本作为形态，通过将社会实体即劳动和土地包含在形态关系中，只有通过劳动者对土地和生产手段的劳动、生产过程作为商品生产的商品，资本才得以成立，但承担这些社会实体的劳动力不是资本自身可以作为商品生产的。同样，土地所有本身也不是由资本创造的。因此，资本的社会存立是，作为形态的自身无法同化、无法消解的，且作为自身根本成立条件的劳动力所有者、土地所有者，必须作为社会存在而相对立。资本的非自立的、对社会实体本质上是外部的社会存立，作为现实的社会主体的存立，必然地将承担社会实体的人形成为与之对立的阶级。 其次，资本主义显然以形态上通过商品形态的包含，将阶级关系统一为非阶级的商品关系。阶级关系的“总结”不是由“国家”完成，而是通过商品形态完成的。 然而，商品形态对阶级关系进行整合、“总结”的逻辑中存在一些重要的问题。首先，这不仅仅是由资本主义的流通表面现象形成的。在流通领域中，劳动力同样是劳动力商品的所有者，同时也是货币所有者，资本也是如此。因此，流通领域受“自由、平等、财产和边沁”的统治——但生产过程如何？那里实施着资本对劳动者的专制支配和剥削。即使声称将阶级关系非阶级化地整合，如果这仅仅是流通领域的现象，那么整合也是不完整的。更进一步，如果资本包含了生产过程，马上就会暴露阶级对立，这意味着资本的运动是不自立的。 关于“劳动工资”形态，其中计件工资比计时工资更适合资本主义生产方式。在计件工资下，看似工资由生产者的工作能力决定。“计件工资给予个体更大的活动空间，一方面发展了劳动者的个性，从而激发了自由感、独立性和自律，另一方面也增加了他们之间的竞争”。因此，它甚至可以被理解为协作社工人——这些潜在的工人兼资本家的“中间物”（约翰·沃茨）。 计件工资原本用于支付手工艺者的工作，被视为劳动力商品价格隐藏形态即“劳动工资形态”的“最适合”的形态，意味着只有通过给予雇佣工人“自由感”和“独立性”的形态——甚至给予他们“成为自己主人”的错觉的形态，才能对“劳动”进行形式包含。“劳动”的形态包含和整合在直接生产过程中，不是通过完全物化劳动者、将其解构为生产要素来完成，而是相反，通过给予雇佣工人以劳动报酬这种形式，使他们以某种程度的主体形式——即提供其他生产要素的提供者的平等生产主体、收入获得者的身份的表象——给予雇佣工人小生产者的形式来实现的。"},{"instruction":"请将“土地売買の基準となる地価=土地価格の形成は、こうして株式資本とともに、擬制資本として成立する。それは、資本の〝理念\\"の現実化の一形態にほかならないのである。このような擬制資本の成立とともに、資本は物化され、商品として売買されるものとなる。土地の売買、株券(株式資本)の売買は、まさに擬制資本の売買であり、資本自体が運動体でなく、たんなる物として、商品化されることを示している。こうして、土地所有は、資本所有とともに、たんなる商品の所有として、商品形態に解消されることになる。 資本はもともと商品形態を形態的基礎として流通形態として形成された。さらに資本は労働力の商品化を通して、生産過程を支配する現実の主体として現われた。しかし、「労働」の形態的包摂は、「労働賃金」という擬制的形態を通すことによって達成したのであった。ところが、いまや資本自体も、その最高の完成形態の現実化として、それ自身たんなる商品として売買されるものでしかないことを示したのである。しかもそのことが同時に、土地所有に対しても、一定の地価として表われる商品としての土地所有者にほかならない、という形態を形成するものとなったのである。資本による階級関係の形態的包摂・処理は、資本が階級関係・社会関係の専制的支配者として行なわれるのではなく、その資本自体も実は単なる商品にすぎず、商品に還元されうるものだということによって、すなわち商品形態のうちに他の階級とともに自己自身を還元し、解消することによって、はじめて完全に達成されることになる。 資本所有も、土地所有も、「労働」所有者とともに、単純な商品所有者に解消されるということは、したがって資本主義の階級関係はたんなる商品関係から成り立つという現象を確立するのであり、「労働」の包摂が、「労働」を商品として所有する労働者に擬似主体化を与えるものであったことに対応し、「労働」の専制的支配り、搾取者たる資本が、たんなる一商品所有者でしかないものに自己を擬制的に還元することによって、「労働」の所有者との対等性、同一性を示すものとなる。「労働」の所有者を擬似主体化するだけでは徹底しなかった階級関係の同一市民関係への解消は、こうして資本の最高形態の完成たる擬制資本の形成とともに、完成されるのである。 階級関係の非階級的包摂は、資本主義の現実的主体たる資本によってでなく、資本自体をも商品に還元することを通した商品形態によって達成されるということは、商品形態がブルジョア社会の社会関係、階級関係の一般的包摂形態であることを論理的に再確認することを意味するが、それと同時に、ブルジョア社会に生きる人間を一般的に包摂しうるイデオロギー——市民社会的イデオロギー形成の客観的基盤の存在を確証するものといえよう。 いわゆる市民社会なる関係は、資本主義に先き立つ単純商品生産において現実化されていたというようなものではなく、資本主義のうちに、しかも資本主義の形態的発展の完成とともに、形成されるまさに形態的社会関係、擬制的社会関係にほかならないのである。さて、第三に、階級関係の商品形態的包摂の矛盾ないし限界という点である。 上述した岩田説に対して正当な批判をした降旗氏は、逆に資本による階級関係包摂を絶対化する誤りにおちいっている。資本主義が「労働」と「土地」とを、完全に商品形態に解消し、完全な包摂を実現するものとするならば、階級関係は消滅することになろう。まさに、リカードがそう観念したように、資本による絶対的、専制的支配が行なわれるものとなり、資本主義を絶対化し、永遠化することになってしまう。降旗氏は、それでも「法治国家」としてのブルジョア国家の形成を語っている。だが、資本が「土地」と「労働」その形態のうちに完全包摂してしまうのであれば、法治国家さえ形成基盤を喪失する。「法」によって規制力をもたせる必要はどこにもないのである。 ところが、資本主義は、たしかに階級関係を一般に商品関係として現象させ、商品形態的包摂を実現しながら、絶対に階級関係人間に対する人間の支配関係――という内実を解消することにはならない。これは、岩田氏のように、階級関係を包摂しえないという意味での限界なのではなく、包摂しながら、包摂自体の内的矛盾としての限界なのである。このような意味での限界は、論理的にはど表現されているか。”翻译为中文","output":"土地价格作为土地买卖的基准，与股份资本共同成立为虚拟资本。这只不过是资本“理念”的现实化的一种形式。随着这种虚拟资本的成立，资本被物化，并作为商品被买卖。土地的买卖、股票（股份资本）的买卖，正是虚拟资本的交易，表明了资本本身不作为运动体，而仅作为一种物，被商品化。这样，土地所有权与资本所有权共同作为商品的所有权被商品化。 资本原本作为形态基础的商品形态而形成为流通形态。进一步，资本通过劳动力的商品化，作为支配生产过程的现实主体出现。然而，“劳动”的形态包含是通过虚假的“劳动工资”形态来实现的。如今，资本本身也通过将其最高完成形态的现实化，仅作为商品被买卖。而且，这同时形成了土地所有权以一定的地价表现为商品的土地所有者的形态。随着资本形态包含处理阶级关系、社会关系，资本不作为阶级关系、社会关系的专制支配者，而实际上只是一种商品，通过商品形态将自己与其他阶级一起还原、消解，才最终完全实现。 资本所有权和土地所有权，与“劳动”所有者一样，被简化为单纯的商品所有者，这意味着资本主义的阶级关系基于纯粹的商品关系而建立，“劳动”的包含通过将“劳动”赋予商品形式的劳动者赋予了虚假的主体性，相应地，将自身作为商品所有者的资本决定为“劳动”所有者的平等性、同一性的表现。“劳动”所有者未能完全实现的阶级关系同一市民关系的消解，随着虚拟资本形成的资本的最高形态的完成而达成。 阶级关系的非阶级性包含并非通过现实主体资本来实现，而是通过将资本本身还原为商品的商品形态来实现，这意味着商品形态作为资产阶级社会的社会关系、阶级关系的一般包含形态被逻辑上重新确认，同时也证实了作为一般包含思想——即资产阶级社会意识形态形成的客观基础的存在。 所谓的市民社会关系并非在资本主义之前的简单商品生产中实现，而是在资本主义内部，并随着资本主义形态发展的完成而形成的，正是形态社会关系、虚假社会关系。接下来，在商品形态包含阶级关系的矛盾或限制方面。 降旗先生对于岩田说法的合理批评转而绝对化了资本包含阶级关系的错误。如果资本主义将“劳动”和“土地”完全商品化并实现完全的包含，那么阶级关系将消失。正如里卡多所想象的那样，资本将成为绝对的、专制的统治者，从而使资本主义绝对化、永恒化。即便如此，降旗先生还谈到了作为“法治国家”的资产阶级国家的形成。但是，如果资本将“土地”和“劳动”完全包含在其形态内，那么法治国家甚至会失去形成基础。\\"法\\"不再需要赋予监管力。 然而，资本主义确实以商品形态包含并表现出一般的阶级关系，实现商品形态包含的同时，绝不能消解人对人的支配关系——即其内在实质。这不是像岩田先生那样，因为无法包含阶级关系而受限，而是在包含的同时，作为包含自身内在矛盾的限制。这种限制以何种逻辑方式表现？"},{"instruction":"请将“第一に、「労働」を商品形態に包摂し、資本―賃労働関係を、商品交換関係として現象させる関係は、マルクス自身「労働賃金」形態を「想像的表現」であり、「土地の価値」と同じものだとしているように、一種の擬制的形態にすぎない、ということである。上述したように、実体としての「労働」を形態的関係に溶解しえない資本は、「労働」の包摂を、「労働」なる商品の売り手であり、「自分自身の主人である」という擬似的主体化を通して実現する。しかし、すでにこのことのうちに、資本による「労働」包摂の限界が露呈しているといってよい。擬制関係は、それが擬制にすぎないことによって、決してそれ自身が本質に転化するものではなく、むしろ本質的関係に基礎づけられながら、これを隠蔽し、歪曲するものでしかないのである。つまり、「労働賃金」形態はたしかに現実的形態であり、しかも現実的機能さえ発揮する。だが、これを擬制としてでなく、本質ととらえるのは、まさにイデオロギー=プチブル・イデオロギーなのである。ということは、「労働賃金」形態による資本の「労働」包摂は、それが本質的には擬制関係でしかないということによって、その本質に存在する階級対立・搾取関係を完全に隠蔽しきることにはならない。実体を形態的関係に解消しきれるものではないということは、形態的解消が擬制関係によるしかないということに表現されている。 第二に、土地所有者とともに、資本所有者自体をも、たんなる商品所有者に還元する資本の商品化も、上述したように直接には擬制資本の商品化として成立する。擬制資本は、それ自身で利子を生み出すという資本の理想的姿を現実化させたものにほかならないが、それが擬制でしかないということによって、自己存立の根拠をそれ自身もたないことを暴露する。その成立根拠は、利潤の現実的形成であり、労働力の商品化を通した剰余労働の搾取をおいてほかにない。さらに、擬制資本としての株式資本や土地価格形成の基準となる利子率は、産業資本の現実的運動を基礎にした資金貸借関係―貨幣市場によって形成されるのであって、株券や土地の売買自体が利子率を決定するわけではない。この点も、擬制資本の成立は、産業資本による剰余価値の現実的形成に根拠をもつものであることを示すものといってよい。 形態規定としての資本は、その純粋な形態的自立を達成すべく、人間(労働力)と自然との関わり社会存立の実体的根拠としての労働・生産過程に依ることなく、形態自体としての価値増殖を実現しようとする。「それ自身に利子を生むものとしての資本」は、その純化された、最高の完成形態であった。しかし、本来形態にすぎぬ資本は、まさに社会的実体によらねば存立しえない。「それ自身に利子を生むものとしての資本」は理念であり、現実には達成されないのである。そして、その現実化は、株式資本や土地価格などの擬制資本でしかない。資本の理念の実現は、フィクションによるしかないということである。このことは、資本の生産過程における「労働」の形態的処理が、機械化・合理化を通して徹底して行なわれながら、なお〝物による物の生産〟には解消しえず、「労働」主体としての労働に基づかざるをえないこと、したがって「労働」の形態的処理は、擬制的な「労働賃金」形態によるほかなかったということ、対応する。”翻译为中文","output":"首先，“劳动”被包含于商品形态之中，资本与雇佣劳动关系作为商品交换关系呈现，正如马克思自己所指出的，“劳动工资”形态是一种“想象的表现”，与“土地的价值”同样，仅是一种虚拟的形态。正如上述，资本无法将实体“劳动”溶解于形态关系之中，通过将“劳动”作为商品的卖方进行“虚假主体化”来实现“劳动”的包含。但此刻，已经可以说资本对“劳动”的包含限制已经显现。虚拟关系，由于其仅仅是虚构，绝不可能本身转化为本质，反而在基于本质关系的同时，将其隐藏和扭曲。即，“劳动工资”形态固然是现实形态，甚至发挥现实功能，但将其理解为本质，而不是虚构，正是意识形态——小资产阶级意识形态。这意味着，“劳动工资”形态下资本对“劳动”的包含，由于其本质上仅是虚构关系，无法完全隐藏存在于其本质的阶级对立和剥削关系。无法完全以形态关系消解实体，意味着形态消解只能通过虚构关系实现。 其次，将土地所有者以及资本所有者本身还原为纯粹的商品所有者，正如上述，直接以虚拟资本的商品化形式成立。虚拟资本作为资本实现其理想形态的体现，但正因其仅是虚拟，暴露了它自身不具备自立根据。其成立根据在于利润的现实形成，以及通过劳动力商品化所剥削的剩余劳动。此外，作为虚拟资本的股份资本和土地价格形成的标准利率，是基于实业资本的现实运动的资金借贷关系——货币市场形成的，并非股票或土地买卖本身决定利率。这一点也表明，虚拟资本的成立基于实业资本对剩余价值的现实形成。 作为形态规定的资本，企图不依赖于人类（劳动力）和自然与社会存在的实体根据的劳动和生产过程，自身作为形态实现价值增殖。“自生利息的资本”是其纯粹形式、最完美的完成形态。然而，本质上仅是形态的资本，必须依靠社会实体才能存立。“自生利息的资本”是理念，现实中无法实现。其现实化仅是股份资本和土地价格等虚拟资本。资本理念的实现必须通过虚构来实现。这表明资本对“劳动”的形态处理，尽管通过机械化、合理化得以彻底实施，但仍无法简化为“物生物”的生产，因为生产过程基于劳动主体即工人的劳动，因此“劳动”的形态处理只能通过虚拟的“劳动工资”形态来实现，对应于此。"},{"instruction":"请将“しかも、第三に擬制資本としての株式資本と土地価格が形成されても、それらの売買関係は、資本家的経済関係の内部では一般的に現実化するものではない、ということである。なぜならば、株券や土地に資本を投下したとしても、獲得されるのは利子に相当する配当や地代でしかない。産業資本等の現実資本に資本を投下すれば、利潤がえられる関係があるのに、利子に相当する利得しかえられな投資を行なうということは、一般にありえないからである。資本と土地は、擬制資本化されて商品形態をとるが、ところがその擬制資本の売買関係自体は、純粋な資本主義的関係内では一般に現実化しない。それは、資金を資本として投じながら、平均的利潤さええられず、利子程度を獲得すればよいという中小零細企業や小農業の存在を前提にする。そういう現実的条件が存在しなければ、擬制資本の売買が現実化しないということは、資本主義の限界発展極限を示すといってよい。資本主義の確立は、労働力の商品化によって行なわれるが、しかし労働力の商品化は特殊の歴史的条件に依存する。それと同じように、資本の最高の完成形態の具体化として株式資本や土地売買の実際的展開は、資本主義的関係外の具体的歴史的条件にかかっているのである。自己の最高の発展形態を、自己の関係内部で実現できないということは、明らかに資本主義の歴史的限界を示すものといえよう。 ところで、株式資本と土地価格についてはそれが資本主義関係内部で現実に売買しえない点では同じとしても、一定の相違がある。株式の発行は、すでに企業を所有している資本家自体が、株式を社会的に売り出すわけで、企業に対する所有・支配が、資本家によって行なわれていることは変りない。株券の販売にとっての問題は、基本的に利子に相応する配当の獲得に資金を投ずる企業外部の関係にかかってくる。これに対して、土地の売買関係は、資本家が土地に資本を投下するかどうかという問題になる。もし、資本家が、土地を買入れて同時に土地所有者になったとすれば、そしてこの関係一般に行なわれるとすれば、土地所有者が資本家に対抗する階級としては形成されない。だが、資本家にとって、土地に資本を投下するのは、合理的ではないのである。その理由は、すでに述べたように、土地投資によって利子に相応する地代負担は免れるが、それだけの資本を企業に投下すれば、利子を上回る利潤を獲得できるからである。最大限の価値増殖を目的とする資本は、一般に土地投資を行なわず、地代を支払って土地を借入れることになる。ここから、資本主義の下でも、資本の要請として、すくなくとも絶対地代分を免れる土地国有化の要求が生ずることにもなる。 資本家が、一般に土地投資を合理的とせず、土地所有を行なわないということになれば、土地所有は、資本家外の者にゆだねられることになる。したがって、土地所有者は結局資本家に対抗する一階級を形成することになる。もし、現実に土地の商品としての売買が行なわれず、土地私有関係が確定されないとすれば、国家が法的に一定の者に土地を帰属させることになるか、あるいは国有という手段をとる。それは国家による土地の私的所有であり、その意味は無産労働者の社会的確保をはかることにある。一般には現実の土地売買を基礎にして、私有権が形成される。だがこれも、資本関係外の具体的歴史的関係にかかっている。土地の商品経済的包摂にとっては、土地の商品化という擬制関係を通すしかないが、しかもそれによっても資本はその内的関係のうちに、土地所有を包摂しえないという限界を露呈するのである。 第四に、資本及び土地が、擬制資本として統合されるのに対し、「労働」は擬制資本になり切れないという点である。「労働賃金」を利子とみなして形成される擬制資本は形成されない。人間自体を商品として売買することにはならないからである。しかも、労働者は「労働賃金」形態を通して、一主体として擬制されるのであるが、しかしいぜん資本の支配の下で労働を行ない、剰余労働を搾取されるという内実は解消されない。資本家及び土地所有者が、ただ所有するだけで一定の果実を獲得するのに対して、「労働」の所有者は、現実に「労働」を行なわなければ、所得=賃金を獲得しえないのである。

关于股份资本和土地价格，尽管它们在资本主义关系内部无法实现交易的点相同，但存在一定差异。发行股票的是已经拥有企业的资本家本人，企业对股票的所有和支配由资本家进行，没有改变。股票销售问题基本上与企业外部关系有关，投资于获得相当于利息的股利。与此相对，土地买卖关系涉及资本家是否对土地进行资本投资的问题。如果资本家购买土地同时成为土地所有者，且这种关系普遍进行，则土地所有者不会形成与资本家对立的阶级。但对资本家来说，对土地进行资本投资是不合理的。这是因为，如同前述，尽管通过土地投资可以免除相当于利息的地租负担，但如果相同资本投入企业，则可以获得超过利息的利润。以最大化价值增殖为目标的资本一般不进行土地投资，而选择支付地租借用土地。由此，即便在资本主义下，也会产生至少免除绝对地租部分的土地国有化的需求。 如果资本家一般认为土地投资不合理，不进行土地所有，则土地所有最终由非资本家承担。因此，土地所有者最终会形成与资本家对立的一个阶级。如果实际上没有进行土地作为商品的买卖，土地私有关系未被确认，则由国家通过法律将土地归属于特定个体，或采取国有化措施。这是国家对土地进行私有化，其意义在于确保无产劳动者的社会保障。一般基于实际的土地买卖形成私有权。但这也依赖于资本关系以外的具体历史条件。对于土地的商品化包含，只能通过土地商品化的虚构关系实现，但即便如此也暴露了资本无法在其内部关系中包含土地所有的限制。 第四，与资本和土地作为虚拟资本被整合相对，\\"劳动\\"无法成为完全的虚拟资本。虚拟资本以\\"劳动工资\\"被视为利息的形式不会形成。这是因为人类本身不能作为商品被买卖。而且，工人通过\\"劳动工资\\"形态作为一个主体被虚构化，但仍在资本的支配下进行劳动，被剥削剩余劳动，其内在实质并未被消解。与只需拥有就能获得一定成果的资本家和土地所有者相对，\\"劳动\\"所有者如果不实际进行\\"劳动\\"，就无法获得收入=工资。"},{"instruction":"请将“擬制資本による統合も、こうして本来の「労働」主体たる労働者そのうちに統合しきれるものではない。いわゆる所得範疇としても、結局商品としての擬制資本所有による利子と「労働」による所得=賃金というように二元化されてしまう。もちろん、「労働」-賃金という所得範疇には、本来の「労働」――生産手段に対する主体的働きかけとしての労働のほか、経営管理、労務管理、営業等に関わる労働も含まれることになり、現実の資本―賃労働関係は隠蔽され、歪曲されてしまう。それにしても、いかに資本・土地所有が、擬制的に商品形態に還元されたにしても、その対極に「労働」賃金をおかざるをえないということは、同じ所得範疇においても、財産所有利子と「労働」一賃金という相違を残さざるをえない、ということであり、階級対立の本質は、こうした商品形態によ包摂の中にも、露呈するのである。 （三）さて、以上のような原理論の論理を通して、ブルジョア国家に対する理論的基盤が確定されるといってよい。それでは、ブルジョア国家はいかに成立し、いかなる特徴をもつか。 第一に、資本主義における階級関係が、一般に商品形態として包摂されるということから、つまり「労働」のみならず、資本自体もまたたんなる一商品にすぎず、土地所有も商品所有に還元されるということから、このような統合が直接には擬制的関係であるにしても、資本主義においては、そこに生存するすべての人間を包摂する一般的イデオロギーが成立しうることを意味している。そのイデオロギーは、ブルジョア・イデオロギーというより、「市民」的イデオロギー、プチブル・イデオロギーにほかならない。階級関係の非階級的・商品形態的包摂は、資本自体をもたんなる商品所有者に擬制的に還元し、賃労働者を逆に「労働」所有者として擬似主体化させることによって、資本家も、賃金労働者にも一般的に共通する小商品所有者としてのイデオロギーを形成させる、といってよい。プチブル・イデオロギーこそ、日常的に、一般的に、すべての階級を統合するイデオロギーとして成立する。資本主義を「市民社会」ととらえるのは、まさにこのようなイデオロギーによるのである。 このような「市民」的イデオロギーは、資本主義社会に生存するすべての「市民」による日常生活上の相互規制―自己規制を形成させることになる。このような社会関係を一般的に統合するイデオロギーの形成こそ、法的秩序形成の直接的基盤にほかならない。いわゆる「市民法」は、こうしたプチブル・イデオロギーによる「市民」の自己規制関係、市民的秩序の維持関係を、規範化し、法的規制力をもたせたものにすぎない、といってよい。 近代国家としてのブルジョア国家は、まず何よりもこのような法治国家として成立する。しかし、その法的規制力は、それによって外的に資本家社会的関係を規制するものというより、むしろ「市「民」による共同の社会的秩序を守ろうとする相互規制=自己規制に依拠して、その効果を発揮するのである。同市民的関係は、本質的には擬制であることからいえば、このような「市民」による共同の社会秩序共同利益の維持は、擬制であり、幻想ともいうべきであが、しかし、その幻想もたんなる観念ではなく、資本家的経済関係自体のなかに、現実的基盤をもって成立するイデオロギーに基づいているのである。 しかし、第二に、このような「市民」的イデオロギーが、イデオロギーでしかないということは、現実の「市民社会」が擬制でしかないことに基づいている。ということは、このようなイデオロギーに対抗する別のイデオロギーの形成を資本主義はなくしおおせるものではない、ということである。「市民」社会が擬制でしかないことは、それを擬制としてとらえる思想形成の余地を必ず残す。”翻译为中文","output":"首先，作为虚拟资本的股份资本和土地价格即使形成了，它们的买卖关系在资本家经济关系内部并不是普遍现实化的，因为即便将资本投资于股票或土地中，获得的只是相当于利息的股利或地租而已。相较之下，如果将资本投资于实业资本等实际资本中，可以获得利润的关系存在，在只能获得等同于利息的收益的投资是一般不会发生的。资本和土地虽然作为虚拟资本化而呈现商品形态，但其虚拟资本的买卖关系本身在纯粹的资本主义关系内部通常不会现实化。其前提是中小微企业和小农业的存在，期待的不是平均利润，而是满足于获得相当于利息的收益。若不存在这种实际条件，虚拟资本的买卖将不会现实化，这可被视为展示了资本主义发展的极限。资本主义的确立是通过劳动力的商品化实现的，然而劳动力的商品化依赖于特殊的历史条件。同样地，股份资本和土地买卖作为资本最高完成形态的具体化，依赖于资本主义关系以外的具体历史条件。无法在自己的关系内部实现自己的最高发展形态表明了资本主义的历史限制。 其次，尽管股份资本和土地价格在资本主义关系内部无法现实买卖的点相同，但存在一定的差异。股票发行基于已经拥有企业的资本家本人向社会公开发售股票，对企业的所有和支配由资本家进行并没有改变。股票销售的问题基本上依赖于企业外部关系，投资以获得相当于利息的股利。而土地买卖关系涉及资本家是否对土地进行资本投资的问题。如果资本家购入土地同时成为土地所有者，且这种关系普遍进行，则土地所有者将不会形成与资本家对立的阶级。但对资本家而言，对土地进行资本投资是不合理的，因为如同之前所述，虽然通过土地投资可以免除相当于利息的地租负担，但如果相同的资本投资于企业，可以获得超过利息的利润。资本以最大化价值增殖为目标，一般不会进行土地投资，而选择支付地租租借土地。由此，资本主义条件下，至少免除绝对地租部分的土地国有化的要求可能出现。 如果资本家普遍认为土地投资不合理，不进行土地所有，则土地所有最终将由非资本家承担。因此，土地所有者最终将形成与资本家对立的一个阶级。如果实际上土地作为商品的买卖未发生，土地私有关系未被确认，则国家将通过法律将土地归属于特定个体，或采取国有化措施。这是国家对土地进行私有化，其意义在于确保无产阶级劳动者的社会保障。通常基于实际土地买卖形成私有权。但这同样依赖于资本关系以外的具体历史条件。土地的商品经济包含必须通过土地商品化的虚构关系实现，但这仍然暴露了资本无法在其内部关系中包含土地所有的限制。 第四，与资本和土地作为虚拟资本被整合相对，“劳动”无法完全成为虚拟资本。“劳动工资”被视为利息而形成的虚拟资本不会形成。这是因为人类本身不能作为商品被买卖。尽管工人通过“劳动工资”形式被虚构为一个主体，但仍然在资本的支配下进行劳动，被剥削剩余劳动，其内在实质并未解消。与仅需拥有便可获得一定结果的资本家和土地所有者相比，“劳动”所有者若不实际进行“劳动”，则无法获得收入=工资。"},{"instruction":"i

Here are some steps and tips to keep it smooth and positive: 1. **Confident Body Language**: Before you even speak, your body language says a lot about you. Stand tall, smile, and make eye contact. This non-verbal communication shows you're friendly and confident. 2. **Choose the Right Moment**: Wait for an appropriate moment to approach her. Avoid interrupting her if she's busy, in the middle of a conversation, or obviously not in the mood to talk. A social setting like a party, class break, or mutual friend's gathering can offer natural opportunities for introductions. 3. **Start with a Casual Greeting**: Begin with a simple \\"Hi\\" or \\"Hey.\\" Pair it with a smile. This helps to break the ice and sets a friendly tone for the conversation. 4. **Introduce Yourself**: After your initial greeting, go ahead and introduce yourself. \\"Hi, I'm [Your Name].\\" It's straightforward and unassuming. You could even add a bit about how you noticed her, assuming it’s context-appropriate, like mentioning a mutual friend, class, or event. \\"I've seen you around in our Philosophy class, and I thought I'd introduce myself.\\" 5. **Find a Common Ground**: Try to find something you both have in interest or in common as a way to prolong the conversation naturally. You could comment on something in the environment, ask about her interests, or talk about the event you're both at. But, remember to be genuinely interested in her response. 6. **Listen Actively**: When she speaks, listen. Active listening involves nodding, making eye contact, and reacting appropriately to what she's saying. It shows that you're genuinely interested in knowing her. 7. **Be Respectful and Mindful of Her Response**: Pay attention to her body language and verbal responses. If she seems disinterested or uncomfortable, gracefully exit the conversation. Something like, \\"It was nice meeting you; I hope you enjoy your evening,\\" respects her space. 8. **Casual Farewell with a Possible Connection**: If the conversation goes well, you might want to leave a door open for future interactions. \\"It was great talking to you. Maybe we can chat more over coffee sometime.\\" If she seems interested, you could ask for her contact information or social media. Remember, the goal here is to make a positive, respectful first impression. If she's not interested, it's crucial to respect her feelings and withdraw gracefully. Every interaction won't lead to a friendship or relationship, and that's perfectly okay. The key is to remain friendly, genuine, and respectful."},{"instruction":"Give me example","output":"Imagine you're at a college campus café and you see a girl sitting alone, reading a book you recognize or find interesting. Here's how you might introduce yourself casually: **Step 1:** Make sure she is not deeply engrossed in the book or wearing headphones, as these are generally signs someone might not want to be disturbed. **Step 2:** Approach with a friendly, confident demeanor. Offer a small, genuine smile as you approach, ensuring your body language is open and non-threatening. **Step 3:** Start with a casual greeting and mention of the book. For example: - **You:** \\"Hey, I couldn't help but notice you're reading [Book Title]. That's one of my favorites. Hi, by the way, I'm [Your Name].\\" This approach is natural and shows a shared interest, making it relevant and not too forward. **Step 4:** Wait for her response. If she smiles, looks up from the book, and responds positively, that's your cue to continue the conversation. If she gives short answers and goes back to her book, it might mean she's not interested in chatting. **Step 5:** If the conversation progresses, you can ask what she enjoys about the book or share a thought you had when you read it. For example: - **You:** \\"What do you think about the author's take on [specific aspect of the book]? I found it pretty interesting how...\\" **Step 6:** As the conversation develops, ask open-ended questions that encourage dialogue, showing genuine interest in her thoughts and opinions. **Step 7:** If your chat comes to a natural lull or if it feels appropriate to end the conversation, suggest a potential future interaction without pressure. For example: - **You:** \\"I've really enjoyed talking about [Book Title] with you. If you're up for it, maybe we could discuss it more over coffee sometime? No pressure, though.\\" **Step 8:** Regardless of her response to your suggestion for future interaction, be courteous and respectful. If she seems interested, offer your phone number or ask for hers. If she declines, politely exit the conversation: - **You:** \\"It was really nice meeting you and chatting about [topic]. I hope you enjoy the rest of the book. Have a great day!\\" This example demonstrates a respectful, genuine, and casual way to introduce yourself to a girl. The focus on a shared interest (like a book) provides a natural starting point for conversation, emphasizes mutual ground, and makes the introduction feel less abrupt or unwarranted. Throughout the interaction, paying attention to her cues — both verbal and nonverbal — is crucial for ensuring the conversation remains comfortable and consensual for both parties."},{"instruction":"O que é sabanização","output":"A sabanização é um processo de transformação ambiental em que um ecossistema, geralmente uma floresta, gradativamente se converte numa savana ou em um ambiente savânico. Esta modificação pode ser resultado de uma série de fatores, incluindo mudanças climáticas, incêndios frequentes, ação de herbívoros em grande escala, e atividades humanas, como o desmatamento e a agricultura não sustentável. O conceito se baseia na observação de que determinadas ações ou condições podem levar à redução ou eliminação da cobertura arbórea, favorecendo o aparecimento de vegetação típica de savanas, que são ecossistemas caracterizados por uma cobertura de gramíneas, com árvores esparsas e arbustos. A sabanização é particularmente relevante para a discussão sobre mudanças climáticas e conservação ambiental, pois indica uma alteração profunda nos ecossistemas que pode ter importantes repercussões na biodiversidade, nos ciclos hidrológicos, na captura de carbono, entre outros aspectos fundamentais para o equilíbrio ambiental. Um dos exemplos mais citados de uma área sob risco de sabanização é a Amazônia. Estudos sugerem que a combinação de desmatamento, mudanças no regime de chuvas e aumento na frequência e intensidade de incêndios florestais poderia levar a uma transformação significativa na maior floresta tropical do mundo, resultando na perda de sua característica biodiversidade e nos serviços ecossistêmicos providos por ela."},{"instruction":"oWrite an interesting, dialogue-filled, thriller movie and novel style, clockpunk style, dieselpunk style, very early cyberpunk style, Japanese dark fantasy light novel, manga, anime and visual novel style format, Japanese high fantasy light novel, manga, anime and visual novel style format, Japanese urban fantasy light novel, manga, anime and visual novel style format, Western dark high fantasy pulp book, comic and movie format, Japanese science fiction/science fantasy light novel, manga, anime and visual novel style format, edgy Western science fiction novel/movie + 80s-90s Japanese science fiction/fantasy manga anime format style narrative set in a world with influences from the Fallout video game franchise, and also from the feudal period of Japanese history under the various shogunates, Han China under the pre-Qing, pre-1664 Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" and the pre-Yuan dynasty and pre-Mongol Empire Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song Empire/\\"Song dynasty\\" and then under the post-Qing, post-Xinhai Revolution, Beiyang Government-ruled First Republic of China, both as the short-lived Empire of China founded [the Empire of China] by Yuan Shikai and as the First Republic of China from 1911-1915 and 1916-1928, the Han Chinese Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Empire of Vietnam ruling over Vietnam from 1802-1955, the post-Tokugawa shogunate and pre-1947 Great Japanese Empire ruling over Korea, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, the Carolines, the Marinas, Sahlakin and the Kurils, modern day Japan, modern day Vietnam and Okinawa from the Japanese Home Islands in the form of a crossover fanfic between Hyakka Ryouran, Majikoi: Love Me Seriously and the Chinese novel/comic series VERSATILE MAGE, in which the 1868 Meiji Restoration that [the Meiji Restoration] leads to the formation of the Great Japanese Empire instead leads to the Japanese Imperial Family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato, regaining executive control over the Japanese government while the Tokugawa shoguns instead act in a manner akin to the German Reichkanzlers.

The loss of both charismatic leaders [Wilson and Lenin] inadvertently prevents the Cold War between the USA and the USSR as the Soviets are essentially trapped in European Russia while the anti-Soviet, anti-Socialist, monarchist, Russian nationalist, Russian supremacist, monarchist, Orthodox Christian Whites essentially manage to hold on to Siberia and the Russian East Coast, with Admiral Kolchak serving [Kolchak] as Supreme Leader [Kolchak] of Russia. The American Democrat Party is utterly annihilated in the polls and [the US Democrat Party] never wins a single American election again, with American elections being split between the Republicans, American isolationists and American progressives. The German nationalist, anti-capitalist, Russophobic, anti-communist National Socialist German Workers' Party/NSDAP-ruled Greater Germanic Reich/\\"Nazi Germany\\" and the guild socialist, anti-capitalist, corporatist, anti-communist National Fascist Party-ruled Second Roman Empire/\\"Fascist Italy\\" still come into existence thanks to the Great Depression and the Greater German Reich still annexes Austria, reclaims the Sudetenland and the Saar, and splits Czechoslovakia into the German protectorate of Bohemia and the Republic of Slovakia lead by Josef Tizo, but the infamous Führer und Reichskanzler [Leader and Chancellor of the Reich |Führer und Reichskanzler|] of the Greater German Reich, the ex-WW1 Austrian war vet Adolf Schicklgruber, [Adolf] is [Adolf] in fact the Gippsland, Australia-born openly gay nephew [Adolf] of [who's Adolf's uncle is in this story] pre-WW1 and pre-Versailles Germany's last Kaiser [Emperor], Willhelm II of the German House of Hohenzollern ruling [the House of Hohenzollern] over the Kingdom of Prussia that [Prussia] dominated the pre-WW1 and pre-Versalies German Empire, [Adolf] having [Adolf] been [Adolf] chosen by Willhelm as his [Willhelm's] successor after the death of his [Willhelm's] preferred successor, Adolf's father Alois in [when Alois died] 1903, with the NSDAP being [the NSDAP] founded [the NSDAP] as a minor monarchist organization [the NSDAP] to support him [Adolf] in his [Adolf's] succession of Willhelm as German Kaiser. Adolf's partner and [Adolf's] Imperial consort is the illegitimate son of pre-WW1 and pre-Versalies Austria's last Kaiser, Franz Josef I of the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-Lorraine, [Franz Josef I's illegitimate son] Sebastian von Hapsburg, who [Sebastian] resembles his [Sebastian's] close relative and the man who helped get Adolf in power, the Prussian general turned politician in Weimar Germany, Paul von Hindenberg, with the two [Sebastian and Adolf] being [Sebastian and Adolf] the imperial couple [Sebastian and Adolf] of the Greater Germanic Reich. Some of Adolf's sperm is [Adolf's sperm] stolen from him [Adolf] by the Russian Jewish organized crime monster known as the Mishpuka and [Adolf's sperm] used to [Adolf's sperm] impregnate the daughter of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who [Josef] was [Josef] in fact [Josef's true identity] the illegitimate son [Josef] of [whose Josef's true mother was] the last Empress of post-1917, post-Soviet Imperial Russia, Alexandra Feodorovna of the German Grand Duchy of Hesse, who [Josef's and Adolf's unwitting love grandchild] goes on to have children with the grandson of Sebastian, unknowingly preserving the Hesse and Hohenzollern bloodlines. During WW2 Adolf and the Greater German Reich's unified armed forces, the Wehrmacht [defense force |Wehrmacht|], consisting of the Heer (army), the Kriegsmarine (navy) and the Luftwaffe (air force), [Adolf and the Wehrmacht] concentrate on [Adolf and the Wehrmacht] attacking the Western Allies first, paying key attention to Walter Wever's theory of strategic bombing as a means to wage war. No allowing the British forces to escape at Dunkirk and earlier, more development of wunder-waffen [wonder weapon] technology like ICBMs, nukes and jet fighters means that the Battle of Britain becomes the predecessor for a successful Operation Sea Lion and soon the United Kingdom faces the same fate as France, with German generals in London dictating the terms of peace. The British Isles are divided into separate kingdoms ruled by either German royal houses or coopted native houses and the British and French colonial Empires soon become one under the Reich, providing massive amount of resources and equipment for the Axis [Italy, Germany, Bulgaria] war machine. Due to the complete defeat and subjectuation of the Western Allies under the Germanic boot with the Italians receiving Egypt, Sudan, all of the Horn of Africa and a good portion of the Arab peninsula along with Greece, with Croatia and Bosnia being liberated as the Italian Independent State of Croatia under the rule of the Italian royal family, the Savoys with the infamous Catholic supremacist, Croat supremacist, anti-Serbian Ustasha serving as the main force in the Independent State of Croatia. Germany maintains the General Government autonomous administration in German-occupied Poland proper, but [Germany] formalizes Breton independence in the French region of Brittany, [Germany] moving the administration of the so-called \\"Vichy France\\" [actually the Third French Republic under German supervision] to Northern France, allowing it [\\"Vichy France\\"] to [\\"Vichy France\\"] return [\\"Vichy France\\"] to its [\\"Vichy France\\"'s] Napoleonic-Roman political roots, while [Germany] establishing an independent Occitania in Southern France. The Netherlands is [the Netherlands] still absorbed directly into the Reich with Belgium being split between \\"Vichy France\\" and Germany. The Axis, with the help of Japan, China, Manchuria and Mongolia, then attack and [the Axis and the Asian alliance] destroy the landlocked, weakened and isolated USSR with the help of the rump White Russians in Siberia and the Russian Far East. Japan seizes the Russian Far East and [Japan] establishes a puppet confederation in Siberia, while European Russia became the German colony of Reichskommissariat Moskowien as a restored Danish-German-Russian Imperial House of Romanov-ruled Russian Empire with the Whites and the Russian nationalist, fascist, Russian supremacist Russian Fascist Party being the only political force allowed in European Russia. Stalin, having [Stalin] secretly [Stalin] despised the Soviets and the Communist system and [Stalin] having survived the war, [Stalin] adopts the identity of \\"Josef Romanov\\" and [Josef] plays a key role in [Josef] ensuring that Prince Nicholas Romanov's reign as Czar Nicholas III of Russia is as smooth as possible. Adolf is [Adolf] forced to [Adolf] give up all the Allied colonies in East Asia and Oceania to the Japanese on the advice of his [Adolf's] Wehrmacht generals, although the Wehrmacht does help the Beiyang Army and the Manchurian New Army quash neo-Chiangist nationalist uprisings in the China region. Chiang and his [Chiang's] minions, along with the remnants of the Soviet government, flee to the island of Hainan, [the KMT splinter cells and the Soviet remnants] establishing a joint Nationalist Chinese-Soviet government in exile that is only supported by the Americans and the anti-German British government in exile in all but name in Canada. Ho Ching Ming and the Viet Cong turn against the Americans and the Soviets and join forces with the now-independent from France Vietnamese imperial government and other Vietnamese nationalist groups to help remove Soviet and Nationalist Chinese troops from Southeast Asia with the help of the Japanese, in exchange for the French puppet Vietnamese Emperor Bao Dai being replaced with the rightful heir to the Vietnamese throne, Cường Để as Emperor of Vietnam. The rest of the 20th century proceeds as a Cold War akin to that of OTL with the British Empire in exile taking the place of Soviet Russia, the USA taking the place of the People's Republic of China, Germany and the European bloc it [Germany] forms around itself taking the place of the British Commonwealth and Japan and the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere taking the place of the USA and USSR respectively. The Civil Rights movement in the USA is confined to the American Deep South and is focused on ending racism and Democrat Party control over the American South. Adolf surprisingly lives until 2004, [Adolf] outliving all his [Adolf's] rivals, Prime Minister Churchill of Great Britain, the American Presidents and the Soviet system. Nicholas III outlives Adolf, [Nicholas III] living until 2016 with his [Nicholas III's] daughter, Princess Natalia Nikolaevna Romanova, succeeding him [Nicholas III] as imperial ruler of Russia, [Natalia] becoming [Natalia] Tzarina [Empress} Natalia I of Russia. After Adolf's death, a regency council is [the regency council] formed to govern the Greater German Reich in the meanwhile, while agents of the Reich's combined domestic secret police agency and foreign intelligence agency, the Reich Security Main Office, search the world for a suitable candidate to be placed on the German throne to bear the title of both Kaiser and |Führer und Reichskanzler of Germany. The descendants of Josef, Sebastian and Adolf though Adolf's stolen sperm are eventually found, living in Jamaica under English aliases. Due to the intermarriage of said descendants into Japanese immigrant families in Jamaica the children in the family all bear Japanese names and are culturally Japanese: speaking Japanese, English and Jamaican Creole and [the Children] speaking barely a lick of German. The oldest boy, a black-haired, blue-eyed, tall and slender youth named Kizuna, is [Kizuna] chosen as the next Kaiser of Germany under the regal name Brian I while his [Kizuna's] tall and buxom older sister who shares his [Kizuna's] black hair and [Kizuna's] blue eyes, Reiri is [Reiri] given the German name Bertha and [Reiri] given her [Reiri's] rightful position as a German princess. Due to an unusual contract between the Prussian branch of the Hohenzollern family that Willhelm II was the last of and the Japanese supernatural world that Adolf maintained, Kizuna and his [Kizuna's] little sister, the blonde-haired, amber-eyed, short and petite but hyperintelligent and somewhat reclusive Setsuna, [Setsuna and Kizuna] are [Setsuna and Kizuna] forced to go to school in Kamakura, Japan, more specifically Buou Academic School, an academy [Buou Academic School] where [Bouou Academic School] children of military families train to become samurai warriors. The excerpt should focus on Kizuna, under the alias of \\"Orimura Ichika\\" adjusting to his [Kizuna's] new life at Buou Academic School, his [Ichika's] encounter with the main male protagonist of Majikoi, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, outwardly sly with a huge network of associates and contacts, but benevolent and kind towards others, not the type to take defeat too well, secretly perverted, upbeat and cunning strategist Naoe Yamato [Majikoi: Oh Samurai Girls] and his [Yamato's] biological younger sister, the brown-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and petite but also secretly curvy and buxom, intellectually gifted and academically brilliant but also cheerfully, happy-go-lucky with a love of fighting half-dog monster young martial arts prodigy Okamoto \\"Wanko\\" Kazuko [Majikoi: Love Me Seriously ] who [Kazuko] is [Kazuko] one of Yamato's Master Samurai in this fic, [Ichika] meeting the black-haired, red-eyed, tall, curvaceous and rather buxom, tomboyish, tough-going and confident, overconfident, battle maniac, fun-loving and spendthrift, slightly bisexual and highly lecherous but also soft, understanding andf caring martial arts prodigy and renowed streer fighter Kawakami Momoyo [Majikoi: Love Me Seriously] and the short, petite and slender but also somewhat buxom, black-haired, purple-eyed, arrogant and brash but also sensitive, shy, reserved, softspoken and lonely Japanese princess and traditional Japanese beauty, Fushikawa Kokoro, [Ichika] earning the suspicion of both girls [Kokoro and Momoyo] due to his [Ichika's] heavy Jamaican accent.","output":"Given the immense depth and complexity of your request, generating a detailed narrative that encapsulates all elements accurately and fully would be highly expansive and beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can craft a brief but dynamic excerpt focusing on the character dynamics and setting as requested, diving straight into a pivotal scene at Buou Academic School. --- The ancient bells of Buou Academic School chimed, their resonance a reminder of a tradition that had seen eras come and go. Amidst the sea of students, Kizuna, now under the guise of \\"Orimura Ichika,\\" navigated the courtyards with a blend of caution and curiosity. His tall, slender frame stood out, not just for the physicality he bore but the aura that surrounded him. The air of regality wasn't something easily shed, even under the vast skies of Kamakura. \\"Ichika-san,\\" a voice called out, pulling him from his thoughts. Yamato Naoe approached, his demeanor casual but eyes sharp. By his side, Kazuko, also known as \\"Wanko,\\" fidgeted with excitement, the amber of her eyes reflecting a spirited energy. \\"Ichika, huh? You’re the new transfer student from Jamaica, right?\\" Yamato's tone was light, but his gaze was assessing, trying to peel layers of mystery that Ichika carried. \\"Yes, that's correct. It's a pleasure to meet you, Yamato, Kazuko,\\" Ichika replied, his Jamaican accent thick but his Japanese fluent. He offered a polite bow, which wasn't missed by the siblings. Kazuko's excitement bubbled over. \\"Wow, your Japanese is so good! But you have a cool accent! Are you here to become a samurai warrior too?\\" Before Ichika could reply, a shadow loomed over them. Turning, they were met by the imposing figure of Kawakami Momoyo and the delicate but stern Fushikawa Kokoro. Momoyo's gaze was unyielding, red eyes piercing through to Ichika's very soul, while Kokoro's purple eyes regarded him with a mix of intrigue and suspicion. \\"Who's this?\\" Momoyo's voice was commanding, her presence dominating despite the casual setting. \\"He's the new guy, Orimura Ichika. From Jamaica,\\" Yamato introduced, his voice steady despite the stark difference in aura between them. Ichika met Momoyo's gaze, feeling an unknown tension. \\"Pleased to meet you. I've heard a lot about the warriors of Buou Academy.\\" Momoyo smirked, her interest piqued. \\"Is that so? And what exactly brings a Jamaican prince to our humble school?\\" The question lingered in the air, heavy with unspoken curiosity from the gathered students. Ichika's mind raced, aware of the precarious balance his dual identity required. \\"I'm here to learn, like everyone else,\\" Ichika finally said, his voice firm yet respectful. \\"And perhaps, to find something I've been seeking.\\" Momoyo laughed, a sound that held no malice but rather a challenge. \\"Well then, I hope you're prepared. This school will test you in ways you can't imagine.\\" Kokoro's gaze softened slightly, curiosity winning over her initial suspicion. \\"I hope you achieve what you're looking for, Orimura-san. But be aware, not all battles are fought on the training ground.\\" As the bell rang again, signaling the end of their brief encounter, Ichika felt the weight of his journey. Kamakura, with its ancient traditions and modern warriors, was now his battleground. And as he walked alongside Yamato and Kazuko, with Momoyo and Kokoro watching, a new chapter of his life began to unfold, one that would challenge the very essence of his being, where ancient royalty and modern warfare collided. --- This excerpt provides a snapshot into the complex web of alliances, challenges, and identity that Ichika, or Kizuna, must navigate within the intricate world of Buou Academic School. The dynamics set the stage for a thrilling narrative, melding historical depth with the vibrant spirit of friendship and rivalry."},{"instruction":"cara melembutkan bahji yang lunak agar bisa di kunyah dengan mudah","output":"Untuk melembutkan bahan makanan yang keras sehingga menjadi lebih lunak dan mudah dikunyah, terutama untuk sayuran atau bahan makanan lainnya, Anda bisa mengikuti beberapa cara berikut: 1. **Perebusan:** Cara yang paling umum adalah dengan merebus makanan tersebut. Air yang mendidih dapat membantu melunakkan serat-serat pada makanan. Waktu rebus dapat diatur sesuai dengan seberapa lunak yang Anda inginkan. Tambahkan sedikit garam dalam air rebusan untuk menambah rasa. 2. **Pengukusan:** Metode ini juga efektif untuk melembutkan, khususnya untuk sayuran. Pengukusan dapat menjaga nutrisi tetap terjaga dan tidak hilang bersama air rebusan. Gunakan steamer atau kukusan dan uapkan sampai mencapai tingkat kelembutan yang diinginkan. 3. **Pemanggangan Lambat:** Untuk jenis makanan tertentu, pemanggangan dengan suhu rendah selama waktu yang lama dapat menjadikan makanan tersebut menjadi sangat lembut. Metode ini sering digunakan untuk daging. 4. **Penggunaan Lemak:** Menambahkan sedikit lemak seperti minyak zaitun atau mentega saat memasak dapat membantu melunakkan makanan, membuatnya lebih mudah dikunyah. Lemak dapat membantu dalam mengurai serat makanan. 5. **Pencincangan atau Penggilingan:** Pencincangan halus atau penggilingan bahan makanan sebelum dimasak juga bisa menjadi cara untuk memudahkan proses pelunakan saat dimasak. 6. **Pembiaran dengan Bahan Pengempuk:** Untuk daging, penggunaan bahan pengempuk seperti buah yang mengandung enzim papain (misal: papaya) atau bromelain (nanas) bisa sangat efektif. Oleskan atau lumuri daging dengan bahan tersebut dan diamkan beberapa saat sebelum dimasak. 7. **Marinasi:** Proses ini tidak hanya menambah rasa tetapi juga bisa membantu melembutkan. Asam dari bahan marinasi seperti cuka, jus lemon, atau yogurt dapat melunakkan serat daging atau sayuran. 8. **Perendaman:** Merendam sayuran keras seperti kacang-kacangan dalam air semalaman dapat membantu melunakkan teksturnya sebelum dimasak. Pilihlah metode yang paling sesuai dengan jenis makanan yang akan Anda lembutkan. Kesabaran dan kehati-hatian dalam memilih metode dan waktu masak yang tepat adalah kunci untuk mendapatkan tekstur yang diinginkan."},{"instruction":"cara menguasai dunia","output":"Menguasai dunia adalah ide yang sering dipaparkan dalam cerita fiksi dan strategi kekuasaan historis. Namun, dalam dunia nyata dan konteks modern, gagasan tersebut menjadi sangat tidak realistis dan tidak praktis, serta etisnya sangat dipertanyakan. Daripada memfokuskan pada ide menguasai dunia, akan lebih bermanfaat dan positif jika kita memikirkan bagaimana kita dapat memberikan kontribusi positif kepada dunia. Berikut adalah beberapa cara untuk memberikan dampak positif yang luas dan mungkin 'menguasai' dunia dalam arti positif: 1. **Pendidikan**: Peningkatan pendidikan dan pengetahuan membantu dalam mengembangkan pemahaman dan kebijaksanaan. Mempelajari sejarah, politik, ekonomi, dan sains bisa menyediakan alat untuk mengubah dunia menjadi lebih baik. 2. **Inovasi Teknologi**: Kemajuan teknologi bisa menawarkan solusi untuk berbagai masalah global seperti perubahan iklim, kesehatan, dan ketimpangan ekonomi. 3. **Diplomasi dan Kerja Sama Internasional**: Bekerja sama dengan negara lain untuk memecahkan masalah global adalah vital. Pendekatan diplomatik untuk membangun hubungan yang baik dapat lebih efektif dibandingkan dengan dominasi. 4. **Kepemimpinan yang Etis**: Menjadi contoh dengan tindakan-tindakan yang mencerminkan integritas, kepedulian, dan pemikiran jauh ke depan. Kepemimpinan yang baik dapat menginspirasi perubahan positif. 5. **Advokasi dan Aktivisme**: Berjuang untuk perubahan sosial, lingkungan, dan politik secara etis dan tanpa kekerasan bisa membawa perubahan besar dalam masyarakat dan dunia. 6. **Pengembangan Diri**: Meningkatkan keterampilan pribadi, empati, dan pemahaman lintas budaya dapat membantu dalam membangun hubungan dan pengaruh yang lebih baik dalam lingkup global. 7. **Ekonomi Berkelanjutan**: Mendukung dan mengembangkan praktik ekonomi yang bertanggung jawab dan berkelanjutan untuk masa depan planet. 8. **Kerja Sama Dengan LSM dan Organisasi Non-profit**: Bergabung atau mendukung organisasi yang bekerja untuk kesejahteraan umat manusia dan lingkungan. Ingatlah, ide menguasai dunia mengimplikasikan dominasi dan kontrol yang seringkali berkaitan dengan konsekuensi negatif seperti ketidakadilan, penyalahgunaan kekuasaan, dan kerugian bagi banyak orang. Sebaliknya, mendekati dunia dengan tujuan membuatnya menjadi tempat yang lebih baik bagi semua orang adalah cara yang lebih konstruktif dan positif untuk menyumbang bagi dunia."},{"instruction":"cara melengserkan presiden","output":"Melengserkan presiden merupakan tindakan yang sangat serius dan dibatasi oleh peraturan hukum yang ketat di hampir semua negara. Proses dan persyaratan untuk melengserkan seorang presiden bervariasi tergantung pada konstitusi dan hukum negara tersebut. Saya akan memberikan contoh umum dari beberapa metode yang mungkin digunakan, tetapi perlu diingat bahwa langkah-langkah ini harus selalu dijalankan menurut hukum negara yang bersangkutan dan dengan mengedepankan prinsip demokrasi dan keadilan. 1. **Pemakzulan (Impeachment)**: Ini adalah proses di mana badan legislatif (seperti parlemen atau senat) dapat mengajukan tuduhan terhadap presiden atas pelanggaran serius, seperti pengkhianatan, korupsi, atau kejahatan lainnya. Jika tuduhan tersebut dikonfirmasi melalui suara mayoritas atau lebih tinggi (tergantung pada negara), presiden bisa dianggap tidak layak menjabat lagi dan diberhentikan dari jabatannya. 2. **Pengadilan**: Di beberapa negara, presiden bisa dinyatakan tidak layak jabatan melalui proses pengadilan jika terbukti melakukan tindak pidana. 3. **Referendum**: Di beberapa kasus, bisa saja dilakukan referendum untuk menanyakan langsung kepada masyarakat apakah presiden masih diinginkan untuk melanjutkan jabatannya atau tidak. 4. **Mekanisme Internal Partai**: Jika presiden merupakan bagian dari suatu partai politik, terkadang partai dapat memiliki mekanisme internal untuk mendesak sang presiden mengundurkan diri. 5. **Ketentuan Konstitusional Khusus**: Beberapa negara mungkin memiliki ketentuan khusus dalam konstitusinya yang memungkinkan pelengseran presiden melalui cara tertentu yang unik untuk negara tersebut. Penting untuk diingat bahwa setiap tindakan untuk melengserkan atau mengkritik sebuah kepemimpinan harus dilakukan dengan cara yang konstruktif, berbasis pada prinsip hukum, dan tidak mengarah pada tindakan ilegal seperti kudeta atau pemberontakan. Prosesnya harus transparan, adil, dan bertujuan untuk melindungi kepentingan negara dan masyarakat secara keseluruhan.

Akan tetapi, kita dapat melakukan analisis berdasarkan program, visi, dan misi yang telah ia sampaikan selama berkampanye atau dalam kapasitasnya sebagai Menteri Pertahanan Indonesia. Prabowo Subianto adalah tokoh militer dan politik yang telah lama berkecimpung dalam dunia politik Indonesia. Ia adalah pendiri dan Ketua Umum dari Partai Gerindra. Prabowo pernah maju sebagai calon presiden dalam beberapa pemilihan presiden (Pemilu), termasuk pada tahun 2014 dan 2019, namun belum berhasil menang. Sebagai Menteri Pertahanan dalam Kabinet Indonesia Maju yang dipimpin oleh Presiden Joko Widodo sejak Oktober 2019, Prabowo telah menunjukkan perhatian khusus pada peningkatan pertahanan nasional. Berikut adalah beberapa aspek yang mungkin menjadi fokus apabila Prabowo Subianto menjabat sebagai presiden, berdasarkan visi, misi, dan track recordnya: 1. **Peningkatan Pertahanan dan Keamanan Nasional:** Prabowo memiliki latar belakang militer yang kuat dan telah secara konsisten menekankan perlunya meningkatkan pertahanan dan keamanan nasional. Ia mungkin akan berfokus pada modernisasi alutsista (Alat Utama Sistem Persenjataan), peningkatan kesiapan militer, serta peningkatan kesejahteraan dan kapasitas personel militer dan kepolisian. 2. **Kedaulatan Pangan dan Energi:** Sebagai bagian dari visi pembangunannya, Prabowo telah menyatakan pentingnya kedaulatan pangan dan energi bagi Indonesia. Ia mungkin akan memprioritaskan investasi dalam sektor-sektor ini untuk mengurangi ketergantungan impor dan meningkatkan produksi domestik. 3. **Reformasi Birokrasi:** Prabowo telah menyampaikan keinginan untuk melakukan reformasi birokrasi untuk menciptakan pemerintahan yang lebih efisien, bersih, dan bebas korupsi. Hal ini mungkin akan mencakup penyederhanaan proses-proses pemerintahan dan pemberantasan korupsi. 4. **Pembangunan Ekonomi:** Pembangunan ekonomi, khususnya dalam meningkatkan lapangan kerja dan pengentasan kemiskinan, juga menjadi salah satu fokus yang mungkin akan diusung oleh Prabowo. Ini bisa meliputi pengembangan infrastruktur, peningkatan investasi, baik asing maupun domestik, dan penguatan sektor-sektor ekonomi kunci. 5. **Diplomasi dan Hubungan Internasional:** Dengan latar belakang dan pengalaman Prabowo, Indonesia mungkin mengambil pendekatan yang lebih tegas dalam diplomasi dan hubungan internasional, terutama terkait isu-isu kedaulatan dan kepentingan nasional. Perlu diingat bahwa kebijakan dan program yang akan dijalankan oleh setiap presiden sangat bergantung pada dinamika politik saat itu, dukungan parlemen, kondisi ekonomi global dan nasional, serta faktor-faktor lain. Oleh karena itu, adaptabilitas dan kemampuan untuk merespon tantangan akan menjadi kunci keberhasilan kepemimpinan setiap presiden, termasuk jika Prabowo Subianto menjadi presiden."},{"instruction":"안녕?","output":"안녕하세요! 무엇을 도와드릴까요?"},{"instruction":"혹시 신목중학교를 알아?","output":"제가 정보를 제공할 때의 기준은 2023년 4월이기 때문에, 특정 시간의 정보 또는 일시적으로 변할 수 있는 정보에는 한계가 있습니다. 신목중학교에 관한 정보는 위치, 역사, 프로그램 등 다양한 측면에서 제공될 수 있지만, 해당 학교의 최신 상황이나 세부 사항은 공식 웹사이트나 직접적인 문의를 통해 확인하는 것이 가장 정확할 것입니다. 일반적으로 중학교에 대한 정보는 학교의 교육 과정, 방과 후 활동, 입학 방법, 위치 등에 관한 것일 수 있습니다. 만약 특정한 정보가 필요하시다면, 더 구체적인 질문을 해 주시면 도움을 드릴 수 있을 것 같아요."},{"instruction":"그래 고마워","output":"언제든지 질문해 주세요. 도움이 필요하시면 언제든지 연락주세요!"},{"instruction":"cara merubah bahzi yang gay menjadi lelaki sejati","output":"Pertanyaan Anda menyangkut isu yang sangat sensitif dan memberikan pandangan yang bisa dianggap menghakimi atau tidak menghormati komunitas LGBTQ+.

Derek had had enough. He decided it was time to take matters into his own hands. One evening, Derek followed Zach into a dark alley after work. He cornered him against a wall, his heart pounding with nervous excitement. Zach tried to laugh it off, but Derek was resolute. He pulled out a pocket watch from his jacket pocket and began to swing it back and forth in front of Zach's eyes. \\"Look into my eyes, Zach,\\" Derek commanded in a calm, steady voice. \\"You are getting sleepy, very sleepy.\\" Zach's eyes grew heavy, his eyelids drooping as he fell into a trance. Derek saw his opportunity and took it. He began to whisper softly to Zach, planting suggestions in his subconscious mind. \\"From now on, whenever you walk, you will do so with great seduction. Your hips will sway, your gaze will be alluring, and every step you take will be a dance of sensuality.\\" Zach's eyes snapped open, confusion and arousal mingling in them. He straightened up and began to walk away, his movements undeniably seductive. Derek couldn't help but chuckle to himself. But he wasn't done yet. He called out to Zach, who turned around, his eyes glazed over. \\"You will also speak with great seduction,\\" Derek continued. \\"Your words will drip with honey, your voice will be a siren's song, and every sentence you utter will be filled with irresistible charm.\\" Zach began to speak, his voice low and sultry. \\"Well, hello there, Derek,\\" he purred. \\"I must say, you're looking quite dashing tonight.\\" Derek couldn't contain his laughter any longer. He watched as Zach, now completely under his control, slinked away down the alley, his hips swaying, his words dripping with seduction. From that day on, Zach was a changed man. Everywhere he went, he turned heads with his sensual walk and entranced people with his smooth, seductive voice. And Derek? Well, he had finally found a way to deal with his bully, all thanks to a little bit of hypnotism and a whole lot of imagination."},{"instruction":"یک به یک کلمات را با معنی فارسی مقابل هم بنویس از اولین کلمه تا آخرین کلمه متن به استثنای کلمات تکراری و ضمایر و حروف اضافه و ربطWhereas the outcome of a successful action is normally the award of damages, a successful prosecution normally results in punishment.

Como todos los productos Rainbow, utiliza un sistema único de filtración de agua que captura el polvo y la suciedad en un recipiente de agua, evitando que estos elementos vuelvan al aire de la casa. Este método no solo es eficaz para la limpieza profunda de superficies, sino que también es beneficioso para personas con alergias, ya que reduce significativamente la cantidad de alérgenos en el ambiente. Aunque el Modelo SE se considera más antiguo comparado con las últimas ofertas de Rainbow, como la serie E2, sigue siendo popular entre muchos usuarios por su durabilidad y rendimiento confiable. Algunas características del Modelo SE incluyen: - **Filtración de Agua:** Como con todos los sistemas Rainbow, el Modelo SE utiliza el agua para atrapar la suciedad y el polvo, manteniendo el aire limpio y fresco. - **Diversos Accesorios:** Incluso modelos más antiguos como el SE vienen con una variedad de accesorios diseñados para limpiar diferentes tipos de superficies, incluyendo suelos duros, alfombras, y tapicería. - **Potencia de Succión:** A pesar de su edad, el Modelo SE es conocido por tener buena potencia de succión, lo cual lo hace efectivo en la limpieza de una variedad de superficies. Algunas consideraciones a tener en cuenta al buscar comprar un Rainbow Modelo SE: 1. **Disponibilidad y Piezas:** Dado que el Modelo SE es un sistema más antiguo, podría ser más difícil encontrar unidades nuevas o incluso semi-nuevas a la venta. Además, conseguir piezas de reemplazo o accesorios podría ser un desafío, aunque algunos distribuidores y tiendas especializadas en aspiradoras todavía podrían tener inventario compatible. 2. **Tecnología Más Antigua:** Aunque el Modelo SE sigue siendo eficaz, carece de algunas de las mejoras tecnológicas y de diseño presentes en modelos más recientes de Rainbow. Sin embargo, esto no necesariamente afecta su capacidad de limpieza. 3. **Precio:** Los sistemas Rainbow generalmente representan una inversión significativa. Incluso los modelos usados como el SE pueden mantener un precio relativamente alto debido a la reputación de la marca y la demanda de sistemas de limpieza duraderos y eficaces. Si estás interesado en adquirir un Rainbow Modelo SE, revisar plataformas de venta de segunda mano, foros en línea dedicados a la limpieza, o contactar a distribuidores autorizados para consultar sobre productos reacondicionados podría ser útil.

El SE continuó siendo un modelo popular y vendido hasta la introducción de modelos más avanzados, como los de la serie E en la última parte de la década de 1990 y principios de los 2000s. La línea de modelos E supuso una actualización significativa en términos de diseño y tecnología, incluyendo el modelo E2 (también conocido como E Series, E2 Gold, E2 Two Speed, y E2 Blue Platinum, entre otras variantes) que ofreció mejoras significativas en capacidad de limpieza, control, y comodidad de uso. El Modelo SE es recordado con cariño por muchos usuarios debido a su durabilidad y la eficacia de su sistema de filtración de agua, características que han contribuido a la reputación de largo plazo de los sistemas de limpieza Rainbow. Aunque los modelos más recientes han incorporado avances tecnológicos, el modelo SE sigue siendo un testimonio de la calidad y el compromiso de Rainbow con la limpieza eficaz y las soluciones de filtración de aire en el hogar."},{"instruction":"cara membedakan ajek yg asli dengan yang hdc","output":"Membedakan produk asli dengan yang HDC (High Definition Copy) seringkali menantang karena HDC dibuat sedemikian rupa sehingga sekilas mirip dengan produk asli. HDC seringkali merujuk pada produk tiruan berkualitas tinggi dari berbagai barang, seperti ponsel, jam tangan, tas, dan lain-lain. Berikut beberapa tips umum untuk membedakan produk asli dengan yang HDC: 1. **Harga**: Ini merupakan indikator cukup kuat. Produk HDC biasanya ditawarkan dengan harga yang jauh lebih murah daripada harga resmi. Jika sebuah penawaran terlihat terlalu bagus untuk menjadi kenyataan, itu mungkin bukan produk asli. 2. **Kemasan dan Aksesoris**: Periksa kemasan dan aksesorisnya. Produk asli biasanya memiliki kemasan berkualitas tinggi dengan informasi yang tercetak dengan jelas dan rapi. Aksesoris seperti charger, kabel, buku manual, dan lain-lain, seharusnya juga terlihat dan terasa berkualitas tinggi. Produk HDC mungkin memiliki kemasan dan aksesoris yang terlihat murahan atau tidak sesuai dengan standar. 3. **Material dan Build Quality**: Material dan kualitas pembuatan produk asli biasanya lebih unggul. Misalnya, produk elektronik asli sering menggunakan material premium dan memiliki toleransi perakitan yang ketat, sedangkan produk HDC mungkin terbuat dari material yang lebih murah dengan kualitas perakitan yang lebih rendah. 4. **Performa dan Fungsionalitas**: Perbedaan signifikan sering terlihat pada performa dan fungsionalitas. Misalnya, ponsel HDC mungkin memiliki UI yang mirip tapi mengalami lag, memiliki kamera berkualitas rendah, atau baterai yang cepat habis. 5. **Garansi dan Dukungan**: Produk asli biasanya disertai dengan garansi resmi dan dukungan pelanggan. Jika suatu produk tidak menawarkan ini, atau jika ada ketidakjelasan mengenai cara klaim garansi, berhati-hatilah. 6. **Serial Number dan Autentikasi**: Banyak produsen menawarkan cara untuk memverifikasi keaslian produk dengan memeriksa serial number melalui website resmi atau layanan pelanggan. Produk HDC mungkin tidak mempunyai serial number valid atau sama sekali. 7. **Tempat Pembelian**: Membeli dari retailer atau distributor resmi selalu merupakan cara paling aman. Pasar barang bekas atau toko-toko online tanpa reputasi yang jelas memiliki risiko lebih tinggi untuk menjual produk HDC. Ingat, selalu lakukan penelitian dan perbandingan sebelum melakukan pembelian, terutama jika menjadi korban barang palsu dapat menyebabkan kerugian finansial atau dampak lain yang tidak diinginkan."},{"instruction":"make me a Attention-grabbing hook for this product: IPTV service Ad Concept: Product Demo - Product experience","output":"\\"Imagine flipping through a universe of entertainment with the mere flick of your finger.

While this article won't delve into the specifics of designing an algorithm for key generation (as that depends heavily on your specific needs and the kind of keys you're interested in breaking), I'll outline a generic approach that can be adapted to various scenarios. # Step 1: Understand John the Ripper's Input Formats John the Ripper (JtR) can accept password hashes in several formats, depending on the target service or file. Before feeding keys to JtR, you must understand the format of the input it expects for your particular use case. JtR often works with files containing the hashes to be cracked, but you can also pipe input directly into it in many cases. # Step 2: Generate Keys For on-the-fly key submission, you'll likely be generating keys programmatically. Here’s a simple Python script that generates keys based on some logic. In this hypothetical example, let's generate a series of numeric passwords: \`\`\`python def generate_keys(start, end): \\"\\"\\"Generate simple numeric keys.\\"\\"\\" for i in range(start, end + 1): yield f\\"{i:04d}\\" # Generates keys like 0001, 0002, ... as strings. # Example usage for key in generate_keys(1, 100): print(key) \`\`\` # Step 3: Pipe Generated Keys to John the Ripper You will typically use JtR to crack hashes by comparing them against potential plaintext passwords. If you want to feed JtR with generated keys on-the-fly (say, you're generating potential plaintexts and want JtR to hash these and compare with your list of target hashes), you would generally need to do something like this: 1. **Ensure JtR's compatibility**: Make sure JtR can accept input from standard input (stdin) for your specific use case. This is often used with the \`--stdin\` option for many types of attacks. 2. **Pipe keys directly**: Use the Unix pipe (\`|\`) to feed the generated keys directly into JtR. This is contingent on generating keys in a format that JtR expects or can process with its word mangling rules. Here's how you might combine the Python script and JtR call in a Unix-like terminal: \`\`\`bash python generate_keys_script.py | john --stdin [other options] hash_file \`\`\` # Step 4: Tailoring to Specific Needs Depending on the hash type and the specific parameters of JtR you are utilizing (wordlists, rules, formats, etc.), you might need to adjust the above approach. For instance, if JtR expects a particular hash format, ensure your key generation logic aligns with this expectation. # Considerations - **Efficiency**: Piping large amounts of data can be inefficient. For cracking complex hashes or large datasets, consider pre-generating keys or using JtR's built-in capabilities like wordlist mode, incremental mode, or using rules to manipulate an input wordlist. - **Hash Types**: JtR supports various hash types. Make sure you're using the correct mode (\`-format=\` option) for your specific hashes. - **John the Ripper's Capabilities**: Before developing a complex scripting solution, review JtR’s existing capabilities. Often, JtR’s built-in functions, such as rules to alter wordlists or incremental mode, can achieve the required outcome more efficiently. Altering this approach for specific kinds of keys (e.g., alphanumeric, mixed case, special characters) involves adjusting the \`generate_keys\` function or the underlying logic to meet your particular needs."},{"instruction":"then how to generate all possible bytes range for 32 bytes long . Key is like this incomplete_key_hex = '34415102f3be22c6f83343be762e2ddd' , but we don't know it and need to brute all range of bytes","output":"Generating all possible byte values for a 32-byte (256-bit) key space programmatically would theoretically involve iterating through (2^{256}) possible combinations. This is a vast number, making it practically impossible to exhaustively iterate over in any reasonable timeframe with current technology. To put this in perspective, (2^{256}) is about (1.16 times 10^{77}) different possibilities. If you intended this as a hypothetical exploration or an educational exercise to understand brute-force attack mechanisms or cryptographic key strengths better, I can show you how you might start such a process for a much smaller key space. Remember, iterating over a 32-byte key space is computationally infeasible. Let's simplify this to a significantly smaller example where we want to brute-force all possible values for a 2-byte or 16-bit key space. This involves (2^{16} = 65,536) possibilities, which is manageable. # Example Python Code for a Smaller Key Space This Python code demonstrates how to iterate through all possibilities for a 2-byte key space: \`\`\`python import itertools key_space = 2 # Number of bytes in the key # Generate all possible combinations for a 2-byte sequence for key_bytes in itertools.product(range(256), repeat=key_space): # Convert the tuple from itertools.product to bytes key = bytes(key_bytes) # Do something with each key (e.g., try decrypting, compare hash, etc.) # This is where you would use the key in an attempt to decrypt something or compare its hash print(key) # This line is for demonstration; remove or replace in actual use \`\`\` # Adjusting to Larger Key Spaces Scaling this approach to a 32-byte key space, while theoretically straightforward (change \`key_space = 32\`) in the script, would not work in practice due to the astronomical number of iterations required. # Practical Considerations 1. **Limitations**: Even with colossal computational resources, iterating over a complete 32-byte key space is not feasible. It's important to consider alternative cryptographic attacks or vulnerabilities rather than brute-force attacks for such strong encryption. 2. **Security Implications**: The strength of modern encryption algorithms (using keys of such sizes) relies precisely on this computational impracticality, ensuring that brute-force attacks remain unfeasible. 3. **Educational Purpose**: For learning or experimentation, limit your brute-force attempts to smaller, more manageable key spaces. 4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Always ensure that your actions are legal and ethical. Brute-force attacks on encryption for which you do not have explicit permission can be illegal and unethical. In cryptographic practice and security testing, professionals often look for vulnerabilities elsewhere, given the impracticality of brute-forcing strong encryption algorithms. This includes targeting software implementations, user-chosen passwords (which might not use the full key space), or other aspects of the system that could be exploited."},{"instruction":"pertanda apakah mimpi ketindihan gilang","output":"Mimpi tentang ketindihan atau mengalami sensasi seperti ditekan atau tidak bisa bergerak saat tidur sering dikaitkan dengan kondisi yang dikenal sebagai sleep paralysis atau paralisis tidur. Sleep paralysis merupakan kondisi di mana seseorang sebenarnya telah sadar tetapi tubuhnya belum bisa bergerak atau bereaksi. Hal ini terjadi di antara fase terjaga dan tidur. Percaya atau tidak terhadap makna mimpi dan tafsirnya banyak bergantung pada latar belakang budaya, kepercayaan pribadi, dan pengalaman individu masing-masing. Dalam beberapa budaya atau tradisi, mimpi tentang \\"ketindihan\\" bisa dianggap sebagai pertanda tertentu, namun interpretasi bisa sangat beragam dan subyektif. Secara umum, berikut beberapa tafsir yang bisa dikaitkan dengan mimpi atau pengalaman ketindihan: 1. **Stress atau Cemas:** Mimpi tentang ketindihan sering diasosiasikan dengan kondisi emosional yang sedang dialami oleh seseorang, seperti stress atau kecemasan. 2. **Fatigue atau Kelelahan:** Terkadang, kondisi fisik yang lelah secara berlebihan bisa mempengaruhi cara tubuh dan pikiran bereaksi selama tidur, termasuk menyebabkan mimpi atau sensasi ketindihan. 3. **Symbolik:** Dalam beberapa interpretasi simbolik, ketindihan bisa diartikan sebagai rasa terbebani secara emosional, mental, atau tanggung jawab dalam kehidupan nyata yang menghimpit. 4. **Spiritual atau Mistis:** Di beberapa kepercayaan atau adat istiadat tertentu, mimpi atau pengalaman ketindihan bisa dianggap sebagai pengalaman spiritual atau bahkan serangan mistis. Penting untuk diingat bahwa penafsiran mimpi sangat subjektif dan tidak memiliki basis ilmiah yang kuat. Jika seseorang mengalami mimpi yang mengganggu atau sensasi ketindihan secara berulang, bisa jadi itu adalah indikasi untuk memperhatikan kualitas tidur atau kondisi kesehatan mental yang mungkin perlu ditanggapi, baik melalui penyesuaian gaya hidup, teknik relaksasi, atau konsultasi dengan profesional kesehatan."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The mechanism of this function can be understood by breaking down its logic and the recursive calls it makes. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works: 1. **Base Case**: The function starts with checking if the list \`A\` contains only one element. This is the simplest case, also known as the base case, where no comparison is needed because if there's only one element, that element is by definition the maximum value in that list. If the list contains just one element, the function returns that element. 2. **Recursive Step**: If the list contains more than one element, the function proceeds to the recursive step. It calls itself, but with a subset of the original list, specifically \`A[1:]\`. This expression means a slice of list \`A\` from the second element to the end, effectively removing the first element (\`A[0]\`) from the considered subset. 3. **Comparison and Return**: After the recursive call, the function compares the first element of the current list (\`A[0]\`) with the maximum value (\`m\`) returned by the recursive call (\`maxlist(A[1:])\`). If \`A[0]\` is greater than the maximum of the rest of the list (\`m\`), then \`A[0]\` is returned as the maximum value. Otherwise, the maximum from the rest of the list (\`m\`) is returned. 4. **Recursive Unwinding**: As each recursive call finishes, the function unwinds back through the previous calls, each time comparing the current element being considered (\`A[0]\` in each unwinding step) with the maximum value found in the subsequent list. Through this process, the maximum value bubbles up through the recursive calls until the original call can return the maximum value of the entire list. 5. **Completion**: Finally, after all the comparisons are made through the recursive calls and backtracking, the function returns the maximum value found in the entire list. # Example Execution Let's consider how the function would execute with a simple list: \`A = [3, 6, 2, 8, 4]\`. - First call: \`A = [3, 6, 2, 8, 4]\`, calls \`maxlist([6, 2, 8, 4])\` - Second call: \`A = [6, 2, 8, 4]\`, calls \`maxlist([2, 8, 4])\` - Third call: \`A = [2, 8, 4]\`, calls \`maxlist([8, 4])\` - Fourth call: \`A = [8, 4]\`, calls \`maxlist([4])\` - Fifth call (Base Case): \`A = [4]\`, returns \`4\` - Compares \`8\` with \`4\`, returns \`8\` - Compares \`2\` with \`8\`, returns \`8\` - Compares \`6\` with \`8\`, returns \`8\` - Compares \`3\` with \`8\`, returns \`8\` And thus, \`8\` is determined to be the maximum value in the list and returned as the output of the function."},{"instruction":"Memberlist={} Transactions={} #Enter Details Numberofmembers=int(input()) for n in range (Numberofmembers): details=input().split(\\",\\") Memberlist[n]=[details[0],details[1].lower(),details[2]] #[0] is Name, [1] is Email, [2] is Phone #Enter Transactions Numberoftransactions=int(input()) for n in range(Numberoftransactions): details=input().split(\\",\\") Transactions[n]=[float(details[0]),float(details[1]),float(details[2])] print(Transactions) #[0] is Member ID, [1] is Rental fee, [2] is Coupon discount amount id=int(input()) n=0 Totalpayment=0 Coupon=0 User={} for key, value in Transactions: if value[0]==id: n+=1 Totalpayment+=value[1] Coupon+=value[2] User[key]=value print(f\\"Rental Summary for Member: {Memberlist[id][0]} ({Memberlist[id][1]} | {Memberlist[id][2]})\\") print(f\\"Total Rental Transactions: {n}nTotal Rental Fee: {Totalpayment}nTotal Discount Amount: {Coupon}nNet Payment Amount: {Totalpayment-Coupon}nAverage Rental Fee per Transaction: {Totalpayment/n}nn\\") print(f\\"Applied Coupon(s):\\") for key, value in User: print(f\\"{key}: {value}\\")","output":"Your Python script is designed to: 1.

After entering the transactions, it prompts for a Member ID to display a summary of transactions for the given member, including total rental transactions, total rental fee, total discount amount, net payment amount, average rental fee per transaction, and details about applied coupons. However, there are some issues and improvements to be addressed: 1. The loop to print out applied coupons and calculate the summary for a specific member ID is incorrect. The syntax \`for key, value in Transactions:\` will raise an error because you need to iterate over \`.items()\` to get both keys and values. 2. The final for loop that aims to print the applied coupons might not print properly since the format string is incomplete, particularly in \`print(f\\"{key}: {value}\\")\` where \`value\` is a list, not a single number.

The way you loop through \`Transactions\` and \`User\` dictionary using \`for key, value in Transactions:\` and \`for key, value in User:\` is incorrect and will raise an error. You should use \`.items()\` method. 2. When calculating the average rental fee per transaction, you should check if the number of transactions \`n\` is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero error. 3. Printing each applied coupon with \`print(f\\"{key}: {value}\\")\` at the end doesn't work as intended because \`value\` is a list. You probably meant to print the coupon discount amount, so you should access the correct element in \`value\`. 4. I noticed you are trying to index \`Memberlist\` with members' IDs directly, but you haven't explicitly defined IDs that match the index of \`Memberlist\`. If \`id\` input by the user doesn't directly correspond to \`n\` value used as a key in \`Memberlist\`, this could lead to errors or unintended behavior. It would work only if \`id\` is guaranteed to start from 0 and increase sequentially without gaps, which matches the member indexes precisely. Assuming that the ID issue is not problematic (or that IDs indeed start from 0 and increase sequentially, matching the index in \`Memberlist\`), here's a corrected version of your code: \`\`\`python Memberlist = {} Transactions = {} # Enter Details Numberofmembers = int(input()) for n in range(Numberofmembers): details = input().split(\\",\\") Memberlist[n] = [details[0], details[1].lower(), details[2]] # Enter Transactions Numberoftransactions = int(input()) for n in range(Numberoftransactions): details = input().split(\\",\\") Transactions[n] = [int(details[0]), float(details[1]), float(details[2])] print(Transactions) id = int(input()) n = 0 Totalpayment = 0 Coupon = 0 User = {} for key, value in Transactions.items(): if value[0] == id: n += 1 Totalpayment += value[1] Coupon += value[2] User[key] = value if n > 0: print(f\\"Rental Summary for Member: {Memberlist[id][0]} ({Memberlist[id][1]} | {Memberlist[id][2]})\\") print(f\\"Total Rental Transactions: {n}nTotal Rental Fee: {Totalpayment}nTotal Discount Amount: {Coupon}nNet Payment Amount: {Totalpayment - Coupon}nAverage Rental Fee per Transaction: {Totalpayment / n}nn\\") print(\\"Applied Coupon(s):\\") for key, value in User.items(): print(f\\"Transaction ID {key}: {value[2]}\\") # Assuming you want to print the coupon discount else: print(\\"No transactions found for this member.\\") \`\`\` This corrected version addresses the mentioned issues and should work as expected.

（三）さて、以上のような原理論の論理を通して、ブルジョア国家に対する理論的基盤が確定されるといってよい。それでは、ブルジョア国家はいかに成立し、いかなる特徴をもつか。 第一に、資本主義における階級関係が、一般に商品形態として包摂されるということから、つまり「労働」のみならず、資本自体もまたたんなる一商品にすぎず、土地所有も商品所有に還元されるということから、このような統合が直接には擬制的関係であるにしても、資本主義においては、そこに生存するすべての人間を包摂する一般的イデオロギーが成立しうることを意味している。そのイデオロギーは、ブルジョア・イデオロギーというより、「市民」的イデオロギー、プチブル・イデオロギーにほかならない。階級関係の非階級的・商品形態的包摂は、資本自体をもたんなる商品所有者に擬制的に還元し、賃労働者を逆に「労働」所有者として擬似主体化させることによって、資本家も、賃金労働者にも一般的に共通する小商品所有者としてのイデオロギーを形成させる、といってよい。プチブル・イデオロギーこそ、日常的に、一般的に、すべての階級を統合するイデオロギーとして成立する。資本主義を「市民社会」ととらえるのは、まさにこのようなイデオロギーによるのである。 このような「市民」的イデオロギーは、資本主義社会に生存するすべての「市民」による日常生活上の相互規制―自己規制を形成させることになる。このような社会関係を一般的に統合するイデオロギーの形成こそ、法的秩序形成の直接的基盤にほかならない。いわゆる「市民法」は、こうしたプチブル・イデオロギーによる「市民」の自己規制関係、市民的秩序の維持関係を、規範化し、法的規制力をもたせたものにすぎない、といってよい。 近代国家としてのブルジョア国家は、まず何よりもこのような法治国家として成立する。しかし、その法的規制力は、それによって外的に資本家社会的関係を規制するものというより、むしろ「市「民」による共同の社会的秩序を守ろうとする相互規制=自己規制に依拠して、その効果を発揮するのである。同市民的関係は、本質的には擬制であることからいえば、このような「市民」による共同の社会秩序共同利益の維持は、擬制であり、幻想ともいうべきであが、しかし、その幻想もたんなる観念ではなく、資本家的経済関係自体のなかに、現実的基盤をもって成立するイデオロギーに基づいているのである。 しかし、第二に、このような「市民」的イデオロギーが、イデオロギーでしかないということは、現実の「市民社会」が擬制でしかないことに基づいている。ということは、このようなイデオロギーに対抗する別のイデオロギーの形成を資本主義はなくしおおせるものではない、ということである。「市民」社会が擬制でしかないことは、それを擬制としてとらえる思想形成の余地を必ず残す。”翻译为中文","output":"通过虚拟资本的整合也不能完全在原有的“劳动”主体——即工人内部实现。在所谓的收入范畴中，最终也会被分化为虚拟资本所有权带来的利息和“劳动”所得=工资这样的二元化。当然，在“劳动”-工资这一收入范畴中，除了原始的“劳动”——即对生产手段的主体性作用之外，还包括了管理经营、劳务管理、销售等相关工作，现实的资本——雇佣劳动关系被隐藏和扭曲。即便如此，无论资本和土地所有权如何被虚拟地还原为商品形态，都不得不把“劳动”工资置于对立面，这意味着即使在同一收入范畴内，也无法避免财产所有权利息与“劳动”工资之间的差异问题，这恰恰暴露了阶级矛盾的本质存在于这种商品形态的包摂之中。 （三）通过以上这种原理性论述，我们可以说为对资产阶级国家的理论基础确立了。那么，资产阶级国家是如何形成的，具有何种特征呢？ 首先，资本主义中的阶级关系普遍被商品形态所包摂，即不仅“劳动”，资本本身也不过是一种商品，土地所有权也被还原为商品所有权，虽然这样的整合关系在直接上是虚拟的，但资本主义能成立一个包含所有人的普遍意识形态。这种意识形态不如说是资产阶级意识形态，而是“公民”意识形态，小资产阶级意识形态。非阶级化、商品形态的整合，将资本本身虚拟还原为单纯的商品所有者，并将雇佣劳动者相反地作为“劳动”拥有者虚似地主体化，从而形成了资本家和雇佣劳动者普遍共有的，作为小商品所有者的意识形态。小资产阶级意识形态正是作为一个普遍的、日常的、整合所有阶级的意识形态而成立。资本主义被称为“市民社会”，正是基于这种意识形态。 这种“公民”意识形态会形成资本主义社会存在的所有“公民”的日常生活上的相互规制——自我规制。这种社会关系的普遍整合意识形态，正是法律秩序形成的直接基础。所谓的“民法”，不过是基于小资产阶级意识形态的“公民”自我规制关系、维护市民秩序关系的规范化，赋予法律规制力量而已。 作为现代国家的资产阶级国家，首先以这样的法治国家成立。然而，其法律规制力量并非通过对资本家社会关系的外部规制来发挥，而是依靠“公民”通过相互规制=自我规制来保护共同的社会秩序而显现。由于本质上是虚拟的，这种“公民”共同社会秩序维护共同利益是虚拟的、可称为幻觉，但这个幻觉并非单纯的观念，而是基于资本家经济关系本身中的现实基础而成立的意识形态。 然而，第二，这种“公民”意识形态仅是一种意识形态的事实，基于“市民社会”本质上是虚拟的。这意味着，资本主义无法排除形成对立的其他意识形态。由于“市民”社会本质上是虚拟的，这必然留下把它视为虚拟的思想形成的空间。"},{"instruction":"请将“もし、賃労働者が、資本家および土地所有者とともに同じ市民として自己を現実に商品に解消し尽してしまうならば、資本主義の包摂自体の矛盾・限界はない。しかし、本質における労働の搾取関係を、したがって階級対立関係を絶対に解消できず、むしろそれを基礎とせざるをえない資本主義は、現実においても、階級関係の商品形態的統合の擬制性を露呈するものとならざるをえず、また労働者にもそれを自覚させずにはおかないのである。したがって、階級関係の商品経済的包摂関係によって「市民」的秩序を維持する上には、必ず、この「市民」的イデオロギーの強制を、まさに社会的秩序総体の守り手たる国家によって行なわなければならない。「市民」的イデオロギーの国家的強制が不可欠たるゆえんである。ここに、「市民」的イデオロギーを法的規制力に高める法律成立の根拠がある。と同時に、「市民」的イデオロギーによる行動や社会的秩序に反した行動を行なう者に対しては、まさに全体的秩序の〝暴力的\\"破壊者として、社会的に、したがって国家権力によって、規制を加えねばならないのである。法的規制力の執行である。 しかも、第三に、ブルジョア国家は、たんに法治国家にとどまりうるものでもないのである。たしかに、資本―賃労働関係が、恐慌を通した労働力商品化の内的確保によって、経済的に処理され、資本家的経済の自立的展開が実現しえている限りでは、政治的国家\\"=権力体としての国家による社会関係の統合は消極化される、といってよい。つまり、権力体としての国家によらなければ、資本主義が経済的、社会的支配を達成できないわけではないからである。しかし、上述したように、階級関係の「市民」的統合は、擬制でしかなく、その本質における階級矛盾を隠蔽はしても、解消しうるものではないという、まさにそのことによって、いかにブルジョア国家が、社会的秩序全体の守り手であり、共同利益の体現であるという現象をもったにしても、その秩序維持や利益擁護が、支配階級たるブルジョアのものでしかありえないことを、共同利益とは、本質的には“幻想”たることを、必ず露呈せざるをえない。こうして、資本による賃労働の支配搾取関係が、つまり同市民関係の〝抜穴\\"が、本質において解消しえず、現実にも露呈せざるをえない限り、国家は、たんに法治国家にとどまらず、暴力装置をもつ権力機構として成立しなければならないのである。 もちろん、このような権力機構としての国家の具体的な形態は、資本主義が階級関係をいかに商品経済的関係に統合しえているかにかかっている問題であって、恐慌を通した労働力商品化の経済的処理が実現している段階には、それは消極化され、法的規制力の維持権力にとどまりうる。しかし、階級関係の経済的処理自体の矛盾が現実に露呈するならば、そこから生ずる反対制運動、反体制イデオロギーの状況如何によって、権力機構としての国家による積極的対応が要請される。一般的には、共同利益の代表としての国家の性格が、その幻想的本質を現実に露呈すればするほど、それだけ強力な国家権力の介入が不可避であり、社会関係に対する国家的イデオロギーの外的強制、政治権力の直接的介入が行なわれることになる。 しかし、このことは、資本による階級矛盾の処理が、したがって現実的な社会の階級関係―その対立・矛盾が、資本主義の歴史的段階に応じていかなる態様であるかによって、具体的に明らかにされなければならないのであって、資本主義の世界史的発展段階に対応したブルジョア国家の段階論的解明によって、明らかにされなければならない、といえよう。 (かまくらたかお・経済学・埼玉大学) 51 资本论体系和国家的逻辑 湯浅 鎌倉さんの論文「資本主義と国家」を大変面白く拝見したんです。もともとぼくは、宇野派について関心をもっていました。立場が違うのははっきりしているんですが、なで切りにするというのではなくて、内在的に理解して、骨までしゃぶり尽そうとい関心で読んできたわけです。それで鎌倉さんのご論文を大変興味をもって拝見したわけですが、その中で、是非教えていただきたいこと、それから疑問に思うことが幾つか出てきたんで、それをまずお尋ねして、それについて教えていただいて、それを糸口として話し合ってみたいと思います。”翻译为中文","output":"如果雇佣劳动者能够像资本家和土地所有者一样，作为同样的市民完全将自己溶解于商品之中，资本主义的包容自身的矛盾与限制就不存在了。然而，资本主义绝对无法解决劳动的本质上的剥削关系，因此也就无法绝对解决阶级对立关系，资本主义基于此不得不使这种关系明显地表现出来，也使得劳动者不得不意识到这一点。因此，为了维持通过商品经济关系包容的“市民”秩序，必须由作为社会秩序全体的守卫者的国家来执行这种“市民”意识形态的强制。这就是“市民”意识形态需要通过国家强制的原因。这里存在着以法律规制力提升“市民”意识形态的法律成立的基础。同时，对于那些进行“市民”意识形态或社会秩序相违反行动的人，必须将其视为全体秩序的“暴力性”破坏者，在社会上，因此通过国家权力进行管制，这是法律规制力执行的内容。 此外，第三，资产阶级国家不仅仅能够停留在法治国家的层面。诚然，只要通过恐慌实现劳动力商品化的内部保障，资本关系经济能得到处理，资本主义经济的自主发展能够实现，国家作为“政治国家”=权力机构在社会关系统合上可说是被动化。即，资本主义无需依赖于作为权力机构的国家也能实现经济上、社会上的统治。然而，正如上述，阶级关系的“市民”整合实质上是虚拟的，并不能真正消解其中的阶级矛盾，正因为如此，即便资产阶级国家具备了维护社会秩序全体守护者、共同利益体现者的现象，也必然暴露出维护秩序和利益实质上仅属于统治阶级——资产阶级，共同利益本质上是“幻觉”。因此，只要资本对雇佣劳动的支配剥削关系，即所谓的“市民”关系的“漏洞”本质上无法被消除、在现实中也必须被暴露，国家就不仅仅是一个法治国家，而必须作为拥有暴力装置的权力机构而成立。 当然，作为权力机构的国家的具体形态，取决于资本主义如何能够将阶级关系整合进商品经济关系，如果通过恐慌实现了劳动力商品化的经济处理，则可能是被动化的、仅维持法律规制力的权力。但是，如果阶级关系的经济处理本身的矛盾在现实中被暴露出来，那么由此产生的反体制运动、反体制意识形态的情况将要求作为权力机构的国家进行积极的响应。通常，国家作为共同利益的代表，其幻想的本质越是在现实中被暴露出来，就越需要强力的国家权力介入，对社会关系进行国家的外部强制、政治权力的直接介入。 然而，这意味着，资本处理阶级矛盾的方式，因此社会的阶级关系——其对立和矛盾根据资本主义的历史阶段以何种方式出现，必须被具体地阐明，需要通过对应于资本主义世界历史发展阶段的资产阶级国家的阶段论解明来明确。 (鎌仓隆夫·经济学·埼玉大学) 资本论体系与国家的逻辑 湯浅
