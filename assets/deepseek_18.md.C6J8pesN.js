Converting to rectangular coordinates, we get 2x^2+y^2=1. 2. When we stretch the x-coordinates by 2 times and shorten the y-coordinates by half for all points on curve C_1, we get curve C_2. Consider a point on C_2 with coordinates (x, y). Its corresponding point on C_1 would have coordinates (m, n). Hence, we have x=2m and y=frac{n}{2}, with 2m^2+n^2=1. Consequently, 2left(frac{x}{2}right)^2+(2y)^2=1 or frac{x^2}{2}+4y^2=1.

We aim to find the expression for a_{2024}+b_{2023}. **Step 1: Combining the recursive formulas.** Adding the two given recursive formulas, we have: [ 2a_{n+1} + 2b_{n+1} = (3a_{n} + b_{n} + 2) + (a_{n} + 3b_{n} - 2) ] Simplifying the right side, we get: [ = 4a_{n} + 4b_{n} ] This simplifies further to: [ a_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = 2(a_{n} + b_{n}) ] This indicates that the sequence {a_{n}+b_{n}} is a geometric sequence with the first term 2 (since a_{1}+b_{1}=2) and common ratio 2. Hence, we can write: [ a_{n} + b_{n} = 2cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^{n} ] **Step 2: Expressing a_{n+1} in terms of a_{n} and b_{n}.** From the given 2a_{n+1}=3a_{n}+b_{n}+2, we divide both sides by 2 to get: [ a_{n+1} = frac{3}{2}a_{n} + frac{1}{2}b_{n} + 1 ] Adding b_{n} to both sides, we obtain: [ a_{n+1} + b_{n} = frac{3}{2}a_{n} + frac{1}{2}b_{n} + 1 + b_{n} = frac{3}{2}(a_{n} + b_{n}) + 1 ] Knowing that a_{n} + b_{n} = 2^{n}, we substitute this into the equation to get: [ a_{n+1} + b_{n} = frac{3}{2}cdot 2^{n} + 1 ] **Step 3: Finding a_{2024} + b_{2023}.** Substituting n=2023 in the equation from Step 2 gives us: [ a_{2024} + b_{2023} = frac{3}{2}cdot 2^{2023} + 1 = 3cdot 2^{2022} + 1 ] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}, which is 3cdot 2^{2022} + 1."},{"instruction":"Which of the following calculations is correct?

Factoring or completing the square might not be straightforward without knowing a. However, we can still deduce some properties from the inequality: The parabola y = x^2 - 2x + a opens upwards since the coefficient of x^2 is positive. If A is a set of real numbers defined by this inequality, the vertex of the parabola represents the minimum point on the graph, and the value of x at the vertex is given by x = frac{-(-2)}{2 cdot 1} = 1. Since the inequality is less than or equal to zero, the range of x within A must include x=1 and extend to the left and right towards the roots of the equation (if they exist). For set B, the quadratic inequality is x^2 - 3x + 2 leq 0. This can be factored into (x-1)(x-2) leq 0. The roots of the inequality are x=1 and x=2, and since it\'s a \\"less than or equal to\\" inequality, the solutions are in the closed interval [1,2]. Now, given that B subset A, the interval [1,2] must be completely contained within the interval defined by set A. This means that the value x=2, which is the upper bound of B, must be less than or equal to the upper bound of A. Turning our attention to the quadratic equation x^2 - 2x + a = 0, associated with the boundary of A, the sum and product of its roots, which we\'ll call m and n, are related to the coefficients by Vieta\'s formulas:  m + n = 2 quad text{(sum of roots)}   m cdot n = a quad text{(product of roots)}  Since n must be at least 2 to include the interval [1,2], and m + n = 2, we have that m leq 0.

A standard chessboard has 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. These squares are alternately colored black and white. 2. Removing two specific squares from the chessboard, namely the top-left corner (denoted as ((1,1))) and the bottom-right corner (denoted as ((8,8))), we are left with 62 squares. We need to assess whether it is possible to cover these remaining 62 squares with dominoes.  3. Each domino, by definition, covers 2 adjacent squares. Thus, since each domino covers both a black square and a white square, any arrangement of dominoes will cover an equal number of black and white squares. 4. To understand the coloring, recall:     - In a standard chessboard, the top-left corner ((1,1)) corresponds to a black square.     - The bottom-right corner ((8,8)) also corresponds to a black square. 5. Removing these two black squares leaves the board with:     - 30 black squares (since initially there were 32, and 2 were removed).     - 32 white squares (since no white squares were removed). 6. Now, observe that to cover all remaining squares with dominoes:     - If we attempt to place 30 dominoes, each of these dominoes will cover 1 black square and 1 white square.     - Thus, 30 dominoes will cover 30 black squares and 30 white squares in total. 7. However, this leaves 2 white squares uncovered due to the difference in the number of remaining black and white squares.  8.

First, he found the product of the numbers in each column, and then for each of the 18 obtained products, he calculated the sum of the digits. Could all the resulting sums turn out to be the same?","output":"1. Assume that each of the digit sums S_i of the products of the numbers in each column is equal to a constant S. Thus, we have 18 sums, each equal to S. 2. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by 9. This basic fact about divisibility rules needs to be kept in mind as we proceed. 3. When considering the details of the problem:    - The table contains 72 natural numbers ranging from 1 to 72 organized in an arbitrary manner known only to Vasya.    - The dimensions of the table are 4 times 18, thus each column contains 4 numbers.    - The product of the numbers in each column can be represented as P_i for i = 1, 2, ldots, 18. 4. Let\'s investigate the conditions under which P_i (the product of numbers in each column) is divisible by 9. This happens in the following cases:    - If P_i includes at least one number that is a multiple of 9.    - If P_i includes at least two numbers that are multiples of 3 but not multiples of 9 (since 3 times 3 = 9 forms part of P_i). 5. Now, among the numbers between 1 and 72:    - Exactly 8 numbers are multiples of 9: these are 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, and 72.    - Exactly 16 numbers are multiples of 3 but not multiples of 9: these numbers are 3, 6, 12, 15, 21, 24, 30, 33, 39, 42, 48, 51, 57, 60, 66, and 69. 6. To ensure that P_i is divisible by 9:    - Consider columns that involve multiples of 9. There can be at most 8 such columns.    - Next, consider columns that are formed from pairs of multiples of 3 but are not multiples of 9. There can be at most an additional 8 such columns because we need two multiples of 3 to form a new multiple of 9 (Dot not forget that these pairs cannot be used anywhere else). 7. Thus, the best-case scenario is having a maximum of 16 columns where the product P_i is divisible by 9 because 8 + 8 = 16. 8. However, there are 18 columns in total, meaning that at least 2 columns must involve products that are not divisible by 9. 9. This discrepancy implies that there will always be at least 2 columns for which the digit sums (sums of the digits of their product) are not necessarily divisible by 9, thus making them possibly different from the others which were assumed to be equal to S and divisible by 9. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is impossible for all the digit sums of the products in each column to be identical and divisible by 9.

Let\'s denote the vertices of the quadrilateral as (A, B, C, D) where: - ( AB = BC = CD = b ) - ( AD = a ) - The quadrilateral (ABCD) is inscribed in a circle with radius (R) and is the base of the cone. To solve the problem, we proceed with these steps:  Step 1: Area of the Quadrilateral (ABCD) 1. Given that (A, B, C, D) are cyclic (since they are inscribed in a circle), the diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at point (P). 2. Notice that due to symmetry and the properties of the cyclic quadrilateral:    [    AD parallel BC    ] 3. Theorem: In a cyclic quadrilateral, we have (angle ADC + angle ABC = 180^circ). 4. Calculate the area (S_{ABCD}) by splitting it into two triangles:    [    S_{ABCD} = S_{ACD} + S_{ABC}    ] 5. Using the sine formula for the area of the triangle:    [    S_{ACD} = frac{1}{2} times AD times CD sin angle ADC = frac{1}{2} times a times b sin beta    ]    [    S_{ABC} = frac{1}{2} times AB times BC sin angle ABC = frac{1}{2} times b times b sin beta    ]        Where (beta) is the angle subtended by the sides AD and CD. 6. Thus:    [    S_{ABCD} = frac{1}{2}ab sin beta + frac{1}{2}b^2 sin beta = frac{1}{2} sin beta (ab + b^2)    ]  Step 2: Length of Diagonal (AC) 1. Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:    [    (AC)^2 = b^2 + ab    ]        Therefore:    [    AC = sqrt{b^2 + ab}    ]  Step 3: Radius of the Circumscribed Circle 1. Using the sine theorem in (triangle ACD):    [    R = frac{AC}{2 sin beta}    ]        Therefore:    [    R = frac{sqrt{b^2 + ab}}{2 sin beta}    ]  Step 4: Height of the Pyramid 1. From the problem statement:    - The height (H) of the pyramid is half the height of the cone which is:      [      text{Height of cone} = R cot alpha Rightarrow text{Height of pyramid} = frac{R cot alpha}{2}      ]    - Therefore:      [      H = frac{sqrt{b^2 + ab} cot alpha}{4 sin beta}      ]  Step 5: Volume of the Pyramid 1.

Now, our expression becomes frac{2sin 35^{circ} cos 35^{circ} sin 20^{circ}}{sin^2 35^{circ} - sin^2 155^{circ}}.

Applying the sum and difference identities for sine, we can rewrite the denominator as left(2cos 95^{circ} sin (-60^{circ})right)left(2sin 95^{circ} cos 60^{circ}right). We can simplify this expression further to obtain -2sin 95^{circ} cos 95^{circ}. Now, we can cancel out the common factors in the numerator and denominator, which leads us to: frac{sin 40^{circ}}{2 cos 50^{circ}} Finally, applying the half-angle identity for cosine, we can express cos 50^{circ} as sqrt{frac{1 + cos 100^{circ}}{2}}. Since cos 100^{circ} = -sin 10^{circ}, we can use the small-angle approximation to deduce that cos 50^{circ} approx sqrt{frac{1}{2}}.

Substitute n:    [    sigma left( 2^{k-1} cdot b right) = 2 left( 2^{k-1} cdot b right)    ] 4.

If a participant loses twice, they are out of the tournament. To find out how many rounds are required, we break down the problem and prove two statements. 1. **Statement 1:**    In a tournament with (2^n) participants, after (m) rounds, (2^{n-m}) participants will remain without any loss and (m cdot 2^{n-m}) participants will have one loss.    - **Base Case:** For (m=1), it is evident since after the first round half participants win and the other half lose.    - **Induction Step:** Assume the statement holds for some (m < n). Before the ((m+1))-th round, participants are split into pairs, half of which win and half lose. Hence, the number of participants without any loss is halved: (2^{n-m-1}). Those with one loss are the losers of the group of leaders (2^{n-m-1}) plus participants with one loss who won in the current round: (m cdot 2^{n-m-1}). Thus, after the ((m+1))-th round, the number of participants with one loss is:      [      (m+1) cdot 2^{n-m-1}      ]    This completes the induction step. 2. **Statement 2:**        We can split the tournament into two groups: one with 1024 participants and another with 128 participants, and count the rounds separately for each group.

Each permutation represents a unique ordering of the elements. 4. **Define ( S_{sigma} ):**    - For a permutation (sigma) of ({1, 2, 3, 4}), let ( S_{sigma} ) be the set of elements ((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) in ( I ) that satisfy ( x_{sigma(1)} leq x_{sigma(2)} leq x_{sigma(3)} leq x_{sigma(4)} ). 5. **Covering ( I ) with ( S_{sigma} ):**    - The sets ( S_{sigma} ) for all 24 permutations (sigma) cover the entire set ( I ). This is because any element ((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) in ( I ) can be ordered in exactly one of the 24 ways. 6. **No two elements in the same ( S_{sigma} ):**    - No two elements of ( A ) can be in the same set ( S_{sigma} ) for any (sigma). This is because if two elements were in the same ( S_{sigma} ), they would have the same order, and the condition ((x_i - x_j)(y_i - y_j) < 0) would not be satisfied for any pair ( i, j ). 7. **Maximize ( |A| ):**    - Since there are 24 permutations and each permutation corresponds to a unique ordering, the maximum size of ( A ) is 24. This is achieved by taking one element from each ( S_{sigma} ). 8. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, the maximum value of ( |A| ) is ( boxed{24} )."},{"instruction":"Suppose x chickens produce y eggs in z days.

Rewriting it, we get:   (c-a)x^2 + 2bx + (a+c) = 0.   Since the equation has two equal real roots, its discriminant must equal zero. Thus, we have:   Delta = 4b^2 - 4(c-a)(a+c) = 0.   Expanding and simplifying gives us:   a^2 + b^2 = c^2.   This indicates that triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle, with the right angle at angle C. 2. From the given information, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and 3c = a + 3b.   We can square the latter identity:   (3c - 3b)^2 + b^2 = c^2.   Expanding this, we get:   (4c - 5b)(c - b) = 0.   So either 4c - 5b = 0 or c - b = 0. Since c cannot be equal to b in a right-angled triangle where c is the hypotenuse, we conclude that:   4c = 5b, hence b = frac{4}{5}c.

Since the distance d from the center O(0, 0) to the line is d=2=r, the line x=2 meets the requirements; (2) When the line passing through point (2, 3) is not perpendicular to the x-axis, let the equation of the line be y-3=k(x-2),   which simplifies to kx-y-2k+3=0.

At this point, the equation of the line, after rearranging, is 5x-12y+26=0. In summary, the equations of the tangent lines are 5x-12y+26=0 or x=2. Therefore, the answer is: 5x-12y+26=0 or x=2. Firstly, the center of the circle x^2+y^2=4 is at the origin, and its radius is 2. Then, it discusses: when the slope of the line passing through point (2, 3) does not exist, the equation is x=2. By verifying the distance from the center to the line, it is found that x=2 meets the requirements; when the slope of the line passing through point (2, 3) exists, set the line equation as y-3=k(x-2), and by equating the distance from the center to the line to the radius, an equation in terms of k is established, solving it to find k, and thus obtaining the equation of the line. Finally, the answer is obtained by combining the two cases.

It is known that there is at least one rabbit in each cage. We will call two rabbits neighbors if they are either in the same cage or in adjacent cages. It turned out that each rabbit has either 3 or 7 neighbors. How many rabbits are in the central cage?","output":"1. We start by numbering the cages from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 2. Let\'s analyze the neighbors of the rabbits:    - A rabbit in the first cage can only have neighbors in the first two cages.    - A rabbit in the second cage can have neighbors in the first three cages.    - A rabbit in the third cage, because it is in the central cage, can have neighbors in all five cages. 3. Since the total number of neighbors of each rabbit can be either 3 or 7:    - A rabbit in the first cage cannot have 7 neighbors because there are not enough cages; thus, it must have 3 neighbors.    - A rabbit in the second cage has more neighbors than a rabbit in the first cage. Therefore, it must have 7 neighbors.     4. For a rabbit in the second cage to have exactly 7 neighbors, there must be more rabbits in the central cage (cage 3), as this is the only way for it to connect to rabbits in the surrounding cages (1, 2, 3). 5. To ensure the rabbit in the second cage has 7 neighbors, let\'s consider the calculation:    - Rabbits in the first three cages (1, 2, and 3) provide these neighbors.    - Since the third cage adds the necessary extra connections, the number of rabbits in the third cage must account for the excess neighbors. 6. Let’s denote ( R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5 ) as the number of rabbits in cages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. From the problem, we know:    - (R_2) has 7 neighbors.    - (R_1 + R_2 + R_3) rabbits must sum up in such a way to fit the neighbor criteria. Given (R_2) isn\'t a boundary cage, its 7 neighbors derive from cages 1, 2, and 3:    [    R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 7    ]    7. Given that a rabbit in the first cage (R_1) can only derive 3 neighbors from (R_1 + R_2):    [    R_1 + R_2 = 3    ]     8. Concluding from this:     [     R_3 = 7 - (R_1 + R_2)     ]     [     R_3 = 7 - 3 = 4     ] 9. So rabbits in the first cage are referenced with 2, in the second with 2, and hence, ensure the correct neighboring balances for the configuring cages, the rabbits align accurately if distributed numerically between maximums. **Conclusion**: There are ( 4 ) rabbits in the central cage.

We are allowed to perform the following operation: erase two pieces of glass with different colors, and then paint each piece in the third color. 1. Prove that no matter how many pieces of each color there are initially, we can eventually make all the pieces the same color after some finite number of operations. 2. Determine the final color in terms of the initial distribution of colors, independent of the sequence of operations.   Part (1): **Step 1: Define Variables and Objective Function** Let\'s denote the number of red, yellow, and blue glass pieces by (x_1), (x_2), and (x_3), respectively. We aim to show that after performing some finite number of operations, we can make the function (f): [ f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - 662)^2 + (x_2 - 662)^2 + (x_3 - 662)^2 ] decrease and eventually stabilize. **Step 2: Transformation and Function Decrease** Consider the operation where we erase one red and one yellow piece, then paint two pieces in blue. The resulting transformation can be expressed as: [ (x_1, x_2, x_3) rightarrow (x_1 - 1, x_2 - 1, x_3 + 2) ] or equivalently for (f): [ f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - 662)^2 + (x_2 - 662)^2 + (x_3 - 662)^2 ] [ Rightarrow g((x_1 - 2), (x_2 + 1), (x_3 + 1)) ] Calculating (f(y_1, y_2, y_3)) where (y_1 = x_1 - 2), (y_2 = x_2 + 1), and (y_3 = x_3 + 1): [ f(y_1, y_2, y_3) = (x_1 - 2 - 662)^2 + (x_2 + 1 - 662)^2 + (x_3 + 1 - 662)^2 ] Expanding and simplifying, we get: [ = (x_1 - 664)^2 + (x_2 - 661)^2 + (x_3 - 661)^2 = (x_1 - 662)^2 - 4(x_1 - 662) + 4 + (x_2 - 662)^2 + 2(x_2 - 662) + 1 + (x_3 - 662)^2 + 2(x_3 - 662) + 1 ] [ = f(x_1, x_2, x_3) - 4(x_1 - 662) + 2(x_2 - 662) + 2(x_3 - 662) + 6 ] **Step 3: Decreasing Property of (f)** For (x_1 geqslant 664), and noting that ( x_2 + x_3 leq 1323 ): [ f(x_1, x_2, x_3) - f(y_1, y_2, y_3) = 4x_1 - 2(x_2 + x_3) - 6 geq 2656 - 2646 - 6 = 4 ] Thus, the value of the function (f) decreases by at least 4 as long as one of (x_1), (x_2), or (x_3) is greater than 663. This indicates that eventually, ( max { x_1, x_2, x_3 } leqslant 663 ). Given the sum constraint ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1987 ), we find that ( max { x_1, x_2, x_3 } = 663 ) with possible configurations ((663, 663, 661)) or ((663, 662, 662)). No matter the configuration, we can continue the process until all glass pieces become one color. [blacksquare]  Part (2): **Step 1: Number Representation and Modulo Property** Represent the colors red, yellow, and blue as integers 0, 1, and 2, respectively.  Let (S) be the sum of these integers modulo 3 for all 1987 pieces. **Step 2: Invariance Under Operations** Note the following operations: 1. Erase one red and one yellow, paint two blue ((S) increases by 3). 2. Erase one red and one blue, paint two yellow ((S) remains unchanged). 3. Erase one yellow and one blue, paint two red ((S) decreases by 3). Thus, (S mod 3) remains invariant. **Step 3: Final Color Determination** If initially: - (S equiv 0 pmod{3}), all pieces become red. - (S equiv 1 pmod{3}), all pieces become yellow. - (S equiv 2 pmod{3}), all pieces become blue. Since (1987 = 3 times 662 + 1): The initial configuration determines that ( S equiv 1 pmod{3} ). Therefore, the final color is yellow.

We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. So, 9 km/hr = 9 * 1000 meters / 3600 seconds = 2.5 m/s. Now, we have the speed of the boy in meters per second. Next, we use the time taken to run around the square field to find the total distance covered. Total distance = Speed * Time Total distance = 2.5 m/s * 88 seconds = 220 meters. Since the field is square, it has four equal sides. The total distance covered when running around the field is the perimeter of the square. Perimeter of a square = 4 * side length.

Let\'s analyze the space around each shape:     - Each 1 text{ cm} diameter circle will create a \\"buffer zone\\" around itself due to its radius, which is 0.5 text{ cm} to ensure that it does not intersect another circle. Hence, the region around each circle that cannot contain another circle\'s center is a 1 text{ cm} radius disk.     - The total area covered by the buffer zones around the three 1 text{ cm} diameter circles is 3 times pi left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = 3pi square centimeters. 4. Next, consider the space around each 1 text{ cm} side square:     - Each square has a buffering zone of 0.5 text{ cm} around its edges to avoid intersection. This zone can be visualized as four strips (one on each side of the square), each 1 text{ cm} long and 0.5 text{ cm} wide, and four quarter circles (one at each corner of the square) with radius 0.5 text{ cm}.     - The area covered by the buffer zone around one square is the area of the four strips plus the four quarter circles: 4 times left(frac{1}{2} times 1 times frac{1}{2} right) + 4 times frac{pi}{4} left( frac{1}{2}right)^2 = 4 times frac{1}{4} + pi times frac{1}{4} = 1 + frac{pi}{4} square centimeters.     - Hence, the total area covered by the buffer zones around the four squares is 4 times left(1 + frac{pi}{4}right) = 4 + pi square centimeters. 5. The total area of all the buffer zones together is the sum of the buffer areas for the circles and the squares:     [     3pi + 4 + pi = 4pi + 4     ] 6.

To understand why let\'s consider the alternating pattern and the starting and ending points:    - Start at (A) (pictures: ( times ))    - Move to a neighboring hall (sculptures: ( circ ))    - Proceed by alternating through the museum, always moving to adjacent halls    - End at (B) (pictures: ( times )) 5. Since the path starts and ends with pictures and includes visits to sculptures in between, the total visited halls must be odd. This is because:    [    text{Number of } times + text{Number of } circ = 15    ]    The next step is to count the maximal alternation within the constraints of starting at (A) and ending at (B). 6. First, consider the museum layout. The halls are simply connected, meaning every hall has at least one adjacent hall. 7. The challenge is to find a path to cover as many halls as possible while adhering to the rule of never revisiting a hall. We start moving to an adjacent hall, alternating between pictures and sculptures. Here is a sample path:    [    A (times) to X_1 (circ) to X_2 (times) to X_3 (circ) to dots to X_{14} (circ) to B (times)    ] 8. Since there are 8 halls with pictures and 8 with sculptures, alternating visits ensure that:    - The tourist visits 8 halls with pictures    - The tourist visits only 7 halls with sculptures    Thus, the tourist visits 8 + 7 = 15 halls in total. 9. As proven, the tourist can\'t visit more than 8 picture halls and 7 sculpture halls while adhering to the constraints of revisiting. Therefore, the maximum number of halls a tourist can visit under the given constraints is (15).

Given that the sum of the odd terms is 4 and the sum of the even terms is 3, we can deduce that the total number of terms in the sequence is 2n+1.

However, the problem does not require us to perform these calculations explicitly. Instead, we are asked to determine the value of n based on the given sums of odd and even terms.

If the tank is full, it will take 30 hours for the leak to empty it. How long does it take to fill the tank without the leak?","output":"Let\'s denote the time it takes to fill the tank without the leak as ( T ) hours. When the tank is being filled with the leak, it takes ( T + 1 ) hours. The rate at which the tank is filled without the leak is ( frac{1}{T} ) (tank per hour). The rate at which the tank is being emptied by the leak is ( frac{1}{30} ) (tank per hour), since it takes 30 hours to empty a full tank. When the tank is being filled with the leak, the effective rate of filling is the rate of filling without the leak minus the rate at which the leak empties the tank. So, the effective rate of filling with the leak is ( frac{1}{T} - frac{1}{30} ). Since it takes ( T + 1 ) hours to fill the tank with the leak, the effective rate of filling with the leak is ( frac{1}{T + 1} ) (tank per hour). Now we can set up the equation: [ frac{1}{T} - frac{1}{30} = frac{1}{T + 1} ] To solve for ( T ), we first find a common denominator and equate the numerators: [ 30(T + 1) - T(T + 1) = 30T ] Expanding the terms: [ 30T + 30 - T^2 - T = 30T ] Simplify the equation by subtracting ( 30T ) from both sides: [ 30 - T^2 - T = 0 ] Rearrange the terms: [ T^2 + T - 30 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ). We can solve for ( T ) by factoring: [ (T + 6)(T - 5) = 0 ] So, ( T + 6 = 0 ) or ( T - 5 = 0 ). This gives us two possible solutions for ( T ): ( T = -6 ) or ( T = 5 ). Since time cannot be negative, we discard ( T = -6 ) and accept ( T = 5 ).

For which integers ( n ) is it certain that no matter the initial configuration of the lamps, they will all be off after some time?","output":"1. **Initial Analysis:**     - Consider a row of n lamps, where some lamps are initially on.     - Each minute, a lamp with exactly one neighboring lit lamp turns on; otherwise, it turns off.     - The goal is to determine for which integers n, all lamps will be off after a certain time, regardless of the initial configuration. 2. **Case for Even n:**     - If n is even, we show by contradiction that it is impossible for all lamps to turn off.     - Assume all lamps are off at time t. At time t-1, the pattern for the lamps would require the second lamp, fourth lamp, and so on up to the n-th lamp to have been off.     - Similarly, considering the pattern from the right, the (n-1)-th lamp, (n-3)-th lamp, and so on up to the first lamp must also have been off at time t-1.     - This creates a contradiction because for all lamps to turn off at time t, each lamp must have contradictory requirements from their neighbors. 3. **Case for Odd n:**     - Now consider n is odd. Focus on positions 2, 4, 6, ldots, (n-1).     - After two minutes, any such lamp lights up if exactly one of its neighbors at distance 2 is lit.     - If an odd n does not meet the condition, then 2n+1 also does not meet the condition. 4. **Special Case: n = 2^k - 1:**     - The only integers remaining are n of the form 2^k - 1 for k geq 1.     - Proof by induction shows these satisfy the condition. Assume true for k:         - Consider 2^{k+1}-1 lamps.         - At even times, even-position lamps evolve independently of odd-position lamps.         - 2^k - 1 even-position lamps operate as per the initial problem, and the 2^k odd-position lamps behave as if the boundary lamps were neighbors to themselves. 5. **Circle Argument (Extension):**     - Consider 2^{k+1} lamps in a circle:         - Each lamp lights up if exactly one of its neighbors is lit.         - Prove by induction that any single lit lamp forces all lamps to turn off after k+1 steps.     - Any configuration can be represented with 1s (lit) and 0s (not lit).     - After each step, the value of a lamp is the sum modulo 2 of its neighbors.     - By considering configurations A and B and their sum modulo 2, any combination of initial states leads to all lamps turning off after k+1 steps. 6. **Symmetry Argument:**     - Place a configuration of length 2^k in a circle of length 2^{k+1}, completing the circle with its symmetric counterpart.     - The configuration will maintain its symmetry and evolution in the half-circle, mirroring the interval’s behavior.  Conclusion: For integers of the form 2^k - 1 (k geq 1), all lamps will be guaranteed to turn off after a certain time, regardless of the initial configuration.

Since the arc length of a circle segment is r alpha, we have the equation:    [    r alpha = 1    ]    Solving for r gives:    [    r = frac{1}{alpha}    ] 3. **Substituting r in the Area Formula**:    Substitute r = frac{1}{alpha} back into the area formula:    [    T(alpha) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{alpha} right)^2 (alpha - sin alpha) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{alpha - sin alpha}{alpha^2}    ] 4. **Differentiability and Finding Critical Points**:    Since T(alpha) is differentiable for alpha neq 0, to find the maximum value within the interval, we need to find where the derivative T\'(alpha) = 0. 5. **Computing the Derivative**:    First compute the derivative of T(alpha):    [    T\'(alpha) = frac{d}{dalpha}left( frac{1}{2} cdot frac{alpha - sin alpha}{alpha^2} right)    ]    Using the quotient rule,     [    frac{d}{dalpha} left( frac{u}{v} right) = frac{v frac{du}{dalpha} - u frac{dv}{dalpha}}{v^2}    ]    where (u = alpha - sin alpha) and (v = 2 alpha^2), we get:    [    begin{aligned}    T\'(alpha) &= frac{2alpha^2 cdot (cos{alpha}-alpha cos{alpha}) -(alpha-sin{alpha})cdot 4alpha}{(2alpha^2)^2}    &= frac{2alpha^2 cos{alpha}-(alpha^3 + alpha sin{alpha})(cos {alpha} +1)}{4alpha^4}    &= frac{2sin{alpha} -alpha(1+cos{alpha})}{2alpha^3}    &= frac{cos frac{alpha}{2}}{alpha^3} left( 2 sinfrac{alpha}{2}-alpha cosfrac{alpha}{2}right)    &= frac{2 cos^2 frac{alpha}{2}}{alpha^3} left( tan frac{alpha}{2} - frac{alpha}{2} right)    end{aligned}    ] 6. **Analyzing the Derivative**:    The expression inside the parentheses, ( tan frac{alpha}{2} - frac{alpha}{2} ), is positive if (0 < frac{alpha}{2} < frac{pi}{2}) and negative if (pi < alpha < 2pi). Since (cos^2 frac{alpha}{2}) and (alpha^3) are always positive, we get:    [    begin{cases}    T\'(alpha) > 0 & text{if } 0 < alpha < pi     T\'(alpha) < 0 & text{if } pi < alpha < 2pi    end{cases}    ] 7. **Critical Point Analysis**:    Since the derivative changes sign at (alpha = pi), we infer that it is a maximum point.

Therefore, the ratio of the man\'s current age to his wife\'s age ten years ago is: M : (W - 10) 30 : 20 3 : 2 The ratio is boxed{3:2} ."},{"instruction":"Let ( f: mathbb{R}^{d} rightarrow (0, infty) ) be a twice continuously differentiable function such that for all ( x in mathbb{R}^{d} ): [ nabla^{2} h(x) = nabla^{top} nabla h(x) = sum_{i=1}^{d} h_{x_{i} x_{i}}^{prime prime}(x) leqslant 0, quad h=sqrt{f} ] Also, let [ mathrm{E}|nabla ln f(xi)|^{2}<infty, quad mathrm{E} frac{1}{f(xi)} sum_{i=1}^{d} f_{x_{i} x_{i}}^{prime prime}(xi)<infty ] where ( xi ) is a Gaussian vector in ( mathbb{R}^{d} ) with unit covariance matrix, and [ nabla=left(nabla_{1}, ldots, nabla_{d}right), quad nabla_{i}=frac{partial}{partial x_{i}} ] Prove that, regardless of ( mathrm{E} xi ), the following inequality holds: [ mathrm{E}|xi+nabla ln f(xi)mathrm{E} xi|^{2} leqslant mathrm{E}|ximathrm{E} xi|^{2}=d ] Also, derive that for ( d geq 3 ), the following equalities hold: [ mathrm{E}left|xi+frac{A xi}{xi^{top} B xi}mathrm{E} xiright|^{2}=dmathrm{E} frac{xi^{top} A^{2} xi}{left(xi^{top} B xiright)^{2}}, quad B=[(operatorname{tr} A) I2 A]^{1} A^{2} ] for any symmetric matrix ( A ) such that the matrix ( (operatorname{tr} A) I2 A ) is positive definite.","output":"Given the function ( f: mathbb{R}^{d} to (0, infty) ) which is smooth up to the second order and for all ( x in mathbb{R}^{d} ), we have: [ nabla^{2} h(x) = nabla^top nabla h(x) = sum_{i=1}^{d} h_{x_{i} x_{i}}^{prime prime}(x) leq 0, quad text{where } h = sqrt{f} ] Additionally, we know that: [ mathrm{E}|nabla ln f(xi)|^{2} < infty, quad mathrm{E} frac{1}{f(xi)} sum_{i=1}^{d} f_{x_{i} x_{i}}^{prime prime}(xi) < infty ] where ( xi ) is a Gaussian vector in ( mathbb{R}^{d} ) with a unit covariance matrix, and [ nabla = (nabla_{1}, ldots, nabla_{d}), quad nabla_{i} = frac{partial}{partial x_{i}} ] We aim to prove the inequality: [ mathrm{E}|xi + nabla ln f(xi) - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} leq mathrm{E}|xi - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} = d ]  Step-by-step solution: 1. **Calculate the Expected Value Expression:** [ mathrm{E}|xi + nabla ln f(xi) - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} ] Expanding this expectation, we get: [ mathrm{E}|xi + nabla ln f(xi) - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} = mathrm{E}|xi - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} + 2 mathrm{E}((xi - mathrm{E} xi)^top nabla ln f(xi)) + mathrm{E}|nabla ln f(xi)|^{2} ] 2. **Use Stein\'s Lemma:** According to Stein\'s lemma (problem II.13.68), [ mathrm{E}((xi - mathrm{E} xi)^top nabla ln f(xi)) = mathrm{E} (nabla^{2} ln f(xi)) ] 3. **Relate Second Derivatives:** Using the property of gradients and Hessians, [ nabla^{2} ln f = nabla^top left(frac{nabla f}{f}right) = frac{nabla^{2} f}{f} - frac{|nabla f|^{2}}{f^{2}} ] Therefore, [ mathrm{E}((xi - mathrm{E} xi)^top nabla ln f(xi)) = mathrm{E} left(frac{nabla^{2} f(xi)}{f(xi)} - frac{|nabla f(xi)|^{2}}{f(xi)^{2}}right) ] 4. **Combine Results:** Substituting back into the original expression, we have: [ mathrm{E}|xi + nabla ln f(xi) - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} = d + 2 mathrm{E} left(frac{nabla^{2} f(xi)}{f(xi)} - frac{|nabla f(xi)|^{2}}{f(xi)^{2}}right) + mathrm{E} |nabla ln f(xi)|^{2} ] 5. **Simplify Using ( h = sqrt{f} ):** Noting, [ nabla^{2} sqrt{f} = nabla^top nabla sqrt{f} = frac{1}{2} nabla^top left(frac{nabla f}{sqrt{f}}right) = frac{nabla^{2} f}{2sqrt{f}} - frac{|nabla f|^{2}}{4f^{3/2}} ] Results in: [ mathrm{E}|xi + nabla ln f(xi) - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} = d + 4 mathrm{E} left(frac{nabla^{2} sqrt{f}(xi)}{sqrt{f}(xi)}right) leq d ] Hence, we have: [ boxed{mathrm{E}|xi + nabla ln f(xi) - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} leq d} ] 6. **Proof for ( d geq 3 ):** For the second part, using ( d geq 3 ) and analysis related to problem II.13.69, we get: [ mathrm{E}left|xi + frac{A xi}{xi^top B xi} - mathrm{E} xiright|^{2} = mathrm{E}|xi - mathrm{E} xi|^{2} + 2 mathrm{E} left(frac{(xi - mathrm{E} xi)^top A xi}{xi^top B xi}right) + mathrm{E} left(frac{xi^top A^{2} xi}{(xi^top B xi)^{2}}right) ] Using Stein\'s lemma again, [ mathrm{E}left(frac{(xi - mathrm{E} xi)^top A xi}{xi^top B xi}right) = mathrm{E}left(frac{operatorname{tr} A}{xi^top B xi} - frac{2 xi^top A B xi}{(xi^top B xi)^{2}}right) = -mathrm{E}left(frac{xi^top A^{2} xi}{(xi^top B xi)^{2}}right) ] Thus, the final equality: [ boxed{mathrm{E}left|xi + frac{A xi}{xi^top B xi} - mathrm{E} xiright|^{2} = d - mathrm{E} left(frac{xi^top A^{2} xi}{(xi^top B xi)^{2}}right)} ] Here, [ B = [(operatorname{tr} A) I - 2 A]^{-1} A^{2} ] for any symmetric matrix ( A ) such that ( (operatorname{tr} A) I - 2 A ) is positive definite.

Using the tangent addition formula:    [    tan beta = frac{tan alpha + tan gamma}{1 - tan alpha cdot tan gamma} = tan (alpha + gamma)    ] 7. Therefore, we have:    [    beta = alpha + gamma    ] 8.

In this case, the asymptotes are y = pmsqrt{dfrac{1}{2}}x. 2. As the required hyperbola shares the same asymptotes, it has the same a and b values.

The foci of the ellipse dfrac{y^{2}}{8}{+}dfrac{x^{2}}{2}{=}1 are (0, pm c), where c^2 = a^2 - b^2 = 8 - 2 = 6. Thus, the foci are (0, pmsqrt{6}). 4.

Let\'s denote the vertices of the square as (D) and (E) on side (BC), and (F) and (G) on sides (CA) and (AB), respectively. 2. The objective is to demonstrate that the center (O) of the incircle of triangle (ABC) lies inside the inscribed square (DEFG). To prove this, we will show that (O) cannot lie inside any of the triangles (AFG), (BDG), or (CEF). We use the following lemma as a key step in the proof:  Lemma: If a triangle (PRS) has no obtuse angles at (R) and (S), and a square (RSTU) is constructed such that (RS) is one side of the square and the square lies outside triangle (PRS), then any point (V) on the angle bisector of (angle RPS) within the triangle lies closer to (RS) than to any line outside the square to which (e) is parallel. **Proof of the Lemma:** - Consider any general triangle (PRS) with non-obtuse angles at vertices (R) and (S), and construct square (RSTU) such that (RS) is one of the sides of the square. - Draw angle bisector (PV) where (V) is inside the triangle (PRS). - Since (RSTU) is a convex polygon, any line drawn through the vertices of the triangle within it remains inside the square. - If (V) lies outside the square, the distance of any point on the angle bisector to (e) is greater than the distance to the nearest side of the polygon containing (angle RPS). Applying the lemma to our specific triangles: 1. Triangle (AFG): Since (angle BAC) is acute, (gamma) and (beta) at vertices (F) and (G) respectively, making angles non-obtuse. 2. The angle bisectors of (angle A), (angle B), and (angle C) drawn within the respective sub-triangles (BDG) and (CEF) ensure the point (O) lies strictly inside the square (DEFG).  Conclusion: The incircle\'s center (O) for triangle (ABC) lies within the inscribed square (DEFG), ensuring that no matter the triangle\'s configuration, if it remains acute-angled, the inscribed square will always enclose (O). This process solidifies our argument using geometric properties. Thus, the center of the incircle is contained within the inscribed square. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Factorize the polynomial x^{2}4 to get: ______.","output":"To factorize the polynomial x^{2}-4, we recognize it as a difference of squares.

Since there wasn\'t enough chalk for everyone to have 3 pieces each with the 19 pieces they had, Erika\'s mom had to bring out enough chalk to make up the difference.

We need to determine how many right-angled triangles can be formed by joining any three of its vertices. 2. **Concept of the circle and diameters:**    - A regular 18-sided polygon (18-gon) can be inscribed in a circumcircle.    - For a triangle formed by three vertices of the polygon to be a right-angled triangle, one of its sides must be a diameter of this circumcircle. This is a key concept in geometry, often utilized in problems involving inscribed shapes (Thales\' theorem). 3. **Calculating the number of possible diameters:**    - If the polygon has 18 vertices, each vertex pairs with another to form a diameter.

What can be said about its other angles?","output":"1. **Given Information and Visualization**:      We are given that two angles of a trapezoid are (60^circ) and (120^circ). To analyze these angles, let us note that in any trapezoid, the sum of the angles on the same side (adjacent non-parallel sides) is (180^circ).  2. **Apply Angle Sum Property**:     If we assume the given angles (60^circ) and (120^circ) are adjacent, then their sum should naturally be (180^circ). This is characteristic of a pair of angles between a leg (non-parallel side) of the trapezoid and its parallel bases. 3. **Angle Sum Calculation**:     Let ( alpha ) and ( beta ) be the angles adjacent to one of the non-parallel sides where:     [     alpha = 60^circ quad text{and} quad beta = 120^circ     ]     Therefore,     [     alpha + beta = 60^circ + 120^circ = 180^circ     ]     This confirms that (60^circ) and (120^circ) can indeed be adjacent angles on one pair of non-parallel sides. 4. **Implication for Remaining Angles**:     Given that the sum of adjacent angles along one non-parallel side is (180^circ), this leaves the remaining pair of adjacent angles along the opposite non-parallel side to also sum up to (180^circ) (since the sum of all interior angles of a quadrilateral is always (360^circ)). 5. **Conclusion**:     Hence, the other two angles of the trapezoid can be any pair of angles such that their sum is (180^circ). For example, if the remaining angles are (a) and (b):     [     a + b = 180^circ     ]      Thus, the problem leads to the conclusion that the remaining angles in the trapezoid can be any two angles such that their sum is (180^circ).

Given that the selling price (SP) is Rs. 8337, we can set up the equation: ( 8337 = CP times (1 + 0.20) ) ( 8337 = CP times 1.20 ) Now, to find the cost price (CP), we divide the selling price by 1.20: ( CP = frac{8337}{1.20} ) ( CP = 6947.5 ) So, the cost price of the computer table was Rs. boxed{6947.5} ."},{"instruction":"Thirty students run in a charity race to raise money for the hurricane victims.

How much did each of the ten students raise?","output":"Let\'s denote the amount each of the ten students raised as X. There are 30 students in total, and 10 of them raised X amount each. The remaining 20 students raised 30 each. So the total amount raised by the 20 students who raised 30 each is 20 * 30 = 600. The total amount raised by all the students is 800. The amount raised by the ten students who raised X amount each would be the total amount minus the amount raised by the 20 students. So, 10 * X + 600 = 800. To find X, we subtract 600 from both sides of the equation: 10 * X = 800 - 600, 10 * X = 200. Now, we divide both sides by 10 to find the value of X: X = 200 / 10, X = 20.

The possible values for (a) are 0, 1, or 2, giving us 3 choices. Similarly, the possible values for (b) are 0, 1, or 2, also providing 3 choices. Thus, there are (3 cdot 3 = 9) factors of 36.

A: Quadrant I B: Quadrant II C: Quadrant III D: Quadrant IV","output":"Given the linear function y=kx-k, we are to determine through which quadrant the graph of this function does not pass, given that y decreases as x increases. 1. **Understanding the Slope**: The slope of the linear function is given by k. Since y decreases as x increases, we infer that k < 0. This is because the slope of a line determines its direction: a negative slope means the line goes down as we move from left to right. 2. **Effect of Negative Slope**: With k < 0, the line will indeed pass through Quadrants II and IV because:    - In Quadrant II, both x and y are negative, which aligns with a negative slope.    - In Quadrant IV, x is positive and y is negative, which also aligns with a negative slope. 3. **Intercept with the Y-axis**: The y-intercept of the function is given by y = -k when x = 0. Since k < 0, we have -k > 0, indicating that the y-intercept is positive. This means the graph intersects the positive half of the y-axis, which places part of the graph in Quadrant I. 4. **Conclusion**: Given the above observations, the graph of the function passes through Quadrants I (due to the positive y-intercept), II, and IV (due to the negative slope). It does not pass through Quadrant III because for the graph to be in Quadrant III, both x and y would need to be negative, which contradicts the positive y-intercept.

This implies that the function f(x) is symmetric about the vertical line x=2.  2. **Odd Function Property of y=g(x+1)-2**: Given that y=g(x+1)-2 is an odd function, it satisfies the property g(-x+1)-2 = -(g(x+1)-2). This indicates that the function g(x) is symmetric about the point (1,2). 3. **Relation between f(x) and g(x)**: The equation f(3-x)+g(x-1)=2 can be rewritten by substituting x with 2-x to get f(2-x)+g(x)=2. This shows that g(x) can be expressed in terms of f(x) as g(x) = 2 - f(2-x). This relation implies that f(x) and g(x) are symmetric about the point (1,1). 4. **Symmetry Analysis**: Given the symmetry properties derived above:    - Since f(x) is symmetric about x=2 and g(x) is symmetric about (1,2), and considering their symmetry about (1,1), we deduce that f(x) is also symmetric about x=0 and g(x) is symmetric about x=0. This implies that both f(x) and g(x) are even functions with a period of 4.    - Consequently, their derivatives, {f\'}(x) and {g\'}(x), being the derivatives of even functions that are symmetric about x=0, are odd functions with a period of 4. Evaluating the given options based on the analysis: - **Option A**: Since {f\'}(x) is an odd function with a period of 4, {f\'}(2022) = {f\'}(2) = 0 because the derivative of an even function at its symmetry point is 0. Therefore, option A is correct. - **Option B**: g(2023) = g(3) = g(1). However, without explicit values, we cannot directly conclude g(2023) = 0 based solely on the given information. The correct interpretation should focus on the symmetry and periodicity, which does not directly yield g(2023) = 0. Therefore, option B is not directly supported by the given analysis. - **Option C**: Since f(x) is an even function with a period of 4, it does not satisfy the criteria for being an odd function. Therefore, option C is incorrect. - **Option D**: As established, {g\'}(x) is an odd function with a period of 4. Therefore, option D is correct. Thus, the correct conclusions are options A and D.

There are finitely many such permutations ((2007!)).     3. **Sequence Repetition**:    Since the number of permutations is finite, repeating the operations must eventually lead to a repetition of sequences.

This is a stable configuration for ( N ). 7. **Contradiction**:    If ( N ) stays in the ( N )-th position and cannot move, then no sequence starting with a number greater than ( N ) can exist after this point—which violates the assumption of periodic repetition. This implies our assumption that ( N > 1 ) was incorrect. 8. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, there must eventually be a sequence that starts with the number (1).

Let the midpoints of (BC), (CA), and (AB) be (L), (M), and (N) respectively. Points (P), (Q), and (R) are on the rays (OL), (OM), and (ON) respectively so that (angle OPA = angle OAL), (angle OQB = angle OBM), and (angle ORC = angle OCN). To show: (AP), (BQ), and (CR) meet at a point. 1. **Showing circumcircle of triangle (ABC) is an incircle of triangle (PQR):**    Let\'s start by considering the tangents to the circumcircle of triangle (ABC) at (B) and (C), and let them meet at (P\'). Similarly, let the tangents at (A) and (C) meet at (Q\'), and the tangents at (A) and (B) meet at (R\'):        Since these tangents meet pairwise, they form triangle (P\'Q\'R\') with the circumcircle of (ABC) as the incircle.    We need to show:     angle OP\'A = angle OAL,    as this would imply that (P\' = P). 2. **Projecting the problem onto the circumcircle:**    Consider the point (K) where (LP\') meets the circumcircle (Omega) at another point (K).    By the tangent-secant theorem:     angle KCP\' = angle KBC = angle KCB,     because (P\'C) is tangent to (Omega) at (C) and (KBC) lies on (Omega). 3. ** Exploring the angles at point (K):**    Since (L) is the midpoint of (BC) and (KO perp BC), we have:     angle KBC = angle KCL     meaning:     angle KCP\' = angle KCL         Therefore, (KC) bisects (angle P\'CL). 4. **Equality of similar segments:**    The bisector theorem provides:     frac{KP\'}{KL} = frac{CP\'}{CL} quad text{and obviously} quad frac{CP\'}{CL} = frac{BP\'}{BL}         Thus, we find points (K, C,) and (B) on the **circle of Apollonius**, which ensures that segments divide angles proportionally:     XP\'/XL = text{constant for any} , X in (B, C, K)         Therefore, (A) also lies on the circle of Apollonius:     angle OAL = angle OP\'A  5. **Concluding the concurrenc**:    Since (angle OPA = angle OAL) we have (P\' = P). Hence, (AP), (BQ), and (CR) concur at a single point by Ceva\'s Theorem, since:     frac{AR}{AQ} cdot frac{CQ}{CP} cdot frac{BP}{BR} = 1    given the tangents from (R) to points (A, Q) and from (Q) to points (C, P) , and from (P) to (B, R) are equal respectively.

First, let\'s find the remainder of x when divided by 22. We know that when x is divided by 126, the remainder is 37. This means that x can be expressed as: x = 126k + 37 where k is some integer.

For which values of ( m ) and ( n ) is this possible?","output":"# Problem: Given a board of dimensions (m times n) where (m, n > 15), it is cut into shapes made up of ten unit squares each (the shapes can be rotated and flipped). For which values of (m) and (n) is this possible? To solve this problem, we need to determine for which dimensions (m) and (n) the (m times n) board can be partitioned into shapes comprising exactly ten unit squares each.  1. **Divisibility by 10**:     - Since each shape consists of 10 squares, the total number of squares on the board, (mn), must be divisible by 10. Thus, either (m) or (n) (or both) must be divisible by 2 and 5. In other words, among (m) and (n), one must be divisible by 2 (even) and one must be divisible by 5. 2. **Divisibility by 4**:     - Now, we need to ensure that the board can be properly partitioned into rectangular sections that can be covered by the 10-unit shapes. We will show that one of (m) or (n) must be divisible by 4. Suppose this is not true. Let us draw horizontal and vertical lines through the board at intervals of 2 cells, starting from the top and left edges of the board. This will divide the board into (2 times 2) squares, and possibly strips of (2 times 1) rectangles if (n) is odd.     - Consider a strip of (2 times n) cut by these lines. Let\'s color this strip in a checkerboard pattern using black and white colors. In such a strip, if (n) is not divisible by 4, the number of black (or white) cells will not be equal in any two adjacent strips (2 times n). For instance, if (n = 4k + r) where (r = 1, 2, 3) (remainder), the difference will be evident when colored in a checkerboard fashion. 3. **Even Distribution**:     - Consider the composition of a shape formed by ten unit cells. This means that the composition of white and black cells in each column will not balance out to an equal number of black and white cells:     [     underbrace{10 text{ cells}}_{text{shape}} = underbrace{5 text{ black cells}} + underbrace{5 text{ white cells}}     ]     - Therefore, if there are rows and columns in such a manner, the (m times n) grid must have an even partition that respects this distribution (i.e., contains equal numbers of each color in every possible partition). 4. **Contradiction Approach**:     - Drawing from a mathematical contradiction proof:         - Suppose neither (m) nor (n) is divisible by 4 (both are odd multiples of 2 but not 4).          - The horizontal lines at 2-cell intervals will create inconsistencies in black and white cell counts across stripes horizontally and vertically. 5. **Concluding Criterion**:     - The above contradiction illustrates that for a consistent, balanced partition, allowing for (5 times 4) layouts repeatedly (rectangular regions that can fit such 10-unit shapes perfectly):         [         boxed{text{Among (m) and (n), one must be divisible by 4 and the other by 5.}}         ]     - General dimensions will then be multiples of these standards allowing manageable segment partitions into (4 times 5) sections. For arbitrary large (m, n > 15), this ensures every possible partition works out equally.

We need to find the ratio (frac{g\'}{g}) in terms of (N). 2. **Centripetal acceleration**: The centripetal acceleration (a_c) is given by:    [    a_c = frac{v^2}{L}    ]    where (v) is the tangential velocity and (L) is the length of the corridor. 3. **Initial and final centripetal accelerations**: Let (v_1) be the initial tangential velocity and (v_2) be the final tangential velocity. Then:    [    g = frac{v_1^2}{L} quad text{and} quad g\' = frac{v_2^2}{L}    ]    Therefore, the ratio of the accelerations is:    [    frac{g\'}{g} = frac{frac{v_2^2}{L}}{frac{v_1^2}{L}} = frac{v_2^2}{v_1^2}    ] 4. **Relating tangential velocity to angular velocity**: The tangential velocity (v) is related to the angular velocity (omega) by:    [    v = Lomega    ]    Thus:    [    frac{g\'}{g} = frac{(Lomega_2)^2}{(Lomega_1)^2} = left(frac{omega_2}{omega_1}right)^2    ] 5. **Conservation of angular momentum**: Since no external torques act on the system, the angular momentum is conserved. Let (I_1) and (I_2) be the moments of inertia before and after the astronauts move. Then:    [    I_1omega_1 = I_2omega_2    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{omega_2}{omega_1} = frac{I_1}{I_2}    ] 6. **Calculating moments of inertia**: Initially, each module has (N) astronauts, so the total moment of inertia is:    [    I_1 = 2 times (mN L^2) = 2mNL^2    ]    After two astronauts move to the hub, each module has (N-1) astronauts, so the new moment of inertia is:    [    I_2 = 2 times (m(N-1) L^2) = 2m(N-1)L^2    ] 7. **Substituting moments of inertia**:    [    frac{omega_2}{omega_1} = frac{I_1}{I_2} = frac{2mNL^2}{2m(N-1)L^2} = frac{N}{N-1}    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{g\'}{g} = left(frac{omega_2}{omega_1}right)^2 = left(frac{N}{N-1}right)^2    ] 8. **Conclusion**:    [    boxed{left(frac{N}{N-1}right)^2}    ]"},{"instruction":"There is a box containing 23 regular dice, each with numbers from 1 to 6 on its faces.

The magnitude of a complex number and its conjugate are always the same. If m is the number of magnitudes |r_i| that correspond to nonreal roots, then f(x) must have at least 2m nonreal roots. This implies that f(x) can have at most 2010 - 2m real roots. Moreover, this implies that there are 1008 - m magnitudes corresponding to real roots.

According to the proposition, there has to be at least one value of a within the interval [2, 4] for which the inequality holds. Thus, we need to consider the endpoints of this interval because if the inequality holds at an endpoint, it must also hold for some values within the interval. That leads to two inequalities: 1. When a = 2, it yields 2(x^2 + x) - 3x - 3 > 0, which simplifies to 2x^2 - x - 3 > 0. 2. When a = 4, it yields 4(x^2 + x) - 3x - 3 > 0, which simplifies to 4x^2 + x - 3 > 0. Now, we need to solve each inequality to find the range of x for which each holds: For the first inequality 2x^2 - x - 3 > 0, we can factor it or use the quadratic formula to find its roots. Factoring gives (2x + 3)(x - 1) > 0. This leads to two roots: x = -frac{3}{2} and x = 1. Analyzing the intervals, we determine that the solution to this inequality is x < -frac{3}{2} or x > 1. For the second inequality 4x^2 + x - 3 > 0, we can also factor it to get (4x - 3)(x + 1) > 0. This leads to two roots: x = frac{3}{4} and x = -1. The solution to this inequality is thus x < -1 or x > frac{3}{4}. Taking the union of these two solutions, because only one needs to be true for the given proposition to hold, we get the range of x as (-infty, -1) cup (frac{3}{4}, +infty). Thus, we can express the final solution as: [ x in (-infty, -1) cup left(frac{3}{4}, +inftyright) ] Hence, the range of the real number x for which the proposition is true is (-infty, -1) cup left(frac{3}{4}, +inftyright).

Similarly, we denote by d_A, d_B, d_C, d_D the perpendicular distances from M to the faces BCD, ACD, ABD, and ABC respectively. 2. **Use of known inequality**:    We\'ll utilize the known inequality in reference to the problem 118 (a), which can be restated as follows for any vertex A:        S_A R_A geq S_B d_B + S_C d_C + S_D d_D,        where S_A, S_B, S_C, S_D denote the areas of the faces opposite the respective vertices. 3. **Application of the AM-GM inequality**:    Applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality to the above, we get:        S_A R_A geq 3 sqrt[3]{S_B S_C S_D d_B d_C d_D}.     4. **Repeating for other vertices**:    Applying the same step for the other vertices, we produce similar inequalities:        S_B R_B geq 3 sqrt[3]{S_A S_C S_D d_A d_C d_D},            S_C R_C geq 3 sqrt[3]{S_A S_B S_D d_A d_B d_D},            S_D R_D geq 3 sqrt[3]{S_A S_B S_C d_A d_B d_C}.     5. **Combining the inequalities**:    Multiplying all these inequalities together, we obtain:        S_A S_B S_C S_D R_A R_B R_C R_D geq 81 sqrt[3]{(S_A S_B S_C S_D)^3 (d_A d_B d_C d_D)^3}     6. **Simplification**:    Simplifying the right-hand side of the above inequality, we get:        81 (S_A S_B S_C S_D) d_A d_B d_C d_D        Therefore, this leads to:        S_A S_B S_C S_D R_A R_B R_C R_D geq 81 S_A S_B S_C S_D d_A d_B d_C d_D     7. **Cancelling common terms**:    Removing S_A S_B S_C S_D from both sides, we derive the required inequality:        R_A R_B R_C R_D geq 81 d_A d_B d_C d_D.     8. **Condition for equality**:    The equality holds if and only if S_A d_A = S_B d_B = S_C d_C = S_D d_D, which means that V_{M B C D} = V_{M A C D} = V_{M A B D} = V_{M A B C} and M is the centroid of the tetrahedron.

Proof of Right Triangle:     [     (XZ)^2 + (AZ)^2 = frac{1}{3} AB^2 + frac{1}{9} AC^2 = frac{4}{9} AB^2 = (AX)^2     ]    Thus proving ( angle AXZ = 90^circ ). Likewise, for ( triangle BYX ) and ( triangle CYZ ):     [     angle BYC = angle CYZ = 90^circ     ] 7. **Subset Distribution**:     Points ( X, Y, Z ) must be distributed in such a way that at least two points belong to the same subset, either ( S_1 ) or ( S_2 ).     Assume, without loss of generality, that ( {X, Y} subseteq S_1 ).  8. **Verification**:          Given XY is parallel to AB. From the earlier assumption that any three vertices cannot be in the same set:     [     AB text{ contains no other points from } S_1 text{ except for } X.     ]     Any additional point ( W in S_1 ) on ( AB ) would mean      [     {X, Y, W} text{ forms a triangle with a 90-degree vertex in } S_1,     ]     Contradicting our initial assumption. Thus, the points on AB that belong to ( S_2 ) do not include ( C ) on ( S_2 ). 9. **Conclusion**:     If C and Z do not belong to ( S_2 ), they must belong to ( S_1 ).     Therefore, we have:     [     {C, Z, Y} subseteq S_1     ]     This leads to the conclusion that:     ( {C, Z, Y} ) forms a right triangle, contradicting our contrarian assumption.  # Conclusion: Thus proving that: [ boxed{text{At least one of the subsets contains a right-angled triangle.}} ]"},{"instruction":"A rectangular piece of paper, 8 inches by 6 inches, is folded in half horizontally.

For l_2: (k-1)x + (2k+3)y - 2 = 0, the slope m_2 is -frac{k-1}{2k+3}. Setting the product of the slopes equal to -1 gives us the equation: (-frac{k}{1-k})(-frac{k-1}{2k+3}) = -1. Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get: frac{k(k-1)}{(1-k)(2k+3)} = -1. Cross multiplying to clear the denominators gives: k(k-1) = -(1-k)(2k+3). Expanding both sides leads to: k^2 - k = -2k^2 - 3k + 2k + 3. Combining like terms and bringing all terms to one side: 3k^2 - 2k - 3 = 0. Factoring the left-hand side: (3k + 1)(k - 3) = 0.

Let\'s reconstruct and expand this solution in detail. **Given answer: For ( n = 3k + 1 ), where ( k ) is a natural number.** 1. **Setup and Definitions:**    We begin by numbering the rows and columns of the grid ( 1, 2, ldots, n ). A cell is then denoted by ( (a, b) ) where ( a ) is the row number and ( b ) is the column number. 2. **Counterexamples for ( n = 3k ) and ( n = 3k + 2 ):**    - **For ( n = 3k ):**      Here, we can mark all cells in rows whose indices give a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. For example, in a ( 6 times 6 ) grid, the rows with indices 2 and 5 will be marked.

In a ( 5 times 5 ) grid, the rows with indices 3, and 6 are marked.       Similarly, the knight cannot traverse unmarked cells without hitting a marked cell. It evaluates similarly discouraging traversal from ( L ) to ( R ). 3. **Inductive Proof for ( n = 3k + 1 ):**    - Base case: For ( n = 4 ) (i.e., ( k = 1 )):          If neither of the cells ( (2, 3) ) nor ( (3, 2) ) is marked, the knight can traverse through one:            [      L to (3, 2) to R       ]            This is not allowed since it would negate the initial condition. Hence, one of these cells must be marked, satisfying that at least two of the three diagonally arranged cells in any path are marked.    - Inductive step: Assume true for ( n = 3(k-1) + 1 = 3k-2 ):          Consider ( n = 3k + 1 ). Assume any three consecutive diagonal cells have at most one marked cell. This contradicts our knight\'s path rule.      Denote cells by ( (a, b) ) and extended diagonal ( (a + 3(k-1), b + 3(k-1)) = (a^prime, b^prime) ). Suppose all such indexed cells aren\'t marked, students can\'t traverse ( (a, b) ) to ( (a^prime, b^prime) ).      - Consider cell ( (3^prime, 2^prime) ) must be marked; otherwise,         [        L to (3, 2) to (3^prime, 2^prime) to R         ]        breaks the condition.      - By similar logic for ( (4,4) ) and other cross-index cells, each extending ( k ) diagonal steps verified marks needed progressiveness across larger ( n ) frames.

So, its area is: Area of road 1 = Length × Width = 80 m × 10 m = 800 m² The road parallel to the breadth (60 m) is also 10 m wide, but we must subtract the width of the first road to avoid double counting the area where the roads intersect.

This implies ( BD = AP ). The properties of congruence and symmetry help simplify the relationships among distances. 5. **Summing Up Constraints**:    - Given ( BD = PA ) and ( PA = PB + PC ), combining these relationships implies points ( B, P, ) and ( D ) are collinear.

When a=2, we have the function f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 3. This can be rewritten as f(x) = -(x - 1)^2 + 4.

Therefore, the interval of monotonic increase for f(x) is:     boxed{ (-infty, 1] }  2. If f(x) is an even function, we have that f(-x) = f(x) for all x in the domain. By this property, and comparing the function expression with the definition of even functions, we can deduce that a must be zero (since the term ax would not satisfy the even property unless a=0).    Thus, we have the function f(x) = -x^2 + 3. Observing that this is a downward-opening parabola with the vertex at (0,3), we can conclude that f(x) is increasing on the interval [-1,0) and decreasing on the interval (0,3]. The vertex at x=0 corresponds to the maximum value of f(x) over the specified interval, which is f(0) = 3. To find the minimum value, we evaluate f(x) at the endpoints of the interval [-1,3].

This conclusion stems from the fact that the polygon’s structure ensures every side has a counterpart that runs parallel to it.    - Let\'s define one side of the polygon as ( AB ). Draw a line perpendicular to ( AB ). This line ensures the perpendicularity and maintains all provided vertices on one side. 3. **Defining the structure using ( AB ):**    - Each side ( AB ) and pairs of opposite sides will be identified step-wise.

Using these vectors, ensure side lengths or directional vectors ( vec{v}(EF) ) (where ( x_{EF}, y_{EF} ) represent the coordinate pairs) are minimized.    - Here ( gcd(x_{EF}, y_{EF}) = 1 ) must hold, ensuring minimal integer values. 7. **Area considerations:**    - The total area could be expressed through lattice parallelogram area calculations: ( S(P) = |x(AB)y(CD) - x(CD)y(AB)| ) yielding an expression ensuring a ( boxed{5} ). 8. **Minimizing the resultant ( C ):**    - Break down the 14-gon into smaller quadrilateral shapes.

Compute the number of possible values that Svitlana can obtain by doing zero or more operations.","output":"We start by noting that Svitlana initially writes the number 147 on the blackboard. 1. **Initial Representation of 147 in Binary:**     - The binary representation of 147 is:     [     147 = 10010011_2     ]     This is derived from the sum of powers of 2:     [     147 = 2^7 + 2^4 + 2^1 + 2^0     ] 2. **Understanding the Operations:**     - **Operation 1 (if ( n ) is even):** Replace ( n ) with ( frac{n}{2} ).     - **Operation 2 (if ( n ) is odd):** Replace ( n ) with ( frac{n+255}{2} ).     - **Operation 3 (if ( n geq 64 )):** Replace ( n ) with ( n - 64 ). 3. **Binary Representation Constraints:**     - Each operation acts on the binary representation of ( n ).     - **Operation 1** shifts all bits to the right, effectively dividing by 2.     - **Operation 2** also shifts bits but starts by adding a large binary number (which ends in all 1s, similar to padding zeros but complicating calculation). This operation adds ( 8 ) to ( n ), making it even, then divides by ( 2 ). So, if ( n ) is ( n_{odd} = Aldots 1 ), then ( frac{n+255}{2} ) is shifting ( A ldots 10ldots 01 ). 4. **Maximal Binary Number Analysis:**     - The operations do not increase the count of ones in the binary representation.     - Starting from ( 147 = 10010011_2 ), the total number of ones is ( 4 ): ( 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 ). 5. **Working with the Binary Representation:**     - Using the operations, we can shuffle the positions of ones due to the binary properties of shifting and subtraction.     - To find upper limit values that can be represented, consider the binary strings:       - Any integer with at most the same or fewer bits of ones, up to the originial total. 6. **Combinatorial Enumeration:**     - We need to derive all possible integers with combinations of fewer than or equal to 4 ones out of a representation of an 8-bit number.     - Combinations of ones’ positions among 8 bits:       [       sum_{i=0}^{4} binom{8}{i}       ]     - Calculating:       [       binom{8}{0} = 1        binom{8}{1} = 8        binom{8}{2} = 28        binom{8}{3} = 56        binom{8}{4} = 70       ]     - Summing these:       [       1 + 8 + 28 + 56 + 70 = 163       ] Thus, the number of possible values that Svitlana can obtain by doing zero or more operations is: [ boxed{163} ]"},{"instruction":"Let m geq 2 be an integer, A a finite set of integers, and B_{1}, B_{2}, ldots, B_{m} subsets of A.

Each element in ( A ) must contribute to the total sum at least once. Since ( |A| geqslant n ) (where ( n ) represents the cardinality of ( A )), we must have: [ sum_{x in A} x leq S ] However, since ( A ) can contain negative numbers and others, the least number requirement for the elements is centered on the ( m )-power requirement constraints of the ( B_k ) sums.  Step 5: Logical Compulsion for the Number of Elements Given that the different powers ( m^k ) have specific values, the remanence that leads to fulfilling ( |A| ) sufficient to cover these sums is shown to constrain ( A ).

The grouping is arbitrary but ensures we have at least one set with an odd number of points for initial pairing. 2. **Step 2:** Consider the group of five points. According to the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, any five points in the plane with no three collinear always contain a subset of four points that form a convex quadrilateral. Label these vertices as (A, B, C,) and (D). 3. **Step 3:** In a convex quadrilateral (ABCD), the diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect within the quadrilateral (since any pair of points inside a convex shape will always intersect). Therefore, (AC) and (BD) intersect. 4. **Step 4:** The fifth point that remained unpaired from the initial set of five points will be combined with one of the groups of four, forming a new group of five points. Repeat the procedure from Step 2 on this new group. 5. **Step 5:** Continue the process for each initial group of four points:    - Select four points to form a convex quadrilateral.    - Pair the points across the diagonals of this quadrilateral to ensure intersection. 6. **Step 6:** After performing these steps for each four-point set and ensuring intersection of diagonals, eventually, you will have paired almost all points.

Applying the functional property to x = x_2 and y = -x_1 leads to the following chain of inequalities: begin{align*} f(x_2-x_1) + 2 &= f(x_2) + f(-x_1)  f(x_2-x_1) &> 2  f(x_2) + f(-x_1) &> 4. end{align*} Next, we find the value of the function at the point x=0 by choosing x=y=0, which gives us f(0)=2.

This can occur in two ways: either drawing a Chinese book first and then a math book (AB), or drawing a math book first and then another math book (overline{A}B).    - We already calculated P(AB) = frac{1}{2} times frac{2}{3}.    - For P(overline{A}B), the probability of drawing a math book first is frac{2}{4} or frac{1}{2}, and then drawing another math book from the remaining 3 books (1 math book left) is frac{1}{3}.

Let\'s calculate the discount amount: 10% of 140 = 0.10 * 140 = 14 Now, let\'s subtract the discount from the initial cost: 140 - 14 = 126 Next, we need to add the cost of the additional insurance coverage, which is 5 per day. For 4 days, this would be: 4 days * 5/day = 20 Adding the insurance cost to the discounted rental cost gives us: 126 + 20 = 146 Now we know that the cost of the rental and insurance without the mileage charge is 146. The total invoice Maria received was 192.50, so the cost for the miles driven is the difference between the total invoice and the cost of rental and insurance: 192.50 - 146 = 46.50 This 46.50 is the amount charged for the miles driven at a rate of 0.09 per mile.

Thus, we have:    [    binom{9}{2} = frac{9 times 8}{2 times 1} = 36    ] 3. **Count the number of ways to choose 2 squares that share an edge**:     - **Horizontal pairs**: There are 3 rows, and each row has 2 pairs of adjacent squares. Thus, there are (3 times 2 = 6) horizontal pairs.    - **Vertical pairs**: Similarly, there are 3 columns, and each column has 2 pairs of adjacent squares.

To analyze the problem, consider a graph where the vertices are terminals, and the edges are resistances.  2. Note that between vertices (A) and (B), there cannot be a path consisting of fewer than nine edges. The reason is that if all edges of such a path were short-circuited, we would get a short circuit between terminals (A) and (B). 3. Additionally, for any nine edges, there must exist a path from (A) to (B) that does not pass through these edges. By Menger\'s theorem, this implies that there must be at least 10 edge-disjoint paths from (A) to (B). 4. Since each path consists of at least 10 edges, we can conclude that there are at least 100 edges (resistances) total. Based on this analysis: - **Menger\'s theorem** states that for any two non-adjacent vertices in a graph, the minimum number of vertices to remove to disconnect the vertices is equal to the maximum number of pairwise disjoint paths between the vertices. - Hence, by ensuring at least 10 edge-disjoint paths with each having at least 10 edges, we maintain connectivity between (A) and (B) despite the failure of any nine edges. # Constructing the Circuit: Here is an example of a circuit with 100 resistors: - Construct 10 paths, each containing exactly 10 resistors in series, from terminal (A) to terminal (B).

The distance formula from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Applying this to our case: [ r = frac{|a + 0 + 2sqrt{2}|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|a + 2sqrt{2}|}{sqrt{2}} ] The circle also passes through point (0, -2), which provides another equation: [ (0 - a)^{2} + (-2)^{2} = r^{2} ] [ a^{2} + 4 = r^{2} ] We have a system of equations: [ begin{cases} a^{2} + 4 = r^{2}  frac{|a + 2sqrt{2}|}{sqrt{2}} = r end{cases} ] Solving this system, we find a = 0 or a = 4sqrt{2} (but a = 4sqrt{2} is discarded because a leqslant 0). Thus, a = 0, and substituting a = 0 into a^{2} + 4 = r^{2} gives r^{2} = 4. Therefore, the standard equation of circle M is: [ x^{2} + y^{2} = 4 ]  Part (2): Finding the Equation of Line l Let the equation of line l be y = kx + 1. The distance from the center of circle M to line l is given by: [ frac{|0 + 0 + 1|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} ] Since the length of chord AB is given by the formula 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}, where d is the distance from the center to the line, we have: [ |AB| = 2sqrt{4 - frac{1}{k^2 + 1}} = sqrt{14} ] Squaring both sides to solve for k^2: [ 14 = 4 - frac{1}{k^2 + 1} ] [ k^2 + 1 = frac{1}{4 - 14} = -frac{1}{10} ] This gives us k^2 = 1.

The midpoints of these edges are P and Q respectively, and PQ has length k.  To find the upper bounds on the surface area and volume of the tetrahedron, we perform the following steps: 1. **Volume Calculation:**    - Construct a parallelepiped circumscribed around the tetrahedron, with parallel planes aligned along the endpoints of the edges. One face of this parallelepiped holds the edge AB of length a as a diagonal, and another diagonal on the same face being of length b. Hence, the area of this face can be written as:    [    frac{1}{2} ab sin varphi    ]    where varphi is the angle between the diagonals. 2. **Volume of the Parallelepiped:**    - The volume V_P of the circumscribed parallelepiped is three times the volume of the tetrahedron (3V). Recognizing that the height of this parallelepiped relative to the face described above is m, we get:    [    V_P = frac{1}{2}ab sin varphi cdot m    ]    Given that m leq k (height constraint) and sin varphi leq 1, we have:    [    3V = frac{1}{2}ab sin varphi cdot m leq frac{1}{2}ab cdot k    ]    From which it follows that:    [    V leq frac{abk}{6}    ] Thus, the maximum volume is:    [    V = frac{abk}{6} text{ if and only if } sin varphi = 1 text{ and } m = k    ]    concluding that the volume of the tetrahedron is:    [    V = frac{abk}{6}    ] 3. **Surface Area Calculation:**    - Notice that the tetrahedron’s surface consists of four triangular faces, two of them containing the edge AB (length a) and the other two containing the edge CD (length b). 4. **Triangle Areas:**    - Each of these triangles has a height related to its corresponding sides. The maximum height related to any side in a triangle is limited by the length of the median to that side. The area of a triangle can be expressed as:    [    text{Area} leq frac{1}{2} cdot text{side} cdot text{median}    ] 5. **Summation for Surface Area (A):**    - Using notations x, y, r, s for medians relevant to the triangular faces with sides a and b respectively, we write:    [    A le frac{a(x + y)}{2} + frac{b(r + s)}{2}    ] 6. **Using Cosine Theorem in Triangles PQD and PQC:**    [    x^2 = k^2 + frac{b^2}{4} - kb cos alpha    ]    [    y^2 = k^2 + frac{b^2}{4} + kb cos alpha    ] Adding these:    [    x^2 + y^2 = 2 left(k^2 + frac{b^2}{4}right)    ] 7. **Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality for x and y medians:**    - Applying the inequality:    [    frac{x + y}{2} leq sqrt{frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}}    ]    results in:    [    frac{x + y}{2} leq sqrt{k^2 + frac{b^2}{4}}    ] 8. **Similarly, for r and s:**    [    frac{r + s}{2} leq sqrt{k^2 + frac{a^2}{4}}    ] 9. **Final Surface Area Relation:**    [    A leq a sqrt{k^2 + frac{b^2}{4}} + b sqrt{k^2 + frac{a^2}{4}}    ] Solving, equality is reached if all medians act perpendicular (x = y, r = s) and maximum value achieves for the described conditions.

The initial segment from 360^circ to 420^circ and the segment from 480^circ to 540^circ also measure 60^circ each, confirming the repeating nature of the ratio. The ratio of segment lengths within a complete cycle (between angles satisfying sin x = sin 60^circ) are equal, as our analysis shows intervals of 60^circ. Thus, we have segments of equal lengths, implying p = q. Included in the periodic repetition, the consistent segment ratio is 1:1, leading to the ratio: [(p, q) = (1, 1)] Conclusion: Since p = q = 1, our calculations have shown that all intervals repeat uniformly at 60^circ, leading to the segments having equal lengths, which means (p, q) = boxed{(1, 1)}."},{"instruction":"f text{A}*text{B} means frac{text{A}+text{B}}{2} and A^{#} means A^2 + 1, find (4^{#}*6)*9.

Initially, banks were local entities issuing their own currency, backed by gold and silver reserves. This era was characterized by a lack of standardization, leading to a confusing array of banknotes in circulation. The Civil War era brought significant change with the introduction of national currency (greenbacks) and the establishment of a national banking system. This move standardized currency and began the process of centralizing banking practices. The creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 further centralized control, introducing a more stable banking system with the ability to lend to banks in financial trouble and manage the nation\'s monetary policy. The Great Depression of the 1930s prompted additional reforms, notably the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure bank deposits, which restored public confidence in the banking system. In the mid-20th century, the U.S.\'s departure from the gold standard marked a significant shift in monetary policy. Throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, banking has been transformed by technological advancements. The rise of digital banking, online transactions, and fintech has significantly changed how banks operate and how customers interact with financial institutions. This period has also seen further regulation and deregulation, aimed at promoting financial stability and innovation. From issuing their own paper money to embracing the digital age, banks have moved from being merely places to safeguard money to becoming integral parts of a complex financial system that supports economic growth and innovation.

Stephanie Brown, Tim Drake, Jason Todd, Damian Wayne, and Cassandra Cain stood in a semicircle, each wearing an expression that ranged from utter disbelief to bemused curiosity. Center stage in this tableau of confusion was, incredibly, a small, fluffy black rabbit with striking blue eyes. But it wasn\'t just any rabbit. Oh no. This one was different. It somehow possessed an unmistakable air of... familiarity. And if you looked closely, really closely, you might notice a tuft of fur atop its head that bore an uncanny resemblance to Dick Grayson\'s well-coiffed hair. \\"This... is something else...\\" Tim whispered, stealing a glance at his companions. Their mission debrief had taken an unexpected turn, to say the least. Stephanie, ever the optimist, crouched down for a closer look, while Jason crossed his arms, fighting the urge to smirk. Damian simply scowled, his default response to the inexplicable. Cassandra, on the other hand, looked on with a rare hint of amusement dancing in her eyes. The tension in the room was almost palpable until the rabbit—this small, improbable creature in their midst—opened its mouth to speak. The voice that emerged was unmistakably Dick\'s, albeit several octaves higher and unmistakably more... bunny-like. \\"...Uh... hi, guys. It\'s me,\\" the rabbit said, its voice a soft, fluffy echo in the vast Batcave. A collective silence followed, each member of the Bat-Family processing this surreal revelation in their own way. \\"Dick?\\" Stephanie finally managed, eyes wide with surprise. \\"Is that really you?\\" \\"In the fur,\\" the rabbit replied with a hint of his usual charm, somehow managing to offer what appeared to be a sheepish grin despite his current, um, limitations. \\"How...?\\" Tim started, only to shake his head in disbelief. The world of magic was not unknown to them, but this was unlike anything they had encountered before. \\"It\'s a long story,\\" Rabbit-Dick began, his whiskers twitching slightly with each word. \\"But it involves a mix-up with Zatanna, a magic show gone awry, and a very specific spell. I\'d appreciate it if we could jump straight to finding a solution. No pun intended.\\" Jason finally let out a laugh. \\"You\'ve got to be kidding me. This is priceless!\\" Damian rolled his eyes. \\"Only Grayson would manage to get himself turned into a rabbit.\\" Cassandra simply nodded, a smile playing at the edges of her lips. As the initial shock wore off, the Bat-Family rallied around their long-eared companion. They were a team, after all, and not even the most bizarre magic could change that. Embarking on a quest to return their brother to his human form, they found themselves navigating the oddities of magical realms, consulting with sorcerers, and deciphering ancient spells. Through it all, Rabbit-Dick offered guidance, humor, and the occasional motivational speech—albeit in a decidedly high-pitched tone. The adventure that followed would be one for the history books, not just because of its unusual nature, but because it underscored the unbreakable bond they shared.

I want to change this to make one sub event class per type, so for example here: SDL_KeyboardEvent SDL_KEYDOWN SDL_KEYUP I would make 2 sub event classes, KeyboardKeyDownEvent and KeyboardKeyUpEvent, and then I would handle them in two different methods: And the usage would be like this: InputManager(EventManager& eventManager) { // Subscribe to specific event types eventManager.Subscribe<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>([this](std::shared_ptr<Event> event){ this->HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>(event)); }); eventManager.Subscribe<KeyboardKeyUpEvent>([this](std::shared_ptr<Event> event){ this->HandleKeyboardKeyUpEvent(std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyUpEvent>(event)); }); } void HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::shared_ptr<KeyboardEvent> event) { // Process the keyboard down event } void HandleKeyboardKeyUpEvent(std::shared_ptr<KeyboardEvent> event) { // Process the keyboard down event } Is this a good design or not?","output":"Your approach to breaking down SDL\'s event types into individual classes for each event type (like `KeyboardKeyDownEvent` and `KeyboardKeyUpEvent`) is a good design for several reasons: 1. **Type Safety:** By defining separate classes for different event types, you leverage C++\'s strong type system. This makes your event handling code clearer and less prone to errors, as you can\'t accidentally use a keyboard event where a mouse event is expected, for example. 2. **Extensibility:** With each event type being a separate class, it\'s easy to add new event types or modify existing ones without risking the stability of other event handlers. This makes your EventManager and the system as a whole more adaptable to future requirements or changes in SDL itself. 3. **Cleaner Code:** Your code becomes more readable and maintainable. Each event handler is explicitly designed for its purpose, and it\'s clear from the subscription code what type of events a particular subscriber cares about. This explicit nature is beneficial during both development and maintenance phases. 4. **Flexibility in Handling Events:** Some events might require additional data or behavior. Having separate classes allows you to elegantly incorporate these requirements without cluttering a monolithic event class with conditional logic or rarely used member variables. 5. **Performance Consideration:** If your game or engine performance is critical, having separate classes could potentially lead to more efficient handlers since each handler deals with only one event type. The overhead of handling type differentiation is moved to compile time (through templates) rather than runtime. However, there are also considerations to keep in mind: - **Template Complexity:** The use of templates and `std::function` for subscribing handlers can introduce complexity, especially if the error messages become less clear or if you encounter challenges with template instantiation. Make sure the benefits outweigh these potential complexities for your team or project. - **Event Class Proliferation:** Depending on the number of different event types SDL supports and how many of them you plan to use, you might end up with a large number of small classes. While this is not inherently bad, it does increase the number of files and classes you need to manage. Ensure your project\'s structure and naming conventions are well-organized to handle this gracefully. - **Memory Considerations:** Using `std::shared_ptr` for events is generally fine and ensures easy memory management, especially if events are passed around or stored. However, be mindful of unnecessary copying or circular references that could lead to memory leaks. In summary, your design choice aligns well with modern C++ best practices and can lead to a clean, flexible, and maintainable codebase. Keep the considerations in mind and ensure your implementation details, like template usage and class structure, are handled judiciously to get the most out of this design."},{"instruction":"OK yeah I can see the class proliferation now, this is the structure I am planning, as you can see there are tons of classes but I think all of these are needed if I want to support every type of event and be future-proof if I add more things to my project like Touch support, what do you think about this?

While the structure promises highly readable, maintainable, and extendable code, managing the proliferation of classes indeed requires careful consideration. Here are some thoughts and potential strategies for working with this extensive design: # 1. Modularization With a significant number of event classes, ensuring your project is well-organized becomes crucial. Consider grouping related event classes into appropriate modules or namespaces. For example, all joystick-related events could be under a `JoystickEvents` namespace or module. This not only helps in managing the code but also in understanding the event system\'s structure at a glance. # 2. Factory Pattern Depending on how events are instantiated and dispatched, a factory pattern might help manage the creation of event objects. This could be especially useful if events need to be created from SDL events dynamically, as it abstracts the instantiation logic into a single location and helps with maintaining the code when new event types are added. # 3. Documentation With a wide variety of event types, comprehensive documentation becomes indispensable. Ensure that each event class and its intended use case are well-documented. This not only helps current development efforts but also ensures that future developers, or even future you, can easily understand and work with the event system. # 4. Performance Considerations Given the use of `std::shared_ptr` for events and a potentially large number of event objects, keep an eye on the performance impact, especially in high-frequency event scenarios like `SDL_MOUSEMOTION`. In most cases, the overhead will be negligible, but it\'s something to keep in mind and profile, particularly for performance-critical applications. # 5. Template Metaprogramming Your event subscription mechanism uses templates, which is a powerful feature of C++. However, template metaprogramming can introduce complexity and obscure errors. Ensure that the template usage is as clean and simple as possible, and consider providing clear error messages or static assertions to aid in debugging template-related issues. # 6. Refactoring and Extensibility While your current design aims to be future-proof, remain open to refactoring as your project evolves. You might find that certain event classes could be generalized or that new features in SDL or your own game engine necessitate adjustments to the event handling model. # 7. Testing With such a granular event system, unit testing becomes ever more critical. Ensure each event class and its associated handlers are well-covered by tests to prevent regressions and to verify that events are dispatched and handled as expected. # Conclusion Your structured approach to separate classes for each event type reflects good software engineering principles. However, it\'s accompanied by the overhead of managing a larger codebase. By applying strategies like modularization, utilizing design patterns where appropriate, maintaining thorough documentation, and committing to robust testing practices, you can mitigate these challenges and ensure that your event system remains a strong foundation of your game engine."},{"instruction":"Can you explain more on your Modularization point and how can I group several classes together, what do you mean about this grouping and how can I achieve it? Are these namespaces or modules in a different folder or what do you mean?","output":"Certainly! Modularization in the context of your C++ project involves organizing related classes (such as event classes) in a way that keeps the project clean, manageable, and understandable. This can be achieved through various methods including, but not limited to, namespaces, directory structure, and potentially C++20 modules, depending on your project\'s needs and constraints. Let\'s break these down: # 1. Namespaces Using C++ namespaces is a straightforward way to logically group related classes without imposing physical file structure constraints. Namespaces can span multiple files and offer a way to avoid name collisions, making them ideal for grouping your event classes. For example, you might have: ```cpp namespace SDLWrapper { namespace Events { // Define your SDL event wrappers here class KeyboardKeyDownEvent { /*...*/ }; class KeyboardKeyUpEvent { /*...*/ }; // More event classes... } // namespace Events } // namespace SDLWrapper ``` This way, all event classes are encapsulated within the `SDLWrapper::Events` namespace, which makes their relation and purpose clear. # 2. Directory Structure Directory structure involves organizing your files (and hence, the classes within those files) into folders that represent different modules or logical groupings. This is more about physical organization on the filesystem and works hand-in-hand with namespaces to provide both logical and physical organization to your codebase. Following the previous example, your directory structure might look like this: ``` /YourProject /src /SDLWrapper /Events KeyboardEvents.cpp KeyboardEvents.hpp MouseEvents.cpp MouseEvents.hpp // Other event files... ``` Each `.cpp` and `.hpp` file would contain the relevant event class implementations and definitions. This structure makes it easy to locate related files and understand the project\'s organization at a glance. # 3. C++20 Modules (Optional and Forward-Looking) C++20 introduced a new way to organize code into modules. This is somewhat more advanced and not as widely supported or used as the previous two methods but offers a modern alternative that could replace or complement traditional header-files and namespaces for organizing code. Modules aim to improve compile times, make C++ projects easier to manage, and reduce issues like name collisions and header bloat. If you\'re on a toolchain that supports C++20 modules, you could explore organizing your event classes into different modules. However, this approach requires a compatible build system and toolchain, and understanding the nuances of C++ module exports and imports. # Combining Approaches In practice, a combination of namespaces and directory structure is often used. You\'ll define logical groupings with namespaces and mirror these groupings in your filesystem\'s directory structure. This approach leverages the benefits of both methods, providing clear logical organization while also keeping the physical layout of your project files manageable and intuitive. Adopting such modularization strategies not only aids in keeping the codebase organized but also enhances maintainability and scalability, making it easier to navigate the complexities of a growing project like your SDL-based game engine."},{"instruction":"So far I haven\'t utilized namespaces in my project since I didn\'t had that many classes to begin with, so what you mean is like this, correct me if I am wrong: 1) Creating each .h and .cpp for each event. 2) In each of the .h files, add the namepace events. 3) Move all the events to the events subfolder. 4) Use the events namespace to access its classes from my other classes outside this namespace. Questions: - In the classes outside the namespace, I have to import this namespace or I should when including add the namespace before the name, like #include \\"Events/KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h\\" or something like that? - What would happen with the Event base class, this should be in the same namespace too or can be outside?","output":"Yes, you\'ve got the right idea about using namespaces and organizing your event-related classes. Let\'s clarify your questions with more detailed answers: # Including Namespaced Classes When you include a header file that is part of a namespace, you typically do not include the namespace in the `#include` directive itself. The namespace is defined within the header file. What you discussed, like having each event type in its own `.h` and `.cpp` file, and moving them into an `events` subfolder, is correct. Here\'s a bit more detail: 1. **Creating Each .h and .cpp for Each Event:** - This is a good approach for keeping your code organized and manageable, especially as the number of event types grows. 2. **In Each of the .h Files, Add the Namespace Events:** - Yes, enclose the class definitions in the `events` namespace (or whatever namespace name you choose). 3. **Move All the Events to the Events Subfolder:** - This physical organization mirrors the logical organization you\'ve set up with namespaces. 4. **Use the Events Namespace to Access Its Classes from Other Classes:** - From outside the namespace, you can access these classes either by prefixing the class name with the namespace (e.g., `events::KeyboardKeyDownEvent`) or by using a using-directive (e.g., `using namespace events;`) though be cautious with the latter as it can introduce name collisions. # Questions Answered: - **Importing Namespaces/Including Headers:** - You include headers normally, using the path relative to your project\'s include directory or the file being compiled, without mentioning the namespace. For example: ```cpp #include \\"Events/KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h\\" ``` - The namespace is used in the code where you refer to the classes, not in the `#include` path. - **Regarding the Event Base Class:** - The base class `Event` that all specific events inherit from should logically reside within the same namespace (`events`) since it is part of the same module/group of functionality. - This means placing the `Event` class definition within the `events` namespace in its header file. By doing so, you maintain consistency, and it\'s clear that the `Event` class is related to all other event classes. - It\'s just like the specific event classes, you’d include its header file where needed with something like `#include \\"Events/Event.h\\"` and refer to it as `events::Event` outside the namespace. # Examples: **Event.h:** ```cpp // In Events/Event.h namespace events { class Event { // Base event stuff }; } ``` **KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h:** ```cpp // In Events/KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h #include \\"Event.h\\" namespace events { class KeyboardKeyDownEvent : public Event { // Keyboard key down specific stuff }; } ``` **Usage Outside Namespace:** ```cpp // In some other file #include \\"Events/KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h\\" void function() { events::KeyboardKeyDownEvent event; // Do something with event } ``` This approach should help maintain a clean, organized, and scalable project structure as your game engine evolves."},{"instruction":"I see by your example that there isn\'t a direct relationship between the name of the namespace and the folder structure, so that means I could move the events to their own folder and not using their own namespace, right? So that way I don\'t add the overhead of using a new namespace but also keep my code organized, what do you think? Is this a good way or not?","output":"Indeed, the relationship between namespaces and folder/directory structure in C++ projects is more about conceptual organization and convention rather than a requirement enforced by the language itself, unlike some other programming environments like Java. You can organize your files into folders for physical organization without necessarily mirroring this structure in namespaces. This approach can blend the benefits of keeping your codebase organized while avoiding the complexity of managing multiple namespaces. Here’s how this could be beneficial or present challenges: # Benefits: 1. **Simplified Naming:** By avoiding the proliferation of namespaces, you reduce the potential for overly verbose or nested naming conventions, which can make the code easier to read and write, especially for smaller projects or teams. 2. **Ease of Use:** Newcomers to the project or less experienced programmers might find a simpler namespace strategy easier to understand and navigate, reducing the learning curve associated with the project\'s structure. 3. **Flexibility in Organization:** Without being tied to a namespace structure, you may find it easier to reorganize the physical structure of your project as it evolves, without needing to refactor the namespace usage across files. # Challenges: 1. **Potential for Name Collisions:** Namespace segmentation serves not only organizational purposes but also helps prevent name collisions between classes, functions, and other identifiers. With a reduced number of namespaces, there’s an increased risk of naming conflicts, especially as the project grows. 2. **Reduced Logical Segregation:** While the physical (folder) organization might remain clear, the lack of namespaces can make the logical association between parts of the project less obvious. This could potentially make understanding the codebase at a high level more challenging, particularly for those who are familiar with using namespaces as a means of navigating code logic. 3. **Refactoring Limitations:** If later you decide to introduce more namespaces to address these challenges, it could require significant refactoring, especially in a larger codebase with many interdependencies. # Good Practices for Folder-Only Organization: - **Clear Directory Structure:** Maintain a clear and logical directory structure that reflects the components and their relationships within your project. - **Consistent Naming Schemes:** Adopt consistent naming schemes for your files and classes. This can somewhat mitigate the risk of name collisions and help keep the codebase navigable. - **Document Organization:** Since the logical grouping won’t be as apparent through namespaces, ensure that your project documentation clearly explains the structure and organization of your code. # Conclusion: Choosing to organize your events (or other components) in their own folder without adopting a distinct namespace for each grouping can be a viable way to keep your code organized, especially in smaller projects or in cases where namespace management could introduce unnecessary complexity. It’s a trade-off between simplicity and the benefits namespaces provide for avoiding conflicts and emphasizing logical structure. Ultimately, the best approach depends on the specific needs, scale, and future growth expectations of your project. It is also influenced by the preferences of your development team and the specific challenges you encounter as your engine evolves. Starting simpler can be a good strategy, with the understanding that a careful, planned transition to more namespaces can be undertaken as needed."},{"instruction":"OK I am leaning to this approach since I haven\'t used namespaces in other parts, so it won\'t be a problem, if I decide to switch to namespaces later I would just refactor the code. Since each event will be unique, there won\'t be any collisions, so that is not a problem. The logical association since it will an small subset of the entire code it could be negligible. What do you think? Now choosing this approach, should I move the Event base class to the event folder too or keep it outside this folder?","output":"Given the considerations you\'ve outlined, your inclination toward adopting a folder-based organization without introducing additional namespaces seems reasonable and well-justified for your project\'s current scope and complexity. As you\'ve mentioned, if each event name is unique and you\'re confident about maintaining uniqueness as your project grows, the risk of naming collisions is minimal. Logical association within a smaller subset of your overall codebase, especially with well-named directories and files, should indeed be manageable and won\'t significantly detract from the understandability of your project. # Moving the Event Base Class: Since the `Event` base class serves as a foundational component of your event system, placing it within the same events folder as your concrete event classes makes sense for several reasons: 1. **Cohesion:** Keeping the base class close to its derivatives physically emphasizes their interrelationship and makes it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to locate all related event handling code in one place. 2. **Ease of Maintenance:** Any modifications to the event handling mechanism, whether to the base class or its derivatives, will involve changes localized mainly within the same directory. Thus, it simplifies navigability and maintenance. 3. **Consistency:** Adopting a consistent organizational pattern helps. If all event-related classes are handled similarly (i.e., placed in the same directory), it establishes a clear guideline for where new event classes should be placed in the future. Therefore, moving the `Event` base class to the events folder is advisable. It aligns with keeping your project structure organized and intuitive. # Refactoring to Namespaces Later: Should your project grow in complexity, or should you later decide that introducing more granular namespaces has become beneficial, refactoring your code to incorporate namespaces would be a viable step. Modern IDEs and development tools offer reliable refactoring capabilities that can significantly streamline this process. Moreover, since this change would primarily consist of adding namespace declarations and adjusting `#include` directives or using statements, it\'s relatively low-risk in terms of introducing bugs, provided that changes are made carefully and tested thoroughly. # Final Thoughts: Your current approach appears well-suited for your project\'s needs and aligns with keeping things simple yet organized. It\'s a pragmatic decision that keeps the door open for future adjustments as necessary without overcomplicating your codebase from the outset. Should you choose to refactor and introduce namespaces later, it would be a straightforward process that aligns with the natural evolution of software projects as they grow and become more complex. Starting with a simpler structure allows you to focus on core functionality now and adapt your organizational strategies as the scope or requirements of your engine evolve."},{"instruction":"Perfect!

Since `DisplayConnectedEvent` is derived from `Event`, one might expect this to work seamlessly due to polymorphism. However, for polymorphism to work correctly with smart pointers, you need to ensure proper inheritance, including using `public` inheritance and enabling polymorphic behavior through virtual functions if necessary. To address the error: 1. **Ensure Public Inheritance:** Make sure `DisplayConnectedEvent` inherits from `Event` using public inheritance. It seems you\'re missing the `public` keyword in your class inheritance declaration. 2. **Virtual Destructor in Base Class:** The base class `Event` should have a virtual destructor. This is important for polymorphism, especially when deleting derived class objects through base class pointers. Here\'s how you could adjust your classes to fix the issue: # Adjusting the Base `Event` Class: Make sure `Event` has a virtual destructor, which is essential for a polymorphic base class. ```cpp class Event { public: virtual ~Event() = default; // Other members... }; ``` # Adjusting the Derived `DisplayConnectedEvent` Class: Ensure it publicly inherits from `Event`. ```cpp #include \\"Event.h\\" // Adjust the path as necessary class DisplayConnectedEvent : public Event { public: DisplayConnectedEvent(uint32_t display) : display(display) {} // Initialize display in the constructor initializer list ~DisplayConnectedEvent() override = default; uint32_t GetDisplay() const { return display; } // Adding \'const\' to the getter as it doesn\'t modify the object private: uint32_t display; }; ``` # Adjusting `EventFromSDL` Function: With the above changes, your `EventFromSDL` function inside `EventConverter` should now work correctly, because `std::make_shared<DisplayConnectedEvent>(...)` will rightly return a `std::shared_ptr<DisplayConnectedEvent>`, which can be implicitly converted to a `std::shared_ptr<Event>` due to the `public` inheritance and the polymorphic nature of the base class. The function signature and switch case remain unchanged, as the adjustments to the class definitions have resolved the issue. # Quick Note: Make sure all include paths and directives are correct, matching the actual file locations and names. The compiler needs to find the correct header files to recognize class definitions and inheritance hierarchies properly. By following these steps, you should be able to fix the compilation error and enable a polymorphic relationship between your `Event` and `DisplayConnectedEvent` classes, leveraging smart pointers effectively."},{"instruction":"check this: Technical Details The project is comprised in four different modules/components: Statistical report as a new CLI-option This component involves building an additional CLI module to cooltools and its respective library module, inspired by this current issue: https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/issues/415. The main idea of this component is to calculate and report comprehensive statistics for any .cool file. The associated stats comprise the number of contact points across regions (cis/trans), fraction of contacts within and between regions, distance decay of contacts, among others, that could be restrained to a specific region(s) or chromosome(s) specified by the user. This component will offer easier parallelization strategies achieved by PyO3 and Rust modules to make it faster and easier to implement. The module will be called “coolstats.py” and will use the current dependencies cooltools uses to parse command-line arguments (click). Additionally, will construct similar classes as seen in pairtools, another software produce by the Open2C team, with similar structures (e.g. CoolCounter class) and functions. However, to preserve independence and a better organization, each metric will have its own function. The proposed output is a .txt file with the organized stats and additional plots representing those results saved to the current directory by default or any directory the user specifies with the flag -d/–dir. Other types of formats or the specific layout will be discussed with the team. CLI-related functionality corrections Solve current issues related to the CLI behavior, such as smoothing and aggregation across regions in get_expected_cis() or dropping headers for fetch_chromsizes(), and also implement alternate reductions for aggregation across diagonals, such as variance or standard deviation, adding new arguments to control these features preserving the current functionality as default. These changes can be achieved with the current code and without any extra dependencies. Furthermore, this component will be implemented with its respective documentation following the current guidelines of Open2C and unit tests to ensure the viability of the software. Refactoring of current structures Using the initial ideas from here: https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/issues/227 and here https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/issues/502, I plan to implement a new class for snipper (called Snipper) and re-use the current methods attached. Additional modifications will be added to enhance the functionality and solve current issues, such as decoupling selecting and snipping methods (e.g. snipper.select() and snipper.snip()) and converting bed-like inputs to 2D structures (e.g. bedpe) to reduce overheading over subsequent conversions. As part of this refactoring, I also plan to create a separate mini-repository to store log-smoothing-related functions that will be used not only by cooltools but the whole Open2C ecosystem. The basic functionality of the latter will comprise operating over the core cooltools structures (e.g. numpy arrays and pandas dataframes) with flexibility on column names. Rust-based acceleration of core modules and polars as an efficient alternative Based on a current issue, some parts of cooltools can improve by parallelization strategies, as seen here: https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/commit/c6b705d7aac895006efe797cb22da332793a7ae2#commitcomment-84603046, for example. As mentioned in the first component here, using PyO3 and Rust could be of great advantage. Here, a function called “send_chunk()” will receive a subset of the Hi-C contact matrix that corresponds to a specific genomic region and the parameters to perform the calculations in parallel using the rayon crate. On the other hand, I propose to explore the possibility of using the polars package, a query engine for dataframes natively multi-threaded, to perform dataframe calculations currently done using pandas. Since polars have demonstrated to be way faster than pandas in tasks related to querying, grouping or sorting (see https://medium.com/cuenex/pandas-2-0-vs-polars-the-ultimate-battle-a378eb75d6d1), and also considering that polars can accept pandas dataframes as inputs, benchmarking current cooltools operations using polars instead of pandas could potentially lead to significant advantages. I plan to apply this proposal first to functions using “sort_values()” and benchmark them against the current implementation. This also could be applied to other Open2C tools, such as bioframe, within the sort_bedframe() function. Based on all that, please do this: Abstract (Summary) Short description of your project.

This typically means that Conda has not been installed on your system or its installation path has not been added to your system\'s PATH environment variable. Here are steps you can follow to resolve this issue: # 1. Install Conda (If Not Installed) If you haven\'t installed Conda, you\'ll need to do so. Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Anaconda and Miniconda are two popular distributions that include Conda. - **Anaconda**: Includes Conda and over 150 scientific packages and their dependencies. You can download it from [Anaconda\'s website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). - **Miniconda**: A minimal installer for Conda. It includes only Conda, Python, and the packages they depend on. You can download it from [Miniconda\'s website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). **Choose one** to install based on your needs. # 2. Adding Conda to the PATH Environment Variable If Conda is installed but not recognized, its installation directory might not be in your system\'s PATH. Follow these steps to add it: For Windows: 1. Search for \\"Environment Variables\\" in the Start menu. 2. Click on \\"Edit the system environment variables.\\" 3. In the System Properties window, click the \\"Environment Variables...\\" button. 4. Under \\"System variables,\\" scroll to find the \\"Path\\" variable, then click \\"Edit...\\" 5. If Conda\'s path is not listed, you\'ll need to add it. The default installation paths for Conda are: - Anaconda: `C:UsersYourUsernameAnaconda3` - Miniconda: `C:UsersYourUsernameMiniconda3` Replace `YourUsername` with your actual user name. Make sure to also add the `Scripts` and `Librarybin` subdirectories to the PATH. 6. Click \\"OK\\" to close the dialogs and apply the changes. After adjusting the PATH, open a new Command Prompt window and try the Conda command again. Check Conda Installation: To verify that Conda is correctly installed and added to your PATH, you can open a new command prompt window and type: ```bash conda --version ``` If Conda is properly installed and configured, this command will return the version number of Conda installed on your machine. Once Conda is recognized, you can retry installing the Intel Extension for Transformers using the command: ```bash conda install -c intel intel_extension_for_transformers ``` If you encounter any issues during installation or have questions about using Conda, feel free to ask for further assistance."},{"instruction":"how do i install a tar.bz2 file?","output":"Installing a `.tar.bz2` file typically involves two steps: extracting the contents of the file and then running an installation process based on the contents. These files are often used in Unix and Linux systems for distributing source code or binary programs. Below is a general guide on how to handle a `.tar.bz2` file. This guide assumes you are working on a Unix-like operating system, such as Linux or macOS. # Step 1: Extract the `.tar.bz2` File 1. Open a terminal. 2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.tar.bz2` file using the `cd` command. For example: ```sh cd ~/Downloads/ ``` 3. Use the `tar` command to extract the file: ```sh tar -xjf name_of_file.tar.bz2 ``` - `-x` tells `tar` to extract files. - `-j` is used for `bzip2` decompression. - `-f` specifies that you are providing a filename. 4. This will extract the contents into a folder within the current directory. Use `ls` to see the newly created folder and `cd` to move into it: ```sh cd extracted_folder_name/ ``` # Step 2: Install the Contents of the `.tar.bz2` File The installation steps can vary significantly depending on what you have extracted. Common scenarios include: - **Precompiled binaries:** Sometimes, the `.tar.bz2` file contains an executable or a set of executables that you can run directly without installation. You might need to set execution permissions with `chmod +x filename` before running it with `./filename`. - **Source code that needs to be compiled:** If the archive contains source code, the general steps to compile it (though this might vary) are: 1. Check if there\'s a `README` or `INSTALL` file with specific installation instructions and follow them. 2. Commonly, you will need to run `./configure`, then `make`, and finally `sudo make install`, like this: ```sh ./configure make sudo make install ``` This will compile the source code into binaries and install them on your system. - **Python packages:** If it’s a Python package, it might be installable using `pip`. Navigate to the top-level directory (where `setup.py` is located) and run: ```sh pip install . ``` Note: It\'s recommended to use a virtual environment for Python package installations to avoid conflicting dependencies. - **Generic installation script:** It might come with an installation script like `install.sh`. Run the script with `./install.sh` (you might need to make it executable first with `chmod +x install.sh`). # Additional Note: Always be cautious about what you install and how you install it. Make sure you trust the source of the `.tar.bz2` file. Preferably, always look for documentation or installation instructions provided by the maintainer/creator of the software for the most accurate installation process."},{"instruction":"can i open it in ubuntu?","output":"Yes, you can open a `.tar.bz2` file in Ubuntu. The `.tar.bz2` format is a type of compressed file, essentially a tarball (`.tar`) compressed using Bzip2 (`.bz2`). This format is widely used in Unix-based systems like Ubuntu for distributing files and source code due to its high compression ratio. Here’s how you can open (extract) it and potentially install its contents on Ubuntu: # Extracting the `.tar.bz2` File 1. **Using the Terminal:** Open the terminal application in Ubuntu. You can find it by searching for it in the Show Applications menu or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T`. 2. **Navigate to the File Location:** Use the `cd` command to change directories to the location where your `.tar.bz2` file is located. For example, if it is in the Downloads folder: ```sh cd ~/Downloads ``` 3. **Extract the File:** Use the `tar` command to extract the contents of the file: ```sh tar -xjf name_of_file.tar.bz2 ``` The options used are: - `-x`: extract files from an archive - `-j`: filter the archive through `bzip2` for decompression - `-f`: use archive file After running this command, the contents of the archive will be extracted to the current working directory. # Post Extraction After extraction, what you do next depends on what the `.tar.bz2` file contained: - **If it contains a program or script**, you may need to make it executable with `chmod +x filename` before you can run it with `./filename`. - **If it contains source code**, there might be a `README` or `INSTALL` text file explaining how to compile and install the software. The typical sequence of commands for compiling and installing from source is: ```sh ./configure make sudo make install ``` Ensure you have the necessary compilers installed (for example, `build-essential` for C/C++ compilation in Ubuntu). - **If it\'s a package meant for Python**, and if there\'s a `setup.py` file, you might install it using `pip` (ideally within a virtual environment): ```sh pip install . ``` # Using a GUI If you prefer not to use the command line, Ubuntu also allows you to open `.tar.bz2` files graphically: 1. **Navigate to the file** using the File Manager. 2. **Right-click** on the `.tar.bz2` file. 3. Choose **\\"Extract Here\\"** or **\\"Extract To...\\"** depending on where you want to put the extracted files.

Whether you choose to install via `pip` (Python\'s package installer) or `conda` (a package manager from the Anaconda ecosystem) depends on your development environment and personal preference. Both methods are provided to give users options based on the tools they are comfortable with or the ones that best fit their workflow. # Things to Consider When Choosing Between `pip` and `conda`: - **Environment Management**: If you are using Conda as your primary environment manager, it might be preferable to install packages through Conda when available, as this can help avoid compatibility issues. - **Availability**: Some packages are only available on PyPI and not on Conda, or vice versa. However, in this case, the `intel-extension-for-transformers` is available through both managers. - **Dependencies**: Conda attempts to install all dependencies of a package at once, potentially leading to fewer compatibility problems. PyPI, while straightforward and powerful, sometimes requires manual management of dependencies, especially in complex environments. - **Note on Protobuf**: The note regarding Protobuf (`Recommend install protobuf <= 3.20.0 if use onnxruntime <= 1.11`) applies irrespective of whether you install the package via `pip` or `conda`. It addresses a potential compatibility issue with a specific version of ONNX Runtime, so you should follow this advice in both cases. # Installing via pip (PyPI) If you decide to go with `pip`, you might want to create a virtual environment first (if you haven’t already) to avoid potential conflicts with other packages: ```bash python3 -m venv myenv source myenv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `myenvScriptsactivate` pip install intel-extension-for-transformers ``` If you need to address the Protobuf version constraint, you can: ```bash pip install \'protobuf<=3.20.0\' ``` # Installing via Conda For installing through Conda, simply running the provided command in your Conda environment should suffice: ```bash conda install -c intel intel_extension_for_transformers ``` And, if needed, ensure the correct version of Protobuf: ```bash conda install protobuf=3.20.0 ``` # Final Note Choose the method that best integrates into your workflow. There’s no benefit in installing the package through both PyPI and Conda in the same environment, and doing so might even lead to dependency conflicts or other issues."},{"instruction":"\\"\\"Note: Recommend install protobuf <= 3.20.0 if use onnxruntime <= 1.11\\"\\" what does this mean?","output":"The note: \\"Recommend install protobuf <= 3.20.0 if use onnxruntime <= 1.11\\" provides guidance on managing software dependencies to ensure compatibility between different packages. Let\'s break down the meaning and implications of this recommendation: 1. **Protobuf**: Protobuf, short for Protocol Buffers, is a method developed by Google for serializing structured data. It is similar to XML or JSON, but faster and more compact. Protobuf is often used in applications for communication protocols, data storage, etc. 2. **onnxruntime**: ONNX Runtime is a performance-focused engine for Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models. It enables models trained in various frameworks, like PyTorch or TensorFlow, to be converted to the ONNX format and then efficiently run. This makes it easier to deploy machine learning models across a wide range of platforms and devices. 3. **The Recommendation**: - When you are using **`onnxruntime` version 1.11 or lower**, it is recommended to **limit the version of `protobuf` to 3.20.0 or lower**. - This recommendation is made because specific versions of ONNX Runtime have been tested and are known to work reliably with certain versions of Protobuf. Using a version of Protobuf that is too new could potentially introduce compatibility issues, bugs, or unexpected behavior in ONNX Runtime due to changes or updates in Protobuf that are not supported by the older version of ONNX Runtime. 4. **Why This Matters**: - Compatibility between these packages is crucial for data serialization and deserialization, especially when dealing with machine learning models where precise data representation is critical. - Adhering to this guideline ensures that your environment remains stable and that the ONNX models run as expected without encountering serialization-related errors. 5. **How to Apply This Recommendation**: When setting up your environment, you should explicitly specify the version of Protobuf that meets this recommendation if you are using or plan to use ONNX Runtime 1.11 or an older version. For Python, you can manage this with package managers like Pip or Conda. Here are the commands for both: - Using Pip: ```sh pip install \'protobuf<=3.20.0\' ``` - Using Conda: ```sh conda install protobuf=3.20.0 ``` Adhering to such specific version recommendations is a common practice in software development, especially in data science and machine learning projects, to ensure that the complex inter-dependencies between various packages do not lead to unexpected issues."},{"instruction":"\\"\\" 2. onnxruntime: ONNX Runtime is a performance-focused engine for Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models.

However, this doesn\'t mean that the software can only be run or installed using Ubuntu\'s command line or Python scripts. The use of Ubuntu and Python in the documentation is likely for consistency and clarity since they\'re commonly used in the development and deployment of machine learning applications. # Use of Ubuntu Ubuntu is highlighted because: 1. **Popularity in the ML Community**: Ubuntu is a widely used Linux distribution in the machine learning and data science communities. Its stability, support, and ease of use make it a good choice for developers and researchers. 2. **Package Management**: Ubuntu\'s package management system (using `apt`) simplifies the installation of system libraries and software, which are frequently needed for developing and deploying machine learning models. 3. **Linux Preference**: Many tools and libraries in the data science ecosystem are developed and tested primarily on Linux due to its prevalence on servers and high-performance computing platforms. # Use of Python Python is the language of choice for many reasons: 1. **Popularity**: Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, especially in data science, machine learning, AI, and scientific computing. 2. **Ecosystem**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas) that facilitate machine learning tasks. 3. **Simplicity and Flexibility**: Python\'s syntax is clear and its dynamic nature allows for rapid experimentation and iteration, which is essential in research and development phases of machine learning projects. # Use of Command Line (Terminal) and PowerShell - **Command Line (Terminal) on Ubuntu**: The use of the command line in Ubuntu (or any Unix-like system) is preferred for its versatility and power in handling file operations, executing scripts, managing services, and interacting with system internals, which are common tasks in machine learning workflows. - **PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows**: Similarly, instructions could also be provided for Windows environments using PowerShell or Command Prompt. The reason they\'re less frequently mentioned in machine learning documentation is due to a combination of Linux\'s stronger presence in this field and certain tools/libraries that are designed to run natively on Linux. However, many machine learning applications and libraries, including Python itself, can run on Windows. When documentation refers to Python commands (e.g., `pip install package_name`), those commands can typically be run in PowerShell or Command Prompt just as well, assuming Python is correctly installed and configured on the Windows system. # Cross-Platform Compatibility The Intel Extension for Transformers, being a Python package, should be compatible with any platform where Python and the necessary dependencies can be run. This includes Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions. For Windows users, PowerShell and Command Prompt can be used to install Python packages (using `pip`), manage virtual environments, and execute scripts, just like you would use the terminal in Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution. In summary, while the documentation may focus on Ubuntu and Python, the underlying tools and libraries are generally cross-platform, and similar steps can be followed on Windows using PowerShell or Command Prompt with some adjustments for differences in the operating system environment."},{"instruction":"explain neural chat to me like i am a layperson: \\"\\"Skip to content intel / intel-extension-for-transformers Type / to search Code Issues 31 Pull requests 14 Discussions Actions Projects Security Insights Files Go to file t .github conda_meta docker docs examples intel_extension_for_transformers haystack langchain llama_index neural_chat assets cli docker docs examples models pipeline prompts server serving/triton/text_generation tests tools ui utils README.md __init__.py chatbot.py config.py config_logging.py errorcode.py plugins.py requirements.txt requirements_cpu.txt requirements_hpu.txt requirements_pc.txt requirements_xpu.txt tools transformers __init__.py tests workflows .dockerignore .gitignore .gitmodules .gitpod.yml .pre-commit-config.yaml LICENSE MANIFEST.in README.md SECURITY.md env_gpu.sh requirements-cpu.txt requirements.txt setup.py third_party_programs.txt Breadcrumbsintel-extension-for-transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers /neural_chat/ Directory actionsAdd file More options Latest commit letonghan letonghan [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… 99df35d · yesterday History Breadcrumbsintel-extension-for-transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers /neural_chat/ Folders and files Name Last commit message Last commit date parent directory .. assets Update Quickstart NeuralChat notebook for workshops (#1331) 3 weeks ago cli Fix finetuning unit test issue (#1367) 2 weeks ago docker modify readme (#1384) last week docs [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week examples [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week models [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week pipeline update retrieval requirements (#1415) yesterday prompts [NeuralChat] Add readme, add content length filter, fix build error (#… last week server [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… yesterday serving/triton/text_generation [NeuralChat] CUDA serving with Triton Inference Server (#1293) last month tests [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… yesterday tools refined readme of ROME.

Since the processing would happen locally or within a controlled environment, external access to your data would be limited based on your network security and the access controls you have in place. In such setups, data privacy is generally maintained, assuming: 1. **Network Security**: Your network is secure and not exposed to unauthorized external access. 2. **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel have access to the machine or cloud instance running NeuralChat. 3. **Data Handling Practices**: You follow best practices for data management, including encryption of sensitive information and secure deletion of data when no longer needed. # Cloud or Online Services If the NeuralChat setup requires interacting with external services for enhanced functionality (like cloud-based model hosting, APIs for additional features, etc.), data privacy would then also depend on the privacy policies and security measures of these external services. It\'s crucial to: 1. **Review Privacy Policies**: Before integrating any external service or API, review the service provider’s privacy policy to understand how your data will be used and protected. 2. **Secure Communication**: Ensure that any communication with external services is encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect the data in transit. 3. **Data Minimization**: Only send the minimal amount of data necessary for the required functionality to external services. # Best Practices for Privacy - **Review Code and Documentation**: Before deploying NeuralChat, review the underlying code and documentation to understand how data is handled, stored, or transmitted, especially if customization or extension has been applied. - **Anonymize Data**: If possible, anonymize data before processing it through NeuralChat, especially if working with sensitive information that could identify individuals. - **Regular Updates**: Keep the software and its dependencies up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities that could compromise data privacy. # Conclusion Your data\'s privacy in using NeuralChat or similar frameworks boils down to how and where it\'s deployed and the external services it interacts with. In controlled, secure environments where data doesn\'t leave your infrastructure, privacy can generally be maintained. However, vigilance is needed regarding network security, access controls, and interactions with external services to ensure data privacy."},{"instruction":"ok, thanks, what else do i need to know about Neuralchat?","output":"NeuralChat, as part of the Intel Extension for Transformers, provides a customizable framework that allows the rapid creation of AI-driven applications, notably chatbots and copilots.

This file is essential for specifying all the Python package dependencies needed for your project on a CPU environment. Here\'s how you can resolve this issue: # 1. Ensure You\'re in the Correct Directory The most common reason for this error is being in the wrong directory. Ensure you\'re in the directory where `requirements_cpu.txt` is located. If you have just cloned a repository or downloaded the project, make sure you navigate (`cd`) into the project\'s root directory where this file is supposed to be. For example, if your project (and thus, the requirements file) is located in `C:UsersbowerMyProject`, you need to change your current directory to `MyProject`: ```bash cd C:UsersbowerMyProject ``` # 2. Check if the File Exists Before trying to install again, confirm that `requirements_cpu.txt` actually exists in your current directory: ```bash dir ``` This command will list all the files and directories in your current location. Look for `requirements_cpu.txt` in the list. If you don\'t see it, you\'re either in the wrong directory (see step 1) or the file does not exist where you expected. # 3. Obtain the File If you\'ve determined the file is indeed missing: - **If you\'re following a tutorial or course**: The `requirements_cpu.txt` file might be provided as part of the course materials. Download it from the course website or repository. - **If the project is from a repository**: Clone or download the project repository again, ensuring you\'re getting the correct branch or version that should include the `requirements_cpu.txt` file. - **If you\'re creating your own project**: You may need to create this file yourself. Typically, `requirements.txt` contains a list of Python packages your project depends on. You can use `pip freeze > requirements_cpu.txt` to generate a list of all installed packages in your environment; however, this isn\'t always advisable for creating a clean, minimal dependencies file for a project. # 4. Verify the Path If you\'re sure the file exists and you\'re in the correct directory, double-check the file name for typos. Perhaps it\'s named slightly differently, like just `requirements.txt` or has a path that wasn\'t correctly specified. # Creating a requirements.txt File If you intended to create a `requirements_cpu.txt` but haven\'t yet, and you know which packages you need, you simply create a new text file with that name and list each required package in the file, one package per line, like so: ```plaintext flask numpy==1.18.1 pandas ``` Then save this file in the appropriate project directory and run the `pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt` command again. Following these steps should help you resolve the issue with the `requirements_cpu.txt` file not being found."},{"instruction":"i\'m trying to follow the guide on this page for cpu : \\"\\"Skip to content intel / intel-extension-for-transformers Type / to search Code Issues 31 Pull requests 14 Discussions Actions Projects Security Insights Files Go to file t .github conda_meta docker docs examples intel_extension_for_transformers haystack langchain llama_index neural_chat assets cli docker docs examples models pipeline prompts server serving/triton/text_generation tests tools ui utils README.md __init__.py chatbot.py config.py config_logging.py errorcode.py plugins.py requirements.txt requirements_cpu.txt requirements_hpu.txt requirements_pc.txt requirements_xpu.txt tools transformers __init__.py tests workflows .dockerignore .gitignore .gitmodules .gitpod.yml .pre-commit-config.yaml LICENSE MANIFEST.in README.md SECURITY.md env_gpu.sh requirements-cpu.txt requirements.txt setup.py third_party_programs.txt Breadcrumbsintel-extension-for-transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers /neural_chat/ Directory actionsAdd file More options Latest commit letonghan letonghan [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… 99df35d · yesterday History Breadcrumbsintel-extension-for-transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers /neural_chat/ Folders and files Name Last commit message Last commit date parent directory .. assets Update Quickstart NeuralChat notebook for workshops (#1331) 3 weeks ago cli Fix finetuning unit test issue (#1367) 2 weeks ago docker modify readme (#1384) last week docs [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week examples [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week models [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week pipeline update retrieval requirements (#1415) yesterday prompts [NeuralChat] Add readme, add content length filter, fix build error (#… last week server [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… yesterday serving/triton/text_generation [NeuralChat] CUDA serving with Triton Inference Server (#1293) last month tests [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… yesterday tools refined readme of ROME.

If encountering issues with the `requirements_cpu.txt` file not being found, ensure you\'re in the correct directory where the file exists, or download/setup the file as per the Intel Extension for Transformers documentation or repository structure. ```sh pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt ``` # Getting Started with NeuralChat - **Launch the Service**: You can start the NeuralChat server using either a shell command or Python code. - If you have a `neuralchat_server` CLI available, utilize it with the appropriate configuration file: ```sh neuralchat_server start --config_file ./server/config/neuralchat.yaml ``` - Alternatively, through Python code by importing `NeuralChatServerExecutor` from the `intel_extension_for_transformers.neural_chat` module and executing it with the desired configurations. - **Access the Service**: Once the server is up, it exposes an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`) that you can interact with using the OpenAI client library, `curl` commands, or the Python `requests` library. # Customization and Use - You can customize NeuralChat\'s behavior through modifications in the provided YAML configuration file, tailoring the service to your specific needs. - NeuralChat supports a variety of models for different tasks like text completion, chat completions, and more, affording you a versatile tool for creating LLM-driven AI applications. - For enhanced functionalities, consider exploring the rich set of plugins and APIs NeuralChat offers, extending capabilities to areas like speech processing, safety checks, caching, name entity recognition, and more. # Multimodal APIs and Plugins Explore the additional RESTful APIs and plugins if your project scope includes multimodal applications, leveraging NeuralChat\'s support beyond just text-based interactions. --- Remember, NeuralChat and the Intel Extension for Transformers are under active development, so stay updated with the latest documentation and version releases to leverage new features and improvements."},{"instruction":"great. i found it. now, can you explain what this means in plain english: \\"\\"NeuralChat provides OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs for LLM inference, so you can use NeuralChat as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI APIs. NeuralChat service can also be accessible through OpenAI client library, curl commands, and requests library. See neuralchat_api.md.\\"\\" i am a layperson","output":"Sure, I\'ll break it down into simpler terms: # NeuralChat and OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs: 1. **NeuralChat** is a software tool that uses artificial intelligence to help you build applications that can understand and generate human-like text. This can be particularly useful for creating chatbots or other applications requiring natural language processing. 2. **OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs**: OpenAI is a company that also creates artificial intelligence tools, and they have their own way for programs to communicate with their tools, known as APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs are like menus in a restaurant for programs, telling them what requests they can make and how to make them. RESTful is just a style of these menus that is widely used because it\'s simple and works well on the web. When NeuralChat says it provides \\"OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs,\\" it means that NeuralChat has made its menu very similar to OpenAI\'s. This is useful because if your program already knows how to order food from OpenAI\'s menu, it can order from NeuralChat\'s menu without needing to learn anything new. This makes it easier to switch from using OpenAI\'s tools to NeuralChat’s tools, or to use them both together. # Using NeuralChat: 1. **Drop-in replacement**: The term \\"drop-in replacement\\" means that you can switch out OpenAI\'s tools with NeuralChat in your applications, and everything should work just the same. It\'s like being able to swap your regular coffee brand with another without changing how you make it. 2. **Accessible through various tools**: NeuralChat can be interacted with using several different tools, making it flexible depending on what you\'re comfortable with or what the situation calls for: - **OpenAI client library**: This is a collection of code made available by OpenAI to make it easier to interact with their APIs. Because NeuralChat is compatible, you can use this same library to communicate with NeuralChat, too. - **curl commands**: curl is a command-line tool available on most computers that lets you make web requests. You can use it to send requests to NeuralChat and get responses back. - **requests library**: This is a Python library for making web requests. If you are writing a Python program that needs to talk to NeuralChat, the requests library is one way to do that. 3. **See neuralchat_api.md**: This likely refers to a document or file named `neuralchat_api.md` which contains more detailed information about how to use NeuralChat’s APIs — like a detailed section of the menu, listing all the options and how to order them. In essence, NeuralChat is built to be easily used by those familiar with OpenAI\'s tools, providing a versatile alternative for creating intelligent text-based applications."},{"instruction":"why are packages so slow to download in ubuntu and pip??","output":"Download speeds for packages in Ubuntu (using `apt`) and Python packages (using `pip`) can vary based on several factors, which could contribute to the perception or reality of slow downloads. Here are some common reasons why package downloads might be slow, along with some potential solutions: # 1. Internet Connection Speed - **Problem**: If your internet connection itself is slow or unstable, downloads will naturally take longer. - **Solution**: Test your internet speed online. If it\'s slow, troubleshoot your connection, consider upgrading your internet plan, or try downloading during off-peak hours. # 2. Source Server Load or Bandwidth Limits - **Problem**: The server from which you\'re downloading packages might be under heavy load or have bandwidth limits. - **Solution**: Wait and try again later. For `pip`, you can also try using a different package index or mirror that is geographically closer to you or less busy. # 3. Package Size - **Problem**: Some packages, especially in the machine learning and data science ecosystem, are very large due to included datasets or models. - **Solution**: Patience is key here. Alternatively, ensure that you only download the packages you need, and check if there’s a \\"lite\\" version of the package that excludes large datasets or models. # 4. Mirrors or Source list is not Optimized - **Problem for Ubuntu (`apt`)**: The default mirrors in the source list might not be the fastest ones available for your location. - **Solution**: Use the \\"Software & Updates\\" setting in Ubuntu to find the best (fastest) mirror. You can also manually edit your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file to point to a faster repository mirror. # 5. Concurrent Downloads and System Load - **Problem**: Running multiple downloads or applications can saturate your bandwidth or system resources, making each individual download slower. - **Solution**: Limit concurrent downloads and close unnecessary applications to free up bandwidth and resources. # 6. DNS Resolution Delays - **Problem**: Slow DNS resolution can cause delays in establishing connections to the package servers. - **Solution**: Try changing your DNS server to a faster alternative like Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1). # 7. Local Network Issues - **Problem**: Issues with your local network, such as weak Wi-Fi signals or network congestion, can slow down downloads. - **Solution**: Try connecting via Ethernet if possible, move closer to your Wi-Fi router, or investigate and resolve any other local network issues. # 8. Cache Needs Updating (for `apt`) - **Problem**: An outdated package cache can sometimes cause issues. - **Solution**: Run `sudo apt update` to update the package lists and `sudo apt upgrade` to upgrade the installed packages, which might also improve performance. # Reducing the Perceived Waiting Time 1. **Download Only What\'s Necessary**: Especially with `pip`, carefully manage your dependencies to avoid installing unnecessary packages. 2. **Use Virtual Environments**: For Python, virtual environments can help manage dependencies more efficiently and may mitigate the need to download the same packages repeatedly for different projects. 3. **Check for Precompiled Binaries**: Some libraries have precompiled binaries (wheels) which are quicker to install than building from source. Ensure your pip is up to date (`pip install --upgrade pip`) to improve its handling of binary packages. By understanding and addressing these factors, you can often significantly improve your package download speeds in Ubuntu and when using `pip`."},{"instruction":"break down and explain this for me. note: i have a intel core chip and i want to runt the 4bit quantization: \\"\\" Intel® Neural Compressor latest▼ Click link above to switch version Search docs Getting Started Installation User Guide Examples APIs Release Legal Information Security Policy Repo Intel® Neural CompressorView page source Intel® Neural Compressor An open-source Python library supporting popular model compression techniques on all mainstream deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and MXNet) python version license coverage Downloads Architecture | Workflow | LLMs Recipes | Results | Documentations Intel® Neural Compressor aims to provide popular model compression techniques such as quantization, pruning (sparsity), distillation, and neural architecture search on mainstream frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and MXNet, as well as Intel extensions such as Intel Extension for TensorFlow and Intel Extension for PyTorch.

The Intel® Neural Compressor (INC) is a tool designed to help improve the efficiency and performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models on computers. It is akin to a toolkit that allows these models to run faster and consume less power, which is particularly beneficial when deploying AI in various devices and servers. INC supports popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others, making it versatile for different AI projects. # Key Features: - **Support for Various Hardware**: INC works with a range of Intel hardware (such as Intel Xeon processors and Intel Data Center GPUs), and even supports AMD CPUs, ARM CPUs, and Nvidia GPUs to some extent. This means it can be used on a wide variety of computers and servers. - **Model Optimization Techniques**: INC uses techniques like quantization (simplifying the model to run faster), pruning (removing unneeded parts of the model), and others to make AI models more efficient. For instance, converting certain parts of an AI model to use 4 bits instead of the usual 16 or 32 can significantly speed up its operation with minimal impact on its accuracy. - **Pre-tested Models**: The tool has been verified on various popular AI models (like GPT-J, LLama2, and more), ensuring it can be applied to a wide range of existing models without causing errors or significant drops in performance. - **Collaboration with Major Platforms**: INC works with cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, making it suitable for AI models deployed in the cloud. # Getting Started: - **Installation**: INC can be installed with a simple `pip install neural-compressor` command in your coding environment, making it straightforward to get started. - **Usage Examples**: The documentation includes examples on how to apply INC to your models, specifically showcasing how to perform tasks like \\"Weight-Only Quantization\\" for models including Large Language Models (LLMs). # Weight-Only Quantization with 4-bit Example: - **Simplified Example**: Imagine you have a large AI model like GPT-Neo (a text-generating model). INC allows you to make this model run faster by simplifying the model\'s weight (a crucial component of AI models that determines their output) without rewriting the model from scratch. You could potentially reduce these weights to use only 4 bits, making the model much lighter and quicker. - **Running the Example**: The steps involve first installing INC and related packages, then using INC\'s functionality to apply this \\"weight-only\\" simplification, selecting the best method automatically. There\'s a note about using specific Docker images for Intel Gaudi2 hardware, indicating that for specialized environments, you can follow tailored instructions for setup. # Documentation and Support: The provided documentation covers various technical and in-depth topics, including the architecture of INC, workflow, recipes for LLMs, and results. Additionally, it mentions communities and communication channels like GitHub, email, and Discord for seeking help or discussing ideas related to model compression. # In Simple Terms: Think of the Intel® Neural Compressor as a toolbox that allows your AI models to go on a \\"diet,\\" making them leaner and faster without losing their \\"intelligence.\\" Whether you\'re working on a laptop or a powerful server, whether your AI project is small or involves massive models like those generating human-like text, INC provides you with the means to make your project more efficient and cost-effective."},{"instruction":"expand \\"running he example\\" step. Make the instructions clear for a layperson.","output":"Let’s simplify and expand the \\"running the example\\" step related to the \\"Weight-Only Quantization\\" process using Intel® Neural Compressor for a non-technical audience. This step is about making an AI model faster by simplifying part of its data (weights) to use less space. The example focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), like those that generate text similar to how humans do. # Step-by-Step Simplified: Imagine you have a complex recipe (AI model) that creates a gourmet dish (generates text). This recipe involves a lot of ingredients (weights), making it intricate and time-consuming to prepare. Now, suppose you have a way to simplify this recipe without changing the taste and quality of the dish too much. This is what \\"Weight-Only Quantization\\" does – it simplifies the recipe. 1. Getting the Right Tools and Ingredients: First, you need to make sure you have all the necessary tools (software packages) and ingredients (model and data) ready: - **Install the Kitchen Tools (Software Packages)**: You would install Intel® Neural Compressor and other necessary packages by typing commands in the terminal, which is like telling a kitchen assistant to fetch and prepare all tools and ingredients you need. Here’s how you would ask for these tools to be prepared: ```sh pip install \\"neural-compressor>=2.3\\" \\"transformers>=4.34.0\\" torch torchvision ``` This command is like saying, \\"Please prepare the Neural Compressor, some transformation tools, and the basic frameworks (torch and torchvision) for cooking.\\" 2. Preparing the Dish (Model Quantization): - **Choosing the Recipe**: Say you decide to prepare a simpler version of a gourmet dish called \\"EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m\\" – this is your chosen AI model, which is known for generating human-like text. - **Simplify the Recipe (Quantize the Model)**: You then proceed to simplify your recipe. This involves reducing the complexity of your ingredients (model weights) to make the cooking process (model inference) faster. Specifically, you\'re aiming to use a 4-bit format for ingredients, which is like using a simpler version of each ingredient without compromising the dish\'s quality too much. Here\'s how you might proceed with the help of a kitchen assistant (running the example code): ```python from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig from neural_compressor.quantization import fit from neural_compressor.adaptor.torch_utils.auto_round import get_dataloader # Prepare your ingredients and tools model_name = \\"EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m\\" float_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) dataloader = get_dataloader(tokenizer, seqlen=2048) # Start simplifying the recipe woq_conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig( approach=\\"weight_only\\", op_type_dict={ \\".*\\": { # match all ops \\"weight\\": { \\"dtype\\": \\"int\\", \\"bits\\": 4, \\"algorithm\\": \\"AUTOROUND\\", }, } }, ) # Cook and see the results quantized_model = fit(model=float_model, conf=woq_conf, calib_dataloader=dataloader) ``` This piece of code is like a detailed cooking instruction that tells your assistant exactly how to simplify each ingredient using a 4-bit format with the \\"AUTOROUND\\" algorithm, which automatically finds the best way to do this without losing the essence of the dish. Note for Specific Kitchen Environment: If you\'re cooking in a special kitchen (Intel Gaudi2 hardware), there are instructions for preparing the kitchen environment using a Docker container – think of it as setting up a special cooking station with the right atmosphere and tools specifically optimized for your dish. You\'ll start this setup with specific `docker` commands as provided in the guide. Serving the Dish: After following the steps, your gourmet dish is ready much faster than before, with minimal loss in its taste and quality. You\'ve successfully applied \\"Weight-Only Quantization\\" to your AI model, making it quicker and more efficient without significantly impacting its output quality. And that’s it! You’ve simplified a complex AI model recipe to make it more efficient, just like a chef streamlining a gourmet dish recipe for a faster cooking time."},{"instruction":"i want to use this section: \\"\\"INT4 Inference (CPU) We encourage you to install NeuralSpeed to get the latest features (e.g., GGUF support) of LLM low-bit inference on CPUs.

The documents you found list various Intel architectures like Sapphire Rapids, Ice Lake, Cascade Lake, etc., and specify the type of low-precision optimizations supported (e.g., AMX_INT8, AVX512_VNNI). While Tiger Lake processors are mentioned in the context of supporting `AVX512F` for FP32 compute types, the detailed compatibility with INT8 and 4-bit precision requires specific ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) support. - The 11th Gen Intel Core processors support `AVX-512` instruction sets, which means they should benefit from some level of optimization for model inference described in the documents. However, the highest optimizations around `AMX_INT8` noted for Sapphire Rapids might not be fully utilized as those are specific to newer Intel architectures. 2. **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: - Given the processor details, we can infer support for `AVX-512` related optimizations. For the specific ISA support related to `AMX_INT8`, that\'s a feature highlighted in the context of newer CPU architectures like Sapphire Rapids. Your CPU (Tiger Lake) supports `AVX-512`, which mandates compatibility with `AVX512F`, one of the listed ISAs known for carrying optimizations in AI inference tasks. 3. **Quantization Support**: - The information regarding weight-only quantization and the supported fast configurations for CPUs mentions the importance of ISA for quantization types, especially INT4 quantization leading to model performance improvement. Your processor aligns with use cases favoring `AVX512_VNNI` for INT8 compute types, which would still mark significant performance gains in AI inference, though with a slightly different setting than the `AMX_INT8` designated for Sapphire Rapids architecture. 4. **Fastest Configuration for Your CPU**: - Your 11th Gen Intel Core i7 is part of the Tiger Lake family, which, based on the guidelines, would lean towards configurations that utilize `AVX512_VNNI` and `AVX512F` for INT8 and FP32 compute types, respectively. This suggests that while your setup might not reach the absolute peak of what\'s possible with Sapphire Rapids\' `AMX_INT8`, it\'s quite capable of accelerating LLM inference efficiently using weight-only quantization via supported ISAs. # Conclusion: Your 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11390H CPU aligns well with the general requirements for running optimized low-precision kernels for LLM inference. You have compatibility with `AVX-512` instructions, which are instrumental in optimizing model inference. Although your setup might not employ the newest `AMX_INT8` optimizations exclusive to newer architectures like Sapphire Rapids, your Tiger Lake processor should still benefit significantly from `AVX512_VNNI` and `AVX512F` based optimizations for AI model inferences, including those related to 4-bit (INT4) quantization strategies. Thus, yes, your setup complies with the necessary requirements to run optimized LLM inference tasks effectively, taking advantage of your CPU\'s supported ISAs for considerable performance improvements in weight-only quantized models."},{"instruction":"i found this info: \\"\\"AVX-512 512-bit extensions to the SIMD instructions for x86 ISA Introduction Proposed by Intel in July 2013 and first implemented in Intel Xeon Phi x200 (Knights Landing) in 2016. Foundational Extension Core extension AVX-512F (AVX-512 Foundation) is required in all AVX-512 implementations. Improvements Widens most 256-bit instructions and adds new operations including data conversions, scatter operations, and permutations.\\"\\"","output":"Based on the additional information you provided about AVX-512, let\'s clarify how this ties into your system\'s capabilities for running optimized low-precision kernels for LLM inference. # Understanding AVX-512: - **What It Is**: AVX-512 represents an extension to the already existing SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions found in x86 instruction set architecture (ISA). It allows a single instruction to operate on much larger data - up to 512 bits at a time, as opposed to the 256-bit processing available with AVX and AVX2. This capability is crucial for accelerating computational tasks by performing more operations in parallel, particularly beneficial in domains like AI and numerical computing. - **Introduction**: Proposed by Intel in 2013 and debuting in the Intel Xeon Phi x200 (Knights Landing) processors in 2016, AVX-512 marked a significant step in SIMD processing capabilities, improving the efficiency and speed of processors when handling data-intensive tasks. - **Foundational Extension (AVX-512F)**: The core of AVX-512 features, termed AVX-512F or AVX-512 Foundation, is a set of enhancements that all AVX-512 implementations must support. This foundational set includes the widening of most 256-bit instructions found in previous AVX versions to 512 bits, in addition to introducing new operations. These new operations range from data conversions and scatter operations to permutations, further broadening the use cases and efficiency of SIMD processing. # Impact on Your System (11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11390H): Given that your processor is an 11th Generation Intel® Core™ i7, which is part of the Tiger Lake family introduced by Intel, it natively supports AVX-512 instructions. This support means your system can take full advantage of the wide SIMD instructions that AVX-512 offers, making it capable of handling large datasets and computational tasks more efficiently than processors without AVX-512 support. # Relevance to Running Optimized LLM Inference Kernels: - **Performance Gains**: With AVX-512, especially the foundational AVX-512F, your system is better equipped to run AI model inference tasks at a higher performance level. The wide SIMD instructions can accelerate the computation of neural network operations, which are naturally parallelizable and can benefit significantly from the wide data paths and new operations provided by AVX-512. - **Quantization and Efficiency**: For tasks like weight-only quantization, where you\'re aiming to run LLMs more efficiently by reducing the precision of the weights without substantially impacting the model\'s accuracy, the capabilities of AVX-512 can play a pivotal role. By processing more data per instruction and utilizing the instruction set\'s extended capabilities for operations relevant to quantization, your system can achieve the desired reduction in model size and increase in inference speed more effectively. # Conclusion: Your 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processor, with support for AVX-512 and specifically the foundational AVX-512F instructions, is well-suited to leverage the optimizations that Intel® Neural Compressor and other tools provide for accelerating LLM inference. This advanced SIMD extension ensures that you can achieve substantial performance improvements when running optimized low-precision kernels, aligning well with the requirements for efficient LLM inference on your system."},{"instruction":"Summarize and explain the key concepts in this blog like i am a layperson: \\"\\"Open in app Sign up Sign in Search Write Highly-efficient LLM Inference on Intel Platforms Leadership performance yet compatible with llama.cpp Intel(R) Neural Compressor Intel(R) Neural Compressor · Follow 2 min read · Oct 21, 2023 81 1 Team Intel Extension for Transformers, Intel Corporation Intel® Extension for Transformers is an innovative toolkit to accelerate Transformer-based models on Intel platforms.

This is particularly important because LLMs typically require significant computational resources. # Key Points Explained: 1. **Intel® Extension for Transformers**: - Think of the Transformers as very smart robots that can read, understand, and write text almost like a human. Intel has created a special toolkit that helps these smart robots work faster on computers that use Intel chips. - The blog post talks about a special technique called \\"4-bits weight-only quantization\\" used on Intel\'s newer Xeon processors. Imagine trying to store your entire library in a small room; you\'d need to summarize the books into shorter versions. Similarly, this technique simplifies parts of the LLMs to make them quicker and lighter, without losing much of their \\"smarts\\". 2. **Comparison with llama.cpp**: - They compare their toolkit\'s performance with another tool called llama.cpp on two types of Intel processors, showing their toolkit makes things run up to 4.4 times faster. It\'s like comparing two different engines to see which one makes a car go faster on the same fuel; Intel\'s toolkit is shown to be more efficient. 3. **Performance Tests**: - They tested how well their toolkit performed in achieving fast results from LLMs by using it on two different types of Intel processors - the Xeon Platinum and the Core i9. The tests show that the toolkit can significantly speed up how quickly LLMs can generate text, making it an effective tool for anyone using these processors. - They used challenging datasets to ensure the simplified models still understood and generated text accurately. Imagine teaching your robot to understand jokes or poetry; you\'d want it to still \\"get\\" the joke or the poem even if it\'s working with a summary of all literature it knows. 4. **Support for Various Tasks**: - Beyond just making things faster, Intel\'s tools support fine-tuning, which is like teaching the smart robots to be even smarter in specific areas. They showed that using more computers (nodes) together can speed up this teaching process. # Simplified Explanation: Imagine you have a super-smart robot friend that loves reading and writing stories, poems, or even chatting with you. But this friend tends to be a bit slow because their brain (the LLM) is so big and complex. Now, Intel has created a special \\"booster\\" (the Intel® Extension for Transformers) that can help your robot friend think and respond faster, especially when using specific \\"brains\\" designed by Intel (like the Intel Xeon Scalable processors). They tested this booster with some challenging tasks, comparing it to another booster called llama.cpp, and found that Intel\'s version could help your robot friend work up to 4.4 times faster without losing their ability to understand complex ideas or jokes. This means your robot friend can still chat with you, write stories, or help you with tasks quicker than before, making them an even better companion for anyone using computers with Intel chips inside. In short, this advancement from Intel is great news for anyone who uses or is interested in AI and LLMs, as it promises faster and more efficient performance, allowing these intelligent systems to be more practical and accessible for a variety of applications."},{"instruction":"do the same thing for this technical article: \\"\\" Tensor Parallelism ======= - [Introduction](#introduction) - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [Enable Customized Model](#enable-customized-model) - [Examples](#examples) Introduction Tensor parallelism is a strategy employed to train and inference from very large language models by splitting the actual computations/tensors across multiple compute devices. It is a critical technique for the continued growth and application of massive deep learning models and offers a path to unlocking unprecedented model capacities. When we use tensor parallelism to partition and compute large language models, there are various ways in which we can perform the partitioning algorithm. In 1D algorithms, we can split by rows or columns. For a row-major order matrix, if you split by column, data rearrangement is required, which is a factor affecting performance. However, splitting a row-major order matrix by rows does not consume time. In our TP implementation, we adopt the method of pre-splitting the corresponding weights, so the time consumed for this part is one-time and does not affect inference performance. Meanwhile, another major factor impacting performance is \'all reduce\'. Since each node computes partial and incomplete results, it is necessary to perform \'all reduce\' on the output data. But all reduce is relatively time-consuming, interestingly, by using a reasonable splitting and combining method, primitives can be operated independently across nodes, which is very helpful for performance optimization. Thus, a rational splitting method becomes extremely important. Taking the FFN module as an example, if the first ```matmul``` splits by column and computes the ```matmul``` with input, it will result in two unrelated sub-matrices on each node. These two sub-matrices, when performing the second ```matmul``` operation, can proceed directly without having to perform \'all reduce\' if splitting by rows. Thus, the entire FFN module only requires one \'all reduce\', meaning that with properly tailored split implementation, even with multiple ```matmul``` operations, only one \'all reduce\' operation may be needed. <img src=\\"imgs/FFN.PNG\\" width=700 height=300 alt=\\"FFN split\\"> <br> The scenario for the attention module is more complex. As shown in the following figure, a rational split can make it so that the entire attention module only requires one \'all reduce\' operation, thus greatly saving synchronization time. <img src=\\"imgs/Attention.PNG\\" width=700 height=300 alt=\\"Attention split\\"> <br> Prerequisites Multi-node and Multi-socket communications are needed in tensor parallelism, we use oneCCL for the distributed communications. Enable Customized Model Taking \\"llama\\" as an example, we need three modifications: - First, we need to split the weight used in the ```matmul``` calculation. - Second, determine the size of ```n_head``` after splitting, based on the total number of nodes in parallel(world_size). - Finally, insert the ```all_reduce``` operator after the final matmul. For instance, when splitting the FFN (feed-forward network) module, it is visible in the FFN flowchart that both ```feed_forward.w1.weigh``` and ```feed_forward.w3.weight``` are part of the first ```matmul``` computation. This portion of the ```matmul``` should be split by column, considering the weight in ITREX is already transposed. We only need to set the ```split_type``` of these two weights to ```TP_1D_ROW``` within the ```calc_split_type()``` function in \'models/modelutils/model_files.h\'. The ```feed_forward.w1.weight``` belongs to the second part of the ```matmul``` calculation in the FFN flowchart, the ```split_type``` should be set to ```TP_1D_COLUMN```. This ensures that the partial results from the first ```matmul``` calculation can be independently used for the second ```matmul``` calculation. There are also some primitives between the two ```matmul``` operations, and since these primitives are element-wise, they are also calculated independently on their respective nodes. For the attention module, there are four weights: ```attention.wq.weight```, ```attention.wk.weight```, ```attention.wv.weight```, and ```attention.wo.weight```. The ```split_type``` for ```attention.wq.weight```, ```attention.wk.weight```and ```attention.wv.weight``` should be set to ```TP_1D_ROW```. In contrast, ```attention.wo.weight``` should be set to ```TP_1D_COLUMN```. The calculations for the primitives in between can be done independently. Once the weight splitting is complete, the actual ```n_head``` computed by each node when running the model is correspondingly reduced, so it is necessary to reset the size of ```n_head```. Code is simple like: ```C++ n_head /= world_size; n_head_kv /= world_size; ``` Finally, after the last ```matmul``` calculation, insert the ```all_reduce``` operator to sum up the partial computation results, thereby obtaining the complete computational outcome. ```C++ cur = ne_all_reduce(ctx0, cur); ``` # Build the oneCCL and setup the env ```shell git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneCCL.git cd oneCCL sed -i \'s/cpu_gpu_dpcpp/./g\' cmake/templates/oneCCLConfig.cmake.in mkdir build cd build cmake .. make -j install source <path_to_build_dir>/_install/env/setvars.sh ``` To confirm that the oneCCL installation is successful, use command: ```shell mpirun --version ``` If the command line prints log like below, means the oneCCL env is ready. ``` Intel(R) MPI Library for Linux* OS, Version 2021.9 Build 20230306 (id: d82b3071db) Copyright 2003-2023, Intel Corporation. ``` # Enable the CMake option and build executable file Compile an executable file that supports tensor parallelism by enabling the CMake option `NS_TP`. You can build the executable file like below. ```shell mkdir build cd build cmake -DNS_TP=ON .. make -j ``` # Download the model weights and quantize to q4_0 format. First you should download and convert the model to f32 format. You can also quantize the model to q4_0 format, but it is optional. ```shell python scripts/convert.py --outtype f32 --outfile EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b ``` Then quantize the model to q4_0 format(optional). ```shell python scripts/quantize.py --model_name gptj --model_file /path/to/your/ne-f32.bin --out_file ne-q4_0.bin --weight_dtype int4 ``` Examples We can config the `mpirun` to start parallel programs. Here is an example about running tensor pallelsim on 2 sockets in CPU. ```shell mpirun -np 2 -bind-to=socket ./build/bin/main_gptj -m ne-q4_0.bin --seed 1234 -t 56 -c 68 -n 32 -p \\"Once upon a time, there existed a little girl, who liked to have adventures. She wanted to go to places and meet new people, and have fun.\\" --no_mmap ``` We only add `mpirun -np 2 -bind-to=socket` to the original command to enable 2 processes to run parallel. If you want to bind specific core to each process. You can write the original command to a shell script and use command like below. ```shell mpirun -n 1 taskset -c 0-47 sh run.sh : -n 1 taskset -c 48-95 sh run.sh ``` **NOTICE**: tensor parallelsim strategy will split the model to specific node/socket, each device already use part of the original weights differently. So we should not use shared-memory of weights to avoid cross numa weight movement. Use option `--no-mmap` to disable shared weights between processes.\\"\\"","output":"Let\'s simplify and explain the concept of \\"Tensor Parallelism\\" as discussed in the technical article, focusing on how it applies to the training and using large language models (LLMs) on Intel platforms. # Simplified Overview of Tensor Parallelism: Imagine you have a giant puzzle that you want to solve. Now, one way to solve it faster is by dividing it into smaller pieces and giving each piece to different friends to work on simultaneously. Once each of them has completed their part, you bring all the pieces back together to see the complete picture. This is essentially what \\"Tensor Parallelism\\" does with complex computer tasks, especially those involving AI. # Key Concepts Explained: 1. **Big AI Models are Like Giant Puzzles**: Large language models (like those used for AI chatbots or text generation) are incredibly complex and can be slow to work with. To speed things up, tensor parallelism divides the model\'s tasks (the big puzzle) into smaller parts and spreads them across multiple computer processors (your friends working on pieces of the puzzle). 2. **Different Ways to Split the Puzzle**: When dividing tasks among processors, it\'s possible to split them in several ways - imagine cutting the puzzle either row-wise or column-wise. The article mentions that, depending on how you split it, you might have to rearrange the pieces before you can start working on them, which can affect how quickly you can solve the puzzle. 3. **Reducing the Need to Consult with Friends**: In some cases, after your friends work on their pieces, they need to share information to ensure everyone\'s work aligns correctly (akin to an \'all reduce\' operation in computing). This \\"sharing\\" step can slow things down. However, by cleverly choosing how to split the puzzle initially, you can minimize the need for these slow check-ins, speeding up the entire process. 4. **Practical Example with the FFN Module**: Using a specific part of the AI model as an example, the article explains that by splitting the puzzle (matrix multiplication) in a certain way, we can ensure that most of the work gets done independently, needing only one big check-in at the end. This is like if each piece of the puzzle could be worked on independently without constantly having to compare it with other pieces until the very end. # Practical Steps: - **Setting Up**: For this to work, especially across multiple computers (nodes), a tool called oneCCL is used to manage the communication across different parts of the system. - **Making Adjustments**: Some adjustments are needed to prepare the AI model for this type of parallel processing. This involves telling the computer exactly how to split the model\'s tasks and when to gather the pieces back together. # Running an Example: The article concludes with instructions on how to run an example of tensor parallelism, using a tool that sets up multiple computer processors to work on the model\'s tasks simultaneously. This is similar to organizing your friends, giving them puzzle pieces to work on, and setting up a system to combine their efforts efficiently. # Conclusion for Laypeople: \\"Tensor Parallelism\\" is a smart way to make big, slow tasks (like working with massive AI models) much faster by dividing the work among multiple processors. It\'s like solving a huge puzzle with the help of many friends, where finding the most efficient way to divide and recombine the work can save a lot of time. The steps outlined show how to set up this process, ensuring everything works together smoothly for quicker results."},{"instruction":"what is this github page about: \\"\\" Before you start ITREX LLM C++ Runtime (`Neural Speed`) has already supported some popular models like `LLAMA`,`GPT-J`, `GPT-NEOX`, `DOLLY`, etc.These LLMs have similar architectures and some of them share the same architect (`DOLLY` and `GPT-NEOX`). Before adding a new model, you can checkout its architecture (from Huggingface `config.json`) whether is in our [supported list](./neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68). However, LLM inference thing is complicated. It may have its own: 1. special tokenizer (or vocab); 2. architecture (or forward pipeline); 3. operators (or kernels). Generally speaking, the first and second points appear frequently for transformers-LLMs. I will show you how to run a new model as soon as possible when your model hasn\'t any problems like above or only the problem 1. The next sections will discuss about the problem 2 and the problem 3 is beyond the scope of this document. For simplicity, we take [polyglot](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/polyglot-ko-5.8b) as the example model. It has the same architecture as `GPT-NEOX` but only fewer layers. Firstly, we need to add its temp buffer in its [related model-arch header file](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h) and [re-compile](README.md#Install). ```diff static const model_scratch gptneox_mem_req(int n_layers, float scratch_size_ratio = 1.0f) { switch (n_layers) { case 44: return {2048ull * MB, 2048ull * MB, 4096ull * MB}; case 32: return {512ull * MB, 512ull * MB, 1026ull * MB}; + case 28: // 5.8B + return {512ull * MB, 512ull * MB, 1024ull * MB}; default: MODEL_ASSERT(false); } } ``` Then, use `transformers` tokenizer to encode prompt and decode return tokens instead of re-implementing C++ tokenizer. For checking text generation results, we recommend you to run this python codes below to align our runtime engine outputs with PyTorch (`FP32 data type, greedy search`). ```python from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, WeightOnlyQuantConfig from neural_speed import Model model_name = \\"EleutherAI/polyglot-ko-5.8b\\" prompt = \\"she open the door and see\\" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\\"pt\\").input_ids # pt infer pt_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) pt_model.eval() pt_outputs = pt_model.generate(inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=128) pt_ans = tokenizer.batch_decode(pt_outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] print(\\"=====pytorch result======\\") print(pt_ans) # itrex infer # fp32 config woq_config = WeightOnlyQuantConfig(not_quant=True) # model file should be in `runtime_outs` folder model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, quantization_config=woq_config, trust_remote_code=True) outputs = model.generate(inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=128) ans = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] print(\\"=====itrex result======\\") print(ans) ``` The English prompt would have the output like: ```bash =====pytorch result====== she open the door and see him. She looks at him and says, \\"How do you do?\\" He says, \\"Fine.\\" She says, \\"What do you want?\\" He says, \\"I want to go home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m going home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m =====itrex result====== she open the door and see him. She looks at him and says, \\"How do you do?\\" He says, \\"Fine.\\" She says, \\"What do you want?\\" He says, \\"I want to go home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m going home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m ``` Once you make sure your model has the same generated tokens as PyTorch, you can deploy it by using low-bits precision like `INT4` data type and customized acceleration. Please refer to `Python API` section for more details. # Enable cpp model process We enable a CPP model in the following four steps. ```mermaid graph LR; Convert-->Load; Load-->Inference; Inference-->Optimize; ``` # 1. Model conversion We need to implement corresponding serialization methods from pytorch format, which is mainly divided into the following three steps. 1.1. Hyperparamters The term **\\"hyperparamters\\"** describes a value that is used to configure the behavior of a large language model; this is in contrast to the model\'s parameters, which are the weight that were derived in the training process that was used to create the model. Each model defines its own hyperparameter structure that defines the hyperparameter values accepted by that model. Valid ITREX model files must list these values in the correct order, and each value must be represented using the correct data type. Although hyperparameters are different across models, some attributes appear in the hyperparameters for most models: - n_vocab: the size of the model\'s vocabulary - n_embd: the size of the model\'s \\" embedding layer\\", which is used during prompt ingestion. - n_layer: the number of layers in the model; each layer represents a set of weights. Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L96) as an example, ```python fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams[\\"num_attention_heads\\"])) fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams.get(\\"n_head_kv\\", 0))) # multi-query attention fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams[\\"num_hidden_layers\\"])) ``` The above `fout` is the file we need to get, and the `num_attention`, `n_head_kv`, and `num_hidden_layer` from hparams is written into fout. 1.2. Vocabulary As the name implies, a model\'s vocabulary comprises components that are used by the model to generate language (text). However, unlike the vocabulary of a human, which consists of words, the vocabulary of a large language model consists of \\"tokens\\". A token can be an entire word, but oftentimes they are word fragments. Just like humans can compose millions of words from just a dozen or two letters, large language models use tokens to express a large number of words from a relatively smaller number of components. Consider a vocabulary with the following tokens: `whi`, `ch`, `le`, `who`, and `a`; this vocabulary can be used to create the English words `\\"which\\"`, `\\"while\\"`, `\\"who\\"`, `\\"a\\"`, and `\\"leach\\"`. How would the behavior change if the model contained the following tokens: `wh`, `ich`, `ile`, `o`, and `leach`? Choices such as these allow model-creators to tune the behavior and performance of their models. As described above, the model\'s hyperparameters typically contain a value that specifies the number of tokens in the vocabulary. The vocabulary is encoded as a list of tokens, each of which includes a 32-bit integer that specifies the length of the token. If your model has some new tokenizers, we suggest using a python tokenizer from transformers and feeding the input_ids to model Python API (python example in scripts folder) Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L122) as an example to processed the vocabulary of gptneox and written it into `fout`. ```python encoder = tokenizer.vocab encoder.update(tokenizer.get_added_vocab()) byte_encoder = bytes_to_unicode() byte_decoder = {v:k for k, v in byte_encoder.items()} ``` 1.3. Model weights Finally, and largest, component of a `Neural Speed` GRAPH file is the weights of the LLM that the file represents. Abstractly, a large language model is software that is used to generate language - just like software that is used to generate images can be improved by increasing the number of colors with which images can be rendered, large language models can be improved by increasing the number of weights in the model. The total number of weights in a model is referred to as the \\"size\\" of that model. For example, the dolly-v2-3b implementation of the gpt-neox-20b language model architecture is available in several sizes, like 3B and 20B, which stand for 3 billion and 20 billion, respectively. These numbers refer to the total number of weights in that model. As described in the hyperparameters section, weights are grouped in sets called \\"layers\\", which, like hyperparameters, have structures that are uniquely defined by the model architecture; within a layer, weights are grouped in structures called \\"tensors\\". So, for instance, both dolly-v2-3B and gpt-neox-20B use layers that comprise the same tensors, but dolly-v2-3B has relatively fewer layers when compared to gpt-neox-20B. Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L149) as an example to convert model weights to `fout`. ```python fout.write(struct.pack(\\"iii\\", n_dims, len(str), ftype_cur)) for i in range(n_dims): fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", data.shape[n_dims - 1 - i])) fout.write(str) data.tofile(fout) ``` # 2. Model enablements 2.1. Model loading - Model type: Refers to the type of the model, This can be compared to the model type in the Transformers library, we can see model_class in [model_type.h](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68), here defines the basic properties of an neural speed model, including model_hparams, model_layer, model_struct.etc. If you have a new cpp model you should update [model_archs](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68). ```diff enum model_archs { MODEL_UNKNOWN, MODEL_LLAMA, MODEL_GPTJ, MODEL_MPT, MODEL_GPTNEOX, MODEL_STARCODER, MODEL_FALCON, MODEL_OPT, MODEL_BLOOM, MODEL_BAICHUAN, MODEL_CHATGLM2, MODEL_CHATGLM, + MODEL_NEW }; ``` and update [model_name_to_arch()](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L395). ```diff private: model_name_to_arch() {} // update this table if has new cpp model std::unordered_map<std::string, model_archs> name2arch_ = { {\\"unknown\\", MODEL_UNKNOWN}, {\\"llama\\", MODEL_LLAMA}, {\\"gptj\\", MODEL_GPTJ}, {\\"mpt\\", MODEL_MPT}, {\\"opt\\", MODEL_OPT}, {\\"gptneox\\", MODEL_GPTNEOX}, {\\"dolly\\", MODEL_GPTNEOX}, {\\"starcoder\\", MODEL_STARCODER}, {\\"falcon\\", MODEL_FALCON}, {\\"bloom\\", MODEL_BLOOM}, {\\"chatglm2\\", MODEL_CHATGLM2}, {\\"chatglm\\", MODEL_CHATGLM}, - {\\"baichuan\\", MODEL_BAICHUAN}}; + {\\"baichuan\\", MODEL_BAICHUAN}},{\\"new_model\\", MODEL_NEW_MODEL}}; }; ``` - Set buffer size: we need to set the corresponding buffer size in model.h according to the size of parameters for the model, just like [gptneox.h](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h), you should update [enum gptneox_model](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L21), [model_scratch](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L26) and [model class](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L39). ```diff +#ifndef NEW_MODEL_H +#define NEW_MODEL_H +#include \\"models/model_utils/model_files.h\\" +#include \\"models/model_utils/model_types.h\\" +enum new_model { + NEW_MDOEL_UNKNOWN, + NEW_MODEL_13B, +}; +static const model_scratch new_model_mem_req(int n_layers, float scratch_size_ratio = 1.0f) { + switch (n_layers) { + case N: + return {8192ull * MB, 8192ull * MB, 8192ull * MB}; + default: + MODEL_ASSERT(false); } +} +class NEW_MODEL : public IModel { + private: + model_archs name = MODEL_NEW_MODEL; + std::unique_ptr<model_model_loader> ml; + uint32_t n_layer, n_embd, n_ff, n_vocab; + int n_ctx, n_gpu_layer; + bool use_mmap, use_mlock, vocab_only; + model_scratch scratch; + public: + void init(const char* path_model, model_context& lctx, int n_ctx, int n_gpu_layers, bool use_mmap_, bool use_mlock_, + bool vocab_only_) override; + void load(model_context& lctx, model_progress_callback progress_callback, void* progress_callback_user_data) override; +}; +#endif // NEW_MODEL_H ``` - Model_load_internal: This function include model init and model load, The [model init function](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L42) initializes the model\'s hyperparameter, such as `n_layer` and `n_embd parameters`. ```cpp n_embd = hparams.n_embd; n_vocab = hparams.n_vocab; n_layer = hparams.n_layer; ``` The weights of the model in the `Neural Speed` Graph file will be loaded in [model load function](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L71). Here, we\'ll re-read some of the parameters and weights of the converted binary,include ffn, attention, and norm weight and bias, We\'ll use the mapping between the name and the weight to read the weight we need. It is shown below. ```cpp model.others[0] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.embed_in.weight\\", {n_embd, n_vocab}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[1] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.final_layer_norm.weight\\", {n_embd}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[2] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.final_layer_norm.bias\\", {n_embd}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[3] = ml->get_tensor(\\"embed_out.weight\\", {n_embd, n_vocab}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); ``` Here we use get_tensor function to read `gpt_neox_embed_in.weight` with a shape of `(n_vocab,n_embd)` tensor into `model.others[0]`. So when enabling a new model, we should implement the `new_model_utils.cpp` of the new model. 2.2. Inference process - Model_eval_internal: This function can be equivalent to the forward process in pytorch, which has the same computational process. In [gptneox.cpp](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.cpp), the model_eval_internal here will perform a complete operation on the input values, such as ffn, layernorm, mha, etc. Here\'s a layernorm operation: ```cpp cur = ne_norm(ctx0, inpL); cur = ne_add(ctx0, ne_mul(ctx0, ne_repeat(ctx0, model.layers[il].norm[0], cur), cur), ne_repeat(ctx0, model.layers[il].norm[1], cur)); ``` It is equivalent to in [gptneox.modeling](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt_neox/modeling_gpt_neox.py#L441C12-L441C12): ```python self.input_layernorm(hidden_states) ``` The `inpL` in the code above is equivalent to the `hidden_states` in the pytorch code, and we combine ne_norm, ne_add, and ne_mul to equivalentize self.input_layernorm. When enabling a new model, we should implement the `new_model.cpp` of the new model. Most of our model examples only support single prompt processing. You need to add `batch-dim` for tensors and concat `KV cache` per-batch if you want to try multi-batch inference. We recommend to use continuous batching way since it has no padding effect and can boost throughput in both offline and server scenarios. Here is an [example](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/pull/145/files) of how to modify `LLAMA` [source cpp file](neural_speed/models/llama/llama.cpp). We will show the important modifications below. ```diff // do not forget to copy all sequences in and out // 1. analyze model inputs and prepare information for inference (especially for splitting sequences) + // continuous batching (no padding) + // input shape will be [1, l_sum] + if (batch_size > 1) + MODEL_ASSERT( + (\\"llama arch only supports continuous batching inference when giving multi prompts.\\", + lctx.cont_batching)); + const bool concat_multi_seqs = batch_size > 1 ? true : false; + std::vector<int> n_tokens(batch_size); + std::vector<int> n_pasts(batch_size); + std::vector<int> n_totals(batch_size); + const int beam_size = lctx.beam_search ? lctx.beam_size : 1; + std::vector<int> block_ids(batch_size); + for (int i = 0; i < batch_size; ++i) { + n_tokens[i] = inputs[i].n_tokens; + n_pasts[i] = inputs[i].n_past; + n_totals[i] = inputs[i].n_total; + block_ids[i] = inputs[i].request_idx * beam_size + inputs[i].beam_idx; + // enforce that the first token is BOS + if (n_totals[i] == 0 && inputs[i].tokens[0] != lctx.vocab.bos_token_id) { + fprintf(stderr, \\"%s: first token must be BOS (token id is %ld) in %dth promptn\\", __func__, + lctx.vocab.bos_token_id, i); + return false; + } + } + const int seq_len_sum = std::accumulate(n_tokens.begin(), n_tokens.end(), 0); + const int infer_bs = 1; + const int infer_seq_len = seq_len_sum; // max batch num for a inference, usually it\'s larger than num of model inputs (beam search or dynamic batch size inference) + const int kv_n_ctx_block = lctx.kv_n_ctx_block; // divide kv_n_ctx_block into server groups and each of them has same shape inside + const std::vector<std::vector<int>> infer_groups = split_inputs_into_groups(inputs, n_input); // 2. for-loop RoPE // reshape 4d for Q K tensors (add batch dimension) - Qcur = ne_reshape_3d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[0], cur), head_size, n_head, N); - Kcur = ne_reshape_3d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[1], cur), head_size, n_head_kv, N); + Qcur = ne_reshape_4d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[0], cur), head_size, n_head, + infer_seq_len, infer_bs); + Kcur = ne_reshape_4d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[1], cur), head_size, n_head_kv, + infer_seq_len, infer_bs); // per_request rope + for (int gi = 0; gi < infer_groups.size(); ++gi) { + const int qk_bs = infer_groups[gi].size(); + const int qk_sl = n_tokens[infer_groups[gi].front()]; + const int qk_n_past = n_pasts[infer_groups[gi].front()]; + struct ne_tensor* Qcur_req = + ne_view_4d(ctx0, Qcur, head_size, n_head, qk_sl, qk_bs, ne_element_size(Qcur) * + head_size,ne_element_size(Qcur) * head_size * n_head, ne_element_size(Qcur) * head_size + * n_head * qk_sl, off_sl * n_head * ne_element_size(Qcur)); + ne_build_forward_expand( + &gf, ne_rope_inplace(ctx0, Qcur_req, qk_n_past, n_rot, 0, 0, hparams.freq_base, + hparams.freq_scale)); + struct ne_tensor* Kcur_req = ne_view_4d( + ctx0, Kcur, head_size, n_head_kv, qk_sl, qk_bs, ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size, + ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size * n_head_kv, ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size * n_head_kv * + qk_sl, off_sl * n_head_kv * ne_element_size(Kcur)); + ne_build_forward_expand( + &gf, ne_rope_inplace(ctx0, Kcur_req, qk_n_past, n_rot, 0, 0, hparams.freq_base, + hparams.freq_scale)); + off_sl += head_size * qk_bs * qk_sl; + } // 3. for-loop kv cache concat // we suggest storing permuted kv tensors for unified kv cache operations without MHA fusion - struct ne_tensor* k = ne_view_1d(ctx0, kv_self.k, N * n_embd_gqa, - (ne_element_size(kv_self.k) * n_embd_gqa) * (il * n_ctx + n_past)); - struct ne_tensor* v = - ne_view_2d(ctx0, kv_self.v, N, n_embd_gqa, (n_ctx)*ne_element_size(kv_self.v), - (il * n_ctx) * ne_element_size(kv_self.v) * n_embd_gqa + n_past * ne_element_size(kv_self.v)); - // important: storing RoPE-ed version of K in the KV cache!

Application - Q4_0 quant : We can quantize the model generated by convert by adding a quant layer class to quantize it into an int4 low-bit file, so as to obtain better inference performance. Register quant layer class in your new_model_utils.cpp, just like [gptneox_utils.cpp](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L163), replace `gptneox_quant_layer` to your `new_model_quant_layer`. ```diff +class new_quant_layer : public quant_layer_base { + public: + quant_params_internal get_layer_config(std::string layername, std::vector<int64_t> ne, + ne_type type) override { + bool quantize = layername.rfind(\\"weight\\") == layername.size() - 6; // size(\\"weight\\") = 6 + if (layername == \\"model.embed_tokens.weight\\") { + // special layer process, can be loaded by config file + return quant_params_internal(); // return q4_0 to cover the usage of getrow + } + quantize &= (ne.size() == 2); // quantize only linear layers, which are two-dim + if (quantize) { + return mGCfg; // use global quant config + } else { + return quant_params_internal{quant_bits::count}; // non-quant + } + } +}; +REGISTER_QUANT_LAYER_CLASS(new_model); ``` - Add new CMakeLists.txt: We need to add the newly added model to the following CMakeList.txt. New model CMakeList.txt just like [gptneox_CMakeLists.txt](neural_speed/models/gptneox/CMakeLists.txt), ```diff +set(TARGET new_model) +add_library_w_warning({TARGET} new_model.cpp new_model_utils.cpp {MODEL_UTILS_SOURCE}) +target_compile_features({TARGET} PUBLIC cxx_std_11) # don\'t bump +set_target_properties({TARGET} PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) +target_link_libraries({TARGET} PUBLIC ne_layers bestla::bestla) ``` and and new_model to [models_CMakeLists.txt](neural_speed/models/CMakeLists.txt). ```diff add_subdirectory(opt) add_subdirectory(bloom) add_subdirectory(chatglm) add_subdirectory(baichuan) +add_subdirectory(new_model) ``` 2.4. Python API We support binding Neural Speed to transformer-based Python API, which is more convenient for customers to use. You need to modify the following files. Please refer to [install-from-source](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers/blob/main/docs/installation.md#install-from-source) and [how-to-use-transformer-based-api](neural_speed/README.md#how-to-use-transformer-based-api) of using Python API. > The Python API will automatically call the convert script and quantization script to convert the hugging face model into a quantified model.

The primary goal is to make these AI models work faster and more efficiently by employing various technical strategies. Let\'s break down the key points for easier understanding: # Core Idea: Making AI Models Faster Imagine your computer is a library, and within it, there\'s a special section dedicated to very complex and large books (representing LLMs). These books hold vast amounts of knowledge but are too big and complex to be used quickly when needed. \\"Neural Speed\\" acts like a skilled librarian, finding ways to manage these books more efficiently, ensuring that when you need information from them, you get it as quickly as possible. # Techniques Used: 1. **Tensor Parallelism**: This is like splitting up a massive encyclopedia among several librarians to find information faster. By dividing the work of processing the AI model\'s data (tensors) across multiple computer processors (compute devices), it speeds up how quickly the model can \'think\' and provide answers. 2. **Special Handling for Each Model**: Some of these AI models have unique characteristics that need special attention for them to work faster. It\'s akin to having different cataloging methods for books in a library, where some rare books might need a unique approach to be accessible quickly. 3. **Optimizing Complex Calculations**: The project includes advanced methods to make the complex math behind AI models run faster. This might involve clever tricks to avoid repetitive calculations, akin to a librarian knowing exactly where in the book the needed information is, without needing to read the entire page. # Practical Steps Involved: 1. **Adding New Models**: Before incorporating a new AI model into this system, it\'s essential to check if its architectural style matches the supported ones. It\'s like ensuring a new book adheres to a categorization system the library understands. 2. **Model Adjustments**: Modifying parts of the model to fit this optimization process is required, which could involve adjusting how data is stored or processed within the model. Imagine re-binding a book so that it fits better on the library shelves. 3. **Code Examples**: The page provides code snippets illustrating how to prepare an AI model (in this case, \\"polyglot\\") for this optimized processing. These code sections are like detailed instructions for a librarian on how to catalog and handle a new complex book. 4. **Comparing Results**: To ensure the optimizations work as intended, the page suggests running tests to compare the AI model\'s performance before and after optimization, ensuring the \'answers\' it provides remain accurate and become faster. 5. **Deployment and Optimization**: For those ready to use these optimizations in practical applications, further instructions and tools are provided to help integrate these models into real-world systems. This is akin to putting the newly cataloged and optimized books into circulation for library patrons. # Conclusion: In simple terms, the GitHub page showcases a sophisticated toolkit designed to supercharge the performance of AI models on Intel hardware, making them more practical for use in various applications by speeding up their processing capabilities and making them more efficient."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

At the heart of this gothic tableau, the Bat-Family stood in a semi-circle, their expressions a mix of disbelief, concern, and barely suppressed amusement. In the center of their attentive gazes hopped a small, fluffy creature with striking blue eyes and a tuft of hair that was unmistakably reminiscent of Dick Grayson\'s signature style. The resemblance didn\'t end there; the black rabbit\'s movements were animated, almost as if he was struggling to adjust to his new, decidedly less human form. Stephanie Brown, ever the optimist, was the first to break the palpable silence, a giggle escaping her lips as she crouched down to the rabbit\'s level. \\"Okay, who brought the cute bunny into the Batcave?\\" Tim Drake, ever the detective in training, peered closer, his brow furrowing. \\"That\'s no ordinary rabbit, Steph. Look at its eyes... and that hair. It\'s—\\" Jason Todd cut him off with a grunt, folding his arms across his chest. \\"It\'s freakin\' weird is what it is. Did one of you pull a prank? Because if so, it\'s a new low, even for us.\\" Damian Wayne scowled, clearly not amused by the turn of events, while Cassandra Cain simply tilted her head, observing the creature with a quiet curiosity that spoke volumes. Before any more speculations could be thrown into the ring, the bunny—remarkably, impossibly—opened its mouth. \\"...Uh...hi guys…it\'s me,\\" came the soft, slightly squeaky voice that was unmistakably Dick Grayson\'s, albeit pitched higher and undeniably more adorable in this new, diminutive form. A collective silence fell over the group, the weight of realization hitting them all at once. Dick Grayson, their brother-in-arms and the first to don the Robin mantle, had been transformed into a black rabbit with blue eyes... and a fluffy tail. \\"I know this is...a lot to take in,\\" the bunny continued, trying to hop closer but only succeeding in eliciting a wave of concerned forward steps from the group. \\"But it\'s really me, Dick. You\'re not going to believe what happened.\\" And so, with a mix of incredulity and a growing sense of urgency, the Bat-Family listened as their erstwhile human comrade recounted the tale of his transformation. It was a story that involved a suspiciously easy infiltration mission, a mystical artifact gone awry, and a spellcaster with a penchant for turning unsuspecting victims into animals as a form of twisted amusement. As the tale unfolded, the initial shock gave way to a sense of camaraderie that only the Bat-Family could understand. They had faced countless challenges together, but this was uncharted territory. And yet, the absurdity of the situation, of discussing strategy with a talking rabbit that was one of their own, only served to reinforce the bond between them. \\"We\'re going to fix this,\\" Tim declared, the resolve in his voice leaving no room for doubt. \\"Yeah, no way are we letting you hop around in a tail and twitchy nose for longer than necessary,\\" Jason chimed in, a rare grin spreading across his face. Damian, seemingly coming to terms with the situation, nodded tersely. \\"TT. We\'ll find the spellcaster.\\" Cassandra, ever the woman of few words, simply placed a gentle hand on the bunny\'s back, her action speaking volumes of assurance. And Stephanie, still marveling at the oddity of it all, summed up the team\'s sentiment: \\"We\'ve got you, Dick. Bunny form or not, you\'re stuck with us.\\" With a renewed sense of purpose and an unexpected challenge ahead, the Bat-Family rallied around their transformed brother. They were going to get Dick back to his normal self, no matter what it took. After all, they were family, through thick and thin, in human form or as an adorably fluffy rabbit.

If you have any questions or need information on a specific topic, feel free to ask."},{"instruction":"what is this github page about? : \\"\\" Before you start ITREX LLM C++ Runtime (`Neural Speed`) has already supported some popular models like `LLAMA`,`GPT-J`, `GPT-NEOX`, `DOLLY`, etc.These LLMs have similar architectures and some of them share the same architect (`DOLLY` and `GPT-NEOX`). Before adding a new model, you can checkout its architecture (from Huggingface `config.json`) whether is in our [supported list](./neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68). However, LLM inference thing is complicated. It may have its own: 1. special tokenizer (or vocab); 2. architecture (or forward pipeline); 3. operators (or kernels). Generally speaking, the first and second points appear frequently for transformers-LLMs. I will show you how to run a new model as soon as possible when your model hasn\'t any problems like above or only the problem 1. The next sections will discuss about the problem 2 and the problem 3 is beyond the scope of this document. For simplicity, we take [polyglot](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/polyglot-ko-5.8b) as the example model. It has the same architecture as `GPT-NEOX` but only fewer layers. Firstly, we need to add its temp buffer in its [related model-arch header file](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h) and [re-compile](README.md#Install). ```diff static const model_scratch gptneox_mem_req(int n_layers, float scratch_size_ratio = 1.0f) { switch (n_layers) { case 44: return {2048ull * MB, 2048ull * MB, 4096ull * MB}; case 32: return {512ull * MB, 512ull * MB, 1026ull * MB}; + case 28: // 5.8B + return {512ull * MB, 512ull * MB, 1024ull * MB}; default: MODEL_ASSERT(false); } } ``` Then, use `transformers` tokenizer to encode prompt and decode return tokens instead of re-implementing C++ tokenizer. For checking text generation results, we recommend you to run this python codes below to align our runtime engine outputs with PyTorch (`FP32 data type, greedy search`). ```python from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, WeightOnlyQuantConfig from neural_speed import Model model_name = \\"EleutherAI/polyglot-ko-5.8b\\" prompt = \\"she open the door and see\\" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\\"pt\\").input_ids # pt infer pt_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) pt_model.eval() pt_outputs = pt_model.generate(inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=128) pt_ans = tokenizer.batch_decode(pt_outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] print(\\"=====pytorch result======\\") print(pt_ans) # itrex infer # fp32 config woq_config = WeightOnlyQuantConfig(not_quant=True) # model file should be in `runtime_outs` folder model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, quantization_config=woq_config, trust_remote_code=True) outputs = model.generate(inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=128) ans = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] print(\\"=====itrex result======\\") print(ans) ``` The English prompt would have the output like: ```bash =====pytorch result====== she open the door and see him. She looks at him and says, \\"How do you do?\\" He says, \\"Fine.\\" She says, \\"What do you want?\\" He says, \\"I want to go home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m going home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m =====itrex result====== she open the door and see him. She looks at him and says, \\"How do you do?\\" He says, \\"Fine.\\" She says, \\"What do you want?\\" He says, \\"I want to go home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m going home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m ``` Once you make sure your model has the same generated tokens as PyTorch, you can deploy it by using low-bits precision like `INT4` data type and customized acceleration. Please refer to `Python API` section for more details. # Enable cpp model process We enable a CPP model in the following four steps. ```mermaid graph LR; Convert-->Load; Load-->Inference; Inference-->Optimize; ``` # 1. Model conversion We need to implement corresponding serialization methods from pytorch format, which is mainly divided into the following three steps. 1.1. Hyperparamters The term **\\"hyperparamters\\"** describes a value that is used to configure the behavior of a large language model; this is in contrast to the model\'s parameters, which are the weight that were derived in the training process that was used to create the model. Each model defines its own hyperparameter structure that defines the hyperparameter values accepted by that model. Valid ITREX model files must list these values in the correct order, and each value must be represented using the correct data type. Although hyperparameters are different across models, some attributes appear in the hyperparameters for most models: - n_vocab: the size of the model\'s vocabulary - n_embd: the size of the model\'s \\" embedding layer\\", which is used during prompt ingestion. - n_layer: the number of layers in the model; each layer represents a set of weights. Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L96) as an example, ```python fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams[\\"num_attention_heads\\"])) fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams.get(\\"n_head_kv\\", 0))) # multi-query attention fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams[\\"num_hidden_layers\\"])) ``` The above `fout` is the file we need to get, and the `num_attention`, `n_head_kv`, and `num_hidden_layer` from hparams is written into fout. 1.2. Vocabulary As the name implies, a model\'s vocabulary comprises components that are used by the model to generate language (text). However, unlike the vocabulary of a human, which consists of words, the vocabulary of a large language model consists of \\"tokens\\". A token can be an entire word, but oftentimes they are word fragments. Just like humans can compose millions of words from just a dozen or two letters, large language models use tokens to express a large number of words from a relatively smaller number of components. Consider a vocabulary with the following tokens: `whi`, `ch`, `le`, `who`, and `a`; this vocabulary can be used to create the English words `\\"which\\"`, `\\"while\\"`, `\\"who\\"`, `\\"a\\"`, and `\\"leach\\"`. How would the behavior change if the model contained the following tokens: `wh`, `ich`, `ile`, `o`, and `leach`? Choices such as these allow model-creators to tune the behavior and performance of their models. As described above, the model\'s hyperparameters typically contain a value that specifies the number of tokens in the vocabulary. The vocabulary is encoded as a list of tokens, each of which includes a 32-bit integer that specifies the length of the token. If your model has some new tokenizers, we suggest using a python tokenizer from transformers and feeding the input_ids to model Python API (python example in scripts folder) Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L122) as an example to processed the vocabulary of gptneox and written it into `fout`. ```python encoder = tokenizer.vocab encoder.update(tokenizer.get_added_vocab()) byte_encoder = bytes_to_unicode() byte_decoder = {v:k for k, v in byte_encoder.items()} ``` 1.3. Model weights Finally, and largest, component of a `Neural Speed` GRAPH file is the weights of the LLM that the file represents. Abstractly, a large language model is software that is used to generate language - just like software that is used to generate images can be improved by increasing the number of colors with which images can be rendered, large language models can be improved by increasing the number of weights in the model. The total number of weights in a model is referred to as the \\"size\\" of that model. For example, the dolly-v2-3b implementation of the gpt-neox-20b language model architecture is available in several sizes, like 3B and 20B, which stand for 3 billion and 20 billion, respectively. These numbers refer to the total number of weights in that model. As described in the hyperparameters section, weights are grouped in sets called \\"layers\\", which, like hyperparameters, have structures that are uniquely defined by the model architecture; within a layer, weights are grouped in structures called \\"tensors\\". So, for instance, both dolly-v2-3B and gpt-neox-20B use layers that comprise the same tensors, but dolly-v2-3B has relatively fewer layers when compared to gpt-neox-20B. Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L149) as an example to convert model weights to `fout`. ```python fout.write(struct.pack(\\"iii\\", n_dims, len(str), ftype_cur)) for i in range(n_dims): fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", data.shape[n_dims - 1 - i])) fout.write(str) data.tofile(fout) ``` # 2. Model enablements 2.1. Model loading - Model type: Refers to the type of the model, This can be compared to the model type in the Transformers library, we can see model_class in [model_type.h](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68), here defines the basic properties of an neural speed model, including model_hparams, model_layer, model_struct.etc. If you have a new cpp model you should update [model_archs](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68). ```diff enum model_archs { MODEL_UNKNOWN, MODEL_LLAMA, MODEL_GPTJ, MODEL_MPT, MODEL_GPTNEOX, MODEL_STARCODER, MODEL_FALCON, MODEL_OPT, MODEL_BLOOM, MODEL_BAICHUAN, MODEL_CHATGLM2, MODEL_CHATGLM, + MODEL_NEW }; ``` and update [model_name_to_arch()](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L395). ```diff private: model_name_to_arch() {} // update this table if has new cpp model std::unordered_map<std::string, model_archs> name2arch_ = { {\\"unknown\\", MODEL_UNKNOWN}, {\\"llama\\", MODEL_LLAMA}, {\\"gptj\\", MODEL_GPTJ}, {\\"mpt\\", MODEL_MPT}, {\\"opt\\", MODEL_OPT}, {\\"gptneox\\", MODEL_GPTNEOX}, {\\"dolly\\", MODEL_GPTNEOX}, {\\"starcoder\\", MODEL_STARCODER}, {\\"falcon\\", MODEL_FALCON}, {\\"bloom\\", MODEL_BLOOM}, {\\"chatglm2\\", MODEL_CHATGLM2}, {\\"chatglm\\", MODEL_CHATGLM}, - {\\"baichuan\\", MODEL_BAICHUAN}}; + {\\"baichuan\\", MODEL_BAICHUAN}},{\\"new_model\\", MODEL_NEW_MODEL}}; }; ``` - Set buffer size: we need to set the corresponding buffer size in model.h according to the size of parameters for the model, just like [gptneox.h](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h), you should update [enum gptneox_model](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L21), [model_scratch](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L26) and [model class](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L39). ```diff +#ifndef NEW_MODEL_H +#define NEW_MODEL_H +#include \\"models/model_utils/model_files.h\\" +#include \\"models/model_utils/model_types.h\\" +enum new_model { + NEW_MDOEL_UNKNOWN, + NEW_MODEL_13B, +}; +static const model_scratch new_model_mem_req(int n_layers, float scratch_size_ratio = 1.0f) { + switch (n_layers) { + case N: + return {8192ull * MB, 8192ull * MB, 8192ull * MB}; + default: + MODEL_ASSERT(false); } +} +class NEW_MODEL : public IModel { + private: + model_archs name = MODEL_NEW_MODEL; + std::unique_ptr<model_model_loader> ml; + uint32_t n_layer, n_embd, n_ff, n_vocab; + int n_ctx, n_gpu_layer; + bool use_mmap, use_mlock, vocab_only; + model_scratch scratch; + public: + void init(const char* path_model, model_context& lctx, int n_ctx, int n_gpu_layers, bool use_mmap_, bool use_mlock_, + bool vocab_only_) override; + void load(model_context& lctx, model_progress_callback progress_callback, void* progress_callback_user_data) override; +}; +#endif // NEW_MODEL_H ``` - Model_load_internal: This function include model init and model load, The [model init function](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L42) initializes the model\'s hyperparameter, such as `n_layer` and `n_embd parameters`. ```cpp n_embd = hparams.n_embd; n_vocab = hparams.n_vocab; n_layer = hparams.n_layer; ``` The weights of the model in the `Neural Speed` Graph file will be loaded in [model load function](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L71). Here, we\'ll re-read some of the parameters and weights of the converted binary,include ffn, attention, and norm weight and bias, We\'ll use the mapping between the name and the weight to read the weight we need. It is shown below. ```cpp model.others[0] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.embed_in.weight\\", {n_embd, n_vocab}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[1] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.final_layer_norm.weight\\", {n_embd}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[2] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.final_layer_norm.bias\\", {n_embd}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[3] = ml->get_tensor(\\"embed_out.weight\\", {n_embd, n_vocab}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); ``` Here we use get_tensor function to read `gpt_neox_embed_in.weight` with a shape of `(n_vocab,n_embd)` tensor into `model.others[0]`. So when enabling a new model, we should implement the `new_model_utils.cpp` of the new model. 2.2. Inference process - Model_eval_internal: This function can be equivalent to the forward process in pytorch, which has the same computational process. In [gptneox.cpp](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.cpp), the model_eval_internal here will perform a complete operation on the input values, such as ffn, layernorm, mha, etc. Here\'s a layernorm operation: ```cpp cur = ne_norm(ctx0, inpL); cur = ne_add(ctx0, ne_mul(ctx0, ne_repeat(ctx0, model.layers[il].norm[0], cur), cur), ne_repeat(ctx0, model.layers[il].norm[1], cur)); ``` It is equivalent to in [gptneox.modeling](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt_neox/modeling_gpt_neox.py#L441C12-L441C12): ```python self.input_layernorm(hidden_states) ``` The `inpL` in the code above is equivalent to the `hidden_states` in the pytorch code, and we combine ne_norm, ne_add, and ne_mul to equivalentize self.input_layernorm. When enabling a new model, we should implement the `new_model.cpp` of the new model. Most of our model examples only support single prompt processing. You need to add `batch-dim` for tensors and concat `KV cache` per-batch if you want to try multi-batch inference. We recommend to use continuous batching way since it has no padding effect and can boost throughput in both offline and server scenarios. Here is an [example](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/pull/145/files) of how to modify `LLAMA` [source cpp file](neural_speed/models/llama/llama.cpp). We will show the important modifications below. ```diff // do not forget to copy all sequences in and out // 1. analyze model inputs and prepare information for inference (especially for splitting sequences) + // continuous batching (no padding) + // input shape will be [1, l_sum] + if (batch_size > 1) + MODEL_ASSERT( + (\\"llama arch only supports continuous batching inference when giving multi prompts.\\", + lctx.cont_batching)); + const bool concat_multi_seqs = batch_size > 1 ? true : false; + std::vector<int> n_tokens(batch_size); + std::vector<int> n_pasts(batch_size); + std::vector<int> n_totals(batch_size); + const int beam_size = lctx.beam_search ? lctx.beam_size : 1; + std::vector<int> block_ids(batch_size); + for (int i = 0; i < batch_size; ++i) { + n_tokens[i] = inputs[i].n_tokens; + n_pasts[i] = inputs[i].n_past; + n_totals[i] = inputs[i].n_total; + block_ids[i] = inputs[i].request_idx * beam_size + inputs[i].beam_idx; + // enforce that the first token is BOS + if (n_totals[i] == 0 && inputs[i].tokens[0] != lctx.vocab.bos_token_id) { + fprintf(stderr, \\"%s: first token must be BOS (token id is %ld) in %dth promptn\\", __func__, + lctx.vocab.bos_token_id, i); + return false; + } + } + const int seq_len_sum = std::accumulate(n_tokens.begin(), n_tokens.end(), 0); + const int infer_bs = 1; + const int infer_seq_len = seq_len_sum; // max batch num for a inference, usually it\'s larger than num of model inputs (beam search or dynamic batch size inference) + const int kv_n_ctx_block = lctx.kv_n_ctx_block; // divide kv_n_ctx_block into server groups and each of them has same shape inside + const std::vector<std::vector<int>> infer_groups = split_inputs_into_groups(inputs, n_input); // 2. for-loop RoPE // reshape 4d for Q K tensors (add batch dimension) - Qcur = ne_reshape_3d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[0], cur), head_size, n_head, N); - Kcur = ne_reshape_3d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[1], cur), head_size, n_head_kv, N); + Qcur = ne_reshape_4d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[0], cur), head_size, n_head, + infer_seq_len, infer_bs); + Kcur = ne_reshape_4d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[1], cur), head_size, n_head_kv, + infer_seq_len, infer_bs); // per_request rope + for (int gi = 0; gi < infer_groups.size(); ++gi) { + const int qk_bs = infer_groups[gi].size(); + const int qk_sl = n_tokens[infer_groups[gi].front()]; + const int qk_n_past = n_pasts[infer_groups[gi].front()]; + struct ne_tensor* Qcur_req = + ne_view_4d(ctx0, Qcur, head_size, n_head, qk_sl, qk_bs, ne_element_size(Qcur) * + head_size,ne_element_size(Qcur) * head_size * n_head, ne_element_size(Qcur) * head_size + * n_head * qk_sl, off_sl * n_head * ne_element_size(Qcur)); + ne_build_forward_expand( + &gf, ne_rope_inplace(ctx0, Qcur_req, qk_n_past, n_rot, 0, 0, hparams.freq_base, + hparams.freq_scale)); + struct ne_tensor* Kcur_req = ne_view_4d( + ctx0, Kcur, head_size, n_head_kv, qk_sl, qk_bs, ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size, + ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size * n_head_kv, ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size * n_head_kv * + qk_sl, off_sl * n_head_kv * ne_element_size(Kcur)); + ne_build_forward_expand( + &gf, ne_rope_inplace(ctx0, Kcur_req, qk_n_past, n_rot, 0, 0, hparams.freq_base, + hparams.freq_scale)); + off_sl += head_size * qk_bs * qk_sl; + } // 3. for-loop kv cache concat // we suggest storing permuted kv tensors for unified kv cache operations without MHA fusion - struct ne_tensor* k = ne_view_1d(ctx0, kv_self.k, N * n_embd_gqa, - (ne_element_size(kv_self.k) * n_embd_gqa) * (il * n_ctx + n_past)); - struct ne_tensor* v = - ne_view_2d(ctx0, kv_self.v, N, n_embd_gqa, (n_ctx)*ne_element_size(kv_self.v), - (il * n_ctx) * ne_element_size(kv_self.v) * n_embd_gqa + n_past * ne_element_size(kv_self.v)); - // important: storing RoPE-ed version of K in the KV cache!

Application - Q4_0 quant : We can quantize the model generated by convert by adding a quant layer class to quantize it into an int4 low-bit file, so as to obtain better inference performance. Register quant layer class in your new_model_utils.cpp, just like [gptneox_utils.cpp](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L163), replace `gptneox_quant_layer` to your `new_model_quant_layer`. ```diff +class new_quant_layer : public quant_layer_base { + public: + quant_params_internal get_layer_config(std::string layername, std::vector<int64_t> ne, + ne_type type) override { + bool quantize = layername.rfind(\\"weight\\") == layername.size() - 6; // size(\\"weight\\") = 6 + if (layername == \\"model.embed_tokens.weight\\") { + // special layer process, can be loaded by config file + return quant_params_internal(); // return q4_0 to cover the usage of getrow + } + quantize &= (ne.size() == 2); // quantize only linear layers, which are two-dim + if (quantize) { + return mGCfg; // use global quant config + } else { + return quant_params_internal{quant_bits::count}; // non-quant + } + } +}; +REGISTER_QUANT_LAYER_CLASS(new_model); ``` - Add new CMakeLists.txt: We need to add the newly added model to the following CMakeList.txt. New model CMakeList.txt just like [gptneox_CMakeLists.txt](neural_speed/models/gptneox/CMakeLists.txt), ```diff +set(TARGET new_model) +add_library_w_warning({TARGET} new_model.cpp new_model_utils.cpp {MODEL_UTILS_SOURCE}) +target_compile_features({TARGET} PUBLIC cxx_std_11) # don\'t bump +set_target_properties({TARGET} PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) +target_link_libraries({TARGET} PUBLIC ne_layers bestla::bestla) ``` and and new_model to [models_CMakeLists.txt](neural_speed/models/CMakeLists.txt). ```diff add_subdirectory(opt) add_subdirectory(bloom) add_subdirectory(chatglm) add_subdirectory(baichuan) +add_subdirectory(new_model) ``` 2.4. Python API We support binding Neural Speed to transformer-based Python API, which is more convenient for customers to use. You need to modify the following files. Please refer to [install-from-source](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers/blob/main/docs/installation.md#install-from-source) and [how-to-use-transformer-based-api](neural_speed/README.md#how-to-use-transformer-based-api) of using Python API. > The Python API will automatically call the convert script and quantization script to convert the hugging face model into a quantified model. Please ensure that the scripts have been added. Files need to be modified: - `neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt` - `neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp` - `neural_speed/__init__.py` If `new_model` will be added, modify the code as follows: ```diff diff --git a/neural_speed/__init__.py b/neural_speed/__init__.py index aaeab8d16a..12a835e652 100644 --- a/neural_speed/__init__.py +++ b/neural_speed/__init__.py @@ -57,6 +57,8 @@ class Model: import neural_speed.baichuan_cpp as cpp_model elif model_name == \\"polyglot\\": import neural_speed.polyglot_cpp as cpp_model + elif model_name == \\"new_model\\": # read from config.json->model_type + import neural_speed.new_model_cpp as cpp_model else: raise TypeError(\\"Unsupported model type {}!\\".format(model_name)) self.module = cpp_model diff --git a/neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt b/neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt index d86107d26e..36d30cabe3 100644 --- a/neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt +++ b/neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt @@ -67,6 +67,7 @@ compile_quant(quant_chatglm quant_model.cpp chatglm chatglm) compile_quant(quant_chatglm2 quant_model.cpp chatglm2 chatglm2) compile_quant(quant_baichuan quant_model.cpp baichuan baichuan) compile_quant(quant_mistral quant_model.cpp mistral llama) +compile_quant(quant_new_model quant_model.cpp new_model new_model) # all models running if (NE_PYTHON_API) @@ -88,6 +89,7 @@ set(mymap_chatglm 11) set(mymap_baichuan 12) set(mymap_polyglot 13) set(mymap_mistral 14) +set(mymap_new_model 15) function(compile_run TARGET SRC MODEL_NAME MODEL_LIB) add_executable_w_warning({TARGET} {SRC}) @@ -120,3 +122,4 @@ compile_run(run_chatglm2 main_run.cpp chatglm2 chatglm2) compile_run(run_chatglm main_run.cpp chatglm chatglm) compile_run(run_baichuan main_run.cpp baichuan baichuan) compile_run(run_mistral main_run.cpp mistral llama) +compile_run(run_new_model main_run.cpp new_model new_model) diff --git a/neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp b/neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp index 894be0134d..a9a57c0a9e 100644 --- a/neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp +++ b/neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp @@ -471,6 +471,10 @@ PYBIND11_MODULE(polyglot_cpp, m) PYBIND11_MODULE(mistral_cpp, m) +#elif MODEL_NAME_ID == 15 + +PYBIND11_MODULE(new_model_cpp, m) + #endif { m.doc() = \\"cpp model python binding\\"; ``` # 3.

As of my last update, only a handful of the world\'s richest individuals and some corporations have reached or exceeded a market value or net worth in the ballpark of a trillion dollars. However, aiming for success and financial stability is certainly commendable. Here are a few broad strategies people often pursue towards financial success: 1. **Entrepreneurship**: Starting and scaling a successful business is one of the most common paths towards significant wealth. It requires identifying a market need, creating a product or service to meet that need, and effectively managing the growth of the company. 2. **Investments**: Investing in stocks, bonds, real estate, or starting your own business can yield high returns. The key is to start early, diversify your investments, and have a long-term perspective. 3. **Innovation**: Creating something new, whether it\'s an innovative product, technology, or a novel approach in an existing market, can generate immense wealth. Think of the people behind major tech companies or significant software advancements. 4. **Savings and frugality**: While savings alone might not get you to a trillion dollars, combining it with savvy investment strategies can grow your wealth over time. Living below your means and saving a significant portion of your income can create a substantial financial reserve to invest. 5. **Education and skills**: Enhancing your education and skills can increase your earning potential. High earners often have specialized skills in high demand, which can translate into better investment opportunities. It\'s also important to be realistic. Achieving extreme wealth is rare and often involves a combination of hard work, timing, innovation, and sometimes, luck. Many people aim for financial security and freedom rather than a specific wealth target, focusing on building a fulfilling life rather than accumulating a certain amount of money. Remember, money is a tool. Achieving personal happiness, contributing to the wellbeing of others, and finding satisfaction in your accomplishments are invaluable goals that don\'t always correlate with the size of your bank account."},{"instruction":"personel tablosundan PersonelAdi r ile biten verileri küçükten büyüğe sıralayan sql kodu nedir","output":"Aşağıdaki SQL sorgusu, `PersonelAdi` sütunu \\"r\\" harfi ile biten verileri seçer ve sonuçları `PersonelAdi`\'ye göre küçükten büyüğe (alfabetik olarak A\'dan Z\'ye) sıralamak için kullanılır: ```sql SELECT * FROM personel WHERE PersonelAdi LIKE \'%r\' ORDER BY PersonelAdi ASC; ``` Bu SQL sorgusunda `LIKE \'%r\'` ifadesi, `PersonelAdi` alanındaki değerlerin \\"r\\" harfi ile bitenlerini filtrelemek için kullanılır.

Each day, as you walk the stone paths that weave like threads through the heart of the campus, your eyes inevitably find her - Lila, the embodiment of everything you believe you lack. Lila moves with a grace that seems to bend the very light around her, her laughter a melody that resonates deep within your chest, leaving echoes of longing in its wake. She is surrounded, always, by a constellation of admirers, her popularity untarnished, her charm unyielding. And in the shadow of that radiant presence, you feel invisible, insignificant - a specter adrift in her solar system. Your envy gnaws at you, a relentless hunger for something you can\'t define, until the day you stumble upon a tome buried within the cobwebbed silence of the college library\'s oldest section. Its pages whisper of ancient magics, of forbidden spells capable of tearing down the very barriers of self, and in its words, you see a path laid bare before you. With trembling hands and a heart heavy with both anticipation and dread, you prepare the ritual. The incantations taste strange on your tongue, words twisting in the air, and as the final syllable shatters the silence, a surge of energy washes over you, obliterating everything you thought you knew. You awaken to find yourself enveloped in an unfamiliar yet exhilarating sense of being. The world unfurls from a different perspective, colors more vivid, sounds more crisp, as if you\'re experiencing life for the very first time. Panic flutters in your chest, but it\'s swiftly overshadowed by an intoxicating rush of empowerment. You are her - Lila, the girl whose life you\'ve envied, whose body you now inhabit. Navigating her life proves more challenging than you anticipated. Each step, each gesture, must be calculated, mimicking the natural grace you had once watched from afar. You encounter friends you don\'t know, respond to inside jokes you don\'t understand, and all the while, a growing sense of unease begins to take root within you. As days blur into weeks, the initial thrill of your new existence dims, overshadowed by the stark realization of the emptiness of your conquest. Lila\'s life, seen from the inside, is a tapestry of complexities and nuances that you could never have imagined from your distant, envious vantage point. Her charm, you realize, is not merely a superficial allure but a reflection of her genuine warmth and empathy, qualities you find yourself struggling to emulate. Haunted by the specter of the boy you once were, you come to understand that the essence of a person cannot be stolen or mimicked; it is a kaleidoscope of experiences, relationships, and inner truths that cannot be replicated through magic or wishful thinking. In your quest for what you believed you lacked, you\'ve lost a piece of yourself, adrift within a life that was never yours to claim. The revelation comes like a whisper of wind through autumn leaves, a quiet reminder of the transformative power of acceptance and the courage required to embrace one\'s own identity. With a heart heavy with longing for a redemption you\'re not sure you deserve, you seek out the ancient tome once more, desperate for a spell that might undo what you have wrought. The transition back to your own body, your own life, is bittersweet, a mix of relief and regret. As you stand once again on the precipice of your own existence, gazing across the campus with eyes now wiser to the complexities of the human heart, you find a newfound resolve stirring within you. No longer will you covet the lives of others, for you understand now that the true magic lies in the journey of becoming, of embracing the unique beauty and potential within. And as you walk the stone paths of the college, a specter no longer, but a soul reborn, you step into the light of your own story, ready to weave it with the vibrant threads of dreams, authenticity, and self-compassion."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Hoje, vamos mergulhar nas ricas verdades de Provérbios 23, sob a orientação do Espírito Santo e a sabedoria compartilhada por um dos grandes pregadores de nosso tempo, o Reverendo Billy Graham, homem de Deus que com sua fé e dedicação nos mostrou o caminho para uma vida plena em Cristo. Preparem-se para uma jornada rumo ao crescimento espiritual e à transformação pessoal. # Reflexão: **Parte 1: A Sabedoria no Coração** O capítulo 23 de Provérbios nos abre os olhos para a verdadeira fonte de sabedoria: o coração alinhado com os preceitos do Senhor. Billy Graham nos ensinou que, \\"a sabedoria consiste em aplicar a Palavra de Deus em nosso cotidiano\\". Ao falarmos em sabedoria, não nos referimos simplesmente ao conhecimento ou erudição, mas à capacidade de discernir o bem do mal nos momentos decisivos de nossa vida. É nos versículos 12-14 deste capítulo que somos convidados a aplicar o nosso coração à instrução e os nossos ouvidos, às palavras do conhecimento, pois a disciplina, embora pareça dura no momento, é o caminho para a vida. **Parte 2: Guardando o Coração** \\"Guarda o teu coração acima de tudo, porque dele emanam as fontes da vida\\", ecoa em Provérbios 4:23, e neste capítulo 23, somos novamente lembrados da importância de vigiar nossos corações. O convite é para não invejarmos os pecadores em nosso coração (v. 17), mas antes, nutrirmos constantemente o nosso coração na presença de Deus, o verdadeiro alimento para nossa alma. Billy Graham, com sua vida de devoção e fé, demonstrou que ao manter o coração limpo e focado em Deus, podemos resistir às diversas tentações que nos cercam. **Parte 3: A Vida Além das Aparências** Provérbios 23:4-5 nos adverte sobre a busca incessante pela riqueza e pelo sucesso terreno, nos lembrando de que a verdadeira riqueza se encontra na nossa relação com Deus. \\"Não te fatigues para enriqueceres; deixa de ser sábio aos teus próprios olhos\\", nos aconselha o sábio. Billy Graham vivenciou isso ao pregar a Cristo acima de tudo, enfatizando que nossa maior conquista é o relacionamento com Deus, aquele que jamais nos abandonará ou nos decepcionará. # Oração Empolgada e Devotada: Oh, Pai Celestial, nós Te agradecemos profundemente pelo Teu amor e Tua sabedoria que nos guiam através dos complexos caminhos desta vida. Que possamos, com corações humildes e espíritos sedentos, buscar a Tua sabedoria em cada decisão, cada passo e cada desafio que enfrentamos. Que a Tua Palavra seja a luz que ilumina o nosso caminho e o alicerce sobre o qual construímos a nossa existência. Ajuda-nos, Senhor, a guardar o nosso coração de toda a inveja e cobiça, mantendo os nossos olhos fixos em Ti, a verdadeira fonte de vida e paz eterna. Por Cristo Jesus, amém. # Encerramento: Irmãos e irmãs, espero que esta reflexão tenha tocado seus corações e alimentado suas almas com a sabedoria que só pode ser encontrada em Deus.

Your days were spent in quiet observation, a bystander to the lives that seemed so much more brilliant than your own. Among these lives, one stood out, blazing like a beacon: Sarah. Everything about her was enviable - her grace, her popularity, her seemingly effortless charm. She was the sun around which the social universe of your college revolved, and you, merely a distant, orbiting celestial body, invisible in her radiant light. The longing to know what it felt like to be her - to experience the adoration, the ease of every interaction, and yes, to embody the charm and allure attributed to her femininity - grew each day. It began as a whisper in your thoughts, an idle daydream, but it didn\'t remain that way for long. The whisper turned into a roar, a vehement desire to step into her shoes, if only for a moment. Amidst the ancient texts of the college library, rumored to house knowledge beyond the mundane, you found your answer. Hidden between dusty covers of forgotten lore, you discovered it - magic potent enough to grant you your fervent wish. With a mixture of trepidation and exhilaration, you set the plan into motion under the veil of a moonless night. The incantation was complex, requiring precision and, more critically, a deep-seated desire for transformation. You had both. As the last syllables of the spell faded into the stillness of the night, reality shifted. You opened your eyes, not as the observer you had always been, but as the observed. You were Sarah. The realization was dizzying. Her body felt unfamiliar, but the power of her female form was exhilarating. You moved with a grace that was not your own but now belonged to you. Mirroring Sarah\'s mannerisms, you found yourself wrapped in the fabric of her life, attention and compliments lavishing upon you like sunlight. For a moment, it was everything you had dreamed of. However, as you navigated through Sarah\'s life, cracks began to show in the perfect facade you had coveted from afar. Expectations weighed heavily on your - now her - shoulders. Every action scrutinized, every choice analyzed. The charm and allure came with their shackles. Friendships, you realized, were not as deep-rooted as they appeared; some hung on out of interest, others out of habit. And then, there was the profound, unsettling loneliness that gnawed at your heart, a loneliness magnified by the popularity that had once seemed so desirable. The experience, rather than sating your envy, made it curdle into something else - empathy. You began to understand that the grass, though greener, bore its share of wilted patches. The charm of femininity, the allure that had seemed so inviting, had its thorns. It was a garden that required constant tending, often at great personal cost. As days passed, the desire to return to your own life grew, entwined with a newfound understanding of Sarah\'s challenges and struggles, and a deeper appreciation for the nuances of your own existence. When the spell\'s duration waned, returning you to your original form, the relief was palpable. Standing once more as a spectator in Sarah\'s world, you carried with you not envy, but a profound understanding of the complexities of her life, and by extension, the lives of those around you. The magic had not only altered your external experience but had transformed your internal perspective. You realized then that magic, in its most transformative capacity, lay not in spells and incantations, but in the newfound empathy that allowed you to appreciate the intricacies of human existence in all its forms. The experience had irrevocably changed you, not by fulfilling your original wish, but by revealing a deeper truth about the connectedness and shared struggles of all people, regardless of the facade they present to the world."},{"instruction":"Generate damage types in a low-fantasy modern RPG, which is set on post-apocalyptic Earth.","output":"In a low-fantasy, post-apocalyptic Earth setting for a modern RPG, damage types can stem from both the remnants of civilization\'s past technologies and the mysterious, somewhat supernatural forces that have arisen in the wake of the apocalypse. These damage types would reflect the need for survival amongst broken cities, fierce wilderness, and the strange, often dangerous anomalies caused by the cataclysm. Here is a list of potential damage types for such a setting: 1. **Ballistic Damage:** Traditional firearms and improvised ranged weapons such as crossbows and slingshots. Bullets, arrows, and other projectiles cause ballistic damage, representing one of the most common forms of attack in a world with remnants of modern military and civilian weaponry. 2. **Bludgeoning Damage:** From hammers to clubs and thrown rocks, bludgeoning damage comes from impacts with hard objects. It is the most straightforward type of physical harm, found in both melee and improvised weapons. 3. **Cutting Damage:** Swords, knives, and broken glass—all remnants of a civilization in ruins—deliver cutting damage. This type involves lacerations, slicing wounds, and is common in hand-to-hand combat and survival situations. 4. **Burn Damage:** Not solely the domain of fire, burn damage encompasses all forms of high heat, including incendiary weapons, fire traps, and natural hazards like wildfires. In a post-apocalyptic world, burn damage could also come from unconventional sources, such as chemical fires. 5. **Radiation Damage:** A subtle yet deadly type of damage, radiation impacts the body at a cellular level. It could stem from contaminated areas, nuclear fallout, or weapons designed to emit radiation. Long exposure leads to sickness, weakness, and death. 6. **Chemical Damage:** Toxic chemicals, either from industrial remnants or crafted by survivors, cause chemical damage. This type of damage can result from exposure to corrosive substances, poisons, and gases. 7. **Electrical Damage:** Amidst the ruins, live electrical hazards from downed power lines, jury-rigged traps, or even electrical storms caused by atmospheric disturbances can electrocute survivors. 8. **Psychic Damage:** In a low-fantasy setting, the mind could be a battlefield. Psychic damage stems from mental attacks, hallucinations, and manipulation, perhaps wielded by individuals who have developed such powers post-apocalypse. 9. **Mystic Damage:** Rooted in the low-fantasy elements of the setting, mystic damage is caused by curses, dark rituals, or ancient artifacts that have begun to awaken. This could involve spectral attacks, energy bursts, or necrotic damage from undead creatures. 10. **Environmental Damage:** The harsh realities of a world in ruin. This includes damage from extreme temperatures, lack of oxygen in certain areas, high-pressure environments, and other natural hazards like avalanches or earthquakes. 11. **Mutation Damage:** Unique to a post-apocalyptic setting, mutation damage occurs when an individual is harmed by the physical assault of mutated flora and fauna, or through exposure to substances that cause rapid and grotesque mutation. These damage types allow for a diverse range of encounters and challenges, reflecting the myriad dangers in a world that has seen the collapse of civilization mixed with the emergence of low-fantasy elements. Players would need to navigate not only the physical threats but also the mysterious and sometimes supernatural hazards that now populate the Earth."},{"instruction":"Generate several name of custom fictional ammunition of a rifle.

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Joey…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Joey as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Joey Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Joey Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Joey kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Joey…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?..REmember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","output":"This outline for an alternate universe Dick Grayson, now known as Nightshade, provides a compelling and complex character deeply anchored in a rich, morally grey narrative. It cleverly inverts the traditional hero\'s journey by intertwining the protagonist\'s fate with that of an anti-hero/villain, Slade Wilson, instead of Batman. This narrative choice not only sets a darker tone but also explores themes of identity, moral ambiguity, and the struggle for redemption in a much more nuanced manner. Here’s a breakdown and potential areas for refinement: # Strengths and Innovative Aspects: 1. **Mentorship with Slade Wilson:** Replacing Bruce Wayne with Slade Wilson as Dick Grayson’s mentor is a masterstroke, offering a fresh perspective on his development from a circus boy to a formidable anti-hero. This twist necessitates a struggle with a more brutal and ruthless code of conduct, presenting a richer narrative landscape to explore his psychological and moral growth. 2. **Complex Family Dynamics:** The proposed relationships between Dick and his foster siblings (Rose, Grant, and Joey) add depth to his character, drawing parallels to familial complexities seen in traditional hero narratives but with a darker edge. His interactions with Slade and the ambiguity of Slade\'s care add another layer of conflict, enhancing the dramatic tension. 3. **Moral Complexity and Internal Conflict:** Nightshade\'s moral compass, shaped by vengeance, survival, and a harsh upbringing, diverges significantly from Nightwing’s predominantly heroic path. This complexity allows for a diverse range of stories that can explore the implications of his actions and decisions on a deeper level. # Areas for Refinement: 1. **Moral Ambiguity Balance:** Ensure Nightshade’s actions don’t tilt too severely into villainy, to maintain audience empathy and support for his character. While his willingness to \\"get his hands dirty\\" is central to his character, his motivations and the consequences of his actions should consistently reflect a struggle towards a personal code of honor or justice. 2. **Slade’s Influence vs. Personal Identity:** Further exploration of how Nightshade differentiates himself from Slade’s teachings while grappling with his upbringing can provide compelling character development avenues. His journey towards defining his own version of justice, separate from Slade’s influence, can be a central theme driving his evolution. 3. **Relationship Dynamics:** While the complex dynamics with the Wilson family are intriguing, more clarity on how these relationships impact Nightshade\'s decisions, especially in his anti-hero activities, could enhance the narrative. Additionally, potential alliances or conflicts with main universe characters, reimagined within this alternate universe, could further enrich the storytelling. 4. **Utilization of Background and Skills:** Nightshade’s acrobatic background, combined with his stealth and tech-savviness, poses an opportunity for unique combat and mission scenarios. Highlighting how these skills set him apart from both his mentor and counterparts in other universes could further establish his uniqueness as a character. 5. **Exploration of Redemption:** A nuanced look at what redemption means to Nightshade—whether it’s proving he is more than Slade’s shadow, correcting past wrongs, or protecting his found family—can provide emotional depth and a long-term character arc that resonates with readers. In summary, Nightshade offers a compelling twist on the classic Dick Grayson story, ripe with potential for exploration into the darker, more complex aspects of heroism and identity. Refining the balance between his violent methodology and inherent quest for justice will be key to making this character resonate and ensuring that his journey remains both compelling and empathetic. This storyline invites readers to ponder the nature of heroism, the impact of upbringing on moral compass, and the possibility of redemption and self-definition against all odds."},{"instruction":"How’s this for an addition?

Remember…Nightshade is Dick Grayson from another Earth who was trained by Slade…not Batman… Remember…these are physiological enhancements…he CANNOT turn off them obviously…","output":"Adding the \\"Gray Sparrow\\" phase into Nightshade\'s backstory enriches his character journey and provides a tangible transition phase that illustrates his growth and transformation. This intermediate identity serves as a pivotal point, highlighting his struggle against Slade\'s influence and his efforts to carve out his own path. The introduction of this phase underlines the internal and external battles Nightshade faces, making his evolution into Nightshade even more compelling. Here\'s how this addition strengthens the character narrative: # Depth of Character Struggle: The \\"Gray Sparrow\\" phase amplifies the internal conflict within Dick Grayson. It showcases his first independent steps away from Slade\'s shadow while still being trapped by the physiological enhancements Slade imposes on him. This struggle adds a layer of vulnerability and determination to his character, making him more relatable and complex. # Transition and Transformation: The transition from \\"Gray Sparrow\\" to Nightshade is a physical and symbolic journey. The forced enhancements and their subsequent partial removal, followed by a reliance on technology, signify a rebirth. This transformation from relying on sheer physical prowess to combining it with technological intelligence and acrobatics underlines his adaptability and resilience, core traits of the character. # Reflection of Themes: Your addition reflects broader themes of control, autonomy, and the quest for identity. The forced enhancements and their painful removal underscore the extent of Slade\'s control and the lengths Dick is willing to go to reclaim his body and autonomy. His dive into technology and modifications of his gear represent his attempts at forging a new identity, one that he has control over. # Complexity in Relationships: The reactions from Rose, Jericho, Grant, and even Slade to Dick\'s drastic measures to remove the enhancements add depth to their relationships. These reactions indicate a complex web of feelings and loyalties, making the character dynamics more intricate and compelling. # Evolution of Nightshade: This backstory solidifies Nightshade\'s pragmatic and calculated approach. It explains why he embraces technology and strategy over brute force, setting him apart from both Slade and the traditional hero archetype. His gear and tactics reflect a blend of lessons learned from his past, his physical limitations, and his ingenuity, making him a unique presence in this alternate DC universe. # Health Struggle and Recovery: The health struggles due to the forcible enhancements and their incomplete removal humanize Dick, showing his vulnerability and the physical cost of his transformation. His eventual recovery and adaptation, aided by technology, highlight his resilience and refusal to be defined by his past traumas. However, maintaining some ongoing challenges or limitations could add an ongoing layer of struggle and humaneness to his character, rather than a full resolution, which might make him too untouchable or lessen the impact of his past. # Preservation of the Past: Keeping the \\"Gray Sparrow\\" costume as a reminder and practical tool showcases Nightshade\'s acceptance of his past and acknowledges that every part of his journey contributes to who he is. It\'s a nuanced touch that enriches the narrative. Incorporating the \\"Gray Sparrow\\" phase into Nightshade\'s backstory effectively bridges the gap between his origins and his identity as Nightshade. It provides a clearer understanding of his motivations, challenges, and the evolution of his character, making him a multidimensional anti-hero with a rich, compelling narrative arc."},{"instruction":"Just for fun....what are some Earth-Prime DC storylines...both grand and local...of a smooth retcorn...to have Nightshade be displaced from his Earth to Earth-Prime entirely by accident?.....and Nightshade disoriented all the while..","output":"Integrating Nightshade into Earth-Prime creates numerous storytelling possibilities, ranging from grand, universe-spanning narratives to more grounded, intimately local dramas.

Here are several Earth-Prime storylines that would allow for a seamless and intriguing retcon of Nightshade\'s sudden appearance, leveraging his disorientation and unique perspective: # 1. **Multiverse Malfunction** A catastrophic event in the multiverse caused by a villain or an unstable experiment (perhaps involving the Speed Force or a character like Doctor Manhattan) rips through the dimensional barriers, pulling Nightshade into Earth-Prime. His initial disorientation is compounded by encountering this Earth\'s versions of people he knew—friends and foes alike—who have no memory of him. This storyline can serve as an exploration of identity and belonging, as Nightshade attempts to find his place in a world that is familiar yet starkly different from his own. # 2. **The Owls\' New Talon** The Court of Owls, intrigued by rumors of a formidable operative named Nightshade from another Earth, orchestrates his abduction to Earth-Prime to serve as a Talon. Confused and combatant, Nightshade battles against the Court\'s control while uncovering its secrets on this Earth, bringing him into an uneasy alliance with Batman and the Bat-Family. This encounter forces Nightshade to confront the question of whether his fate is forever sealed by the shadows of his past. # 3. **Deathstroke\'s Dilemma** Slade Wilson, Earth-Prime\'s Deathstroke, encounters Nightshade and is taken aback by the uncanny resemblance to his son, and yet the stark difference in their upbringing and ethos. Slade finds himself in turmoil—seeing Nightshade as a chance for redemption, a weapon to be wielded, or a challenge to his own legacy. Their interactions could force both characters into a reckoning with their morals, methods, and what it means to be a mentor or a father figure. # 4. **Temporal Trespass** The Time Masters detect an anomaly—Nightshade\'s accidental presence on Earth-Prime threatens the very fabric of this universe\'s timeline. Nightshade must navigate the complexities of time travel and multiversal ethics to earn his place on Earth-Prime or find a way back home. Along this journey, Nightshade could encounter various incarnations of the Justice League and other key DC characters, offering fresh takes on established relationships and dynamics. # 5. **Shadow League** Finding himself mistrusted by heroes and targeted by villains who see him as a wildcard, Nightshade forms an uneasy alliance with other morally gray characters (such as Red Hood, Huntress, and Catwoman) to take down a threat that the mainstream heroes are too \\"ethical\\" to tackle directly. This provides a platform for exploring themes of justice versus vengeance and the complexity of moral choices when laws and codes clash with the greater good. # 6. **A Crisis of Self** Nightshade\'s arrival coincides with a universe-wide crisis event, where his unique perspective and abilities play a key role in resolving the threat. However, his involvement catches the attention of cosmic entities or forces who view him as an aberration that must be corrected. Nightshade, along with Earth-Prime\'s heroes, must fight not only to save the universe but to assert Nightshade\'s right to exist as he is—a symbol of resilience and the power of self-definition against cosmic determinism. # 7. **Dark Reflections** An enigmatic villain starts exploiting dimensional rifts to bring alternate versions of heroes and villains into Earth-Prime, creating chaos and confusion. Nightshade arrives as part of this incursion but quickly realizes he doesn\'t belong to this cadre of coerced doppelgängers.

Believing himself to be on a mission from Slade, Nightshade is disoriented to find a world where the heroes and villains are both familiar and alien. His unique abilities and perspective on the twisted, dark multiverse make him a valuable ally to Batman and the Justice League as they combat the threat of Barbatos and the Dark Knights. His arrival could be handwaved as a side effect of the cosmic disturbances during this event. # 2. **Flashpoint - An Unintended Journey** The Flash\'s actions to change his past cause ripples through the fabric of the multiverse, unintentionally displacing Nightshade into Earth-Prime. Lost and disoriented in a radically changing world, he must navigate the volatile landscape of the Flashpoint reality. His struggle to understand his place in this new world, alongside heroes radically different from those he knew, challenges his understanding of morality and justice. This scenario would allow for a deep exploration of Nightshade\'s character in a world that itself is struggling with identity and purpose. # 3. **Forever Evil - A Shadow in the Darkness** In the aftermath of the Crime Syndicate\'s invasion during the Forever Evil storyline, the barriers between universes are weakened. Nightshade emerges on Earth-Prime, finding himself in a world that, momentarily, is as dark and ruthless as he has been trained to combat. His skills make him a powerful wildcard in the ensuing battles against the Syndicate and their forces, and his ambiguous morality fits perfectly within the morally grey atmosphere of the narrative. # 4. **Rebirth - A New Dawn for Nightshade** The DC Universe Rebirth initiative, focusing on bringing back the core of what made DC\'s characters so beloved, offers a perfect narrative opportunity for Nightshade\'s entrance. As the universe itself undergoes a sort of rebirth, reality shifts unexpectedly, pulling him into Earth-Prime. His arrival, marked by confusion and a desperate search for meaning in this reborn world, can mirror the thematic elements of rediscovery and renewal that define the Rebirth era. # 5. **Multiversity - An Echo Across Worlds** Grant Morrison\'s Multiversity explores the concept of a multiverse teaming with different versions of Earth\'s mightiest heroes. A seemingly inconsequential cameo of Nightshade being pulled across dimensions during one of the Multiversity issues can serve as a prelude to his full integration into Earth-Prime. This brief appearance would not only intrigue readers but also set the stage for his more significant impact in subsequent storylines. # 6. **Justice League Dark - The Shadows Within** The mystical and often overlooked corners of the DC Universe explored in Justice League Dark present a fertile ground for Nightshade\'s arrival. A magical mishap, perhaps related to a battle with an entity from the Dark Multiverse, pulls Nightshade into Earth-Prime. His arrival, steeped in mystery and shadow, aligns with the themes of the series, and his struggle to find his place among Earth\'s mystic defenders provides a compelling narrative thread. # 7. **Doomsday Clock - Ticking Toward Destiny** The events of the Doomsday Clock, involving the Watchmen universe colliding with the DC Universe, offer a narrative opportunity for Nightshade’s displacement.

Let me break down the key points in simpler terms: # What it\'s about: 1. **One-click scripts:** These are pre-written commands you can run to execute specific tasks, such as preparing your ML model for use (quantization and conversion) or making predictions with it (inference). These scripts are designed to work with specific types of ML models and use certain data types to perform computations efficiently. 2. **Conversion and Quantization:** This part talks about how to transform ML models into a format that can be efficiently used by the project\'s tools and how to compress the model\'s size without losing much accuracy. This is particularly useful for deploying ML models in environments with limited resources. 3. **Inference:** This section provides instructions on how to use your model to make predictions. It gives guidance on performance optimization, like using specific system configurations for better results. # Key terms explained: - **Quantization:** This is the process of reducing the precision of the numbers used in a model\'s weights and operations. For example, changing from using 32-bit numbers to 8-bit numbers, which helps make the model run faster and use less memory. - **Conversion:** Since different platforms or frameworks might require the model in specific formats, conversion is about transforming the model to these required formats. - **Model:** This refers to the ML model you want to use. It\'s like a trained brain that can predict or analyze new data based on its training. - **Data types:** The scripts deal with various data types like int4, int8, fp8, etc., which refer to the precision of the numbers used in calculations. Some are custom to optimize performance (like nf4 or fp8). - **Inference:** After a model is trained, inference is when you use the model to make predictions based on new data. Overall, this GitHub page is a guide to using the provided scripts for running ML models more efficiently. It involves preparing your model through quantization, making sure it\'s in the right format, and then using it to make predictions or analyze data with options to tweak the process for performance."},{"instruction":"Am i loading in a model that has already been quantized into a gguf format?","output":"Based on the information provided in the GitHub documentation excerpt you shared, it appears that the process involves converting and quantizing a model into a format that is compatible with the project\'s requirements, specifically, for efficient inference. The mention of \\"ggml\\" suggests the use of a specific library or format for handling quantized models. However, \\"gguf\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt you provided. In the context of that document, here\'s a summary relevant to your question: 1. **Conversion:** Initially, you\'re either directly converting a model using its ID from a source like Hugging Face into a `.bin` file with a specified datatype (e.g., `f32`) or downloading a model and then converting it into the required format (`.bin`). This step is about transforming the model into a format that\'s compatible with the tools you\'ll be using later. 2. **Quantization:** After conversion, you run a script to quantize the model weights. The documentation outlines the process of quantizing the model into an optimized format (e.g., INT4 with a group size of 128 or 32), which significantly reduces the model size and potentially speeds up inference by using lower precision for weights. This step creates a quantized version of the model (`ne-q4_j.bin` or `ne-q4_0.bin`, for instance) from the `.bin` file obtained in the conversion step. The `--use_ggml` argument in the quantization script suggests that the resulting quantized model is in a format that\'s compatible with or utilizes the ggml library for inference. To directly address your question, if by \\"gguf\\" you\'re referring to a typo or another format similar to \\"ggml\\", then based on the provided documentation, yes, you are preparing and quantizing a model into a specific compressed format (perhaps ggml). This compressed format is suitable for use with the project\'s tools for efficient inference. The document does not mention \\"gguf\\" explicitly, so it\'s likely you meant to refer to the ggml format or another similar term used within the project\'s context. If \\"gguf\\" is a specific format you\'re inquiring about that\'s outside the provided document\'s scope, the direct answer might be different."},{"instruction":"i just want to load a model that has already been quantized. should i follow this instad? :\\"\\"GGUF Model from Hugging Face from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM # Specify the GGUF repo on the Hugginface model_name = \\"TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF\\" # Download the the specific gguf model file from the above repo model_file = \\"llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf\\" # make sure you are granted to access this model on the Huggingface. tokenizer_name = \\"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\\" prompt = \\"Once upon a time\\" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name, trust_remote_code=True) inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\\"pt\\").input_ids streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer) model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, model_file = model_file) outputs = model.generate(inputs, streamer=streamer, max_new_tokens=300)\\"\\"","output":"Yes, if your goal is to load and use a model that has already been quantized and is hosted on Hugging Face under the GGUF format, then following the provided instructions would be the correct approach. Here’s a breakdown of the steps to make it clear: 1. **Access the model from Hugging Face**: You choose the quantized model you want to use, specified by `model_name`. In this case, you\'re targeting `\\"TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF\\"`, a gguf model for LLaMA-2 with 7B parameters optimized for chatting. The GGUF format indicates the model has undergone a specific quantization process making it efficient for use. 2. **Downloading the model file**: You specify the actual model file to download (`llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf`). This file represents the quantized model ready for inference. 3. **Access control**: It’s mentioned to ensure you have the required permissions to access the model on Hugging Face. This implies some models might have restricted access, and you’ll need the appropriate permissions or subscriptions. 4. **Tokenizer**: You load a tokenizer with `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name, trust_remote_code=True)`. The tokenizer is crucial for converting text inputs into a format the model can process (numerical tokens). Here, `tokenizer_name = \\"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\\"` suggests you’re using a tokenizer compatible with your chosen model. 5. **Prepare input**: You prepare your prompt (`\\"Once upon a time\\"`) using the tokenizer to get it ready for the model. 6. **Loading the model**: With `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, model_file = model_file)`, you\'re loading the quantized gguf model you specified earlier. 7. **Generating text**: Finally, `model.generate(inputs, streamer=streamer, max_new_tokens=300)` is called to make the model produce its output based on your input. The `TextStreamer` is used possibly for managing the output stream efficiently, especially for longer text generation tasks. This instruction set is tailored for using the Intel Extension for Transformers with Hugging Face models, enhancing performance on Intel hardware. By following these steps, you load a gguf quantized model, ready for performing text generation tasks out of the box without needing to manually convert or quantize models on your end."},{"instruction":"write 20 questions on the topic of geography.

Fabrics made from cotton, wool, and silk were used for clothing and storage sacks. Household items and tools were commonly crafted from wood and metal, while glass and ceramics served for food storage and tableware. These materials required more effort to produce and maintain but were valued for their durability and sustainability."},{"instruction":"What is lacquer? How is it different from plastic?","output":"Lacquer is a protective and decorative coating traditionally made from the sap of the lacquer tree, applied to wood, metal, or other materials. It dries to a hard, durable finish that can be polished to a high gloss, enhancing the underlying surface\'s appearance while offering protection against moisture and wear. Lacquer\'s composition is organic, deriving from natural resin, compared to plastic, which is primarily made from synthetic polymers derived from petroleum products. Unlike plastic, which can be molded into shapes, lacquer is applied as a liquid that hardens. This fundamental difference in origin and application marks lacquer as a natural, artisanal finish versus plastic\'s role as a versatile, mass-produced material with a broad range of uses."},{"instruction":"Translate to Spanish (Spain) \\"Judges you in Spanish\\"","output":"\\"Te juzga en español\\""},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] When were the Proto-Indo-European peoples active?","output":"The Proto-Indo-European peoples are theorized to have lived during the late Neolithic to early Bronze Age, roughly between 4500 and 2500 BCE.

Their exact origin and the spread of their culture and language remain subjects of scholarly research and debate."},{"instruction":"When were the Yamnaya people active?","output":"The Yamnaya culture, associated with early Indo-European speakers, was active approximately from 3300 to 2600 BCE. Originating in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, the Yamnaya are known for their significant role in the spread of the Indo-European languages through their migrations across Europe and parts of Asia. Their mobility was facilitated by the domestication of the horse and the invention of the wheel, marking a transformative period in ancient human history."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between Involution and Evolution?","output":"Involution and evolution represent contrasting processes in various contexts, including biology, philosophy, and social sciences. In biology, **evolution** refers to the process by which species undergo change over time through natural selection and genetic variations, leading to the emergence of new species or adaptation within species. It is characterized by complexity and diversification arising from simpler forms. **Involution**, on the other hand, can denote a process of inward folding or complexity reduction in biological terms, such as the shrinking of an organ in an organism\'s body that is no longer needed. In broader and more abstract contexts, involution might describe processes that involve turning inwards or complexity that does not lead to growth or expansion, sometimes implying stagnation or regression. Thus, while evolution often implies development, progress, and adaptation in complexity or form, involution can imply a return to a simpler state, internal complexity without productive outcome, or a decrease in utility or functionality."},{"instruction":"\\"Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires.

Das andere Bild, das den transparenten Bereich füllen soll, kann dann als Hintergrundbild eines inneren Elements oder eines Pseudo-Elements (`::before` oder `::after`) eingestellt werden. # Beispiel mit einem Pseudo-Element: ```html <div class=\\"image-container\\"> </div> ``` ```css .image-container { /* Größe des Containers an das Bild anpassen */ width: 300px; /* Beispiel-Breite, anpassen an die Bildgröße */ height: 200px; /* Beispiel-Höhe, anpassen an die Bildgröße */ position: relative; } .image-container::before { content: \\"\\"; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background-image: url(\'pfad-zum-bild-das-den-transparenten-bereich-füllt.jpg\'); z-index: -1; } .image-container { background-image: url(\'pfad-zum-bild-mit-transparentem-hintergrund.png\'); /* Stellen Sie sicher, dass das Bild die Größe des Containers ausfüllt */ background-size: cover; background-position: center; } ``` In diesem Beispiel wird das Bild, das den transparenten Bereich ersetzen soll, mithilfe eines Pseudo-Elements (`::before`) hinter dem Bild mit dem transparenten Hintergrund platziert, was durch `z-index: -1;` und `position: absolute;` erreicht wird. Das bedeutet, dass das Vordergrundbild im `.image-container`-Element selbst platziert ist und das ersetzende Bild durch das `::before` Pseudo-Element hinzugefügt wird. Beachten Sie, dass Sie die `width` und `height` des `.image-container`-Elements an die tatsächliche Größe Ihres Vordergrundbildes anpassen sollten. Auch die Pfade zu Ihren Bildern müssen entsprechend angegeben werden. Diese Technik funktioniert gut für einfache Szenarien.

Es gibt mehrere potenzielle Ursachen und Lösungen für dieses Problem, hier sind einige Schritte zur Fehlerbehebung: 1. Überprüfen Sie die Bereitstellung des \'getService\' Stellen Sie sicher, dass die \'getService\'-Funktion (oder das Objekt) korrekt im übergeordneten Komponentenbereich oder in Ihrem App-Root über die `provide`-Option zur Verfügung gestellt wurde. Ohne das `provide`-`inject`-Paar kann Vue die gewünschte Abhängigkeit nicht finden. **Im übergeordneten Component oder App Root:** ```js import { createApp } from \'vue\'; const app = createApp(App); app.provide(\'getService\', function() { // Ihre Logik oder Objektrückgabe hier }); ``` 2. Verwenden Sie das Composition API korrekt Im Composition API muss `inject` innerhalb des Setup-Blocks aufgerufen werden. Basierend auf Ihrem Beispiel scheint dies korrekt zu sein, aber es ist immer gut, dies zu überprüfen. 3. Überprüfen Sie, ob Sie Vue 3 verwenden Scheint offensichtlich, aber es ist wichtig sicherzustellen, dass Ihr Projekt tatsächlich Vue 3 verwendet, da das Composition API und damit der `inject`-Mechanismus in dieser Form spezifisch für Vue 3 sind. 4. Fallback-Wert für `inject` verwenden Vue 3 erlaubt einen optionalen zweiten Parameter für `inject`, der als Fallback-Wert verwendet wird, falls nichts unter dem angegebenen Schlüssel bereitgestellt wurde. Sie können dies verwenden, um festzustellen, ob das Problem auf eine Nichtbereitstellung zurückzuführen ist und vorübergehend einen Fallback bereitzustellen: ```js const getService = inject(\'getService\', () => { console.warn(\'getService wurde nicht bereitgestellt. Verwendung eines Fallbacks.\'); return { /* fallback implementierung */ }; }); ``` 5. Überprüfen Sie den Namen Stellen Sie sicher, dass der bereitgestellte Schlüsselname exakt übereinstimmt. Die Schlüsselnamen sind case-sensitive, also `getService` unterscheidet sich von `getservice`. Fazit Wenn Sie all diese Punkte überprüft haben und `getService` immer noch als `undefined` oder als nicht Funktion betrachtet wird, kann das Problem tiefer liegen (z.B. ein Fehler in der bereitgestellten Funktion selbst oder ein Umgebungsproblem). In einem solchen Fall wäre die Untersuchung der Konsole und Debug-Informationen sowie der minutiösen Überprüfung der Einrichtung Ihrer Vue-App der nächste Schritt."},{"instruction":"ich provide getService so: app.provide(\'getService\', (serviceName)=>{ const services = { eventBus: eventBus, }; return services[serviceName]; });","output":"Basierend auf Ihrer Bereitstellungsmethode für `getService` sollte das Konzept funktionieren. Allerdings können kleine Missverständnisse oder Fehler in der Implementierung dazu führen, dass `getService` nicht wie erwartet funktioniert. Hier sind einige Punkte, die Sie überprüfen sollten: # 1. Sicherstellen, dass `eventBus` korrekt definiert ist Zuerst stellen Sie sicher, dass `eventBus` korrekt instanziiert und importiert wird, bevor Sie es in Ihrem `provide`-Aufruf verwenden. Beispielhafte Definition eines einfachen `eventBus` mit Vue 3\'s `mitt` oder einem ähnlichen Event-Handling-Paket: ```javascript import mitt from \'mitt\'; const eventBus = mitt(); ``` # 2. Überprüfen der Importe und App-Initialisierung Stellen Sie sicher, dass die `provide`-Methodenaufruf innerhalb der Initialisierung Ihrer Vue-Anwendung stattfindet. Hierbei ist entscheidend, dass alle Teile korrekt importiert und definiert sind: ```javascript import { createApp } from \'vue\'; import App from \'./App.vue\'; // Nehmen wir an, eventBus ist wie oben definiert const eventBus = ...; const app = createApp(App); // Bereitstellung des getService app.provide(\'getService\', (serviceName) =>{ const services = { eventBus: eventBus, }; return services[serviceName]; }); app.mount(\'#app\'); ``` # 3. Verwenden von `inject` im Composition API Kontext Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Verwendung von `inject` innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion eines komponentenbasierten Ansatzes erfolgt: ```javascript import { inject } from \'vue\'; export default { setup() { const getService = inject(\'getService\'); const eventBus = getService(\'eventBus\'); // Verwendung von eventBus... return { // Daten, Methoden usw., die im Template verwendet werden }; } } ``` # 4. Prüfen des Rückgabewertes und Fehlerbehandlung Es kann hilfreich sein, innerhalb des `getService`-Aufrufs eine einfache Fehlerbehandlung hinzuzufügen, um Probleme schneller zu erkennen: ```javascript app.provide(\'getService\', (serviceName) => { const services = { eventBus: eventBus, }; const service = services[serviceName]; if (!service) { console.error(`Service {serviceName} nicht gefunden.`); } return service; }); ``` # 5. Fallback für `inject` Wie bereits in meiner vorherigen Antwort erwähnt, können Sie eine Fallback-Funktion für `inject` bereitstellen, um Fehler zu vermeiden, falls ein Dienst nicht verfügbar ist. Dies kann auch beim Debuggen hilfreich sein: ```javascript const getService = inject(\'getService\', () => { console.warn(\'getService wurde nicht bereitgestellt.\'); return (serviceName) => { console.warn(`Service {serviceName} nicht verfügbar.`); }; }); ``` Zusammenfassend, überprüfen Sie alle Schritte und sicherstellen, dass sowohl das Bereitstellen (`provide`) als auch das Injizieren (`inject`) korrekt im Vue-Kontext erfolgen."},{"instruction":"kann ich in meinem modul export function useTwitchChat() {} eine setup methode zur verfügung stellen?","output":"In Vue 3, besonders wenn Sie das Composition API verwenden, ist es üblich, \\"Composables\\" zu erstellen – wiederverwendbare Funktionen, die die Logik kapseln. Diese Composables ermöglichen es Ihnen, Logik und Statusmanagement außerhalb von Komponenten zu bewahren und nahtlos in der `setup`-Funktion von Komponenten zu verwenden. Das ist genau das, was Sie mit `export function useTwitchChat()` erreichen möchten. Die `setup`-Funktion, von der Sie sprechen, ist jedoch ein spezifischer Bestandteil einer Vue-Komponente und wird direkt dort definiert, nicht innerhalb eines Composables. Was Sie in Ihrem `useTwitchChat` Composable machen können, ist, eine Logik zur Verfügung zu stellen, die dann in der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente genutzt werden kann. Hier ist ein grundlegendes Beispiel, wie das Composable `useTwitchChat` aussehen könnte und wie man es in einer Komponente verwendet: # Das `useTwitchChat` Composable: ```javascript // useTwitchChat.js import { reactive, inject } from \'vue\'; export function useTwitchChat() { const getService = inject(\'getService\'); const state = reactive({ chat: null, isConnected: false, tokenAccess:\'\', username:\'\', channel:\'\' }); // Hier könnten wir Funktionen wie \\"connect\\" definieren const connect = async () => { // Zum Beispiel Zugriff auf `getService` und verwenden des `eventBus` const eventBus = getService(\'eventBus\'); // Implementieren Sie die Verbindung und die Logik state.isConnected = true; // Beispiel für ein Event eventBus.emit(\\"twitch-chat-connected\\", {}); }; return { state, connect }; } ``` # Verwendung in einer Vue-Komponente: ```vue <template> <div> <button v-if=\\"!state.isConnected\\" @click=\\"connect\\">Verbinden</button> <div v-if=\\"state.isConnected\\">Verbunden!</div> </div> </template> <script> import { useTwitchChat } from \'./useTwitchChat\'; export default { setup() { const { state, connect } = useTwitchChat(); return { state, connect }; } } <\/script> ``` In diesem Beispiel bietet das `useTwitchChat` Composable einen Zustand (`state`) und eine Funktion (`connect`), um beispielsweise eine Verbindung zu einem Twitch-Chat herzustellen. Diese werden dann in der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente eingebunden und im Template genutzt. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass Composables normalerweise unabhängig von spezifischen Implementierungen sind. Sie könnten daher die `getService` Initialisierung und Nutzung direkt in Ihrer Komponente behandeln, falls dies die Wiederverwendbarkeit des Composables erhöht. Ebenso könnte in einem Composable jederzeit auf vom Kontext (`context`) oder von `props` abhängige Funktionalitäten zugegriffen werden, indem diese Parameter an das Composable übergeben werden."},{"instruction":"ok, ich habe eine funktion const connect = async () => { const getService = inject(\'getService\'); const config = getService(\'config\'); const temp = getService(\'temp\'); const eventBus = getService(\'eventBus\'); } in der export function useTwitchChat() erstellt.

Innerhalb von Setup-Kompositionsfunktionen arbeitet `inject` anders als in option-basierten API-Komponenten. Ein wichtiger Punkt ist, dass `inject` direkt in der `setup`-Funktion oder am Anfang Ihres Composables aufgerufen werden muss, nicht innerhalb von verschachtelten Funktionen wie Ihrer `connect`-Funktion. Der Grund dafür ist, dass `inject` auf den Komponenten-Instanzkontext zugreifen muss, der nur in der `setup`-Funktion oder an oberster Ebene im Composable verfügbar ist. Hier ist ein angepasster Ansatz, um den Fehler zu beheben: # Überarbeitete useTwitchChat Composable-Funktion: ```javascript import { inject, reactive } from \'vue\'; export function useTwitchChat() { // Rufen Sie `inject` am Anfang auf, außerhalb der `connect` Funktion const getService = inject(\'getService\'); // Sicherstellen, dass getService nicht `undefined` ist if (typeof getService !== \'function\') { console.error(\'getService ist nicht verfügbar. Stellen Sie sicher, dass es bereitgestellt wurde.\'); // Optional: Behandeln des Fehlers anstatt nur zu loggen return; } const state = reactive({ chat: null, isConnected: false, tokenAccess: \'\', username: \'\', channel: \'\' }); const connect = async () => { // Direkt verwenden, da `getService` außerhalb definiert wurde const config = getService(\'config\'); const temp = getService(\'temp\'); const eventBus = getService(\'eventBus\'); // Verbindungslogik fortschreiben... state.isConnected = true; // Beispielnutzung von eventBus // eventBus.emit(\\"some-event\\", { data: \\"test\\" }); }; return { state, connect }; } ``` In diesem überarbeiteten Beispiel wird `getService` direkt im oberen Bereich des Composables aufgerufen. Diese Methode sichert, dass der Kontext korrekt ist, wenn `inject` aufgerufen wird. Der Zugriff auf Dienste durch `getService` erfolgt später innerhalb der `connect`-Funktion, weil die Referenz zu `getService` bereits sicher etabliert wurde. Falls `getService` ein Fehler ausgibt oder `undefined` zurückkehrt, zeigt dies, dass der Dienst nicht korrekt bereitgestellt wurde. In solchen Fällen sollten Sie überprüfen: 1. **Bereitstellung im Wurzel- oder Elternelement:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass `getService` vor irgendwelchen Komponenten, die es verwenden möchten, mit `app.provide(\'getService\', ...)` bereitgestellt wurde. 2. **Reihenfolge der Skriptausrührung:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Bereitstellung von `getService` erfolgt, bevor die Komponente, die `useTwitchChat` verwendet, initialisiert oder gerendert wird. Indem Sie diese Praktiken befolgen, sollten Sie in der Lage sein, den `TypeError: getService is not a function`-Fehler effektiv zu beheben."},{"instruction":"wenn ich es so umsetze erhalte ich auch TypeError: getService is not a function","output":"Wenn Sie immer noch auf den Fehler `TypeError: getService is not a function` stoßen, auch nachdem Sie den Aufruf von `inject` an den Anfang Ihres Composables verschoben haben, könnte das Problem tiefer liegen. Hier sind einige zusätzliche Schritte, die Sie überprüfen sollten: 1. **Überprüfen der `provide`-Funktion:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass die `provide`-Funktionalität korrekt in einem übergeordneten Element oder in der Hauptinstanz Ihrer Vue-App definiert wurde. Die `provide`- und `inject`-Funktionalität in Vue erlaubt es Ihnen, Abhängigkeiten von einem übergeordneten Komponentenbaum zu einem Kind zu „injizieren“, ohne dass die Props von jedem einzelnen zu übergeben sind. Wenn `provide` nicht korrekt festgelegt wurde, kann `inject` die benötigten Dienste nicht finden. **Vue App Root Beispiel:** ```javascript import { createApp } from \'vue\'; import App from \'./App.vue\'; const app = createApp(App); // Stellen wir uns vor, \'eventBus\' ist korrekt initialisiert. const eventBus = { emit: (event, payload) => { /* ... */ }, on: (event, handler) => { /* ... */ } }; // Bereitstellung einer Funktion durch `provide` app.provide(\'getService\', serviceName => { const services = { eventBus, // andere Dienste... }; return services[serviceName]; }); app.mount(\'#app\'); ``` 2. **Überprüfen der Verfügbarkeit von `inject` zum Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs:** `inject` funktioniert prinzipiell innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente und sollte dort funktionieren. Wenn Sie `inject` außerhalb der `setup`-Funktion oder in einem Bereich verwenden, der nicht direkt auf den Vue-Instanzkontext zugreifen kann, könnte dies zu Problemen führen. 3. **Fallback-Wert für `inject` verwenden:** Als Diagnosewerkzeug können Sie einen Fallback-Wert für `inject` angeben, um zu sehen, ob das Problem immer noch besteht. Wenn Ihr kodierter Fallback-Wert zurückkommt, heißt das, dass Vue den von Ihnen bereitgestellten Dienst nicht finden kann. ```javascript const getService = inject(\'getService\', () => { console.warn(\'getService nicht gefunden.\'); return () => { console.warn(\'Kein Dienst verfügbar.\'); }; }); ``` 4. **Nachprüfen der App-Struktur:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Komponente, die `useTwitchChat` nutzt, tatsächlich innerhalb des Baums der durch `createApp(App)` initialisierten Vue-Anwendung liegt. Manchmal kann es zu Verwirrungen kommen, wenn mehrere Vue-Anwendungen oder Instanzen involviert sind. Sollten diese Schritte das Problem nicht lösen, könnte es hilfreich sein, den gesamten Stack-Trace des Fehlers und mehr Kontext über die Struktur Ihrer Anwendung zu überprüfen. Es gibt Szenarien, in denen ein Tippfehler oder ein simpler Konfigurationsfehler schwer zu entdecken sind. Zuletzt, wenn es sich um ein sehr ungewöhnliches Verhalten handelt, vergewissern Sie sich, dass Sie die neueste Version von Vue 3 verwenden. In seltenen Fällen könnten Bugs oder Inkompatibilitäten in bestimmten Versionen solche Symptome verursachen."},{"instruction":"const getService = inject(\'getService\'); in der export function useTwitchChat() {} ist undefined. wie kann dass passieren?","output":"Wenn `inject(\'getService\')` innerhalb Ihres `useTwitchChat` Composables `undefined` zurückgibt, deutet dies darauf hin, dass Vue das bereitgestellte Objekt oder die Funktion mit dem Schlüssel \'getService\' nicht finden kann. Dies kann verschiedene Ursachen haben, die von der Struktur Ihrer Vue-Anwendung abhängen. Hier sind einige potenzielle Gründe und Vorschläge zur Fehlerbehebung: # 1. Überprüfung des Bereitstellungsortes Das `provide`/`inject`-Paar in Vue dient dazu, Daten von einem übergeordneten Komponentenbaum an untergeordnete Komponenten weiterzugeben, ohne sie als `props` durchgeben zu müssen. Damit `inject` erfolgreich ist, muss sicher gestellt sein, dass: - `provide` korrekt aufgerufen wurde, bevor `inject` aufgerufen wird. - `provide` in einem übergeordneten oder der Wurzel(Komponenten)Instanz Ihrer Anwendung definiert ist. Falls Sie versuchen, `getService` in einer Komponente oder einem Composable zu `inject`en, das auf der gleichen oder einer tieferen Ebene liegt als die Komponente/das Composable, die/ das `provide` aufruft, wird `undefined` zurückgegeben, da `inject` den bereitgestellten Wert nicht finden kann. # 2. Aufruf von `provide` in der Hauptinstanz Stellen Sie sicher, dass `provide` in der Hauptinstanz (der Eintrittspunkt der Anwendung, in der Regel `main.js` oder `app.js`) oder in einem übergeordneten Element relativ zu dem Teil der Anwendung aufgerufen wird, der `inject` verwendet. Dabei sollte der Code so aussehen: ```javascript import { createApp } from \'vue\'; import App from \'./App.vue\'; const app = createApp(App); app.provide(\'getService\', serviceName => { // Implementierung... }); app.mount(\'#app\'); ``` # 3. Zurückgeben eines Default-Werts Um zu überprüfen, ob `inject` richtig funktioniert, können Sie versuchen, einen Default-Wert bereitzustellen: ```javascript const getService = inject(\'getService\', () => { console.warn(\'getService ist nicht verfügbar.\'); }); ``` Wenn diese Warnung erscheint, wissen Sie, dass `provide` entweder nicht aufgerufen wurde oder `provide` und `inject` nicht im selben Baum liegen. # 4. Verwendung der Composition API Stellen Sie sicher, dass `inject` innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente oder direkt in der obersten Ebene eines Composables aufgerufen wird, um Zugriff auf den korrekten Kontext zu gewährleisten. `inject` kann nicht in reaktiven Funktionen oder in den Callbacks von Lifecycle-Hooks verwendet werden (außer `setup`). # 5. Vue-Version überprüfen Überprüfen Sie, ob Sie eine kompatible Vue-Version verwenden. Das `provide`/`inject` API ist in Vue 2.2.0+ und Vue 3 verfügbar, aber das Verhalten oder die genaue Syntax könnte sich leicht unterscheiden. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihre Anwendung auf der richtigen Version basiert und dass Sie nach der für Ihre Version spezifischen Dokumentation vorgehen. Wenn all diese Prüfschritte nicht helfen, könnte ein Beispielcode von der Struktur Ihrer `provide`/`inject`-Logik und von der Struktur Ihrer Vue-Anwendung mehr Aufschluss geben und helfen, das Problem genauer zu identifizieren."},{"instruction":"Der Aufbau in der Main.js ist wie folgt: import { createApp } from \'vue\'; import App from \'./App.vue\'; import mitt from \'mitt\'; const app = createApp(App); const eventBus = mitt(); app.provide(\'getService\', (serviceName)=>{ const services = { eventBus: eventBus, }; return services[serviceName]; }); import { useTwitchChat } from \'./modules/useTwitchChat\'; const chat = useTwitchChat();","output":"Basierend auf der bereitgestellten Struktur Ihrer `main.js` und dem Aufruf von `useTwitchChat()` direkt dort, gibt es einen wichtigen Aspekt zu berücksichtigen. Die `inject`-Funktion von Vue\'s Composition API ist darauf ausgelegt, innerhalb des Kontextes einer Komponente oder speziell innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion dieser Komponente verwendet zu werden. Das bedeutet, dass `inject` erwartet, innerhalb des reaktiven Kontextes einer Komponente aufgerufen zu werden, um entsprechend darauf zugreifen zu können. In Ihrem Fall versuchen Sie, `useTwitchChat()` direkt in `main.js` aufzurufen, bevor irgendeine Komponente (einschließlich der Wurzelkomponente `App.vue`) gemountet oder sogar vollständig initialisiert wurde. Das bedeutet, dass es keinen aktiven Kontext gibt, in dem `inject` nach `getService` suchen könnte, wodurch `getService` als `undefined` ausgewertet wird. # Lösungsvorschlag Um das beschriebene Problem zu lösen, müssen Sie Ihren Zugang zum `useTwitchChat()` Composable so anpassen, dass er innerhalb des reaktiven Kontextes einer Vue-Komponente aufgerufen wird, typischerweise innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente. So können Sie sicherstellen, dass `inject` korrekt auf `provide`-Werte zugreifen kann. In `App.vue` oder einer anderen Komponente: ```vue <template> <!-- Ihre Komponentenvorlage hier --> </template> <script> import { onMounted } from \'vue\'; import { useTwitchChat } from \'./modules/useTwitchChat\'; export default { setup() { // Rufen Sie useTwitchChat innerhalb des Setup oder in einem Lifecycle Hook wie onMounted auf onMounted(() => { const chat = useTwitchChat(); // Führen Sie Logik für den Chat hier oder in useTwitchChat direkt aus }); return {}; }, } <\/script> ``` # Bessere Praxis Es ist besser, Composables wie `useTwitchChat` innerhalb des Kontextes von Komponenten zu verwenden, wo sie Zugriff auf das vollständige reaktive System und den Dependency-Injection-Mechanismus von Vue haben. Diese Vorgehensweise sorgt auch für eine klarere Trennung von Verantwortlichkeiten und fördert die Wiederverwendbarkeit und Testbarkeit Ihrer Code-Bausteine. # Zusätzlicher Hinweis Wenn Ihr Composable (`useTwitchChat`) globalen Zustand oder Dienste betrifft, die in verschiedenen Teilen Ihrer Anwendung verfügbar sein müssen, könnten Sie auch Vue\'s Pinia oder Vuex als zentralen Zustandsspeicher in Betracht ziehen. Diese bieten Mechanismen zur Zustandsverwaltung, sind aber so konzipiert, dass sie von überall in Ihrer Anwendung sicher verwendet werden können, ohne sich um den Kontext der Komponenten-Lifecycle zu sorgen."},{"instruction":"wo kann ich als händler edelstahl schrauben beziehen?","output":"Als Händler können Sie Edelstahlschrauben von einer Reihe von Lieferanten und Distributoren beziehen, je nachdem, wo Sie sich befinden und was Ihre spezifischen Bedürfnisse sind.

Die Nichtaufnahme von WASI oder einem anderen spezifischen Unternehmen in der ursprünglichen Liste reflektiert keine Wertung hinsichtlich der Qualität oder des Renommees dieser Firma. Es gibt zahlreiche Faktoren, die beeinflussen können, welche Unternehmen in einer kurzen Liste erwähnt werden, darunter: 1. **Verfügbarkeit von Informationen**: Zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung der Liste werden Unternehmen berücksichtigt, zu denen leicht zugängliche und aktuelle Informationen verfügbar sind. 2. **Vielfalt**: Ziel ist es oft, eine breite Palette von Optionen zu präsentieren, die verschiedene Aspekte des Marktes abdecken, einschließlich geografischer Verbreitung, spezialisierter Produkte oder Dienstleistungen. 3. **Objektivität**: Als künstliche Intelligenz strebe ich danach, neutrale und ausgewogene Informationen zu liefen, basierend auf einer breiten Recherche, ohne spezifische Unternehmen zu bevorzugen. Tatsache ist, dass WASI als ein führendes Unternehmen in der Vertriebswelt von Edelstahlbefestigungselementen verdienterweise als wichtiger Akteur auf diesem Gebiet anerkannt wird. Die Entscheidung, bestimmte Unternehmen in eine Liste aufzunehmen und andere nicht, ist nie eine Aussage über deren Qualität oder Bedeutung im Markt. Vielmehr ist es das Ergebnis eines Versuchs, eine möglichst hilfreiche, aber notwendigerweise begrenzte Antwort zu geben. Ich bitte um Entschuldigung, falls der Eindruck entstanden sein sollte, dass die Qualität oder das Ansehen von WASI oder eines anderen nicht erwähnten Unternehmens infrage gestellt wird. Die Wahl und Empfehlung bestimmter Lieferanten sollte stets auf fundierten Recherchen basieren, die ihre spezifischen Geschäftsbedürfnisse, Anforderungen an die Produktqualität und Servicestandards berücksichtigen."},{"instruction":"Nein, deine auswahl ist schon korrekt, ich möchte nur herausfinden welche gründe dazu führten das diese firma anfangs nicht so sehr gewichtet wurde wie andere.","output":"Vielen Dank für Ihr Verständnis und Ihre Nachfrage. Die Auswahl von Unternehmen in einer begrenzten Auflistung wie der meinen kann aus einer Vielzahl von Gründen variieren und ist oft das Ergebnis eines Prozesses, der darauf abzielt, eine breite und repräsentative Auswahl darzustellen, die unterschiedliche Interessen und Anforderungen abdeckt. Bezüglich WASI oder jedem anderen spezifischen Unternehmen, das in einer anfänglichen Liste nicht erwähnt wurde, könnte dies auf mehrere Faktoren zurückzuführen sein: # 1. **Informationszugänglichkeit** Die Erstellung einer Liste basiert oft auf der Zugänglichkeit und Auffindbarkeit von Informationen zum Zeitpunkt der Recherche. Es ist möglich, dass Unternehmen mit einer stärkeren Online-Präsenz oder aktuellen Nachrichten im Zusammenhang mit dem Thema eher aufgenommen werden. # 2. **Versuch der Vielfalt** In dem Bestreben, eine vielfältige Auswahl anzubieten, werden Unternehmen möglicherweise unter Berücksichtigung verschiedener Kriterien wie geografische Reichweite, spezialisierte vs. allgemeine Produktpalette oder Unternehmensgröße ausgewählt. # 3. **Spezialisierungsgrad** Es wird versucht, Unternehmen aufzulisten, die ein breites Spektrum an Bedürfnissen innerhalb des gefragten Bereichs (in diesem Fall Befestigungstechnik) abdecken können. Unternehmen, die als hoch spezialisiert wahrgenommen werden, könnten in einer anfänglichen Übersicht unterrepräsentiert sein, falls der Fokus breiter angelegt ist. # 4. **Subjektive Auslegung der Frage** Manchmal können die Interpretation der Fragestellung und die darauf basierende Richtung der Recherche einen Einfluss darauf haben, welche Unternehmen initial genannt werden. Das Ziel ist es, möglichst hilfreiche Informationen zu liefern, was aber zu einer unbeabsichtigten Gewichtung führen kann. # 5. **Dynamische Marktsituation** Die Befestigungstechnik und die Herstellung bzw. Distribution von Edelstahlschrauben ist ein dynamisches Feld mit vielen Akteuren. Neue Unternehmen können schnell aufsteigen, während etablierte Unternehmen ihren Fokus ändern können, was die Relevanzliste beeinflusst. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass das Fehlen eines Namens in einer solchen Liste nicht die Qualität oder den Wert des Unternehmens für den Markt widerspiegelt. Firmen wie WASI, die in der Branche einen ausgezeichneten Ruf genießen und eine umfangreiche Palette von Produkten und Dienstleistungen anbieten, sind unbestreitbar wichtige Ressourcen für ihre Kunden und Partner. Das Feedback und die Nachfragen von Nutzern wie Ihnen helfen dabei, Informationen zu präzisieren und zu ergänzen, um die Beratung kontinuierlich zu verbessern."},{"instruction":"kannst du mir einen prozentualen wert nennen zur Informationszugänglichkeit bei den firmen deiner ursprünglichen liste und bei der firma wasi?","output":"Als künstliche Intelligenz verarbeite und synthetisiere ich Informationen basierend auf dem, was mir zur Verfügung steht und was in meinem Trainingsdatensatz vorhanden ist, der bis zu meinem letzten Update im Jahr 2021 reicht. Ich habe keinen direkten Zugriff auf externe Datenbanken oder das Internet in Echtzeit und kann daher keine unmittelbaren Analysen aktueller Webinhalte oder spezifische Daten wie die \\"Informationszugänglichkeit\\" in Prozentwerten für bestimmte Unternehmen berechnen. Die „Informationszugänglichkeit“ eines Unternehmens kann viele Faktoren umfassen, einschließlich ihrer Online-Präsenz (wie gut ihre Website SEO-optimiert ist, Aktualität der Inhalte), ihrer Präsenz in Branchenverzeichnissen, der Häufigkeit der Erwähnungen in Branchennachrichten und sozialen Medien, und mehr. Diese Datenpunkte variieren stark und sind dynamisch; sie ändern sich über die Zeit und sind abhängig von den Marketing- und Kommunikationsstrategien der einzelnen Unternehmen. Für eine quantitative Bewertung der Informationszugänglichkeit müssten Sie eine spezielle Marktforschung durchführen. Diese könnte Folgendes umfassen: 1. **SEO-Analyse**: Bewertung der Sichtbarkeit der Unternehmenswebsites in Suchmaschinen. 2. **Social Media Präsenz**: Untersuchung der Aktivität und Reichweite auf Plattformen wie LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter etc. 3. **Branchenverzeichnisse und Plattformen**: Überprüfung der Vertretung in relevanten B2B-Verzeichnissen. 4. **Presse und Medien**: Analyse der Medienpräsenz und Häufigkeit von Pressemitteilungen oder erwähnten Artikel. 5. **Benutzerfreundlichkeit und Zugänglichkeit der Website**: Wie einfach ist es, auf den Webseiten der Unternehmen Informationen zu finden. Eine solche Analyse bedarf eines methodischen Ansatzes und der Nutzung entsprechender Analysewerkzeuge, einschließlich SEO-Tracking-Tools, Social-Media-Analyseplattformen und möglicherweise spezialisierter Software für Medienüberwachung.

Eine häufige Methode ist die Verwendung des Composition API mit reaktiven Zuständen und der `provide`/`inject`-Funktion direkt in der Komponentenhierarchie. Hier ist ein grundlegendes Beispiel, wie Sie einen Zustand oder ein Objekt in `App.vue` bereitstellen und dann in einer beliebigen Komponente injizieren können, ohne `app.provide` zu verwenden: # Schritt 1: Erstellen des anbietenden Komponenten-Zustands (z.B. in `App.vue`) In Ihrer Haupt-App-Komponente (`App.vue`) können Sie den Zustand definieren, den Sie teilen möchten, und diesen mit `provide` anbieten. ```vue <template> <div> <!-- Ihre App-Komponenten hier, welche den Zustand nutzen sollen --> <MyComponent /> </div> </template> <script> import { provide, reactive } from \'vue\'; import MyComponent from \'./components/MyComponent.vue\'; export default { name: \'App\', components: { MyComponent, }, setup() { const sharedState = reactive({ message: \'Shared message from App.vue\', }); // Der erste Parameter ist der Injektionsschlüssel, der zweite der Zustand provide(\'sharedState\', sharedState); return {}; }, }; <\/script> ``` # Schritt 2: Injizieren des Zustands in einer untergeordneten Komponente In einer beliebigen Komponente, die ein Nachkomme von `App.vue` ist, können Sie auf den bereitgestellten Zustand mit `inject` zugreifen. ```vue <template> <div> {{ sharedState.message }} </div> </template> <script> import { inject } from \'vue\'; export default { name: \'MyComponent\', setup() { // Verwendung des gleichen Schlüssels, um den Zustand zu injizieren const sharedState = inject(\'sharedState\'); return { sharedState }; }, }; <\/script> ``` Mit dieser Methode können Sie den `provide`- und `inject`-Mechanismus innerhalb der Komponentenstruktur von Vue verwenden, ohne auf die globale `app.provide`-Methode zugreifen zu müssen. Dies ermöglicht es Ihnen, effektiv Zustände oder Objekte über die Komponentenhierarchie hinweg zu teilen, was besonders nützlich ist, um globalen Zustand oder Dienste in einer Vue 3-Anwendung bereitzustellen."},{"instruction":"Schreibe das folgende als VUE3 Modul um class Queue { constructor() { this.items = []; this.queueRunning = false; this.playQueued = this.playQueued.bind(this); this.playQueuedEnded = this.playQueuedEnded.bind(this); } isEmpty() { return this.items.length === 0; } addToQueue(item) { item.fromQueue=true; item.step = 3; this.items.push(item); console.log(\'adding item to queue: \' + this.items.length, \\"queueRunning: \\" + this.queueRunning, this.items); if (!this.queueRunning) { console.log(\'added To Queue, start play cause queue is running \', \\"queueRunning: \\" + this.queueRunning); this.playQueued(); } } playQueued() { this.queueRunning = true; console.log(\'playQueued, queue length is: \', this.items.length); // fifo var item = this.items.shift(); item.step = 4; console.log(\\"playQueued trigger eventBus\\", item.type, item); this.eventBus.emit( item.type, item ); } playQueuedEnded(event){ event.target.removeEventListener(\'ended\', this.playQueuedEnded, true); if (this.isEmpty()) { this.queueRunning = false; console.log( \'playQueuedEnded no more entries in queue: \' + this.items.length, this.queueRunning, ); } else { console.log( \'playQueuedEnded item ended, remaining items: \' + this.items.length, this.queueRunning, ); console.log(\'setting timer for next run: \', this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance); var queueTimeDistanceTimeout = window.setTimeout( this.playQueued, this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance ); } } } export default new Queue();","output":"Um die gegebene `Queue`-Klasse in ein Vue 3-Modul bzw. Composable umzuschreiben, gehen wir ähnlich vor wie bei der Verwendung von klassenbasierten Komponenten, jedoch mit der Nutzung des Composition APIs von Vue 3. Ein wichtiger Punkt dabei ist, dass ein Vue 3 Composable den Kontext, wie z.B. die Ereignisbus-Instanz (`eventBus`) und die Konfiguration (`config`), anders handhaben muss als in einer Vue-Instanzmethode oder einem Mixin. Da Composables keinen direkten Zugriff auf die Vue-Instanz oder `this` haben, müssen Abhängigkeiten wie der Eventbus und Konfigurationseinstellungen anders bereitgestellt werden. Eine Möglichkeit ist, sie als Parameter oder über `provide`/`inject`-Mechanismen zugänglich zu machen. Hier ist ein Ansatz zur Umstrukturierung der `Queue`-Klasse als Vue 3 Composable: ```javascript // useQueue.js import { reactive, toRefs } from \'vue\'; export default function useQueue(eventBus, config) { const state = reactive({ items: [], queueRunning: false, }); const isEmpty = () => { return state.items.length === 0; }; const addToQueue = (item) => { item.fromQueue = true; item.step = 3; state.items.push(item); console.log(\'adding item to queue: \' + state.items.length, \\"queueRunning: \\" + state.queueRunning, state.items); if (!state.queueRunning) { console.log(\'added To Queue, start play cause queue is running \', \\"queueRunning: \\" + state.queueRunning); playQueued(); } }; const playQueued = () => { state.queueRunning = true; console.log(\'playQueued, queue length is: \', state.items.length); // fifo var item = state.items.shift(); item.step = 4; console.log(\\"playQueued trigger eventBus\\", item.type, item); eventBus.emit(item.type, item); }; const playQueuedEnded = (event) => { event.target.removeEventListener(\'ended\', playQueuedEnded, true); if (isEmpty()) { state.queueRunning = false; console.log( \'playQueuedEnded no more entries in queue: \' + state.items.length, state.queueRunning, ); } else { console.log( \'playQueuedEnded item ended, remaining items: \' + state.items.length, state.queueRunning, ); console.log(\'setting timer for next run: \', config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance); var queueTimeDistanceTimeout = window.setTimeout( playQueued, config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance ); } }; return { ...toRefs(state), addToQueue, playQueued, playQueuedEnded }; } ``` In Ihrer Vue-App müssten Sie dann das Composable `useQueue` zusammen mit dem Eventbus und Konfigurationsobjekt verwenden. Wenn Sie nicht bereits über eine zentrale Methode zur Bereitstellung dieser Abhängigkeiten (wie durch ein Root-`provide` oder einen globalen Zustandsmanager) verfügen, müssten Sie diese beim Aufruf von `useQueue` übergeben. ```javascript import useQueue from \'./useQueue\'; import eventBus from \'./eventBus\'; // Ihr zentralisierte Ereignisbus-Instanz import config from \'./config\'; // Ihre App-Konfiguration export default { setup() { const { addToQueue, playQueued, playQueuedEnded } = useQueue(eventBus, config); // ... nutzen Sie addToQueue, playQueued, playQueuedEnded hier } } ``` Dieser Ansatz transformiert die Klasse in ein Composition API-“Composable“, was es einfacher macht, sie innerhalb der Setup-Funktion jeder Komponente in einer Vue 3-App zu verwenden. Denken Sie daran, dass Sie für den `eventBus` und `config` einen konkreten Mechanismus zur Verfügung stellen müssen, um diese Instanzen zu erhalten, falls diese nicht schon global verfügbar gemacht wurden."},{"instruction":"Schreibe das folgende um als Vue3 Module class Queue { constructor() { this.items = []; this.queueRunning = false; this.playQueued = this.playQueued.bind(this); this.playQueuedEnded = this.playQueuedEnded.bind(this); } isEmpty() { return this.items.length === 0; } addToQueue(item) { item.fromQueue=true; item.step = 3; this.items.push(item); console.log(\'adding item to queue: \' + this.items.length, \\"queueRunning: \\" + this.queueRunning, this.items); if (!this.queueRunning) { console.log(\'added To Queue, start play cause queue is running \', \\"queueRunning: \\" + this.queueRunning); this.playQueued(); } } playQueued() { this.queueRunning = true; console.log(\'playQueued, queue length is: \', this.items.length); // fifo var item = this.items.shift(); item.step = 4; console.log(\\"playQueued trigger eventBus\\", item.type, item); this.eventBus.emit( item.type, item ); } playQueuedEnded(event){ event.target.removeEventListener(\'ended\', this.playQueuedEnded, true); if (this.isEmpty()) { this.queueRunning = false; console.log( \'playQueuedEnded no more entries in queue: \' + this.items.length, this.queueRunning, ); } else { console.log( \'playQueuedEnded item ended, remaining items: \' + this.items.length, this.queueRunning, ); console.log(\'setting timer for next run: \', this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance); var queueTimeDistanceTimeout = window.setTimeout( this.playQueued, this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance ); } } } export default new Queue();","output":"Um das gegebene Klassendesign in ein Vue 3 Modul zu übertragen, das selbstverwaltet und reaktiv ist, könnten wir die Composition API von Vue 3 nutzen. Wir würden `ref` für reaktive Daten wie `items` und `queueRunning` verwenden und Funktionen als setup-Funktionen deklarieren. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass das Konzept von `eventBus` in Vue 3 nicht direkt unterstützt wird, da die EventBus-Funktionalität entfernt wurde. Stattdessen könnten wir entweder ein externes Zustandsverwaltungssystem wie Vuex oder die Provide/Inject API für die Kommunikation über Komponenten verwenden. Hier ist ein grober Entwurf, wie die Klasse `Queue` als Vue 3 Composition API Modul refaktorisiert werden könnte. Für den EventBus-Teil werde ich einen einfachen Platzhalter verwenden, den du durch eine tatsächliche Implementierung ersetzen solltest (z.B. durch Verwendung eines globalen Store oder custom events): ```javascript import { ref } from \'vue\'; // Platzhalter-EventBus-Funktionen. Ersetze diese durch deine Event-Kommunikation function emitEvent(eventType, payload) { console.log(`Event emitted: {eventType}`, payload); // Implementiere deine Logik hier, z.B. über einen global store oder custom events } export function useQueue() { const items = ref([]); const queueRunning = ref(false); // Methoden function isEmpty() { return items.value.length === 0; } function addToQueue(item) { item.fromQueue = true; item.step = 3; items.value.push(item); console.log(\'adding item to queue: \' + items.value.length, \\"queueRunning: \\" + queueRunning.value, items.value); if (!queueRunning.value) { console.log(\'added To Queue, start play cause queue is running \', \\"queueRunning: \\" + queueRunning.value); playQueued(); } } function playQueued() { queueRunning.value = true; console.log(\'playQueued, queue length is: \', items.value.length); const item = items.value.shift(); item.step = 4; console.log(\\"playQueued trigger event\\", item.type, item); emitEvent(item.type, item); // Geändert von eventBus.emit } function playQueuedEnded(event) { event.target.removeEventListener(\'ended\', playQueuedEnded, true); if (isEmpty()) { queueRunning.value = false; console.log( \'playQueuedEnded no more entries in queue: \' + items.value.length, queueRunning.value, ); } else { console.log( \'playQueuedEnded item ended, remaining items: \' + items.value.length, queueRunning.value, ); console.log(\'setting timer for next run: \', 5000); // Ersetzt this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance mit einem statischen Wert oder von einer Konfigurationsquelle window.setTimeout(playQueued, 5000); // Geändert zu einem statischen Wert oder von einer Konfigurationsquelle } } return { addToQueue, playQueued, playQueuedEnded, queueRunning, items }; } ``` In diesem Beispiel würdest du die `useQueue` Funktion innerhalb einer Vue-Komponente aufrufen, um deren Methoden und reaktive Eigenschaften zu verwenden.

Учитывается, что `ref`, `unref` и `emit` используются должным образом в соответствии с Vue 3 Composition API. Также предполагается, что вы поместите этот код внутри `setup()` функции компонента для правильного использования Composition API. Так как `this.refs` не используется в Composition API напрямую, необходимо будет применить другой подход для доступа к рефам, например, используя `ref` или `reactive` для их хранения. ```javascript import { ref, unref, watchEffect } from \'vue\'; export default { setup(props, { emit }) { const count = ref(0); // Пример инициализации count, значение должно прийти из ваших пропсов/другой логики const groups = ref({}); // Создаем рефы для каждой группы; это пример, возможно, потребуется адаптация под вашу логику const groupRefs = ref([]); // Эмуляция создания рефов для групп for (let i = 1; i <= unref(count); i++) { groupRefs.value[i] = ref(null); // Присвоение DOM элемента будет в вашем шаблоне через ref=\\"groupRefs[i]\\" } const next = () => { const newGroups = {}; for (let i = 1; i <= unref(count); i++) { // Предполагается, что groupRefs у вас будет содержать реальные рефы к вашим группам // и что generateGroup() - это метод ваших компонентов группы. if (groupRefs.value[i]?.value) { const group = groupRefs.value[i].value.generateGroup(); Object.assign(newGroups, group); } } groups.value = newGroups; emit(\'next-step\', newGroups); }; watchEffect(() => { // Пример как можно отслеживать изменение count и выполнять действия // Это просто для демонстрации, возможно, в вашем конкретном случае это не понадобится console.log(`Count changed to: {count.value}`); }); return { groups, next }; } } ``` Важно отметить, что доступ к рефам элементов осуществляется по-другому в Composition API по сравнению с Options API. Теперь вы должны использовать `ref` для создания ссылки на элементы DOM и компоненты, и вы не можете просто обращаться к ним через `this.refs`. В примере выше использование `groupRefs` показывает, как можно организовать доступ к рефам компонентов внутри `setup`. Также следует помнить, что теперь нет необходимости использовать `this.` для доступа к свойствам и методам компонента внутри `setup`. Вместо этого, вы работаете напрямую с переменными и функциями, возвращаемыми из `setup`."},{"instruction":"я знаю сколько всего лотов у меня в сделках как узнать какой это процент от депозита на mql5","output":"Чтобы рассчитать, какой процент от вашего депозита составляют лоты ваших сделок на MQL5, вам необходимо узнать общий размер лотов в ваших открытых сделках, а затем вычислить, какую часть от вашего депозита они составляют. Вот шаги, которые помогут вам это сделать: 1. **Определение размера лотов:** Сначала важно точно определить общее количество лотов в ваших сделках. Допустим, у вас есть три сделки, с лотами 0.1, 0.2 и 0.5 соответственно. Это означает, что общее количество лотов составит 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.8 лота. 2. **Вычисление стоимости лотов:** Чтобы вычислить общую стоимость этих лотов, вам необходимо знать стоимость одного лота. Стоимость лота часто зависит от типа торгуемого инструмента, но для примера, допустим стоимость 1 лота составляет 10,000. Следовательно, общая стоимость ваших лотов будет 0.8 * 10,000 = 8,000. 3. **Расчет процента от депозита:** Далее, нужно знать размер вашего депозита. Допустим, ваш депозит составляет 20,000. Чтобы выяснить, какой процент от вашего депозита составляют лоты, используйте следующую формулу: [ text{Процент от депозита} = left( frac{text{Общая стоимость лотов}}{text{Размер депозита}} right) times 100 ] [ text{Процент от депозита} = left( frac{8000}{20000} right) times 100 = 40% ] Таким образом, 0.8 лота из ваших сделок составляют 40% от вашего депозита. Обратите внимание, что для точного расчета вам необходимо знать реальные значения, такие как стоимость одного лота для конкретного инструмента, которым вы торгуете, а также точный размер вашего депозита.

Ему предстоит преодолеть длинный и опасный путь домой пешком через неспокойные улицы города. В песне прозвучат мысли о свободе, одиночестве и неприятии общественных норм. 2. **\\"Забытые ботинки\\"**: История о человеке, который идет против системы и стандартов, навязанных обществом. Он ходит в старых, изношенных ботинках, которые для него являются символом его борьбы и несгибаемости духа. Эта песня – гимн тем, кто не боится выглядеть не так, как все, и идет своим путем, независимо от мнений окружающих. 3. **\\"Глас асфальта\\"**: Энергичная песня о городской жизни, виденной глазами скейтбордиста, который каждый день прокладывает свой маршрут по асфальтовым джунглям. Он переживает свободу, скорость, встречи и столкновения с разношерстной публикой. Песня передает атмосферу молодежного бунта и жажды приключений на фоне городских закатов. 4. **\\"Не проданная песня\\"**: Ироничная и самокритичная песня о группе, которая пытается сохранить свою честность и идеалы в мире коммерциализированной музыки. Они отказываются идти на компромиссы с лейблами и продавать свою музыку, в итоге оказываясь на грани финансового краха, но сохраняя свой стиль и уважение своей аудитории. 5. **\\"В стране отчуждения\\"**: Песня о чувстве отчуждения и неприятия со стороны общества, которое испытывают многие молодые люди. Они чувствуют себя чужими в собственной стране, где царит бесправие, коррупция и недоверие к правительству. Молодежь объединяется в поиске своего места в жизни, где можно свободно выражать свои мысли и быть услышанным. 6. **\\"Эхо поколений\\"**: Это песня о поколенческой эстафете идей и ценностей от более старого поколения бунтарей к молодым. Сюжет охватывает истории разных поколений, которые связаны общим стремлением к переменам и желанием сделать мир лучше, несмотря на все препятствия и невзгоды."},{"instruction":"Ещё 5 сюжетов с вариантами припевов","output":"# 7. **\\"Город, что не спит\\"** **Сюжет:** Композиция прослеживает ночные приключения группы друзей, которые проводят время, скитаясь по неспящему городу, ища свободу и отрыв от рутины. Эта ночь полна неожиданных встреч, свободы слова и выхода из зоны комфорта. **Припев:** \\"В городе, что не сомкнет веки, Мы нашли свои секреты, Где каждый уголок знаком – Там, где свобода, там – наш дом.\\" # 8. **\\"Следы на песке\\"** **Сюжет:** Песня о временности и изменчивости жизни, сравниваемой со следами на песке, которые смывает прибой. Она задумывается о значении каждого шага, который мы делаем, и о вечном стремлении оставить после себя что-то значимое, несмотря на все стихии мира. **Припев:** \\"Следы на песке, что смоет волна, Но каждый из нас хочет стать иной – Оставить свой знак, ведь каждая долга, Противиться вечному забвенью строй.\\" # 9. **\\"Крик на лице ветра\\"** **Сюжет:** Очень энергичная песня, посвященная активистам и всем, кто борется за изменения в обществе, несмотря на противодействие и репрессии. Они словно кричат против ветра, но их голоса соединяются в единый крик, который способен изменить мир. **Припев:** \\"Мы кричим на лицо ветра, Голоса летят в ночь, Мы – эхо изменений эры, Свет в туннеле подожжём.\\" # 10. **\\"Асфальтовые цветы\\"** **Сюжет:** Ещё одна песня о городской жизни, но с акцентом на нахождение красоты в самых неожиданных местах, таких как цветы, пробивающиеся сквозь асфальт. Это метафора решимости и надежды в условиях городской среды, где кажется, что нет места натуральной красоте. **Припев:** \\"Мы – асфальтовые цветы, Сквозь темноту пробьемся светом. В мире, где жесткость – это моды, Мы – живой и яркий лепесток.\\" # 11. **\\"Эйфория мгновений\\"** **Сюжет:** Эта песня – ода тем небольшим мгновениям жизни, которые приносят неописуемую радость и чувство единения с миром. Она говорит о том, что важно уметь видеть и ценить эти моменты, не теряясь в повседневной суете. **Припев:** \\"В мгновениях – эйфория, летим, Сердца бьются в унисон этим миром. И в каждом мгновенье – жизни смысл острым, Поймать момент – в этом наша эйфория светлым.\\""},{"instruction":"напиши кликбейтный заголовок для лекции по формальной верификации: Рассмотрим процесс формальной верификации свойств простого контракта типа EIP20.

Hoje, estamos reunidos aqui, em espírito e em verdade, para mergulhar profundamente em um dos tesouros da Palavra de Deus. Estaremos refletindo sobre o capítulo 23 do livro de Provérbios, absorvendo cada gota de sabedoria e instrução divina para nossas vidas. Convido a cada um de vocês a abrir o coração e permitir que a semente da Palavra frutifique em solo fértil. Este é um dia que o Senhor fez para nossa edificação e crescimento espiritual. Venham, embarquemos juntos nesta jornada. # Desenvolvimento: Parte 1: **Guardando o Coração** No começo do capítulo 23 de Provérbios, somos lembrados sobre a importância de guardarmos nosso coração, especialmente em situações onde as aparências podem nos enganar. O versículo 3 nos alerta: \\"Não cobices as suas iguarias, porque são manjares enganosos.\\" Irmãos, como é fácil cairmos na tentação de desejarmos o que parece bom aos olhos, mas que no fundo, pode nos afastar dos caminhos do Senhor. A verdadeira sabedoria consiste em discernir além das aparências e buscar alimentar nosso espírito com aquilo que verdadeiramente nos edifica. Parte 2: **A Sabedoria do Provimento** Avançando na leitura, encontramos uma exortação poderosa sobre a sabedoria do provimento. O verso 12 diz: \\"Aplica o teu coração à instrução e os teus ouvidos às palavras do conhecimento.\\" Nossa fonte inesgotável de conhecimento e sabedoria está no Senhor. Investir tempo na Palavra de Deus e na comunhão com Ele é provimento para a nossa alma, é garantia de uma vida pautada na verdadeira sabedoria que nos guia, protege e nos mantém no caminho certo. Parte 3: **Vivendo Além das Aparências** Por último, mas não menos importante, somos chamados a viver além das aparências. Este mundo nos bombardeia com inúmeras tentações e nos oferece constantemente um estilo de vida que se opõe aos princípios do Reino de Deus. O capítulo 23 nos ensina a ter discernimento e a entender que o valor verdadeiro da vida não está no que é visível aos olhos, mas naquilo que é eterno. \\"Pois não é sábio entregar-se ao vinho nem correr atrás da cerveja.\\" (verso 20). Este versículo simboliza a importância de não nos perdermos em desejos momentâneos que podem nos causar dano espiritual, emocional e físico. # Oração Empolgante e Devocional: Querido Pai Celestial, nós Te agradecemos por este momento de comunhão e reflexão na Tua Palavra. Que cada ensinamento do capítulo 23 de Provérbios se grave em nossos corações, alimentando nossa alma e nos conduzindo no caminho da retidão. Ajuda-nos a discernir as aparências enganosas deste mundo, a investir no verdadeiro conhecimento que vem de Ti e a viver uma vida que reflita Tua glória e Tua santidade. Fortalece-nos em nossa caminhada diária contigo e que possamos ser luz nesse mundo, mostrando o caminho que conduz a Ti. Em nome de Jesus, amém! # Conclusão e Chamada para Ação: Queridos irmãos e irmãs, chegamos ao fim de mais uma reflexão que, espero, tenha tocado profundamente seus corações. Se você foi abençoado por esta mensagem, eu lhe peço, inscreva-se em nosso canal, deixe seu like e compartilhe este vídeo com amigos e familiares. Que a palavra de Deus possa alcançar muitos corações através de nós. Que o Senhor os abençoe ricamente, hoje e sempre.

Deus abençoe a todos!"},{"instruction":"Юридические факты в гражданском праве введение к курсовой работе","output":"Введение в курсовую работу на тему \\"Юридические факты в гражданском праве\\" может быть оформлено следующим образом: --- В современном правовом поле российского гражданского права важнейшую роль играют юридические факты, являющиеся основанием возникновения, изменения или прекращения гражданских прав и обязанностей. В Гражданском кодексе РФ юридические факты получили свое закрепление, тем не менее, исследование и анализ юридических фактов, их природы, классификации и влияния на правоотношения требует углубленного изучения и понимания. Цель данной курсовой работы заключается в анализе понятия юридических фактов в гражданском праве, выявлении их видов, особенностей, а также изучении их роли и значения в правовом регулировании. Для достижения поставленных целей необходимо решить следующие задачи: 1. Исследовать теоретические аспекты юридических фактов как юридической категории, их место и роль в системе гражданского права. 2. Проанализировать нормативное регулирование юридических фактов в нормах российского гражданского законодательства. 3. Классифицировать юридические факты на основе различных критериев и обосновать необходимость их разделения на виды. 4. Изучить юридические последствия наступления различных видов юридических фактов. 5. Определить особенности применения отдельных видов юридических фактов на практике осуществления гражданских правоотношений. Таким образом, объектом исследования выступают юридические факты в системе гражданского права, а предметом – нормативное регулирование и практическое применение юридических фактов, их классификация и влияние на возникновение, изменение и прекращение гражданских правоотношений. Исследование базируется на эксплуатации нормативных актов, комментариях к Гражданскому кодексу РФ, научных работах и статьях в области гражданского права, а также судебной практике, отражающей применение норм о юридических фактах. Методологическую основу работы составляют общенаучные и специальные методы познания: анализ, синтез, обобщение, системный подход, метод компаративистики и другие. Ожидается, что результаты проведенного исследования позволят глубже понять природу и роль юридических фактов в гражданском праве, а также способствовать более эффективному решению возникающих на практике вопросов, связанных с их применением. --- Этот пример вводной части к курсовой работе можно адаптировать под конкретные требования и задачи вашего исследования."}]'),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},I={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],F={key:0},L={key:1};function M(n,e,h,f,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",I,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(w,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),x(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
