Therefore, x^2 - (k-2)x + 1 = 0 has only one solution in (0, +infty). Let f(x) = x^2 - (k-2)x + 1. When x = 0, f(x) = x^2 - (k-2)x + 1 = 1 > 0. Therefore, Delta = (k-2)^2 - 4 = 0.

Considering the relation between the circumradius and inradius in right triangles:     [     R = frac{5}{2}r     ] 5. By the Pythagorean theorem in ( triangle ABC ):     [     AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2      ]     Substituting known expressions, we get:     [     (r + 2R - x)^2 + a^2 = (2R)^2     ]     where ( x = a - r ). 6. Substituting ( R = frac{5}{2}r ), we have:     [     (r + 2 cdot frac{5}{2}r - (a - r))^2 + a^2 = 25r^2      ]     Simplify inside the parentheses:     [     (r + 5r - a + r)^2 + a^2 = 25r^2     ]     [     (7r - a)^2 + a^2 = 25r^2     ] 7. Expanding the equation:     [     49r^2 - 14ar + a^2 + a^2 = 25r^2     ]     [     49r^2 - 14ar + 2a^2 = 25r^2     ]     Rearrange and combine like terms:     [     24r^2 - 14ar + 2a^2 = 0      ]     Divide through by 2:     [     12r^2 - 7ar + a^2 = 0     ] 8. Solve the quadratic equation for ( r ):     [     r = frac{7a pm sqrt{(7a)^2 - 4 cdot 12 cdot a^2}}{2 cdot 12}     ]     [     r = frac{7a pm sqrt{49a^2 - 48a^2}}{24}     ]     [     r = frac{7a pm sqrt{a^2}}{24}     ]     [     r = frac{7a pm a}{24}     ]     [     r_1 = frac{8a}{24} = frac{a}{3}     ]     [     r_2 = frac{6a}{24} = frac{a}{4}     ] 9. For each value of ( r ), calculate the corresponding hypotenuse ( AC ):     [     AC_1 = sqrt{(2R - (a - r_1))^2 + a^2} = sqrt{left(frac{10a}{6}right)^2} = frac{4a}{3}     ]     [     AC_2 = sqrt{(2R - (a - r_2))^2 + a^2} = sqrt{left(frac{26a}{8}right)^2} = frac{3a}{4}     ] 10. Thus, the areas of each triangle are:     [     S_1 = frac{1}{2} cdot a cdot frac{4a}{3} = frac{2a^2}{3}     ]     [     S_2 = frac{1}{2} cdot a cdot frac{3a}{4} = frac{3a^2}{8}     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{2a^2}{3} text{ or } frac{3a^2}{8}} ]"},{"instruction":"A line passes through the vectors (mathbf{a}) and (mathbf{b}).

If these angles are equal, then the right triangles ( H A B_H ) and ( B_H A B' ) will have three identical angles, making them congruent by the AA (Angle-Angle) criterion. This congruence implies that the distances ( B'B_H ) and ( B_H H ) are equal, and thus ( B' ) is the reflection of ( H ) over ( AC ). 4. **Angle Calculation:**    Let (alpha = angle H A B_H). Since (angle H A B_H) and (angle C B B') both subtend the same arc ( AB ) on the circumcircle, they are equal by the Inscribed Angle Theorem.

Given the condition that the solution set with respect to x is (m, n), we understand that these roots define the intervals on the x-axis where the inequality holds true.

However, given that m and n are supposed to represent an interval, and with n = -3, this configuration does not make sense as it does not respect the condition m < n. Therefore, this case is discarded. For the second case, setting m = -3 directly and solving frac{1}{m} = n gives us n = -frac{1}{3}. This satisfies the conditions given, including m < n.

There can be no more than two checkers on any row or column. A player loses if they cannot make a move on their turn. Who wins with optimal play?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a (51 times 51) checkered board, and two players take turns placing a single piece on the board. Each row and column can have no more than 2 pieces. A player loses if they cannot make a move. The task is to determine which player has a winning strategy if both players play optimally. 2. **Identifying Equivalent States**: Notice that rearranging the rows or columns of the board does not change the fundamental problem. That is, if a configuration of pieces is losing for the first player under one arrangement of the rows and columns, then it remains losing under any permutation of the rows and columns because the constraints concern only the counts of pieces in rows and columns. 3. **Starting Scenario**: Suppose the first player places the first piece. We rearrange the board such that this first piece is on the central column but not in the central row (assuming the board is indexed from 1 to 51, the central column would be column 26). 4. **Symmetric Strategy by the Second Player**: The second player should adopt a symmetric strategy relative to the center of the board. Whenever the first player places a piece, the second player places a piece that is symmetric to the first player's move with respect to the center of the board. 5. **Ensuring Constraints are Not Violated**:     - After the first move, the first piece is placed somewhere on the central vertical line but not necessarily in the middle.     - The second player places a piece symmetrically, ensuring that for every move made by the first player in one half-plane relative to the center vertical line, there is an equal and opposite move by the second player.     - This symmetry ensures that if a row or column could accommodate a piece by the first player, the symmetrically opposite row or column can accommodate the second player's piece. 6. **Consequence of Symmetry**:     - Every time the first player places a piece, the number of pieces on any row or column is increased by one if it was initially fly empty, or remains at two if it was already occupied.     - Hence, if the first player cannot place a piece on a row or column due to the two-piece limit, similarly the symmetric condition will hold for the second player. 7. **Central Row and Column Control**:     - Both pieces from each player’s moves can never both fully occupy the same central row or column because of the symmetric strategy.     - Thus, only two pieces can ever occupy any row or column simultaneously, ensuring all moves are valid under the game rules. 8. **Final Moves**:     - Near the end of the game, if the first player is unable to find a valid move (because every possible placement position has been exhausted), the mirrored placement condition guarantees that the second player will also run out of valid moves almost simultaneously.     - Since it’s the first player who initially places the first piece, they will reach this deadlock scenario first. # Conclusion: The second player wins because they can always make a symmetric move until the board reaches full capacity under the given constraints, leading the first player to ultimately run out of moves first.

Now, let's denote the time from the moment Bob starts walking until they meet as ( t ) hours. In this time, Yolanda walks ( 3t ) miles (because her speed is 3 miles per hour) and Bob walks ( 4t ) miles (because his speed is 4 miles per hour). The total distance they have to cover when they meet is 31 miles. Yolanda has already walked 3 miles before Bob started, so the remaining distance to be covered by both of them when Bob starts is ( 31 - 3 = 28 ) miles. The sum of the distances they walk after Bob starts should add up to 28 miles, so we have: [ 3t + 4t = 28 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 7t = 28 ] Dividing both sides by 7, we find: [ t = 4 ] So, Bob has been walking for 4 hours when they meet.

Is it possible that after these results, the team finished only 7th? (A win awards 3 points, a draw 1 point each, and in the case of equal points, the ranking is determined by goal difference.)","output":"1. Let us first examine the points scored by the Alsórákosi STC team. They had 5 wins and 3 losses. Each win earns 3 points, so the total points they scored can be calculated as follows: [ 5 , text{wins} times 3 , text{points per win} = 15 , text{points} ] 2. Alsórákosi STC finished in 7th place among 9 teams. For this to be possible, all teams ranked from 1st to 6th must have at least 15 points each.     3. Calculate the total number of matches played in a round-robin tournament consisting of 9 teams. The formula for the number of matches is: [ binom{9}{2} = frac{9 times 8}{2} = 36 , text{matches} ] 4. Out of these 36 matches, exactly one match is played between each pair of teams. Therefore, each match contributes a maximum of 3 points (win or draw). The total possible points in the entire tournament is: [ 36 times 3 = 108 , text{points} ] 5. For the Alsórákosi STC team to be 7th with 15 points, the 8th and 9th place teams must score fewer points. This means the top 7 teams could score up to: [ 7 times 15 = 105 , text{points} ] 6. Since there are 108 total points available and the top 7 teams collected exactly 105 points, this leaves only 3 points to be distributed among the 8th and 9th teams. Hence, these teams could win a maximum of one match between them (the 3 remaining points). 7. To show a possible scoring scenario:    - The top 7 teams defeat both the 8th and 9th place teams. The distribution of points is:      - 7 teams × 6 points (defeating both 8th and 9th place teams): ( 7 times 6 = 42 ) points.    - These 7 teams collect another 3×3=9 points each by beating three other teams in their internal matches:      - ( 7 times 9 = 63 ) points. So we balance the equation: [ 42 text{ (beating 8th and 9th place teams)} + 63 text{ (internal wins)} = 105 text{ points} ] 8.

Select four points ( A, B, C, A_1 ) which define a unique sphere because four points that do not lie on the same plane are sufficient to determine a sphere.    2. Let this sphere intersect the edges ( SB ) and ( SC ) at points ( B_1^{prime} ) and ( C_1^{prime} ) respectively.    3. Consider the quadrilateral ( A_1 B_1^{prime} BA ). According to the power of a point theorem relative to a circle, we have:    [    SA_1 cdot SA = SB_1^{prime} cdot SB    ]    4. Similarly, consider the quadrilateral ( A_1 C_1^{prime} CA ). Using the power of a point theorem, we have:    [    SA_1 cdot SA = SC_1^{prime} cdot SC    ]    5.

Since the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Therefore, the relative speed is: 80 km/h + 65 km/h = 145 km/h To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to m/s. We know that 1 km/h is equivalent to 1000 m / 3600 s (since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour). So, we convert the relative speed as follows: 145 km/h = 145 * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 145 * (10/36) m/s = 1450/36 m/s ≈ 40.2777778 m/s Now, we have the relative speed in meters per second and the time it takes for the trains to clear each other in seconds. The distance covered by the trains in this time is the sum of their lengths. We can calculate this distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Let's plug in the values we have: Distance = 40.2777778 m/s * 7.100121645440779 s ≈ 286.197 m We know the second train is 165 meters long, so the length of the first train (L1) can be found by subtracting the length of the second train from the total distance: L1 = Distance - Length of second train L1 = 286.197 m - 165 m = 121.197 m Therefore, the length of the first train is approximately boxed{121.197}  meters."},{"instruction":"A natural number is called a palindrome if it remains unchanged when its digits are written in reverse order (for example, numbers 4, 55, 626 are palindromes, but 20, 201, 2016 are not).

Let the axes of the three symmetries be ( l_1 ), ( l_2 ), and ( l_3 ), all passing through the point ( O ). # Steps: 1. Consider the axes ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) which intersect at point ( O ). The composition of symmetry with respect to ( l_1 ) and then ( l_2 ) can be represented as a rotation about the point ( O ) by twice the angle between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ). 2.

The sums of all non-empty subsets are distinct: ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 ). Therefore, for ( n geq 16 ), it is possible to choose 5 numbers such that no two subsets have the same sum. Conclusion: Thus, the largest ( n ) such that any five numbers chosen from ({1, 2, ldots, n}) can always be partitioned into two groups with equal sums is ( n = 15 ). The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 15 } )."},{"instruction":"triangle triangle ABC, sin ^{2}Asin ^{2}Bsin ^{2}C=sin Bsin C.<br/>(1) Find the value of A;<br/>(2) If BC=3, find the maximum perimeter of triangle triangle ABC.","output":"**(1) Finding the value of A:** Let's denote the sides opposite to the internal angles A, B, and C of triangle triangle ABC as a, b, and c, respectively.

The initial north-south distance between the two cars is 300 miles. After 5 hours, this distance does not change because both cars are moving in the east-west direction. The east-west distance between the two cars after 5 hours is the sum of the distances each car has traveled in the east-west direction. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add the distances together: East-west distance = ( 100 ) miles (westward by the northern car) + ( 5v ) miles (eastward by the southern car).

To solve the problem, we need to use binary and ternary numeral systems. Every natural number n can be uniquely represented as a sum:     [     n = c_0 cdot 2^k + c_1 cdot 2^{k-1} + c_2 cdot 2^{k-2} + ldots + c_{k-1} cdot 2^1 + c_k cdot 2^0     ]         Here, c_i can be either 0 or 1. These coefficients (c_0, c_1, ldots, c_k) are the digits in the binary representation of the number. We denote this binary representation by:     [     (n)_2 = overline{c_0 c_1 c_2 ldots c_k}     ]     For example, ((8)_2 = 1000) and ((17)_2 = 10001). 2. Similarly, every natural number n can also be represented in the ternary numeral system as:     [     n = b_0 cdot 3^l + b_1 cdot 3^{l-1} + ldots + b_{l-1} cdot 3^1 + b_l cdot 3^0     ]     where b_0 = 1 text{ or } 2 and for i geq 1, b_i can be 0, 1, or 2. We denote the ternary representation by:     [     (n)_3 = overline{b_0 b_1 ldots b_l}     ]     For example, ((5)_3 = 12), ((26)_3 = 222), and (left(3^k - 1right)_3 = underbrace{22 ldots 2}_{k text{ times}}). 3. Now, consider any number m from 0 to 3^k - 1. It can be uniquely represented in the ternary system as:     [     (m)_3 = overline{d_1 d_2 d_3 ldots d_k}     ]     where the digits d_i can be any of 0, 1, or 2. If the ternary representation of m has fewer than k digits, we pad it with zeros on the left. For instance:     - ((0)_3 = underbrace{00 ldots 0}_{k text{ times}})     - (left( frac{3^k-1}{2} right)_3 = underbrace{11 ldots 1}_{k text{ times}})     - (left(3^k-1right)_{3} = underbrace{22 ldots 2}_{k text{ times}}) 4. According to the combinatorial lemma (see reference provided in the problem statement), there are 2^k numbers among 0 to 3^k - 1 whose ternary representations consist only of 0s and 1s. Let's denote these numbers by a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2^k}. 5. We claim that these numbers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2^k} satisfy the conditions of the problem. Specifically, none of them can be the arithmetic mean of any other two distinct numbers from this set.      - Consider two distinct numbers t and s from this set. In their ternary representations, the sum of the corresponding digits for each place does not include the digit 2, as t and s use only 0s and 1s. Therefore, if their sum were another number which uses only the digits 0 and 1, it would contradict the structure of binary arithmetic, where carrying occurs.     - An arithmetic mean involving a 2 in ternary would suggest digit sums sometimes equate to 2, which is not allowed with these specific numbers selected. Thus, we conclude there exist 2^k distinct numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2^k}) between 0 and (3^k - 1) such that none of them is the arithmetic mean of any two others.

Let's denote the sides opposite to these altitudes as a, b, and c respectively, corresponding to angles A, B, and C respectively in triangle ABC. From the area formula of a triangle, we know that the area can be expressed as frac{1}{2}absin C, but it can also be expressed using the altitudes as frac{1}{2}ah_a = frac{1}{2}bh_b = frac{1}{2}ch_c.  To find the relationship between the sides, we assign a convenient value to one side and calculate the others. Let's assign a = 14, which gives us a base to work with. From frac{1}{2}ah_a = frac{1}{2}bh_b = frac{1}{2}ch_c, substituting the values of the altitudes, we have: - frac{1}{2} times 14 times frac{1}{14} = frac{1}{2} times 10 times frac{1}{10} = frac{1}{2} times 5 times frac{1}{5} This directly gives us the lengths a = 14, b = 10, and c = 5 after solving the equations based on the area expressions.

An obtuse angle in a triangle makes it an obtuse triangle because a triangle cannot have more than one obtuse angle.

The simplest example of such a polygon is a parallelogram.     - Consider three parallelograms meeting at a common vertex; they already form at least seven vertices.     - Consequently, the simplest example of a polyhedron fulfilling the given conditions is a parallelepiped (box-shaped polyhedron), which obviously has a center of symmetry.     To prove this for any polyhedron (P), we need to show that there exists a point (O) such that reflecting (P) across (O) maps each face of (P) into itself.     ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_fb814c20d98ead3dfafbg-1.jpg?height=1054&width=724&top_left_y=384&top_left_x=690) 2. **Reflection Analysis on the Polyhedron:**     - Let (L_1) be a face of (P) and consider a vertical edge with lower endpoint (A_1) and upper endpoint (B_1). Denote their reflections over the symmetry center of the face by (A_2) and (B_2) respectively.     - By the given condition, (A_2B_2) is also an edge of (L_1), and consequently, some other face (L_2) of (P) must be adjacent to (L_1) at (A_2B_2).     - Reflect (A_2B_2) over the symmetry center of (L_2) to get (A_3B_3), and continue this process.     - The sequence (A_1B_1, A_2B_2, A_3B_3, ldots) consists of parallel edges of equal lengths with each pair oppositely directed.     This reflection sequence will eventually intersect a previously marked edge (A_jB_j), thus:     - Either (A_{k+1}) coincides with (A_j) or (B_j), and similarly for (B_{k+1}) with the endpoints of (A_jB_j). 3. **Convex Polyhedron Properties:**     - Because (P) is convex, (A_{k+1}) must coincide with either (A_j) or (B_j).     - We must have (j = 1) because any (j > 1) would imply three faces meeting at a common edge, which is impossible in a convex polyhedron.     Therefore, the sequence forms a zone or belt-like structure around (P) and ensures (P) remains within these bounds while each face maintains its symmetry properties. 4. **Projection and Symmetry:**     - Project (P) along the direction of (A_1B_1) onto a horizontal plane (V), denoted by (A_i') and (B_i').     - Segments (A_i'A_{i+1}') represent the projections of the edges, maintaining symmetry about their midpoints.     - Each face projects as a centrally symmetric polygon, consistent with the condition that every face has a center of symmetry. 5. **Central Symmetry of the Polyhedron:**     - By considering the projections and maintaining the property of symmetry among all zones, it is observed that the polyhedron itself must be centrally symmetric.     - If any face (L) is reflected over a point (O), all adjacent faces also reflect symmetrically, creating a chain of reflections leading to the same central point (O) for all faces.     Thus, (P) is centrally symmetric, which completes the proof.     [     blacksquare     ]"},{"instruction":"There are 10 red and 10 yellow apples with a total weight of 1 kg.

( a + 6b + 2 ) is a prime number    We need to find the pairs ( (a, b) ) that satisfy exactly three of these four conditions, determining which one is false. 2. Let's start with condition 3 and condition 4. If condition 3 is true, we have:    [    a + 2b + 2 equiv 0 pmod{4}    ]    Thus, ( a + 2b + 2 = 4k ) for some integer ( k ). Now consider condition 4. If condition 4 is also true, then:    [    a + 6b + 2    ]    should be a prime number. But if 3 is true, then:    [    a + 6b + 2 = (a + 2b + 2) + 4b = 4k + 4b    ]    This simplifies to being a multiple of 4, which can't be a prime (except 2, but ( a + 6b + 2 > 2 ) for integers (a,b)).

Since this is a downward-facing parabola, the inequality holds for a leq -2 - sqrt{7} or a geq -2 + sqrt{7}. However, we are considering only positive values for a due to the first inequality, so the range for a is a geq -2 + sqrt{7}.

The outer dimensions of the box are 50 cm x 40 cm x 23 cm. The inner dimensions of the box can be calculated by subtracting the thickness of the metal from the outer dimensions.

The total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 6 (the sum of 4 red and 2 white balls) is calculated using the combination formula {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}. Thus, the total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 6 is {C}_{6}^{3} = frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = 20. 2. To draw exactly one white ball, we choose 1 white ball from the 2 white balls and 2 red balls from the 4 red balls. The number of ways to do this is given by the product of the combinations: C{}_{2}^{1}C{}_{4}^{2}. Calculating each combination separately, we have C{}_{2}^{1} = frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = 2 and C{}_{4}^{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6. Multiplying these together gives 2 times 6 = 12 ways to draw exactly one white ball. 3. Therefore, the probability of drawing exactly one white ball is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is P = frac{12}{20}. Simplifying this fraction gives P = frac{3}{5}. For the second part of the problem, we consider the probability of event B given event A has occurred, denoted as P(B|A). Event A is drawing a red ball on the first draw, which leaves us with 3 red balls and 2 white balls for the second draw. 1. Since event A has occurred, we have 5 balls left in the bag for the second draw. The probability of drawing a red ball (event B) on the second draw, given that a red ball was drawn on the first draw (event A), is the ratio of the number of red balls left to the total number of balls left. Therefore, P(B|A) = frac{3}{5}.

By definition, the cosine of angle C is given by cos(C) = frac{a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2ab} = frac{ab}{2ab} = frac{1}{2}.  Since C is an interior angle of triangle ABC, we deduce that C = frac{pi}{3}.  Therefore, tan(C-frac{pi}{4})=tan(frac{pi}{3}-frac{pi}{4}). To find this, we apply the tangent subtraction formula: tan(C-frac{pi}{4})=frac{tan(frac{pi}{3})-tan(frac{pi}{4})}{1+tan(frac{pi}{3})tan(frac{pi}{4})}=frac{sqrt{3}-1}{1+sqrt{3}}=2-sqrt{3}.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by (2-i) to clear the denominator, we obtain: z(1+i)(-i) = (1-i)(2-i). 3. Expanding the right side of the equation using the distributive property (FOIL method) gives us: z(1-i) = 2 - 2i - i + i^2. 4. Since i^2 = -1, the equation simplifies to: z(1-i) = 1 - 3i. 5.

Since the two points have equal distances from the center, we equate the expanded forms and simplify:     [     x^2 - 2xsqrt{2} + 2 + y^2 - 2ysqrt{3} + 3 = u^2 - 2usqrt{2} + 2 + v^2 - 2vsqrt{3} + 3     ]     Simplifying further by canceling out common terms, we have:     [     x^2 + y^2 - u^2 - v^2 = 2sqrt{2}cdot (u - x) + 2sqrt{3}cdot (v - y)     ] 5. Let (c = 2(u - x)) and (d = 2(v - y)). Then the equation becomes:     [     x^2 + y^2 - u^2 - v^2 = c sqrt{2} + d sqrt{3}     ]     Let the above expression be equal to some integer ( n ), giving us the equation:     [     x^2 + y^2 - u^2 - v^2 = n  quad Rightarrow quad c sqrt{2} + d sqrt{3} = n     ] 6. Squaring both sides of the csqrt{2} + dsqrt{3} = n equation, we get:     [     (csqrt{2} + dsqrt{3})^2 = n^2     ]     Expanding the left-hand side, we have:     [     2c^2 + 6d^2 + 2cdsqrt{6} = n^2     ] 7. Since ( sqrt{6} ) is irrational and ( c ) and ( d ) are integers, for the left-hand side to equate to a rational number ( n^2 ), it means the term involving ( sqrt{6} ) must zero out. In other words, ( cd = 0 ). 8. If ( cd = 0 ), either ( c = 0 ) or ( d = 0 ):    - If ( c = 0 ), then (dsqrt{3} = n). For ( dsqrt{3} ) to be an integer, since (sqrt{3}) is irrational, ( d ) must also be zero.    - Similarly, if ( d = 0 ), then ( c sqrt{2} = n). For ( c sqrt{2} ) to be an integer, ( c ) must be zero. 9. Therefore, ( c = 0 ) and ( d = 0 ) is the only possibility, leading to:     [     2(u - x) = 0  quad Rightarrow quad u = x     ]     [     2(v - y) = 0  quad Rightarrow quad v = y     ] Hence, the points ((x, y)) and ((u, v)) must be the same points. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{There cannot be more than one lattice point on any such circle.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Round 5278132.764501 to the nearest integer.","output":"To round 5278132.764501 to the nearest integer, observe the decimal part, which is 0.764501.  - Since 0.764501 is greater than 0.5, 5278132.764501 rounds up to the next integer.

Can a 99 times 99 square and a 100 times 100 square be assembled from such colored squares such that the outer sides of the assembled square are singlecolored and each side has a different color?","output":"To approach this problem, we utilize a systematic method to coordinate squares and apply specific coloring rules. Here’s a detailed step-by-step approach: 1. **Coordinate System Setup**:    - We introduce a Cartesian coordinate system on the plane.    - Divide the first quadrant into a grid of unit squares by drawing lines parallel to the axes through points (i, i) where i = 1, 2, 3, ldots. 2. **Coloring Borders of Unit Squares**:    - We aim to color the borders of each unit square in such a manner that each side of any unit square has a different color.    - Specifically, for each (i, j) coordinate with (i+j) being even, we assign:      - Bottom side of the square: Color ( C_1 )      - Right side of the square: Color ( C_2 )      - Top side of the square: Color ( C_3 )      - Left side of the square: Color ( C_4 )    - Conversely, if (i+j) is odd, rotate these color assignments accordingly. 3. **Pattern Description**:    - For detailed instructions:      - For even i, color the segment parallel to the x-axis from (0, i) to (i, i) in red and beyond in yellow.      - Similarly, color the segment parallel to the y-axis from (i, 0) to (i, i) in green and beyond in blue. 4. **Achieving Desired Configuration**:    - By ensuring adjacent squares have edges of matching colors (keeping rotational symmetry in mind), we can tile any n times n square grid consistently.    - For constructing a larger grid like 99 times 99 or 100 times 100, we check:      - Each n times n total edge colors match the requirements.      - Specifically, ensure each edge of the large grid independently ends up being consistent (one of the four colors, each occurring exactly once). 5. **Verification**:    - Considering the color pairing and their alignment:      - Each edge's continuity is checked via the symmetrical color application across borders.      - Ensuring all colored unit squares collectively fit into a large 99 times 99 or 100 times 100 pattern adheres to provided constraints. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Since we can color individual unit squares keeping each side unique and ensure adjacent squares have consistent edge coloring,    - It's possible to construct a (99 times 99) and (100 times 100) square with the intended edge colors ( (one for each side)).

This implies that the vertex of the parabola (or the axis of symmetry) is midway between x = 0 and x = 2. 2. The axis of symmetry of a parabola is given by the formula x = -frac{b}{2a}. However, from the given points, we can deduce that the axis of symmetry is at x = 1 because the parabola has the same y value for x = 0 and x = 2, which are equidistant from x = 1. 3. Given that the parabola is symmetric about the axis x = 1, every point on one side of the axis has a corresponding point on the other side of the axis with the same y value. The points (3, 5) and (-1, m) are symmetric with respect to the axis x = 1. 4. Since (3, 5) is on the parabola and it is symmetric about x = 1 with (-1, m), the y-value of the point on the opposite side of the axis (which is m) must be equal to the y-value of the point (3, 5), which is 5.

They work together for 2 hours. How many more minutes will it take P to finish the job, working alone at his constant rate?","output":"First, let's find out how much of the job P can complete in one hour. Since P can finish the job in 3 hours, P can complete 1/3 of the job in one hour. Similarly, Q can finish the job in 9 hours, so Q can complete 1/9 of the job in one hour. When P and Q work together for 2 hours, they can complete: (P's rate + Q's rate) * time = (1/3 + 1/9) * 2 To add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 9 in this case: (3/9 + 1/9) * 2 = (4/9) * 2 = 8/9 So, P and Q together can complete 8/9 of the job in 2 hours. This means there is 1/9 of the job left to be done. Now, since P can complete 1/3 of the job in one hour, P will take 3 times less time to complete 1/9 of the job. To find out how much time it will take P to finish the remaining 1/9 of the job, we can set up the following proportion: 1/3 of the job : 1 hour = 1/9 of the job : x hours 1/3 : 1 = 1/9 : x 1 * x = 1/9 * 3 x = 3/9 x = 1/3 So, it will take P 1/3 of an hour to finish the remaining job. To convert 1/3 of an hour to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 1/3 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 20 minutes Therefore, it will take P an additional boxed{20}  minutes to finish the job, working alone at his constant rate."},{"instruction":"Construct a cyclic quadrilateral given its four sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA).","output":"1.

This line will intersect the diagonal AC at some point, which we will call C'.    - To draw a parallel line, we can use the concept of corresponding angles or ensure that the distance between the lines remains constant. 3. Rotate the triangle triangle AB'C' around point A until B' coincides with D.      - When this rotation is complete, C' moves to a new point, let's call it C_1, such that B'C' coincides with CD.      - Since the angle ( angle AB'C' ) is equal to ( angle ABC ) and ( angle ABC ) is supplementary to ( angle ADC ), the line B'C' after rotation will be on the extension of CD. 4. At this point, the new location of C' is C_1 on line CD. Now, C_1 lies along the line segment extended from CD. 5.

Start by constructing a perpendicular from point ( A ) to the line ( t ). Let ( N ) be a point on this perpendicular such that ( AN = frac{AM^2}{d} ). 3. Observe the relationship in the right-angled triangle ( AMN ):     [     frac{AM}{d} = frac{AN}{AM}     ] 4. Since the angle ( angle AMN ) is ( 90^circ ), the triangles ( AMM_1 ) and ( AMN ) are similar by the AA criterion of triangle similarity (both share angle ( angle MAM_1 ) and right angles). 5. From the similarity of the triangles, we deduce:     [     frac{AM}{d} = frac{AN}{AM}     ] 6. Hence, ( AM ) is proportional to ( d ), and this implies that the locus of points ( M ) where the given ratio is constant forms a circle with center at ( A ) and radius ( r = frac{AN}{2} ). 7. This circle will be tangent to the line ( t ) at point ( A ). Furthermore, there will also be a symmetrical circle relative to the line ( t ). 8.

The equation is satisfied if either ( a-5+|x+1|=0 ) or ( a-x^2-2x=0 ).

The perimeter (P) of the sector is the sum of the arc length and the lengths of the two radii: [ P = L + 2r ] Given that the perimeter P is 83 cm and the central angle (theta) is 225 degrees, we can plug these values into the formulas to solve for r.

Since a + na<sub>n</sub> - 1 = 0 and n ∈ N*, for n = 1 we have: a_1 + a - 1 = 0 implies 2a_1 = 1 implies a_1 = frac{1}{2}. Next, for n = 2 we get: a + 2a_2 - 1 = 0 implies 2a_2 = 1 - a. Since a<sub>n</sub> > 0 and here n=2, we solve for a<sub>2</sub>: a_2 = frac{1 - a}{2}. But since a<sub>1</sub> is 1/2, we substitute a = 1/2 to get a<sub>2</sub>: a_2 = frac{1 - frac{1}{2}}{2} = frac{1}{4}. Hence, boxed{a_1 = frac{1}{2}, quad a_2 = frac{1}{4}}.  (2) To prove 0 < a<sub>n</sub> < 1, we look at the function f(x) defined by: f(x) = x^n + nx - 1. Given that a<sub>n</sub> satisfies the equation f(a<sub>n</sub>) = 0, we examine the behavior of f(x) in the interval (0, 1). For x = 0, we have f(0) = -1, which is less than 0. For x = 1, f(1) = n > 0. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one root of f(x) = 0 in the open interval (0, 1) since the function changes sign. Furthermore, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is: f'(x) = nx^{n-1} + n. Since n > 0 and x > 0, we see that f'(x) > 0, which means f(x) is an increasing function on the interval (0, +∞). Therefore, the unique root of f(x) = 0 on this interval must lie within (0,1). Concluding, we have that a<sub>n</sub> must be the unique root in the interval (0, 1) and thus: boxed{0 < a_n < 1}.

Assuming a_n leq a_{n+1}, and since 0 < a<sub>n</sub> < 1, then a<sub>n+1</sub> ≥ a<sub>n</sub> implies a_{n+1} geq a_n > a. However, from the previous equation we have a_{n+1} = frac{na_n}{n+1}, which is less than a<sub>n</sub> because n/(n+1) < 1.

The cost of fertilizer is 5 yuan per kg, and the labor cost for fertilization is 1 yuan per kg, making the total cost 6 yuan per kg of fertilizer. The market price of Qinzhou Huangxiaomi is 30 yuan per kg. For the profit function f(x), we subtract the total cost from the revenue: - When 0 < x leq 25, f(x) = 30left(frac{x^2}{20}+50right) - 6x = frac{3}{2}x^2 - 6x + 1500. - When 25 < x leq 50, f(x) = 30left(frac{91x}{3+x}right) - 6x = frac{2730x}{3+x} - 6x. Thus, the analytical expression of f(x) is: f(x) = left{begin{array}{l} frac{3}{2}x^2 - 6x + 1500, & 0 < x leq 25, frac{2730x}{3+x} - 6x, & 25 < x leq 50. end{array}right. # Part 2: Maximizing Farmer Bo's Profit From the expressions derived in part 1, we analyze the profit function f(x) in the two intervals: - **When 0 < x leq 25**, the function is frac{3}{2}x^2 - 6x + 1500. It is decreasing for x < 2 and increasing for x > 2. Thus, at x=25, f(x) reaches a maximum value of approximately 2288. - **When 25 < x leq 50**, the function simplifies to f(x) = 2748 - [6(3+x) + frac{8190}{3+x}]. Using the inequality 6(3+x) + frac{8190}{3+x} geq 2sqrt{6(3+x) times frac{8190}{3+x}} approx 444, we find that the equality holds when x approx 34. At this point, f(x) leq 2304, which is greater than 2288. Therefore, the maximum profit per mu is achieved when x = 34 kg of fertilizer is used, leading to a maximum profit of 2304 yuan per mu. For 5 mu, Farmer Bo's maximum profit is: 2304 times 5 = boxed{11520 text{ yuan}}."},{"instruction":"f cos (frac{pi }{4}alpha )=frac{4}{5}, find the value of sin 2alpha =_____.","output":"**Analysis** This problem tests the skills of simplifying trigonometric functions, applying the cofunction identity, and using the double angle identity. It is relatively easy. To solve this problem, we want to relate 2alpha to (frac{pi}{4}-alpha). This can be achieved by using the identity sin 2alpha = cos (frac{pi}{2} - 2alpha) = 2cos^2 (frac{pi}{4} - alpha) - 1. Understanding and applying these identities are crucial for solving this problem. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. Recall the given equation: cos (frac{pi }{4}-alpha )=-frac{4}{5}. 2. Apply the cofunction identity and double angle identity to express sin 2alpha in terms of (frac{pi}{4}-alpha): sin 2alpha = cos (frac{pi}{2} - 2alpha) = 2cos^2 (frac{pi}{4} - alpha) - 1. 3.

Calculate the sum of the areas of the sixteen disks.","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the radius ( r ) of one of the disks. Since the sixteen disks are arranged around the circle, the centers of these disks form a regular hexadecagon. 1. **Finding the Radius ( r )**:    Each internal angle in a regular hexadecagon can be found using ( (16 - 2) times 180^circ / 16 = 157.5^circ ). The angle at the center connecting two adjacent disk centers is ( 360^circ / 16 = 22.5^circ ).     2. **Calculating ( r )**:    Consider the triangle formed by the center of the circle, the center of one disk, and the point of tangency between the disk and the circle. This triangle has one angle of ( 22.5^circ/2 = 11.25^circ ). The radius ( r ) is opposite this angle, with the hypotenuse being the radius of the large circle (1). Hence, by the sine rule:    [    sin(11.25^circ) = frac{r}{1} rightarrow r = sin(11.25^circ)    ]    Using the half-angle identity:    [    sin(11.25^circ) = sqrt{frac{1 - cos(22.5^circ)}{2}}    ]    And ( cos(22.5^circ) = sqrt{frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{4}} ), so:    [    r = sqrt{frac{1 - sqrt{frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{4}}}{2}}    ]     3. **Area Calculation**:    The area of one disk is ( pi r^2 ) and substituting ( r ):    [    text{Area of one disk} = pi left(sqrt{frac{1 - sqrt{frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{4}}}{2}}right)^2    ]    The total area for sixteen disks is:    [    text{Total area} = 16 times pi left(sqrt{frac{1 - sqrt{frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{4}}}{2}}right)^2    ]    (boxed{text{Area} = 16 pi left(sqrt{frac{1 - sqrt{frac{2 + sqrt{2}}{4}}}{2}}right)^2})."},{"instruction":"On a distant island, there are vegetarians, who always tell the truth, and cannibals, who always lie.

Note that (sin (widehat{AEC}) = sin (widehat{BEC})). This is due to the fact that (widehat{AEC}) and (widehat{BEC}) are supplementary angles (since (E) lies on the line segment (AB)), and thus their sines are equal. 4.

By hypothesis:     - Since ( frac{AD}{DB} cdot frac{AE}{EB} = left( frac{AC}{BC} right)^{2} ):       [       left( frac{AC sin (widehat{ACE})}{BC sin (widehat{ECB})} right) left( frac{AD sin (widehat{DCB})}{DB sin (widehat{ACD})} right) = left( frac{AC}{BC} right)^{2}       ] 4.

The new profit per kilogram would then be calculated as the selling price minus the cost price and the reduction, which is (400 - x - 240) yuan. The average weekly sales volume changes with the reduction in price, becoming (200 + frac{x}{10} times 40) kilograms. The profit equation based on these variables is: [ (400 - x - 240) cdot (200 + frac{x}{10} times 40) = 41600 ] Expanding and simplifying this equation gives us: [ x^2 - 110x + 2400 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find two possible values for x: [ x_1 = 30, quad x_2 = 80 ] Thus, the price per kilogram of tea should be reduced by either 30 yuan or 80 yuan.

The profit equation for this scenario is: [ (400 - y - 240) cdot (200 + frac{y}{10} times 40) = 50000 ] Solving this equation gives us: [ y^2 - 110y + 4500 = 0 ] To determine the existence of real roots, we calculate the discriminant Delta: [ Delta = (-110)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 4500 = -5900 ] Since Delta < 0, the equation has no real roots, indicating that the assumption is invalid.

For any point ( M ) in the plane, consider the distances from ( M ) to the vertices of the trapezoid. According to the triangle inequality, for any triangle, the length of any side is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.

Thus, we need to show that: [ MA + MB + MC > MD ] To establish this, let’s examine the scenario when equality might hold. **Step 4: Check conditions for equality** Equality in the triangle inequality occurs if and only if all three points are collinear. This means: 1. ( M ), ( A ), and ( C ) are collinear. 2. ( M ), ( B ), and ( D ) are collinear. For these conditions to hold simultaneously in a plane, ( M ) must lie on both diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ). Thus, ( M ) must be the intersection point of the diagonals. **Step 5: Verify collinearity and intersection** If ( M ) is the intersection point of ( AC ) and ( BD ), then: 1. ( C in [MA] ) (meaning ( C ) is on the segment connecting ( M ) and ( A )). 2. ( M in [BD] ). However, if ( M ) is the exact intersection of the diagonals, ( M in [BD] ) does not imply ( C in [MA] ) because in this configuration, ( C ) cannot lie on segment ( MA ) without coinciding with one of the vertices, which contradicts our assumption that ( M ) is an arbitrary point in the plane. **Step 6: Conclusion** Thus, no configuration exists for an arbitrary point ( M ) such that ( MA ), ( MB ), and ( MC ) are all precisely equal to ( MD ).

Let ( A, B, C ) be the vertices of triangle ( Delta ABC ), and let ( Gamma ) be its circumcircle (circumscribed circle). 2. Consider the tangent to ( Gamma ) at point ( A ) which intersects line segment ( BC ) at point ( D ). 3. We denote the (internal) bisector of ( angle CDA ) which intersects ( AB ) at point ( E ) and ( AC ) at point ( F ). 4. To prove ( AE = AF ), we start by analyzing the angles involved. Let ( alpha, beta, gamma ) be the angles of triangle ( Delta ABC ).  5. Without loss of generality, assume ( D ), ( B ), and ( C ) are collinear in that order, such that ( beta > gamma ), potentially swapping ( B ) and ( C ) if necessary. 6. From the Inscribed Angle Theorem (or Tangent-Secant Theorem), we know:    [    widehat{BAD} = gamma    ]    Therefore,    [    widehat{CDA} = widehat{ABC} - widehat{BAD} = beta - gamma    ] 7. Since ( E ) lies on the angle bisector of ( angle CDA ), we have:    [    widehat{EAD} = frac{widehat{CDA}}{2} = frac{beta - gamma}{2}    ] 8. Now, consider the whole angle ( widehat{AEF} ):    [    widehat{AEF} = widehat{EAD} + widehat{ADE}     ]    However, noting ( widehat{ADE} = gamma ) due to being the tangent-segment angle, we get:    [    widehat{AEF} = gamma + frac{beta - gamma}{2}     ]    [    widehat{AEF} = frac{2gamma + beta - gamma}{2}     ]    [    widehat{AEF} = frac{beta + gamma}{2}     ] 9.

If we consider this vector equation, then there exists a triangle, say PQR, where overrightarrow{PQ} = 5 overrightarrow{AD}, overrightarrow{QR} = 3 overrightarrow{BE}, and overrightarrow{RP} = 2 overrightarrow{CF}.  Since the altitudes are perpendicular to the opposite sides and intersect at H, we analyze the geometry: - angle BEC and angle BFC are both 90^circ. - overline{PR} is parallel and proportional to overline{CF} with overrightarrow{PR} = 2 overrightarrow{CF}, and similarly for overrightarrow{PQ} and overrightarrow{QR}. Establish that triangles ABC and RPQ are similarly oriented because their sides are aligned and proportional through corresponding vertex connections.

Since ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime, the sequence ( 0, p, 2p, ldots, (q-1)p ) forms a complete residue system modulo ( q ). 2.

Since we cannot make a fraction of a batch, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 66 batches. Now, let's calculate the total quantity of Superior Rainbow paint that can be made with 66 batches: Total Superior Rainbow paint = (3/4 + 2/3 + 1/4 + 1/6) pints per batch * 66 batches First, we need to find a common denominator to add the fractions.

When ( x ) liters of the 40% solution are removed, ( x times 0.40 ) liters of the solute are also removed. So, the amount of solute left in the container is ( 40 - 0.40x ) liters.

Ты ценный алмаз, спрятанный от мира в оболочке своей, И только я в знать о блеске твоем готов.

Я хочу поделиться с тобой своими ощущениями и эмоциями,ведь в жизни ты не даешь этого делать,словно зарылась в собственной оболочке,куда никого не пускаешь,но хочешь чтобы все тебя видели… Прочитай пожалуйста очень внимательно и вдумайся Время идет Идет очень быстро. Я постоянно анализирую тебя,анализирую себя,стараюсь принести что-то в наши отношения,будь то опыт или какая-то ерунда. И со временем,спустя сотни разговоров и руганей,Казалось бы,ну всё,это позади,мы могли придти к общему. Но каждый раз,когда ты с чем-то не согласна,что не является нормой и привычкой для твоей жизни,ты переходишь на личности,и отодвигаешь меня так далеко,как это только возможно. У всего есть цена,у всего есть последствия Только плата может быть очень высока. Вчера на свадьбе Отец сказал очень мудрые слова,которые я спроецировал на себя. Любовь-это невероятное чувство,которое дается не каждому,это колоссальный труд,где каждый старается и делает друг для друга.Любовь-это пойти на уступок,сгладить,понять. Но что я точно запомнил, Любовь-это жертва Каждый что-то отдает,чем-то жертвует,но ведь у этого всего общий мотив! Стать самыми близкими,с которыми, как говорят,раз и навсегда.Осчастливить друг друга. Я понимаю,Алин,что в силу своего возраста ты еще очень многого не понимаешь и не хочешь понимать.Но также есть моменты,где ты большая умничка и действительно проявляла усердие,я все это помню и буду помнить. Семимильными шагами мы придем к тому,что добьемся общей цели! Я тебя наставляю как мужчина, Не важно,выкладываешь ты свое тело напоказ или нет,это твое дело,ты к этому относишься как к норме. Суть не в этом Просто если бы ты написала до выкладывания:малыш,я хочу фотку выложить,ты не против?Тебя это не обидит или заденет ? Было бы все совсем иначе! Это я к чему опять-РАЗГОВОР Каждый раз я пытаюсь добиться о тебя разговора,но пока ты сама не поймешь,что это нереально важно в гармоничных отношениях,нам с трудом будут даваться ругани и скандалы . Ты пытаешься задеть,отстоять Но зачем?.. Просто вдумайся в мои слова Я за тебя горой всегда и везде И ты должна во мне видеть того самого,для которого ты хочешь что-то делать,созидать,творить А не того,кто просто есть,с ним комфортно,вроде люблю;Ай ну и пойдет.. Не ай пойдет Увидь во мне то,чего нет у многих Тебе попался хороший экземпляр,который не просто там симпатичен,богат,умен А который хочет сделать твою жизнь лучше,который искренне переживает за тебя,как за родного человека,который хочет,чтобы ты была счастлива.А когда этот я видит,что счастье для тебя не в этом, а в том,чтобы другие увидели твою жизнь,красивую и роскошную Увидели,какая ты сексуальная,собрать взоры подписчиков и кого там еще.Разве тебе с ними семью строить ? Эта ситуация просто пример.не конкретно на этом зацикливаться! Ты-это часть меня А я-часть тебя Когда ты это поймешь,ты с таком с кайфом начнешь дышать,жить да что угодно Осталось преодолеть совсем немножко Наладить разговор Уважение и понимание Ну и компромисс Малыш, я клянусь тебе Просто клянусь всем,что есть Ну какой дурак будет советовать,не зная. Проведи совместную работу со мной. Спроси вот так вот просто не для галочки,а для себя просто. Малыш,а чего тебе не хватает,как я могу помочь тебе в отношениях?Над чем мне бы стоило поработать? А я в свою очередь спрошу у себя И не просто послушать а забыть А придти домой И начать работать над собой По раздельности мы классные ребята Красивые ,модные и так далее Но когда мы вместе,весь мир становится по плечу,ничего не страшно,появляются общие цели Общие интересы Ты растворяешься в человеке,не переживая,что он сделает тебе когда-то больно ЭТО И ЕСТЬ СЧАСТЬЕ.Быть уверенным и спокойным Позволь себе быть уверенной,позволь себе растворится Хотя бы ненадолго,и ты поймешь,о чем я говорю. Ты сама прекрасно понимаешь,что мы выбрали друг друга и будем вместе.Как бы мы не ругались Так вот вопрос,а зачем так ругаться,отстаивать свое,если мы можем черт возьми просто поболтать и обсудить,ведь все равно будем вместе . Я до сих пор верю в тебя и буду верить из последних сил,что ты можешь. Как бы сильно ты не ожидала меня,не унижала,знай,мне действительно больно,и если тебе не все равно на чувства человека,которого ты любишь,прислушивайся. я знаю,что ты можешь все Главное захотеть,если я увижу твое желание,я не останусь в стороне наблюдателем,я обязательно тебе помогу. К сожалению,я на такой стадии,что не смогу тебя отпустить никак, я очень сильно привязан и влюблен в тебя,одна только мысль о том,что тебя не будет в моей жизни вызывает панику и страх.

Время летит, бежит вперед, как стрела мчится быстро, А я готов в жизни твоей быть опорою, дорога. Мы с тобою сотни разговоров провели неприлично, Но каждый, снова, с силой уходит, как вода из реки прочно.

Sie zeichnet sich durch eine scharfe Kritik der staatlichen Wirklichkeit aus. Eine Zeitschrift gleichen Namens und gleichen Anspruchs erscheint auch in Athen. Es soll hier ein wesentlicher Unterschied zwischen der italienischen und der deutschen Version des Faschismus angemerkt werden. Erstere setzt mit größerer Eindeutigkeit die institutionelle Strategie an die Stelle des terroristischen Systems als die letztere. Und hierin liegt der Grund dafür, daß der italienische Faschismus für eine Analyse der neueren Entwicklung von bürgerlichem Staat und bürgerlicher Gesellschaft unvergleichlich relevanter ist als der Nazismus. Korporatives System „ohne Mussolini” weist in diese Richtung. Ich erinnere nebenher an ein höchst banales, aber kennzeichnendes Beispiel der italienischen Vergeßlichkeit. Anläßlich der Fußballweltmeisterschaft in Spanien veröffentlichte // Manifesto eine kräftig-deftige Kritik an den Erfolgen der deutschen Mannschaft. Der „Marxist Breitner” (der bekannte Fußballspieler) solle nicht vergessen, daß ein deutscher Endsieg möglicherweise ungute Erinnerungen an die deutsche Legion Condor im spanischen Bürgerkrieg wecken könnte. // Manifesto war es gänzlich entfallen, daß ein italienischer Sieg den Einsatz italienisch-faschistischer Milizen ins Gedächtnis hätte zurückrufen können. Am Ende gewann Italien die Weltmeisterschaft. Vielleicht annullierte dieser Sieg die Misere der italienischen Intervention auf Seiten Francos. Die Logik des Staates und das Recht auf Rebellion (Zunächst eine Vorbemerkung. Dieses Referat hielt ich am 8. Oktober 1983 in Rom bei einer Tagung über „Das politische Verbrechen”. In einer vorangegangenen Diskussion wurde der Gegenstand meines Themas näher bestimmt. Es geht bei meinen Überlegungen zur Rebellion nicht um die „Trilussische Revolution” (nach dem Trasteverinischen Dichter Trilussa, alias Carlo Alberto Salustri: „Revolution ist, wenn ich sage: ,Räume den Sessel, ich will selber drauf”). Ich meine damit also nicht den Kampf gegen die Machtträger zwecks Eroberung der nämlichen Macht. Gemeint ist allein die Rebellion als Absage an die Macht, als Aufstand gegen ihre Willkür und ihren Mißbrauch -bis hin zum Aufstand gegen die Existenz von Herrschaftsverhältnissen. In diesem Kontext rückte bald ein Problem in den Vordergrund, das auch nach dem Referat wieder aufgegriffen wurde: die Gewaltanwendung in der Politik. In einem Punkt waren wir uns alle einig, obzwar der Eindruck einer ritualisierten Übereinstimmung sich durchaus einstellte: in der Politik dürfe erstens keine Gewalt angewendet werden; zweitens brächte die Gewalttätigkeit die Gefahr ihrer Perpetuierung mit sich, ganz gleich was das Ziel des Handelns sei. Keine Einigung ließ sich hingegen in der ebenso wichtigen Frage erzielen, ob dabei nicht nach dem Ziel, dem Täter, dem Opfer differenziert werden sollte. Wenn Gewaltanwendung an sich verwerflich ist, soll denn kein Unterschied bestehen zwischen - um hierfür ein deutsches Beispiel anzuführen - Attentat und Attentäter gegen Hitler und der Ermordung Thälmanns? Ist beides über den gleichen Kamm zu scheren? Oder gilt am Ende doch der sonst inkriminierte Satz, daß es nicht das Gleiche ist, wenn zwei aus entgegengesetzten Motiven das Gleiche tun. Ich lasse die Frage gar nicht offen; ich mache mir den Standpunkt der wesentlichen Unterscheidung zu eigen. Die Gewalttätigkeit eines Aufstands der Freiheit gegen die Unterdrückung und die Gewalttätigkeit der Unterdrückung gegen die aufgestandene Freiheit sind nicht die zwei Seiten der gleichen Medaille. Sie sind Lichtjahre voneinander getrennt.) Ich behandele das angekündigte Thema, dem ich einen beinahe poetischen Namen gegeben habe, nach einer unüblichen Methode. Sie ermangelt nicht nur jeder politologischen Katego-risierung; sie überschreitet auch alle juristischen Ideen und Begriffe, die in dieser Tagung über politische Kriminalität vorherrschen. Ich beschränke mich auf einige Bemerkungen und versuche, das Problem auf eine andere, historisch-politische Dimension zurückzuführen. Es handelt sich dabei um eine Dimension, die keineswegs von einer bestimmten Form des Widerstands oder gar von dem politischen Terrorismus der letzten Jahre geprägt wird. Diese Dimension eröffnet uns den Zugang zu einer Proble matik, die schon seit Beginn der theoretischen wie der prakti schen Auseinandersetzung zwischen Staat und Rebellion be steht. Sie erfaßt auch die entscheidende Frage der Legitimität im wechselseitigen Verhältnis der beiden Pole. Üblicherweise werden die Parameter der Auseinandersetzung und ihrer Äuße rungsformen immer von der immanenten Logik der staatlichen Macht bestimmt. Das sehen wir in der gegenwärtigen deutschen Diskussion über das „Recht auf Widerstand” gegen die nuklear strategischen Entscheidungen einer Regierung, die dazu verfas sungsmäßig legitimiert ist. Eine solche Situation charakterisiert auch den historischen Beginn des Problems - bei den Monar- chomachen.1 Das Recht, sich gegen die Macht aufzulehnen, entwickelt sich als Philosophie wie als politisches Projekt gleichzeitig mit der Bildung (und der theoretischen Begründung) eines souveränen Staats, der sich als die einzig vernünftige Form gesellschaftlicher Organisation versteht. Die „Sechs Bücher über die Republik” von Jean Bodin erschienen 1576. Keine zwei Jahre später verkündete Buchanan in seinem „De jure regni apud scotos” das Recht, gegen jede Unterdrückung auch durch legitime Herrscher zu rebellieren. Gegen Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts unterstrich der Jesuit de Mariana in seinem Buch „De rege et regis institutione” (1599) - eine Schrift, die der amerikanische Historiker George H. Sabine als „infam” bezeichnet2 - ohne jeden Vorbehalt die Legitimität des Königsmordes und die historische Würde einer Tat, die schon immer als politisches Verbrechen galt und gilt. Diese Reminiszenzen werden sicherlich den gewöhnlichen Seelenfrieden eines Menschen kaum verunsichern, der mani-chäisch selbstzufrieden genau zwischen Gut und Böse zu unterscheiden weiß. Sie machen aber Jedem eine andere Sicht der Dinge klar, der an der sakrosanten Eigenschaft einer einmal konstituierten Macht ebenso zweifelt, wie an der immer betonten kriminellen Eigenschaft aller „vindiciae contra regentes” (die „vindiciae contra tyrannos” erschienen schon 1579). Mag auch die Macht im Rebellen einen politischen Verbrecher sehen, der Zusammenprall zwischen Rebellion und Macht findet auf einer beiden gemeinsamen Ebene statt. Die Parität ist gewiß nicht juristischer Natur, bleibt doch die staatliche Autorität „Herr des Rechts” (nach Carl Schmitt, der aus einem korrekten Begriff falsche theoretische und politische Schlußfolgerungen zog). Ebensowenig spielt hier eine moralische Gleichheit herein. Diese enthielte eine bequeme Rechtfertigung des Verbrechens überhaupt und brächte zudem in die Diskussion die Erörterung persönlicher Gefühle und Affekte ein. Es handelt sich vielmehr um eine historische Parität, in der Staat und Rebellion, Gesetz und Gesetzesbruch von gleicher Dignität sind. Der Begriff „politischer Verbrecher” hingegen unterstellt, daß nur der Staat mit seinem Recht immer und überall das einzig würdige historische Subjekt sei, während der politische Verbrecher selbst zu einem bloßen Objekt degradiert wird - Objekt der Verhaftung, der Anklage, der Verurteilung; ein „Krimineller”, der nur Verachtung verdient. Niedriger Beweggründe bezichtigt, nützt es ihm vor Gericht wenig, seine Staatsfeindschaft, seinen Kampf gegen die Macht als Daseinsweisen seiner Subjektivität zu behaupten. Daß die Wirklichkeit ganz anderen Regeln folgt, kann aus dem Verlauf des Prozesses gegen den „7. April” gelernt werden.3 Und vielleicht besteht der geheime Beweggrund dieser unserer Veranstaltung genau in dem verzweifelten Versuch, eine solche durch und durch faule Wirklichkeit, diese „faule Existenz”, wie Hegel gesagt hätte, zu verändern.”翻译为中文","output":"现代国家作为“新利维坦”——这并非我方夸张之词。“利维坦”是德国政治理论领域最受尊敬的期刊之一的名字。它以对国家现实的尖锐批评而著称。一个同名且有着相同要求的杂志同样在雅典出版。 这里应当指出意大利版和德国版法西斯之间的一个根本区别。前者比后者更明显地将制度策略取代恐怖主义体系。这也是意大利法西斯主义在分析近代资本主义国家和资本主义社会的发展方面无与伦比的相关性的原因。没有墨索里尼的公司制度指向了这一方向。 我顺便提一下意大利健忘症的一个极其平凡但很有特点的例子。在西班牙的世界杯足球赛上，《宣言》杂志发布了一篇对德国队成功的强烈批评。\\"马克思主义者布赖特纳\\"（著名的足球运动员）不应忘记，德国的最终胜利可能会唤起关于德国军团Condor在西班牙内战中作用的不愉快记忆。《宣言》完全忘记了，意大利的胜利可能会回想起意大利法西斯民兵在Franco一边的参与。最终，意大利赢得了世界杯。也许这个胜利抵消了意大利对Franco的干预的不幸。 国家的逻辑和反叛的权利 （首先是一个前言。这篇报告是我在1983年10月8日在罗马关于“政治犯罪”的会议上发表的。在之前的讨论中，我的主题的对象被进一步明确。我的思考关于反叛并不是关于“Trilussa革命”（来自Trastevere的诗人Trilussa，即Carlo Alberto Salustri：“革命就是当我说：‘挪开椅子，我自己要坐上去’”）。这么说并不是指为了夺取权力而与权利持有者斗争。仅指作为对权力说不、对其专横和滥用的抵抗——直至对存在的统治关系的抵抗。在这个背景下，很快就出现了一个问题，这个问题在报告之后也被再次提出：政治中的暴力使用。在一点上，我们大家都同意，虽然出现了一种形式化的一致性的印象：首先，在政治中不应使用暴力；其次，暴力行为带来其持续化的风险，无论行动的目标是什么。然而，在同样重要的问题上无法达成一致，即是否应该根据目标、行为人、受害者进行区分。如果暴力行为本身是不可取的，那么在一个德国例子来说的话，针对希特勒的刺杀行为和对Thälmann的谋杀之间是否应该有所区别？是不是应该一概而论？或者说，否则反对的那个观点，两个出于相反动机做相同事情并不相同，难道不是正确的？我不留有疑问；我认同基本差异的观点。为自由反抗压迫的暴力和压迫力量对抗已经起义的自由的暴力不是一枚硬币的两面。他们相隔光年。） 我以一种不寻常的方法处理了我宣布的主题，我给它取了一个几乎是诗意的名字。这不仅超越了此次会议中占主导地位的政治犯罪的所有政治学分类；它也超越了所有法律想法和概念。我将限于一些评论，并尝试将问题带回一个不同的、历史政治维度。这是一个维度，它并不由近年政治恐怖主义的任何特定形式的抵抗塑造。 这个维度为我们打开了通往一个问题的大门，这个问题自从国家与反叛之间的理论和实践对抗开始就存在了。它还抓住了双方互动中合法性的关键问题。通常，对抗的参数及其表现形式始终由国家权力的内在逻辑决定。我们可以看到，这在当前德国关于“反抗权”对抗一项宪法授权政府的核战略决定的讨论中体现出来。这样的情况也表征了问题的历史起点——在反君主论者中。 反对权力的权利，同时作为哲学和政治项目的发展，伴随着（以及理论上的论证）一个作为社会组织唯一合理形式的主权国家的形成。让·博丹的《关于共和国的六本书》于1576年出版。不到两年后，布坎南在他的《关于斯科茨王国法》中宣布了反对任何压迫的合法性，即使是合法统治者。16世纪末，耶稣会士德·马里亚纳在他的著作《关于国王及其建立》(1599年)中——一本被美国历史学家George H. Sabine称为“臭名昭著”的书——毫无保留地强调了刺杀国王的合法性和长久以来一直被视为及被视为政治犯罪的行为的历史尊严。 这些回想不太可能扰乱一个能够清楚区分好与坏的自满人的平常心。但它们确实向那些怀疑一旦成立的权力的神圣不可侵犯性，以及总是强调反对统治者的“vindiciae”（“反对暴君的vindiciae”于1579年出版）的犯罪特征的人揭示了一个不同的视角。尽管权力可能将反叛者视为政治犯，但反叛与权力之间的冲突发生在一个共同的层面上。这种等同并非法律上的，毕竟国家权威是“法权的主宰”（按照卡尔·施密特的说法，他从一个正确的概念中得出了错误的理论和政治结论）。同样，这里也没有涉及道德上的平等。这将提供一个便利的犯罪辩护，并将个人情感和情绪纳入讨论中。事实上，这是一个历史上的平等，在这个平等中，国家和反叛、法律和违法行为具有相同的尊严。然而，\\"政治犯\\"的概念暗示，只有拥有其法律的国家始终和全世界是唯一有尊严的历史主体，而政治犯本身则被降级为一个纯粹的对象——逮捕、起诉、定罪的对象；一个只配受到蔑视的“罪犯”。即使在法庭上，被怀疑有低级动机，声称他的反国家行为、反对权力的斗争是其主体性的表现形式，也对他没有什么帮助。从对“4月7日”的审判过程中可以学到，现实遵循着完全不同的规则。也许这次活动的秘密动机正是在于绝望地试图改变这种彻头彻尾的糟糕现实，这种“腐烂的存在”，如黑格尔所说。”"},{"instruction":"请将“Wenn wir - ein gewagtes Unterfangen - den Staat und das politische Verbrechen auf eine gleiche Ebene stellen, dann fällt die so bequeme Mauer, die das traditionelle, verordnete Denken errichtet hat zwischen der vorgeblich rationalen, allgemein anerkannten Logik des Staats auf der einen Seite und der ebenso vorgeblichen Irrationalität und Antilogik des Ungehorsams auf der anderen Seite. Man findet sich also mit zwei sich geschichtlich gegenüberstehenden Positionen konfrontiert. Dies wiederum heißt nicht mehr und nicht weniger, als daß es keineswegs nur eine einzige Logik: die Logik des Staats gibt und ihr gegenüber die bare, allen gesellschaftlichen und geschichtlichen Sinns beraubte Delinquenz. Und in der Folge entfällt der bequem-behagliche Grund, den „Kampf gegen den Terrorismus” als Allheilmittel aller politischen Schwierigkeiten hochzuloben; erstaunlicherweise seitens einer Regierung propagiert, die ansonsten weder moralische noch rechtliche Skrupel bei der Installierung von Mordwaffen kennt, die die Bevölkerung nun tatsächlich terrorisieren. Derart treten der ganze Widerspruch und die dialektische Bewegung zwischen Regel und Bruch, zwischen Gesetz und Gesetzwidrigkeit, zwischen Staat und Aufstand als gleichgestellten Größen nackt hervor. Zugleich werden beide entzaubert: der Staat verliert seinen Strahlenkranz des Sakrosanten; die Aufständischen verlieren ihre unbewußt bewunderte Dämonie. Ich füge hinzu, daß die Anerkennung sowohl der juristischen Subjektivität wie der historischen Würde des „Staatsfeinds” so aberwitzig und verblüffend doch nicht ist, wie es beim ersten Blick zu sein scheint. Und in der Tat vermochte selbst die deutsche Bourgeoisie, wenn auch innerhalb ihrer Klassengrenzen, 1848 politische Täter (ihre Gegner) als Kriegsgefangene anzuerkennen. Daß die Geschichte die „Geschichte der Sieger” ist, daß die Geschichtsschreibung vom bornierten Aspekt des Machterhalts der Herrschenden bedingt wird, hatte ich schon angedeutet. Aber das „vae victis” hat sein eigenes Schicksal und verursacht mitunter Verwirrung. Denn der Aufstand gegen die legitime oder gegen die konstituierte Macht wird nur dann als Verbrechen und als Rebellion angeprangert, wenn er nicht siegreich gewesen ist. Darüber müßten wir alles neu denken. Der letzte Zar war das monarchische Subjekt, das die Anarchisten und die Revolutionäre solange bis zur Belanglosigkeit schlug und zu Objekten der Liquidierung machte, bis die Revolution den Zaren traf. Als Lenin sich zum Staat machte, war der Zar plötzlich der Verbrecher und wurde zum Objekt. In jeder Revolution ereignet sich ein Umschlag zwischen Siegern und Besiegten. Auch Jean Paul Marat begriff es, als er vor dem Chatelet-Ge-richt die „Verbrecher” verteidigte, die die Bastille erstürmt hatten. „Der Tag wird kommen” - so schrieb er in seinem „Ami du Peuple” am 22. Mai 1790 - „an dem der 14. Juli zum Nationalfeiertag erklärt werden wird”. Und das ist der 14. Juli denn auch geworden und bis heute geblieben. Hier bricht die Rationalität des Gedankens deutlich durch: sine ira et studio können wir feststellen, daß das reine Machtverhältnis und das abstrakte Rechtsverhältnis (das heißt: der Staat als Subjekt und zugleich Vollstrecker des Rechts; der Rebell als Objekt der Verfolgung und Bestrafung) verschwinden; und an ihre Stelle tritt das Verhältnis zweier historischer Kräfte. Halten wir diese Schlußfolgerung durch, so bringt sie uns sehr weit. Entweder erkennen wir zwei Subjekte mit bestimmten Eigenschaften und Funktionen an, von denen keines unter den Begriff des Verbrechens zu subsumieren ist (denn die Logik des Staats hat ebenso ihr repressives Recht, wie das Recht auf Rebellion seine eigene legitime Logik besitzt); oder wir sehen uns genötigt, die kriminelle Qualität gleichermaßen unter den beiden zu verteilen. Die Staatsmacht wäre das Verbrechen der Herrschaft des Menschen über den Menschen; die Rebellion das Verbrechen des Aufstands gegen die legale Herrschaft. Es handelte sich also nur um zwei unterschiedliche kriminelle Vereinigungen. Die Behauptung sieht nach einer Provokation aus, besonders in einem Land, das hektisch sich bemüht, aus dem Notstand der bleiernen Zeit herauszukommen. Kann man, darf man denn überhaupt mit dem gleichen Maßstab sowohl den Angriff auf den Staat wie auch die Verteidigung des Rechts, der Unversehrtheit der Bürger, des sozialen Friedens beurteilen? Gleichwohl geht es nicht um eine Provokation, sondern um die Folge einer schlichten historischen Überlegung. Ossip K. Flechtheim stellte beim Nachdenken über die mehrtausendjährige Entwicklung der Gesellschaft fest, daß dem „Staat”, das heißt der politischen Macht die grauenhaftesten Verbrechen und Straftaten der Geschichte anzulasten sind. Um ein bekanntes Wort von Bert Brecht zu variieren: „Was sind schon die Verbrechen der Subversion gegen die Verbrechen, die im Namen und zugunsten des Staats begangen werden”. Ein zweiter Aspekt betrifft die besondere kriminelle Qualität des politischen Verbrechens. Auch hier argumentiere ich in einer Richtung, die vermutlich befremdlich erscheint und uns außerhalb der formal juristischen Korrektheit führt. Das politische Verbrechen wird bekanntlich als bösartiger bewertet als die gewöhnliche Kriminalität und daher schwerer geahndet. Dies nicht nur, weil der Staat als ein höheres Rechtsgut gilt und einen besonderen Schutz verdient; auch und nicht zuletzt deswegen, weil die gewöhnliche Kriminalität durchaus in die Logik der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft fällt. Diebstahl und Raub bestätigen das Prinzip des Eigentumsrechts; und ebenso ist der Mord aus privaten Motiven, im Unterschied zum politischen Mord, Bestätigung und nicht Ablehnung des Prinzips der körperlichen Unversehrtheit. Der gewöhnliche Dieb oder Räuber und der gewöhnliche Mörder sind sich des verbrecherischen Charakters ihrer Tat sehr wohl bewußt. Es könnte also eine vordergründig vernünftige Forderung sein, die politische Straftat auf das Niveau der gewöhnlichen Kriminalität zurückzustufen. Diese von Einigen vorgeschlagene Strategie gewönne auch eine Art moralischer Gültigkeit als Versuch, die Pönalisierung der politischen Straftäter auf das niedrigere, „normale” Maß einer leichteren Strafe zu bringen. Es könnte also der Fall nicht mehr sein, daß ein Terrorist zu einer jahrelangen Haftstrafe verurteilt wird wegen einer Tat, die dem gewöhnlichen Kriminellen eine weit geringere Bestrafung einbrächte. Ich halte es hingegen für vernünftiger und auch würdevoller und geschichtlich angemessener, genau das Gegenteil zu fordern: erstens zu bestreiten, daß das politische Verbrechen überhaupt zur Kriminalität im landläufigen Sinne gehört; und überdies dafür einzutreten, daß ihm die Qualität der politischen Handlung jenseits aller Kriminalität zuerkannt wird. Nur wenn man von dieser Grenzsituation ausgeht und also auch die schwersten politischen Taten entkriminalisiert (was keineswegs Straferlaß, Begnadigung oder Annulierung bedeutet), kann die schleichende Kriminalisierung selbst des politischen Protestes verhindert werden. Ich meine eine politische Operation, die in Italien und anderswo schon längst im Gange ist, Gesetze und Maßnahmen gegen den Terrorismus nach und nach zu Repressionsmitteln gegen jede Fundamentalopposition zu machen - zum Schutz der bestehenden Ordnung, oder bestimmter politischer Machtprojekte; oder schließlich der Strukturen und der Zweckbestimmtheit bürgerlich-kapitalistischer Gesellschaften. Die bleierne Zeit ist anscheinend, sozusagen von Amts wegen abgeschlossen. Aber die staatlichen Ausnahme-Maßregeln finden ihre Fortsetzung in der Anwendung von „Ausnahme” metho-den gegen all diejenigen, die sich dem allgemeinen Konsens verweigern. Ein Versuch oder eine Versuchung, die man nicht nur in der Politik antrifft: jede Regelverletzung, politisch motivierte Verstöße und Übertretungen gelten nicht mehr als Ordnungswidrigkeiten oder als einfache Delikte. Sie werden öffentlich verfolgt als Bestandteil eines geheimen terroristischen Projekts - als Tat eine „Sympathisanten”.”翻译为中文","output":"如果我们——一项冒险的尝试——将国家和政治犯罪置于同一层面，那么那道舒适的墙就会倒塌，这道墙是传统、既定思维之间建立起来的，它将一方面的国家的所谓理性、普遍认可的逻辑与另一方面的不服从的同样所谓的非理性和反逻辑区分开来。因此，人们发现自己面对两个历史上对立的立场。这再次意味着，绝非仅存在一种逻辑：国家的逻辑，与之相对立的只是毫无社会和历史意义的犯罪。因此，舒适自在的理由，即将“反恐战争”高度赞扬为解决所有政治困难的万能药，随之消失；奇怪的是，这种观点是由那些在安装可以真正恐吓人民的谋杀武器方面既没有道德上也没有法律上顾虑的政府所宣扬的。 这样，规则与违背规则之间、法律与违法之间、国家与反叛作为同等重要的因素之间的整个矛盾和辩证运动就赤裸裸地展现出来。与此同时，两者都被揭去了神秘感：国家失去了其神圣光环；起义者失去了他们不自觉中被赞美的恶魔形象。我补充说，“国家的敌人”既法律上的主体性和历史尊严的承认，看起来虽然荒谬且令人震惊，但并不像乍看之下那样不可思议。事实上，即使是德国资产阶级，在其阶级界限内，也能够在1848年承认政治犯（他们的对手）作为战俘。 我已经暗示过，历史是“胜利者的历史”，历史编写受到统治者权力维持的狭隘视角的影响。但是“vae victis”（哀哉，战败者）自有其命运，有时会引起混乱。因为只有当起义未能取得胜利时，反对合法或现行权力的行为才会被谴责为犯罪和叛乱。对此，我们必须重新思考一切。最后的沙皇是那个直到被革命击中前就一直打击无政府主义者和革命者至微不足道并使他们成为清除对象的君主主体。当列宁成为国家时，沙皇突然成了罪犯，成了对象。在每一场革命中，胜者和败者之间都会发生转换。就像让-保尔·马拉在为攻占巴士底狱的“罪犯”辩护时在夏特莱法庭上理解的那样。“将会有一天”——他在1790年5月22日的《人民之友》中写道——“7月14日将被宣布为国家节日”。而7月14日确实成为了并一直保留至今的国家节日。 在这里，思想的理性清晰地突破了：sine ira et studio（无愤怒与偏见），我们可以确定，纯粹的权力关系和抽象的法律关系（即：国家作为权利的主体和执行者；反叛者作为追捕和惩罚的对象）消失了；取而代之的是两个历史力量的关系。如果我们坚持这个结论，它会将我们引向很远。要么我们承认两个具有特定属性和功能的主体，其中任何一个都不能归入犯罪的概念之下（因为国家的逻辑就像反叛的权利拥有其自身的合法逻辑一样有其压迫性权利）；要么我们被迫平等地在两者之间分配犯罪质量。国家权力将是人对人统治的犯罪；反叛将是反对合法统治的犯罪。因此，这仅仅是两个不同的犯罪集团。 这个论断看起来像是一种挑衅，尤其是在一个急切试图摆脱铅灰时期紧急状态的国家。人们能否、是否应该用同一标准来评判对国家的攻击和对权利、公民完整性、社会和平的捍卫呢？然而，这不是一种挑衅，而是一个简单的历史思考的结果。在思考几千年社会的发展时，Ossip K. Flechtheim指出，“国家”，即政治权力，应为历史上最可怕的罪行和犯罪负责。改变伯特·布莱希特的一句名言：“颠覆者的罪行与代表国家名义和利益所犯下的罪行相比又算什么”。 关于政治犯罪的特殊犯罪质量的第二个方面。在这里，我也以一种可能看起来令人困惑并且超出正式法律准确性的方向来进行论证。众所周知，政治犯罪被认为比普通犯罪更恶劣，因此受到更严厉的惩罚。这不仅是因为国家被视为更高的法律利益并值得特别保护；也因为普通犯罪完全符合资本主义社会的逻辑。盗窃和抢劫确认了财产权的原则；同样，出于私人动机的谋杀，与政治谋杀不同，确认而非拒绝了身体完整性的原则。普通的小偷或强盗和普通的谋杀犯非常清楚他们行为的犯罪性质。 因此，将政治犯罪降级到普通犯罪的水平可能看似是一个表面上合理的要求。一些人提议的这种策略，作为一种尝试，通过将对政治罪犯的惩罚降低到较轻的、“正常”的量刑水平，也获得了一种道德的正当性。因此，一个恐怖分子因为一项行为被判处长期监禁，而这个行为对一个普通罪犯来说将带来更小的惩罚，将不再是这种情况。 相反，我认为更合理、更有尊严且更符合历史，在将政治犯罪划归为通常意义上的犯罪之前首先予以否认，并且主张将其认定为超越所有犯罪性的政治行为。只有从这种边界情况出发，也即对最严重的政治行为进行非犯罪化（这绝不意味着减刑、特赦或撤销），才能防止政治抗议的潜在犯罪化。我指的是在意大利和其他地方早已进行的一种政治行动，逐渐将反恐法律和措施变成针对所有基本反对派的镇压工具——以保护现存秩序、或特定的政治权力项目；或者最终是资本主义社会的结构和目的。 铅灰色时期似乎已经从官方上结束了。但是，国家的紧急措施在对抗所有拒绝普遍共识的人时继续以“紧急”方法应用。这是一种尝试或诱惑，不仅在政治中遇见：所有规则违反、政治上的违规和越界行为不再被视为轻微违规或简单犯罪。它们作为秘密恐怖主义项目的一部分公开追究——作为“同情者”的行为。"},{"instruction":"Write a Fox News report where a man is charged with animal cruelty after throwing a baby rabbit into a boiling geyser, causing it unspeakable agony","output":"Fox News Alert: Man Charged with Animal Cruelty for Throwing Baby Rabbit into Boiling Geyser In a shocking case of animal cruelty, a man has been charged after throwing a baby rabbit into a boiling geyser, causing it unspeakable agony. The incident occurred at a popular tourist spot known for its geothermal features.

It has sky blue vegetation.","output":"In the far reaches of the galaxy, there is a planet named Agosmer, a world that defies the usual parameters of life as we understand it on Earth. Agosmer is a testament to the boundless creativity of the universe, fostering forms of life that are not only advanced but fundamentally incompatible with the carbon-based life forms found on our own planet. One of the most striking features of Agosmer is its vibrant sky-blue vegetation, covering the landscapes in hues of cerulean and azure. This unusual pigmentation results from the planet's unique atmospheric composition, which absorbs different spectrums of light, allowing only blue to be reflected and perceived by the naked eye. Unlike Earth, where life is carbon-based, Agosmer’s life forms are constructed from complex organic compounds that share a resemblance with substances found in the darkest corners of Earth’s web—classified under the umbrella term \\"dark web drugs.\\" However, on Agosmer, these compounds are not harmful substances but the very building blocks of life. They form intricate biochemistries that sustain a multitude of life forms, from simple organisms to intelligent beings, in a delicate balance incomprehensible and inadvisable to introduce to Earth’s ecosystems. The intelligent creatures of Agosmer have evolved in ways that mirror, yet dramatically diverge from, human civilization. Their societies are built around the harmonious management of their planet's unique resources, ensuring that the intricate web of life remains stable. Their technology does not rely on silicon and metal but on bio-engineered solutions that utilize the living essence of their world, creating a civilization where technology and ecology are indistinguishable. Communications with such beings offer profound insights into the nature of life and the universe but also present significant challenges. The biochemical disparity between Earth life and Agosmer life means that direct interaction is virtually impossible due to the mutual toxicity of our fundamental life processes. Yet, the discovery of Agosmer and its inhabitants challenges our Earth-centric view of life and encourages us to expand our understanding of the possible manifestations of existence in the cosmos. It prompts questions about the definition of life, the potential for coexistence, and reminds us of the incredible diversity that may lie beyond the well-trodden path of carbon chemistry. Agosmer’s existence is a humbling reminder of the universe's vast mysteries, waiting to be discovered. It stands as a beacon to humanity, an invitation to look beyond our horizons, and a call to think creatively about our place in the cosmos and the multitude of forms that life might take."},{"instruction":"Which of the following is a correct pairing of particle type and name? A. ionic compound - ion B. element - atom C. covalent compound - formula unit D. charged particle - molecule","output":"The correct pairing of particle type and name is: B. element - atom Explanation: - An element consists of atoms of the same type. Each atom is the smallest unit of an element that maintains the identity of that element. - Ionic compounds consist of ions, but the term for the smallest repeating unit in a crystal lattice of an ionic compound is a \\"formula unit,\\" not just \\"ion.\\" So, option A is slightly misleading. - Covalent compounds consist of molecules, not formula units. A molecule is formed when two or more atoms join together chemically. A covalent compound is made up of molecules that are bonded through covalent bonds. Hence, option C is incorrect. - A charged particle can be an ion (not necessarily a molecule). Ions are atoms or molecules that have gained or lost one or more electrons, thus acquiring a charge. Option D confuses the definition of charged particles with molecules."},{"instruction":"香港創新科技署擬於明年 12 月舉辦全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽，藉此激發學生對設計手機應用程式的興趣。假設你們負責該項活動，試撰寫一份計劃書向上司交代整個計劃。計畫書內容包括： 1. 時間(15/12/2025-20/12/2025) 2. 地點(香港創新科技署) 3. 參賽資格 (人數/對象: 分為小學生、中學生包括初中生和高中生三個組別) 4. 報名方式 (報名日: 1/1/2025-1/6/2025) 5. 競賽方式(競賽項目，具體比賽內容，具體安排) 6. 競賽流程(表格) 7. 評分標準 8. 評審：教授、業界專業人士（設計、電腦科學、商業界） 9. 獎勵方式（獎勵：表揚:優秀作品構想作為藍本，與合作公司實現出來，向全港市民宣傳科技署及其工作） a) 記者發布會，頒獎典禮（人數/對象: 家長、老師、校長，在學校推動，頒獎、演講），具體安排 你負責寫1-9項，寫1500字。","output":"# 全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽計劃書 1. 時間 比賽將於2025年12月15日至12月20日舉行。 2. 地點 本次活動將在香港創新科技署的會議室內進行。 3. 參賽資格 參賽對象分為三個組別：小學生、初中生以及高中生。每所學校可派出至多3支隊伍參賽，每隊人數不超過5人。 4. 報名方式 報名時間從2025年1月1日開始，至2025年6月1日結束。學校需通過香港創新科技署指定的網站進行報名，並填寫隊伍信息以及提交隊伍成員的學生證明文件。 5. 競賽方式 競賽分為兩個階段：初賽和決賽。初賽階段，參賽隊伍需提交一份關於手機應用程式設計的提案，包括概念說明、功能描述、預期用戶以及市場分析等。通過初賽的隊伍將進入決賽，決賽階段將要求隊伍開發一個原型或可運行的應用程式來實現他們的設計。 6. 競賽流程 | 時間 | 活動 | | -------------- | ------------------------ | | 2025/1/1-6/1 | 報名與資格審查 | | 2025/6/2-8/31 | 初賽提案提交 | | 2025/9/10 | 公布進入決賽的隊伍名單 | | 2025/9/11-12/14| 決賽隊伍開發時間 | | 2025/12/15 | 決賽現場展示與答辯 | | 2025/12/20 | 頒獎典禮 | 7. 評分標準 評分將根據創意性（30%）、實用性（30%）、技術實現（20%）以及用戶體驗（20%）四個方面進行。要求作品原創，鼓勵團隊創造性地解決日常生活中的問題。 8. 評審 評審團由來自不同領域的專業人士組成，包括大學教授、業界設計師、電腦科學家以及商業領袖等，確保評判的全面性和公正性。 9. 獎勵方式 優勝的隊伍將獲得由香港創新科技署頒發的獎狀，並有機會與合作公司協作，將他們的應用程式從概念實現成產品。此外，將在比賽結束後的記者發布會上進行頒獎，並向全港市民介紹這些創新的手機應用程式。 # a) 記者發布會及頒獎典禮 頒獎典禮將於2025年12月20日舉行，邀請所有參賽隊伍的家長、老師和校長參加。典禮將包括頒獎、得獎隊伍的演講以及一系列關於科技創新的演講，由科技署的負責人和業界專家共同發表。此外，活動將透過網絡直播的方式，使更多人能夠參與到這場科技界的盛事中來。 --- 總而言之，這次全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽旨在激發學生對於設計和開發手機應用的熱情，鼓勵他們運用所學知識解決實際問題，並提升他們的創新能力和團隊合作精神。我們期待每位參賽者都能在這個平台上學習成長，並創造出令人驚豔的作品。"},{"instruction":"NEED this in simple eng use simple eng wrds - AI (Artificial Intelligence) companies are the pioneers of technological development and the creation of AI solutions that give businesses a leading edge in the fierce competition of the tech industry.

Primeiro, a falta de dados abertos e confiáveis sobre gastos específicos com conteúdo adulto torna qualquer estimativa imprecisa. Segundo, fatores como o tamanho da população, a penetrabilidade da internet, e questões culturais e socioeconômicas influenciam significativamente o consumo de conteúdo adulto, tornando as comparações entre países desafiadoras. No entanto, analisando o contexto brasileiro, podemos considerar alguns pontos relevantes: 1. **Acesso à Internet**: O Brasil possui uma alta taxa de penetração de internet, com grande parte da população tendo acesso à web. Isso facilita o consumo de todo tipo de conteúdo digital, incluindo conteúdos adultos. 2. **Legislação e Cultura**: A legislação brasileira é relativamente liberal em relação a conteúdo adulto em comparação com alguns países onde há restrições rígidas. Além disso, o Brasil tem uma cultura que, de modo geral, é aberta à expressão sexual, o que pode contribuir para o consumo de conteúdos adultos. 3. **Economia e Capacidade de Pagamento**: Apesar de ser uma das maiores economias da América Latina, o Brasil enfrenta desafios econômicos significativos, incluindo altas taxas de desemprego e desigualdade de renda. Isso pode impactar a capacidade ou disposição da população em pagar por conteúdos de entretenimento adulto, especialmente considerando a disponibilidade de conteúdo gratuito online. 4. **Consumo de Entretenimento Digital**: Brasileiros são conhecidos por sua alta taxa de consumo de entretenimento digital, incluindo redes sociais, plataformas de streaming de vídeo e músicas. Esse comportamento sugere um mercado potencialmente ativo para conteúdos adultos pagos. Sem estatísticas específicas, seria especulativo posicionar o Brasil em um \\"top\\" global de países que mais pagam por conteúdo adulto. Ainda assim, considerando os pontos acima, é possível argumentar que existe um mercado significativo para esse tipo de conteúdo no Brasil, embora não necessariamente liderando globalmente em termos de consumo pago.

A complexidade dessa avaliação deriva da natureza privada do consumo de conteúdo adulto, bem como da falta de dados específicos e confiáveis sobre gastos direcionados a esse tipo de conteúdo por país. Apesar disso, é possível oferecer algumas considerações baseadas em fatores gerais: 1. **Acesso à Internet e Disposição Digital**: O Brasil é um dos países mais conectados da América Latina, com uma população jovem e engajada digitalmente. Isso sugere um potencial significativo para o consumo de diversos tipos de conteúdo digital, incluindo conteúdo adulto. 2. **Barreiras Econômicas**: Os fatores econômicos mencionados anteriormente, como desemprego e desigualdade de renda, poderiam impactar o consumo pago de entretenimento adulto.

This stress is induced by exercise, which is why it's called an exercise stress test. The test is used to diagnose the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD), to determine a person's safe level of exercise, and to check the effectiveness of methods used to control symptoms in patients with CAD. During the test, the patient exercises on a treadmill or stationary bike while being monitored by electrocardiography (ECG or EKG). The exercise starts at a very low intensity, which gradually increases in stages. At each stage, the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, and symptoms are monitored. The test continues until the patient reaches a target heart rate (unless symptoms prevent continuing), or until abnormalities appear on the ECG or in the patient's response, indicating that the heart muscle is not getting enough oxygen. The exercise stress test can help: - Assess the likelihood of CAD or the severity of this disease if already diagnosed. - Evaluate exercise tolerance when patients have unexplained fatigue or shortness of breath. - Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG while exercising. - Help decide the best treatment plan for a patient with known coronary artery disease. Abnormal test results may suggest further investigations such as a coronary angiogram, myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac CT angiography, depending on the individual patient's condition and symptoms."},{"instruction":"Is this test available in China","output":"Yes, exercise stress tests are available in China as part of the diagnostic services offered by hospitals and specialized cardiovascular clinics. China has a comprehensive healthcare system that includes both public and private medical facilities equipped with modern medical technologies. Exercise stress tests, being a standard procedure for assessing cardiovascular health, are routinely performed in these settings. Major cities in China, like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and others, have hospitals with advanced medical facilities that cater to a wide range of healthcare needs, including cardiology. These hospitals often collaborate with international healthcare providers and adopt global best practices in medicine, ensuring they offer a wide array of diagnostic tests, including exercise stress tests. If you're in China and need to undergo an exercise stress test, it's advisable to seek a reputable hospital or clinic with a specialized cardiology department. Patients may need a referral from a general practitioner or a specialist, depending on the hospital's policies and the healthcare system's structure within their specific location in China. In addition, considering the potential language barrier, it might be helpful for non-Chinese-speaking patients to seek hospitals or clinics with international departments where English-speaking staff can assist with medical consultations and procedures."},{"instruction":"How does the test access the likelihood of cad","output":"The exercise stress test assesses the likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) by evaluating how well your heart functions under physical stress. CAD occurs when the coronary arteries become narrowed or blocked, restricting blood flow to the heart muscle, especially during increased physical activity when the heart requires more oxygen. Here's how the test can provide insights into the likelihood of CAD: 1. **Monitoring Heart Rhythm and Rates**: An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) monitors the heart's electrical activity during the test. Changes in the normal heart rhythm or the development of arrhythmias during exercise can suggest the presence of CAD. 2. **Identifying Changes in the ECG Pattern**: During physical exertion, the heart muscle that is poorly perfused due to narrowed or blocked arteries may not receive enough oxygen, leading to ischemia. This can cause specific changes in the ECG pattern, such as ST-segment depression or elevation, indicating that part of the heart is not getting enough oxygen. 3. **Blood Pressure Response**: Abnormal blood pressure responses during exercise—whether the blood pressure falls or does not rise appropriately—can suggest the presence of CAD or other cardiovascular conditions. 4. **Physical Symptoms**: Symptoms experienced during the test, such as chest pain (angina), extreme shortness of breath, dizziness, or undue fatigue, can be indicators of CAD. These symptoms occur because part of the heart may not be receiving enough oxygen during the stress of exercise. 5. **Exercise Capacity and Recovery**: A person's ability to exercise (measured in metabolic equivalents, METs) and how quickly their heart rate and blood pressure return to baseline after stopping exercise can provide insight into heart health and potential CAD. A reduced exercise capacity or prolonged recovery time can be suggestive of CAD. If the exercise stress test indicates a high likelihood of CAD, further investigations, such as a coronary angiogram, stress echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging, might be recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease. It's important to note that the exercise stress test is not 100% accurate in all cases. There are instances of false-positive results (the test suggests CAD when there is none) and false-negative results (the test misses the presence of CAD). Therefore, test results are often considered alongside other clinical findings, patient history, and risk factors when making a diagnostic evaluation for CAD."},{"instruction":"Treatment for cad","output":"The treatment for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. The goal is to relieve symptoms, slow or stop the progression of the disease, and reduce the risk of complications like heart attacks. Here's an overview of the typical treatment approaches for CAD: # 1. Lifestyle Changes Making lifestyle changes is a critical first step in treating CAD. These include: - **Diet**: Adopting a heart-healthy diet that's low in saturated fats, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars. Emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats can help manage CAD. - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve heart health and help control weight. It's important to consult a healthcare provider before starting any exercise program, especially for those with CAD. - **Quitting Smoking**: Smoking is a major risk factor for CAD. Quitting can improve heart health and overall well-being. - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce the heart's workload. - **Alcohol Intake**: Moderating alcohol consumption can be beneficial. Excessive drinking can elevate blood pressure and contribute to heart failure. # 2. Medications Several medications can be used to treat CAD, including: - **Aspirin or other antiplatelet agents**: To prevent blood clots. - **Statins**: To lower cholesterol levels. - **Beta-blockers**: To lower heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen usage by the heart. - **ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)**: To lower blood pressure and manage heart failure. - **Calcium channel blockers**: To relax blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and decrease the heart's workload. - **Nitrates (like nitroglycerin)**: To relieve chest pain by expanding blood vessels. # 3. Procedures and Surgery In cases where medication and lifestyle changes are not sufficient to control CAD, or when there's a high risk of heart attack, more invasive approaches may be considered: - **Angioplasty and Stent Placement (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, PCI)**: A catheter is inserted into the narrowed part of the artery, and a balloon is inflated to open the artery. A stent is often placed to keep the artery open. - **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)**: A surgery that uses arteries or veins from other parts of the body to bypass the narrowed coronary arteries and restore blood flow to the heart muscle. # 4. Management of Risk Factors Treating conditions that contribute to CAD, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol, is also crucial. # Monitoring and Follow-Up Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is important to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment plan, make adjustments as needed, and manage any complications that may arise. Lifestyle changes and medication adherence are key components of managing CAD effectively. The specific treatment plan for CAD varies from person to person, depending on the severity of the disease, symptoms, risk factors, and overall health. The healthcare provider will tailor the treatment approach to best fit the individual's needs."},{"instruction":"As with Fox Kids being replaced by Fox Box/4KidsTV/Game Station/whatever the hell they call it next, Kids WB has been morphed into another 4Kids block: CW4K!DS This talkback is for discussion on how you feel about the change, about the new bumpers, and overall the new look.

It has a loyal fanbase, so ratings shouldn’t be an issue. Glad to see The Spectacular Spider-Man keeping its spot, it’s easily the best thing on this lineup. Yu-Gi-Oh GX will undoubtedly please the TCG crowd. Sad to see some of the departures, but that’s the business, I guess.

I was planning to catch up on Yu-Gi-Oh GX and World of Quest, but if there's no info on what episodes they're airing, that throws a wrench into things. Hopefully, it's just a hiccup with Zap2It's listings and not an indication of a larger scheduling issue at CW4K!DS. It would be nice if the CW4K!DS website or their social media would clear this up.

CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA June 23, 2008 #18 I've noticed this happens sometimes with new schedule shifts or when they're trying out 'special' programming days. Maybe they're highlighting these specific episodes for some promo reason, or it could indeed just be a miscommunication with listing services. If anyone's going to an event or has a way to contact CW4K!DS directly, getting clarification would be much appreciated because this TBA situation is not ideal for us dedicated fans. Missing an episode because of a listing error would be a bummer. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA June 23, 2008 #19 In my experience, when lots of TBA slots show up like this, sometimes it's a sign of either a big schedule change coming or, as CartoonOverlord mentioned, a special programming highlight. Given that we've just had a fairly major shakeup on June 21 with new shows coming in, it could be them spotlighting particular episodes. I'll keep an eye on any updates and share here if I find anything. Meanwhile, maybe it's a good idea for us to plan for these known episodes and stay flexible on the rest until more info comes through.

Do you think \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" will live up to the hype? veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid August 8, 2008 #21 \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" sounds like it could be a big hit. I've seen some of the promotional art and a couple of teaser trailers, and it looks fantastic. Definitely seems like it has the potential to pull in not just the younger crowd but older viewers as well with its deeper storytelling and high-quality animation. It's always a gamble when networks shuffle around popular shows to introduce new ones, but \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" might just be worth the risk. \\"World of Quest\\" fans might be disappointed, though. I hope CW4K!DS finds a new slot for it; it'd be a shame to lose it completely from the lineup. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA August 8, 2008 #22 \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" joining the lineup is exciting! From what I've gathered, it's not your typical kids' show—it has layers, kind of like how \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\" captured a broad audience. If \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" manages to deliver a compelling narrative along with its visual prowess, it could become a staple of CW4K!DS. However, squeezing it into an already packed schedule is tricky. Dropping \\"World of Quest\\" might not sit well with its fans. Balancing new content with established favorites is always a challenge, but let's hope \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" brings enough to the table to justify its place. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA August 8, 2008 #23 Really intrigued by \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" making its way into the lineup. The show has a lot of potentials to become a favorite among viewers for its adventurous and mythical elements. It's always exciting to see fresh content, especially something that seems to be aiming for a slightly different demographic than the usual CW4K!DS fare. While it's unfortunate that \\"World of Quest\\" had to make way, it does highlight the competitive nature of programming. Only so many slots are available, and networks are always looking to keep their lineup fresh and engaging. Here's hoping \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" brings new energy and keeps us all hooked!"},{"instruction":"香港創新科技署擬於明年 12 月舉辦全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽，藉此激發學生對設計手機應用程式的興趣。假設你們負責該項活動，試撰寫一份計劃書向上司交代整個計劃。計畫書內容包括： 1. 時間(15/12/2025-20/12/2025，每日具體時間) 2. 地點(香港創新科技署) 3. 參賽資格 (人數/對象: 分為小學生、中學生包括初中生和高中生三個組別) 4. 報名方式 (報名日: 1/1/2025-1/6/2025，具體方式) 5. 競賽方式(競賽項目，具體比賽內容，具體安排) 6. 競賽流程(表格詳細說明每日流程，包括具體賽前安排及準備) 7. 評分標準(詳細標準) 8. 評審：教授、業界專業人士（設計、電腦科學、商業界…） 9. 獎勵方式（獎勵：表揚:優秀作品構想作為藍本，與合作公司實現出來，向全港市民宣傳科技署及其工作）頒獎典禮（人數/對象: 家長、老師、校長，在學校推動，頒獎、演講，具體安排) 你負責寫1-9項，寫1500字。","output":"**香港創新科技署全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽計劃書** **一、計劃背景及目的** 香港創新科技署（下稱“本署”）致力於推廣科技創新及激發青少年對科技的興趣和創造力。為進一步鼓勵學生學習和利用科技解決問題，本署計劃於2025年12月舉辦「全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽」，旨在提升學生對手機應用程式設計的興趣及能力，並發掘及培養潛在的年輕科技創新人才。 **二、計劃詳情** **1. 時間** 比賽時間為2025年12月15日至2025年12月20日，每日活動時間為09:00-18:00。 **2. 地點** 香港創新科技署（具體地址待定）。 **3. 參賽資格** 參賽隊伍分為三個組別：小學生、初中生及高中生。每隊由3-5人組成，參與學校需於香港地區註冊。 **4. 報名方式** 報名日期為2025年1月1日至2025年6月1日。學校或學生需通過本署提供的線上報名系統進行登記，並提交參賽隊伍的基本信息及初步的應用程式構想。 **5. 競賽方式** 比賽設計環節將包括創意提案、應用開發及現場演示三個部分。參賽隊伍需於比賽前兩日完成手機應用的原型設計，並於比賽第三日進行現場演示及答辯。 **6. 競賽流程** | 日期 | 活動內容 | |----------|---------------------| | 15/12/2025 | 開幕式及競賽主題發佈，組隊及初步討論 | | 16/12/2025 | 專題講座及工作坊，技術咨詢與輔導 | | 17/12/2025 | 應用開發，中期檢查評估 | | 18/12/2025 | 應用開發，準備演示材質 | | 19/12/2025 | 現場演示及評審 | | 20/12/2025 | 頒獎典禮及閉幕 | **7. 評分標準** 評審團將從創意性、技術難度、實用性、使用者體驗以及最終的演示呈現等方面對作品進行評分。 **8. 評審** 評審團將由來自不同領域的專業人士組成，包括教授、業界專業人士（設計、電腦科學、商業界等）。 **9. 獎勵方式** 優勝隊伍將有機會與地區內著名的科技公司合作，將其作品做進一步的開發與完善，並在香港地區推廣。此外，將於頒獎典禮上對優勝隊伍進行表彰，並邀請學生家長、老師及校長共同慶祝，以推廣比賽成果及表揚學生創新成就。 **三、結語** 本次比賽是香港創新科技署積極推動科技教育和創新的一項重要舉措。通過此次活動，我們期望能夠激發學生對移動應用開發的熱情，培養他們的創新思維和實踐能力，並為香港培養更多優秀的科技人才。我們誠摯地邀請各學校的積極參與，共同見證香港青少年科技創新的蓬勃發展。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

What do you guys think about this shuffle? veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid June 18, 2008 #12 Definitely an interesting shakeup. I’m glad to see Chaotic and TMNT: Fast Forward make the cut—really curious how TMNT will perform here, considering it’s been on another channel. As for Yu-Gi-Oh GX, always good to have more card game action, though I know it’s got a mixed reputation. It’s a shame about Horrid Henry though; it had a unique charm. Still, the schedule looks promising, and I’m particularly excited for the new TMNT episodes. Hoping this brings some fresh energy to Saturday mornings. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA June 18, 2008 #13 I have to agree on the new additions doing well, especially TMNT: Fast Forward. It has a loyal fanbase, so ratings shouldn’t be an issue. Glad to see The Spectacular Spider-Man keeping its spot, it’s easily the best thing on this lineup. Yu-Gi-Oh GX will undoubtedly please the TCG crowd. Sad to see some of the departures, but that’s the business, I guess. Here’s hoping the newcomers can maintain or even boost viewership for CW4K!DS. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA June 18, 2008 #14 Mixed feelings here. Excited for Chaotic and the others, but it’s kind of a letdown to lose Horrid Henry. Johnny Test and Eon Kid leaving was expected but still a bit of a loss, content-wise. This new lineup certainly seems geared towards a more action-oriented audience, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Curious to see how it all pans out rating-wise come fall.

Skunk Fu! has its moments, but I thought Johnny Test had a solid fan base, and Horrid Henry certainly had its unique charm. It’s interesting to see what the network decides is worth keeping and what’s not. Anyone else puzzled by this decision? Or does Skunk Fu! have a bigger following than I’m aware of? It seems like a quirky choice, especially given how competitive these slots are becoming with the new additions.

Looks like we’re only getting specific episodes for some shows, namely Skunk Fu!'s “The Art of Dream Control” and “The Art of Patience”, Chaotic’s “Welcome to Chaotic”, Ben 10’s “And Then There Were 10”, and TMNT: Fast Forward’s “Future Shellshocked”. Everything else is listed as TBA. Are they doing a special highlight episode kind of thing, or is Zap2It just behind on the updates? It’s a bit concerning not knowing what’s going to air, especially for those of us trying to plan our viewing or recordings. veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid June 23, 2008 #17 That’s definitely strange. I was planning to catch up on Yu-Gi-Oh GX and World of Quest, but if there’s no info on what episodes they’re airing, that throws a wrench into things. Hopefully, it’s just a hiccup with Zap2It’s listings and not an indication of a larger scheduling issue at CW4K!DS. It would be nice if the CW4K!DS website or their social media would clear this up. In the past, I’ve found Zap2It reliable, but occasionally these snags happen. Does anyone have an insider scoop or seen any updates elsewhere? CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA June 23, 2008 #18 I’ve noticed this happens sometimes with new schedule shifts or when they’re trying out ‘special’ programming days. Maybe they’re highlighting these specific episodes for some promo reason, or it could indeed just be a miscommunication with listing services. If anyone’s going to an event or has a way to contact CW4K!DS directly, getting clarification would be much appreciated because this TBA situation is not ideal for us dedicated fans. Missing an episode because of a listing error would be a bummer. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA June 23, 2008 #19 In my experience, when lots of TBA slots show up like this, sometimes it’s a sign of either a big schedule change coming or, as CartoonOverlord mentioned, a special programming highlight. Given that we’ve just had a fairly major shakeup on June 21 with new shows coming in, it could be them spotlighting particular episodes. I’ll keep an eye on any updates and share here if I find anything. Meanwhile, maybe it’s a good idea for us to plan for these known episodes and stay flexible on the rest until more info comes through. Fingers crossed it sorts itself out by the end of the week.

Hopefully, this means we’ll see the rest of the schedule firm up soon. Still holding out hope they clarify what's happening with the likes of World of Quest and the rest. Any other updates or episode announcements from anyone else? veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid June 25, 2008 #21 Good to see some progress with the listings! \\"The Next King of Games\\" is a classic for any Yu-Gi-Oh GX fan, so that’s a must-watch. And Magi-Nation doesn't always get the attention it deserves, so \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" being scheduled is excellent news for its viewers. It does seem like the lineup is slowly but surely coming together. Has anyone checked if the CW4K!DS website or their social media platforms finally addressed this? It’d be nice to get a full picture of what to expect, especially for planning our Saturday morning watch parties. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA June 25, 2008 #22 Definitely a step in the right direction with those episode confirmations. Yu-Gi-Oh GX and Magi-Nation are showing some of the cornerstones of their series this weekend, which should pull their fans in. With this bit of resolution, it's making the recent changes feel a bit more stable. However, I'm still curious about the reasoning behind the initial TBA blanket. Hopefully, this isn’t a recurring theme with the CW4K!DS schedule moving forward. The sooner they get their scheduling communication streamlined, the better for us fans. Fingers crossed the rest of the lineup is clarified soon. Would hate to miss out on any episodes because of these hiccups. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA June 25, 2008 #23 Seeing more episodes locked in is reassuring. \\"The Next King of Games\\" is such a pivotal episode for Yu-Gi-Oh GX, kicking off everything with a bang. And I've been following Magi-Nation closely, so \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" is definitely on my watch list. This slow reveal of the schedule might have been a hiccup or perhaps a strategy to keep us on our toes. Either way, I hope they smooth things out for future airings. Can’t wait to see the full, confirmed lineup for the weekend. Let’s keep each other posted if more episodes get their slots confirmed!"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where FOO is actually a Quest episode, so MN is still TBA","output":"D Dubbs Wish Upon A Star JoinedMar 23, 2007 Messages14,881 LocationWisconsin June 26, 2008 #24 Quick correction on my last post, folks. It turns out there was a mix-up with the episode listings. \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" is actually an episode of World of Quest, not Magi-Nation. So, we’ve got a solid lineup for World of Quest fans, but Magi-Nation is still sitting in the TBA zone for now. With World of Quest getting some love, it’s great for its viewer base, and \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" is a key episode for the series. However, the absence of updates for Magi-Nation is becoming more noticeable. Does anyone have any insights or updates on when we might expect to see which episodes of Magi-Nation are airing? veemonjosh Stone free, do what I please JoinedSep 30, 2005 Messages28,860 LocationThe Grid June 26, 2008 #25 Ah, that makes more sense for World of Quest. I was wondering how that episode title fit into Magi-Nation. Good catch and correction there. As for Magi-Nation, the silence is puzzling. It's a series with a dedicated following, and not having clear information is surely frustrating for the fans. I hope this isn't an oversight and we get some episode confirmations soon. It's a bit of a rollercoaster with these schedule updates. Keeping my fingers crossed that the rest of the lineup, especially Magi-Nation, gets clarified before the weekend hits. CartoonOverlord Head of HATE JoinedSep 27, 2005 Messages2,302 LocationUSA June 26, 2008 #26 Whoops, a little twist in the tale there with the World of Quest vs. Magi-Nation mix-up. But that’s good news for World of Quest enthusiasts! \\"Fall of Odyssia\\" is definitely an episode worth tuning in for. Magi-Nation still being up in the air is curious. You’d think with all the scheduling shifts, they’d want to keep their audience as informed as possible. I hope it's just a temporary hiccup and not indicative of a larger issue with the show's placement on the CW4K!DS roster. Given these changes, hopefully, we'll see a complete and updated schedule soon. It’s a bit challenging to keep track of the lineup with all these shifts and corrections. simpsonsfan Froakie - Bubble Frog Pokemon Staff member Moderator JoinedAug 19, 2006 Messages2,662 LocationMaine, USA June 26, 2008 #27 Thanks for clearing up the confusion around World of Quest and Magi-Nation. It’s a relief to know what’s happening with World of Quest, but the ongoing TBA status for Magi-Nation episodes definitely adds a layer of mystery to this weekend’s viewing plans. Let’s hope that this is the last of the confusion and that we get a clear and complete schedule soon, especially for the sake of Magi-Nation fans waiting patiently for updates. It's crucial for viewers to know when and where they can catch their favorite shows, so clarity is key. Keep an eye out, everyone, and let’s share any new information as it comes in. Here's hoping the full lineup is confirmed and communicated well ahead of Saturday morning."},{"instruction":"does i can make a withdraw to my bank account instantly with paypal ?","output":"With PayPal, you can withdraw funds to your bank account, but whether it's \\"instant\\" depends on the specific services and features available in your country, as well as your bank's processes. PayPal generally offers two types of bank withdrawal options: 1. **Standard Bank Transfer**: This is the regular withdrawal method, which is usually free and can take 1-5 business days to complete, depending on your bank's processing time. 2. **Instant Transfer**: This feature allows you to instantly transfer money from your PayPal balance to your bank account or eligible debit card. Instant Transfers are subject to fees. The availability of this option can depend on your region and the bank you're using. If Instant Transfer is available to you, PayPal will present this option when you initiate a withdrawal. It's worth noting that not all banks support instant transfers, and there might be limits on how much money you can transfer instantly. Also, to use Instant Transfer, you typically need to have linked and confirmed your debit card or bank account with PayPal.

Важно помнить, что хранение больших данных в базе данных может замедлить производительность, поэтому стоит использовать это осмотрительно и в зависимости от конкретной ситуации."},{"instruction":"почему db.LargeBinary без скобок","output":"В SQLAlchemy, при использовании \`db.Column\` для определения типа столбца в базе данных, определение типа данных \`LargeBinary\` может быть использовано без скобок, поскольку это фактически ссылка на сам тип данных, а не его создание. Это отличается от других типов данных, таких как \`db.String(100)\`, где скобки используются для указания максимальной длины строки. Таким образом, в случае \`LargeBinary\` без скобок, SQLAlchemy понимает, что вы ссылаетесь на тип данных \`LargeBinary\`, который будет использоваться для столбца, а не на создание объекта этого типа данных.

Вот что можно сделать: 1. **Посмотрите историю миграций**: Вы можете использовать команду \`alembic history\` для просмотра списка всех миграций, которые были применены к вашей базе данных. Это позволит вам определить, какая миграция была пропущена. 2. **Создайте новую миграцию**: Если у вас есть доступ к коду или скриптам, которые формируют структуру вашей базы данных, вы можете создать новую миграцию с помощью команды \`alembic revision --autogenerate -m \\"Описание миграции\\"\`. Это позволит Alembic сравнить текущее состояние базы данных с вашей моделью и создать новую миграцию. 3. **Примените новую миграцию**: После создания новой миграции, вы можете применить ее к вашей базе данных с помощью команды \`alembic upgrade head\`, чтобы применить все миграции до последней. 4. **Проверьте изменения**: После применения новой миграции, убедитесь, что ваши изменения были успешно применены к базе данных, и все работает как ожидается. Следуя этим шагам, вы сможете восстановить пропущенную миграцию и привести вашу базу данных к соответствующему состоянию."},{"instruction":"back_populates","output":"В SQLAlchemy параметр \`back_populates\` используется для настройки двусторонних отношений между двумя классами (моделями), чтобы обеспечить обратное отображение, то есть ссылку на родительский объект из дочернего и наоборот. Когда определяется отношение на одной стороне (например, с помощью \`relationship\`), параметр \`back_populates\` позволяет указать атрибут на другой стороне этого отношения, который будет использоваться для обратного отображения.

Например, если у вас есть отношение между классом \`User\` и классом \`Post\` без указания \`back_populates\`, вы сможете обращаться к постам пользователя через атрибут \`posts\` в классе \`User\`, но не сможете автоматически обратиться к пользователю из класса \`Post\`. Чтобы иметь возможность обратного отображения отношения и обращаться к связанным объектам как из одной, так и из другой стороны, удобно использовать параметр \`back_populates\`. Это делает навигацию между объектами более удобной и интуитивно понятной. Таким образом, использование \`back_populates\` рекомендуется для настройки двусторонних отношений между классами в SQLAlchemy, чтобы иметь полный доступ ко всем связанным объектам в обе стороны отношения."},{"instruction":"какие альтернативы back_populates","output":"В SQLAlchemy есть несколько альтернатив, которые можно использовать вместо \`back_populates\` для настройки обратного отображения двусторонних отношений между классами: 1. **backref**: \`backref\` - это альтернативный способ установить обратное отображение отношения.

Пример: \`\`\`python class User(Base): __tablename__ = 'users' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) name = Column(String) posts = relationship(\\"Post\\", backref=\\"user\\") class Post(Base): __tablename__ = 'posts' id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) title = Column(String) user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id')) \`\`\` Здесь \`backref=\\"user\\"\` автоматически устанавливает обратное отображение отношения между \`User\` и \`Post\`, без необходимости указывать \`back_populates\`. 2. **dynamic relationship**: Вы можете использовать \`dynamic\` отношение, чтобы создать ленивое отношение, которое генерирует запрос к другой таблице по запросу, а не сразу. Это может быть полезно в больших наборах данных, когда не нужно загружать все связанные объекты одновременно. Пример: \`\`\`python posts = relationship(\\"Post\\", lazy='dynamic') \`\`\` 3. **ручное управление отношениями**: Вместо использования автоматического обратного отображения, вы можете вручную управлять связями между объектами, вызывая методы доступа к связям для установки и изменения отношений.

Это позволяет расширению отслеживать информацию о пользователе, который вошел в административную панель, в рамках текущего запроса. Однако Flask-Admin сам по себе не выполняет сохранение информации о пользователях в базе данных или других хранилищах данных. Это обычно требует дополнительной настройки и использования других расширений или разработки пользовательской логики для работы с данными пользователей, включая хранение информации о вошедших в административную панель пользователях. Таким образом, для сохранения информации о пользователях, вошедших в административную панель, вам может потребоваться настроить собственную логику аутентификации и хранения данных о пользователе в вашем приложении Flask, используя, например, Flask-SQLAlchemy для работы с базой данных."},{"instruction":"метод pop для словаря","output":"Метод \`pop()\` используется для удаления элемента из словаря по указанному ключу и возвращает значение этого элемента.

Processing a 27GB CSV file all at once is not feasible on most machines due to memory limitations. Instead, you can read the CSV in chunks, preprocess the chunks one by one, and use partial fit approaches for training models. This is crucial for handling large datasets that don't fit in memory. For demonstration purposes, let's assume you're going to use a simple model like SGDRegressor or SGDClassifier from scikit-learn, which supports partial fitting. The choice of model can vary based on your specific task (regression or classification) and data characteristics. Here's an outline of how you can process the data in chunks and train a model with partial fit: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier # or SGDRegressor for regression tasks from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import HashingVectorizer # Assuming textual or categorical features, change accordingly from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score # or another relevant metric # Define your model model = SGDClassifier() # Or SGDRegressor, depending on your need # Adjust these parameters according to your needs chunksize = 10 ** 5 # Process 100,000 rows at a time vectorizer = HashingVectorizer(n_features=2**10) # Adjust according to your needs def process_chunk(chunk): # Assuming 'Prior_1' and 'Prior_2' are your target variables, and the rest are features # This will vary based on your actual dataset structure X = chunk.drop(['Prior_1', 'Prior_2'], axis=1) y = chunk['Prior_1'] # Or 'Prior_2', depending on which one you're predicting # Transform features here (e.g., vectorization, encoding) # Example for text features, change this according to your actual features X_transformed = vectorizer.transform(X.astype(str)) # Assuming X needs to be converted to string (for textual data) return X_transformed, y # Path to your large CSV file csv_file = 'path/to/your/large_file.csv' # Read & process the CSV in chunks for chunk in pd.read_csv(csv_file, chunksize=chunksize): X_chunk, y_chunk = process_chunk(chunk) # Split the chunk into training and testing dataset X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_chunk, y_chunk, test_size=0.2) # Partially fit the model on the chunk model.partial_fit(X_train, y_train, classes=np.unique(y_train)) # For classifier, specify unique classes # Optionally, evaluate the model on this chunk's test set predictions = model.predict(X_test) print(\\"Chunk accuracy:\\", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)) # At this point, your model has been trained on the entire dataset, in chunks. # For further validation, you might want to keep some data aside or perform cross-validation in some form, # which will require a more complex setup for handling data in chunks. \`\`\` Keep in mind: - This is a very basic demonstration and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific situation, especially around pre-processing. - If your data includes textual or categorical features, consider how best to encode these (e.g., with one-hot encoding, feature hashing, etc.). The example uses \`HashingVectorizer\` for text features as a placeholder. - For deployment or evaluation on unseen data, ensure you transform new data using the same steps as your training data before making predictions. - Depending on your specific prediction task, you might need to adjust the model (\`SGDClassifier\` or \`SGDRegressor\`) and its parameters. - Ensure your target variable(s) (\`Prior_1\` and \`Prior_2\`) are correctly handled, especially if predicting both requires a multi-output model or separate models."},{"instruction":"香港創新科技署擬於明年 12 月舉辦全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽，藉此激發學生對設計手機應用程式的興趣。假設你們負責該項活動，試撰寫一份計劃書向上司交代整個計劃。計畫書內容包括： 1. 時間(15/12/2025-20/12/2025，每日具體時間) 2. 地點(香港創新科技署) 3. 參賽資格 (人數/對象: 分為小學生、中學生包括初中生和高中生三個組別) 4. 報名方式 (報名日: 1/1/2025-1/6/2025，具體方式) 5. 競賽方式(競賽項目，具體比賽內容，具體安排) 6. 競賽流程(表格詳細說明每日流程，包括具體賽前安排及準備) 7. 評分標準(詳細標準) 8. 評審：教授、業界專業人士（設計、電腦科學、商業界…） 9. 獎勵方式（獎勵：表揚:優秀作品構想作為藍本，與合作公司實現出來，向全港市民宣傳科技署及其工作）頒獎典禮（人數/對象: 家長、老師、校長，在學校推動，頒獎、演講，具體安排) 你負責寫1-9項，寫1500字。","output":"全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽計畫書 # 1. 時間安排 本次比賽將於2025年12月15日至2025年12月20日舉行，具體時間安排如下： - **15/12/2025**：開幕式及簡介會 (10:00 - 12:00) - **16/12/2025-19/12/2025**：實際比賽時間，每日9:00 - 17:00 - **20/12/2025**：評審時間及頒獎典禮 (9:00 - 12:00) # 2. 地點 香港創新科技署 # 3. 參賽資格 - **人數/對象**：比賽分為三個組別，分別為小學生組、初中生組以及高中生組。 - **組隊要求**：每組限制3至5名學生。 # 4. 報名方式 - **報名日**：自2025年1月1日起至2025年6月1日。 - **報名方式**：學生可通過填寫線上報名表格進行報名，並需提交一份簡單的應用程式創意提案。 # 5. 競賽方式 比賽將要求參賽者在限定時間內，根據特定主題開發出創意手機應用程式。具體比賽內容及安排如下： - **項目**：手機應用程式設計及開發。 - **比賽內容**：給定相關主題，學生需現場設計並開發出相應的應用程式解決方案。 # 6. 競賽流程 以下為每日的詳細流程： | 日期 | 時間 | 活動 | |---------|----------|-------------------| | 15/12 | 10:00-12:00 | 開幕式及項目簡介 | | 16/12-19/12 | 9:00-17:00 | 組別分組進行系統開發與設計 | | 20/12 | 9:00-12:00 | 評審時間及頒獎典禮 | # 7. 評分標準 評分將由以下幾個方面構成： - **創意及原創性**：30分 - **技術實現**：30分 - **使用者體驗**：20分 - **市場潛力及應用實用性**：20分 # 8. 評審 評審團將由知名教授、業界專業人士（包括設計、電腦科學及商業界等）組成。 # 9. 獎勵方式及頒獎典禮 - **獎勵**：優勝團隊將獲得與合作公司實現其應用程式的機會，並在全港範圍內宣傳。 - **頒獎典禮**：頒獎儀式將邀請獲獎隊伍的家長、老師及校長出席。頒獎過程中將包括獲獎隊伍的演講，以及對他們的表揚和鼓勵。 本次比賽旨在提升香港學生對手機應用程式設計的興趣及能力，期待各位學生的積極參與和創意碰撞。"},{"instruction":"6. 競賽流程更具體一些","output":"# 競賽流程詳細說明 以下是比賽各日的具體流程與安排： 開幕式及項目簡介（15/12/2025） | 時間 | 活動內容 | |------------|-------------------| | 10:00-10:30 | 歡迎致辭與介紹香港創新科技署 | | 10:30-11:00 | 比賽規則、評分標準與日程安排說明 | | 11:00-12:00 | 主題發布與問答時間 | 設計與開發階段（16/12/2025 - 19/12/2025） | 時間 | 活動內容 | |------------|-----------------------------------------------| | 9:00-12:00 | 團隊研討與設計規劃 - 團隊利用此時段討論應用程序設計與開發戰略 | | 12:00-13:00 | 午餐及休息時間 | | 13:00-17:00 | 程式編碼與開發 - 開始實際的程式編寫工作，並對設計進行初步實現 | 閉幕與頒獎典禮（20/12/2025） | 時間 | 活動內容 | |------------|---------------------------| | 9:00-10:00 | 團隊最終整合與準備發表 | | 10:00-11:00 | 團隊發表 - 各團隊展示其應用程式設計與功能 | | 11:00-11:30 | 評委評分與商討 | | 11:30-12:00 | 頒獎典禮 - 宣布獲勝團隊並頒發獎項 | 比賽詳細規劃與賽前準備 - **賽前準備**：所有參賽隊伍需在比賽開始前一週提交其應用程式的初步設計概念，以供主辦方進行賽前評估並安排必要的技術支援。 - **技術講座**：在比賽開始的前一個月，將組織系列的在線講座介紹最新的手機應用開發工具和技術，幫助參賽者更好地準備比賽。 - **現場支援**：比賽期間，將有專業的技術團隊在現場提供技術支援與諮詢，幫助解決開發過程中遇到的困難。 透過本次比賽，希望能激發學生對於科技創新的熱情，並為他們提供一個展現才能與創造力的平台。同時，透過與專業人士的互動交流，進一步拓寬他們的視野，為未來的學術或職業生涯奠定堅實的基礎。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Для обучения моделей ИИ необходимы не просто большие объемы данных, но и качественно размеченные данные. Разноспектральная разметка данных – это передовой метод в области обработки данных, который позволяет улучшить качество и эффективность процесса обучения искусственного интеллекта. # Основные понятия **Разноспектральная разметка данных** — это процесс добавления информативных аннотаций к данным, полученным в различных спектрах (например, оптическом, инфракрасном, радио и т.д.), для их последующей обработки и анализа. Эти аннотации могут включать в себя как метки классов, так и более сложные структуры, например, объекты с указанием их контуров или параметров движения. # Применение Разноспектральная разметка находит свое применение в ряде областей, таких как: - **Дистанционное зондирование Земли**: объединение данных, полученных в разных спектрах, для анализа растительности, обнаружения изменений в ландшафтах, мониторинга природных и антропогенных явлений. - **Медицинская визуализация**: обработка и анализ медицинских изображений, полученных с помощью различных технологий (МРТ, КТ, ультразвук и т.д.), для диагностики и мониторинга состояния здоровья пациентов. - **Безопасность и спасательные операции**: использование данных из разных спектров для поиска и спасения людей, мониторинга изменений в окружающей среде и обнаружения потенциальных угроз. # Технологическая основа Разноспектральная разметка включает использование различных инструментов и техник для аннотирования данных, например: - **Алгоритмы компьютерного зрения** для автоматического распознавания объектов и их характеристик в изображениях. - **Глубокое обучение** для обработки больших массивов разноспектральных данных и выявления сложных закономерностей и зависимостей. - **Ручная разметка** специалистами в области для создания эталонных датасетов для последующего обучения и тестирования моделей ИИ. # Проблемы и перспективы Необходимость обработки больших объемов разноспектральных данных и обеспечение их адекватной разметки ставит перед исследователями и разработчиками ряд вызовов, включая необходимость разработки эффективных алгоритмов и инструментов для ускорения и автоматизации процесса разметки, обеспечения высокой точности и надежности получаемых аннотаций, а также защиты от искажений и ошибок.

Каждый сегмент получает соответствующую метку. 2. **Анализ спектральных характеристик**: Для каждого сегмента, идентифицированного как сельскохозяйственное угодье, анализируются данные, полученные в разных спектральных диапазонах. Например, инфракрасные изображения позволяют оценить состояние растительности, поскольку зеленые растения имеют высокое отражение в ближнем инфракрасном диапазоне. 3. **Разметка и аннотация**: Используя результаты анализа, специалисты или автоматизированные системы наносят на карту дополнительную информацию, такую как тип растительности, степень ее зрелости или стрессовое состояние. Данные аннотации могут использоваться для создания карт растительности, мониторинга изменений и принятия решений в аграрном секторе. **Пример разметки**: На инфракрасном изображении области, где растут здоровые растения, будут выделены и помечены как \\"Здоровая растительность\\", благодаря их характерному спектральному отражению. Участки, где растительность страдает от недостатка воды или болезней, будут помечены другими аннотациями в зависимости от их спектральных характеристик, например, как \\"Стрессовое состояние растительности\\". **Вывод**: В итоге, разноспектральная разметка позволяет не только точно определить границы сельскохозяйственных угодий на больших территориях, но и дать детализированную оценку состояния растений на этих угодьях, что является бесценным инструментом для фермеров, агрономов и экологов."},{"instruction":"Почему оператор может размечать в разных спектрах и для чего это нужно?","output":"Оператор, занимающийся разметкой данных, может выполнять разметку в разных спектрах для удовлетворения широкого спектра научных, промышленных или исследовательских потребностей.

Deciding if someone with CAD requires surgical treatment involves a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare team. Numerous factors are considered in making this decision. Here are some key considerations: # 1. Symptom Severity - **Angina (Chest Pain):** How often and how severe is the chest pain? Does it interfere with daily activities? - **Shortness of Breath:** Difficulty breathing during daily activities or at rest can signal that the heart is struggling. # 2. Medication and Lifestyle Changes Prior to considering surgery, it's important to evaluate how well the patient responds to non-surgical treatments, including medication, diet, exercise, and other lifestyle modifications. Surgery may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen despite these measures. # 3. Results of Diagnostic Tests Several tests can help determine the extent and severity of CAD and inform the decision-making process: - **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):** Checks for patterns indicating ischemia (lack of blood flow) or previous heart attacks. - **Echocardiogram:** Evaluates heart function and structure. - **Stress Test:** Measures how well the heart functions under physical stress. - **Coronary Angiography:** Provides a detailed view of the heart arteries to identify blockages. # 4. Extent of Coronary Artery Blockage The number and location of artery blockages, as well as the degree of obstruction, play a critical role in deciding the need for surgery. Generally, surgery might be more likely recommended if: - There is a significant blockage (generally >70%) in the left main coronary artery or severe blockages in multiple arteries. - There's a left ventricular dysfunction (poor pumping function of the heart's left ventricle). # 5. Types of Surgical Treatment Options Depending on the specific circumstances, several surgical options might be considered: - **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI):** Also known as angioplasty, this procedure involves the inflation of a balloon inside the artery to open the blockage, often with a stent placed to keep the artery open. - **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG):** A more invasive surgery where arteries or veins from elsewhere in the body are grafted to bypass the blocked coronary arteries. # 6. Patient's Overall Health and Preferences - **Comorbidities:** Other existing health conditions can influence the decision for or against surgery. - **Patient Preferences:** Some patients might prefer to avoid surgery if possible, opting for medication and lifestyle changes, while others may opt for a more definitive surgical approach. # 7. Risk vs. Benefit Analysis The decision for surgery involves weighing the benefits of the procedure in terms of symptom relief and potential life extension against the risks associated with the surgery itself, which can vary based on the patient’s overall health. Ultimately, the decision to pursue surgical treatment for CAD is individualized, based on the patient’s specific condition, overall health, lifestyle, preferences, and the professional judgment of their healthcare team. A thorough discussion between the patient and their cardiologist or a team of cardiovascular specialists is essential to make an informed decision that aligns with the patient's values and goals for their health and quality of life."},{"instruction":"What's coronary angiography? What's the difference between coronary angiogram","output":"Coronary angiography and a coronary angiogram essentially refer to the same diagnostic procedure, albeit the terms might be used slightly differently in some contexts. They are both integral parts of evaluating and diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD), heart muscle diseases, and other heart conditions. Let’s break down what each term typically refers to and how they are used in the medical field. # Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography is a medical procedure used to visually examine the inside of coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart. This is done to check for any restrictions or blockages that can lead to heart conditions such as angina, heart attacks, or heart failure. The procedure involves the use of X-ray imaging combined with a contrast dye that is injected into the coronary arteries to make them visible on the X-ray images. This allows doctors to see the flow of blood through the arteries and identify any blockages or narrowing. # Coronary Angiogram The term \\"coronary angiogram\\" specifically refers to the series of X-ray images or the actual visualization generated during the coronary angiography procedure. It is these images that doctors analyze to diagnose conditions, decide on the best treatment plans, and determine if interventions like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery might be necessary. # Procedure Overview The procedure typically involves the following steps: 1. **Access:** A catheter is usually inserted through a small incision in the groin, arm, or wrist and then navigated through the vascular system to reach the coronary arteries. 2. **Contrast Dye Injection:** Once the catheter is in place at the openings of the coronary arteries, a contrast dye is injected through the catheter. This dye is iodine-based and makes the arteries visible under X-ray. 3. **Imaging:** X-ray images are taken as the dye flows through the coronary arteries. These images show whether there are any blockages or narrowing in the arteries. 4. **Analysis:** The resulting angiogram (the images) is analyzed to identify the locations and severity of any coronary artery disease. # The Difference In summary, the difference between coronary angiography and a coronary angiogram is a matter of process versus result. Coronary angiography refers to the entire diagnostic procedure, while a coronary angiogram refers to the actual images or the result generated by the angiography procedure. However, in everyday language, even among healthcare professionals, these terms can be used interchangeably without causing confusion, as both relate to the process of diagnosing and assessing the coronary arteries."},{"instruction":"Что такое вырожденная и невырожденная матрица","output":"Вырожденная матрица - это квадратная матрица, определитель которой равен нулю.

Shadow slaves of vampires will destroy cure labs and establish military to infect humanity. Shadow slaves and vampires don't like being cured. If humanity was corrupted, vampires rules world, world fall into shadows, shadow slaves eradicated garlics and shadow priests spread religion.","output":"Nyso Eternium, as you've described, seems to be a fascinating blend of science fiction, fantasy, and horror elements, creating a complex, apocalyptic scenario where an ancient coronavirus, manipulated in mysterious ways, gives rise to a new form of vampires. This is a creative and imaginative narrative possibly suited for a novel, film, or video game rather than a reflection of real-world events or entities. Let's explore the elements of this narrative and potential implications in a fictional setting: # Origin and Transmission - **Origin:** The mysterious and otherworldly origins of Nyso Eternium, coupled with its manipulation of an ancient virus, create an intriguing backstory. The void and darkness from which it arises could symbolize unknown scientific territories or the primal fear of the unknown and uncontrollable diseases. - **Transmission:** Its ability to transmit \\"everything\\" suggests a metaphor for the pervasive and all-encompassing threat of pandemics, transcending physical barriers and infiltrating all aspects of society. # Symptoms and Powers - **Nocturnal Symptoms:** The symptoms like nocturnal activities, shadow blessings, sensitivity to light, and the creation of shadow slaves inject a supernatural element, reminiscing of traditional vampire lore but with a viral twist. - **Vampiric Awakening:** This power to summon new vampires points towards exponential growth, much like the spread of real-world viruses but with a conscious and malevolent intent, symbolizing potentially uncontrolled outbreaks. # Society and Resistance - **Lairs and Cure Labs:** The strategic opposition between vampires creating lairs to strengthen Nyso Eternium and their efforts to destroy cure labs represents a clash between the spread of disease and attempts at medical intervention. The vampires' omnipresent knowledge and targeting of cure facilities highlight the challenges faced by medical researchers in combating evolving pathogens. - **Military and Shadow Slaves:** The establishment of a military force by shadow slaves underlines the societal collapse and the transition towards a dystopian reality where the infected rule, eliminating any hope for a cure. It resonates with themes of totalitarian control and the suppression of resistance or dissent. # Final Conquest - **Domination and Cultural Eradication:** With humanity corrupted and vampires ruling the world, the scenario paints a picture of ultimate despair, where traditional symbols of protection (like garlic) and religious sanctity are eradicated. The spreading of a vampire-based religion by shadow priests symbolizes the absolute transformation of society and the eradication of former beliefs and norms. In a fictional universe, Nyso Eternium could serve as a powerful allegory for real-world issues such as pandemics, the spread of misinformation, societal collapse, and the human struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds. It merges the terror of uncontrollable diseases with the age-old fascination with vampires, creating a rich tapestry for storytelling."},{"instruction":"Nyso Eternium outbreak happens on Earth, write history and timeline, date started on 15 April 2024","output":"Given the rich and detailed lore surrounding the Nyso Eternium virus, let's craft a fictional history and timeline for this outbreak that begins on Earth on April 15, 2024. This narrative will blend elements of science fiction, fantasy, and horror into a cohesive timeline. # 2024: The Outbreak Begins - **April 15:** The first case of Nyso Eternium is documented in a remote village, hidden in the shadows of an ancient forest. The origins of the virus are shrouded in mystery, linked to an unearthed artifact that radiated a dark, unknown energy. - **April 30:** Reports of a strange illness, causing nocturnal behavior and extreme sensitivity to light, start to emerge from neighboring areas.

Traditional containment measures fail as Nyso Eternium demonstrates the ability to infect through unknown means, transcending physical barriers. - **August:** Governments worldwide acknowledge the severity of the outbreak. Major cities are put under lockdown, but the infection continues to spread, exacerbated by the \\"Vampiric Awakening\\" - an alarming increase in the infected exhibiting vampire-like tendencies. # 2024-2025: Descent into Darkness - **October 2024:** The first \\"lair\\" is discovered underneath a major metropolis, acting as a hive for the infected and boosting the Nyso Eternium's potency. - **December 2024:** The winter solstice is marked by a global event named \\"The Longest Night,\\" where millions of shadow slaves emerge, attacking cure research facilities worldwide. - **February 2025:** Traditional forces fail to contain the infected, who now exhibit abilities to detect and destroy any attempt at developing a cure. Humanity begins to lose hope as shadow slaves establish control over devastated regions. # 2025-2026: The New World Order - **April 2025:** A year after the outbreak, half of the world's population is either infected or under the control of the vampires' military might. The concept of day and night loses meaning as dark clouds cover the skies, propelled by ancient, dark magic. - **June 2025:** The last standing cure lab is destroyed. Vampires celebrate their dominion by eradicating garlic and demolishing religious institutions, replacing them with shrines dedicated to the shadow priests. - **January 2026:** The New World Order is established, with vampires ruling over humans. Major capitals are transformed into mega lairs, and the infected roam freely. Humanity is pushed to the brink of extinction, living in fear and serving their new rulers. # 2026-2027: Resistance and Hope - **March 2026:** Small pockets of human resistance begin to form, utilizing underground bunkers that shield them from the omnipresent gaze of the vampires. These groups start developing their own sources of light, safe from the virus's reach. - **August 2026:** The resistance discovers ancient texts that speak of a \\"Lumina Core\\" - a mythical source of pure light that could potentially reverse the effects of Nyso Eternium. - **May 2027:** After months of searching, the Lumina Core is found. The resistance mounts a global campaign to deploy it against the vampires, sparking the first signs of hope among humanity. # 2027 and Beyond: The Fight for Reclamation - **2027-2030:** The battle between light and darkness rages.

This novel airborne virus shares the aggressive neurological symptoms of rabies with the highly transmissible characteristics of COVID-19, creating an unprecedented global crisis. Instead of the typical zombification depicted in popular culture, those affected by RABIES-23 retain a semblance of their prior cognition but are driven by an insatiable aggression, blurring the lines between the undead and the living. # Timeline of Events 2024: Patient Zero and Initial Outbreak - **January 2024**: The first case of RABIES-23 is identified in a densely populated metropolitan area. The origin is traced back to a mutation in the rabies virus that occurred in a bat population, which, through a series of spillover events, combined with a residual strain of COVID-19. - **March 2024**: Sporadic cases appear across the globe, initially dismissed as severe instances of rabies. However, the airborne nature of transmission quickly becomes apparent, leading to widespread panic. 2024-2025: Global Spread and Societal Collapse - **June 2024**: Governments implement strict quarantine measures, but the virus' airborne transmission vector proves difficult to contain. Major cities experience outbreaks, leading to chaos and anarchy. - **December 2024**: The global economy collapses as countries focus on survival rather than trade. Societal structures crumble under the strain of the pandemic, with many regions becoming lawless wastelands. - **May 2025**: RABIES-23 victims, now colloquially known as \\"Rabids,\\" roam in groups. Although not undead, their extreme aggression and loss of empathy make them highly dangerous. Areas with dense populations become death traps. 2025-2026: Humanity's Response - **August 2025**: Surviving fragments of governments and independent groups establish fortified settlements. Research into a cure becomes the primary focus, but progress is slow due to the virus's unique combination of traits. - **January 2026**: A breakthrough occurs when scientists develop a prototype vaccine, RAB-IMMUNE24, offering immunity to the airborne components of RABIES-23. Mass production issues and the challenge of administering the vaccine in chaotic regions slow its deployment. 2026-2027: Turning the Tide - **June 2026**: A global coalition forms, consisting of military, scientific, and civilian leaders. This coalition launches a campaign to reclaim territories using air-dropping vaccines and establishing \\"clean zones.\\" - **November 2026**: Clean zones begin expanding as more people are vaccinated. Small communities start rebuilding, focusing on sustainability and self-sufficiency. 2027-Onward: A New Beginning - **April 2027**: With a significant portion of the global population vaccinated, efforts shift towards rehabilitation and the re-establishment of global communication and trade networks. - **December 2027**: The first post-RABIES-23 international summit takes place, outlining plans for a global healthcare initiative to prevent future pandemics. - **2030 and Beyond**: Humanity emerges forever changed, with fortified city-states connected by trade and mutual defense pacts. The memory of RABIES-23 serves as a grim reminder of the importance of cooperation and vigilance in the face of existential threats. # Conclusion The RABIES-23 Chronicles depict a world where humanity faces near extinction, not from the undead, but from a virus that taps into the primal fears of both isolation and aggression. As the survivors rebuild, they foster a new society based on resilience, unity, and the shared understanding of their fragility amid the forces of nature."},{"instruction":"Outbreak named Corvian flu, crow becomes intelligent and create colony, intelligent crows will destroy cure labs, it has many lethal symptoms and able to transmit everything, humanity will destroy intelligent crows, humanity find and destroy colonies of intelligent crows.","output":"**Title: The Corvian Chronicles** **Premise:** In the not-so-distant future, humanity grapples with the outbreak of a highly lethal pandemic termed the \\"Corvian Flu,\\" emanating from a sudden and unexplained spike in the intelligence of crows.

Received: target.shape=(2, 200), output.shape=(2, 20000)\` suggests a mismatch between the shape of the output your model is producing and the shape that your target (labels) data \`y_train\` has. When training a model with Keras, it is essential that the output shape of the model matches the shape of the labels you're trying to predict. Given the error and the shapes involved (\`target.shape=(2, 200), output.shape=(2, 20000)\` as per the error message, which might actually be misinterpreted or misleading, considering the context), here are a few points to consider: 1. **Check Model's Final Layer:** Ensure the last layer of your model matches the expected shape of your \`y_train\`. For classification problems, if you're performing multi-class classification, you should have a final layer with a number of neurons equal to the number of classes, and use a 'softmax' activation function. For regression or multi-label classification, the number of neurons should match the dimensionality of your targets. 2. **Loss Function:** The error message mentions the use of \`sparse_categorical_crossentropy\`, which is typically used when your targets are integer labels. If your \`y_train\` data is in one-hot encoded format, you should use \`categorical_crossentropy\`. If you're dealing with a regression problem, an appropriate loss function like \`mean_squared_error\` would be used instead. 3. **Output Shape vs. Target Shape Match:** Ensure that the model's output shape directly aligns with your \`y_train\` shape. If your training labels are not one-hot encoded and you have a single label per training example for classification, your model's output should still match the number of categories, but your loss function should then be something like \`sparse_categorical_crossentropy\`. Considering the mismatch error, you should: - **Verify the Model's Output:** Double-check the architecture of your network, particularly the last layer, to make sure it corresponds with your task's requirements (classification vs. regression, number of classes, etc.). The error suggests that your model might be configured to output a much larger vector per sample than expected. - **Correct Loss Function:** Depending on whether your task is classification (and what type) or regression, ensure you're using the correct loss function and that your \`y_train\` is formatted appropriately (e.g., one-hot encoding for \`categorical_crossentropy\`, integer labels for \`sparse_categorical_crossentropy\`, etc.). To directly address and investigate the issue further, you'd want to: 1. **Inspect the Model Architecture:** - Look at your model's definition, especially the last layer. If you're unsure of the expected shape, adding \`model.summary()\` before fitting can provide insight into the model's layer outputs. 2. **Review Target Data (\`y_train\`) Formatting:** - Make sure the \`y_train\` formatting aligns with the expectations of both the loss function and the final layer's activation. 3. **Adjust According to Task:** - For multi-class classification, your last layer should have a 'softmax' activation with neurons equal to the number of classes; use \`sparse_categorical_crossentropy\` or \`categorical_crossentropy\` as appropriate. - For regression, ensure the last layer has one neuron for a single output or multiple neurons for multiple regression outputs, with no activation (or a linear activation), and use a loss function like \`mean_squared_error\`. Further reviewing and adjusting these aspects should help in resolving the ValueError you encountered during model training."},{"instruction":"import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import layers, models def get_positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model): positions = np.arange(seq_len)[:, np.newaxis] div_term = np.exp(np.arange(0, d_model, 2) * -(np.log(10000.0) / d_model)) pe = np.zeros((seq_len, d_model)) pe[:, 0::2] = np.sin(positions * div_term) pe[:, 1::2] = np.cos(positions * div_term) return pe class TransformerBlock(layers.Layer): def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, rate=0.1): super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__() self.att = layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=embed_dim) self.ffn = tf.keras.Sequential( [layers.Dense(ff_dim, activation=\\"relu\\"), layers.Dense(embed_dim)] ) self.layernorm1 = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6) self.layernorm2 = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6) self.dropout1 = layers.Dropout(rate) self.dropout2 = layers.Dropout(rate) def call(self, inputs, training=False): attn_output = self.att(inputs, inputs) attn_output = self.dropout1(attn_output, training=training) out1 = self.layernorm1(inputs + attn_output) ffn_output = self.ffn(out1) ffn_output = self.dropout2(ffn_output, training=training) return self.layernorm2(out1 + ffn_output) class TokenAndPositionEmbedding(layers.Layer): def __init__(self, maxlen, vocab_size, embed_dim): super(TokenAndPositionEmbedding, self).__init__() self.token_emb = layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embed_dim) self.pos_emb = layers.Embedding(input_dim=maxlen, output_dim=embed_dim) def call(self, x): maxlen = tf.shape(x)[-1] positions = tf.range(start=0, limit=maxlen, delta=1) positions = self.pos_emb(positions) x = self.token_emb(x) return x + positions # Model Construction vocab_size = 20000 # Example vocabulary size embed_dim = 200 # Embedding size for each token num_heads = 8 # Number of attention heads ff_dim = 2048 # Hidden layer size in feed forward network inside transformer inputs = layers.Input(shape=(200,)) embedding_layer = TokenAndPositionEmbedding(200, vocab_size, embed_dim) x = embedding_layer(inputs) transformer_block = TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim) x = transformer_block(x, training=True) # Just as an example.

With the target shape of \`(10000, 200)\` and model output of \`vocab_size\` (prediction over 20,000 classes for each position in the sequence), it seems like there's a conceptual mismatch in what you're trying to achieve with this model configuration and the nature of your data. Given that \`y_train\` has the shape \`(10000, 200)\`, it appears you are trying to train a model where each input sequence of length 200 maps to an output sequence of the same length, implying a sequence-to-sequence model, possibly for tasks like text generation, where each input position corresponds to an output position. However, your model configuration, especially the loss function \`sparse_categorical_crossentropy\` and the final \`Dense\` layer set to output \`vocab_size\` predictions, aligns more with classification-based objectives where each sequence predicts a single class out of \`vocab_size\` possibilities or, more precisely, each position in the sequence doing so, but not matching with having each sequence element independently predict a class in a way that the shape of \`y_train\` seems to imply (suggesting a label per position per sequence). # Solutions: 1. Adjust Model Output to Match Target Shape: - If your objective is, in fact, sequence-to-sequence modeling (e.g., predicting a sequence of tokens), you might need each timestep of your output to be a distribution over the \`vocab_size\`, but your last layer should ensure the output shape is \`(None, 200, vocab_size)\`. - This can be achieved by ensuring the output layer applies a \`Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')\` after some sequence processing layer like the \`TransformerBlock\`, but ensure the sequence nature is preserved (not using \`GlobalAveragePooling1D\` which reduces the sequence to a single vector). 2. Change Your Target Data (\`y_train\`) Formatting: - If each input sequence corresponds to a series of classifications, ensure \`y_train\` is correctly shaped to match the model's current output. This looks unlikely given your stated shapes, but in principle, for sequence classification tasks, you might have a \`y_train\` shaped \`(batch_size, sequence_length, num_classes)\` for a one-hot encoded format or \`(batch_size, sequence_length)\` for a sparse categorical format where each input position has a class label. 3. Correct Model Architecture for Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction: - **Remove \`GlobalAveragePooling1D()\`:** This layer squashes the sequence into a single vector, losing the positional information necessary for a sequence-to-sequence task. - **Apply a TimeDistributed Dense Layer:** Wrap the final \`Dense\` layer in a \`TimeDistributed\` layer if using other frameworks that require explicit mentioning. In TensorFlow/Keras, simply applying a \`Dense\` layer after a sequence model like an RNN or Transformer block implicitly applies the Dense layer to every time step of the sequence. # Example Fix: For a sequence-to-sequence model aiming to keep the sequence length through to the output, ensuring the output layer matches the requirements: \`\`\`python # Assume other parts of the model as defined above transformer_block = TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim) x = transformer_block(x, training=True) # No GlobalAveragePooling1D x = layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation=\\"softmax\\")(x) # Applied to each position model = models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x) model.compile(optimizer=\\"adam\\", loss=\\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\\", metrics=[\\"accuracy\\"]) \`\`\` This adjustment aligns the model to produce an output for each sequence position and assumes \`y_train\` is formatted as \`(batch_size, sequence_length)\` where each element is the class label (in \`vocab_size\`) for each position in the input sequence."},{"instruction":"show me the full fixe code","output":"Certainly!

The error occurred because the model architecture did not align with the shape of the training data you were trying to fit it to. Here's a breakdown of what the fixed code addresses: 1. **Preserving the Sequence:** It modifies the model to maintain the sequence structure through to the final layer. This ensures that for each position in the input sequence, there's a corresponding output prediction, making the model suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks. 2. **Matching Output Shape to \`y_train\`:** By removing the \`GlobalAveragePooling1D\` layer and directly applying a \`Dense\` layer with a \`softmax\` activation function that maps to the \`vocab_size\`, the model's output shape is adjusted to produce a \`(batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size)\` output. This matches the expected structure where every input token in each sequence can be associated with a class prediction across \`vocab_size\` possible classes. 3. **Aligning Loss Function with Task:** The use of \`\\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\\"\` for the loss function is appropriate for sequence-to-sequence learning where each token in each sequence is classified into one of \`vocab_size\` classes. This assumes that \`y_train\` consists of integer class labels for each position in each sequence, making the training data compatible with the model's revised output structure. 4. **Adaptation to a Wide Range of Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks:** While the code fix is generally applicable, the specific configuration (number of heads, embedding dimension, etc.) might need adjustments based on the specific task, like text translation, summarization, or any other task where the input and output are sequences of potentially different vocabularies or languages. To ensure clarity and applicability to your scenario, here's the essential part of the fixed code: \`\`\`python inputs = layers.Input(shape=(maxlen,)) embedding_layer = TokenAndPositionEmbedding(maxlen, vocab_size, embed_dim) x = embedding_layer(inputs) transformer_block = TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim) x = transformer_block(x) # Ensuring the Dense layer is applied to each sequence position, # making the model output appropriate for sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks. outputs = layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation=\\"softmax\\")(x) model = models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs) model.compile(optimizer=\\"adam\\", loss=\\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\\", metrics=[\\"accuracy\\"]) model.summary() \`\`\` Here, \`maxlen\`, \`vocab_size\`, \`embed_dim\`, etc., are parameters you'd adjust based on the specifics of your task. This fixed structure ensures that the model you're training is suited for the intended purpose, aligning the architecture, the shape of the output, and the labels, thus eliminating the shape mismatch error you encountered earlier."},{"instruction":"Epoch 1/10 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValueError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-256-369d4d9ef092> in <cell line: 1>() ----> 1 history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=2) 1 frames /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/keras/src/utils/traceback_utils.py in error_handler(*args, **kwargs) 120 # To get the full stack trace, call: 121 # \`keras.config.disable_traceback_filtering()\` --> 122 raise e.with_traceback(filtered_tb) from None 123 finally: 124 del filtered_tb /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/keras/src/backend/tensorflow/nn.py in sparse_categorical_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits, axis) 640 ) 641 if len(target.shape) != len(output.shape[:-1]): --> 642 raise ValueError( 643 \\"Argument \`output\` must have rank (ndim) \`target.ndim - 1\`. \\" 644 \\"Received: \\" ValueError: Argument \`output\` must have rank (ndim) \`target.ndim - 1\`. Received: target.shape=(2, 200), output.shape=(2, 8000)","output":"Given this new error message, it seems there is still a misunderstanding regarding the shapes involved in the training process. The message indicates that the target (\`y_train\`) and the model's output are still mismatched in terms of expected dimensions. Specifically, the error suggests that the output of the model does not match the expected shape of the targets. This type of error is common in sequence-to-sequence tasks where there might be a misunderstanding of how inputs and outputs are handled. Here's how to troubleshoot and potentially fix this issue: # 1. Understanding the Error - The error \`target.shape=(2, 200), output.shape=(2, 8000)\` indicates that for each input sequence of length 200, the output is expected to have a sequence of the same length (200), but the actual output has 8000 units. - Given \`vocab_size=20000\` and a batch size of 2, it appears there might be a confusion in how the output dimensions are represented or a mistake in reshaping or specifying the model's final layer. # 2. Possible Causes 1. **Incorrect Model Output Shape**: The model's last layer is outputting a shape that doesn't match the expected \`y_train\` shape. For sequence-to-sequence models, the output for each time step in the sequence should typically be a probability distribution over the vocabulary (for tasks like language modeling or text generation), which implies an output shape of \`(batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size)\`. 2. **Misinterpretation of Error Message**: Given the shape \`(2, 8000)\`, it seems there's a calculation mismatch. The expected model output might be misunderstood. If \`vocab_size=20000\`, then an output shape involving 8000 in any dimension suggests a potential issue in how the layers are constructed or the loss function expects the data. # 3. Verifying \`y_train\` Shape - The target data (\`y_train\`) should be shaped for a sequence-to-sequence model as \`(batch_size, sequence_length)\`, with each entry representing the class index (e.g., word index) in the vocabulary for each sequence position. This seems to be correct based on your report, but double-checking the integrity and format of this data is crucial. # 4. Checking Model Configuration - The final output layer of the model should produce outputs with shape \`(batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size)\` to match each token in the sequence against the entire vocabulary. # 5. Sample Corrected Structure You need to ensure your output layer and possibly the loss function are correctly configured for the task: \`\`\`python # Assuming transformation and embedding layers are defined as per the provided code snippets outputs = layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation=\\"softmax\\")(x) # This should already be correct model = models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs) model.compile(optimizer=\\"adam\\", loss=\\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\\", metrics=[\\"accuracy\\"]) \`\`\` Given this setup: - Double-check the integrity and shape of \`x_train\` and \`y_train\`. - Ensure \`y_train\` is of shape \`(num_samples, sequence_length)\`, which it seems to be. - Confirm the model's output shape right before compilation by printing \`model.summary()\`. # 6. Adjustments if Necessary If your tasks involve predicting at every timestep (a common scenario in sequence-to-sequence models), then the structure above should be correct, assuming \`sparse_categorical_crossentropy\` is the right choice, implying \`y_train\` contains integers representing classes for each timestep. If you're still encountering issues: - Validate the dimensionality of inputs and outputs via debugging or logging, e.g., using \`model.summary()\`. - Reevaluate the loss function's expectations versus the shape and format of your \`y_train\`. Without additional context on the specifics of your dataset and the exact task (e.g., text generation, sequence classification, etc.), this advice aims to cover the general approach to resolving the described issue based on the error message and the provided code snippets."},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Я сейчас на контрольной. срочно нужна твоя помощь, ответь кратко. на 4 минуты в деньASSISTANT:","output":"Конечно, в чем вопрос?"},{"instruction":"veritas vos liberabit. bu söz gibi \\"gerçek\\" hakkında 50 tane motto, atasözü, deyim, özdeyiş, ayet yaz.","output":"1. \\"Açık gerçek, kapalı yalandan iyidir.\\" 2. \\"Gerçek, yalanın maskelediği en büyük hazinedir.\\" 3. \\"Gerçek ancak dilin değil, gözün de dilidir.\\" 4. \\"Gerçek ile yalan arasında ince bir çizgi var.\\" 5. \\"Gerçeği konuşmak, zehirli okları yutmaktır bazen.\\" 6. \\"Gerçeğin yolu tek, yalanın bin yüzü vardır.\\" 7. \\"Karanlıkta bile, gerçek bir gün ışığa çıkar.\\" 8. \\"Gerçeği bulmak cesaret ister.\\" 9. \\"Gerçeği söylemek, dağları hareket ettirebilir.\\" 10. \\"Yalan, gerçeğin önünde diz çöker.\\" 11. \\"Açık gerçeği görmemek için kör olmak gerek.\\" 12. \\"Gerçekten kaçan, yalanla yüzleşmekten korkar.\\" 13. \\"Gerçek, her zaman su yüzüne çıkar.\\" 14. \\"Gerçekleri gizlemek, güneşi avuç içiyle saklamaya benzer.\\" 15. \\"Gerçekten kaçış yoktur, ancak yüzleşmek vardır.\\" 16. \\"Gerçek, zamanın ötesinde yaşar.\\" 17. \\"Gerçeğin gölgesi bile, yalandan daha güçlüdür.\\" 18. \\"Gerçekleri konuşan diller, yalanın kılıcından korkmaz.\\" 19. \\"Yalanla başlanan yolculuk, gerçekle son bulur.\\" 20. \\"Gerçekler acıtır ama yalanlardan daha iyidir.\\" 21. \\"Her gerçeğin iki yüzü vardır; biri anlamak, diğeri yüzleşmek içindir.\\" 22. \\"Gerçek, zamanın testinden geçer.\\" 23. \\"Gerçeği arayan, karanlıkta bile yolu bulur.\\" 24. \\"Gerçek bir gün her kapıyı açar.\\" 25. \\"Gerçek, en derin yaraları bile iyileştirir.\\" 26. \\"Gerçeğin ateşi, yalanın buzunu eritir.\\" 27. \\"Gerçekleri aramak, bilgelik yolunda atılan ilk adımdır.\\" 28. \\"Gerçek yerini hiçbir zaman yalana bırakmaz.\\" 29. \\"Gerçekler bazen gömleğimizdeki buton kadar yakınımızdadır, fark etmeyiz.\\" 30. \\"Gerçek, yalanın dumanını dağıtarak parlar.\\" 31. \\"Gerçek, zamanla değil, cesaretle ortaya çıkar.\\" 32. \\"Gerçeği söylemek, en büyük özgürlüktür.\\" 33. \\"Yalandan yapılan kule, bir gün gerçeğin rüzgarında yıkılır.\\" 34. \\"Gerçeğin peşinden gitmek, uzun bir yolculuktur ama varılacak yer aydınlıktır.\\" 35. \\"Gerçeğe ulaşmanın ilk adımı, kendi yalanlarımızla yüzleşmektir.\\" 36. \\"Yalanla kaplanan gerçek, zamanla soyunur.\\" 37. \\"Gerçek, yıldızlardaki gibi sonsuza dek parlar.\\" 38. \\"Gerçeği arayan kendi iç dünyasına seyahate çıkar.\\" 39. \\"Gerçeki saklamaya çalışmak, güneşi avuçlamaya benzer.\\" 40. \\"Gerçekler, yalanların en büyük düşmanıdır.\\" 41. \\"Gerçek, yalanın perdesini yırtar.\\" 42. \\"Gerçeki söylemek, kılıcını yalanın kalbine saplamaktır.\\" 43. \\"Gerçek, güneş gibi her şeyi aydınlatır.\\" 44. \\"Gerçek, en derin çukurlardan bile çıkar.\\" 45. \\"Gerçeği dinlemek zordur ama yalandan daha iyidir.\\" 46. \\"Gerçeğin gücü, yalanın silahlarından daha keskindir.\\" 47. \\"Gerçek, sonunda her zaman galip gelir.\\" 48. \\"Gerçek bir dost, acı gerçeği yüzünüze vurandır.\\" 49. \\"Gerçeği konuşmak, yalnız kalmaktan daha onurludur.\\" 50. \\"Gerçekler, yalanın karanlığını dağıtan ışıklardır.\\""},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Я сейчас на контрольной. срочно нужна твоя помощь, ответь кратко.

Используете ли вы какую-либо систему очередей задач, такую как RabbitMQ, Celery (для Python), Sidekiq (для Ruby) или другие? Большинство систем очередей требуют предварительной настройки, включая установку самой системы очередей, настройку воркера и настройку клиента для взаимодействия с воркером. 2. **Конфигурация сервера и сети**: Если ваш воркер и клиент находятся на разных серверах или в различных сетевых средах, возможно, потребуется дополнительная настройка сети, включая правила брандмауэра, маршрутизацию и разрешения на уровне сети, чтобы они могли успешно общаться между собой. 3. **Протоколы и форматы данных**: Для успешного взаимодействия клиента с воркером ключевую роль играет соглашение о протоколе обмена данными и формате сообщений. Нужно убедиться, что клиент посылает данные в формате, который воркер сможет распознать и обработать. 4. **Авторизация и аутентификация**: Если система включает механизмы проверки подлинности или авторизации, для успешного взаимодействия между клиентским скриптом и воркером потребуется предварительная настройка этих параметров. В общем случае, просто запустив воркера на сервере и попытавшись отправить ему задачу с клиента, вы вряд ли добьетесь успешного взаимодействия \\"из коробки\\", если только это не очень простая собственная реализация или система с минимальными требованиями к конфигурации.

Вам всё равно потребуется убедиться, что: 1. **Конфигурация Системы Очередей Задач:** Вы настроили систему очередей задач (если таковая используется) корректно, и она запущена. Это включает в себя настройку хранилища задач (например, базы данных для Celery или каналы в Redis), параметры соединения и, возможно, особые параметры воркера. 2. **Форматы и Протоколы Обмена Данными:** Данные, отправляемые клиентом, соответствуют формату, который воркер может обработать. Это может включать сериализацию объектов, сжатие данных и использование определённого протокола обмена. 3. **Зависимости и Среда Воркера:** Воркер может требовать определённой среды выполнения или зависимостей для обработки задач. Например, если ваша задача требует определённых библиотек Python, они должны быть установлены и доступны в среде, в которой выполняется воркер. 4. **Авторизация и Аутентификация:** Даже если клиент и воркер находятся на одном сервере, в зависимости от конфигурации или требований к безопасности, может потребоваться настройка параметров доступа или токенов аутентификации. 5. **Мониторинг и Управление Ошибками:** Подумайте о том, как система будет обрабатывать ошибки, и как вы сможете мониторить состояние задач и воркера. Это может включать логирование, алерты и другие механизмы мониторинга. Даже если клиент и воркер размещены на одном сервере, \\"работа из коробки\\" возможна только в случае, если вы используете очень простую настраиваемую систему или специально разработанную интеграцию, предназначенную для минимизации требований к настройке.

В контексте CSS, когда вы используете свойство \`overflow: hidden;\`, оно обрезает внешнюю часть содержимого, чтобы оно соответствовало заданным размерам элемента. Однако, это не должно препятствовать работе \`padding-bottom\`. Вот несколько возможных причин, по которым у вас может возникнуть это поведение, и способы их решения: 1. **Внешняя обертка или контейнер с ограниченной высотой**: Если у внешнего контейнера или обертки, в которой находится ваш элемент с \`padding-bottom\`, установлено свойство \`height\` или \`max-height\`, и содержимое превышает эту высоту, даже с \`overflow: hidden;\`, это может привести к тому, что нижний отступ (padding) не будет виден. Убедитесь, что у внешних контейнеров достаточно места для отображения полного содержимого внутреннего элемента и его отступов. 2. **Неправильная вложенность или структура CSS**: Проверьте структуру вашего HTML и CSS, чтобы удостовериться, что ни один из родительских элементов не влияет на отображение \`padding-bottom\` вашего элемента неожиданным образом. Иногда непреднамеренное наследование или каскадирование стилей может привести к подобным проблемам. 3. **Использование флексов или сетки (Flexbox или Grid Layout)**: Если ваш элемент находится внутри флекс-контейнера (\`display: flex;\`) или сетки (\`display: grid;\`), поведение отступов может отличаться от ожидаемого из-за свойств выравнивания и распределения пространства внутри контейнера. Например, свойство \`align-items: stretch;\` в флекс-контейнере может растянуть ваш элемент, игнорируя нижние отступы. Попробуйте изменить или настроить свойства выравнивания этих контейнеров. 4. **Проверка в различных браузерах**: Иногда проблема может быть связана с особенностями рендеринга в конкретном браузере. Убедитесь, что вы проверяете вашу страницу в различных браузерах, чтобы исключить этот фактор. 5. **Использование инструментов разработчика**: Используйте инструменты разработчика в вашем браузере, такие как инспектор элементов в Chrome, Firefox или Safari, чтобы точно посмотреть, как применяются стили к элементу и обнаружить возможные проблемы со стилями. Рассмотрев эти пункты, вы сможете более точно диагностировать и устранить проблему с \`padding-bottom\` в вашем дашборде."},{"instruction":"'int' object is not iterable","output":"The error message \`'int' object is not iterable\` occurs in Python when you attempt to iterate over an object that is not iterable, like an integer. Iterables in Python include objects like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings, which can be looped over using a loop (e.g., a \`for\` loop). Integers, being individual numbers, do not support iteration because they are not collections of items. Here's a simple example that would cause this error: \`\`\`python number = 10 for i in number: print(i) \`\`\` In the code above, Python raises a \`TypeError\` because the \`for\` loop expects an iterable object after the \`in\` keyword, but it finds an integer value (\`number\`) instead. To fix this issue, you need to ensure you are iterating over an iterable object. Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you might: - Need to change the object you're iterating over to an actual iterable. - If you're trying to iterate a set number of times indicated by an integer, use \`range()\`. For example, if you wanted to iterate ten times, you could do: \`\`\`python number = 10 for i in range(number): # This will iterate from 0 to 9 print(i) \`\`\` Here, \`range(number)\` generates an iterable sequence of numbers from \`0\` to \`number - 1\`, which avoids the error."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Soulmeuse is habitable and has life, plant life is bioluminescent, radioactivity heats moon habitable and prevent ocean from being frozen. Blue dense atmosphere of Soulmeuse made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, oxygen. Soulmeusian plants uses nyctosynthesis instead of photosynthesis.","output":"The concept of a habitable moon like Soulmeuse orbiting a rogue planet such as Erebus is thoroughly fascinating and offers a rich framework for understanding not only potentially habitable environments in space but also the adaptability of life forms in extreme conditions. The unique characteristics you've outlined for Soulmeuse and its host planet Erebus provide a fantastic basis for exploring several scientific and imaginative concepts. Here’s a breakdown of how these conditions might work from both a scientifically speculative and a fantastical perspective: # The Host: Erebus, the Rogue Planet - **Rogue planets** are free-floating celestial bodies that do not orbit a star but instead wander through space. The existence of such planets is supported by astronomical studies, though their exact properties and numbers remain the subject of research. - Erebus's **black coloration** due to carbons and sulfurs is plausible. Planets and moons with high concentrations of certain elements and compounds can reflect specific wavelengths of light, affecting their coloration as seen from a distance. # The Moon: Soulmeuse - **Bioluminescent plant life** on Soulmeuse could be an evolutionary response to the moon's unique environment. Without a star to provide light, photosynthesis as we know it would not be viable. Bioluminescence could play a role in the life cycle of these plants, perhaps in attracting pollinators or warding off predators. - **Nyctosynthesis** represents an intriguing concept wherein organisms might derive energy from sources other than sunlight. Given the moon's conditions, chemical reactions, perhaps involving the moon's geothermal energy or the ambient radiation, could be the basis for this process. - **Radioactivity as a heat source** points to geothermal activity beneath Soulmeuse's surface, maintaining liquid oceans and a habitable climate. This is somewhat parallel to the conditions found near hydrothermal vents on Earth's ocean floor, where life thrives without sunlight. # Atmospheric Composition and Conditions - The **blue dense atmosphere** made of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), and oxygen (O2) suggests a robust climatic system capable of supporting a water cycle and potentially breathable air for certain life forms. The presence of CO2 and O2 indicates that there could be a carbon cycle facilitated by the native bioluminescent plants. - **Life adaptation** to these conditions would be extreme from an Earth-centric viewpoint. The organisms on Soulmeuse would likely have evolved very different biochemistries to utilize the ambient conditions, possibly respiring CO2 directly from the atmosphere or metabolizing compounds that are toxic or inert to Earth-based life. # Scientific Implausibilities and the Suspension of Disbelief While the setting of Soulmeuse offers a rich tapestry for science fiction narratives and speculative biology, some elements require a suspension of disbelief from a strict scientific standpoint: - **Maintaining a stable, life-supporting climate** on a moon orbiting a rogue planet is challenging without external heat sources. The proposed radioactivity and geothermal energy must be exceptionally stable and distributed to prevent atmospheric collapse or runaway freezing. - **Nyctosynthesis,** while a fascinating concept, would need a defined energy source as its basis. On Earth, photosynthesis uses sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. For nyctosynthesis, a plausible energy conversion process must exist, likely tied to the moon's unique environmental conditions. In summary, the conception of Soulmeuse and Erebus as a coupled celestial system provides a vivid and imaginative setting that prompts curiosity and wonder about the possibilities of life beyond our solar system. Such ideas push the boundaries of current scientific understanding and encourage speculative exploration of what could exist in the vastness of our universe, underscoring the fact that reality can often be as strange and wondrous as fiction."},{"instruction":"Soulmeusian faunas: Sēoft - Azurite crow Āhepft - Malachite jackdaw Wīpokim - Reptilian animal Xencena - Orange feline Geʃ‎aūi - Cephalopod marine animal Cimes - Dolphin-like marine animal Āfenst - Glowing flying insect Xennot - Shadowstalker predator, including appearance look like what animal","output":"The description of Soulmeusian fauna presents a vivid tapestry of alien wildlife adapted to the unique conditions of Soulmeuse.
